 Preface to the second edition  
 We are delighted that  Lecture Notes: Oncology  has 
progressed to a second edition, returning by 
popular demand with an updated format, enor-
mous revisions and a few poor jokes. 
 The last decade has seen tremendous changes in 
oncology, with marvellous developments in tar-
geted therapies, based on an understanding of the 
molecular biology of cancer. We are at a stage in 
oncology where death rates have fallen in many 
cancers, and where the survival for patients with 
metastatic disease has, in many instances, doubled. 
Cancer doctors used to proudly talk about curing 
a small minority of tumours such as lymphoma, 
leukaemia, choriocarcinoma and testicular cancer, 
but currently this shortlist of survivable cancers 
has increased, providing optimism in oncologists 
and delight in patients. 
 Oncology involves an understanding of the 
processes that lead to the development of malig-
nant disease, and this understanding has led Medi-
cine by its nose to the frontiers of science. These are 
exhilarating times to be an oncologist and we hope 
that the reader of this book enjoys our efforts to 
convey our excitement in oncology.

Introduction to Oncology

 Chapter 1 
What  i s  c ancer? 
 Cancer is not a single illness but a collection of 
many diseases that share common features. Cancer 
is widely viewed as a disease of genetic origin. It is 
caused by mutations of DNA and epigenetic 
changes that alter gene expression, which make a 
cell multiply uncontrollably. However, the descrip-
tion and deﬁ nitions of cancer vary depending on 
the perspective as described below. 
 Epidemiological  p erspective 
 Cancer is a major cause of morbidity in the United 
Kingdom with around 289   000 new cases diag-
nosed in 2005. There are more than 200 different 
types of cancer, but four of them (breast, lung, 
colorectal and prostate) account for over half of all 
new cases. Overall it is estimated that one in three 
people will develop some form of cancer during 
their lifetime. In the 30 - year period 1976 – 2005 the 
overall age - standardized incidence rates for cancer 
increased by 35% in men and 16% in women but 
have remained fairly constant over the last decade 
(1996 – 2005). The cancers whose incidence is rising 
fastest in men are malignant melanoma, mes-
othelioma, prostate cancer and hepatocellular 
cancer, while in women they are mesothelioma, 
melanoma, endometrial cancer and oral cancer. 
 Cancer incidence refers to the number of new 
cancer cases arising in a speciﬁ ed period of time. 
Prevalence refers to the number of people who 
have received a diagnosis of cancer who are alive at 
any given time, some of whom will be cured and 
others will not. Therefore prevalence reﬂ ects both 
the incidence of cancer and its associated survival 
pattern. In 2008 approximately 3% of the popula-
tion of the UK (around two million people) are alive 
having received a diagnosis of cancer. The single 
cancer that contributes most to the prevalence is 
breast cancer, with an estimated 550   000 women 
alive who have had a diagnosis of breast cancer.  
 Sociological  p erspective 
 Patients with cancer adopt a medically sanctioned 
form of deviant behaviour described in the 1950s 
by Talcott Parsons as  ‘ the sick role ’ . In order to be 
excused their usual duties and to not be considered 
responsible for their illness, patients are expected 
to seek professional advice and to adhere to treat-
ments in order to get well. Medical practitioners 
are empowered to sanction their temporary 
absence from the workforce and family duties as 
well as to absolve them of blame. This behavioural 
model minimizes the impact of illness on society 
and reduces the secondary gain that the patient 
beneﬁ ts from as a consequence of their illness. 
However, as Ivan Illich pointed out it also sets 
up physicians as agents of social control by

medicalizing health and contributing to iatrogenic 
illness  –  ‘ a medical nemesis ’ . Of all the common 
medical diagnoses, cancer probably carries the 
greatest stigma and is associated with the most 
fear. The many different ways in which cancer 
affects people has been explored in literature (Table 
 1.1 ). 
 Experimental  p erspective 
 In the laboratory, a number of characteristics 
deﬁ ne a cancer cell growing in culture. The four 
features listed below are used by scientists experi-
mentally to conﬁ rm the malignant phenotype of 
cancer cells: 
 1.   Cancer cells are clonal, having all derived from 
a single parent cell.  
 2.   Cancer cells grow on soft agar, in the absence of 
growth factors.  
 3.  Cancer cells cross artiﬁ cial membranes in 
culture systems.  
 4.  Cancer cells form tumours if injected into 
immunodeﬁ cient strains of mice (Box  1.1 ). 
 Histopathological  p erspective 
 Cancer is usually deﬁ ned by various histopatho-
logical features, most notably invasion and metas-
tasis, that are observed by gross pathological and 
microscopic examinations. Laminin staining of 
 Box 1.1:   Onco - mice 
 Mice have been used as a laboratory model in cancer 
research for a century. In the 1930s, Sir Ernest Kennaway 
showed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were car-
cinogenic by inducing skin cancers in mice. In 1969 the 
ﬁ rst inbred mice were developed that were essentially 
genetically identical except for gender. These strains 
allowed the transfer of cells and tissues between mice 
without rejection as they are syngeneic (genetically iden-
tical). This has allowed the effects of experimental treat-
ments on murine cancers to be evaluated in laboratory 
mice. Some inbred strains also spontaneously develop 
cancers (e.g. BALB/c mice frequently develop lung 
tumours) so that the effects of cancer prevention strate-
gies can be studied. The development of immunodeﬁ -
cient mice allowed the transfer and study of human 
cancer cells in mice without the mice rejecting the 
xenograft (graft between different species). The ﬁ rst 
immunodeﬁ cient mice were  ‘ nude mice ’ , an inbred 
strain that lacks a thymus gland and T lymphocytes; they 
are hairless because of a mutation in a linked genetic 
locus. Subsequently, in 1983, even more immunodeﬁ -
cient SCID (severe combined immunodeﬁ ciency) mice 
were developed that lack both T and B cells. Genetically 
modiﬁ ed transgenic mice have been manufactured by 
knocking out speciﬁ c genes ( ‘ knockout mice ’ ) or adding 
extra trans - genes, usually from different species ( ‘ trans-
genic mice ’ ), to embryonic stem cells. These mice are 
used to elucidate the inﬂ uence of individual genes on the 
phenotype. Finally, mice were the original source of 
monoclonal antibodies produced by immunizing inbred 
mice with the desired antigen and fusing spleen cells 
from the mouse with myeloma cells to yield hybridoma 
cells that produce monoclonal antibodies.  
the basement membrane may assist the his-
topathologist in identifying local invasion by 
tumours that breach the basement membrane. In 
addition a number of microscopic features point to 
the diagnosis of cancer: 
  ●    Cancer cells differ morphologically from normal 
cells 
  ●    Tumour architecture is less organized than that 
of the parent tissue  
  ●    Cancer cells have increased nuclear DNA and 
nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio  
  ●    Cancer cells have hyperchromatic nuclei with 
coarsening of chromatin and wrinkled nuclear 
edges

  ●    Cancer cells may be multinucleated or have 
macronucleoli 
  ●    Cancer cells may have numerous and bizarre 
mitotic ﬁ gures  
 Cancers may be heterogenous with cells of 
varying sizes and orientation with respect to one 
another despite their clonal origin.  
 Molecular  p erspective 
 The molecular features that identify a cancer are 
described in  ‘ Six steps to becoming a cancer ’ in 
Chapter  2 . These six properties are: 
 1.  Grow without a trigger (self - sufﬁ ciency in 
growth stimuli).  
 2.   Don ’ t stop growing (insensitivity to inhibitory 
stimuli). 
 Box 1.2:   Histopathology deﬁ nitions 
 Quantitative  c hanges:  t oo  s mall 
 Atrophy 
 Acquired shrinkage due to a decrease in the  size or number  of cells of a tissue, e.g. decrease in size of the ovaries after 
the menopause.  
 Quantitative  c hanges:  t oo  b ig 
 Hypertrophy 
 Increase in the size of an organ or tissue due to an increase in the  size of individual cells, e.g. pregnant uterus.  
 Hyperplasia 
 Increase in the  size  of an organ due to an increase in the  number  of cells, e.g. lactating breast.  
 Qualitative  c hanges 
 Metaplasia 
 Replacement of one cell type in an organ by another. This implies changes in the differentiation programme and is usually 
a response to persistent injury. It is reversible so that removal of the source of injury results in reversion to the original cell 
type, e.g. sqamous metaplasia of laryngeal respiratory epithelium in a smoker. Chronic irritation from smoking causes 
the normal columnar respiratory epithelium to be replaced by the more resilient squamous epithelium.  
 Dysplasia 
 Dysplastic changes are changes in cell type, as for metaplasia, that do not revert to normal once the injury is removed, 
e.g. cervical dysplasia initiated by human papillomavirus infection persists after eradication of the virus. Dysplasia is 
usually considered to be part of the spectrum of changes leading to neoplasia.  
 Invasion 
 The capacity to inﬁ ltrate the surrounding tissues and organs is a characteristic of cancer.  
 Metastasis 
 The ability to proliferate in distant parts of the body after tumour cells have been transported by lymph or blood or along 
body spaces.  
 3.  Don ’ t die (evasion of apoptosis).  
 4.  Don ’ t age (immortalization).  
 5.  Feed themselves (neoangiogenesis).  
 6.  Spread (invasion and metastasis).  
 How to  r ead a  h istology  r eport 
 The diagnosis of cancer is most commonly estab-
lished following a histopathological report of a 
biopsy or tumour resection. A histopathological 
report should include both gross pathological fea-
tures (tumour size and number and size of lymph 
nodes examined) and microscopic ﬁ ndings (tumour 
grade, architecture, mitotic rate, margin involve-
ment and lymphovascular invasion). The grade and 
stage of a cancer are important prognostic factors 
that may inﬂ uence therapy options (Box  1.2 ).

 A  h istopathological  d eﬁ nition of  c ancer: 
 i s  i t  m alignant or  b enign? 
 Malignancy is usually characterized by various 
behavioural features, most notably invasion and 
metastasis. However, the histopathologist may 
have to identify a cancer without this information. 
Cancers are composed of clonal cells (all are the 
progeny of a single cell) and have lost control of 
their tissue organization and architecture. In addi-
tion to the natural history, a number of physical 
properties help to distinguish between benign and 
malignant tumours (Table  1.2 ). However, there is 
no single histological feature that deﬁ nes a cancer 
nor indeed that separates benign from malignant 
tumours. In general, benign tumours are rarely life -
 threatening but may cause health problems on 
account of their location (by pressure or obstruc-
tion of adjacent organs) or by overproduction of 
hormones. In contrast malignant tumours usually 
follow a progressive course and unless successfully 
treated are frequently fatal.  
 Is  i t  in  s itu or  i nvasive? 
 Invasive cancers extend into the surrounding 
stroma (see Plate  1.1 ). However tumours that 
exhibit all the microscopic features of cancers but

or lobules (lobular carcinoma  in situ  or LCIS) (see 
Plate  1.2 ). Similar pre - invasive  in situ  cancers have 
been found in many organs (e.g. cervix, anus, pros-
tate, bronchus) and are believed to represent a 
stage in the progression from dysplasia to cancer 
(see Plate  1.3 ). 
 Histopathologist ’ s  n omenclature:  n ame 
that  c ancer 
 The histopathologists ’ lexicon often can be a tool 
for obfuscation, but follow a few simple rules and 
you can translate their lingo. The sufﬁ x  - oma 
usually denotes a benign tumour (although it 
simply means  ‘ swelling ’  and some  - omas are not 
tumours, e.g. xanthoma). If a tumour is malignant 
the sufﬁ x  - carcinoma (Greek for crab) is used for 
epithleial cancers or  - sarcoma (Greek for ﬂ esh) for 
connective tissue cancers. The preﬁ x is determined 
by the cells of origin of the tumour (e.g. adeno - for 
glandular epithelium), qualiﬁ ed by the tissue of 
origin (e.g. prostatic adenocarcinoma). There are 
numerous exceptions to this systematic nomencla-
ture; for example leukaemias and lymphomas are 
malignant tumours of bone marrow and lymphoid 
tissue, respectively. As a general rule neoplasms are 
classiﬁ ed according to the type of normal tissue 
they most closely resemble. The four major catego-
ries are: epithelial, connective tissue, lymphoid 
and haemopoietic tissue, and germ cells (Tables 
 1.3 – 1.6 ). The latter arise in totipotential cells, and 
can develop into any cell type. Germ cell tumours 
contain a variety of different mature and/or imma-
ture tissues from different embryonic germ layers, 
and these are given names with the root terato - 
(Greek for monster). In addition, as with most 
ﬁ elds of medicine where physicians try to leave 
their mark, there are a number of eponymous 
names (e.g. Hodgkin ’ s disease). (Thomas Hodgkin 
(of Guy ’ s Hospital) described seven cases in 1832 of 
the tumour that bears his name but re - examina-
tion in 1926 revealed that the diagnosis was inac-
curate in four of the seven cases.)

 Tumour  g rading 
 Tumours are graded according to the degree of 
tissue differentiation. Cancers that closely resem-
ble their tissue of origin are graded as well differen-
tiated cancers. Cancers that look nothing like the 
original tissue and have histological features of 
aggressive growth with high mitotic rates are 
graded as poorly differentiated cancers. The grade 
of a tumour is of prognostic signiﬁ cance. 
 In the case of breast cancer, the Scarff – Bloom –
 Richardson system is usually used to grade cancers 
based upon three features: the frequency of cell 
mitosis, tubule formation, and nuclear pleomor-
phism. Each of these features is assigned a score 
ranging from 1 to 3 (1 indicating slower cell growth 
and 3 indicating faster cell growth). The scores of 
each of the cells ’ features are then added together 
for a ﬁ nal sum that will range between 3 and 9. A 
tumour with a ﬁ nal sum of 3, 4 or 5 is considered a 
grade 1 tumour (well differentiated). A sum of 6 or 
7 is considered a grade 2 tumour (moderately dif-
ferentiated), and a sum of 8 or 9 is a grade 3 tumour 
(poorly differentiated). The ﬁ ve - year overall sur-
vival for grades 1, 2 and 3 are 95%, 75% and 50%, 
respectively. 
 In addition, pathologists may identify other fea-
tures that relate to the natural behaviour of a 
tumour, such as lymphovascular invasion, which 
usually denotes a worse prognosis. The molecular 

Chapter 1 What is cancer?
8
properties of a cancer can also inﬂ uence the 
biology, prognosis and treatment of a tumour. For 
example, the gene expression prolife of a breast 
cancer may be determined by gene expression 
microarray chip technology and the results assist 
clinicians in optimizing adjuvant therapy (see 
Plate  1.4 ). 
 Unknown  p rimary  i dentiﬁ cation 
( s tandard  h istological  t echniques) 
 Occasionally patients present with metastatic 
cancer without an obvious primary tumour site 
and, in addition to a careful clinical and radiologi-
cal examination, the pathologist may provide a 
clue to the origins of the cancer. Most unknown 
primary cancers are adenocarcinoma (60%), and 
the remainder are poorly differentiated carcino-
mas (30%) and squamous cell carcinomas (5%). 
Light microscopy may provide pointers, for 
example the presence of melanin pigment favours 
melanoma, whilst mucin production is common 
in gastrointestinal, breast and lung cancers but less 
common in ovarian cancers and is rare in renal cell 
and thyroid cancers. Immunocytochemical stain-
ing of tissue samples can aid the pathologist in 
tissue identiﬁ cation. For example, the presence of 
oestrogen and progesterone receptors favours a 
diagnosis of breast cancer, whilst prostate - speciﬁ c 
antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase staining 
points to prostatic adenocarcinoma. Similarly, 
cytokeratin expression patterns may provide 
helpful hints about the origin of metastatic cancers 
(Box  1.3  and see Plate  1.5 ). Cell surface immu-
nophenotyping is a sophistication of immunocy-
tochemistry 
that 
is 
frequently 
applied 
to 
haematological malignancies. The pattern of 
immunoglobulin, T - cell receptor and cluster desig-
nation (CD) antigen expression on the surface of 
lymphomas is helpful in their diagnosis and clas-
siﬁ cation. Immunophenotyping can be achieved 
by immunohistochemical staining, immunoﬂ uo-
rescent staining or ﬂ ow cytometry.  
 Unknown  p rimary  i dentiﬁ cation ( s pecial 
 h istological  t echniques) 
 The study of intracellular organelles by electron 
microscopy may identify the cellular origin of a 
tumour; for example, the presence of melano-
somes in melanomas and dense core neurosecre-
tory granules in neuroendodermal tumours. 
Further laboratory techniques to aid diagnosis 
include molecular studies of DNA rearrangements 
that 
characterize 
malignancies. 
Monoclonal 
immunoglobulin gene rearrangements are present 
in B - cell malignancies and rearrangements of T - cell 
receptors occur in T - cell tumours. In addition, a 
number of chromosomal translocations involving 
the immunoglobulin genes (heavy chain on chro-
mosome 14q32, light chains on 2p12 and 22q11) 
and T - cell receptor genes (TCR α on 14q11, TCR β 
on 7q35, TCR γ on 7p15, TCR δ on 14q11) occur in 
malignancies arising from these cell types. For 
instance, low - grade follicular lymphomas rear-
range the Bcl - 2 gene on 18q21 (e.g. t(14;18)
(q32;q21)), most Burkitt lymphomas rearrange the 
Myc gene on 8q24 (e.g. t(8;14)(q24;q32)) and most 
mantle cell lymphomas rearrange Bcl - 1 on 11q13 
(e.g. t(11;14)(q13;q32)). These rearrangements 
may be detected by karyotype analysis of mitotic 
chromosome preparations or by molecular tech-
niques including Southern blotting and polymer-
ase chain reaction (Box  1.4 and Table  1.7 ). Less 
commonly these same methods may assist the 
diagnosis of solid tumours that are associated with 
speciﬁ c chromosomal abnormalities such as the 
i(12p) isochromosome found in germ cell tumours 
and the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation seen in 
Ewing ’ s sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal 
tumours. In addition to translocations, gene ampli-
ﬁ cation may be detected and may have prognostic

expressed in pairs comprising a type I (cytokeratins 9 – 20) 
and a type II (cytokeratins 1 – 8) cytokeratin. Different 
tissues express different pairs and immunocytochemical 
staining for cytokeratins can help identify the likely tissue 
origins of cancers cells. For example in disseminated peri-
toneal metastases, CK7 expression favours an ovarian 
origin, whilst lack of CK7 is more common in colorectal 
cancer (Figure  1.3 ).

 Box 1.4:   The language of chromosomes  – karyotype nomenclature 
 Each arm of a chromosome is divided into one to four major regions, depending on chromosomal length; each band, 
positively or negatively stained, is given a number, which rises as the distance from the centromere increases. The normal 
male is designated as 46,XY and the normal female as 46,XX. 
 
 For example, 11q23 designates the chromosome (11), the long arm (q), the second region distal to the centromere (2) 
and the third band (3) in that region. 
 Polyploid 
 Cell with more than one complete chromosome set or with multiples of the basic number of chromosomes characteristic 
of the species; in humans this would be 69,92, etc.  
 Aneuploid 
 Individual with one or more chromosomes in addition or missing from the complete chromosome set; for example 
trisomy 21 (47,XX +21).  
 Deletion 
 The loss of a chromosome segment from a normal chromosome.  
 Duplication 
 An extra piece of chromosome segment which may be attached to the same homologous chromosome or transposed 
to another chromosome in the genome.  
 Inversion 
 A change in linear sequence of the genes in a chromosome that results in the reverse order of genes in a chromosome 
segment. Inversions may be pericentric (two breaks on either side of the centromere) or paracentric (both breaks on the 
same arm).  
 Isochromosome 
 breaks in one arm of a chromosome followed by duplication of the other arm of the chromosome to produce a chromo-
some with two arms that are both short (p) or both long (q) arms.  
 Translocations 
 Translocations are the result of the reciprocal exchange of terminal segments of non - homologous chromosomes.

oncogene in neuroblastoma is an adverse prognos-
tic variable.  
 How to  s tage a  t umour 
 In addition to the histological grade of a tumour, 
an important criterion in treatment decisions and 
the major determinant of outcome is the extent of 
spread or stage of a cancer (Figure  1.1 ). Staging a 
tumour is essentially an anatomical exercise that 
uses a combination of clinical examination and 
radiology. A uniform staging system is employed 
for most tumour sites that is based upon the size of 
the primary  T umour, the presence of regional 
lymph  N odes and of distant  M etastases. The details 
of this  TNM classiﬁ cation vary between different 
tumour sites. As always there are exceptions, 
including the staging system for lymphomas that 
was originally set out following a conference at the 
University of Michigan in Ann Arbour. It is known 
as the Ann Arbour Staging System and most radi-
ologists assume that it is named after a person 
rather than a town, so this is a chance to score 
points at the X - ray meetings.  
 Radiology  t echniques 
 Staging depends to a large extent upon radiology 
and this is the most commonly used tool to evalu-
ate the response of cancers to therapies. Anatomi-
cal imaging by plain ﬁ lms, computed tomography 
(CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) are the standard methods. Using the correct 

What is cancer? Chapter 1

original magnetic alignment may be detected as 
radiofrequency signals. The signal intensity relates 
to the concentration of mobile hydrogen nuclei in 
tissues. T1 (longitudinal relaxation or spin - lattice) 
and T2 (transverse relaxation or spin - spin) relaxa-
tion time constants depend on the physical prop-
erties of the tissues. If you want to impress the 
neuroradiologists (not always a useful ploy in the 
authors ’  experience), water such as cerebrospinal 
ﬂ uid (CSF) is black (low signal intensity) on T1 
images and white (high signal intensity) on T2 
images (Figure  1.2 ). Whilst CT is a good tool to 
examine tissues composed of high atomic weight 
elements such as bone, MRI is better suited to non -
 calciﬁ ed tissues. For similar reasons CT contrast 
agents usually are composed of high atomic 
number atoms such as iodine or barium, whilst 
MRI contrast agents such as gadolinium are para-
magnets that have magnetic properties only in the 
presence of an externally applied magnetic ﬁ eld. 
MRI is generally superior for imaging the brain, 
whilst CT is better for solid tumours of the chest 
and abdomen as it is faster and generates fewer 
motion artifacts. MRI is also better suited to 
patients who may require many examinations 
because it does not carry the risks of ionizing radia-
tion. MRI is, however, contraindicated in patients 
with metallic objects such as pacemakers  in situ 
and it is also quite claustrophobic and noisy in the 
scanner. 
 Positron  e mission  t omography 
 Positron emission tomography (PET) is a func-
tional imaging modality that detects  γ - rays emitted 
by positrons (positively charged electrons) emit-
ting radionuclide tracers. Positrons have a short 
half - life and are generated by cyclotrons. Common 
positron - labelled radionuclides include ﬂ uorine 
( 18 F), carbon ( 11 C), oxygen ( 15 O) and nitrogen ( 13 N). 
In oncology the most frequently used tracer is 
 18 F - ﬂ uorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a short half - life 
glucose analogue that is taken up into actively 
metabolizing cells including cancer cells and fol-
lowing intracellular phosphorylation is trapped in 
these cells. Hence the distribution in the body of 
terms impresses other clinicians and may make a 
trip to the radiology department less daunting for 
junior doctors requensting an investigation. X - rays 
measure radiodensity (radiolucency and radio -
 opacity) and ultrasound measures echogenicity 
and echoreﬂ ectivity, whilst CT scans report attenu-
ation values measured in Hounsﬁ eld units and MRI 
reports signal intensity. 
 Computed  t omography 
 CT scanning is the production of three - dimen-
sional images using X - rays that have been directed 
through tissues and the images produced depend 
on the density of the tissues. CT was developed in 
the 1970s by Sir Godfrey Hounsﬁ eld and Allan 
McLeod Cormack who shared the Nobel Prize in 
1979. The ﬁ rst CT scanner built at EMI Central 
Research Laboratories is said to have been funded 
by the success of the Beatles who were signed to the 
EMI label. CT measures the attenuation of different 
tissues to ionizing radiation and calculates a mean 
value for a volume of tissue known as a voxel. This 
is displayed on a two - dimensional image as a single 
pixel. The attenuation is calculated relative to 
water which has a Hounsﬁ eld unit (HU) value of 0, 
so high attenutation tissues have a positive HU 
value (e.g. bone +400   HU) and low attenuation 
tissues a negative HU value (e.g. fat  − 120   HU). Dif-
ferent window settings are used to look at different 
ranges of the Hounsﬁ eld greyscale. For example, in 
the bone windows setting the lungs will look uni-
formly black whilst in the lung windows the bones 
look uniformly white. Intravenous iodinated con-
trast agents improve the sensitivity and speciﬁ city 
of CT but are contraindicated in patients with 
asthma or allergies to contrast.  
 Magnetic  r esonance  i maging 
 Unlike CT, MRI does not use ionizing radiation but 
instead a powerful magnetic ﬁ eld aligns the spin of 
protons, especially hydrogen atom protons, in 
water and fat. A radiofrequency pulse then ener-
gizes the protons and the gradual release of this 
energy from the protons as they relax back to their

with midline shift, compression of the right lateral ventricle and peritumoral oedema. In the T1 image the CSF is black (low 
attenuation) and the bone is white (high attenuation), whilst in the T2 image the CSF is white (high attenuation) and the 
bone is black (low attenuation).  
FDG reﬂ ects glucose uptake within the body. This 
means that PET scanning may differentiate 
between residual masses and active disease in lym-
phoma. As a consequence FDG - PET scanning is 
used in both staging and monitoring cancer treat-
ment (Figure  1.3 and see Plate  1.6 ). 
 Radio - i sotope  s canning 
 In addition to PET scanning other functional 
images may be used in the diagnosis and staging of 
speciﬁ c cancers, using isotope - labelled radionu-
clide tracer elements (Table  1.8 and Figure  1.4 ). 
The isotope - labelled tracers that are used diagnos-
tically may also be used therapeutically. Bone scin-
tigraphy uses bisphosphonates labelled with  99 Tc 
and is more sensitive than X - rays for detecting 
metastases. 
 Performance  s tatus 
 In addition to the histological grade and the stage 
of a cancer, the general health of patients will 
determine how long they survive and may inﬂ u-
ence treatment decisions. Scales that measure the 
performance status or functional capacity of 
patients include the ECOG (Eastern Co - operative 
Oncology Group) grading system and the Kar-
novsky scale (Table  1.9 ). The performance status, 
however estimated, is an important prognostic 
indicator for almost all tumour types.  
 Prognosis:  i t ’ s  n ot  c ancer  i s  i t  d oc? 
 Although a very signiﬁ cant stigma is attached to 
the diagnosis of cancer, for most of the general 
population the fear outweighs the reality and com-
parison with other more palatable illnesses yield 
results that are not always expected (Table  1.10 ).

 The UK has 640 cancer charities to counter the 
disease. Their expenditure increases awareness of 
cancer, improves diagnosis and treatment capabil-
ity, and provides care for patients with the disease. 
The total income generated by the top 20 UK 
cancer charities in 2004 was  £ 758m, and the 
average charitable efﬁ ciency was 64% providing 
 £ 488m for spending on patients ’ care and research. 
The two largest UK cancer charities, the Imperial 
Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) and the Cancer 
Research Campaign (CRC) merged to form Cancer 
Research UK (CRUK) in 2002. CRUK is the largest 
volunteer - supported cancer research organization 
in the world, with 3000 scientists and an annual 
scientiﬁ c spend of more than  £ 339 million  – raised 
almost entirely through public donations.  
increasing wealth and increasing cancer incidence. 
This is attributable to tobacco use, diet and in -
creased longevity in wealthy populations. There 
are intriguing exceptions, for example the Gulf 
states of Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emir-
ates and Saudi Arabia have lower cancer incidences

 Cancer  h ospitals 
 Philanthropists and social reformers during the 
19th century tried to provide free medical care for 
the poor. William Marsden, a young surgeon 
opened a dispensary for advice and medicines in 
1828. His grandly named London General Institu-
tion for the Gratuitous Cure of Malignant Diseases 
 – a simple four - storey house in one of the poorest 
parts of the city  – was conceived as a hospital to 
which the only passport should be poverty and 
disease and where treatment was provided free of 
charge. The demand for Marsden ’ s free services was 
overwhelming and by 1844 his dispensary, now 
called the Royal Free Hospital, was treating 30   000 
patients a year. In 1846 when his wife died of 
cancer, Marsden opened a small house in Cannon 
Row, Westminster, for patients suffering from 
cancer. Within 10 years the institution moved to 
Fulham Road and became known as the Cancer 
Hospital, of which Marsden was the senior surgeon. 
The hospital was incorporated into the National 
Health Service in 1948 and renamed the Royal 
Marsden Hospital in 1954. Although other cancer 
hospitals have been established in Manchester (the 
Christie Hospital) and Glasgow (the Beatson Hos-
pital), the Royal Marsden Hospital remains the 
most renown. With the recent emphasis on multi-
disciplinary approaches to cancer, single specialty 
hospitals are less in vogue and the majority of 
cancer departments are within large teaching 
hospitals. 
 Cancer  c elebrities 
 Celebrities inﬂ uence public perceptions and 
behaviour inordinately and this is as true in oncol-
ogy as elsewhere. Celebrities with cancer have con-
tributed in three main ways: personal accounts 
bring patients ’ experiences into the limelight, 
reports of celebrity patients increase public aware-
ness and may encourage health - seeking behaviour 
such as stopping smoking, and celebrity patients 
may support cancer charities and encourage dona-
tions. Prominent examples of patient ’ s perspec-
tives include John Diamond ’ s account in  C: Because 
Cowards get Cancer, Too  and Ruth Picardie ’ s  Before I 
Say Goodbye , both moving accounts by accom-
plished journalists. Celebrity patients can inﬂ u-
ence the treatment choices that the public make. 
Following Nancy Reagan ’ s mastectomy for local-
ized breast cancer in 1987, there was a 25% fall in 
American women choosing breast - conserving 
surgery over mastectomy. Her husband ’ s success-
ful surgery for Dukes ’ B colon cancer whilst presi-
dent in 1984 increased awareness and propelled 
the warning signs of colon cancer into the media. 
Similarly, the diagnosis and death from cervical 

What is cancer? Chapter 1
17
cancer in 2009 of Jade Goody, a  Big Brother  celeb-
rity, led to an increased uptake of cervical cancer 
screening especially amongst young women in the 
UK. Successful cancer treatment is often most 
widely publicized and no article describing Lance 
Armstrong ’ s seven consecutive Tour de France 
cycling victories is complete without a mention of 
his treatment for metastatic non - seminomatous 
germ cell tumour and his two children conceived 
with stored sperm banked prior to chemotherapy. 
Other celebrity patients have used their wealth and 
fame to establish and support charitable projects to 
support cancer research and treatment including 
Bob Champion, the steeple chase jockey treated for 
testicular cancer in the 1979, and Roy Castle, a life -
 long non - smoker who was diagnosed with lung 
cancer in 1992. Of course, no one is immune to 
cancer; even rock stars whose deaths are more tra-
ditionally associated with suicide and substance 
abuse (Table  1.12 ).

 Chapter 2 
The scientiﬁ c basis of cancer  
 Six steps to becoming a cancer 
 At a molecular level cancer cells are characterized 
by six acquired biological properties: 
 1.   Self - sufﬁ ciency in growth stimuli (keep on 
doubling). 
 2.  Insensitivity to inhibitory stimuli (don ’ t stop 
doubling). 
 3.  Evasion of apoptosis (don ’ t die).  
 4.  Immortalization (don ’ t age).  
 5.   Neoangiogenesis (feed themselves).  
 6.  Invasion and metastasis (spread).  
 It is not certain, but probable, that all six features 
are necessary to a greater or lesser extent for a cell 
to posses malignant behaviour (Figure  2.1 ). Some 
single molecular changes in cancer cells may 
produce more than one of the six attributes (e.g. 
mutations of p53 may cause both avoidance of 
apoptosis and insensitivity to inhibitory stimuli). 
A number of mechanisms may contribute to the 
acquisition of these six properties, including 
genomic instability as a consequence of deﬁ cient 
DNA repair or loss of cell cycle arrest/death in 
response to DNA damage as well as epigenetic dys-
regulation of gene expression.  
 1.  Autonomous growth signals 
 The instruction to a cell to grow and start dividing 
is communicated by extracellular growth factor 
ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. This 
usually results in the reversible phosphorylation of 
tyrosine, threonine or serine amino acid residues 
of the receptor. The transfer of these molecular 
switches from activated phosphorylated receptors 
to downstream signalling enzyme effectors and 
then to non - enzymatic second messengers in the 
cytoplasm and ﬁ nally to nuclear transcription acti-
vators, is known as signal transduction (Figure 
 2.2 ). This cascade results in ampliﬁ cation of the 
initial stimulus. Cancers achieve self - sufﬁ ciency in 
growth factors and do not depend on these extra-
cellular ligands for continued growth. The major-
ity of dominant oncogenes act on this signal 
transduction mechanism by one of the following 
mechanisms: 
  ●    Overproducing growth factors, e.g. glioblasto-
mas produce platelet - derived growth factor (PDGF)  
  ●    Overproducing growth factor receptors, e.g. epi-
dermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/erbB) overex-
pression in breast cancers 
  ●    Mutations of the receptor or components 
of the signalling cascade that are constitutively 
active, e.g. mutations of Ras in lung and colonic 
cancers.

 2.  Insensitivity to cell cycle checkpoints 
 Many normal cells grow throughout their lifespan 
and the co - ordination of their growth, differentia-
tion, senescence and death is controlled by the cell 
cycle. Antiproliferative signals may be received by 
cells as soluble growth inhibitors or ﬁ xed inhibi-
tors in the extracellular matrix. They act on the cell 
cycle clock (Box  2.1 ), most frequently arresting 
transit through G1 into S phase. Cancer cells ignore 
these stop signals. 
 The co - ordination of the cell cycle and its arrest 
at checkpoints in response to DNA damage is 
achieved by sequential activation of kinase 
enzymes that ultimately phosphorylate and 
dephosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). 
Periodic activation of these cyclin – cyclin - depend-
ent kinase (CDK) complexes drives the cell cycle 
 Box 2.1:   The cell cycle 
 There are ﬁ ve cell cycle phases: 
  ●    Quiescent phase (G0) : Normal cells grown in culture 
will stop proliferating once they become conﬂ uent or are 
deprived of growth factors, and enter a quiescent state 
called G0. Most cells in normal tissue of adults are in a G0 
state. 
  ●    First gap phase (G1)  (duration 10 – 14 hours): This 
occurs prior to DNA synthesis. Cells in G0 and G1 are 
receptive to growth signals but once they have passed a 
restriction point (R), are committed to DNA synthesis (S 
phase). 
  ●    Synthesis phase (S)  (duration 3 – 6 hours): During this 
phase DNA replication occurs and the cell becomes 
diploid. 
  ●    Second gap phase (G2)  (duration 2 – 4 hours): This 
occurs after DNA synthesis and before mitosis (M) and 
completion of the cell cycle.  
  ●    Mitosis (M)  (duration 1 hour).  
 Cell division completes the cell cycle.

forward (Figure  2.3 ). Phosphorylation of Rb 
releases E2F, a transcription factor which is then 
able to promote the expression of a number of 
target genes resulting in cell proliferation. The 
brakes that balance this system are CDK inhibitors 
(CKIs). Interference in elements of the cell cycle 
regulatory process is a common theme in malig-
nancy (see Table  2.2 ). 
 G1/S checkpoint 
 An important checkpoint or restriction point in 
the cell cycle occurs in G1 to ensure that errors in 
DNA are not replicated but instead are either 
repaired or that the cell dies by apoptosis. This is 
initiated by damaged DNA and is co - ordinated by 
p53, the gene that is probably most commonly 
mutated in cancers overall. Additional checkpoints 
are present in the S and G2 phases to allow cells to 
repair errors that occur during DNA duplication 
and thus prevent the propagation of these errors to 
daughter cells.  
 3.  Evasion of apoptosis 
 Apoptosis is a pre - programmed sequence of cell 
suicide that occurs over 30 – 120 minutes. Apopto-
sis commences with condensation of cellular 
organelles and swelling of the endoplasmic reticu-
lum. The plasma membrane remains intact but the 
cell breaks up into several membrane - bound apop-
totic bodies, which are phagocytosed. Conﬁ ning 
the process within the cell membrane reduces acti-
vation of both inﬂ ammatory and immune 
responses, so that programmed cell death does not 
cause autoimmune disease or inﬂ ammation. 
Amongst the molecules that control apoptosis are 
the Bcl - 2 family that confusingly includes both 
pro - apoptosis members (e.g. Bax) and anti - apopto-
sis members (e.g. Bcl - 2). 
 In mammalian cells two pathways initiate apop-
tosis (Figure  2.4 ): 
 1.  Intracellular triggers:    DNA damage leads 
via p53 to activation of pro - apoptotic members of 
the Bcl - 2 family. This causes release of cytochrome 
c from mitochondria, which in turn activates the 
caspase ( c leaves after  asp artate prote ase ) cascade.

 2.   Extracellular triggers:    Binding of extracel-
lular ligands to the cell surface death receptor 
superfamily (including CD95/Fas and tumour 
necrosis factor receptors) leads to a death - inducing 
cytoplasmic signalling complex that activates the 
caspase cascade.  
 Ultimately both pathways activate the caspase 
cascade, a series of protease enzymes that result in 
cell apoptosis. Evasion of this pathway is a prereq-
uisite for malignant cell proliferation and a number 
of strategies to this end have been identiﬁ ed (see 
Table  2.2 ). 
 4.  Immortalization 
 In culture, cells can divide a limited number of 
times, up to the  ‘ Hayﬂ ick limit ’ (60 – 70 doublings 
in the case of human cells in culture), before the 
cell population enters crisis and dies off. This 
senescence is attributed to progressive telomere 
loss, which acts as a mitotic clock (Figure  2.5 ). Tel-
omeres are the end segments of chromosomes and 
are made up of thousands of copies of a short 6 base 
pair sequence (TTAGGG). DNA replication always 
follows a 5 ′ to 3 ′ direction so that manufacturing 
the 3 ′ ends of the chromosomes cannot be achieved

 Figure 2.5   With every round of cell replication the chromosomes become shorter due to loss of the telomere repeats. 
Eventually this encroaches on the non - telomeric DNA of the chromosome and the cell enters crisis and dies. 
by DNA polymerases and each time a cell replicates 
its DNA ready for cell division, 50 – 100 base pairs 
are lost from the ends of chromosomes. Eventually 
the protective ends of chromosomes are eroded 
and end - to - end chromosomal fusions occur with 
karyotypic abnormalities and death of the affected 
cell. 
 Normal germ cells and cancer cells avoid this 
senescence, acquiring immortality in culture 
usually by upregulating the expression of human 
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) enzyme, 
which uses an RNA template and RNA - dependent 
DNA polymerase to add the 6 base pair sequence 
back onto the ends of chromosomes to compen-
sate for the bases lost during DNA replication (see 
Table  2.2 ). Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited 
condition, characterized by many abnormalities, 
including premature ageing and an increased risk 
of skin and gut cancers. It is due to mutations of 
components of the telomerase complex including 
the telomerase RNA and dyskerin.  
 5.  Angiogenesis 
 All tissues including cancers require a supply of 
oxygen and nutrients. For cancers to grow larger

than about 0.4  mm in diameter, a new blood 
supply is needed to deliver these. The growth of 
new blood vessels from pre - existing vasculature is 
termed angiogenesis. The  ‘ angiogenic switch ’ 
denotes the ability of tumours to recruit new blood 
vessels by producing growth factors and is neces-
sary for tumour growth and metastasis. Angiogen-
esis is determined by the relative balance of 
angiogenesis promoters and inhibitors (Table  2.1 ). 
 Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF - A to 
 - E) are a family of growth factor homodimers that 
act via one of three plasma membrane receptors 
(VEGFR - 1 to  - 3) on endothelial cells. Overproduc-
tion of VEGF and/or FGF (ﬁ brobast growth factor) 
is a common theme in many tumours (see Table 
 2.2 ). Angiogenesis may be measured microscopi-
cally as microvessel density in an area of tumour, 
or by assays of angiogenic factors. These measures 
are of prognostic signiﬁ cance in several human 
tumours. Angiogenesis is becoming a major focus 
of anticancer drug development. It is an attractive 
target for several reasons. Angiogenesis is a normal 
process in growth and development but is quies-
cent in adult life except during wound healing and 
menstruation, so side effects are predicted to be 
minimal. As the target will be normal endothelial 
cells without any genetic instability, there should 
be little capacity to acquire resistance. Each capil-
lary supplies a large number of tumour cells, so the 
effects should be magniﬁ ed in terms of tumour cell 
kill. Anti - angiogenic agents should have easy 
access to their target through the blood stream. In 
combination, these elements make anti - ang-
iogenic therapies attractive and several pharma-
ceutical companies have invested heavily in 
attempts to develop these agents. Bevacizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF; it was orig-
inally licensed for use in colon cancer and is also a 
valuable treatment for age - related macular degen-
eration, which is caused by retinal vessel 
proliferation. 
 6.  Invasion and metastasis 
 The properties of tissue invasion and metastatic 
spread are the histopathological hallmarks of 
malignant cancers that discriminate them from 
benign (see Plate  2.1 ). A number of sequential steps 
have been identiﬁ ed in the process of metastatic 
spread of cancers: 
 1.  Motility and invasion from the primary site.  
 2.  Embolism and circulation in lymph or blood.  
 3.  Arrest in a distant vascular or lymphatic capil-
lary and adherence to the endothelium.  
 4.  Extravasation 
into 
the 
target 
organ 
parenchyma. 
 Central to many of these steps is the role of cell –
 cell adhesion that controls the contact between 
cells, and cell – extracellular matrix connections 
that inﬂ uence the relationship between a cell and 
its environment. These interactions are regulated 
by cell adhesion molecules. Members of the cad-
herin and immunoglobulin superfamilies modu-
late cell – cell interactions whilst integrins control 
cell – extracellular matrix interactions. Alterations 
of cadherin, adhesion molecule and integrin 
expression are a common feature of metastatic 
cancer cells (see Table  2.2 ). 
 Tumours may migrate as single cells or as collec-
tions of cells. The former strategy is used by 
lymphoma and small cell lung cancer cells. It 
requires changes in integrins that mediate the 

Chapter 2 The scientiﬁ c basis of cancer
24
cell – extracellular matrix interaction and matrix -
 degrading proteases. Metastatic migration as 
clumps of cancer cells is common for most epithe-
lial tumours. In addition, this needs changes in 
cell – cell adhesion through cadherins and other 
adhesion receptors, as well as cell – cell communica-
tion via gap junctions.  
 How to acquire the six capabilities 
 Cancer is a somatic genetic disease caused by DNA 
mutations and epigenetic changes (Table  2.2 and 
 Box 2.2:   How cancers metastasize: routes 
and destinations 
 Routes of metastasis 
 Breast cancer cells that leave a primary tumour in blood 
vessels will be carried in the blood ﬁ rst through the heart 
and then to the capillary beds of the lungs. Some cancer 
cells might form metastases in the lung (Figure  2.6 ) 
whilst others pass through the lung to enter the systemic 
arterial system, where they are transported to remote 
organs, such as bone. By contrast, colon cancer cells will 
be taken by the hepatoportal circulatory system ﬁ rst to 
the liver. There is no direct ﬂ ow from the lymphatic 
system to other organs, so cancer cells within it  – for 
example, melanoma cells  – must enter the venous system 
to be transported to distant organs. Rarely, routes other 
than blood and lymphatic vessels are used in metastasis. 
Transcoelomic spread across the abdominal cavity occurs 
for gastric tumours that metastasize to the ovaries 
(known as Krukenberg tumours). Spread within the cer-
ebrospinal ﬂ uid is thought to be responsible for the 
metastasis of medulloblastoma up and down the spinal 
column. 
 Where cancers metastasise 
 Certain cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs 
and this cannot be accounted for by blood ﬂ ow alone. 
The basis for this tissue tropism has been found to relate 
to chemokine and chemokine receptor expression. 
Breast cancer cells express high levels of the CXCR4 
chemokine receptor. Lung tissue expresses high levels of 
a soluble ligand for the CXCR4 receptor. Therefore, 
breast cancer cells that are taken to the lung ﬁ nd a strong 
chemokine receptor  ‘ match ’ , which may lead to chem-
okine - mediated signal activation. By contrast, in other 
organs where breast cancers less commonly metastasize, 
there are low levels of the ligand.  
 Figure 2.6   Plain chest radiograph showing multiple 
rounded metastases of varying sizes in a man with a meta-
static testicular non - seminomatous germ cell tumour. 
Other tumours that commonly metastasize to the lungs 
include lung, breast, renal and thyroid cancers and 
sarcomas. 
Figure  2.7 ). A number of mechanisms are in place 
to prevent cells acquiring all six properties, includ-
ing efﬁ cient mechanisms to correct errors in DNA 
and to eradicate cells with extensive DNA damage. 
In fact, DNA mutation is facilitated in cancer cells 
by error - prone DNA replication (mutator pheno-
type), including deﬁ cient DNA repair leading to 
genetic instability, and uncoupling of the DNA 
damage cell cycle arrest/apoptosis response.  
 Genome instability 
 DNA damage or mutation will normally result in 
cell cycle arrest followed by DNA repair or apopto-
sis. Interference in this process may occur either by 
deﬁ cient DNA damage recognition and repair, or 
abnormal gatekeeping of the cell cycle arrest/apop-
tosis response. This will result in the uncorrected 
accumulation of a large number of genetic abnor-
malities, which is referred to as  ‘ genomic instabil-
ity ’ . It is thought that this allows cells to acquire

phenotype and physiology.  
 DNA repair 
 Environmental damage to DNA occurs commonly 
and eukoryotes have developed several techniques 
for repairing both double strand and single strand 
errors in DNA. 
 1.  Repair of double strand breaks in DNA:  
  ●    homologous recombination using the sister 
chromatid as a template  
  ●    non - homologous end joining (NHEJ).  
 2.  Repair of single strand mutations in DNA: 
  ●    nucleotide excision repair (NER) for bulky 
lesions 
  ●    mismatch repair (MMR) for single mispaired 
bases and short deletions  
  ●    base excision repair (BER) for alkylated bases.  
 Hereditary mutations of the enzymes involved 
in DNA repair will predispose to malignancy as 
they confer genome instability (Table  2.3 ). 
 DNA damage recognition 
 Another group of enzymes are required to recog-
nize damaged DNA, leading to cell cycle arrest to 
allow DNA repair to be completed before the 
damage is replicated and passed on to the progeny 
cells. A number of cancer - predisposing syndromes 
are associated with inherited mutations of these 
enzymes. Examples include p53, whose inactiva-
tion is an early step in the development of many 
cancers. Patients with the Li – Fraumeni syndrome 
carry one mutant germline p53 allele and are at 
high risk for the development of sarcomas, leukae-
mia and cancers of the breast, brain, and adrenal 
glands. 
 Epigenetic changes 
 Most of the discussion above about the molecular 
mechanisms of malignancy has described somatic 
and occasional germline mutations of DNA that 
lead to aberrant proteins that in turn contribute to 
oncogenesis. This argument follows the central 
dogma of molecular biology introduced by Francis 
Crick in the late 1950s that stated that information 
ﬂ ows in a unidirectional course from DNA 
sequence via RNA sequence to protein sequence. 
Although there are recognized exceptions to the 
central dogma, such as retroviruses and prions, it 
remains broadly true. However, some inheritable 
changes in phenotype or gene expression arise by 
mechanisms other than changes in the sequence 
of DNA bases. These inheritable changes passed on 
from a cell to her daughters are called epigenetic 
changes and perhaps the most obvious of these is 
cell differentiation. 
 The term epigenetics was introduced by the 
British developmental biologist Conrad Hal Wad-
dington in 1942 as a metaphor for cell differentia-
tion and development from a progenitor stem cell. 
Waddington likened differentiation to a marble

sor genes has been found to be a common mecha-
nism of epigenetic gene silencing in cancers.  
 Chromatin modiﬁ cation 
 Chromatin is composed of DNA and proteins, 
chieﬂ y the histone proteins around which the 
DNA is wound. There are six classes of histones 
organized into core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and 
H4) and linker histones (H1 and H5). The core his-
tones, which are highly conserved through nature, 
share N - terminal amino acid sequences that are 
the sites for post - transcriptional modiﬁ cation, for 
example acetylation and methylation. These 
histone modiﬁ cations alter the binding of the DNA 
to the nucleosome, and modify RNA polymerase 
activity and hence gene expression. In general, 
tightly bound DNA is less expressed. Numerous 
enzymes have been identiﬁ ed that are involved 
with the modiﬁ cation of histone protein leading to 
alterations of chromatin structure and regulation 
of gene expression. These include histone methyl-
transferase (HMT) and histone acetlytransferse 
(HAT); other enzymes catalyze the removal of 
these modiﬁ cations including histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) (Figure  2.9 ). Acetylation of histone tails 
reduces their binding afﬁ nity for DNA, allowing 
access for RNA polymerase and enhancing gene 
transcription. HDAC, therefore, by reversing 
histone tail residue acetylation suppresses gene 
expression, including tumour suppressor gene 
expression contributing to oncogenesis. A number 
rolling down a landscape of hills and valleys to 
reach a ﬁ nal destination. The destination (cell fate) 
was determined by the landscape (epigenetics) and 
the marble could not travel back to the top (termi-
nal differentiation). Today the term refers to modi-
ﬁ cation of DNA and chromatin that inﬂ uences 
gene transcription, alteration of post - transcrip-
tional RNA and ﬁ nally to protein degradation. 
 DNA methylation 
 Perhaps the most recognized epigenetic modiﬁ ca-
tion of DNA is nucleotide base methylation, typi-
cally the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine 
pyrimidine ring. In vertebrates, DNA methylation 
usually occurs in a CpG dinucleotide. Unmethyl-
ated CpGs are grouped in clusters called  ‘ CpG 
islands ’ that occur in the 5 ′ regulatory regions of 
many genes. DNA methylation of CpG islands 
inhibits gene transcription by impeding the 
binding of transcriptional proteins and by binding 
methyl - CpG - binding domain (MBDs) proteins. 
MBD proteins recruit additional proteins, such as 
histone deacetylases, that modify histones to form 
compact, inactive chromatin termed silent chro-
matin. Since epigenetic changes such as DNA 
methylation are inherited during cell replication, 
maintenance of the pattern of DNA methylation is 
required following each cycle of DNA replication 
and this is achieved by DNA methyltransferases 
using the conserved DNA strand as the template 
(Figure  2.8 ). DNA methylation of tumour suppres-

valproate and more recently vorinostat or suberoy-
lanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), which is licensed 
for the management of cutaneous T - cell non -
 Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma.  
 RNA interference 
 Post - translational interference of messenger RNA 
(mRNA) transcripts can also modify the expression 
of genes without altering the DNA sequence. Two 
types of small RNA molecules, microRNA (miRNA) 
and small interfering RNA (siRNA), can bind to spe-
ciﬁ c complementary sequences of RNA or DNA 
and either increase or decrease their activity, for 
example by preventing an mRNA from producing 
a protein (Figure  2.10 ). RNA interference was origi-
nally identiﬁ ed in petunia plants. Botantists 
attempting to produce darker and darker petunia 
ﬂ owers inserted additional genes of an enzyme 
that catalyzes pigment synthesis. However, the 
transgenic plants produced white or variegated 
white ﬂ owers and this was subsequently found to 
be due to post - transcriptional inhibition of gene 
expression brought about by rapid mRNA degrada-
tion. The eventual explanation of this gene silenc-
ing phenomenon was identiﬁ ed in  Caenorhabditis 
elegans  by Craig Mello and Andrew Fire in 1998 
who demonstrated that double stranded RNA 
caused the gene silencing. They called this RNAi 
(RNA interference) and won the Nobel Prize in 
2006 for this work. Both the role of RNAi in the 
epigenetic generation of cancers and the potential 
of RNAi as a therapeutic approach are the focus of 
fevered research.  
 Protein degradation 
 A further form of epigenetic modiﬁ cation that con-
tributes to the cellular phenotype is the destruc-
tion of proteins chieﬂ y by proteosomes. Proteins 
are tagged for degradation by a small protein called 
ubiquitin and this reaction is catalyzed by enzymes 
including the product of the gene disrupted in Von 
Hippel – Lindau syndrome and Fanconi ’ s anaemia. 
At least four ubiquitin molecules attach to the con-
demned protein, in a process called polyubiquiti-
nation, and the protein then moves to a 
proteasome, where the proteolysis occurs (Figure 
 2.11 ). Epigenetic regulation of protein degradation

Harold Varmus and Michael Bishop discovered 
that a homologous proto - oncogene (c - SRC) is 
present in the normal mammalian genome (the 
human  src locus is on chromosome 20q12 - q13) 
and has been hijacked by the retrovirus. The preﬁ x 
v - denotes a viral sequence and the preﬁ x c - a cel-
lular sequence. In 1956, 55 years after his discovery 
of RSV and at the age of 87, Peyton Rous was 
(ﬁ nally) awarded a Nobel Prize, whilst Bishop and 
Varmus only waited 10 years from their discovery 
to the award of their Nobel Prize in 1989. Around 
50 oncogenes have been identiﬁ ed by their pres-
ence in transforming retroviruses (e.g. erbB, H - RAS, 
JUN) and further oncogenes have been discovered 
by positional cloning of chromosomal transloca-
tions (e.g. Bcl - 2, BCR - ABL) and by transfection 
studies (e.g. N - RAS, RET). Most oncogenes contrib-
ute to cancer ’ s autonomy in growth factors, either 
as plasma membrane receptors (e.g. RET, PTCH), 
signal transduction pathways (e.g. PTEN, NF1 and 
2, VHL) or transcription factors (e.g. c - MYC, WT1) 
(Table  2.4 ). 
 Tumour suppressor genes 
 In contrast to oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes 
act as cell cycle brakes, slowing the proliferation of 
cells, and mutations in these genes also contribute 
to cancer. Germline mutations of tumour suppres-
sor genes behave as autosomal - dominant familial 
cancer predispositions. Tumour suppressor genes 
require the loss of both functional alleles to support 
a cancer (unlike oncogenes where one mutant 
allele sufﬁ ces). In 1971 Alfred Knudson proposed 
the two hit model of tumour suppression to 
account for the differences between familial and 
sporadic retinoblastoma in children. In familial 
cases, tumours arose at a younger age and were 
more frequently bilateral. Knudson hypothesized 
that these children had inherited one defective 
retinoblastoma gene allele, followed by loss of the 
function of the second allele in the cancer cells 
through a somatic mutation (see Plate  2.3 ). Tumour 
suppressor genes, like oncogenes, also involve a 
variety of functional categories, including cell 
cycle regulation (e.g. p53, Rb), DNA repair and 
maintenance (e.g. BRCA1 and 2, MLH1, MSH2), as 
could contribute to oncogenesis in a variety of 
ways. Gankyrin, a component of the proteosome is 
overexpressed in hepatocellular cancers. Borte-
zomib, a new treatment for myeloma, acts by 
inhibiting proteosome function.  
 Genetic causes of cancer 
 The causes of cancer may be usefully divided into 
genetic and environmental factors. The genetic 
factors are either germline mutations that are 
present in every cell of the body or somatic altera-
tions only found in the tumour cells. Germline 
mutations may be either inherited, in which case 
they follow a familial pattern, or may be new spo-
radic mutations that neither parent has. Some of 
the germline mutations have been outlined as 
mutator phenotypes (DNA repair and damage 
recognition genes) above. Other germline cancer -
 predisposing mutations occur in tumour suppres-
sor genes and oncogenes. 
 Oncogenes 
 The ﬁ rst clue to the identiﬁ cation of speciﬁ c genes 
involved in the development of cancer came from 
the study of tumour viruses. Although cancer is 
generally not an infectious disease, some animal 
leukaemias, lymphomas and solid tumours, par-
ticularly sarcomas, can be caused by viruses. Onco-
genes were identiﬁ ed following the discovery by 
Peyton Rous in 1911 that sarcomas could be 
induced in healthy chickens by injecting them 
with a cell - free extract of the tumour of a sick 
chicken. This was due to transmission of Rous 
sarcoma virus (RSV), an oncogenic retrovirus with 
just four genes: 
  ●    gag  (group - speciﬁ c antigen), which encodes the 
capsid protein  
  ●    pol (polymerase), which encodes the reverse 
transcriptase 
  ●    env (envelope), which encodes the envelope 
protein 
  ●    src , which encodes a tyrosine kinase.  
 It is the  src gene that is necessary for cell transfor-
mation and is therefore an oncogene  – literally a 
gene capable of causing cancer. In the late 1970s

 Environmental causes of cancer 
 The multitude of environmental factors that are 
associated with the development of malignancy 
may be usefully divided into: 
  ●    Physical (radiation)  
  ●    Chemical (chemical carcinogens)  
  ●    Biological (infections).  
 Radiation 
 The major physical carcinogen is radiation. Radia-
tion is ubiquitous and may either be ionizing (e.g. 
 γ - rays from cosmic radiation and isotope decay,  α -
 particles from radon, X - rays from medical imaging) 
or non - ionizing (e.g. ultraviolet (UV) light from 
the sun, microwave and radiofrequency radiation 
from mobile phones, electromagnetic ﬁ elds from 
electricity generators and pylons, ultrasound 
radiation from imaging). Ionizing radiation ejects

ated with higher cosmic radiation exposure. In 
addition, various regions have higher natural back-
ground levels from radon. Radon is a colourless, 
odourless gas formed from decay as part of the 
uranium - 238 series. The radon - 222 isotope, along 
with a number of its progeny, is an  α - particle 
emitter. Radon gas levels are normally quoted in 
Bq/m 3 (1 becquerel (Bq) is one decay per second) 
and the average indoor levels in the UK are about 
20   Bq/m 3 . Local geology (igneous granite) with 
high levels of uranium produces high levels of 
radon in soil gas, but for it to escape to the surface 
the soil must be highly porous. In the UK, radon 
levels are particularly high in Devon and Cornwall, 
Derbyshire and Northamptonshire. From the 
results of eight case – control studies, it is believed 
that radon exposure accounts for a small fraction 
of lung cancers with a 14% increased risk for a 
person living for 30 years in a house with levels of 
150   Bq/m 3 . 
 Nuclear warfare 
 Most of the information on the induction of 
cancers by ionizing radiation comes from exposed 
populations, including Japanese people exposed to 
atomic bombs at Hiroshima (Little Boy was a 
uranium - 235 - enriched bomb) and Nagasaki (Fat 
Man was a plutonium - 239 bomb). The estimated 
populations of the two cities at the time of bombing 
was 560  000 and approximately 200   000 people 
died within the ﬁ rst few months of the acute effects 
of blast, burns and radiation exposure (Table  2.5 ). 
electrons from atoms yielding an ion pair and 
requires 10 – 15   eV (electronvolts). Ionizing radia-
tion may be either electromagnetic (X - rays,  γ - rays) 
or particulate ( α - particles, neutrons). Non - ionizing 
radiation does not yield an ion pair but can still 
excite electrons resulting in chemical change. 
 Ultraviolet radiation 
 UV radiation is subdivided into three wavelength 
bands: 
  ●    UVA (313 – 400   nm) 
  ●    UVB (290 – 315   nm) 
  ●    UVC (220 – 290   nm). 
 UVC has the most potent effects on DNA, which 
absorbs most strongly at 254   nm. However, UVC is 
quickly absorbed in air and hence UVB is consid-
ered to be the greater environmental hazard. Most 
UV radiation is absorbed by atmospheric ozone in 
the stratosphere and this ozone layer is being 
depleted in part due to chlorine in chloroﬂ uorocar-
bons (CFCs), resulting in increasing UV exposure 
levels. One of the major lesions induced in DNA by 
UV radiation is the thymidine dimer, a covalent 
bonding of adjacent thymidine residues on the 
same DNA strand. This causes local distortion of 
the double helix which is repaired by the nucle-
otide excision repair (NER) pathway. The seven 
identiﬁ ed xeroderma pigmentosa genes encode 
essential components that undertake NER and 
hence xeroderma pigmentosa predisposes to UV -
 induced skin malignancies. Melanin pigment in 
the skin normally absorbs UV radiation, thus pro-
tecting the skin. Basal cell and squamous cell skin 
cancers increase with cumulative UV exposure, 
whilst the relationship is less straightforward for 
melanoma. The evidence for an association with 
cancer for other forms of non - ionizing radiation 
(microwave, radiofrequency, ultrasound and elec-
tromagnetic radiation) is weak and inconsistent.

 Exposure to natural sources of ionizing radiation 
varies in different populations. Higher altitude and 
further latitude from the equator are both associ-

 Box 2.3:   Chernobyl 
 On 26 April 1986, nuclear reactor number 4 at Cherno-
byl exploded in the world ’ s worst nuclear accident. Over 
10 19  Bq of radioactive isotopes were released, including 
5.2    ×  10 18  Bq of  β - emitting isotopes of iodine that con-
centrate in the thyroid gland. An increase in thyroid 
cancer in children was ﬁ rst reported in 1990 but an 
excess of other tumours has not (yet?) been reported. 
Fallout from Chernobyl affected millions of people living 
within a few hundred kilometres of the reactor and 
caused a 30 – 100 - fold increase in the incidence of thyroid 
cancer, especially in children. The younger the child at 
exposure, the greater the risk is. The increase so far is 
almost entirely papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and the 
dominant subtype has solid papillary morphology. At a 
molecular level, these tumours show rearrangement of 
the RET oncogene by inversion or translocation with 
partner genes to yield constitutively active c - RET tyrosine 
kinases. 
The Radiation Effects Research Foundation has fol-
lowed 86   000 survivors or hibakusha, and, up to 
1990, 7827 had died of cancer. The excess risk of 
leukaemia was seen especially in those exposed as 
children and was highest during the ﬁ rst 10 years 
after the bombing. However, the excess risk of 
solid tumours occurred later and still persists 
(Table  2.6 ). 
 Medical radiation 
 The hazards of medical ionizing radiation may be 
difﬁ cult to determine as ionizing radiation -
 induced tumours are not identiﬁ able by a particu-
lar signature DNA mutation (unlike the thymidine 
dimers induced by UV radiation). Some tissues, 
such as breast, thyroid and bone marrow, are more 
susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing 
radiation, although tumours have been described 
in every organ site following radiation exposure

after radiotherapy for arthritis (no longer used). This radio-
graph shows cortical destruction, a soft tissue mass with 
internal calciﬁ cation and periosteal reaction.  
(Figure  2.12 ). Well - described examples of iatro-
genic tumours include acute leukaemias induced 
by radiation treatment for ankylosing spondylitis 
prescribed in the late 1930s in the UK. Similarly, 
20   000 Israelis received radiation for  Tinea capitis 
(ringworm) in the 1950s, and by the 1980s there 
was a signiﬁ cantly increased risk of meningioma. 
Similar increases in tumours have been observed in 
patients treated with radiotherapy, including men 
treated for prostate cancer, women treated for cer-
vical cancers and Hodgkin ’ s disease survivors. 
Diagnostic imaging radiation doses are shown in 
Table  2.7 . 
 Occupational radiation 
 The ﬁ rst victims of occupational exposure to radia-
tion included Marie Curie and her daughter Ir è ne 
Joliot - Curie (also a Nobel laureate), who both died 
of leukaemia. In the 1920s, watch dials were 
hand painted with radium - based luminous paint. 
The female radium dial painters often licked their 
paint brushes to give them a sharp point and

 Box 2.4:   Units of radiotherapy 
 The becquerel (Bq) is the SI unit of radioactivity and 1   Bq 
is equivalent to one nuclear decay per second. It is named 
after Henri Becquerel who shared the Nobel Prize with 
Marie and Pierre Curie for the discovery of radioactivity. 
The Hiroshima bomb produced 8    ×  10 24  Bq. 
 The gray (Gy) is the SI unit of absorbed radiation dose 
for ionizing radiation. One gray is the absorption of 1 
joule (J) of ionizing radiation by 1   kg of matter, usually 
human tissue. It is named after Hal Gray, a British pioneer 
of radiation biology and physics who also established the 
Gray Laboratories at Mount Vernon Hospital. 
 The sievert (Sv) is the SI unit of radioactive dose equiva-
lence and reﬂ ects the biological effects in tissue of radia-
tion rather than its physical attributes. The equivalent 
dose will depend on the absorbed dose (measured in 
grays) as well as the type of radiation, as well as the time 
and volume and part of body irradiated. It is named after 
Rolf Sievert, a Swedish medical physicist. A dose of 3   Sv 
will lead to a lethal dose (LD) 50/30, or death in 50% of 
cases within 30 days, and over 6   Sv survival is very

ingested the radium. Up to 3% of these women 
subsequently developed osteosarcomas after a 
latency of 5 – 10 years. These  ‘ radium girls ’ success-
fully sued their employer and this litigation 
resulted in the introduction of industrial safety 
standards and health and safety regulations at 
work. Similarly, pitchblende (uranium oxide) and 
uranium miners in Czechoslovakia, Sweden, New-
foundland and Colorado who have been exposed 
to radon are at increased risk of lung cancers.  
 Chemical carcinogenesis 
 Cancer is essentially a genetic disease arising from 
mutations of genes that affect the control of 
normal cell function (proto - oncogenes and 
tumour suppressor genes) or from polymorphic 
genes that govern enzyme systems that activate or 
detoxify environmental carcinogens (phase I and 
phase II enzyme reactions). Carcinogenic muta-
tions can arise in several ways: genotoxic environ-
mental factors (e.g. radiation and many chemical 
carcinogens), spontaneous DNA aberrations occur-
ring during normal cell replication, or hereditary 
germline mutations. Chemical carcinogenesis was 
shown to be a multistep process following studies 
in the 1940s using PAHs (polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons) and a murine skin cancer model 
system. This identiﬁ ed three steps  – initiation, pro-
motion and progression  – that involve separate 
biological processes. Chemical carcinogens may 
operate at any or all three stages. The minority of 
chemical carcinogens act directly on DNA (e.g. 
alkylating agents), whilst the majority are pro - 
carcinogens that require metabolic activation to 
the ultimate carcinogen forms. Many ultimate 
carcinogens are potent electrophiles, capable of 
accepting electrons (e.g. epoxides derived from 
polycyclic hydrocarbons, vinyl chloride and aﬂ a-
toxins, the  N - hydroxylated metabolites of azo 
dyes, and the alkyldiazonium ions derived from 
nitrosamines). 
 Initiation 
 The key feature of initiation is the need for cell rep-
lication without repair of the chemically induced 
DNA damage. Initiation is irreversible, usually 
involves simple DNA mutations that are  ‘ ﬁ xed ’ by 
cell division, and results in no morphological 
changes to the cells. Single exposure to a carcino-
gen may be sufﬁ cient for initiation. For example, 
aﬂ atoxin B1 is one of a family of mycotoxin con-
taminants of food crops such as grain and ground-
nuts (peanuts). It is produced by  Aspergillus ﬂ avus , 
which favours hot and humid conditions and is 
therefore most likely to contaminate food in Africa 
and Asia. Aﬂ atoxin B1 is oxidized by hepatic P450 

The scientiﬁ c basis of cancer Chapter 2

these genetic changes, progression leads to hetero-
geneity of the cell population. Ultimately some 
cells will acquire a mutator phenotype and the six 
genetic attributes that characterize a cancer cell.  
 Diet and cancer 
 A role for dietary constituents has been described 
for a number of cancers and the evidence for some 
of these relationships is more robust than for 
others. Alcohol intake has been convincingly asso-
ciated with an increased risk of oral, oesophageal 
and hepatic cancers. In contrast, dietary fat was 
believed to play an important role in breast cancer 
development based on animal studies, migrant 
studies and a few case – control trials. This led to 
great enthusiasm for reduced dietary fat intake to 
reduce the incidence of breast cancer. However, 
results from large prospective studies have failed to 
conﬁ rm a strong relationship between dietary fat 
intake and breast cancer. Two paths may contrib-
ute to dietary carcinogenesis. Firstly, foodstuffs 
may include dietary genotoxins formed by con-
taminating moulds, products of storage or fermen-
tation of food, products of cooking and food 
additives (e.g. aﬂ atoxin contamination of food). 
Secondly, endogenous genotoxins, such as reactive 
oxygen species, may be formed and higher caloriﬁ c 
intake may yield more genotoxins.  
 Carcinogenic infections 
 The association between infection and cancer is 
usually attributed to Peyton Rous, who described 
the acellular transmission of sarcoma between 
chickens in 1911. However, six years earlier, 
Goebel had reported a link between bladder 
tumours and bilharzia (schistosomiasis). It is esti-
mated that 15% of cancers globally are attributable 
to infections (11% viruses, 4% bacteria and 0.1% 
helminths) (Table  2.8 ). 
 Oncogenic human DNA viruses 
 Human papillomavirus (HPV) 
 The papillomaviruses are non - enveloped, icosahe-
dral, double stranded DNA viruses. Around 100 
microsomal enzymes into aﬂ atoxin B1 2,3 -
 epoxide, which binds to DNA bases forming muta-
genic adducts that preferentially induce GC to TA 
transversions. These transversions have been iden-
tiﬁ ed frequently in codon 249 of the p53 gene in 
hepatocellular carcinomas in patients from south-
ern Africa and China who are exposed to high 
levels of aﬂ atoxin B1 and may also have hepatitis B 
virus infection.  
 Promotion 
 Promotion is a reversible process requiring multi-
ple exposures to the carcinogen, usually with a 
dose – response threshold. Promotion does not 
usually involve DNA mutations (non - genotoxic 
carcinogenesis) but provides a chemically medi-
ated selective growth advantage. Thus, promotion 
results in the clonal expansion of cells. In the 
1940s it was noted that 5% of mice treated with 
penzpyrene developed tumours but this ﬁ gure rose 
to 80% when croton oil was added. Croton oil 
alone, however, produced no tumours. Subse-
quently, it was found that tetradecanoylphorbol 
acetate (TPA), a natural component of croton oil 
(from the seeds of  Croton tiglium , a tree cultivated 
in India that resemble castor seeds), interacts with 
the protein kinase c signal pathway, stimulating 
growth and thus acting as a promoter. TPA is the 
most widely used tumour promoter in cellular 
experimental models of oncogenesis. Similarly, 
oestrogens are believed to act as carcinogenic pro-
moters. Indeed, transplacental diethylstilboestrol 
(DES) was shown to induce vaginal clear cell aden-
ocarcinomas in young women whose mothers had 
been treated with DES during pregnancy.  
 Progression 
 Progression is an irreversible step that results in 
morphologically identiﬁ able cellular changes and 
frequently involves multiple complex DNA 
changes, such as chromosomal alterations. Pro-
gression and the accumulation of multiple genetic 
abnormalities that characterize cancer cells may 
occur spontaneously or may be driven by chemical 
carcinogens. Since individual cells may acquire

 Box 2.5:   A brief epidemiological history of smoking and cancer 
 Tobacco was one of the  ‘ gifts ’ from the New World to the Old along with syphilis and potatoes. Nicotine is named after 
Jean Nicot, a 15th century French ambassador to Lisbon, who was a great advocate of smoking and who in 1559 sent 
tobacco to Catherine de Medici, the then Queen of France. Tobacco was subsequently introduced to England by Sir 
Walter Raleigh in 1586. Smoking was actively encouraged amongst soldiers in the Thirty Years War, Napoleonic cam-
paigns, Crimean War and, most notably, the First World War. Smoking reduces fear and anxiety and suppresses appetite 
and these were deemed beneﬁ cial to soldiers.  
 Early epidemiological links with non - lung cancers 
 In 1761, John Hill, a London doctor, wrote up several cases of nasal cancer amongst heavy tobacco snuff users and, in 
1795, Thomas van Soemmering suggested a link between pipe smoking and lip cancer. The American Civil War Yankee 
general and later USA president, Ulysses S. Grant died in 1885 of throat cancer and this was attributed to his cigars. In 
an early cohort study in the 1920s, Dr R. Abbe observed that, of 90 patients with oral cancer, 89 were smokers.  
 Epidemiological links with lung cancer 
 In 1939, Dr Franz Muller of the University of Cologne performed what is generally recognized as the earliest case – control 
study of smoking, which showed that a very high proportion of lung cancer patients were heavy smokers. However, the 
results were dismissed as unreliable because Hitler was a fanatical antismoker. Shortly after the Second World War, 
Austin Bradford Hill, Edward Kennaway, Percy Stock and Richard Doll set out to investigate links between smoking and 
lung cancer, at a time when 90% of adult males in the UK smoked, using a case – control dose – response strategy. Their 
case – control study was performed in 1948 in 20 London hospitals, interviewing two controls with gastric or colonic 
cancer as controls for each lung cancer patient. In all analyses, there was a dose – response relationship between the 
number of cigarettes smoked and the risk of lung cancer. This was published in 1950 in the  British Medical Journal . 
 In 1951, Doll and Hill set up a prospective cohort study of 60   000 doctors on the medical register who were recruited 
via a letter in the  BMJ ; 40   000 replies were received and, in the following 2.5 years, there were 789 deaths, including 36 
from lung cancer. There was a signiﬁ cant increase in the risk of lung cancer with increased tobacco consumption (see 
table below). However, they noted that the only two doctors who deﬁ nitely died of smoking had died after setting ﬁ re 
to their beds whilst smoking in bed! This relationship was maintained in a 1993 update of the original cohort, which now 
includes 20   000 deaths (883 from lung cancer), and the relative risk for smoking  > 25   g tobacco a day was 20 - fold. 
 
 Similar ﬁ ndings were reported in the early 1950s in the USA by Ernst Wynder, a medical student, and Evarts Graham, 
a thoracic surgeon, who, in 1950, published  ‘ Tobacco smoking as a possible etiologic factor in bronchiogenic carcinoma: 
a study of 684 proven cases ’ in the  Journal of the American Medical Association . Evarts, a chain smoker, did not take 
enough heed of his own ﬁ ndings and himself died of lung cancer.

associated with benign lesions, such as warts (e.g. 
HPV - 6 and  - 11), whilst others are known as high -
 risk genotypes and are associated with invasive 
cancer (e.g. HPV - 16,  - 18,  - 31,  - 33,  - 45,  - 51,  - 52,  - 58 
and  - 59) (Table  2.9 ). The prevalence of infection 
varies between populations but is 20 – 30% in 
women aged 20 – 25 years and declines to 5 – 10% in 
women over 40 years old. HPV is sexually transmit-
ted and the main determinant of infection is the 
number of sexual partners. Most infections are 
cleared spontaneously but a small proportion 
persist and are believed to be the origin of cervical 
dysplasia and invasive cancers. Latent infection is 
associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia

(CIN), which is graded 1 to 3 according to the 
severity of cytological changes. The histological 
equivalents of these lesions are called squamous 
intraepithelial lesions, which may be low or high 
grade. Over 99% of invasive cervical cancers have 
detectable HPV DNA present and HPV can trans-
form cells in culture. The molecular basis of papil-
lomavirus - induced neoplasia is attributed to two 
viral oncogenes, E6 and E7. HPV E6 inactivates p53 
and E7 degrades Rb protein. High - risk HPV geno-
types have also been associated with anal, penile, 
vaginal and vulval cancers. In addition HPV is 
thought to play a role in the development of a 
number of other malignancies, including head and 
neck cancers, conjunctival squamous cancers, 
oesophageal cancers and possibly cutaneous squa-
mous cell cancers. 
 Studies have suggested that the detection of HPV 
in the cervix may be more sensitive for detecting 
CIN than conventional cytological screening. Pro-
phylactic HPV vaccines that induce neutralizing 
antibodies may prevent infection and the associ-
ated malignancies. Most of the vaccines have used 
virus - like particles constructed of major capsid 
proteins without viral DNA or enzymes present. A 
nationwide HPV vaccination programme for 
teenage girls was started in UK in 2008.  
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
 Hepatitis B virus is a double stranded DNA virus 
that includes a single stranded DNA region of vari-
able length. The virus possesses a DNA - dependent 
DNA polymerase as well as a reverse transcriptase 
and replicates via an RNA intermediate. HBV has 
three main antigens: the  ‘ Australian antigen ’ is

 herpesvirus. It was ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed by Epstein and 
his colleagues by electron microscopy of a cell line 
derived from a patient with Burkitt lymphoma in 
1964. Burkitt lymphoma had been described only 
a few years earlier in 1956 by Dennis Burkitt, a 
surgeon working in Uganda. The subsequent 
ﬁ nding that EBV was the cause of infectious mono-
nucleosis arose serendipitously when a laboratory 
technician in Philadelphia developed mononucle-
osis and was found to have acquired antibodies to 
EBV. EBV infects over 90% of the world ’ s popula-
tion, is transmitted orally and, in normal adults, 
from 1 to 50 B lymphocytes per million are infected 
by latent EBV. A carcinogenic role for EBV has been 
conﬁ rmed for several types of lymphoma (Burkitt 
lymphoma, Hodgkin ’ s disease and immunosup-
pression - associated non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma) 
and nasopharyngeal cancer (Table  2.11 ). EBV is 
estimated to be responsible for 100   000 cancers per 
year in the world.  
associated with the surface (HBsAg), the  ‘ core 
antigen ’  (HBcAg) is internal, and the  ‘ e antigen ’ 
(HBeAg) is part of the same capsid polypeptide as 
HBcAg. All of these antigens elicit speciﬁ c antibod-
ies and are used diagnostically (Table  2.10 ). 
 Hepatitis B is one of the most common infec-
tions worldwide with two billion people having 
been infected and 300 – 350 million chronic carri-
ers. Hepatitis B is the ninth most common cause of 
death worldwide. Acute hepatitis B infection may 
be associated with extrahepatic immune - mediated 
manifestations and 1 – 4% of patients develop a ful-
minant form. Following acute infection, up to 10% 
will develop chronic hepatitis, either chronic per-
sistent hepatitis, which is asymptomatic with 
modest elevation of transaminases and little ﬁ bro-
sis, or chronic active hepatitis, which causes jaun-
dice and cirrhosis and is associated with a 100 × 
increased risk of hepatocellular cancer 15 – 60 years 
after infection. It is uncertain how hepatitis B leads 
to cancer, although the X protein of hepatitis B 
may interact with p53 causing disruption of the 
cell cycle control, or the virus may act indirectly by 
causing increased hepatic cell turnover associated 
with cirrhosis. 
 Although treatment with  α - interferon and anti-
viral agents (e.g. lamivudine, tenofovir, telbivu-
dine, entecavir, adefovir) may lead to clearance of 
hepatitis B in chronic infection, recombinant 
subunit vaccines have been available since the 
early 1980s. The introduction of a mass immuniza-
tion programme in Taiwan has been associated 
with a dramatic reduction in liver cancer in 
children.

 Primary infection of epithelial cells by EBV is 
associated with the infection of some resting B 
lymphocytes. The majority of infected B cells have 
latent virus with a small percentage undergoing 
spontaneous activation to lytic infection. During 
lytic infection EBV replicates in the cell and when 
the progeny virions are released the host cell is 
destroyed. In contrast, during latent infection 
there is neither virus replication nor host cell 
destruction. Most infected B lymphocytes have 
latent virus expressing at most ten of the  > 80 genes 
of EBV. The roles of these latent genes include 
maintenance of the episomal virus DNA, growth 
and transformation of B cells and evasion of the 
host immune system. A number of these latent 
genes are thought to contribute to the oncogenic-
ity of EBV. For example LMP - 1 (latent membrane 
protein 1) mimics a constitutively activated recep-
tor for tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and BHRF1 
and BALF1 are viral homologues of the anti - apop-
totic protein bcl - 2 that leads to evasion of pro-
grammed cell death. Thus, in contrast to 
retroviruses, which generally possess a single onco-
gene, EBV uses a number of genes that contribute 
to the steps towards cancer.  
 Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV - 8/KSHV) 
 Kaposi ’ s sarcoma (KS) was originally described over 
a century ago and four forms have subsequently 
been recognized. The ﬁ rst is classic KS and is usually 
found on the lower legs of elderly men of Mediter-
ranean or Jewish descent without any immuno-
suppression. A second form, endemic or African 
KS, is found in all age groups in sub - Saharan Africa, 
where even before the HIV epidemic it was as 
common as colorectal cancer is in Europe. A third 
form associated with iatrogenic immunosuppres-
sion was recognized in patients who had received 
an allogeneic organ transplant. The fourth and 
most common form of the disease is associated 
with AIDS (acquired immune deﬁ ciency syn-
drome). All forms of KS are associated with HHV - 8 
(also known as Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, KSHV), 
which was identiﬁ ed in 1994. In addition, this 
virus is most prevalent in the populations at risk of 
KS. HHV - 8 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of 
two rare lymphoproliferative diseases, primary 
effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman ’ s 
disease (see Plate  2.4 ). Like EBV, HHV - 8 includes a 
number of cellular gene homologues that are 
thought to contribute to its oncogenic potential.  
 Oncogenic human RNA viruses 
 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
 Hepatitis C virus was identiﬁ ed in 1989 as the 
cause of transfusion - acquired non - A non - B hepati-
tis by Houghton, Choo and Kuo. HCV is a single 
stranded RNA virus belonging to the ﬂ avivirus 
genus along with yellow fever and dengue. The 
prevalence of HCV varies geographically from 
1 – 1.5% in Europe and the USA to 3.5% in Africa, 
and transmission is chieﬂ y parenteral, particularly 
by blood transfusion prior to the introduction of 
blood product screening. In contrast to HBV, 85% 
develop persistent HCV and 65% progress to 
chronic liver disease including hepatocellular 
cancer for which the relative risk is 20 - fold (Table 
 2.12 ). The oncogenic mechanism for HCV remains 
unclear. Unlike retroviruses, there is no evidence of 
genome integration but cancer is preceded by cir-
rhosis and it is hypothesized that the virus induces

a cycle of inﬂ ammation, repair and regeneration 
and thus indirectly contributes to the formation of 
cancer. There are at least six genotypes of HCV and 
the diagnosis is usually made by enzyme immu-
noassay for anti - HCV antibodies and conﬁ rmed by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HCV RNA. 
Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavarin 
leads to clearance of the virus in 40 – 60% depend-
ing in part upon the HCV genotype. Promising spe-
ciﬁ c protease and polymerase inhibitors are in late 
phase trials for HCV.  
 Human T - cell leukaemia virus type 1 
(HTLV - 1) 
 HTLV - 1 is the main cause of adult T - cell leukaemia/
lymphoma, a malignancy characterized by hyper-
calcaemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomeg-
aly and myelosuppression. It is associated with a 
particularly poor prognosis and occurs almost 
exclusively in areas where HTLV - 1 is endemic, such 
as the Caribbean, Japan and West Africa or in 
immigrants from these regions and their offspring. 
HTLV - 1 is also associated with tropical spastic para-
paresis and uveitis. HTLV - 1 is an enveloped retrovi-
rus that integrates into the host cellular genome. 
The virus is able to immortalize human T lym-
phocytes and this property is attributable to a spe-
ciﬁ c viral oncogene,  tax . Tax is a trans - activating 
transcription factor that can also lead to repression 
of transcription. Adult T - cell leukaemia/lymphoma 
develops in 2 – 5% of HTLV - 1 infected people and is 
commoner in those infected at a younger age.  
 Oncogenic bacteria 
 Helicobacter pylori 
 Helicobacter pylori  is a spiral, ﬂ agellated, Gram - neg-
ative bacteria that colonizes the human gastroin-
testinal tract. It causes gastritis leading to peptic 
ulceration, although many infections are asympto-
matic. The discovery of  H. pylori  and the recogni-
tion of its place in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer 
disease are chieﬂ y due to Barry Marshall, who, in 
order to prove his point, swallowed a solution of 
the organism and developed acute gastritis 1 week 
later. It is believed that half of the world popula-
tion is chronically infected with  H. pylori . Prospec-
tive sero - epidemiological data suggest that  H. pylori 
infection is associated with a two to four - fold 
increase in the risk of gastric cancer as well as an 
increase in gastric low - grade mucosa - associated 
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. As with the 
hepatitis viruses, the mechanism of oncogenesis 
is obscure but is believed to be an indirect result 
of chronic inﬂ ammation and consequential epi-
thelial cell proliferation. The combination of 
two antibiotics with either a bismuth preparation 
or a proton pump inhibitor for 14 days eradicates 
 H. pylori  in 80% patients. However, re - infection is 
common,  H. pylori is very prevalent and the time 
interval between  H. pylori  infection and gastric 
cancer is thought to be several decades. For these 
reasons, it may prove very difﬁ cult to assess the 
value of eradication interventions in reducing 
cancer risk.  
 Oncogenic helminths 
 Schistosomes 
 Schistosomes are parasitic blood ﬂ ukes or ﬂ at-
worms (platyhelminths) belonging to the trema-
tode class whose intermediate hosts are snails. 
Three species infect humans:  Schistosoma haemato-
bium , 
 Schistosoma 
mansoni  
and 
 Schistosoma 
japonica . Humans are infected by contact with 
fresh water where the parasite cercaria form pene-
trates the skin. It is estimated that 200 million 
people are infected with schistosomes (Table  2.13 ). 
Acute infection may produce swimmer ’ s itch der-
matitis and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, 
although most people remain asymptomatic. The 
development of adult worms, days to weeks after 
infection, may cause Katayama fever, a systemic 
illness of fevers, rigors, myalgia, lymphadenopathy 
and hepatosplenomegaly. Chronic infection leads 
to granuloma formation at sites of egg deposition, 
in the bladder for  S. haematobium  and in the bowel 
and liver for  S. mansoni  and  S. japonica . The late 
sequelae include squamous cell carcinoma of the 
bladder in the case of  S. haematobium  and probably 
hepatocellular cancer with  S. japonica . A single oral 
dose of praziquantel resolves the infection.

 Liver ﬂ ukes 
 Three species of food - borne liver ﬂ ukes of the trem-
atode class cause illness in humans. Infection is 
acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater 
ﬁ sh and the ﬂ ukes migrate to the biliary tree and 
mature in the intrahepatic bile ducts. There are two 
intermediate hosts in the life cycle  – snails and ﬁ sh. 
As many as 17 million people are estimated to be 
infected (Table  2.14 ). Cholangiocarcinoma has 
been recognized as a complication of chronic 
infection and case – control studies have found a 
ﬁ ve - fold increased risk with liver ﬂ uke infection. 
The oncogenic mechanism is again unclear 
although chronic inﬂ ammation is believed to play 
a role. The antihelminth drug praziquantel is the 
treatment of choice.  
 Worldwide contributions to cancer 
 The current world population is six billion and the 
global burden of cancer is estimated to be 10 
million new cases and six million deaths annually. 
Projections for 2020, when the global population 
is estimated to have risen to eight billion, are 20 
million new cases and 12 million deaths annually. 
Tobacco contributes to three million cases of 
cancer (chieﬂ y lung, head and neck, bladder), diet 
to an estimated three million cases (upper gastroin-
testinal, colorectal) and infection to a further 1.5 
million cases (cervical, stomach, liver, bladder and 
lymphomas) globally. Prevention by tobacco 
control, dietary advice and affordable food, and 
infection control and immunization could have a 
major impact in reducing the global burden of 
cancer. The differences in outcome for tumours 
between the developed and the developing worlds 
are most marked for the rare but curable cancers 
where access to therapy dramatically improves sur-
vival (e.g. acute leukaemias, Hodgkin ’ s disease and 
testicular cancers). Small differences are recorded 
where screening programmes aimed at early detec-
tion are effective (e.g. cervical and breast cancers), 
whilst there are little differences in outcome in 
the common tumours where prevention has a 
major role (e.g. lung, stomach and liver cancers). 
These observations have led to a World Health

 Chapter 3 
The  p rinciples of  c ancer  t reatment 
 Appropriate  c are 
 The care of people with cancer requires careful 
deliberation and consultation with the patient. 
The appropriate care will depend upon the progno-
sis, the effectiveness and toxicity of any therapy, 
and ﬁ nally, most importantly, on the patient ’ s 
wishes. To empower patients to participate in this 
decision - making process requires them to be fully 
informed and the clear delivery of this information 
is essential. A number of resources are available to 
supplement the information divulged by clini-
cians to their patients. These include a number of 
web - based resources as well as patient information 
leaﬂ ets published by charities including Macmil-
lan Cancerbackup and individual tumour - type 
patient groups such as Breast Cancer Breakthrough. 
It is increasingly appreciated that the management 
of patients with cancer requires a multidisciplinary 
approach involving a team of professionals includ-
ing surgeons, clinical and medical oncologists, 
palliative 
care 
physicians, 
radiologists, 
his-
topathologists, specialist oncology and palliative 
care nurses, clinical psychologists, counsellors, 
dieticians, occupational therapists, physiothera-
pists, social workers and clinical geneticists. 
 The aims of therapy should be clearly identiﬁ ed 
before embarking on a course of treatment. Treat-
ment may either be curative, aiming to prolong the 
quantity of life, or palliative, aiming to improve 
the quality of life. When considering the manage-
ment of individual tumour types, the maxim that 
prevention is better than cure should be recalled. 
Cancer prevention and screening are essential if 
the global burden of malignancy is to be 
minimized. 
 During the last quarter of the 20th century, the 
role of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine 
therapy after primary surgery for localized breast 
cancer was recognized. These additional treat-
ments are deﬁ ned as adjuvant therapies. Thus 
adjuvant therapy is treatment after the primary 
tumour has been removed surgically and in the 
absence of detectable residual disease. Whilst large 
clinical trials demonstrated the advantages of adju-
vant therapy to a population of women with breast 
cancer, the beneﬁ ts for an individual woman are 
not measurable. In part for this reason and with a 
view to facilitating surgery, oncologists developed 
neoadjuvant treatments. Neoadjuvant therapy, 
usually chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, is 
delivered prior to surgery or radiotherapy to down-
size the tumour, thus demonstrating the sensitiv-
ity of the tumour and potentially reducing the 
extent of the surgical resection or radiation ﬁ eld.

 Surgical oncology is the oldest discipline for the 
management of cancer and originates with 
attempts at curative resections. Surgical oncology 
enjoyed a golden era at the end of the 19th century 
and early 20th century prior to the First World War 
(Table  3.1 ). Subsequent advances in surgical oncol-
ogy included the development of endocrine 
surgery for metastatic disease. Surgical hormone 
ablation was pioneered by George Beatson, a Glas-
wegian surgeon who gave his name to Scotland ’ s 
largest cancer centre for the management of breast 
cancer over 100 years ago (Table  3.2 ).

 Surgical  c ancer  p rophylaxis 
 The prevention of cancer by surgery has expanded 
greatly in recent years with the identiﬁ cation of 
individuals at high risk of developing malignancies 
because they have inherited germline genetic 
mutations associated with cancer predisposition. 
However, perhaps the most widespread example of 
surgical cancer prevention is the role of orchiopexy 
in the management of undescended testes. Unde-
scended testes are the most common birth defect 
of the male genitalia, affecting up to 3% of live 
births. Although in many cases the testes will 
descend to the scrotum during the ﬁ rst year of life, 
undescended testes are associated with a 4 – 40 - fold 
increased risk of malignancy, especially testicular 
seminoma. Orchiopexy, surgey to move the unde-
scended testis into the scrotum, has been shown to 
reduce infertility although it remains controversial 
whether it also reduces the risk of malignancy. 
Nevertheless, it certainly makes the detection of 
testicular tumours easier to recognize and diagnose 
at an earlier stage. Familial adenomatous polyposis 
(FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder charac-
terized by the development of multiple polyps in 
the colon which may undergo transformation to 
malignant tumours. Most patients with FAP will 
develop a colonic cancer by the age of 40 years old, 
so prophylactic colectomy is generally recom-
mended before the age of 25 years. Similarly, risk -
 reducing 
prophylactic 
mastectomy 
may 
be 
advocated for women with inherited mutations of 
BRCA genes (Table  3.3 ). 

The principles of cancer treatment Chapter 3

 Surgical  d iagnosis and  s taging of  c ancer 
 Oncological diagnosis hinges on histopathology, 
and surgeons play a major role along with inter-
ventional radiologists in obtaining tissue speci-
mens. Whilst aspiration cytology and ﬁ ne - needle 
biopsies can be undertaken radiologically or endo-
scopically, more extensive incision or excision 
biopsies require surgical involvement. Careful 
specimen orientation and inking prior to histologi-
cal sectioning may be required to assess the status 
of tumour margins. The optimal surgical approach 
and biopsy technique for tumour sampling must 
take into account concerns about contaminating 
new tissue planes with cancer cells that could jeop-
ardize subsequent therapy. For example, thoraco-
scopic pleural biopsy of mesothelioma may result 
in needle - track metastases along the path of surgi-
cal instrumentation. The risk of this surgical spread 
of the cancer is reduced in mesothelioma by post-
operative radiotherapy to the biopsy track. Surgery 
had a major role in the staging of tumours prior 
to the development of improved radiological 
techniques and a staging laparotomy was routine 
care in the management of Hodgkin ’ s disease until 
the late 1980s. Surgical staging retains a role in the 
management of ovarian epithelial cancer and the 
surgical placement of radio - opaque titanium clips 
(that are non - ferrous and thus safe in the magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scanner) may guide post-
operative radiotherapy in some tumours.  
 Surgical  t reatment of  c ancer 
 The surgical treatment of cancer includes deﬁ ni-
tive curative surgery (with or without adjuvant 
treatments), debulking operations, metastasec-
tomy and endocrine ablation surgery for advanced 
disease, although the later is largely historical as 
pharmacological hormone manipulations have 
taken over most of this role. It is really important 
to avoid unnecessary surgery in patients with 
extensive unresectable cancer whilst ensuring that 
patients with potentially curative tumours are not 
denied surgery. The treatment of cancer by multi-
disciplinary teams including radiologists, patholo-
gists, physicians and surgeons is designed to ensure 
the right patients have the right operations at the 
right time. For example, this approach aims to 
guarantee that patients who are candidates for 
neoadjuvant down - staging therapy prior to surgery 
are not wheeled straight into the operating theatre. 
Most early curative surgery aimed to remove 
tumours  en bloc , that is with the draining lymph 
nodes. In recent times surgeons have developed 
the use of more conservative function - preserving 
operations. Examples of the latter include wide 
local excision rather than mastectomy and partial 
nephron - sparing nephrectomy rather than radical 
nephrectomy for small renal tumours. A further 
development in surgery for skin tumours was 
introduced by Dr Frederic Mohs when he was still a 
medical student at the University of Wisconsin -
 Madison. Mohs ’ surgery for skin tumours involves 
the sectioning and mapping of surgical margins 
during the operation to ensure completeness of 
tumour resection. Instead of using a breadknife 
and the pathologist looking at each slice, the 
Mohs ’  technique is like a vegetable peeler with the 
pathologist examining each peeling for involve-
ment during the surgery. Whilst this is a more 
laborious technique, it is especially valuable for 
tumours at speciﬁ c anatomical sites such as the 
eyelids and in recurrent disease. 
 Debulking operations that do not result in com-
plete surgical removal of the tumour are not always 
futile. They can provide important clinical beneﬁ ts 
in selected tumour types including ovarian cancer 
and primary brain tumours and are usually fol-
lowed by either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 
Debulking surgery forms part of the treatment 
algorithm in several uncommon tumours such as 
thymomas and pseudomyxoma peritonei. Mucin 
secretion into the abdominal cavity by mucinous 
adenocarcinomas most commonly arising in the 
appendix is the usual cause of pseudomyxoma 
peritonei. The term  ‘ myxoma ’  is derived from the 
Greek for mucin but the etymology of the medical 
terms myxoma and pseudomyxoma seem to have 
got mixed up. Myxomas are benign, pedunculated 
connective tissue tumours usually arising in the 
atria of the heart and are not mucinous, whilst 
pseudomyxoma peritonei ﬁ lls the abdominal 
cavity with true jelly - like mucin.

upon the anatomical site of compression and the 
stability of the spine. If spinal metastases involve 
the vertebral body or threaten spinal stability, pos-
terior decompression should always be accompa-
nied by internal ﬁ xation with or without bone 
grafting. 
 Surgical  p alliation of  c ancer 
 The palliation of tumour - associated obstruction, 
ﬂ uid accumulation and bleeding may require sur-
gical intervention, although the placement of 
shunts and stents is now more frequently under-
taken by endoscopists and interventional radiolo-
gists. Plastic or metal stents are used to relieve 
obstruction of the bowel, oesophagus, bronchial 
tree, biliary ducts and ureters, and even patients 
with advanced malignancy beneﬁ t. Diathermy or 
laser coagulation of tumour - related haemorrhage 
similarly is a valuable palliative intervention which 
can often be undertaken endoscopically. Surgical 
relief of bowel obstruction may be indicated when 
stenting is not feasible but usually requires either 
colostomy or ileostomy depending upon the level 
of the obstruction. Fistulae are abnormal passage-
ways connecting two epithelial - lined organs not 
normally connected and include rectovaginal, 
enterovaginal, colovesical and vesicovaginal or 
combinations of these. Fistulae may be either 
related to locally advanced disease or may be a con-
sequence of radiotherapy. Fistula surgery is 
complex and demanding, requiring surgical exper-
tise and often prolonged recovery, so it is usually 
reserved for cancer patients in remission. The sur-
gical placement of shunts to prevent the reaccu-
mulation of ascites (usually peritoneal – venous 
shunts, e.g. Leveen shunt) and pleural effusions 
(usually pleuroperitoneal shunts, e.g. Denver 
shunt) may be indicated for symptom palliation. 
Surgical oncologists may also be called upon to 
perform surgery for ulcerating and necrotic locally 
advanced cancers such as toilet mastectomy for 
fungating breast tumours. Orthopaedic surgeons 
frequently operate on pathological bone metas-
tases either as a form of secondary prevention or 
following pathological fractures. Internal ﬁ xation 
of bones with lytic metastases are especially impor-
 The surgical resection of secondary deposits may 
seem perverse since the presence of metastases 
implies systemic dissemination of the cancer. Ne -
vertheless, surgical oncologists have embraced this 
approach enthusiastically, mainly on the basis of 
relatively weak evidence from uncontrolled retro-
spective series that have been interpreted as dem-
onstrating a survival beneﬁ t. The resection of lung, 
liver and brain metastases has become a part of the 
routine treatment strategy for a number of types of 
cancer. The most common indication for surgical 
metastasectomy is for hepatic secondaries from 
colorectal cancer. The rationale for this approach is 
based upon reported ﬁ ve - year survivals of around 
30% in patients undergoing surgery compared to 
around 10% in those who received chemotherapy. 
However, there are no randomixed controlled 
studies that support hepatic metastasectomy and 
the case series are inevitably confounded by selec-
tion and reporting bias. Similarly, pulmonary 
metastasectomy has been widely adopted for oste-
ogenic sarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, renal cell 
tumours and melanomas and cerebral metastasec-
tomy has also been advocated in a similar spectrum 
of malignancies. In contrast to metastasectomy, 
the surgical resection of residual masses following 
the completion of chemotherapy forms part of the 
multidisciplinary treatment of advanced non - sem-
inomatous germ cell tumours to remove residual 
differentiated teratoma that could relapse at a later 
date. Finally, surgical endocrine ablation is nowa-
days rarely indicated for metastatic cancer although 
surgical castration is occasionally performed for 
advanced prostate cancer.  
 Surgery for  o ncological  e mergencies 
 Surgery has an important role in the optimal man-
agement of oncological emergencies, in particular 
metastatic spinal cord compression where rapid 
surgical decompression reduces neurological disa-
bility (see Cord compression in Chapter  46 ). Surgi-
cal decompression and spinal column stabilization 
should be offered to patients with a good prognosis 
and needs to be undertaken as swiftly as possible, 
preferably before patients lose the ability to walk. 
The optimal neurosurgical approach will depend

over the ensuing weeks until a suitable size and 
shape has been achieved, when it may be replaced 
by a more permanent implant. The second most 
common breast reconstruction procedure involves 
ﬂ aps of tissues from other parts of the body such as 
the back, abdomen, buttocks or thigh. These ﬂ aps 
may be pedicled, leaving the original blood supply, 
or may be free ﬂ aps with vascular microsurgery to 
connect to a new blood supply. A latissimus dorsi 
muscle ﬂ ap can be performed without signiﬁ cant 
loss of function and retaining its original blood 
supply. Abdominal ﬂ aps usually take tissue from 
the lower abdomen, for example the TRAM (trans-
verse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) ﬂ ap which 
leaves the abdominal wall weakened. More recent 
abdominal ﬂ aps attempt to retain abdominal wall 
strength by using a muscle - sparing DIEP (deep 
inferior epigastric perforator) ﬂ ap or SIEA (superﬁ -
cial inferior epigastric artery) ﬂ ap. These require 
greater microsurgical skill. Other autologous tissue 
donor sites for breast reconstruction include SGAP 
(superior gluteal artery perforator) and IGAP (infe-
rior gluteal artery perforator) ﬂ aps from the 
buttocks. 
 Radiotherapy 
 Radiotherapy involves the use of high - energy ion-
izing radiation to cause DNA damage and ulti-
mately cell death. The damage induced by ionizing 
radiation may be lethal or sub - lethal to the tumour 
cells. In sub - lethal cell injury, damage to cellular 
proteins 
and 
organelles 
causes 
microscopic 
changes in the cell characterized down the micro-
scope by swelling of mitochondria and endoplas-
mic reticulum and cloudiness of the cytoplasm 
known as hydropic degeneration. Cells may repair 
sub - lethal damage by removing damaged proteins 
and organelles by a cell stress response and 
autophagy and replace them with newly synthe-
sized components. In contrast, lethal damage 
results in either cell necrosis or apoptosis. 
 Ionizing radiation acts by ejecting an electron 
from an atom to yield an ion pair. This may lead to 
direct damage to DNA via molecular excitation or 
indirectly via the hydrolysis of water into free radi-
cals with an open electron shell conﬁ guration 
tant in weight - bearing bones with large deposits 
occupying more than half the bone cortex that are 
at a high risk of fracturing. Surgeons thus have an 
important role in the palliation of symptoms in 
advanced malignancy and their input into the 
multidisciplinary team should not be seen as just 
to establish the diagnosis and surgically resect 
curable cancers.  
 Surgical  r econstruction  f ollowing 
 c ancer  t herapy 
 The aggressive treatment of bulky tumours often 
leaves major residual defects and, in combination 
with plastic surgeons, the discipline of surgical 
oncology has developed reconstructive surgery to 
reduce some of the effects of tumour resections. 
Plastic surgeons have developed a reconstructive 
ladder of increasingly complex wound manage-
ment to deal with some of these residual deﬁ cits 
(Table  3.4 ). Reconstructive surgery is not, however, 
the exclusive responsibility of plastic surgeons. For 
example, orthopaedic surgeons have developed 
sophisticated procedures for limb reconstruction 
following sarcoma surgery using bone grafts and 
prostheses. Maxillofacial surgeons reconstruct 
mandibles with free - ﬂ ap ﬁ bula transplants follow-
ing surgery for oral cavity cancers. ENT surgeons 
medialize vocal cords with silicon injection to 
overcome the hoarse voice associated with recur-
rent laryngeal nerve palsy caused by mediastinal 
tumours. Breast reconstruction following mastec-
tomy often involves the insertion of a tissue 
expander that is progressively injected with saline

fractions, whilst tumour cells are less efﬁ cient at 
repairing damage. Dose fractionation also ensures 
that tumour cells in different phases of the cell 
cycle are exposed to radiation since it causes great-
est damage in the G2 and M phases. The exact 
scheduling and fractionation of radiotherapy 
varies but in general doses of around 2   Gy are 
delivered on a daily basis ﬁ ve days a week. In some 
circumstances more frequent dosing has been 
shown to be more efﬁ cacious but is of course more 
demanding on resources. For example, CHART 
(continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radio-
therapy) involves radiotherapy delivered three 
times a day, every day of the week, usually for a 
fortnight. 
 Radiotherapy utilizes X - rays, electron beams and 
 β - or  γ - radiation produced by radioactive isotopes. 
X - rays are produced when a high - energy electron 
beam that is produced by heating an electrode in a 
vacuum, strikes matter. The energy of X - rays can 
be changed by altering the voltage input to the 
cathode of the X - ray tube that accelerates the elec-
trons. Diagnostic radiology uses low - voltage equip-
ment (e.g. 50   kV), producing X - rays of longer 
wavelength that are less penetrating. Therapeutic 
X - rays are produced by higher voltage machines 
(30 – 50   MeV) producing shorter wavelength, more 
penetrating X - rays. 
 Radiotherapy is delivered in three ways: external 
beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and radioiso-
tope therapy. External beam radiotherapy involves 
the use of isotope sources or linear accelerators to 
deliver radiation from a distance. In the case of 
brachytherapy, the radioactive source is a solid 
radioactive nuclide emitting  γ - rays which is placed 
within the tumour or closely applied to the 
tumour. Finally, radioactive isotopes that are pref-
erentially taken up in the target organ may be 
administered orally or intravenously; for example, 
oral iodine - 131 is given for the treatment of 
thyroid tumours and intravenous strontium - 89 in 
palliative treatment of bone metastasis.

 Superﬁ cial voltage machines operate at 50 – 150   kV

characterized by the presence of an unpaired elec-
tron (Figure  3.1 ). These free radicals are highly 
reactive, usually short - lived chemicals such as the 
neutrally charged hydroxyl radical (OH · ) derived 
from water which has an  in vivo  half - life of about 
10  − 9 seconds. The other common free radical 
formed from water is superoxide (  O2
−) with one 
unpaired electron, which is responsible for the 
 ‘ oxidative burst ’ or oxygen - dependent intracellu-
lar killing of ingested bacteria by phagocytes and is 
detoxiﬁ ed by the enzyme superoxide dismutase.  
 The dose of radiotherapy is deﬁ ned as the 
amount of energy deposited in tissues and is meas-
ured in Grays (Gy) after Hal Gray, a British pioneer 
of radiation biology and physics who also estab-
lished the Gray Laboratories at Mount Vernon 
Hospital. One Gray is the dose absorbed when 1   J 
(joule) is deposited in 1   kg of tissue. Each Gray per 
cell causes approximately 10   000 damaged DNA 
bases, 1000 damaged deoxyribose sugars, 1000 
single strand breaks, 40 double strand breaks, 150 
DNA – protein cross - links and 30 DNA – DNA cross -
 links. Radiation can have an effect at any point in 
the cell cycle, although it is only at the time of 
mitosis that cell death occurs. Therefore, there can 
be a time lag of days, weeks or even months 
between the radiotherapy and the full effects of the 
treatment becoming manifest. Typical radiother-
apy doses for solid epithelial tumours are 60 – 80  Gy. 
This is delivered as multiple fractions over time for 
several reasons. Dose fractionation allows normal 
cells to recover from sub - lethal damage between

1  cm below the surface of the skin. They are used 
chieﬂ y to treat superﬁ cial skin cancers. Orthovolt-
age machines that yield X - rays of 200 – 300   kV 
energy penetrate to a depth of 3   cm. Metastases in 
bones close to the skin surface (ribs, sacrum) are 
frequently treated on these machines. Megavolt-
age radiotherapy machines usually use a cobalt - 60 
source that produces X - rays of 1.25  MeV on decay-
ing to nickel - 60. The cobalt - 60 sources are con-
tained within a protective lead shield and an 
adjustable window in this shield allows regulation 
of the  γ - ray beam. However, there is considerable 
scatter of the beam, limiting the focus, and the 
relatively short half - life of the cobalt source means 
that it needs to be replaced every three to four years 
and that treatment times may become prolonged 
as the cobalt nears the replacement date. It is

speculated that cobalt - 60 sources could be used by 
terrorists to produce a  ‘ dirty ’ bomb, a conventional 
explosive device to which radioactive material has 
been added. 
 Megavoltage machines have been replaced by 
linear accelerators that produce a high - energy elec-
tron beam by accelerating electrons down a cylin-
drical waveguide before they bombard a ﬁ xed 
target, resulting in a high - intensity electron beam 
(4 – 20   MeV) with greater penetration and less 
scatter. The advantages of this electron beam over 
X - rays lie in the penetration and decay characteris-
tics that allow an electron beam to deliver its high 
energy to deep - seated tumours whilst sparing 
normal tissues in its pathway (Figure  3.2 ) .

or body cavity to deliver localized radiotherapy 
(Table  3.5 ). Examples of bachytherapy include 
radioactive iridium - 192 needles or wires implanted 
into tumours of the breast, tongue and ﬂ oor of the 
mouth. Sealed caesium - 137 radioactive sources 
may also be placed into the vagina or rectum to 
treat cancers of the vagina, cervix, lower uterus, 
rectum or anus. Brachytherapy seeds are increas-
ingly being used to treat localized prostate cancer 
(Figure  3.4 ). The major disadvantage of brachy-
therapy is the risk to staff handling the radioactive 
sources and caring for the patients. The radioactiv-
ity exposure of all staff involved with brachyther-
apy must be monitored. Another method used to 
reduce exposure is to place inactive source holders 
while the patient is anaesthetized, and once they 
have been correctly located (as determined by 
X - ray) the patient is allowed to recover from the 
procedure. With the patient in a shielded room, 
the live radioactive source is then introduced, 
either manually or by remote control using a selec-
tron. This routine is termed manual or remote 
normal tissues really began with the introduction 
of the multileaf collimator composed of over 100 
metal leaves, 5   mm thick and each aligned parallel 
to the radiation ﬁ eld. As each leaf may be moved 
independently to block part of the ﬁ eld, the result-
ing radiation ﬁ eld may be shaped and sculpted 
to suit the target. A further reﬁ nement of this 
process, known as intensity - modulated radiother-
apy (IMRT), involves moving the multileaf colli-
mator during the dose so that another level of ﬁ ne 
tuning of the ﬁ eld can be achieved (Figure  3.3 ). 
One more recent development is image - guided 
radiation therapy (IGRT) that links the carefully 
shaped ﬁ eld with a continuous image of the 
patient. This process can overcome, for example, 
movement artefacts generated by the patient 
(hopefully still) breathing.

 Radioisotope  t herapy 
 Radioactive isotopes can be given by mouth or 
injection and are taken up by a particular tissue 
where they remain. Radioisotope therapy can only 
be used where a tumour is in a tissue that will pref-
erentially accumulate a speciﬁ c isotope, leaving 
other tissues unaffected. Examples are the thyroid, 
which will take up radioactive iodine and bone, 
that naturally accumulates phosphorus or will take 
up bone - seeking radiochemicals such as rhenium -
 186 hydroxyethylidine diphosphate ( 186 Re - HEDP) 
(Table  3.6 ). A disadvantage with this approach is 
that the source cannot be recovered, limiting the 
degree of control over the total exposure to 
radiation. 
 Toxicity of  r adiotherapy 
 External beam radiotherapy is usually given as 
repeated daily dose fractions rather than as a single 
large dose of radiotherapy, which would lead to 
severe damage to the normal tissues. Even with 
fractionation, normal tissues have a maximum tol-
erated dose as indicated in Table  3.7 . The area to be 
irradiated is referred to as the radiation ﬁ eld. This is 
marked out on the skin before treatment and such 
markings often persist after treatment as tattooed 
dots. These radiotherapy tattoos are assiduously 
sought by clinical medical exam candidates but in

real life most patients will tell you that they have 
had radiotherapy if you ask them nicely. In general, 
radiation - related side effects occur within the ﬁ eld 
of treatment although a few systemic manifesta-
tions such as fatigue and nausea may occur. The 
toxicity of radiotherapy increases with both the 
volume of tissue irradiated and the dose given. 
The transient side effects that develop during treat-
ment tend to reﬂ ect the acute damage to normal 
healthy tissue. Careful planning of the beam size 
and shielding of surrounding tissue, ensuring that 
radiation ﬁ elds give effective tumour eradication 
with an acceptable level of toxicity, is, therefore, a 
prerequisite of successful therapy.  
 Radiotherapy - related side effects can be usefully 
divided into early and late toxicities (Table  3.8 ). 
Early toxicity occurs in hours to weeks and includes 
both systemic effects such as nausea, lethargy and 
myelosuppression (when a large volume of bone 
marrow is within the treated area, for example 
whole femur or pelvis radiation). Localized skin 
toxicity is a common early side effect that may be 
local erythema progressing to ulceration and desq-
uamation in the more severe cases. Other early side 
effects depend on the anatomy of the radiotherapy 
ﬁ eld, e.g. alopecia with cranial irradiation (see 
Plate  3.1 ), oropharyngeal mucositis with head and 
neck radiotherapy, and diarrhoea, proctitis and 
cystitis with pelvic ﬁ elds. These early reactions 
occur in tissues that are rapidly dividing and are 
usually present during or shortly after the course of 
radiotherapy and in most cases are reversible. Late 
side effects may take months or years to manifest 
themselves and once again depend upon the site 
being irradiated. These late tissue reactions occur 
when slowly dividing cells attempt division and 
are less frequently reversible. In some cases the 
effects are believed to be mediated by ﬁ brosis of the 
vascular endothelium. Examples of late reactions 
include necrosis in the central nervous system 
leading to transverse myelitis and paralysis with 
spinal cord radiation ﬁ elds, radiation - induced 
nephritis and osteomyelitis. Finally, radiotherapy 
is carcinogenic and may induce secondary 
tumours. 
 Radiosensitivity and  r adioresistance 
 Tumour resistance to radiotherapy appears to be 
an intrinsic property of that cancer, rather than an 

The principles of cancer treatment Chapter 3
53
acquired attribute selected for by treatment, as in 
the case of chemotherapy. Indeed the radiation 
sensitivities of many types of tumour are relatively 
predictable. The response of tissues both malig-
nant and normal to fractionated radiation depends 
upon the  ‘ 5 Rs ’ : 
  ●    Repair 
  ●    Reassortment 
  ●    Repopulation 
  ●    Reoxygenation 
  ●    Radiosensitivity. 
 In this context, repair is recovery from sub - lethal 
damage and is dependent on DNA repair mecha-
nisms. Reassortment refers to the cell cycle phase 
of the tumour cells. Cells in G2 and M phases are 
most susceptible to radiotherapy and so after a ﬁ rst 
dose cells in G1 and S will make up a greater pro-
portion of the live tumour cells. Depending on the 
timing of the subsequent fraction of radiotherapy 
these cells may have progressed or  ‘ reassorted ’ to 
G2 and M phases with increased sensitivity. Repop-
ulation is the ability of tumour cells to grow and 
divide between doses of radiotherapy; this is a par-
ticular problem with prolonged fractionation and 
delayed fractions. Hypoxic cells are relatively radi-
oresistant and after the ﬁ rst fractions of radiother-
apy, the death of sensitive cells reduces the 
competition for oxygen in the tumour and cells 
that were hypoxic previously become reoxygen-
ated and hence more susceptible to radiation. Dif-
ferent cell lineages are more or less radiosensitive 
and these differences are in part intrinsic and inde-
pendent of environmental factors. Amongst the 
factors that inﬂ uence the radiosensitivity of 
tumours are the DNA repair genes, the production 
of free radical scavenging molecules (e.g. glutath-
ione - S - transferases, superoxide dismutases, glu-
tathione peroxidase), genes controlling apoptosis 
and cell cycle regulatory genes.  
 Chemotherapy 
 Drug  d iscovery 
 The origins of chemotherapy for cancer lie in the 
use of biological warfare during the First World 
War, most hauntingly described in Wilfred Owen ’ s 
poem  ‘ Dulce et decorum est ’ . Following the exten-
sive use of chlorine gas in trench warfare, the 
German army ﬁ rst released mustard gas at Ypres on 
the night of 12 – 13 July 1917. Mustard gas had been 
synthesized in 1854 by Victor Meyer and was noted 
to be a vesicant in 1887. As a weapon of mass 
destruction, mustard gas or Yperite as it was then 
known, had the advantages over chlorine of requir-
ing smaller doses, being almost odourless and 
remaining active in the soil for weeks. The British 
gas casualties from 1914 – 1918 reveal the greater 
fatalities with mustard gas. Mustard gas exposure 
causes a severe blistering rash and conjunctivitis 
followed by meyelosuppression after around four 
days. During the Second World War the only use of 
mustard gas resulted in an own goal when the Luft-
waffe sunk the USS  John Harvey  off Bari harbour in 
southern Italy in 1943. The ship was carrying 2000 
M47A1 bombs containing a total of 100 tonnes of 
mustard gas and the American sailors who survived 
developed conjunctivitis and skin blistering fol-
lowed by a steep fall in their white cell counts, as 
documented by the naval surgeon Colonel Stewart 
Alexander. Meanwhile at Yale University, Alfred 
Gilman and Louis Goodman were using the closely 
related nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine) ini-
tially in murine lymphoma models. In 1944 the 
ﬁ rst patient with lymphosarcoma (high - grade non - 
Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma) was treated and although 
Mr J. D., a 48 - year - old silversmith, achieved a tem-
porary remission of his tumour, he later died of 
bone marrow failure. 
 The subsequent development of chemotherapy 
following this fortuitous ﬁ nding as a by - product of 
biological warfare, owes much to luck and trial and 
error rather than design. One serendipitous discov-
ery was made by Barnett Rosenberg, a physicist at 
Michigan State University in 1965. He studied the 
effects of electric currents on  Escherichia coli  using 
platinum electrodes in a water bath and found that 
they stopped dividing but not growing, leading to 
bacteria up to 300 times longer than normal. This 
was found to be due to cisplatin, a product from 
the platinum electrodes, which was interfering 
with DNA replication. By the end of the 1960s a 
number of cytotoxic drugs from natural sources 
had been identiﬁ ed. In 1971 President Nixon,

rea. Most antimetabolites have their greatest activ-
ity during the S phase.  
 Intercalating  a gents 
 Intercalating agents disrupt the steric integrity of 
the DNA double helix. The exact mechanisms of 
this action remain uncertain although anthracy-
cline antibiotics intercalate into the DNA major 
groove between base pairs of the DNA double helix 
and this action is non - covalent with no base 
sequence speciﬁ city. Platinum agents also interca-
late and form intrastrand links similar to those 
formed by alkylating agents.  
 Spindle  p oisons 
 Antimicrotubule drugs can be divided into two 
groups, those that stabilize microtubules by inhib-
iting depolymerization (e.g. taxanes) and those 
that are depolymerizing agents that inhibit polym-
erization of tubulin (e.g. vinca alkaloids). Spindle 
poisons inhibit the mitotic spindle function and 
therefore act in the M phase of the cell cycle. 
Tubulin exists as  α - tubulin and  β - tubulin mono-
mers in dynamic equilibrium with tubulin poly-
mers, or microtubules. Resistance to spindle 
poisons may occur by mutations of  β - tubulin 
and these point mutations do not confer cross -
 resistance between taxanes and vincas. An early 
spindle cell poison included colchicine used for 
acute gout, familial Mediterranean fever and rarely 
psoriasis. Although colchicine, like vincas causes 
depolymerization, it binds to a distinct site and is 
not used as a cytotoxic.  
 Topoisomerase  i nhibitors 
 Topoisomerases prevent DNA strands from becom-
ing tangled by cutting DNA and allowing it to wind 
or unwind. There are two mammalian classes of 
topoisomerases: topoisomerase I breaks single 
strands of DNA, whilst topoisomerase II breaks 
both strands of DNA. Topoisomerase I inhibitors 
act by inhibiting the re - ligation step of the nick-
ing – closing reaction trapping topoisomerase I in a 
covalent complex with DNA. Topoisomerase I 
losing a war in Vietnam, declared war on cancer, 
signing the Cancer Act and establishing a drug dis-
covery programme at the National Cancer Insti-
tute (NCI). This project trawled though thousands 
of natural chemicals in search of potential cyto-
toxic agents. It was not until the 1990s that rational 
drug design targeting known tumour - related fea-
tures emerged. Examples of this include trastuzu-
mab, a monoclonal antibody raised against erbB2/
neu/Her - 2 in breast cancer, and imatinib, which 
inhibits the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding 
site of brc - abl fusion protein kinase in chronic 
myeloid leukaemia.  
 Mechanisms of  c ytotoxic  d rug 
 Amongst the many classiﬁ cations of cytotoxic 
agents is a functional classiﬁ cation of cytotoxics 
(Table  3.9 ). 
 Alkylating  a gents 
 Alkylating agents transfer an alkyl group to purine 
(adenine and guanine) bases of DNA. Bifunctional 
alkylating agents form covalent bonds between 
two different bases resulting in interstand or intras-
trand cross - links, whilst monofunctional alkylat-
ing agents cannot form cross - links but cause 
adducts. Both forms of DNA alteration inhibit 
DNA synthesis, so alkyating agents act chieﬂ y 
during the S phase of the cell cycle. Bifunctional 
agents can act on more than one base and are more 
cytotoxic, whilst monofunctional agents are more 
mutagenic and carcinogenic. One of the mecha-
nisms of tumour resistance to alkylating agents is 
enzymatic removal of alkyl groups from purine 
bases and enhanced repair of cross - links. 
 Antimetabolites 
 Antimetabolites are structurally similar to natural 
compounds and in general interfere with cellular 
enzymes. These agents inhibit the metabolism 
(usually synthesis) of compounds necessary for 
DNA, RNA or protein synthesis. They include: (1) 
purine analogues, (2) pyrimidine analogues, (3) 
folic acid analogues, and (4) others, e.g. hydroxyu-

 Chemotherapy  r esistance 
 The major obstacle to successful cures with chemo-
therapy is the development of drug resistance 
by tumours. Indeed the intrinsic resistance of 
some tumour cell types accounts, in part, for the 
variable sensitivity of different cancers to chemo-
therapy (Table  3.10 ). In some circumstances drug

resistance is to a single drug only, whilst in other 
cases there is cross - resistance between different 
drugs. The latter mechanism is due to the expres-
sion of molecular efﬂ ux pumps in tumour cell 
membranes. The most commonly found pump in 
multiresistant tumour cells is P - glycoprotein (Pgp) 
or the multidrug resistance protein (MDR). This 
transmembrane protein pumps natural toxins out 
of cells (including most chemotherapy agents) and 
is normally present in selected cells of the body 
such as renal proximal tubule cells, the apical 
mucosal cells of the colon and the canilicular 
surface of hepatocytes. Overexpression of Pgp/
MDR by cancer cells confers a survival advantage 
in the presence of chemotherapy by inducing 
tumour resistance.  
 Cytotoxic - speciﬁ c drug resistance can be ach-
ieved by a number of mechanisms including efﬁ -
cient repair of DNA, reduced drug uptake, increased 
drug efﬂ ux, decreased intracellular activation of 
the drug, increased intracellular inactivation of the 
drug, activation of biochemical pathways that 
bypass the pathway being blocked by the cytotoxic 
drug, and ﬁ nally compensation for blocked 
enzyme pathways by increased enzyme produc-
tion. An example of the last form of drug - speciﬁ c 
resistance occurs with methotrexate, an antifolate 
antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reduct-
ase (DHFR). The ﬁ rst ever cancer cures with chemo-
therapy alone were reported with methotrexate for 
choriocarcinoma in 1963. In resistant tumour cells 
there is ampliﬁ cation of the DHFR gene with many 
thousands of copies of the gene leading to higher 
levels of DHFR to overcome the inhibitory actions 
of methotrexate.  
 How  c hemotherapy  i s  u sed 
 Cytotoxic drugs are rarely used as single agents but 
are usually administered in combinations in an 
attempt to improve treatment efﬁ cacy by reducing 
the development of drug resistance, based on 
similar principles in the management of infectious 
diseases such as tuberculosis. A number of consid-
erations are applied to the design of chemotherapy 
combinations. Only drugs that have proven activ-
ity as single agents should be included and prefer-
ence should be given to drugs with non - overlapping 
toxicities and different modes of action. Cycles or 
pulses of chemotherapy given intermittently are 
designed to allow for recovery of normal tissues 
between doses without enabling the tumour cells 
to repopulate. Although this goal is frequently 
desirable, in recent years a number of continuous 
infusion chemotherapy regimens have been devel-
oped. The importance of a good acronym for a 
chemotherapy regimen should not be underesti-
mated. No single regimen has remained the gold 
standard of care for as long as the CHOP regimen 
for non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma, easily seeing off 
competition from the likes of ProMACE - CytaBOM. 
With greater experience of the beneﬁ ts and disad-
vantages of chemotherapy, its safety has improved 
and the indications for its use have expanded. As 
with radiotherapy and endocrine treatments 
chemotherapy is increasingly used in an adjuvant 
context (Table  3.11 ). 
 In some circumstances chemotherapy resistance 
may be overcome by escalating the dose of cyto-
toxic drugs. In many circumstances the dose - 
limiting toxicity (DLT) of chemotherapy is 
myelosuppression and if this can be avoided doses 
may be doubled or more before reaching the next 
DLT, which is often mucosal damage. Autologous 
(from the patient him/herself) and allogeneic

(from a donor) bone marrow transplantation was 
developed to this end. Prior to high - dose chemo-
therapy, progenitor stem cells are harvested either 
from multiple bone marrow aspirations (bone 
marrow transplant or BMT) or now more often 
from peripheral blood following growth factor 
stimulation (peripheral blood stem cell transplant 
or PBSCT). These stem cells are immature haemat-
opoietic cells capable of repopulating the bone 
marrow. The patient then receives the condition-
ing high - dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy 
and subsequently the stem cells are re - infused as a 
transfusion. This approach has an appreciable 
mortality of 20 – 50% in the case of allogeneic BMT 
and of 5% with autologous PBSCT. However, stem 
cell transplantation has a deﬁ ned role in the man-
agement of a number of malignancies (Table  3.12 ).

 Side  e ffects of  c hemotherapy 
 The main actions of chemotherapy are focused on 
killing rapidly dividing cancer cells and hence 
many of their toxicities arise because of the effects 
on normal cells with high rates of turnover. Indeed 
the side effects of chemotherapy may be divided 
into the predictable toxicities that are common, 
often dose related and usually related to the 
mechanism of action of the drug. In contrast 
idiosyncratic side effects are usually rarer, unre-
lated to dose or mechanism of action but tend to 
be drug speciﬁ c. The predictable effects of chemo-
therapy on fast dividing normal cells (bone 
marrow, gastrointestinal tract epithelium, hair 
follicles, spermatogonia) will be a consequence 
of inhibition of cell division and are especially 
found with cell cycle phase - speciﬁ c cytotoxics. 
In contrast the side effects on slow - growing cell 
types will occur most frequently with drugs that 
are not cell cycle speciﬁ c such as the alkylating 
agents that introduce DNA mutations into these 
cells resulting in secondary leukaemias and other 
tumours. 
 The side effects of chemotherapy may be divided 
into three time groups, immediate effects that 
occur within hours, delayed effects that occur 
within days, weeks or months but are generally 
manifested whilst the full course of chemotherapy 
treatment is on - going, and late effects that occur

58
months, years or decades after the chemotherapy 
has ceased. The top ﬁ ve side effects ranked by 
patients according to severity are nausea, fatigue, 
hair loss, concern about the effects on friends and 
family and ﬁ nally vomiting. The immediate toxici-
ties include nausea and vomiting, anaphylaxis, 
extravasation and tumour lysis. The delayed side 
effects are the most abundant and include alo-
pecia, myelosuppression, stomatitis and the major-
ity of the unpredictable toxicities. The late effects 
of chemotherapy include infertility and secondary 
malignancies.

muscles with relaxation of the cardiac sphincter 
and the muscles of the throat. There are four inputs 
into the vomiting centre: the labyrinths (e.g. 
motion sickness), the higher cortical centres (e.g. 
fear, anticipation), the vagus nerve sensory input 
from the gastrointestinal tract particularly the 
small bowel, and ﬁ nally the chemoreceptor trigger 
zone (CTZ). The CTZ is located in the area pos-
trema adjacent to the fourth ventricle where the 
blood – brain barrier is relatively deﬁ cient and 
chemicals in the blood and cerebrospinal ﬂ uid 
(CSF) are sensed, stimulating the vomiting centre. 
The different inputs to the vomiting centre rely on 
different neurotransmitters and this can be 
exploited pharmacologically in the control of 
symptoms (Figure  3.5 ). Chemotherapy chieﬂ y acts 
on the gastrointestinal tract causing serotonin 
(5 - hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) release and acting via 
the afferent vagus nerve. It also stimulates the 
chemoreceptor trigger zone which employs

dopaminergic and muscarinic pathways. Occa-
sionally anticipatory vomiting is problematic and 
this acts through the higher cortical centres using 
 γ - aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. In 
contrast, the labyrinthine pathways utilize hista-
mine - 1 receptors and motion sickness is often suc-
cessfully controlled with antihistamines.  
 The likelihood of being sick with chemotherapy 
depends upon the emetogenicity of the cytotoxics 
used as well as host - related factors. Cisplatin and 
mustine are amongst the most emetogenic whilst 
vinca alkaloids rarely cause nausea. Younger age, 
women, patients who have been sick previously 
with chemotherapy, and patients with a low 
alcohol intake are all more likely to suffer with 
chemotherapy - induced vomiting. Acute vomiting 
within six hours of chemotherapy is best control-
led by a combination of steroids and 5HT - 3 recep-
tor antagonists. Delayed vomiting occurring up to 
ﬁ ve days after the chemotherapy is best treated 
with steroids and dopamine antagonists. Anticipa-
tory vomiting that occurs prior to receiving chem-
otherapy is treated with benzodiazepines.  
 Anaphylaxis 
 As with all medicines, anaphylaxis may occur with 
chemotherapy and the most common culprits are 
taxanes and asparaginase. The incidence of hyper-
sensitivity with paclitaxel is so high that routine 
prophylaxis with steroids and antihistamines (H1 
and H2) is administered to all patients receiving 
paclitaxel. 
 Extravasation 
 Extravasation is the inadvertent administration of 
chemotherapy into subcutaneous tissue. This leads 
to pain, erythema, inﬂ ammation and discomfort, 
which if unrecognized and untreated can lead to 
tissue necrosis with the possibility of serious seque-
lae. The position, size and age of the cannulation 
site are the factors that have the greatest bearing on 
the likelihood of problems occurring (Figure  3.6 ) 
and the experience of the specialist administering 
the chemotherapy is crucial in this aspect. The like-
lihood of damage occurring is determined by the

with poor venous access. Hickman lines are placed in the

cytotoxic drug, with anthracyclines being espe-
cially likely to cause severe injury.  
 Tumour  l ysis 
 The rapid cytolysis of a large volume of cancer cells 
at the start of chemotherapy occasionally results in 
the tumour lysis syndrome or metabolic chaos. 
The destruction of tumour DNA leads to hyperuri-
caemia from the breakdown of nucleotide bases. 
The cytolysis causes hyperkalaemia by releaseing 
intracellular potassium and the breakdown of pro-
teins and DNA causes hyperphosphataemia and 
secondary hypocalcaemia. Acute renal failure may 
be a consequence of the high levels of urate and 
phosphate, whilst the high levels of potassium 
may lead to cardiac arrthymias. Tumour lysis only 
really occurs with acute leukaemias and high - grade 
lymphomas including Burkitt lymphoma. Bulky 
tumours, poor renal function and high levels of 
urate before chemotherapy increase the risk of 
tumour lysis. 
 Uric acid is soluble at physiological pH but pre-
cipitates in the acidic environment of the renal 
tubules, leading to crystallization in the collecting 
ducts and ureters, leading to obstructive uropathy.

Similarly calcium phosphate is precipitated in the 
renal tubules and microvasculature producing 
nephrocalcinosis. The most important issue in the 
management of tumour lysis is its prevention by a 
combination of hyperhydaration, allopurinol and 
urinary alkalinization to pH  > 7 with sodium bicar-
bonate to reduce urate precipitation in the renal 
tubules. Allopurinol is an inhibitor of xanthine 
oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion 
of soluble xanthine (a product of purine catabo-
lism) to uric acid. The treatment of established 
tumour lysis is an oncological emergency. The 
majority of patients who develop tumour lysis 
have chemosensitive tumours and are receiving 
potentially curative treatment. These patients 
should be considered candidates for urgent haemo-
dialysis. A relatively new addition to the treatment 
is recombinant urate oxidase (rasburicase) which 
converts insoluble urate to soluble allantoin 
(Figure  3.7 ). 
 Delayed  s ide  e ffects ( p redictable) 
 The main predictable delayed side effects of chem-
otherapy are alopecia, bone marrow suppression 
and gastrointestinal mucositis. 
 Alopecia and  o nychodystrophy 
 Hair loss with chemotherapy is both drug and dose 
dependent and is related to the frequency of cycle 
repetition. Long - term therapy may result in loss of 
pubic, axillary and facial hair in addition to scalp 
hair. The loss of scalp hair often occurs in an acute 
episode while washing, usually two to six weeks 
after starting chemotherapy. It should be empha-
sized to patients that alopecia from chemotherapy 
is reversible, with hair regrowth beginning one to 
two months after completing chemotherapy. The 
hair may regrow a lighter or darker colour and is 
often curlier initially. Doxorubicin and cyclophos-
phamide are the commonest culprits. Patients 
should be offered wigs available on the NHS. Scalp 
cooling (below 22 ° C) may reduce alopecia by 
causing vasoconstriction and reducing circulation 
to hair follicles. The pharmacokinetic proﬁ les of 
cytotoxics dictate that scalp cooling is only effec-
tive for anthracyclines. Concerns have been raised 
over the potential risk of developing scalp and cer-
ebral metastases due to reduced drug circulation to 
these sites with scalp cooling. Along with alopecia, 
a frequent complication of chemotherapy is ony-
chodystrophy or nail changes other than colour 
changes that usually make the nails brittle and 
prone to shedding (onycholysis) as well as fungal 
infection (onychomycosis). A common physical 
sign in patients who have received cyclical chemo-
therapy are Beau lines, horizontal grooves or lines 
on the nail plate that indicate cycles of arrested nail 
growth with chemotherapy cycles (see Plate  3.2 ). 
 Myelotoxicity of  c hemotherapy 
 The myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy 
may affect the circulating red cells, white cells and 
platelets and the manifestations in these three 
series are in part related to their circulatory 
lifespans. In circulation the half - life of an erythro-

The principles of cancer treatment Chapter 3
61
cyte is 120 days, of a leucocyte is six to eight hours 
and of a platelet is seven days. 
 There is a signiﬁ cant risk of severe myelosuppres-
sion if chemotherapy is initiated when the total 
white cell count is  < 3.0   ×  10 9 /l (or the neutrophil 
count is  < 1.5    ×  10 9 /l) and/or the platelet count is 
 < 150    ×  10 9 /l. These values are the usual cut - offs for 
administering a cycle of chemotherapy, however it 
may be given at lower values in patients with hae-
matological malignancies or if supportive therapy 
is anticipated and when non - myelosuppressive 
regimens are employed. Myelosuppression is the 
dose - limiting toxicity for many cytotoxic agents; 
the main exceptions are vincristine, bleomycin, 
streptozotocin and asparaginase, which do not 
cause myelosuppression. 
 Thus anaemia is rarely a dose - limiting toxicity 
but is generally cumulative over successive cycles 
of chemotherapy. Anaemia is most troublesome 
with cisplatin since the nephrotoxicity of this 
agent may decrease erythropoietin production 
from the kidneys in response to anaemia. The 
symptoms of anaemia include fatigue, lethargy 
and exertional dyspnoea with haemoglobin levels 
in the range 8 – 10   g/dl. Reduced exercise capacity 
progresses to dyspnoea and tachycardia at rest and 
complications including cerebrovascular (e.g. tran-
sient iscaemic attacks) and cardiovascular (e.g. 
angina) ischaemia as the haemoglobin falls below 
8  g/dl. The management of chemotherapy - induced 
anaemia is with transfusion and in the case of cis-
platin - induced anaemia, at least, erythropoietin 
may be beneﬁ cial (Box  3.1 ). 
 Neutropenia (neutrophil count  < 1.0   ×  10 9 /l) is 
the commonest dose - limiting toxicity of chemo-
therapy and is a frequent cause of treatment delays 
and dose reductions. Neutropenia is most often 
manifest as infection (Figure  3.8 ) and neutropenic 
sepsis is a medical emergency, which if left 
untreated is potentially fatal. It is frequently over-
looked by untrained medical staff and delays in 
starting intravenous antibiotics can be fatal. Neu-
tropenic sepsis is deﬁ ned as a fever of 38.0 ° C or 
higher for at least two hours when the neutrophil 
count is below 1.0   ×  10 9 /l. 
 The treatment of neutropenic sepsis includes a 
thorough clinical history and physical examina-

tunistic infection during a course of chemotherapy for 
Hodgkin ’ s disease.  
tion to identify possible sources of infection. Initial 
management must include resuscitation measures 
for shock if present. An infection screen should be 
performed, including blood cultures from periph-
eral veins as well as from any central access cathe-
ters, a urine sample for microscopy and culture, a 
chest X - ray and a throat swab for culture. Treat-
ment should not be delayed awaiting the results of 
cultures. The most common organisms associated 
with neutropenic sepsis are common bacterial 
pathogens. Empirical antibiotic treatment should 
be instituted with broad - spectrum bactericidal 
antibiotics and policies will be dictated by local 
antibiotic resistance patterns. The most common 
initial treatment regimens are a parenteral 
combination of an aminoglycoside with either a 
cephalosporin or a broad - spectrum penicillin. 
Alternatively, monotherapy with a cephalosporin 
may be used. If there is no response within 36 – 48 
hours, the antibiotic regimen should be reviewed

 Box 3.1:   Haematopoietic growth factors 
 The proliferation and maturation of blood cell lineages is determined by haemopoietic growth factors (Figure  3.9 ) or 
colony - stimulating factors (CSFs). Bone marrow stromal cells produce many of these growth factors. Recombinant hae-
mopoietic growth factors are administered to ameliorate chemotherapy - induced cytopenias. They are given parenterally 
to avoid proteolytic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract.  
 Erythropoietin 
 This growth factor is naturally produced by the kidney in response to hypoxia and stimulates red cell proliferation. It may 
be overproduced in renal cell carcinoma leading to paraneoplastic polycythemia. As well as its role in the treatment of 
anaemia of chronic renal failure, erythropoietin may be used to treat cytotoxic - induced anaemia, particularly where cis-
platin is implicated.  
 Granulocyte  c olony - s timulating  f actor ( G - CSF ) 
 G - CSF is a lineage - restricted growth factor promoting granulocyte differentiation whilst granulocyte – macrophage CSF 
(GM - CSF) is multifunctional, affecting granulocytes, monocytes, megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors but not 
basophils. Both CSFs are used in the treatment of chemotherapy - and radiotherapy - related neutropenia. Evidence - based 
guidelines are available that describe the rational use of G - CSF in four circumstances:

 1.   Primary prophylaxis (i.e. with the ﬁ rst cycle of chemotherapy): not routinely used, occasionally used for pre - existing 
neutropenia, e.g. due to marrow inﬁ ltration. 
 2.   Secondary prophylaxis: only for curable tumours with proven importance of maintaining dose intensity (germ cell 
tumours, choriocarcinoma, lymphoma).  
 3.   Febrile neutropenia: data do not support routine G - CSF usage, but indicate use in the presence of pneumonia, hypo-
tension, multiorgan failure and fungal infection.  
 4.   Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization prior to harvesting for high - dose therapy and stem cell rescue.  
 Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) 
 TPO is constitutively produced by the liver and kidneys and acts on many stages of megakaryocyte growth and differen-
tiation. It has yet to become incorporated into routine clinical use. Interleukin - 11 however also raises platelet counts 
following chemotherapy and has been licensed for this indication in the USA.  
(continued)
in the light of culture results, and consideration 
given to adding antifungal cover (e.g. amphoter-
icin B). For patients with severe neutropenic sepsis 
as deﬁ ned by hypotension, pneumonia or multior-
gan failure, granulocyte colony - stimulating factor 
(G - CSF) should be administered. Following an 
episode of neutropenic sepsis consideration should 
be given to reducing the chemotherapy dosage in 
subsequent cycles, or if dose intensity has been 
shown to inﬂ uence the outcome (e.g. germ cell 
tumours, Hodgkin ’ s disease) secondary prophy-
laxis with G - CSF to reduce the duration of neutro-
penia should be considered (Box  3.1 ). 
 Thrombocytopenia is a common side effect of 
chemotherapy, particularly with carboplatin, that 
rarely causes clinical manifestations unless it is 
severe. Although petechiae and bruising may 
occur, major haemorrhage is very rare unless the 
platelet count falls below 20    ×  10 9 /l. At platelet 
counts below 10    ×  10 9 /l there is an appreciable risk 
of gastrointestinal or cerebral haemorrhage and 
prophylactic administration of pooled platelets is 
warranted. Growth factor support for thrombocy-
topenia is currently investigational only (Box  3.1 ) 
and chemotherapy dose delays and reductions 
may be necessary following low platelet nadir 
counts. 
 Gastrointestinal  t ract  m ucositis 
 Mucositis is a frequent delayed side effect of chem-
otherapy occurring in 40 – 50% of patients, and is 
even more common in patients receiving chemo -
 radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for head and 
neck cancers. It is thought that chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy damage basal epithelial cells in the 
intestinal mucosa leading to apoptosis, atrophy 
and ulceration. Once ulceration occurs, bacterial 
and fungal infection and activation of macro-
phages leads to further inﬂ ammation. Mucositis is 
associated with signiﬁ cant morbidity and mortal-
ity risk, and chemotherapy dose reductions and 
delays. Sucking ice lollies during chemotherapy 
may reduce the incidence of mucositis with some 
cytotoxics by a mechanism analogous to the cold 
cap treatment for the prevention of alopecia. 
Various  ‘ magic mouthwashes ’ (usually a mild local 
anaesthetic and antiseptic combination) may 
provide symptomatic relief from mucositis. The 
time course of mucositis closely resembles that of 
neutropenia, typically occurring 7 – 14 days after 
the administration of chemotherapy. Recent 
developments in the management of mucositis 
also hint at comparisons with the investigational 
study of keratinocyte growth factors as treatment 
for mucositis. In a few cases speciﬁ c antidotes 
reduce the incidence of mucositis, such as folinic 
acid rescue after methotrexate.  
 Delayed  s ide  e ffects ( i diosyncratic) 
 Many delayed side effects of chemotherapy are 
drug speciﬁ c and are not immediately predictable 
from their mechanisms of action. The organs most 
frequently affected include the skin, nerves, heart, 
lungs and blood vessels.

 Neurological  s ide  e ffects 
 Although only a few cytotoxics penetrate the cere-
brospinal ﬂ uid, many cytotoxics cause neurotoxic-
ity. Peripheral neuropathy, the most frequent 
neurotoxicity of chemotherapy, is commonly seen 
with vinca alkaloids, taxanes and platinum deriva-
tives. The longest nerves are most affected so it 
presents as a symmetrical sensory loss over the feet 
and hands. This may progress to worsening paraes-
thesia, loss of tendon reﬂ exes and eventually 
motor loss. Features usually slowly improve over 
several months following cessation of chemother-
apy, although residual deﬁ cits may persist indeﬁ -
nitely. The same cytotoxics may be responsible for 
an autonomic neuropathy leading to abdominal 
pain, constipation, paralytic ileus, urinary reten-
tion, bradycardia and postural hypotension. Acute 
encephalopathy most commonly is associated 
with ifosfamide and symptoms include confusion, 
agitation, seizures, somnolence and coma. Cere-
bellar toxicity may follow cytarabine therapy and 
5 - ﬂ uorouracil. Cisplatin - induced ototoxicity is 
characterized by the progressive loss of high - tone 
hearing and tinnitus. 
 The inadvertent intrathecal administration of 
vinca alkaloids is fatal and this catastrophic clini-
cal error has arisen because of confusion of the 
drug with a cytotoxic agent intended to be given 
intrathecally (usually methotrexate). Five such 
incidents have occurred in NHS hospitals in the 
past decade, representing an estimated rate of 
about three per 100   000 intrathecal chemotherapy 
treatments and recently resulting in the jailing of a 
junior doctor. A number of strict guidelines sur-
rounding the administration of intrathecal chem-
otherapy are now in place to prevent this 
occurrence. 
 Pulmonary  s ide  e ffects 
 Chronic pulmonary toxicity and ﬁ brosis occurs 
with a number of cytotoxics and the outcome is 
generally poor. Bleomycin is the most common 
culprit and the risk increases with dose. The cardi-
nal symptom of drug - induced pulmonary toxicity 
is dyspnoea associated with non - productive cough, 
 Dermatological  s ide  e ffects 
 Dermatological complications include the already 
mentioned acute complications of extravasation 
and anaphylaxis as well as idiosyncratic delayed 
toxicities. These include hyperpigmentation, 
which occurs commonly with 5 - ﬂ uorouracil and 
bleomycin and may follow the lines of the veins 
into which the chemotherapy has been adminis-
tered. A hand and foot syndrome of painful 
redness, scaling or shedding of the skin of the 
palms and soles may occur with continuous infu-
sions of 5 - ﬂ uorouracil chemotherapy and also with 
liposomal anthracycline chemotherapy. In the 
latter case, the cytotoxics are delivered in a lipo-
some to dramatically prolong their half - life, mim-
icking the pharmacokinetics of a continuous 
infusion regimen. A third unusual dermatological 
side effect of chemotherapy is radiation recall, an 
erythematous reaction of skin in the area of a pre-
vious radiation ﬁ eld. Indeed this may occur even 
when the radiation treatment was decades earlier 
and is most commonly seen with gemcitabine 
chemotherapy. 
 Cardiological  s ide  e ffects 
 Acute arrythmias can occur during chemotherapy 
infusions or shortly thereafter and this rare 
occurrence happens most frequently with taxanes. 
Similarly, 5 - ﬂ uorouracil rarely precipitates chest 
pain and acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis 
and cardiac shock. However, the most common 
cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy is a dose - related 
dilated cardiomyopathy seen with anthracyclines. 
This usually presents with heart failure within 
8 months of the last anthracycline dose. Diuretics 
improve symptoms and the early use of an 
angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor can 
increase the left ventricular ejection fraction, 
improving prognosis which, however, remains 
poor. This side effect limits the total cumulative 
dosage of anthracyclines that can be administered. 
The maximum cumulative lifetime doses of the 
anthracyclines have been established although 
cardiomyopathy may be seen at lower total 
doses.

develop over several weeks to months. The chest 
X - ray classically shows reticulonodular inﬁ ltration 
at the bases and occasionally pleural effusions 
(Figure  3.10 a). Lung function tests demonstrate a 
reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 
and restrictive ventilatory defects (Figure  3.10 b). 
The usual treatment is with corticosteroids 
although there is little to support this and the mor-
tality is high.  
 Hepatic  s ide  e ffects 
 Many cytotoxics cause elevated serum transami-
nases and bilirubin, and fatty inﬁ ltration and 
cholestasis may occur as the toxic effect progresses. 
Hepatic veno - occlusive disease (VOD) results from 
the blockage of venous outﬂ ow in the small centri-
lobular hepatic vessels following damage to cells in 
the area of the liver surrounding the central vein. 
This rare side effect occurs with high - dose chemo-
therapy often as part of stem cell transplantation. 
The clinical features are painful hepatomegaly, 
ascites, peripheral oedema, marked elevations in 
serum enzymes and bilirubin, and hepatic enceph-
alopathy. The onset is often abrupt, occurring 
during the ﬁ rst post - transplant week, and the clini-
cal course is fatal in up to 50%.  
 Late  s ide  e ffects 
 Gonadal  s ide  e ffects 
 Chemotherapy causes a variety of toxic effects on 
male and female gonads leading to infertility. 
Moreover, cytotoxic drugs given during pregnancy 
may have teratogenic effects on the fetus. If fertil-
ity is maintained or restored, there are concerns 
about the heritability of the cancer and at least a 
theoretical risk of mutagenic alterations to germ 
cells. 
 Adult  m ale  g onadal  t oxicity 
 Male germ cells lie within the seminiferous epithe-
lium and include stem spermatogonia, differentiat-
ing spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and 
sperm. The differentiating spermatogonia actively 
proliferate and are therefore highly susceptible to

to 5 years after chemotherapy, is usually asympto-
matic. As in men, alkylating agents are the major 
culprits causing permanent gonadal failure in 
women. At present ovum storage remains an unre-
liable method for routine usage and requires 
ovarian stimulation prior to egg harvesting, which 
introduces a delay prior to starting chemotherapy 
and is relatively contraindicated in breast cancer. 
The storage of fertilized eggs (embryos) is more 
successful. The Roman Catholic Church opposes 
all forms of  in vitro  fertilization and under the 
papacy of Benedict XVI has condemned the prac-
tice in the 2008 magisterial instruction  Dignitas 
Personae . 
 Teratogenicity of  c hemotherapy 
 Many cytotoxics are teratogenic in murine models 
although data in humans are thankfully limited. 
All alkylating agents are teratogenic with limited 
information suggesting a signiﬁ cant risk of mal-
formed infants if exposed in the ﬁ rst trimester 
but no increased risk during the second and third 
trimesters. Methotrexate is, of course, a potent 
abortifactant during early pregnancy. No clear evi-
dence is available to support the timing of preg-
nancy following chemotherapy although most 
clinicians advise a two to ﬁ ve - year gap before 
pregnancy 
 Carcinogenicity of  c hemotherapy 
 Many cytotoxic agents are genotoxic and this 
accounts for their antitumour activity but also 
carries the risk of inducing cancers; alkylating 
agents are the most potent carcinogens in this 
group (Table  3.13 ). The risk of induced malignan-
cies depends not only on the cytotoxics adminis-
tered but also on the initial cancer diagnosis, with 
greatest risks in patients with Hodgkin ’ s disease 
where the second malignancy rate is 10 – 15% after 
15 years. Two forms of secondary acute leukaemia 
following chemotherapy are widely recognized. 
Alkylating agents are carcinogenic with acute leu-
kaemias occurring in up to 5% three to ﬁ ve years 
after exposure and associated with chromosome 
cytotoxic agents. In contrast, the Leydig cells, 
which are in the interstitium and produce andro-
gens, and the Sertoli cells, which provide support 
and regulatory factors to the germ cells, do not pro-
liferate in adults and so survive most cytotoxic 
therapies. Because later stage germ cells (spermato-
cytes onwards) do not proliferate they are not sus-
ceptible to chemotherapy  – sperm counts do not 
fall immediately on starting chemotherapy, but 
may take two to three months to decline; although 
minor falls in testosterone production may occur, 
only testicular radiation will produce signiﬁ cant 
testosterone deﬁ ciency. Men due to start chemo-
therapy should be offered sperm storage in order to 
enable them to father children in the future. 
Modern developments in  in vitro  fertilization are 
particularly relevant to the cancer patient. For 
those patients who were considered to be unsuita-
ble for semen storage and remain azoospermic post 
treatment, the technique of intracytoplasmic 
sperm injection (ICSI) may be appropriate. Just 
remember, only one sperm is required to fertilize 
one ovum.  
 Adult  f emale  g onadal  t oxicity 
 In women, unlike men, the germ cells do not pro-
liferate whereas the somatic cells do and this 
accounts for the different gonadal toxicity of 
chemotherapy in women and men. Female germ 
cells proliferate before birth as oogonia that arrest 
at the oocyte stage. At birth, a woman has 1 million 
oocytes, which are reduced to 300   000 at puberty. 
Oocytes are progressively lost by atresia, develop-
ment and ovulation, until almost all are lost and 
menopause is reached. The interval from recruit-
ment of primordial follicles to ovulation is 82 days 
and when cytotoxics destroy maturing follicles, 
temporary amenorrhea results. However, if the 
number of remaining primordial follicles falls 
below the minimum number necessary for men-
strual cyclicity, irreversible ovarian failure occurs 
with permanent amenorrhea. This accounts for the 
increased risk of chemotherapy - induced meno-
pause in older patients. Permanent ovarian failure 
is often accompanied by vasomotor symptoms, 
whilst temporary amenorrhoea, which may last up

5q or 7 deletions (Figure  3.11 a). Survival after sec-
ondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is poor, 
usually only a few months. There is also an 
increased incidence of solid tumours after alkylat-
ing agents. Secondary acute leukaemia also occurs 
in patients treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors 
(Figure  3.11 b). These leukaemias occur early, two 
to three years after therapy, and are associated with 
translocations of 11q23 (MLL gene) or 21q22 
(AML1 gene). Data on the development of second-
ary solid tumours are less clear although cyclo-
phosphamide is linked to a four - fold relative risk 
of bladder cancer and appears to be related to 
cumulative dose. Antimetabolites are generally not 
thought to be carcinogenic.  
 There is something quite horrible about the 
development of second cancers after curative treat-
ment of a ﬁ rst cancer and for this reason effort has 
been expended in developing alternative treat-
ment programmes that are not associated with 
increased cancer risk. The development of second 
cancers used to be a problem of particular poign-
ancy in patients with Hodgkin ’ s disease. This 
tumour commonly occurs in younger people who 
are returned to a normal life expectancy until the 
unpleasantness of their presentation with a second 
cancer. The alternative programme, which is in 
current use for the treatment of Hodgkin ’ s disease, 
is called ABVD. This was originally introduced by a 
group of Italians, whose pronouncements about 
the effectiveness of ABVD chemotherapy were 
regarded with some scepticism by the medical 
community. However a randomized trial organ-
ized in North America showed that the Italians 
were right.  
 Psychiatric  d ysfunction 
 It is generally thought that patients who have 
cancer would tend to be more depressed than the 
population without malignancy. However, this is 
far from the truth. So far from the truth that it is a 
completely incorrect view. There is no difference 
in the incidence of mental illness in people affected 
with cancer than in a normal population. There is

function with even higher dosages of radiation 
therapy. 
 Gonadal  t oxicity in  c hildren 
 The germinal epithelium in the prepubertal testis 
does not appear to be any more resistant to cyto-
toxic therapy than in the adult and the sterilizing 
effects of chemotherapy on prepubertal boys may 
be predicted from data in adults. In contrast prepu-
bertal girls are less susceptible to ovarian failure 
than adult women. Most chemotherapy regimens 
do not cause failure of pubertal development and 
menarche. 
 Endocrine  t herapy 
 Endocrine therapy (or hormonal manipulation) is 
an important part of managing cancers whose 
growth is dependent on hormones, namely, breast 
and prostate cancers. The aims of endocrine 
therapy for cancer are to reduce the circulating 
levels of hormones or block their actions on the 
cancers. The origins of endocrine therapy for breast 
and prostate cancer come from surgical oophrec-
tomy and orchidectomy. 
 Breast  c ancer 
 In order to grow, many breast cancers that produce 
oestrogen receptors rely on supplies of oestrogen 
(Figure  3.12 ). Luteinizing hormone - releasing hor-
mone (LHRH) agonists such as goserelin cause 
downregulation of pituitary LHRH receptors and, 
via a decrease in LH/FSH (luteinizing hormone/
follicle - stimulating hormone), to a reduced plasma 
oestradiol. This is used in the neoadjuvant, adju-
vant and palliative setting in premenopausal 
women. Tamoxifen binds to oestrogen receptors 
and prevents oestradiol binding. It is used in the 
neoadjuvant, adjuvant and palliative setting in 
postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors, 
such as anastrozole, bind and inhibit aromatase 
enzyme in peripheral tissues including adipose 
tissue, which converts androstenedione and testo-
sterone and other androgens into oestradiol and 
oestrone. This is the major source of oestradiol syn-
thesis in postmenopausal women. They are used in 
controversy around the association between pre -
 morbid psychiatric conditions and the develop-
ment of cancer. The only malignancy in which 
there has been shown to be an association is breast 
cancer, where early work described a link between 
pre - morbid depression and breast cancer. The link 
is slight. Patients with cancer go through a series of 
mental changes around the time of their diagnosis. 
Each of these stages may be protracted, even to the 
extent that the patient remains unable to grow 
beyond that particular phase. These symptoms are 
symptoms of a grief response as seen in many other 
situations. Initially patients deal with malignancy 
by denial. They next move to a grief response, pro-
gressing from there to acceptance of their own 
situations. 
 Delayed  s ide  e ffects in  c hildren 
 Growth  d isorders in  c hildren 
 Both growth disorders and mental changes are 
problems that come chieﬂ y as a result of the use of 
radiotherapy in childhood. Irradiation of the chest 
in the treatment of Hodgkin ’ s disease is associated 
with destruction of the growing plates of the 
vertebrae and ribs, and dysmorphic appearance in 
later life. For this reason treatment with spinal 
radiotherapy is generally avoided in leukaemia and 
lymphoma occurring in childhood, with chemo-
therapy the preferred option.  
 Mental  c hange in  c hildren 
 Cerebral radiotherapy given as part of prophylaxis 
for central nervous system recurrence of leukaemia 
may also cause signiﬁ cant problems. These prob-
lems are not generally of growth or of hormonal 
function, as the pituitary is relatively resistant to 
radiation. 
However 
personality 
defects 
are 
described with increased incidence, as are global 
loss of cerebral function manifesting as a less than 
expected IQ, personality change and occasionally 
ﬁ ts. Although relatively resistant to radiation 
therapy, pituitary function can be damaged with 
loss of the gonadotrophs leading to failure to 
achieve puberty. Loss of thyroid - stimulating 
hormone (TSH) production occurs with high 
dosage radiotherapy and loss of posterior pituitary

the palliative setting for women whose disease 
progresses on tamoxifen. All the above drugs can 
cause menopausal symptoms, namely hot ﬂ ushes, 
sweats and vaginal dryness. Speciﬁ c and important 
adverse effects of tamoxifen are thromboembolic 
disease and uterine carcinoma.  
 Prostate  c ancer 
 The growth of prostatic carcinoma is under the 
control of androgens, hence the aim of hormonal 
therapy is to reduce testosterone levels or prevent 
it binding to the androgen receptor. LHRH ago-
nists cause downregulation of pituitary LHRH 
receptors and via a decrease in LH to a reduced 
serum testosterone and tissue dehydrotestosterone 
(Figure  3.13 ). The adverse effects are impotence, 
loss of libido, gynaecomastia and hot ﬂ ushes. 
Tumour ﬂ are, an increase in tumour size which can 
cause symptoms such as increase in bone pain and 
spinal cord compression, can occur with the initial 
use of these drugs, due to an initial increase in tes-
tosterone. Therefore an anti - androgen such as 
bicalutamide, cyproterone and ﬂ utamide should 
be prescribed for a few weeks before LHRH agonists 
to prevent this happening. Anti - androgens act by 
blocking and preventing testosterone from attach-
ing to the receptors in prostate cancer cells (Figure 
 3.13 ). The adverse effects of anti - androgens are 
hepatotoxcity, gynaecomastia, diarrhoea and 
abdominal pain. Combined androgen blockade (or 
maximal androgen blockade) is a term used to 
describe the use of an LHRH agonist and androgen 
receptor antagonist together. These agents are used 
alone or in combination for either locally advanced 
or metastatic prostate cancer.

 Immunological  t herapy 
 As far back as the 1700s, it was recorded that certain 
infectious diseases could exert a beneﬁ cial thera-
peutic effect upon malignancy. Most prominent 
among the clinicians aiming to take advantage of 
these observations was a New York surgeon, 
William B. Coley. He used a bacterial vaccine to 
treat inoperable cancers and in 1893 reported high 
cure rates. Although a central role for the immune 
system in the surveillance and eradication of 
tumours has been postulated since then, immuno-
therapy has only a minor place in the treatment of 
cancers. Support for any role of immunity in the 
control of cancer comes from a number of observa-
tions. For some malignancies, a dense inﬁ ltration 
of lymphocytes in the tumour imparts a better 
prognosis. Cultivating and re - infusing these 
tumour - inﬁ ltrating 
lymphocytes 
occasionally 
results in some regression of the tumour. Con-
versely, people with immunodeﬁ ciencies have 
higher rates of cancers, however in general these 
tumours are less common cancers that are caused 
by oncogenic viruses. Both passive and active spe-
ciﬁ c immunotherapy and non - speciﬁ c immuno-
therapy have a limited role in the management of 
cancer. 
 Passive  s peciﬁ c  i mmunotherapy 
 Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal anti-
bodies is an established treatment for breast cancer 
and non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma. Monoclonal anti-
bodies are produced by a single clone of B cells and 
may be humanized to reduce their immunogenic-
ity. In 1975, Georges Kohler and Cesar Milstein 
developed a procedure to fuse myeloma cells with 
B - lymphocyte cells from the spleen of immunized 
mice. These fused hybridoma cell clones retained 
the ever - living characteristics of myeloma cells and

 Several monoclonal antibodies are currently 
widely used in oncology and have been genetically 
modiﬁ ed to reduce the murine origins to prevent 
the development of host antibodies against the 
mouse sequences of the anibodies (Figure  3.14 ), for 
example rituximab and trastuzumab (Box  3.2 ). 
Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody 
directed against CD20, a protein expressed on 
pre - B and mature B cells. This is non - speciﬁ c as it 
will ablate both normal and malignant B cells. 
However, the normal cells are subsequently regen-
erated by the bone marrow from normal stem cells. 
It is effective in low - grade and follicular non - Hodg-
kin ’ s lymphoma. Trastuzumab is a humanized 
monoclonal antibody directed against human epi-
dermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is 
overexpressed in 30% of breast cancers and is asso-
ciated with a poorer prognosis. It is used in meta-
static breast cancer that is HER2 positive. Both 
these drugs can cause ﬂ u - like symptoms on infu-
sion, such as chills and pyrexia. In addition, trastu-
zumab has been noted to be cardiotoxic, especially 
when given with anthracyclines.  
 Active  s peciﬁ c  i mmunotherapy 
 Active cellular immunotherapy involves the har-
vesting and  ex vivo  activation (in the test tube) of 
lymphokine - activated killer (LAK) cells (cytokine

primed immune cells) and is an experimental treat-
ment for renal cancers and melanoma. Other trial 
active immunotherapies include tumour vaccines 
and this technology is most often studied in the 
tumour types where occasional spontaneous 
regressions have been documented.  
 Non - s peciﬁ c  i mmunotherapy 
 Global stimulation of the host cellular immune 
system in order to promote tumour rejection was 
probably the basis of Coley ’ s adjuvant therapy. 
This has been replaced with the use of bacillus Cal-
mette – Guerin (BCG), which is administered intra-
vesically (via a catheter into the bladder) to prevent 
recurrence of superﬁ cial bladder cancers, and inter-
ferons and intereukins. 
 Interferon 
 There are three human interferons: 
  ●    Interferon alpha (IFN - α ) produced by leukocytes  
  ●    Interferon beta (IFN - β ) produced by ﬁ broblasts  
  ●    Interferon gamma (IFN - γ ) produced by T 
lymphocytes. 
 IFN - α is licensed for use currently and may act by 
enhancing the expression of human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) antigens by tumour cells leading to 
increased recognition and lysis by cytotoxic T cells 
and natural killer cells. Only IFN - α is used in the 
treatment of cancers, including hairy cell leukae-
mia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, melanoma, renal 
cell cancer and Kaposi ’ s sarcoma. The adverse 
effects of IFN - α are ﬂ u - like symptoms, fatigue and 
myelosuppression. 
 Interleukin - 2 
 Interleukin - 2 (IL - 2) is a cytokine produced pre-
dominantly by activated CD4+ helper T lym-
phocytes that have been stimulated by antigen. It 
acts via a cell surface receptor expressed also on 
activated T cells thus behaving as an autocrine 
growth factor. In response to IL - 2, CD4+ helper T 
cells are capable of differentiating from an initial 
common state (T H 0) into one of two apparently 
distinct types called T H 1 and T H 2. The T H 1 pathway 
is essentially cell - mediated immunity, with the 
activation of macrophages, natural killer cells, 
cytotoxic T cells and a prolonged inﬂ ammatory 
response. The T H 2 pathway is essentially a humoral 
pathway, with the production of cytokines, which 
promote B - cell growth and the production of anti-
bodies. IL - 2 causes the growth and proliferation of 
activated T cells thus expanding tumouricidal LAK 
cells and may be used to treat melanoma and renal 
cell cancers. The adverse effects of IL - 2 are ﬂ uid 
retention, multiorgan dysfunction and bone 
marrow and hepatic toxicity.  
 Protein  k inase  i nhibitor  t herapy 
 Protein kinase enzymes phosphorylate the amino 
acid residues of their substrates, usually tyrosine, 
serine or threonine. The human genome includes 
about 500 protein kinases and perhaps 30% of all 
human proteins may be modiﬁ ed by phosphoryla-
tion, which may result in functional changes. 
Phosphorylation of substrate proteins may alter 
their enzyme activity, cellular location or associa-
tion with other proteins and this is especially 
important in cellular pathways such as signal 
transduction that are dysregulated in cancer cells. 
Protein kinase inihitors are a relatively new and 
rapidly expanding class of drugs used in cancer 
treatment and include both monoclonal antibod-
ies ( - mabs) and small molecules ( - nibs) (Table 
 3.14 ). In general, nibs target tyrosine kinase 
domains whilst mabs target the ligand - binding 
domains of receptors. Many of these novel agents 
have been developed using knowledge of the 
biology of tumours to target speciﬁ c pathways in 
cancer cells. It was anticipated that this would have 
the added beneﬁ t of minimizing toxicity although 
some unexpected side effects have emerged such as 
the cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab.  
 Clinical  t rials 
 As new cytotoxic drugs are developed and other 
novel agents are found it is essential to evaluate 
their potential in a structured fashion in clinical 
trials. A stepwise progression has been introduced 
that includes three phases of clinical trials. Phase I

trials determine the toxicity, including the dose -
 limiting toxicities and the dose scheduling of a 
new agent. They enrol a small number of patients 
with resistant tumours. Phase II studies are 
designed to identify promising tumour types using 
the dosing regimens established from the phase I 
trials. Phase III trials are larger randomized com-
parisons that allocate patients either to the new 
treatment or the established standard therapy. In 
all phases of clinical trials evaluations of response 
and toxicity are according to well - established 
standards. The side effects are measured using the 
Common Toxicity Criteria scale that rates the 
severity of side effects on a four point scale. The 
response to treatment is assessed using the RECIST 
(response evaluation criteria in solid tumours) cri-
teria which are largely radiological and clinical 
measurements of the tumour size before and after 
treatment. A complete response is deﬁ ned as the 
complete disappearance of all known disease, 
whilst a partial response roughly equates to a 
greater than 50% reduction in the size of measura-
ble lesions with no new ones appearing. Although 
there is considerable debate as to whether these 
response criteria are appropriate for some of the 
novel therapies such as anti - angiogenic treat-
ments, they are currently necessary for licensing 
approval of cancer drugs. The aims of clinical trials 
of a new agent include proving that it works, 
obtaining a license from the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in the USA and the Euro-
pean Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) as well 
as making money. In most cases all the goals are 
complementary, however there are examples from 
the biotechnology boom of the 1990s where 
making money appeared to be the sole objective 
and venture capitalists made fortunes without a 
drug ever achieving clinical use or beneﬁ ting any 
patients. 
 Randomized clinical trials are needed to estab-
lish evidence - based treatment protocols as well 
as determining the value of new agents. Large 
clinical trials are a major focus of clinical activity 
in oncology and patients are actively encouraged 
to participate in studies. The principles that under-
lie clinical trial management are outlined within 
Box  3.3 . 
 Palliative  c are 
 Although it is widely held that palliative care is 
only offered when there is no chance of cure, this 
attitude risks denying patients adequate analgesia 
and supportive care irrespective of their prognosis. 
The concept that palliative care to provide optimal 
symptom control and enhanced quality of life 
should only be available to those patients with 
advanced disease is ridiculous. The integration of 
palliative care into the early management of 
patients with cancer is recognized as beneﬁ ting

 Box 3.3:   Does it work? 
 The value of a diagnostic test in clinical medicine depends upon whether the result means what you think it does and 
nowhere is this more relevant than in screening tests. The usefulness depends upon three factors, the sensitivity and 
speciﬁ city of the test and the population prevalence of the condition. 
 Sensitivity 
 The sensitivity of a test is the ability of a test to pick up a condition: 
  ●    Sensitivity  =  number of true cases detected/all true cases.  
 A test that is 95% sensitive will detect 95% of all cases (or, put another way, miss 5% of cases).  
 Speciﬁ city 
 The speciﬁ city of a test is the probability that a negative test is a true negative: 
  ●    Speciﬁ city  =  number of true negatives detected/all true negatives.  
 A 75% speciﬁ city means that 75% of all negative tests are true negatives, or conversely that 25% of negative tests are 
actually positive for a condition.  
 Usefulness 
 The practical usefulness of a test in a given population can be summarized using: 
  ●    Positive predictive value (the chance that a positive will be a true positive in that population)   =  true cases detected/all 
positive test results (true positives and false postitives)  
  ●    Negative predictive value (the chance that a negative will be a true negative in that population)   =  true negative results/
all negative test results (true negatives and false negatives).  
 Prevalence and  i ncidence 
  ●    Prevalence  =  frequency of a condition in the community at a given point in time (e.g. the prevalence of cancer in 
children in the USA is one in 330 children  < 19 years)  
  ●    Incidence  =  frequency of a disease occurring over a period in time (e.g. the incidence of breast cancer in England in 
1998 was 131/100   000 females).  
 Running a  t rial 
 Ethics 
 The Declaration of Helsinki outlines an international basis of ethical clinical research. It describes the rights of patients 
including the right to abstain from a study, access to adequate information about both potential beneﬁ ts and hazards of 
involvement, the right to withdraw from the trial at any time and ﬁ nally the desirability of giving written informed 
consent prior to enrolment. In the UK, research trials must be submitted to research ethics committees for review.  
 Trial  d esign 
  ●    Phase I trials determine the relationship between toxicity and dose schedules of treatment  
  ●    Phase II trials identify tumour types for which the treatment appears promising  
  ●    Phase III trials assess the efﬁ cacy of treatment compared to standard treatment including toxicity.  
 Randomization 
 Proper randomization should ensure unbiased comparisons. It achieves control for both known and unknown confound-
ing factors.  
 Control 
 Controlled trials compare a  ‘ new ’  test therapy with an existing treatment  – either active or placebo.  
 Blinding 
 In double blinded trials neither the patient nor the doctor knows which treatment is being administered.  
(continued on p. 75)

 Sample  s ize 
 The number of patients (sample size) required in a trial will depend on the number of events (deaths or relapses) pre-
dicted in each arm and the difference that you wish to be able to demonstrate between the two arms of the trial. If you 
wish to detect a small difference between the two groups, more patients are needed.  
 Analysis 
 Intention to treat analysis compares outcomes between all patients originally allocated one treatment with all patients 
allocated to the other treatment.  
 Endpoints 
 Clinical trial endpoints include overall survival duration, disease - free survival, time to disease progression, response rate, 
quality of life measures, adverse effects and treatment toxicity. The efﬁ cacy of treatment may be measured using the 
response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria, which evaluate response in terms of radiological and clini-
cal tumour shrinkage. The deﬁ nitions broadly are: 
  ●    Complete response: disappearance of all known disease  
  ●    Partial response:  > 50% reduction in measurable lesions and no new lesions  
  ●    Stable disease: lesions unchanged ( < 50% smaller or  < 25% larger)  
  ●    Progressive disease: new lesions or measurable lesions  > 25% larger.  
 CTC   t oxicity  s cales 
 Grading scales exist to compare the side effects of treatments in trials including the common toxicity criteria (CTC).  
 Interpreting the  r esults 
 Evidence - b ased  m edicine 
 Over the last two decades there have been numerous advances in evidence processing, including the production of 
streamlined guides to aid critical appraisal of the literature, evidence - based abstraction services, online and other forms 
of electronic literature searching, growing numbers of high - quality systematic reviews, and frequently updated text-
books in paper and electronic formats. All these initiatives have contributed to the emergence of evidence - based medi-
cine as the optimal framework for clinical management.  
 Meta - a nalysis 
 Combining published data into a meta - analysis to provide an evidence base for clinical management is widely advocated. 
A meta - analysis may provide a more precise, less biased and more complete assessment of the available information than 
individual studies. However, the preferential publication of striking results in small studies and non - publication of larger 
negative studies ( ‘ publication bias ’ ) may skew meta - analyses. Thus the reliability of a meta - analysis depends on the 
quality and quantity of the data that go into it.  
 Bias 
 Bias in a study is a design ﬂ aw that results in an inevitable likelihood that the wrong result may be obtained. Bias cannot 
be controlled for at the analysis stage.  
 Potential  b iases in  s creening for  c ancer 
 Screening should reduce mortality but the following should be considered: 
 1.   Lead time bias : the diagnosis of disease is made earlier in the screened group, resulting in an apparent increase in 
survival time, although the time of death is the same in both groups.

patients and encouraging a more holistic attitude 
to their care. The discipline of palliative care 
throughout the globe owes much to the pioneer-
ing work of Dame Cecily Saunders. She started life 
as a nurse during the Second World War and subse-
quently worked as a social worker before training 
in medicine, which she viewed then as the only 
route to change the care of the dying. She advo-
cated above all else listening to patients as the best 
way to care for them. In 1967 she established the 
ﬁ rst hospice in the world, St Christopher ’ s Hospice 
in London, in order to meet the needs of the dying 
patient, which are so often left unmet in a hospital. 
The hospice movement developed a comprehen-
sive approach to dealing with the variety of symp-
toms experienced by patients with progressive 
debilitating illness including promoting the safe 
use of opiate analgesia. This attitude has been 
developed to deliver whole person care and to view 
the patient not in isolation but as part of a social 
unit that includes also family and friends. 
 Pain is the most feared and most common 
symptom of advanced malignancy and emotional, 
spiritual and psychological components may 
intensify physical pain. In Mother Teresa ’ s Home 
for the Dying, the homeless of Kolkata (formerly 
Calcutta) were denied any analgesia other than 
aspirin and often suffered unnecessarily with great 
pain in the pursuit of austere religion. The relief of 
pain should therefore be viewed as part of a com-
prehensive pattern of care encompassing all 
aspects of suffering. The physical component of 
pain cannot be treated in isolation, nor can a 
patient ’ s anxieties be effectively addressed whilst 
they are suffering physically. It is obvious under 
these circumstances that a multidisciplinary 
approach is required. In addition to pain relief, 
expertise in the management of other common 
symptoms is essential including constipation, diar-
rhoea, nausea, vomiting, dyspnoea and fatigue. In 
some circumstances surgery or radiotherapy may 
provide valuable symptomatic palliation, for 
example for the relief of spinal cord compression. 
Moreover in selected circumstances palliative 
chemotherapy is indicated even if the term seems 
to be a clinical oxymoron. 
 The delivery of palliative care until recently has 
been hospice based. However, the hospice concept 
has now extended to both the acute hospital and 
community settings, where specialist teams work 
in partnership with primary care teams in the 
delivery of palliative care. Community - based pal-
liative care may enable patients to die at home or at 
least remain at home for as long as possible, which 
has long been known to be the favoured option of 
most patients.

 Psychological  c arcinogenic  r isk  f actors 
 There is a great deal of speculation and anecdotal 
evidence connecting psychological factors and 
both the risk of developing cancer and its progno-
sis. Much of the research on the relationship 
between stressful life experiences and the onset of 
cancer has been poorly designed. However, the few 
well - conducted trials have failed to establish a link. 
A large study of women with newly diagnosed 
breast cancer found that women who have a 
severely stressful life experience in the year before 
the diagnosis or in the ﬁ ve years afterwards, do not 
seem to be at increased risk of developing a recur-
rence of the disease. Moreover, a meta - analysis 
addressed the inﬂ uence of psychological coping 
strategies (including ﬁ ghting spirit, helplessness/
hopelessness, denial and avoidance) on cancer sur-
vival and recurrence. This meta - analysis found 
that there was little consistent evidence that psy-
chological coping styles play an important part in 
survival from or recurrence of cancer.  
 Psychological  d istress in  c ancer  p atients 
 Psychological distress is frequent in patients with 
cancer and is often overlooked or even deliberately 
neglected by clinicians. However, over the last few 
decades, more oncologists have appreciated that 
psychological distress and psychiatric disorders 
such as anxiety, depression and delirium (in hospi-
talized patients) are frequent co - morbid condi-
tions. Increasingly, the outcome measures in 
clinical trials of new therapies have included 
quality of life evaluation and not just assessed sur-
vival endpoints. A number of factors have been 
found to be associated with an increased risk of 
psychological distress in patients with cancer 
(Table  4.1 ). Clinical features of anxiety include 
anorexia, fatigue, loss of libido, weight loss, anhe-
donia, insomnia and suicidal ideation. Many of 
these key symptoms are at times attributed to the 
cancer and as few as one - third of cancer patients 
who might beneﬁ t from antidepressants are pre-
scribed them.  
 As well as pharmacological treatments, psycho-
logical interventions are frequently employed in 
the care of people with cancer. These interventions 
have a positive effect on psychological morbidity 
and functional adjustment and may ameliorate 
disease and treatment - related symptoms. The most 
useful psychological intervention appears to be a 
group of treatments termed cognitive - behavioural 
psychotherapy. These include behaviour therapy,

found to have greater problems in obtaining 
employment and keeping jobs and these may be 
compounded by frequent follow - up clinic visits.  
 Breaking  b ad  n ews 
 Medical students have identiﬁ ed breaking bad 
news as their greatest fear in terms of communicat-
ing with patients, and in the ﬁ rst half of the 20th 
century it was routine practice to hide the diagno-
sis from patients with cancer. It is uncertain 
whether this was a paternalistic policy to protect 
the patient or because physicians avoided a difﬁ -
cult task that many found unpleasant (and one 
that might lead them to question their practices). 
Although many students believe that good com-
munication skills are innate, it is clear that like so 
many things the techniques can be taught and 
learnt (Table  4.2 ). The way in which the diagnosis 
is communicated to patients is an important deter-
minant of subsequent psychological stress and, 
even if patients recall little of the conversation that 
followed, they state that the competence of the 
doctor at breaking bad news is critical to establish-
ing trust. Why do doctors fear breaking bad news? 
Obviously the information causes pain and distress 
to patients and their relatives, making us feel 
uncomfortable. We fear being blamed and provok-
ing an emotional reaction. Breaking bad news 
reminds us of our own mortality and fears of our 
own death. Finally, we often worry about being 
unable to answer a patient ’ s difﬁ cult questions 
since we never know what the future holds for 
either our patients or ourselves. Breaking bad news 
behaviour modiﬁ cation and cognitive therapy in 
various combinations. In behavioural therapy, a 
formal analysis of the patient ’ s problem leads to an 
individualized programme of techniques aimed at 
changing their behaviour. Cognitive therapies 
explore how thoughts inﬂ uence feelings and 
behaviour and aim to modify thought processes 
directly. These therapies consist of identifying 
maladaptive thought patterns (such as hopeless-
ness in depression) and teaching patients to recog-
nize and challenge these. Probably the most widely 
employed psychosocial intervention for cancer 
patients is supportive counselling that along with 
information and patient education empowers 
patients. 
 Psychosocial  p roblems in 
 c ancer  s urvivors 
 Even after successful curative treatment of cancer, 
patients continue to suffer psychological morbid-
ity. The psychological sequelae in cancer survivors 
may relate to the illness and its treatment as well as 
family and personal issues. The majority of chil-
dren who survive cancer cope well with long - term 
adjustment although adults generally fare less 
well. Three well - recognized scenarios in this 
context are: 
  ●    The Lazarus syndrome (difﬁ culty with returning 
to normal life) 
  ●    The Damocles syndrome (fear of recurrence and 
terror of minor symptoms)  
  ●    The survivor syndrome (guilt about surviving 
where others have died).  
 Cancer survivors also suffer social problems 
including ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, particularly with 
insurance and mortgages. They have also been

surance but the temptation must be resisted as you 
will not be doing your patient a favour in the long 
run. After answering the patient ’ s enquiries, it 
should be possible to synthesize their concerns and 
medical issues into a concrete plan. Even in the 
bleakest of situations setting short - term achievable 
plans leaves the patient with a goal for the future 
and hope. The plan should include an explicit 
arrangement for following up the conversation 
and a method for the patient to contact you if 
something arises before the next planned visit.  
 Coping  s trategies 
 Increased interaction and empathy with cancer 
patients has costs to health care professionals that 
need to be appreciated and addressed. Improved 
communications brings health care professionals 
closer to the patient and may increase feelings of 
inadequacy when faced with insoluble issues and 
of failure when patients die. Health care profes-
sionals dealing with dying patients and their fami-
lies risk burn - out and although the medical 
profession is notoriously resistant to external help, 
a team spirit, adequate training through commu-
nication workshops and peer support are impor-
tant elements in coping with these emotional 
stresses. Another technique that is frequently 
employed is distancing, which may protect the 
doctors from their feelings but often reduces their 
compassion and their capacity to care for patients. 
Although the burden of caring for people with 
cancer falls most heavily on doctors and nurses, 
other staff members may also be affected. Indeed, 
when patients are dying their distress and that of 
their care givers trickles down to everyone in the 
clinic or ward.  
 Medical  b urn - o ut 
 The depletion of physical and mental resources 
induced by excessive striving to reach an often 
unrealistic work - related goal is termed burn - out. 
Burn - out of staff working in cancer care is common 
and victims often describe themselves as worka-
holics. The Maslach burn - out inventory is a tool 
that measures burn - out and a quarter of consultant 
to patients should not involve protecting them 
from the truth but rather imparting the informa-
tion in a sensitive manner at the patient ’ s own 
pace. 
 Breaking bad news to patients requires prepara-
tion and this aspect is very often overlooked. The 
setting for these discussions should be quiet, com-
fortable and conﬁ dential so that the whole ward 
does not eavesdrop and so that your bleep and 
mobile phone do not constantly intrude. An ade-
quate period of time (at least 30 minutes) should be 
set aside and the patient should be asked if she/he 
wants someone else present. The conversation 
should open with a question to ﬁ nd out how much 
the patient already knows. An open question such 
as  ‘ What have you already been told about your 
illness? ’ can reveal not only what has been said and 
how much has been understood but also the emo-
tional state of the patient ( ‘ I ’ m so terriﬁ ed it ’ s 
cancer ’ ). This opening gambit frequently takes care 
of much of the hard work for you ( ‘ I think it ’ s 
cancer but the doctors do seem to want to say ’ ). 
Under these circumstances the diagnosis can be 
conﬁ rmed in an empathetic fashion. If this initial 
question does not open up a useful avenue, a 
warning shot should be ﬁ red off ( ‘ I have the results 
of your biopsy and I ’ m afraid that the news is not 
good ’ ). Following this warning shot, wait for the 
patient to respond and check if the patient wants 
to be told more. This cycle of warning shot, pause 
and checking should be repeated when elaborating 
on details of the diagnosis and treatment options. 
In this way the patient determines how much 
information is delivered. Certainly long mono-
logues are overwhelming and confusing and it is 
hopeless and insensitive to use this opportunity 
to try and teach pathophysiology. Learning to 
identify and acknowledge a patient ’ s reaction is 
essential to breaking bad news. In general, prog-
nostication with respect to  ‘ how long have I got 
Doc? ’ and the quoting of ﬁ ve - year - mortality statis-
tics are rarely helpful. Few doctors can explain the 
implications of skewed distributions, medians and 
conﬁ dence intervals, let alone in a way that is 
accessible to patients. Many patients will ask for 
these predictions hoping for reassurance. In these 
circumstances it is always easier to give false reas-

domain of healing resources that encompasses all 
health systems, modalities and practices and their 
accompanying theories and beliefs, other than 
those intrinsic to the politically dominant health 
system of a particular society or culture in a given 
historical period. Thus, whilst orthodox medicine 
is politically dominant, CAM practices outside this 
system and is, for the most part, isolated from the 
universities and hospitals where health care is 
taught and delivered. As some CAM disciplines 
(e.g. acupuncture) become increasingly incorpo-
rated into conventional medicine they therefore 
loose their  ‘ alternative ’  status. Indeed it is this co -
 operation of health systems that led to the intro-
duction of the term  ‘ complementary medicine ’ 
rather than the title  ‘ alternative medicine ’ . 
 Every year around 20% of the population in the 
UK use CAM and this is interpreted as a measure of 
disillusion with conventional medicine. In con-
trast, the prevalence of use in the USA is 40% and 
in Germany is  > 60%. There is a prolonged history 
in Germany of CAM use and indeed Samuel 
Hahnemann (1755 – 1843), who ﬁ rst described 
homoeopathy (Box  4.1 ), was a German physician. 
The pantheon of complementary and alternative 
therapies includes alternative therapies with 
oncologists in the UK have scores that denote this. 
The consequences of medical burn - out include 
emotional exhaustion leading to psychological 
detachment from patients and the sensation that 
little is being achieved in terms of personal accom-
plishment. This may account for the high fre-
quency of experienced oncologists changing roles 
in their 50s, taking on management positions or 
jobs with cancer charities or immersing themselves 
increasingly in research rather than patient 
contact. 
 Unconventional  t reatments 
 The unmet emotional needs of patients have been 
held responsible for the increasing use of uncon-
ventional treatments for cancer. The void that 
patients may feel at a vulnerable stage in their lives 
may be ﬁ lled with complementary treatments, 
alternative therapies or quackery. 
 Complementary and  a lternative 
 t herapies 
 According to the Cochrane Project, complemen-
tary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad 
 Box 4.1:   Homoeopathy  – does it work? 
 The underlying principle of homoeopathic medicine is the use of extremely low - dose preparations prescribed according 
to the belief that like should be cured with like (readers may wish to refer to the Mitchell and Webb sketch  ‘ Homeopathic 
A & E ’  on youtube). Treatments are chosen according to the symptoms that they elicit when administered to healthy 
people. Since raw onions cause crying, stinging eyes and a runny nose,  Allium cepa  (derived from onions) is used as a 
homoeopathic remedy for hayfever. The most notorious experimental trial that attempted to explain the mechanism of 
action of homoeopathy was undertaken by Jacques Benveniste. He hypothesized that water had the ability to remember 
solutes that had been dissolved in it after ﬁ nding that very dilute solutions of allergens could elicit basophil responses. In 
a show trial experiment, the then editor of  Nature Sir John Maddox brought a team of independent referees to observe 
the experiments in Benveniste ’ s laboratory. The observers included James Randi, a magician and investigator of the 
paranormal, and under his scrutiny Benveniste ’ s team were unable to repeat the ﬁ ndings. Since that failure, Benveniste 
has continued to pursue the storage of memory in water, claiming to be able to store an electronic record in water that 
can be transferred back into an email format. These claims have been met with even greater scepticism and have earned 
him an unprecedented second IgNobel Prize. 
 Despite these claims the most widely believed theory of the mechanism of homoeopathy remains a placebo effect and 
more effort has been focused on establishing the efﬁ cacy of homoeopathy. A meta - analysis, published in the  Lancet , 
examined over 100 randomized, placebo - controlled trials and found a signiﬁ cant odds ratio of 2.45 in favour of homoe-
opathy. Homoeopathic medicines can be purchased over the counter at chemists and health stores. In contrast to other 
forms of CAM, homoeopathy is supported by the NHS through both the National Homoeopathic Hospital in London and 
the fact that homoeopathic remedies may be prescribed on the NHS by any doctor registered with the General Medical 
Council.

 Box 4.2:   Acupuncture 
 Acupuncture originated over 2000 years ago in China. It was used by William Osler, the celebrated Canadian - born physi-
cian who was both Chief of Staff at Johns Hopkins University and subsequently Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford 
University at the start of the 20th century. The recent resurgence in popularity of acupuncture dates from President 
Nixon ’ s visit to China in the 1970s. The stimulation of acupuncture points by ﬁ ne needles is intended to control the Qi 
energy circulating between organs along channels or meridians. The 12 main meridians correspond to the 12 major 
functions or  ‘ organs ’ of the body and acupuncture points are located along these meridians. The analgesic actions of 
acupuncture may be explained by a conventional physiological gating model and acupuncture is known to release 
endogenous opioids. There is convincing evidence supporting the value of acupuncture in the management of both 
nausea and acute pain. The evidence base for the use of acupuncture in chronic pain is less secure and current evidence 
suggests that it is unlikely to be of beneﬁ t for obesity, smoking cessation and tinnitus. For most other conditions the 
available evidence is insufﬁ cient to guide clinical decisions. Acupuncture appears to be a relatively safe treatment in the 
hands of suitably qualiﬁ ed practitioners, with serious adverse events being extremely rare. It has been estimated that 1 
million acupuncture treatments are given on the NHS in England each year, at an estimated cost of  £ 26 million, equiva-
lent to all other complementary therapies combined. A further 2 million acupuncture treatments are given in the private 
sector annually.  
 Box 4.3:   Herbalism 
 The most widely used herbalism in the UK is Chinese and 
derives from the Daoist concepts of balancing the yin 
and yang elements of Qi energy. The revenue from 
herbal products in the UK exceeds  £ 40 million per year. 
Perhaps the most familiar example of herbal medicine is 
the use of St John ’ s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) for 
treating mild to moderate depression. Systematic reviews 
of randomized controlled trials conﬁ rm its efﬁ cacy over 
placebo and its equivalence to amitryptilline with fewer 
side effects. St John ’ s wort is, however, not free of side 
effects and has important drug interactions caused by 
inducing hepatic microsomal enzymes. Other more 
severe toxicities have been described with herbal medi-
cines including rapidly progressive interstitial renal ﬁ bro-
sis in several women after taking Chinese herbs 
containing powdered extracts of  Stephania tetrandra 
prescribed by a slimming clinic.  
recognized professional bodies (e.g. acupuncture 
(Box  4.2 ), chiropractic, herbal medicine (Box  4.3 ), 
homoeopathy, osteopathy), complementary ther-
apies (e.g. Alexander technique, aromatherapy, 
Bach and other ﬂ ower extracts, body work thera-
pies including massage, counselling stress therapy, 
hypnotherapy, meditation, reﬂ exology, shiatsu, 
healing, Maharishi Ayurvedic medicine, nutri-
tional medicine, yoga), alternative therapies that 
lack professional organization but have established 
and traditional systems of health care (e.g. anthro-
posophical 
medicine, 
Ayurvedic 
medicine, 
Chinese herbal medicine, Eastern medicine (Tibb), 
naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine) and, 
ﬁ nally, there are other  ‘ new age ’ alternative disci-
plines (e.g. crystal therapy, dowsing, iridology, 
kinesiology, radionics).  
 Many doctors remain concerned about the use of 
complementary and alternative medicines. These 
concerns may be based on a number of factors 
including that patients may be seen by unqualiﬁ ed 
practitioners, may risk delayed or missed diagno-
sis, may decline or stop conventional therapies, 
may waste money on ineffective therapies and 
may experience dangerous adverse effects from 
treatment. Moreover, the scientiﬁ c academic train-
ing in medicine leads many doctors to question the 
value of those therapies where a plausible mecha-
nism of action is not available. At present practi-
tioners of CAM in the UK are free to practice as they 
wish without clear regulation; greater co - operation 
and respect between conventional doctors and 
complementary therapists would improve patient 
care. 
 Quackery 
 The word quack is supposedly derived from 
 ‘ quacksalver ’ , a 17th century variant spelling of 
quicksilver or mercury, which was used in certain 
remedies that the public came to recognize as

 Box 4.4:   The Luigi Di Bella cure 
 This treatment is named after its proponent, Professor Luigi Di Bella (1912 – 2003), a retired physiologist who lived in 
Modena. It is based on a combination of somatostatin, vitamins, retinoids, melatonin and bromocriptine. ACTH (adreno-
corticotrophic hormone) and low doses of the oral chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide and hydroxyurea are 
sometimes also included. It was claimed that the treatment stimulated the body ’ s self - healing properties without damag-
ing healthy cells. No scientiﬁ c rationale or supportive experimental evidence was provided, and despite claims to have 
cured thousands of patients no clinical results were published in peer - reviewed scientiﬁ c journals. In December 1997 a 
judge in the southern Italian city of Maglie ruled that the health authority should fund this treatment for a patient and 
this pattern was followed elsewhere. Although the initial child died of cancer, unprecedented public interest in the 
unconventional therapy led to public demonstrations with the right - wing media in Italy championing the cause. The 
socialist Italian government under considerable pressure decided to carry out phase II open - label studies in several cancer 
centres. Scrutiny of Di Bella ’ s own clinical records of 3076 patients revealed that 50% lacked evidence that the patient 
had cancer and a further 30% had no follow - up data. Adequate data were available for just 248 patients of whom 244 
had in addition received conventional treatments for their tumours. These ﬁ ndings rattled Di Bella ’ s credibility and in 
October 1998 the ﬁ ndings of the ﬁ rst clinical trial were published in the  British Medical Journal . Of 386 patients, just 
three had shown a partial response. The ﬁ ndings, however, failed to shake Di Bella ’ s conﬁ dence. He accused drug com-
panies of conspiring against him, and suggested that the results were sabotaged by mainstream doctors. Even in 2003, 
some 3000 patients receive Di Bella - based cancer treatments paid for by three Italian regional health services.  
harmful. Pseudoscience uses the language and 
authority of science without recognizing its 
methods. It produces claims that cannot be proven 
or refuted and often poses as the victim ( ‘ scientists 
are suppressing the truth ’ ). A quack may reasona-
bly be deﬁ ned as a pseudoscientist who is selling 
something, and a charlatan as a cynical pseudosci-
entist who knows he or she is deceiving the public. 
It is a sorry monument to human greed and stupid-
ity that more money is spent on health frauds 
every year than on medical research. Quacks are 
convincing because they tell people what they 
want to hear. Moreover it is almost impossible for 
the cancer quack to fail. When a patient deterio-
rates, the cancer quack resorts to lines such as  ‘ if 
only you had come to me sooner ’ . However, we 
should appreciate that quacks can teach us a great 
deal whilst we retain an honest and informed prac-
tice of medicine. Their popularity is attributed to 
their patience and ability to listen carefully and 
show both interest and affection. As well as this, 
quacks encourage patients to take an active role in 
their health care thus empowering them. The 
internet appears to have made cancer quackery 
even easier. Whilst much health information on 
the web is evidence based and of high quality, the 
open access has also been abused. Entrepreneurs 
have recognized the value of the web as a free - for -
 all market and have used it to promote fraudulent 
cancer treatments ranging from  £ 100 a pound 
shark cartilage powder (Box  4.5 ) to  ‘ The Zapper ’ , a 
9 volt electrical device for zapping away cancers.  
 Euthanasia 
 Euthanasia is the intentional killing by act or omis-
sion of a dependent human being for his or her 
alleged beneﬁ t. The term assisted suicide is used 
when someone provides an individual with the 
information, guidance and means to take his or her 
own life with the intention that they will be used 
for this purpose. Although active euthanasia 
remains illegal in the UK it was legalized in Aus-
tralia ’ s Northern Territory in 1995, but this bill was 
overturned by the Australian parliament in 1997. 
In 1998 Oregan state, USA, legalized assisted 
suicide following a ballot of the population. There 
were 129 deaths under Oregon ’ s Physician Assisted 
Suicide Act between 1998 and 2002. Euthanasia 
was legalized in 2000 in Holland and in 2002 in 
Belgium. A survey published in 1994 showed that 
half of a mixture of hospital consultants and 
general practitioners in England had been asked 
by a patient to take active steps to hasten death, 
and that a third of those asked had complied with 
the patient ’ s request. The reason people choose

 Box 4.5:   Shark cartilage 
 In 1993, William Lane a marine biologist and entrepreneur published a book entitled  Sharks Don ’ t Get Cancer  following 
the discovery that some species of sharks have lower than predicted rates of cancer. This was followed by a prime - time 
television documentary focusing on a Cuban study of 29 cancer patients who received shark cartilage preparations. This 
resulted in patients clambering for sharks ’ cartilage and a consequent devastation of North American shark populations. 
According to the National Marine Fisheries Service  ‘ the Atlantic shark  … is severely over - capitalized ’ and it is estimated 
that over 200   000 sharks are killed in American waters just for their cartilage every month. The powdered cartilage has 
modest anti - angiogenic activity  in vitro , however oral administration results in the digestion of these proteins prior to 
absorption. An open - label phase II clinical trial, which was in part funded by shark cartilage manufacturers, found not a 
single responder amongst 58 patients although both nausea and vomiting were reported. Cartilage Technologies sub-
sequently announced that it would support no additional research on shark cartilage as a cancer remedy. It is, however, 
intriguing that squalamine, an aminosterol antibiotic isolated from shark livers, inhibits angiogenesis and suppresses the 
growth of tumour xenografts in animal models. Squalamine is easily synthesized without the need to ﬁ sh for sharks and 
is under clinical trial investigation in age - related macular degeneration as well as solid tumours.  
euthanasia is mostly out of fear of losing auton-
omy and/or bowel/bladder control, and an increas-
ing proportion of the British public wishes to allow 
euthanasia for patients in certain incurable disease 
scenarios. 
 Ethics 
 Four principles underpin medical ethics: respect 
for autonomy, non - maleﬁ cence, beneﬁ cence and 
justice. In health care decisions, respect for auton-
omy means that the patient is allowed to act 
intentionally, with understanding and without 
controlling inﬂ uences. This is the basis of informed 
consent. The principle of non - maleﬁ cence requires 
that we do not intentionally cause harm or injury 
to a patient, either through acts of commission or 
omission. In common language this is avoiding 
negligence and is based on Hippocrates ’ (460 – 377 
BC) original decree  ‘ primum non nocere ’ . The 
principle of beneﬁ cence is the duty of health care 
professionals to provide beneﬁ t to patients and 
prevent harm befalling them. These duties apply 
not only to the individual patient but to society as 
a whole, and therein frequently lies the problem. 
In practice, double effect reasoning, ﬁ rst attributed 
to Thomas Aquinas (1224 – 1274), may apply when 
an action has two outcomes  – one good and one 
bad  – and allows a lesser harm for a greater good. 
 Justice in health care terms is deﬁ ned as fairness 
in distribution of care particularly when allocating 
scarce resources. A number of political doctrines 
interpret this differently. Karl Marx (1818 – 1883), 
of course, believed in egalitarianism  ‘ from each 
according to his abilities, to each according to his 
needs ’ . Modern health care is rarely provided on 
this basis but rather on a system that distributes 
care according to a number of factors including 
need, effort, contribution, merit and free - market 
exchanges. Utilitarian philosophers, on the other 
hand, advocate a system that balances beneﬁ t 
between the collective public and the individual. 
 Perhaps the most interesting example of the 
rationing of health care is the Oregon health plan. 
The Oregon health plan was set up in 1987 with 
the aim of serving more low - income people using 
federal funds through a system that prioritizes 
heath care. An extensive list of more than 700 
physical health, dental, drug dependency and 
mental health services was drawn up and their pri-
ority publicly debated in order to reﬂ ect a consen-
sus of social values of Oregonians. The list of 587 
approved procedures went into operation in 1994. 
The innovation that most sharply and controver-
sially characterizes this systematic approach is its 
commitment to providing a standard health 
beneﬁ t based on ranking the effectiveness and 
value of all medical treatments. To determine 
which conditions are to be covered, Oregon ’ s 
Health Services Commission ranks diagnoses from 
the most important (treatment has the greatest 
impact on health status) to the least important. 
This prioritization introduces a transparent 
approach to health care rationing and was 

Cancer and people Chapter 4
85
originally designed to use the savings achieved to 
extend coverage to more people. Moreover it 
requires public involvement in health policies and 
incorporates public values into the rankings. The 
top ﬁ ve ranked items were the diagnosis and treat-
ment of head injury, insulin - dependent diabetes 
mellitus, peritonitis, acute glomerulonephritis 
(including dialysis) and pneumothorax. At the cut -
 off cusp, medical treatment of contact and atopic 
dermatitis and symptomatic urticaria are covered, 
as is repair of damaged knee ligaments, but the 
treatment of sexual dysfunction with psychother-
apy or medical and surgical approaches does not 
make the cut, nor does the medical treatment of 
chronic anal ﬁ ssure nor complex dental prosthe-
ses. The Oregon Health Services Commission also 
excluded treatment for hepatocellular cancer and 
widely disseminated cancer.  
 Sociology of  o ncology 
 Inequalities in health are not conﬁ ned to the 
marked differences between wealthy and poor 
nations but are recapitulated within countries, 
such as the UK. Eight tube stations on the Jubilee 
tube line separate Westminster from Canning 
Town in Newham and the life expectancy of a child 
born in Westminster exceeds that of a child born in 
Newham by six years  – almost one year lost for each 
stop travelled. How much of this disparity is attrib-
utable to differences in health care is uncertain, 
even in a state health monopoly that is free at the 
point of delivery. Certainly, Marxist health ana-
lysts such as Howard Waitzkin propose that doc-
tor – patient encounters reproduce the dominant 
ideologies of wider society and that medicine is a 
tool for social control. Modern medicine stands 
accused of serving the interests of capital and of 
ensuring that people adhere to the norms of behav-
iour. Many oncological health inequalities are 
behavioural and medicine has branded these as 
self - inﬂ icted, for example tobacco use and diet. 
Similar arguments have accused medicine of 
gender discrimination. Women are greater users of 
health care because they live longer and because 
of the medicalization of reproductive health. It is 
also worth noting that the only national cancer 
screening programmes are for women (mammo-
gram and cervical smears). Medicine has a long 
history of reinforcing a subordinate role for women 
in society leading to both radical and reformist 
responses from the feminist movement. Equiva-
lent oncological responses would be the alternative 
medicine movement, which wishes to overthrow 
the current practice of oncology, and complemen-
tary medicine, which wishes to change cancer 
medicine from within, encouraging the adoption 
of a wider vision and a more holistic approach. 
 The use of metaphors in cancer medicine has 
been attacked by both Susan Sontag and John 
Diamond, who use their personal experiences of 
cancer to describe the negative implications of 
these metaphors. Many of these metaphors are bel-
licose,  ‘ the ﬁ ght against cancer ’ belittles the patient 
as  ‘ a victim ’ . The use of these ﬁ gures of speech may 
render cancer socially as well as physically devas-
tating and  ‘ losing the battle against cancer ’ deni-
grates a patient ’ s role in society.

Breast  c ancer 
 Diseases of the breast, including tumours, have 
been attracting medical interest for more than 
5000 years. The earliest written records of breast 
cancer are in the Edwin Smith papyrus, from 
ancient Egyptian civilizations of 3000 to 2500 BC. 
Hard and cold lumps were recognized as tumours, 
whilst abscesses were hot. The next major advances 
in the management of breast cancer occurred 
during the golden age of surgery at the end of the 
19th century, following advances in antisepsis and 
anaesthesia. 
William 
Halsted 
in 
Baltimore 
described radical mastectomy in 1894. Moreover, 
in an early example of surgical audit, he reported a 
local recurrence rate in 50 women of only 6%. The 
next major advance in the management of breast 
cancer occurred in 1896 with the development of 
surgical oophrectomy as a treatment strategy for 
advanced breast cancer, which was pioneered by 
George Beatson in Glasgow (the Beatson Institute 
for Cancer Research in that city is named after 
him). Geoffrey Keynes, the brother of Maynard, 
and an expert in the watercolours of William Blake, 
developed lumpectomy and radiotherapy as a 
breast conservation measure in the 1930s whilst 
appointed as surgeon at St Bartholomew ’ s Hospital 
in London. In the 1960s and 1970s the radical 
women ’ s movements in Europe and America took 
breast cancer as a campaigning point, and their 
campaigns led to increased focus on breast cancer 
treatment and research. Copying the AIDS aware-
ness red ribbons, breast cancer activists adopted 
pink ribbons and now there are a rainbow of differ-
ent cancer ribbons. These campaigns directly led 
on to improvements in screening strategies, and 
screening programmes were introduced without a 
signiﬁ cant evidence base for efﬁ cacy and against 
the views of the medical establishment. As a conse-
quence of increased screening, the survival rates of 
breast cancer have risen steadily over the last 30 
years. A list of ﬁ ve - year survival of breast cancer 
patients by stage of disease can be found in Table 
 5.1 . Breast cancer patients were largely viewed as 
the property of the surgeons. In the United 
Kingdom in the last few years central governmen-
tal directives have led to multidisciplinary working. 
This has directly led to a decrease in the use of 
mutilating surgery, and an increase in the use of 
adjuvant treatments.  
 Epidemiology 
 Breast cancer is a common disease. According to 
the most recent ﬁ gures, 45  500 women are affected 
annually and 11   750 die in England and Wales as a 
result of this condition. The likelihood of the 
development of breast cancer is affected by a posi-
tive family history of breast cancer, increasing age, 
diet, social class and nulliparity. Breast cancer risk 
increases with age, plateauing during the meno-
pausal years of 45 – 55. Women are at increased risk

mosome 17q21 and is a tumour suppressor gene, 
the product of which is involved in cell cycle regu-
lation. The BRCA product binds with Rad51, a 
major protein of 3418 amino acids, which is 
involved in sensing and directing the molecular 
response to double stranded DNA damage. 
 The detected incidence of breast cancer is 
increasing in England and Wales, almost certainly 
as a result of the introduction of the screening pro-
gramme. Death rates have fallen by nearly 30% 
over the last 15 years and survival chance has 
increased from 65% to almost 80%. Survival rates 
have increased to those seen in the United States. 
They are almost certainly due to the successes of 
the screening programme, which has led to the 
earlier detection of tumours at an earlier stage, 
with the resultant better prognosis. There are also 
contributions to this fall in mortality rate from 
an increased use of adjuvant chemotherapy and 
hormonal therapy. This contribution to a fall in 
mortality rates is likely to be in the range 4 – 7%. 
 Presentation 
 Women with breast cancer generally present to 
their clinicians with a lump in their breast. On 
average, there is a delay of approximately three 
months between the woman ﬁ rst noting the mass 
in her breast and her seeing a hospital clinician. 
Alternative sources of referral are from breast 
screening programmes, where mammographic 
detection leads to diagnosis of a previously 
unnoted breast lump. As a result of governmental 
concerns over the care of patients with breast 
cancer, the investigation and treatment of this 
disease has been prioritized. Patients in whom this 
condition is suspected ought to be seen in  ‘ outpa-
tients ’ within two weeks of receipt of the referral 
letter. 
 Outpatient  d iagnosis 
 The current standard is for women to be seen in a 
multidisciplinary setting that offers a  ‘ one - stop 
shop ’ for diagnosis. Surgeons, with a special inter-
est in breast cancer are located in a clinic with 
oncologists, with access to same - day cytology and 
from breast cancer from non - vegetarian diets; it is 
not clear what the reason for this should be. 
Women who are more than two standard devia-
tions above average height and weight are at a 
greater risk from breast cancer, as are women of 
social classes I and II. There is a protective effect of 
a full - term pregnancy, provided the pregnancy is 
achieved prior to the woman ’ s 30th birthday. 
There is a minor protective effect of having more 
than ﬁ ve pregnancies, but probably no protective 
effect from breast feeding. A late menopause cor-
relates with an increased risk of breast cancer, but 
there is little evidence that an early menarche 
predicates for increased risk. Oestrogen - only 
hormone replacement therapy (HRT), as well as 
combined 
oestrogen 
and 
progestogen 
HRT, 
increase the risk of breast cancer in proportion to 
the duration of HRT administration. Both the oral 
contraceptive pill and alcohol and coffee con-
sumption have been linked to breast cancer, but 
the associations are controversial. 
 A family history of breast cancer is a very impor-
tant risk factor for breast cancer. If more than two 
ﬁ rst - degree relatives are affected, the risk to other 
female family members increases by a factor of 
two. There are clear links between breast cancer 
and other cancers, with associations between 
ovarian and endometrial cancer, and colonic 
tumours. There are four relatively common genes 
that lead to an increased risk of breast cancer and 
these are: BRCA1 and 2, CHEK2 and FGFR2. Preva-
lence and penetrance of mutions in these genes are 
variables reported and lead to a lifetime risk of 
breast cancer of greater than 80% and up to 60% of 
ovarian cancer. BRCA1 has been located to chro-

imaging services. A careful history should be 
obtained from the patient prior to examination 
when seen in outpatients. The mass may be 
thought to be benign or malignant. Benign lumps 
are more likely in younger women and tend to be 
painful, enlarging before menstruation. Malignant 
lumps tend to be more common in older women 
and are generally painless: only 30% of malignant 
breast lumps are painful, and just 10% of lumps 
seen in new patients are malignant. 
 Diagnosis is by clinical, mammographic (Figure 
 5.1 ), ultrasonographic, cytological and histological 
means. After clinical examination, mammogra-
phy, that is, a soft tissue X - ray of the breast, aspira-
tion cytology, which is removal of cells by means 
of a needle and syringe, and core biopsy should be 
performed to further assess the signiﬁ cance of the 
breast lump. In a younger woman, ultrasonogra-
phy rather than mammography is the radiological 
investigation of choice. If there is conﬁ rmed malig-
nancy, all women should then proceed to surgery 
within two weeks of diagnosis, as recommended by 
government guidelines (Figure  5.2 and see Plate 
 5.1 ). 
 Staging and  g rading 
 There are two main pathological variants of breast 
cancer, ductal and lobular, and these are both 
graded as given in Table  5.2 . This grading was ﬁ rst 
described by Bloom and Richardson, and bears 
their eponyms. This grading scheme depends upon 
the degree of tumour tubule formation, the mitotic 
activity and the nuclear pleomorphism of the 
tumour. As one might expect, poorly differentiated 
tumours have a worse prognosis than moderately 
differentiated ones, which in turn have a worse 
prognosis than well differentiated breast cancer. 
There may be pre - invasive changes, and these are

according to their microscopic features (see Plates 
 1.1  and  1.2 ). 
 Stage is deﬁ ned according to the classiﬁ cation of 
the Union Internationale Contre Le Cancer 
(UICC), which is updated every 10 years or so 
(Table  5.3 ). The subscript  ‘ P ’ denotes a pathological 
staging following surgery. There are many other 
staging systems.  
 Treatment 
 Surgery 
 Surgery for breast cancer depends upon the clinical 
stage of the disease. If the mass is less than 5   cm in 
size and not ﬁ xed, the preferred treatment is 
removal of the lump, which is termed  ‘ lumpec-
tomy ’ . Axillary lymph node dissection was con-
ventionally performed, but now this has largely 
been replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy 
which, if positive, may then be followed by an axil-
lary clearance. The reason for this is that if the 
nodes are affected by a cancer, there is an advan-
tage in this group of women to adjuvant chemo-
therapy. In the  ‘ node - negative ’  woman there is a 
very much smaller advantage to adjuvant chemo-
therapy. In an older woman there may be an argu-
ment against routine axillary dissection. The 
reason for this is that adjuvant treatment with 
chemotherapy within this group of women is not 
dictated by lymph node status, because the advan-
tage is much smaller than in younger women and 
the toxicity of the treatment outweighs these 
modest gains. It is clear, however, that knowledge 
of the axillary nodal status does provide some 
prognostic information. 
 For a woman whose tumour measures 5 – 10   cm 
in size, the preferred surgical option is mastec-
tomy, that is removal of the breast with axillary 
dissection. For more advanced breast cancer, the 
value of surgical treatment is much more conten-
tious, and elderly women may be treated with hor-
monal therapy alone if the breast cancer expresses 
oestrogen receptors and/or progesterone receptors. 
In a younger woman, neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
may be given in the ﬁ rst instance, to reduce the size 
of the tumour, and this may be then followed by 
surgery and radiotherapy. There is a major role for 
reconstructive surgery and this may be carried out 
at the time of primary surgery or at a later date 
upon completion of adjuvant radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy. The psychological gain is tremen-
dous and needs to be considered in older as well as 
younger women, for breasts are considered valued 
personal property in older just as much as in 
younger women.  
 Adjuvant  r adiotherapy 
 After lumpectomy, radiotherapy is given to the 
breast. This is done in order to reduce the risk of 
local recurrence of the tumour. Without radiation 
this risk is between 40% and 60%; whereas with 
radiation, the risk is reduced to approximately 
4 – 6%, which is the same as that for more radical 
surgical procedures. Radiotherapy is generally 
given over a six - week period and requires daily 
attendance at hospital. The side effects of radiation

otherapy using the CMF (cyclophosphamide, 
methotrexate, 5 - ﬂ uorouracil (5FU)) programme 
was the regimen ﬁ rst shown to be of beneﬁ t, and is 
widely used. A large international study showed 
that more intensive therapy using the FEC (5FU, 
epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) regimen is more 
effective than CMF. There has been recent interest 
in the use of taxane chemotherapy given in the 
adjuvant setting, with the possibility that survival 
may be further improved. Third generation adju-
vant chemotherapy combining alternating FEC 
and taxane based treatment are now considered to 
be the standard. There is no evidence whatsoever 
that intensifying adjuvant therapy any further 
using, for example, high - dose treatments with 
bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support, 
improves the disease - free interval or the overall 
survival. About a quarter of breast cancers express 
the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (EGFR2), 
also known as Her - 2/neu, and c - erbB - 2. This is the 
target for the monocloncal antibody trastuzumab 
(Herceptin). For patients with Her - 2 receptor - 
positive tumours, treatment with adjuvant trast-
uzumab 
may 
be 
considered. 
Treatment 
is 
conventionally given for periods of 12 – 18 months. 
The advantage to treatment with trastuzumab is 
small, but is recommended in the context of the 
60 – 70% ﬁ ve - year survival chance that patients 
include tiredness and burning of the skin, which 
is generally mild. More serious consequences of 
radiation are seen only rarely and include damage 
to the brachial nerve plexus and, with more old -
 fashioned treatment machines and plans, damage 
to the coronary blood vessels. Rarely, a second 
cancer, such as an angiosarcoma, may follow at the 
site of radiotherapy treatment.  
 Adjuvant  h ormonal  t herapy 
 Treatment with tamoxifen has been shown to have 
an advantage in terms of disease - free and overall 
survival in both pre - and postmenopausal women 
and is now given routinely to this group of patients. 
It is usually recommended that treatment should 
extend for ﬁ ve years. There is no advantage to adju-
vant tamoxifen in oestrogen receptor - negative 
tumours. There have been changes in our under-
standing of the oestrogen receptor. Two different 
classes of oestrogen receptor (ER), described as  α 
and  β , have been identiﬁ ed. Tamoxifen is a selec-
tive ER α - antagonist, which in turn has effects on 
the progesterone receptor. In postmenopausal 
women, recent studies suggest that a newer group 
of drugs, the aromatase inhibitors, may be even 
more effective than tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy. 
The current standard is to give sequential therapy 
with tamoxifen and then an aromatase inhibitor. 
Treatment is given for a total of ﬁ ve years. Approxi-
mately 10% of circulating oestrogens derive from 
adrenal precursors, such as androstenedione, 
through the action of aromatase enzymes. The aro-
matase inhibitors block this action, limiting the 
synthesis of oestrone and oestrone sulphate pro-
duced by a second series of enzymes; the sulphatase 
system (Figure  5.3 ). Use of aromatase inhibitors is 
associated with osteoporosis. There have been 
reports of cases of endometrial carcinoma associ-
ated with the use of tamoxifen. The estimated risk 
is one case per 20   000 women per year of use.

and 60% of patients respond to chemotherapy, 
and this response is for a median duration of one 
year. The median survival of women with meta-
static breast cancer ranges between 18 and 24 
months, with 5 – 10% alive after ﬁ ve years. It should 
be noted that there are patients with very pro-
longed survival, and these include those women 
who have, for example, single sites of metastatic 
disease. 
 High - d ose  c hemotherapy 
 Breast cancer responds to chemotherapy, but often 
after responding, patients relapse and die. There 
have been attempts to maximize response rates by 
intensifying chemotherapy. High - dose treatments 
were popular in the early 1980s. Response rates 
were found to be higher than for conventional 
treatment; toxicity, however, was signiﬁ cantly 
worse, and death rates reached 20% as a result of 
the side effects of treatment. Even more signiﬁ -
cantly, patients who responded and survived the 
toxicity, later relapsed, and the median duration of 
response was no better than that expected with 
conventional treatment. 
 In the 1990s, there was an increase in the 
numbers of patients receiving high - dose therapy 
for breast cancer. This was possible as a result of the 
improvement in supportive therapy, principally 
bone marrow rescue, either with stem cells or with 
marrow. Mortality has decreased and now is 5% in 
the best centres. Overall, there has been no signiﬁ -
cant improvement in the expectation for survival 
for patients with metastatic breast cancer, and only 
20% of patients are alive two years after the trans-
plantation. It has been recently argued that the 
relatively good results of intensive therapy reported 
in early studies are entirely the result of the selec-
tion of good - prognosis patients for treatment with 
high - dose therapy, and that the same effects could 
be achieved with less intensive, conventional 
therapy. It may be the case that early intensive 
therapy given as adjuvant treatment to patients 
with poor - risk tumours will lead to improved sur-
vival, but this has not been shown in any rand-
omized study.  
with Her - 2 strongly positive tumours have. The 
toxicity of treatment with trastuzumab is signiﬁ -
cant, and particularly of note are the direct cardiac 
effects that may manifest as heart failure.  
 Treatment of  m etastatic  b reast  c ancer 
 The treatment of metastatic breast cancer depends 
very much upon the age of the patient and the sites 
of metastasis. It is only rarely curable, and so life 
quality issues are immediately important. When 
we described this point to one patient, she replied: 
 ‘ my dear, it ’ s death quality issues that bother me ’ . 
In older women whose metastases are in the skin or 
bone, the preferred treatment option is hormonal 
therapy, provided that the tumour expresses oes-
trogen and/or progestogen receptor positivity. The 
agent of ﬁ rst choice is tamoxifen because of its 
lack of toxicity and efﬁ cacy. Approximately 70% 
of women aged 70 respond to this therapy. In a 
premenopausal woman, hormonal therapy is gen-
erally less effective, and at the age of 30, just 10% of 
patients overall will respond to treatment at all. But 
oophorectomy, (that is, removal of the ovaries by 
either radiotherapeutic, surgical or medical means), 
is generally the ﬁ rst therapeutic stratagem. Surgical 
oophorectomy is unnecessary, given that an equiv-
alence of effect is provided by the use of medical 
treatment with an LHRH (luteinizing hormone 
receptor hormone) agonist. How much easier is it 
to provide a simple three - monthly depot injection 
than to expose a woman to laparoscopy and surgi-
cal oophorectomy. Radiotherapy is not a particu-
larly successful way of causing gonadal failure. 
Ovaries are relatively radiotherapy resistant, and 
the conventional dosages of radiotherapy given to 
sterilize may not sterilize a younger woman, and 
certainly will not lead to an instant reduction in 
circulating ovarian steroid hormones. 
 In both pre - and postmenopausal women, radia-
tion treatment is very effective in controlling bone 
pain. The addition of regular bisphosphonate 
therapy both relieves bone pain and reduces skele-
tal events such as fractures and spinal cord com-
pression. If lungs or liver are affected, then 
chemotherapy is required. Overall, between 40%

tion. Inhibitors of this pathway, such as tem-
sirolimus, have been shown to have activity in 
breast cancer. 
 Triple negative breast cancer, which is breast 
cancers ER, PR and HER2 negative, constitutes 
about 15% of all breast cancers and has an aggres-
sive natural history. These triple negative tumours 
are highly sensitive to chemotherapy with DNA -
 damaging agents such as cisplatin, and the effects 
of these drugs can be potentiated by the use of 
PARP inhibitors which disable DNA base excision 
repair. In early clinical trials these agents have 
shown a highly signiﬁ cant improvement in 
response rates and overall survival. 
 Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, 
have also been shown to have an effect in breast 
cancer, but this is likely to be of minor signiﬁ cance. 
Targeted therapies, in which an antibody to HER2+ 
or EGFR+ is tagged to a cytotoxic agent, have pro-
vided a way of delivering targeted chemotherapy 
to breast cancer, and have led, in a small rand-
omized clinical trial, to have some efﬁ cacy, as have 
agents capable of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase 
linked to HER1 and  - 2 activation. 
 So, it is clear that there is hope that breast 
cancer will become a curable cancer within the 
next 10 years. There has been progress in the 
identiﬁ cation of susceptibility genes for breast 
cancer, and it is hoped that targeted therapy will 
lead to progress.  
 
 
 
 Carcinoma  in  s itu 
 Carcinoma  in situ , diagnosed by excision biopsy 
will progress to invasive cancer in 40% of patients 
over ﬁ ve years. Treatment with adjuvant radiother-
apy will limit this progression rate to 1 – 4% per 
annum. An alternative to radiation therapy is mas-
tectomy. Both radiotherapy and mastectomy are 
equally effective in local disease control. Lobular 
carcinoma  in situ  is associated with bilaterality, 
and mirror biopsy is recommended of the contral-
ateral breast.  
 Paget ’ s  d isease of the  n ipple 
 This is an eczematous condition of the nipple,

 New  t reatment 
 Further hormonal therapies are also likely to 
become available with interest in the development 
of sulphatase inhibitors (Figure  5.3 ). Poor - progno-
sis breast cancer highly expresses EGFR. Therapy 
with geﬁ tinib may be effective in these tumours.

Central  n ervous  s ystem  c ancers 
 The ﬁ rst recognized resection of a primary brain 
tumour was performed in 1884 by Rickman Godlee 
in collaboration with the Westminster Hospital 
neurologist Alexander Bennett. It should be 
remembered that the removal of the cerebral 
cortex tumour was performed before any diagnos-
tic imaging was available, but even then the 
surgeon knew to operate on the contralateral side 
to the clinical signs! There are about 4500 people 
diagnosed with a brain tumour each year in the 
UK. That is the equivalent to an incidence of about 
seven in every 100   000 people each year. Brain 
tumours are slightly more common in men than in 
women. A further 300 children are diagnosed with 
central nervous system tumours in the UK each 
year. 
 Scientists use animal models to study genetics, 
development and oncogenesis and the most 
common models are mice (see onco - mice in 
Chapter  1 ), fruit ﬂ ies ( Drosophila ) and nematode 
worms ( Caenorhabditis elegans ). However, ﬁ sh have 
also turned out to be useful subjects  – in particular 
zebraﬁ sh ( Danio rerio ), which are tropical freshwa-
ter minnows with ﬁ ve horizontal stripes running 
from their mouth to caudal ﬁ n. Zebraﬁ sh are the 
vertebrate model for studying the genetics of 
embryonic development because the embryos are 
transparent and the genome sequence is known 
and can readily be modiﬁ ed by knockouts. A less 
well known ﬁ sh model of cancer is the damselﬁ sh 
( Pomacentrus partitus ) that lives on coral reefs and 
has several vertical stripes. Deb and Flo in  Finding 
Nemo  are damselﬁ sh, so that is an excuse to watch 
it again. Damselﬁ sh neuroﬁ bromatosis is a natu-
rally occurring, neoplastic disease of these ﬁ sh 
that consists of multiple neuroﬁ bromata and 
neuroﬁ brosarcomas. . It has been proposed as an 
animal model for neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 in 
humans. However, whilst von Recklinghausen ’ s 
neuroﬁ bromatosis type 1 is vertically transmitted 
as an autosomal dominant trait, damselﬁ sh neu-
roﬁ bromatosis is transmitted horizontally between 
ﬁ sh and is thought to be due to an oncogenic retro-
virus named damselﬁ sh neuroﬁ bromatosis virus 
(DNFV). 
 Epidemiology 
 Metastases to the brain are about ten times more 
common than primary brain tumours. The most 
common primary tumour sites amongst patients 
with brain metastases are lung, breast, melanoma 
and kidney. In addition, nasopharyngeal cancers 
may directly extend through the skull foramina. 
Meningeal metastases occur with leukaemia and 
lymphoma, breast and small cell lung cancers, and 
from medulloblastoma and ependymal glioma as a 
route of spread. Primary tumours of the central 
nervous system (CNS) account for 2 – 5% of all

includes Facebook, deodorant, hair dye, talcum 
powder, mouthwash, tooth whitener, oral sex, 
chips and chocolate.  
 Pathology 
 Primary nervous system tumours may be glial 
tumours, non - glial tumours or primary cerebral 
non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma. As you will recall from 
embryology, the early embryo has three distinct 
germ layers of cells; the innermost endoderm that 
gives rise to the digestive organs, lungs and bladder, 
the middle layer or mesoderm that gives rise to the 
muscles, skeleton and blood system, and the outer 
layer or ectoderm that gives rise to the skin and 
nervous system. Neuroectodermal tumours are 
classiﬁ ed on the basis of the predominant cell type 
and include all neoplasms with either central or 
peripheral nervous system - derived cell origins. 
After embryonic development ceases, neurons do 
not divide, but glial cells retain the ability to prolif-
erate throughout life and thus most adult neuro-
logical tumours are derived from glial cells and are 
named gliomas. Seventy percent of primary brain 
tumours in adults are supratentorial, situated 
above the tentorium cerebelli, the tent of dura 
mater that lies between the cerebellum and the 
inferior portion of the occipital lobes. In contrast 
primary brain tumours in children are usually 
located below the tentorium (Table  6.2 ). 
 Gliomas account for 50% of brain tumours and 
are divided into grade I (non - inﬁ ltrating pilocytic 
astrocytoma), grade II (well to moderately differen-
tiated astrocytoma), grade III (anaplastic astrocy-
toma) and grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme). 
The prognosis deteriorates with rising tumour 
grade. Other glial tumours include ependymomas, 
that arise from ependymal cells, usually lining the 
fourth ventricle, and oligodendrogliomas that 
arise from oligodendroglia. In the peripheral 
nervous system, neuroﬁ bromata and schwan-
nomas are the most frequent glial tumours. 
Medulloblastoma is a glial tumour of childhood 
usually arising in the cerebellum, which may be 
related to primitive neuroectodermal tumours else-
where in the CNS. Non - glial brain tumours include 
pineal parenchymal tumours, extragonal germ cell 
cancers, and 2% of cancer deaths. Fewer than 20% 
of CNS cancers occur in the spinal cord. There 
appears to be a modest increase in the incidence of 
primary brain tumours over the last two decades, 
particularly amongst the elderly. A more dramatic 
rise in the incidence of primary CNS lymphomas is 
attributable to the AIDS epidemic.  
 Aetiology 
 Although the cause of most adult brain tumours is 
not established, a number of inherited phakoma-
toses are associated with brain tumours. Phakoma-
toses are a group of familial conditions with unique 
cutaneous and neurological manifestations and 
dysplasias of a number of organ systems. They 
include neuroﬁ bromatosis (von Recklinghausen ’ s 
disease), tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville ’ s disease), 
von Hippel – Lindau disease (cerebroretinal angi-
omatosis), Sturge – Weber syndrome (ezcephalot-
rigeminal 
angiomatosis), 
Osler – Rendu – Weber 
syndrome and Fabry ’ s disease (angiokeratoma cor-
poris diffusum). The ﬁ rst three of these are associ-
ated with brain tumours; von Reckinghausen ’ s 
neuroﬁ bromatosis with cranial and root schwan-
nomas, meningiomas, ependymomas and optic 
gliomas (see Plate  2.2 ); tuberous sclerosis with 
gliomas and ependymomas; and von Hippel –
 Lindau disease with cerebellar and retinal haema-
gioblastoma (Table  6.1 ). In addition, an increased 
incidence of brain tumours is a feature of Gorlin ’ s 
basal naevus syndrome (medulloblastoma), Turcot 
syndrome (gliomas) and Li – Fraumeni syndrome 
(glioma). High - dose ionizing radiation to the head 
region administered in the past for benign condi-
tions such as scalp tinea capitis fungal infection 
(ringworm) increases the risk of nerve sheath 
tumours, gliomas and meningiomas. There is 
much public concern that low - frequency non - ion-
izing electromagnetic ﬁ elds such as those emitted 
by 60   Hz power cables may increase the risk of 
brain tumours, but there is no consistent evidence 
to support this hypothesis. Similarly, despite 
scares, there is no evidence to support an associa-
tion with wireless radiofrequency devices such as 
mobile phones. This joins the long list of things 
that cause cancer according to the  Daily Mail . It

ing headaches, seizures, motor and sensory symp-

site (Table  6.4 and see Plate  6.1 ). Meningiomas are 
some of the few tumours that produce characteris-
tic changes on plain skull X - rays with bone erosion, 
calciﬁ cation and hyperostosis.  
 Spinal  a xis  t umours 
 For spinal axis tumours, the proportion of tumour 
sites is 50% thoracic, 30% lumbosacral and 20% 
cervical or foramen magnum. These tumours 
present with radicular symptoms due to nerve root 
inﬁ ltration, syringomyelic disturbance (dissoci-
ated sensory loss of pain and temperature sensa-
tion) due to central destruction by intramedullary 
tumours, or sensorimotor dysfunction (limb weak-
ness and a sensory level) due to cord compression.  
 Investigation and  s taging 
 Neuroradiology has developed into the most 
important investigation in patients with suspected 
brain tumours, following the introduction of 
computed tomography (CT) in the mid - 1970s by 
Geoffrey Hounsﬁ eld and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. Newer techniques, 
such as positron emission tomography (PET), 
single photon emission computerized tomography 
(SPECT) and functional MRI have also found roles 
in the diagnosis and management of patients with 
brain tumours. MRI with gadolinium enhancement

brain tumours. The majority of spinal axis tumours 
in adults are extradural, metastatic carcinoma, 
lymphoma or sarcoma. Primary spinal cord 
tumours include extradural meningiomas (26%), 
schwannomas (29%), intramedullary ependymo-
mas (13%) and astrocytomas (13%).  
 Presentation 
 Glial  t umours 
 Glial tumours may produce both generalized and 
focal effects, and these will reﬂ ect the site of the 
tumour and the speed of its growth. General symp-
toms from the mass effect, increased intracranial 
pressure, oedema, midline shift and herniation 
syndromes are all seen, including progressive 
altered mental state and personality, headaches, 
seizures and papilloedema. Focal symptoms 
depend upon the location of the tumour (Table 
 6.3 ). Although seizures are a feature of up to half of 
all glial tumours, fewer than 10% of ﬁ rst ﬁ ts are due 
to tumours and only 20% of supratentorial 
tumours present with ﬁ ts.

shunt (a closed cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) shunt joining the 
lateral ventricle with a reservoir below the scalp) in place 
that is leaking, resulting in air seen in the right anterior brain 
and ﬂ uid accumulating around the shunt site. Omaya 
shunts may be placed to relieve non - communicating hydro-
cephalus caused by obstruction to CSF ﬂ ow within the ven-
tricular system, or to administer intrathecal chemotherapy.  
is the imaging technique of choice with advantages 
over CT particularly for posterior fossa tumours 
and non - enhancing low - grade gliomas (see ﬁ gures 
in Chapter  1 ). PET with ﬂ uorodeoxyglucose - 18, 
which accumulates in metabolically active tissues, 
may help to differentiate tumour recurrence from 
radiation necrosis (see Plate  6.1 ). Stereotactic 
biopsy is required to conﬁ rm the diagnosis, 
although occasionally tumours are diagnosed on 
clinical evidence, because biopsy might be hazard-
ous, as in brain stem gliomas, for example.  
 Treatment 
 Some gliomas are curable by surgery alone and 
some by surgery and radiotherapy; the remainder 
require surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 
and these tumours are rarely curable. Surgical 
removal should be as complete as possible within 
the constraints of preserving neurological func-
tion. Radiation can increase the cure rate or 
prolong disease - free survival in high - grade gliomas 
and may also be useful symptomatic therapy in 
patients with low - grade glioma, who relapse after 
initial therapy with surgery alone (Figure  6.1 ). 
Chemotherapy with nitrosurea or temozolomide 
may prolong disease - free survival in patients with 
oligodendrogliomas 
and 
high - grade 
gliomas, 
although its high toxicity may not always merit 
this approach.  
 Therapy of meningiomas is surgical resection, 
which may be repeated at relapse. Radiotherapy 
reduces relapse rates and should be considered for 
high - grade meningiomas or incompletely resected 
tumours. Relapse rates are 7% at ﬁ ve years if 
completely resected and 35 – 60% if incompletely 
resected. 
 Unlike with other brain tumours, surgical resec-
tion does not have a useful role in primary cerebral 
lymphomas. In immunocompetent patients, the 
combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
produces median survivals of 40 months. In con-
trast, in the immunocompromised patients, espe-
cially those with HIV infection, the prognosis is far 
worse, with a median survival of under three 
months. Palliative radiotherapy or best supportive 
care are the appropriate treatment options here. 
 Complications of  t reatment 
 Early complications of cranial radiotherapy which 
occur in the ﬁ rst three to four months are due 
to reversible damage to myelin - producing oli-
godendrocytes. This recovers spontaneously after 
three to six months. It causes somnolence or exac-
erbation of existing symptoms in the brain and 
Lhermitte ’ s sign (shooting numbness or paraesthe-
sia precipitated by neck ﬂ exion) in the cord. Late 
complications include radiation necrosis, causing 
irreversible deﬁ cits due to vessel damage. This may 
mimic disease recurrence, is radiation dose related 
and occurs in up to 15% of patients, with the

radiotherapy for high - grade glioma will dramati-
cally improve survival chances. Many high - grade 
gliomas express receptors for cErbB2/neu. Targeted 
antibody therapy delivered intravascularly may 
lead to further improvements in survival. Another 
recent advance is the use of biodegradable wafers 
implanted with chemotherapy that may be 
inserted at the time of surgery. 
 Newer radiotherapy delivery techniques that 
have been pioneered in the treatment of brain 
tumours include both gammaknife and cyberknife 
treatments, which have caught the attention and 
interest of the gently dozing neurosurgeon in the 
multidisciplinary team. Gammaknife radiotherapy 
is delivered by 201 cobalt - 60 sources arranged in a 
ring in a helmet that is bolted to the patient ’ s skull. 
Cyberknife radiotherapy uses a linear accelerator to 
deliver radiotherapy via a robotic arm that is linked 
to an image guidance system. Cyberknife radio-
therapy does not need a skull frame because the 
real - time image linking means that if the patient 
moves, the robotic arm also moves so that the 
radiotherapy dose is delivered to the correct site. 
 Gene therapy has been adopted for trials in 
gliomas with viral vectors being administered 
either into the blood or directly into the tumour by 
surgeons. The genetically modiﬁ ed viral vectors 
may be non - replicating viruses that deliver a trans-
gene that causes an anticancer effect, or replicating 
oncolytic viruses that directly lyse cancer cells by 
replicating. Gliomas are a good model to try these 
methods because they are pretty much the only 
cells dividing in the brain (apart from microglia 
and endothelial cells).  
 
 
 
highest frequency in children also receiving 
chemotherapy. SPECT and PET scanning may dif-
ferentiate radionecrosis and relapse.  
 Prognosis 
 The prognosis of glial tumours depends upon the 
histology, the grade and size of the tumour, on the 
age and performance status of the patient and on 
the duration of the symptoms. The median sur-
vival for anaplastic astrocytoma is 18 months, and 
for glioblastoma multiforme is 10 – 12 months. 
Meningiomas, if completely resected, are usually 
cured, and the median survival is over 10 years.  
 New  t reatment 
 The treatment of brain tumours may well improve 
in the next 5 – 10 years. The most important recent 
advance has been with the use of adjuvant chemo-
therapy. It is hoped that the application of temo-
zolamide, which crosses the blood – brain barrier, to

Gastrointestinal cancers  
 Gastrointestinal malignancies have been attrib-
uted an important role in the history of Europe. 
Ferrante I of Arragon, the then King of Naples, was 
mummiﬁ ed and embalmed, following his death in 
1494 and placed in a wooden sarcophagus at the 
Abbey of San Domenico Maggiore, Naples. In 
1996, an autopsy was performed which revealed a 
large pelvic mass, and polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) identiﬁ ed a mutation of the RAS oncogene, 
suggesting a colonic primary cancer. In 1821, 
Napoleon Bonaparte, the former Emperor of 
France, died in exile at Longwood House, St Helena. 
His health had been declining over a number of 
months with abdominal pain, weakness and vom-
iting, which he attributed to mistreatment by his 
English captors. An autopsy performed following 
his death concluded that the cause of death was 
stomach cancer; and indeed, there was a strong 
history of stomach cancer in his family, although 
longstanding  Helicobacter pylori  infection may 
have contributed. Nineteen years later, Napoleon ’ s 
grave was opened, and his body was returned to 
Paris to be ﬁ nally interred in the magniﬁ cent tomb 
at the church of the Invalides, where it rests today. 
A popular alternative hypothesis proposed that his 
death was a consequence of chronic arsenic poi-
soning by his captors. 
 The gastrointestinal tract is one of the most fre-
quent sites of cancer, and Table  7.1 shows the reg-
istration data for the most common tumours of the 
digestive system for southeast England in 2001 and 
the ﬁ ve - year survivals.  
 Gastrointestinal cancers include oesophageal 
cancer, gastric cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, pan-
creatic cancer and colorectal cancer, and these will 
be dealt with in more detail in the following ﬁ ve

Oesophageal  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Cancer of the oesophagus is a relatively uncom-
mon cancer in the UK, but the incidence is rising, 
at least in men (see Table  7.1 ). Worldwide, oesopha-
geal cancer is the sixth most common cause of 
death from cancer. One - third are adenocarcinoma 
of the distal oesophagus and two - thirds are squa-
mous cell cancers, with 15% in the upper, 45% in 
the mid and 40% in the lower portions of the 
oesophagus. Tobacco is a major risk factor for both 
histological types of oesophageal cancer, but the 
two types otherwise vary not only in their histol-
ogy and anatomical distribution but also in their 
risk factors. Chronic irritation appears to be a 
major precipitant of squamous cell cancer and may 
be caused by alcohol, caustic injury, radiotherapy 
or achalasia. The Plummer – Vinson syndrome (also 
known as Patterson – Kelly – Brown syndrome) of 
chronic iron deﬁ ciency anaemia, dysphagia and 
oesophageal web is associated with squamous cell 
cancer of the oesophagus, particularly in impover-
ished populations. Tylosis is an autosomal domi-
nant abnormality, characterized by hyperkeratosis 
(skin thickening) of the palms and soles. It carries a 
95% risk of squamous cell cancer of the oesopha-
gus by the age of 70. In contrast, the major precipi-
tant of oesophageal adenocarcinoma appears to be 
gastro - oesophageal reﬂ ux disease (GORD). Related 
markers of reﬂ ux, such as hiatus hernia, obesity, 
frequent antacid and histamine H2 blockers, are 
also associated with an increased risk. Barrett ’ s 
oesophagus (named after Norman Barrett, a tho-
racic surgeon at St Thomas ’ Hospital, London) 
develops in 5 – 8% of adults with reﬂ ux leading to 
metaplasia of the normal squamous epithelium of 
the lower oesophagus to columnar epithelium, 
which may become dysplastic. The annual rate of 
transformation to oesophageal adenocarcinoma is 
0.5%, which is a hundred times greater than the 
normal risk. Over the last three decades, there has 
been a radical shift in the histology of oesophageal 
cancer in the industrialized world, with a marked 
decline in squamous cell cancers and a rise in ade-
nocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are thought to 
take their origin from the stomach. Where they 
occur at the junction of the stomach and oesopha-
gus, they are classiﬁ ed as carcinomas of the gastro -
 oesophageal junction, as the intelligent reader of 
this book might have concluded independently of 
the authors of this book. This may reﬂ ect altera-
tions in the number of smokers and in the obesity 
and nutrition of patients.  
 Prevention 
 Half of all cases of oesophageal cancer could be pre-
vented by giving up smoking, drinking less alcohol

and improving diet, substituting fresh fruit and 
vegetables for poorly preserved, high salt foods 
contaminated with nitrosamine carcinogens or 
microbial toxins. Endoscopic surveillance is rec-
ommended every two to ﬁ ve years for patients with 
Barrett ’ s oesophagus but the evidence that screen-
ing is effective is absent. Low - grade dysplasia 
requires aggressive antireﬂ ux management, whilst 
multifocal or high - grade dysplasia should be 
treated by surgical resection.  
 Presentation 
 Patients present with dysphagia or odynophagia, 
weight loss and, less frequently, with haemateme-
sis. At the time of diagnosis, more than half of the 
patients will have locally advanced, unresectable 
disease or metastases present. Left supraclavicular 
lymphadenopathy (Virchow ’ s node), hepatomeg-
aly and pleural effusion are common features of 
metastatic dissemination. The diagnosis is usually 
conﬁ rmed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 
and barium studies (Figure  8.1 ). 
 Staging and  g rading 
 Although CT staging is most helpful in deﬁ ning 
operability, additional information can be obtained 
from using endoscopic ultrasound. This allows the 
surgeon to have a better view as to the extent of the 
resection that is required.  
 Treatment 
 Only 40% of patients will have localized disease at 
presentation and are candidates for oesophagec-
tomy with or without postoperative adjuvant 
chemoradiation. Surgery has a 5 – 20% mortality 
rate and may be complicated early by anastomotic

leaks, and later by strictures, reﬂ ux and motility 
disorders. At diagnosis, 25% of patients will have 
local extension and are treated with palliative radi-
otherapy, which may cause oesophageal perfora-
tion 
and 
haemorrhage, 
pneumonitis 
and 
pulmonary ﬁ brosis, as well as transverse myelitis. 
The remaining 35% of patients will have metas-
tases at presentation and are usually treated symp-
tomatically. Although cancer of the oesophagus is 
sensitive to chemotherapy, the duration of 
response is typically short and may be measured in 
weeks. Cisplatin - based combination regimens 
have higher response rates, but this may be offset 
by their greater toxicity. Adjuvant chemoradio-
therapy, either prior to surgery (neoadjuvant), or 
following resection, has yet to be proven as being 
beneﬁ cial. Over the last 30 years, there have been a 
large number of trials that investigated the beneﬁ t 
of chemotherapy given in the adjuvant setting for 
carcinoma that had arisen at the junction of the 
oesophagus and stomach. Until a short time ago, 
no beneﬁ t had been shown, but recent trials have 
led to the consensus that chemotherapy is proba-
bly of beneﬁ t in the adjuvant setting, though this 
beneﬁ t is small.  
 Prognosis 
 The ﬁ ve - year survival of patients with oesophageal 
cancer according to stage at presentation is detailed 
in Table  8.1 . 
 New  t reatment 
 As we write, sadly, there are no new therapies that 
these authors know of for oesophageal cancer.

Gastric cancer 
 Epidemiology and pathogenesis 
 Gastric cancer is the sixth most common malig-
nancy in the UK and constitutes approximately 5% 
of all cancers. The male to female ratio is 1.5 to 1. 
In 2005 nearly 8000 people were diagnosed with 
stomach cancer in the UK and 5200 died of 
stomach cancer. The average age at presentation is 
65 years. The survival for gastric cancer has tripled 
over the last 25 years but currently only 13% of 
patients are alive ﬁ ve years after diagnosis. Surpris-
ingly, gastric cancer is the second most common 
cause of cancer deaths worldwide with 900   000 
new diagnoses in 2002. There are extreme geo-
graphical variations, with the incidence being ﬁ ve 
times higher in Japan than in the US. 
 The incidence of gastric cancer has fallen in the 
industrialized world over the last few decades. This 
is particularly the case for distal tumours of the 
stomach. It had been thought that one of the 
reasons for the decrease in the West is better food 
preservation. The reducing agents used to preserve 
food are thought to reduce the availability of free 
radicals within the stomach, a major cause of car-
cinogenesis, but this has not been proven in pro-
spective studies. There is contradictory evidence 
for a protective beneﬁ t from fruit and vegetable 
intake, and also from the use of non - steroidal anti -
 inﬂ ammatory drugs. 
 In 1926 the Nobel Prize for medicine was 
awarded to a Dane, Dr Johannes Fibiger, who had 
described a nematode worm that he called  Spirop-
tera carcinoma , which caused stomach cancers in 
rats that he caught in an infested sugar reﬁ nery. It 
was subsequently shown that the cancers were in 
fact only metaplasia and that the cause was vitamin 
A deﬁ ciency. Although Fibiger has been branded a 
ﬁ bber, it turns out that chronic infection is the 
cause of most human gastric cancers. The single 
most common cause of gastric cancer is infection 
with  Helicobacter pylori : probably the most common 
chronic bacterial infection in man. This bacterium 
colonizes over half of the world ’ s population. 
Infection is usually acquired in childhood and in 
the absence of antibiotic therapy persists for the 
life of the host. How  H. pylori  causes gastric cancer 
remains unclear. Strains that have CagA genes are 
more oncogenic and the products of these genes 
regulate protein secretion by epithelial cells. In 
addition, chronic  H. pylori  infection leads to the 
local production of inﬂ ammatory cytokines that 
are also thought to be involved in oncogenesis. 
Infection by  H. pylori  explains the aetiology of 
cancers developing in patients with atrophic gas-
tritis.  Helicobacter infection is more common in 
patients with gastric cancer than in  ‘ controls ’ , in 
particularly in younger patients.

logical conﬁ rmation of the staging. Ninety - ﬁ ve 
percent of all gastric tumours are adenocarcino-
mas. The remainder are squamous cell cancers and 
lymphomas. Small cell cancers are reported only 
rarely. 
 Treatment 
 Surgery 
 The only signiﬁ cant chance for a cure rests with 
surgery. Laparoscopic staging is carried out prior 
to deﬁ nitive laparotomy. There is considerable 
debate concerning the operative procedures of 
ﬁ rst choice. Older retrospective data suggested 
that survival was improved with total gastrec-
tomy compared with subtotal gastrectomy. Ran-
domized trials, however, have since shown 
equivalent survival, with lesser complications for 
subtotal gastrectomy for carcinoma of the 
antrum, compared with total gastrectomy. One 
recent randomized study showed equal ﬁ ve - year 
survival of patients with either subtotal or total 
gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy. The opera-
tive mortality in the UK varies from 5% to 
14% and is related to the number of these 
operations performed by the surgeon. Surgical 
developments have been led by the Japanese, 
who have to deal with the highest incidence 
of carcinoma of the stomach in the world. 
The current recommendation by the Japanese 
Society for Research in Gastric Cancer is for 
extensive lymphadenectomy, which involves the 
removal of the lymphatic chains along the 
coeliac axis and hepatic and splenic arteries. 
This sort of dissection also has the advantage 
of allowing more accurate staging for gastric 
cancer and has been associated with improved 
survival. For early - stage disease, advances in 
endoscopic techniques have led to curative 
mucosal resection techniques equivalent to sub-
total gastrectomy, with clear evidence of reduced 
morbidity. Tumours of the gastro - oesophageal 
junction are increasing in the West and are 
treated surgically by subtotal resection of the 
oesophagus, along with the cardia and gastric 
fundus. 
 Presentation 
 Patients with gastric cancer generally present to 
their general practitioner with symptoms of 
abdominal pain. Classically, the pain is epigastric 
and worse with meals. The differential diagnosis 
includes benign peptic ulceration. The routine pre-
scription of protein pump inhibitors, without 
investigation by endoscopy, may lead to late diag-
nosis and the presence of advanced disease at diag-
nosis. Because the symptoms of gastric cancer are 
very similar to those of peptic ulceration, and 
because peptic ulceration is very common and not 
necessarily routinely investigated, early diagnosis 
of gastric cancer in the West presents a difﬁ cult 
problem. Fewer than 2% of patients with ﬁ rst time 
dyspepsia will have gastric cancer but the risk is 
greater in people over 55 years and those with 
dysphagia, vomiting, weight loss, anorexia or 
symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding. Walk - in 
endoscopy clinics, however, are becoming much 
more widely available in the UK, and it is hoped 
that they will impact upon survival ﬁ gures for 
gastric cancer.  
 Outpatient diagnosis 
 After initial assessment, which should include a 
full blood count, liver function tests and chest 
X - ray, more specialized investigations should be 
undertaken. These should include endoscopy with 
biopsy, ultrasonography and CT imaging of the 
abdomen and chest. There have been advances in 
endoscopic ultrasound that have allowed improve-
ments in local staging of gastric tumours. These 
improvements are such that mucosal invasion can 
be distinguished from submucosal invasion. 
Twenty years ago, the vast majority of patients 
with gastric cancer presented with inoperable 
disease. Currently, approximately 50% of tumours 
are operable at the time of presentation although 
only 20% are curative resections.  
 Staging and pathology 
 The TNM staging system is widely used for staging 
gastric cancer, with the  ‘ p ’ preﬁ x denoting patho-

Gastric cancer Chapter 9

there has been considerable support for combina-
tion chemotherapy using epirubicin and cisplatin 
with either continuous infusion 5FU (ECF) or its 
oral prodrug capecitabine (ECX). Initially, a 70% 
response rate was reported, and the median sur-
vival of patients responding was seven months. 
The programme is well tolerated and offers patients 
reasonable quality of life. 
 Survival 
 In the West, more than two - thirds of patients 
present with advanced tumours. The median sur-
vival of patients with advanced local disease or 
metastatic tumour is approximately six months. 
 Improving survival in gastric cancer 
 Patients with early gastric cancer have very good 
chances of survival, which can be in excess of 90%. 
For early - stage disease, surgery can be minimal, 
with advances in endoscopy, endoscopic ultra-
sonography and endoscopic surgery providing 
great improvements in limiting the morbidity of 
interventional therapies. Signiﬁ cant improve-
ments have been seen in Japan as a result of the 
widescale implementation of screening endos-
copy. In Japan, up to 40% of patients are found to 
have early - stage tumours, which contrasts with the 
situation in the West. One can only conclude that 
more widespread availability of endoscopic screen-
ing and earlier referral by GPs remains the only sig-
niﬁ cant chance for improved survival. The 
development of effective therapies based upon any 
understanding of the biological basis of this 
tumour group seems to be a distant possibility at 
this point.  
 Adjuvant treatment 
 In 30 years of adjuvant therapy investigation, no 
signiﬁ cant role for adjuvant radiation or chemo-
therapy had been found. Despite this, active trial 
work continued with the hope of improving prog-
nosis and recent trials have shown a beneﬁ t to 
adjuvant treatment. These beneﬁ ts continue to be 
debated. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
prior to surgery using ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin 
and infusional 5 - ﬂ uorouracil (5FU)) or ECX (epiru-
bicin, cisplatin, capecitabine) has been found to 
improve survival in patients with operable gastric 
cancer. 
 Treatment of metastatic or locally 
inoperable gastric cancer 
 Patients with inoperable local disease or metastases 
may be treated with chemotherapy. Over the years, 
many treatment programmes have been intro-
duced, and the majority have contained 5FU. 
There is uncertainty as to whether or not combina-
tion therapy offers beneﬁ t. The response rates are 
higher but overall survival is similar for combina-
tion chemotherapy compared with single - agent 
5FU treatment. In the 1970s, there was considera-
ble enthusiasm following the introduction of a 
combination therapy containing 5FU, adriamycin 
(doxorubicin) and mitomycin C. This treatment 
schedule, known as the  ‘ FAM regimen ’ , was ini-
tially reported as leading to responses in 40% of 
patients, with a median duration of response of 
approximately nine months. Randomized trials 
have since shown that the same order of response 
can be obtained with single - agent 5FU, with the 
same expectations of survival. In recent times,

Hepatobiliary  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Hepatobiliary cancer is the sixth most common 
malignant tumour in the world. The highest inci-
dences are seen in South East Asia. In the United 
Kingdom, hepatobiliary cancer is relatively uncom-
mon. There are approximately 3200 men and 
women registered with the condition each year, 
and sadly 3200 deaths. Generally, there are more 
women than men affected by these tumours. Liver 
cancer is divided into four main groups of tumour: 
hepatocellular cancer, which accounts for 75% of 
this group, and is more common in men than 
women; biliary tree cancers, also known as cholan-
giocarcinomas, which account for over 25%; and 
the rare hepatoblastomas and angiosarcomas 
which account for 1 – 2% of all liver cancers. 
 Hepatocellular cancer is associated with chronic 
infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. 
This is prevalent in up to 15% of males in certain 
populations. The lifetime risk of developing a 
tumour is 40% in this group of men. An epidemio-
logical study of 22   707 Taiwanese male govern-
ment employees followed over 10 years found that 
the relative risk of liver cancer was 98 for men with 
HBV. To put this risk into context, the relative risk 
for lung cancer amongst smokers is around 17. 
How HBV causes liver cancer is uncertain. The HBV 
genome does include a weak oncogene HBX. 
However, since the greatest risk is amongst those 
with chronic infection it is thought that the con-
stant proliferation of hepatocytes caused by the 
need to replace virus - damaged cells and the 
chronic inﬂ ammatory response in the liver are 
the main culprits. Support for this hypothesis 
also comes from hepatitis C virus (HCV) induced 
liver cancer. HBV and HCV are very different 
viruses genetically but both cause similar chronic 
infection and inﬂ ammation of the liver and both 
are associated with a high risk of liver cancer. In 
terms of the model for chemical carcinogenesis 
these viruses appear to act as tumour promoters 
rather than initiators. This is supported by syner-
gism in risk between chronic HBV infection and 
mutagens such as aﬂ atoxin B1. Aﬂ atoxin B1 is 
derived from  Aspergillus fumigatus  which com-
monly infects foods such as peanuts that are stored 
in damp conditions and which causes mutation of 
p53. In one study from China the relative risk of 
liver cancer in people with HBV was 7, in those 
exposed to aﬂ atoxin was 3, but in those exposed to 
both HBV and aﬂ atoxin was 60. Hepatocellular 
cancers are also associated with alcoholism and 
other hepatitides causing cirrhosis such as haemo-
chromatosis and acute and chronic hepatic por-
phyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria 
cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria and var-
iagate porphyria). 
 There is great interest in the role of the hepatitis -
 causing viruses in the aetiology of hepatocellular

cancer, and this is for three reasons. Firstly, a 
vaccine based on the surface antigen envelope 
protein of HBV (HBVsAg) protects against the 
acquisition of HBV. The widespread introduction f 
this vaccine in Taiwan has been shown to reduce 
the risk of hepatocellular cancer in children and a 
similar protection in adults is likely. Secondly, 
antiviral therapy against hepatitis B that is effec-
tive at lowering HBV titres may reduce the risk of 
liver cancer amongst people with chronic HBV. 
Similarly interferon - based therapy for chronic 
HCV may also reduce the risk of hepatocellular 
cancer in chronically infected individuals. Finally, 
screening people with chronic HCV and HBV may 
reduce the mortality of liver cancer by diagnosing 
patients earlier with surgically resectable disease. 
Liver ultrasound and serum  α - fetoprotein (AFP) 
screening should be performed every six months 
in patients with chronic HBV or HCV. There are 
signiﬁ cant concerns with regard to the increasing 
infection rates with hepatitis C in Europe. It is 
thought that the risk of developing hepatobiliary 
cancer in the presence of chronic hepatitis C infec-
tion is even greater than that associated with hepa-
titis B infection. 
 The aetiology of hepatoblastoma is not known. 
Hepatic angiosarcoma is associated with exposure 
to polyvinyl choride (PVC) monomer. The mecha-
nism for this is not clear, and the development of 
this tumour does not always occur in those men 
and women who have the heaviest exposure to 
PVC, as for example in those workers involved in 
autoclave cleaning in chemical works. When 
workers exposed to PVC are examined for their life-
time risk of developing angiosarcoma this is overall 
clearly four times higher than in the general popu-
lation. Where there is a coincident HBV infection, 
the risk increases 25 - fold compared with the 
general population. PVC exposure is also associ-
ated with the development of brain and lung 
tumours. 
 Tumours of the biliary tree are divided into intra-
hepatic bile duct cancers (which are treated in the 
same way as hepatocellular cancers), perihilar 
cholangiocarcinomas (also known as Klatskin 
tumours) that occur at the bifurcation of the left 
and right hepatic ducts, and extrahepatic cholan-
giocarcinomas and gall - bladder cancers (Figures 
 10.1  and  10.2 ). They are seen at increased fre-
quency in patients with ulcerative colitis and 
primary sclerosing cholangitis. In South East Asia, 
where these tumours are common, they are seen in 
association with biliary infestation with liver ﬂ ukes 
( Clonorchis sinensis  and  Opisthorchis viverrini ). 
 Presentation 
 Patients with hepatobiliary cancer generally 
present with advanced disease. Typical presenta-
tions are with jaundice, liver pain and weight loss.

A patient with a suspected diagnosis of hepatobil-
iary cancer should be referred to the appropriate 
surgical unit for investigation. The management of 
these conditions is very complex and should only 
be in centres of excellence with highly specialized 
surgical units, who achieve signiﬁ cantly better 
results. 
 Standard investigations for patients with hepa-
tocellular cancer should include blood counts, 
liver function tests, renal function tests, chest 
X - rays, ultrasound assessment and CT imaging. 
Ultrasonography has developed considerably over 
the last decade, and these technical improvements 
have been matched by improved standards in 
endoscopic assessment of the patient. Hepatobil-
iary cancers are associated with raised serum levels 
of AFP, which is characteristically raised to many 
thousands of ng/ml. In patients with cirrhosis, 
who may have AFP levels raised to a few hundreds 
of ng/ml, increasing levels are clues to the develop-
ment of hepatobiliary cancer. CEA and CA199 are 
useful markers in the monitoring of hepatobiliary 
tumours. 
 Characteristically, patients with these tumours 
will commonly present with jaundice, and this 
presentation requires external stenting to stabilize 
the patient, enable investigations to take place 
and surgery to be considered. After staging, histo-
logical conﬁ rmation of the presence of a tumour 
should be obtained by percutaneous endoscopic 
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with 
needle aspiration or brush cytology or by liver 
biopsy. 
 Staging and  g rading 
 Hepatobiliary tumours are described as well, mod-
erately or poorly differentiated. Staging for hepatic 
and billiary tract tumours is according to the TNM 
classiﬁ cation.  
 Treatment 
 Liver resection is the only treatment that offers a 
chance for cure for liver cancer. Surgery is limited 
by the degree of spread of the tumour and the pres-
ence or absence of background cirrhosis. The aim 
of surgery generally is to remove the lobe of the 
liver containing the tumour. It may be possible for 
patients with hepatobiliary cancer to be treated by

Hepatocellular carcinoma
 Figure 10.3   Selective angiography of 
the right hepatic artery showing a 
small area of hypervascularity due to 
hepatocellular carcinoma. As this was 
inoperable (there were four other 
lesions in different segments of the 
liver), it was treated by transcatheter 
arterial chemoembolization (TACE).  
liver transplantation and, if this is the case, the 
chance of survival increases dramatically. It is esti-
mated that just 10% of patients with liver cancers 
have operable tumours. When curative surgery is 
not possible, hepatic embolization, sclerotherapy 
and chemotherapy may be appropriate (Figure 
 10.3 ). Tumours of the biliary tree are chemosensi-
tive and very, very rarely operable. Similar treat-
ment programmes are used in this condition as in 
hepatocellular cancer. Major problems have come 
for patients as a result of obstruction of the biliary 
tree, and this is actively treated by percutaneous or 
endoscopic stenting. This leads to relief of obstruc-
tion and to a useful, though limited, extension of 
life. Tumour embolization is now a much more 
commonly used procedure. Transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization is performed, where a mixture 
of chemotherapy, with radio - opaque contrast and 
an embolic agent, is injected into the right or left 
hepatic artery (see Figure  10.2 ). Other approaches 
include radiofrequency ablation, which uses high -
 frequency radiowaves to heat up and destroy 
tumours, using electrodes inserted into the tumour 
under image guidance. A third treatment for local-
ized unresectable tumours is percutaneous ethanol 
injection. 
 Prognosis 
 Five - year survival for patients with operable liver 
cancer is in the order of 33% when management 
involves partial liver resection. The ﬁ ve - year sur-
vival of patients transplanted is 80%. The median 
survival of patients who are not treated with cura-
tive intent is six to seven months (Table  10.1 ). The 
median survival of patients in the Far East is much 
poorer, and the vast majority die within two to 
three months of diagnosis.  
 New  t reatment  
 We have great hope that mortality from liver 
tumours will decrease signiﬁ cantly in the next few 
years. The reason for this is the development of 
 Table 10.1   Five - year survival rates of patients with hepatic 
and biliary tract cancers.

effective campaigns for vaccination against hepati-
tis B. However, there is considerable concern in 
Europe that the rising prevalence of hepatitis C, for 
which no vaccine is available, will lead to a rise in 
deaths from this condition. 
 There have been major changes over the last few 
years in our understanding of the molecular basis 
for hepatobiliary cancer, with the identiﬁ cation of 
cell surface receptors for VEGFR (vascular endothe-
lial growth factor receptor) and EGFR (epidermal 
growth factor receptor). Treatments targeting these 
receptors and pioneered for patients with renal cell 
cancer have been found to be effective in hepato-
biliary cancer. Responses are seen to sunitinib and 
sorafenib, but the use and value of these agents, 
though clear, has been, as ever, stymied by the 
action of the National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK. This action 
by NICE seems particularly bizarre in the context 
of a clear evidence base demonstrating a doubling 
of survival time with sorafenib in a large phase III 
clinical trial.

Pancreatic  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Carcinoma of the pancreas has increased in inci-
dence over the last decade. It is the tenth most 
common cancer, and is now the ﬁ fth most fre-
quent cause of cancer deaths. There is an equal 
incidence between the sexes, and annually in the 
UK there are about 7700 deaths. It is very sad to 
note that registration ﬁ gures virtually equal mor-
tality rates. There is an increased risk of developing 
pancreatic cancer with age. In the 1980s it was sug-
gested that excessive coffee consumption predis-
posed to the development of cancer of the pancreas, 
but this has subsequently been refuted. Smoking is 
also associated with an increased risk of this disease 
of between two - and ﬁ ve - fold. Diabetes, obesity 
and chronic pancreatitis all increase the risk of 
pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic exocrine cancers 
constitute well over 90% of all pancreatic malig-
nancies and are adenocarcinomas. Pancreatic ade-
nocarcinoma is believed to arise from ductal 
epithelial cells that progress through stages of pan-
creatic intraepithelial neoplasia with the sequen-
tial accumulation of somatic mutations in several 
genes including the oncogene K - RAS and the 
tumour suppressor genes P53, P16/CDKN2A and 
SMAD4/DPC4. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells 
express a wide variety of receptors that are poten-
tial therapeutic targets including epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) receptors, vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) receptors and insulin - like growth 
factor (IGF) receptors. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
also expresses a wide variety of hormone receptors, 
and these include receptors for somatostatin, 
gonadotrophin - releasing hormone, steroid hor-
mones, insulin - like growth factors and VEGFs. It 
should be emphasized that these receptors are 
present in carcinomas, and that they are not 
present in the unusual secretory endocrine pancre-
atic tumours. The rare endocrine tumours of the 
pancreas are known as islet cell tumours or nesidi-
oblastomas and include gastrinomas, insulinomas 
and pancreatic carcinoids. These tumours may be 
functional or non - secretory. 
 Presentation 
 Patients with carcinoma of the pancreas present 
with many different symptoms. These include 
abdominal and back pain, weight loss, anorexia 
and fatigue. In many patients the disease is asymp-
tomatic, until they present with obstructive jaun-
dice. Other, less common presentations include 
superﬁ cial venous thrombosis (Trousseau ’ s sign), a 
palpable gall bladder in the presence of obstructive 
jaundice (Courvoisier ’ s law states that this is 
unlikely to be due to gall stones) and diabetes.

ings, suction of the pancreatic duct or biopsy. 
ERCP is more invasive than other diagnostic 
imaging modalities and carries a signiﬁ cant com-
plication rate so it is usually reserved for patients 
with biliary obstruction who require stenting. A 
failure to obtain a diagnosis by endoscopy should 
be followed by further investigation. Fine needle 
aspiration cytology under CT scan is usually suc-
cessful at obtaining a tissue diagnosis.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 As with other cancers, numerous different staging 
systems are used including the TNM classiﬁ cation. 
The group staging system is summarized below: 
  ●    Stage I: cancer conﬁ ned to the pancreas (T1N0M0 
if  < 2  cm, T2N0M0 if  > 2  cm) 
  ●    Stage II: cancer has grown into the adjacent duo-
denum or bile duct but not spread to the lymph 
nodes (T3N0M0)  
  ●    Stage III: cancer has spread to the lymph nodes 
with (T3N1M0) or without (T1 – 2N1M0) direct 
tumour extension  
  ●    Stage IVA: cancer has invaded into the stomach, 
spleen, colon or nearby large blood vessels, and 
lymph nodes may (T4N1M0) or may not (T4N0M0) 
be involved  
  ●    Stage IVB: there is spread to distant organs by 
metastases (T1 – 4N0 – 1M1). 
 The vast majority of pancreatic cancers are exo-
crine adenocarcinomas of ductal origin and they 
are graded as either well, moderately or poorly dif-
ferentiated tumours. The tiny minority of endo-
crine tumours are classiﬁ ed according to the 
products that they secrete.  
 Treatment 
 There is considerable nihilism attached, quite 
reasonably, to the treatment of a patient with 
pancreatic cancer. The initial management con-
sists of relieving symptoms of pain and obstructive 
jaundice. For less than 20% of patients is there any 
hope for operability, as deﬁ ned by imaging. No 
attempt should be made to proceed to surgery until 
the jaundice has completely resolved. Jaundice is 
dealt with by relief of biliary obstruction, either by 
late presentation is very common. The patient 
with a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic cancer 
should be referred by his or her GP to a general 
surgeon or a gastroenterologist and be seen in out-
patients within two weeks of receipt of the GP ’ s 
letter of referral. The clinician should organize a 
number of tests, which include full blood count, 
renal and liver function tests, a chest X - ray and a 
CT scan of the abdomen (Figure  11.1 ). Abdominal 
ultrasonography is also helpful but endoscopic 
ultrasound (EUS) is probably the most valuable 
diagnostic test when coupled with percutaneous 
needle biopsy. The measurement of serum levels of 
the carbohydrate antigen tumour marker CA19 - 9 
is less helpful in the diagnosis of cancer of the pan-
creas as it may be elevated in most causes of 
obstructive jaundice (false positive) and may be 
normal in patients with pancreatic cancer (false 
negative). CA19 - 9 is, however, useful in monitor-
ing cancer of the pancreas in patients with raised 
levels at diagnosis.  
 Investigation of the patient with pancreatic 
cancer is aimed at establishing the diagnosis and 
deﬁ ning operability. After the initial tests have 
been carried out, the patient should proceed to 
EUS or, if not available, endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP). 
At 
ERCP, 
cytology specimens may be obtained from brush-

programmes have response rates of up to 40%, but 
the median duration of survival of these respond-
ing patients is just one month longer than might 
be expected without active treatment. Because 
pancreatic cancer is relatively common, a number 
of chemotherapy agents have been tried for this 
condition. The consensus view is that combina-
tion therapy using the more active agents, such as 
anthracyclines and taxanes, offers little beneﬁ t. 
The more drugs that are combined, the more toxic-
ity, without an improvement in survival. The 
current consensus view is that single - agent gemcit-
abine probably offers as good an opportunity for 
disease palliation as does any combination 
regimen, although in practice it is often combined 
with cisplatin. Gemcitabine is easy to administer 
and has little toxicity. Quality of life issues are par-
amount in this condition because of the poor prog-
nosis for inoperable disease. 
 An alternative approach to the management of 
pancreatic cancer is to treat symptoms. This is 
managed by stenting to relieve jaundice and by 
coeliac axis block. This procedure blocks the pain 
ﬁ bres originating from the pancreas and ensures 
good quality of life. The technique requires skill 
and is relatively well tolerated.  
 Prognosis 
 The outlook for patients with operable pancreatic 
cancer is unfortunately not particularly good, with 
a 20% chance of ﬁ ve - year survival. The outlook for 
those patients with locally advanced or metastastic 
disease is very poor, with a median survival of three 
to four months. It is for this reason that there is 
such an emphasis upon quality of life in pancreatic 
cancer, rather than on the prospects for cure.  
 New  t reatment 
 The expression by pancreatic cancer cells of numer-
ous receptors and the poor results with systemic 
chemotherapy has led to strategies targeting these 
receptors. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibi-
tors including the protein kinase inhibitor erlo-
tinib and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab 
have been studied with limited success. The VEGF 
endoscopic stenting or by percutaneous transhe-
patic stenting of the biliary system. Pain may be 
relieved by the use of opiates or may resolve with 
the relief of biliary obstruction. At laparotomy, just 
30% of those 20% of patients with radiologically 
operable disease turns out to have surgically oper-
able tumours. 
 Pancreatic surgery requires a considerable degree 
of specialization and should not be carried out 
outside of the setting of a specialist treatment 
centre. The reason for this is simple: specialist 
centres achieve better survival rates and lower mor-
bidity and mortality rates. The operation of choice 
is Whipple ’ s procedure, and this involves removal 
of the distal half of the stomach (antrectomy), gall 
bladder (cholecystectomy), distal common bile 
duct (choledochectomy), head of the pancreas, 
duodenum and proximal jejunum, and regional 
lymph nodes. Reconstruction consists of attaching 
the pancreas to the jejunum (pancreaticojejunos-
tomy), the common bile duct to the jejunum 
(choledochojejunostomy), and the stomach to 
the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy), to allow bile, 
digestive juices and food to ﬂ ow! There are modiﬁ -
cations of this procedure, such as the pylorus - 
conserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, that are 
associated with less postoperative morbidity and 
equivalent efﬁ cacy. 
 Thirty years ago, surgery for pancreatic cancer 
was associated with a very high morbidity of 
approximately 25%. This has fallen in specialist 
centres to 5%, with the expectation that 20% of 
patients with operable disease will survive ﬁ ve 
years. Ampullary carcinomas of the pancreas gen-
erally present with early - stage disease because of 
their anatomical position. These tumours are asso-
ciated with better prognoses than cancers of the 
rest of the pancreas. There is no role whatsoever for 
adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 
 Treatment of  i noperable  d isease 
 Patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer have a 
poor prognosis and the treatment of this condition 
is palliative. The median survival is four to six 
months. Active treatment with chemotherapy may 
be advised. The most successful chemotherapy

yGTP that is incorporated into replicating DNA 
causing strand termination. This GDEPT strategy 
inhibited gene expression and cell growth of 
pancreatic cancer cell lines. The technique has 
been extensively modiﬁ ed with different viral 
vectors as well as different enzyme and prodrug 
combinations. 
 Pancreatic  e ndocrine  t umours 
 This is a fascinating group of tumours, interesting 
not only because of their biology, but also because 
patients with these tumours are expected to do 
well. Pancreatic endocrine tumours include carci-
noids, insulinomas, glucagonomas, gastrinomas 
and Vipomas. The bizarre constellation of symp-
toms produced by carcinoids are well known even 
to medical students, as are the gastrointestinal 
pathway has also been targeted with the anti - VEGF 
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab and receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors of VEGF receptors 
including sorafenib. Again the results have disap-
pointed. The IGF pathway that is activated in pan-
creatic and other cancers is a novel target for 
therapeutic strategies and monoclonal antibodies 
targeting both the ligand (IGF1 and IGF2) and the 
receptor (IGF receptor 1, IGFR1) are under investi-
gation along with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tors of IGFR1. 
 The transfer of suicide genes to tumour cells by 
retroviral vectors has also been applied in pancre-
atic cancer cell lines. This approach is known as 
gene - directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT). 
The adenovirus vector that was used carried the 
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene that 
phosphorylates the prodrug ganciclovir into deox-

symptoms resulting from Vipomas, and the hypo - 
and hyperglycaemia from insulinomas and gluca-
gonomas respectively (Table  11.1 ). Old school 
general physicians will expect that every medical 
student reading this book will be able to recount 
the ten skin conditions associated with carcinoid 
tumours, as well as describe the reasons for the 
effects of this tumour on the heart. They will take 
delight in quizzing you on their ward rounds so we 
suggest that you google them if there is an inpa-
tient with carcinoid on your ward.  
 These endocrine malignancies are associated 
with enormously long natural histories, which 
may date back over decades. 
 The major treatment options for pancreatic 
endocrine tumours include octreotide to decrease 
hormonal secretion, and chemoembolization to 
reduce the symptoms that result from tumour 
bulk. Octreotide is an octapeptide mimic of soma-
tostatin that inhibits the secretion of a whole host 
of peptide hormones including gastrin, glucagon, 
growth hormone, insulin, pancreatic polypeptide 
(PP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). 
Octreotide also reduces pancreatic and intestinal 
ﬂ uid secretion, hence its use in the management of 
malignant bowel obstruction. Octreotide has a 
median period of effect of one year in carcinoids, 
but leads to no clinical evidence of disease regres-
sion. Interferon may also lead to a reduction in 
secretory symptoms of carcinoid tumours. Where 
symptoms are signiﬁ cant and octreotide has failed, 
embolization is considered, both to the primary 
site and to hepatic metastases. Embolization is a 
signiﬁ cant enterprise and is associated in even the 
best centres with mortality rates of 3 – 5%. It should 
therefore be considered with great care before it is 
undertaken. 
 There has been considerable debate as to whether 
or not interferon causes a reduction in tumour 
mass. The balance of the evidence is in favour of 
interferon having a minor effect in reducing 
tumour bulk.

Colorectal  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Colorectal cancer is a major cause of morbidity in 
the West. Each year in the UK approximately 
37   500 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer 
and 16   000 die of the disease. The incidence has 
risen modestly over the last quarter of a century 
and the ﬁ ve - year overall survival has doubled over 
the same time interval. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
there was increasing recognition of the possibility 
of a dietary basis to colorectal cancer. The disease 
was thought to be uncommon in the developing 
world, whilst the high red meat and low ﬁ bre diet 
and obesity in the more developed market econo-
mies were seen to be responsible for a higher inci-
dence of colorectal cancer. Certainly the EPIC 
(European Prospective Investigation into Cancer 
and Nutrition) study revealed a 55% increase in 
risk for each 100   g/day increase in red meat con-
sumption. This risk with red meat is supported by 
three meta - analyses that revealed signiﬁ cant, 
although smaller, risks. High ﬁ bre diets increase 
the transit time of the stool and decrease the color-
ectal epithelial exposure to carcinogens within the 
stool. The EPIC study also demonstrated a modest 
20% reduction (mainly of left - sided colon cancers) 
in risk amongst the highest ﬁ bre eaters. However, 
this association has not been conﬁ rmed in meta -
 analyses despite the constant advise to eat ﬁ ve 
fruits (or vegetables) a day. Nevertheless, the 
authors suggest that you do not tell young children 
this information as the reactions of their mothers 
is wholly unpredictable. Aspirin has been shown to 
have a protective effect against colorectal cancer, 
and epidemiological studies of prolonged aspirin 
use have shown a consistent reduction of up to 
50% in the risk of colorectal cancers. This decrease 
in risk is thought to be due to the inhibitory effect 
of aspirin on cyclooxygenase - 2, which is an 
enzyme found in high concentrations in colorectal 
tissue and promotes the growth of polyps. In rand-
omized studies, aspirin has been shown to reduce 
the incidence of adenomatous polyps in patients 
screened after the excision of a primary colorectal 
tumour. There has, however, only been one single 
randomized trial of aspirin prophylaxis, which has 
shown no evidence for a reduction in colorectal 
cancer incidence and the toxicity, especially the 
risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, means that it 
is premature to recommend aspirin as chemopre-
vention. Patients with both Crohn ’ s disease and 
ulcerative colitis are at risk from developing colonic 
tumours, and this risk rises to nearly 40% after 20 
years follow - up. 
 Up to 20% of patients with colorectal cancer 
have a family history of colorectal cancer. There 
are two signiﬁ cant familial causes for colorectal 
cancer: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) 
and hereditary non - polyposis colorectal cancer 
(HNPCC). FAP is an autosomal dominant condi-

These symptoms are suggestive of malignancy, and 
accordingly an urgent referral should be made to a 
specialist bowel surgeon. The patient should be 
seen within two weeks of receipt of the general 
practitioner ’ s referral letter.  
 Outpatient  d iagnosis 
 In outpatients, the surgeon should take a full 
history from the patient and examine him or her. 
This should include a rectal examination, which 
may show the patient to have melaena. Proctos-
copy and sigmoidoscopy should be performed in 
the outpatient setting. Blood tests should be organ-
ized, which should include a full blood count, 
renal function and liver function tests. A chest 
X - ray should be carried out and a barium enema or 
colonoscopy arranged as an outpatient procedure. 
The barium enema may show narrowing of the 
colon. In malignancy, this narrowing is typical and 
has the appearance of an apple core (Figure  12.1 ). 
Endoscopy may show a stenosing lesion or a polyp. 
Biopsies should be taken of the suspicious area.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 The tumour should be examined histologically. It 
is described as being either well, moderately or 
tion that accounts for 1% of all colorectal cancer. 
The gene for FAP was mapped to chromosome 
5q21 in 1987 and the responsible gene APC was 
cloned in 1991. All patients with FAP develop 
colorectal cancer by the age of 40 years, so prophy-
lactic colectomy is offered to teenagers with FAP. 
HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome, is responsible for 
2 – 5% of colorectal cancers. HNPPC is characterized 
by colorectal cancers occurring at an early age and 
they are often sited in the right side of the colon. In 
addition, HNPCC is associated with endometrial 
carcinoma, and gastric, renal, ureteric and central 
nervous system malignancies. In this condition, 
the genetic abnormalities include microsatellite 
instability and mutated mismatch - repair genes 
(most frequently hMSH2 and hMLH1). In the vast 
majority of non - inherited colorectal malignancy, 
the molecular changes consist of a sequential accu-
mulation of mutations in genes including p53, and 
deletion of the colorectal gene (DCC), K - Ras and 
APC.

poorly differentiated. The original staging system 
for colorectal cancer was reported by Cuthbert 
Esquire Dukes, a British pathologist, in 1932. With 
various modiﬁ cations this system is still in use 
today. A Dukes ’ stage is given, and this reﬂ ects the 
degree of invasion of the tumour. Dukes ’ stage A is 
speciﬁ ed when a tumour is conﬁ ned to the mucosa. 
Dukes ’  stage B is a tumour that perforates the 
serosa, and Dukes ’ stage C is given when lymph 
nodes are affected. Tumours of the colon are, 
furthermore, divided according to their anatomi-
cal sub - sites. These are the appendix, caecum, 
ascending colon, hepatic ﬂ exure, transverse colon, 
splenic ﬂ exure, descending colon and sigmoid 
colon. Finally, the tumour can be staged according 
to the TNM clinical classiﬁ cation system (Table 
 12.1 ). 
 Treatment 
 The suspicion of malignancy having been raised, 
the patient should be worked up for surgery includ-
ing an assessment of operability by CT scanning. 
The CT scan will show whether or not there are 
enlarged lymph nodes within the abdomen and 
will deﬁ ne the possibility of further spread involv-
ing the liver. If there is no gross evidence of dis-
semination, the patient should be admitted to 
hospital for colectomy or an abdominoperitoneal 
resection. Removal of the primary is still consid-
ered in the presence of metastatic disease, to reduce 
the risk of perforation or obstruction. 
 The surgical plan depends upon the experience 
and practice of the clinician. There have been con-
siderable developments in the area of laparoscopic 
surgery. If the patient is therefore considered to be 
an appropriate candidate, a laparoscopic colec-
tomy might be performed. The results of rectal 
surgery are critically surgeon dependent, and 
much better results are obtained in centres where 
the surgeon specializes in this procedure. 
 Surgery for  c olonic  c ancer 
 At operation, a midline incision should be per-
formed and the abdominal contents inspected. 
The tumour should be mobilized and removed 
together with a good margin of normal tissue. The 
tumour should be inspected and frozen sections 
performed, to ensure that the resection edges of 
the apparently normal gut contain no tumour. 
An end - to - end anastomosis is then made. If the 
patient is found to have three to ﬁ ve liver metas-
tases at operation, these should be resected at an 
appropriate time, as successful resection is associ-
ated with a good prognosis and the possibility of 
cure. If there are more metastases, no operative 
action should be taken. Extensive resection of 
the lymph nodes should be performed, providing 
histopathological information which affects the 
patient ’ s management.  
 Surgery for  r ectal  c ancers 
 The surgery that is performed depends upon the 
site of the carcinoma and a preoperative assess-
ment of operability. Tumours of the upper and 
middle third of the rectum are treated by anterior 
resection. In this procedure, the rectum is mobi-
lized from the sacral hollow, and the tumour is 
removed together with an adequate margin of 
normal tissue. This normal margin ranges between

notecan and bevacizumab, which are all of beneﬁ t 
in this disease, may be considered with or without 
a 5FU and folinic acid - containing adjuvant treat-
ment programme. Current recommendations are 
for treatment with 5FU, which may be adminis-
tered intravenously, or as the oral analogue of 5FU, 
capecitabine. The patient might also be offered an 
oral combination chemotherapy regimen with the 
acronym UFT, containing tegafur and uracil. Treat-
ment may be given in combination with folinic 
acid and irinotecan in the FOLFIRI regimen, or 
with folinic acid and oxaliplatin in the FOLFOX 
regimen. 
 Adjuvant  t reatment for  r ectal  c ancer 
 Patients with rectal cancer may receive preopera-
tive radiotherapy. This has been shown to limit 
pelvic recurrence. It is disputed whether adjuvant 
radiotherapy improves survival. Alternatively, 
after the patient has recovered from surgery, he or 
she may receive pelvic radiotherapy. This has been 
shown in randomized studies to decrease the risk 
of pelvic recurrence by 5 – 10%. Patients with more 
advanced tumours (T3 and T4) may be treated with 
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery, in 
addition to radiotherapy. There is increased post-
operative morbidity with chemotherapy given in 
conjunction with radiotherapy.  
 Management of  m etastatic  d isease 
 In the situation where there are limited metastases 
from colorectal cancer, consideration is given to 
the possibility of curative surgical treatment. If the 
patient is ﬁ t, and there are three to ﬁ ve hepatic 
metastases or less than three pulmonary metas-
tases, resection may be considered to be appropri-
ate. If surgery is successful, then the prognosis is 
relatively good, with survival chances ranging up 
to 40% at ﬁ ve years. 
 Generally, however, metastatic colorectal carci-
noma has a poor prognosis, and the current recom-
mendation for appropriate treatment is with 
5FU - based regimens and radiotherapy. There is 
debate as to whether or not the addition of folinic 
acid is of an advantage to the patient. The current 
consensus is that there is a beneﬁ t at least in terms 
2 and 5   cm. The mesorectum and lateral pararectal 
tissue should be removed. Lesions of the lower 
third of the rectum are treated by abdominoperi-
neal resection, which requires a permanent colos-
tomy. The rectum is mobilized, and the peritoneum 
at the base of the bladder or posterior vagina is 
incised. The lateral ligaments are divided and the 
anus excised. The quality of surgery in rectal cancer 
is critically important. Extensive lymphadenec-
tomy is associated with signiﬁ cantly improved 
chances for survival.  
 Complications of  s urgery 
 A neurogenic bladder is very common after pelvic 
surgery but will usually recover within 10 days. 
Ureteric tears or transections may complicate 
surgery, but only rarely so. Sexual dysfunction in 
males is inevitable, and the most common prob-
lems are retrograde ejaculation and erectile impo-
tence. Change in sexual function in women has 
not been assessed. Surgery is complicated by a mor-
tality rate of 1 – 2%. 
 Adjuvant  t reatment for  c olonic  c ancer 
 Following recovery from surgery, no additional 
treatment is recommended for patients with 
Dukes ’  stage A disease. The value of adjuvant 
chemotherapy for Dukes ’ B disease remains con-
troversial. This is because no major advantage has 
been shown for adjuvant chemotherapy within 
this group of patients. Patients with Dukes ’ C 
tumours, however, should receive adjuvant chem-
otherapy. The reason for this is that there is a sur-
vival advantage in this group of patients. Treatment 
should be with a 5 - ﬂ uorouracil (5FU) - containing 
programme. There is considerable contention as to 
which is the optimal treatment schedule. In the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, the use of levamisole 
was prevalent, but treatment with this agent is no 
longer recommended. At present we have a pleth-
ora of agents that are active in metastatic colorectal 
cancer. The current problem is to know which 
agent or combination of agents are the most effec-
tive in prolonging survival in the adjuvant setting. 
The active agents, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, iri-

from 18 months to almost 2 years. In this context, 
the cost of treatment becomes a signiﬁ cant politi-
cal issue but, amongst the discussion on the poli-
tics of cancer care, little attention seems to be paid 
to the cost of not treating the patient. Dying from 
metastatic colorectal cancer without drug treat-
ment is an expensive process, and the authors of 
this chapter are not merely considering ﬁ nancial 
cost when we make this statement.  
 Screening 
 It is estimated that there may be a genetic predispo-
sition to colorectal cancer in more than 20% of 
patients with these tumours. In the vast majority 
of colorectal cases there is, however, at present no 
direct evidence of there being a genetic risk. 
Patients with a risk of developing colorectal 
tumours can be stratiﬁ ed as having low, low – mod-
erate, moderate, moderate – high or high risk of 
developing malignancy. The criteria for proceed-
ing to screening for these patients are deﬁ ned as in 
Table  12.2 . 
of remission rates, although no consensus has been 
reached regarding survival. The treatment regimen 
of ﬁ rst choice was called the  ‘ De Gramont regimen ’ 
and includes fortnightly 5FU and folinic acid given 
for six months. A host of new treatments have 
recently become available for patients with color-
ectal cancer. The most commonly used chemo-
therapy regimens are FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. The 
addition of irinotecan and oxaliplatin to 5FU in 
these regimens has improved median survival 
from 9 to 18 months. Recently the addition of bev-
acizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody 
against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
to both the FOLFOX and FOLFIRI regimens has led 
to a further modest improvement in survival. 
Cetuximab, a partially humanized monoclonal 
antibody against the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR), and panitumumab, a fully 
humanized antibody against EGFR, have both 
been shown to prolong survival in patients with 
metastatic colon cancer that lack mutations in 
K - Ras. As a result of the use of these agents, survival 
in metastatic colorectal cancer has been extended

 In 2006, bowel cancer screening using faecal 
occult blood (FOB) tests was introduced in England. 
It is estimated that if the uptake of FOB testing 
reaches 60% by the year 2026, 20   000 deaths from 
bowel cancer will be prevented. For every 1000 
faecal occult blood tests completed, 20 will be 
abnormal and 16 patients will proceed to a colon-
oscopy, six of these will have polyps, two will have 
cancer, and eight a normal colonoscopy. The cost 
estimate equation for FOB testing is  £ 1000 for each 
life - year saved. FOB testing will miss tumours and 
lead to a number of false positive ﬁ ndings. Colon-
oscopy is a more accurate means of detecting 
cancers but requires full bowel preparation, seda-
tion and carries a risk of perforation (around one in 
1500). Although the costs of colonoscopy for 
screening normal populations is, unfortunately, 
not economic, it is the investigation of choice for 
high - risk populations (Table  12.2 ). 
 New  t reatment 
 This is one group of tumours where we are 
delighted to report that a host of golden opportu-
nities for our patients have arisen. The develop-
ment of drugs targeting angiogenesis such as 
bevacuvimab and the EGFRs such as cetuximab 
have led to real improvements is survival.

Genitourinary  c ancers 
 The treatment of testicular cancer is one of the few 
solid cancers in adults that may be successfully 
cured even in the presence of metastases. This has 
only been achievable in the last 40 years, since the 
introduction of cisplatin chemotherapy. Cisplatin 
was discovered serendipitously by Barnett Rosen-
berg, a physicist at Michigan State University, in 
1965. He studied the effects of electric currents on 
 Escherichia coli  using platinum electrodes in a water 
bath and found that they stopped dividing but not 
growing, leading to bacteria up to 300 times longer 
than normal. This was found to be due to cisplatin, 
a product from the platinum electrodes, which was 
interfering with DNA replication. Following this, 
Professor Sir Alexander Haddow, the then head of 
the Chester Beatty Institute in London, showed 
that cisplatin was active against melanoma in 
mice, and clinical trials with human patients began 
in 1972. 
 The genitourinary tract is one of the most fre-
quent sites of cancer in men and includes prostate 
cancer, which has emerged as the most common 
tumour in men (excluding non - melanomatous 
skin cancers). Table  13.1  shows the registration 
data for these tumours for southeast England in 
2001 and the ﬁ ve - year survivals.  
 Cancer of the genitourinary tract includes 
cancers of the kidneys, bladder, prostate and testes, 
which are discussed in more detail in the next four 
chapters .

Kidney  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Renal carcinoma is not a particularly common 
cancer and causes approximately 3% of deaths 
from malignancy in the UK. In 2006 about 7840 
people developed renal cancers in the UK per year 
and there were approximately 3700 deaths. Renal 
cancers may arise from the kidney nephrons or 
from the collecting systems. The histology is differ-
ent for these two tumours and is described, respec-
tively, as  ‘ renal cell ’ for tumours arising from the 
nephrons and  ‘ transitional cell ’ for tumours arising 
from the transitional cell epithelium of the collect-
ing system. There is evidence for a genetic predis-
position to this disease in a small percentage of 
patients. Renal cell cancer has an increased inci-
dence in patients with von Hippel – Lindau disease 
and tuberous sclerosis. Transitional cell tumours 
may be caused by tobacco. 
 There has been increasing interest in the molec-
ular genetics of renal cell cancer. This is concen-
trated around the importance of the loss of 
heterozygosity at chromosome 3p and the inacti-
vation of the von Hippel – Lindau gene. Both are 
associated with the development of renal cell 
cancers. In one recent study there was loss of het-
erozygosity around chromosome 3p in 96% of con-
ventional histology renal cell cancers, although in 
tumours with less common pathologies, such as 
the papillary and chromophobe variants, these 
changes are far less frequent. It is therefore likely 
that the loss of heterozygosity represents the loss 
of a speciﬁ c tumour suppressor gene for renal cell 
cancer, and this ﬁ ts in with conventional models 
for the development of malignancy. There are 
chromosomal changes in non - clear cell tumours 
too. The PTEN/MMAC1 tumour suppressor gene is 
lost in up to 90% of patients with chromophobe 
renal cell carcinoma, and so the molecular pathol-
ogy of renal cell cancer deﬁ nes a speciﬁ c pheno-
type. Other changes have also been noted, 
involving chromosome 16q and 14q. A stepwise 
progression of molecular changes similar to those 
that are well described in colorectal tumours seems 
to characterize renal cell cancer. These molecular 
changes are completely different from those seen 
in papillary tumours, which are characterized by 
loss of the Y chromosome and multiple trisomy. In 
clear cell renal cancer, 3p loss leads to inactivation 
of hypoxia - inducible factors. This in turn leads to 
activation of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR), with resultant new vessel formation and 
tumour development. VEGFR and EGFR upregula-
tion are features of renal cell cancer that have been 
exploited for treatment, and this will be discussed 
in more detail below.

tional cell cancer (TCC) of the renal pelvis arises in the col-
lecting system and may be associated with TCC of the 
bladder and ureter. The biology, prognosis and treatment 
are similar to those of bladder cancer.

body and posterior elements of the third lumbar vertebra. This is associated with extension into the spinal canal causing 
cauda equine compression and through the neural foramen into the psoas muscle.  
 Presentation 
 Patients with renal cancers commonly present 
with pain in the loins or blood in the urine. Other 
symptoms include joint pains, symptoms due to 
anaemia, a varicocele, generalized symptoms of 
malignancy, such as weight loss and cachexia, and 
symptoms due to a spread of the disease to meta-
static sites such as brain, lung or bone. If a diagno-
sis of renal carcinoma is suspected, the patient 
should be referred to a urologist. Renal cell cancers 
are characteristically associated with paraneoplas-
tic syndromes, which include polycythemia and 
pyrexia of unknown origin.  
 Outpatient  d iagnosis 
 The urologist will assess the patient in the outpa-
tient clinic, taking a full medical history and exam-
ining the patient. Investigations to be organized 
will include full blood count, liver and renal func-
tion tests and a chest X - ray. Further investigation 
will also include a CT scan of the abdomen (Figure 
 14.1 ) and the thorax to deﬁ ne operability. Angiog-
raphy and an intravenous urogram (IVU) (Figure 
 14.2 ) may also have to be performed.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 The majority of renal tumours are adenocarcino-
mas of renal cell origin. Approximately 2% of renal 
cancers are of transitional cell histology, arising 
from the collecting system rather than from the 
renal parenchyma. Both adenocarcinomas and 
transitional cell tumours are described as well, 
poorly or moderately differentiated. Nuclear 
grading, into four Fuhrman categories, is strongly 
correlated with prognosis. Only rarely is the kidney 
involved, either with a primary lymphoma or as the 
site of the spread of other cancers. The kidney can

5%. In hospitals where it is not possible to treat by 
angioinfarction, radiation to the kidney may be 
given. 
 Adjuvant  t reatment 
 Local radiotherapy to the tumour bed following 
nephrectomy leads to no survival advantage in 
patients with adenocarcinoma and has morbidity. 
This is therefore not recommended. Similarly, 
adjuvant chemotherapy has no survival advan-
tage. The value of adjuvant immunotherapy con-
tinues to be investigated; ﬁ ndings reported up to 
and including the year 2005, however, have shown 
no beneﬁ t. This includes treatment with inter-
leukin 2 (IL - 2) for poor prognosis tumours. The 
situation may possibly be different in transitional 
cell tumours. The outlook is very poor for these 
cancers, so adjuvant chemotherapy is given in 
some centres.  
 Management of  m etastatic  k idney 
 c ancer 
 Where there are single sites or limited numbers of 
metastases, there is a surgical option that needs to 
be considered. The removal of limited numbers of 
pulmonary metastases, or brain or bone metas-
tases, leads to a chance for cure. Where there are 
multiple metastases the situation is different. 
There have been signiﬁ cant changes in the man-
agement of metastatic disease as a result of our 
understanding of the molecular biology of this 
group of tumours. 
 Chemotherapy 
 Chemotherapy is generally ineffective in the treat-
ment of adenocarcinoma of the kidney. The most 
active of the agents, which include the vinca alka-
loids, produce responses in less than 10% of 
patients. Chemotherapy is given in the treatment 
of transitional cell tumours. The response rate of 
60 – 70% is similar to that seen in patients with 
transitional cell cancer of the bladder. Unfortu-
nately, these responses are transient and last for a 
median time of six to seven months.  
be the site of a rare non - metastasizing malignancy 
called an oncocytoma. The patient with renal cell 
carcinoma is staged according to the spread of the 
disease, using the TNM staging criteria.  
 Treatment 
 Surgery 
 If the patient has no evidence of spread of the 
disease, then the urological surgeon will arrange 
for the patient to be admitted for nephrectomy. At 
operation, the kidney and vascular pedicle and 
associated lymph nodes are removed, together 
with the ureter and adrenal. Renal tumours have a 
propensity to invade along the renal vein. This 
invasion may extend into the inferior vena cava 
(IVC) and right atrium. It does not represent a true 
invasion but a tumour thrombus. If this is sus-
pected, then a combined approach involving a 
urologist and a vascular surgeon is advised in an 
attempt to fully resect the tumour.  
 Management of an  i noperable 
 p rimary  t umour 
 Locally advanced, inoperable kidney cancer may 
cause signiﬁ cant symptoms, which may be poorly 
controlled by systemic palliative measures. These 
local symptoms can include haematuria, which 
may be so profound that regular blood transfusion 
is required, as well as loin pain, which may not 
respond to opiate analgesia. These symptoms can 
be treated by angioinfarction, where agents are 
introduced into the renal artery to occlude the 
tumour ’ s blood supply. A number of different 
agents can be introduced into the renal artery. 
These include steel coils and chemotherapy pellets. 
By these means, successful symptom palliation is 
achieved in approximately 70 – 80% of all patients. 
The procedure does have signiﬁ cant morbidity, 
which includes a transient increase in pain, fever 
and, occasionally, shock due to the release of 
tumour products into the circulation. These symp-
toms peak a few hours after the procedure but may 
continue for up to 10 days. There is a speciﬁ c mor-
tality associated with the procedure, ranging up to

ing of IL - 2 treatments. Currently, IL - 2 is given with 
interferon. Cytokine treatment may be improved 
by combination with chemotherapy, but this is 
controversial. Transitional cell tumours do not 
respond to immunotherapy.  
 New  t reatment 
 Unfortunately the effective treatment of patients 
with renal cell cancer has been held back in the 
United Kingdom by the action of the National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). 
The bureaucratic processes that regulate NICE have 
delayed by at least three years effective treatment 
for this condition, and caused the unnecessary and 
early death of many patients. In ﬁ nally coming to 
a view as to the efﬁ cacy of modern therapies for 
renal cell cancer, false cost calculations were made, 
and the opinion issued by NICE was changed three 
times before ﬁ nal agreement to allow some effec-
tive treatment for renal cancer patients in the UK. 
Therapy targets VEGFR and EGFR and the tyrosine 
kinases that affect receptor activation using drugs 
such as sunitinib and sorafenib. Response rates 
approach 40%, and those patients who respond do 
appear to have responses that are sustained. Treat-
ment does have toxicity, but these toxicities are 
generally mild. Because treatment targets VEGFR, 
gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel perforation 
may occur. 
 Other new treatments for renal cell cancer 
include temsirolimus and everolimus, which 
inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) 
that is integral to various signal transduction path-
ways. Unfortunately these agents, which are effec-
tive, have also been rejected for use by our patients 
by NICE as a result of what we and most of our col-
leagues believe to be false cost calculations. These 
agents appear to have the same order of efﬁ cacy as 
sunitinib and sorafenib, but are kept as second - line 
therapies for kidney patients after progression on 
sunitinib or sorafenib.  
 Prognosis 
 The prognosis for localized adenocarcinoma of the 
kidney is variable. The survival rate for patients 
with good prognosis tumours is 60 – 80%, but if 
 Hormonal  t herapy 
 Initial reports of the efﬁ cacy of hormonal treat-
ments in the management of renal cell cancer have 
proven to be incorrect. The use of hormonal thera-
pies for renal cell cancer was based upon the obser-
vation over 30 years ago of a response to 
orchiectomy in Syrian golden hamsters bearing 
renal cell tumours. The leap of logic from this 
observation to the use of medroxyprogesterone 
acetate is rather dizzy, but response rates of up to 
30% were described to medroxyprogesterone 
acetate. This order of response has, however, 
not been conﬁ rmed, and the true response rate to 
hormonal agents is probably less than 2%. A wide 
variety of hormonal treatments has been used in 
this condition, including tamoxifen and ﬂ utamide 
in addition to the progestogens. Transitional cell 
tumours do not respond to hormonal therapy.  
 Immunotherapy 
 Until recently, the most important therapy used 
for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the kidney was 
immunotherapy. The ﬁ rst agents used were bacil-
lus Calmette – Guerin (BCG) and  Corynebacterium 
parvum , but these have now been replaced by the 
interferons and interleukin 2. The overall order of 
response to interferon therapy is 15%. Approxi-
mately 5% of patients have a complete response, 
and the median duration of a complete response is 
7 months. There is no incremental rise in response 
with dosages over three mega units weekly of inter-
feron, merely increased toxicity. In 1985, the 
results of treatment with IL - 2 were ﬁ rst published, 
and 60% of patients with kidney cancer were 
reported to respond to treatment. This high 
response rate was not conﬁ rmed in subsequent 
studies, which were nevertheless encouraging in 
that, overall, approximately 20% of patients were 
seen to respond to treatment. 
 The most signiﬁ cant aspect to IL - 2 treatment is 
that responses are durable. Those lucky patients 
who achieve a complete response may be cured of 
their malignancy. In the original dosage regimen, 
treatment had signiﬁ cant toxicities. These toxici-
ties are lower with subcutaneous low - dose schedul-

deprived areas of the UK compared to those who 
live in areas of greater material deprivation. 
Overall, 10% of patients with metastatic renal cell 
cancer survive ﬁ ve years from diagnosis, and this 
group represents a curious feature of the malig-
nancy. Even in the absence of metastases at presen-
tation, the outlook for patients with transitional 
cell tumours is very poor, with 10% surviving for 
one year, and 5% for two years.  
 
there is vascular or capsular invasion, only 40% 
survive 1 year. The median survival for patients 
with metastatic disease is nine months. These sta-
tistics have signiﬁ cantly changed as a result of the 
development of new treatments for kidney cancer. 
Where treatment is allowed, the median survival 
for patients with metastatic disease has been 
extended to two years. Kidney cancer survival is 
signiﬁ cantly longer for those that live in the least

Bladder  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Carcinoma of the bladder is common in the United 
Kingdom. Each year in the UK, approximately 
1020 men and women are registered with the 
disease and 4900 die. Worldwide more than one -
 third of a million people are diagnosed each year 
with bladder cancer. The average age at which 
patients with this condition present to their clini-
cian is 65 years. The most important cause of 
bladder cancer is cigarette smoking. Workers in the 
dye, paint and rubber industries are also at 
increased risk of bladder cancer. 
 There have been many developments in our 
understanding of the molecular biology of bladder 
cancer, and, although these developments have 
not translated directly into treatment advances, 
they do provide signiﬁ cant prognostic informa-
tion. Bladder tumours are thought to progress from 
a localized, superﬁ cial tumour to invasive and then 
metastatic disease. They are often multifocal. In an 
attempt to deﬁ ne the molecular events categoriz-
ing progression, it was originally noted that there 
was identical loss of heterozygosity in multifocal 
bladder 
tumours. 
This 
original 
description, 
however, of what was thought to be a primary 
genetic event in this cancer, has not been con-
ﬁ rmed. Multiple loss of genetic material has been 
described, with the most common losses centred 
on chromosome 9q22, which is the site of a gene 
called  patched (PTC). This is thought to be a tumour 
suppressor gene in basal cell carcinoma and medul-
loblastoma. There are other sites of chromosomal 
loss, particularly within chromosomes 3, 7 and 17. 
This loss of material can be used to follow up 
patients with bladder cancer, using ﬂ uorescence  in 
situ  hybridization (FISH) methodologies on urine 
cytology. 
 By far the most important of the recent ﬁ ndings 
in bladder cancer, however, has been the observa-
tion of overexpression of the human epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR). This is reported in 
around 40% of the tumours of patients with 
bladder cancer. Overexpression correlates with a 
poor prognosis, and treatments directed against 
EGFR may well have some future role as therapies 
for this malignancy.  
 Presentation 
 The initial symptoms include haematuria, dysuria 
and frequency of micturition. These symptoms 
are, unfortunately, sometimes treated with antibi-
otics by GPs for a period of time, prior to referral to 
a specialist. New urinary tract infections in older 
women should always be investigated actively, and 
symptoms occurring in a man should always be

should be biopsied together with areas of sur-
rounding, apparently normal - looking bladder. The 
urologists at cystoscopy may describe a normal -
 looking bladder or the presence of a papilloma or 
solid tumour. The suspicious areas are treated by 
diathermy and the pelvis carefully examined in 
order to describe the clinical staging of the tumour.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 The tumour should then be examined pathologi-
cally and be given a grade according to differentia-
tion. These grades are as follows: 
  ●    G1: well differentiated tumour  
  ●    G2: moderately differentiated tumour  
  ●    G3: poorly differentiated tumour.  
 Lesions are further characterized pathologically 
by their microscopic appearance as either transi-
tional cell carcinoma or squamous carcinoma. 
Approximately 90% of patients in the UK have 
transitional cell carcinomas. The rest are squamous 
carcinomas or adenocarcinomas. There may be 
squamous metaplasia present within a transitional 
cell carcinoma, and this is indicative of a poor 
prognosis. 
 The tumour should also be staged according to 
the T (tumour), N (node) and M (metastatic catego-
ries) system (Table  15.1 ). 
considered to be pathological and a referral made. 
There is of course a differential diagnosis, but one 
should have a very high index of suspicion of 
malignancy. Referral should be promptly organ-
ized to a specialist urological surgeon. The patient 
will be seen in an outpatient clinic. A careful 
history should be taken and an examination made. 
The patient ’ s symptoms should be investigated 
further by performing a blood count, renal func-
tion tests, liver function tests and bacteriological 
and cytological examination of urine, to examine 
for the presence of infection and malignancy. An 
intravenous pyelogram (IVP) may be ordered to 
examine the urothelial tract radiologically or an 
ultrasound investigation carried out.  
 Outpatient  d iagnosis 
 These investigations should be organized promptly 
and the patient reviewed with the result within 
two to three weeks. A ﬂ exible cystoscopy is then 
generally organized and this takes place in the out-
patient setting. If there is any suspicious appear-
ance to the bladder, arrangements should then be 
made for a formal cystoscopy. The patient is anaes-
thetized for this procedure and the urethra and 
bladder carefully examined using a ﬁ breoptic cys-
toscope. Any abnormal areas within the bladder

 Treatment 
 Treatment of  s uperﬁ cial  b ladder  c ancer 
 The majority of transitional cell carcinoma of the 
bladder present as superﬁ cial tumours. After resec-
tion by diathermy at cystoscopy, approximately 
60% of these will recur. The recurrence rate is 
greater where there are multiple tumours, associ-
ated carcinoma  in situ  or poorly differentiated 
tumours. The outlook is best for solitary tumours, 
tumours with good histology and tumours without 
invasion of the lamina propria. There is contro-
versy as to whether or not a solitary superﬁ cial but 
clearly non - invasive tumour should be followed 
up, because recurrence or further papilloma devel-
opment is unusual. There is also debate as to 
whether or not these papillomas should be classi-
ﬁ ed as malignant. 
 The recommendation for follow - up is slightly 
controversial, but in most practices cystoscopy is 
performed three - monthly until the patient is 
tumour free and thereafter six - monthly for two 
years and yearly for three years. Practice varies 
throughout the UK. 
 If tumours are poorly controlled by cystoscopic 
diathermy but remain superﬁ cial, agents may be 
instilled into the bladder to try and control the 
disease. A number of different compounds are 
used, including bacillus Calmette – Guerin (BCG), 
interferon, thiotepa, adriamcyin, mitomycin C, 
mitrozantrone and epodyl. BCG is the treatment of 
choice for carcinoma  in situ , and mitomycin C is 
the most popular treatment of multifocal superﬁ -
cial tumours. Maintenance BCG reduces recur-
rence rates.  
 Treatment of  i nvasive  b ladder  c ancer 
 The treatment of muscle - invasive carcinoma of the 
bladder is by radiation or with surgery. Both have 
similar efﬁ cacy in terms of the control of the 
disease. This varies according to clinical staging: 
40 – 60% of T2 tumours, 25% of T3 tumours and 5% 
of T4 tumours are controlled by radiotherapy or 
surgery. In the UK, radiotherapy is the most widely 
practised treatment, because the patient keeps his 
or her bladder at the end of therapy. Radical cystec-
tomy has a mortality of up to 3%, depending on 
which centre it is performed in. After cystectomy, 
patients must be nursed either in intensive care or 
in high - dependency beds. Continent bladders may 
be fashioned by the surgeon so that the patient 
does not require an ileostomy. Men are invariably 
rendered impotent by cystectomy. Little is known 
of the effects of cystectomy on female sexual func-
tion. There are well - known electrolyte disorders 
associated with ileostomies. 
 Radical radiotherapy is generally given to a total 
dose of 6500   cGy over a six - week period. Treatment 
may be given to the whole pelvis, focusing down 
upon the bladder towards the end of treatment, or 
may be given to the bladder alone. There is a clear 
rationale for treating the bladder alone. Treatment 
of the whole pelvis is given with the aim of shrink-
ing nodal disease, but this is unlikely in the dosage 
regimens used. If nodes in the pelvis are involved, 
there is a signiﬁ cant chance of distant nodal spread 
and so radiation of pelvic node is pointless. Whole 
pelvis radiotherapy has signiﬁ cantly greater toxic-
ity than treatment to the bladder alone, and there 
is no logical reason for using whole pelvis 
radiotherapy. 
 During radiotherapy, the patient may get cystitis 
or proctitis. At the end of treatment, he or she may 
suffer from a small, shrunken bladder as a conse-
quence of radiation ﬁ brosis. Both cystitis and proc-
titis are common after radiotherapy to the bladder, 
occurring in up to 30% of patients. 
 Chemotherapy has been given to patients with 
bladder cancer. Response rates seem to be similar 
to radiotherapy and surgery. The advantage to the 
patient is the avoidance of the long - term side 
effects of radiotherapy and retention of the 
bladder. 
 Treatment of  m etastatic  b ladder  c ancer 
 When bladder cancer has spread beyond the 
bladder it is conventionally treated with chemo-
therapy. Recent advances in the treatment of this 
disease mean that new hope is now offered to 
patients with metastatic cancer. A number of dif-
ferent treatment schedules are used for treatment, 

Bladder cancer Chapter 15
135
including regimes which have the acronyms CMV, 
MVAC and MVMJ. New agents have become avail-
able for the treatment of bladder cancer. These 
include gemcitabine. The standard treatment cur-
rently is combination therapy with gemcitabine 
and cisplatin, chosen for efﬁ cacy and comparative 
lack of toxicity (Figure  15.1 ). 
 Prognosis 
 The consensus view is that diathermy and intra-
vesical chemotherapy prevent the progression of 
superﬁ cial to locally advanced or metastatic disease 
in 40% of cases. Overall, however, approximately 
30% of patients with superﬁ cial tumours develop 
invasive disease. If there is associated carcinoma  in 
situ , over 60% of patients will develop invasive 
cancer. Poorly differentiated superﬁ cial bladder 
cancers have a particularly poor prognosis and are 
treated aggressively. Despite treatment, just 20% of 
patients survive ﬁ ve years. 
 The results of treatment vary from centre to 
centre, but the overall expectation is for an initial 
response in approximately 50% of patients with 
metastatic disease, for a median duration of 9 
months. During the terminal phases of illness,

patients require specialist care for symptom pallia-
tion. The disease may spread to bone, lung or liver, 
and opiate analgesia or local radiotherapy may be 
helpful in easing symptoms (Figure  15.2 ). 
 New  t reatment 
 The major prospects for the development of new 
treatments for bladder cancer are targeted at 
methods of inhibiting the activity of the epidermal 
growth factor receptor. The ﬁ rst in development is 
geﬁ tib (Iressa), but this is just one of a family of at 
least six EGFR targeting therapies in development.

Prostate  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Carcinoma of the prostate is the second most 
common cancer of men in the Western world. The 
latest incidence ﬁ gures suggest that in the UK, 
35   000 men were diagnosed as having prostate 
cancer and that there were over 10   000 deaths. 
Prostate cancer death rates have trebled in the last 
30 years, and the incidence ﬁ gures have increased 
so strikingly that the number of men affected by 
this cancer has overtaken lung cancer as the most 
common of all male cancers in the UK. This is also 
the case in the US, where prostate cancer has 
replaced lung cancer as the most common cancer 
of males. 
 How do we explain this increase in prostate 
cancer incidence? It is very unlikely that there is a 
genetic basis to this dramatic recent change in inci-
dence. What is likely is that there is an environ-
mental risk factor. This can be seen from studies on 
the incidence of cancer in the succeeding genera-
tions of migrating populations  – as well as from 
dietary evidence, we believe. There were huge 
waves of migration from South East Asia to North 
America and Hawaii at the turn of the 19th century. 
Prostate cancer has a very low incidence in Asia. 
The incidence of prostate cancer in the generations 
that followed these waves of migration increased, 
so that in two generations the incidence of prostate 
cancer was almost equivalent to that occurring in 
their Caucasian neighbours. 
 The second line of evidence comes from dietary 
studies, where it has been clearly shown that the 
incidence of prostate cancer in vegetarians is 50 –
 75% that of the incidence in omnivores. There are 
striking correlates between prostate cancer and 
diets containing smoked foods and dairy produce, 
and protective beneﬁ ts from diets that are rich in 
yellow beans. 
 The genetic basis to prostate cancer has not been 
clearly elucidated and the reason for this is that it is 
unlikely that there is one. There are links between 
familial breast cancer and prostate cancer, and 
overall the risk of developing prostate cancer is 
increased by just 1.3 - fold if you have an affected 
father with the condition and by 2.5 - fold if you 
have a brother affected. No consistent genetic 
defect has been described in prostate cancer. Most 
have a multiplicity of observed changes. These 
include a loss of heterozygosity around a number 
of chromosomes, the most common of which is a 
loss of genetic material on chromosome 10p. The 
tumour suppressor genes are infrequently mutated 
in prostate cancer  – for example, the retinoblast-
oma (RB) gene is mutated in just 5% of patients ’ 
tumours. No speciﬁ c cell surface molecular iden-
tity has been demonstrated to occur consistently 
in prostate cancer. Epidermal growth factor

of prostate - speciﬁ c antigen (PSA) screening and 
referred directly to oncology. In the UK between 
2% and 6% of men are screened. PSA levels are not 
necessarily diagnostic of prostate cancer. Where 
levels are raised above the normal range of 4   μ g/l to 
between 4 and 10   μ g/l, the chance of the patient 
having prostate cancer is approximately 25%. At 
levels over 10   μ g/l, the chance of diagnosing pros-
tate cancer increases to 40%. Levels of this antigen 
may be elevated in benign prostatic hypertrophy. 
PSA is a serine protease and acts like drain 
cleaner for the prostate, dissolving the prostatic 
coagulum. 
 In outpatients, a careful history should be taken, 
a full examination made, routine blood tests per-
formed and levels of acid phosphatase and PSA 
assessed. In addition, plain X - rays of the chest and 
pelvis should be performed and a transrectal ultra-
sound and bone scan booked (Figures  16.1  and 
 16.2 ; see Figure  1.8 ). 
receptor (EGFR) positivity is described in up to 40% 
of tumours. 
 Prostate cancer is strikingly hormone depend-
ent. This is because the growth of prostatic tumours 
is regulated by the androgen receptor, which is a 
member of the steroid superfamily of transcription 
factors, and the majority of treatments for prostate 
cancer have their effect through this receptor.  
 Presentation 
 Patients with prostate cancer commonly present 
with urinary frequency, a poor urine ﬂ ow or difﬁ -
culty with starting and stopping urination. Other 
associated symptoms on presentation include 
bone pain and general debility. Weight loss is rare. 
The patient with symptoms such as these should 
be referred by his GP to a urologist. 
 Patients with a potential diagnosis of prostate 
cancer are diagnosed in general practice as a result

hydronephrosis before and after the passage of a JJ stent to relive obstruction that was due to external compression by

 Staging and  g rading 
 From the clinical ﬁ ndings an assessment can be 
made of the degree of prostate enlargement. If the 
prostate is malignant, it is staged as in Table  16.1 . 
 The tumour grade can be described as well, mod-
erately or poorly differentiated. This is elaborated 
in the Gleason scoring system. The Gleason system 
scores prostatic tumours on a 1 – 10 scale, where 10 
is the most poorly differentiated. The combined 
Gleason grade describes the appearances of the two 
most common areas of prostatic malignancy. 
High - grade PIN, an acronym that coasts off the 
tongue with greater ease than prostatic intraepi-
thelial neoplasia, has been suggested as a pre -
 malignant condition leading to invasive cancer, as 
CIN leads to invasive cervical cancer. However, the 
evidence for this is very poor and surgeons should 
be discouraged from operative procedures in 
patients with this condition. 
 If the X - rays show no evidence of metastases, a 
bone scan should be carried out. Transrectal ultra-
sound has low speciﬁ city for deﬁ ning malignancy 
but a high speciﬁ city for describing the integrity of 
the prostatic capsule. In many centres, magnetic 
resonance is used as an adjunct to this procedure 
and has a reasonable speciﬁ city for describing pro-
static staging. A CT scan should be used to deﬁ ne 
lymph node spread. Transrectal ultrasonography 
should be combined with needle biopsy. As a 
standard, six cores are taken in general. Since diag-
nostic certainty is increased by carrying out more 
biopsies, 8 or even 12, needle cores are taken in 
many centres. Where the diagnosis is difﬁ cult and 

Chapter 16 Prostate cancer
140
PSA levels are high, saturation biopsies are carried 
out but this procedure, which may involve 20 or 
more biopsies, may lead to yet further difﬁ culties 
in deﬁ ning treatment if a focus of low - grade cancer 
is found.  
 Treatment 
 Treatment of  e arly - s tage  p rostate  c ancer 
 The treatment of prostate cancer depends upon 
clinical stage and is surrounded by controversy. 
Early - stage small bulk prostate cancer, that is T1 
and T2 disease, may be treated by observation, 
radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy if there is no 
evidence of spread. The options for treatment 
depend upon the patient ’ s overall state and prefer-
ence. Observation involves regular follow - up 
without treatment. Radiotherapy involves approx-
imately 6 weeks of attendance at hospital for pros-
tatic irradiation, which is given in an attempt to 
sterilize the tumour. Radiotherapy has morbidity. 
Acutely, it may be associated with symptoms of 
cystitis and proctitis; post - treatment it may 
produce impotence in up to 70% of patients. 
Radical prostatectomy involves major pelvic 
surgery, with removal of the prostate and associ-
ated lymph glands. Modern anaesthetic tech-
niques and surgical advances have meant that the 
morbidity is limited, but a degree of incontinence 
is reported in up to 25% of patients, and a degree of 
impotence, which is under - reported by surgeons, 
occurs in up to 90% of patients. It is agreed that 
morbidity has been reduced by the introduction of 
nerve - sparing techniques. There is an operative 
mortality of less than 1%. Surgeons delight in new

toys, and have been allowed to play with the Da 
Vinci robot; radical prostatectomy carried out by 
this procedure is said to lead to fewer problems 
with potency, and certainly less blood loss than 
with standard open surgery. 
 The reason the patient can be offered the pros-
pect of choice in determining what therapy he 
should have for early - stage disease is that observa-
tion, radiotherapy and radical surgery have all been 
shown to offer the patient with good or moderate 
histology tumours the same overall chance of long -
 term survival. For younger patients, with poor his-
tology, surgery offers a better survival chance than 
radiotherapy. The survival advantage is minimal. 
There has, however, been no randomized compari-
son of these three options involving signiﬁ cant 
patient numbers: hence this subject remains a 
matter for vociferous debate. A recent study of 
approximately 600 patients randomized to receive 
either watchful waiting or radiotherapy showed a 
better outlook for patients treated surgically. 
 In the early 1990s, investigations were initiated 
into the value of hormonal therapy given in addi-
tion to radiotherapy and surgery. No advantage to 
such  ‘ neoadjuvant ’  hormonal therapy has been 
found in those patients proceeding to radical 
surgery. A number of randomized studies have 
shown an advantage to neoadjuvant hormonal 
therapy in patients receiving radiotherapy. The 
majority of studies have found a decreased risk of 
local relapse with hormonal therapy, and two 
major trials reported improved survival. There is 
controversy as to the suitable duration of treat-
ment with adjuvant hormonal therapy. 
 Brachytherapy is a radiotherapy technique where 
the local intensity of radiation is increased by the 

Prostate cancer Chapter 16
141
implantation of radioactive seeds or wires. This 
technique has been applied to localized prostate 
cancer. Excellent results have been claimed, but 
not proven in any randomized trial. Recent 
publications have shown that the incidence of 
major side effects of brachytherapy is the same as 
for conventional radiation, and the efﬁ cacy of 
brachytherapy is no doubt similar to conventional 
radiation treatment. Brachytherapy has additional 
side effects to radiotherapy and these include a 12% 
instance of urethral stricture requiring surgical 
intervention. 
 Treatment of  l ocally  a dvanced or 
 m etastastic  p rostate  c ancer 
 When patients have locally advanced, that is T3 or 
T4, prostate cancer or metastatic disease (Figures 
 16.3  and  16.4 ), the treatment involves the use 
of hormonal therapy. Again, this area is one of 
considerable debate and controversy. Hormonal 
therapy for this condition was ﬁ rst described in 
the 1940s, when the disease was found to be 
dependent upon testosterone. For this reason, the 
ﬁ rst treatments offered in the 1940s were orchiec-
tomy, that is, removal of the testes, or oestrogen 
therapy.

tions and a more rapid rate of death in those 
patients who had delayed treatment. It would 
appear that this increased risk of complications 
and of death is conﬁ ned to patients with meta-
static cancer. In a review of the MRC trial in 2002, 
however, the principal author revised his conclu-
sions and considered it to be uncertain whether or 
not there is a survival advantage and a reduced 
complication rate to early treatment.  
 Prognosis 
 Prognosis for  s mall  b ulk  l ocalized 
 d isease 
 The outlook for small bulk localized disease 
depends upon grade. Observation, radiotherapy 
and surgery all lead to an equivalent survival of 
80% at 10 years for patients with well or moder-
ately differentiated tumours. Patients with poorly 
differentiated, high Gleason grade tumours have a 
worse outlook with observation and radiotherapy 
than with surgery. Only 15% of patients survive 10 
years, compared with 60 – 80% undergoing the 
latter treatment. It is argued that patient selection 
inﬂ uences this result, as ﬁ tter patients, who will 
invariably do better than less well patients, are 
selected for surgery.  
 Prognosis for  m etastatic and  l arge  b ulk 
 l ocalized  d isease 
 It has been shown in clinical trials that the addi-
tion of an anti - androgen to gonadotrophin - releas-
ing hormone agonist therapy leads to an 
improvement in survival rate. The median survival 
for patients with metastatic tumours treated with 
combination anti - androgen therapy is three years, 
as opposed to 2.5 years for patients treated with 
single - agent gonadotrophin - releasing hormone 
agonist or by orchiectomy. The prospects for sur-
vival for a patient with locally advanced disease 
without metastases are much better. The median 
survival of this group is 4.5 years. It is not known 
whether there is an advantage to combination 
gonadotrophin - releasing hormone agonist and 
anti - androgen therapy in this patient group.  
survival of patients treated or untreated was the 
same, but there was an excess mortality rate from 
cardiovascular deaths in the oestrogen - treated 
group. The reason for this is that oestrogens cause 
an increased coaguability of blood and increased 
blood volumes. 
 Because orchiectomy is barbaric and oestrogen 
therapy is associated with morbidity and mortal-
ity, medical treatments for this condition have 
been sought which are not so invasive and have no 
side effects. The most effective of these new treat-
ments, which has the least morbidity associated 
with its use, is a group of compounds called the 
gonadotrophin - releasing hormone agonists. These 
include leuprorelin acetate, goserelin acetate and 
buserelin. These are currently given subcutane-
ously by monthly or three - monthly injection. 
 Prostate cancer is very responsive to treatment, 
and 80% of patients improve subjectively. After a 
period of approximately one year, however, most 
patients with metastatic cancer on presentation 
have PSA evidence of relapse. In relapse, treatment 
is palliative and hinges upon the use of radiother-
apy and steroids. Blood transfusion is often neces-
sary. Chemotherapy is increasingly popular in 
patients with prostate cancer. The reason for this 
popularity is that patients respond to docetaxel 
chemotherapy. The median survival in patients 
starting treatment with docetaxel is 18.7 months, 
which provides a beneﬁ t of three months over con-
ventional therapy using mitoxantrone, a regimen 
which was introduced in the late 1980s.  
 Effects of  t reatment  d elay 
 Later analyses of the VACURG study showed that 
all the patients who were initially given placebos 
were eventually treated with hormonal therapies 
by their primary care physicians. As survival of 
both groups of patients,  ‘ treated ’  and  ‘ untreated ’ , 
was the same, the real conclusion of the study is 
that early, as compared with late, treatment offers 
the same prospect for survival. This important 
issue was investigated by the Medical Research

in the early 1990s that showed good symptom 
palliation from the use of mitoxantrone chemo-
therapy given with concurrent steroids. New treat-
ments with drugs such as docetaxel have shown 
promise and become a standard. Newer taxanes 
are in development and are effective as second line 
chemotherapy. Responses have been seen to anti -
 angiogenesis agents such as thalidomide and to 
steroids such as calcitriol. Dendritic cell therapy 
and vaccination approaches are also being 
trialled. 
 Recent work has shown major responses to 
vitamin D given orally to patients in dosages nor-
mally used as food supplementation. The reason 
for response to vitamin D is of great interest, but at 
present is not known. The oncogene SRC is upregu-
lated in prostatic cancer cell lines and, for this 
reason, trial work with a new drug, dasatinib, is 
under current investigation. The synthesis of 
androgenic steroids takes place most in the adrenal, 
where hydroxylase enzymes are responsible for the 
grand passage of cholesterol to androstenedione 
and 4 - hydroxyandrostenedione. Treatments such 
as with ketoconazole were aimed at blocking this 
pathway. However, whilst doing so, transiently, 
ketoconazole also causes signiﬁ cant side effects. 
Abiraterone, a new steroid hydroxylase inhibitor, 
has been found to be an effective treatment of 
prostate cancer in relapse. 
 As time goes by, we have become more aware 
of the side effects of hormonal therapy. The use 
of anti - androgen treatment is associated with 
osteoporosis, loss of muscle bulk, anaemia and 
neurological change, which includes both demen-
tia and Parkinsonism. At present, the consensus 
view is that osteoporosis is best managed with 
bisphosphonates. 
 Until recently, men with prostate cancer repre-
sented a rather passive but extremely brave group 
of individuals who accepted their fate. The last 
two decades have seen signiﬁ cant changes in 
the way that men deal with their cancers, and 
prostate cancer has now become, quite rightly, 
politicized with the cause championed to good 
effect. 
 
 
 Screening 
 There is controversy also regarding the value of 
screening. Two recent reports, one from the Insti-
tute of Cancer Research, and the other from the 
University of York Health Economics Unit, have 
published ﬁ ndings similar to each other. Both 
reports conclude that there is little value to screen-
ing because of the poor speciﬁ city of the diagnostic 
tools and the lack of a proven survival advantage to 
early treatment. 
 Recently two major trials results were published, 
one showing a survival advantage, the other, no 
advantage. Both trials involved many thousands 
of patients. The European study that showed a 
survival gain to screening, also demonstrated that 
one patient ’ s life was  ‘ saved ’ for every 48 cancers 
detected. 
 New  t reatment 
 When biopsies from patients with recurrent 
tumour are examined and compared with biopsies 
on presentation, it is striking that up to 50% will 
show androgen receptor mutations. This is in con-
tradiction to the situation in breast cancer, where 
hormone receptor ampliﬁ cation is the most com-
monly observed change. Over 700 mutations of 
the androgen receptor have been described, and 
these changes are a clue to the probable reason for 
the response to second - line hormonal therapy. 
The most commonly used second - line treatment is 
the withdrawal of anti - androgen therapy. Cessa-
tion of treatment with ﬂ utamide, for example, 
given in combination with an LHRH (luteinizing 
hormone - releasing hormone) agonist will lead to a 
response in up to 40% of patients. This response is 
transient and is thought to occur because the 
mutation has led the tumour to depend upon the 
anti - androgen as a growth factor. New treatments 
will thus have as their basis a molecular design that 
takes advantage of known androgen receptor 
changes. 
 Chemotherapy has become more important in 
the treatment of recurrent disease, following work

Testis  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 The treatment of testis cancer represents one of the 
major and wonderful triumphs of oncology. The 
application of modern treatments has led to a fall 
in death rates by 70% over the last 10 – 15 years, and 
in 2007 only 58 men died of this condition in the 
UK compared to over 2000 patients that were diag-
nosed. The major predisposing factor to the devel-
opment of testicular cancer is maldescent of the 
testes. There have been signiﬁ cant advances in the 
understanding of the molecular biology of adult 
male germ cell tumours. It is over 15 years since the 
original identiﬁ cation of the characteristic cytoge-
netic marker of adult male germ cell tumours: iso-
chromosome 12p. An extra copy of chromosome 
12p is present in 85% of all tumours, and in the 
remaining percentage there are tandem duplica-
tions embedded within other chromosomal mate-
rial. The cyclin D2 gene, which is concerned with 
the regulation of the cell cycle, is mapped to this 
area. This suggests that the aberrant expression of 
cyclin D2 leads to the dysregulation of the normal 
cell cycle and tumour development. This abnor-
mality is present in both seminoma and teratoma. 
Testicular tumours also express c - KIT, stem cell 
factor receptor and platelet - derived growth factor 
(PDGF)  α - receptor gene. Mutations in the KIT gene 
occur in 8% of all testicular germ cell tumours but 
are seen in 93% of patients with bilateral disease. 
These changes in the KIT gene appear to be speciﬁ c 
to seminoma. These molecular ﬁ ndings suggest 
possible therapeutic options.  
 Presentation 
 Media campaigns have led to public awareness of 
testicular cancer as a curable condition and of the 
importance of early diagnosis. Generally, patients 
noticing testicular masses present to their GPs and 
are referred immediately to urology outpatients. 
There remain, however, a number of alarming 
instances where GPs have treated patients with tes-
ticular tumours for epididymitis rather than refer-
ring them on. Patients with teratoma present 
during the second and third decades of their lives, 
generally with swelling of the testes and less fre-
quently with pain. Men with seminoma may 
present in their third to ﬁ fth decades. Men with 
testicular cancer may have gynaecomastia. This is 
due to the production of steroid hormones by the 
malignancy, and clearly not to  α - fetoprotein (AFP) 
or human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) 
synthesis. 
 In urology outpatients, after examination, the 
patient should proceed to initial staging by routine 
haematology, biochemistry and measurement of 
AFP and HCG. A chest X - ray should be requested 
and an ultrasound examination of the testes 
ordered. The ultrasound will show features sugges-

tive of testicular cancer, such as increased vascular-
ity accompanying a mass. There may be additional 
features of microlithiasis, suggesting that the 
tumour has developed from carcinoma  in situ . Car-
cinoma  in situ  is a bilateral condition with a 3% 
subsequent chance of development of a second tes-
ticular tumour. 
 Following these investigations, arrangements 
should be made for the patient to proceed to 
orchiectomy. This is performed through a groin 
rather than a scrotal incision, which would lead to 
an increased risk of the scrotal spread of testicular 
cancer, particularly in cases where there are embry-
onal elements to the tumour. The testis is removed 
by the surgeon, cut in half, examined and sent for 
pathological examination (Figure  17.1 ). 
 Staging and  g rading 
 There are four main types of testicular tumour: 
seminoma, teratoma, lymphoma and small cell. 
Teratoma constitutes approximately 75% of all tes-
ticular malignancies and appears cystic when 
examined by the naked eye. Pure seminoma con-
stitutes 20% of tumours and is uniform in appear-
ance. Approximately 5% of all testicular tumours 
are lymphoma, the appearance of which is gener-
ally uniform but with some areas of necrosis. Less 
than 1% of tumours are of small cell origin. These 
tumours have no speciﬁ c macroscopic features. 
 Microscopically, teratomas constitute a variety 
of different elements which may include cartilage, 
muscle, bone and virtually any other tissue. Sub-
types of teratoma are described, and they are called 
undifferentiated, differentiated or choriocarci-
noma. Seminoma consists of uniform and large 
cells with darkly standing nuclei. 
 Having made a histological diagnosis, treatment 
is initiated and depends upon the stage to which 
the tumour has advanced. The following stages are 
described and determined by CT imaging of the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis: 
  ●    Stage I: tumour conﬁ ned to testes  
  ●    Stage II: tumour spread to abdominal lymph 
nodes 
  ●    Stage III: tumour spread to lymph nodes above 
the diaphragm  
  ●    Stage IV: tumour invading organs other than 
lymph nodes such as liver or lung.  
 The disease is further sub - staged according to the 
size of the metastatic deposits and the number of 
pulmonary metastases. In the US, retroperitoneal 
lymph node dissection is undertaken to stage tes-
ticular cancer, although this practice is disappear-
ing. In our view, node dissection is not indicated as 
a routine staging procedure because of the major 
morbidity of the operation and also because of the 
side effects, which include retrograde ejaculation. 
Node dissection for staging purposes is not part of 
medical practice in the UK, which relies on imaging. 
 Retrograde ejaculation is the ejaculation of 
sperm backwards into the bladder rather than for-
wards into the urethra. This phenomenon does not 
necessarily mean that the patient is functionally 
sterile, because sperm can be collected and artiﬁ -
cial insemination techniques employed to success-
fully fertilize the patient ’ s partner. In modern 
times, such IVF programmes require aspiration of 
sperm from the testes or testicular biopsy with 
sperm retrieval if collection of urine post - ejacula-
tion with sperm retrieval is unsuccessful.  
 Treatment 
 Treatment of  S tage  I  t esticular  c ancer 
 The tumour stage of testicular cancer deﬁ nes its 
treatment. If the tumour is localized to the testis, 
two actions are available to the clinician. The ﬁ rst 
activity for both seminoma and teratoma is obser-
vation without further therapy. If this policy is fol-
lowed in the absence of poor prognosis pathology 
features, then the likelihood of any further treat-
ment being required is 13% for testicular teratoma 
and 17% for seminoma. It should be noted that 
almost all patients who develop progressive disease 
during the period of observation without treat-
ment are salvageable by chemotherapy. 
 In the UK, the majority of urologists refer 
patients with stage I seminoma for radiotherapy, 
following which the prognosis is excellent, with 
virtually no chance of relapse. The option of two 
courses of single - agent carboplatin might also 
be offered. A randomized trial has shown that

chemotherapy with carboplatin is as effective as 
radiation therapy and without the morbidity, two 
infusions being given at four - weekly intervals in 
contrast to three weeks of daily radiation therapy. 
Patients with stage I teratoma are generally referred 
for adjuvant chemotherapy using BEP (bleomycin, 
etoposide and cisplatin) chemotherapy: two to 
four courses are given. Treatment in certain cir-
cumstances might be modiﬁ ed, dropping bleomy-
cin from the treatment programme to reduce the 
risk of lung damage.  
 Treatment of  s tage  II   t esticular  c ancer 
 For stage IIa seminoma, that is, with a nodal mass 
of less than 2   cm in diameter as deﬁ ned by CT scan-
ning, many clinicians in the UK advise treatment 
with radiotherapy. A consensus of opinion is now 
emerging, which follows the view that two courses 
of cytotoxic chemotherapy are equally as effective 
as radiation treatment in the control of this stage 
of disease. For stage IIb seminoma, that is, for 
patients with a disease mass of less than 5   cm, some 
clinicians, particularly radiotherapists, still treat 
with radiotherapy, but this is not generally advised 
in view of the side effects of large ﬁ eld radiother-
apy. Chemotherapy should be given using either 
single - agent or combination therapy. 
 For all patients with greater than stage IIb 
disease, whether it is seminoma or teratoma, cyto-
toxic chemotherapy is given. Before the advent of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy for teratoma, the disease 
was invariably fatal. The development of effective 
chemotherapy programmes has bought about a 
revolution in the management of patients with 
malignancy, and now virtually all patients are 
cured by treatment.  
 Treatment of  a dvanced  t esticular  c ancer 
 Treatment with cytotoxic agents was originally 
introduced into medical practice by Li in the early 
1960s. As a result, approximately 8% of patients 
with advanced disease were cured, using a combi-
nation of agents that included actinomycin and 
chlorambucil. In the early 1970s, Samuels treated 
patients with vinblastine and bleomycin and pro-
duced remissions in approximately 50% of men 
treated. This treatment was of considerable toxic-
ity because of the large dosages of vinblastine and 
bleomycin used and the relative lack of support 
programmes for patients with neutropenic sepsis 
and thrombocytopenia, which occur as a result of 
the use of these agents. In 1976, Einhorn intro-
duced the BVP (bleomycin, vinblastine and cisplat-
inum) programme for the treatment of malignant 
testicular tumours. This regimen was enormously 
successful, and 70% of patients with advanced 
disease were cured. By substituting etoposide for 
vinblastine, less toxicity resulted with equivalent 
effect. 
 Over the last decade, there have been further 
reﬁ nements in the way that treatment has been 
given. Drug treatment that initially required six 
courses of ﬁ ve - day treatments has now been 
reduced to four courses of three - day treatments. 
Substitution of drugs within this programme to 
produce the modern three - day JEB (bleomycin, 
etoposide and carboplatin) programme has meant 
that toxicity has been limited, and the expectation 
is that 95% of patients with good - prognosis tumour 
are cured with this regimen, and 48% of patients 
with poor - prognosis disease are cured with BEP 
chemotherapy. Extraordinarily, there has been 
further change in the collective view with regard to 
chemotherapy for testicular cancer, and many 
oncologists have reverted back to the original ﬁ ve -
 day BEP programme. This is based upon analyses of 
huge numbers of patients and the realization of the 
superiority of this standard programme.  
 Treatment of  r esidual  t umour  m asses 
 At the end of treatment, one problem may be that 
of a persistent mass. By this we mean a residual 
tumour at the site of the original metastatic disease. 
The approach to this problem is to proceed to 
surgery. Surgery may be very extensive and involve 
both thoracotomy and laparotomy. At surgery, the 
residual mass of tumour is excised as completely as 
possible, and this may require dacron grafting of 
major vessels or removal of a kidney in order to 
take away the tumour completely. This operative 
procedure is extremely intricate. Histological 

Chapter 17 Testis cancer
148
examination of the excised mass shows that in one -
 third of cases there is necrotic tumour, in one - third 
of cases there is differentiated teratoma and in one -
 third of cases there is undifferentiated cancer. If 
necrotic tumour is found, no further action is 
taken. If undifferentiated tumour is found, further 
chemotherapy is given and 30 – 40% of patients 
will be cured by a combination of chemotherapy 
and surgery. In those patients who have residual 
differentiated tumour, it is important to remove 
the residual mass of the disease because over a ﬁ ve -
 year period approximately 50% of differentiated 
tumours undergo further malignant change, trans-
forming to undifferentiated malignancy. 
 Unfortunately, a signiﬁ cant number of patients 
still have progressive or unresponsive tumours, 
and for these patients there is still a possibility of 
cure, which is in the range of 20 – 40%. Treatment 
programmes such as VIP (vinblastine, iphospha-
mide and cisplatin) or high - dose therapy with 
stem cell rescue are used to treat such patients.  
 Monitoring  t reatment 
 The effects of treatment are very closely monitored 
by measuring the serum levels of AFP, PLAP and 
HCG. These are hormones secreted by teratoma 
and seminoma. If the tumour is being treated effec-
tively, then the levels of these hormones in the 
blood will decay over a known period: 3 – 5 days for 
AFP and approximately 12 – 36 hours for HCG.  
 Side  e ffects of  t reatment 
 There are speciﬁ c toxicities that relate to treat-
ment. Cisplatin will cause renal damage, deafness 
and a peripheral neuropathy, which may manifest 
as numbness in the ﬁ ngers or toes or complete loss 
of motor and sensory function in the limbs. Bleo-
mycin unfortunately causes pulmonary toxicity, 
that is, an irreversible and progressive loss of lung 
function, which is fatal in approximately 2% of 
patients treated (see Figure 3.13). Testicular cancer 
and the drug regimen that is used generally causes 
sterility; by this we mean loss of functional sper-
matogenesis. In 80% of patients, however, there is 
recovery of spermatogenesis, which generally 
occurs at 18 months from the completion of 
treatment. 
 Prognosis 
 The treatment of teratoma and seminoma is highly 
complex and requires patient management in 
centres of excellence, where the delivery of chemo-
therapy and the maintenance of patients during 
neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes can 
be successfully achieved. In the best centres, 95% 
of patients with good - prognosis tumours are cured, 
which is without doubt a signiﬁ cant advance in 
medical science, as young men with this malignant 
tumour can be returned to an active life within the 
community after treatment. 
 Prognostic indices have been described in detail 
by many authors. One of the more commonly used 
is described by the International Germ Cell Cancer 
Collaborative Group. Patients with non - seminoma 
are classiﬁ ed as having good - prognosis disease 
with a ﬁ ve - year survival of 92 – 95%, intermediate -
 prognosis tumours with a 72 – 80% ﬁ ve - year sur-
vival and poor - prognosis tumours with a 48% 
ﬁ ve - year survival. Patients with pure seminoma are 
described as having either good - or intermediate -
 prognosis disease. The classiﬁ cation into these cat-
egories is based on the presence or absence of 
non - nodal visceral metastases and serum levels of 
tumour markers. The inﬂ uence of delay on prog-
nosis is variably reported. Some authors link delay 
in excess of one year to a good prognosis, although 
this is described as being associated with a poor 
prognosis by other authors.  
 New  t reatment 
 Testicular cancer remains an exclusively chemo-
sensitive disease even at progression, and for this 
reason almost every new drug that has been devel-
oped for oncology has been applied to this condi-
tion. Amongst this new group of chemotherapy 
agents, the taxanes and gemcitabine have shown 
promise. Imatinib (Glivec), a c - KIT antagonist, has 
been applied to the treatment of testicular cancer. 
There are case reports of activity but no major trial 
evidence for a response to imatinib.

Gynaecological  c ancers 
 In 1951, George and Margaret Gey and Mary 
Kubicek developed HeLa, the ﬁ rst human cancer 
continuous cell line. It proliferates in tissue culture 
and has been the basis of a great deal of research 
into cancer biology and drug development. The 
sample originated from the cervical cancer of a 
young black woman, Henrietta Lacks of Baltimore. 
Many thousands of tons of HeLa cells are now 
found in the incubators and freezers of laboratories 
around the world. Unfortunately the patient died 
less than a year after the cell line was established, 
and her family are said to be shocked by the devel-
opment and proliferation of the cell line, which 
was obtained presumably without consent at the 
time. Gynaecological tumours are not restricted to 
humans; female Asian elephants and rhinos are 
particularly susceptible to uterine ﬁ bromata. 
 Gynaecological cancers range from gestational 
trophoblastic tumours, which are associated with 
probably the highest survival of any malignant 
tumour, to ovarian cancers where fewer than a 
third of women will survive ﬁ ve years. The registra-
tion and prognosis data for the commoner tumours 
are shown in Table  18.1 . 
 Gynaecological cancers include gestational tro-
phoblastic disease, cervical cancer, endometrial 
cancer and ovarian cancer and will be discussed in 
more detail in the following four chapters.

Gestational  t rophoblastic  d isease 
 Gestational trophoblastic tumours originate from 
placental tissues and are among the few human 
cancers that can be cured, even in the presence of 
widespread metastasis. The term gestational tro-
phoblastic disease (GTD) covers hydatidiform 
molar pregnancies, invasive moles, choriocarcino-
mas and placental site trophoblastic tumours. Half 
of the women with choriocarcinoma develop GTD 
after a molar pregnancy; the remainder have previ-
ously had non - molar gestations. Since GTD is rela-
tively rare but can be treated with very high cure 
rates, all patients should be referred to specialist 
national units.  
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 The incidence of GTD varies geographically, with 
the highest rates reported from Asia, and the risk 
rises with maternal age and a history of prior molar 
pregnancy. In the UK, hydatidiform moles account 
for one in 1000 pregnancies and about 10% of 
these will progress to persistent trophoblastic 
disease requiring chemotherapy. Cytogenetic and 
molecular analysis of hydatidiform moles has pro-
vided a clue as to their origin (Figure  19.1 ). The 
majority of complete moles have a 46XX karyo-
type, with both X - chromosomes of paternal origin 
(androgenetic). They are believed to originate from 
fertilization of an empty ovum by a haploid sperm 
that then underwent duplication. In contrast, 
partial moles contain both maternal and paternal 
DNA and are typically triploid 69XXY, presumably 
as a result of fertilization of a single ovum by two 
sperm. It is thought that this developmental 
abnormality affecting uniparental diploid cells (in 
this case androgenetic, 46XX) is due to genomic 
imprinting. The expression of some genes is deter-
mined by their parental origin  – whether the allele 
was inherited from the mother or father  – and this 
persists through multiple rounds of DNA ampliﬁ -
cation. This parent - of - origin effect is known as 
genomic imprinting and only affects a minority of 
genes. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phe-
nomenon that does not rely on changes to the 
DNA base sequence but rather on methylation of 
individual bases. One example of imprinting in 
humans is the insulin - like growth factor 2 (IGF2) 
gene. Only the paternal copy of IGF2 is expressed 
in foetal life; the maternal gene is said to be 
 ‘ imprinted ’ . The relaxation of this maternal 
imprinting 
results 
in 
congenital 
Beckwith – 
Weidemann syndrome: gigantism, macroglossia, 
exophthalmos, neonatal hypoglycaemia and pre-
disposition to childhood cancers, including 
Wilms ’  tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma and adrenal 
tumours. Imprinting is also responsible for paired 
congenital syndromes on chromosome 15q11. 
This region is differently imprinted in maternal

and paternal chromosomes, and both imprintings 
are needed for normal development. In a normal 
individual, the maternal allele is methylated, while 
the paternal allele is unmethylated. Some individ-
uals fail to inherit a properly imprinted 15q11 
from one parent, either due to deletion of the 
15q11 region from that parent ’ s chromosome 15 
or rarely due to uniparental disomy (in which both 
copies have been inherited from the one parent). 
If neither copy of 15q11 has paternal imprinting, 
the result is Prader – Willi syndrome (characterized 
by hypotonia, obesity and hypogonadism). If 
neither copy has maternal imprinting, the result is 
the Angelman syndrome (characterized by epi-
lepsy, tremors and a perpetually smiling facial 
expression). 
 Presentation 
 Women with trophoblastic disease usually present 
with antepartum haemorrhage, passing grape - like 
particles during early pregnancy, anaemia and 
hyperemesis. Hyperthyroidism may occur because 
human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) acts as a 
weak thyroid - stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor 
agonist, due to homology between  β - subunits of 
HCG and TSH, which has been called molecular 
mimicry. Metastases are typically haemorrhagic. 
The most frequent sites are the lungs and brain, 
where they mimic pulmonary thromboembolic 
disease and subarachnoid haemorrhage. It is there-
fore always worthwhile performing a pregnancy 
test in women with these presentations, since 

Chapter 19 Gestational trophoblastic disease
152
normal serum or urine HCG levels exclude this 
diagnosis. Choriocarcinoma, although rare, is an 
important diagnosis, as the tumour is exquisitely 
sensitive to chemotherapy and over 95% of women 
with this diagnosis can be cured. The deﬁ nitive 
diagnostic investigations are a quantitative serum 
HCG assay and pelvic ultrasonography with colour 
Doppler ﬂ ow measurement. Most cases of chorio-
carcinoma follow a hydatidiform molar preg-
nancy, although it may also occur after either 
spontaneous abortion or normal - term pregnancy. 
If choriocarcinoma follows a molar pregnancy, 
molecular analysis reveals that the tumour DNA is 
entirely androgenetic, being derived from the 
father, with the loss of all maternal alleles. In con-
trast, post - term choriocarcinoma has a biparental 
genotype. Nonetheless, all cases of choriocarci-
noma include paternal DNA sequences that are 
absent from the patient ’ s genome and may be used 
to conﬁ rm the diagnosis genetically if necessary.  
 Treatment 
 Gestational trophoblastic disease was the ﬁ rst 
cancer to be cured by chemotherapy alone in the 
early 1960s. A scoring scheme has been devised 
that determines the risk of developing drug resist-
ance to methotrexate, and women at low risk can 
be successfully treated with single - agent meth-
otrexate, with very high success rates and very few 
long - term sequelae. Women at higher risk of resist-
ance require combination chemotherapy sched-
ules, which, although still highly successful, run a 
small risk of second malignancy. Serum HCG acts 
as the ideal tumour marker in this disease. HCG 
can be used to screen women following a molar 
pregnancy, to identify persistent trophoblastic 
disease that requires chemotherapy. Serum HCG 
can be used as a diagnostic investigation and in 
some circumstances obviates the need for a tissue 
diagnosis. Serum HCG levels form part of the prog-
nostic scoring index and can be used to follow 
treatment: to determine the effectiveness of treat-
ment and to detect remission or chemoresistance. 
Finally, HCG can be used in follow - up to identify 
relapse. 
 Prognosis 
 The prognosis of gestational trophoblastic tumours 
is excellent, with the rare exceptions of placental 
site histological subtype. The cure rates exceed 
95%, and much of the current focus of clinical 
research is aimed at minimizing the long - term side 
effects of any treatment rather than attempts to 
increase the cure rates.

Cervical  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Cancer of the cervix is thought to affect over one -
 third of a million women worldwide and repre-
sents 10% of all female cancers. Eighty percent of 
all cases of cervical cancer occur in the developing 
world. The incidence in the UK, as in many 
developed countries, is decreasing. In 2007, 2800 
women were diagnosed and 941 women died of 
cervical cancer in the UK. In the UK, cervical cancer 
is the seventh most common of all female cancers, 
representing 2.5% of all cancer cases. 
 Invasive cervical cancer is believed to be the 
ﬁ nal stage in a continuum that starts with cervical 
infection by high - risk genotypes of human papil-
lomavirus (HPV) and progresses via cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to invasive cancer. 
CIN is a cytological diagnosis and is divided into 
three grades (CIN1 – 3). The histological equivalent 
of CIN is the squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), 
which is divided into low - grade SIL (LGSIL) that is 
similar to CIN1, and high - grade SIL (HGSIL) analo-
gous to CIN2 and CIN3. 
 The decline in incidence of cervical cancer is 
associated with the development of the screening 
programmes, which began in 1964. Screening is 
based upon cervical smear assessment, and the 
current recommendation is for three - yearly screen-
ing. Four and a half million women are screened 
annually in the UK, and there has been a decline of 
40% in the age - speciﬁ c incidence over the last 20 
years. Mortality has also decreased, falling from 
11.2 deaths per 100   000 women in 1950 to 2.4 in 
2007. Screening is currently a subjective process, 
which, although well regulated, may be subject to 
human error. The accuracy of screening is likely to 
improve with the integration of molecular biologi-
cal approaches to the process such as screening for 
the HPV genome. 
 Cervical cancer is associated with smoking, pro-
miscuity, low socioeconomic status, the use of oral 
contraceptives, genital warts, herpes simplex virus 
2 infection and, most particularly, infection with 
HPV 16 and 18. The average age of women with 
cervical cancer ranges from 35 to 44 years.  
 Presentation 
 Women with cervical cancer may present to their 
doctors with inter - menstrual bleeding, post - coital 
bleeding or painful intercourse. There may fre-
quently be a vaginal discharge that can be bloody 
or offensive or symptoms suggestive of a urinary 
infection such as urinary frequency or urgency. 
When the cancer has spread, common symptoms 
include back pain due to enlarged abdominal 
lymph nodes or referred pain in the legs due to 
involvement of the nerve plexuses of the pelvis. 
These symptoms may be accompanied by loss of

weight. The examination should include an assess-
ment of the patient ’ s general state of health 
together with palpation of the abdomen and a 
vaginal assessment. This may conﬁ rm the presence 
of a discharge and reveal a cervical mass (Figure 
 20.1 ). 
 Outpatient diagnosis 
 The GP should refer the patient to a gynaecologist 
who will repeat the examination, take smears from 
the cervix for cytological examination and then 
organize admission for examination under anaes-
thesia and cervical biopsy. Colposcopy should be 
performed as an outpatient procedure prior to 
admission. This technique allows direct visualiza-
tion of the cervix with properly directed biopsies. 
After these assessments have been performed and a 
histological diagnosis has been obtained, staging 
investigations should be organized. These should 
include a full blood count, proﬁ le, chest X - ray and 
a CT or magnetic resonance scan of the abdomen 
and pelvis.  
 Staging and grading 
 Carcinoma of the cervix is staged as a result of 
these ﬁ ndings as follows: 
  ●    Stage 0: carcinoma  in situ . Intraepithelial carci-
noma grades 1 – 3 
  ●    Stage 1A: microscopic disease conﬁ ned to the 
cervix 
  ●    Stage 1B: disease conﬁ ned to the cervix and 
greater than stage 1A  
  ●    Stage 2A: carcinoma extending beyond the 
cervix without parametrial involvement  
  ●    Stage 2B: parametrial involvement  
  ●    Stage 3A: extension to the pelvic side wall  
  ●    Stage 3B: extension to the pelvic wall with 
hydronephrosis or a non - functioning kidney  
  ●    Stage 4A: extension beyond the true pelvis to 
adjacent organs  
  ●    Stage 4B: spread to distant organs.  
 Sixty - six percent of cervical cancers are squa-
mous cell tumours. These are graded as G1, G2 or 
G3 tumours, according to their microscopic 
appearance: G1 tumours are well differentiated, G2 
tumours moderately and G3 tumours poorly dif-
ferentiated. Fifteen percent are adenocarcinomas, 
and these are also graded G1 – 3. Other rarer 
tumours include small cell cancers and lympho-
mas. Carcinomas  in situ  are graded I – III and abbre-
viated to CIN or CGIN, depending on whether 
squamous or adenocarcinoma cells are present.  
 Treatment 
 The treatment of cervical cancer depends upon the 
stage of disease. Stage 0 carcinoma of the cervix 
should be treated by cone biopsy or by surgical 
 Figure 20.1   Cervical cancer with extensive, locally inﬁ ltrating tumour. This CT scan of a 65 - year - old woman who had never 
had a cervical smear shows a bulky cervix with loss of the normal fat plane that separates it from the bladder. There is exten-
sion of the invasive cervical cancer into the posterolateral bladder wall anteriorly and into the pelvic fat laterally. There is 
also an enlarged left external iliac lymph node. The staging was therefore T4N1M0 (IVA).

excision. Stage 1A disease can sometimes be 
managed by cone biopsy or local excision but 
usually by hysterectomy. Stage 1B and 2A cervical 
cancer is usually treated by either radical hysterec-
tomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy or by pelvic 
irradiation. Both methods are equally effective in 
the long - term control of the disease. Stage 2B and 
3 carcinoma of the cervix should be treated by 
pelvic radiotherapy and stage 4 carcinoma with 
chemotherapy. 
 Patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy with 
curative intent are frequently prescribed additional 
concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy. Typically, 
patients will be treated with weekly courses of sin-
gle - agent cisplatin. Chemoradiation has been sub-
jected to a number of randomized trials, and it has 
been concluded that concomitant chemoradiation 
appears to improve overall survival and progres-
sion - free survival in locally advanced cervical 
cancer. Progressive or metastatic cervical carci-
noma is treated with combination chemotherapy 
usually using a PMB regimen that contains cispla-
tin, methotrexate and bleomycin.  
 Carcinoma  in  s itu 
 As a result of treatment, virtually 100% of patients 
with CIN disease are cured. Approximately 0.05 –
 0.3% of treated women subsequently develop 
invasive carcinoma. If CIN is left untreated, then 
over a 30 - year follow - up period, 10 – 40% of patients 
will develop invasive cancer. The evidence for this 
is based on data from a single study carried out in 
New Zealand of untreated patients with CIN, by a 
clinician who apparently was convinced that CIN 
did not progress.  
 Prognosis 
 Approximately 5% of patients treated for stage 1A 
carcinoma of the cervix will progress to develop 
advanced disease. 65 to 85% of all patients with 
stage 1B and 2A carcinoma of the cervix survive 
ﬁ ve years after treatment by a radical hysterectomy 
or radiation. The chance for a cure is smaller in 
stage 2B disease, and the expectation is that 
approximately 50 – 65% survive with radiotherapy 
alone. About 40 – 60% of patients with stage 3A 
disease, and 25 – 45% of patients with stage 3B 
disease, survive ﬁ ve years and are treated with radi-
otherapy and frequently with chemotherapy. 
 These statistics are relevant to patients with 
squamous cancers or adenocarcinomas. Variant 
histologies, such as small cell carcinomas, are asso-
ciated with a poor prognosis, with the expectation 
that, even at an early stage, survival is less than 5% 
at 5 years. 
 Patients with stage 4 cervical cancer do very 
poorly. In this situation, it is very unlikely that a 
cure will be achieved. Chemotherapy is the treat-
ment of ﬁ rst choice. A number of agents have activ-
ity in the order of 15% and their combination is 
accompanied by some synergy of effect. The most 
commonly applied treatment programme involves 
the combination of cisplatin, methotrexate and 
bleomycin. About 30 – 40% of patients will respond 
to treatment, but durable cures are rare. Chemo-
therapy is associated with toxicity, and this 
includes nausea and vomiting, hair loss, infections 
and kidney failure. Because of the toxicities of 
treatment, an alternative approach is to palliate 
symptoms with pain killers alone.  
 Terminal  c are 
 In the terminal phases of illness, patients with cer-
vical cancer may have a number of problems that 
prove difﬁ cult to manage. These include ﬁ stulae 
from the vagina to bladder and from the rectum to 
vagina or bladder, as a result of local progression of 
the tumour. Obstruction of kidney function may 
occur as a result of blockage of the ureters, either by 
enlarged lymph nodes or by tumour from the 
cervix growing within the pelvis, blocking the 
ureters. These situations can be treated surgically, 
in which case a colostomy or ileostomy may be 
formed, relieving bowel or ureteric obstruction, or 
radiologically by the passage of a stent to reverse 
obstructive damage to the kidneys.  
 New  t reatment 
 We hope that with the successful introduction of 
HPV vaccination and the institution of public 

Chapter 20 Cervical cancer
156
health measures to eliminate smoking, there will 
be no need for treatment of cervical cancer in the 
future. In the developing world this utopian view 
may be a little optimistic. A number of vaccines 
have become available for the prevention of cervi-
cal cancer. It is estimated that there will be a signiﬁ -
cant reduction in cervical cancer rates, but only 
when 90% of all girls aged 11 – 12 years have been 
vaccinated for many years. New quadrivalent vac-
cines given to women who are seropositive for HPV 
lead to major increases in antibodies directed 
against HPV 16 or 18, and it may be that this initia-
tive prevents the development of invasive cervical 
cancer in HPV seropositive patients.

 Chapter 21 
Endometrial  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 The key to endometrial function lies in the effects 
of 
oestrogen 
and 
progesterone 
on 
the 
endometrium, enabling it to progress through the 
normal menstrual cycle and to prepare for embryo 
implantation. Oestrogen stimulates proliferation 
in the glands and stroma. Progesterone inhibits 
mitotic activity and stimulates secretion in the 
glands and decidualization of the stroma, where 
the cells acquire more cytoplasm. It is therefore 
perhaps not surprising that unopposed oestrogens 
will promote continuous mitotic activity, leading 
to cancers. Endometrial cancer is associated with 
elevated endogenous levels of free oestrogens due 
to falls in sex hormone - binding globulin or to 
increased aromatization and sulphation of andro-
gens 
(androstenedione 
to 
oestrone). 
Thus, 
endometrial cancer is ten times more common in 
obese women due to peripheral conversion of 
androstenedione to oestrone by extraglandular 
aromatization in adipose tissue. Exogenous oestro-
gens also increase the risk of endometrial cancer. 
The use of unopposed oestrogens carries a 4 – 8 - fold 
relative risk, especially in hormone replacement 
therapy, which is abrogated almost completely by 
combining progesterone with oestrogen. A great 
deal of attention has been paid to the induction of 
endometrial cancer by tamoxifen and has led to 
the development of new selective oestrogen recep-
tor modulators (SERMs), including raloxifene. 
Although the beneﬁ t of tamoxifen therapy for 
breast cancer outweighs the potential increase in 
endometrial cancer, the relative risk is six to seven -
 fold. Screening for endometrial cancer in women 
with breast cancer taking tamoxifen has no proven 
beneﬁ t, but abnormal bleeding should prompt 
rapid investigation. Endometrial cancer is a feature 
of hereditary Lynch type II non - polyposis colon 
cancer. 
 Endometrial cancer is the ﬁ fth most common 
cancer in women in England and Wales (see Table 
 18.1 ). It rarely develops before the menopause, 
and, since it causes abnormal vaginal bleeding, it 
can usually be diagnosed at an early stage.  
 Presentation 
 These tumours present in postmenopausal women 
as uterine bleeding. Postmenopausal bleeding is 
always abnormal and requires prompt investiga-
tion. Hysteroscopy, which allows visual inspection 
of the uterine lining, is often used for diagnosis 
and can detect abnormalities in 95 – 100% of cases. 
The probability of endometrial cancer among 
women with postmenopausal bleeding who do not 
use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is 10%. If

the transvaginal ultrasound scan is normal, this 
probability falls to 1%, so ultrasound allows the 
majority of women to be quickly reassured. Outpa-
tient endometrial biopsy methods are now as accu-
rate as dilatation and curettage (D & C), which 
requires a general anaesthetic.  
 Treatment and  p rognosis 
 The optimum treatment for endometrial cancer 
depends on the stage and grade of the disease and 
on the risk of tumour in lymph nodes. When the 
cancer is conﬁ ned to the inner third of the myo-
metrium, the lymph nodes are likely to be clear 
and total hysterectomy is usually sufﬁ cient as 
treatment. This applies to about 90% of women 
with endometrial cancer, and their 5 - year survival 
exceeds 70%. In women with tumour that extends 
beyond the inner half of the myometrium or with 
regional lymph node involvement, adjuvant pelvic 
radiotherapy is widely used. This has been shown 
to reduce the rate of local recurrence but may have 
long - term sequelae, including lymphoedema. 
 It would appear that endometrial cancer can be 
divided into two different classes of disease, with 
contrasting outlook. One group of endometrial 
cancer patients have tumours that are strongly 
hormone receptor positive and have an excellent 
prognosis, whilst a second variant develops in the 
elderly, has atypical histology, is poorly responsive 
to hormonal therapy and has a poor outlook. 
Endometrial cancer of typical histology expresses 
receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and gonado-
trophin - releasing hormone. The expression of 
these receptors leads to opportunities for hormo-
nal treatment. 
 Patients with endometrial cancer do respond to 
chemotherapy and the current standard is for the 
use of combination therapy with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel, and this is of particular use in the atypi-
cal histology patient. Nevertheless, hormonal 
therapy is of use in the treatment of endometrial 
carcinoma, and excellent palliation is seen with 
treatments such as progestogens.  
 New  t reatment 
 There appears to be little beneﬁ t from the use of 
new chemotherapy agents for patients with recur-
rent disease who have previously received chemo-
therapy. Response rates to investigational drugs, 
such as the exotically named ixabepilone, are in 
the order of 10%. In the situation of recurrent 
disease, chemotherapy should only be adminis-
tered with palliative intent. As in so many tumour 
groups, there is interest in the possibility of an 
effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Uterine carci-
nomas stain positively for epidermal growth factor 
receptor in up to 60% of cases, suggesting that this 
receptor could be targeted for treatment. The 
tumour suppressor gene, PTEN, and the oncogene, 
PIK3CA, are frequently mutated in endometrial 
carcinoma, suggesting again a target for therapy. 
The steroid sulphatase enzyme is involved in the 
hydrolysis of oestrone sulphate and dehydroepian-
drosterone sulphate to oestrone and dehydroepi-
androsterone, and this is an important step in the 
formation of oestrodial. Inhibitors of the steroid 
sulphatase enzyme have been developed and 
shown to be of value in breast cancer. It is likely 
that these inhibitors would also have potential 
activity in endometrial cancer.

Ovarian  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Carcinoma of the ovary is a common tumour 
affecting nearly 6600 women annually and leading 
to the death of 4300 women each year in the UK. 
Ovarian cancer is the fourth most frequent cause of 
cancer death in women. The average age at which 
the disease occurs is approximately 65 years. By far 
the most common pathological subtype of ovarian 
cancer is epithelial, and this chapter concentrates 
virtually exclusively upon ovarian epithelial malig-
nancy. There is a familial association between 
breast and ovarian cancer. This relates to germline 
mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which 
are associated with a risk approaching 60% of 
developing ovarian cancer. In an analysis of 
benign, borderline and malignant ovarian cancers, 
somatic loss of heterozygosity for BRCA1 was dem-
onstrated in none of the benign, in 15% of the bor-
derline and in 66% of the malignant cancers. There 
is controversy as to other associated risk factors of 
the development of ovarian cancer. For example, 
long - term oestrogen replacement therapy may be 
associated with the development of these tumours, 
and in one prospective study of over 31   000 post-
menopausal women, the increased risk of the 
development of ovarian cancer was 1.7 - fold. As in 
many other tumours HER - 2 overexpression is sig-
niﬁ cantly associated with poorer survival pros-
pects. HER - 2 expression occurs in a minority of 
tumours; that is, in approximately 20% of patients. 
 Because ovarian cancer patients generally 
present with late - stage tumours, attempts have 
been made to reduce this risk by population screen-
ing. One of the largest published studies involved 
the prospective screening of nearly 4000 women 
by annual ultrasound examination and measure-
ment of the serum tumour marker CA - 125. This led 
to the identiﬁ cation of approximately 350 women 
with abnormalities, and 330 of these proceeded to 
laparotomy. In this group, there were 30 patients 
with ovarian tumours, the majority of which were 
at an advanced stage; so it seems that the value of 
screening using current technologies is low. Future 
screening programmes may beneﬁ t from a more 
reﬁ ned approach. One technique involves the use 
of surface - enhanced laser absorption and ioniza-
tion protein mass spectra. This rather complicated 
terminology describes the simple process of the 
separation of proteomic spectra from sera by elec-
trophoresis. A number of protein patterns were 
identiﬁ ed in women with ovarian cancer, leading 
to a speciﬁ city of almost 90% in the identiﬁ cation 
of ovarian cancer. This would seem to be of interest 
in the development of more accurate screening 
technologies, particularly if the protein identities 
could be targeted using a rapid diagnostic test. This 
approach, of course, assumes that ovarian cancer 
progresses by an orderly process according to early 
and late stage. This is by no means clear, however, 
and there is genetic evidence that early - and late -

together with measurement of serum levels of CA -
 125 (Figures  22.1 – 22.3  and see Plate  22.1 ). Ovarian 
cancer secretes CA - 125, which is a glycoprotein. 
Approximately 80% of patients with advanced 
ovarian cancer have elevated CA - 125 levels. Raised 
CA - 125 levels may also occur in patients with 
almost any gynaecological, pancreatic, breast, 
colon, lung or hepatocellular tumour. CA - 125 
levels are elevated in a number of benign condi-
tions including endometriosis, pancreatitis, pelvic 
inﬂ ammatory disease and peritonitis. Changing 
levels may be used to monitor treatment. If the 
tumour is operable, the patient should then be 
booked for a laparotomy. Surgery should be under-
 stage ovarian cancers may be different diseases that 
do not progress from one to the other.  
 Presentation 
 Patients with ovarian cancer usually present to 
their GPs with non - speciﬁ c abdominal symptoms 
such as abdominal discomfort and swelling. There 
may be associated urinary frequency, alteration of 
bowel habit, tenesmus, colicky abdominal pain or 
postmenopausal bleeding. Patients with dissemi-
nated disease may have loss of appetite and weight. 
Early repletion is another common ﬁ nding in the 
history. A patient with these symptoms should be 
examined by her GP, and if there is abdominal 
swelling or a pelvic mass, the patient should be 
referred on to a specialist gynaecologist for his or 
her views as to the patient ’ s management. It is 
unfortunately the nature of ovarian cancer to 
present late, and almost 70% of patients have 
advanced disease at diagnosis. Patients with early -
 stage, localized tumours are often diagnosed as a 
result of the investigation of another medical 
condition. 
 The specialist should see the patient in outpa-
tients and take a full clinical history and examine 
the patient. The examination should include a 
pelvic assessment. If the patient is thought clini-
cally to have ovarian cancer, the investigations 
organized should include a full blood count, 
routine biochemistry, chest X - ray, a pelvic ultra-
sound and an abdominal and pelvic CT scan,

taken in specialist centres by a surgical gynaeco-
logical oncologist. At operation, the abdominal 
contents are examined and, where possible, 
tumour debulking should be undertaken. This 
should include removal of the omentum, ovaries, 
fallopian tubes and uterus, with excision of all 
visible peritoneal deposits. The aim of surgery is to 
remove as much tumour as possible, optimally 
reducing the maximum diameter of any tumour 
deposit to 1  cm or less.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 Ninety - ﬁ ve percent of ovarian cancers are epithe-
lial tumours. The classiﬁ cation of tumours is as in 
Table  22.1 . 
 An attempt should be made to stage the patient ’ s 
tumour. The staging used is the FIGO classiﬁ ca-
tion, which is as follows: 
  ●    Stage 1: growth limited to the ovaries  
  ●    Stage 1A: one ovary, no malignant ascites  
  ●    Stage 1B: both ovaries, no malignant ascites  
  ●    Stage 1C: tumour on ovarian surface or capsular 
rupture or ascites positive for malignant cell  
  ●    Stage 2: growth involving one or both ovaries 
with pelvic extension  
  ●    Stage 3: growth involving one or both ovaries 
with peritoneal implants or superﬁ cial liver metas-
tases or abdominopelvic lymph node involvement 
  ●    Stage 4: tumour metastazing to liver paren-
chyma, pleura or other visceral metastatic sites.

 Treatment 
 Treatment is deﬁ ned by the FIGO staging system. If 
the tumour is conﬁ ned to one ovary, the gynaeco-
logical oncologist may choose to observe the 
patient after deﬁ nitive surgery. For stage 1A and 1B 
ovarian cancer, patients derive no beneﬁ t from 
adjuvant chemotherapy, and studies suggest that 
all patients with more advanced stages can be 
offered chemotherapy with beneﬁ t. Most special-
ists would agree that stage 1A or 1B well differenti-
ated tumours can be observed, but adjuvant 
chemotherapy is increasingly offered to most 
patients with grade 2 and upwards disease irrespec-
tive of stage, and stage 1C and upwards irrespective 
of grade. Patients with early - stage ovarian cancer 
are usually offered single - agent carboplatin as 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer is chemo-
sensitive, and there is a long history of the use of 
chemical agents in the treatment of this condition. 
The discovery of responsiveness to single - agent 
treatments led to the use of combination chemo-
therapy programmes. Intensive treatment using

with stage 1C disease with ovarian cyst rupture is 
variably reported and depends on tumour grade. In 
one series, just 63% of patients survived ﬁ ve years. 
Approximately 60 – 80% of patients with advanced 
ovarian cancer respond to suitable chemotherapy. 
The median survival for this group of patients is 2.5 
years, with less than 30% of patients surviving for 
ﬁ ve years.  
 New  t reatment 
 At present the main  ‘ new ’  treatment for ovarian 
cancer consists of new lines of chemotherapy. 
Agents such as pemetrexed, gemcitabine, topote-
can, oxaliplatin and ixabepilone have been shown 
to be effective. Chemotherapy resistance is one of 
the major features of patients with end - stage 
ovarian cancer, and this may be due to clonal 
evolution with gains of chromosomal material on 
the chromosomes 1 and 17 and losses at chromo-
some 3. 
 However, the explosion of targeted biotherapies 
informed by the results of the Human Genome 
Project is beginning to ﬁ nd its way into ovarian 
cancer clinical trials. The main targets under con-
sideration currently are the epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) receptor ’ s tyrosine kinase intracellular 
domain and its extracellular ligand - binding com-
ponent, the vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) and its receptor, and the IGF/PI3 kinase 
pathway. Treatments are being developed from an 
understanding of platinum resistance, which may 
take its origin from BRCA1 mutant states and 
MSH4 suppressed states, which may respectively 
mediate platinum sensitivity and resistance. 
 Other targets for the modern therapy of ovarian 
cancer include small molecular weight inhibitors 
( ‘ nibs ’ ) and monoclonal antibodies ( ‘ mabs ’ ), and 
treatment with these agents has in some senses 
undergone a renaissance. The early antibody 
studies, with radioisotope - labelled antibodies 
directed against the human milk fat globulin 
given intraperitoneally as an adjuvant to systemic 
chemotherapy, produced some exciting, but non -
 reproducible, survival data. The development of 
new antibodies that are relatively speciﬁ c to 
ovarian cancer is now offering real promise.  
 
 
multiple drug regimens was advocated throughout 
the 1970s and early 1980s. 
 For patients with advanced ovarian cancer it was 
thought during the early 1990s that single - agent 
therapy carboplatin was just as effective as combi-
nation treatments in terms of overall survival, 
although it was thought that there might be a 
minor advantage in terms of initial response rates 
and response duration to combination pro-
grammes. In the late 1990s, fashions changed 
again and treatment involved the use of combina-
tion therapy. There was evidence from randomized 
studies that combination therapy with cisplatin 
and paclitaxel had the highest response rates and 
in two high - proﬁ le studies showed superiority over 
another platinum - based regimen in terms of dis-
ease - free result and overall survival. In this century, 
treatment recommendations have come full cycle, 
and in the results of the ICON 3 study, a large trial 
conducted in the UK and Italy, single - agent carbo-
platin was not shown to be inferior to carboplatin 
and paclitaxel together. Ovarian cancer is, 
however, a highly heterogenous condition of 
many entities, and current advice from the 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excel-
lence (NICE) is that the patient and oncologist 
should discuss whether better beneﬁ t might be 
obtained from single - agent carboplatin or carbo-
platin and paclitaxel on a case - by - case basis. 
 Non - epithelial ovarian cancer is treated initially, 
where possible, by surgery. The procedures may 
range from oophorectomy to extensive tumour 
debulking. In relapse, or where a patient has pre-
sented with gross metastatic disease, treatment 
may involve similar chemotherapy programmes to 
those used for testicular cancer. Occasional 
responses are seen to hormonal therapy, using 
luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone (LHRH)

Head and  n eck  c ancers 
 To the oncologist, the head and neck comprises six 
regions: the nasopharynx (the area behind the 
nose and pharynx), the oral cavity (including the 
lips, ﬂ oor of the mouth, tongue, cheeks, gums and 
hard palate), the oropharynx (the base of the 
tongue, the tonsillar region, the soft palate and 
pharyngeal walls), the hypopharynx (the lower 
throat), the larynx (including the vocal cords and 
both supraglottis and subglottis) and the nasal 
cavity (the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses and the 
parotid, submandibular and minor salivary glands) 
(Figure  23.1 ). Although lymphomas, sarcomas, 
melanomas and other tumours may affect these 
regions, the term  ‘ head and neck cancers ’ generally 
refer to squamous tumours, which make up 90% of 
cancers at these sites. Cancers of the nasopharynx 
include not only squamous cancers but also non -
 keratinizing transitional cell cancers and undiffer-
entiated lymphoepitheliomas. The latter are the 
most common, and, unlike most other head and 
neck cancers, they frequently spread to distant 
sites. Tumours of the salivary glands are the most 
heterogeneous group of tumours of any tissue in 
the body, with almost 40 histological types of sali-
vary gland tumours. Salivary gland tumours are 
more often benign than malignant. Sigmund 
Freud succumbed to cancer of the head and neck in 
1939, attributed to smoking.  
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Head and neck cancers comprise 5% of all cancers 
in the UK and account for 2.5% of cancer deaths. 
They are twice as common in men as women and 
generally occur in those over 50 years old. The sites 
in order of frequency are: the larynx, oral cavity, 
pharynx and salivary glands. Over 90% are squa-
mous carcinomas. Cancer of the head and neck is 
often preventable, and, if diagnosed early, is 
usually curable. Patients, however, often have 
advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. This is 
incurable or requires aggressive treatment, which 
leaves them functionally disabled. The optimum 
management of these tumours requires a multidis-
ciplinary approach, including oncologists, otorhi-
nolaryngologists, oromaxillofacial surgeons and 
plastic surgeons, along with clinical nurse special-
ists, speech and language therapists, dieticians and 
prosthetics technicians. 
 The incidence of head and neck cancers varies 
geographically, as does the most common anatom-
ical site of these cancers. Smoking, high alcohol 
intake and poor oral hygiene are well - established 
risk factors for the development of head and neck 
tumours. In addition, Epstein – Barr virus is impli-
cated in the aetiology of nasopharyngeal carci-
noma in southern China, betel nut chewing in oral 
cancer in Asia, and wood dust inhalation by furni-
ture makers, who may contract nasal cavity adeno-
carcinomas. In the UK, the incidence and mortality 
are greater in deprived populations, most notably 
for carcinoma of the tongue.

example, organ transplant recipients very rarely 
develop cancers that are shown genetically to 
derive from the donor. Transplacental transmis-
sion of malignancy has also been described with 
spread of melanoma from mother to child.  
 Clinical  p resentation 
 Most head and neck tumours present as malignant 
ulcers with raised indurated edges on a surface 
mucosa. Oral tumours present as non - healing 
ulcers with ipsilateral otalgia. Oropharyngeal 
tumours present with dysphagia, pain and otalgia. 
Hypopharyngeal tumours present with dysphagia, 
odynophagia, referred otalgia and neck nodes. 
Laryngeal cancers present with persistent hoarse-
ness, pain, otalgia, dyspnoea and stridor. Nasopha-
ryngeal cancers present with a bloody nasal 
discharge, nasal obstruction, conductive deafness, 
atypical facial pain, diplopia, hoarseness and 
Horner ’ s syndrome. Nasal and sinus tumours 
present with a bloody discharge or obstruction. 
Salivary gland tumours present as painless swell-
ings or facial nerve palsies. Cervical lymph node 
enlargement as the presenting feature is not 
uncommon, particularly when the primary 
tumour lies in certain hidden sites, such as the base 
of the tongue, supraglottis and nasopharynx. Sys-
temic metastases are uncommon at presentation 
 Primary prevention by smoking cessation and 
alcohol abstention are the most effective methods 
of reducing the risk of head and neck cancers. 
Increasing awareness of head and neck cancers 
may encourage earlier referral and diagnosis at a 
stage when the cancer is still curable. In this 
respect, dentists play an important role in examin-
ing the oral mucosa. Retinoids may reduce the risk 
of both recurrence and second primary tumours in 
patients following primary therapy. Moreover, 
they may reduce malignant transformation in pre -
 cancerous conditions such as leukoplakia. 
 Students who are concerned about biodiversity 
or just simply fans of the Looney Tunes cartoon 
character Taz may be concerned to learn that the 
carnivorous marsupial the Tasmanian devil has 
become an endangered species because of a head 
and neck tumour that threatens the survival of the 
whole species. Devil facial tumour disease is a para-
sitic tumour allograft transmitted between indi-
vidual devils. The tumours are all derived from the 
same original cells. Transmissible cancer is 
extremely rare. The only other well - described 
example is canine transmissible venereal tumour 
in dogs, where again it is the actual cancer cells 
themselves that are spread from animal to animal 
rather than transmission of an infection that 
causes the cancer. Occasional similar cancer trans-
mission has been described in humans. For

(10%). Synchronous or metachronous tumours of 
the upper aerodigestive tract occur in 10 – 15% of 
patients. 
 A number of criteria for urgent referral have been 
established (Table  23.1 ). Diagnostic surgical resec-
tion of cervical nodes, without ﬁ rst determining 
the site of the primary tumour, may compromise 
subsequent therapy, increases the morbidity and 
worsens the outcome.  
 Treatment 
 The approach to managing these tumours varies 
according to their site, but in general the primary 
site and potential for cervical lymph node metas-
tases should be considered. Small early stage 1 and 
2 tumours, where there are no regional lymph 
node metastases, should be treated with surgery or 
radiotherapy, with 60 – 69% cure rates. The deci-
sion between surgery and radiotherapy is often 
determined by the anatomical site and the long -
 term morbidity. Function is generally better after 
radiotherapy but requires daily attendance for four 
to six weeks, whilst surgical treatment is quicker, 
but patients need to be ﬁ t for anaesthesia. 
 More advanced tumours are usually managed 
surgically, providing that the tumour is resectable. 
This is followed by adjuvant radiotherapy if the 
margins are insufﬁ cient, or if there is extranodal 
spread, multiple lymph node involvement or 
poorly differentiated histology. The resection of

large tumours may leave sizeable defects, requiring 
myocutaneous ﬂ aps. Inoperable or recurrent 
disease may be treated with combinations of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but outcomes 
generally remain poor, and in many cases of 
advanced disease symptomatic palliation is a more 
valued approach. 
 If cervical lymph node metastases are present, 
surgical resection is recommended, and, recently, 
more limited and selective neck dissection has 
been advocated. This preserves function, especially 
in relation to the accessory nerve, which, if sacri-
ﬁ ced, usually gives rise to a stiff and painful shoul-
der. A scoring index can be used to predict the 
likelihood of metastasis to cervical lymph nodes. If 
the expected incidence of lymph node involve-
ment exceeds 20%, neck dissection is usually 
recommended. 
 The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy, 
the use of hyperfractionated radiotherapy as well 
as intensity - modulated radiotherapy have all 
improved the delivery of radiotherapy for patients 
with advanced head and neck tumours, resulting 
in modest improvements in survival and declines 
in morbidity. The addition of the monoclonal anti-
body cetuximab, which targets epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR), to radiotherapy has been 
shown to double survival in advanced head and 
neck cancer, especially tumours of the orophar-
ynx. However, this widely quoted landmark phase 
III trial did not use cisplatin chemoradiotherapy, 
the gold standard therapy, as the control arm. 
Recurrent or metastatic tumour may be palliated 
with further surgery or radiotherapy to aid local 
control, and systemic chemotherapy has a response 
rate of around 30%. Second malignancies are fre-
quent in patients who have been successfully 
treated for head and neck tumours, with an annual 
rate of 3%, and all patients should be encouraged 
to give up smoking and drinking to lower this risk. 
In addition, a number of studies have addressed 
the role of retinoids and  β - carotene as secondary 
prophylaxis, but none have proved to have any 
signiﬁ cant effect. 
 Quality of life issues are especially important in 
head and neck cancers, given the anatomical site of 
the disease and the consequences of treatment,

Facial numbness or weakness due to cranial 
nerve involvement usually indicates malignancy 
and is an ominous sign. Pleomorphic adenomas, 
although not malignant, often recur if not com-
pletely excised, and a small proportion may 
become malignant if left untreated. Early - stage, 
low - grade malignant salivary gland tumours are 
usually curable by surgical resection alone. The 
prognosis is best for parotid tumours, then sub-
mandibular tumours; the least favourable sites are 
the sublingual and minor salivary glands. Larger or 
high - grade tumours require postoperative radio-
therapy. Complications of surgical treatment for 
parotid neoplasms include facial nerve palsy and 
Frey ’ s syndrome. Frey ’ s syndrome is gustatory 
ﬂ ushing and sweating of the ipsilateral forehead 
because the sympathetic nerve ﬁ bers to the sweat 
glands of the scalp and parasympathetic ﬁ bers to 
the parotid gland have reconnected wrongly after 
the auriculotemporal branch of the trigeminal 
nerve has been severed in surgery; instead of sali-
vating the patient sweats.  
 New  t reatment 
 Conventional radiotherapy is delivered by photons 
or occasionally electron beams ( β - radiation) for 
superﬁ cial tumours. However, particle beam radio-
therapy uses hadrons (colour charge neutral collec-
tions of quarks bound by the strong nuclear force) 
usually protons, neutrons or positive ions. Proton 
beam therapy is the most commonly used of these 
techniques but is only available in one institution 
in the UK currently. The theoretical advantage of 
proton beam radiotherapy is that the higher mass 
of protons results in less scatter and a more concen-
trated delivery of energy to the tumour and greater 
sparing of normal adjacent tissues. Proton beam 
therapy offers promise in the management of head 
and neck cancers as well as other tumours located 
in anatomically challenging sites such as intraocu-
lar melanoma and retinoblastoma. In recent times 
it has been suggested that antiprotons (a fermion 
formed of two anti - up quarks and one anti - down 
quark) and pi - mesons (formed of an up and an 
anti - down quark) could be used as particle beam 
radiotherapy (Box  23.1 ). 
 
 
 
which can affect facial appearance, speech, swal-
lowing and breathing. These cancers have enor-
mous sociopsychological impact and may result in 
physical disability. These concerns must be 
addressed sympathetically with patients. Rehabili-
tation following treatment for head and neck 
cancers needs input from many professionals, par-
ticularly speech and language therapists, dieticians 
and prosthetics technicians. Rehabilitation, fur-
thermore, requires enormous patience and effort 
on behalf of the patient. For example, 40% of 
patients will achieve communication by oesopha-
geal speech following total laryngectomy.  
 Prognosis 
 Five - year survival rates for patients with head and 
neck tumours are listed in Table  23.2 . 
 Salivary  g land  t umours 
 Salivary gland tumours represent around 5% of all 
head and neck cancers and affect both genders 
equally. They are most common in the sixth and 
seventh decades of life. Over half of the tumours 
are benign, and 80% originate in the parotid gland. 
Approximately 25% of parotid tumours, 40% of 
submandibular tumours and over 90% of sublin-
gual gland tumours are malignant. Histologically, 
the most common benign tumour is the pleomor-
phic adenoma, and the most common malignant 
tumour is the mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Most 
patients present with painless swelling of the 
parotid, submandibular or sublingual glands.

 Box 23.1:   A brief lesson in fundamental particles 
 According to the standard model of quantum theory, the universe is made up of fermions (quarks and leptons) and 
bosons (force carriers). There are three sets of quark pairs and three sets of lepton pairs and for every particle there is a 
corresponding antiparticle, denoted by a bar over the symbol. Quarks are named after a quote in James Joyce ’ s  Finnegan ’ s 
Wake  ‘ Three quarks for Muster Mark! ’ and they carry three types of colour charge (which have nothing to do with visible 
colours). Quarks do not exist in isolation but are conﬁ ned in colour charge neutral hadrons. Two types of hadrons exist, 
mesons that are formed from a combination of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons that are formed of three quarks. 
Protons are baryons formed of three quarks (uud) that carry a net +1 electrical charge, whilst neutrons are baryons with 
no net electrical charge (udd), and pi - mesons are formed by a quark (u) and an antiquark ([ d– ]) and carry a +1 electrical 
charge. 
 Four forces or interactions are known, strong force, weak force, electromagnetic force and gravitational force. The 
force carriers or bosons for all but gravity have been identiﬁ ed. The strong nuclear force (also known as the colour 
charge) that holds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei is mediated by gluons exchanging colour charges with 
quarks. The weak nuclear force is responsible for lepton decay and  β - radiation and is mediated by W + , W  −  and Z bosons. 
The electromagnetic force is, of course, mediated by photons whilst the force carrier particle for gravity has not been 
observed but nevertheless has been named graviton.

Endocrine cancers 
 Endocrine cancers are a group of tumours whose 
clinical manifestations seem to delight old - fash-
ioned physicians almost as much as they are con-
cerned for the patients with these cancers. In 
particular, the products that they secrete give rise 
to many unusual syndromes. The majority of 
endocrine tumours are rare, with an incidence of 
0.5 per million of population per annum. But 
others are more common, such as carcinoid 
tumours, which have a reported incidence of 1.5 
per 10 5 of people per annum. These tumours are 
frequently listed as occurring in the context of 
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). MENs are 
due to gene mutations. The MEN 1 gene is encoded 
at chromosome 11q13. The gene product is called, 
imaginatively, menin and encodes a nuclear 
protein that partners with JunD, NF - κ B and many 
other proteins. The function of menin is, however, 
not known, and is lost in MEN 1. Mutations in 
MEN 2 lead to changes in the RET proto - oncogene. 
The RET gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase 
and mutations at different sites within the RET 
gene are associated with MEN type 2A and type 2B, 
Hirschsprung ’ s disease (congenital aganglionic 
megacolon) and medullary thyroid carcinoma. 
This one - gene source of multiple diseases is of 
course a blow to traditional paradigms of genetic 
disease but should perhaps be seen in the context 
of the shrinking genome. The number of genes 
postulated for the human genome has steadily 
fallen from the early days of the Human Genome 
Project, when it was speculated that 50   000 – 75   000 
genes were present in the human genome, to the 
present  ‘ post - genomic ’  era, when estimates have 
decreased to 25   000 genes only. 
 The MEN syndromes are described in Table  24.1 . 
 Thyroid cancer, adrenal cancers and carcinoid 
tumours are discussed in detail in the following 
three chapters.

Thyroid  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Thyroid cancers are relatively uncommon malig-
nancies. There were 1933 patients registered a year 
in the UK with this condition and 341 deaths 
reported in the last national statistics publication. 
There is a 3 to 1 ratio of women to men affected 
with thyroid malignancies. Radiation exposure is 
the most common predisposing factor to the devel-
opment of thyroid cancer, and it was reported for 
many thousands of people across Europe following 
the Chernobyl disaster and in Japanese popula-
tions after the atomic bomb devastations. 
 Thyroid cancer includes a number of clinical 
entities, ranging from the classical papillary, fol-
licular and anaplastic tumours to the atypic 
Hurthle and medullary cell carcinomas, as well as 
thyroid lymphoma. Mutations in BRAF(V599E) are 
seen in 40% of papillary carcinomas. Cyclin D1 
overexpression is observed in approximately 50% 
of papillary carcinomas, while the transcription 
factor E2F1, which is part of the Rb oncogene sig-
nalling pathway, is upregulated in 80% of papillary 
and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Medullary 
thyroid carcinoma is associated with multiple 
endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B (see 
Table  24.1 ). The RET gene encodes a transmem-
brane tyrosine kinase receptor. This gene is 
mutated in almost 100% of all MEN 2A patients 
and in 85% of patients with familial medullary 
thyroid carcinoma families.  
 Presentation 
 The most common presentation of thyroid malig-
nancy is with a thyroid nodule or with cervical 
lymphadenopathy. Much less frequently, patients 
will present with features suggestive of advanced 
disease, such as vocal cord paralysis or with symp-
toms due to metastases.  
 Investigations 
 The diagnosis of a thyroid malignancy is made 
following routine investigations, which should 
include thyroid function, thyroid isotope scan-
ning and thyroid ultrasound. Under ultrasound 
control, ﬁ ne needle aspiration biopsy is used to 
obtain a cytological diagnosis and thereby deﬁ ne 
treatment. Other staging investigations should 
include CT scanning of the neck and thorax. Serum 
calcitonin levels are measured in patients with 
medullary thyroid carcinomas, while serum thy-
roglobulin can be used to monitor relapse in well 
differentiated carcinomas after thyroid ablation.

171
 Treatment 
 After initial staging, patients with thyroid malig-
nancies proceed to surgery. In the majority of 
patients with thyroid cancers, the surgical options 
are either subtotal thyroid resection, removing the 
lobe bearing the tumour together with the thyroid 
isthmus, or total thyroidectomy. Generally, partial 
thryoidectomy is only considered in those patients 
with low - risk tumours, for example those with a 
single focus of papillary carcinoma measuring less 
than 1   cm in diameter. There is no evidence that 
routine lymph node dissection has any added sur-
vival advantage. Subsequent to surgery, patients 
are treated with thyroid replacement, aiming to 
suppress thyroid - stimulating hormone (TSH) com-
pletely, which may be a driver for the development 
of recurrence. 
 When patients with thyroid tumours develop 
recurrent disease, further options for management 
may include surgery or radiation therapy. Surgery 
is the treatment of choice for patients with recur-
rent medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, which is 
relatively resistant to radiation therapy and chem-
otherapy. Radiation treatment is given both by 
using external beam radiotherapy and by treating 
with radioiodine, which localizes to thyroid tissue. 
Thyroid lymphomas are treated with standard 
lymphoma chemotherapy. Their prognosis is said 
to be poor, but this information is based upon 
limited clinical studies and may not be true. These 
data, however, do lead most clinicians to recom-
mend that chemotherapy is followed by adjuvant 
radiotherapy to the thyroid.  
 Prognosis 
 Table  25.1  shows the ﬁ ve - year survival rates for 
thyroid tumours according to histological subtype.  
 New  t reatment 
 New treatments for thyroid cancers target the 
molecular changes seen in this tumour, and in par-
ticular it is possible that the RET oncogenes could 
be a target for treatment with small molecule tyro-
sine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and 
sunitinib. Laboratory work is showing that this 
group of compounds is effective in inhibiting 
kinase activity of RET/PTC3 and leads to reversion 
of the malignant characteristics of transformed 
thyroid cell lines. Sunitinib also causes a dose -
 related inhibition of growth of rat thyroid cells. 
Supporting this theoretical basis for activity is very 
limited clinical trial work, which shows a response 
rate of up to 30%.

Adrenal  c ancers 
 Epidemiology of  a drenal 
 c ortical  c ancers 
 Adrenal cortical cancers are likely to occur with an 
incidence of approximately one per million of 
population per annum. Adrenal cortical cancers 
are derived from the adrenal cortex and may be 
secretory. The major adrenal hormone products of 
these tumours include androgens, aldosterone and 
cortisol. Serum levels of these hormones may be 
elevated, and 24 - hour urinary cortisol secretion 
may be increased.  
 Presentation of  a drenal 
 c ortical  c ancers 
 Patients with adrenal cortical cancers generally 
present with non - speciﬁ c symptoms, such as 
weight loss and general fatigue, or speciﬁ c symp-
toms relating to their anatomical position, which 
include abdominal or loin pain. Adrenal cortical 
cancers may also produce symptoms related to the 
hormones that they secrete. Women may be viri-
lized by the excessive production of androgenic 
hormones. Occasionally, adrenal cortical cancers 
are picked up as a result of an abdominal ultra-
sound or CT scan carried out for another reason.  
 Investigations of  a drenal 
 c ortical  c ancers 
 [The patient with a suspected diagnosis of adrenal 
cortical cancer will generally be investigated in an 
endocrinological or surgical outpatient setting 
where routine blood testing together with speciﬁ c 
endocrinological investigations will be arranged. 
These will include measurement of the adrenal 
androgens, diurnal cortisol production, adreno-
corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels, 24 - hour 
urinary cortisol levels, plain X - rays and CT scans of 
the abdomen, pelvis and chest (Figure  26.1 ). 
 Initial  t reatment of  a drenal 
 c ortical  c ancers 
 Once staging investigations have been completed, 
the patient with a suspected diagnosis of an adrenal 
cortical cancer should be referred on to a specialist 
endocrine surgeon. The patient will proceed to 
laparotomy, and an attempt is made to resect the 
tumour. Surgery is complex, and there may be a 
major morbidity and mortality associated with the 
procedure. There is no clinical advantage to any 
adjuvant treatment.  
 Treatment of  m etastatic or  l ocally 
 a dvanced  a drenal  c ortical  c ancer 
 The secretory symptoms of adrenal cortical 
tumours are unpleasant. Secretory symptoms are

Adrenal cancers Chapter 26
173
most unpleasant in women because of a viriliza-
tion caused by androgenic steroid production. 
These symptoms may include acne, hirsutism, 
change in habitus and increased libido. Attempts 
are made to block the production of hormones by 
an adrenal cortical cancer, using blocking agents 
such as metyrapone and ketoconazole, which 
inhibit steroidogenesis. Treatment may be given 
using OPDD, which is also called  ‘ Mitotane ’ . Mito-
tane is a selective adrenal poison that is structurally 
related to the chlorinated insecticide DDT. DDT is 
a cheap insecticide developed in the 1940s that has 
cumulative toxicity in mammals. It is estimated 
that DDT saved 500 million people globally from 
malaria. In 1962, however, Rachel Carson pub-
lished  The Silent Spring , in which she attributed the 
declining song - bird population to widespread DDT 
use, and there since have been calls to ban DDT 
globally. The alternative insecticides are far more 
expensive, however, as they remain subject to 
patents owned by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Patients with adrenal cortical cancers are also pre-
scribed chemotherapy. Approximately 40% of 
patients will respond and the most effective agents 
include doxorubicin and cisplatin. 
 The secretory symptoms of adrenal carcinoma 
can be controlled with octreotide. This agent has 
no effect on survival and does not lead to reduc-
tions in tumour bulk. 
 Prognosis of  a drenal 
 c ortical  c ancers 
 The outlook for the majority of patients with 
adrenal cortical cancers is very poor, except in the 
patient with localized, small bulk disease. For this 
group of patients, the expectation is for a 70% 
chance of complete cure following surgery. For 
patients with bulky tumours, the expectation is for 
a median survival of one year. Patients with meta-
static tumours survive a median period of four 
months. 
 Adrenal  m edullary  t umours 
 These uncommon tumours occurring in associa-
tion with multiple endocrine neoplasia are a rare 
cause of hypertension. Phaeochromocytomas of 
the adrenal medulla produce their effects by the 
secretion of catecholamines, resulting in intermit-
tent, episodic or sustained hypertension, anxiety, 
tremor, palpitations, sweating, ﬂ ushing, head-
aches, gastrointestinal disturbances and polyuria. 
Twenty - four - hour urinary collection for urinary 
free catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine 
and dopamine) is now the most widely employed 
diagnostic test, although some centres also measure 
catecholamine metabolites such as metanephrines 
and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). The treatment is 
surgical and the results of treatment generally 
excellent. Metastatic phaeochromocytoma may be 
treated with  131 I - MIBG (meta - iodobenzyl guani-
dine), a catecholamine precursor, which may also 
be used to image the tumour.

Carcinoid  t umours 
 Carcinoid tumours are neuroendocrine tumours 
that may arise in numerous anatomical sites, par-
ticularly the gastrointestinal tract and lungs (Table 
 27.1 ). Much of their medical notoriety derives 
from their secretion of vasoactive compounds that 
give rise to the carcinoid syndrome. This usually 
follows the development of liver metastases, when 
ﬁ rst pass metabolism of these products is bypassed. 
Carcinoid tumours are much more common than 
previously recognized but the true incidence is not 
clearly known.  
 Presentation 
 Patients with carcinoid tumours may be asympto-
matic or may present with symptoms due to the 
secretory products of their tumour, if there is sig-
niﬁ cant metastatic disease. These metabolic prod-
ucts cause diarrhoea, ﬂ ushing and occasionally 
bronchospasm. These symptoms are so speciﬁ c 
that there is little difﬁ culty in making a diagnosis, 
which is often achieved in general practice.  
 Investigations 
 The presence of symptoms is likely to indicate that 
the patient with a carcinoid tumour has metastatic 
disease. The examination of such a patient should 
be conﬁ ned to establishing the extent of disease 
and obtaining a histological diagnosis. The investi-
gations that are required include a blood count, 
liver function test, chest X - ray and a CT scan of the 
chest and abdomen (Figure  27.1 ). Twenty - four -
 hour urinary 5HIAA (5 - hydroxyindole - acetic acid) 
levels should be measured. This is because 5HIAA is 
the excretory product of the metabolites produced 
by carcinoids and results from the breakdown of 
5HT (5 - hydroxytryptamine or serotonin). There 
has been interest in the use of chromagranin A as a 
serum marker for carcinoid. This is a neurosecre-
tory product that is of value because we can 
monitor carcinoid using this as a blood test, rather 
than having to carry out 24 - hour urinary collec-
tions to measure 5HIAA.  
 Treatment 
 Pharmacological  c ontrol 
 These agents act to block the synthesis, release and 
peripheral blockade of circulating tumour prod-
ucts. The list of drugs used in the treatment of car-
cinoid symptoms include inhibitors of 5HT 
synthesis such as parachlorphenylalanine, periph-
eral 5HT antagonists such as cyproheptadine, anti-
histamines, and inhibitors of 5HT release such as 
somatostatin and its long - acting analogues. The 
most frequently used somatostatin analogue is

ucts, to ﬁ brosis at other sites, such as in the retro-
peritoneum, where it may lead to small bowel 
obstruction. 
 Embolization 
 When metastatic disease in the liver is extensive, 
hepatic artery embolization may be considered. 
This involves selective cannulation of the artery 
with injection of embolic material. This will lead to 
sustained symptom relief in the majority of 
patients. There may be signiﬁ cant side effects from 
embolization, and so this procedure is not entered 
into without due consideration of the beneﬁ ts. In 
some clinical series, mortality rates are 3 – 5%. 
 Prognosis 
 The prognosis for patients with metastatic carci-
noid tumour is relatively good in comparison to 
that for most metastastic tumours. Patients with 
metastatic carcinoid tumour commonly survive a 
considerable time and the expectation, even in the 
presence of liver disease, is that approximately 
36% of patients will survive ﬁ ve years and 20% for 
10 years. In the absence of metastases and follow-
ing resection of the primary, the outlook is excel-
lent. Carcinoid tumours of different primary sites 
octreotide, and this leads to a relief of symptoms in 
80% of patients for a median duration of 10 
months. 
 Cytokines 
 Interferon has been used to treat patients with met-
astatic carcinoid tumours. Symptom relief will 
occur in between 50% and 60% of patients. Less 
than 5% of patients, however, achieve any signiﬁ -
cant tumour regression. Treatment with interferon 
is associated with signiﬁ cant side effects, which 
may include ﬂ u - like symptoms; for this reason, it is 
not generally given.  
 Complications of  c arcinoid 
 h ormone  p roduction 
 Carcinoid heart disease develops in patients with 
5HT - producing neuroendocrine tumours. It is due 
to the formation of ﬁ brous plaques within the 
heart, causing valvular dysfunction. Classically, 
the valves affected are right - sided. Right - sided 
heart failure due to valve disease is treated surgi-
cally by valve replacement. In view of the under-
lining excellent prognosis for carcinoid tumours, 
this condition is actively treated. Carcinoid 
tumours also lead, because of their secreted prod-

are thought to have different outlooks, but this is 
very much debated.  
 New  t reatment 
 Carcinoid tumours highly express epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) but not ErbB. There 
is a potential therefore to treat this group of 
patients with EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab or 
erlotinib. Neuroendocrine tumours express vascu-
lar endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its recep-
tor (VEGFR). Sunitinib, an agent that targets the 
tyrosine kinases of VEGF and VEGFR, has some 
minimal efﬁ cacy with up to 15% of patients 
improving and 70% having stable disease with 
treatment.

Pituitary  t umours 
 Pituitary tumours are common, and the most 
common are prolactinomas with an incidence of 
up to one in 3000 of the population per annum. 
Pituitary tumours arise from the anterior lobe and 
produce their effects by uncontrolled production 
of speciﬁ c hormones, by destruction of normal 
pituitary tissues leading to hypopituitarism, or by 
compressing adjacent structures such as the optic 
chiasm, hypothalamus and bony structures (Table 
 28.1 ). Secretory tumours produce syndromes that 
cause gross clinical signs and symptoms. The local 
symptoms include headaches and visual ﬁ eld loss. 
The systemic symptoms produced depend upon 
the secreted product and range from acromegaly to 
pituitary Cushing ’ s. 
 Treatment options include blocking agents, such 
as bromocriptine, neurosurgery and radiotherapy. 
The mainstay of therapy, however, is surgery,

which is important in establishing the histological 
diagnosis, in decompressing the optic chiasm and 
in relieving obstructive hydrocephalus, as well as 
in completely excising the tumour. A transfrontal 
approach is required for large tumours with extra-
sellar extension, while a trans - sphenoidal approach 
is safer and tolerated better for smaller tumours. 
Radiotherapy may be used as the primary treat-
ment for intrasellar tumours and as an adjunct to 
surgery for larger tumours. The outlook is generally 
excellent. 
 There are no classical oncogene mutations in 
pituitary tumours. However, there are clues to the 
development of this group of malignancies that 
come from dysregulation of the inhibitory compo-
nents of the  β - catenin pathway, and the relation-
ship of this pathway to the cadherins. Both the Akt 
and MAPK pathways appear to be overexpressed in 
many pituitary tumours, and this causes an inhibi-
tion of the inhibitors of the cell cycle. This is equiv-
alent to snapping the brake cable as you are 
bicycling down a steep hill.

Parathyroid  c ancers 
 Parathyroid carcinomas are extremely rare, with 
an annual incidence of 0.5 – 1 per million of the 
population. Parathyroid cancers secrete parathor-
mone, and for this reason the majority of patients 
present with hypercalcaemia. The hypercalcaemia 
is usually gross and, rather oddly, patients may be 
asymptomatic, with a calcium level that would 
normally be associated with death in the acute sit-
uation. The reason for this is that this condition 
generally has a long natural history and may have 
been present for many years prior to diagnosis. 
Calcium levels in excess of 4   mmol/l are frequently 
reported and the patient ’ s cellular processes will 
have adapted to this level of hypercalcaemia. The 
primary treatment for this condition is surgical. 
The outlook for patients with metastatic disease is 
awful.

Thoracic  c ancers 
 In a celebrated television documentary  Death in the 
West , produced in 1976 by Thames Television, the 
vice president of Philip Morris attempted to dismiss 
established links between tobacco and cancer. 
During the interview he said:  ‘ Too much of any-
thing can kill you. Too much apple sauce can kill 
you. ’ And:  ‘ If there were something harmful in 
tobacco smoke, we could remove it ’ . Despite 
numerous court cases since, the tobacco industry 
continues to target the young and encourage 
smoking. It took until 1999 for the Royal Family to 
withdraw its royal warrant from the tobacco multi-
national Gallaher, which entitled them to display 
 ‘ By Appointment ’ on packs of Benson  & Hedges 
cigarettes. This was despite the death of the last 
three kings from tobacco - related disease, including 
King George VI, who died of lung cancer. 
 Thoracic cancers include primary lung cancers 
and mesotheliomas, although a number of other 
cancers may occur in the thorax: particularly hae-
matological cancers. Primary lung cancer has 
recently been pushed into second place in the 
ranking order of cancer registration in men (Table 
 30.1 ) and has a very poor overall survival rate 
(Table  30.2 ).

Lung  c ancer 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Carcinoma of the bronchus is the second most 
common tumour of men and the second most 
common cancer of women. The overall prospects 
for survival are poor: only between 5% and 8% of 
patients survive ﬁ ve years from diagnosis. Cur-
rently in the UK, there are approximately 39   000 
men and women registered annually with carci-
noma of the bronchus: 22   300 men and 16   600 
women. The latest survival ﬁ gures indicate that 
34   500 of these people will die from their tumour. 
 The most important cause of carcinoma of the 
bronchus is smoking, and the incidence of lung 
cancer is directly related to the number of ciga-
rettes smoked. Although the overall incidence of 
smoking is decreasing in the UK at a rate of a little 
under 1% per annum, there has been an increase in 
women smokers and in young smokers, and this 
bodes poorly for the future. 
 There are other risk factors for developing lung 
cancer. These include exposure to asbestos and 
heavy metals, such as nickel, and ﬁ brotic disease of 
the lung. Air pollution is a signiﬁ cant factor in the 
development of lung cancers, and it is often said 
that living in London has the equivalent effect on 
lung cancer incidence to smoking ﬁ ve cigarettes a 
day. Similarly, proximity to industrial pollution 
has a signiﬁ cant impact upon mortality rates. 
 As with so many other tumour groups, there is 
signiﬁ cant interest in the molecular biology of 
lung cancer. Amongst the ﬁ rst observations of the 
molecular changes in lung cancer were mutations 
in the Ras family of oncogenes, which have guano-
sine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and are 
important as second messengers linking events 
between the cell membrane and nucleus. The 
history of the molecular biology of lung cancer 
reads almost like a contemporaneous commentary 
on the development of our understanding of the 
molecular biology of cancer, and the next to be dis-
covered were mutations in the tumour suppressor 
genes Rb and p53 present in at least 80% of all 
small cell lung cancers. Loss of heterozygosity of a 
number of chromosomes has been observed in 
small cell lung cancer. These include chromosomes 
3, 9, 12, 13 and 17. The changes in chromosome 17 
involve the c - erb - B2 oncogene and this has led to 
the development of new therapeutic approaches to 
the management of lung cancer. 
 More recently, observations of abnormal DNA 
methylation of the cyclin D2 gene has been 
described in approximately 60% of small cell 
cancer lines. The cyclin D2 gene has a primary 
function in cell cycle regulation and has recently 
been brought to the general public ’ s attention 
because of the awards of the 2001 Nobel Prizes to 
the scientists involved in this discovery who

cancer patients has generally improved through-
out the country.  
 The signs of carcinoma of the bronchus are 
many and of particular interest is the observation 
of clubbing of the ﬁ ngers occurring in non - small 
cell carcinoma of the bronchus. The aetiology of 
ﬁ nger clubbing, which is associated with hyper-
trophic osteoarthropathy and polyarthralgias, has 
been postulated as including the secretion of par-
athormone (PTH) by tumours and also, more 
recently, the ectopic secretion of platelet - derived 
growth factor (see Figures  45.2  and  45.3 ). Other 
clinical abnormalities may include Horner ’ s syn-
drome (Figure  31.2 ) or hoarseness, which are 
pointers to inoperability as a result of nerve entrap-
ment by the tumour, and dysphagia which comes 
as a result of mediastinal nodal enlargement. Para-
neoplastic syndromes are commonly associated 
with lung cancer, particularly the small cell carci-
noma variant. These include cutaneous syndromes 
of dermatomyositis and acanthosis nigricans, the 
neurological complications of peripheral neuropa-
thy and the Eaton – Lambert syndrome. The endo-
crine features of ectopic PTH, adrenocorticotrophic 
hormone (ACTH) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) 
secretion are all spectacular in their presentations.  
included Sir Paul Nurse. Sir Paul Nurse according to 
 The Sun  is  ‘ the David Beckham of science ’ . He later 
became the director of CRUK (Cancer Research UK) 
but that did not stop him saying that Margaret 
Thatcher did  ‘ a good job of ruining British science ’ . 
 Presentation 
 Patients with carcinoma of the bronchus generally 
present with a cough or haemoptysis. This may be 
associated with weight loss and symptoms of meta-
static cancer, such as bone pain (Figure  31.1 ) or 
jaundice. Patients with chest symptoms suggestive 
of a diagnosis of carcinoma of the bronchus are 
generally referred promptly by general practition-
ers to a specialist chest physician. One of the con-
cerns of oncologists in the 1990s was the lack of 
referral on from specialist chest physicians to 
oncologists, with patients regarded somewhat as 
property and their treatment proprietarily. One of 
the major changes that we have seen in this current 
decade has come about as a result of the central 
promotion of the philosophy of the multidiscipli-
nary team. As a result, there is multispecialty input 
into the management of lung cancer patients and 
it is the view of these authors that the care of lung

hand). Horner (1831 – 1886) was a Swiss ophthalmologist; Pancoast (1875 – 1939) was an American radiologist.  
 Investigations should include a full blood count, 
liver function tests, chest X - ray (Figure  31.3 ) and 
sputum cytology. Bronchoscopy is organized and 
should proceed within a few days (Plate  31.1 ). 
Biopsies and washings are then obtained and 
examined microscopically. By these means, a his-
tological diagnosis will be achieved. Diagnosis may 
not be achieved in the context of peripheral lesions 
and if this is the case, then needle biopsies under 
CT scanning or ﬂ uoroscopic imaging should be 
arranged. (See also Figures  2.6 ,  45.1 ,  45.3 ,  46.1 and 
 46.5  and Plate  46.1 .) 
 Pathology 
 There are a number of different variants of carci-
noma of the bronchus, and these histological clas-
siﬁ cations are important in that they deﬁ ne the 
patient ’ s further treatment. The main histological 
variants are squamous cell carcinoma, small cell 
carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carci-
noma. For treatment purposes, tumours are 
described as either being small or non - small cell 
cancers. These constitute 95% of primary lung neo-
plasms. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 
approximately 40% of lung cancers, with adeno-
carcinoma accounting for 30% and small cell carci-
noma for 25% of all lung tumours. Approximately 
10% of lung cancers are of mixed histology. Rarer 
variants include carcinoid tumours, lymphomas 
and hamartomas.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 Lung cancer staging is usually by the TNM classiﬁ -
cation. Staging should include a CT scan of the 
chest and abdomen, a radioisotope bone scan, a 
liver ultrasound and ideally a positron emission 
tomography (PET) scan. Although not carried out 
routinely, examination of the bone marrow by 
aspiration and trephine in small cell lung cancer 
shows the presence of metastases in 95% of 
patients. Pulmonary function tests to assess vital 
capacity are essential, both to assess operability,

and to ensure that the patient is not left with pro-
found breathlessness following lung resection.  
 Treatment 
 Treatment of  n on - s mall  c ell  l ung  c ancer 
 Non - small cell lung cancer may be treated with 
either surgery or with radiation treatment. Surgery 
is only possible for patients with limited stage 
disease; that is, T1N0M0 and T2N0M0 disease, and 
a small number with T2N1M0 tumours. There is 
increasing surgical enthusiasm for operating on 
more extensive tumours, and it is not uncommon 
to ﬁ nd patients with T3 disease proceeding to 
surgery. The results of this approach are poor, 
however. 
 The UK falls below the European average in terms 
of the number of people proceeding to surgery 
because of issues of resource availability in terms of 
scans and surgeons. Surgery has a signiﬁ cant mor-
bidity and mortality, and operability depends 
upon lung function prior to resection, together 
with cardiac status and the presence of other major 
illnesses. It is estimated that approximately 30% of 
patients with non - small cell carcinoma of the lung 
have operable tumours. The ﬁ ve - year survival for 
this group of patients is variably quoted at between 
5% and 40%. A review of 2675 patients gave a ﬁ ve -
 year survival of 30%. There is a subgroup variation 
in survival, depending upon pathological staging 
and histology. For example, if those operable 
patients with adenocarcinoma are considered, the 
expectation for survival ranges between 38% and 
79% and averages 65% at ﬁ ve years. If, on the other 
hand, operable patients under 40 years of age are 
considered, survival rises to 70%. 
 Radical radiotherapy, that is, radiotherapy given 
with curative intent, is considered for those 
patients who have inoperable disease by virtue of a 
poor medical state rather than spread of the cancer. 
Five - year survival ﬁ gures of 6% were reported in a 
review of 1487 patients. Conventionally, patients 
receive 6000  cGy over a six - week period. More 
rapid treatment regimens are used, particularly in 
the north of England, and similar survival ﬁ gures 
are found. 
 For the majority of patients with more advanced 
cancer, palliative radiotherapy is the only treat-
ment option. This is given to patients who have 
symptoms as a result of their disease, which might 
include haemoptyses, breathlessness or chest pain.

tumour of speciﬁ c growth factors and hormones. 
One of the commonest is hyponatraemia, due to 
inappropriate secretion of ADH. This is treated by 
water restriction or tetracyclines. Steroids are pre-
scribed in high dose for the treatment of polymy-
ositis, Eaton – Lambert syndrome and the peripheral 
neuropathies associated with small cell lung 
cancer. Ectopic ACTH secretion may require high -
 dose therapy with adrenal enzyme - blocking drugs 
such as metyrapone and ketoconazole. Unfortu-
nately, these two agents have toxicity in the 
dosages used and may make the patient feel awful. 
In this context, adrenalectomy may be rarely 
required. 
 New  t reatment 
 One of the most exciting developments of recent 
times has been that of speciﬁ c therapies aimed at 
the molecular abnormalities expressed by cancer 
cells. The observation of aberrant epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in non -
 small cell lung cancer has led to the hope that 
agents directed against this receptor may provide a 
therapeutic advance. The most interest recently 
has been around the use of geﬁ tinib (Iressa) and 
erlotinib (Tarceva), which are EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. There is some evidence of activity in 
non - small cell lung cancer, with disease stability 
being the best outcome. Women, non - smokers 
and patients with adenocarcinoma or bronchoal-
veolar carcinoma histologies are more likely to 
respond. These agents are used with a degree of 
optimism in patients with bronchioalveolar carci-
nomas and adenocarcinomas, with response rates 
of up to 30%. Response rates are highest in those 
patients with EGFR mutations reaching up to 80%. 
The proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has some 
efﬁ cacy in non - small cell carcinoma, but the best 
hope for this agent in terms of outcome is for 
stable disease. Future investigations of these agents 
hinge around their combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Side effects are 
reported, the most common of which is an ery-
thematous skin reaction, and the occurrence of 
this rash seems to be associated with tumour 
responsiveness. 
 
Radiotherapy is given according to various pre-
scriptions; some radiotherapists advise a single 
dose of 1000 – 1500   cGy, others 3000  cGy in 10 frac-
tions over two weeks. Radiotherapy, too, has side 
effects, and these include tiredness, oesophagitis 
and skin changes. 
 There is a limited place for chemotherapy in this 
condition. Response rates for the most active regi-
mens are in the range of 15 – 25%. The median sur-
vival of responding patients is six to seven months, 
offering only minor though statistically signiﬁ cant 
survival advantage over palliative therapy. Combi-
nation therapy using regimens such as MIC (mito-
mycin C, ifosfamide and cisplatin) is considered to 
be too toxic in view of the low response rates. Sin-
gle - agent therapy using agents such as vinorelbine 
or platinum - based doublets have a role in the ﬁ tter 
patient, and may be used as primary neoadjuvant 
therapy in rendering operable the surgically inop-
erable patient and as adjuvant therapy following 
surgery. 
 Treatment of  s mall  c ell  l ung  c ancer 
 Small cell lung cancer is an entirely different 
disease from non - small cell lung cancer. It is very 
rare for patients to have localized small cell lung 
cancer, and approximately 95% of patients with 
small cell lung cancer have metastatic disease at 
presentation. 
 The most important modality of treatment for 
small cell lung cancer is chemotherapy. The 
current chemotherapy programme of ﬁ rst choice is 
etoposide and cisplatin. Approximately 80% of 
patients have an initial response to chemotherapy 
with this and similar programmes, and this gener-
ally includes a complete remission rate of up to 
60% of patients. However, the great majority of 
small cell lung cancers will recur after chemother-
apy. Untreated, the median survival is three 
months. With treatment, 10 – 20% of patients will 
survive for two years and 5% for ﬁ ve years.

Mesothelioma 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 The incidence of mesothelioma has been steadily 
increasing, and it is estimated that the lifetime risk 
is around 0.5 – 1%. This tumour was originally 
described by occupational health doctors working 
in the asbestos factories in the East End of London 
around the time of the end of the First World War. 
It would appear, however, that this information 
was suppressed, and it was not until the 1960s that 
the association between mesothelioma and asbes-
tos exposure was clearly publicized. 
 The development of mesothelioma is generally 
related to asbestos exposure, but this is not always 
the case. The risk of mesothelioma is not related to 
the amount of exposure. It may not only occur in 
the asbestos worker but also in family members 
exposed to the ﬁ bres of asbestos brought home in 
their spouse ’ s, father ’ s or mother ’ s clothes. There 
are no speciﬁ c chromosomal changes associated 
with the development of mesothelioma, but there 
are a host of abnormalities that may occur, which 
are entirely non - speciﬁ c. Different asbestos ﬁ bres 
have different properties and carcinogenicity. The 
most carcinogenic ﬁ bres tend to be the needle -
 shaped blue (crocidolite) and brown (amosite) 
asbestos rather than the commoner corkscrew -
 shaped white asbestos (chrysotile) (Table  32.1 ). 
 Presentation 
 Mesothelial tumours take their origins in the 
pleura or peritoneum. Patients with mesothelioma 
characteristically present with pleural effusions or 
ascites. 
 Investigations 
 The diagnosis of mesothelioma may be suspected 
from a chest X - ray (Figure  32.1 ), where a patient 
may have pleural thickening and an effusion. CT 
scanning will show the extent of the pleural or 
peritoneal tumour. The next step in the investiga-
tory process is to carry out a pleural or peritoneal 
biopsy. Multiple biopsies are usually required to 
make the diagnosis.  
 Possibly the most important aspect of the care of 
patients with mesothelioma is to ensure that the 
appropriate compensatory mechanisms are put in 
place. In the UK, industrial compensation is 
usually arranged for patients by their union ofﬁ c-
ers and involves an examination of the tumour by 
a pathology panel. It is enormously important for 
the patient and his or her family that the clinician 
signposts this process. 
 Often a pleural biopsy may not be sufﬁ cient 
to obtain diagnostic material, in which case

Recurrent effusions are a dramatic problem for

 Treatment 
 Unfortunately, the majority of patients with mes-
othelioma present with incurable disease. Treat-
ment options are limited. Chemotherapy is

sis according to four risk groups, but for all these 
groups the median progression - free survival 
ranged from 2.1 to 5.3 months, an indication of 
how poorly responsive to chemotherapy mesothe-
lioma is. 
 Mesothelioma patients have high circulating 
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
and mesothelioma tissue stains strongly positively 
for VEGF receptor 3. For this reason patients with 
mesothelioma have been treated with antibodies 
to VEGF, such as bevacizumab, and with angiogen-
esis inhibitors, such as thalidomide. Bevacizumab, 
a recombinant monoclonal antibody to VEGF, has 
not been effective but agents such as thalidomide 
have led to disease stabilization in patients with 
progressive mesothelioma. Approximately 25% of 
patients have stable disease for a period of more 
than six months as a result of treatment with tha-
lidomide. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of 
VEGF receptor and platelet - derived growth factor 
receptors, has led to responses in heavily pretreated 
patients. 
 Mesothelioma is an awful tumour to have and 
there is limited hope for new therapeutic strate-
gies. The one true hope that exists is in the reduc-
tion of risk to workers, which is little compensation 
for those currently suffering as a result of the global 
epidemic. 
 
 
generally ineffective, with response rates in the 
order of less than 10% although newer combina-
tions of cisplatinum and permetrexed offer promise. 
Radiation therapy may be helpful in controlling 
pain and is often given to pleural biopsy track sites 
to prevent the tumour growing down these chan-
nels. Multiple pleurodeses are often required, with 
installation into the pleural cavities of materials 
such as talc, tetracycline and bleomycin. There 
have been times when cytokine treatment was 
thought to be effective, with interferon being given 
into the thoracic cavity. This has, however, not 
proven to be a successful treatment option.  
 Prognosis 
 Unfortunately, the outlook for patients with 
mesothelioma is poor, with survival for patients 
with advanced disease ranging between 6 and 18 
months. 
 New  t reatment 
 Recently, responses have been reported for peme-
trexed, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, and 
reductase. This is likely to become the standard.

Haematological  c ancers 
 Louis Leakey found possibly the oldest hominid 
malignant tumour in 1932 in the remains of either 
a  Homo erectus  or an  Australopithecus . This tumour 
was suggestive of a Burkitt ’ s lymphoma, although 
that nomenclature was certainly not in use then. 
The leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma are 
amongst the success stories in cancer treatment, 
with major advances in the second half of the 20th 
century. Cancer chemotherapy started with the 
treatment of these malignancies in the 1940s, fol-
lowing the demonstration by Alfred Gilman and 
Louis Goodman at Yale of lymphoma regression in 
mice with nitrogen mustard and their treatment of 
the ﬁ rst patient in 1944. Shortly afterwards, Sidney 
Farber at Harvard began to use folate antagonists in 
children with acute leukaemia, and in 1947 he 
reported temporary remissions with aminopterin. 
Since that era, when childhood acute leukaemia 
was universally fatal, the long - term remission rate 
has risen to over 80%. Perhaps because of this 
success, medical oncologists and haematologists 
often ﬁ ght over the management of haematologi-
cal malignancies in the UK. 
 The leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma are 
discussed in more detail in the following four 
chapters.

The  l eukaemias 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Leukaemias are relatively common with a prepon-
derance of men affected. In the UK, the Ofﬁ ce of 
National Statistics recently registered 4229 male 
and 3008 female leukaemia patients, with 2492 
male and 1858 female deaths annually. The leu-
kaemias are described generally as either acute or 
chronic. The main variants are lymphoid and 
myeloid leukaemia, which account for almost 95% 
of leukaemia. Acute lymphoid leukaemia is mar-
ginally more common than acute myeloid leukae-
mia (AML). Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 
is far more common in childhood than AML, and 
in adults approximately 80% of all the acute leu-
kaemias are myeloid. Patients with Down ’ s syn-
drome are at increased risk of leukaemia, as are 
patients with certain other conditions with a chro-
mosomal basis, such as Klinefelter ’ s syndrome, 
Fanconi ’ s syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia. 
 The biology of leukaemia has been studied inten-
sively over the last 20 years. With this investiga-
tion, the idea of a monoclonal origin of leukaemias 
has developed. The leukaemic clone is thought to 
have a survival advantage over normal haemato-
logical cells. One of the ﬁ rst leukaemias to be char-
acterized at a molecular level was chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (CML), where there is a fusion between 
chromosomes 9 and 22 that juxtaposes the BCR 
and ABL genes, which is observed cytogenetically 
as the  ‘ Philadelphia ’  chromosome. This molecular 
abnormality may be seen in other haematological 
cells, such as platelet and red cell precursors. The 
protein product of a fusion gene may have aberrant 
function. For example, the BCR - ABL protein is 
thought to provide protection from chemotherapy 
drugs by interfering with apoptosis. 
 Other hybrid genes of interest occur in the leu-
kaemias. For example, acute promyelocytic leukae-
mias (APMLs) are characterized by a translocation 
between chromosomes 15 and 17. The resultant 
fusion gene is formed between part of the PML 
gene and the retinoic acid alpha receptor gene, 
RARA. This hybrid gene interacts with chromo-
somal histone deacetylase complexes. Treatment 
with retinoic acid leads to dissociation of this 
complex and a transient remission of the leukae-
mia. Some examples of the fusion genes seen in 
leukaemia are described in Table  34.1 . 
 Point mutations and gene deletions are also seen 
in leukaemias involving oncogenes such as p53 
and RAS. P53 mutations are seen in ALL and blast 
crisis of CML, and N - RAS and c - KIT mutations are 
found in AML. It should be noted that the predom-
inant molecular change in leukaemia is chromo-
somal translocation. This is in contrast with solid 
tumours, where the predominant changes are gene 
deletions and ampliﬁ cations.

 Although there is a greater understanding of the 
molecular biology of leukaemia, the reason for the 
genetic changes observed is not known. The excep-
tions are those rare leukaemias that occur in the 
context of exposure to radiation or as secondary 
events following chemotherapy. Such secondary 
leukaemias are commonly associated with chro-
mosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (see Figure  3.11 ). 
 Presentation 
 The presentation of patients with acute leukaemia 
is remarkable in its dramatic onset. It is usual to 
obtain a history that dates back only a few days, 
with features of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and 
leucopenia, although some people date their 
symptoms back for much longer periods. Chronic 
leukaemia may be diagnosed as an incidental 
ﬁ nding, for example when a blood count is per-
formed as part of a routine screen for another 
medical problem. Patients with chronic leukaemia 
may have abdominal discomfort due to splenom-
egaly or present with anaemia or lymphadenopa-
thy. Such presentations generally tend to be 
insidious; this is particularly the case for chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The situation is a 
little different for CML, which progresses from a 
chronic to an accelerated to a blast phase. The diag-
nosis can be made at any point in this clinical 
course. 
 Investigations and  c lassiﬁ cation 
 The diagnosis of acute leukaemia is made by an 
examination of the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow (see Plates  34.1 – 34.3 ). In ALL, a lumbar 
puncture will be performed in order to investigate 
the possibility of CNS inﬁ ltration. Two common 
cytochemical stains are used to distinguish 
between acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemias. These are the Sudan black, which is 
usually positive in AML and negative in ALL, and 
the periodic acid – Schiff (PAS) test, which is usually 
positive in ALL and negative in AML. The PAS stain 
is outmoded and has been largely replaced by 
immunophenotyping. 
 The classiﬁ cation of acute leukaemias usually 
follows the French – American – British (FAB) classi-
ﬁ cation, which essentially describes the degree of 
differentiation and maturation. The myelogenous 
leukaemias are described as M1 to M7, and acute 
leukaemias as L1 to L3 (Table  34.2 ). 
 Immunophenotyping is also carried out in sus-
pected acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, where the 
presence of B - and T - cell markers is sought out. 
More than 70% of adult acute lymphocytic leukae-
mias are of B - cell origin. Following immunophe-
notyping, cytogenic and molecular analysis is 
carried out in order to deﬁ ne chromosomal and 
molecular abnormalities, which provide prognos-
tic information. Cytogenetic analysis is useful in 
the diagnosis of CML but may not be particularly 
helpful in CLL. 
 The 8;21 translocation in AML is associated with 
a good prognosis and occurs in about 8% of 
patients. The inversion or reciprocal translocation 
t(16;16) of chromosome 16 is associated with the 
M4 phenotype and again confers a favourable

response. Translocation with an 11q23 breakpoint 
is a poor prognostic feature. The presence of the 
Philadelphia chromosome is found in about 5% of 
childhood and 25% of adult ALL, and is thought to 
perhaps indicate transformation from a chronic 
myeloid leukaemia phase: this is an adverse prog-
nostic feature. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(Table  34.3 and see Plates  34.4 – 34.6 ) is a tumour of 
B - cell origin in 95% of patients.  
 Cytogenetic changes are described in up to 80% 
of patients with CLL. Although there is no particu-
lar pattern that emerges to characterize this leukae-
mia, ﬁ ve or six abnormalities are usually observed. 
Trisomy 12, for example, the most common cyto-
genetic abnormality, is found in just one - third of 
patients. Patients with CLL are classiﬁ ed using a 
number of different systems, most of which are 
helpful in describing survival related to lymphocy-
tosis, lymph node involvement and the presence or 
absence of anaemia or thrombocytopenia.  
 Treatment 
 The management of acute leukaemia is complex. It 
requires psychological support of the individual 
and of the family, and active and urgent treatment, 
particularly for the acute leukaemias. Initial treat-
ment involves attempts to stabilize the patient by 
transfusion of red cells and platelets, combined 
with treatment of infection by antibiotics to limit 
the complications that may occur with the initia-
tion of chemotherapy. These mainly revolve 
around the tumour lysis syndrome. Rehydration is 
required, and the patient is started on allopurinol 
to prevent the metabolic abnormalities that are 
described in detail in Chapter  46  of this book. 
 The chemotherapy that is given to patients with 
leukaemia has evolved as a result of many clinical 
trials over very many years, involving the Medical 
Research Council (MRC) in the UK, and the Cancer 
and Leukaemia Group B in the USA. The mainstay 
of induction chemotherapy in adult has been the 
use of daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside 
given in a daily schedule, the dosage and duration 
of which is varied and repeated upon recovery of 
haematological parameters. 
 During treatment, patients require supportive 
therapies with blood products such as platelets and 
red cells. Platelet support is given to keep platelet 
counts above 10    ×  10 9 /l, which limits the risk of 
spontaneous haemorrhage. There is a risk of immu-
nization against platelets, which may require 
human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matched transfu-
sions rather than random donor platelet transfu-
sion. Patients are of course at risk from neutropenic 
sepsis, which is treated with intravenous antibiot-
ics. Prolonged neutropenia may be associated with 
fungal infection. In the context of persistent fever, 
particularly following transplantation, antifungal 
therapy is instituted. CT scanning may be appro-
priate in order to diagnose  Aspergillus  pneumonia. 
There is little evidence to suggest that any prophy-
lactic antifungal treatment is of value, but rand-
omized studies have shown that prophylaxis with 
antibiotics such as co - trimoxazole reduces the risk 
of  Pneumocystis  infection. 

The leukaemias Chapter 34
193
required, is similar to treatment given for low -
 grade lymphoma, with single - agent chlorambucil, 
steroids and occasionally combination therapy, all 
being helpful.  
 Treatment of  r ecurrent  d isease 
 Although 50% of patients with good - prognosis 
acute leukaemia survive, the majority of patients 
still die. Relapse generally occurs within the ﬁ rst 
two years. Patients are usually re - treated with 
chemotherapy, with a 50% chance of re - entering 
remission and a 10% chance of cure. It is usual in 
these situations to use a different induction drug 
regimen, which is frequently more intensive, 
with a greater risk of treatment complications 
and death. Recurrence in chronic leukaemia may 
require stem cell transplantation, but this is not 
the practice for CLL.  
 Leukaemia in  y oung  c hildren 
 Acute lymphocytic leukaemia is the commonest 
childhood leukaemia. Overall, the prospects for 
cure are very good, with a chance in excess of 80% 
of a sustained remission. The treatment of acute 
childhood leukaemia owes a great debt to the 
MRC - organized trials, which have examined 
issues such as the duration of therapy both for 
induction and maintenance, the need for cranial 
irradiation to prevent central nervous system 
relapse and the value of the individual drugs 
within the treatment programmes. Because of 
the high likelihood of a cure, recent clinical trials 
have concentrated on trying to moderate the side 
effects of treatment, and these are particularly 
important in limiting neurological toxicity, such 
as the effects upon intelligence, personality and 
pituitary function, and the effects on growth and 
fertility. 
 New  t reatment 
 In many ways, the future is  ‘ here and now ’ for leu-
kaemia. The treatment of CML has recently been 
transformed by the development of imatinib. 
Imatinib binds to the BCR - ABL protein, inhibiting 
 With recovery of the marrow, a further bone 
marrow examination is carried out. The majority 
of patients will have entered complete remission 
just before the second course of chemotherapy. 
Generally, four to six cycles of treatment are given 
in all, and this may be followed by post - remission 
treatment using an allogenic autologous stem cell 
transplant. These approaches are used in younger 
patients who have entered their ﬁ rst remission. 
Approximately 50 – 55% of patients who receive a 
transplant will be cured, but there is no evidence of 
better survival after transplantation in the good -
 prognosis patients. 
 The management of patients in transplant pro-
grammes is, of course, highly specialized, and 
medical training is focused on the recognition of 
the problems associated with profound and pro-
longed immunosuppression. The management of 
transplant patients has completely changed in 
recent years, because of the availability of recom-
binant growth factors. The use of granulocyte col-
ony - stimulating factor (G - CSF) in transplant 
programmes has reduced the period of profound 
neutropenia such that the average duration of stay 
on a transplant ward has decreased from 28 to 17 
days. 
 The management of chronic phase CML has 
evolved over the years from the use of single - agent 
alkylating agents, such as busulfan and hydroxyu-
rea, to the use of interferon alpha and then alloge-
neic stem cell transplantation. Real hopes of cure 
came with the application of transplant pro-
grammes to CML. In the last few years, the intro-
duction of imatinib (Glevec), a novel compound 
that acts to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of 
the BCR - ABL oncoprotein, has been most encour-
aging. Between 80% and 90% of patients respond 
to imatinib. In about half of these responding 
patients, a cytogenic response is also seen. There 
have been no serious adverse side effects from 
treatment with this agent, which offers a dramatic 
improvement over conventional therapy. Unfor-
tunately, late relapses do occur, although at present 
we do not know the median duration of response. 
 CLL may be an entirely indolent disease with an 
excellent prognosis, and for many patients treat-
ment may not be necessary. Therapy, when it is

(GVHD), which is associated with a signiﬁ cant 
morbidity and mortality rate. New drugs to sup-
press GVHD have been developed over the last 
decade including sirolimus, tacrolimus and myco-
phenolate. Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, 
was ﬁ rst discovered as a product of the bacterium 
 Streptomyces hygroscopicus  in a soil sample from 
Rapa Nui, one of the Easter Islands. Both sirolimus 
and tacrolimus inhibit mTOR (mammalian target 
of rapamycin), which is a cellular protein kinase 
that acts as a common step in many signal trans-
duction pathways. 
 There have been major advances in cytogenetics 
and molecular biology, and these have been 
applied to leukaemia and are a signiﬁ cant aid to 
diagnosis, and deﬁ ne prognosis. One of the chal-
lenges in this area is in deﬁ ning new markers for 
AML, where 50% of patients lack a characteristic

its kinase activity and effectively controlling 
disease driven by this kinase. Remissions in CML 
are seen with clearance of the Philadelphia chro-
mosome, as shown by cytogenetic analysis. Imat-
inib resistance emerges as a consequence of 
mutations in the kinase domains of BCR - ABL and 
new inhibitors including dasatinib and nilotinib, 
which are more potent, may overcome imatinib 
resistance. In other leukaemias where there is a 
major genetic base, such as those arising in the 
context of Fanconi ’ s anaemia, haematopoietic 
stem cells using target effectors may offer hope for 
cure. Haematological malignancies offer a solid 
chance for targeted delivery of molecular thera-
pies, with the possibility that naked DNA strategies 
or interfering mRNA therapeutic approaches may 
reach their target and help us cure leukaemia. 
 One of the major complications of transplanta-
tion is the development of graft versus host disease

Hodgkin ’ s  d isease 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Hodgkin ’ s disease is a relatively uncommon tu -
mour, affecting approximately 1600 people each 
year in UK. Currently, there are about 310 deaths 
annually, including, in 2002, the original Albus 
Dumbledore actor Richard Harris. More men than 
women present with Hodgkin ’ s disease, and there 
is a bimodal age distribution with peaks in the 
third and seventh decades. Little is known of the 
risk factors for the development of Hodgkin ’ s 
disease, although there are minor associations with 
Down ’ s syndrome and smoking. Geographical 
clustering has been noted, and there have been a 
few familial cases of Hodgkin ’ s disease. Hodgkin ’ s 
disease is also associated with sarcoidosis. The 
Epstein – Barr virus (EBV) genome is found incorpo-
rated within Reed – Sternberg cells, but we do not 
know for certain whether this virus is a causal 
agent for Hodgkin ’ s disease. The Reed – Sternberg 
cell is pathognomonic for the diagnosis of Hodg-
kin ’ s lymphoma and is thought to originate from 
lymphocytes affected by EBV. In HIV there is a ten -
 fold increase in Hodgkin ’ s disease. There is signiﬁ -
cant interest in the origins of the Reed – Sternberg 
cells, which are large cells with multinucleated or 
bilobed nuclei that according to histopathologists 
look like owl ’ s eyes (Figure  35.1 ). Reed – Sternberg 
cells have a speciﬁ c immunophenotype, express-
ing CD15 and CD30, but not expressing CD20 
or CD45. Immunoglobulin gene expression is 
mutated within Reed – Sternberg cells, and there are 
functional rearrangements that lead to abnormal 
immune function. This leads to defective apopto-
sis, prolonged B - cell survival and, ultimately, to 
the development of Hodgkin ’ s disease. EBV pro-
teins remain present in about 40% of Reed – Stern-
berg cells and there is a three - fold increased risk of 
Hodgkin ’ s disease following infectious mononucl-
eosis (glandular fever). This possibly suggests that 
EBV is a future target for immunotherapy.  
 Presentation 
 The presentation of Hodgkin ’ s disease is usually 
with enlarged lymph nodes. This is generally pain-
less and may be accompanied by constitutional 
symptoms that include profound sweating, sufﬁ -
cient to drench bedclothes, fevers greater than 
38 ° C and weight loss exceeding 10% of body mass. 
These constitutional symptoms are prognostically 
important. There are other non - speciﬁ c symptoms 
relating to the presentation of Hodgkin ’ s disease, 
including alcohol - related pain and skin itching.  
 Investigations 
 In clinic, a careful history should be obtained and 
an examination made. Investigations will be 
organized which include a full blood count and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), liver and

doned as an investigative tool, and the saga of the 
downside to staging diagnostic splenectomy con-
tinues to this day. It includes an ever - enlarging list 
of infection susceptibilities for which antibiotic 
therapy and immunization are recommended.  
 Pathology  
 Four different histological variants of Hodgkin ’ s 
disease are described: nodular sclerosing, mixed 
cellularity, lymphocyte - predominant and lym-
phocyte - depleted Hodgkin ’ s disease. Nodular scle-
rosing Hodgkin ’ s disease is subclassiﬁ ed as grade I 
or II. Lymphocyte - predominant Hodgkin ’ s disease 
is rare, constituting less than 5% of all histological 
phenotypes. The nodular sclerosing variant occurs 
in about 70% of all cases and is even more common 
in Hodgkin ’ s disease affecting young women. The 
mixed cellularity variant is commonly associated 
with HIV - related malignancy and will often be 
diagnosed in infradiaphragmatic presentations of 
Hodgkin ’ s disease.  
 Staging 
 The results of the staging investigations will 
help the clinician to determine the clinical stage of 
renal function tests, a chest X - ray, CT scan of the 
chest and abdomen, bone marrow aspiration and 
trephine biopsy. The patient will be reviewed in 
outpatients with the results of these tests. Admis-
sion will then be organized for a biopsy of the 
lymph glands. The purpose of these investigations 
is to deﬁ ne the clinical stage of the disease and the 
purpose of the biopsy to make a histological diag-
nosis. The examination of bone marrow is com-
monly undertaken in the investigation of patients 
with Hodgkin ’ s disease. Less than 5% of men and 
women with Hodgkin ’ s disease have bone marrow 
involvement, however, and this is generally only 
present in patients with advanced tumours of 
stages greater than IIB. There are strong arguments 
against carrying out this assessment except in 
advanced - stage patients. 
 The investigation of Hodgkin ’ s disease is a reca-
pitulation of the history of imaging in the UK. 
Plain X - rays (Figure  35.2 ) remain helpful, but 
approaches such as lymphography have been 
replaced by CT and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). There are signiﬁ cant errors in the accuracy 
of both CT and MRI in deﬁ ning hepatic and splenic 
involvement, with an error rate of up to 60% in the 
speciﬁ city for indicating involvement by lym-
phoma. Staging laparotomy has long been aban-

steroids. It is invariably accompanied by loss of 
saliva production and oesophagitis. Infradiaphrag-
matic radiotherapy may be complicated by some 
minor bowel disturbance but generally is well tol-
erated. Radiation is usually avoided in children 
and adolescents as it may lead to gross growth dis-
turbance. Infradiaphragmatic radiation may cause 
sterility. In patients with good - prognosis disease 
the radiation ﬁ elds may be reduced to lower toxic-
ity. Thus extended ﬁ eld or mini - mantle treatments 
may be prescribed in order to reduce radiotherapy 
toxicity. 
 Chemotherapy 
 Combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin ’ s disease 
was introduced in the mid - 1960s. The original 
treatment regimen, which has the acronym MOPP, 
combined mustine, vincristine (Oncovin), pred-
nisone and procarbazine. These drugs are given 
intravenously and orally for two weeks and 
repeated every four weeks. Six cycles are adminis-
tered. Treatment is associated with acute nausea 
and vomiting, sterility in 90% of males and 50% of 
females, and the development of second tumours 
in approximately 5% of patients. 
 Chemotherapy treatments have been modiﬁ ed 
over the years in order to reduce side effects. Six is 
a  ‘ magic number ’ in oncology, and it is possible 
that four cycles of therapy are as effective as six 
cycles. The most frequently used current pro-
gramme is called ABVD which combines adriamy-
cin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. 
These drugs cause neither sterility nor second 
malignancies and are of obvious advantage in a 
disease where there is a high expectation of cure. 
Randomized trials have shown an equivalence of 
ABVD to standard therapy with MOPP and to 
hybrid therapies.  
 Haemopoietic  s tem  c ell  t ransplantation 
 High - dosage chemotherapy with either bone 
marrow transplantation or peripheral blood stem 
cell support is a relatively new and toxic treatment 
for drug - resistant Hodgkin ’ s disease. The most 
commonly applied current programme in the UK 
the Hodgkin ’ s disease, and this in turn deﬁ nes 
treatment. In stage I Hodgkin ’ s disease, one lymph 
node or two contiguous lymph node groups are 
affected. In stage II disease, two non - contiguous 
lymph node groups on the same side of the dia-
phragm are affected. In stage III Hodgkin ’ s disease, 
lymph node groups on both sides of the diaphragm 
are affected. In stage IV disease, there is extranodal 
spread to the liver, lung or bone but rarely to other 
sites. 
 The tumour is further classiﬁ ed as A or B.  ‘ A ’ 
deﬁ nes a lack of constitutional symptoms and  ‘ B ’ 
indicates the presence of the constitutional symp-
toms of Hodgkin ’ s disease. Finally, the staging is 
deﬁ ned by use of the subscript  ‘ S ’ , which indicates 
splenic involvement, or  ‘ E ’ , which deﬁ nes exten-
sion to involve extranodal tissue in direct apposi-
tion to an enlarged lymph node group.  
 Treatment and  s ide  e ffects 
 The purpose of staging is to deﬁ ne treatment 
groups. The current recommendations for treat-
ment are as follows: stage I and IIA Hodgkin ’ s 
disease is generally treated with radiation. The 
exceptions are where there is bulky lymphaden-
opathy or constitutional symptoms. In these 
instances, chemotherapy may be the preferred 
option. Stage IIB – IV disease is usually treated with 
combination chemotherapy. 
 Radiation 
 Radiation treatment is generally given according 
to two well - deﬁ ned treatment plans. Lymphaden-
opathy above the diaphragm is treated with mantle 
radiation which includes the lymph node groups 
in the neck, axillae and chest to a total dosage of 
3500   cGy given over a period of four to six weeks. 
Infradiaphragmatic radiation is generally given in 
the inverted Y distribution that includes the para -
 aortic and iliac nodal groups. Treatment is given to 
a total dosage of 3500   cGy over a four to six - week 
period. 
 Mantle radiotherapy may be complicated by 
radiation pneumonitis, which is characterized by a 
period of breathlessness and fever and responds to

chemotherapy. The solid tumours, such as breast, 
colorectal and lung cancer, occur late, sometimes 
15 – 20 years after diagnosis. Sterility is also an 
important consequence of treatment with any 
alkylating agent - containing regimen, reaching up 
to 80% in males and 50% in females.  
 New  t reatment  
 The most important prospect for Hodgkin ’ s disease 
remains the development of immunization pro-
grammes for EBV. EBV antigens are present in up to 
40% of patients with Hodgkin ’ s disease, and it is 
thought that this herpes virus might be a signiﬁ -
cant cause for the development of this  ‘ B - cell ’ 
malignancy. Vaccination strategies have been 
developed, and it is hoped that these may lead to 
the elimination of a proportion of cases of Hodg-
kin ’ s lymphoma. Other attempts have been made 
to develop cytotoxic lymphocyte - based immuno-
therapy for Hodgkin ’ s disease. They have, however, 
not been successful, because of the facility of EBV 
to use multiple strategies to avoid detection. 
Attempts at immunotherapy have included down-
regulation of immunodominant antigens, together 
with cytokine secretion. 
 Combination chemotherapy regimens using 
hybrid treatment programmes have been investi-
gated for the treatment of advanced Hodgkin ’ s 
disease for the reason that, in this group of patients, 
a signiﬁ cant proportion of patients remain incura-
ble. Although some studies have shown a small 
advantage to such hybrid regimens, the treatment 
carries the disadvantage of increased long - term 
toxicity from the alkylating agent - containing regi-
mens. A recent trial of 850 patients which com-
pared ABVD with MOPP/ABVD has shown an 
identical complete remission and failure - free sur-
vival rate. 
 Where there is predominant CD20 expression, 
there are prospects for treatment with immuno-
therapy directed to this surface antigen, such as 
rituximab, which in a recent study has shown a 
response rate of 86% in a small group of patients.  
 
uses  ‘ mini - BEAM ’  or BEAM chemotherapy. Treat-
ment is accompanied by either peripheral 
blood stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. 
Morbidity is high, and in certain groups, such as 
those pretreated with mediastinal radiotherapy, 
mortality reaches up to 30%. Long - term remissions 
occur in up to 40% of patients. The rationale for 
ﬁ rst - line treatment with high - dose chemotherapy 
and bone marrow product support is absent. There 
are no randomized trials comparing such treat-
ment programmes with conventional approaches 
for ﬁ rst - line treatment of Hodgkin ’ s disease.  
 Prognosis 
 The results of treatment of Hodgkin ’ s disease are 
considered to be one of the miracles of modern 
oncology, in that approximately 90% of patients 
with small - volume, early - stage disease are curable 
with radiation and between 40% and 60% of 
patients with advanced disease are curable with 
chemotherapy. A poorer prognosis results from the 
presence of bulk disease, constitutional symptoms 
or poor - prognosis histology. The patient who is 
 ‘ cured ’ as a result of treatment is unfortunately at 
risk from late relapse; this may occur 15 – 30 years 
after diagnosis. This risk of a late relapse is small 
and largely conﬁ ned to lymphocyte - predominant 
Hodgkin ’ s disease.  
 Complications of  c hemotherapy 
 Hodgkin ’ s disease is a tumour with signiﬁ cant cure 
rates, occurring in young people with an expecta-
tion of prolonged survival. This leads to a signiﬁ -
cant onus for providing a therapy that is without 
major long - term toxicity. Conventional chemo-
therapy and radiotherapy for Hodgkin ’ s disease 
using alkylating agents is associated with the 
development of second tumours. The incidence of 
second tumours reaches approximately 5%, with 
staggering increases in the rates of acute leukae-
mias and lymphomas. The leukaemias present 
early, two to four years after the completion of

Non - Hodgkin ’ s  l ymphoma 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma is relatively common. 
In the UK there are just over 4500 deaths each year 
and 10  500 patients presenting with this condi-
tion. There have been many descriptions of the 
pathological classiﬁ cation of this disease. Rather 
than achieving clarity, however, most have tended 
to confuse the situation further because of their 
complexity. In terms of clinical practice, the most 
signiﬁ cant divisions are into high - and low - grade 
lymphoma. 
 High - grade lymphoma is much more common 
than low - grade lymphoma. About 1000 people 
with low - grade lymphoma present each year. 
Slightly more men are affected than women. Lym-
phomas arise from lymphoid organs or lymphatic 
tissue associated with other systems that contain 
lymphatic tissue. The latter, the so - called  ‘ extran-
odal lymphomas ’ , constitute up to 30% of all non -
 Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma. 
 There have been extraordinary advances in the 
molecular biology of lymphoma, and from this we 
have begun to understand some of the aetiological 
features involved in this condition. It is thought 
that Epstein – Barr virus infection is linked to the 
development of African Burkitt ’ s lymphoma, 
certain other B - cell lymphomas, HIV - associated 
lymphomas and almost all lymphomas associated 
with the immunosuppression consequent to the 
transplantation of heart, kidneys and lung. 
 The human T - cell leukaemia lymphoma virus 
type 1 (HTLV - 1) causes adult T - cell lymphoma and 
leukaemia and both are endemic in the Caribbean 
and Japan. Other viruses associated with the devel-
opment of lymphoma include hepatitis C and 
human herpesvirus 8 (HHV - 8).  Helicobacter infec-
tion in the stomach leads to a proliferation of 
gastric lymphoid tissue and the development of 
low - grade 
mucosa - associated 
tumours. 
Such 
tumours may respond to  H. pylori  eradication treat-
ment, but unfortunately they may evolve into clas-
sical lymphoma despite eradication.  
 Presentation 
 Patients present with nodal enlargement which 
may be accompanied by constitutional symptoms 
including weight loss, sweating and fever. These 
symptoms  – where weight loss is in excess of 10% 
of pre - morbid weight, sweating is sufﬁ cient to 
drench night clothes, and fever exceeds 38 ° C  – 
are described as  ‘ B ’ symptoms.  ‘ B ’ symptoms are 
less common in high - grade lymphoma than low -
 grade malignancies. Patients with such symptoms 
should be referred to specialist centres where the 
chance for survival and the quality of survival are 
signiﬁ cantly better than in peripheral non -

specialist centres. The care of patients with lym-
phoma should be by oncologists or haematologists, 
depending upon the specialist interests of the 
clinicians. 
 Staging and  g rading 
 In outpatients, a careful history is obtained from 
the patient who is then examined. The investiga-
tions organized should include a blood count, 
renal and hepatic function tests, chest X - ray, bone 
marrow aspiration and trephine, and CT scan of 
the abdomen and chest (Figures  36.1 – 36.4 ). These 
investigations are done in order to deﬁ ne the 
extent of the disease. From these investigations the 
clinical staging is obtained. This is deﬁ ned as 
follows: 
  ●    Stage I: disease conﬁ ned to one lymph node or 
two contiguous lymph node groups  
  ●    Stage II: disease on one side of the diaphragm in 
lymph node groups that are separate  
  ●    Stage III: disease on both sides of the diaphragm  
  ●    Stage IV: extranodal spread of the lymphoma.  
 Preliminary investigations having been organ-
ized, the patient should then proceed to a lymph 
node biopsy. Lymph node biopsies used to be 
required to describe the architectural arrangement 
of the tumour. In modern times, they are no longer

always considered to be necessary. Sufﬁ cient mate-
rial can often be obtained from core needle biop-
sies to deﬁ ne the pathological diagnosis. There are 
many classiﬁ cation systems for non - Hodgkin ’ s 
lymphoma, which include the WHO classiﬁ cation 
(Table  36.1 ), the Kiel classiﬁ cation, the Working 
Formulation and the Revised European and Ameri-
can Lymphoma Classiﬁ cation (REAL).  
 For the purposes of deﬁ ning treatment, the most 
practical classiﬁ cation, however, is to describe the 
tumour as being low or high grade. A low - grade 
tumour tends to have a follicular nature and to 
contain relatively inactive cells. A high - grade 
tumour contains cells that have a high index of 
mitotic activity and there is no follicular structure 
to the lymph node. An intermediate - grade tumour, 
which generally behaves clinically like a high - grade 
tumour, has some of the features of both high - and 
low - grade tumours. There are variant lymphomas, 
such as mantle cell and Burkitt ’ s lymphomas, 
which are clinical entities with poor prognosis. 
 Many modern techniques have been applied to 
the pathological diagnosis of lymphoma. Immu-
nophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies is 
the most helpful, ﬁ rstly, in initially distinguishing 
between a lymphoma or a carcinoma by using anti-
bodies to the leukocyte common antigen (CD45), 
and secondly, in deﬁ ning the lymphoma by using 
antibodies that are speciﬁ c for B or T lymphocytes, 
such as CD20 or CD4, CD2 and CD3. T - cell recep-
tor and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements are 
also carried out, and are helpful in describing 
tumour clonality. Fluorescent  in situ  hybridization 
is also useful. This is because of the observed 
cytogenetic abnormalities that are relatively spe-
ciﬁ c for non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma. Some of these 
are outlined in Table  36.2 . 
 Treatment 
 Low - g rade  n on - Hodgkin ’ s  l ymphoma 
 Low - grade tumours are generally disseminated at 
diagnosis. If they are localized, that is stage I, small 
bulk, peripheral and without B symptoms, the 
treatment should be radiotherapy. For stage II – IV 
disease, treatment is with chemotherapy with oral 
alkylating agents such as chlorambucil or with an 
intravenous chemotherapy programme known as 
CVP which uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine 
and prednisone. Chlorambucil has very little early 
toxicity but at high total dosages causes sterility, 
secondary myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute mye-
loid leukaemia (AML). CVP leads to hair loss, but 
apart from this it is without signiﬁ cant morbidity. 
Both regimens may be associated with marrow tox-
icity which results in admissions with neutropenic

agents. 
 Patients with stage I non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma 
have a 70 – 95% chance of cure with radiotherapy. 
The patient with disseminated low - grade lym-
phoma is not cured by treatment. Although 85% of 
patients achieve a complete response to therapy, 
this response is transient. After a median period of 
18 months, the patient relapses and requires re -
 treatment. The average patient has four such epi-
sodes of response and relapse. Finally after a 
median period of 7.5 years, there is transformation 
to high - grade lymphoma.  
 High - g rade and  i ntermediate - g rade 
 n on - Hodgkin ’ s  l ymphoma 
 Paradoxically, high - grade and intermediate - grade 
lymphomas are more likely to be conﬁ ned to one 
lymph node group than low - grade tumours and 
are curable. Stage I disease may be treated with 
radiotherapy. Some clinicians will then proceed to 
treat with adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with 
small bulk stage I non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma have 
a 95% chance of cure with radiation, and this 
chance is only minimally improved with chemo-
therapy. If the stage I disease is bulky, chemother-
apy alone may be given. Treatment is with the 
R - CHOP regimen, and there is little evidence that 
more complex regimens add to the chance of cure. 
Of all patients, 70 – 80% enter remission, which is 
sustained in about 40 – 60% of cases. CHOP consists 
of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydau-
norubicin), vincristine (oncovin) and prednisolone 
and was introduced in the 1970s. It has remained 
the gold standard therapy for many high - grade 
lymphomas ever since with the addition of rituxi-
mab for CD20 - expressing lymphomas in the 
1990s. In 1993 a pivotal trial compared CHOP with 
several newer chemotherapy regimens with less 
memorable but more exotic names (e.g. m - BACOD, 
ProMACE - CytaBOM, MACOP - B); CHOP emerged 
as the regimen with the least toxicity but similar 
efﬁ cacy.

tions. Immunosuppression is required for patients 
receiving allografts. Prognosis depends on a 
number of risk factors. There is an associated mor-
tality rate to these procedures that may exceed 
10%.

 New  t reatment 
 New agents have become available for the treat-
ment of lymphoma. Amongst the most interesting 
are antibody treatments directed against B - cell 
antigens, such as rituximab. Rituximab is directed 
against CD20 and usually has very little toxicity 
apart from the possibility of a hypersensitivity 
response. It has been used mainly in the treatment 
of recurrent lymphoma. In more recent trials, 
however, rituximab has been prescribed as ﬁ rst -
 line therapy for patients with B - cell lymphomas. 
These trials have been successful, and rituximab in 
combination with chemotherapy is considered to 
be standard ﬁ rst - line treatment for patients with 
B - cell lymphomas. There are other anti - CD20, 
 - CD40 and  - CD8 antibody treatments, which show 
some promise and these have been combined with 
radioisotopes such as iodine - 131. Vaccine trials 
using patient - speciﬁ c immunization with immu-
noglobulin idiotype are also underway. There is 
new hope for lymphoma patients!

Myeloma 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Myeloma is a relatively common haematological 
malignancy affecting 3987 people each year in the 
UK, and leading to 2695 deaths per year. There is 
an equal sex distribution and an increasing inci-
dence with age. The rate of myeloma is higher 
amongst black populations, and the disease is asso-
ciated with industrial and radiation exposure. 
 Multiple myeloma is a B - cell neoplasm charac-
terized by the proliferation of plasma cells that 
synthesize and secrete monoclonal immunoglobu-
lins or fragments thereof. The molecular basis of 
the transformation that characterizes this tumour 
is not clearly known. Karyotypic abnormalities 
have been identiﬁ ed in up to 50% of myeloma 
patients, but there is no clear, unifying change that 
underlies this transformation. Several molecular 
events have been described. These involve 14q32 
translocations, chromosome 13 deletion and 
ﬁ broblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) activa-
tion. These abnormalities are seen in no more than 
20% of all myeloma patients. The translocations 
that have been described mostly involve the switch 
rearrangements of the heavy chain locus with 
partner genes such as FGFR3. Mutations have been 
observed in tumour suppressor genes and abnor-
malities of expression in apoptosis - related genes 
such as BCL - 2. T cells secrete interleukin 6 (IL - 6), 
which appears to be an essential growth factor for 
myeloma cells in culture. Excessive secretion of 
IL - 6 occurs in myeloma and this may be a primary 
cause for the condition. 
 The destructive bone lesions that are seen in 
myeloma are thought to be due to dysregulation of 
the osteoprotegerin Rankl system. Rankl is the 
ligand for osteoprotegerin and is relaeased in 
myeloma by the malignant plasma cells and bone 
marrow stroma, leading to osteoclast activation 
and hence osteolysis. The osteolytic bone lesions 
of myeloma are best seen on plain X - rays rather 
than bone scans as they generally lack osteoblastic 
activity. They appear as punched - out lesions, 
including the classical  ‘ pepper pot ’ appearance of 
the skull X - ray, and the bone breakdown releases 
calcium and may cause hypercalcaemia.  
 Presentation 
 Patients with myeloma often present in a dramatic 
fashion with signiﬁ cant bone pain due to the lytic 
lesions that characterize this disease (Figure  37.1 ). 
Vertebral collapse is often a feature of presenta-
tion, and this may lead to symptoms of cord com-
pression. Patients with myeloma may present with 
symptoms of hypercalcaemia, which every medical 
student reading this chapter is able to describe. 
Hypercalcaemia can be one of the precipitating 
factors for renal failure commonly observed in 
myeloma. The other causes include amyloidosis

(AL amyloid containing immunoglobulin light 
chains), precipitation of Bence – Jones protein 
(urinary free light chain papprotein), direct inﬁ l-
tration and infection. An excess of immunoglobu-
lin may cause the hyperviscosity syndrome, which 
is more common with an IgG myeloma than an 
IgM myeloma. This is explained by the fact that a 
far greater proportion of patients have IgG than 
have IgM myelomas, which represents just 0.5% of 
all myeloma cases.  
 The raised paraprotein levels may cause other 
problems, including peripheral neuropathy. Mar-
row inﬁ ltration with an excess of plasma cells 
leads to a decrease in numbers of other marrow 
constituents, causing anaemia, thrombocytopenia 
and neutropenia. This in turn has consequences 
for both the presentation and the clinical features 
of the disease as it evolves.  
 Investigations 
 The investigation of myeloma is relatively simple. 
It requires the examination of the peripheral 
blood, paraprotein levels, blood count,  β 2 -

Myeloma Chapter 37
207
 microglobulin levels, renal function and calcium 
levels (see Plates  37.1  and  37.2 ), assessment of the 
bone marrow, examination of the urine for Bence –
 Jones protein urea and a skeletal survey. Bone scan-
ning is of low diagnostic value in myeloma. 
Myeloma is staged, and the staging has prognostic 
value (Table  37.1 ). Two systems are used, that of 
Durie and Salmon and that of the Medical Research 
Council (MRC) (Tables  37.2  and  37.3 ). 
 Treatment 
 The initial treatment of myeloma requires stabili-
zation of the patient and correction of renal func-
tion abnormalities and hypercalcaemia (Table 
 37.4 ). The patient is started on allopurinol and 
may require hydration or transfusion. Hypercal-
caemia is treated with bisphosphonates, steroids 
and rehydration. Where there is signiﬁ cant bone 
pain, which is poorly responsive to opiates, 
radiotherapy may be required. A single fraction 
treatment will alleviate bone pain in approxi-
mately 80% of patients. Anaemia may require 
transfusion and signiﬁ cant hyperviscosity needs 
plasmaphoresis. 
 Chemotherapy for myeloma has a 50 - year 
history, beginning with the use of alkylating agents 
such as melphalan and cyclosphosphamide. Now-
adays, the initial treatment of multiple myeloma 
depends on the patient ’ s age and co - morbidities. 
High - dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation has become the preferred 
treatment for patients under the age of 65. Prior to 
stem cell transplantation, these patients receive an 
initial course of induction chemotherapy. The

 Table 37.4   Southwest Oncology Group myeloma response criteria. 
 A.   Responsive patients who satisfy all the following criteria are considered to have achieved deﬁ nite objective 
improvement: 
 1.  A sustained decrease in the synthesis index of serum monoclonal protein to 25% or less of the pre - treatment 
value, and to less than 25   g/l on at least two measurements separated by 4 weeks. For IgA and Ig 3 M proteins, the 
synthetic index is the same as the serum concentration. For IgG proteins of subclasses 1, 2 and 4, the synthetic 
index must be estimated using a nomogram  
 2.  A sustained decrease in 24 - hour urine globulin to 10% or less of the pre - treatment value, and to less than 
0.2 g/24 hours on at least two occasions separated by 4 weeks  
 3.  In all responsive patients the size and number of lytic skull lesions must not increase, and the serum calcium 
must remain normal. Correction of anaemia (haematocrit  > 27   vol%) and hypoalbuminaemia ( > 3.0  g/dl) is required 
if they are considered to be secondary to myeloma. With equivocal data (e.g. non - secretors or  L - chain producers for 
whom the pre - treatment urine collection was lost), the following two points support the conclusion that an 
objective response has occurred  
 4.  Recalciﬁ cation of lytic skull lesions  
 5.  Signiﬁ cant increments in depressed normal immunoglobulins (e.g. increments  > 200   mg/l IgM,  > 400   mg/l IgA, 
and  > 4000  mg/l IgG)  
 B.   Improved patients show a decline in the serum M protein synthesis rate to less than 50%, but not less than 25%, 
of the pre - treatment value  
 C.    Unresponsive patients fail to satisfy the criteria for responsive or improved patients  
patients and here the standard of care has been 
chemotherapy with melphalan and prednisone. 
Bortezomib and lenalidomide are suitable treat-
ments at relapse. Bortezomib inhibits proteosome, 
the cellular organelles that identify tagged proteins 
in the cytoplasm, and breaks them down. It is not 
quite clear how thalidomide and lenalidomide 
work but they seem to have both immunomodula-
tory and anti - angiogenic actions. Both are potent 
teratogens and it is essential that they are not pre-
scribed to women who could become pregnant.  
 New  t reatment 
 Because myeloma is a clonal disease that expresses 
a unique surface immunoglobulin, it was thought 
possible that patients might mount an immune 
defense against these myeloma cells if they were 
somehow used as a vaccine. Myeloma cell/den-
dritic cell fusions have been examined as a vaccina-
tion strategy for multiple myeloma and have been 
found to induce myeloma - speciﬁ c cell death. Simi-
larly, antisense oligonucleotides have been shown 
to have some efﬁ cacy in patients with recurrent 
myeloma.  In vitro , IL - 6 causes the proliferation of 
myeloma cells, and a monoclonal antibody that 
blocks the IL - 6 receptor is being used in trials as 
treatment for myeloma.

Skin  c ancer 
 Cinema has wide - ranging inﬂ uence on fashion 
trends and one of the most striking examples was 
the mid - 20th century trend towards sun tanning. 
The fashion of the Victorian era was sun avoid-
ance; the upper classes stayed pale in part to distin-
guish themselves from lower class workers who 
had to toil in the sun. Yet by the 1950s, the beach 
culture of southern California spread worldwide 
via the movies. The ill effects of chronic exposure 
to ultraviolet radiation on skin ageing are well 
demonstrated by Clint Eastwood. The carcino-
genic effects of sunlight led to the removal of a 
basal cell carcinoma from the former actor, US 
President Ronald Reagan, whilst his eldest daugh-
ter Maureen Reagan died of melanoma. 
 The following two chapters discuss both non -
 melanoma skin tumours and melanomas.

 Chapter 39 
Non - m elanoma  s kin  t umours 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Non - melanoma skin cancers probably comprise 
more than one - third of all cancers in the UK and 
have been described as a worldwide epidemic. The 
term includes two major types: basal cell carci-
noma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 
Other less common non - melanoma skin cancers 
include Kaposi ’ s sarcoma, cutaneous lymphoma 
and Merkel cell carcinoma. Despite their fre-
quency, these tumours account for only 2% of 
cancer deaths. 
 BCC is four times more common than SCC. Sun 
damage is the major cause of both cancers, espe-
cially the ultraviolet B (UVB) spectrum (290 –
 320   nm wavelength). The UV radiation produces 
DNA mutations, particularly thymidine dimers in 
the p53 tumour suppressor gene. The incidence of 
skin cancer rises with latitudes approaching the 
equator. Light - exposed areas of the body are the 
most frequent sites for tumours, and occupations 
with high sun exposure like farming have an 
increased incidence of BCC and SCC. Ozone 
absorbs UVB, and progressive destruction of the 
ozone layer by ﬂ uorinated hydrocarbons may lead 
to increased rates. Melanin absorbs UV light, and 
its lower levels in melanocytes of white people 
accounts for the higher incidence of skin cancers 
in white people. The beneﬁ ts of melanin in areas of 
high UV exposure are offset against the reduced 
production of vitamin D3, which requires UV 
light, so in regions of low sunlight, black people are 
prone to rickets. This delicately balanced system of 
biological geodiversity has been abused to justify 
some of the most inhumane behaviour. Genetic 
predispositions to skin cancers include xeroderma 
pigmentosum, Gorlin ’ s basal cell naevus syndrome 
and familial melanoma syndromes. Patients with 
xeroderma pigmentosa are unable to repair the 
UV - induced DNA damage and develop both BCC 
and SCC under the age of 10 years old. Gorlin ’ s 
basal cell naevus syndrome patients develop BCC 
in their teens and brain tumours later in life; it is 
caused by a mutation of a patched gene involved in 
the Hedgehog pathway signal transduction. The 
gene name  Hedgehog was originally coined because 
mutations lead to spikes on  Drosophila  fruit ﬂ ies. 
Humans have three homologues of the gene 
named after the two common varieties of hedge-
hogs,  ‘ Indian ’ and  ‘ Desert ’ . The third human gene 
was named  Sonic  after Sega ’ s game character. 
Familial melanoma is caused by inherited muta-
tions of the CDKN2 (p16) gene (chromosome 
9p21) and of CDK4 (chromosome 12q13), both 
implicated in insensitivity to cell cycle check-
points. Chemical carcinogens, including arsenic, 
are associated with SCC. Sir Percival Pott ’ s descrip-
tion in 1775 of scrotal cancers in chimney sweeps

is thought to be due to industrial exposure to coal 
tar. Radiation is associated with an increased inci-
dence of SCC, BCC and Bowen ’ s disease (SCC  in 
situ ). Allogeneic organ transplant recipients are at 
greatly increased risk of SCC, with as many as 80% 
having SCC within 20 years of the graft. This may 
be related to the ﬁ nding of genotypes ﬁ ve and 
eight of human papillomavirus in some skin SCC.  
 Presentation 
 BCC begins in the basal cell layer of the epidermis, 
usually develops on chronically sun - exposed areas 
of the skin, rarely metastasizes, and is usually slow 
growing. If left untreated, however, BCC may 
spread locally to the bone or other tissues beneath 
the skin. BCC starts as painless, translucent, pearly 
nodules with telangiectasia on sun - exposed skin. 
As they enlarge, they ulcerate and bleed and 
develop a rolled shiny edge sometimes referred to 
as a  ‘ rodent ulcer ’ (see Plate  39.1 ). They may 
progress slowly over many months to years, but 
less than 0.1% metastasize to regional lymph 
nodes. They occur mostly on the face, especially 
the nose, nasolabial fold and inner canthus, 
usually in elderly people and are more common in 
men than in women. 
 SCC arises from more superﬁ cial layers of the 
epidermis and tends to be more aggressive. SCC 
can invade tissues beneath the skin and 1 – 2% 
spread to the lymph nodes. These cancers typically 
appear on sun - exposed areas of the body, such as 
the face, ears, neck, lips and backs of the hands (see 
Plate  39.2 ). Marjolin ulcers are SCCs arising in 
long - standing, benign ulcers, such as venous 
ulcers, or scars, such as old burns. SCCs are irregu-
lar, red hyperkeratotic tumours that ulcerate and 
crust. Unlike BCCs, SCCs grow more rapidly over 
months rather than years and occasionally bleed. 
Precursors to SCC include actinic keratosis and 
SCC  in situ , which is also called Bowen ’ s disease. 
SCC  in situ  is a full - thickness malignant transfor-
mation of the epidermis that, by deﬁ nition, has 
not invaded the dermis. 
 Merkel cell carcinoma is a highly malignant 
tumour in the basal layer of the epidermis, most 
commonly found in elderly, white patients. It con-
sists of rapidly growing, painless and shiny purple 
nodules that may occur anywhere on the body. 
These tumours are thought to arise from neuroen-
docrine cells and are positive for neuron - speciﬁ c 
enolase staining. They resemble small cell lung 
cancer in their clinical course. In 2008, a polyoma-
virus (Merkel cell polyomavirus, MCV) was identi-
ﬁ ed in most of these tumours and represents the 
ﬁ rst of a new class of human oncogenic viruses. 
Max Perutz, who won the Nobel Prize for his work 
on crystallography and who was Watson and 
Crick ’ s PhD supervisor whilst they were discover-
ing the structure of DNA, died of Merkel cell 
tumour. Distant metastases are common, and 
treatment is with combination chemotherapy, 
although relapses are frequent and the prognosis is 
poor. Other, rarer non - melanoma skin cancers 
include Kaposi ’ s sarcoma, which usually starts 
within the dermis but can also develop in internal 
organs. This cancer, once extremely rare, has 
become more common due to its association with 
HIV/AIDS. It is caused by infection with an onco-
genic herpesvirus, HHV8 (human herpesvirus 8). 
Primary cutaneous lymphoma or mycosis fun-
goides is a low - grade lymphoma that primarily 
affects the skin. Generally, it has a slow course and 
often remains conﬁ ned to the skin, but progression 
of the tumour to a more aggressive, life - threaten-
ing stage is more likely the longer it has been 
present. Adnexal tumours, which start in the hair 
follicles or sweat glands, are extremely rare and 
usually benign.  
 Treatment 
 The goal of treatment for BCC and SCC is to eradi-
cate local disease and achieve the best cosmetic 
appearance. For BCC, a complete skin examination 
is indicated because of the increased risk of actinic 
keratosis or cancers located at other skin sites in 
persons presenting with a suspicious lesion. For 
SCC, regional lymph nodes should also be exam-
ined. The main options include: (i) surgery, which 
offers a single brief procedure and histological con-
ﬁ rmation of completeness of excision; (ii) curet-
tage, which is suitable for small, nodular lesions of 
less than 1   cm and yields good cosmesis; and (iii) 

Chapter 39 Non-melanoma skin tumours
212
cryotherapy, which can be used for lesions of less 
than 2  cm but may leave an area of depigmenta-
tion, and radiotherapy. Mohs ’ micrographic 
surgery is a specialized form of excisional surgery 
that provides 100% microscopically controlled his-
tological margins. The technique involves tumour 
excision, mapping of the removed tissue and 
immediate microscopic assessment of the surgical 
specimen. If occult tumour extension is detected 
microscopically, the process is repeated until a 
tumour - free margin is attained. Frederick Mohs 
developed this surgical approach whilst still a 
medical student and, according to at least one of 
our surgical colleagues, it is analogous to peeling 
rather than chopping a vegetable. Mohs ’ surgery is 
curative for 99% of primary BCCs and for 97% of 
primary SCCs, the highest documented cure rates. 
Radiotherapy has the advantages of no pain, no 
hospitalization and no keloids or contracture; it 
preserves uninvolved tissue and produces smaller 
defects. It does, however, require multiple visits 
and results in depigmentation and loss of hair fol-
licles and sweat glands at the treated site. The deci-
sion between surgery and radiotherapy is based on 
size and site, histology, age of patient, recurrence 
rates and anticipated cosmetic results. Topical 
5 - ﬂ uorouracil chemotherapy may be used for 
actinic keratosis and small, superﬁ cial, non - inva-
sive tumours. Side effects include progressive 
inﬂ ammation, erythema, erosions and contact 
dermatitis. Systemic chemotherapy is reserved for 
treating locally advanced and metastatic disease. 
The most widely used regimens include cisplatin in 
combination with 5 - ﬂ uorouracil or doxorubicin. 
 Prevention remains the most important aspect 
of the management of skin cancers and requires 
campaigns to increase public awareness. Children 
should not get sunburnt, and white - skinned 
people should limit their total cumulative sun 
exposure. The public should be encouraged to look 
out for new skin lesions, and those that are not 
obviously benign should be seen and removed in 
their entirety for pathological examination within 
four weeks.

with non - melanoma skin tumours is given in Table

Melanoma 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Melanoma is a tumour of melanocytes: the pig-
mented cells of the skin. The incidence of 
melanoma has increased by a factor of 4 since 
1971. More than 10   000 people were diagnosed 
with melanoma in the UK in 2006. The primary 
cause is thought to be an increase in exposure to 
sunlight. Risk factors for the development of 
melanoma, however, include being Caucasian and 
having dysplastic naevi or familial melanoma. It is 
encouraging to note that recently there has been a 
stabilization of the increase in melanoma inci-
dence. One hopes that with all the publicity, the 
risks of exposure to sun are at last entering into the 
public consciousness. 
 Less than 10% of all melanoma cases constitute 
families with an inherited predisposition to 
melanoma. Mutations in two genes, CDKN2A and 
CDK4, have been shown to confer increased risk of 
melanoma, but these mutations only constitute 
about one - ﬁ fth of all familial cases. The melano-
cortin receptor gene,  MC1R , inﬂ uences skin pig-
mentation and polymorphisms in this gene are 
linked to an increased risk of melanoma. In other 
families, there is linkage around the 1p22 chromo-
somal region. Loss of the transcription factor AP - 2 
is also thought to have some tumour suppressor -
 like role in melanoma progression.  
 Presentation 
 Patients with malignant melanoma generally 
present with a history of a growing mole, which 
may bleed or itch (see Plates  40.1  and  40.2 ). Because 
of the public awareness of melanoma, generally 
there is quite rapid self - referral to GPs with these 
symptoms. Specialist referral to plastic surgery or 
dermatology is also quick, and many hospitals now 
offer walk - in skin lesion clinics. In clinic, the spe-
cialist will on initial examination seek to conﬁ rm 
the diagnosis. If there is no evidence for metas-
tases, he will make arrangements to excise the 
primary lesion. This proceedure requires specialist 
surgery with wide excision of the surrounding 
normal tissue. The reasons for this are, ﬁ rstly, con-
cerns about the incidence of local recurrence fol-
lowing inadequate resection (see Plates  40.3  and 
 40.4 ) and, secondly, the need for good cosmesis. 
Although wide excision is practised, there is no 
evidence from a randomized trial that supports 
this practice.  
 Staging and  g rading 
 There are four main clinical descriptions of 
melanoma and these are the superﬁ cial spreading, 
nodular, lentigo maligna and acral lentiginous 
subtypes (Table  40.1 ).

 Following excision and conﬁ rmation of the diag-
nosis histologically, staging investigations, which 
should include CT scanning, should be performed. 
As a result of surgery and staging procedures, the 
clinical stage can be deﬁ ned as follows: 
  ●    Stage 1a: localized melanoma less than 0.75   mm 
thick 
  ●    Stage 1b: localized melanoma 0.76 – 1.5  mm thick  
  ●    Stage 2a: localized melanoma 1.6 – 4  mm thick  
  ●    Stage 2b: localized melanoma greater than 4   mm 
thick 
  ●    Stage 3: limited nodal metastases involving only 
one regional lymph node group  
  ●    Stage 4: advanced regional metastases or distant 
metastases. 
 There are additional, widely practised staging 
systems, which are not included in this book. For 
prognostic 
purposes, 
however, 
pathological 
staging is signiﬁ cant and includes the Breslow 
thickness and Clark ’ s levels: 
  ●    Clark ’ s level I: melanoma conﬁ ned to the 
epidermis 
  ●    Clark ’ s level II: penetration into the papillary 
dermis 
  ●    Clark ’ s level III: extension to the reticular dermis  
  ●    Clark ’ s level IV: extension into the deep reticular 
dermis 
  ●    Clark ’ s level V: invasion of the subcutaneous fat.  
 Breslow ’ s staging system measures the vertical 
thickness of the primary tumour, grouping mel-
anomas into  ‘ Breslow ’ s thickness ’ , as less then 
0.75   mm, 0.76 – 1.5  mm, 1.51 – 3.99   mm and greater 
than 4   mm. 
 Treatment 
 Adjuvant  t herapy 
 There have been many studies of the use of adju-
vant immunotherapy in melanoma. Adjuvant 
immunotherapy using the interferons has led to 
some conﬂ icting ﬁ ndings. Some studies have been 
positive and others not. In patients with poor -
 prognosis melanoma the consensus now is that 
treatment with adjuvant interferons may have a 
slight survival beneﬁ t. Cancer vaccines have been 
developed, 
enhancing 
antitumour 
immune 
responses, and in some recent studies prolonged 
survival has been reported. Treatment with adju-
vant chemotherapy has largely been without any 
beneﬁ t at all and has produced remarkable levels of 
toxicities without any effect.  
 Management of  l ocal  s kin  m etastases 
and  n odal  d isease 
 The treatment of this pattern of relapse is primarily 
surgical. Localized recurrence is excised and nodal 
metastases are managed by radical lymph node dis-
section. There are advocates of regional infusional 
programmes using cytotoxic chemotherapy, but 
the value of this is contentious. Radiotherapy may 

Melanoma Chapter 40
215
be used where localized disease is inoperable or as 
an adjuvant to surgery, reducing the bulk of disease 
prior to deﬁ nitive surgery.  
 Treatment of  m etastatic  m elanoma 
 The outlook for patients with metastatic melanoma 
is poor. Patients generally have disease in multiple 
sites, and the median survival is approximately 
four to six months. Treatment depends upon the 
patient, on his or her ﬁ tness and on the disease site. 
Patients with multiple disease sites are treated with 
chemotherapy or biological therapies or a combi-
nation of the two. The most effective chemothera-
peutic drugs are dacarbazine, the nitrosoureas and 
vindesine. The response rate to these compounds 
is in the range of 5 – 10%. Prolonged survival is very 
rare, and the consensus view is that there is no 
advantage to the combination of single agents. 
New chemotherapy agents are being developed for 
melanoma, and there is interest in the role of 
temozolomide. 
 It is clear that biological therapies are effective in 
melanoma. Within this group, the interferons lead 
to response rates of 10%. The median duration of 
a partial response is approximately four months, 
and of a complete response seven months. More 
recently, adoptive immunotherapy using inter-
leukin 2 and LAK (lymphokine - activated killer) 
cells has been evaluated in melanoma. The high 
response rates initially reported have not been con-
ﬁ rmed, and the true response rates are in the order 
of 10% with a median duration of 3 months. Very 
rarely, spontaneous regression of metastatic disease 
occurs. 
 Prognosis 
 The most important prognostic factor is clinical 
stage, as reported in a group of 4000 patients 
treated in America and Australia. Approximately 
90% of stage 1 patients, 60% of stage 2 patients and 
30% of stage 3 patients survive for 10 years. The 
survival of stage 4 patients depends upon the meta-
static site. Median survival for patients with metas-
tases in the skin is seven months, in the lung is one 
year, in the brain is ﬁ ve months, in the liver is two 
months and in bone is six months. The depth of 
tumour invasion is the most important prognostic 
factor for localized melanoma. This can be 
described according to Clark ’ s stage and Breslow ’ s 
thickness. Ten - year survival for a lesion less than 
0.75   mm thick or for a Clark ’ s level I melanoma is 
90%, for a lesion 0.75 – 1.5  mm thick or Clark ’ s level 
II is 80%, for a lesion 1.6 – 2.49   mm thick or Clark ’ s 
level III is 60%, for a lesion 2.5 – 3.99   mm thick or 
Clark ’ s level IV is 50%, and for a lesion greater than 
4  mm or Clark ’ s level V is approximately 30%. 
 Other important survival factors have been 
described from multifactorial analyses. They 
include the type of initial surgical management, 
pathological stage, ulceration, presence of satellite 
nodules, a peripheral anatomical location and, to a 
much lesser extent, the patient ’ s sex, age and 
tumour diameter. 
 The American Joint Committee on Cancer, in a 
study involving 17   600 patients, has provided 
recent information on survival. This ranges from 
90% survival at ﬁ ve years for early - stage disease to, 
as might be expected, the usual miserable outlook 
of only 5% survival at ﬁ ve years for metastatic 
disease. 
 New  t reatment 
 Angiogenesis inhibitors such as thalidomide are 
currently under evaluation and responses have 
been reported. Antitumour vaccination pro-
grammes have also been developed, based on the 
initial observation by Morton and others.

Paediatric  s olid  t umours 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Cancer is a leading cause of death in children in 
England and Wales, second only to accidental 
injury. It is responsible for around 10% of deaths in 
childhood. Cancer in children is nonetheless rela-
tively rare, affecting 1 in 600 children, and includes 
a different spectrum of cancers than adults. The 
solid tumours encountered in childhood are often 
embryonal in origin, and many are associated with 
an inherited predisposition. There are few areas of 
medicine that can rival the advances made in pae-
diatric oncology in the second half of the 20th 
century. 7 in 10 children with cancer are now 
cured, compared with fewer than three in ten in 
1962 – 1966. It is estimated that in 2000, 55   000 
young adults in Britain aged 16 – 40 years were sur-
vivors of childhood cancer. 
 Many paediatric tumours are associated with rec-
ognized familial predispositions that are due to 
inherited mutations of tumour suppressor genes 
and therefore are inherited as autosomal dominant 
traits. Examples are hereditary retinoblastoma 
(mutations of the RB gene on chromosome 13q14) 
and familial Wilms ’ tumours (mutations of the 
WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13). In contrast, 
environmental oncogenic factors have been less 
readily identiﬁ ed for paediatric solid tumours; one 
example, however, is the excess of papillary thyroid 
cancers in children following the nuclear explo-
sion at Chernobyl (see Chapter  2 ). 
 After leukaemias, which account for 22% of 
childhood malignancies or 440 cases per year in 
the UK, central nervous system (CNS) tumours are 
the most common (20% or 330 cases), accounting 
for 2.5 in 100   000 persons under 18 years old, fol-
lowed by lymphoma (non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma, 
8%; Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma, 6%), neuroblastoma 
(8%), Wilms ’ tumour (6%) and bone tumours 
(6%). 
 Presentation and  m anagement of 
 CNS  t umours 
 Tumours in the CNS occur throughout childhood; 
the age distribution of paediatric CNS tumours is 
15% between birth and two years old, 30% from 
two to ﬁ ve years old, 30% from 5 to 10 years old, 
and 25% from 11 to 18 years old. In contrast to 
adult brain tumours, most (60%) are infratentorial 
and 75% are midline, involving the cerebellum, 
midbrain, pons and medulla. The most common 
tumours, accounting for 45%, are astrocytomas of 
varying grades. They include optic nerve gliomas, 
which are usually well differentiated tumours. A 
further 20% are medulloblastomas, a small round 
cell tumour of childhood, of neuroectodermal

origin. Medulloblastomas usually arise in the pos-
terior fossa and may seed metastases in the neu-
raxis by dropping them down the subarachoid 
space into the spinal canal. Craniopharyngiomas 
make up 5 – 10% of CNS tumours of childhood and 
cause raised intracranial pressure, visual defects 
and pituitary dysfunction: usually reduced growth 
hormone, thyroid - stimulating hormone (TSH), 
antidiuretic hormone (ADH: diabetes insipidus) or 
luteinizing hormone/follicle - stimulating hormone 
(LH/FSH) abnormalities (precocious puberty or 
delayed secondary sexual characteristics). Supra-
sellar calciﬁ cation is a characteristic X - ray ﬁ nding. 
A further 1 – 2% are pineal region tumours that 
present with Perinaud ’ s syndrome (failure of con-
jugate upward gaze). Histologically, most pineal 
tumours are extragonadal germ cell tumours (ter-
atomas and germinomas). Naturally, the manage-
ment of these children will be determined both by 
the histological diagnosis and the anatomical loca-
tion of the tumour and frequently involves surgery, 
radiotherapy and (occasionally) chemotherapy. 
The overall ﬁ ve - year survival rates according to the 
histology are shown in Table  41.1 . 
 Presentation and  m anagement 
of  n euroblastoma 
 Neuroblastoma is the most common malignancy 
in infants and often is clinically apparent at birth. 
About 100 new cases of neuroblastoma are diag-
nosed each year in the UK. Tumours often have 
ampliﬁ cation of the n - Myc oncogene on chromo-
some 1, either as small  ‘ double minute ’ (DM) chro-
mosomes, or as  ‘ homogenously staining regions ’ 
(HSR). They may arise from any site along the 
craniospinal axis derived from neural crest. The 
sites include abdominal sites (55%) such as the 
adrenal medulla (33%), pelvis (25%), thorax (13%) 
and head and neck (7%). In the case of head and 
neck neuroblastoma, these occur most commonly 
in the sympathetic ganglion or olfactory bulb (the 
latter are more common in adults). The most 
common ﬁ nding is a large, ﬁ rm and irregular 
abdominal mass that crosses the midline. Tumours 
may present with non - speciﬁ c symptoms such as 
weight loss, failure to thrive, fever and pallor of 
anaemia, especially if widespread metastases are 
present. 70% are disseminated at diagnosis via 
lymphatic and haematogenous spread. Metastases 
to bones of the skull are common, and orbital 
swelling is a frequent presentation. Paraneoplastic 
opsoclonus or myoclonus is a rare feature. These 
tumours have the highest spontaneous regression 
rate of any tumour, usually by maturation to gan-
glioneuroma. Plain abdominal X - ray may show 
calciﬁ cation: this occurs in 70% of neuroblastoma 
and 15% of Wilms ’ tumours. Other diagnostic 
investigations include  131 - I - labelled MIBG (meta -
 iodobenzyl guanidine) scan and urinary catecho-
lamines including VMA (vanillylmandelic acid), 
serum NSE (neuron - speciﬁ c enolase) and ferritin. 
Localized disease has a high cure rate with surgery 
and radiotherapy. On account of the high rate of 
disseminated disease at presentation, which is 
70%, however, the overall ﬁ ve - year survival rate 
for neuroblastoma is 55%.  
 Presentation and  m anagement of 
Wilms ’   t umours 
 This highly malignant embryonal tumour of the 
kidney is the most common malignant lesion of 
the genitourinary tract in children. It was named 
after Dr Max Wilms, who ﬁ rst described it, and is 
also known as nephroblastoma. Most occur in chil-
dren under ﬁ ve years old, and some are hereditary. 
Only about 75 children develop a Wilms ’ tumour 
each year in Britain. Wilms ’ tumours are associated

and the WAGR syndrome (Wilms ’ tumour, ani-
ridia, gonadoblastoma and mental retardation), 
Denys – Drash syndrome (Wilms ’ tumour, male 
pseudohermaphroditism and diffuse glomerular 
disease) and Beckwith – Wiedemann syndrome 
(organomegaly, hemihypertrophy, increased inci-
dence of Wilms ’ tumour, hepatoblastoma and 
adrenocortical tumours). Wilms ’ tumours present 
in usually healthy children as abdominal swellings 
with a smooth, ﬁ rm, non - tender mass. A quarter 
have gross haematuria, and occasionally children 
present with hypertension, malaise or fever. Up to 
20% have metastases at diagnosis; lungs are the 
most common site of metastases. The main stay of 
treatment is surgical resection with adjuvant radio-
therapy to the tumour bed, reserved for children 
with a high risk of relapse. The ﬁ ve - year survival 
for Wilms ’ tumours now exceeds 80%, and one of 
the goals of more recent trials is to reduce the long -
 term morbidity of treatment.  
 Presentation and  m anagement of 
 l iver  t umours 
 Fewer than 10 children in the UK develop liver 
tumours each year. Liver cancers are divided into 
hepatoblastoma (66%), which usually occurs 
before the age of three years, and hepatocellular 
cancers (33%), which occur at any age. Hepatoblas-
toma occurs as part of the Beckwith – Widemann 
syndrome and is also associated with familial ade-
nomatous polyposis. Hepatoblastoma is the third 
most common intra - abdominal malignancy in 
young children  – after neuroblastoma and Wilms ’ 
tumours. It most frequently affects the right lobe of 
the liver, and 10% have disseminated disease at 
presentation with regional lymph node involve-
ment or lung metastases. Hepatocellular carci-
noma is associated with hepatitis B and C infection, 
tyrosinaemia, biliary cirrhosis and  α 1 - antitrypsin 
deﬁ ciency. Surgical resection with or without 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy has dramatically 
improved the prognosis in hepatoblastoma, where 
the ﬁ ve - year overall survival is now 70%. In con-
trast, the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma 
in children is not greatly different from that for 
adults, with ﬁ ve - year overall survival rates of 
around 25%.  
 Presentation and  m anagement 
of  r etinoblastoma 
 Retinoblastoma most often occurs in children 
under ﬁ ve years old and in a third of cases is bilat-
eral. There are about 40 new cases of retinoblast-
oma diagnosed each year in the UK. Up to 40% are 
hereditary due to germline mutations of the retin-
oblastoma (RB) gene, and these children frequently 
have bilateral retinoblastoma and present at a 
younger age. Hereditary retinoblastoma was the 
basis of Knudsen ’ s two - hit model of tumour sup-
pressor genes. These tumours present with whiten-
ing of the pupil, squint or secondary glaucoma. 
Retinoblastoma is usually conﬁ ned to the orbit, 
and hence the cure rate with enucleation is high. 
Smaller tumours may be treated with localized 
cryotherapy, laser treatment or a radioactive iodine 
plaque stitched to the outer surface of the eye. 
Overall, 90% of children with retinoblastoma are 
cured. Hereditary retinoblastoma, however, is also 
associated with other malignancies, especially 
osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma. 
Genetic counselling is an integral part of therapy 
for retinoblastoma. All siblings should be exam-
ined periodically: DNA polymorphism analysis 
may identify relatives at high risk.

 Osteosarcoma 
 The incidence of bone tumours is highest during 
adolescence, although they only represent 3% of 
all childhood cancers. Only about 30 children 
develop these tumours each year in the UK. Most 
tumours occur in areas of rapid growth in the 
metaphysis near the growth plate, where cellular 
proliferation and remodelling are greatest during 
long bone growth. The most active growth plates 
are in the distal femur and proximal tibia. These 
are also the most common sites for primary bone 
cancers. Known risk factors include hereditary 

Paediatric solid tumours Chapter 41

retinoblastoma, Li – Fraumeni syndrome and prior 
radiotherapy. Most primary bone tumours present 
as painful swellings which may cause stiffness and 
effusions in nearby joints. Occasionally, tumours 
present as pathological fractures. The radiological 
appearances are a lytic or sclerotic expansile lesion, 
associated with a wide transition zone, cortical 
destruction, a soft tissue mass, periosteal reaction 
and calciﬁ cation. The clinical management of 
bone tumours requires a specialist multidiscipli-
nary unit including orthopaedic surgeons, plastic 
surgeons and oncologists. Clinical management 
should happen in the context of an adolescent 
oncology unit, since the majority of patients ﬁ t 
into this age group, with all its special needs. Neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy plays an important role in 
localized osteosarcoma and Ewing ’ s sarcoma to 
shrink the tumour and hopefully allow limb 
sparing surgery without increasing relapse rates. 
Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radio-
therapy are useful in some tumours. The ﬁ ve - year 
survival has steadily risen from under 20% in the 
late 1960s to over 60%.  
 Ewing ’ s  s arcoma 
 Ewing ’ s sarcoma is named after Dr James Ewing, 
who described the tumour in the 1920s. Ewing ’ s 
sarcoma is a childhood bone malignancy of uncer-
tain cellular origin that is associated with the 
t(11;22) chromosomal translocation that juxta-
poses the EWS and Fli - 1 genes, resulting in a hybrid 
transcript from these two transcription factor 
genes. This same chromosomal translocation 
occurs in peripheral neuroectodermal tumours 
(PNETs) and Askin lung tumours, suggesting a pos-
sible common origin. PNETs are thought to arise 
from peripheral autonomic nervous system tissue 
and stain for NSE as well as S - 100. Morphologi-
cally, all three tumours are small round blue cell 
tumours  – a group that also includes embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcoma, non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma, 
neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer. About 
30 children each year in the UK develop Ewing ’ s 
sarcoma. It most frequently occurs in the teenage 
years. Ewing ’ s sarcoma is very rare in African and 
Asian children and is not associated with familial 
syndromes or prior radiotherapy. It usually starts 
in a bone at the diaphysis or, less frequently, the 
metaphysic  – most commonly in one of the bones 
of the hips, upper arm or thigh, although it can 
also develop in soft tissue. The most common 
symptom is pain and swelling, but systemic symp-
toms such as pyrexia, weight loss and night sweats 
may also occur. X - rays usually demonstrate ill -
 deﬁ ned medullary destruction, small areas of new 
bone formation, periosteal reaction and soft tissue 
expansion. Approximately a ﬁ fth of patients have 
metastases in their lungs or bones at presentation. 
Multimodality treatment including surgery, radio-
therapy and chemotherapy is standard practice for 
Ewing ’ s sarcoma, and the ﬁ ve - year survival rate is 
55%. 
 Rhabdomyosarcoma 
 Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common paediat-
ric soft tissue sarcoma, although only 60 children 
are diagnosed with this tumour in the UK each 
year, and most are under 10 years old. Rhabdomy-
osarcoma may be divided into alveolar (25 – 30%), 
embryonal (50 – 60%) and pleomorphic (5%). The 
embryonal type occurs in the ﬁ rst decade, most 
often in the head and neck and genitourinary tract. 
The alveolar type occurs in adolescents, in the fore-
arms and trunk. The pleomorphic type occurs in 
adults. Consistent chromosomal translocations 
have been found in a number of soft tissue sarco-
mas, both benign and malignant. These chro-
mosomal 
rearrangements 
may 
be 
of 
help 
diagnostically; for example, 75% of alveolar rhab-
domyosarcomas harbour the t(2:13)(q35:q14) 
chromosomal translocation that fuses the PAX3 
gene and the FKHR ( forkhead ) gene. The conse-
quence of many of these translocations is the tran-
scription of chimeric mRNA, containing 5 ′ 
sequences of one gene and 3 ′ sequences from 
another gene, and translation to hybrid proteins. 
Many of the genes involved with these transloca-
tions are themselves transcription factors, and it is 
postulated that the consequence of these translo-
cations is the aberrant expression of a number of 
downstream genes. Rhabdomyosarcomas present 
as masses that grow and may become hard and

painful. Approximately 15% have metastases at 
presentation; most frequently in the lungs, bones 
and lymph nodes. Treatment involves both surgery 
and chemotherapy but is risk stratiﬁ ed, with radio-
therapy reserved for those at higher risk of relapse 
in order to save those at low risk of recurrence from 
the late effects of radiotherapy. The ﬁ ve - year 
overall survival is 75%.  
 Langerhans ’   c ell  h istiocytosis 
 Langerhans ’ cell histiocytosis (LCH), previously 
known as histiocytosis X, is not strictly a cancer 
but may behave in an aggressive fashion and is 
often treated by oncologists. About 30 children 
develop LCH in the UK each year; most of them are 
under two years old. LCH is a proliferation of 
epidermal histiocytes or Langerhans ’ cells, which 
are antigen - presenting dendritic cells named after 
Paul Langerhans, who ﬁ rst described them in 1868 
when he was a 21 - year - old medical student in 
Berlin. LCH comprises three overlapping syn-
dromes: unifocal bone diease (solitary eosinophilic 
granuloma), multifocal disease of bone (Hand –
 Sch ü ller – Christian disease) and multifocal, multi-
system disease (Letterer – Siwe disease). Letterer – 
Siwe disease occurs mainly in boys under two 
years old; Hand – Sch ü ller – Christian syndrome has 
a peak of onset in children aged 2 – 10 years; whilst 
solitary eosinophilic granuloma occurs in those 
aged 5 – 15 years. Solitary eosinophilic granuloma 
occurs at any site in bones, is usually asympto-
matic and is frequently an incidental ﬁ nding. 
Patients with Hand – Sch ü ller – Christian syndrome 
often present with recurrent episodes of otitis 
media and mastoiditis or with polyuria and poly-
dipsia due to diabetes insipidus. Letterer – Siwe 
disease presents with symptoms suggestive of a sys-
temic infection or malignancy with a generalized 
skin eruption, anaemia and hepatosplenomegaly 
and other protean manifestations (Table  41.2 ). 
This eponymous classiﬁ cation of LCH has in part 
been abandoned, and a simpler classiﬁ cation into 
either restricted LCH (skin or bone lesions) or 
extensive LCH (visceral organ involvement) has 
been introduced. The diagnosis is conﬁ rmed histo-
logically; the characteristic cytological features are 
CD1a surface antigen expression and cytoplasmic 
Birbeck granules. Localized bone disease is treated 
surgically or, less frequently, with radiotherapy, 
whilst systemic disease requires chemotherapy 
with cladribine often with desmopressin for the 
management of the diabetes insipidus. Survival 
exceeds 95% in unifocal disease and 80% in multi-
focal bone disease, but is only 50% in patients with 
systemic multiorgan disease.  
 Complications of  t reatment 
 Although many of the delayed effects of chemo-
therapy and radiotherapy in children are similar to 
those in adults, the effects on developing organs 
also produce unique late side effects, particularly 
on the skeleton, brain and endocrine systems.

These delayed effects of multimodality therapy on 
the developing child are substantial and the late 
sequelae cause considerable morbidity in this 
group of patients where the long - term survival 
rates are high. Radiotherapy retards bone and carti-
lage growth, and causes intellectual impairment, 
gonadal toxicity, hypothalamic and thyroid dys-
function, as well as pneumonitis, nephrotoxicity 
and hepatotoxicity. Late consequences of chemo-
therapy include infertility, anthracycline - related 
cardiotoxicity, 
bleomycin - related 
pulmonary 
ﬁ brosis and platinum - related nephrotoxicity and 
neurotoxicity. Up to 5% of children cured of this 
cancer will develop a second malignancy as a con-
sequence of an inherited cancer predisposition or 
the late sequelae of cancer treatment. Second 
malignancies occur most frequently following 
combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Bone  c ancers and  s arcomas 
 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 Bone tumours are amongst the oldest cancers dis-
covered in humans according to palaeopathologi-
cal evidence. A Bronze Age woman with bone 
metastases in her skull has been dated to 1600 –
 1900   BC, whilst Saxon bones from Standlake in 
Oxfordshire, UK, demonstrate features of osteosar-
coma in a young adult warrior. St Peregrine, born 
in 1260 at Forl ì , Italy, is the patron saint of cancer 
sufferers (the feast day is on 4 May). He was due for 
an amputation for a sarcoma of the leg, but the 
cancer was cured on the night prior to surgery, fol-
lowing a vision of Christ. He lived a further 20 
years and was canonized in 1726. The presumed 
origins of primary bone tumours are shown in 
Table  42.1 . 
 Sarcomas are tumours of the connective tissue, 
which supports the body and includes bone 
muscle, tendon, fat and synovial tissue. These 
tumours represent less than 1% of all malignan-
cies. They have an incidence of approximately 1 – 2 
per 100   000 per annum. There are no known asso-
ciated aetiological factors, although sarcomas 
rarely occur as second malignancies in areas of the 
body that have been previously irradiated. The 
most common bone tumours are osteosarcoma 
(see Figure  2.12 ) and Ewing ’ s sarcoma. 
 Ewing ’ s sarcoma occurs in childhood and in 
early adult life. Molecular biology studies have 
shown the presence of a speciﬁ c chromosomal 
translocation between chromosomes 22 and 11. 
This translocation is present in a group of small, 
round, blue cell tumours which include peripheral 
neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs), classic Ewing ’ s 
and extraosseous Ewing ’ s sarcoma; these are now 
grouped together for treatment purposes. In 
patients with this group of tumours there may be 
difﬁ culty in obtaining a histopathological diagno-
sis. Modern advances in molecular biology have 
led to the identiﬁ cation of the EWS/FLI - 1 translo-
cation present in patients with Ewing ’ s sarcoma. 
The presence of this translocation is identiﬁ able by 
ﬂ uorescence  in situ  hybridization (FISH). 
 Osteosarcoma occurs in two groups of patients: 
ﬁ rstly in adolescence or early adult life and sec-
ondly in old age, where osteosarcoma complicates 
Paget ’ s disease. p53 mutations are commonly seen 
in osteosarcoma, as are mutations in the retino-
blastoma gene.

nerve palsies may be seen where there is a cranial 
presentation. Patients may also present with 
metastases. Because of the rarity of these tumours 
and the requirement for a multidisciplinary spe-
cialist approach, patients with a suspected diagno-
sis of sarcoma should be referred on to specialist 
centres, where results have been shown to be vastly 
superior to those achieved by peripheral clinics. 
These tumours are usually diagnosed after a signiﬁ -
cant delay.

different types of bone cancers and sarcomas, some 
of which are illustrated in Figures  42.1 – 42.4 . 
 Investigations and  m anagement 
 In a patient where a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma 
is suspected, an initial biopsy should be carried out 
by the surgeon who is to perform deﬁ nitive surgery. 
Fine needle aspiration cytology, core needle biopsy 
and incisional biopsies are all techniques that are 
considered by the surgeon and, for those patients 
with rare abdominal or thoracic soft tissue sarco-
mas, CT - guided biopsies may be required. After 
the pathological diagnosis has been established, 
deﬁ nitive surgery can be planned. This requires a

context of magnetic resonance (MR) staging of the 
local tumour and CT deﬁ nition of the metastatic

the muscle compartment to include the fascia. This 
limits the risk of local relapse. 
 In those patients with Ewing ’ s sarcoma and oste-
osarcoma, initial staging will include CT assess-
ment of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and MR 
imaging of the primary tumour site. The initial 
management option for Ewing ’ s sarcoma includes

radiotherapy to control the local lesion. If the 
lesion is small and it is possible to have substantial 
resection margins, surgery is the best option 
with immediate endoprosthetic replacement. For 
the majority of patients, however, radiotherapy 
remains the most important treatment modality 
for the control of local disease. 
 Osteosarcomas are rare and for this reason also 
best managed in specialist centres. This is particu-
larly important for teenage patients with sarcomas. 
For these patients, chemotherapy, radiation, 
surgery and counselling all have a signiﬁ cant role 
in management. Patients with osteosarcomas are 
generally managed well because of the excellent 
results achieved using multidisciplinary specialist 
approaches. In osteosarcoma, bone scanning as 
well as CT and MR scanning are essential in the 
initial work up of a patient. Biopsy of the tumour is 
required with the open approach preferred. Surgi-
cal advances have meant that bone tumours are 
managed much better than they were, with the 
aim of limb - sparing prosthetic surgery.  
 Pathology 
 The most helpful classiﬁ cation of soft tissue 
tumours is into tumours of ﬁ brous tissue, ﬁ brohis-
tiocytic tumours, adipose tissue tumours including 
liposarcomas, tumours of muscle, tumours of 
blood vessels, tumours of lymph vessels, tumours 
of synovium, tumours of mesothelium, tumours of 
peripheral nerves, tumours of autonomic ganglia, 
tumours of paraganglionic structures, tumours of 
cartilage and bone - forming tissue, tumours of 
pleuripotential mesochyme, tumours of uncertain 
histogenesis and unclassiﬁ ed soft tissue tumours. 
This latter tumour group is extremely diverse, with 
at least 50 different subtypes.

 grade tumours, which by deﬁ nition should not 
spread, should be treated by surgical excision 
alone. Local control should result in 85 – 100% 
recovery in these patients. The situation is differ-
ent for those patients with high - grade tumours, 
and there is debate as to whether surgery alone, 
surgery combined with radiation, or surgery, radia-
tion and chemotherapy in combination is the 
correct approach.  
 Surgery 
 There is little argument that surgery is necessary, 
and the operation of ﬁ rst choice should be one that 
allows a reasonably wide margin of normal tissue 
to be excised with the tumour. If a good procedure 
is carried out, such as muscle compartmental exci-
sion, the local failure rate is 7 – 18%. If less radical 
procedures such as excision biopsy are performed, 
then the local failure rate is approximately 50%. 
More radical procedures such as amputation have a 
 These groups may in turn be divided into benign 
and malignant conditions. Benign tumours do not 
generally metastasize, and microscopic examina-
tion shows a low mitotic rate. Malignant tumours 
have a high mitotic rate and do tend to metasta-
size. Approximately one - third of tumours are low 
grade and two - thirds are high grade. Osteosarco-
mas are described as being of low, intermediate 
and high grade.

lower local recurrence rate, of approximately 5%. 
Over the last decade, there has been a trend toward 
radical compartmental excision with limb - sparing 
procedures. 
 Adjuvant  c hemotherapy and  r adiation 
 After deﬁ nitive surgery has been performed, the 
need for radiation and chemotherapy is assessed. 
Radiation is not given for low - grade tumours. In 
high - grade tumours, radiotherapy to the tumour 
bed has an advantage in terms of reduced local 
recurrence rates in extremity lesions where effec-
tive dosages can be given without risking vital 
structures. Local radiation has no effect upon the 
progression of distant metastases. Because patients 
with high - grade sarcomas are at great risk from the 
progression of their cancer to a metastatic state, 
adjuvant chemotherapy has been investigated in a 
number of trials. The original studies, which were 
non - randomized, showed an advantage to combi-
nation chemotherapy. This result has not held up, 
and the consensus view now is that adjuvant 
chemotherapy has no advantage in terms of ﬁ ve -
 year survival. This remains very much a subject for 
debate, however, and in many centres adjuvant 
chemotherapy is still administered.  
 Treatment of  m etastatic  s arcoma 
 The treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma 
requires the use of chemotherapy. The most effec-
tive single - agent treatments lead to responses in 
15 – 35% of patients. Attempts are made to capital-
ize on this by the use of combination chemother-
apy programmes. A slight increase in response 
rates has been found by some groups of clinicians. 
This supposed advantage is, however, much 
debated. Many cancer doctors would advocate the 
administration of single - agent chemotherapy to 
their patients simply because combination thera-
pies maximize toxicities and do not provide a sig-
niﬁ cant advantage.  
 Treatment of Ewing ’ s  s arcomas 
 For patients with Ewing ’ s tumours, the last 20 or 30 
years have seen a signiﬁ cant evolution of treat-
ment protocols. One type of management gener-
ally 
consists 
of 
treatment 
with 
induction 
chemotherapy, followed by local treatment to the 
primary site with either surgery or radiotherapy or 
both. This will be followed by further consolida-
tion chemotherapy.  
 Treatment of  o steosarcomas 
 Similarly in sarcomas, primary chemotherapy to 
debulk the tumour is followed by surgery. Both 
chemotherapy and surgery are complex and highly 
specialized, requiring immense technical skill and 
input from many areas of medical and paramedical 
expertise. Patients with metastatic osteosarcoma 
can be cured, and, once more, surgery is enor-
mously important. Surgical excision of pulmonary 
mestastases is considered and may be curative in a 
limited number of patients.  
 New  t reatment 
 Although there have been some developments in 
chemotherapy, it is not thought that chemother-
apy will be the future for patients with sarcomas. 
Oncologists and their patients have been most 
encouraged by the development of imatinib 
(Glevec), which is an agent that inhibits the func-
tion of the BCR - ABL oncogene and of the KIT and 
platelet - derived growth factor (PDGF) tyrosine 
kinases. This agent is active in chronic myeloid leu-
kaemia and is described in the leukaemia section of 
this book. It also has activity in gastrointestinal 
stromal sarcomas, which are rare sarcomas of the 
bowel. Patients who have gross metastatic disease 
have been seen to respond to this agent without 
any signiﬁ cant toxicity. This is clearly a wonderful 
development and may have a role in the manage-
ment of bone tumours.

 Epidemiology and  p athogenesis 
 For most patients who present with metastatic 
disease, routine examination and investigation 
will quickly disclose the underlying primary 
tumour. Occasionally, the primary tumour may be 
more elusive, and a number of clinical, histopatho-
logical and serological clues may help to establish 
the site. For 1 – 5% of patients, however, the primary 
site remains undisclosed because it is too small to 
be detected or has regressed. The usual histological 
diagnosis in these patients with an unknown 
primary site is adenocarcinoma or poorly differen-
tiated carcinoma. The beneﬁ ts of establishing the 
primary site include diagnosing treatable disease 
(Table  43.1 ), avoiding overtreating unresponsive 
disease and hence iatrogenic morbidity in resistant 
disease, preventing complications that relate to 
occult primary disease, such as bowel obstruction, 
and, ﬁ nally, clarifying the prognosis. The methods 
commonly used to aid in the hunt for a primary 
site are described below.  
 Clinical  s ites of  m etastatic  s pread 
 Different tumours follow different patterns of met-
astatic spread. This may be related to chemokine 
and chemokine receptor expression by tumours 
and stromal cells (see Part 1  ). 
 Brain and  m eningeal  m etastases 
 Up to 30% of solid tumours develop parenchymal 
brain metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis is less 
common. Carcinomatous meningitis presents 
with multiple, anatomically distant, cranial and 
spinal root neuropathies. The diagnosis may be 
conﬁ rmed by ﬁ nding malignant cells in the 
cerebrospinal ﬂ uid. Treatment usually involves a 
combination of intrathecal chemotherapy and 
craniospinal radiotherapy. Carcinomatous menin-
gitis most frequently occurs with leukaemias and 
lymphomas and occasionally with breast cancer. 
Parenchymal brain secondaries that may occur 
with any solid tumour are usually treated with 
whole - brain radiotherapy, although surgery may 
be considered for patients with solitary brain 
metastases and limited systemic disease (see Figure 
 15.2 ). 
 Bone  m etastases 
 Bone metastases are a major source of morbidity in 
patients with cancer and often have a prolonged 
course. Bone metastases cause pain, reduced mobil-
ity, pathological fractures, hypercalcaemia, myelo-
suppression and nerve compression syndromes.

are lung, breast, prostate, renal and thyroid 
tumours and sarcomas. Metastases usually occur in 
the axial skeleton, femur or humerus. If they are 
found elsewhere, then renal cancer and melanoma 
should be considered as possible primary tumour 
sites. Most bone metastases are lucent, lytic lesions; 
occasionally dense, sclerotic deposits are seen in 
prostate, breast, carcinoid tumours and Hodgkin ’ s 
disease. The diagnosis of bone metastases is rarely 
complicated. The differential diagnosis is outlined 
in Table  43.2 . (See also Figures  1.7 ,  16.1 ,  16.2  and 
 31.3 .) 
 Lung  m etastases 
 The lungs are the second most common site for 
metastases via haematogenous spread. Tumours 
that commonly metastasize to the lung include 
lung, breast, renal, thyroid, sarcoma and germ cell 
tumours. Surgical resection of pulmonary metas-
tases is occasionally undertaken where the primary 
site is controlled and the lungs are the sole site of 
metastasis. (See also Figures  2.7 and  17.1 c .) 
 Liver  m etastases 
 Of all patients with liver metastases, 60% have a 
colorectal primary tumour, 25% have melanoma, 
15% lung cancer and 5% breast cancer. Hepatic 
resection for patients with up to three metastases 
from colorectal cancer results in ﬁ ve - year survivals 
of 30% and is the best treatment available for 
selected patients.  
 Malignant  e ffusions 
 Eighty percent of malignant pleural effusions are 
due to lung and breast cancer, lymphoma and 

Unknown primary cancer Chapter 43

leukaemia. Malignant pericardial effusion is rarer 
than pleural effusions; breast and lung cancer 
account for 75%. Metastases to the heart and peri-
cardium are 40 times more common than primary 
tumours at these sites, but only 15% will develop 
tamponade. Malignant ascites is a common com-
plication of ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal and 
gastric cancers and lymphoma. Measures for long -
 term control of malignant effusions include sclero-
sis with talc, bleomycin or tetracycline for pleural 
effusions, drainage by pericardial window for peri-
cardial effusions and peritoneovenous shunts for 
malignant ascites (see Figure  46.6 ). 
 Clinical  u nknown  p rimary 
 s yndromes 
 Five highly treatable subsets of unknown primary 
site have been identiﬁ ed, which have more favour-
able outcomes and require distinct management: 
 1.  Women with isolated axillary lymphadenopa-
thy (adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carci-
noma) usually have an occult breast primary and 
should be managed as stage II breast cancer. They 
have a similar prognosis (ﬁ ve - year survival is 70%).  
 2.  Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis (often 
papillary carcinoma with elevated serum CA - 125) 
should be managed as stage III ovarian cancer.  
 3.  Men with extragonadal germ cell syndrome or 
atypical teratoma present with features reminis-
cent of gonadal germ cell tumours. They occur pre-
dominantly in young men with pulmonary or 
lymph node metastases. Germ cell tumour markers 
( α - fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gona-
dotrophin (HCG)) may be detected in the serum 
and in tissue by immunocytochemistry. Cytoge-
netic analysis for isochromosome 12p (see Box 1.4) 
is positive in 90% of cases. Empirical chemother-
apy with cisplatin - based combinations yield 
response rates of over 50% and up to 30% long -
 term survival.  
 4.  Patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of an 
unknown primary site overlap with extrapul-
monary small cell carcinoma, anaplastic islet 
cell carcinoma, Merkel cell tumours and para-
gangliomas. Immunocytochemical staining for 
chromogranin, neuron - speciﬁ c enolase, synapto-
physin and epithelial antigens (cytokeratins and 
epithelial membrane antigen) are usually positive. 
Patients often present with bone metastases and 
diffuse liver involvement. These tumours are fre-
quently responsive to platinum - based combina-
tion chemotherapy.  
 5.  Patients with high cervical lymphadenopathy 
containing squamous cell carcinoma may have 
occult head and neck tumours of the nasopharynx, 
oropharynx or hypopharynx. Radical neck dissec-
tion followed by extended ﬁ eld radiotherapy that 
includes these possible primary sites may yield 
ﬁ ve - year survival rates of 30%. Adenocarcinoma in 
high cervical nodes and lower cervical adenopathy 
containing either histology, however, have a much 
worse prognosis and should not be treated in this 
aggressive fashion.  
 Unfortunately, 
the 
majority 
of 
unknown 
primary tumours do not ﬁ t into any of these 
subsets, and the response rates to chemotherapy 
are below 20%. These responses are usually of brief 
duration, with no impact on overall survival. The 
median survival is under 12 months. The excep-
tion to this rule is in the group of patients who are 
under 45 years old. In this group, treatment with 
BEP (bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin) or a 
taxane combination is worthwhile. For this group 
of patients, 50% survive in excess of two years. 
Tumours from patients such as these do not have 
the characteristics of testicular cancer, that is, their 
tumours do not stain positively for HCG or AFP.  
 Histopathological  c haracterization 
 The histopathological characterization of un -
known 
primaries 
to 
establish 
their 
origin 
includes a number of techniques: light micros-
copy, 
immunocytochemical 
staining, 
immu-
nophenotyping, electron microscopy, cytogenetics 
and molecular analysis. These are described in 
detail in Part 1 . 
 Serological  c haracterization 
 Tumour markers are proteins produced by cancers 
that are detectable in the blood of patients. Ideally, 
serum tumour markers should be quick and cheap

to measure, have high sensitivity (of more than 
50%) and speciﬁ city (over 95%) and yield a high 
predictive value of positive (PPV) and negative 
(NPV) results. Under these circumstances, tumour 
markers may be used for population screening, 
diagnosis, as prognostic factors, for monitoring 
treatment, diagnosing remission and detecting 
relapse and for imaging metastases. A large number 
of serum tumour markers are available, and each 
may be valuable for any of screening, diagnosis,

 Approach to  i nvestigation of 
 m etastatic  d isease to  e stablish 
 p rimary  s ite 
 There is a worrying tendency to over - investigate 
patients with unknown primary cancer while at 
the same time ignoring their palliative care needs. 
So often the greater the eminence and number of 
consultants whose advice is sought, the larger the 
number of esoteric investigations ordered, and the 
less well the patient and their family are informed. 
Investigations should be restricted to those that 
will alter clinical management. It is estimated that 
in the absence of a localizing sympton, extensive 
radiological investigation leads to the identiﬁ ca-
tion of a primary site in less than 5% of all patients. 
The prognosis is generally poor, with a median sur-
vival of three to four months. Less than 25% of 
patients survive to one year, and less than 10% are 
alive after ﬁ ve years. The site of the primary is 
usually on the same side of the diaphragm as the 
metastases, and 75% of tumours are infradiaphrag-
matic; of the 25% that arise above the diaphragm, 
nearly all arise from the lung. Where identiﬁ ed, the 
most common primary sites, in order of frequency, 
are: lung, pancreas, liver, colorectal, stomach, 
kidney, prostate, ovary, breast, lymphoid and 
testis. A good performance status is the most 
important predictor of survival, while extensive 
weight loss and older age are adverse prognostic 
factors. With the exception of the ﬁ ve clinical syn-
dromes listed above, treatment other than 
symptom palliation is rarely appropriate.

Immunodeﬁ ciency and  c ancer 
 Hereditary or  p rimary 
 i mmunodeﬁ ciency 
 Primary immunodeﬁ ciencies are mainly single -
 gene inherited disorders that present in early child-
hood. They include nearly 100 syndromes, 
three - quarters of which have been characterized 
genetically. One important exception is common 
variable immunodeﬁ ciency (CVID), a complex, 
polygenic disease that is often ﬁ rst manifest in 
early adulthood. Classically, primary immunodeﬁ -
ciency disorders are classiﬁ ed into B - lymphocyte, 
T - lymphocyte, phagocytic cell and complement 
deﬁ ciencies. This classiﬁ cation is useful, as it helps 
us establish the clinical manifestations. For 
example, B - cell deﬁ ciencies usually present after 
the age of 6 months, when maternal antibodies are 
exhausted, and the most common pathogens are 
encapsulated bacteria (like  Streptococcus and  Hae-
mophillus ), fungi (such as  Giardia and  Crypt-
osporidia ) and enteroviruses. In contrast, primary 
T - cell deﬁ ciencies usually present within the ﬁ rst 6 
months of life, with opportunistic infections such 
as  Mycobacterium ,  Candida ,  Pneumocystis jiroveci 
and cytomegalovirus. Both B - cell and T - cell 
primary immunodeﬁ ciency may be associated 
with an increased risk of malignancy (Table 
 44.1 ). An increased risk of cancer has not been 
found with complement deﬁ ciencies or phagocyte 
abnormalities. 
 Acquired or  s econdary 
 i mmunodeﬁ ciency 
 Two forms of acquired immunodeﬁ ciency have 
dominated the last quarter of the 20th century and 
are responsible for the majority of cancers in the 
immunosuppressed. Both human immunodeﬁ -
ciency virus (HIV) and iatrogenic immunosuppres-
sion following allogenic transplantation are 
associated with cancers that are linked with onco-
genic viruses. The ﬁ rst renal transplant was per-
formed between identical twins by Joseph Murray 
at Boston ’ s Brigham Hospital in 1953. The devel-
opment of azathioprine by George Hitchins and 
Gertrude Elion 10 years later enabled successful 
allogeneic transplantation and began an era of 
transplantation medicine dependent upon iatro-
genic immunosuppression. The allogeneic organ 
transplant recipients who received immunosup-
pressant therapy were found to be prone to 
post - transplantation lymphoproliferative diseases 
(PTLDs) and other tumours. The emergence of 
post - transplant tumours is widely quoted as evi-
dence to support Burnet ’ s immune surveillance 
theory that states that the immune system acts to 
remove abnormal clones of cells. In 1949, Frank 
Macfarlane Burnet described a theory of acquired

million per year. Along with opportunistic infec-
tions, tumours are a major feature of HIV infection. 
The most frequent tumours in this population are 
Kaposi ’ s sarcoma (KS), non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma 
and cervical cancer, and these three are AIDS -
 deﬁ ning illnesses. The management of cancer in 
the immunodeﬁ cient host requires careful atten-
tion to the balance between antitumour effects and 
the toxicity associated. Combination antiretroviral 
treatment has both dramatically reduced the inci-
dence of opportunistic infections and prolonged 
the survival of people with HIV infection. In addi-
tion, this highly active antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART) has reduced the incidence of AIDS - deﬁ n-
ing malignancies and improved their prognosis. 
Less than ﬁ ve million of the estimated 33 million 
people infected with HIV worldwide, however, 
are receiving HAART, as the majority of affected 
people live in developing countries. In addition, 
even in the established market economies with 
access to medical treatment, many individuals 
remain undiagnosed and consequently do not 
receive HAART.  
 Tumours in  p rimary 
 i mmunodeﬁ ciency 
 The cancers that occur with primary immunodeﬁ -
ciency syndromes are rare, and as a consequence 
treatment protocols and outcome data are scarce. 
Most patients succumb to infections, and these 
continue to pose a major threat to life during treat-
ment of associated tumours.  
 Management of  i mmunodeﬁ ciency -
 a ssociated  m alignancies 
 The incidence of congenital immunodeﬁ ciency -
 associated tumours is sufﬁ ciently low for there to 
be little consensus upon their clinical manage-
ment. In contrast, the incidence of both PTLD and 
KS has risen dramatically in recent years with the 
spread of the HIV pandemic and the marked 
increase in transplant surgery. The management of 
PTLD relies upon enhanced immunity against EBV 
by reducing immunosuppression and infusing 
immunological tolerance, proposing that lym-
phocytes that were able to respond to self - antigens 
were deleted in prenatal life. This hypothesis was 
conﬁ rmed experimentally by Peter Medawar who 
shared the Nobel Prize with Burnet in 1960. Peter 
Medawar also wrote several wonderful books and 
collections of essays and I would encourage 
anyone who is thinking of doing scientiﬁ c research 
to read  Advice to a Young Scientist . In the 1960s, 
however, in a  volte face  that signalled a paradigm 
shift, Burnet began to champion the view that a 
major function of the immune system is to elimi-
nate malignant cells. This was based upon evi-
dence that animals can be immunized against 
syngeneic transplantable tumours. This theory of 
immune surveillance led to the identiﬁ cation of 
tumour antigens and of immunotherapy strategies 
to treat tumours.  
 Tumours in  a llograft  r ecipients 
 The risk of cancer following an organ transplant 
varies with both the organ that has been trans-
planted and the type of cancer. The greatest risks 
numerically are with heart and heart – lung trans-
plants, which often require a more aggressive 
regimen of immunosuppression to prevent graft 
rejection. In addition to PTLD that is caused by the 
Epstein – Barr virus (EBV), the risks of Kaposi ’ s 
sarcoma (caused by Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus 
(KSHV)), cervical cancer (caused by human papil-
lomavirus (HPV)) and non - melanoma skin cancers 
are most dramatically increased. In the case of 
PTLD and post - transplantation Kaposi ’ s sarcoma, 
reducing the immunosuppression may cause 
regression of the tumours  – but this of course 
increases the risk of graft rejection.  
 Tumours in  HIV  p atients 
 Studies by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
estimated that by December 2007, over 25 million 
people had died of acquired immune deﬁ ciency 
syndrome (AIDS) and 33 million people are living 
with the virus. The number of people newly 
infected with HIV worldwide is approximately 2.5

cytotoxic T lymphocytes against EBV. In addition, 
antiviral agents, low - dose chemotherapy and anti -
 CD20 monoclonal antibodies may be useful. The 
introduction of HAART has reduced the incidence 
of HIV - associated KS in established market econo-
mies where this treatment is available. Moreover, 
early - stage KS may be successfully treated with 
HAART alone, leading to regression of KS (Figure 
 44.1 ). Visceral KS is usually treated with systemic 
liposomal anthracycline chemotherapy with con-
comitant HAART. Other tumours that arise in 
immunodeﬁ cient individuals are generally treated 
along conventional lines, with extra attention to 
the risk of infectious complications of therapy.

Paraneoplastic  c omplications of  c ancer 
 Paraneoplastic complications of malignancy are 
remote effects of cancer that arise without local 
spread. Most of these paraneoplastic syndromes 
arise due to secretion by tumours of hormones, 
cytokines and growth factors. Paraneoplastic syn-
dromes also arise when normal cells secrete prod-
ucts in response to the presence of tumour cells. 
For example, antibodies produced in this fashion 
are responsible for many paraneoplastic neurologi-
cal syndromes including cerebellar degeneration, 
Lambert – Eaton myasthenic syndrome and para-
neoplastic retinopathy. Paraneoplastic neurologi-
cal complications always appear on the list of 
differential diagnoses. However, just as viewers of 
 House MD  will know that  ‘ it ’ s not lupus ’ , it is rarely 
paraneoplastic either.  
 Paraneoplastic  e ndocrine 
 c omplications 
 Cushing ’ s  s yndrome 
 Cushing ’ s syndrome is a clinical disorder resulting 
from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids 
and should not be confused with Cushing ’ s disease 
which refers exclusively to those cases that arise 
due to an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) 
secreting pituitary adenoma (Table  45.1 ). Clini-
cally overt Cushing ’ s syndrome caused by ectopic 
secretion of ACTH by non - endocrine - derived 
tumours is rare. Approximately 20% of cases of 
Cushing ’ s syndrome are caused by ectopic ACTH 
secretion by a tumour that is frequently occult at 
presentation. For this reason the differential diag-
nosis between pituitary adenoma and ectopic 
ACTH is important clinically but biochemical 
overlap often makes this difﬁ cult. More than half 
the cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome are due to 
small cell lung cancer, with carcinoid tumours and 
neural crest tumours (phaeochromocytoma, neu-
roblastoma, medullary cell carcinoma of the 
thyroid) accounting for a further 15%. The typical 
presentation is of a middle - aged smoker with fea-
tures of severe hypercortisolism and hypokalaemic 
metabolic alkalosis. Patients have muscle weakness 
or 
atrophy, 
oedema, 
hypertension, 
mental 
changes, glucose intolerance and weight loss. 
When ectopic ACTH production arises from a 
more benign tumour (e.g. bronchial carcinoid or 
thymoma), the other classic features of Cushing ’ s 
syndrome may be present including truncal 
obesity, moon facies and cutaneous striae (Figure 
 45.1 ). 
 The diagnosis of Cushing ’ s syndrome may be 
conﬁ rmed by elevated urinary free cortisol, loss of 
diurnal variation of plasma cortisol and failure of

an elevated plasma ACTH supports the diagnosis of 
pituitary adenoma or ectopic ACTH syndrome. 
Failure of cortisol suppression following high - dose 
dexamethasone (2   mg four times daily for two 
days, or 8   mg overnight) and very high levels of 
ACTH ( > 200   pg/ml) suggest an ectopic source of 
ACTH. In difﬁ cult cases, a corticotrophin - releasing 
hormone (CRH) stimulation test, selective venous 
catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinus with 
ACTH estimations, somatostatin analogue scinti-
gaphy and technetium - 99 methoxyisobutylisoni-
trile (MIBI) imaging may be necessary to determine 
the source of ACTH. 
 The mainstay of palliative therapy for Cushing ’ s 
syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production is inhi-
bition of steroid synthesis, although inhibition of 
ACTH release and blocking glucocorticoid recep-
tors have also been attempted. Several steroid 
synthesis inhibitors are available and successful 
use in these circumstances has been reported 
with aminoglutethamide, metyrapone, mitotane, 
ketoconazole and octreotide. On rare occasions 
laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy or adrenal 
artery embolization may be necessary to control 
symptoms.

 Syndrome of  i nappropriate  a ntidiuresis 
 Hyponatraemia is a common ﬁ nding in associa-
tion with advanced malignancy and many factors 
may contribute including cardiac and hepatic 
failure, hyperglycaemia and diuretics. However, 
the detection of concentrated urine in conjunction 
with hypo - osmolar plasma suggests abnormal 
renal free water excretion and the presence of the 
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). 
This acronym is better than the previous term 
 ‘ SIADH ’ (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone) since there is no vasopressin (ADH) 
secretion in approximately 15% of cases. In malig-
nancy - related SIAD, tumours secrete ectopic 
arginine vasopressin or vasopressin - like peptides. 
In many respects SIAD is the opposite of diabetes 
insipidus; patients with SIAD are waterlogged with 
low plasma osmolality and sodium and high urine 
osmolality, whilst patients with diabetes insipidus 
are dehydrated with high plasma osmolality and 
sodium and low urine osmolality. SIAD is most fre-
quently associated with small cell lung cancer or 
carcinoid tumours but has also been described in 
pancreatic, oesophageal, prostatic and haemato-
logical malignancies. Nonetheless many factors 
may contribute to SIAD (Table  45.2 ). 
 Signiﬁ cant symptoms of hyponatraemia appear 
at plasma sodium levels below 125   mmol/l, with 
confusion progressing to stupor, coma and seizures 
as levels fall. Nausea, vomiting and focal neuro-
logical deﬁ cits may also occur. The clinical features 
depend on both the levels of plasma sodium and 
the rate of decline. With gradual falls in sodium, 
the brain cells are able to compensate against cere-
bral oedema by secreting potassium and other 
intracellular solutes. Asymptomatic hyponatrae-
mia therefore suggests chronic SIAD rather than 
acute SIAD. The division into chronic and acute 
SIAD is of therapeutic importance as their manage-
ment differs. The diagnosis of SIAD requires the 
demonstration of plasma hyponatraemia and 
hypo - osmolality in the presence of concentrated 
urine and normal extracellular ﬂ uid volume (Table 
 45.3 ). 
 The management of SIAD depends upon the rate 
of onset of hyponatraemia and the presence of neu-

rological complications. Acute SIAD with an onset 
over two to three days and falls in serum sodium in 
excess of 0.5   mmol/l per day are associated with 
neurological sequelae and require prompt correc-
tion by intravenous hypertonic saline. In contrast, 
the mainstay of therapy for chronic asymptomatic 
SIAD is ﬂ uid restriction and inhibition of tubular 
reabsorption of water with drugs including the tet-
racycline antibiotic demeclocycline, which causes 
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.  
 Non - i slet  c ell  t umour  h ypoglycaemia 
 Tumour - related hypoglycaemia is a frequent com-
plication of  β - islet cell tumours of the pancreas 
which secrete insulin (insulinomas), but occurs 

Chapter 45 Paraneoplastic complications of cancer
246
(Table  45.4 ). The majority of pancreatic islet cell 
tumours are malignant (with the exception of 
most insulinomas) and metastases are frequently 
present at diagnosis. For many patients the dis-
tressing clinical manifestations arising from exces-
sive secretion of gastrointestinal peptides require 
palliation and this may be difﬁ cult to achieve. 
These tumours often secrete more than one 
polypeptide hormone and may switch their 
hormone production during follow - up. 
 Carcinoid  s yndrome 
 Carcinoid tumours arise from enterochromafﬁ n 
cells principally in the gastrointestinal tract, pan-
creas and lungs but occasionally in the thymus and 
gonads (Table  45.5 ). One in ten patients with carci-
noid tumours develop the carcinoid syndrome 
after the development of hepatic metastases. This 
avoids the ﬁ rst pass metabolism of 5 - hydroxytryp-
tamine (serotonin, 5HT) and kinins in the liver so 
that the systemic symptoms occur. The acute 
symptoms are vasomotor ﬂ ushing (typically of 
upper body lasting up to 30 minutes), fever, pru-
ritic wheals, diarrhoea, asthma/wheezing, borbo-
rygmi and abdominal pain. Chronic complications 
include tricuspid regurgitation, arthropathy, pul-
monary stenosis, mesenteric ﬁ brosis, cirrhosis, pel-
lagra (due to secondary deﬁ ciency of trytophan) 
and telangiectasia. The diagnostic investigation is 
24 - hour urinary collection of 5 - hydroxyindole -
 acetic acid (5HIAA), a metabolite of 5HT. Somato-
statin analogues are considered by most physicians 
to be the ﬁ rst - line treatment of choice for patients 
with carcinoid syndrome and indeed most entero-
pancreatic hormone syndromes. Palliation of the 
clinical manifestations of carcinoid syndrome 
includes symptomatic therapy of diarrhoea 
(codeine phosphate, loperamide or diphenoxy-
late),  β 2 - adrenergic agonists for wheezing, and 
avoiding precipitating factors to reduce ﬂ ushing 
(including alcohol and some foods).  
 Phaeochromocytoma 
 Phaeochromocytomas arise from the chromafﬁ n 
cells of the sympathetic nervous system, most 
uncommonly with non - islet cell tumours. Most 
non - islet cell tumours produce hypoglycaemia 
through increased glucose use or by secreting insu-
lin - like growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2). Non - islet 
cell tumours associated with hypoglycaemia are 
usually large retroperitoneal or intrathoracic sarco-
mas. Unlike other endocrine complications of 
malignancy, hypoglycaemia is very rarely associ-
ated with lung cancer. The clinical manifestations 
are due to cerebral hypoglycaemia and secondary 
secretion of catecholamines; they include agita-
tion, stupor, coma and seizures that may follow 
exercise or fasting. Tumour - related hypoglycaemia 
should be differentiated from other causes of 
hypoglycaemia including drugs (e.g. sulphonylu-
reas), hypoadrenalism, hypopituitarism and liver 
failure. In advanced malignancy the most common 
cause of hypoglycaemia is continued oral hypogly-
caemic medication in long - standing diabetics.  
 Enteropancreatic  h ormone  s yndromes 
 Enteropancreatic hormone production is relatively 
uncommon in malignant disease. A variety of clin-
ical syndromes occur associated with hormone 
secretion by endocrine tumours of the pancreas 
and less frequently tumours arising in other organs

frequently in the adrenal medulla but occasionally 
from sympathetic ganglia. Phaeochromocytomas 
commonly secrete norepinephrine (noradrena-
line) and epinephrine (adrenaline) but in some 
cases signiﬁ cant quantities of dopamine are also 
produced. Phaeochromocytomas are associated 
with a number of familial inherited cancer syn-
dromes including multiple endocrine neoplasia 
(MEN) 2a, MEN 2b, von Hippel – Lindau syndrome 
and neuroﬁ bromatosis. The catecholamines cause 
intermittent, episodic or sustained hypertension 
and other clinical manifestations including 
anxiety, tremor, palpitations, sweating, ﬂ ushing, 
headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances and poly-
uria. These symptoms are all attributable to exces-
sive adrenergic stimulation. 
 24 - hour urinary collection for urinary free cate-
cholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine and 
dopamine) is now the most widely employed diag-
nostic test although some centres also measure cat-
echolamine metabolites such as metanephrines 
and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). The tumour 
may be localized by radiolabelled meta - iodobenzyl 
guanidine (MIBG) scintography. 
 Initial treatment should be  α - blockade to control 
hypertension followed by  β - blockade to control 
tachycardia. This combination will control symp-
toms in most patients with malignant phaeochro-
mocytoma. If palliation is not achieved, high - dose 
 131 I - MIBG may be used as therapy for phaeochro-
mocytoma and neuroblastoma as it reduces cate-
cholamine synthesis. This may only have a chance 
of success if the patient has small volume metas-
tases, because  131 I - MIBG is  β - emitting and  β -
 particles have poor tissue penetration.  
 Gynaecomastia 
 Gynaecomastia results from elevation in the oes-
trogen   :  androgen ratio, which may be either a con-
sequence of decreased androgen production or 
activity or increased oestrogen formation (usually 
by peripheral aromatization of circulating andro-
gens to oestrogens). In men with advanced cancer, 
gynaecomastia is most often a consequence of 
drug therapy, either chemotherapy (alkylating 
agents, vinca alkaloids, nitrosoureas), anti - emetics 
(metoclopramide, phenothiazines), anti - androgens

(cyproterone acetate, ﬂ utamide, bicalutamide) 
or gonadotrophin - releasing hormone analogues 
(goserelin, leuprorelin). Occasionally other tumour 
secretion of oestrogens or gonadotrophins may be 
responsible. Tumours may either secrete oestro-
gens (Leydig cell testicular tumours and feminizing 
adrenocortical tumours), promote the conversion 
of androgens to oestrogens (Sertoli cell testicular 
tumours and hepatoma) or secrete human chori-
onic gonadotrophin (HCG) stimulating oestradiol 
production in the testes (testicular tumours, non -
 small cell lung cancers, hepatoma and islet cell 
tumours of the pancreas).  
 Paraneoplastic  n eurological 
 c onditions 
 In contrast to the metabolic and endocrine para-
neoplastic conditions where products secreted by 
the tumours are responsible, most neurological 
paraneoplastic syndromes are immune mediated. 
Moreover with neurological paraneoplastic syn-
dromes, the tumour may be asymptomatic or 
occult. It is thought that antibodies reacting to 
antigens on the surface of cancer cells cross - react 
with neural antigens and are the basis of these syn-
dromes. The antibodies may be directed at ion 
channels, for example the presynaptic P - type volt-
age - gated calcium channel in the case of Lambert –
 Eaton myasthenic syndrome and the nictonic 
acetyl choline receptor in myasthenia gravis. Alter-
natively, antibodies may bind intracellular pro-
teins such as Hu, a neuronal nuclear RNA - binding 
protein, and Yo, a cytoplasmic protein in Purkinje 
cells of the cerebellum. The most common para-
neoplastic 
neurological 
manifestations 
are 
described in association with small cell lung cancer 
(Table  45.6 ). 
 Paraneoplastic  d ermatological 
 c onditions 
 A number of paraneoplastic dermatological mani-
festations have been described, and some are listed 
in Table  45.7 . Amongst the most common parane-
oplastic dermatological manifestation is clubbing 
 Figure 45.2   Finger nail clubbing is characterized by in -
creased longitudinal curving of the nail, loss of the angle 
between the nail and its bed and bogginess of the nail fold.  
(see Figure  45.2 ), a clinical sign beloved of physi-
cians and ﬁ rst described by Hippocrates over 2400 
years ago. It is characterized by softening of the 
nail bed and periungual erythema with loss of the 
normal 15 degree angle at the hyponychium. As 
this advances, bulging of the distal phalynx and 
curvature of the nail lead to a drumstick end 
appearance. Clubbing may be associated with 
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy with new subperi-
osteal cancellous bone formation at the distal ends 
of long bones, particularly the radius and ulna or 
tibia and ﬁ bula (Figure  45.3 ). A hereditary form of 
clubbing with hypertrophic osteo - arthropathy, 
Touraine – Solente – Gol é syndrome, has recently 
been shown to be due to germline mutations of the 
15 - hydroxyprostaglandin 
dehydrogenase 
gene 
that catabolizes prostaglandin E2. Whether para-
neoplastic clubbing is due to elevated levels of 
prostaglandin E2 or tumour - related secretion of 
growth factors, including PDGF (platelet - derived 
growth factor) and HGF (hepatocyte growth 
factor), remains unclear.

 Cachexia 
 Cachexia or severe protein - calorie malnutrition is 
one of the most debilitating and life - threatening 
aspects of cancer. This highly distressing symptom 
severely impairs the quality of life of many patients 
with cancer but is the focus of relatively little 
research. The normal balance between hunger and 
satiety, anorexia and obesity in humans is main-
tained by equilibrium between adipose - derived 
hormones including leptin and gut - derived hor-
mones including ghrelin. An empty stomach stim-
ulates ghrelin release which acts to promote 
neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti - related peptide 
(AgRP) secretion in the hypothalamus, resulting in 
stimulation of the hunger centre. At the same time, 
ghrelin inhibits the release of pro - opiomelanocor-
tin (POMC) hormones including  α - MSH (melano-
cyte - stimulating hormone) from the hypothalamus, 
thus inhibiting the satiety centre and blocking 
anorexigenic pathways. Leptin, which is produced 
by fat cells, antagonizes ghrelin ’ s actions on the 
hypothalamus by inhibiting NPY and AgRP release 
and stimulating  α - MSH secretion (Figure  45.4 ). 
Amongst the mechanisms invoked in cancer 
cachexia is disruption of this delicate homoeostatic 
mechanism. In addition, tumour - related secretion 
of pro - inﬂ ammatory cytokines including inter-
leukin - 1 (IL - 1) and interleukin - 6 (IL - 6), interferon 
gamma (IFN - γ ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF - α ) are thought to play a role in the pathogen-
esis of cancer cachexia. These effects may be medi-
ated partly via the hypothalamic leptin/gherlin 
axis. Another clue to cancer cachexia has been 
found with the identiﬁ cation of proteolysis - 
inducing factor (PIF) and lipid - mobilizing factor 
(LMF). PIF causes breakdown of muscle proteins 
in skeletal muscle by activating the ubiquitin pro-
teosome pathway and levels of PIF are raised in 
cancer patients with wasting. LMF, which is pro-
duced by tumour cells, causes lipolysis by raising 
the levels of the mitochondrial uncoupling pro-
teins that turn brown fat into heat in hibernating 
animals. 
 The severe weight loss shortens survival and 
decreases quality of life substantially, indeed for 
many malignancies weight loss of  > 10% body 
weight is an independent adverse prognostic 
factor. The two major options for pharmacological 
therapy that aim to enhance appetite are pro-
gestogens, such as megestrol acetate, and corticos-
teroids. Neither these drugs nor enteral or 
parenteral nutrition has proved universally beneﬁ -
cial and both approaches are associated with 
appreciable toxicity. This is particularly so for 
corticosteroids, which, although they stimulate 
appetite, are catabolic in effect, leading to muscle 
loss. As the molecular aetiology of cancer cachexia 
is unveiled, novel therapeutic strategies are 
emerging.

Oncological  e mergencies 
 Hypercalcaemia 
 One in ten cancer patients develop hypercalcaemia 
and malignancy accounts for about half the cases 
of hypercalcaemia amongst hospital inpatients. 
Hypercalcaemia occurs most frequently with 
myeloma, breast, lung and renal cancers, and 20% 
of cases occur in the absence of bone metastases. 
Most patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy 
have disseminated disease and 80% die within one 
year. Thus hypercalcaemia is usually a complica-
tion of advanced disease and its treatment should 
be directed at palliation as it may produce a number 
of distressing symptoms (Table  46.1 ). The treat-
ment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy frequently 
ameliorates these symptoms, and for this reason 
the diagnosis should always be sought.  
 In recent years there have been signiﬁ cant 
advances in our understanding of the biochemical 
processes that cause hypercalcaemia in malig-
nancy, such that the factors involved in local oste-
olysis 
and 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
humoral 
hypercalcaemia have now been delineated. A 
number of different cytokines have been impli-
cated in the development of hypercalcaemia as a 
result of local osteolysis. These osteoclast - activat-
ing factors, which are released locally by metastatic 
tumour and stimulate osteoclastic resorption of 
bone, include prostaglandin E2, tumour necrosis 
factors alpha (TNF - α ) and beta (TNF - β ), epidermal 
growth factor and transforming growth factor beta 
(TGF - β ). It is probable that interleukin 1, epidermal 
growth factor and the tumour necrosis factors are 
the most important of these aetiological agents as 
the release of macrophage colony - stimulating 
factor by osteoblasts is enhanced by these factors. 
Since osteoclasts are derived from a haemat opoietic 
stem cell progenitor, this release of macrophage 
colony - stimulating factor may be fundamental to 
oestoclastic bone resorption. 
 Humoral hypercalcaemia was described in 1941 
by Albright but it was only in the late 1980s that 
the humoral factor causing hypercalcaemia was 
characterized. In the 1970s hypercalcaemia was 
thought to result from the ectopic production of 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) but this hypothesis 
remained unproven because the use of PTH antis-
era failed to demonstrate excessive secretion of 
PTH in patients with humoral hypercalcaemia. In 
addition, low serum concentrations of 1,25 -
 vitamin D3 and urinary cyclic adenosine mono-
phosphate (AMP) levels failed to reﬂ ect excess PTH 
activity and no PTH mRNA was found in the 
tumours of patients with humoral hypercalcaemia. 
 In the late 1980s polyadenylated RNA from a 
renal carcinoma from a patient with this syndrome 
was used to construct a cDNA library which was 
screened with a codon - preference oligonucleotide, 
synthesized on the basis of a partial  N - terminal

made by biochemical investigation so all sympto-
matic patients with malignancy should have their

 The mainstay of therapy is rehydration with 
large volumes of intravenous ﬂ uids followed by the 
administration of calcium - lowering agents, most 
commonly bisphosphonates. Low calcium diets 
are unpalatable, exacerbate malnutrition and have 
no place in palliative therapy. Drugs promoting 
hypercalcaemia (e.g. thiazide diuretics, vitamins A 
and D) should be withdrawn. The cornerstone of 
the re - establishment of normocalcaemia is treat-
ment with a bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates 
have multiple functions in hypercalcaemia. They 
reduce serum calcium levels by a direct effect 
on the osteoclast, by stabilizing hydroxyapatite 
crystals. There are two classes of effect of bisphos-
phonates. One group of bisphosphonates, which 
include clodronate and etidronate, acts through 
their incorporation into non - hydrolyzable ana-
logues of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that accu-
mulate in osteoclasts and induce apoptosis. 
Alternately, agents such as pamidronate and 
zoledronate inhibit an enzyme called FPP synthase 
which functions in the mevalonate pathway. This 
leads to inhibition of protein prenylation. The 
bisphosphonates of choice are currently pamidro-
nate, zoledronate and ibandronate. Approximately 
80% of patients respond to hydration and bisphos-
phonate treatment by normalization of serum 
calcium levels. Calcium levels start to normalize 
amino acid sequence from a human tumour -
 derived peptide and a 2.0 kilobase cDNA was iden-
tiﬁ ed. The cDNA encoded a 177 amino acid 
prohormone, which consisted of a 36 amino acid 
leader sequence that is cleaved to produce a 141 
amino acid, mature peptide and PTH - related 
peptide. The ﬁ rst 13 amino acids of the mature 
peptide have a sequence homology with PTH, and 
the  N - terminal sequence is thought to be the PTH 
receptor - binding region. PTH - related peptide was 
found to be expressed in most normal human 
tissue, where its role is undetermined. The gene for 
PTH - related peptide has been mapped to the short 
arm of chromosome 12 and this is in contrast to 
the PTH gene which has been mapped to the short 
arm of chromosome 11. The gene for PTH - related 
peptide is complex and contains a six exon, 12 
kilobase, single copy sequence, encoding up to ﬁ ve 
mRNA species. Exons 2, 3 and 4 are similar to the 
PTH gene. 
 A radioimmunoassay for PTH - related peptide 
was used to screen patients with hypercalcaemia -
 associated malignancy and the results contrasted 
with patients who were normocalcaemic and had 
malignant disease, patients with primary hyper-
parathyroidism and normal controls. PTH - related 
peptide was elevated in 19 of 39 (49%) patients 
with malignant hypercalcaemia, 12 of 74 (16%) 
normocalcaemic patients with malignancy, and 
four of 20 patients (20%) with hyperparathy-
roidism, but in none of 22 normal controls. 
 The clinical manifestations of hypercalcaemia 
are varied (Table  46.1 ) and many symptoms may 
be wrongly attributed to the underlying malig-
nancy. A diagnosis of hypercalcaemia can only be

thrombus. Collateral circulation via the azygous 
vein may provide some drainage and over a period 
of weeks collaterals may form over the chest wall. 
In this case the ﬂ ow of blood in these collateral 
veins will be from above downwards into the infe-
rior vena cava circulation and this may be demon-
strated clinically as an aid to conﬁ rm the 
diagnosis. 
 The presenting symptoms of SVCO include dys-
pnoea, swelling of the face and arms, headaches, a 
choking sensation, cough and chest pain (see Plate 
 46.1 ). The most important clinical sign is loss of 
venous pulsations in the distended neck veins. 
This is usually accompanied by facial oedema, 
plethora and cyanosis, and tachypnoea. The sever-
ity of the symptoms is determined by the rate of 
obstruction and the development of a compensa-
tory collateral circulation. The symptoms may 
deteriorate when lying ﬂ at or bending, which 
further compromises the obstructed venous return. 
Careful assessment of the patient ’ s history is fre-
quently suggestive of a long period with minor 
symptoms of SVCO. In 9 out of 10 cases, the cause 
of SVCO is a malignancy, most often lung cancer 
(disproportionately more often small cell lung 
cancer) (Figure  46.1 ), lymphoma or metastatic 
breast or germ cell cancer. Rare non - malignant 
causes are listed in Table  46.2 . 
within the ﬁ rst 24 hours of treatment with bisphos-
phonates and reach normal levels usually within 
three days. It is a dogma that treatment with 
bisphosphonates has to be repeated, usually on a 
three to four - weekly cycle. However, there is some 
information that suggests that a single treatment 
may be sufﬁ cient with re - setting of the calcium -
 stabilizing mechanisms. As well as these actions, 
bisphosphonates have valuable analgesic activity 
in patients with metastatic bone pain and reduce 
skeletal morbidity in patients with breast cancer 
and myeloma. In 20% of patients with hypercal-
caemia, bisphosphonates do not work. Alternative 
treatments include the use of a somatostatin ana-
logue such as octreotide which acts to reduce 
serum levels of PTHr - related peptide. Other more 
old fashioned treatments include calcitonin and 
mithramycin. 
 Superior  v ena  c ava  o bstruction 
 Superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO) restricts 
the venous return from the upper body resulting in 
oedema of the arms and face, distension of the 
neck and arm veins, headaches and a dusky blue 
skin discoloration over the upper chest, arms and 
face. SVCO is caused by a mediastinal mass com-
pressing the vessel with or without intraluminal

tumour has been obtained chemotherapy may be 
the optimal initial treatment. 
 For patients with recurrent SVCO, or in those 
where other therapeutic modalities are unsuitable, 
insertion of expandable wire stents under radio-
logical guidance can be effective (Figure  46.2 ). 
Studies report instantaneous symptomatic relief 
with an excellent response rate. Although bypass 
of the obstruction has been performed surgically, 
this is usually reserved for patients with benign 
disorders. For central venous access catheter - 
associated thrombosis, removal of the line and 
anticoagulation should be commenced. The 
administration of low - dose warfarin has been 
reported to reduce the incidence of thrombosis 
associated with central venous access catheters.  
 Spinal  c ord  c ompression 
 Spinal cord compression is a relatively common 
complication of disseminated cancer and affects 
5% of patients with cancer. Spinal cord com-
pression occurs with many tumour types but is 
particularly frequent in myeloma and prostate 
cancer. Up to 30% of these patients will survive for 
one year, so it is essential to be spared paraplegia 
for this remaining time by making the diagnosis 
swiftly and instituting treatment quickly. In 
general, the residual neurological deﬁ cit reﬂ ects 
the extent of deﬁ cit at the start of treatment, so 
early treatment leaves less damage. Neoplastic cord 
compression is nearly always due to extramedul-
lary, extradural metastases usually from breast, 
lung, prostate, lymphoma or renal cancers. Com-
monly compression occurs by posterior expansion 
of vertebral metastases or extension of paraspinal 
metastases through the intervertebral foramina. 
These result in demyelination, arterial compro-
mise, venous occlusion and vasogenic oedema of 
the spinal cord, all contributing to myelopathy; 
70% occur in the thoracic spine, 20% in the lumbar 
spine and 10% in the cervical spine. 
 The earliest symptom of cord compression is ver-
tebral pain, especially on coughing and lying ﬂ at. 
Subsequent signs include sensory changes one or 
two dermatomes below the level of compression. A 
complaint of back pain with focal weakness and

 The management of SVCO depends upon the 
cause and severity, along with the patient ’ s prog-
nosis, and includes relieving symptoms as well as 
treating the underlying cause. SVCO is an onco-
logical emergency in the presence of airway com-
promise and delays whilst histological ﬁ ndings are 
conﬁ rmed may adversely affect the outcome. In 
such circumstances patients are treated empirically 
with steroids and radiotherapy. However, when it 
is safe to do so, it is important to establish the diag-
nosis as this will determine the optimum treatment 
and a delay of one to two days to obtain a histologi-
cal diagnosis is often appropriate, particularly in 
the context of a patient with minor symptoms and 
a long clinical history. Diagnostic procedures 
should include a plain chest X - ray (CXR), sputum 
cytology, bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy or medi-
astinoscopy, computed tomography (CT) scans or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and venogra-
phy. A palpable lymph node may be amenable to 
biopsy, thereby providing a diagnosis. 
 Patients may respond to being sat upright with 
oxygen therapy and intravenous corticosteroids 
should be administered. In the majority of cases 
radiotherapy is the most appropriate treatment 
modality and relieves symptoms in up to 90% of 
patients within a fortnight. Where a diagnosis of 
lymphoma, small cell lung cancer or germ cell

bladder or bowel dysfunction with a sensory level 
requires urgent investigation in a patient with 
cancer. This will progress to motor weakness distal 
to the block and ﬁ nally sphincter disturbance. If 
spinal cord compression is missed, or left untreated, 
patients can develop severe neurological deﬁ cits 
and double incontinence. 
 Spinal cord compression should be treated as a 
medical emergency. High - dose intravenous corti-
costeroids should be initiated on clinical suspicion 
alone to prevent further evolution of neurological 
deﬁ cit. Plain X - rays of the spine looking for verte-
bral collapse and MRI of the spinal axis to deﬁ ne 
the presence and level(s) of spinal cord compres-
sion should then be performed (Figures  46.3 – 46.5 ). 
20 to 30% of patients have multiple levels of cord 
compression and imaging of the whole cord is 
therefore essential. If appropriate, a neurosurgical 
opinion should be obtained regarding the poten-
tial of surgical decompression, especially if there is 
vertebral instability or if the level of the compres-
sion has been previously irradiated. Otherwise, the 
deﬁ nitive treatment is urgent local radiotherapy. It 
is important to provide adequate analgesia. Pre-
treatment ambulatory function is the main deter-
minant of post - treatment gait function, thus 
prompt diagnosis and treatment is the key to gait 
and continence preservation.  
 Malignant  e ffusions 
 Pleural  e ffusions 
 Although not strictly an emergency, approxi-
mately 40% of all pleural effusions are due to 
malignancy (Table  46.3 ) and it frequently indi-
cates advanced and incurable disease. The pleural 
space is normally ﬁ lled with 10 - 40   ml of hypopro-
teinaceous plasma that originates from the capil-
lary bed of the parietal pleura and is drained 
through the parietal pleura lymphatics. A pleural 
effusion is often the ﬁ rst manifestation of malig-
nancy, and lung cancer and breast cancer account 
for almost two - thirds of cases. Malignant pleural 
effusions may be asymptomatic or cause progres-
sive dyspnoea, cough and chest pain which may be 
pleuritic in nature. Malignant pleural effusions are 
usually exudates and this may be conﬁ rmed by a 
ﬂ uid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of  > 200   U/ml, a 
ﬂ uid   :  serum LDH ratio  > 0.6, a ﬂ uid   :  serum protein

ratio  > 0.5 and a ﬂ uid   :  serum glucose ratio of  < 0.5. 
The ﬂ uid may be blood stained and is typically 
hypercellular, containing lymphocytes, mono-
cytes and reactive mesothelial cells; exfoliated 
tumour cells may be present also.  
 The management of malignant effusions should 
be tailored to the patient ’ s symptoms as only half 
the patients will be alive at 3 months and over 90% 
of effusions will recur within 30 days of thoraco-
centesis. Reaccumulation of pleural effusions may 
be delayed by chemical pleurodesis (usually using 
talc or tetracycline) or video - assisted thoracic 
surgery (VATS) with pleurectomy and/or talc insuf-
ﬂ ation. Pleuroperitoneal shunts or chronic ind-
welling catheters may be considered for patients 
who fail pleurodesis, but this is rarely appropriate.  
 Pericardial  e ffusions 
 The accumulation of ﬂ uid in the pericardial 
space around the heart may adversely affect cardiac 
function and like all effusions may be transudate, 
exudate or haemorrhage. Cardiac tamponade 
occurs when the pressure on the ventricles in

diastole prevents them from ﬁ lling, thus reducing 
the stroke volume and cardiac output. The classic 
sign of cardiac tamponade is Beck ’ s triad of hypo-
tension because of decreased stroke volume, jugu-
lar – venous distension due to impaired venous 
return to the heart, and mufﬂ ed heart sounds due 
to ﬂ uid inside the pericardium (Figure  46.6 ). 
 Ascites 
 The most frequent malignancies causing ascites are 
primary tumours of the ovaries, pancreas, stomach 
and colon, breast and lungs. The distressing symp-
toms of ascites include abdominal distension or 
pain, dyspnoea due to diaphragmatic splinting, 
oedema of the legs, perineum and lower trunk, and 
a  ‘ squashed stomach syndrome ’ leading to ano-
rexia. If these symptoms are distressing, paracente-
sis is indicated  – it offers rapid symptom relief but 
poor long - term control. Whilst anticancer therapy 
may reduce the subsequent reaccumulation of 
ascites, if this is not an option or is unsuccessful, 
diuretics may be helpful. Rarely a peritoneovenous 
shunt may be surgically placed under general 
anaesthetic if the ascites cannot be controlled.  
 Tumour  l ysis  s yndrome 
 The acute destruction of a large number of cells is 
associated with metabolic sequelae, and is termed 
the  ‘ tumour lysis syndrome ’ . Cell destruction 
results in the release of different chemicals into the 
circulation, some of which may cause profound 
complications. Electrolyte release may cause tran-
sient hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and 
hyperkalaemia. The release of calcium and phos-
phate into the blood stream rarely causes any sig-
niﬁ cant consequences. However, the calcium and 
phosphate may co - precipitate and cause some 
impairment of renal function. Hyperkalaemia can 
be a much more signiﬁ cant problem and may man-
ifest as minor electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormal-

ities which, of course, all students reading this 
book can describe in intimate and complex detail 
(Table  46.4 ). Even more signiﬁ cant, however, are 
the cardiac arrhythmias, which may include ven-
tricular tachycardia or ventricular ﬁ brillation, and 
which may lead to the demise of the patient. 
Nucleic acid breakdown leads to hyperuricaemia 
and this, unless treated appropriately, can be com-
plicated by renal failure due to the precipitation of 
uric acid crystals in the renal tubular system. So, of 
course, it is best that these things do not happen 
because we do not like our patients dying, least of 
all because of the complications of the treatment 
that we give them.  
 There are certain malignancies whose treatment 
is associated with a higher than usual risk of 
tumour lysis syndrome and these include acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia and high - grade lympho-
mas. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia 
can develop the tumour lysis syndrome, with 
minor trauma to the patient, or even infection. In 
this instance there is a release of pro - coagulants 
from blast cells with the risk of a devastating coag-
ulopathy. Patients with high - grade T - cell lympho-
mas may also be at risk from circumstances where 
one would not normally expect there to be a 
problem. For example, if these patients are started 
on steroids, they may develop tumour lysis because 
steroids have cytotoxic qualities in lymphoma. 
In these malignancies the risk of tumour lysis 
syndrome is pre - empted by a cunning pretreat-
ment plan. Patients are started two days prior to

chemotherapy or radiation therapy with allopuri-
nol. The day before treatment intravenous hydra-
tion is started, and these efforts generally prevent 
the development of tumour lysis syndrome. Many 
clinicians advise alkalinization of the urine. 
However, in practice it is very difﬁ cult to achieve 
an alkaline urine and there are signiﬁ cant dangers 
inherent in the use of signiﬁ cant amounts of 
sodium bicarbonate. A proportion of patients will 
go on to develop tumour lysis syndrome despite 
these measures. For this reason patients who are 
treated require careful monitoring with two - hourly 
measurement of serum potassium levels for the 
ﬁ rst 8 – 12 hours of treatment. Many clinicians will 
also advise ECG monitoring but it is our experience 
that these monitors are generally not observed to 
best effect. A new drug has become recently avail-
able for the treatment of this condition. Recom-
binant urate oxidase (rasburicase) converts uric 
acid, which is insoluble, into allantoin, which is. 
Clinical trials have shown that urate oxidase con-
trols hyperuricaemia faster and more reliably than 
allopurinol, and its use is indicated in children and 
haematological malignancy.  
 Hyperviscosity  s yndrome 
 Blood hyperviscosity can be caused by too much 
protein or too many cells in the blood. The clinical 
features include spontaneous bleeding from 
mucous 
membranes, 
retinopathy, 
headache, 
vertigo, coma and seizures. The most frequent 
causes of excess proteins are monoclonal parapro-
teinaemias such as Waldrenstr ö m ’ s macroglobuli-
naemia (IgM) and myeloma (especially IgA and 
IgG3 myelomas). Hyperviscosity due to excess cell 
counts occurs in acute leukaemia blast crises. The 
retinopathy resembles retinal vein occlusion with 
dilated retinal veins and retinal haemorrhages. The 
serum viscosity may be measured (normal range: 
0.14 – 0.18   cPa/s), but treatment of suspected hyper-
viscosity should be started before the results are 
available as they often take days to come back. 
Plasmapheresis should be used to decrease hyper-
viscosity related to excess proteins, whilst leuka-
pheresis removes excess leukaemic blasts before 
deﬁ nitive treatment can begin.  
 Myelosuppression 
 Neutropenia 
 We explain to our patients that chemotherapy 
puts them at risk of developing bone marrow sup-
pression, as cancer treatments kill  ‘ good ’  as well as 
 ‘ bad ’ cells. In this case the  ‘ good ’  cells are the hae-
matological progenitor cells and patients are at risk 
of death if the effects of treatment upon the bone 
marrow are not recognized. Neutropenic sepsis is 
very common in cancer treatment and, if undiag-

tamponade. The clinical symptoms include dyspnoea and cough and the signs are hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus para-
doxus (fall of systolic blood pressure of  > 10   mmHg on inspiration), quiet mufﬂ ed heart sounds and a raised jugular – venous 
pressure (JVP) with Kussmaul ’ s sign (paradoxical rise in JVP on inspiration). The electrocardiograph may show pulsus alter-
nans (alternating QRS voltages). The emergency treatment is by pericardiocentesis and a subsequent surgical formation of 
a pericardial window to prevent recurrence may be necessary.  
nosed, leads to a mortality rate approaching 20 –
 30%. Patients with neutropenic sepsis develop 
fevers and rigors with associated oral ulceration 
and candidiasis. It is standard practice for patients 
with neutropenic sepsis  – which is deﬁ ned by 
septic symptoms in the presence of a white count 
that is  < 1.0   ×  10 9 /l  – to be admitted to hospital. The 
patient is resuscitated with intravenous ﬂ uids and 
blood cultures are taken. In the absence of any 
obvious focus of infection, such as the urinary 
tract, the advantage of culturing from sites other 
than blood is virtually zero. Cultures from other

agent used to be considered prohibitive, however it 
may become relatively more affordable as the cost 
of blood is widely predicted to increase signiﬁ -
cantly because of the increased costs of testing 
blood for infective agents such as Creutzfeldt –
 Jakob disease (CJD). The pharmaceutical industry 
markets erythropoietin for its effect upon the 
asthenia related to cancer treatment; claims are 
made for a far greater improvement in cancer 
fatigue than haemoglobin level.  
 Thrombocytopenia 
 Thrombocytopenia is not as signiﬁ cant a problem 
in the treatment of solid tumours as it is in the 
treatment of haematological malignancies. There 
is a signiﬁ cant risk of spontaneous major haemor-
rhage as the platelet count declines below 10 –
 20    ×  10 9 /l and most oncologists advocate 
prophylactic platelet transfusions at this level or in 
the presence of bleeding. There are a number of 
regulatory molecules that stimulate early haemat-
opoietic progenitors and these include the inter-
leukins IL - 1, IL - 6 and IL - 11. IL - 1 and IL - 6 have 
poor efﬁ cacy and signiﬁ cant toxicity, but IL - 11 has 
been licensed for the prevention of chemotherapy -
 induced thrombocytopenia. The pharmaceutical 
industry continues to develop agents for the treat-
ment of thrombocytopenia, and the focus recently 
has been on analogues of thrombopoietin, which 
appear to have more efﬁ cacy and less toxicity than 
the interleukins.  
 Cancer - r elated  t hromboses 
 Patients with cancer have an increased tendency to 
thrombosis, a problem that was ﬁ rst documented 
by Trousseau, who sadly went on to develop 
venous thromboses himself and died from cancer. 
Patients with cancer have an increased risk of 
developing thromboses for two major reasons. The 
ﬁ rst may be a pressure effect, where the primary 
tumour mass or secondary nodal masses impinge 
upon the vasculature, producing venous stasis 
and thrombosis. The second reason for the 
increased risk is the release from the tumour of 
pro - coagulants. A number of tissue pro - coagulants 
sites merely act to swamp the microbiology lab 
with unnecessary requests for culture work without 
yielding any positive advantage. Just 20% of blood 
cultures from patients with neutropenic sepsis are 
positive for bacterial organisms. The cause for 
infection is generally not clear. 
 Antibiotic policies vary from hospital to hospital 
but there is good evidence that treatment with 
single - agent ceftazidime is as effective as treatment 
with combination antibiotic regimens. In the UK 
patients are generally admitted, though it is inter-
esting to note that this conservative management 
policy is not strictly necessary. In one randomized 
study, treatment with oral ciproﬂ oxacin in the 
community was compared with inpatient treat-
ment with intravenous ceftazidime. The results 
were absolutely identical in terms of control of 
fever and patient outcome. 
 Over the last decade marrow growth factors have 
become available and granulocyte colony - stimu-
lating factor (G - CSF), which stimulates the marrow 
to produce granulocytes, has entered wide use. 
There is no evidence that prophylactic use of G - CSF 
in any way prevents neutropenic sepsis or septic 
deaths. The evidence for its use in established infec-
tion is poor and the consensus view is that G - CSF is 
of value only in patients with established neutro-
penic sepsis who have a non - recovering marrow 
and in whom, additionally, an infective agent has 
been identiﬁ ed. G - CSF is of enormous value in 
transplantation programmes, where the mean 
period of time to engraftment has been reduced 
from 28 to 18 days by the use of these agents.  
 Anaemia 
 Anaemia is a very common complication of cancer 
and its treatment. It is estimated that up to 30% of 
all cancer patients will require a transfusion. In 
general, anaemia is cumulative and builds up over 
several cycles of chemotherapy. Recombinant 
erythropoietin is considered to be a valuable alter-
native to blood transfusion. The response of 
patients to erythropoietin is wide ranging and 
reported at between 20% and 60%. Haemoglobin 
levels increase after about six weeks of treatment 
with recombinant erythropoietin. The price of this

have been described, ranging from factors S and C 
to the current view that activated factor 10 is 
released by tumours, which sparks off the clotting 
cascade. 
 The incidence of venous thrombosis and throm-
boembolism in cancer patients is variably reported. 
One study looked at a group of patients presenting 
with deep venous thromboses (DVTs). Screening of 
these patients showed that almost 30% had a 
cancer that was most commonly a pelvic malig-
nancy. As always in medicine, there is initial posi-
tive reporting, and later studies showed the true 
incidence of previously undetected cancer in 
patients presenting with venous thrombosis to 
be in the order of 5%. Once cancer has been 
diagnosed, thromboembolic events are remarkably 
common and described in about 10% of all 
patients. The incidence increases signiﬁ cantly 

Oncological emergencies Chapter 46
267
when long lines are inserted in cancer patients for 
the purposes of chemotherapy or supportive care. 
In this group of patients the incidence of throm-
boembolism increases to 20%. For this reason 
prophylaxis with low - dose warfarin is recom-
mended and this decreases the risk of subsequent 
thrombosis to between 2% and 5%. These statis-
tics, however, are considered controversial and are 
debated endlessly. Because of the high risk of 
thrombosis in cancer patients it has been suggested 
that anticoagulation should be prophylactically 
prescribed. Logically, the best way of preventing 
thromboembolism would be with a heparin - like 
compound rather than with a coumarin. At the 
moment the evidence is that the low molecular 
weight heparins are probably more effective than 
warfarin in the prophylaxis of thromboembolism. 
There is an additional unexpected beneﬁ t to anti-
coagulation with low molecular weight heparins, 
and this is a modest survival advantage for patients, 
as demonstrated by randomized clinical trials. In 
some patients with pelvic tumours and recurrent 
thromboses, ﬁ lters may be inserted into the infe-

 Amongst the most important elements of onco-
logical care is recognizing shifting goals as the 
cancer progresses. The balance of beneﬁ t and side 
effects of any intervention should be carefully 
weighed up. Whilst neurosurgical resection of soli-
tary metastases from melanoma may be appropri-
ate in some circumstances, venepuncture for 
measuring the serum electrolytes in a dying patient 
is rarely justiﬁ able. These decisions should involve 
the patients wherever possible and require skilful 
use of communication. Throughout the cancer 
journey patients often enquire about their life 
expectancy and there is a temptation for clinicians 
to pluck some ﬁ gure out of the air. An intelligent 
doctor will recognize the pitfalls of prognostica-
tion when applied to an individual and will appre-
ciate that the median survival (the statistic most 
relevant in this circumstance) is the time when 
half the patients will still be alive. Stephen J. Gould, 
the evolutionary palaeontologist, explained this 
from a patient ’ s perspective in the essay  ‘ The 
median is not the message ’ published in the collec-
tion  Bully for Brontosaurus . During the patient ’ s 
journey with cancer a number of emotions are 
experienced and these may follow a stepwise suc-
cession originally described by the Swiss psy-
chologist Elisabeth Kubler Ross. In her 1969 book 
 On Death and Dying  she records the stages as 
denial, anger, bargaining, grieving and ﬁ nally 
acceptance. 
 As the cancer progresses and the patient deterio-
rates, it is important that reviews are frequent and 
that problems are anticipated. This close follow - up 
is often best undertaken in the community by 
community palliative care services rather than 
bringing patients up to hospital or GP surgeries for 
regular appointments, but this approach requires 
excellent communication between all the health 
professionals involved. This may be facilitated by 
patient - held records similar to those used in shared 
care obstetrics. The anticipation of symptoms, 
including pain and diminishing mobility, should 
be addressed in advance so that analgesia is quickly 
available to patients.  
 Pain  c ontrol 
 Nerve endings, or nociceptors, exist in all tissues 
and are stimulated by noxious agents including 
chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli, giving 
rise to pain (Table  47.1 ). These stimuli are relayed 
by A β , A δ (fast transmitting ﬁ bres) and C (slow 
transmission of sensation) sensory nerve ﬁ bres to 
the dorsal horns of the spinal cord and different 
qualities of pain may use different sensory ﬁ bres.  
 Analgesic drugs form the mainstay of treating 
cancer pain and should be chosen based on the 
severity of the pain rather than the stage of the

prevent pain using a stepwise escalation from non -
 opioid, to weak opioid and strong opioid analgesia 
(Figure  47.1 ). Adjuvant drugs may be added at any 
stage of the analgesic ladder as they may have addi-
tional analgesic effect in some painful conditions. 
Examples of adjuvant analgesics are corticoster-
oids, non - steroidal anti - inﬂ ammatory drugs, tricy-
clic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and some 
anti - arrythmic drugs. Morphine is the most com-
monly used strong opioid analgesic and whenever 
possible should be given by mouth. The dose of 
morphine needs to be tailored to each patient and 
be repeated at regular intervals so that the pain 
does not return between doses. There is no upper 
dose limit for morphine; however, a number of 
myths have arisen around opioid prescribing that 
may deter prescribers as well as patients. Firstly, 
opioid tolerance is rarely seen in patients with 
cancer pain and neither psychological dependence 
nor addiction is a problem in this patient group. 
The toxicity of opioids may prove to be an obstacle 
for some patients (Table  47.2 ). Sedation is common 
at the start of opioid therapy but resolves in most 
patients within a few days. Similarly, nausea and 
vomiting may prove troublesome at the start of 
regular opioid dosing but usually dissipate within a 
few days and may be controlled with anti - emetics. 
Constipation develops in almost all patients on 
opioids and this toxicity persists and necessitates 
routine prophylactic laxatives for almost everyone 
receiving opioids. A careful explanation of these 
issues will result in the acceptance of opioid anal-
gesia by almost all patients.  
 Care of the  d ying  p atient 
 The continuing attention to the needs and comfort 
of a dying patient is as important as the care given 
to any other patient and part of that care includes 
reducing the distress of relatives. Many issues may 
be raised by relatives that pose ethical dilemmas 
and these may make you question the therapy that 
has been or should be given. Amongst the most 

Chapter 47 End of life care
270
unnecessary medications should be stopped. Often 
the best method of delivering analgesia, anti - emet-
ics and sedation, if appropriate, is via a subcutane-
ous syringe driver. Similarly, oral secretions 
accumulating in a patient who is too weak to 
cough may be distressing to the patient and family 
alike. Drug treatment for terminal secretions 
includes hyoscine hydrobromide and glycopyrro-
nium bromide, which is less sedating. It is impor-
tant to recall that not all patients wish to be sedated 
and this should be discussed with them and their 
families. 
 The  l ast  h ours and  d ays 
 For many patients with cancer the last hours and 
days are heralded by a deterioration to semicon-
sciousness. At this time patients are usually unable 
to take oral medication and prescriptions need 
to be reconsidered. Many medicines may be 
stopped altogether and alternative routes of 
administration, including subcutaneous, rectal 
and transdermal routes, may be employed for 
other necessary medications including analgesia. 
Although patients may no longer be receiving 
medicines by mouth, oral hygiene remains an 
important part of overall care. It is particularly 
important to avoid unnecessary unpleasant inter-
ventions at this time and to adopt a practical prob-
lem - oriented approach to symptom control. A 
practical guide to the care of the dying patient in a 
hospital was developed at the Royal Liverpool Hos-
pital in conjunction with Marie Curie Cancer Care 
to transfer best practice learnt from hospice care. 
The Liverpool Care of the Dying Pathway helps 
members of the multidisciplinary team in making 
a decision about which medical interventions 
should be stopped and which continued (includ-
ing anticipatory prescribing) and what comfort 
measures should be started. It also promotes psy-
chological support of the patients, family and 
carers as well as addressing spiritual needs and 
bereavement. There has been debate recently 
about the value of the Liverpool Pathway, with 
some critics suggesting that it is a one - way road 
that sanitizes and precipitates the process of dying 
without allowing thought or revison of decisions. 
frequent scenarios is the role of intravenous hydra-
tion, evaluating the balance between painful can-
nulation and restriction of mobility versus an 
uncomfortable dry mouth and thirst. To address 
these questions you should consider whether 
death from the cancer is now inevitable, whether 
interventions 
would 
relieve 
symptoms 
and 
whether treatment would cause harm. Careful 
explanation to the relatives is essential; in this cir-
cumstance, for example, they need to be reassured 
that the patient is not dying because of dehydra-
tion but rather because of progression of the 
cancer. 
 Symptom control in the dying patient often 
requires a different route of administration as swal-
lowing may be difﬁ cult and agitation and restless-
ness are often prominent features as death 
approaches. A number of factors may contribute to 
terminal agitation including physical causes such 
as pain, sore mouth and full bladder or rectum, 
along with emotional factors including fear of 
dying and the distress of relatives. The physical 
causes should be addressed appropriately and

 When death is inevitable, as it is for all of us, and 
is approaching rapidly it is the policy in many UK 
hospitals to discuss resuscitation policies with 
patients and their relatives. Under these circum-
stances resuscitation is rarely appropriate and, if 
deemed futile, the lead clinician may make a DNAR 
(do not attempt resuscitation) decision. These 
DNAR decisions should be discussed with patients 
who wish to engage in advanced care planning. 
However, prolonged discussions about DNAR poli-
cies with patients who do not wish to contemplate 
their future are, in the view of these authors, dis-
tressing and irrelevant. The reason for our auto-
cratic view is that cardiac resuscitation cannot 
return the patient who has died from cancer from 
his journey across the River Styx, and it causes dis-
tress in the relatives and the arrest team.  
 Bereavement 
 Bereavement care and support includes recogniz-
ing the physical and emotional needs of families 
and carers and continues after the patient ’ s death. 
A number of features have been identiﬁ ed that are 
associated with the risk of severe bereavement 
reactions (Table  47.3 ), and the recognition of these 
risks prior to death can allow planning of care for 
those left behind after the death. Health profes-
sionals are not immune to bereavement, or at least 
the good ones are not, and our need for support 
should not be ignored.  
 The  c ulture of  d eath and  d ying 
 Just as different cultures, regardless of the scientiﬁ c 
evidence, have developed distinct explanations for

 Box 47.1:   Jewish mourners ’ Kaddish 
prayer 
 Gloriﬁ ed and sanctiﬁ ed be God ’ s great name throughout 
the world which He has created according to His will. 
May He establish His kingdom in your lifetime and during 
your days, and within the life of the entire House of 
Israel, speedily and soon; and say, Amen.  
 May His great name be blessed forever and to all eter-
nity. Blessed and praised, gloriﬁ ed and exalted, extolled 
and honoured, adored and lauded be the name of the 
Holy One, blessed be He, beyond all the blessings and 
hymns, praises and consolations that are ever spoken in 
the world; and say, Amen.  
 May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life, 
for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen.  
 He who creates peace in His celestial heights, may He 
create peace for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen.  
 With a strong belief in an afterlife, mourning practices 
in Judaism are extensive, but are not an expression of 
fear of death. Instead they aim to show respect for the 
dead and to comfort the living. As an expression of 
respect, following death the body is never left alone and 
on hearing of the death, friends and relatives tear a 
portion of their clothes. Burial is prompt, within 2 days, 
and is followed by 7 days of mourning (shiva). Mourners 
sit on low stools or the ﬂ oor instead of chairs, do not 
wear leather shoes, do not shave or cut their hair, do not 
wear cosmetics, do not work and do not do things for 
comfort or pleasure, such as bathe, have sex or put on 
fresh clothing. Mourners wear the clothes that they tore 
at the time of learning of the death and mirrors in the 
house are covered. The Jewish Kaddish prayer is recited 
for the ﬁ rst 11 months following a death by identiﬁ ed 
mourners and on each anniversary of the death 
(Yahrzeit). It is remarkable that there is no reference to 
death in the prayer but rather it focuses on the greatness 
of God and on a call for peace. 
the origins of life ranging from Big Bangs and evo-
lution to creationist genesis, similar cultural varia-
tions affect attitudes to death. For example, 
Christians, Jews (Box  47.1 ) and Suﬁ s believe in 
resurrection whilst Hindi, Buddhists (Box  47.2 ) 
and Sikhs believe in reincarnation. These cultural 
discrepancies must be recognized and respected, 
particularly where patients ’ and carers ’ views 
differ.

 Box 47.2:   The  Tibetan Book of the Dead  (bardo thodol) 
 A fundamental tenet of Buddhism is that death is not something that awaits us in some distant future, but something 
that we bring with us into the world and that accompanies us throughout our lives. Rather than a ﬁ nality, death offers a 
unique opportunity for spiritual growth with the ultimate prospect of transformation into an immortal state of beneﬁ t 
to others. Among Tibet ’ s many and varied religious traditions are esoteric teachings that address compassionate death 
including the  Tibetan Books of the Dead . These popular texts are manuals of practical instructions for the dying, who are 
immediately facing death; for those who have died, who are wandering in the intermediate state between lives; and for 
the living, who are left behind to continue without their loved ones. 
 Before death, friends and relatives are encouraged to bid farewell without excess drama so that neither regret nor 
longing is experienced by the dying as their state of mind at death must be positive. This may be facilitated by a spiritual 
master (lama) whispering guiding instructions from  Liberation Through Hearing during the Intermediate State  commonly 
known as the  Tibetan Book of the Dead into the dying person ’ s ear. 
 Tibetan Buddhism recognizes that spiritual growth may be derived from acknowledging death and proposes detailed 
meditation strategies that relate to the acceptance of death in order to comprehend the nature of human existence. Four 
human life cycle stages are recognized: birth, the period between birth and death, death, and the interval between death 
and rebirth (the bardo). This post - mortem bardo lasts seven weeks and is followed by rebirth into a worldly state that is 
inﬂ uenced by past actions or karma. The cycle of rebirth (samsara) may be broken by enlightenment, culminating in the 
ﬁ nal liberation of buddhahood.

 Plate 2.2   Multiple dermal neuroﬁ bromata typical 
of peripheral neuroﬁ bromatosis or type 1 NF, 
previously known eponymously as von Reckling-
hausen ’ s disease. It is due to hereditary mutation 
of the NF1 neuroﬁ bromin gene on chromosome 
2p22, which encodes a guanosine triphosphatase 
(GTPase) activating protein involved in the signal 
transduction cascade.

 Plate 22.1   Umbilical nodule metastasis known as Sister 
Mary Joseph nodule, which usually denotes transcoelomic 
spread from an ovarian or gastric primary. The eponym 
appears to have been given for Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey 
(1856 – 1929) who was a surgical assistant to Dr William 
Mayo. This eponym is one of very few given for a nurse.

immature myeloid cells.  
 Plate 37.1   Peripheral blood ﬁ lm showing rouleaux forma-
tion with erythrocytes stacked up on each other, and a 
single neutrophil. Rouleaux are found at high levels in the 
blood of proteins such as ﬁ brinogen or  γ - globulin. They are 
particularly prominent in diseases that cause a very high 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), such as multiple 
myeloma, cancers, chronic infections (e.g. TB) and connec-
tive tissue diseases.  
 Plate 37.2   Bone marrow aspirate of myeloma showing 
plasma cells with large eccentric nuclei and basophilic 
cytoplasm. 
 Plate 39.1   A large, raised, bleeding skin lesion on the 
pinna, a common site for squamous cell cancers of the skin. 
These tumours are related to UV exposure and may be pre-

represents local recurrence of the melanoma.  
 Plate 40.4   Multiple nodular skin metastases arising from a melanoma of the left calf that had been widely excised 2 years 
earlier, requiring a skin graft.  
 Plate 46.1   An 80 - year - old woman presented with short-
ness of breath, headaches and swollen arms. (a) The CT 
scan shows a large right hilar mass that was small cell lung 
cancer compressing the superior vena cava and collateral 
circulation. (b) The clinical image also shows dilated veins 
on the anterior chest wall due to collateral circulation. The 
ﬂ ow of blood in these veins will be from above as the blood 
is bypassing the obstructed superior vena cava to return via 
the patent inferior vena cava.
