Previously, we asked the question:  
“What is good accuracy?”

•  For binary classiﬁcation: 
- Half the time, you’ll get it right! (on average) 
 è classiﬁcation error = 0.5 
 
•  For k classes, error= 1 - 1/k 
- error = 0.666 for 3 classes, 0.75 for 4 classes,… 
 
©2015-2016 Emily Fox & Carlos Guestrin 
At the very, very, very least,  
you should healthily beat random…  
Otherwise, it’s (usually) pointless… 
We explored accuracy of random classiﬁer as baseline

What you can do now… 
•  Classiﬁcation accuracy/error are not always 
right metrics 
•  Precision captures fraction of positive 
predictions that are correct 
•  Recall captures fraction of positive data 
correctly identiﬁed by the model 
•  Trade-oﬀ precision & recall by setting 
probability thresholds 
•  Plot precision-recall curves. 
•  Compare models by computing precision at k
