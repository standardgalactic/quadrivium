About the Author
Peter H. Gregory, CISA, CISSP, discovered computers in 1976
in his first year at the University of Nevada-Reno. He was taking
a FORTRAN programming course when computer programs
were painstakingly typed in on punch cards (hanging chads
and all). He then got a part-time computer operator job at the
University computer center, where he operated the university’s
mainframe computer, a Control Data Corporation CDC-6400.
His insatiable curiosity about computers led him headlong
into a career that began when he completed his university
education.
Those fancy letters behind Peter’s name: CISSP and CISA, are
two professional security certifications: Certified Information
Systems Security Professional and Certified Information
Systems Auditor. Peter has spent the past eleven years in the
wireless telecommunications industry, working in positions
where he develops security policy, security architecture, secu-
rity emergency response teams, and has been a security con-
sultant in general. His love for personal computers has kept
him attached to one or more of them for twenty years.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to extend thanks to great folks at Trend Micro
(Michael Sweeny in the U.S. and Del Gemmell in Taiwan) and
Panda Software (Alan Wallace in California, Jose Javier
Merchan, and especially Fernando de la Cuadra in Spain), who
provided information as well as dozens of screen shots.
Special thanks go to Jennifer Byrne at Symantec who provided
invaluable feedback on the draft table of contents, resulting in
numerous improvements. Nalleli Lopez Hosek and David
Alderman read the entire draft manuscript and made numer-
ous productive suggestions to make the book easier to read
and understand. Thanks you two! Tim Crothers worked hard
to ensure the technical accuracy of the book.
Special thanks go to Eva Neumann, who provided invaluable
feedback from her perspective as a non-professional com-
puter user. Many thanks to my immediate and extended family
for tolerating the book writing process yet again. I’d like to
dedicate this book to the memory of Ralph Pratt who showed
me how to teach complex subjects to non-technical people.
And thanks be to God, through whom all things are possible.

Computer Viruses For Dummies

Introduction
I
t would be difficult to describe the impact of viruses — and
their cousins Trojan horses and worms — without resort-
ing to clichés or sensationalism. But after all the hoopla, the
bottom line is pretty simple: Malicious people write viruses,
and viruses do bad things to our computers. Over the past
two decades, viruses have caused billions of dollars in damage
and lost productivity — and that’s just the impact on busi-
nesses. Viruses hit home computer users much harder because
home users usually don’t have information-technology sup-
port departments to install and maintain antivirus software
and repair damaged computers.
But viruses can be stopped before they stop us, and it’s not
hard to stop them. Getting antivirus software is part of the 
solution. Using antivirus software is just a matter of doing a
few simple chores to make sure that everything is working cor-
rectly: the better antivirus programs available today do all the
regular tasks automatically, and only rarely do they require you
to do something special.
If the information on your computer is important to you, then
it’s worth protecting. You can do several things to help protect
your computer and the information stored in it. The Internet is
not exactly a friendly place; in fact it can be quite hostile and
unforgiving to those who are unable to protect themselves. But
since you have either purchased or borrowed this book, you’re
on the verge of being able to get rid of the viruses on your
computer and keep them away for good. It’s all within your
grasp!
About This Book
Computer Viruses For Dummies is a reference book, not (believe
it or not) a mystery; you don’t have to read the chapters in
order. Start anywhere you like. Feel free to skip chapters that

Computer Viruses For Dummies 
2
aren’t of immediate interest. Want to start at the last page?
You’re the boss; everybody knows who done it anyway — that
sinister virus.
If you’re looking for particular information, you can go about
it in several ways. You can use the Table of Contents to find
the area of immediate interest. Or, you can look at the Index 
to find a particular word or concept. Finally, at the top of each
page, a running head tells you what chapter and what part of
the book you’re currently in. Feel free to just skip around until
you find the information you seek . . . unless you already have
the queasy feeling that your computer may be infected. Then
your best bet is to “start at the beginning” (as Lewis Carroll
recommends) and explore from there.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five parts so you can find the infor-
mation you need to find — quickly. Here’s a rundown of each
part:
Part I: Evaluating Your 
Virus Situation
This part describes the risk factors associated with contract-
ing computer viruses, ranging from your computing patterns
to whether you take the time to install security patches and
whether you have antivirus software. Next you’ll read the
steps to take to determine whether your computer has a virus,
and whether your computer has properly functioning antivirus
software.
Part II: Deploying Your 
Antivirus Defenses
This is an action-filled part. Here you get a look at where to
shop for antivirus software — and what features to look for
(sorry, no bevawatt lasers for vaporizing virus writers, but
hey, we can dream). I won’t tell you which brand to buy — 
I’d rather help you be a good shopper than pick stuff for you
that may not be what you need. After installing your antivirus

software, there are important steps to take to make sure it
performs all the necessary steps to protect your computer
and your information. Next, you go on a virus hunt, scanning
your computer for viruses and going through the steps that
actually remove a virus if one is found.
Part III: Maintaining 
Your Vigilance
“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” said a distinguished
figure from American history whose name I forget just now.
One modern equivalent is “Eternal updating is the price of
security.” Antivirus software isn’t a magical guardian; you
can’t just install it and then forget it (sorry). Keeping your
antivirus software up to date is what keeps it effective. In
addition, this part looks at some other wise practices that 
are also vital to long-term safe computing, for example: 
 Installing security patches and service packs
 Backing up your data
 Blocking spam and spyware
 Using a hardware or software firewall
 Being smart about not opening certain messages and
about avoiding certain Web sites
If you own a PDA and keep everything in it, this part also offers
some safe practices you can adopt to keep your PDA useful
and your data available — and only for you.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses 
Under the Microscope
The more you know about viruses and the people who write
them, the better you can protect yourself against them.
Viruses got their start in the 1980s, soon after the introduc-
tion of the IBM PC. Since then they have evolved and grown
more sophisticated. Other threats such as Trojan horses,
worms, scams, and hoaxes add to the challenge of keeping
our computers free from harm and saving us from unneces-
sary worry and distraction.
Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
Do you like lists and statistics? Do you want more insight into
viruses and the tools that repel them? This is the place! You’ll
find popular myths about viruses debunked, and common
questions answered. Ten popular antivirus programs are
examined — tools for doing battle with the next round of
notorious viruses.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you need to issue a command in Windows, I show a
command like this: Tools➪Options. In this example, click
Tools from the menu bar at the top of the window, then click
Options from the list. If you don’t see Options in the list, you
might need to press the double-arrow at the bottom of the list
of options to make all the options appear.
When there is a command like Ctrl+Q, do it like this: Hold
down either one of the Ctrl keys, and while still holding it
down, press and release the Q key, then release the Ctrl key.
The Ctrl key works just like a Shift key.
What You’re Not to Read
. . . unless, of course, you find ’em interesting . . . are the gray
boxes (called sidebars) and icons that denote technical infor-
mation. They’re dribbled throughout this book; you can feel
free to skip these treatises at will. Some actually have some
interesting information, though, so feel free to read ’em
anyway. If I really felt that you didn’t need to know this stuff, I
would have left it out of the book. Honest.
Meanings of the Term “Virus”
Most of the time I discuss three different types of threats in
this book: viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. In Part IV, I
describe each species in grisly detail.
Computer Viruses For Dummies 
4

I use the term virus constantly throughout this book — as 
an inclusive term that includes viruses, Trojan horses, and
worms — or (depending on the context) to mean only a 
virus. (Only?) There’s still some argument going on among
computer-security professionals regarding what, exactly, a
virus is (does it always have to work like those tiny semiliving
things that give you a cold?). But the intent of malicious code
is always clear.
Foolish Assumptions
Okay, so I’m going to start by telling you who I think you are,
so you can find out whether I have a future in fortunetelling.
Wait, I’m getting something . . . (now mind you, this works
better if I can have something personal of yours — a $100 bill

This is who I think you’re not:
 You’re probably not a network administrator: Although
understanding viruses and virus protection are of utmost
importance to the security of any enterprise network and
understanding the concepts in this book is important to
system administrators, this book is geared toward end
users.
 You’re probably not a Linux or Mac user: Viruses 
hit both of these operating systems, just like they hit
Windows, but this book concentrates primarily on the
Windows operating system.
 You’re probably not a virus writer: This book provides
zero information on how to write or distribute viruses. If
you’re a virus writer, please put this book down right
now and get a life instead.
 You’re obviously no dummy: And you’re not a mark
either. Even if you don’t know a thing about computer
viruses, buying this book shows just how smart you are.
After reading this book, the virus writers will have to
look elsewhere for prey, and your friends might turn to
you for advice.
The use of good protective software does not give you license
to be irresponsible. Even with a good antivirus program, a fire-
wall, and spyware blockers, you still need to practice safe
computing. Some of the things that can go wrong transcend
the ability of protective software to save you from good old
(actually bad old) human error. You still need to be careful! I
dedicate an entire chapter on being careful — that’s how
important good computer hygiene is.
Icons Used in This Book
If you’ve used Windows or the graphical interface for Unix,
you’ve seen icons. They’re the little symbols that appear on
the screen that have special meaning. I use icons in this book,
too, and they’re a lot easier to understand than the ones used
in Windows:

any factors contribute to the likelihood that your
computer will get infected with a virus. Your han-
dling of e-mail messages from people you don’t know is
one of the biggest factors, as is the general health of your
antivirus software.
Does your computer have a virus — right now? Wouldn’t
you like to know?! Some symptoms may indicate a virus,
but other symptoms probably don’t. By performing a
simple procedure, you can determine this reliably. If you
have a virus, a couple more steps and ZAP, it’s gone. And
with relative ease, you can eliminate any spyware on your
computer, too.
Many computing habits are associated with a far lower risk
of getting infected by computer viruses and other similar
trouble. Among them are keeping your antivirus software
up to date and periodically installing security patches.
The ﬁrst important task to virus-free computing is to check
whether your computer has antivirus software, and if so,
whether it’s in good condition or not. There are a number
of ways to tell whether antivirus software is present, and
whether its basic components are functioning correctly.

Chapter 1
Understanding 
Virus Risks
In This Chapter
 Figuring out whether you’re at risk
 Making good security decisions
T
here’s an old saying: “Just because you’re not paranoid
doesn’t mean that everyone isn’t out to get you.” This
saying is proven by the people who write computer viruses —
they are out to get you! And, in fact, a little paranoia may go a
long way in protecting your computer.
In this chapter, I provide you with the factors that may
increase your personal level of useful paranoia — in other
words, the factors that can influence you to lower your per-
sonal risk level. Why? Because, get this, some people are
more apt to catch computer viruses than others, and it’s
largely based upon some basic factors such as the version 
of Windows they’re using, as well as their Internet and e-mail
habits. In the computer world as well as in the biological
world, good hygiene goes a long way in preventing infection
in the first place — and prevention is far easier to deal with
than curing an infection after it happens.

Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
12
Assessing the Threat 
to Your Computer
Three primary factors contribute to your risk of catching
viruses:
 The version of the Windows operating system you are
using
 Whether you have installed security patches on your
computer
 How many people use the computer
But also important are your Internet browsing habits:
 Do you visit many different Web sites?
 Do you visit sites that try to mess with your computer’s
settings (and how would you know — and prevent —
that)?
 Do you have a tendency to open e-mail attachments from
people you don’t know?
 Do you visit Web sites cited in e-mail messages from
strangers?
All these factors have a direct bearing on whether you are
prone to catching viruses.
Finally, the manner in which your computer is connected to
the Internet determines your susceptibility to viruses. If you
have a high-speed, “always-on” Internet connection, then virus
writers are actively trying to find you (or already have!). Dial-
up connections are somewhat less risky — but not risk-free.
Which operating system 
are you using?
Microsoft’s earlier versions of Windows had very little in the
way of security — they conformed to Microsoft’s earlier (and
flawed) premise that everyone in corporations and everyone

on the Internet is nice and can be trusted and that no one will
do anything bad. Microsoft, by the way, has been humbled by
the experience and, as a result, the newer versions of
Windows are far more secure than their predecessors.
Windows 95 and Windows 98
Collectively known as Windows 9x, these earlier versions of
Windows lack the basic security components found in modern
operating systems. Their primary fault is that they don’t sepa-
rate the function of the operating system from the person who
uses it. You, the computer’s user, have complete control over
every aspect of the computer. Even back in the ’90s that
wasn’t too safe; if you catch a virus, the virus has the same
range of control over your computer as you do.
Microsoft no longer supports Windows 95. This means that, if
any security vulnerability is discovered in Windows 95,
Microsoft will not issue bulletins, advice, or security patches
to fix it. Not an enviable position for any user to be in.
In 2003, Microsoft announced that it would soon end support
for Windows 98. But when thousands of corporate and individ-
ual computer users stormed the Microsoft castle in Redmond,
Washington, armed with torches, spears, axes, and old dot-
matrix printers, Microsoft relented and postponed the
Windows 98 “end of life.”
But for users of Windows 98, the message is clear: Your days
of support from Microsoft are growing short.
Windows ME
Officially called Windows Millennium Edition or Windows ME
(and playfully referred to in some circles as the Windows
Miserable Edition), this is just Windows 98 with some addi-
tional features thrown in and some stability improvements.
The stability improvements come at the price of higher hard-
ware requirements, however, and Windows ME suffers from
the same basic security issues as its predecessors, namely
that viruses can run roughshod throughout the unprotected
operating system.
Windows 2000
At long last, Microsoft had taken the kernel (insides) of
Windows NT and grafted on the Windows 98 user interface
Chapter 1: Understanding Virus Risks 13

(the stuff that you see on-screen when you use it), and after
exhausting the world’s supply of duct tape and baling wire,
made it work.
Windows 2000 is a very decent operating system. It contains
most of the security features that corporate customers and
consumers had been requesting for a long time. Primary is the
notion of “logging on” to the computer. In Windows 2000 and
newer versions of Windows, if you can’t log on to the com-
puter, you can’t use it. Contrast that to Windows 9x — if you
can make the computer run, you can use it and do anything
you want to it.
Windows XP
Windows XP contains many refinements over Windows 2000
and is even more secure. For the most part, Windows XP is an
improved version of Windows 2000 and includes additional
features and functions.
I’ve heard some say that Windows XP is just Windows 2000
with the soft, friendly interface. If you haven’t seen Windows
XP, it’s like Windows 2000 with brighter colors and smooth,
rounded corners.
Do you install security patches?
Microsoft regularly releases security patches — fixes to their
software — that close security holes that could lead to virus
infections. Many of these patches are deemed “critical,” and 
a good number of them have been exploited by those chip-on-
their-shoulder Internet thugs who have nothing better to do
than to spread misery to as many people as possible.
Microsoft has provided a number of ways that you can use to
find out about and install security patches, including Windows
Update, Automatic Update, and e-mail notifications of new
patches.
If you do install the critical patches that Microsoft releases,
then you’re in far better shape than if you have no security
patches at all. Having no security patches is almost as bad as
having no antivirus software: You’re up the creek with a sitting
duck.
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
14

I don’t want you to feel bad if you’re among (what I suspect 
is) the majority of computer users — those who have never
installed security patches. Had I chosen a different career 
path without much chance to get familiar with computers, 
the thought of installing security patches would seem about 
as intimidating as working on my home’s electrical wiring or
working on a late-model automobile with all its complex wiring
and safety systems. But that’s what this book is for: to help get
you past the reluctance.
How many people use 
the computer?
Are you the only person who uses your computer? Or are sev-
eral colleagues, family members, or (gasp!) total strangers
using your computer, like so many people sharing a germ-
infested bathroom water cup?
The greater the number of people using a computer, the
greater the chances are that something bad will happen. How
do I know this? When several people share a complex machine
like a PC, the inconsistencies in the ways that the people use
the computer, and the accumulation of every user’s bad habits
and mistakes, can make the computer’s condition deteriorate
over time.
How is your computer connected
to the Internet?
While there are many ways to connect to the Internet, I’m con-
cerned with just one factor: Is your computer “always on and
connected” through any sort of a broadband (high-speed) con-
nection like DSL, a cable modem, ISDN, or satellite? Or do you
use a dial-up (phone-line) connection to connect your com-
puter to the Internet, get your e-mail, do a little surfing, and
then disconnect?
It boils down to this: Is your computer always on and always
connected to the Internet? If so, then your computer is far
more likely to be targeted by Internet worms. Some hackers
like to scan for — and find — new always-on computers.
Chapter 1: Understanding Virus Risks 15

They’re looking for recruits — to see whether they can add
your system to their legion of slave computers.
Let me explain this high-speed, always-on thing a little more. If
your computer is connected to the Internet using a high-speed
connection, then your computer is statistically more likely to
be found by a scan than it would be if it were connected, say,
only one or two hours per day. Statistically speaking, an
always-on computer is ten times more likely to be scanned,
because it’s connected ten times as many hours per day. But
more than that, if your computer is always on and always con-
nected, then hackers would consider your computer more
dependable. And because the connection is higher speed than
dial-up, they can get more performance out of your computer
for their own evil purposes.
Do you have a firewall?
A firewall, as I explain more fully in Chapter 10, is something
that is designed to block the probing scans that are often asso-
ciated with viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. Those people
who have installed either a software firewall or a hardware fire-
wall have far better protection than people who have neither.
A software firewall is a program that runs on your computer,
invisibly (in the background), much like an antivirus program.
The software firewall program carefully watches all communi-
cation coming into your computer and leaving your computer.
Each network message — or packet — is examined to ascertain
its type, origin, and destination. These properties are then
compared to a list of rules to determine whether each packet
should be allowed to pass through or not. Should the message
be allowed to pass, the firewall lets it move along towards its
destination. But should the message be blocked, then the fire-
wall will not permit it to pass — and it will fail to reach its des-
tination, like a postal letter that is intercepted in transit and
simply thrown away.
A hardware firewall is an electronic appliance that is installed
on a network. Its internal function is essentially similar to the
software firewall, except that its protection is more central-
ized: All the computers on the network are protected by the
hardware firewall, so none of the bad traffic on the Internet is
permitted to reach any of the computers on the network.

Chapter 1: Understanding Virus Risks 17
The legion of zombies
Many of the viruses, worms, and
Trojan horses that have been
released in recent years have a
single, diabolical purpose — to iden-
tify and “take over” those so-called
always-on and always-connected
computers that are typically con-
nected to the Internet using high-
speed DSL, cable modem, ISDN, or
satellite connections.
A recent study estimates that fully
one-third of all such computers have
backdoors (programs that allow
hackers to bypass all security)
installed on them and are used for a
variety of purposes — generally for
transmitting spam (unwanted junk)
e-mail or for participating in massive
distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attacks.
A distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack is one where a hacker, after
enlisting hundreds or thousands of
computers with his backdoor pro-
gram, sends a command to “his”
(your) computer, instructing it (and
many, many others) to begin flooding
some particular Web site with as
many network messages as possible.
The victim’s Web site would then be
receiving millions of network mes-
sages from hundreds or thousands of
computers located all over the world
and be nearly powerless to stop it
(because of the vast number of
sources of the attack). As a result,
the victim’s Web site would, for all
practical purposes, be “off the air”
for as long as the attack continued.
This is no pipe dream or theoretical
missive. Such attacks are common-
place. Major corporations, organiza-
tions, and governments, such as
Microsoft, SCO, Yahoo!, E-Trade, the
U.S. Whitehouse, and some coun-
tries’ government or news sites, have
been victims of DDoS attacks lasting
hours or days. And unless that cor-
poration is both clever and resource-
ful, the corporation’s Web site is
essentially unreachable for all legiti-
mate use until the attack ceases.
Home users — even those who are
IT professionals by day — would
likely have no reason to suspect that
their home PCs have been taken over.
Generally speaking, hackers have
designed their backdoors to minimize
the likelihood of being detected. They
use a measured, limited portion of
your computer’s resources so you
can continue to use your computer
for whatever you do with it. At the
same time, however, your computer
would also be used to relay and
transmit spam to hundreds or thou-
sands of other unsuspecting people
(and many of those spam messages
may contain their own viruses,
worms, or Trojan horses to enlist
even more unsuspecting and poorly-
protected computers). Your computer
could be the modern version of the
zombies in Night of the Living Dead.

A firewall is like a security guard at the entrance of an office
building. He (or she) scrutinizes each person coming and
going. He may want to look at each person’s identification by
examining their employee badge or other credential. If the
person coming or going is carrying anything, he may ask ques-
tions about it. If the person is a guest, the guard may request
that the user sign their name into a visitor’s log.
The guard has a list of rules that he uses to determine whether
each person coming and going will be permitted to pass
through. Occasionally he will need to turn someone away, 
for one reason or another. He will detail each such denial 
so his boss can later view who was denied access and why.
Occasionally, the guard will need to call his boss and ask if a
visitor is permitted to pass through (in a firewall software pro-
gram, this takes the form of a pop-up window that asks if a par-
ticular program should be permitted to communicate or not).
High-risk activities
The types of activities performed on your PC also contribute
to your risk, whether high or low. Each of these activities is
related to how social you permit your computer to be. Do you
often take it out in public where it can exchange information
with other computers? In the analogy between biological
viruses and computer viruses, a high degree of socialization
(mingling with others) increases risk. The following sections
look at some examples.
Wireless “Hot Spots”
Hoping to attract well-to-do customers, many public establish-
ments — such as coffee houses, restaurants, and other busi-
nesses — have installed so-called Internet hot spots. These hot
spots are Internet connections that a customer can use to
connect to the Internet with a laptop computer, provided it’s
equipped with a wireless networking (also called Wi-Fi or
802.11) capability. Some establishments charge a fee for the
use of their hot spots; others permit use free of charge.
People who own laptops equipped with those Wi-Fi connec-
tions can visit any of the hundreds of thousands (or perhaps
millions) of Wi-Fi–equipped establishments and access the
Internet to retrieve e-mail, visit Web sites, or whatever they do
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
18

on the Internet. At a coffeehouse, for instance, you would pur-
chase your tall double-shot vanilla low-fat latte and then sit
down at one of the tables, turn on your laptop, and catch up
on e-mail while quaffing your favorite coffee drink.
But here’s the problem: These hot-spot connections have
many of the same risks that are associated with always-on
high-speed connections. Hackers and worms frequently scan
the wireless networks in these establishments, hoping to find
new victims — like, f’rinstance, your computer. Computers
lacking adequate antivirus protection fall victim to the worm
and become one of those zombie computers, awaiting the
commands from their fiendish master.
Downloading and file sharing
If you or someone with access to your computer is doing a lot
of file and program downloading and file sharing with others,
chances are that sooner or later one of the files you download
will be infected with a virus.
Because many viruses travel from computer to computer by
hiding inside of software program files, it makes sense that the
more program files you bring into your system, the more likely
it will be that one of them will have a virus. Also, program files
that have been copied from other computers (rather than
coming directly from the manufacturer) have a much greater
chance of being infected with a virus.
Instant messaging
If you are an Instant Messaging (IM) user, you are increasing
your chances of catching a virus (or, of course a worm, Trojan,
or other ill fate). As the popularity of IM rises, so too does this
get the attention of virus writers looking for new ways to get
viruses from one computer to another. Already, there have
been a number of worms that have propagated themselves
using IM. Every day, minute by minute, you can be sure that
there will have been more such incidents.
Add-on programs
If you are the type who can’t resist an online or computer
store bargain, sooner or later something you pick up will have
a little extra feature. While it doesn’t happen often, viruses
have been known to sneak onto the gold (or final) version of a
software manufacturer’s CD-ROM or online download area.
Chapter 1: Understanding Virus Risks 19

And remember — virus writers like to get their viruses to
propagate in large numbers. That means, some spend consid-
erable time trying to get their wares into programs that will be
mass-marketed or mass-distributed.
Sharing your e-mail address with too 
many other people and organizations
Persons who have a habit of signing up for things on the
Internet are far more likely to end up on one or more spam-
mers’ lists. Or if you are the type of person whose e-mail
address is “in circulation” — meaning your e-mail address
appears online in Web sites, chat rooms, mailing lists, news-
groups, and so forth — then the chances improve that your
e-mail address will be picked up and wind up in the hands of
one or more mass marketers. As soon as this happens, one 
or more of the spammers who like to send large volumes
(we’re talking millions) of virus-laden e-mail messages will
take advantage of the target you’ve given them.
This is not unlike giving out your phone number to lots of dif-
ferent people and organizations, only to discover that you are
beginning to receive far more unwanted phone calls than
before. So it is with e-mail. It’s the fastest possible way to
infest your once-pristine inbox with more unwanted mail than
legitimate mail.
In my case, about three-fourths of all the e-mail I receive is
spam. My e-mail address appears in my online column in
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation

How many viruses are there?
Tens of thousands of viruses, worms,
and Trojan horses have been devel-
oped and released onto the Internet
over the past two decades. On the
day that I am writing this section, my
own PC’s antivirus program shows
over 66,000 known viruses in its list.
In the first half of 2003 alone, 3,855 new
viruses were introduced. That is over
21 new viruses each and every day.
Nearly all new viruses are targeted 
at Microsoft products, including
Windows, Outlook, and Office.

ComputerWorld. Of course, the address I use there is different
from any I use anywhere else — and it isn’t hard to see why:
Soon after I started writing my column, I began to receive
additional spam, much of it sent to that unique address. This
occurs because some spammers have spider programs that
run all over the Web in search of e-mail addresses to harvest
from Web sites.
Deciding How Much 
Security Is Enough
Without getting too scientific about it, the best way to think
about “how much security is enough” is to compare the value
of the possession you are trying to protect against the level of
effort you’re willing to expend to protect it.
Let me illustrate with a simple example. Would you protect 
a $1,000 automobile with a $2,000 alarm system? Not likely,
because it isn’t proportional.
Like shoes and bathing suits, one size does not fit all people
and all needs. And so it is with computers. Depending on what
you do with your computer, you will need to spend a particular
level of effort in order to protect the information on your com-
puter and the ability to continue performing whatever activities
you use it for.
For example, a casual user sends and receives e-mail and
surfs the Internet. But someone else uses their computer to
make their living: Perhaps they use their computer to build
Web sites, do financial accounting for small businesses, or
write For Dummies books. The latter user has a lot more to
lose if something goes wrong with his or her computer, than
does the casual user, who is merely inconvenienced.
Take a look at three somewhat arbitrary levels of security 
in Table 1-1. Each one also represents a level of value, and I
include examples of how often particular security activities
should take place.

You can see in these examples that the higher-value systems
deserve more elaborate protection. If you think about it, a
high-value system is helping its owner to derive income or
some other economic value, or pursue some other form of
value that the user feels personally invested in. Given the risks
associated with online computing, it makes sense to protect
systems associated with economic (or other) value more than
systems that were little more than hobbyist-level systems.

oes your computer have a virus? Or are you just afraid

to the right place. If your computer has started to act funny —
if it just doesn’t feel right — then it’s possible (but not cer-

This chapter gives you the information necessary to help you
determine whether your computer has a virus, and then points
you in the right direction to find out what to do next. Just
remember this: Nobody deserves to get a computer virus.
If you do have a virus, batten down the hatches and brace for

Looking at Common 
Virus Symptoms
Stalking the wild computer virus starts with observation: There
are a lot of ways that a computer can begin to act strangely for
no apparent reason. These changes in behavior may be the
result of a virus, but there are other possible explanations as
well.
This section describes some typical virus-induced symptoms,
as well as some ways to determine whether a virus is respon-
sible for your computer’s symptoms.
Computer too slow
The first thing to check when your computer is slow is to 
make sure that your computer isn’t in a school zone. Seriously,
a slowing in your computer can be the result of a number of
circumstances — and a virus is definitely among them. The 
following list provides some considerations for making an 
educated guess as to why your computer is slowing down:
 Have you made any changes to your computer lately?
For instance, have you upgraded to Windows 2000 or
Windows XP? These newer operating systems require a
lot more memory than their predecessors.
 Have you upgraded a program? Like Windows 2000 and
Windows XP, newer versions of many other programs like
Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works require a lot more
memory than earlier versions.
 Have you or a loved one downloaded a lot of “nature”
pictures or other information? Pictures and music take
up space. If your hard drive is almost full, your computer
will definitely run slower.
If you’re sure you haven’t made any changes, then you may
have a virus. You’ll have to check your computer’s behavior
and run a number of simple tests before you can be sure.

Unexplained activity
Does your hard-drive or network-activity light flicker for no
apparent reason? While there may be a legitimate reason for
it, this could also be a sign that a virus or a hacker’s back-door
program (a devious little program that allows secret access
without your permission) is running on your computer. You
might be donating some of your computer resources to a
hacker and be largely unaware of it. Here are some examples
of what could be going on if a hacker has gotten control of
your computer:
 The hacker could be using your computer to send thou-
sands, even millions, of those annoying spam messages
to people all over the Internet.
 The hacker could be using your computer to launch
attacks on corporate computing networks. In a DDoS
(distributed denial of service) attack, for example, a
hacker instructs thousands of “zombie” computers (like
yours, perhaps) to send lots of messages to a particular
corporate Web site, glutting its communications and
knocking it off the Internet.
 The hacker could be using your computer to scan other
networks, hunting for vulnerable ports (communication
channels for particular computer processes) that can
mean more potential-victim computers.
 The hacker may have installed spyware that reports 
back to the bad guys without the victim’s (your) knowl-
edge. One example is a key logger — a small program 
that records every key press and mouse movement in an
attempt to learn your bank-account numbers, credit-card
numbers, and other sensitive information that you proba-
bly don’t want strangers to know about. (For more about
this insidious stuff, see “Blocking spyware,” later in this
chapter.)
Crashes or hangs
Does your computer crash often? Does it just stop respond-
ing? Do you often get the Blue Screen of Death™? Again, there
are many possible explanations. No cop-out, just reality. (Hey,
if I had a crystal ball, I’d quit writing, buy office space on
Bourbon Street in New Orleans, and make my fortune, right?)
Chapter 2: Does My Computer Have a Virus? 25

Crashing, hanging, and blue screens may be virus-induced,
but they’re probably not. These maladies are more likely the
result of new software, new drivers, or even a hardware com-
ponent that’s beginning to fail. Check out those possibilities
first.
Will not boot
Boot used to be a noun — the leather thing you put on your
foot to protect it from rough terrain. These days boot is a verb
just as often; it’s the process that your computer performs to
start itself when you turn it on or press Ctrl+Alt+Del (the
“three-finger salute”).
You guessed it — just because your computer won’t boot, 
it doesn’t necessarily mean that your computer has a virus.
Maybe yes, maybe no. There are several other likely explana-
tions — for example, a corrupted master boot record (the 
part of the hard drive that your computer uses to start up), 
or damage to an important file that your computer uses to
start up.
If either of these was the case, you’d probably have to 
rebuild your computer’s operating system and file system
from scratch — not fun, even for the experts — and recover-
ing any lost data could get dicey in a hurry. But you know, 
if you’re running Windows and have to reinstall your com-
puter’s operating system, here are a couple of basic improve-
ments to consider:
 What better time to upgrade to Windows 2000 or
Windows XP (unless you’re already running one of
those)?
 What better excuse to curl up with a good book — say,
whichever Windows For Dummies book covers your
newly installed version? This could be the perfect oppor-
tunity to read up on Windows while you’re waiting for the
install to finish.
Strange computer behavior
Okay, computers sometimes behave inscrutably, but their
behavior should be predictable. Same deal for viruses —
which means they can’t completely conceal their activities.
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
26

You can look for the devil in the details. Perhaps the signs are
obvious (the colors go all weird, the computer puts words 
on-screen by itself, or it makes strange noises) or relatively
subtle (your screen borders pinch inward for an instant just
before you send e-mail). Time to observe closely and take
notes. For openers, consider some “obvious” symptoms:
 Files are not where you left them, and can’t be found on
your computer. If your computer has become a Bermuda
Triangle that is eating your files, even some of your soft-
ware, you might have a virus.
 You can find the file, but its size or date stamp is suspi-
ciously different. Viruses that infect program files may
make the files bigger or smaller than they should be, or
change their date stamps. Date stamps don’t ordinarily
change on program files — ever — unless an official soft-
ware patch changes them. Uh-oh.
 On-screen text starts to change by itself. In the old days
of the DOS command prompt, one virus made the letters
in on-screen text seem to move around “by themselves.”
Sometimes they changed colors, or started consuming
each other like Pac-Man. Bad sign. But you knew that.
 An out-of-context message appears on-screen. Some
viruses announce their presence by taunting the user. If
you are greeted with a message such as Your computer
is now Stoned!, you probably have a virus. Consider
whether the message is out of context — for example,
does it look like someone’s trying to cap a practical joke
with a punch line? Not funny at all.
These are just a few examples of the weird things a virus can
do to your computer. Those virus writers are pretty creative
(in an ugly sort of way).
Too many pop-up windows
While I can’t prove it, I’d suspect that in some cases, Web sites
that flood you with pop-up windows could also be attempting
to download some malicious program(s) into your computer.
Web sites that pump pop-ups into people’s computers are
notorious for attempting to change the configuration of your 
Web browser and other parts of your computer — by remote
control, without your knowledge or permission.
Chapter 2: Does My Computer Have a Virus? 27

Finding and Fixing a Virus
There are some tools and procedures that can tell with 99.44
percent accuracy whether your computer has a virus. Here
are the actions to take:
 Find out whether your computer has antivirus software:
Use Chapter 3 to help you find that out. If the steps in
Chapter 3 lead you to believe that your computer does
not have antivirus software, use Chapter 4 to help you
obtain and install some.
 Find out whether your antivirus software is up to date:
If you already have antivirus software installed on your
computer, Chapter 9 can help you figure out whether it’s
up to date and working properly.
 Scan your computer for viruses: When you know that
your computer has antivirus software — and that it’s up to
date — you can use it to scan your computer for viruses.
Chapter 6 describes what to expect from this scan.
If you have an Internet connection, you might think that
you can take a shortcut and try one of those online virus-
scanning tools — but don’t do that at this point! The risks
of connecting to the Internet without antivirus software
and a firewall are greater than the benefit you’d get from
knowing whether you have a virus — and you could end
up with a virus if you use the ’Net unprotected. (It’s like
drinking unboiled water from a polluted river — think
Montezuma’s Revenge here.)
For some really good reasons not to use an online scan-
ning tool as a first resort, go to Chapters 6 through 10,
where I explain local scanning, online scanning, and fire-
walls. (Chapter 10 goes into detail about firewalls.)
Suffice to say: Make sure you’re protected before you
venture out.
 Remove the virus: If your virus-scanning tool finds a
virus on your computer, Chapter 7 explains how to get
rid of the ugly thing. There are two basic outcomes:
• Automatic removal: Chances are your virus-
scanning tool will be able to fix your computer 
by removing the virus. Most of the time this is 
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
28

the case. Newer virus tools will, in effect, tell you,
“Hey you, I found a virus on your computer. Do you
want me to clean it up or not?” I really cannot imag-
ine why you would want to say no.
Personally I think you should just get rid of the virus
right away and deal with the consequences, however
mild or severe, afterward.
• Manual removal — and more work: If, however,
your virus-scanning tool tells you that it cannot get
rid of the virus, a little more work is in order. For
instance, you may need to download a special virus-
removal tool from your antivirus software vendor;
such tools are sometimes built for specific, hard-
to-remove viruses. (I also explain these sometimes-
necessary extra steps in Chapter 8.)
When you get rid of viruses, you’ve made a good start. (Done?
Who said anything about done?) Review the ways you use your
computer: Did something you do regularly get you into virus
trouble in the first place? By identifying the things you do that
expose you to threats like viruses, you can reduce your expo-
sure by doing some things differently. Preventive actions —
the cyber equivalent of washing your hands before handling
food — take a little time, but they can save a lot of misery later.
Developing Good Habits
People remember their firsts — the first time driving a car,
first kiss, first surgery, first computer virus. (Well, okay, some
firsts are better than others — but most are memorable.) In
the case of this first, here’s something to keep in mind. . . .
If you got a computer virus, human error was probably a
factor. Somebody probably wasn’t doing something right.
That, or you were extremely unlucky.
Nobody’s exempt from human error (well, maybe chim-
panzees). You may have opened an infected attachment by
mistake, or missed out on the latest antivirus update. Or your
friend who helped set up your computer may have skipped a
step or left the wrong default in place. However it happened,
you need to discover where the error came from. If you’re like
Chapter 2: Does My Computer Have a Virus? 29

most people, you may be able to safeguard your computer by
changing some habits. Those changes take two forms:
 Stopping virus-prone habits that put you at risk
 Starting some virus-savvy habits that make you less of a
target
Having good, up-to-date antivirus software is essential. But
there are some other good defensive tools such as firewalls and
antispyware. In addition to these nice defensive tools, you may
still have some old habits to break and new habits to take up.
The first good thing you did was buy this book. Now if you
read carefully and take my advice to heart, you’ll be much
safer in the long run. (And don’t forget to eat your vegetables.)
Keeping antivirus software 
up to date
Antivirus software is of little value if it’s not kept up to date.
One of those big-ego computer scientists once said that out-
of-date antivirus software is as bad as having none at all. (Hey,
sometimes the scientists are right.) The best antivirus pro-
gram is next to useless if it’s not kept up to date.
I show you how to keep your antivirus software current in
Chapter 8. This is required reading, unless you want to catch
more viruses in the future (hey, the virus writers would love
you, but trust me, they won’t respect you in the morning).
Scan for viruses periodically
Although rare, some viruses can sneak onto a computer with-
out being detected at the time of their arrival. It’s a very good
idea to scan your entire computer for viruses from time to
time — say, once a week. Read Chapter 6 to see how to set
this up; chances are your antivirus program can do this auto-
matically for you.
Install security patches
Security patches are fixes that software companies make to
protect the computer programs they make from the villains
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
30

who try to harm your computer. (Yes, Virginia, there really are
people in the world who want to hurt other people and their
property. But you knew that.)
Some patches fix malfunctions that sometimes crop up as a
result of flaws in the product. If the flaws make your system
vulnerable to hackers, the software maker creates patches
that fix those specific vulnerabilities. Chapter 9 tells you more
about security patches and why they’re important. (For now,
think about infestation, fumigation, and why malfunctions in
computer programs are called “bugs.”)
Working on good computer
hygiene
In so many ways, it’s a grubby Internet out there. You don’t
want to interact with it without protection. Fortunately, there’s
a wealth of good habits you can discover and adopt. They can
be as effective (and simple) as washing your hands after using
the bathroom. Used consistently, they can help keep you and
your computer safe; I explain ’em in Chapter 12.
Blocking malicious network 
traffic with a firewall
In Chapter 10, I tell you a lot about firewalls. For now, consider
this: You need one. Everybody needs one. Trust me on this.
Like antivirus software, firewalls protect your computer. Their
function is to deflect the incoming bad things — viruses,
worms, and Trojan horses — that antivirus software can’t
always stop. Having a firewall can help — a lot.
Blocking spyware
If you’re like many of us, it isn’t hard to get into the mood to
give your computer a thorough cleaning — and I don’t mean
with spray disinfectant. Rather, I mean that it’s time to go
cloak-and-dagger and check for spyware on your computer.
Chapter 2: Does My Computer Have a Virus? 31

Spyware can be a lot of things. In general, it’s software that
some Web sites and viruses install on your computer without
your knowledge so some person or company can track your
online movements, or even record your keystrokes with a key
logger (also mentioned earlier in this chapter under “Strange
computer behavior”). If it doesn’t bother you that someone
you don’t know has knowledge about where you go on the
Internet, then you don’t need to know any more about spy-
ware. But we’re not talking Santa Claus here.
Many people in the United States and Europe find it repulsive
to think that some total stranger knows about their Internet
surfing habits. They don’t have to have anything to hide —
and most of the time, they don’t. They just figure it’s nobody
else’s business. I’m with them all the way.
Naturally, you can (and should) decide for yourself. But read
Chapter 10 and see whether you want to better protect your-
self with a spyware-detection tool.
Do you have a PDA?
If you have a Palm Pilot, a Pocket PC, or any of the other PDAs
that are available, you should consider adopting some safe
practices. It’s a small computer, after all, and deserves to be
kept as safe as your main computer. More about this in
Chapter 11.
Finding Out More about Viruses
To look into the dark world of the viruses themselves, go 
to Chapters 13, 14, and 15. Here you can find out about the
deranged people who write viruses and why they do it. I also
explain more about how viruses and their cousins (worms
and Trojan horses) cause damage and spread from computer
to computer.
It makes sense (beyond my personal opinion) that knowing
more about how viruses work will help you avoid them. The
same goes for biological viruses: When you know how they
spread, you can think before you act, and avoid them — maybe
not every time, but much of the time. Enough of the time.

Does Your Computer

Software?
In This Chapter

T
o know whether your computer is protected against
viruses and other threats, you need to know for certain
whether you have antivirus software installed on your com-
puter. That’s because antivirus software is your best defense
against viruses. Period.
Not only do you need to know whether you have antivirus
software, but you need to know whether your antivirus soft-
ware is actually working properly — which means (among
other things) that it had better be up to date.
This chapter helps you figure out for sure whether or not you
have antivirus software and whether it’s functioning properly.
This knowledge serves as a starting point toward identifying
and getting rid of a virus that’s already on your system and
protecting your computer from future viruses.

Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
34
Understanding Antivirus
Software
Before I explain what antivirus software is, it’s worth review-
ing the nature of software in general. Understanding software
doesn’t mean you have to write computer programs or wear a
hat with a propeller on top. The fact is that the word software
is at the heart of viruses and the defenses against them.
Knowing some basics about software will help you to under-
stand viruses and how to stop them in their tracks.
These days, the term software is roughly synonymous with
computer program. A program used to be a set of instructions
individually written for every task a computer did. Software
began as a package of programs designed to handle a range
of specific tasks consistently. These days it’s a packaged
product that tells the computer what to do — consistently.
There’s the rub: A computer is, after all, a machine that’s no
smarter than its creators; software is still a set of instructions
that makes the computer do everything. If a hacker can figure
out how it does that, then the computer is ripe for a sneaky
takeover.
Yep, viruses are software: Nasty, illicit software. As such, they
can only be effectively fought with (you guessed it). . . .
Antivirus software is specifically designed to rid your
computer of viruses and to keep them at bay, usually by
three methods:
 By identifying viruses and arresting them when they try
to invade
 By identifying viruses already present in the computer
 By removing viruses and making simple repairs to the
computer
So your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure
out whether you already have antivirus software on your com-
puter and, if so, whether it’s working.

Looking Around for
Antivirus Icons
The first thing you can do to see if your computer has antivirus
software is to look in a number of different places for specific
icons that are associated with antivirus programs. Some of the
places to look include the Start menu, your desktop, and your
system tray (the area on the bottom right of your screen that
contains, among other things, the time of day).
The presence of an antivirus icon on your Start menu or desk-
top is not proof positive that the associated antivirus program
is actually on your computer. It’s a pretty good indication, but
not proof. To be completely literal, the presence of an antivirus
icon on your Start menu means that at one time your computer
had antivirus software; it may still have it, and it may not. (If
your computer has an antivirus icon on the Start menu, but no
antivirus software, then the antivirus software was probably
removed, but the removal process forgot to remove the icon.)
If you find a familiar antivirus icon on your system tray (the
area in the lower-right corner of your Windows screen, where
the time is), it’s a pretty good indication that your computer
has antivirus software, and that it is running. It doesn’t tell
you about the health of your antivirus software, but at least
you can know that it’s there. You can double-click the icon
and see whether anything shows up on-screen, but even that
test won’t tell you everything.
Time to discuss those indicators in detail.
Look in — or hunt for — the
system tray
Check the system tray first, as this will give you an indication
that you not only have antivirus software that is installed on
your computer, but also that it is actually running.
The system tray (or, for the ultra-cyberhip, systray) is a part of
your taskbar that contains several small icons — and usually
also the time (sometimes the date).
Chapter 3: Does Your Computer Have Antivirus Software? 35

The taskbar can be on the left side, right side, top, or bottom
of your screen. If you don’t see the taskbar, perhaps it has
been set to Auto Hide (it becomes invisible unless the cursor
is in the general area). Move your mouse to the top edge of
the screen, then to the bottom edge, then left, then right. If
your taskbar is set to Auto Hide, then moving the mouse to its
hiding place causes the taskbar to appear.
Note the location of the system tray — it’s at the opposite end
of the taskbar from the Start button. If your taskbar also has a
Quick Launch bar, it is usually right next to the Start button.
(Have a look at Figure 3-1 to see what I’m talking about.)
Figure 3-1: The taskbar, with the system tray and its icons.
Take a look in the system tray on your computer to see
whether it holds one of the icons shown in Table 3-1.
If your system tray icons seem too cryptic, cheat: Hover the
mouse pointer over each one and look for a tool tip — a 
neat little label that identifies the program associated with
the icon — to appear. For example, if you’re running Norton
AntiVirus and you hover the mouse pointer over the 
Norton AntiVirus system tray icon, you can see the text Norton
AntiVirus Auto-Protect Enabled (if Norton AntiVirus is
malfunctioning, it might say something else, such as Norton
AntiVirus Auto-Protect Disabled).

If you don’t find a system tray icon that’s associated with an
antivirus software program, that doesn’t necessarily mean
that you don’t have antivirus software:
 Your antivirus program may have been manufactured
before displaying a system tray icon became the norm.
(Consider that a hint: An updated version would be a
really good idea.)
 Your antivirus program may not be running now (that’s a
bad thing, by the way, because antivirus software should
always be running).
Chapter 3: Does Your Computer Have Antivirus Software? 37

 The built-in Windows feature called Windows Explorer
(not the Web browser called Internet Explorer) may have
been restarted on your computer; when this happens,
some programs’ system-tray icons disappear and don’t
come back until the system is rebooted (shame on any
program that doesn’t try to put its system-tray icon back!).
Look on the Start menu
If your antivirus program doesn’t show up in the system tray,
it may still be hanging around on your hard drive somewhere.
Another reliable way to find out is to look at the Start menu.
Figure 3-2 shows the Windows XP Start menu.
1. On the taskbar, click the Start button.
For those new to Windows, the Start button hangs out
in the lower-left corner of the screen, at the left end of
the taskbar. If the taskbar is playing hide-and-seek,
bring it out of hiding (as noted in the “Look in — or
hunt for — the system tray” section, earlier in this
chapter). If you’re running Windows XP, you then click
All Programs unless you’re using the “classic”
Windows 2000 menu style.
Figure 3-2: The Windows XP Start menu before clicking All Programs.
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
38

Your taskbar might not be on the bottom of the
screen. You or someone else might have moved it to
the top, right, or left side. Still, the taskbar will contain
the Start button at one end and the system tray icons
on the other end. And remember that the taskbar can
be trained to hide itself, so you may need to start
moving your mouse pointer to the top, left, and right
edges to see if you can coax it out of hiding. If that
doesn’t work either, well, your computer might be
really sick, old, or not running Windows!
2. Find the antivirus program in the Start menu.
Depending on how it was installed (some programs
have options that put Start menu items in unusual
places), you may see the antivirus program manufac-
turer’s name first; clicking on that gets you to another
menu item, or possibly to the actual list of programs
and features found in the antivirus program.
Be patient. It can take quite a while to find your
antivirus program’s Start-menu entry, especially if
you have a lot of software programs installed on your
computer. The name might not be immediately obvi-
ous, either.
3. If you find an antivirus program on the Start menu,
start the program by clicking its entry in the menu.
If nothing appears to happen, consider:
• You may have started the part of the antivirus pro-
gram that runs in the background, watching for
virus activities — in which case, you may not see
any change in how your computer is running.
• Are there any new icons in the system tray that you
didn’t see before? Often, when an antivirus program
starts, even if it’s running quietly in the background,
it will place an icon in the system tray as a conven-
ient way for you to find it and to get its status.
• If you don’t see any change and you find no new
icons in the system tray, then you may have a prob-
lem with the antivirus program.
4. If the antivirus program starts and you see some
kind of a configuration window, I believe your
search may be over.
Chapter 3: Does Your Computer Have Antivirus Software? 39

Oh, yeah, don’t forget to give yourself a pat on the
back. If it starts, you’ve found it. The next question is
what to do with it. Proceed to Chapter 8 for instruc-
tions on updating your antivirus program’s virus sig-
natures — you need to do this prior to running a scan.
Chapter 6 provides instructions on how to scan your
computer for viruses.
If the antivirus program doesn’t start, you can try a few other
things:
 Try another item from the Start menu that you think may
be a part of your antivirus software, especially if there was
more than one icon associated with the antivirus program.
Just don’t select any “uninstall” item!
 If you see a Help item associated with your antivirus
program, this might be helpful, as you may find specific
instructions on how to start and manage your antivirus
program.
 It’s also possible that the antivirus software program was
removed, but the removal process failed to get rid of the
Start-menu items you found. If that’s what happened, you
see a window like the one in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3: The Start menu cannot find the program associated with
the icon.
Look on the desktop
Installation programs often place an icon on the desktop, so
it’s sensible to look on the desktop for an antivirus icon as a
means of determining whether antivirus software is currently
installed on your computer. This method is a little bit less reli-
able than searching the Start menu (as I describe in the previ-
ous section), for a couple of reasons:
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
40

 Failing to find an icon on the desktop doesn’t mean your
computer lacks an antivirus program. Perhaps when the
antivirus program was installed, whoever installed it told
the install program not to create desktop menu icons.
 Finding an icon doesn’t necessarily mean that the pro-
gram is still present in your computer: Sometimes “unin-
stall” programs fail to delete desktop icons.
That said, it’s still worth taking a few minutes to look on the
desktop for an antivirus icon. If your computer’s icons are
jumbled on top of each other, align them so you can see them
all; if your computer has an antivirus program, the icon
should turn up.
You can use a built-in Windows feature to align your icons
instantly — just remember that you can’t undo the command.
If you want ’em back the way they were, you’ll have to drag
them to where you want them. Anyway, here’s the drill:
 Windows 2000: Right-click the desktop and choose Line
Up Icons.
 Windows XP: Right-click the desktop and choose
Arrange Icons By➪Align to Grid.
If you did find icons on your desktop that are associated with
an antivirus program, double-click ’em and see what happens.
If you’re lucky today, your computer does have antivirus soft-
ware and you will see its main control panel program appear.
(See Chapter 8 for how to update the antivirus program’s
virus signatures; Chapter 6 covers scanning for viruses.)
Look at installed programs
If you looked for desktop icons or Start menu items that may
indicate an installed antivirus program (as I describe in the
previous sections) and came up empty, you’re not necessarily
dead in the water. You can look at the list of installed pro-
grams to see whether antivirus software is installed. It’s usu-
ally a reliable indicator.
Chapter 3: Does Your Computer Have Antivirus Software? 41

This procedure consists of pulling up your computer’s main
control panel. There are a few different ways this is done,
depending upon what operating system your computer is run-
ning and also how the control panel itself is configured. The
basic scenario looks like this:
1. Click the Start button on your Windows taskbar.
If you are running Windows 2000, you’ll see a short
menu appear.
2. Choose Settings➪Control Panel.
A new window opens or you see another set of
choices appear in the Start menu.
3. Choose Add/Remove Programs, as shown in
Figure 3-4.
If you’re running Windows XP, you might not see the
Add/Remove Programs option in the control panel. If
this is the case, find and click Switch to Classic View
on the left side of the control panel. Then you can
click Add/Remove Programs.
Figure 3-4: Windows 2000 control panel — “Classic View.”
Click here to add or remove programs.
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
42

4. With the Add/Remove Programs window open (as
shown in Figure 3-5), examine this list for antivirus
programs.
Do not click any of these items; just scroll through the
list. You cannot start your antivirus software program
here — it’s only the place where you would remove
any installed software.
Figure 3-5: Windows 2000 — Add/Remove Programs window.
Asking at Your Place 
of Purchase
If you purchased your computer from a retailer, then you
should examine all of the paperwork that came with your
computer — perhaps something says which antivirus pro-
gram was installed on your computer.
You could also visit the store where you purchased your com-
puter and find someone who can help you. A salesperson, or
someone in the service department, should be able to help
you. This depends, though, on how long ago you purchased
your computer — the people in the store may not remember
what antivirus software (if any) was installed on computers in
the distant past.
Chapter 3: Does Your Computer Have Antivirus Software? 43

Checking the Health of Your
Antivirus Software
After you locate the antivirus software on your computer, you
need to “look under the hood” and see whether it appears to
be operating properly.
Until you are more familiar with your computer and its
antivirus software, it’s not wise to assume that your antivirus
software is configured and operating correctly.
The steps you follow here will accomplish two things:
 You will be confirming the important aspects of your
antivirus software in order to determine if it’s working
right.
 You will be discovering how your antivirus software is
configured and how it operates on your computer.
The next sections explain how to make your antivirus soft-
ware open up and say, “Aaaaah.”
Step 1: Determining whether
your antivirus software
starts at bootup
When you start (“boot”) the computer, the computer’s startup
instructions direct several features and programs to begin
running. Here are some ways to figure out if antivirus software
begins to run on your computer:
 Check for a splash screen: When some of these pro-
grams start, they display a splash screen on the com-
puter’s monitor. A splash screen is sort of like a
ten-second “look at me, I’m starting!” advertisement.
Most, if not all, antivirus tools display some sort of a
splash screen when they start. I have included some
antivirus program splash screens in Figure 3-6.
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
44

Figure 3-6: Some antivirus program splash screens.
The absence of a splash screen does not conclusively
prove the absence of an antivirus program. Some antivirus
programs do not have splash screens; also, some pro-
grams let you exclude the splash screen display. That
said, if you see an antivirus splash screen, it’s a pretty
good indicator that your computer has an antivirus pro-
gram that starts when the computer is started.
 Look for system-tray icons: The next thing to look for
when checking the health of your antivirus software is to
look for its system tray icon. The presence of a system
tray icon is a pretty good indicator that the antivirus pro-
gram not only started, but has managed to keep running.
You’re not out of the woods yet, though.
 Can you see the status: Now you need to see if you can
coax the antivirus program to show you a detailed status
and configuration screen. How to do this will vary some-
what depending on which antivirus software program
is running on your computer. Here are a few things you
can try:
• Click the antivirus system-tray icon. If a menu
appears, see what options are available. Items like
Options, Configure, and Status sound like good
Chapter 3: Does Your Computer Have Antivirus Software? 45

things to try. An About item would also be good, as
you’ll get to see the full name and version of your
antivirus program.
• Double-click the system tray icon. This may cause
a configuration program or status program to
appear — again, this depends upon the brand of
antivirus program you’re using. They all run a little
bit differently.
• Right-click the system-tray icon. As with the single-
click above, this could get you a menu with some
options to try.
If none of these does anything, then you’ll have to start
the antivirus program’s configuration screen some other
way. For other possible ways of starting antivirus soft-
ware, use the methods that I describe earlier in the “Look
on the Start menu” and “Look on the desktop” sections.
Assuming that one of the things here got your antivirus pro-
gram going and displaying some sort of a status or configura-
tion screen, there are some things to look for in the upcoming
sections.
Step 2: Determining the version 
of antivirus software
On the splash screen, system tray icon, or desktop icon — or
on the program’s status screen — you should see the brand
name of the antivirus software. Or you can start the antivirus
program and choose Help➪About. You want to get the version
name and number of the software too.
There are a couple of reasons to do this. If you know what
make and version of antivirus software you have, you can visit
the software maker’s Web site and get more information about
the product: You can find help in the form of support informa-
tion, frequently-asked questions, and how-to instructions for
operating the program.
Also, in general, you can find answers to other questions when
you know what make and version your antivirus software is.
For instance, you may need to find out how to configure
another program if part of that program’s configuration
depends on which antivirus program you’re using.
Part I: Evaluating Your Virus Situation 
46

Step 3: Figuring out when 
the last update occurred
The most important thing to figure out when you’re working
with existing antivirus software is when the program’s virus
definitions were last updated. Depending on which antivirus
program you have, this might be displayed on the configura-
tion screen. If not, it could be in Help➪About, or in the About
option from the system tray. Every antivirus program displays
this information a little differently. You gotta love the consis-
tency between the different antivirus programs.
If the date of the last update is within the past couple of
weeks, then you can be pretty sure that your antivirus soft-
ware is working okay, at least up to that date. Also, provided
that your antivirus software is configured properly, you’ll be
protected against all but the very latest viruses.
If, on the other hand, the date of the last update is older than
a few weeks, then you need to update your virus-definition
files as soon as possible. You can find detailed information on
how to do this in Chapter 8.
Many antivirus programs will give you the dates of your most
recent last update, last scan, and program version if you
choose Help➪About.
Step 4: Figuring out when 
the last scan occurred
While you’re checking out your antivirus program, you also
need to figure out when your computer was last scanned for
viruses.
Like the date of the last virus-definitions file, the date of the last
virus scan is important to know. However, the last scan date 
is not quite as important as the date of the virus-definition file
update.
If the date of the last virus definition update and the date of
the last scan are both more than a few weeks in the past, you
may be several thousand viruses behind the times (this
should not make you feel old). Update your virus definitions
first, and then scan the computer for viruses.

Part II
Deploying Your
Antivirus Defenses

In this part . . .
S
o you’re in the market for antivirus software? You
need to stick with known name brand antivirus pro-
grams and buy one from a trustworthy source. Should you
buy a CD-ROM or a download version? (Personally, I would
go with the CD version.) When you install your antivirus
software, I strongly recommend that you perform a full
computer scan if the installation procedure provides for it.
After your antivirus software is installed, it’s time to set up
regular scans and signature ﬁle updates. How often should
these be done? It depends partly on how you use the com-
puter. If your antivirus program provides specialized e-mail
protection, you want to set this up as well. Likewise, if you
use instant messaging and your antivirus program can
protect it, then by all means you need to enable this too.
Scanning your computer for viruses is a basic task that
you need to be familiar with. You want to conﬁgure your
antivirus program to do scans in the middle of the night,
or whenever you aren’t using your computer for a while.
You also want to know how to start a scan of a ﬁle, direc-
tory, or the entire computer if you suspect that a virus
may be in your computer.
If your computer has a virus, you’ve got to get rid of it as
quickly and carefully as possible. Your antivirus software
can remove many viruses, but some require specialized
tools that are usually available from antivirus companies.
But sometimes, the damage from a virus can be so devas-
tating that you need to reinstall Windows. Yuck.

his chapter is intended to make you a good, informed
shopper. Stick with me and you’ll know just what you’re
looking for. I describe many of the features that can be found
on antivirus programs — one or more of these features may
well be something you want.
I also help you install your antivirus software. Each of them is
a little different, but the concepts are pretty much the same
on all of the antivirus programs.
Sticking with Name 
Brands You Know
If you’re going to take any of my advice seriously, put this bit
at the top of the list: It’s vitally important that you use known
and reputable antivirus software.

Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
52
When you are buying antivirus software, you are not just pur-
chasing a tool — you are entering into a long-term relationship.
When you choose a particular brand of antivirus software, 
you are immediately becoming dependent upon the quality of
that company’s product — including the competence of their
antivirus research labs and their capability to develop and 
send you the data that your antivirus software needs to stop
the very latest viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
Does it really matter which brand of
antivirus software you purchase?
If you buy any of the top ten or so
brands of consumer antivirus soft-
ware, and if you properly configure
and operate the program, you have
good protection against viruses. So,
no, it doesn’t matter which brand you
select. What is far more important is
that you purchase antivirus software
that meets two criteria:
 It includes the features you need.
 It’s easy for you to use.
On the first point about features, you’ll
discover more about features as you
read this book. Most antivirus prod-
ucts are fully functional by them-
selves, but many are now “bundled”
with other products such as antispam
software, firewalls, pop-up blockers,
and plastic toy handcuffs for when
you catch a hacker yourself.
I cannot express enough that
whichever product you select should
be easy for you to use. If the product
you choose is difficult for you to
understand or operate, you might not
understand what is going on and you
could possibly misconfigure it. Or,
worse, you might give up altogether,
leaving you vulnerable to new viruses
and worms.
This isn’t too much different from
VCR’s. If you can’t quite figure out
how to program your VCR, you might
miss your favorite episode of Iron
Chef or Jerry Springer (I’m trying to
appeal to both ends of the spectrum
here). The consequences of your fail-
ing to properly program your VCR
may be that you miss your favorite TV
show, whereas the consequences of
failing to configure your antivirus pro-
gram could result in a virus getting
into your computer, stealing your
credit-card numbers and buying
phone calling cards or VCRs from
cheezy online merchants. Or worse.

If you’re going to skimp, then do so elsewhere: buy cheap
speakers, or a crummy mouse, or a monitor that is too small,
dim, or wavy. None of these will endanger your information —
or make your life as miserable as a substandard antivirus pro-
gram can.
A good antivirus software program is worth far more than the
price you pay for it, the very first time it stops a virus. And
these days, that could be the very day you first install it!
Chapter 17 provides a group of antivirus programs that you
can count on along with Web sites for more information.
Considering Important 
Antivirus Features
You need to be a good consumer — a smart shopper. If you
really don’t have a clue about what you need in an antivirus
program, then the also-clueless salesperson at your favorite
computer store could steer you toward something that may
not meet your needs.
Of course, if the store salesman turns out not to know much,
you can (and should) find another salesman or another store.
But another really great thing you can do is compare product
features online. Virtually all decent antivirus products (even
some of the indecent ones) have Web sites that describe fea-
tures and functions in detail, sometimes including screen shots.
Fee or free subscription?
A vital part of an antivirus program is the capability to 
download new virus-definition files from the software vendor.
Without this feature, your antivirus program won’t be worth
much at all — the newest viruses are often the ones that get
you. If your antivirus product isn’t downloading new virus-
definition files, then you’re not protected against the viruses
likeliest to do you harm. Bad.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 53

Virtually all antivirus products have a download feature, so
what’s the point? It’s this: Many vendors let you download
their virus definitions for a limited period of time (usually one
year), after which you must renew your “subscription” if you
want to keep downloading new virus definitions (you do!).
Other antivirus products do not charge for the right to down-
load, but let you do so for free, for as long as you use the
product. However, sooner or later you’ll want to upgrade 
the product itself, so you’ll have to pony up for the software
upgrade. Those are never free! Regardless of how they get
your money in exchange for the service they provide, they get
your money. I think it’s a fair deal. ’Nuff said.
Many computers now come with an antivirus program already
installed — and usually that antivirus program provides full
protection against viruses — but in many cases, the “sub-
scription” is for a short period of time, perhaps just 90 days.
That’s just enough time for you to get used to (and, so the
makers hope, fall in love with) their product, so you won’t
hesitate to purchase a full one-year subscription.
So it’s true that the antivirus vendors want to get on the gravy
train and make money. Ain’t capitalism great?!
My final thought on this: You get what you pay for. I personally
would stay away from a no-name free or nearly-free antivirus
program, and instead stick with the major brand of antivirus
software that I use. Cheap antivirus software is like cheap tires:
How much risk are you willing to accept?
Scanning: Manual and scheduled
You should be able to manually and easily scan individual
files, directories, or your entire computer. An especially nice
feature is the ability to scan right from your Windows
Explorer program by right-clicking a file or directory and
selecting the Scan for Viruses feature.
Likewise, scheduling scans should also be easy to figure out,
and these days it had better be easier than programming a
VCR — even the fancy on-screen-programming models. Just
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
54

make sure you can schedule scans to take place daily, weekly,
or at whatever schedule is appropriate for you.
Compatibility with your 
e-mail program
Even the best antivirus program can’t do its job unless it can
play nice with your e-mail program. Two types of e-mail pro-
grams are the most common:
 Local e-mail clients: If you use a local e-mail client pro-
gram (such as Outlook, Outlook Express, or Eudora) that
connects directly to your Internet service provider,
check to make sure the antivirus program you choose is
compatible with the specific e-mail program you’re using.
 Web e-mail clients: If you use your Web browser to read
and send e-mail, then compatibility with an antivirus pro-
gram is not so much of an issue. This is because e-mail
messages sent to you are not stored on your computer;
instead, they’re stored on your mail-service provider’s
Web server. All the antivirus programs that employ “real-
time” virus detection protect you against viruses that try
to come through Web e-mail clients. This is because
viruses are stored in e-mail attachments — if you try to
download a virus-borne attachment, your antivirus pro-
gram will intercept it when your computer tries to store
the attachment on your hard drive.
Virus-definition updates
Virus-definition updates are like your antivirus program’s “air
supply” — it can’t function well without them. If any feature of
your antivirus program absolutely must be flexible and easy to
use, it’s this function.
If you have a high-speed connection and valuable information
on your computer to protect, then you need to automatically
update your antivirus definitions frequently. If you choose to
do so every hour, or twice a day, or at any time of day or night,
your software should be able to do so easily.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 55

If your needs are more modest — especially if you usually
access the Internet using dial-up — then your antivirus soft-
ware should be able to coax your computer into initiating a
dial-up Internet connection as part of the downloading
process. This capability will also depend on how your 
computer’s Internet connection is configured.
Fix and recovery
It’s nice when an antivirus program is able to detect a virus,
but more important still is, what will the antivirus program do
about it?
Will it say, “Hey bub, I see a virus there, good luck!”?
Or will it tell you, “Say, I see a virus here, and if you’d like to fix
it, you’ll need to visit our Web site for instructions on how to
surgically remove it from your computer”? Nice. (Gee, thanks.)
Or, will your antivirus program say, “There was a virus there,
and I’ve removed it”? That’s my preference — how about you?
Special removal tools
I should say this: It’s one thing to destroy viruses, worms, and
Trojan horses when they’re attempting to infiltrate your com-
puter, but quite another if a virus has already penetrated your
computer. In particular, when a worm has installed itself on a
computer (because the computer’s antivirus signatures weren’t
up to date), the antivirus program does not block the virus
because it doesn’t recognize it as such.
In this case, bringing the antivirus signature files up to date,
and even rescanning the computer to remove any viruses,
may not necessarily be enough to completely eradicate the
virus. This may be true if the virus has employed unusual
methods of installing itself. But the antivirus vendors have 
an answer for this.
Antivirus software vendors build specialized removal tools
that are custom-tailored to remove every last trace of a virus
that has dug its way into your computer’s inner workings.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
56

I suggest that you explore the Web sites of one or more ven-
dors whose antivirus software programs you’re considering.
Check out their specialized removal tools. If there happens to
be a severe outbreak when you read this, it will probably not
be difficult to find removal tools for the current worm or
virus. As it happens, though, old viruses never die, so the
antivirus companies tend to keep all their old virus-removal
tools on the Web site as well.
Other antivirus makers may have what you need
Outside of their apparent fondness for Microsoft applications,
viruses have no brand loyalty. Whichever brand of antivirus
software you eventually choose, you don’t have to stick with
the special virus removal tools offered by your brand. Another
company may offer an effective tool that you can use right
away. For instance, you might use McAfee antivirus software,
but you could easily download a virus-removal tool from
Symantec, Trend Micro, or Computer Associates.
Bundling other features
Market forces have compelled antivirus software makers to
bundle other products or features with their programs. For
instance, many antivirus programs include a firewall, spam
blocker, or pop-up blocker. They’re worth taking a look at in
terms of the additional protection they offer.
Blocking worms and scans with a firewall
Firewall programs have become quite popular, and for good
reason: Many of the threats present today aren’t totally
addressed by antivirus programs.
A lot of hackers scan networks (scanning means that they
send thousands or even millions of network probes through
the Internet) in search of computers that have been config-
ured incorrectly. Such misconfigurations enable the hackers
to exploit security flaws and do these typical dirty deeds:
 Installing backdoor programs and using your computer
(and hundreds or thousands of others) to relay spam
messages all over the Web. Read the sidebar “The Legion
of Zombies” in Chapter 1 to see what a back door is.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 57

 Using your computer to bomb some Web site in a
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The sidebar
“The legion of zombies” in Chapter 1 provides more infor-
mation on DDoS attacks.
 Searching your computer for sensitive personal informa-
tion such as credit-card, bank-account, or tax-ID numbers.
Internet worms are also a threat, although not as serious a
threat as hackers themselves because an up-to-date antivirus
program will prevent a worm from installing itself on your
computer. Still, having a firewall provides some defense in
depth (you know, like adding an alarm system behind your
moat) by blocking the scanning probes sent by hackers and
Internet worms. Worms are described in detail in Chapter 14.
Slaying spam
If you like getting dozens of unsolicited e-mail messages every
day, you can skip this section.
Everybody still with me? Thought so. If you are using a local
e-mail client such as Outlook Express or Eudora, then anti-
spam software can considerably reduce the amount of
unwanted e-mail.
If you use Web-based e-mail, chances are your e-mail provider
(at least the larger ones) is using spam blocking — it might not
be free, though. Something about profit motive comes to mind.
Antispam software accomplishes this improvement in two pri-
mary ways:
 By keyword: The software searches for keywords and
key phrases in all messages; any messages that match
the keywords are blocked.
 By whitelisting: That’s the opposite of blacklisting. Any
message that comes from someone on your list of known
senders (your whitelist) is permitted; all others are
blocked. Simple, huh?
I have some opinions about spam-blocking programs — 
and most industry analysts agree with me (or I with them):
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
58

Although it’s a great idea, spam-blocking software is far from
perfect. This is because the people who write spam try very
hard to build messages that don’t get blocked. It’s a classic
good guys-versus-bad-guys situation online — the good guys
fight the bad guys and their hats don’t even fall off! Go rent an
old John Wayne movie sometime and you’ll see what I’m talk-
ing about.
Flattening pop-ups
Certainly you’ve been to one of those Web sites that plasters
those annoying pop-up ads all over your screen, trying to sell
you life insurance, travel helps, online dating, sex toys, or
(yeah, right) pop-up blockers. Well, maybe the sex toys are
okay, especially the <censored by editor>. Oops. (Just kidding.)
You can do away with those annoying pop-up ads with a spe-
cial pop-up blocking tool, included with some antivirus pro-
grams. Norton AntiVirus and Trend Micro’s PC-Cillin have
available pop-up blockers — but blocking pop-ups is likely to
be included with most antivirus programs before too long.
Neutering spyware
Spyware is a new class of software used to track what you’re
doing on your computer so other people (or companies) can
study how you use it.
If you are not concerned about this potential invasion of 
privacy, I think you should be — but that’s just my opinion,
my unsolicited advice. I’m not about to panic over someone
tracking my Internet-surfing habits, any more than I am about
large grocery-store chains knowing my grocery-purchasing
habits. But others of you may be concerned — perhaps furi-
ous — about this. If you are concerned about online privacy
and spyware, then you should consider getting a spyware
blocker.
You can still find some of the better antispyware available as
separate programs, but I suspect that the smaller of those
software companies are going to be snatched up by the big
antivirus vendors in order to get those cool spyware blockers
bundled with antivirus programs.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 59

You’re probably wondering where to find some of these anti-
spyware programs. I’ll describe some of my favorites here:
 Ad-Aware: This is one of the pioneers, and they keep
making it better.
 Spybot: Another nice one. It blocks ActiveX and JavaScript
controls, and lets you protect some IE browser settings
too. It has nice features for advanced users too.
 Spyware Blaster: A “preventive” antispyware program
that prevents spyware from getting into your computer
in the first place.
You can find all of these at download.com, one of my favorite
places for finding new goodies. Do be careful, though, not to
bloat your computer with too many bells and whistles!
You can also find more ideas for antispyware on my Web site,
www.computervirusesbook.com. (Sorry, long name — you’d
better bookmark it.)
Upgrading and Switching
Brands
The online environment of the Internet continues to mutate
(as do the hackers); users must change their defensive tactics
or suffer (at least) trashed hard drives and lost data. Hype
aside, no one company is likely to have all the answers to all
possible threats for all time. Sooner or later, you pretty much
have to face upgrading your antivirus software — or even
changing vendors.
Reasons to upgrade
Perhaps you already have an antivirus program on your com-
puter, and you are considering upgrading to a newer version
of the program. There are several reasons why you might wish
to upgrade, including:
 The version you have is so old that you can no longer
get virus definitions for it. For a variety of reasons,
antivirus software makers stop producing updates for
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
60

older versions of their software. This is partly because
those older versions just don’t have some of the capabili-
ties that the newer ones have.
 The newer version may be easier to use than the ver-
sion you have today. It is true that “user interfaces” (the
windows, buttons, tabs, and so on that you see when
operating a program) have generally improved on many
products over the years as software producers have
slowly begun to figure out how to make easy-to-use soft-
ware. If your software is more than three years old, then
this may be reason enough!
 The newer version may have more features. The
antivirus software market is becoming increasingly com-
petitive, prompting the antivirus software companies to
keep up with one another. Prices haven’t been dropping,
but instead they keep packing in more features and func-
tions — another benefit of this competition.
 The newer version may work better with your com-
puter’s operating system or e-mail program. No contest
there.
 Your expert friend says it’s a good idea. Well, if your
friend is really an expert and not just someone who 
wants to be, then this can truly be a legitimate reason 
to upgrade. Either way, ask him or her the reason for 
the upgrade. Does the explanation make sense to you?
 You love to buy and install software because it’s fun.
Tell you what: As a gesture of goodwill toward the exotic
planet you must come from, I could ask you over to install
a few fancy programs on my computer, but let’s get yours
done first.
Now, I’m not going to tell you that any of these reasons — or
any others — are enough by themselves to make you consider
upgrading your antivirus software. In the end, it’s up to you.
Think about your current situation and the desired outcome.
Can you get there from here?
Reasons to switch brands
You traitor, you! Seriously, though, there are a number of valid
reasons why you may be considering changing brands of
antivirus software. I’ll go over a few here:
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 61

 You want to change to a well-known brand. I can’t blame
you if you feel like you’re “missing the boat” by sticking
with Bill and Ted’s Most Excellent Antivirus program. This
is a truly legitimate reason to change. The virus threat is
getting more complicated, requiring a larger research-and-
development budget from all antivirus software compa-
nies. The smaller companies are not going to be able to
keep up with the giants.
 You want a more reputable brand of antivirus soft-
ware. If the brand you are using now is associated with
some kind of colossal error, you may be compelled to
switch. Well, it’s important that you use a brand that you
can trust. I can’t offer any hints here — truly I cannot
recall any gaffes perpetrated by any of the major brands.
Little mistakes — sure — but nothing approaching scan-
dal material.
 Other computers in your home or business are using
another brand. Fer shure, it’s easier to do the antivirus
thang if all of the computers are running the same pro-
gram. There is less you have to remember, and it’s pro-
bably more economical to buy 5-license, 10-license, or
25-license packages instead of a lot of single-user licenses.
Consistency is a good thing.
 The brand you want has better features or is easier to
use. The hassle factor alone can be reason enough.
 Your old brand isn’t working. I have switched brands of
antivirus software in the past. The old brand was wasting
my time and making me angry, and their tech support
was next to worthless. So I switched. ’Nuf said!
 Your expert friend is more familiar with a different
brand. A lot can be said about expert friends, especially
when they are real experts and when they are really will-
ing to help you. If this is the case, you might be better off
switching to the one they know. (A real expert can spell
heuristics backwards and explain it to you.)
Oftentimes, switching brands has as much to do with emotion
as it does with performance or compatibility (except for com-
patibility with you). That’s okay — if there’s any software you
need to be comfortable with, it’s your antivirus software. It’s a
lot like automobile tires or insurance: Reliability and perform-
ance are not optional.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
62

Upgrading or switching 
brands safely
Upgrading safely? Switching brands safely? Is there poten-
tial danger involved with upgrading or switching brands 
of antivirus software? Well, yes, there can be. But that’s no
reason to shy away from the task — you just can’t pretend 
it’s a non-issue, either. Here’s what’s going on. . . .
You need to understand the steps involved in the operation 
of switching or upgrading (whichever is the case for you).
Primarily, the reason for this is that there may be a period of
time during which your old antivirus software isn’t running
and the new antivirus software isn’t yet fully functional.
Here’s how the gap in protection can take place. You may need
to remove your old antivirus program before upgrading or
installing the new one. When you remove your old antivirus
program, you are temporarily going without that protection 
on your computer, until you have installed and configured the
new antivirus program.
Here are some guidelines to consider when upgrading or
switching brands:
1. Read the instructions for both your old antivirus and
the new antivirus program before you begin.
2. Keep the old virus software running, if possible.
3. Back up your critical data files.
I talk your ear off about backups in Chapter 12.
4. Disconnect from the Internet if you are able to do 
so during the installation or upgrade; stay that way
until you’re sure the new antivirus software is work-
ing properly.
5. Close all other programs during the install or
upgrade until you are sure that the new antivirus
program is working.
6. Install critical security patches before you begin.
I discuss this topic in detail in Chapter 9.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 63

If you do install one or more patches, I advise you to
run your computer for at least several hours, if not a
day or two, before also changing out your antivirus
software.
7. Reboot before you begin the removal or upgrade
process.
Start with a clean-running system! This is especially
important on the older versions of Windows that —
rumor has it — are equipped with the fabled “time to
crash!” feature.
Checking Out the Purchasing
Venues
It’s time to do some serious window shopping. I don’t know if
you have chosen a brand and model of antivirus software, or
if you’ll “kick the tires” while looking around in order to make
your final decision.
Personally, I don’t like making impulsive decisions when
making a major purchase (and, despite the relatively low price
tag for antivirus software, I consider it a “major purchase”
because of its relatively high importance). Buying antivirus
software is like buying insurance: It’s important to make a
good choice now just in case you need the assistance later.
Remember, however, that with antivirus software, you need
that assistance every day!
Depending upon where you live, you might have good access
to one or more large computer stores; otherwise, you might
have to do your shopping and comparing online.
I do suggest that you do some online shopping; you can 
find out a lot about what’s available by comparing products
online. This is because many computer stores — even the
larger ones — usually carry only two or three brands of
antivirus software — possibly your first or second choice
won’t even be available locally. (For more about buying
online, see the upcoming — you guessed it — “Buying online”
section.)
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
64

Buying at computer stores
Personally I like to do hands-on shopping. Picking up the
package, talking to real salespeople, and readily seeing prices
has a lot of value for me (okay, call me old-fashioned).
Computer stores usually have demo computers, perhaps with
one or more of the brands of antivirus software that you can
look at, test drive, and ask questions about.
But the downside of shopping in computer stores is often the
limited selection and the difficulty of doing a thorough com-
parison between brands. But you can walk out of the store
with an antivirus program, very likely a reputable brand.
If you’re buying a computer from the computer store, you
need to know which antivirus software is included with the
computer. Ask these questions (and perhaps more):
 What brand and version of antivirus software is
included with the computer?
 Is the antivirus software preinstalled, or must I install it
myself? If you are unfamiliar with how to install the soft-
ware, perhaps the store will install it for you, if that will
make you feel better.
 Is the antivirus software fully functional as is, or is it a
limited-function “demo” package? Bottom line, demos
mean you’re under a deadline to shell out more for the
full version before the demo period runs out.
 For what period of time am I entitled to get virus-
definition updates? Often, the antivirus software bundled
with a new computer has a limited-time subscription,
perhaps just 30 or 60 days. Other bundle deals are more
generous and will give you a full year.
Buying online
When choosing a reputable merchant, purchasing antivirus
software online can be a rewarding experience. And if you’re
into instant gratification — or at least instant spending with-
out leaving the house — then online shopping is for you.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 65

Only buy from the maker’s official site
Some may argue this point, but it’s hard to go wrong if you
purchase your antivirus software from the maker’s own Web
site. You’re sure to get the very latest software from its source.
Before deciding to buy from a reseller rather than the official
maker, make sure you will be able to get help if you need it.
Find out where you will be able to get that help. But the time
to investigate this may not be worth the modest savings you
realize.
Do NOT buy from a spammer
I’m a principled individual. I happen to detest spam (in fact,
I’m not sure I know anyone who likes it), and because of that I
refuse to purchase anything from a spammer, and I refuse to
even visit their Web sites. The more that people ignore spam,
the sooner many of the spam operators will go and find a
more reputable line of work (like telemarketing or used car
sales) and leave your inbox alone.

66
Can you download it again?
If you purchase the download version
of antivirus software (or, indeed, any
other software), you’ll either be down-
loading the full product or a small
installer program. If you get the full
product, you could always burn it onto
a CD-ROM in case you need to install
it again, say, after you upgrade your
operating system or you upgrade your
computer.
But if you need to reinstall your
antivirus software, will its maker
permit you to download it again?
Honestly, I haven’t checked this out
with every antivirus company, but I’ve
seen it both ways: one company
wants to charge you $6.95 for what
they call “download service” — the
right to download the product again if
you have to — and another company
lets you download the product for
free, as many times as necessary.
Those companies that charge this
fee are not going to tell you this up-
front, however. They wait until you’re
in the checkout line and you’re
already writing the check. By then
they’ve got you! Perhaps the best
way to find this out is to load up the
download version into your online
shopping cart, and pay attention as
you get into the checkout line. If you
see an offer that permits unlimited
downloads for a fee, then you need to
figure that into the total cost.

Direct download or CD?
When purchasing antivirus software (and most other software)
online, you often have the choice of directly downloading 
the software, or you can purchase a CD to be shipped to you.
Often there’s a discount for purchasing the download, because
you’re saving the software vendor a few dollars (and only a few
dollars).
But let me tell you my personal preference: Buy the CD. There
are several good reasons why you would want to do so:
 If your computer crashes, you won’t have to re-download
your antivirus software. Instead, you can load it directly
from the CD.
 If you upgrade your computer, you can just reinstall your
antivirus software from the CD, which will probably be
faster than downloading it again.
 If you must remove and reinstall your antivirus software,
you wouldn’t necessarily want to keep your computer
online without virus protection during the entire down-
load procedure.
 Some antivirus companies use a bootable CD that can be
used to boot up, scan, and clean your system should you
have a particularly nasty virus that can’t be fixed by any
other means. I find this more elegant and effective than
creating a boot disk.
Installing Antivirus Software
This is the “let’s do it!” part of the chapter where you get to
actually do something. For those of you who are squirming at
the chance to install software, you’re almost there!
Do yourself a favor, though. Read and follow the checklist
below before you begin installing your antivirus software.
If you’re like me and you want to begin building the ready-
to-assemble furniture or child’s bicycle before reading the
instructions, be prepared to have minutes — or hours — of
regret later. I’m not kidding. The regret I speak of could be as
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 67

minor as some lost time, or as great as losing files you cannot
afford to be without. This is especially true if you make your
living with your computer — whether you peddle prescription
drugs online, sell things on eBay, or write books.
Here’s what to do before installing your antivirus software:
 Back up your files: I don’t mean copy them to another
directory on the same hard drive — that would be like
making copies of important documents and putting them
in the same drawer. Convenient — until you have a fire.
Instead, copy everything to another computer, or to a
CD-ROM that you have verified is readable on another
computer. Chapter 12 discusses backups in more detail.
 Reboot your system: ’Tis better to have a clean-running
system that’s not teetering on the edge of a crash because
too many days have passed since the last reboot. (That’s
especially a problem on older Windows systems such as
Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows ME.)
 Stop all of your other programs: This includes all of the
clutter in your systray, half of which you probably don’t
need or use anyway.
 Read all the way through the antivirus program installa-
tion and/or upgrade instructions: Wouldn’t you just hate
yourself if Step 46 said to do something that’s really hard
to do without a specific preparation that’s only mentioned
in Step 46? (I’m not much of a cook, and many times I’ve
regretted not reading the recipe all the way through before
starting, only to find that I lacked some important ingredi-
ent or didn’t have enough time to prepare.)
 Take notes: Write down some of the essential things along
the way — you may wish you had those little tidbits of
data later. A few examples include the name of the direc-
tory where you installed the software, and the installation
options that you chose.
 Take your time: If you hurry, you’re more likely to skip an
important step or make a mistake. It’s more important to
install your antivirus software correctly than quickly. You
have to live with the results, probably for a long time.
Quality doesn’t take shortcuts, and neither should you.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
68

 Consider getting help: If installing software feels as
intimidating as rebuilding an automobile engine or pro-
gramming a VCR, then consider having a PC expert help
you out, or at least watch over your shoulder and tact-
fully refrain from snickering to him- or herself.
Following a typical installation
sequence
I’ll skip the open-the-package and save-everything-in-it steps. I
figure you know how to do these things already. The following
sections provide step-by-step instructions on the process of
actually installing (what a concept) your antivirus software.
Step 1: Remove old antivirus software
Am I contradicting myself? Earlier in this chapter I tell you 
to keep your old antivirus software running while you install
your new software. Although this is generally right, it may be
terribly wrong. There are two possibilities (and the only way
to figure out which is right is to read the documentation with
your antivirus software):
 The software vendor wants you to keep your old version
running. This is more likely the case if you’re staying with
the same brand of antivirus software and just upgrading
(the installation sequence for the new program may
remove the old version automatically and even import
your old settings).
 The software vendor wants you to uninstall your old
antivirus software. Some antivirus programs fight each
other to the death, like two capons (male chickens, for
lack of a better word that the FCC won’t fine me for) in
the same pen, if you try to install one while the other is
running. And, as an added bonus, you get to clean up the
aftermath.
If you need to remove your old antivirus software, follow
these steps:
1. Open the Windows control panel by choosing Start➪
Settings➪Control Panel.
2. Select Add/Remove Programs.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 69

3. Find your old antivirus program on the list, click it,
and answer the questions to remove the software.
It’s possible that there is more than one entry associ-
ated with your old antivirus program, so you’ll need to
go back and get them all. See Figure 4-1 for an example
of the box that appears when you’ve found one to
uninstall.
Figure 4-1: Removing your old antivirus software.
Step 2: Run the installation program
If you downloaded your new antivirus software from the
vendor’s Web site, go ahead and run that installation program
now. If you are installing from a CD, insert the CD and follow the
installation instructions (which may include booting your com-
puter from the CD and performing some preliminary scans).
You will probably have several decisions to make, such as
these:
 The directory where the software should be installed:
Just go with the default.
 Whether it should perform a complete virus scan of
your computer: Be patient and let it go through this
process.
 Whether you want the program to install a system tray
icon: Hint: You do!
 Whether the antivirus program should start when the
computer reboots: Yes, yes, yes!
 Whether the antivirus program should check remov-
able media (floppy, CD, and so on) before the computer
is shut down. Yes, to prevent booting your computer
from a virus-infected floppy or CD.
 Whether the antivirus program should monitor all com-
puter hard drive operations to check for viruses as they
try to install themselves. Yes, do this.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
70

 Whether the antivirus program should look for viruses
in some types of files, or in all types of files. I vote for
all types of files. This is not a corner for cutting.
 Whether the antivirus program should regularly scan
your entire computer for viruses. Most definitely yes!
Step 3: Connect to the Internet
The new antivirus software is going to need to download the
very latest virus definitions. The definitions on the CD or
download are likely to be at least several weeks or months
old, which is an eternity in Internet time.
You may have to tell your antivirus program how to connect
to the Internet. Some antivirus programs are smart enough to
figure this out; others are as dumb as a post and need to be
told every little detail:
 If you have a cable modem, DSL, or some other “always
on” Internet connection, then you will need to choose
the “Direct Connection” option: The option may be
worded differently — software vendors usually try to be
original, so there are different words and phrases that
describe the same thing. Have a look at Figure 4-2.
 If you dial up to the Internet using ISDN or your phone
line, then you will need to tell your antivirus program
how this is done: The smarter antivirus programs will
automatically delve into your computer’s network con-
nection configuration and figure this out for you; others
are not so smart and will need to be spoon-fed.
To find your network configuration settings, go into your
Network Connections configuration (Start➪Settings➪
Control Panel➪Network Connections). See how your
computer connects to the Internet (such as a dial-up 
connection, a LAN connection, and so on). Go back to 
the Internet Properties (refer to Figure 4-2) and see what
“dialer” is used to connect to the Internet. The dialers are
the items in the window right below Dial-up and Virtual
Private Network Settings.
Chapter 4: Obtaining and Installing Antivirus Software 71

Figure 4-2: Internet properties.
Step 4: Scan your computer for viruses
After getting the latest virus definitions, your new antivirus
program will want to scan your entire computer for viruses.
Do not skip this step. If your computer had been limping along
on nonexistent, poorly functioning, or out-of-date antivirus
software, there’s a real chance that a virus got in. Get rid of it
as soon as possible.
Step 5: Reboot your computer
Chances are the antivirus installation sequence will require
one or more reboots. Pay attention to whether it asks you to
remove the CD before rebooting (if you installed from a CD).
Creating rescue disks
Installation is not complete until you have made your rescue
disk(s).
What’s a rescue disk for? Generally, if you’re unable to boot
your computer because of a virus, a Rescue Disk just might
save your day — it can get your computer running so you can
do battle with the intruder. Go to Chapter 7 to read about
using a Rescue Disk.
Typical setting for “always-on” connections.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
72

Open your antivirus program and look for the “Create a
Rescue Disk” feature — most antivirus programs have this. If
yours has this, go ahead and do it now: After all the time
you’ve spent researching, buying, and installing, creating a
Rescue Disk is probably the best five minutes you’ll spend.
Figure 4-3 shows a Rescue Disk in mid-creation with McAfee
VirusScan.
You’ll need a floppy disk. After you create the rescue disk, be
sure to write-protect it, label it, and keep it in a safe place!

oing to the trouble to properly configure your antivirus 
software can make your life easier down the road. Isn’t 
it easier — and less stressful — to set up your antivirus soft-
ware to update its database of computer viruses automatically
at night, as you dream of relaxing on the beach of a tropical
paradise, than to have to put your latest deadline on hold
because a killer worm is ravaging computers across the world
and you haven’t updated your antivirus signatures in a month?
Antivirus software programs have a multitude of settings, 
configurations, check boxes, and other gizmos that, although
appearing complicated at first, are really simple after you
understand what they’re for and how they work. This chapter
is where you get to sit at the controls of your antivirus soft-
ware and begin turning the knobs. Go ahead; show your
antivirus software who’s boss!

Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
76
Setting Your Computer 
Boot Options
In this section I talk you through the configuration settings
associated with your computer’s startup sequence. These are
important options because you need to be assured that your
computer is free of Master Boot Record (MBR) and boot sector
viruses (viruses that reside not in files but in the hard drive’s
master boot record or a floppy disk’s boot sector). Also, you
want your antivirus program to automatically start up when
your computer starts so that protection against viruses begins
the minute your computer is up and running.
I can tell you from personal experience that although I’m a dili-
gent and experienced computer user, sometimes I forget to do
even the most routine tasks on my computer. If I had to rely on
my memory to start my antivirus program, I’m sure I’d have
been smitten a number of times over the years. (Good thing all
my body parts are permanently attached, or I’d forget them,
too. Let’s not go there.)
Antivirus program starts 
at computer’s startup
The option that starts your antivirus software as soon as 
your computer boots up is nonnegotiable. You’ve got to have
your antivirus program start up automatically. Depending 
on which version of Windows you’re using — and which
brand of antivirus software you have — this could mean that
the antivirus program is up and running even before you get
to the login prompt. This is a very good thing: You want your
antivirus program running as soon as possible. Figure 5-1
shows the startup options available in the McAfee VirusScan
suite (note the automatic-startup option in the first check box).
Scanning computer memory
Like starting at bootup (which I describe above), memory scan-
ning is another nonnegotiable item, even though every brand of
antivirus software handles this feature a bit differently. For sure

you want your antivirus program to scan your computer’s
memory, because some viruses are memory-resident — that
means the little monster will quietly sit in your computer’s
memory, licking its chops and waiting for unwitting victims to
ensnare — or perhaps it just snoozes until its little alarm clock
goes off, and then . . . boom!
Anyway, some antivirus programs will scan your computer’s
memory at startup, in case any viruses are lurking there. If
your particular antivirus program displays this characteristic
as an option, then you should definitely turn this option on.
Further, some products permit you to scan your computer’s
memory on demand, much like you would scan a file, direc-
tory, or floppy disk. Figure 5-2 illustrates this capability.
Scanning floppy disks 
and CD-ROMs
One nice characteristic of some antivirus programs is that
they can scan any removable media for viruses when your
computer is shutting down — whether your computer is
restarting or going down entirely. If this option is available in
your antivirus program, you should enable it.
Figure 5-1: Automatic start at boot time is a must-have feature.
Chapter 5: Configuring Antivirus Software 77

Figure 5-2: Some antivirus products permit you to scan memory 
on demand.
Here is why scanning removable media is important: If you are
restarting your computer, and if your computer has a bootable
floppy disk or CD-ROM inserted, then — depending on your
computer’s configuration — your computer may restart itself
from the floppy disk or CD-ROM. If the floppy disk or CD-ROM
has a boot-sector virus, then your computer could become
infected with that virus before the antivirus program has an
opportunity to detect it.
Configuring Automatic
Protection
Most antivirus programs operate in two primary modes:
 They’re used to “scan” your entire computer (or a part 
of it) for viruses that may already be present there.
 They’re used to actively monitor your computer’s activi-
ties — in particular, that part of Windows that controls
the creating, opening, and closing of computer files — 
so the antivirus program can examine each active file 
for signs of a virus.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
78

The latter function is automatic, and it has a variety of names.
Symantec calls it Auto-Protect (the Auto-Protect configuration
screen is shown in Figure 5-3), while McAfee uses the term
ActiveShield. But whatever the name, the function is the same:
Your antivirus program is actively preventing a file with a virus
from being implanted in your computer in the first place. This
is a Very Good Thing™.
Figure 5-3: Automatic protection is a beneficial feature.
Scheduling Scans
Having your antivirus program scan the entire computer for
viruses is a necessity. Even though most antivirus programs
have an auto-protect feature that should — theoretically —
prevent the insertion of a virus onto your computer, it’s still a
good idea to scan your computer periodically in the event
something was missed somehow by the automatic protection.
I recommend that you scan your computer once per week. But
(as I’ve said elsewhere in this book) if you’re like me and prone
to forgetfulness, then you need to have your computer do your
remembering for you — and do its weekly scan on its own.
When to scan
When scheduling periodic scans, choose a day and time 
when you know your computer will be running. It’s no good 
Chapter 5: Configuring Antivirus Software 79

to schedule a scan for Friday night at 10:00 p.m. if your com-
puter is turned off. The antivirus program will not wake up
your computer if it isn’t running — but if it’s already running,
then it doesn’t need to be awakened. (Oh, I think you know
what I mean.)
If your computer is in standby or hibernation mode (common
battery-saving modes on laptops), your antivirus program will
not wake it up to scan. It’s got to be fully awake and running at
the appointed time. On the plus side, your monitor needn’t 
be on.
One other factor to take into account for your weekly scan: Run
it when your computer is running but when you’re not using it.
If you have one of those high-speed Internet connections (such
as cable or DSL), then perhaps you keep your computer on all
the time anyway. If so, then you can just schedule your scan to
take place, say, on Fridays at 1:00 a.m. (or whenever you’re rou-
tinely not using the computer).
Manual or automatic?
If you turn your computer off when you’re not using it, then
you may need to change your habits a little bit — if you can
get beyond the hassle — so the scan can run when you’re not
using the computer.
But why make a fuss about running a virus scan when you’re
not using the computer? Well, the computer needs all its
resources to do the scan efficiently. If you’re using your com-
puter for just about anything else while a virus scan is run-
ning, it’s generally not a fun experience. A virus scan makes
your computer dog-slow, miserably-slow, because the scan-
ning program has to examine each of the 20,000–50,000 files
on your computer, checking every one for any of the 60,000+
known viruses. That is a lot of work for the computer to do.
If you really want to see for yourself, I suggest you run a virus
scan while you’re using your computer for something else.
Within moments, if your experience is like mine, your com-
puter will be running very slowly. Watching eternity wear
away while your commands try to get a word in edgewise.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
80

If your computer is generally turned on only while you’re
using it (and only then), you have a choice to make: Either
you need to scan the computer while you’re using it, or you
need to change your work habits to accommodate the scan.
For instance, turn on your computer first thing in the morn-
ing, and run the virus scan while you’re off taking a shower,
eating a meal, meeting with other people, practicing the
accordion, or whatever. Or run the scan at some other time
when the computer is on but you’re not using it for anything
but the scan. (Siesta, anyone?)
What to scan
Thankfully, figuring out what to scan is easier than knowing
when to scan. Here’s what this means: The antivirus program
can be configured to scan different types of files. A file’s type
is determined by the last three letters of the file’s name. For
example, the file scanlog.txt is a text file, because the last
three letters of the file’s name (called its extension) are txt,
meaning text file. A file ending in .EXE is a program — or exe-
cutable — file, and a file ending in .CAB is a cabinet file, a spe-
cial kind of archive file used by Windows.
There are dozens — even hundreds or thousands — of file
types in use today. But the good news is that you don’t need
to know all these different file types. Why? Simple: The best
thing is to scan all types of files! That’s right: If you scan every
type of file that there is now, or ever will be in the future, then
you’re 100 percent covered.
Fortunately, most antivirus programs do this comprehensive
scan by default, but they still give you a choice. This is because
a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, viruses only infected
.EXE and .COM file types, so scanning only those was all you
needed to do. But then other types of viruses came along, 
and you had to scan more and more types of files, until the
antivirus program makers got smart and added the option,
scan all types of files. So this option to specify which types of
file to scan is sort of a leftover from those earlier days.
You can, however, also tell your antivirus program which types
of files not to scan — an exclusion list. But for the vast majority
of readers, you do not need to tell your antivirus program
which types of files to skip. You can just leave this blank.
Chapter 5: Configuring Antivirus Software 81

Scheduling Updates
Next to scheduling scans, scheduling virus-signature updates is
one of the most important ways to use your antivirus program.
Getting updates is what your antivirus program does when it
needs to get information on all of the latest viruses. It is impor-
tant to keep your antivirus program up to date in order to stop
any of the new viruses that are circulating around.
Most human beings don’t remember to do these updates — or
have better things to do than chase all over the Internet look-
ing for new virus signatures. This is why antivirus programs
let you specify how often to do the updates automatically.
Then the antivirus program can go and do the updates all by
itself without your having to remember.
System Restore can restore viruses
Starting with Windows XP Profes-
sional, Microsoft introduced a new fea-
ture in Windows that gives us another
“out” in case we experience computer
problems. System Restore is used to
“roll back” the operating system to a
known working state. System Restore
only touches the operating system, not
your files, so System Restore doesn’t
roll everything back, just the operating
system changes.
So if your computer catches a virus,
the virus will be archived in the
System Restore repository, out of
reach of antivirus programs. You can
unwittingly set the virus free from its
prison if you find that you have to
restore your system to an earlier
known-working state with System
Restore. A virus that may have been
snuffed out is suddenly alive on your
computer again!
What to do? First, if you have to do a
System Restore, I suggest you imme-
diately scan your entire computer for
viruses, in case you brought one
back from the grave. Next, refer to
your antivirus program’s Web site for
updates, in the event that its makers
figure out how to scan the System
Restore repository.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
82

How you connect to the Internet
Your antivirus program needs to know how you connect to
the Internet. If you have a high-speed cable modem or DSL
connection, you would tell the antivirus program that you
have a “direct” connection.
If, on the other hand, you’re a twentieth-century throwback
who uses dial-up access to connect to the Internet, I promise
not to tell, but you do have a bit more configuring to do. (Flip
over to Chapter 4 for a refresher on how your computer con-
nects to the Internet.)
How often to update
How frequently you will need to update your antivirus defini-
tions depends on three factors:
 The nature of your Internet connection. Is it dial-up?
DSL? Cable? If it’s one of the latter (or another variety of
high-speed connection), update frequently.
 How vital your computer is to you. Do you use it to
make your living? If you do (or if it performs some other
function that you can’t do without), update frequently.
 What kinds of activities you perform on your computer.
Do you receive great bogs of e-mail every day? You
guessed it: Update frequently.
If you use dial-up connectivity, do only a little e-mail, use Web-
based mail (where your service provider may be scanning your
messages for you), or mostly use your computer for entertain-
ment, then you can update less frequently. (Hard-core gamers,
conversely, may want take into consideration the amount of
time they’ve invested in working up to demigod level in their
favorite computer game and update a bit more frequently, as
well.)
So, how often to update? Well, after you assess the level of
risk you’re comfortable with, you can follow the guidelines in
Table 5-1.
Chapter 5: Configuring Antivirus Software 83

Table 5-1
How Often to Update Virus Signatures
How Often to Update
Your Usage Patterns
Every three days
Dial-up connection to the Internet
Low volume of e-mail
Hobby and entertainment
Every day
Dial-up or high-speed Internet 
connection
More e-mail
Some file sharing
Every four hours
High-speed, “always-on” Internet 
connection
High volume of e-mail
Lots of file sharing
If your computer activities are high-risk and/or high-value,
then it makes sense to update the antivirus signatures more
frequently. If this is important to you, then you should be sure
to choose an antivirus product that lets you specify how fre-
quently it will check for updates.
Unlike scanning your computer for viruses, updates are fairly
low-impact. If you have a high-speed “always on” connection,
you could update your virus definitions every hour if you like.
In fact, if your usage patterns entailed lower risk (say, if you
have a low volume of e-mail, or use the computer for hobbies
and entertainment), you could still update as frequently as
every hour if you have a high-speed, always-on connection.
Why not? The antivirus software company does not limit how
frequently you are permitted to check for updates, so it’s
really up to you.
If you are still not sure how often to update your virus signa-
tures, generally you’ll be fine as long as you update at least
once each week. It’s better to check for updates more fre-
quently, but more frequently than every hour or two is
overkill.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
84

If you’re still wavering, set your antivirus program to update
once per day. Don’t be too surprised if you feel better 
afterward.
Configuring Heuristics
Heuristics? Huh? Well, no, it doesn’t mean running in panicky
circles. But it plays a role in virus detection because of two
factors:
 Viruses are created all the time — over twenty new ones
each day. Even if your antivirus program checks for virus-
signature updates very frequently, there is still some risk
that you can catch a virus before your antivirus company
creates a signature for it.
 Most viruses exhibit predictable behavior patterns.
There are a number of things that most viruses do that
the antivirus companies are very familiar with.
These two factors have led the antivirus companies to employ
a new way of detecting viruses — by carefully observing the
Windows operating system for the typical patterns that most
viruses exhibit. For instance, many viruses attempt to attach
themselves to program files. The antivirus program can watch
for this type of behavior and block it. This method detects
viruses by observing their effects, as opposed to checking
files for matches against the virus-signature file.
If the antivirus program you’re using has such a heuristics set-
ting, it would be a good idea to turn it on. You never know when
you might be unfortunate enough to catch a virus, especially
one that is so new that your antivirus maker hasn’t made an
entry for your signature file yet. Heuristics can make your com-
puter much safer.
When a new virus is released, many people fall victim before
the virus is captured by any of the antivirus companies.
Anyone can be such a target, and heuristics is the only thing
available to stop new viruses. Or, you could just turn off your
computer (yeah, right).
Chapter 5: Configuring Antivirus Software 85

Configuring E-Mail Protection
Because e-mail is one of the chief means of transporting
viruses, most antivirus programs have options that help them
work with your e-mail program. This only applies when you
are using a “local” e-mail program to read and send mail, and
not when you are using a Web browser to handle your mail.
The options that you’ll most likely see are used to specify
whether your antivirus program should scan incoming mail
messages, and whether it should scan outgoing mail mes-
sages. If you see such options, you should turn them on.
Your antivirus program might install buttons in your e-mail
program that permit you to scan specific messages (or all
messages) in the inbox or another mail folder. There could
also be a button installed on e-mail that will let you open your
antivirus program right from within your e-mail program.
Configuring Instant Messaging
Protection
As instant messaging (IM) rises in popularity, it has become
the new way for viruses to jump from computer to computer.
Consequently, it would be nice if your antivirus program was
aware of your IM activity so it could watch for any suspicious
activity indicative of a virus.
Configuration for IM in your antivirus program may be no
more than a check box or two. Does the antivirus program
watch IM or not? If it can, I recommend that you tell it to do
so. (After all, you’ve paid for some protection, right?)

n this chapter, I help you scan your computer and e-mail for
viruses. This is an essential chore that you’ve got to do on 
a regular basis in order to ensure that your computer is free of
viruses. In many cases, you can configure your antivirus pro-
gram to automatically perform this scan as often as necessary.
Because this feature can save you time and trouble, I show you
how to make the necessary configuration choices in Chapter 5.
I also show you how to manually scan the e-mail in your mail-
box. Some antivirus programs include this feature; it’s a con-
venient way to double-check the cleanliness of your inbox.
Deciding to Scan Your 
Computer File-by-File
Scanning your computer doesn’t ring up its price, and you
needn’t concern yourself with the age-old dilemma, paper or
plastic? But directing your antivirus software to conduct a

Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
88
thorough file-by-file scan (or search) of your computer using
an updated virus signature file (like a book of virus finger-
prints) is the second half of your antivirus software’s one-two
punch against viruses. Permit me to explain.
Antivirus programs use two main methods to detect viruses:
 Automatic protection: Antivirus programs can (and do)
carefully watch all of your computer’s hard drive activity
while you’re doing whatever you do on your computer. If
your computer is about to copy a file containing a virus
to the hard drive (or floppy, or CD-ROM), the antivirus
program will detect this and immediately intervene to
block the action. For the scoop on configuring automatic
protection and heuristics, see Chapter 5.
 Scanning: A scan is different from real-time protection. 
A scan is a one-time file-by-file examination of your entire
computer — sort of a house-by-house search — looking
for viruses that may be hiding inside of a program or 
document.
You can also do a scan of removable media such as floppy
disks and CD-ROMs before you use them. And if you’re in an
environment that has a file server (which should have its own
antivirus program), you can scan files on the server.
The automatic real-time method for detecting viruses, which I
explain in the previous section, isn’t 100-percent reliable. I’m
not implying that there is something wrong with antivirus pro-
grams. But there are some ways that viruses can circumvent
your antivirus defenses.
If you scan your entire computer say, every week, on the other
hand, then by the time your next weekly scan occurs, chances
are that your antivirus program will have downloaded a new
virus definition that includes a signature for the new virus. The
weekly scan will then detect the virus that the automatic
detector missed.
Your antivirus program actually can be circumvented in two
ways:
 New or unknown viruses: Your antivirus program can
only stop viruses that it knows about. If a brand-new
virus pops up on the Internet, it’s possible (though not

really likely) that it will get to your computer before your
antivirus company can get a virus definition file with the
new virus’s signature into your computer.
If your computer gets one of these brand-new viruses, it
could also be spreading the virus to other computers
without your knowing it. Not a good way to treat friends.
(And what if they find out that you are sending them
viruses?)
 Computer malfunctions: A computer malfunction can
also make it vulnerable to viruses. For instance, perhaps
your antivirus program had some kind of a strange prob-
lem that caused it to stop watching for viruses in its
“real-time” module. The antivirus program might get sick
on its own accord, or a malfunction elsewhere in the
computer’s hardware or software might cause it to freak
out and stop working. Not a way to start your day.
A user malfunction can invite troubles, too. One thing 
I’ve seen a few times is a situation where the installation
procedure for a new program asks you to temporarily dis-
able your automatic virus protection to prevent it from
interfering with the installation. If you forget to reactivate
your antivirus program’s automatic protection, then any
virus — new and old — can walk right in if it gets the
chance.
Scanning for Viruses
I explain in the previous section why scans are needed, so in
this section, I present the how side of the equation. You have
choices about how you scan your computer. You can scan
automatically or manually, and, within manual scans, you can
scan your entire computer or you can scan one file, one direc-
tory, the CD-ROM drive, and so on.
In Chapter 5, I explain how to configure your antivirus pro-
gram to automatically scan your entire computer. Put your
thumb on this page and go to Chapter 5 to see how to set up
those automatic scans.
You can also manually scan your entire computer — or just a
part of it — any time you like. Stick with me in the following
sections to see how to manage a manual scan.
Chapter 6: Scanning Your Computer and E-Mail 89

Scanning the entire computer
The brute-force method of scanning your computer is to look
at the entire hard drive and every file in it. It’s actually pretty
easy to tell your antivirus software to do this — just scan
drive C:, or all hard drives, or however your antivirus program
offers the choices to you.
There are probably ten thousand or more files on your com-
puter, and probably many times more than that. Your antivirus
software is meticulous and actually enjoys examining every
blade of grass in the field. Not much else to do, I guess.
To scan your entire computer for viruses, follow these steps:
1. Open your antivirus program and run the Scan 
command.
Each program is a bit different, but the Scan command
is usually a button or hyperlink toward the top of the
main interface screen.
2. Select the drive letter that corresponds to your 
computer’s hard drive.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
90
Why does scanning take so long?
Scanning your entire hard drive could
take an hour or longer. This depends
upon many factors, including:
 The speed of your computer’s
processor
 The size of your hard drive
 The speed of your hard drive
 The number of files on your hard
drive
 The extent of fragmentation on
your hard drive
 Your patience
So it’s hard to say how long it should
take, but here’s why it takes so 
long. . . .
There are over 60,000 known viruses
today, and your antivirus program has
“signatures” on each one of them in
your computer’s virus definition file.
When your antivirus program scans
for viruses, it opens each of the over-
ten-thousand files on your computer,
and examines each one for the pres-
ence of all of these viruses.
Frankly, given the sheer size of this
task, I am amazed that virus scanning
is so fast!

Most programs give you a choice of which drive letter
to scan.
If your computer’s hard drive is divided into two or
more drive letters, you’ll need to scan each one. And
likewise, if your computer has more than one hard
drive, then you’ll need to scan each one. It’s possible,
though, that your antivirus program has an All Hard
Drives option, which makes this easier. Then, some-
where, you’ll find a Start Scan (or Begin, Go, Giddyup,
whatever) button to get the scan started.
Figure 6-1 shows a scan in progress using Panda
Antivirus Platinum.
Scanning a file or directory
Most antivirus programs, in addition to letting you scan your
entire computer for viruses, also give you the ability to scan
individual files and directories.
Some antivirus programs require you to open the antivirus
program, select the scan option, and then browse to the file(s)
or directory(ies) you wish to scan. This works, but it’s not all
that convenient.
Other antivirus programs have gone a step further: They have
integrated their program right into Windows Explorer so you
can right-click a file or directory and select the Scan for
Viruses option without having to open your antivirus program
at all. Cool huh?! See Figure 6-2 for an example of this.
Figure 6-1: A virus scan in progress.
Chapter 6: Scanning Your Computer and E-Mail 91

Figure 6-2: Scanning for viruses from within Windows Explorer.
How often to scan
As I mention in Chapter 5, you need to periodically scan your
entire computer for viruses if you want to be completely sure
that your computer is virus-free. For a number of reasons,
your antivirus program’s real-time virus protection is not infal-
lible. (I hope you’re not getting tired of me making this point.
Viruses are so much more tiresome.)
But how often is often enough? If I were forced to give a gen-
eral answer to fit most users’ purposes, I would have to say
that scanning your entire computer for viruses once per week
is about right.
Some of you, though, should scan more frequently; it depends
on what you do with your computer. For instance, if you make
your living on your computer by day-trading stocks, getting
rich (yeah right) on eBay, or writing For Dummies books, then
you have a lot more to lose than if you do a little e-mail and
surf the Net now and then. So the economic value of your
computer may prompt you to scan more often for viruses.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
92

If you are engaged in doing a lot of downloads or file sharing
(the legal kind, of course), or you have a habit of opening the
attachments in e-mail messages from people you don’t know
(and I have some can’t-miss land in Florida to sell you if you do),
then you are increasing your risk of catching a virus. If you fall
into this high-risk group, then you’ve got to scan your com-
puter more often to be sure that your computer is virus-free.
Scheduling Scans
Because whole-computer scans take so long and make your
computer so sluggish, you might schedule your computer 
to do its scans at a regular time when you’re not using it.
Personally, I have my antivirus program scan my entire com-
puter on Mondays at 1:00 a.m. Sometimes I stay up late on 
the computer on Sunday nights, but never that late. On my
computer, the scan takes two or three hours, so even if I get
up really early on Monday morning, the scan is usually done
by the time I’m back on the computer.
You should think of a good time when your computer is always
on (this is harder on laptop computers as many of us put them
on “standby” or “hibernate” when we’re not using them) and
schedule the scan for a time when you’re not using it. This is
just my personal preference. It’s also possible that the newest
and very fastest computers can better handle a full-computer
virus scan while running heavyweight software such as Internet
Explorer (a little sarcasm there) at the same time.
Evaluating Online Scanning
Services
Some well-known makes of antivirus software have introduced
Web-based virus scanning. You can go to one of these Web sites
and click the Scan my computer for viruses link. The Web page
downloads a small program that will then scan your entire com-
puter for viruses — usually for free (such a deal!).
While there are some drawbacks to this approach, it can be
quite useful in some situations. For instance, you could do
one of these scans on a computer that doesn’t have antivirus
Chapter 6: Scanning Your Computer and E-Mail 93

software, or whose antivirus software isn’t working at the
moment. It’s also potentially useful to permit a second pro-
gram (the online scanner in this case) to have a look at your
computer to see if your computer is really free of viruses.
Some of the online scanning programs will remove a virus if
they detect one, while others can detect but not remove.
Depending upon your motivation, you might choose one online
scanning tool over another. Or, you could try a different one
each time. Figure 6-3 shows a popular online virus-scanning
tool.
Personally, I think that the online scanning tools exist for pro-
motional reasons. When an online scanning tool finds a virus,
could easily say something like, “Saaaay, I’ve found a virus
here, but you’ll have to buy our antivirus product at full price
in order to fix it.” Ka-ching! Sarcasm aside, these online scan-
ning tools have their usefulness.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
94
Can online scan programs be trusted?
Okay, call me paranoid (hah! that’s
what they want you to believe. . . .).
But as an information-security pro-
fessional, I find that paranoia — well,
caution — is a trait that leads to a
long and productive career in this
business. In this day and age, how
can one be sure that the online virus-
scanning tool is doing what it’s sup-
posed to, and nothing else?
Personally, I put more trust in an
antivirus program that I buy at the
local computer retailer than I do in an
online virus-scanning program. But
only a tiny bit more.
True, you have to have faith to con-
nect to the Internet, and you have to
have some level of trust just to use
the Internet. So I’ll compromise and
tell you this: You can trust the online
scanning tools offered by the major
antivirus makers, as long as
 You 
have 
security 
patches
installed (one or more patches
have addressed the problem
associated with knowing what
Web site you are actually visiting).
 You do not visit the online scan
Web page by clicking a URL in an
unsolicited mail message. You do
not want to be a victim of one of
those “phishing” scams! (I talk
about phishing scams and other
sleazy tricks in Chapter 14.)
 You do not use Phil and George’s

Scanning E-mail
I know that some readers are going to wonder whether their
antivirus software automatically scans incoming mail mes-
sages for viruses. If your antivirus software has automatic
virus detection, then yes, your antivirus program will auto-
matically scan each inbound message for viruses.
However, there are some additional features found on some
antivirus programs when used with some local e-mail pro-
grams. Specifically, you could find that your e-mail program
has a Scan for Antivirus button on the toolbar (as shown in
Figure 6-4), where you can select one or more messages and
scan all of those selected messages for viruses.
This is like a manual scan for viruses, except that this scanning
can be done from inside of your e-mail program. Presumably
your antivirus program already scanned all of the messages 
in your inbox when they arrived. But, if a new virus is on the
loose, and you’ve just been able to download the latest virus
signature database that includes this new virus, then scanning
messages you already have would tell you whether any of
those messages have this brand-new virus.
Chapter 6: Scanning Your Computer and E-Mail 95

Figure 6-4: Some antivirus programs place a button in 
your e-mail program.
I won’t go so far as to recommend that you manually rescan
all of your mail for new viruses. But if you are among the
legion of the ultra-careful (whose only worry is whether
they’re paranoid enough), then by all means rescan your
e-mail from time to time; a clean computer is a balm to the
worried mind.
By default, the regular periodic scan of your entire computer
also scans your e-mail. The reason that your e-mail is also
scanned is that the mail messages on your computer are
stored in files on the hard drive, just like your documents,
programs, and other stuff. The scan-your-e-mail button is
available more for your convenience (for example, by allowing
you to scan only your e-mail rather than the entire hard drive)
than as a necessity.
Here is a useful example of the capability to scan messages
from within your e-mail program: Before opening certain
e-mail messages, you could re-scan messages if you think
there is any possibility of their harboring a virus.

Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
96

Scanning outbound e-mail
The preceding section deals primarily with scanning incoming
mail, but what about mail that you are sending? Does your
antivirus program automatically scan it for viruses? Viruses
and their writers are pretty sneaky; if your antivirus program
scans files as they are created (the “automatic” protection),
then you can be sure that outbound mail is virus-free.
That said, however, many antivirus programs do have a spe-
cific module that is “hooked in” to your e-mail program (again,
just the “local” e-mail kinds like Outlook Express and Eudora)
to scan each outbound message before it gets out of your
computer. If you use Web-based e-mail, your ISP may be scan-
ning your outbound mail automatically.
This is a good feature, because some e-mail programs don’t
write your outbound messages to the hard drive until after
they are sent. A plain-Jane antivirus program that is not e-mail
aware would catch the virus, but only after your mail program
had sent it out. This is precisely the reason why good
antivirus programs specifically hook into your local e-mail
program in order to detect and block outgoing viruses.
Detecting viruses in e-mail
So what are you supposed to do if your antivirus program
catches a virus in an incoming mail message? It depends.
What’s worse than e-mail spam? How about spam with a 
virus attached? Spam filters watch for spammers’ favorite
words — so spammers use a bizarre mishmash language to
get past the filters. In fact, that’s one clue to watch for. If the
message containing the virus was from 984Jiel3Z@yahoo.
com and the subject line was something like hello, Free
ca.ble d3sc4ambl3r, or RE: horseman antacid driving 
cobalt — in other words, if it’s spam — then you do nothing.
Above all, don’t open the message; just delete it and move on.
Don’t waste your time with such messages. Save your curios-
ity for other purposes.
If, on the other hand, the virus is in a message sent from
someone you know, then think before you reply. True, you at
least owe that person the courtesy of letting him or her know
Chapter 6: Scanning Your Computer and E-Mail 97

that a virus-infected e-mail message came to you from that
address. This stuff happens, and perhaps it’s happened to you
in the past. But wait a minute.
Some viruses grab all the addresses in an infected computer’s
e-mail address book and then send infected messages to
every address. It’s possible that your friend did not knowingly
send you an infected message. In fact, your friend may not
even be the person from whose computer the message was
sent. Some viruses use a stolen return address from one com-
puter as the fake return address for infected messages sent
from a different infected computer.
Suppose, for example, you have a friend named Jane (not her
real name). One day you receive an infected e-mail message
that appears to have been sent from Jane. However, things are
often not as they seem. Another person, named Bob (not his
real name), did catch a virus from someone, and the virus
sent out lots of e-mail messages. You and Jane are in Bob’s
e-mail address book, and the virus created a message to send
to you from Bob’s computer, with Jane’s return address.
So in this example, Bob’s computer sent you an infected mes-
sage that appears to have been sent from Jane, but in reality
Jane had nothing to do with it. So if you send mail to Jane to
tell her that she may have a virus, she may not know what
you’re talking about — but she should probably check
anyway.
It is for this reason that you need to be wary of messages in
your inbox that appear to have been sent from people you
know. You can’t judge a mail message by its subject line.
Viruses are doing tricky things like this in order to spread
chaos, confusion, and mistrust. Thems tricksy virus writers! We
hates them, we do!

here’s a virus in your computer, or at least you’re pretty
sure there is. You’ll find out how to tell the difference and
know what to do if it looks like there really is a virus in there

anywhere — except on a virus hunt.
Interpreting Warning Messages
You may have seen a warning message that appeared to come
from your antivirus program — and said it found a virus. First
response: Separate fact from fiction.
If your message was wholly contained within an e-mail mes-
sage, then it’s most likely a “spam” (junk) message, and one of
two things is going on:
 Someone may be trying to trick you into visiting a Web
site where you can really get infected with something.

Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
100
 Someone may be trying to get you to input your credit-
card number, whether for some legitimate or (often) ille-
gitimate reason.
Both unsavory tricks are typical. If you’re not sure, you may
want to grab a copy of Fighting Spam For Dummies (also from
Wiley) and look into it further.
Bottom line: If the message comes from a stranger and your
e-mail program shows an attachment, don’t open the message or
the attachment until you’re pretty sure of what you’re dealing
with.
Warnings about incoming e-mail
Different antivirus programs have different ways of showing
you when a virus is detected in an e-mail message. Some slip a
note into the mail message, informing you that your program
has removed a virus from a particular mail message. Others
warn you with a pop-up window (not a browser pop-up, but
one produced by your antivirus program) when they detect a
virus in a mail message.
Most of the time, the antivirus program removes the virus and
fixes things on the spot, says so, and there’s nothing further to
worry about. Your antivirus program functions as judge, jury,
and executioner all in one (when you see a message along the
lines of what’s shown in Figure 7-1, you can breathe easily).
But sometimes your antivirus program can’t remove the
virus — especially if the virus is too new — so you’ve got to
become familiar with how your antivirus program tells you
what’s up. If it can kill the inbound virus — and does so and
tells you so — then you’ve got nothing further to worry about.
If (sinister music here) your antivirus program detects but
can’t remove the virus, three burning questions crop up:
 If it detects a virus but can’t kill it, does that mean my
system is already infected (and should I panic now)?
 If my system isn’t infected, how can I dispose of the virus
without launching it (what’s my equivalent of oven mitts)?
 What do I do now? (Scream? Use bad language? Pitch my
computer and move to a cave?)

Well (for openers), if you find yourself in the situation in
which the antivirus software can’t remove the virus, go right
to the section in this chapter called “Repairing Your System.”
If not, no problem — chill out and read on.
Figure 7-1: An e-mail virus has been found and eradicated.
Warnings about incoming files
It began innocently enough: You were copying files to your
computer from a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or even a floppy disk
(let’s hear it for classic tech!) — or you were downloading from
the Internet or over a network from some other computer —
when suddenly a shot rang out. Oops, wrong story — when sud-
denly your antivirus program put up a window telling you it just
found a virus, something like the window shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2: A warning message tells you that a virus has been found.

couldn’t clean the file.
Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 101

Take a close look at the message from your antivirus program.
It’s telling you that it found a virus and can fix (remove) it, or
that it found a virus and cannot fix or remove it. What comes
next depends on what it told you.
Fixed
If your antivirus program did catch and crush the virus, then
you have almost nothing to worry about. You do know that
some particular file that you were reading, copying, or down-
loading had a virus in it. You also know that your antivirus
program did detect it and prevent it from causing any damage
to your computer, and also that it prevented it from spreading
from your computer to other computers. But does it end there?
You may feel an obligation to inform the file’s owner(s) that it
has a virus. But then again, perhaps they do know. You have a
judgment call to make; the right thing to do varies by situation.
However — you’ve now seen your antivirus program doing its
job: It detected a virus and killed it on the spot.
Not fixed
If your antivirus program tells you that it couldn’t clean the
file, then you have some more work to do. Probably, one of
two things is going on:
 Your program detected the virus, but could not remove
it from the file. Don’t head for the hills yet; you are still

Don’t put off repairs
If your computer has a virus, you
should not do anything on your com-
puter (other than your search-and-
destroy mission) until you are sure
that the virus is gone. If you are
hoping it’ll go away or are pretending
it’s gone, you’re kidding yourself. The
longer you put off eradicating the
virus, the worse off you may become.
Some viruses even try to turn your
system into a modern-day Typhoid
Mary, spreading infection to dozens,
hundreds, or even thousands of other
computer users on the Internet.
Baaaad Karma. Until the virus is
gone, you risk the possibility that files
or programs on your computer will be
damaged, and that you will spread
the virus to others. ’Nuff said.

probably quite safe. In situations like this, the antivirus
program is not going to just leave you vulnerable; instead,
it completely removes the infected file (either by deleting
it or placing it in quarantine) so the virus contained in it
can’t hurt you. (Gives me warm fuzzies, how about you?)
 Your program detected a virus but couldn’t zap it, and
the file that carries the virus is lurking on your system.
Check out the “Repairing Your System” section of this
chapter.
Warnings resulting from
a virus scan
Whoops, there it is: You scan your computer for viruses, and
the scan finds a virus that sneaked in. You’ve got a “situation”
on your hands. The first thing you should be asking yourself is,
How did the infected file slip past the real-time virus detection
and get itself into your computer?
There are a couple of possible explanations that are not par-
ticularly alarming, but you’re not out of the woods yet:
 The virus may be so new that it entered your computer
before your antivirus program had a “signature” for it.
 Real-time virus detection was (and still may be) turned
off at the time the virus entered your computer.
 Your antivirus software has no real-time virus detection.
Whatever your situation, your computer has a virus. It entered
your computer and parked itself in a file somewhere. What we
don’t know (and it’s pretty close to impossible to find out in
many cases) is whether the virus “activated” and performed
whatever evil deeds it was designed to do. The virus may still
be “sleeping,” waiting for a date (a specific day on the calen-
dar, not a night out with a virus of the opposite parity), or
waiting for some other condition.
Take note of the name of the virus — its entire name. You’ve
got some research to do. You’ll need to visit the antivirus pro-
gram’s Web site and read about this particular virus to see
what it does to victims’ computers (the really nice antivirus
programs, when they display the message telling you about
the virus, may have a “click here for more information” button
Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 103

that takes you right to information on this particular virus, as
shown in Figure 7-3). After getting the word, you’ll be wise to
look for signs of this specific activity, whatever it may be.
If you have any repair work to do, skip ahead in this chapter
to “Repairing Your System.”
Only after you get all the way through these few steps can you
be sure that the virus is really gone. But to be sure, it’s wise to
do another scan.

Because computer viruses behave like viruses in the organic
world (in the way that they infect and spread), it’s no wonder
some medical terms crossed over into the computer world.
For example, antivirus programs borrowed quarantine from
hospitals, where it’s a secure place (and a set of procedures)
intended to isolate patients with infectious diseases so they
don’t infect other patients or hospital workers. On your com-
puter, it’s a usually a subdirectory (created for this purpose
when your antivirus program was installed) that serves as
somewhere to put a file infected with a virus. Any contact
with the infected file is limited for safety’s sake. (Nope, there
are no visiting hours.)

about the virus.

Files in quarantine are there for one of two reasons:
 It’s the original file version: The files there may be the
infected versions of files that were successfully repaired.
Repaired files will be found in their original locations.
 It’s the only file version: For files that could not be
repaired, the quarantine is the only place where they can
be found.
The antivirus program, in cahoots with the operating system,
may prevent you from accessing quarantined files. If you find
yourself with quarantined files, you may be limited to just
looking at them through a heavy plate-glass window.
Different antivirus programs handle quarantine access
differently — if you’ve gotten lost in the quarantine cave, the
antivirus program’s help info will guide you and let you know
what you can and can’t do with the file.
Repairing Your System
If you encounter a pop-up message from your antivirus pro-
gram telling you that you have a virus, then you’re in the right
place. Regardless of the means your antivirus program used
to spot your virus, you should write down the exact name(s)
of the virus(es) that it found, and the file that was infected.
Then it’s time to start bailing water.
Determining the extent
of the damage
Determining how much mayhem a virus has wrought is an
important task because the things you may need to do are
determined by your fact-finding. The procedure here is actu-
ally pretty simple:
1. Identify which virus (or viruses) your computer has.
Write down their names; know thy enemy.
2. Go to your antivirus program’s Web site and find out
more about the virus.
Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 105

Most such Web sites have a feature that provides
details about particular viruses: what they do, where
they hide, and what it takes to get rid of ’em.
3. Read the description carefully.
Try to understand what — if any — damage the virus
may have done to your computer.
4. Check the antivirus program’s Web site to see
whether it suggests a specific virus-removal tool.
The Web site may further describe damage that the
virus is known to do and whether you need to take
any more action.
Well, no, you don’t have to memorize chapter and verse
on the precise nature of the damage, but look for the
types of damage that the virus is known to inflict. Does
it (for example) infect specific parts of your operating
system? Corrupt files? Destroy access to data?
The antivirus companies are generally pretty good about
explaining exactly how to determine whether any damage has
occurred. The good antivirus companies will give easy-to-
understand instructions that practically anyone will be able to
understand and follow.
Repairing damage
The range of possible virus mayhem is too vast to get really
specific here. A typical Windows system has thousands of
files, any of which could be the victim of the virus — whether
by being removed, renamed, altered, or corrupted. Or one or
more of your files may have been the target of the virus. I’ll be
rather general here and describe the likely categories of repair.
Getting and running a repair program
Sometimes the virus that your computer is infected with
can’t be completely eradicated from your computer with the
means in your antivirus program. If this is the case, then your
antivirus software company may have a repair program that
you can download and run.
Before you download and run the repair program, it’s impor-
tant that you read all the way through any instructions and
notes. Given how tricky viruses can be these days, just running
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
106

the repair program may not be enough. You may need to do
something before you run the repair program, and maybe
even something else afterward.
If you’re a bit anxious, that’s natural. You can get a good start
by downloading the needed program. I suggest you save the
program to your computer before running it (you may need
to run it a second time, or use it on another computer, for
instance).
Read through the steps completely before beginning. If you
don’t feel confident that you can handle the instructions, enlist
the help of an expert friend or take your computer in for repair.
In some cases, a mistake can cause additional damage to your
computer over and above what the virus may have done.
Reinstalling files
Some viruses remove one or more files from the Windows
operating system. Your antivirus program’s Web site may have
specific instructions on where to get this file, and perhaps they
even have a copy you can get right from their Web site.
Then again, you may need to get the information (or even the
fix) from Microsoft. If this is the case, your antivirus company
should have precise instructions that tell you exactly where
and how to get it. I’d be surprised if your antivirus company
left you out in the cold.
Be careful, and go slowly. Computers are intolerant of mis-
takes; they do just what you tell them to do, not what you
meant for them to do.
Booting from a rescue disk
If you are unable to boot your computer at all, it’s possible that
your computer has become infected with a boot sector virus
that is interfering with the computer’s boot procedure. So how
do you boot the computer in order to run a virus scan to repair
the boot sector? It’s a classic chicken-and-egg situation — how
do you do it?
You may need to boot your computer using the antivirus pro-
gram’s rescue disk, which may be a CD-ROM or a floppy disk.
With some antivirus programs, the CD-ROM you installed
the program from is the rescue disk. In other cases, you’ll
have to build the rescue disk yourself — in advance of your
Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 107

catastrophe. Hindsight isn’t much help in a situation like this,
so it’s best to create the rescue disk when you first install your
antivirus program. I describe this important step in Chapter 4.
Every antivirus program is different in terms of how their
rescue disk works. Some will start up and immediately go to
work, scanning and repairing the hard drive’s master boot
record, eliminating it of any virus-induced problems. Others
will ask you what you want to do. Think “scan and fix.”
If the rescue disk doesn’t find anything wrong, then chances
are that it’s not a virus that’s keeping your computer from
booting, but some other problem. Time to find your copy of
Windows For Dummies or Troubleshooting Your PC For
Dummies, or find your expert friend’s phone number.
Restoring files from backup
If a virus has trashed one of your files, your antivirus program
may have had no choice but to remove the file if it was unable
to repair it. If this has occurred, you have little choice but to
restore the file(s) from your backups.
Don’t have backups? Sit down; I have to tell you something: If
the virus that infected your computer deleted one or more of
your files, and you don’t have copies of those files elsewhere,
they may be irretrievably gone. But you still may have a glim-
mer of hope. The remainder of this section provides places
where copies of the file may exist, and if that doesn’t work,
check out the following section, “Using a file-recovery utility.”
This is an amazingly bad time to tell you that you “should
have” been doing backups of some kind all along. Windows
certainly doesn’t tell you, and maybe nobody else did (well,
shame on them). I’m sorry. But don’t lose hope yet. There is a
remote possibility that a copy of your missing file(s) can be
found somewhere. I’ll explain with an example.
Let’s say a virus removed your file resume.doc. There are
some places you can look to find either a copy of that file, or
an older version of it. Here are some ideas:
 If your word-processing program is configured to create
backup files, then maybe a backup of your file is still
around. Depending on your word-processing program, a
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
108

backup copy of resume.doc may be called resume.bak,
Backup of resume.doc (see Figure 7-4), or something
else. Dig into the documentation of your word-processing
program and see what its specific approach is.
 When you edit or use files, sometimes a word-processing
program (as well as other types of programs) creates tem-
porary files that may contain part (or even all) of the con-
tent you hated to lose. The names of these temporary files
vary, and depend on the program that you use. Where
these files can be found also varies. But I’d suggest you
look for files whose names begin with a tilde (~), as well
as files whose names end in .tmp. There may be other
names, too.
 Did you e-mail any of the lost files to someone else? If so,
then you have two options: The person or persons you
mailed the files to may still have them and can mail them
back, or, your e-mail program may have a “Sent Items”
folder (which would contain a copy of mail messages
you sent to other persons and, if you sent attachments
to those persons, usually the attached files would be
there too).
Figure 7-4: A listing of documents and backup files.

Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 109

Using a file-recovery utility
It may be possible to recover a file damaged by a virus with
one of several file-recovery utility programs. These programs
scan your hard drive, looking for traces of files that may have
been removed by a virus.
Some of these utilities work best if you install them before
damage occurs. But depending upon the type of damage the
virus incurred, it’s still possible that a deleted file can be
recovered after the damage is done.
I’m not an I-told-you-so kind of person, but in terms of file
recovery due to viruses, file recovery utilities are all but
unnecessary if basic safeguards are taken to protect your
computer. However, if the horse is out of barn — as it were —
then such a utility may be of help.
Some of the available file recovery utilities include:
 File Rescue Plus: Recovers deleted and corrupted
files from many types of media. Available from
www.file-rescue.com.
 Aid System Restorer: Made for Windows 95, Windows 98,
and Windows ME, this is a backup-and-restore program
that must be used prior to a virus damaging a computer’s
data. Available from www.aidsoft.com/asr.
 Undelete 4.0: This utility can be used to recover files
that have been deleted from a Windows system. It can’t
be used to recover corrupted files. Undelete is available
from www.execsoft.com/undelete.
If you’re able to recover a corrupted program using one of these
utilities, I still recommend that you consider this recovery tem-
porary, while you obtain a “genuine” copy of the program from
the software manufacturer or the release media, such as the CD.
If the file or files you lost are of great economic importance,
you may be able to find an expert disk-recovery company that
can use advanced techniques to attempt to find your lost files.
This is potentially expensive (hundreds of dollars or more),
but possibly worth it to you, if no other options work out.

Removing a Registry key
It’s possible that the instructions you receive from a virus-
removal tool or from a support technician may tell you to edit
your Registry database. The Registry is a special database in
the computer that contains a multitude (literally thousands)
of configuration settings used by Windows and many of the
programs installed on the computer.
Many viruses make changes to the computer’s Registry, and
occasionally, it’s necessary to manually remove a Registry key
in order to completely eliminate the effects of a virus infection.
This section provides you with instructions for deleting a key
or entire branch of the Registry.
Edit the Registry with extreme care, and only edit the Registry
when virus-removal instructions or a support technician tells
you to do so. If you make a mistake, you can literally break
your computer so that it will not function correctly or possi-
bly render your computer unbootable.
To remove a Registry key, follow these steps:
1. Close all of the programs running on your computer.
If you’re in the middle of a virus search-and-destroy
mission, you shouldn’t have any program running
except those you need for repairs.
2. Choose Start➪Run.
The Run dialog box appears.
3. Type regedt32 and then press Enter. (If regedt32 can’t
be found, then type regedit and then press Enter.)
The Registry Editor program starts. It looks a lot like
Windows Explorer, including the presence of the
Registry hierarchy that looks a lot like the directories-
and-files hierarchy on your hard drive.
4. Very, very carefully, navigate into the Registry to
locate the Registry key in question (as directed by
the virus-removal instructions).
For instance, if you’re looking for the key HKEY_
LOCAL_MACHINE/ SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Command
Processor/AutoRun, then you can either double-click
Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 111

each entry or press the little plus symbol (as shown to
the left of this paragraph) next to each entry, starting
with HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then SOFTWARE, and so
on, to open each successive branch of the tree until
you reach the destination.
5. Make the required deletion, as follows:
• If you must delete a branch (or folder) from the reg-
istry, select (click on) the branch to remove it, then
press the Delete key. You’ll need to confirm that
this is the correct part to delete (see Figure 7-5).
Check, double-check, and triple-check that you’re
deleting the correct branch! This is very dangerous
territory!
• If you must delete a key (or value) from the Registry,
then navigate to the branch in the registry contain-
ing the key. The keys in the branch will be listed on
the right side of the window. Click on the key that
you’re directed to remove and press the Delete key.
You’ll need to verify your deletion. Do so carefully!
Figure 7-5: Repairing the Registry with the Registry Editor program.
Part II: Deploying Your Antivirus Defenses 
112

6. Exit the Registry editor.
You can now resume with the instructions furnished
with the virus-removal instructions. It’s usually a good
idea to restart the computer after changing the reg-
istry, as many changes do not take effect until restart-
ing the computer.
Reinstalling software
Sure, it’s possible to repair the damaged software, but repair-
ing it may be so difficult that it would just be easier to rein-
stall it. This is similar to an automobile accident, where you
discover that the cost to repair the damage to a vehicle
exceeds its value.
The information you get from your antivirus maker is usually
what clinches a decision to reinstall software. For instance,
they may tell you that a particular virus is known to severely
damage Outlook Express and that you’re better off removing
and reinstalling the program. Why could this be? Behold:
 The repair procedure, even when performed by a pro-
gram, can be complicated.
 The virus may damage different computers in different
ways, making it difficult to write a repair program that
works properly.
 The virus may remove important files that the program
uses, making it necessary to reload those files from the
original release media.
 There are more good reasons out there, but I’m close to
deadline — I’ve got to get this chapter turned in to the
publisher.
In such a situation, it’s wise to keep good records on all the
software programs you use on your computer — and here are
some stellar examples:
 Hang on to that original documentation. This is espe-
cially important when you’re required to type in a license
key number to activate your program after you install it.
 Keep track of the installation options chosen when you
originally installed the program. You may want to use
the same ones.
Chapter 7: Ridding Your Computer of Viruses 113

 Know where your original distribution medium is.
Where did you put that CD-ROM, floppy disk, or stone
tablet (just kidding)? In the event you purchased a prod-
uct online, know where to retrieve it if you need to reload
it. (Come to think of it, did the online instructions have
you create a boot disk when you downloaded the pro-
gram? Better go find it.)
While it may be elegant to keep all of your license keys on
your computer, if the information on your computer is dam-
aged, then your license keys are gone, too. You should either
write down the license keys in the product manual, on the
media case, directly on the CD, or in a binder containing infor-
mation about your PC. If you cannot find the license key, you
will need to call the software company’s customer support
department and plead your case with them. You’ll find more
great ideas in Chapter 12.
Reinstalling Windows
Sometimes a virus is so destructive that there is little, if any,
hope of being able to repair the damage done to your
Windows operating system. This is about the most extreme
measure that someone would have to take in order to get his
or her computer back into proper running condition.
Depending on the damage that was done, and on the version
of Windows that you are using, there is a possibility that you
will lose all of your data files.
Reinstalling Windows is a step that cannot be taken lightly.
(Hint: Are you doing anything — else — this weekend?) I
would compare it to a situation where termites may have
done so much damage to your home that the only remedy
would be to tear it down — with the added possibility that
you may lose part or all of the contents of your home.

In this part . . .
I
t’s very important to keep the signature ﬁle up to date
in order to defend yourself against the latest viruses. If
your memory is like mine, you should set your antivirus
program to automatically get signature ﬁle updates.
A security patch is a package that is used to repair a ﬂaw
in software. Some ﬂaws create security vulnerabilities that
make it possible for someone (or some thing) to make bad
things happen to your computer. It’s not difﬁcult to install
security patches, but there are certain precautions that
are necessary in order to keep your data safe.
Besides antivirus programs, two other types of security
software can help protect your computer: ﬁrewalls and
antispyware programs. Firewalls block scans and intrusion
attempts from hackers and Internet worms. Antispyware
programs block and/or remove software components that
track your movements on the Internet — and worse.
If you use a PDA, you should consider using antivirus soft-
ware on your PDA too. While the number of viruses that
have been created to attack PDAs is low, certainly more
PDA attacks will develop over time.
There are many good practices that you will want to con-
sider in order to keep your computer and information
safe. From backups to safe browser settings to blocking
spyware, these factors will help to ensure that you and
your computer will be safe.

Software and Signatures

S
ignature updates are the lifeblood of your antivirus pro-
gram. Without them, your antivirus program can become
(in effect) obsolete in less than a month. Any of the newest
viruses can penetrate your computer if your virus signatures
are (you guessed it) not up to date.
In this chapter, I describe the process of obtaining an updated
signature file for your antivirus software, and I give you some
hints about how often you may want to do so.
Getting a Signature Update
In order to detect and remove viruses, your antivirus program
needs to know how to recognize them. Antivirus programs
keep a signature file close by — a collection of virus descrip-
tions that works like a dictionary and lists every known virus.
When your antivirus program is doing its job — whether keep-
ing a close eye on the programs and files your computer is
using, or scanning the entire hard drive — it constantly com-
pares the files it’s looking at with all known virus signatures. If
it finds a match, then the antivirus program has detected a
virus.

Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
118
Onslaught of the new viruses
Sounds like a horror movie, doesn’t it? Bingo. New viruses are
coming out all the time — over 20 each day, on average. And
the new viruses are usually the ones that are spreading from
computer to computer. Old viruses are seldom seen unless
somebody comes up with a nasty new modification — in which
case, your antivirus program will need an updated signature
for the new virus (called a “variant”) so it knows exactly what
to look for.
What this means is that your antivirus program needs to peri-
odically get a new copy of the signature file. The new copy of
the signature file will contain all the virus signatures that were
there before, along with the new signatures for all those new
viruses.
Updates (had better) happen
A signature update is the task your antivirus program does to
get a new, up-to-date signature file. The antivirus program
attempts to establish a connection over the Internet to the
antivirus company that made it. If it can make a connection, the
antivirus program asks whether there’s a newer version of the
signature file. It’s the equivalent of asking, “I have a signature
file that is Version 4.16 — do you have anything newer than
that?” If the company’s Web site has a newer version, then 
the antivirus program copies it onto your computer.
Engine updates, too
Many antivirus programs can also update their engines. Sorry,
no chrome exhaust pipes or higher gas mileage here — the
engine is the part of the program that actually performs a spe-
cific, required task (in this case, the detection engine detecting
viruses). The engine contains the instructions that tell the
antivirus program which files to examine and what to look for.
Occasionally, when some new type of virus is released, the
antivirus company realizes it must make some adjustments
on how the program looks for and detects viruses. So, as with
signature files, the detection engines will also have version
numbers, and your antivirus program can also download a
new engine if a newer one is available. It’s a constant game

of catch-up with the virus writers who think of new ways to
transmit and hide viruses.
People who work with antivirus software toss around different
terms to describe this update process. Some call it a virus
update, signature update, virus signature update, engine
update, or just an update. And your particular brand of
antivirus software may have a fancy name for it. Symantec
calls theirs LiveUpdate, McAfee calls it SecurityCenter Update,
and Panda uses the term Intelligent Update.
What version do I have?
It’s usually fairly easy to see what version of signatures,
engine, and possibly other antivirus components you have on
your computer. Each brand of antivirus program is a little dif-
ferent, but usually Help➪About (or a similar command) will
show you the version numbers and other pertinent informa-
tion (as shown in Figure 8-1).
Figure 8-1: Antivirus software can display the versions of its signature file
and other components.
It will occasionally be important to know what version of sig-
natures you have on your computer. You may learn of a new
virus outbreak and be concerned about whether you’re pro-
tected. Here’s a typical scenario that plays out every day
somewhere in the world. . . .
How it goes (example scenario)
Suppose you learn about a new virus outbreak — a beastie
called (say) W32.Dummy.A is ravaging the Web, and you have
Chapter 8: Updating Antivirus Software and Signatures 119

a particular concern about it (for example, friends or col-
leagues have found it lurking on their computers). Typically,
your course of action looks like this:
1. You visit your antivirus program’s Web site to read
about the new virus and what to do about it.
You immediately find exactly what you’re looking for
(what the heck, may as well be optimistic): The virus
is indeed new and its awful habits are described on
the Web site. You find a link with its name, and one
click later, you’re mulling over some specific informa-
tion about the virus — the “R-rated” gory details
describing how it gets around and what it does to
victim computers.
2. You locate the latest signature file.
All antivirus companies tell you the “minimum” version
of signature file you must have in order to detect and
stop the virus from infecting your computer. So you
click the name of this particular virus and find where
it says what signature file is required (say, Version
5.26.079).
3. You check to see which version of the signature file
you now have.
Usually that means consulting your antivirus program’s
help files (Help➪About) in your antivirus program while
it’s running. Say you find that you have 5.26.077 — a
couple of numbers behind the minimum (5.26.079).
Better download that later version of the signature file.
4. You tell your antivirus program to update the signa-
ture file.
With your antivirus program running, you select the
Update Now (or equivalent) function. Your program
immediately downloads the latest signature file from
the antivirus company’s Web site, and tells you when
the new signature file is downloaded and successfully
installed.
5. You check to make sure the new signature file fills
the bill.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
120

Another quick Help➪About command shows that you
now have version 5.26.080 — one release newer than
5.26.079. You’re protected, all right.
6. Wary that you may already have the virus as a nasty
guest, you scan your entire computer for viruses.
Now that you have that newest signature file on your
computer, you can be sure that if W32.Dummy.A is
skulking around on your computer, your antivirus pro-
gram will find it — and, if possible, remove it and
repair the infected file. If the virus isn’t found, then
you’re clean and protected from the current version.
(Gotta love those win-win situations.)
The process rarely gets more complicated than this.
Chapter 8: Updating Antivirus Software and Signatures 121
Virus signatures as mug shots 
and fingerprints
Technically speaking, of course, a
virus contains programming instruc-
tions that the virus needs in order
to work. The instructions have to
be transferred with the virus or it
can’t function. But those instructions
also form a distinctive pattern that
identifies the virus as effectively as
a fingerprint identifies a human.
Comparing viruses to criminals is
especially apt, so here’s a crime
story. . . .
Imagine your computer as a large
office building with a security guard
(your antivirus program) watching its
entrance: People come in off the
streets of Internet City, some legit,
some not so legit. The security guard
looks at the face of each person
coming in and compares it to the
photographs of known criminals on
file. If someone’s face matches that
of a known criminal, that person is
not permitted to enter the building.
Sometimes criminals walk in wearing
bad disguises, but the guard is pre-
pared: The file includes mug shots
and fingerprints. Whoever walks up
and asks to be let in gets a fingerprint
check as standard operating proce-
dure. Bad guys get thrown in the
cooler.
To stay effective, the guard updates
his known-criminals file every day.
New criminals are betting that their
pictures aren’t in the file yet. But the
fingerprints — the virus signatures —
will finger ’em every time.

Deciding How Often 
to Get Updates
Some questions crop up often — “Does my computer have a
virus?” “How do I scan for a virus?” “Does Dick Clark wear a
toupee?” — but the most-often-asked question about antivirus
programs is, “How often should I get updates?”
If I was more of a blarney artist, I would attempt to impress
you (or bore you) with statistics that would tell you precisely
how often to update your virus-signature files. Instead, I’ll pro-
vide a shortcut, a simple answer that lays out some practical
approaches and why it’s reasonable to use them:
 Always-on, broadband Internet connection: If your com-
puter is connected to the Internet all the time, update
your signature files at least once or twice each day. If you
work with sensitive data that you can’t afford to lose,
updating up to six times a day would be better. On a slow
news day, this might be construed as overkill, and any
more than six times a day would be overkill. But some-
times a really nasty virus is on the loose and multiple
variants are popping up every day. If you have to con-
tinue your work on a day like this, hunker down and
update your signatures every hour or two until the crisis
passes.
 Dial-up Internet connection: You can update less fre-
quently because your computer isn’t such an attractive
target to viruses. Generally you’re at lower risk of infec-
tion because an always-on connection (which generally
requires lots of bandwidth) isn’t practical for dial-up use.
With normal dial-up, you’re offline (and unavailable to
viruses) much of the time, so updating once (or some-
times twice) a week is fine . If you update virus signatures
more often over a dial-up connection (say, once or twice
daily), it could add to your monthly connect charges.
 On-the-edge computer habits: If you’re a wee bit para-
noid, or if your computing habits are high-risk, then you
could try to update as often as once each hour. Antivirus
makers don’t charge extra for obsessive updating, but
consider this: Is their latest update likely to change that
fast? Would it be simpler to change your habits?
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
122

Getting Updates
Signature updates are your antivirus program’s ammunition.
Without regular signature updates, your antivirus program
quickly becomes dependent on unreliable ammo — which is
to say, practically useless. Fortunately, getting the good new
stuff is pretty straightforward, whether you do it manually or
automatically.
Manual updates
Antivirus programs permit you to do signature file updates
“on demand” — in other words, anytime you want. If, unlike
me, you have a terrific memory, then you can just remember
to do signature file updates as often as needed.
Every antivirus program is designed a little differently: Each has
a manual signature-updating capability, but each has a different
way of “navigating” to it. In some programs, you can click the
antivirus icon in the system tray and see a Download Signature
Now command right next to the system tray. (Figure 8-2 shows
what a typical Trend Micro manual download looks like.) Other
programs require you to open the antivirus program first, click
the appropriate tab, and then download virus signatures.
Figure 8-2: A manual download of virus signatures in progress.
Chapter 8: Updating Antivirus Software and Signatures 123

Automatic updates
Most antivirus programs also let you schedule automatic
updates that your computer can do as often as you like.
Personally, I like this option: I may forget to update virus sig-
natures, but my computer will never forget to.
Telling your antivirus program how often to update your signa-
ture files is easier than programming your VCR (see Figure 8-3
for a typical example). Finding the screen to set this up is
another matter, but generally antivirus programs are not all
that complicated, so hopefully you can find it quickly. You can
read the manual, look at help, or visit the Web site to see how
it’s done.
Figure 8-3: Scheduling automatic updates — hey, no blinking 12:00! Cool!
One note about automatic updates: Your computer must be
running, and it must be either connected to the Internet or
able to automatically connect to the Internet when the update
takes place. If you have any doubt at all whether an automatic
update will work, schedule one to take place five minutes from
now and watch what happens.
Even when you think your virus-signature updates will be suc-
cessful most of the time, I still think it’s a good idea to look at
the version numbers of your virus-signature files to make sure
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
124

those updates are really happening. If your automatic updates
are constantly failing, you’ll quickly be in a position of vulner-
ability to new viruses. Going more than a week without virus-
signature updates is a bad state to be in.
If your updates aren’t happening, check your automatic-
update configuration to see if it’s really enabled (did you set
the schedule but fail to activate it?). You can also try a manual
update — if that works, then you have a scheduling problem.
If it doesn’t work, then the update process itself is failing. Visit
your antivirus program’s Web site and look for the Help,
Support, or FAQ section so that you can figure out why
updates aren’t working.
Scanning after an Update
If suddenly the realization hits that it’s been more than a week
since you updated your virus-signature file, you better scan
your computer for viruses immediately — particularly if you’re
the active type (lots of e-mail, file sharing, file swapping, open-
ing mail from strangers, and other such cyber-exuberance).
The more time that has gone by since your last signature
update, the more important it is that you do a whole-system
scan. For instance, if two weeks has elapsed since your last
update, then any virus less than two weeks old could have
entered your computer unhindered. Here’s why that’s a cause
for concern:
 The viruses you’re likeliest to catch are new; your
antivirus software doesn’t yet know how to detect them.
 New viruses are joining the online feeding frenzy every
day. If you haven’t update your defenses for two weeks,
who knows how many viruses looked at your computer,
went yum, yum, and moved right in?
Go to Chapter 6 for more information on how to perform
manual scans, and how to set up your antivirus program to
perform regularly scheduled scans automatically while you
sleep. And don’t be surprised if you sleep better.

esides running antivirus software and firewall software,
installing security patches is one of the most important
ways you can make your computer more secure. Although not
yet as simple as running antivirus software, installing security
patches isn’t difficult when you get the hang of it.
In this chapter, you get a handle on what security patches are,
why they’re needed, and the different ways to install them.
Figuring Out Why You Need
Security Patches
The big software programs that run on PCs today consist of
thousands — and sometimes even millions — of lines of source
code (the step-by-step instructions that give the program its
functionality and personality). That’s a lot to keep track of —
and (as with anything made by people) flaws can creep in.
Software can be as complex as any mechanical orchestration
of gears, shafts, pulleys, bearings, levers, switches, and so on.
But unlike physical machinery, software is almost entirely
abstract — it’s a set of electronic instructions. You can’t just

Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
128
hold it in your hand or put a wrench on it to tighten it up; that
makes it harder to examine for strength, robustness, resiliency,
and integrity.
It’s difficult to watch software’s inner workings in action:
There is rarely something you can actually watch. Even a
word-processing program consists of mostly mathematical
calculations, data buffers, table lookups, device management,
and other steps that mostly push electrons around, far
removed from what we see on the screen.
Challenges like this make it difficult to know whether a com-
plex software program is error-free and whether it does
exactly what it’s supposed to do — and nothing else.
The problem of ensuring that a single software program is
error-free is compounded by the way that computers and net-
works interact today. Within a single computer, there may be
dozens of different programs all running at once, talking with
each other on a variety of topics.
Such internal conversations take place thousands of times
each second. When you visit a Web site, you bring in thou-
sands of HTML, JavaScript, ActiveX, Shockwave, and Acrobat
computer instructions in nearly infinite combinations, sub-
jecting the software in your computer to situations that no
one ever anticipated — not the specification people, the
designers, the software engineers, or the testers.
But there are some people who work day and night looking for
such obscure situations. Their very existence is driven by the
need to find flaws, especially those that can be exploited. (You
can read more about this in Chapter 13.)
Addressing vulnerabilities
Errors can make software programs function in ways other
than those the makers intended. Even so, many errors in
common programs (such as word processors) aren’t even
observable. They happen somewhere inside the program,
where they’re sometimes hard to detect. Those that are
observable are commonly called “bugs.”
There is one type of bug in a software program that is called
a vulnerability. The word vulnerability implies some type of a

weakness. When a person is vulnerable, he or she can be hurt
more easily. Likewise, a vulnerability — also known as a secu-
rity flaw or security hole — means a program is (in effect)
gullible; certain conditions or instructions can make it per-
form some function that it should not be allowed to do. This
would be kind like the not-so-diligent security guard who
stops watching the building’s entrance when a certain pretty
woman walks in and starts sweet-talking him, permitting the
crooks with the loot to stroll right by unnoticed.
Serious vulnerabilities permit a program to perform functions
that corrupt or damage software or information on the com-
puter. Now and then, some vulnerabilities are so critical that
they are easily exploited by persons with advanced knowl-
edge and ill intent. The result? Reprehensible: the release of
damaging viruses, Trojan horses, and Internet worms, causing
banks to close, airlines to cancel flights, and e-voting
machines to elect robots to public office (okay, so maybe not
all vulnerabilities are bad).
The term “bug” first got its name in the 1940s when comput-
ers contained thousands of electromechanical relays. A mal-
function in a computer was once traced to a moth that had
flown into a relay and caused it to stop working. Ever since,
computer malfunctions have been called bugs, after that first
moth. What would we have called malfunctions if the first one
was traced to a kernel of popcorn or a paper clip?
Closing the holes
A natural response to the threat of viruses is to fix the vulner-
abilities. When a software company such as Microsoft discov-
ers a vulnerability in one of its software programs, the
response is to devise some sort of change to the program. The
change must permit the program to continue functioning cor-
rectly, but eliminate the vulnerability. Not always easy.
When a vulnerability is discovered, the software company
assigns the task of designing a patch to one or more junior pro-
grammers (think I’m kidding?) — a patch is nothing more than
a correctly rewritten part of the existing computer program.
The assignment is to change a bit of the flawed program in a
way that — with any luck — permits it to retain all its
intended functionality, eliminating only the security hole.
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 129

A complicated computer program (say, a Web browser or
word processor) may have thousands of separate compo-
nents, packaged into dozens — even hundreds — of separate
files. Any patch that a software company creates is just a cor-
rected version of one or more of these files. It’s a little bit like
changing one light bulb on a holiday display that contains
hundreds or thousands of lights — without accidentally caus-
ing any of the other lights to stop working.
Simplifying updates
To simplify the patching procedure, the software companies
rarely just make a newer version of a program file, but instead
they package the corrected program file within another pro-
gram that installs the patch for you. So rather than having to
wade through instructions that tell you (among other things)
to replace the file winnt/system32/dcom3.dll dated
February 3, 2004, with the file by the same name dated April 4,
2004, all you need to do is double-click the installer program.
(Whew! That was a close one.)
The installer program can also do a lot of checking and testing.
Most patches only work with one particular version of a pro-
gram, so the installer program must perform some other
checks:
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
130
Why are they called patches?
The computer software industry has
borrowed (or, should I say, lifted) a
number of terms from the English lan-
guage to describe things in the world
of computers and software — virus,
Trojan horse, worm, and patch. Sure,
patch may sound a little shabby, sug-
gesting a tire or inflatable beach toy
with a piece of material stuck over a
small hole to prevent air from escap-
ing. But that’s how it works. A patch
is a quick fix that covers a “hole” in
the code by providing some lines of
improved code; it doesn’t revise the
whole program. It just keeps the data
from leaking out too fast.
Specific patches exist for specific
problems. A security patch is used to
close a security hole — some vul-
nerability that permits an undesirable
function or behavior.

 It checks the version of the program being patched.
 It checks to see whether the patch has already been
installed.
 It determines whether there’s enough disk space on the
computer for the patch to be installed without causing
errors.
 It creates some log-file entries to document when this
patch was installed on the computer.
 It creates entries in a special “uninstall” directory for
later use if you decide to remove the patch.
Scrutinizing Security Patches
Before you go grab and install a security patch, you may want
to get to know a few basic facts about it — where to get it,
what it does, whether it’ll cost you, that sort of thing. Most
software makers have this process figured out, more or less,
even if they don’t collectively take what I’d call a consistent
approach to the matter.
Some software programs periodically “call home” to see
whether patches are available for them. They’ll even download
and install their own updates if you let them. Other software
makers are kind enough to send you e-mail if they release a new
security patch. Some offer mailing lists that inform members
automatically about new developments (including security
patches) via e-mail. Other software makers make you find —
and periodically visit — the company Web site to check for any
new patches.
And then you have the clueless software makers who don’t
seem to know what patches are. Fortunately, they’re the
minority. If you’re using software made by the rest (those who
understand the need for patches and act accordingly), here’s
a general rundown on security patches from some of the
major software companies.
A few companies don’t publicize their patches at all, but wait
until you call with a specific problem addressed by their (ahem)
secret patch. Fortunately, few companies do that anymore. It’s
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 131

better for business to just fess up to one’s mistakes and show
customers where to find the fixes.
The Microsoft Security page
When it comes to notifying users about critical security
patches, Microsoft is very well organized (they get lots of
practice), and you have a number of options available to you.
They have a nice Web page dedicated to the latest security
information about their products — and a mailing list you can
join that lets you know the minute any new security patches
are available. You have two ways to get the goods:
 To see the Microsoft Security Web site, go to www.
microsoft.com/security. There you’ll find a great
number of features and information.
 To get on Microsoft’s mailing list for critical patches, go
to their Security Web page and click the Get e-mail about
new security updates link. You’ll be taken to a sign-up
screen where you put in your e-mail address. From that
point forward, you’re notified via e-mail whenever any
critical situation is going on.
My personal preference is to keep all bases covered. I sub-
scribe to the mailing list, but I still periodically visit the
Microsoft Security Web page to see what’s new.
Except on rare occasions, Microsoft releases security patches
once a month — on the second Tuesday — as part of their
grand plan. Consumers normally don’t pay much attention,
but for large companies — with tens of thousands of comput-
ers running Windows — it matters a great deal. Knowing that
patches come out on a predictable schedule permits large
companies to organize security upgrades. From my own expe-
rience in large companies, such predictability is greatly
preferable to the near-chaos that occurred back in the Dark
Ages when Microsoft used to “shotgun” their security patches
with little or no advance notice.
Non-Microsoft programs
Companies other than Microsoft use a variety of methods to
inform their customers about available security patches (such
as mailing lists and Web sites). Some companies have figured
out that viruses are bad for all Internet business, and go beyond
simply offering patches for their own products. Most of the
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
132

antivirus companies offer downloadable fixes for specific
viruses — to everybody, even the folks who aren’t using their
software. (Are they altruistic? Are they nuts? Nope, just smart.)
Other sources of security information
A couple of other high-quality sources of security information
are well worth a look — and I recommend you consider view-
ing them on a regular basis (or, easier yet, getting on their
mailing lists). Some of the better ones include these:
 US-CERT. The United States Computer Emergency
Readiness Team manages the National Cyber Alert
System. You can subscribe to security alerts written
for non-computer experts (which includes most people
on the planet). Go to www.us-cert.gov to view cyber-
security tips and sign up for the bulletins.
 AusCERT. This is the Australian Computer Emergency
Response Team. Yes, they get viruses down under too.
You can view alerts and subscribe to their mailing list.
Go to www.auscert.org for more information.
Preparing to Install
Security Patches
Software is pretty complicated — it’s a multitude of modules
contained in dozens or hundreds of separate computer files. A
patch installation involves replacing one or more of these files,
and perhaps tinkering with other parts of the software, which
makes the process (you guessed it) complex. Therefore, in the
name of sanity, I suggest you do the following before you install
any security patches:
1. Back up your important files.
If you’re not sure what this means or how to do a
backup, go to Chapter 12.
2. Restart your computer.
Rebooting is a good idea before installing any patches.
A freshly booted operating system is more stable.
Things will just go better.
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 133

3. Find and carefully read the installation instructions
associated with the patch.
Usually there is additional information that discusses
any known side effects or situations you may need to
know about. It’s best if you’re aware of these before
you install the patch, especially because a few patches
cannot be removed after they have been installed.
It’s a good idea to install one patch at a time, reboot after each
patch installation, and run your computer for a while to make
sure it’s running okay before you install the next patch. Call me
cautious, but I’ve not had a significant problem in many years
with installations I’ve done after following these principles.
If your computer is running low on system resources —
whether that’s processor speed, amount of memory, or avail-
able disk space — you may experience a dramatic slowdown
after installing a patch or upgrade. If this happens to you, that
last patch may have been the straw that broke the camel’s
back. What can you do?
Well, you can try and back out the patch, but that may or may
not help. The action of installing the patch may have con-
tributed to the “entropy” of your computer by moving system
files around on the disk (for example) in a way that won’t be
undone if you remove the patch. Everyone’s needs are differ-
ent: You may need a faster processor, more memory, a larger
or faster disk, or any combination of these.
Installing Security Patches
This is where the rubber meets the road. You know you need
to check for and install security patches. You are prepared to
install them (right?), and you’re ready to start. This section
shows you how.
Downloading from
Windows Update
Microsoft has generously provided a Web page where you can
allow their computer to examine your computer to determine
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
134

what available patches are missing from your computer. It’s
really quite a nice setup.
To use Windows Update, you need an Internet connection and
Windows Internet Explorer Version 5 or newer. Sorry, you
Netscape, Mozilla, and Opera users — you must use IE to use
Windows Update. Microsoft is just funny that way.
Follow this procedure to obtain patches using Windows Update:
1. Follow the steps I describe in the section titled
“Preparing to Install Security Patches,” earlier in
this chapter.
2. Point your browser to the following site:
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com
3. Click the Scan for updates link, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1: The Windows Update start page.
Microsoft analyzes your computer, looks at the versions
of your operating system and tools, and compares its
findings against a list of all available patches for your

computer. No personal information will be sent from
your computer to Microsoft, and the plastic bag will
not inflate.
4. If there are patches to install, click the Review and
install updates link and then the Critical Updates
and Service Packs link.
You see all of the critical patches and updates that are
needed for your computer.
5. Review the selected patches.
You can read more about each one by clicking the
Read more link. Remove any that you don’t want (you
should install all of them); then click the Install Now
button, as shown in Figure 9-2.
A dialog box appears, listing patches that are being
installed.
6. Sometimes you see an End User License Agreement.
After reading it (frankly, I rarely do), click Accept.
The patch-installation process begins.
Another thing you can do with Windows Update is see what
patches are already installed on your computer. To view
installed patches, go to the Windows Update Web page and
click the View installation history link in the left column. It
shows you which patches are already installed on your com-
puter, as shown in Figure 9-3.
There is a third way (good things come in threes, right?) to
view installed patches on your computer. They show up on a
list of installed programs, viewable from your computer’s con-
trol panel. Here’s how you get there:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel.
2. In the control panel, select Add/Remove Programs.
Figure 9-4 shows what you get on-screen.
The list of installed programs appears.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the installed programs
list.
Installed patches appear with the name Windows 2000
Hotfix or Windows XP Hotfix.

Microsoft’s home page (as shown in Figure 9-5), which takes
you to the article that describes the patch.
You can also go to support.microsoft.com and click on the

the page. Either way, you’re able to quickly get to detailed
(sometimes too detailed!) information about any patch.

They don’t just aim at Windows
Patches for Microsoft Office are
just as vital as those for Microsoft
Windows itself. This is because
Microsoft Office includes Outlook, the
popular e-mail program. Unpatched
weaknesses in Outlook — in any
of its various versions (such as the
downloadable Outlook Express) —
can let in an e-mail message con-
taining malicious code. Result: Havoc
on your computer. One lapse in secu-
rity can ruin your whole day.

Figure 9-5: From the Microsoft home page, you can search for Knowledge
Base articles.
Later in this chapter I show you how to get your computer to
automatically download security updates.
Getting Office patches from
Microsoft Office Update
If you’re running Microsoft Office, then you need to periodically
check on whether any security patches are needed. Microsoft
Office programs have their fair share of security issues, so it is
important to stay current on Office patches too! Keep all of your
defenses covered!
Follow the instructions here to run Microsoft Office Update:
1. Close all applications running on your computer
(except for a Web browser).
A fresh reboot would be a good idea, too.
Article number to search for
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 139

2. Go to the Windows Update Web page at 
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com
3. Click the Office Update link near the top of the page.
The Office Update screen (shown in Figure 9-6) appears.
4. Click the Check for Updates link near the top of the
page to start Microsoft’s analysis of your computer.
The analyzer looks at the versions of the Microsoft
Office program, comparing yours against a list of all
available patches for Microsoft Office. After the analy-
sis is complete, you see a list of available patches and
updates.
5. After reviewing the list, uncheck any you don’t want
to install and click the Start Installation button.
Office Update begins downloading and installing the
updates you selected.
You’ll see an End-User License Agreement that you’ll
need to review (that’s before you check with the legal
department for a translation).

Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 141
Often, you will need your Microsoft Office CD handy when
running Microsoft Office Update. In order to properly update
Microsoft Office, the Update program needs to read informa-
tion from your original CD.
Using Windows Automatic
Update
In Windows 2000 and Windows XP, Microsoft has developed a
nice feature in which a tiny program on your computer can
automatically check for critical updates (and even automati-
cally download them). A little pop-up window tells you that
one or more critical security patches are available.
To see whether Automatic Updates is activated on your com-
puter, open your computer’s control panel (Choose Start➪
Settings➪Control Panel), and select Automatic Updates. If you
don’t see Automatic Updates on your control panel and you’re
running Windows XP, click Classic View and then you should
see it.
If you still don’t see Automatic Updates in your control panel,
it’s possible that it was not installed. Depending upon your
skill and comfort level, you can either install it yourself, check
with the store where you bought your computer, or give your
expert friend or computer mentor a call.
In the Automatic Updates configuration window shown in
Figure 9-7, you can see whether Automatic Updates is acti-
vated by seeing whether the Keep My Computer Up to Date
check box is checked. If the check box is not checked and you
would like to run Automatic Updates, check this box.
Then you need to select which of the three operating modes
you want. You can select from one of the following:
 Notify me before downloading any updates and notify
me again before installing them on my computer. This
option is fine if you don’t mind waiting for critical
patches to download before they are installed.
 Download updates automatically and notify me when
they are ready to be installed. This is my personal pref-
erence and a nice convenience feature: Your computer

downloads the patches in advance, and all you have to
do is install them.
 Automatically download the updates and install them
on the schedule that I specify. I personally dislike this
feature; I want more control over the installation of criti-
cal patches. But if this option suits your situation, then
you choose the time of day and day of the week when
you want critical patches automatically installed.
Figure 9-7: Configuring Automatic Updates.
When you’re using your computer and Automatic Updates
discovers that a critical patch is available for you to install,
it will display a message near your system tray (as shown in
Figure 9-8) saying that critical patches are available for instal-
lation on your computer (you won’t see this message if you
have configured Automatic Updates to automatically install
patches for you). 
There’s also a do-it-yourself way to install critical patches using
Automatic Update — coming right up. (In these examples, the
option chosen was Download Updates Automatically.)
Figure 9-8: Automatic updates announce their availability.
Automatic update system tray icon
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
142

When you see the message that tells you updates are available,
you can install the available updates by following these steps:
1. Click anywhere on the balloon (except on the “X” if
you’re running Windows XP) to pull up the Automatic
Updates dialog box.
You see a list of critical patches that need to be
installed on your computer. Usually, all of them are
already selected by default, and it’s fine to leave them
that way.
2. If you’re going to install patches, shut down all other
programs.
It’s likely that you’ll need to reboot your computer
right after the patches have been installed. If you have
any critical files on your computer, it would be a good
idea to back them up before you proceed.
Usually it’s fine to install all the patches at once. But if
you are one of those “install one at a time” people like
me, you can uncheck those that you wish to install
later.
If you’re not ready to install these security patches now,
you can defer the installation by clicking Remind Me
Later — you can defer for up to three days. (I wouldn’t
advise doing this too many times; viruses keep emerg-
ing all the time. You should get those critical updates
into your computer as soon as possible!)
3. Click the Install button and your patch installation
commences.
After the critical patches have been installed, you may receive
a message telling you that you need to reboot your computer.
Because you already stopped all your other programs and
backed up your files, you can (and should) reboot your com-
puter as soon as you’re asked to. If you must delay rebooting,
please don’t delay for too long (and don’t install anything else
in the meantime).
After you’ve got ’em, reboot to turn them on. Most critical
patches aren’t activated until you reboot your computer. Before
then, they’re installed but they’re not yet running. A reboot is
required so the computer knows they’re in there; only then
can they protect your computer from whatever bad stuff
they’re designed to prevent.

Downloading patches from the
Microsoft Security Web site
The Security Web site at Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/
security) has a great deal of information available for
Microsoft customers, including specific information on the
latest security patches that should be installed.
To install the latest security patches, click the Install the
Windows Security Update link, which will take you to a page
that lists the most recent security patches, along with a brief
Should I run Automatic Updates?
You can configure Windows Auto-
matic Updates to operate in one of
three modes:
 Notify Only:
In this mode,
Automatic Updates periodically
queries Microsoft to see whether
any critical patches are available.
If they are, you click “Install” to
make Automatic Updates down-
load and install them on your
computer. I like this option — of
course, it helps if you don’t mind
waiting for your computer to
download the patches.
 Download and Notify: This is
similar to Notify Only, except that
Automatic Updates will down-
load (but not install) all available
critical patches. If any critical
patches are available, you click
Install and Automatic Updates
installs the critical patches right
away — you don’t have to wait
for a download to occur. One
thing very nice about this feature
is that the download occurs
while you’re busy with other
things, and you can install the
patches even if you’re offline
because they are already on your
computer. (This is my favorite
option.)
 Full Automatic: In this option,
Automatic Updates not only
downloads critical patches from
Microsoft, but also automatically
installs all of them, at a time of
day that you specify. This is a
nice feature if you don’t mind
letting someone else decide
which critical patches should
be installed on your computer,
without your permission. (Okay,
allow me one grouse: If this was
the only way that Automatic
Updates worked, I wouldn’t use it
at all. I like to have some control
over when critical patches are
installed, and which ones.)

description and severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical,
The-Sky-Is-Falling). When you click on the link for each security
patch, Microsoft takes you to the page for that particular patch,
where download instructions and additional information are
available.
Going to the Microsoft Security Web page is a good idea if you
want to find a wide variety of security information. Advanced
users can use this site to get detailed technical information
about security patches (if you want an appreciation for the
complexity of today’s computer software, try reading one of
them; just make sure you don’t get your eyes stuck in the
cross-eyed position). But the easiest way to get the patches
and updates that your computer needs is through Windows
Update (which I discuss a few pages back).
Downloading patches yourself
If you have a good level of experience with Windows, you can
download your patches directly, without having to use
Windows Update or Automatic Updates.
There is a wide variety of patches available for Microsoft
products, and they tend to be scattered hither and yon
throughout the Microsoft Web site, generally by topic. For
instance, patches for Microsoft Office can be found on the
Microsoft Office Web page, those for Windows on the
Windows page, and so forth. You can also go to the general
Downloads page and find patches there by searching for them
by product name and version.
When you find a patch listed on a Web page, you can click on
it to see more detail. See Figure 9-9.
To download and install a patch from the Microsoft Security
Web site, follow this procedure:
1. Select a patch to install from those listed as available
for your computer.
Often you have to select the right patch; if you do not,
flames will leap out of your computer’s connectors and
you’ll be really sorry. Well, no, that’s not quite true —
but if you select a patch for some version of the soft-
ware other than what you’ve installed, the patch will
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 145

probably whine about a mismatch between the patch
and the program it’s intended to patch and refuse to
continue.
2. Click on the link to download the patch.
The link may be the name of the file to download, or it
may be the word download.
It’s a good idea to choose Save, as this will save a copy
of the patch locally on your computer. They’re not all
that big, and it’s handy to have it locally in case you
need to reinstall the patch, pass it to a friend who also
needs it, or if you have a problem part-way through
the installation.
3. Close all your other programs so that the only thing
running is the patch installation itself.
You can even close your Web browser; you won’t need
it anymore for this procedure.

Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
146

4. Run the patch-installer program.
You can run the patch installer right from the Download
dialog box by clicking Open after the download has
completed, or find it with Windows Explorer and
double-click it to run it that way.
You see one or two dialog boxes that contain the usual
disclaimers. After you get through those, the actual
patch installation takes place.
5. Reboot your computer.
Most of the time your computer asks for a reboot. I
highly recommend that you do so, even if it doesn’t ask
you. You’ve already stopped all your other programs —
right? — so this should be a minor inconvenience.
I think it’s a good idea to reboot your computer after each
security patch, in the event that you’re installing more than
one. I’ve been burned in the past by making too many changes
without doing reboots in between them. I don’t want the same
thing to happen to you.
Patching other common programs
Once in a while, security patches are issued for non-Microsoft
products. Like with Microsoft programs, vulnerabilities are
occasionally discovered in these other programs that permit a
wily hacker to break into your computer or damage your
information. A few examples are listed here:
 Adobe Acrobat Reader: Nearly everyone has Acrobat
Reader. Once in a while, a vulnerability is discovered
in Adobe’s PDF (Portable Document Format) language
that necessitates a patch. Acrobat Reader is configured
to automatically check for the availability of security
patches. If a patch becomes available, you see a dialog
box asking whether you wish to download and install an
update.
 RealAudio Player: RealAudio Player is famous (or notori-
ous, depending on your point of view) for staying in con-
tact with the RealAudio company to keep you informed
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 147

about new products. RealAudio Player displays a dialog
box asking whether you want to update.
 Macromedia Flash and Shockwave: These programs are
plug-ins to Internet Explorer (not separate programs),
used to display certain animated graphics and other cool
effects. These plug-ins are configured to “phone home”
occasionally to see whether updates are available. Usually
you see a terse dialog box that reads something like, “An
update is available. Install now?” If you have a few min-
utes, these updates are generally a good idea to do.
 Others: Many other products have manual or automatic
features to check for updates. You should become familiar
with your programs and how to tell whether updates —
particular security patches — are available. It’s all a part
of good computer hygiene.
The update you may be consenting to may or may not
require a fee. Not all updates are free, and not all fee-
based updates announce themselves clearly as such. And
if you are using an old version of a software product, its
manufacturer may no longer be creating updates or
patches for it.
Installing Service Packs
A service pack is like a patch — it contains changes to soft-
ware on your computer — but it’s actually a collection of
patches (as well as other changes) rolled into a major package
and installed all at once.
Service packs can be found and installed using Windows
Update, and you can also download them from the Microsoft
Web site, but they’re not available in Automatic Updates.
Microsoft creates service packs for Windows, Microsoft
Office, Internet Explorer, and other products.
If you’re diligent about security patches, then you’ll want to
know that quite often a service pack includes some security
patches you’ve already installed on your computer. Don’t
worry — your computer knows what to do.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
148

Generally I recommend installing service packs. My advice for
your doing so comes with these conditions:
 If you have an important deadline that you need to
meet using your computer, finish your work first.
Service Pack installation takes a long time — and it can
probably wait. In the meantime, to protect yourself, you
can install the most critical individual security patches if
you must.
 Back up all your important files first (see Chapter 12).
 Reboot your computer after the service pack is
installed.
 Read all available information about the service pack
on Microsoft’s Web site. Because service packs often
modify program features, it’s a good idea to be familiar
with what changes you can expect.
 Give yourself plenty of time. Service packs can take a
very long time to download (as long as several hours),
particularly if you have a dial-up connection.
 Don’t be too anxious to install a brand-new service
pack. Once in a great while, there is some problem asso-
ciated with service packs. If you discover that a new
service pack has been created, wait a week or two if you
can. Any problems are usually identified and fixed in that
period of time.
 Make sure you have plenty of disk space. Service packs
in some cases require 10 MB, 20 MB, or even 50 MB of
space. If your computer is really low on space, the serv-
ice pack installation may fail (the service pack installa-
tion program checks available space, but I’m not so sure
it’s foolproof). But even if the service pack installation is
successful, you don’t want to be left with too little free
space. This can make it hard for you to work with your
files, and it’s a known fact that a Windows computer with
very little free space available (less than 5 percent)
begins to get grumpy and slooooooooowwwws down.
Operating systems are fragile enough under ideal condi-
tions, and it’s not a good idea to stress them out.
To find the amount of free disk space in Windows 2000
and Windows XP, right-click on My Computer and select
Explore.
Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 149

 After you install the service pack, reboot the computer
and try things out to see if things work the same as
before.
The procedure for installing service packs is exactly the same
as that for patches, whether you install them using Windows
Update if you download them from the Microsoft Web site.
Just be prepared for the installation to take quite a while.
Unlike patches, you must have your original CDs to complete
the installation of a service pack for Microsoft Windows 2000,
Windows XP, Microsoft Office 2000, Office XP, or Office 2003. If
you can’t find your original CDs, you won’t be able to install
the service pack!
Removing Patches
While it should be a rare occurrence, you may find yourself in
a situation where you need to remove a patch. In the past sev-
eral years, personally, I have never needed to remove a patch,
but I was in a situation recently where an Internet Explorer
(IE) patch changed the way that IE worked, in a very subtle
but irritating way. But by the time I was ready to pull the
patch out, Microsoft came out with a new security patch that
fixed newly discovered vulnerabilities and (oh yeah) cor-
rected the anomaly.
If you’re not sure which patch you need to remove, you will
need to cross-reference the “Q article” number found on
Microsoft’s Web site (Figure 9-10 shows an example). To find a
specific Q article, type in Q and the article number (for exam-
ple, Q324096) in the search field on Microsoft’s Web site.
Read up on what the patch does before you try to remove it.
Make sure the cure isn’t worse than the disease. Then you can
follow this procedure to remove the patch:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel. Then select
Add/Remove Programs.
2. If you’re sure that you have identified a patch to
remove, select it from the Add/Remove Programs
window and click the Change/Remove button.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
150

Figure 9-10: List of installed patches (note the Q article).
3. In the Uninstall wizard, click Next and answer any
questions to remove the patch.
4. Reboot your computer.
Gotta do it.
Patches usually contain information needed to remove the
patch later if needed. However, once in a while Microsoft
releases a patch that cannot be removed. I don’t know why
this is, and I am not going to speculate (in writing). It’s just
one of those things we have to deal with.
Whoops, end of trail. I hope that you haven’t just wound up
here, after all this trouble trying to remove a patch, only to
discover that the patch you want to remove is permanent.
That’s why I advise you to read the information carefully
before installing a patch.
So what is the remedy if you have to remove a nonremovable
patch? Simple. Well, not really: You have to reinstall Windows.
Ouch!

Chapter 9: Installing Security Patches 151

If you are using Windows XP and consider yourself an
advanced user, you can back out a patch through the System
Restore feature. Whenever changes such as patches are
installed on the computer, Windows first creates a Restore
Point, and using System Restore you can return your com-
puter to its configuration at that point in time.
System Restore is configured via the control panel. To restore
your computer to an earlier time, choose Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪System Tools➪System Restore.
System Restore will not touch your documents — it will only
restore Windows files to the earlier time that you specify.

Analyzing your patch situation
with MBSA
Microsoft has a nifty tool available
that you can use to determine the
security of your computer. It is called
the Microsoft Baseline Security
Analyzer, or MBSA. It’s not usually
mentioned on the Microsoft Security
Web page, but if you go to Microsoft’s
download page or just search for
MBSA, you can find it quickly.
Use MBSA to scan your computer
only when your Internet access is
enabled, as MBSA needs to download
up-to-date security information from
Microsoft. MBSA will take a minute
or two to run, and then it will display
a list of patches that need to be
installed, as well as other configura-
tion issues it may consider important.
Only 
make 
the 
recommended
changes if you understand what the
changes will do to your computer.
Otherwise you can get yourself into a
sticky wicket!

f you have a good antivirus program that you diligently
keep updated, your computer is well protected from many
threats associated with connecting to the Internet. It would,
however, be an overstatement to say that you’re safe from
everything that can go wrong. Worms sniff around your com-
puter to find openings that a firewall can block before the
worms can reach your computer.
Several meddlesome companies use a variety of tools and
methods to track your movements on the Internet: which Web
sites you visit and from which Web sites you purchase goods
and services. Some devious Web site operators will even
attempt to reconfigure your Web browser to visit their site
when you first start your browser or change the page dis-
played if you mistype a Web site’s name. If this concerns you,
consider getting one or more antispyware programs.
If, in addition to your antivirus program, you also get a fire-
wall and a spyware blocker, then your computer will have a
considerably higher level of protection.

Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
154
Protecting Your Computer
with a Firewall
Windows computers can be attacked in many ways — and not
just with viruses, worms, or Trojan horses. Another popular
way to attack a Windows computer is to attempt to communi-
cate to it over any of the network “ports” found on Windows
computers. These ports are kind of like TV channels or radio
frequencies: Computers are set up to listen for messages that
may arrive from other computers — this is how they commu-
nicate with one another.
How firewalls work
Firewalls monitor all the communication between your com-
puter and the Internet. Firewalls know what kinds of commu-
nication are allowed to flow in and out. They know this because
they have something called an “access control list” — a list of
rules that specify precisely what kinds of communications are
allowed and what kinds are blocked. The firewalls made for
the consumer market (that’s us) are usually preconfigured to
offer maximum protection right out of the box.
The configuration required to facilitate communication
between two computers in a home network makes them
highly vulnerable to attack from any computer on the Internet.
(Sinister music begins to play; the camera zooms in. . . .)
To turn your computer into a tattletale zombie, all anyone on
the Internet needs to do is send a specially tailored message
from their computer to one of yours — over one of the open
ports.
Whether the firewall is a hardware device connected to your
network, or a software program in your computer, a firewall
will automatically block all unwanted network communication
from the Internet, while at the same time permitting any legiti-
mate communication that you need to use your computer.
Figure 10-1 shows how a firewall blocks certain communica-
tion paths from the Internet.

Figure 10-1: A firewall blocks unwanted communication from the Internet.
There are two principal types of firewalls: hardware and soft-
ware. A hardware firewall is a device connected to the network
in such a way that all communications between any computer
and the Internet must pass through the firewall and be exam-
ined to see whether they should be discarded or allowed to
pass through.
A software firewall is a program that runs on a computer and
performs the same type of examination of network communi-
cations that a hardware firewall does. But where a hardware
firewall can protect all of the computers on a network, a soft-
ware firewall only protects the computer it is running on.
Table 10-1 lists some of the pros and cons of hardware and
software firewalls.

Software firewalls
A software firewall is a program that runs inside your computer
and blocks unwanted network traffic, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Software firewalls are a necessity for any laptop computer,
especially one that connects to the Internet from a variety of
locations. Wherever your laptop goes, so too goes your fire-
wall, because it’s right there inside. But if you have a desktop
computer and you connect to the Internet using a dial-up
modem, you’ve got to get a software firewall to protect it.
Sometimes software firewalls are known as personal firewalls,
so named because they are your very own.

Some major antivirus companies have software firewalls in
their product families; some of them have all-in-one products
that include antivirus, antispam, firewall, and other compo-
nents. There are also some good software firewall products
that have no affiliation with antivirus companies.
Purchasing software firewalls
If you’re in the market for antivirus software, or would con-
sider upgrading or switching brands, then I suggest you give
all-in-one PC security products serious consideration. Some
companies with such offerings include:
 Norton Internet Security from Symantec: Included
in this bundle are antivirus, firewall, privacy control,
antispam, and parental control. www.symantec.com
 Internet Security Suite from McAfee: This bundle
includes antivirus, firewall, antispam, and privacy con-
trol. www.mcafee.com
 PC-Cillin Internet Security from Trend Micro: This
includes antivirus for your PC and for your PDA, spam-
filtering, privacy protection, and antispyware. www.
trendmicro.com
Installing and configuring software firewalls
I’m not going to delve into the details on installing the soft-
ware firewalls included with the big boys like Symantec and
McAfee. Instead, I’ll tell you about installing and configuring
the leading independent (not affiliated with any big and all-
powerful antivirus companies) software firewall product,
ZoneAlarm, which is available from www.zonelabs.com. Zone
Labs has had a free version of their product — which is very
good — available for several years. Follow these steps to
install and configure this product:
1. Download the ZoneAlarm setup file from www.
zonelabs.com and save it on your hard drive.
2. Run the download file, which will resemble the
name zlsSetup_45_538.exe.
3. Answer some installation questions.
You’re asked a few questions typical of small program
installation (location of program files, whether you
accept the licensing terms, and so on). Defaults are
usually fine.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 157

4. Answer some marketing questions.
ZoneAlarm asks you a few questions about how many
computers you have and the speed of your Internet
connection. None of these questions has any bearing
on ZoneAlarm’s configuration.
5. Take the tour.
ZoneAlarm takes you on a little tour. If you haven’t
used ZoneAlarm, I suggest you take the time to watch
the tour, as it will give you useful information about
how to set up and use ZoneAlarm.
Was that so hard? Now that ZoneAlarm is installed, there are a
few configuration settings to make. Follow these steps:
1. Double-click the ZoneAlarm icon in the system tray.
The ZoneAlarm Control Center opens, in which you
can make configuration changes.
2. Click the Overview link; then click the Preferences
tab, as shown in Figure 10-3.
3. In the Check for Updates panel, make sure that the
Automatically option is selected.
Figure 10-3: ZoneAlarm’s Preferences tab in the Overview window.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
158

4. Click the Check for Update button.
Doing so ensures that your ZoneAlarm program can
communicate to the Zone Labs update server. If this
fails, something is probably wrong with your Internet
connection. Time to troubleshoot. First thing: Remove
ZoneAlarm. Install it again and see if things are okay.
Check its configuration.
5. In the General panel, ensure that the Load
ZoneAlarm at Startup check box and the Protect the
ZoneAlarm Client check box are both selected.
The Protect the ZoneAlarm Client setting protects the
ZoneAlarm program from Trojan horse programs that
may try to disable ZoneAlarm.
6. In the Contact with Zone Labs panel, select the
check boxes that read Alert me with a pop-up
before I make contact and Hide the last
octet of my IP address when applicable.
7. Click the Firewall link; then click the Main tab, as
shown in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4: ZoneAlarm’s Main tab in the Firewall window.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 159

8. Ensure that the Internet Zone Security level is set to
High and that the Trusted Zone Security level is set
to Medium.
Setting the Internet Zone Security level to High pro-
vides maximum protection against hostile threats on
the Internet. The Trusted Zone Security level can usu-
ally be lower, because this means your computer is
protected from other computers in the local network.
9. Click the Program Control link; then click the
Main tab.
10. Set the Program Control Security level to Medium.
At the Medium level, the first time a program needs to
access your local network or the Internet, ZoneAlarm
asks you if that program should be allowed to con-
nect. For each program that you use, you will only
have to answer this question once, provided you
check the Remember This Answer check box.
The Automatic Lock option can be set to Off or On —
I don’t care which you choose. I keep mine off.
Automatic Lock protects your computer if you stop
using it for an extended period of time. You can con-
figure Automatic Lock to activate after a certain
period of inactivity, or even when your screen saver
is activated.
The Programs tab of the Program Control window
displays a list of all the programs that ZoneAlarm is
keeping track of, along with information about which
programs are permitted to communicate over the
Internet and which are not. The configuration settings
for each program are changed in this window.
11. Click the Alerts & Logs link; then click the Main tab.
12. In the Alarm Events Shown panel, select the On
option to show all alerts.
The Log Viewer tab displays a list of blocked and
permitted events. This log can be used to help
troubleshoot a communications issue, and it’s also
gratifying to see all of the attacks that the firewall is
blocking.
13. Click the E-mail Protection link and ensure that the
On option is selected in the Basic MailSafe Settings
panel.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
160

Basic MailSafe blocks VBS (Visual Basic Script) attach-
ments in incoming e-mail messages. Frequently, VBS
attachments are included in Trojan horse messages
that attempt to harm your computer. Basic MailSafe
is not configurable in the free version of ZoneAlarm;
there are several settings available in Zone Alarm Pro.
Using software firewalls
When they are configured correctly, there is little — if
anything — to do on a software firewall. If you’re using a soft-
ware firewall that asks you whether the so-and-so program
should be permitted to access the Internet, you’ll still see
these messages from time to time.
In most cases, you need never look at the logs in which the
entries for blocked communications are kept. You’re hiring
the firewall to keep everyone out, but not necessarily to tell
you who they all are.
Make sure that you’re apprised of any upgrades in your fire-
wall software. Sometimes flaws are found that need to be
fixed, and improvements come along from time to time. To
make sure that your firewall software is kept up to date, con-
figure your firewall program to check automatically for
updates or add yourself to the firewall company’s e-mail dis-
tribution list.
With ZoneAlarm and other similar programs, you need to pay
close attention to those pop-up dialog boxes that ask if the 
so-and-so program should be allowed to communicate to the
Internet. Viruses and worms that attempt to communicate to
other computers will be blocked, only if you answer “no.” If
you don’t pay attention and you answer “yes,” “yes,” “yes” to
every program that comes up without reading them, then you
may as well not waste your time and money on a firewall.
In addition to ensuring that you have the latest software for
your firewall, you also need to familiarize yourself with the
way that your firewall tells you whether it’s functioning prop-
erly or not. Most software firewall programs utilize an easy-to-
read status icon in your system tray so that you can quickly
check on the status of your firewall.
Your system tray is like a dashboard that quickly tells you the
status of your computer. I recommend you not configure your
system tray to automatically hide itself.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 161

Hardware firewalls
If you have an “always on” Internet connection, then consider
using a hardware firewall. A hardware firewall protects all of
the computers and other devices on your network, eliminat-
ing the need to install a software firewall on each one.
If you’re not convinced that you need a firewall, then consider
this: fully one third of all personally-owned computers on
broadband (cable modem, DSL, and so on) connections have
had one or more Trojan horse programs installed and are
actively used to relay millions of spam messages and partici-
pate in massive distributed denial-of-service attacks. See the
sidebar titled “The Legion of Zombies” in Chapter 1 for the
horrifying truth.
Hardware firewalls are generally set-it-and-forget-it (or even
plug-it-in-and-forget-it) and are very reliable. I have used
Netgear and D-Link firewalls (the Netgear firewall was a com-
bination four-port network switch and firewall, the D-Link a
combination Wi-Fi network access point, four-port network
switch, and firewall), and both were highly reliable. I also use
ZoneAlarm on all PCs on my home network, and none has
ever detected traffic that the firewalls should have blocked. I
have used default settings on both firewall products and have
never needed to troubleshoot a problem.
In fact, both hardware firewalls I have used were “plug and
play” — all I needed to do was connect them to the network
and turn them on, and they began working immediately.
I’m sure that the other major brands of hardware firewalls
(which, as I have mentioned, are nearly always bundled with
other features such as network switch and wireless network)
are as easy to set up and use. However, if you’re intimidated
by this (or aren’t all that sure you can make it work), it may be
time to enlist your computer-expert friend again or reach for
your copy of Home Networking For Dummies.
Selecting and purchasing hardware firewalls
A hardware firewall is a small appliance that you install in your
home network. The firewall protects every computer — in
fact, anything connected to your network — from the threats
present on the Internet.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
162

You can’t just buy a firewall-only appliance. Instead, many
common devices purchased for home networks — switches,
routers, and wireless access points — come with a firewall
built in. This is a convenience, as nearly all home networks
need one or more of these other devices anyway (Figure 10-5
shows where a firewall stands between your home network
and the Internet). The most popular hardware devices contain
all these functions in one compact unit.
Figure 10-5: Diagram of a typical home LAN with a firewall in place.
Installing hardware firewalls
There are many different kinds of home networking appliance
products that contain firewalls, and many different kinds of
home networks. Instead of showing every possible combina-
tion of firewall product and home network, I provide a check-
list to help you decide what to do:
 Draw a picture of how your network devices fit together —
DSL modem, cable modem, computer(s), anything else,
and the wiring that connects them — before you start. If
you cannot make the firewall work, you need to put your
network back together the way it was before you started.

 Label your cables. Same reason.
 Write down your computer’s network settings before you
begin. Follow these instructions to view these settings:
• In Windows 2000, right-click My Network Places,
click Properties, right-click Local Area Connection,
and click Properties. Find and click TCP/IP in the
list of connection types, and click Properties. Write
down all of the settings in the General and
Advanced windows.
• In Windows XP, right-click My Network Places,
click Properties, find and right-click Local Area
Connection (found in the LAN section), and click
Properties. Find and click TCP/IP in the list of con-
nection types, and click Properties. Write down all
of the settings in the General and Alternate
Configuration tabs. Don’t forget to look at any
Advanced settings.
 Read the installation instructions that accompany your
firewall before you begin. Make sure you understand how
to do everything you have to do.
 Make sure you have all the necessary cabling. You may
need one or more additional “patch cords” (they look like
phone cords but have wider connectors).
 Make sure you have enough electrical outlets. Your fire-
wall will take up one or more plugs, depending on the
shape of your power supply and your plug strip.
 Install the firewall in a safe, out-of-the-way location where
it will not get spilled on, stepped on, or covered with
papers (mine has suffered all of these fates). Make sure
it’s in a place where you can see the blinking lights.
 Be patient. Getting a firewall working should not be too
much more difficult than connecting a DVD player to
your stereo.
 Consider using small adhesive labels (P-Touch or Dymo,
for instance) to label your wires and the connectors on
your firewall. You may be able to position the labels so
that they align with the indicator lights on the front of
the firewall so that you can easily see the status of the
different ports. It’s been my experience that the labels on
the firewalls are a bit small, and of course the factory
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
164

labels don’t say “Corinne’s Computer” or “Peter’s
Computer.” Well, probably not.
 Reward yourself for a job well done. Order a pizza,
drink a beer, make love, or take a cruise. (Or have a
good read; there are For Dummies books to help with
all these activities.)
There is one important task to do after your firewall is run-
ning. You must change the firewall’s default password! Read the
user’s manual carefully and locate the instructions on how to
change the password. Use a new password that’s easy for you
to remember but difficult for others to guess. Write it down in
a safe place.
The reason to change the firewall’s default password is this: If
a security vulnerability is ever discovered in the make and
model of firewall that you’re using, you could be in trouble if
your firewall still has the default password. Hackers know the
default passwords for everything, and it could give them
access to your network and your computers.
Although serious security vulnerabilities in home firewall
appliances are rare, you can’t be too careful. Better safe than
sorry in all things Internet.
Dealing with Spyware
Viruses are not the only kind of malicious code that can be
planted inside of your computer. Spyware, while not exactly
(or at least always) malicious, is intrusive to many on account
of its goal of tracking or controlling your Internet usage. 
In a word, spyware is about surveillance. From cookies that
track your surfing and buying habits to plug-ins that attempt
to hijack your browser to key-loggers that actually record
your keystrokes, spyware is trying to find out more about you
on every level, and on both sides of the law.
Not to worry. After reading this chapter, you’ll know so much
about spyware that you can impress your friends and neigh-
bors with your stylish new cloak and dagger — or at least
with a spyware-free computer.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 165

Figuring out how spyware
invades your privacy
Spyware is a term that applies to a wide variety of features,
functions, and bits of software designed for one purpose: to
monitor a user’s computing habits and send that data back to
a central monitoring site. (And you thought there were no
“Peeping Toms” on the Internet? Ha!) Spyware uses various
methods to track the virtual movements of individuals as they
explore the Internet:
 Cookies: Some banner-ad companies (the source of those
“banner ads” that appear on many Web sites) use these
tiny globs of code to identify your individual system and
record what Web sites you visit. The idea is to determine
which people are seeing which banner ads. This all hap-
pens without your clicking a single ad.
 ActiveX controls: Some Web sites or banner ads may
attempt to download ActiveX controls into your com-
puter. These are actual programs that can (unbeknownst
to you) track your movements, and possibly even cap-
ture information such as your e-mail address and demo-
graphics — gender, age group, geographic region, race,
anything that can be used to characterize a targeted
group of potential buyers.
 Internet Explorer modifications: Some Web sites — or
even HTML-encoded e-mail messages — can attempt to
modify certain configuration settings in your Internet
Explorer Web browser — for example:
• Changing the browser’s home page (the page dis-
played when you start the browser or when you
click the Home button in the browser toolbar).
• Changing the Web site that your browser visits if
you misspell a URL when you type it in.
• Adding Web sites to your list of bookmarks.
 Surveillance programs: Whether in the name of national
(in)security or crass commercial advantage, nearly any-
thing that can be done without your knowledge will be
done, or at least attempted. For instance. . . . 
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
166

• Key loggers: Some Web sites try to install these
programs on your computer to capture your every
keystroke and mouse movement — and report
them to who-knows-where. For that matter, many
viruses also attempt to install key loggers on your
computer. Something about capturing your bank
account numbers and passwords I guess. . . .
• Screen-capture tools: These programs “take a pic-
ture” of what’s on your screen and send a copy
along to the (ahem) interested parties.
• Voice? Before long, it may be possible to record
sounds — after all, many newer computers have
built-in microphones — but such instant bugging is
still in the realm of science fiction. So far.
These unwelcome visitors generally fall outside the scope of
what antivirus programs look for. That means (cue the sinister
music) one or more of them may be on your computer now.
Using spyware blockers
Spyware can be detected, blocked, removed, and sometimes
even prevented with spyware blockers. This section tells you
how they work, where to find and install them, and how to
use them.
Understanding how spyware blockers work
Spyware blockers check your computer for the existence of
spyware components. There are two main ways that these
tools work: through whole-computer scans and through real-
time detection.
If this sounds similar, it should. These are the two main ways
that antivirus programs work.
Spyware blockers watch your computer for things that
antivirus programs don’t (and if you read the previous sec-
tion, they’ll look familiar):
 Cookies: These are the identifiers that Web sites plant on
your computer to identify you, whether during a session
or between sessions. They make the Web site easier to
navigate. They also (in a sense) tag your computer as a
known visitor.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 167

 Internet Explorer settings: Some spyware attempts to
hijack your browser by changing your default home page
or search settings, and pointing your browser toward
their Web sites instead of those you want to visit.
 Downloaded programs: When you visit some Web sites,
they put little supplementary programs on your com-
puter (such as ActiveX and JavaScript). These run on
your computer while you’re visiting the Web site — and
are still on your computer when you log off.
Spyware blockers that watch your computer’s activity in real
time will block a Web site’s attempt to plant a cookie or down-
load a program onto your system. Depending on how you con-
figure it, your spyware blocker may silently block any such
trespassers, or tell you when such attempts are being blocked.
Also — like their antivirus cousins — spyware blockers must
have up-to-date lists of known spyware on board so they can
block (or tell you about) not only the older, well-known spy-
ware components, but also the latest and greatest (or sneaki-
est and creepiest) spyware. This is done through signature-file
updates that can occur automatically or be performed manu-
ally. (For more on how signature-file updates work, see
Chapter 8.)
So, fortunately, using spyware blockers is not all that different
from using antivirus programs. Have them run automatically
at startup, manually scan once in a while, and get them
updated regularly.
Where to find spyware blockers
Because spyware blocking is an emerging technology, there
are a few well-established spyware blocker programs, but
many, many upstarts and hopefuls. Some good spyware block-
ers are independents; others are part portfolios of antivirus
companies. Personally, I think that by 2005, we’ll see market
consolidation, mergers, and acquisitions, putting the best
spyware blockers into the portfolios of big companies like
Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro, and Computer Associates.
And many upstarts will have closed up shop and moved on
to something else. (Ah, futurism. Ah, the free market.)
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
168

Oh yeah, I’m supposed to tell you where to find spyware
blockers. I’ll tell you about three reputable, well-known, and
effective spyware blockers and where to get them. All three of
these are free; some have fee-based “full versions” available
that offer additional features (though so far none comes with
a crystal ball):
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 169
Cookies: Necessary or evil?
There are two types of cookies. Or,
more accurately, I should say, two
uses for cookies. There are session
cookies and persistent cookies.
 Session cookies are used to
identify individual users as they
interact with a Web site. For
instance, to manage the sessions
for several users, an online bank-
ing server must be able to posi-
tively distinguish one user from
another. This is done through
cookies. Each time the user clicks
a link or pushes a button, the
online banking program must first
identify which person this is, and
then perform whatever steps are
required for that person. While
it’s true that session cookies are
not the only way to distinguish
users, it’s a very popular and reli-
able way to do so.
 Persistent cookies are used to
associate a person’s identity from
one Web site visit to the next.
Like session cookies, persistent
cookies provide for a user expe-
rience that many people appreci-
ate. The most popular use of
persistent cookies is the Web
site that “remembers” you from
one visit to the next (even if you
visit only occasionally), and auto-
matically displays your prefer-
ences, customizations, and so
forth (zip code, name, colors, and
so on).
Persistent cookies are almost uni-
versally used to identify users from
one visit to the next. Unlike session
cookies, where there are a couple of
technically feasible alternatives for
tracking sessions, persistent cookies
are practically the only available
means for remembering users
between visits.
One common use of persistent cook-
ies is for the tracking of users’ Web
surfing habits. Most, if not all, big
banner-ad companies use persistent
cookies when displaying banner ads.
Here is an example: The company
AdClick displays banner ads on many
Web sites. When you visit a Web site,
AdClick notes your presence there.
Later, when you visit another Web
site where AdClick displays banner
ads, AdClick notes your presence
there, too. Over time, AdClick builds
up a history of all the sites you visited
where AdClick displays banner ads.

 Ad-aware: Pioneer and granddaddy of spyware blockers.
The free version permits manual scanning only, while the
full version provides real-time protection. You can get
Ad-aware from www.lavasoft.de.
 Spybot: Another good program that provides both real-
time prevention and system scanning. You can find
Spybot at www.safer-networking.org.
 SpywareBlaster: This program provides real-time detec-
tion and prevention. You can get SpywareBlaster from
www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareblaster.html.
In addition to the three sites listed above, these tools are also
available from www.download.com.
A corporate lawyer at Wiley Publishing, Inc. (the publisher of
these fine books) has reminded me to mention that these spy-
ware blockers are use-at-your-own-risk products and have no
formal product support available.
Frankly, I run all three of these programs on every one of the
four or five computers I use. I’ve been using Ad-aware for sev-
eral years and Spybot for about a year. Between the two, I get
pretty good protection and coverage. Recently I have discov-
ered SpywareBlaster; it’s nice, complementary, and it concen-
trates more on prevention than detection.
Many spyware blockers are available, and some may be quite
good (others are probably little more than twenty-first-century
snake oil). I’m not going to even attempt to function like
Consumer Reports magazine for spyware blockers, but here’s
my advice: If you stick with Ad-aware, Spybot, SpywareBlaster,
or an antispyware program that’s part product portfolio of
any major antivirus vendors, you’ll be in good shape.
Installing spyware blockers
Installation for Ad-aware, Spybot, and SpywareBlaster are all
very straightforward. After you download each program, it’s
just a matter of running the downloaded program and you’re
off to the races. I give you some particulars here.
Ad-aware
After you download the Ad-aware installation program, you
can run it. Just double-click on the file you downloaded.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
170

Go ahead and click the Next button as many times as needed
to proceed through the installation process. The default set-
tings are fine for almost everyone.
Spybot
After downloading the Spybot installation program, you can
run it to install the program. Find it with Windows Explorer
and double-click its icon.
Click Next as you proceed screen-by-screen with the installa-
tion. Be sure to read the license agreement and click the I
Accept the Agreement option if you do agree with it. The
default installation setting should be fine for you.
SpywareBlaster
Download the installation program and run it.
Click Next to proceed through the installation procedure.
Make sure you read the license agreement before you accept
it. (The lawyers made me say that. And that.)
After SpywareBlaster has been installed, you can choose to
run it right away if you like.
The first time you run SpywareBlaster, you see a Getting
Started window that shows you how to perform common
tasks such as enabling and disabling protection and down-
loading updates.
You must activate its protection before SpywareBlaster will
protect your computer. If you see the message Internet
Explorer protection is disabled in the main
SpywareBlaster window, then Internet Explorer protection
needs to be activated. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Click here to enable protection link to the
right of the message that says Internet Explorer
protection is disabled.
The Internet Explorer Protection window appears, as
shown in Figure 10-6.
2. Select the check boxes that read Prevent the
installation of ActiveX-based spyware,
dialers, etc. and Prevent spyware/tracking
cookies.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 171

This automatically protects you against all of the
known spyware threats, as shown in the list below the
check boxes. You can examine the list and unprotect
yourself from any individual sites if you want, but I
wouldn’t advise it.
3. Click the Protect Against Checked Items button at
the bottom of the screen.
4. Click the Status box at the top of the screen to return
to the main Protection screen.
Figure 10-6: Configuring SpywareBlaster’s Internet Explorer protection.
Similarly, if you see the message that reads Restricted
Sites protection is disabled, activate restriction of
sites to protect you against known Web sites that distribute
spyware. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click the Click here to enable protection link next to
the message that says Restricted Sites protec-
tion is disabled.
The Restricted Sites Protection dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 10-7.
2. Select the check box that reads Restrict the
actions of spyware/ad/tracking sites in
Internet Explorer.
3. Click the Protect Against Checked Items button at
the bottom of the screen.

restricted sites.
Updating spyware blocker signatures
Like antivirus programs, spyware blocker programs quickly
become ineffective if not regularly updated. The following sec-
tions show you how to update signatures for the three spy-
ware blockers I recommend.
Ad-aware
To update the Ad-aware program signatures, follow these steps:
1. In the main Ad-aware window, click the Check for
Updates Now link.
The Performing Webupdate dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-8: Ad-aware is ready to connect and download new signatures.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 173

2. Click the Connect button.
The program tells you whether updates are available.
3. If updates are available, click the Download Now
button.
Ad-aware downloads and installs new definitions.
4. Click the Finish button.
You’re done!
Spybot
To update Spybot’s spyware signatures, follow these steps:
1. Start the Spybot program.
2. Find and click the Search for Updates button.
If updates are available, Spybot will display a list of
modules that you can download to update Spybot’s
software and spyware signatures, as shown in
Figure 10-9.
3. Check any updates that are unchecked.
Figure 10-9: Updating Spybot’s spyware signatures.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
174

4. Click the Download Updates button near the top of
the Spybot window.
After the updates have been downloaded, Spybot will
restart itself and you’ll see the main menu again.
SpywareBlaster
Follow these steps to update the SpywareBlaster signatures:
1. Start SpywareBlaster.
2. In the main SpywareBlaster window, click the
Updates tab on the left side.
3. In the SpywareBlaster Updates window, click the
Check for Updates button. SpywareBlaster will
search for updates, as shown in Figure 10-10.
SpywareBlaster checks whether there are newer
updates available and downloads them if so.
4. If new updates were downloaded, click the Enable
Protection for All Unprotected Items link.
Ta-da!
I recommend that you update spyware signatures and scan for
spyware no less than once every two weeks. If you have a lot
to lose, or you spend a lot of time surfing the Web, you may
wish to update and scan as frequently as two or three times
each week.
Figure 10-10: Updating SpywareBlaster’s spyware signatures.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 175

Using spyware blockers
Just downloading a spyware blocker is not enough, 007. You
must use it to get the full effect. Just try to bring it back in one
piece this time.
Ad-aware
After downloading and updating Ad-aware, you’re ready to
begin using it. To scan your computer for spyware, follow
these steps:
1. Go ahead and start the Ad-aware program if you
haven’t already.
2. Click the Start button.
3. On the Preparing System Scan window, select the
Perform Smart System-Scan option, then click the
Next button.
Ad-aware scans your entire computer for spyware, as
shown in Figure 10-11. This could take from 10 to 40
minutes, depending upon the speed of your computer
and the size of your hard drive.
When the scan has completed, Ad-aware tells you how
many offending items were found on your computer,
as shown in Figure 10-12.
4. Select the items found. The easiest way to do this is
to right-click on one of the items and click the Select
All Objects button. 
Figure 10-11: Scanning for spyware with Ad-aware.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
176

Figure 10-12: Ad-aware captures some sinister fellow travelers.
5. Click Next; then click OK to remove all the spyware
that Ad-Aware found.
Ad-aware returns you to the main Ad-aware screen.
Spybot
After you have installed and configured Spybot, follow these
steps to scan your computer for spyware:
1. Start Spybot.
2. Click the Check for Problems button.
Spybot scans your computer for all the spyware that
Spybot knows about and displays the results. The
scan will take quite a while, and will show progress
at the bottom of the window. You’ll see an estimated
time remaining at the lower right corner window — I
presume it’s accurate, but (as the car ads say) “your
mileage may vary.”
When the scan has completed, Spybot displays all spy-
ware items it has found, as shown in Figure 10-13.
Chapter 10: Using Firewalls and Spyware Blockers 177

Figure 10-13: Spybot scan has identified lots of spyware in this scan.
If any problems are found, they’re displayed in the
main window. To view details about any item (see
Figure 10-14) select it by clicking the Description of
this product link near the bottom of the window.
3. Click the Fix selected problems link to remove the
selected items displayed in the window.
Figure 10-14: Spybot has committed identified spyware to the deep.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
178

Easy, huh?
You can also configure Spybot to provide real-time protection
for your computer, to prevent certain problems from occur-
ring. To configure this, follow these instructions: 
1. Click the Immunize button.
Doing so brings up the Immunize screen.
2. In the Permanent Internet Explorer Protection sec-
tion of the window, click the Immunize button.
3. In the Permanently Running Bad Download Blocker
for Internet Explorer section of the window, click
Install.
4. To the left of the Install button, select Ask for
Blocking Confirmation so that you can control
whether bad downloads should be blocked or not.
Then, when you’re surfing the Net, if Spybot detects
spyware that should be blocked, it will pause and then
display a dialog box asking whether the download
should be blocked or not.
5. In the lowermost part of Spybot’s Immunize window
in the Recommended Miscellaneous Protections sec-
tion, select the option that reads Lock hosts file
read-only as protection against hackers as
well as the option that reads Lock IE start page
against user changes.
If you select the Lock IE control panel against
opening from within IE option, you won’t be able
to make any configuration changes in Internet
Explorer until you come back to Spybot and uncheck
this. However, this does provide the highest protec-
tion against any spyware from being able to change
the configuration settings in your browser.
SpywareBlaster
There really isn’t anything to do to operate SpywareBlaster
other than to periodically update its signature. After you con-
figure it, SpywareBlaster watches your computer and blocks
all the spyware that it knows about. This is a lot like the real-
time protection provided by antivirus programs (for more
about that, see Chapter 8).

Protecting PDAs
from Viruses
In This Chapter
 Why antivirus software is needed for PDAs
 Installing and configuring antivirus software on PDAs
 Protecting your PDA in other ways
F
ar from the bumpkins they were long ago, PDAs (or per-
sonal digital assistants and cell phones with PDA func-
tionality) now sport rich operating systems and beaucoup
connectivity. PDAs are growing up much like PCs have in the
past ten years, although at a much faster clip. The wealth of
connectivity options has not gone unnoticed: The era of virus
and other attacks against PDAs has begun.
The antivirus companies have responded by offering antivirus
software for PDAs. Individuals and large corporations are pur-
chasing antivirus software for PDAs in order to take an early
lead against the hackers and virus writers of the world.
PDAs are designed to exchange data freely with PCs, with little
attention paid to the information being exchanged. With this
in mind, antivirus software for PDAs exists as much to protect
the PDA as it does to protect its host PC. Otherwise, the con-
duit between the PDA and the PC is not guarded as much as it
should be.
This chapter tells you more about why you need antivirus
software for your PDA, where to find it, as well as other meas-
ures you should take to protect your information.

Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
182
PDAs Grow Up (And Grow
Vulnerable)
PDAs can be wonderful tools for people on the go who need
instant access to their schedules, contacts, and other informa-
tion. Early PDAs were little more than electronic calendars and
appointment books, so it was difficult — if possible at all —
for a virus or Trojan horse to successfully attack a PDA. There
was practically nothing to attack, and almost no way to get
there. From a virus’s point of view, early PDAs were like a
hotel in the middle of nowhere with nothing fun to do.
PDAs are simpletons no longer. They are highly sophisticated
devices with rich operating systems and abundant connectivity.
Databases and programming languages and other sophisticated
applications reside on PDAs. These features are nice to have,
but this added functionality comes at a price: Increasingly,
PDAs are the likely target of malicious code such as viruses
and Trojan horses. While PDAs are not as sophisticated as
Windows PCs, they do have some exploitable features that are
not well protected.
Because of this increasing vulnerability, many owners of 
PDAs — as well as the Information Technology managers in
corporations — have asked several of the larger antivirus
companies to develop antivirus programs for PDAs.
Understanding Why Antivirus
Software Is Needed for PDAs
Most big-name PDAs presently available (HP, Sony, Toshiba,
Dell, and Blackberry) have operating systems as complex as
those found only in personal computers not so many years
ago. History has shown us that complexity in computing sys-
tems is one factor that leads to exploitation by those whose
moral values are (ahem) different from most persons’.
Another factor that leads to the existence of viruses is the
widespread adoption of new technology. Computer viruses
started showing up in force when PCs were starting to sell in

large numbers in the late 1980s. These days, PDAs with the
PalmOS and PocketPC operating systems are so popular
that exploits such as Trojan horses and viruses are an ever-
increasing threat to the mobile platform.
Synchronizing data with PCs
In most instances, PDAs are used as a convenient means of
accessing data that usually resides on PCs. Data created on a
PC can be copied to its companion PDA, and vice versa —
data created on a PDA can be copied to the PC. This process
of transferring data is commonly called synchronization — and
it’s potentially one way to use a PDA to attack a PC (or, for
that matter, to attack a PDA via a PC).
Surfing the ’Net from a PDA
Wireless technology (or Wi-Fi, as it’s fashionably known) has
enabled PDAs to act as mini-browsers to access the Internet.
Directly accessing the Internet exposes a PDA to the many
threats that exist there — Web sites with disguised hostile
content (meanies that attempt to harm you, your information,
or your computer), viruses, scams, and fraud (not to mention
those poorly written Web sites that clutter up the screen like
cyber-junkshops — but I digress).
Some of you may point out that few, if any, viruses in existence
today can directly harm PDAs. Good point — so far. It’s unlikely
to be true for long, though. I’ve argued many times that when-
ever a computing platform such as Windows becomes popular,
viruses and other threats are sure to follow. This has held true
throughout the Internet age and probably won’t change any
time soon. Throw a good party and it’s an equally good bet that
crashers and spoilers will find out — and try to ruin things.
Because I said so
This isn’t about royalties, kickbacks, or ego. I just happen to
think that the era of using PDAs without antivirus software is
drawing to a close.
Well, okay, I wouldn’t call you insane if you ran out and pur-
chased a PDA today and didn’t immediately load it up with
Chapter 11: Protecting PDAs from Viruses 183

antivirus software. But the tide will turn someday; perhaps
even as you read this there may have already been more
viruses that targeted PocketPC, Palm, Blackberry, or whatever
PDAs are in vogue. The more popular PDAs get with cus-
tomers, the more popular they’ll get with virus writers.
Installing and Configuring
Antivirus Software on PDAs
Installing software on PDAs is about as simple (or complicated,
depending on your point of view) as installing software on PCs.
The procedure is about the same, too. For the most part —
especially when you’re dealing with software produced by the
better companies — you actually install the PDA software on
your PC, and it moves over to the PDA during the synchroniza-
tion process: As files, e-mail, appointments, and tasks are put
in sync between the PC and the PDA, the process automati-
cally pushes the software over to the PDA (where the installa-
tion process is completed). Virtually all software installed on
PDAs is installed via synchronization.
Configuration of antivirus software on PDAs is far simpler than
it is on PCs. This can be done at installation time on the PC —
then the configuration is transmitted to the PDA through the
synchronization process.
Likewise, you can snag virus-signature updates via the PC and
transmit them to the PDA through synchronization. Or, the
PDA can perform the virus update directly if it has wireless
communications capability.
Protecting Your PDA
in Other Ways
There are plenty of things besides antivirus programs that
you can do to help protect your PDA and its data. Get ready
for several digital hygiene tips — PDA style! As with your PC,
the motto “trust no one” will keep your PDA and your informa-
tion safe. Read on.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
184

Turning off wireless auto-connect
Many PDAs are configured to automatically accept any incom-
ing connection request, whether it’s from someone you know
or not. If you leave your PDA configured like this, sooner or
later you’re bound to have someone you don’t know connect
to your PDA. Is that something you want?
If your PDA communicates using more than one wireless tech-
nology (let’s see, there’s 802.11, Bluetooth, and Infrared, as well
as GPRS and 1XRTT if you connect your PDA to the Internet
using a digital cellular service such as Cingular or T-Mobile),
you probably need to check the configuration for each.
Avoiding ad-hoc wireless
network connections
This applies primarily to 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connectivity. You can
make two different kinds of connections with Wi-Fi:
 Infrastructure connection: This is a wireless connection
between your PDA or laptop and an access point — a des-
ignated place built into the network and used for con-
necting individual devices to a larger network (including
the Internet). Such connections can be set up with
encryption and other safeguards that protect your com-
munication against eavesdroppers. These are the “good”
connections for that reason.
 Ad-hoc connection: This is a connection between one
PDA or laptop and another similar device — used for
communicating between the two devices. These connec-
tions are often simple and convenient but they have a
couple of problems:
• Encryption of ad-hoc connections is not always
available — and an unencrypted wireless connec-
tion is a recipe for vulnerability.
• Some PDAs are set up to automatically accept
incoming ad-hoc connection requests — which
amounts to opening the door to anybody.
Chapter 11: Protecting PDAs from Viruses 185

A word to the wise: Unless you rely on ad-hoc Wi-Fi connections
(and if you do, you may want to rethink that), turn them off.
Doing so saves your battery and keeps your information safe.
Disabling inbound file transfers
Your PDA may be set up to automatically permit someone on
the other end of a wireless connection to transmit files to your
PDA. Maybe it’s me, but I suggest you turn this capability off —
or change it to a “prompt” setting where each incoming file
transfer requires your permission. Otherwise, who knows
what someone might try to load onto your PDA.
Configuring passwords
PDAs are small and disappear easily into a pocket or bag —
and not always those of their owners. The last thing you want
is for some total stranger to get hold of your PDA and have
access to your sensitive data. A number of different protective
options are available:
 You can configure your PDA to require a password when-
ever it’s turned on — even if you turned it off only sec-
onds ago.
 You can configure your PDA to automatically turn off
and lock after a short period of time — no more than five
minutes. Okay, call me paranoid — but it’s your data, not
mine.
 If you routinely use sensitive information on your PDA,
you can configure it to periodically require a password
even while you’re using it — and in this case, I advise you
to use this option.
 Some PDAs require a password to be entered on a PC if
you try to synchronize files between the PDA and the PC.
You need to enable this feature unless you don’t care if
someone steals your PDA and can get to your data by
connecting it to their own PC.
Your PDA may have other password-protection capabilities.
Seriously consider each one in order to protect your data.
People I have spoken with about security often tell me they
would rather have convenience than security (sheesh). With
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance

PDAs (and also laptops and anything else that is easily lost or
stolen), the person who took your PDA will appreciate the
convenience you configured for yourself.
Using secure synchronization
settings
Synchronization is the process of transferring information
between a PDA and a laptop or desktop computer. You either
connect the PDA and the computer with a cable, or connect
them using an infrared or wireless connection. Synchronization
is usually initiated at the push of a button on either the PDA
or the computer, or synchronization can automatically take
place at regular intervals. Here are a couple of quick security
improvements:
 Check whether your PDA can synchronize with any PC,
or only with your PC. For maximum security, set your
PDA to synchronize only with your PC.
 Set up your PC so that only your PDA can synchronize
with it. You don’t want your computer getting friendly
with someone else’s PDA. That would make it way too
easy to snatch data out of your PC, or attempt to infect
your PC via a PDA.
Avoiding frivolous downloads
(or, beware of free programs)
These days, scores of software developers have written pro-
grams for PDAs and they’re giving ’em away free of charge
(the programs, that is). The developers do this to begin to
build a customer base and build loyalty. Their long-term
objective is to someday charge a fee for people to use their
software. I’m straying from my point.
I find it hard to believe that all the software available for PDAs
is fairly represented. It’s a lot likelier that at least a few pro-
grams currently available for PDAs are actually experiments
to test ways of exploiting PDAs or their users. At this stage of
the game, it’s hard to tell for sure. But as a general rule, stick
with the software brand names you know.
Chapter 11: Protecting PDAs from Viruses 187

Protecting and Securing
Your Computer
Say what? Aren’t we talking about PDAs?
Yes, that’s right. But remember that bad things usually travel
from one computer to another — and that includes from PDA
to computer, and computer to PDA. Yours. Mine. Anybody’s.
PDAs are designed to have regular contact with a computer.
Thus, if your computer is clean — free of cyber-infestations —
that will help keep your PDA clean.
So it stands to reason: If you run antivirus software on your
computer (along the lines I lay out in Part I and Part II), follow
all the safe computing practices found in Chapter 12, and sit
up straight, you’ll automatically keep your PDA safer, too.
(Well, okay, sitting up straight is just a good idea. Keeps you
alert. . . .)

If everyone with a home computer followed the guidance in
this chapter, then viruses, worms, and even spam would not
be issues today — at least not the tremendous problems
they’ve become. They got that way largely because most
home computers are neglected from a security point of view.

Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
190
Backing Up Your Data
Regularly
Bad things happen to all people, not just good people. One of
the bad things that happens is data loss — one important file,
several files, or everything can disappear into cyber-limbo.
Here are some common ways it happens:
 You can simply make some mistake — accidentally delet-
ing data that you can’t get back because you already
saved over the file, for instance.
 Something can go wrong with your program — an unusual
condition that results in your data being changed in a way
that you cannot undo.
 An interruption in electric power can cause your data to
become corrupted or unusable.
 A malfunction in Windows can cause your data to become
corrupted or unusable. Changing a Windows configuration
setting or installing a security patch can do this (this is
rare).
 The hardware in your computer can fail. Hard drives live
only so long, and they usually die suddenly and violently.
 If your data is on a laptop, remember that over 500,000
laptop computers are missing or stolen every year in the
United States alone. Where is yours, my dear Watson?
 A natural disaster such as a flood, fire, storm, or spilled
coffee can damage your computer and the data within it.
 A virus can erase your data or cause a malfunction that
results in your data becoming corrupted or unusable.
There are probably more bad things that can happen — these
are only a few.
Getting up to speed on backups
I realize — as I am writing this — that backing up data is a
computer industry term that I learned long ago, but that it’s
also a habit most folks haven’t gotten into yet. I explain it —
and answer the question Why do it? — here.

Backing up data simply means copying the data from wherever
it is to another place. For example, copying data from the hard
drive to a CD-ROM, tape backup, or to another computer’s hard
drive would constitute a viable backup.
Copying data from one place on the hard drive to another
place on the same hard drive would not be a good backup — if
something goes wrong with that one-and-only hard drive, you
lose both the original data and the backup data.
As computers began to spring up everywhere, businesses
quickly figured out that making backups — up-to-date copies
of data on other storage devices — could save much wailing
and gnashing of teeth later on. And behold, backups are now a
daily ritual in virtually every computer and business facility in
the world.
If your data is important to you, then you need to adopt this
regular ritual as well. The Grim Data-Reaper visits everyone
now and then, and you should be prepared.
Nothing like experiencing data loss spurs resolve never to fail
again — and to follow through by regularly backing up impor-
tant data. I have the scars to prove this point.
Backup tips and strategies
Before I get into how to do backups, I want to share with you
some important principles that make them effective. Get these
down pat, and your backup routine is more apt to be viable
and successful:
 Know where your important data resides: Whether you
create Web sites, write novels, trade stocks online, or run a
computer bookkeeping program, you need to know where
in your computer the important data lives (Remember:
By “data” I mean your software and your files). Get the
manual out if you have to. If you don’t know where your
data is, how do you expect to be able to back it up?
 Keep all your important data in one place in your com-
puter: The invention of the My Documents folder (the
folder where most or all the Microsoft programs save
files by default) goes a long way toward achieving this
consolidation.
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 191

 Regularly test your backups: You’ve got to make sure that
your backups are actually working — that your important
data is really being copied to your backup media, and
that you can actually read your backup media on another
computer. Believe me, it’s worth any amount of trouble to
test in advance if you can head off a sorry aftermath.
If you are going to survive a mishap, you’ll have to know how
to restore your data. You can practice now, or wait until you
have a real emergency and then practice under pressure. As
they say, “the best time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.”
I copy my precious data onto CD-ROM every few days. And
once every week or so, I take one of those CD-ROMs and walk
it over to another computer to make sure I can actually read
it. Why another computer? If my main computer “burns to the
ground” (a technical term meaning it stops working for more
than several hours), I’ll have to do this anyway.
If you use a special software package to perform backups,
then you need to be able to install that package on the com-
puter you will restore your data onto. Backup programs tend
to write to backup in a way that is unique from most other
backup programs.
Two things generally go wrong with backups:
 Sometimes a backup can be read only on the computer
that created it. This generally is the result of some con-
figuration error, and there’s no need to point out that
such a backup isn’t much good if that computer is toast.
 Sometimes the data you think is being written to the
backup media isn’t really being written to it at all. I
have heard of companies going out of business because
their backups weren’t working and nothing was on their
backup tapes. Learn from this, please.
Dealing with the Windows
backup program
Windows includes its own built-in backup program that you
can use to make copies of your data — but you have to con-
figure it if you want to use it. Coming right up. (If you’d like a
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
192

full tutorial on how to use Windows Backup, take a look at
Windows 95, 98, or 2000 Registry For Dummies; or Windows XP
Timesaving Techniques For Dummies.)
Here’s the quick-and-dirty way to run Windows Backup and
get started on the road to regular backups:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
Backup.
The Windows Backup welcome screen appears, show-
ing three tabs and three buttons.
2. Click the Backup Wizard button.
The Backup Wizard starts.
3. Follow the steps presented by the Backup wizard.
The wizard begins by asking you what data should be
backed up. (Hey, I told you that you need to know
where your data is, right? This is why. You also need
to specify where the backup should be written.)
Windows Backup likes to write backups to the floppy disk
drive, another hard drive, or a CD-ROM drive. Well, okay,
Windows Backup doesn’t prevent you from creating a backup
right on the same hard drive where your data is — but c’mon,
you know that’s a bad idea. A word to the wise: Take the hint
from Windows Backup.
Deciding on third-party 
backup programs
Sooner or later, if you get frustrated with Windows Backup,
you’ll want to take backups to the next level and invest in a
better backup program. There are some really good ones
available — for instance, these:
 Dantz Retrospect Backup is available from www.dantz.com;
around $130. Backs up to hard drives, CD/DVD drives, or
tape drives.
 NovaStor Novabackup is available from www.novastor.
com; around $80. Backs up to CD and DVD drives, SCSI/
EIDE tape drives, Iomega Zip/Jaz/Click drives, and hard
drives.
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 193

 NTI BackupNow is available from www.ntius.com;
around $80. Backs up to CD, DVD, hard drives, MO, Zip
and Jaz, and USB jump drives.
 Iomega Automatic Backup is available from www.iomega.
com; around $40. Backs up to Iomega Zip drives and Iomega
HDD drives. Drag-and-drop restore capability. 30-day free
trial available.
All of these products have a 30-day free trial and can be pur-
chased and downloaded online.
Copying files to a CD or DVD
If you have a CD or DVD burner on your computer, it can be a
convenient way to back up data, especially if you have a lot of
data to back up. Who wants to back up a big hard drive to 150
floppies? Not me.
You can use the CD/DVD-creation software that came with your
CD or DVD drive (or with your computer), or you can purchase
software. Probably the best-known software available is Easy
CD Creator 6 from Roxio.
Roxio has a nice wizard (shown in Figure 12-1) to help you
select which data you want copied to a CD — again, you must
know where your important data resides (see the section
“Backup tips and strategies,” earlier in this chapter).
You can also use your CD/DVD software to create a new drive
letter (for instance, drive D:) to identify the drive that you
intend to copy files to. When that’s done, you have a couple
of options:
 Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop files onto the
CD/DVD.
 Use other programs to save files to the CD/DVD by
choosing File➪Save As and then selecting the CD/DVD as
the destination.
When you’re done with the CD/DVD, right-click and select
Eject from the pop-up menu, and the disc-writing software will
complete the writing process and eject the disc.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
194

Figure 12-1: Roxio Easy CD Creator makes backups easy.
You can tell Windows Backup to write your backup data to
your CD or DVD drive. You can experiment with this if you’re
the adventurous type.
Copying files to a floppy disk
If your important data files are small (less than about 1.4MB
apiece), you can copy them to floppy disk. Follow this proce-
dure to format a floppy disk.
1. Put the floppy disk in the drive, write enabled.
2. Right-click on My Computer and select Explore. 
A Windows Explorer window opens.
The floppy disk drive (“A:”) should appear in the right
side of the Windows Explorer window.
3. Right-click on drive A: and select Format.
4. Change any options as appropriate (usually the
defaults are okay); then click Start.
Your PC will format the floppy drive.
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 195

5. When you’re all done, press Close, or remove the
formatted floppy disk, insert another floppy disk to
format, and click Start to begin formatting the next
floppy.
6. Rinse and repeat.
That’s it! You now have floppy disks that you can copy
files to.
I urge you to keep at least some of your backup data well away
from the original, preferably hundreds of miles or kilometers
away. In my business, we phrase it as keeping our backup data
in a different geographic region — far enough away that a natu-
ral disaster that happens here will not also happen there.
Installing Only Programs
Known to Be Safe
If you’re as attached to your data as many of us are, there are
two important facts that will probably influence your choice
of computer programs:
Not everyone in the world is nice.
That (alas) includes software makers, which leads to another
important conclusion:
Not all software can be trusted.
Well, you knew that. Viruses are software, after all, and you
certainly can’t trust them (to do anything good, that is). So
unless you really don’t care a hoot about your computer and
the data on it, the order of the day is to get reputable software
from reputable sources. Otherwise you’re taking your chances —
practicing a sort of (ahem) software promiscuity. And if bad
things happen then, is it any surprise?
Let me put this into some tips you can use:
 Don’t get software from spammers, no matter how good
the deal may seem to be. They deserve no encourage-
ment (in my opinion).
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
196

 Be very, very careful about software you procure over
the Internet, especially if it’s from a Web site that you
have not heard of.
The more valuable your data, the more stringent you need to
be about these principles. If you’re making your living with
your computer, for example, then you need to be very strict
about the data or programs you put into it. Why put your
livelihood at risk?
Saving Your License Information
Nearly every time you purchase software — whether you get
it from a retail store, have it shipped to you, or purchase a
downloadable version — you have to deal with license codes
(also called license keys) to make the product work.
Sometimes license keys come on little stickers in the packag-
ing, other times they are printed on the CD. They might be
e-mailed to you, found on a Web page, or even read to you
over the phone.
Regardless of how you get your license key and other activa-
tion information, you need to keep all this information for all
your programs in a very safe place. If you’re a hobbyist, it may
suffice to put hard copies in a folder in a desk drawer. But if
you’re making your living using your computer, you had
better make copies and keep them in a safety-deposit box or
other seriously safe place.
Securing Your Web Browser
Often the security settings in your Web browser are the only
defense that stands between you and potentially hostile Web
sites. If the settings are too lax, a black-hat Web site can down-
load potentially dangerous and harmful software into your
computer without your even knowing it.
You can access the Internet Explorer configuration settings to
view or change your security and privacy settings. You can
change configuration settings in two sections: the Internet
and other Zones settings, and the Privacy settings. The follow-
ing sections explain these settings in detail.
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 197

Internet security zone
The Internet security zone contains all of the security settings
that take effect when you visit Web sites on the Internet. Think
of the Internet security zone as your standard protection
mechanism to guard you from the dangers on the Internet.
To view the security settings in the Internet Explorer Internet
security zone, start Internet Explorer and then follow these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
The Internet Options dialog box appears, which is a
multi-tabbed dialog box.
2. Click the Security tab.
You see the dialog box shown in Figure 12-2, complete
with the following four zones:
• Internet zone: This controls IE’s actions when
you visit Web sites on the Internet.
• Local Intranet zone: This zone controls IE’s
behavior when you visit internal organization
sites. (Normally you see this setting used only
in organizations with their own internal Web
servers.)
• Trusted Sites zone: Use this zone setting to
define which Web sites on the Internet you con-
sider friendly and safe.
• Restricted Sites zone: This zone lists sites that
are not trusted at all.
3. Click the Internet icon to configure settings for the
Internet zone.
Now, I’m not always a lover of defaults, but I am pretty
fond of ’em in this context. I think you should have the
slider set to Medium or High, but not Medium-Low or
Low. Otherwise your browser will trust all Internet sites
far more than it should and permit malicious down-
loads and plug-ins to be installed and run. If you don’t
see a slider, then your settings have been customized.
You can click the Default Level button to revert to
default settings and then select Medium or High.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
198

Figure 12-2: The Security tab allows you to change the security settings in IE.
If you want to tinker with the settings yourself, click the
Custom Level button. The Security Settings dialog box gives
you access to all the individual settings you can tinker with in
the Internet Explorer Internet security zone. The precise
meaning of all these settings is beyond the scope of this book.
If you’re baffled by what you see, just click the Cancel button.
Privacy settings
Starting with Internet Explorer Version 6, you have additional
control over how your browser handles cookies. If you have IE
Version 5.5 or older, then you won’t be able to do much with
cookie configuration, other than simply to accept all cookies or
block all cookies. (I’m assuming you have IE Version 6, which
is freely available from Microsoft at www.microsoft.com/ie.)
To adjust your privacy settings in IE, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options (if the Internet
Options dialog box isn’t already open).
2. Click the Privacy tab.
The Privacy tab of the Internet Options dialog box is
shown in Figure 12-3. If you have default settings set,
you see a slider on the left side of the window.
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 199

Figure 12-3: Adjusting Internet Explorer to guard your privacy.
I recommend setting the value of the slider to Medium
or higher. This setting protects your privacy by allow-
ing only cookies using your personally identifiable
information with your consent.
The higher you set the slider, the more trouble you’ll have with
Web sites that use cookies. Adjust the setting to Block All
Cookies and you can forget about doing any online banking,
trading, or shopping on the Internet.
If you read the settings that are associated with each security
level, you’ll soon see that there are many kinds of cookies that
have different meanings and uses. You almost have to be a
cyber-lawyer to understand what this all means. This is
explained in more detail in Internet Privacy For Dummies, if
you want to be really informed on this complicated topic.
If you don’t see a slider, then your privacy settings have been
customized. If you like, you can click the Default button, then
set the slider to Medium or higher.
If you want to customize your privacy settings, click the
Advanced button to display the Advanced Privacy Settings
dialog box. You have to hang on for this ride. Here, you can
change the way cookies are handled at the security level
you’re currently looking at.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
200

In Internet Explorer Version 6, you can also control from
which sites you will always accept (or always block) cookies.
On the Privacy tab of the Internet Options dialog box, click
the Edit button near the bottom of the window. The Per Site
Privacy Actions dialog box opens (as shown in Figure 12-4).
That’s the box that gives you say-so over which Web sites get
to give you cookies — and which ones don’t. To specify either,
you just type in the URL of the Web site you want to explicitly
block or allow in the Address of Web Site field, then press the
Block or Allow button.
Figure 12-4: IE permits you to block cookies from specific Web sites.
Keeping Alternate E-Mail
Accounts
It’s more or less inevitable: Over a period of time, many organ-
izations are going to collect your e-mail address. And, sooner
or later, after signing up for something and providing your
e-mail address to this Web site or that Web site, your e-mail
address is going to leak to or be purchased by a mass mailing
operator (a nice term for a spammer).
I suggest you get another e-mail account. Use one for corre-
sponding with friends and colleagues, and use another for
“commercial” purposes where you have to share an e-mail
address with a corporation or other organization. 
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 201

Surfing the Web Safely
I’m sure that I sound like your mother when I tell you to surf
wisely. As soon as you start to venture off the Internet’s main
street into the dimly-lit back alleys, especially in the red-light
district, you’ll find a different class of Web-site operator who
resorts to dirty tricks like attempting to hijack your browser’s
configuration settings or burying you in pop-up windows that
won’t go away until you reboot.
Unless you do have to visit a potpourri of Web sites for
(ahem) “research” purposes, I suggest you stay on the paved
and well-lit parts of the Internet, where the Web sites have a
somewhat better reputation and you’re less likely to get into
trouble. Even on the Internet, you’ve got to stay in the nicer
and more familiar parts of town. It’s especially in the cheesy
parts of the Internet where your security and privacy settings
work hard to protect you.
Sharing Personal Information
Carefully
You need to be careful about sharing personal information
about yourself online. By “personal information” I mean things
like your name, date of birth, tax identification number, and
bank and credit card numbers.
While many sites keep very close tabs on this personal infor-
mation, other sites don’t do such a hot job of protecting your
information. And one of the other problems is that some of the
unscrupulous Web site operators actually sell or give away
your private information to others — often (you guessed it)
to spammers.
Unless you have no identity, you should seriously consider
picking up a copy of Preventing Identity Theft For Dummies.
And make sure you only purchase it from a truly legitimate
Web site, or find it at a bookstore near you.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
202

Adding Parental Internet
Blockers
These blockers prevent persons from visiting (deliberately
or otherwise) Web sites containing particular content, such
as porn, violence, hatred, casino gaming, and Barry Manilow.
(Kidding there. I think.)
The main purpose of these products is to protect children from
accidentally or deliberately viewing content intended only for
adults. They also prevent you from accidentally bumping into
unpleasant sites: Try misspelling a Web site’s name and see
where it takes you. On second thought, don’t try it.
Avoiding Spam
Spam is the common name used to describe junk e-mail, or
unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE). Spam is, at the same
time, big business for those who create and distribute it and a
growing nuisance for its recipients.
By being careful how and where you share your e-mail
address, you can help to keep your e-mail address away from
spammers’ mailing lists. See the earlier section in this chapter,
titled “Sharing Personal Information Carefully,” for informa-
tion about the types of information to be leery of giving away.
On the other side of the same coin, you can use a spam
blocker to help eliminate the spam you already receive. If
you’re serious about keeping your e-mail address out of the
hands of spammers, or if you’re already drowning in a sea of
spam, get hold of Fighting Spam For Dummies. (John and
Margaret, you owe me one.)
Blocking Spyware
Spyware is a wide-reaching term that describes software used
to monitor your Internet usage patterns, as well as software
that can attempt to change your Internet browser configura-
tion, or even record keystrokes (Virginia, the hackers want
your bank account and other online passwords).
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 203

Most spyware is not malicious in the same way that viruses
are, and spyware works differently than viruses do. For this
reason, antivirus products do little, if anything, to protect you
from spyware. Also, spyware is more of a privacy issue than
it’s a security issue.
Antispyware software is used to prevent and/or remove spy-
ware from your computer. Turn to Chapter 10 to take an in-
depth look at antispyware tools.
Using Public Computers
Public libraries, Internet cafes, and other customer-serving
establishments have their own computers that customers
may use to access the Internet. Are these computers safe for
you to use?
Tales abound of public-access computers infected with
viruses, spyware, and even key loggers, many deliberately
planted there in order to elicit information from unsuspecting
users. I recall specifically in 2004 a case where a person was
arrested for installing a key logger program on a computer in
a well-known copy services store in order to record users’
bank account numbers and passwords. This is technology
gone awry.
Frequently, these computers are configured in a protected
manner, so that users can only use a Web browser and noth-
ing else. But, often, you can’t even view the browser’s security
settings, much less change them. So how can you tell if one of
these computers is safe? What kinds of things are safe to do
on these computers? This section gives you the goods.
Scanning public computers 
for viruses
In most cases you won’t be able to access a public computer’s
antivirus program to see if its signatures are up to date or to
perform a scan. However, you can perform one of those online
scans that I describe in Chapter 6.
Part III: Maintaining Your Vigilance 
204

However, if you do find a virus, you may not be able to remove
it (many of the online scanning programs only detect — but
do not remove — viruses they may find). Better find another
computer, but do the establishment (and your fellow cus-
tomers) a favor and tell them that you have good reason to
believe one of their computers has a virus. You may even be
decorated as an expert and a hero! Well, if not, you should still
feel good after doing your good deed for the day.
Scanning public computers
for spyware
It’s a good idea to scan a public computer for spyware before
you use it. If you use a public-access computer to log into a
Web site, particularly one containing financial or personal
information (such as a bank), are you willing to bet that the
computer is free of spyware?
As of this moment, I’m not aware of online spyware scanners,
but there may be one or more available by the time you read
this. You can visit my Web site at www.computervirusesbook.
com or browse the major antivirus company Web sites to see
what’s available. It’s also possible that one of the current online
virus scanners will also scan for spyware. This is a feature that
the big antivirus companies will adopt very soon.
Staying clean and cleaning up
Some banking and other Web sites containing your personal
information permit you to specify whether you’re using a
public-access computer. I like to think that in such cases those
Web sites prevent your personal information from lingering on
the computer for some enterprising busybody to find.
But there are some other things you want to do if you’re able.
Follow these steps to erase at least some of your tracks:
1. In Internet Explorer, choose Tools➪Internet Options.
The Internet Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the General tab (if it’s not already in view).
Chapter 12: Incorporating Safe Computing Practices 205

3. Click the Delete Cookies button.
Click OK if you get an additional dialog box that asks if
you want to continue.
4. Click the Delete Files button.
5. In the Delete Files dialog box that appears, select the
Delete All Offline Content option; then click OK.
6. Click the Clear History button.
These steps will cover most of your tracks on the computer
from prying eyes. The process removes all your cookies, any
temporary copies of Web pages you viewed, and the record of
the sites you visited. If, however, you are not able to access
Internet Options in Internet Explorer, you might consider
holding off doing your really personal work until you can get
back to your computer.

Part IV
Looking at
Viruses under
the Microscope

In this part . . .
V
iruses don’t attack computers. People attack com-
puters. So what is it about the people who write
viruses? Their motives vary: Some write viruses because
they want to hurt people, as many people as possible.
Others want to embarrass Microsoft and teach them a
lesson for building such vulnerable software. Some are
getting even with a society that cast them aside.
As if the world were bad enough with viruses, there are
worms to deal with. Worms are like viruses — they spread
from computer to computer and can damage computer
software and data. But unlike viruses, which require
human intervention to spread, worms can jump from com-
puter to computer all on their own.
Trojan horses are dirty tricks, usually sent in e-mail. They
purport to be something they are not, long enough to con-
vince their would-be victims that they should double click
the ﬁles attached to mail messages.
Then there are the plain old scams, now sent by e-mail.
From get-rich-quick schemes to discount prescription

riminal justice investigations often use profiling (building
a composite of a serial killer by the actions the killer
takes) as the sole means of figuring out what the killer’s next
action may be and who the killer is. Along those same lines,
this chapter seeks to bring you into the mind of virus writers
and to show you their chosen weapons: viruses.
This chapter brings you up close and personal with viruses,
how they got started, and a little bit on how they work. And
you’ll also see inside the heads of the people who delight in
creating and releasing viruses into the world.
Invasion of the Computer Viruses
Simply stated, a computer virus is a computer program written
by a person (not always, but usually, a jerk) who designed it
to spread to as many computers as possible.

Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
210
This definition seems simple enough, but indulge me. I’d like
to zero in a bit further, to clarify some issues and to dispel
some misunderstandings:
 Computer program: A virus is nothing more than a set of
instructions, written in a high-level programming lan-
guage, such as Visual Basic, C, C++, or Java, translated
into “native” instructions (a long list of ones and zeros)
that are used by the computer’s CPU.
 Written: It’s worth repeating: Viruses don’t just happen;
people write them deliberately. Check out the section
titled “The People Who Write Viruses,” later in this chap-
ter, for more information about why people write viruses.
 Spread: This is the essential characteristic of viruses.
They are designed to be mobile — to move from com-
puter to computer, either under their own accord, or as a
“hitchhiker,” by attaching themselves to another com-
puter program and then going wherever that computer
program goes.
Most viruses also have a payload, the instructions that the
virus performs in addition to its characteristic of spreading
from computer to computer. Consider the payload as the virus’s
bonus material. The payload is usually triggered by some
event, such as a particular date, a particular time, or a double-
click that opens a particular file. The payload can range in
behavior — from displaying silly messages on-screen to delet-
ing important files, communicating your personal information
to an unknown third party, or sending embarrassing e-mail
messages in the name of the computer’s rightful user (or,
often, some other innocent party that the virus has recently
visited, or one found in the victim’s e-mail address book).
Trojan horses and worms share many similar characteristics
with viruses, although they use slightly different ways to get
from here to there. I explain them fully in Chapter 14.
A long time ago in hobby
rooms far, far away. . . .
In the early 1980s, several models of personal computers
were available. One could go into a store and purchase an

Atari 800, a Tandy TRS-80 (fondly known as the “Trash 80”
among the Rubik’s Cube generation of computer users), a
Texas Instruments TI-99/4, a Commodore 64, or an Apple II.
For the first time, computer hobbyists and other curious
types could purchase a fully functioning computer system for
a relatively modest price.
People were writing and trading programs like crazy, giving
one another copies of their programs, pictures, and data files,
using whatever portable storage medium their brand of com-
puter used. (The Trash-80 used cassette tapes; others used
floppy disks that you could actually flop.) Computer hobby-
ists and tinkerers were exchanging computer files like school
children share colds. Everyone threw caution to the wind.
In the mid-1980s, the most popular personal computer was the
IBM PC. The first model had no hard drive — only one (or two!)
floppy disk drives. There were soon more IBM PCs — and
Chapter 13: Viruses and the Losers Who Write Them 211
Brain, the first virus
In Pakistan, Basit Farooq Alvi and
Amjad Farooq Alvi ran a computer
store called Brain Computer Services.
They soon discovered that a floppy
disk contained computer instructions
that were executed when the com-
puter was first turned on. Basit and
Amjad used this knowledge for their
own purposes and created computer
instructions that would change the
label of floppy disks in the computer
to (C)Brain. The instructions would
make a copy of themselves onto
other floppy disks that were inserted
into the floppy-disk drive.
Brain did nothing other than change
a floppy’s label and copy itself to
other floppies, but that was sufficient
to cause trouble. People continued to
do what they had been doing for a
few years: exchanging computer pro-
grams and files using nearly the only
available means — circulating them
on floppy disks. At first, no one noticed
that some of these floppies had a
stowaway on board, an unwanted
passenger with a single — although
relatively benign — purpose.
In 1987, users at the University of
Delaware began noticing that the
labels on some of their floppy disks
were mysteriously being changed to
(C)Brain. The Brain virus had
made its way from central Asia to
North America — and doubtless, to
the other continents of the world.

soon, the clones, like Compaq and others — than all the other
popular home computers combined. The first — and most
enduring — monoculture was born. The computers that many
of us use today are descendants of these legendary beings.
Early viruses get aggressive
Soon after Brain (the first virus), other viruses appeared, such
as Jerusalem, Miami, Alameda, Cascade, and Lehigh. These
viruses were small sets of computer instructions that covertly
implanted themselves somewhere on a floppy disk and could
copy themselves from disk to disk.
But unlike Brain, some of these viruses were more harmful.
The Jerusalem virus would delete any programs that a person
ran on any Friday the 13th. It was named Jerusalem because it
was first detected at Hebrew University in Israel and was
thought to have originated there.
The Alameda virus would copy itself when the computer user
pressed Ctrl+Alt+Del (the sequence used in those days to
restart the computer). Some descendents (known as “vari-
ants”) of the Alameda virus on newer PCs with hard drives
would erase the contents of the hard drive after the virus had
been activated a set number of times.
The Cascade virus had a disrupting, but also humorous, effect.
When the virus was activated, the characters on-screen would
“fall,” piling up in a heap at the bottom of the screen. The
result looked funny to just about anybody but the victim (that
aspect of prank viruses hasn’t changed).
Of course, back in The Old Days™ before Windows, IBM-
compatible PCs ran DOS, a “character” environment that
could display little more than alphanumeric characters;
graphics were crude and mostly non-existent. There were no
“windows,” no mouse, no World Wide Web, and (as far as
most PC users were concerned) no Internet connections. But
even then, some people got their kicks from writing programs
that worked like biological viruses. The result (shown in
Figure 13-1) — even if it doesn’t always look like a biological
virus — has become as familiar as the common cold.

How Viruses Have Evolved
with the Times
Viruses are more sophisticated since they started gaining wide
notoriety in the 1980s. When Norton AntiVirus and other tools
were successful at detecting and removing viruses from com-
puters, the struggle was on: The people who wrote viruses
knew they had to stay one step ahead; they developed ways
to make their viruses more difficult to detect.
Chapter 13: Viruses and the Losers Who Write Them 213
Encrypted viruses (what a Concept)
The Concept virus was the first
encrypted virus that tried to hide by
storing itself in encrypted form —
scrambled so it would not be easily
recognized by an antivirus program.
Each time Concept was transmit-
ted to another computer, it was re-
encrypted using a new encryption
key (the piece of code that later
unscrambles the program). Result:
Its patterns in the computer changed
every time it made a new con-
quest. This made Concept especialy
difficult — at first — for antivirus
tools to recognize.

No need to go into niggling detail about the various types of
viruses here (unless you want to start a second career writing
some of your own — in which case, too bad). But the next sec-
tions profile some general ways the little monsters work — in
case you want to decide for yourself whether antivirus tools
are really worth the money.
How Early Viruses Spread from
Computer to Computer
In the mid-to-late 1980s, data was most often transferred from
computer to computer by using floppy disks and so-called bul-
letin board systems (BBSs), managed online locations that
were the forerunners of today’s Web sites.
Stowing away on floppy disks
Even without using the Internet, people in offices where PCs
were used traded and circulated programs, documents, and
spreadsheets — not to mention jokes, games, filthy pictures,
and so forth. The standard method was sneakernet — walking
up to another person and handing over a floppy disk.
In those early days, viruses spread relatively quickly. Because
few people had antivirus programs, there was little to stop a
virus from spreading from computer to computer. Like hobos
on trains and stowaways on ships, viruses were unwelcome —
and mostly unnoticed — passengers that rode for free and left
their mark in some way.
Sneaking in via BBSs
Before the World Wide Web, BBSs were the precursors to 
the way we use the Internet these days. Reached via dial-up
modems, BBSs contained a variety of features such as limited
e-mail (you could only send messages to other users of that
particular BBS), file uploading and downloading, games, and
well, bulletin boards (where you could stick any messages you
wanted seen by other BBS users), and so forth.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
214

Modem technology was primitive, with speeds far slower than
today’s modems. Common modem speeds were 1200, 2400,
and 4800 kilobits per second — any faster and the rawhide
thongs would break (just kidding) — a mere fraction of the
56000 bits per second (56 kbps) available now. But communi-
cation with a BBS consisted of characters only: words, num-
bers, and punctuation — no graphics. Of course, that also
meant no time was wasted loading banner ads, distracting ani-
mations, or lame design (any of which can show up on today’s
Web sites, so the slower modems weren’t all that bad).
At the time, going online wasn’t all that common, so BBSs
attracted users by amassing a rich collection of programs
and files — and making those available for download. Often
a BBS would award download privileges only to users who
had uploaded a certain minimum amount of programs and
data, thereby enriching the BBS’s collection of goodies.
Those file-upload-and-download areas became a big free
ride for viruses.
Chapter 13: Viruses and the Losers Who Write Them 215
The bug stops here (in the junkyard)
Sometimes obsolescence stops a
virus from spreading by stranding it
on outmoded equipment or media.
For example, I no longer have a com-
puter with a 51⁄4-inch floppy-disk drive
(similar to today’s 31⁄2-inch floppy
drives, except that the 51⁄4-inch disks
really were floppy — and there were
also 8-inch floppy disks that were
really fragile), though I still have a
collection of these floppies that con-
tain a variety of programs and files.
Some are nearly antique — old
(some original) PC-DOS 1.0 and MS-
DOS 1.0 & 2.0 boot disks, a Visicalc
program disk, and Word 1.0 (made in
the days when a single 360K floppy
disk could contain not only DOS, but
also Microsoft Word — and still have
room for some documents!). Other
floppies contain old documents of
mine — and for all I know, one or
more of them might contain a virus.
But I’ll probably never know. I don’t
have a drive that can read them,
haven’t seen such drives in computer
stores in a long time, and don’t
want to do any favors for those 
now-retired virus writers. After all,
their creations can only be passed
around if the viruses’ hiding places
can still be accessed. That’s one
reason they try to infest the newest
stuff — and a great reason to be
really careful about buying used
computer equipment.

Most BBSs had a policy of forbidding the uploading and down-
loading of commercial software, but it was difficult to police,
and BBS operators frequently looked the other way. A number
of BBSs did contain illegal copies of commercial software; rela-
tively few perpetrators were caught and prosecuted. But what
better lure than something-for-nothing — and hey, how about
a little something extra? Some of those illegal copies contained
(you guessed it) viruses. But I disgress.
My point is that viruses would attach themselves to computer
programs on a user’s system, and if that user uploaded the
infected program to a BBS, then anyone who later down-
loaded and ran that program would subsequently become
infected.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
216
People share stuff
By our very nature, people love to
share things. In ancient times, people
shared stories, jokes, and other infor-
mation by word of mouth — and we
still do. Native Americans used smoke
signals, and early Americans used
telegraphs and telegrams to spread
funny jokes (surely you don’t think
it was all serious business). Later,
when copiers became commonplace
in workplaces; people frequently
copied jokes, stories, and funny pic-
tures to circulate among their friends
and colleagues. People would hand
or mail them around among them-
selves. Companies knew that this
eroded productivity and added to
copying costs, but people are people,
and a reasonable level of this activity
was (and is) permitted — or at least
not squashed immediately.
As technology marched on, people
began using FAX machines and then
their computers to spread the jokes,
lists, and funny pictures. Some pro-
grammers began to write programs
that performed tricks or displayed
funny pictures on computers, and
people copied these and circulated
them via floppy disk — and I proba-
bly have a few in my dusty collection
of floppies. One that I remember
would briefly display a picture of a
hideous one-eyed monster after about
40 keystrokes or so, but otherwise
was harmless. Things like this were
modern-day practical jokes and gags.
Today, people use e-mail to circulate
funny and interesting items. And you
know what? Viruses have advanced
with the times and now can spread
by e-mail. You can see more about
that in this chapter and throughout
this book.

As a result, viruses spread faster and over greater distances
than they could with floppy disks. Why should an ambitious
virus wait for a person to infect one other person at a time in
real-world offices (or between friends and among computer-
hobbyist club members) when the Internet made thousands of
potential hosts available? Yum yum.
The People Who Write Viruses
Sometimes I think that it helps to understand a little bit more
about the people who perpetrate crimes, in order to be able
to avoid being a victim of those crimes. Others of you may
just have a morbid curiosity about those who like to hurt
other people. Either way, you’ll learn a little more about the
people who construct the malicious programs that cause bil-
lions of dollars of damage each year.
Why they write ’em
The actual crime of writing and distributing viruses is a crime
of anonymity: The perpetrators usually carry out their crimes
anonymously, from the safety of their rooms. They expect
never to meet their victims face to face — in fact, they rarely
know who their victims are.
Virus writers are, sociologically, not much different from tag-
gers who spray cryptic symbols on walls, or even the “unoffi-
cial” graffiti artists: they feel (or say they feel) justified in
doing their work, and have a wanton disregard for the dignity
and property of others. They feel not mere justification, but
pride in what they do.
There is an entire counterculture of virus writers, hackers,
crackers, and others who compete and try to outdo one
another to gain status and respect amongst themselves.
Hackers gather at conventions such as the annual Defcon in
Las Vegas. They have “capture the flag” contests — some well
publicized, others not. They have clubs with weird names like
Cult of the Dead Cow, Cyber Lords, and United Loan Gunmen.
Hackers themselves take on equally interesting names like
Rain Forest Puppy, Mafiaboy, Sir Dystic, and TeaBag. They
Chapter 13: Viruses and the Losers Who Write Them 217

even have a couple of magazines, 2600 Magazine and Phrack.
You can sometimes find 2600 Magazine in Borders and other
large bookstores.
While I personally have little respect for these persons and
their values, I do have a healthy respect for the damage that
they can inflict on those who do not know how to protect
themselves.
Hacker social values (sort of)
I’m not a sociologist or a specialist in human personalities,
but I can venture a few guesses about the values and motives
of virus writers and those who help get viruses moving into
high gear:
 Not much respect for authority: There’s a difference
between respect for high-end hacking skills and respect
for social institutions; in effect, virus writers seem to
respect only themselves. In practice, this amounts to an
utter and complete disregard for laws that define their
activities as unlawful. Breaking the law becomes a way to
rack up bad-boy status. (I use that “bad-boy” term delib-
erately because most such hackers are males, and hack-
ing is a machismo, alpha-male activity.)
 Little respect for the property of others: An apparent
wanton disregard for the information systems that their
viruses harm or destroy is shared by virus writers.
There’s nothing virtual about the real-world effects of
cyber-vandalism, however; it’s still vandalism.
 Little regard for the rights of other people: Take, for
openers, the right to be left in peace. Virus writers seem
willing to run roughshod over anyone else to flout
authority and show off their skills, usually by destroying
the property of others. If they need to satiate a glutton-
ous desire to witness the wake of the destruction they
visit on others’ property, it boils down to the ultimate in
selfishness — the antithesis of the Golden Rule. 
I contend, then, that virus writers lack the basic social and
moral values and the “well-formed consciousness” that are
the hallmarks of civilized modern societies. Adrift from the
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
218

civilizations that surrounded them, virus writers seek atten-
tion not for productive accomplishments, but for sociopathic,
destructive gestures.
In other words, virus writers are (not to put too fine a point
on it) a plague. A bunch of losers who write viruses to assert
twisted feelings of self-styled superiority over others — while
hiding behind anonymity. Some of them even know it — and
still won’t stop. What remains is for the rest of us to protect
ourselves, which brings us to. . . .
The Origins of Antivirus Tools
In 1991, Symantec released the first version of Norton AntiVirus.
Norton was a popular brand name among computer techno-
philes from the well-known and successful Norton Utilities
program. Programs like Norton AntiVirus are designed to find
and eliminate viruses from a computer, usually with three
goals in mind:
 Make the virus stop doing harm to the computer it has
infected
 Stop the spread of the virus
 Limit any further harm the virus can do
Early antivirus programs had a database that contained infor-
mation about each known virus. Chiefly, the database would
contain some of the characters that were found in each known
virus. Then, as the antivirus program scanned files on the
computer, it would simply compare the information in the
scanned files with the information about each known virus.
When there was a match, the antivirus program had found a
virus.
Norton VirusScan was the first antivirus program available. It
contained signatures for only several dozen viruses. In those
days (reckoned by our sundials and hourglasses) it was suffi-
cient to update signatures every few months. These early pro-
grams had no “real-time” detection mechanism; instead, they
could only scan a computer to look for viruses that were
already present on the computer.

Trojan Horses, Worms,
Spam, and Hoaxes
In This Chapter
 Trojan horses: misleading tricks
 Phishing scams: skilled imposters
 Worms: viruses on autopilot
 Hostile Web sites: caution — contains poison
 SPAM and viruses: evildoers team up
 Scams and fraud
 Hoaxes: preying on gullibility
T
o add insult to injury, viruses are not the only bad things
that can happen to you and your computer. The bad guys
have cooked up several other forms of malice for us:
 Worms: These are like viruses in that they spread from
computer to computer, wreaking havoc on everything
they touch. But unlike viruses, which must attach them-
selves to another file or program in order to be trans-
ported, a worm has its own “propulsion system” built
right in. Worms spread amazingly fast through the
Internet by scanning for computers that have particular
vulnerabilities.
 Trojan horses: These are destructive programs that mas-
querade as benign programs. Frequently, Trojan horses
arrive in e-mail, where the text in the e-mail message
says, for example, “Your e-card has arrived, click here to
open.” There may, in fact, be an e-card, but to be a Trojan
horse the program will also have a destructive character-
istic, such as deleting files or corrupting directories.

Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
222
 Phishing scams: These are sometimes-clever attempts to
trick us into giving private information to official-looking
(but bogus) Web sites.
 Hostile Web sites: Sometimes these are harmless-looking
sites that actually attempt to alter our Web browsers and
plant viruses or spyware in our computers.
 Internet versions of old scams: These are plain old
scams of every kind — promising everything from body-
part enhancement to instant wealth — now marketed
(and, sadly, sold) online.
 Hoaxes: These are schemes designed to prey on our
trusting nature, either by scaring us with fake virus warn-
ings or tricking us into sending money, information, or
e-mail access to the black hats.
Who can you trust anymore? Well, for openers, you can trust
me to help you navigate through the darker waters of the
Internet that sometimes seem not so far from our front doors.
By describing these threats and by showing you a few exam-
ples, I hope to give you a leg up on recognizing this filth for
what it is — and reliably avoiding it altogether.
Finally — if you have a good antispam program, most (if not
all) of this will be filtered out of your incoming e-mail. Having
basic protective tools such as antivirus, antispam, and firewall
capabilities is much like having The Club: It goes a long way to
help keep your car from being stolen, but it’s still a good idea
to lock your car — and to know how car thieves ply their trade.
Trojan Horses: Misleading Tricks
Okay, sure, Greek mythology glazed some of us over in school,
so we missed how Trojan applied to the word horse — and
now people are talking about Trojan horses in their computers?
What gives? (For a quick refresher, see the upcoming sidebar
on “The original Trojan Horse.” It will be on the exam.)
Identifying a Trojan horse
Trojan horses often arrive as e-mail messages that purport to
be something that they are not. They include one or more

attached programs that perform some sort of covert and/or
destructive act on the information in your computer.
The text portion of a Trojan horse usually contains some sort
of message intended to entice the recipient (you) into opening
the attachment (the ugly surprise).
Antivirus programs are designed to catch Trojan horses, but
knowing that should not lull you into a false sense of security;
complacency kills computers. You could be one of the truly
unfortunate — early recipients of a brand new Trojan horse
that your antivirus program is not yet aware of.
Chapter 14: Trojan Horses, Worms, Spam, and Hoaxes 223
Practicing safe hex
No, it doesn’t involve witches’ incan-
tations (though some people see
hexadecimal code as magic). It’s just
a geeky way of saying that you need
to use your computer safely and
responsibly, even if you already have
some defensive capabilities such as
antivirus programs. As it happens,
some safe-hex practices can also
help you differentiate a Trojan horse
from a legitimate message. Here’s a
checklist of basic pointers:
 Never open mail messages from
people you don’t know, espe-
cially when the subject lines are
unfamiliar to you.
 Never open mail messages from
people you do know when
the message’s subject line is
strange, garbled, or nonsensical
in an unfunny way.
 If you have received a message
from someone and you’re not
sure whether the message is
legitimate or not, you should verify
the validity of the message first,
before you open its contents.
 Slow down a little. People in a
hurry or under pressure make
poor judgment calls. If you’re
going through your e-mail too
quickly, you’re more apt to open
the contents — which can easily
be a malicious attachment to a
sneaky message — before you
have time to think about what
you’re doing. Such a seemingly
minor mistake can have disas-
trous consequences.
 Never open e-mail messages
that have no sender listed in the
“From:” field. For that matter, mes-
sages with no subject line are
pretty suspicious too. If you get
one of those from someone you
know, trash it with out opening it,
and e-mail your friend to ask for a
re-send with something in the
subject line. If your friend didn’t
send the original message, that
will become clear right away.

Those persons who create Trojan horse mail messages have
gotten increasingly clever, making it more difficult than ever
to distinguish legitimate messages from Trojan horses. In 2003,
mail messages containing viruses or Trojan horses contained
subject lines such as “Hi,” “Hello,” and other common and
legitimate-sounding subjects. And, oftentimes these messages
will claim to have been sent from people you do actually know.
How Trojan horses function
Trojan horses, for all the damage they can cause, are really
very simple. On the surface, they claim to be something entic-
ing to the recipient, so enticing that the recipient will put cau-
tion aside and proceed to open the message’s attached file (if,
for example, it arrived in e-mail).
When Trojan horse creators build their wares, they know that
only a small percentage of recipients will open the message’s
attachments. It’s vitally important that you not be in the per-
centage of suckers who fall for these dirty tricks.
Let me portray for you how a typical Trojan horse program
works:
1. An unsuspecting e-mail recipient (not a reader of
this book) is enticed by the text of a message.
The sucker, er, I mean recipient is so much enamored
that he or she opens the attachment, which is a mali-
cious computer program.
2. The malicious program starts running.
If the recipient’s computer is running certain brands of
firewall or antivirus software, the malicious program
may attempt to deactivate them, making the computer
vulnerable to other types of attacks.
3. The recipient, entertained by the “benign” side and
unaware of the devious side of this Jeckyll-and-Hyde
fiend, may send a copy of the program to his or her
acquaintances, thereby perpetuating the little
menace.
4. On and on it goes, getting a little nudge from each
new sucker, er, recipient that double-clicks the
attachment.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
224

Eventually, the Trojan horse will be caught by the antivirus
companies’ traps, enabling the engineers there to dissect the
program and create a new signature for it. When they put the
signature in their newest signature file, everyone who subse-
quently downloads the signature file will be protected from
that particular Trojan horse.
You know me . . . sure you do . . .
Many Trojan horses are like strangers who arrive disguised as
utility workers, law enforcement, or others — who are invited
into people’s homes. The clever intruder may have even made
reference to people the victim knows — because the stranger
may have been inside the home(s) of the victim’s friend(s)
recently. Once inside, they rummage through the victim’s
belongings, perhaps breaking or moving things around.
This is an official notice . . . sure it is . . .
Here is an interesting case of a Trojan horse. In this example,
the mail message claims to be a security update from Microsoft.
As Figure 14-1 shows, it looks quite genuine, but it’s a fake
through and through. A program with an official-sounding
name, Q379218.EXE, is attached to this message. Instructions
in the message tell the recipient that the attachment is a secu-
rity update that should be run in order to protect your com-
puter from malicious code. Ironic, isn’t it?
Figure 14-1: Microsoft update? Think again. . . . 
Chapter 14: Trojan Horses, Worms, Spam, and Hoaxes 225

In truth, this Trojan horse attempts to disable antivirus pro-
grams on the victim’s computer, making it vulnerable to later
attack.
My own computer had three different defenses for this virus:
1. Microsoft Outlook blocks attachments that contain
program files.
So even if I did not have antivirus software at all,
Outlook would have blocked it for me.
2. My antivirus detected and removed the Trojan horse
program attached to the mail message.
3. Had defenses #1 and #2 failed, my firewall would
have blocked the virus from sending messages to
other potential victims.
The firewall would not, however, stop the virus from
doing any damage to my computer, such as changing
or removing files. I discuss firewalls in horrific — I
mean terrific — detail in Chapter 10.

226
The original Trojan Horse
The Trojan Horse originated around
1250 B.C. during the war between the
Greeks and the city of Troy. The
Greeks had laid siege to Troy for ten
years, but were unable to defeat the
Trojans. The Greeks finally gave up,
marched their armies away, and left
a giant wooden horse outside the
gates of Troy as a parting gift.
The Trojans assumed the giant horse
was a tribute from a defeated foe,
pulled it inside the gates of their city
and began a drunken celebration of
their apparent military victory. When
the inhabitants of Troy were in a
drunken stupor, Greek soldiers who
had hidden inside the giant horse
emerged and opened the city  gates,
letting in the Greek army that had
sneaked back to Troy — and
destroyed the city.
The Trojan Horse became a standard
image in legend and literature. Let’s

Phishing Scams: Skilled
Imposters
A phishing scam is an attempt to trick a recipient into thinking
that a bank or other legitimate business is asking the recipient
to verify sensitive information, such as your credit card
number, bank account number, password, PIN, and such. The
correspondence from the perpetrator appears to be genuine,
as well as the Web site that the victim is enticed into viewing.
Further, the phishing scam may attempt to take advantage of
certain security flaws identified in Microsoft Internet Explorer
that cause the browser to incorrectly display the actual web
site that the victim is viewing.
You have to hand it to today’s scam artists: they are among
the most deviously creative persons alive. Take, for chilling
example, this actual example of a phishing scam. It all began
with a message I received in my e-mail a few weeks ago similar
to this one:

Worms: Viruses on Autopilot
While it’s true that viruses and Trojan horses are malicious,
there is another threat that’s downright diabolical: the
Internet worm.
Viruses and Trojan horses require one-on-one human inter-
vention to spread. A virus propagates only when a person exe-
cutes a program that is infected with the virus. A Trojan horse
propagates only when a person forwards it to someone else
by e-mail, floppy disk, CD, etc. A worm is a different kind of
malicious program: Once activated, it takes action by itself —
it requires no human intervention to spread. A worm contains
all the means necessary to spread from computer to com-
puter with amazing, terrifying speed.
In 2001, for example, the Code Red worm infected over
350,000 servers on the Internet in less than 14 hours. In 2003,
the Sapphire/SQL Slammer worm spread worldwide in only 10
minutes, infecting at least 75,000 systems in that time. In 2002,
a university researcher described a hypothetical “Flash
Worm” which could, if engineered properly, spread to hun-
dreds of thousands of servers in just a minute or two.
We can hope that one stays hypothetical. But I wouldn’t bet
on it.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
228

Worms are among the most feared phenomenon in large organ-
izations, because they can start without warning and spread
so quickly. They can bring a large organization to its knees in
less time than even the most adept organization can realize
that something is amiss.
How worms function
Worms get around all by themselves — they don’t need us. So
how do they jump from computer to computer? They travel
across the Internet and take advantage of specific weaknesses
in the operating systems (usually Windows) running on con-
nected computers.
Your computer is connected to a network — the Internet. Your
computer is designed to receive messages on several open
“ports” associated with various functions such as e-mail, file
sharing, and printing. When messages are received on one of
these ports, Windows examines and processes the message.
From time to time, vulnerabilities are discovered in the pro-
grams that receive these messages over the network.
Sometimes, a hacker can construct specially coded messages
that exploit one of these vulnerabilities — sometimes to an
extent that gives the hacker control of a victim computer.
Control of the computer means the hacker can cause the com-
puter to do anything he wants it to do — even send these
same specially coded messages (called exploit code) from the
victim computer to other computers.
So a worm has everything it needs to attack and penetrate a
computer, and use that computer to send copies of itself to
other computers, and so on until no more vulnerable comput-
ers can be found. Because human intervention is unnecessary,
this can occur even when everyone is watching the Super Bowl.
Defending against worms
As terrifying as worms seem to be, defending against worms is
straightforward. The following practices will be quite effective
in combating Internet worms.
Chapter 14: Trojan Horses, Worms, Spam, and Hoaxes 229

 Use a hardware or software firewall. Firewalls will help
to repel the network messages that worms send in their
search for new victim computers. A firewall that blocks
such packets will make the worm believe that your com-
puter does not even exist. Firewalls are discussed in
detail in Chapter 10.
 Keep security patches up to date. Most worms are able
to wriggle into your computer by exploiting a known vul-
nerability in your computer’s operating system, Internet
Explorer, and other programs. Security patch procedures
appear in Chapter 9.
 Keep your antivirus software properly configured and
up-to-date. Should a worm be able to see your computer
on the network, your computer’s antivirus program will
prevent the worm from successfully implanting itself.
Antivirus configuration procedures are described in
Chapters 5; updating procedures are found in Chapter 8.
 Regularly scan your computer for viruses. In the unlikely
event that a worm has already implanted itself in your
computer, a virus scan should root it out and remove it.
You can find this information in Chapter 6.
None of these methods by themselves will give you complete
protection against worms. But all of these measures together
will give you a strong defense in depth that will make your
computer practically impenetrable.
Hostile Web Sites: Caution —
Contains Poison
Danger seems to come from every direction! Viruses, Trojan
horses, worms, high cholesterol, asteroids . . . and now even
Web sites can be hostile. What’s going on here?
Okay, here’s the story. Web sites — and Web browsers — have
grown amazingly complex. Most of this complexity comes in
the form of innovations that permit Web servers to communi-
cate in many new ways with application servers, databases,
and users. While a great number of new capabilities have
resulted from these innovations, some have security holes
that have been discovered.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
230

While innovations in Web technology have brought many new
capabilities to the fore, a number of people have used these
same innovations to bring harm to you or your computer. Let
me explain with a real world example.
Suppose someone who wants to do you some sort of harm
sends you an e-mail message, telling you that you should visit
a particular Web site. The message that this person sent you
is so enticing that — despite your better judgment — you
choose to visit the Web site.
When you visit the Web site, malicious code in the Web site is
downloaded into your computer and performs some harmful
trick. Perhaps it deletes files, plants viruses or a key logger (a
program that records your keystrokes and transmits them to
a hacker’s lair) in your computer, or sends copies of the same
e-mail you just received on to other unwitting recipients.
Scary huh? You bet! But, believe it or not, it happens way too
often — and it has gotten worse.
Exploits have been discovered in Microsoft Internet Explorer
and Outlook that a user can trigger just by opening an e-mail
message. It’s not even an attachment, just an HTML-coded
message. Wow!
Can you avoid the damage that malicious Web sites and HTML
e-mail messages cause? You can get a start on it by following
these principles:
 Make sure the security settings in your Web browser are
adequately protecting you against hostile Web sites. I dis-
cuss this in detail in Chapter 12.
 Keep your antivirus software in good working condition.
See Chapters 4 and 5 for more information.
 Get a spyware blocker. You can find details on spyware
blockers in Chapter 10.
 Avoid visiting Web sites promoted to you by people you
don’t know, and those that make unrealistic promises. A
healthy dose of skepticism goes a long way towards pre-
venting problems.
 Consider using a spam blocker. You can find more infor-
mation on spam blockers in Chapter 12.
Chapter 14: Trojan Horses, Worms, Spam, and Hoaxes 231

Your antivirus software will also help, by blocking all known
viruses from being downloaded into your computer in the
first place. But don’t be complacent and place all your trust in
your antivirus program — what if the hostile code is so new
that your antivirus software doesn’t know about it yet? It’s
better to act responsibly and safely in the first place. Don’t
bet the farm on the chance that your antivirus program will
always bail you out.
Scams and Fraud
Con artists discovered that the Internet is a useful tool for
them to reach thousands — or even millions — of potential
victims. Every day I receive dozens of e-mail messages from
not-so-nice people who are attempting to defraud me of my
hard-earned money. A sampling of topics that scam artists
send includes these:
 Discount online pharmacies. They often sell imitations
that frequently do not work as promised.
 Medication to increase the size, shape, and/or other
characteristics of certain body parts. I’ve tried all of
these and they don’t work (I’m just kidding).
 Low rates to refinance a home mortgage. Usually these
are bait-and-switch schemes, or even attempts to harvest
private information in order to perpetrate identity theft.
 Credit cards with low rates, even for persons with bad or
no credit. Ditto on identity theft.
 Elimination of credit-card debt. Ditto again.
 Getting rich on eBay. If this were really possible, why
aren’t they just doing this themselves and making all the
money for themselves?
 Getting rich doing practically anything. Ibid.
While many times these messages also contain viruses or
enticements to visit Web sites with deliberately harmful con-
tent, much of the time these are scam operators who are
trying to illicitly obtain some of your private information or
sell you something — something that doesn’t exist, is illegal,
or doesn’t do what they claim it does. 
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
232

Hoaxes: Preying on Gullibility
Perhaps the most interesting kind of malicious content that
circulates the Internet is the Hoax. Simply put, a hoax is a
message that makes some kind of a statement or a warning
that is not true. A hoax contains no malicious computer code
like a virus — it just contains words, and perhaps pictures too.
So what’s the big deal about hoaxes? Well, some of them have
content so enticing or intriguing that people get caught up in
them and are seduced into thinking they are real without
giving them a chance to consider whether they are genuine or
not. Some good examples of hoaxes come to mind:
 “Beware of the Good Times virus.” There was no Good
Times virus.
 “Boy with cancer wants greeting cards.” This one really
preyed on our compassion. Trouble is, the boy did not
exist.
 “Bill Gates will pay you to forward this e-mail.” Why
would Bill Gates pay you to forward a silly e-mail message?
 “Postal service to levy tax on e-mail.” You guessed it —
there was no such pending legislation.
The most skillful hoaxes are those that sound so convincing
that they “must” be true (yeah right), and they tug at recipi-
ents’ emotions to get us to respond quickly before we have a
chance to think clearly — and realize that it is (in fact) a hoax. 
Strictly speaking, hoaxes aren’t harmful aside from the annoy-
ance they cause. And compared to spam, hoaxes don’t seem
like such a big problem. Still, they waste people’s time, and at
times they may prompt us to undertake some action that may
waste our time or money.
If you get such a message, wait a while before forwarding it to
everyone you know. Go to one of the following Web sites to
see if the message you received is listed.
 http://hoaxbusters.ciac.org
 http://vil.mcafee.com/hoax.asp
 http://vmyths.com
Chapter 14: Trojan Horses, Worms, Spam, and Hoaxes 233

If the message you did receive is a hoax, you might consider
doing what I do: Answer the message with a “Reply All” and
tell the recipients that the message is a hoax. Include one or
more of the hoax Web sites. This will usually cure many people
from sending hoax messages again. Why do you think I never
forward hoax messages anymore?

Chapter 15
How Viruses Function
and Propagate
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the types of viruses
 Peeking at how viruses propagate
I
t’s a fact of online life these days: Viruses just love
Microsoft Windows. They take advantage of the features
and capabilities of Windows, letting Windows itself propel
them from place to place. Viruses lurk beneath the surface,
occasionally make trouble, and always look for opportunities
to multiply and send copies of themselves elsewhere.
This chapter shows you how to identify several kinds of
viruses, as well as the various ways they try to stay one step
ahead of antivirus programs. And you also get to see how
viruses can make the jump from one computer to the next,
without having it cost you a hard drive (this time).
One thing is certain: Whenever a new way of moving data from
place to place is invented, viruses are sure to take advantage
of it. Historically this is true, and don’t look for it to change
anytime in the near future.
Types of Viruses
To date there are three primary types of viruses that exist
today: file-infector viruses, which attach themselves to pro-
gram files; boot-sector viruses, which install themselves in a
hard drive’s or floppy disk’s boot sector; and macro viruses,

Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
236
which burrow into Microsoft Word and Excel documents.
Details on each of these three follow.
File infector
As one of the most popular types of viruses (with the black
hats, anyway), a file-infector virus arrives embedded or
attached to a computer program file — a file with an .EXE
extension in its name. When the program runs, the virus
instructions are activated along with the original program.
The virus carries out the instructions in its code — it could
delete or damage files on your computer, attempt to implant
itself within other program files on your computer, or do any-
thing else that its creator dreamed up while in a nasty mood.
The presence of a file-infector virus can be detected in two
major ways:
 The size of a file may have suspiciously increased. If a
program file is too big for its britches, a virus may
account for the extra size. At this point, you need to
know two things:
• What size the file(s) should be when fresh from the
software maker. You have all of this information
written down somewhere, right? (I’m only kidding —
I know a lot of “propeller heads” but no one who is
that cautious.)
• Whether the virus is a cavity seeker — a treacher-
ous type that hides itself in the unused space in
a computer program. Clever. Of course, your
antivirus program will only know to look for a
cavity seeker if. . . .
 The signature of a known virus turns up in an antivirus
scan. The signature — a known, characteristic pattern
that “fingerprints” a particular virus — is a dead give-
away that a virus is embedded within a program file —
provided your antivirus software knows what to look for.
Even if a virus betrays its presence by its behavior, it may not
have told you where it’s hiding. Sometimes what you need is a
special program designed to remove that specific virus. Follow
your antivirus program’s guidance when it thinks it has found
a virus.

Stealth viruses
To stay one step ahead of antivirus programs, virus writers
began to incorporate some advanced techniques in their
viruses in order to avoid detection. These include
 Encryption: The virus can attempt to scramble its code
to avoid detection. Some viruses can rescramble them-
selves differently each time they’re scanned for, so the
encrypted code cannot form a part of the virus signature.
 Cavity-seeking: Because an infected file betrays the pres-
ence of a virus by being bigger than it should be, some
viruses are designed to find — and fit into — leftover
space in the files they infect. The idea is to avoid chang-
ing the file size, making the virus a little harder to detect.
The approach is typical of virus writers who know how
antivirus programs work.
You may wonder why there are holes in files. Well, there
are some formats of executable programs that enable the
programs to load and start more quickly. One charac-
teristic of these formats is the “holes” found in these
programs.
Boot sector
While less prevalent today, boot-sector viruses were once the
mainstay of computer viruses. A boot-sector virus occupies the
portion (sector) of a floppy disk or hard drive that the com-
puter first consults when it boots up. The boot sector pro-
vides instructions that tell the computer how to start up; the
virus tells the computer (in effect), While you’re at it, load me
too — before you do anything else.
Here’s the especially devious part: The virus writer knows
that after the computer is started, the boot sector isn’t used.
It’s pretty much ignored — the standard tools used to exam-
ine a floppy disk or hard drive won’t even look in the boot
sector. Unless antivirus software is used, it’s difficult to detect
a boot-sector virus. That’s partly because the little sweetheart
doesn’t occupy free space, change the amount of free space
available, or change the size of any file on the floppy disk or
hard drive. It’s pretending to be boot instructions. The only
traces of its presence may be (relatively subtle) effects such
as excessive hard-drive activity or slowed processing.
Chapter 15: How Viruses Function and Propagate 237

Macro
In the early 1990s, Microsoft developed a new capability for
documents in programs such as a Word or Excel: These pro-
grams could contain computer instructions in addition to
their data. After all, if a user had a handy place in the docu-
ment to put tools for working with data — mini-programs
called macros — a lot of time could be saved. Great idea —
but way too convenient. Before long, the usual persons-with-
ill-intent figured out how to create document macros with
destructive properties.
Windows 95 and Windows 98, the Microsoft operating systems
in use at the time, had little in the way of security-access con-
trols. A document macro could carry out practically any oper-
ation on the computer without any security mechanism to
challenge it — or even record it. Macro viruses are a threat
even today; if you’ve ever seen a warning box crop up to
inform you that This document contains macros, that’s why.
The other name for a macro virus is Trojan horse — which
makes it a cyber-variation on one of the oldest tricks in any
book. (Hint: Think about Greeks bearing gifts and look at
Chapter 14.)
How Viruses Propagate
A virus can be successful only if it has a way to propagate
from computer to computer. Otherwise, the virus remains
only on the computer where it originated, doesn’t attract
notoriety or vandalize big networks, and is (from its own
point of view) a non-event.
Floppies and CD-ROMs
Floppy disks and, later, CD-ROMs and other removable media,
were one of the earliest routes for viruses to make the jump
from computer to computer. In the 1980s, floppy disks were
the primary means for copying data — and viruses — from
computer to computer and from person to person.
Typically, files that were already infected with viruses were
copied to the removable media and ended up on one or more
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
238

other computers. File-infector viruses were then activated
when the new victim ran the program on the floppy disk or
CD. After it’s activated, the virus on the new computer carried
out its tasks, whatever they were, usually resulting in the virus
being implanted in other files on the new victim’s computer.
The cycle continued when the new victim, probably unaware
that he had a virus, in turn transferred the virus to new vic-
tims when he or she put files on floppy disks or CDs for trans-
fer to other people.
File servers
Yep. Even those respectable corporate file servers can harbor
viruses. Exchanging computer data by floppies (“sneakernet”)
has given way to corporate networks with file servers — 
central computers with large amounts of file storage that
can be accessed over the company network by all company
employees.
Think of it: Instead of running data around on individual disks,
one person can copy the data to a specific location on the file
server, tell his or her colleagues where to find the data, and
(potentially) everybody can retrieve the data from the file
server. All this takes place over the corporate network with
marvelous efficiency.
Consider the possibilities. The virus writers sure have. Some
viruses specifically search for file servers in order to install
copies of themselves there.
E-mail
The rise in popularity of e-mail in the mid-1990s has provided
viruses with a new lease on life. E-mail, and the development
of standard means for sending and receiving computer files
using attachments, gives viruses a fast track for spreading
from computer to computer.
If the virus is to succeed in its mission, usually it has to entice
the recipient of the e-mail message to which it’s attached. The
come-on is usually with some variation on a familiar theme
(open me — it’s important, you’ll get rich, and/or you know you
want to). Only when someone opens it can the virus activate
Chapter 15: How Viruses Function and Propagate 239

and spread. It’s like a bomb in a suitcase, set to detonate only if
the suitcase is opened — otherwise it’s just a suitcase (perhaps
heavy, perhaps ticking). A virus in an e-mail message works
much like a Trojan horse: The message and its attachment are
portrayed as one thing; the message is actually something else.
Whoa, that’s deep. Chapter 14 provides more information on
the differences between viruses, Trojan horses, and worms.
Philosophy aside, viruses that arrive via e-mail are usually
spread to other computers the same way. As a rule, after an
e-mail-borne virus is activated, it tries to find your e-mail pro-
gram’s personal address book feature (and if you’re running
an e-mail program that stores addresses on your computer —
say, Outlook or Eudora — you have that feature). If the virus
finds the address book, it grabs all the addresses and sends
copies of itself to some or all of them. Often the mail message
sent to those recipients will resemble the same one that
arrived in your mailbox, but some viruses have a range of sub-
ject lines and messages to pick from — variety is the spice of
life, y’know? Even for a virus.
Some recent viruses don’t even require the opening of an
attachment. Using a hostile version of the HTML code used
to build Web pages, they attack the moment the invading
e-mail message is opened. The Preview feature in Outlook is
no protection; if it’s turned on, then the virus may launch at
the moment the message is received. It’s a classic example
of how virus writers are always looking to turn convenience
into vulnerability. But there’s good news: Newer versions of
Outlook have safer security settings and other means for
blocking such nasty messages. What version of Outlook are
you using?
Instant messaging
Instant messaging, or IM, is a relatively new phenomenon that
lets people communicate in real time over the Internet. IM has
similarities to e-mail — you can exchange text messages con-
veniently with friends — but first-generation IM only allowed
messages to pass between users who were online at the same
time. Messages weren’t stored for later retrieval; instead they
were displayed on the other person’s computer the moment
they were sent. If the person you wanted to send an IM mes-
sage to wasn’t online, tough luck. These days some service
providers (Yahoo!, for instance) allow offline messages.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
240

Although they are far simpler than e-mail programs, IM pro-
grams have had their share of flaws — some of which were
originally intended as useful features. For example, IM includes
file-transfer capabilities; you can send a file — a document,
picture, program file, or (whoops) a virus — to another person.
Yep, IM is yet another conduit that viruses can use to get from
one computer to another.
Somehow I doubt you’re surprised.
In fact, some viruses and Trojan horses have been written
specifically with IM in mind. They try to exploit any available
flaws in your IM program so they can send themselves on to
the next “lucky” recipient, all without your knowledge or
consent.
Word and other document types
A macro virus in a Microsoft Word or Excel document has the
same capabilities as — in fact, is — a virus. It goes back to an
attempt (in the late-1990s) to make those documents more
useful — and boy, did it ever succeed. People started sending
documents to each other like mad, in unprecedented numbers.
From the virus’s point of view, it was a flood of hitchhiking
opportunities — all thanks to the popularity of Microsoft
Office programs, coupled with the convenience of e-mailing
documents.
A document created in a recent version of Word or Excel also
has its own toolkit of macros — for example, canned instruc-
tions that automatically apply margins to a document or run
mathematical functions on designated spreadsheet cells. Some
Chapter 15: How Viruses Function and Propagate 241
Check the metadata
Word and Excel documents contain
not only the actual stuff that makes
up the document, but also metadata,
the identifying information about the
document — such as who wrote it,
who last modified it, and so forth. You
can see much of this metadata by
opening a document and then choos-
ing File➪Properties.

macros are built into the Word or Excel programs; others can
be put into the documents themselves so that they are avail-
able to other people on their own computers.
Programs inside documents? Uh-oh. . . .
Sure enough, virus writers immediately jumped all over
Microsoft’s good intentions, twisting the new capability into
yet another way to deliver and spread malicious computer
instructions. Macro viruses are activated when you open a
document that contains a macro virus, and one way that a
macro virus spreads is that it can embed itself into other doc-
uments on your computer. Then, when you e-mail one of your
other documents to someone else, you unknowingly send
them the macro virus as well. Nice.
Earlier versions of Word and Excel either had no security con-
trols that controlled macros, or the security controls were
turned off by default. More recently, Microsoft has turned this
around by turning macros off by default, so even if your
antivirus program is not up to date, it’s more likely that you
would not become infected with a macro virus unless you pur-
posely turn off the safeguards.
If someone has e-mailed you a Word or Excel document, when
you see the macro warning, you’ll be better off if you disable
macros, unless you have no doubt that the file being sent to
you is virus-free. The best thing to do is save the file first, then
scan it with your antivirus program.
You can create your own macros by using the macro “Record”
feature. This makes it useful to make repetitive steps more
automated. But macros can be a good deal more sophisticated
than just “tape recordings” of button pushing. Macros can be
written in computer languages such as Visual Basic — it is
these macros that are the real troublemakers.
Web sites
Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer have led to a sit-
uation where a cleverly-programmed Web site can actually
transfer a malicious program from the Web site to your com-
puter without your consent or your knowledge. Most of the
time these malicious programs are contained within ActiveX
Controls (another one of those wonderful capabilities that
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
242

Microsoft created in order to make it easy for people to
exchange nice — and not-so-nice — computer programs
among each other).
There are security settings within Internet Explorer that let
you control whether you permit Web sites to send ActiveX
Controls to your computer or not. Nowadays, the default
security settings are tighter than they used to be, but it’s still
possible for Web sites to download nasty ActiveX Controls
with embedded viruses to your computer without your know-
ing it. And, it’s likely that for some time to come this will con-
tinue to be an irritating and troublesome security weakness
with Internet Explorer. I discuss this subject more fully in
Chapter 12.
One problem with these malicious ActiveX Controls centers
around exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. These
flaws can be exploited by creating special coding in the ActiveX
Control that can fool Internet Explorer into trusting (that is,
treating the control as if it’s from a trusted source) the ActiveX
Control when it shouldn’t. It’s like someone forging a movie
ticket or an airline ticket that could sometimes be good enough
to fool the gatekeepers into admitting you when you should
be barred from entering.
Newsgroups
Newsgroups — the discussion groups in existence long before
the invasion — I mean invention — of the World Wide Web —
are a marvelous medium for the distribution of viruses.
Newsgroups are like mailboxes where people can deposit arti-
cles for everyone else to read. Newsgroup articles rapidly
propagate through all the world’s newsgroup servers so that
anybody reading news anywhere can read all the articles
posted there.
Submitting a news article, called posting, is very much like
writing an e-mail message. Reading a newsgroup article is 
similar to reading a mail message.
A person intent on harming others can plant viruses and
Trojan horses in newsgroups as easily as he or she can in
e-mail messages. Then, as people throughout the world read
articles from the newsgroup, many may fall victim to the
virus. When a person reads an article, the attachment in the
Chapter 15: How Viruses Function and Propagate 243

article can be opened just as easily as an attachment in an
e-mail message. Also, if the news article contains a link to a
hostile Web site, then the malicious code in the Web site can
do as much damage to the victim as though they received the
link through e-mail.
Pirated software
Pirated software is software being distributed illegally, deny-
ing the original software maker from the income derived by
selling it. 
Sometimes viruses can make their way onto pirated software,
and for a variety of reasons, including:
 Poor quality control: Often, the distribution of pirated
software occurs in sub-standard conditions where
viruses may slip in unnoticed.
 Deliberate insertion of viruses: Perhaps the trafficker of
pirated software deliberately plants viruses in the soft-
ware they distribute as a way of inflicting harm on those
who purchase the software. You can compare this to a
drug dealer who sells tainted drugs to purposely harm
his customers.
Wireless networks
There are several forms of wireless networks, each with their
own set of risks — some higher than others. In this section I
discuss Wi-Fi — the popular home and business wireless net-
work technology — as well as Bluetooth and cellular data
networks.
Wi-Fi
Wireless networks in homes and in businesses have become
all the rage — they offer the convenience of being able to go
online anywhere a signal is present, and the cost of installing
a wired network can be eliminated.
Primarily I’m talking about 802.11 networks, also known as Wi-
Fi, WLan, 54G, and a few other product names. I’ll use the
term Wi-Fi from now on.
Part IV: Looking at Viruses under the Microscope 
244

Some security flaws have been discovered in the 802.11b and
802.11g protocols that Wi-Fi uses, that would permit someone
to connect to a Wi-Fi network and eavesdrop on the network
traffic. The book Hacking For Dummies tells you how to pro-
tect your Wi-Fi network from these vulnerabilities. That book
would look mighty fine on your bookshelf next to Computer
Viruses For Dummies (some of your friends might even begin
to fear you).
This will continue to be a problem for some time to come, as
tens or hundreds of thousands of Wi-Fi access points (for
example, the base stations installed in homes or businesses)
have been sold and deployed. Upgrading all the existing
equipment to more secure configurations will be costly and
time-consuming — and not everyone who owns one is even
aware that there are some risks associated with Wi-Fi net-
works. And certainly many who know don’t understand or
care about the risks (I hope that you are not among them).
I advise you to equip each computer in your network with a
good software firewall product if you do have a Wi-Fi network.
This will practically eliminate the opportunity for a hacker to
break in to any of your computers should your Wi-Fi network
actually be targeted and successfully broken in to. I talk about
firewalls in detail in Chapter 10.
Cellular
Road warriors and others who spend a lot of time “in the field”
can stay connected by subscribing to wireless data services
offered by most of the larger cellular network carriers. The
two technologies generally available are 1XRTT and GPRS,
although consumers of these usually encounter friendlier
product names such as T-Zones or Mlife.
The risks associated with wireless cellular data networks are
substantially lower than with Wi-Fi networks. The encryption
of wireless cellular networks has not been broken, and the
way that signals are transmitted makes it practically impossi-
ble for anyone to eavesdrop on communications.
There is a risk that your laptop computer (or PDA, or whatever
you’re using to connect to a wireless cellular network) could
be scanned and compromised. The risks here are very much
like the risks associated with connecting to the Internet using
Chapter 15: How Viruses Function and Propagate 245

a dial-up or high-speed connection: When connected to the
Internet (as you are with a wireless cellular connection), you’re
exposed to scanning and probing by hackers and worms.
The best advice I can give you is — you guessed it — to employ
a software firewall. As with Wi-Fi networks, dial-up, and high-
speed Internet access, a software firewall provides a nearly
impenetrable barrier to anyone or anything that attempts to
connect to your computer for nefarious purposes. Turn to
Chapter 10 for more information on firewalls.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth network technology is a short-range (up to 30 feet
or so) network technology that connects computing devices
in a room to one another without the need for wires. The pur-
pose of Bluetooth is not just to eliminate wires between
devices, but to provide additional flexibility and computing
possibilities not otherwise available or convenient.
You need to be cautious while using Bluetooth; it is only a
matter of time before a potentially hazardous flaw is discov-
ered. However, there is still the matter of whether certain con-
nections should be permitted.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
“T
he Part of Tens” is a long-standing Dummies tradi-
tion. Personally, I’ve always been fascinated with
lists and statistics, and this Part of Tens is packed with
cool stuff.
Viruses are misunderstood, so I’ve started the Part of
Tens with ten myths about computer viruses — but one
of them is true. Find out the surprising fact about foreign
governments.
There are a lot of good antivirus programs. I do an Up
Close and Personal with ten of them. Use this list and the
associated Web sites to help you make your decision on
which antivirus software to trust your computer to.

Computer Viruses

iruses are largely misunderstood by most people —
including some computer professionals. Here are ten
common misconceptions about viruses, and the straight
unvarnished truth.
My Computer Stopped — I Must
Have a Virus
If your computer stops, it could be because of a virus, but I
doubt it. Bottom line: It’s in a virus’s best interest to let the
computer continue to operate so the virus can continue to
use the computer to spread itself to other computers.
The “best” biological viruses in nature (what a concept) are
like this, too. If they kill their host too quickly, there goes their
opportunity to spread. A “better” biological virus — like a
computer virus — will perhaps just make its host sick, but
still well enough to keep spreading the virus.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
250
That said, a virus writer could construct a virus that caused
severe data damage only after it had been on the computer
for an extended period of time. However, there is the risk (to
the virus writer) that the virus might be detected and elimi-
nated by antivirus software prior to the time it is programmed
to inflict damage.
If my computer stopped, I’d suspect hardware or Windows, in
that order. I keep my antivirus program, firewalls (hardware
and software), and antispyware software in good working
order, so I’d suspect a virus last of all.
I Have Antivirus Software, So
My Computer Can’t Get a Virus
Wrong answer. Even with antivirus software, several different
factors can still mean that a virus can get in and/or hide in
your computer:
 If you fail to keep your antivirus signatures up to date,
then any new virus may be able to get inside your
computer.
 If the “real-time” antivirus mechanism in your antivirus
software is turned off or deactivated (this can and does
happen in the real world from time to time), then the
virus can walk right into your computer while the
antivirus program is sleeping. 
 A brand-new virus can get into your computer even if you
keep your antivirus signatures up to date. Remember, it
can take a few days or longer for the antivirus software
companies to detect, capture, and dissect new viruses
before they can update their signature files. Even then,
your computer will be protected only after it downloads
the new signature file from the antivirus software company.
 If you’ve been running your computer prior to getting
antivirus software and you’ve put any files on it from any
outside source — even if you’ve never connected to the
Internet — there could already be a virus on your com-
puter. If you don’t follow the installation procedures and
skip the all-computer scan that most antivirus programs
want to do when they’re first installed, it’s possible that a
virus that you caught earlier is still be lurking in there.

All Viruses Are Destructive
I disagree with all statements that say all. (Well, most of them
anyway.) Okay, word games aside, some viruses exist only to
replicate themselves, and other than that, they do nothing
harmful.
But a purist would say that even these are harmful, because
they upset their computers’ feng shui. A system with even a
benign virus is tainted, and there could someday be some
unintended consequence of that.
Bottom line: This one’s arguable either way. Wanna have some
fun? Get a couple of cyber-philosophers in a room and watch
them argue this one for a couple of hours.
Viruses Can Damage
Computer Hardware
I know I’m going to get into trouble with this one. Some expert
out there is going to have a good counter-argument, but for
the most part, this fear is false.
Here’s how it looks from the virus writer’s perspective: Why
aim for the hardware when there’s so much brittle software
that can be damaged? Go for the easy target first. Besides, if
the virus hurts the hardware, how’s it going to spread itself
any further?
The purist would argue that a virus can damage computer
hardware by giving it instructions that make the system
misuse some part of itself (for example, by writing excessively
to the hard drive), but few such hardware-eating viruses have
been released. This is partly because there are so many differ-
ent types, makers, and formats of computer hardware that
one virus would be hard put to trash all of them. Besides,
nearly all computer hardware has built-in safeguards that pre-
vent any real damage.
But if you do get a virus and see sparks or flames shooting out
of your computer or keyboard, please catch it on video and
send it to me.
Chapter 16: Almost Ten Myths about Computer Viruses 251

Viruses Can Hide inside
Data Files
Hmmmm, well, this is theoretically possible, but I have not heard
of such a virus. Yet. For now, viruses hide inside computer
programs — and in the places where programs normally hang
out (such as the boot sector of a floppy disk or a hard drive).
By definition, data files aren’t executable, and viruses have to
be executed. It’s safest to say that viruses hide only in exe-
cutable program files. But wait. . . .
Macro viruses are found in Word and Excel documents, so if
this is what you mean by data files, then you’re correct. Other
than this, generally viruses do not live inside data files.
Pictures Can Give You
Computer Viruses
Nope. Well, not yet. Pictures are just data files that are read
by special programs. But, someday, someone may come up
with a picture file format that accommodates the inclusion
of computer instructions — for whatever purpose someone
dreams up.
Are you thinking “macro virus” right now? So am I. Anytime
someone comes up with a way to store data that includes a
place for simple computer instructions (like Microsoft Word
and Excel do), then the risk of malicious instructions becomes
a real risk.
I Need More Than One Antivirus
Software Program to Be Fully
Protected
No, and no. Here’s what I mean. As long as you stick with one of
the ten or so well-known brands of antivirus programs, you’ll
Part V: The Part of Tens 
252

find that they all develop new virus signatures at about the
same time. So if you’re thinking of switching from <Brand A>
to <Brand B> because you think that <Brand A> gets their
virus definitions out sooner, I personally wouldn’t waste my
time. For most of us, any of the top ten are fine.
If you’re wondering whether this myth means having two dif-
ferent antivirus programs on your computer, don’t even try it.
Because of the way they work, you can only have one antivirus
program running on your computer. Anymore, the antivirus
install programs won’t even install an antivirus program on a
computer if it even suspects that there is one there already. The
install program is trying to avoid a fight, and you should too.
You Can’t Get a Virus from
an Official Software CD
I wish. It’s rare, but it has happened, and it very well could
happen again. The big software companies have very good
and almost byte-tight procedures that eliminate the possibil-
ity that a virus can sneak into a software development lab and
from there to a CD master.
It can happen. I wouldn’t laugh at you if you scanned CDs for
viruses before installing software from them. Promise.
Antivirus Software Companies
Create Viruses
To put it kindly, I don’t think so. Do the math: The antivirus
companies have enough business trying to keep up with
viruses “in the wild” that they’d be idiots to risk causing trou-
ble for themselves.
This sounds as crazy as Microsoft and Intel being in cahoots
to keep us buying newer computers! Makes an entertaining
(if trite) premise for a movie, maybe; doesn’t hold up so well
in reality.
Chapter 16: Almost Ten Myths about Computer Viruses 253

Some Countries Sponsor Virus
Writers and Hackers
Gotcha. This one’s actually true. Three or four countries do
have state-sponsored hackers. I shouldn’t name these coun-
tries by name, but many of them are known to be hostile to
the United States in other ways. Some of these same countries
sponsor hackers in order to give us a little trouble.
Official attempts to disrupt and break into foreign information
technology go back at least as far as the British code breakers
who figured out the Nazi “Enigma” encryption machine in
World War II. The adversaries have changed over the years,
but their struggle has kept pace with the development of
cyberspace, and it continues today.

here are about three-dozen antivirus programs that you
can get for your computer, so listing only ten would not be
fair to those that aren’t listed.
I don’t want this to be a lottery or a popularity contest either.
So what I’ve done instead is list those antivirus programs that
you’re most likely to find online or in a computer store, for
home consumer use.
If you’re interested in comparing features a la Consumer

Every effort has been made to make the information in this
chapter as accurate as possible. However, these fickle vendors
are sure to change their Web site addresses and product fea-
tures (or maybe that’s just the nature of technology). Don’t
blame me!
One thing is certain: Virtually all the antivirus vendors (at
least those mentioned here) have moved to the “subscription”
model. What this means is that you pay once for the software
itself, and with it you have the ability to download virus-
definition files for a year. At the end of the first year, you
pay a subscription fee to extend your download capability
for another year. Typically, the subscription fee is somewhere
between 50 and 100 percent of the price you paid for the
software.
