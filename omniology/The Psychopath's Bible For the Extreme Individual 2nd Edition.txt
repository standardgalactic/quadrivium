The Essence of This Book 
A. Accept that you are less than you can be and that you 
want to be more. 
B. Remove all ideas-positive or negative-about yourself. 
C. If you have the will, then do everything which makes you 
stronger and stop everything that makes you weaker. 
D. The means to accomplish this is contained within ...... 
Primary to our understanding of the Extreme Individual is 
the will to overcome anything which prevents us from reaching 
our own personal ideal. In opposition to the will to overcome is 
the fear of losing what we have. 
When we feel safe, our tendency is to reach out to create-to 
fulfill our wildest dreams-to challenge the world. Extreme Indi-
viduals, however, don't wait to feel safe; they simply proceed to 
overcome obstacles which stand in their way of self expansion, of 
going beyond what they are and what they feel. Man wants to tri-
umph, to be victorious in his life and some men want and need 
this more than others. These are the Extreme Individuals, those 
who push the boundaries of the ordinary.

Foreword 
Psychopath: A person with an antisocial personality disorder, 
especially one manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, or 
amoral beha vior.

The Americall Heritage Dictionary 
It's good to be the king. 
Mel Brooks 
For vears the market has been flooded with books filled with 
"sweett{ess and light." This is not one of them. 
Most people will characterize this book as evil, malevolent, 
unprincipled, wicked and pessimistic. It is all of that-and 
worse. 
It is <Ill "evil" book with "evil'! ideas. This is necessarily so 
because this book tells the truth. Truth is always characterized as 
"evil." 
In some ways this is a book of social philosophy; in other 
ways it is a book of techni9ue. Which it is for you may depend 
more on your attitude than on anything else. 
The average person will not even finish the Introduction. After 
a page or two, most will put it down and return to the mush of 
the TV set. We recommend that you do so. This book is toXic!l 
Most people will be appalled by this book. Many will ignore 
or dismiss its message as too horrifying even to acknowledge. 
This is exactly what we want: it advances the Work. (Indeed, if 
you are one of the rare few who do not see it thus, we congratu-
1 The weak-minded reader might see this as a dare and read on anyway. 
Good. That's what we want. On the other hand, you might see right 
through this transparent challenge, resent being told what to do-as you 
should-and stop now before you waste your 
time and money. 
Good. That's what we want. (If you do read on, the words IIdouble bind" 
might come to mind from time t~ time.) By the way, we've included lots of 
footnotes in this Foreword to provide an illusion of academic pseudo-
intellectualism. 
15 

Pandemonium 
late you as you are probably already a Master and you are 
already advancing the Work.) 
We can state with confidence that most people will be ap-
palled (or worse) because we have already seen it happen. We 
have noticed that quite a few of the brave souls who read through 
the earlier editions (the first of which was titled Tlte Toxick Magi-
cim!), and those who helped "test drive" this greatly expanded 
version, have remarked that the first chapters seemed rather easy 
to take-despite our dire warnings. Indeed, it seemed to them 
that these first chapters seemed rather light-hearted, even amus-
ing. And then, sometimes quite suddenly, they would remark 
that they felt something change within themselves, that it seemed 
that the tone of the book itself changed and that they began to 
feel disturbed-sometimes very disturbed. Whether it was the 
reader or the book itself that changed we leave for you to decide. 
You might even do this experiment for yourself: read the first 
five chapters or so. See if they seem "easy to take." Then keep 
reading and see if you feel a difference, perhaps a greater sense of 
dread and malevolence. If you do, go back and reread those first 
chapters again. Do they still seem as easy to take? 
Many writers claim to be concerned with the lamentable con-
dition of the human species and purport to present the means to 
bring man to a "higher state" of consciousness or evolution, or 
some such. Dr. Hyatt claims nothing of the sort. Rather, this book 
is intended as an instruction book for the psychopath,2 the sort of 
person who cares nothing for the "advancement" of the species. 
2 For those who wonder about the difference between the terms "psycho-
path" and "SOciOpilth," please note thilt both the dictionary illld psychiatric 
definitions of the two words ilre now literally identical. (fndeed, they ilre 
now referred to ilS "Antisocial Persollillity Disorder.") This was not aJwilys 
so. We speculate thilt the merging of these two terms has been done for the 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Much has been written about the psychopath but very little 
has been written for the psychopath. 3 Perhaps the best-known are 
Sun Wu's Sun Tzu the Art of War and Niccolo Machiavelli's The 
Prince (1532), both written for the political psychopath. (At one 
time we considered titling this book The New Prince: Machiavelli 
Revisited in homage to . Machiavelli's work even though we 
personally despise all those in and around the political field.) 
Though (probably) not written specifically for the psycho-
path, Eric Hoffer's The True Belieuer: Thoughts 011 the Nature of 
Mass Movements (1951) is essential reading for the practitioner. 
We are aware of few other useful titles in the non-fiction 
arena-not in psychology or even in political "science"-except 
for a few books classified in the "salesmanship" category. Some 
of Robert J. Ringer's work, such as Winning Through Intimidation 
and Lookillg Out For No.1 (both reissued in 1993) are particularly 
useful. (As Mr. Ringer so clearly points out, these are not sales-
manship books at all. Nonetheless, hardly anyone seems to 
believe him. To us, this is an indication that Mr. Ringer is a great 
Master. One of the axioms of life is this: even if you tell the 
truth-perhaps lJecause you tell the truth-no one will believe 
you.) 
Most commonly the psychopath has been depicted in a posi-
tive way only in fiction-the popularity of which emphasizes the 
moth-to-the-flame fascination most people have for the breed. 
(Though we focus mainly on movies, if you like to read you 
might want to keep in mind that many of the movies we men-
tion-here and in Appendix I-were derived from books-some 
convenience of those in the psychiatric and criminal justice systems so that 
they need only consider behavior and not internal psychological factors. 
3 Though useful for all psychopaths, this book is particularly written for 
the group of psychopaths we consider the best and highest of all-in our 
terms. We call them "Toxick Magicians." More about that later.

Pandemonium 
good, some bad. Further some useful books have not been made 
into movies at all; Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1957L is an excel-
lent example.) 
You can find a few comedies (mostly among older British 
films); these include The Magic Christian (969), School for SCOUlI-
drels (1960) and The Captain's Paradise (1954). You can also find a 
few comedy/dramas (notably The Stint;; (1973), and Blitch 
Cassidy mu( t he Sundallce Kid (1969)-whi~h are unquestionably 
among the best-loved psychopath movies ever made). However, 
most works which depict psychopaths are straight dramas. 
Among these are such excellent movies as Poillt Break (in our 
view, one of the purest and best of its kind) and the ever-popular 
Silence of the Lambs.4 
We believe that the most significant quality which makes 
many of these works so appealing is that the hero-psychopath is, 
at least to a large extent, conscious of his values and deliberate in 
his actions.s (Contrast the unconsciously driven nut-cases in sus-
pense/ terror /horror movies like The Hrmd That Rocks the Cradle 
(1992), and its numerous clones; these characters seem to inspire 
little or no sympathy with the audience.) 
4 Silell[(, of tile Lambs is a n example of an excellent movie derived from an 
excellent book (by Thomas Harris). The story of Hannibal Lecter's earlier 
"activities," Red Dragon (1981) WilS also quite good. Two decent movies 
were derived from the book: Mallhullter (1986), and Red Dragon (2002). The 
third book in the Lecter series, Ha/lJlibal, was published in 1999 and made 
into a movie in 2000; both the book and the movie were less well-received 
than the others. Nonetheless, it seems clear that after milny years, Leder, 
his liver, fava beans, and Chianti are still treasured. 
5 The consciolls psychopath is often seen ilS very "real" and frequently asa 
rather sympathetic character. This is certainly true for the fictional psy· 
chopath, and is also true for the real-life psychopath much more often than 
most people vlrOuld like to admit 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Throughout history-throughout most of the world-real, live 
psychopaths have gotten a bad rap. That is quite understandable 
since almost all of the world's religious and social philosophies 
have little use for the individual except as a tool to be placed in 
service to their notion of something else: "God," or the "collec-
tive," or the "higher good," or some other equally indefinable 
term. Only rarely, such as in 
some aspects of Tibetan 
Buddhism and Hinduism, and some schools of Existentialism, is 
the truly autonomous individual considered primal. 
To most of the world, anyone \vho holds himself apart from 
the herd (especially in the psychological sense) is, at least, highly 
suspect and probably blasphemous, heretical and criminal. 6 
Who are held up to the world as archetypal examples of psy-
chopaths? Almost without exception they are of the violent crimi-
nal variety: "crazed loners," "terrorists," "spree killers/' "mass 
murderers" and "serial killers" are popular characterizations 
today.! ("Satanists," '\vitches" and their ilk get a play from time 
to time but haven't really caught on. 8) 
People in the political and propaganda (i.e., news) businesses 
love examples of this kind: it gives them a golden opportunity to 
rabble-rouse and pontificate. 
Frequently they will describe the actions of these "terrible 
people" as "incomprehensible." When motivations are considered 
al alL such people are usually seen as demented, clinically insane, 
sexually frustrated, politically fanaticat or simply as incompe-
bAlmost every definition of the term "psychopath" includes the word 
"criminal" as one of its key characteristics. 
7 Note that all of these categories are highly stylized and serve to dehu-
manize the individuals about which they speak. This is a common-and 
important-methodology when referring to "enemies." 
BOne can make a strong case that modern psychiatry is simply a pseudo-
scientific replacement for, and extension ot the witch hunts and inqui-
sitions of earlier times. The brilliant psychia trist (yes, psychiatrist!) 
Thomas Szasz has done just that. See The Mtlnufacture of Madness: A COIrl-
paratil)(:' Studlj of the lllqu isitioll and the Mentnll-lcnlth Movement (Harper and 
Row, 1970) 

Pandemonium 
tent malcontents. Then comes the litany of assertions of "expla-
nations" for their behavior-books, music, video games, televi-
sion, movies, the Internet (or any relatively new technology), 
pornography, satanism, "society," etc., etc. ad 11t111f,('IWl. 
Historically, certain conquerors and political figures (e.g., 
Hitler, Napoleon, Stalin) and competitors to "legitimate govern-
ments" (e.g., organized crime figures such as Jesse James, AI 
Capone, John Dillinger and John Gotti9) have been characterized 
as psychopaths. 
This focus on the violent psychopath may be dramatic, but it 
is also rather narrow. In a sense, to isolate one's focus to figures 
such as these is like saying that "Christians" are typified by 
Torquemada and Jim Jones. (Come to think of it, there are 
millions-perhaps billions-of people on this planet who would 
agree with such a characterization of Christianity. Including us.) 
In reality, there are many operating psychopaths who never 
reach the public eye. Some are never identified as such because 
they arc successful at what they do (i.e., they don't get caught). 
Many more are never characterized as psychopaths because they 
do not exercise llIwcceptl1ble criminal behavior (remember that 
criminal behavior-especially violent criminal behavior-is usu-
ally considered one of the essential, defining characteristics of the 
psychopath) and are thus considered acceptable, even valuable, 
members of society. Many businessmen, lawyers, doctors, and 
politicians fall into this group. (It has often been said that AI 
Capone would have been a great success in the "legitimate" busi-
ness world if he had not become involved in "criminal" activities, 
This should come as no great surprise considering that many of 
the businesses in which Capone and others of his time were en-
gaged-for example, the sale of alcohol and other chemicals, 
gambling, money-lending and prostitution-were then, and are 
today, defined as "legitimate" or "criminal" only by the circum-
stances of geography.) 
9 It seems interesting to us that man y of these "crimina Is" were viewed as 
heroic figures by many of the people of their time. 
20 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Considering the amount of focus that is expended on the vio-
lent psychopath, it appears interesting to us that there really 
seem to be very few operating psychopaths in these traditionally 
accepted "nut- group" categories. For example, according to the 
FBt there are probably no more than thirty-five "serial killers" 
operating in the U.s. at any given time. lO 
Also, according to the FBC virtually all assertions of the 
tence of any organized, violent "Satanic" conspiracies have 
proven to be unfounded. 
Even more significant to us, however, is the rare occurrence of 
relatively large-scale violent acts Jl initiated by individuals or 
small groups: "terrorist" acts like the two attacks on the World 
Trade Center in New York, the bombing of the Federal Building in 
Oklahoma City, "mass murders," airplane bombings, etc. seem 
to us rather rare (and, incidentally, often rather incompetently 
executed).12 Indeed, with all the hype about the alleged power, 
determination, organiza tion and resources of certain "terrorist 
groups/' it seems particularly strange to us that, as of this writ-
ing, no one has yet done something really drama tic such as setting 
off a nuclear bomb in Washington, D.C Are all these "psycho-
paths" really so incompetent?13 
[0 Some academic sources claim as many as two hundred and some clilim 
that the number is rising. In any case, hO'wever, the whole thing seems like 
small potatoes. 
II This statement, of course, deliberately excludes the perpetrators of really 
large-scale violent acts: i.e., governments. 
12 Each such occurrence, of course, receives an enormous amount of 
publicity and hand-wringing. But let's be honest: add it all up and there 
really have been very few incidents of this kind, worldwide, throughout 
all of human history. Moreover, the total number of people injured and 
killed in <11l these incidents put together amounts to less than a pimple on 
the ass of any minor-league governmentally-inspired waf. 
13 Some people feel that the rarity of such deeds suggests (or even proves!) 
the existence of some sort of worldwide political/social conspiracy. 
Conspiracy theories appear to appeal to and console the human ego which 
longs for meaning and purpose and heltes to accept that most people recllly 
arc incompeten l. 
21 

Pandemonium 
It is worth noting that some people have suggested that, 
cause we have written about the violent psychopath, we are 
somehow encouraging such behavior. Nothillg cOllld be further fr0111 
the truth!! We wish to make it absolutely clear that we do not 
condone the initiation of violence to achieve any end, by anyone, 
at any time, in any place, in any way. For us, there is one 
fundamental rule of interpersonal behavior: it i::; nbsollltefy unac-
ceptable to initiate violence under nny cirClIltIstnl1Ces. (In case you 
wonder if we have joined the sweetness-and-light, turn-the-other-
cheek crowd, consider the significance of the word "initiate.") 
Clinical Definitions 
Now that that's out of the way, what does the ncademic world 
say about the psychopath? Here a<re some "accepted" definitions. 
From the American Heritage Dictio/lary: Psychopath: II A person 
with an a11tisocial persolTality disorder, especially one manifested in 
aggressive, perverted, criminal, or amoral behavior." [Emphasis 
added] 
II Antisocial personality disorder" is a technical term in 
psvchiatrv which we will soon consider. 
J Note that all of the other adjectives are normative: "aggres-
sive" (as compared to passive and compliant?), and "perverted, 
criminal, or amoral" which are all defined by what is "sociallv 
accepted."14 
-
1411Socially accepted," of course, is not an "absolute"; it i.llways refers to the 
mores at a particular time alld place. No doubt you would l'llIgh (and run) if a 
medical doctor said, "According to the customs of this society, you have an 
infection in your fingeL" But in psychiatry, this sort of diagnostic 
methodology is common and accepted. 
22 

The Psychopath's Bible 
For a popularized definition of the psychopath we turn to Dr. 
Robert Hare, author of Witliollt Conscience: The Disturbing World of 
the Psychopaths Among Us, who uses the following criteria to 
define a psychopath: 
Glib and Superficial 
"Psychopaths are often witty and articulate. They can be 
amusing and entertaining conversationalists, ready with a quick 
and clever comeback, and tell unlikely but convincing stories that 
cast themselves well and are often very likeable and charming." 
Egocentric and Grandiose 
"Psychopaths have a narcissistic and grossly inflated view of 
their self-worth and importance, a truly astonishing egocentricity 
and sense of entitlement, and see themselves as the center of the 
universe, as superior beings who are justified in living according 
to their own rules." 
Lack of Remorse or Guilt 
"Psychopaths show a stunning lack of concern for the devas-
tating effects their actions have on others. Often they are com-
pletely forthright about the matter, calmly stating that they have 
no sense of guilt, are not sorry for the pain they have caused, and 
that there is no reason them for them to be concerned./I 
Lack of Empathy 
"One rapist, high on the 'Psychopathy Checklist', commented 
that he found it hard to empathize with his victims. Psychopaths 
view people as little more than objects to be used for their own 
gratification." 
Deceitful and Manipulative 
"With their powers of imagination in gear and focused on 
themselves, psychopaths appear amazingly unfazed by the pos-
sibility-or even by the certainty-of being found out. When 
caught in a lie or challenged with the truth, they are seldom per-
23 

Pandemonium 
plexed or embarrassed-they simply change their stories or 
rework the facts so they appear to be consistent with the lie." 
Shallow Emotions 
"While at times they appear cold and unemotional, they are 
prone to dramatic, shallow and shorHived displays of feeling ... 
Many clinicians have commented that the emotions of psycho-
paths are so shallow as to be little more than proto-emotions: 
primitive responses to immediate needs." 
For a more detailed, clinical definition we can refer to the 
"bible" of psychiatry in the U.s., The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Ma111/al 
Mental Disorders, (DSM-JVTM) 4th Edition, American 
Psychiatric Association, 1994. 15 So, what does DSM-IVTM say 
about "antisocial personality disorder"? (The extract below is 
only a small part of a considerably longer [and really boring] 
"definition." We thought about including the whole thing for the 
sake of "academic correctness" but figured you'd fall asleep 
before getting to the good parts in the rest of this book. As far as 
we are concerned, what we have included is boring enough 
already and sufficient to make the point. All emphasis below has 
been added.) 
The essential feature of Antisocial Personality Disorder is C1 
pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the 
15 If you've never picked up DSM-IyT\1, we strongly recommend that you 
do so. You'll find yourself in it. You'll find your friends and associates in it. 
You'll find your family members in it. Indeed, YOll'ff find ('veryolle ill it. In 
other words, from the point of view of psychiatry, everyone has a "mental 
disorder." For psychiatry, there is 110 such fhillg as mellfal health, only 
aJ1d degrees of pathology! 

The Psychopath's Bible 
rightslh of others that begins in childhood or early adoles-
cence dnd continues into adulthood. 
This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy,

and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of 
others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are 
violated. The specific behaviors characteristic of Conduct

psychopath "may receive dishonorable discharges from the 
armed services, may fail to be self-supporting, may become 
impoverished or even homeless, or may spend many years in 
penal institutions" and are "more likely than people in the general 
population to die prematurely by violent means." (These are, 
indeed, some of the downsides if the psychopa th doesn't do it 
well.) 
Personally, I find the lesser-known definition of the Warld

Disorders, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1992; F60.2

gros~ disparity betweell behavior and the prevailillg social 110r11lS, 
and characterized by at least 3 of the following: 
(a) callous unconcern for the feelings of others; 
(b) gross and persistent attitude of irresponsibility and 
disregard for social norms, rules and obligations; 
(c) incapacity to maintain enduring relationships, though 
having no difficulty in establishing them; 
(d) very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for 
discharge of aggression, including violence; 
(e) incapacity to experience guilt and to profit from experi-

rationalizations, for the behavior that has brought the patient

feature. Conduct disorder during childhood and adolescence,

Why This Book? 
With all these definitions and remarks behind us, it's time to 
get back to why this book was written, This book 'luas written to 
applaud, encourage and coullSel the best among this wretched, sheeplike 
species called "111an", It pulls no punches, it makes no apologies, it 
minces no words. It applauds the rare individual who writes his 
own song, plays his own tune, and lives his own life. 
In particular, it speaks to a particular breed of psychopath 
which we call interchangeably the "Toxick23 Magician," the 
"Practitioner," or the "Manipulator". The most effective of these 
we refer to simply and reverentially as the "Master". 
As with all psychopaths, he (or she24) recognizes the pathetic 
nature of the human condition and takes from it what he can. But 
the Toxick Magician goes further: he encourages homo Ilorma/is to 
live life according to his nature-the life Thomas Hobbes charac-
terized as "brutish, nasty and short." [Lcz'iathan, 1651] He en-
courages the human race to the precipice. He docs what he can to 
help the species destroy itself and let nature get on with some-
thing(s) different. 
22 For what it is worth, DSM-IV'L\l seems to consider Conduct Disorder 
more significant to the definition. 
23 The (mis)spelling is deliberate to emphilsize the mindful nature ilnd 
quality of the practitioner. 
24 For simplicity and convenience we use the pronoun "he" throughout 
this book to refer to all Toxick Magicians regardless of gender. We mention 
this because we certainly don't want to offend anyone or be accused of 
sexism. 

The Psychopath's Bible 
He is a "magician" because he works his own will to achieve 
his own ends; he is "toxick" because destruction is his goaP5 He 
is not afraid to be deliberately malicious and malevolent. From 
society's standpoint he is the worst of the psychopaths because 
he does his Work intelltionally. As such, he stands apart from 
their definitions-definitions which would like to emphasize the 
inability of the psychopath to control himself. The Toxick 
Magician is consciolls of his actions and of his feelings. This makes 
him especially dangerous. 
Most Toxick Magicians are made, not born. So why would 
anyone want to become one? There are many disadvantages. To 
name just a few: He requires immense concentration and years of 
ruthless work. He will probably not see the long-term results of 
his work. It can be a lonely life. 
Still, it has its rewards. More than anything else, the Manipu-
lator is free. He is free from the hallucinations that homo normalis 
insists we adopt and which men have so treasured all their lives: 
his eyes see only what is. He is free from the myths of safety and 
security: he knows that death awaits him. He is free from the 
delusion of the supremacy of the species: at his best, man is still 
pathetic and weak. He is free from the illusions of language, 
especially "cause and effect" and "randomness": he can use 
words as tools when and where he chooses. He is free from the 
mirage of relationships: he knows where he is on the food chain. 
He is free from the pragmatic burdens the world insists on plac-
ing in the way of enjoyment: he laughs at the sheep and those in 
power alike and plots their downfall. 
We do not expect to hear from many true, mature, operating, 
successful Masters since anonymity is essential to the success of 
25 If vou've ever seen a martial arts movie which features a master who is 
adept at something like a "Secret Death Touch" you have a useful 
working metaphor for the Toxick Magician. Like the martial arts Master, 
the \laster Toxick Magician "touches" his victim and leaves. The victim 
never even knows he has been wounded, much less fatally so. Meta-
phorically speaking, of course.

their action. Nonetheless, some sole practitioners may want to 
corne in for a "checkup"; some, perhaps, for companionship, or a 
break from the tedium of dealing with common man. Of course, 
we also want to hear from those who wish to become Practitio-
ners-but take care: it will cost you a lot, perhaps much more 
than you are willing or prepared to pay. We know that very few 
will "make it." As the wise man said to those who sought en-
lightenment at his feet: "No more than 5% of you will gain 
anything; the rest of you are 'food.'" if you dare to spit at the 
odds, corne ahead, but we advise against it. We suggest that you 
get rid of this book now before you are poisoned further. You 
have been warned. 
If you are going to go ahead despite our warnings, we have a 
suggestion for both the aspiring and practicing Toxick ~agician: 
buy two copies of this book. One, of course, is for your personal 
use. You should put the other away for your offspring or for 
future generations since, like Hoffer's The True Believer, this vol-
ume will likely go out of print all too soon; it would not surprise 
us if this book were forced ou t since it is so "dangerous." 26

Psychopath.

decent brain-that tyranny and the dark ages are enveloping us at this

Introduction 
Numerous professional editors (i.e., pencils for hire) have 
refused to assist in the editing of this book. I ask myself why? 
Their answer is, that by participating in the publication of this 
book, they would be helping to "dim the light of civilization." 
What they really mean is that they are horrified at the prospect of 
exposing the inherent hypocrisy of most human behavior. 
What these professionals seem unable to consider is that the 
light of civilization is the result of individuals who are capable of 
inventing light bulbs and turning on the switches. Put another 
way, all that is best is the result of the aristocracy of spirit which 
faces the facts and refuses to become confused by the illusion of 
com plexity. 
Like any patient in need of an operation, I asked my surgeons 
(editors) to apply all their skill and knowledge toward beautify-
ing this project. But, instead of a healthy excision here and there 
they have concluded that this book is itself a cancer which must 
be ~nt out at all costs. This means that this book can't be beauti-
fied-for it is itself the cure of the cancer which pays them. 
Of course, if I had labeled this book differently and had been 
indirect in what I said there would have been no problem. This, 
then, is the first lesson of this book: never say exactly what you 
meall if you waHt the cooperation of the coward. No matter how 
pathetic, everyone is looking out for their best interests. For most 
people, their best interests consist of not being punished. Few 
play to 'win. They play to be safe while feeling morally superior to 
the winners. 
Also, these professionals can't handle, without facing a 
collapse of their spirit, that you can't improve something that is 
not designed to be improved-except by radical reconstructive 
genetic "surgery." You can toss all the money in the world into 
the pit of the eternal fire of stupidity and all it will do is burn. 
University degrees are in disrepute because they deserve to 
be. Mediocrity reigns. We even lack real people to hate. Lies, 
deceit and symbols have taken the place of the sword and the

gun. Man is a bad animal and worse as a God. Wha t other crea· 
ture needs holidays to remind him of what to feel and when? 
The Christian-Judaic attempt to make a human out of man 
has failed. What has emerged are two things: 1) The Web Page 
(but, no matter what one says, the Web is still the home of the 
Spider) and 2) The Manipul~tor. He is the fetus who refused to 
abort. 
He is about to happen to you. 
There is a lot of slop in life. You can make a ton of mistakes, 
be the biggest screwup, and still survive-even succeed. Don't let 
anyone fool you about this. There are millions-bill ions-of 
people who believe all kinds of lies and still do welL Some people 
believe the truth and are utter failures. Life is tolerant, even 
stupidly so. 
What you are about to read is an exposition on how "every-
thing" in the world works. While illustrative and vivid, this small 
book only touches on the intricacies of the major concepts of con-
trol, manipulation and torture which are the major pastimes of 
mankind. 
But I assure you, my dear reader, that "touching" on these 
subjects may be all you need. You may either feel exhilarated and 
seek to fill in the blank spaces yourself, or the "touch" of this 
little book may fill you with such disgust and loathing that you 
will smash every mirror in your house and pledge to assassinate 
the author. 
Instead of the latter, however, may this small book slowly 
and directly lead the reader through the workings of the human 
condition. 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Remember, the principles contained herein are applicable to 
mega-corporations, governments, societies of every kind, families 
and, of course, you. So read on at your own risk. 
The reader should keep in mind that this book is explicit and 
pulls no punches. Some readers will be very offended by many of 
the ideas in this book while others will sadly or joyously shake 
their head in affirmation and seek out the author for personal 
instruction and guidance. If you do so, be sure to bring a good 
check. 
I wrote this book as a summary of the observations of a well-
trained psychologist and social philosopher and, while I am well 
aware that my personal reputation will suffer in the sterile world 
of academia, I joyfully make this sacrifice for the honor of sharing 
my insights and conclusions with hopefully kindred spirits. 
As you read this book, keep in mind that you are sharing the 
secrets of the great "bosses" and kings of all time and, while 
these secrets might offend you, they do control you. So my 
reader-read well. 
The first thing to keep in mind is that nature is not horrible. 
Almost everyone believes, in one way or another, that nature is 
malicious; and without human conscience, the world would turn 
into a nightmare of war, rape, murder, theft, fraud, etc., and that 
the strong would exploit and destroy the weak. 
If such things exist-and they do-they do so with the full 
consent and sanction of mankind. In fact, this is the definition of 
mankind. 
However, there are a few points that we need to get straight. 
First the strong will never get rid of the weak as this would yield 
a poor return on investment. In fact, the strong actually help to 
breed the weak because, 'without them, the strong who remained 
would finally kill each other off. 
This would leave the world with but a few individuals sepa-
rated by vast distances. If this were the case, those remaining 
would die of boredom. 
33 

Pandemonium 
The common notion that man is a killer is much too narrow. 
He is sim ply an exploiter and controller with killing being only 
one of various possible game outcomes. In other words, all things 
being equal, like the proverbial cat and mouse, man would rather 
play with the mouse than kill it-unless, of course, he is starving 
to death. As long as there are other food sources, it appears that 
mankind enjoys manipulation and exploitation as its primary 
species-sport. Man is the ultimate game-player because he pre-
tends that he is not playing a game at alL 
Nature is not horrible. Nature is simply nature and the term 
"horrible" is simply propaganda, created by leaders from the 
beginning of time to help control the majority of people most of 
the time. 
"Most of the time" is the important phrase because, without 
some chaos and destruction, the population might wake up to 
the fact that nature is not inherently horrible; and then who in hell 
would need leaders to run their lives? Without leaders to com-
plain about, the game would not be fun. 
More importantly, for me, without people who deny that they 
are playing the game of control and exploitation, life could be no 
fun. One of my favorite games is to make people who believe that 
they are not playing a control game realize that they are. One of 
the kicks I get from doing this is watching them suffer from this 
realization. 
It is important to have at least a few people like this in your 
life. When T feel there aren't enough around me, I make a point of 
seeking them out and cultivating them. 
Without belaboring the point or trying to make the reader feel 
good, the entire Game of Life is rigged, and even most so-called 
leaders do not know what is really going on. 
This book promotes the idea that the human species, like 
every other species, has its own favorite sports. 
Specifically, the human species loves games which are domi-
nated by control and manipulation, even if they lead to mass 
destruction-including the destruction of self. 
34 

The Psychopath's Bible 
However, part of this game requires that we pretend that we 
do care when, in fact, what we really enjoy is what leads IIp to the 
spilling of blood. Some people enjoy the blood itself a bit more 
than others, but I for one would rather call the game quits when I 
know that I have won. 
1 am well aware that the position posited in this book will 
meet with a lot of resistance from the bleeding hearts of the 
world, but let me give away a little secret right from the begin-
ning: most human beings (the common man) are so numb by 
their very nature that they are completely unaware that they are 
playing a major part in this game (albeit as extras) and that, in 
most instances, the common man doesn't feel an ounce of pain 
from the process of general exploitation and manipulation. 
In other words, the generic victim needs to be the victim. He 
ITeeds to be controlled, lest he face a void-an abyss-so deep that 
Dante himself would have been unable to fill it.

1 
The willful application and direction of man's mind and 
power to the ends which he desires is the necessary primal force 
which accomplishes the true organic will of the Toxick Magician. 
Often this application will entail doing what normal people 
call "good," for it is this so-called good-in-itself which, by its very 
nature, brings about the desired results of the Master: confusion, 
destruction and the confounding of forces. The Manipulator loves 
people who do good and, even more so, people who think good 
thoughts. 
Everything which the Establishment and Church desire finally 
brings about its en-vn ruin and, with it, the establishment of 
Higher Order(s) of dis-organization-which is the goal of the 
Master. 
An example will serve to illustrate. 
The Church's desire to see the end of abortion brings about an 
inevitable over-population which, in turn, causes the Toxick 
Chaos necessary to bring about the destruction of the Church 
and, to a large extent, the environment as we know it. So, send 
food to Africa! 
The Toxick Magician sees all appeals to ecology as futile at-
tempts to maintain stasis. Hence, the preoccupation with ecology 
leads to a level of destruction far greater than would be other-
wise. 
For example, consider the cascading effects of water-saving 
toilets. In order not to dog them, we are now so dis-commoded 
that we have to shit in segments. People are not able to get rid of 
their feces as quickly as they used to and this is not safe!! 
Consequently, to safeguard their health, people are now buy-
ing black-market toilets and installing them illegally under cover 
of darkness. 
The effect of ecology in this case is to create a new criminal 
underclass and reduce the population through the spread of dis-
ease. To cover up the real cause, the blame for the increased mor-
tality rate has been placed on salmonella-infected chickens and 
39 

Pandemonium 
tainted red meat, thus eliminating Steak Tartar and Ramos 
Fizzes from the menus of finer restaurants. 
On the positive side, it allows people to become familiar once 
again with their bodily products, destroys the abomination of 
Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, and brings back into vogue scato-
divination. 
It is worth noting tha t, if the issue were really the conservation 
of water, the entire problem could be solved more effectively with 
a two-button toilet with, of course, the appropriate international 
icons of yellow drops for number 1 and a brown coil with rising 
steam for number 2.27 
The Practitioner constantly looks for small ways to jiggle the 
environment which will (dis-)attract the attention of the masses. 
Something as simple as dropping little pieces of paper in the 
street provides something to do for people with guilt complexes 
and no meaning in their lives. In a sense, the Manipulator helps 
reduce the rate of suicide and spouse abuse. 
The Master may even choose to help an ecological cause (e.g., 
the current preoccupation with "flesh eating bacteria") since the 
stasis brought about by its success will sooner or later lead to a 
greater displacement and, hence, more Toxicity. Remember, every 
solution leads to more complex and involuted "problems." The 
Toxick Magician loves problem-solvers. Better antibiotics make 
better bacteria! 
27 By the time you read this, such toilets may seem old haL Indeed-except 
for the icons-we have already seen such toilets in certain parts of the 
world. Moreover, for years, residents of many water-scarce areas have-
somehow-managed to be frugal with this resource without any sort of 
governmental enforcement whatsoever! (Only the tourists need to be told: 
"If it's yellow let it mellow; if it's brown flush it down." ) 
At this point it is worth noting that next week, or next year, or next 
decade, many of the examples used in this book may seem outdated, old-
fashioned, obsolete and / or "quaint." Such is the nature of the evolution of 
technology. Nonetheless, tile Frillciplc~ of tIl is book arc etertlal. 

The Psychopath's Bible 
As long as any force and motion is applied, counterforces of 
the most bizarre and unpredictable types begin to formulate and 
affect the entire field of play. 
The Manipulator knows that we live in gigantic sets of inter-
woven neucoid-correlation matrices where one tiny push in the 
right place can cause an entire field to collapse. This might be 
likened to Kung Fu Magick. 
41 

2 
The Toxick Magician knows there is no way IlOt to create what 
the Hindu's have called Karma. Karma is good! 
He knows this fact very well, and he is also aware that most 
people live in a superstitiollS world of "causes and effects." 
The Master knows how to take advantage of every supersti-
tion because he understands that "causes" as we "know" them 
also create "effects" as we can't know them. 
He knows that everyone lives in bllbMe(s) of superstitiO/z(s) 
where magical rewards and punishments lurk and abound. But 
somewhere in the dark of perceived order there is a monster hid-
ing, ready to devour the lIinnocenL" 
He loves to walk down the street in pride and certainty, 
knowing he's but one moment away from an attack of diarrhea. 
This makes him unique among the masses. The Toxick Magician 
always views his adversary with his head in the toilet bowl. 
The Practitioner knows, for example, that, if the pro-abortion-
ists win by controlling population, it is the wrong population that 
will be controlled. 
This is one of the key principles of Toxick Magick: whetherj 
for example, the Church gets its way or not in terms of abortion is 
quite irrelevant. It is the qUlllify lind nature of the forces set in motion 
for which the Toxick Magician stripes. 
He knows that whatever is the most gross will triumph in the 
end. Whatever levels the playing field triumphs for a while. 
He knows that the faster technology develops, the greater will 
be the collisions and destruction within the species which devel-
oped the technology. Inertia must always be viewed from the 
psychological perspective of indolence. Indolence, in one form or 
another, leads to farce. 
Regardless of social strictures, laws or anything elsE', the 
masses will continue to breed. The goal is 66.6% illiteracy in the 
Civilized World and not the reverse. The goal of literacy is simply 
a ruse, (l ploy of the Toxick Magician to set into motion those 

The Psychopath's Bible 
forces which interfere with the natural give and take of intelli-
gence and stupidity, and power and impotency. 
Thus, every so-called worthy goal is a ruse and the fuse of 
destruction. In the end, all goals reduce to controC and the means 
used to gain control are irrelevant and quickly forgotten. 
What difference does it make to the average individual or 
organization that 10 or 20 million lives are destroyed after a week 
or two? It is only important that there is a fresh chicken in the 
pot. This is called "Voodoo Mechanics./I 
Toxick Magick is tlIe direct application of one's power and abilities 
to speedily bring about the destruction of mediocrity and stllpidity. 
However, the Manipulator realizes that what follows is more 
due to "chance" than direct application. This means that you 
should not sit around too long thinking about what to do. Set 
something in motion now. Then sit back and watch the fallout. 
The natural power behind Toxick Magick is the Hatred of 
Restriction and the Joy in the power of Freedom and the apparent 
random applica tion of choice, risk and chaos. 
Pain and destruction feed the planet more than pleasure. 
A Manipulator's task is to always throw a little something 
into the works. Learn how to help everyone achieve what they 
want. It wilt in the end, destroy them. 
By the perfect application of the mind of a Master, individu-
als will develop the natural character traits to lead the world into 
a deep and abysmal darkness until the necessary form of trans-
formed destructiveness occurs, thereby freeing new and more 
interesting forms to evolve and develop. 
For example, as we wind down to ultimate world peace, 
expect the greatest possibility for a nuclear holocaust. 
Note that when speaking of evolution, we use the word 
"forms" and not "form." The idea of plurality is important in 
many ways but for the moment its importance lies in the fact 
that multiple users of Toxicity can create competing ends for the 
vet unborn futures which will create events which will be 
regarded as beautiful and grotesque. 
43

The human mind exists on shifting gradients of superior force 
and power. The grade of the mind attracts and influences the 
forces which surround it. 
According to the strength of the Practitioner's code of conduct 
and his willingness to help promote Toxicity and Chaos in the 
mindset of his neighbor, the appropriate result usually follows: 
paranoia. The more you can help your neighbor get what he 
wants, the more his paranoia and anxiety. 
Used properly, paranoia is an ideal weapon to create false 
and misleading struggles which burn the energy of everyone 
involved. Paranoia is a simple misdirection virus. 
We say that paranoia usually follows since other Manipulators 
may be operating in similar areas with different results in mind, 
But rest assured, all victims live in a world of suspicion and 
superstition. Thus, paranoia is the miJlimum a good Toxick Magi. 
cian can expect. 
The only major requirement is that all Manipulators know 
that their ultimate goal is for the good of the gross force field 
which is forever struggling to give birth to new life forms as 
quickly as possible, regardless of the cost to the older forms. 
Now, at last, the human race has the means to make radical 
transformations and provide the race with the opportunity to do 
away with itself in its present dead-end form. 
Thus, for example, in order for immortality to exist, most of 
the human race will need to be destroyed-and it will be. 
At first, of course, there will be the obligatory moaning over 
the IItragedy." But, within a few months, this destruction will be 
seen as a happy and necessary event, just as euthanasia wilt in 
time, be seen as a IInew" solution to the "problems" of over-
population and the funding of Social Security systems. (The 
scenes at the conclusion of Stanley Kubrick's brilliant movie Dr, 
Stral1ge/ope: Or How I Leamed to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb

The Psychopath's Bible 
Every human, no matter what he tells himself, knows that 
simply by being alive, he has run into a brick wall in every aspect 
of his life. This world is a world of in-voluntarism, of Zombies. 
And the final brick in the wall is involuntary death, 
The power of death lies not simply in the cessation of life, but 
in the reality that death always feels like the "other," and forces 
most people to feel a distance between their self and their "here-
and-nowness." Death is alienation-the final negative outcome. 
This is why the housewives of the world are seen everywhere 
pushing baby carriages and sipping tea as the mushroom clouds 
form. The Master, on the other hand, always keeps his coffin 
handv. 
Death, which we have been taught can neither be killed, 
endured nor cured, is the ultimate wound to the self. The Toxick 
Magician knmvs otherwise. He knows that once the right forces 
are in play, death becomes optional. 
If he has the mental organiza tion, the active will, and the 
stamina to exercise his power, he will have immediate control 
over his adversaries. This allows him to buy time. And isn't buy-
ing time our most interesting and perverse activity? 
45

Frequently the best way to gain control is through coopera-
tion. 
Each and every individual has an almost comical desire to see 
himself destroyed. This puts an end to the waiting and the filling 
of time with nonsense. To fill time means to make time tense. 
This doesn't argue against the survivalist theory, but in fact is 
supported by most Neo-Darwinian speculations. This race, in 
this form, is obsolete. It can't carry the possibilities of the 
future(s) for too long. 
Few individuals can tolerate the mental void of Toxick Chaos 
which surrounds him. Always there is some little quirk or some 
little error which causes him some misery, pain or destruction. 
Without the need to change diapers, most mothers would stran-
gle their infants. 
It always appears that this little something or that could have 
been avoided and, if we didn't wish to hide from the inherent 
ugliness of the human condition, we could have side-stepped this,
misery. 
But, remember: those who do not readily, eagerly and gra-
ciously accept this world of in-voluntarism will be labeled misfits 
and psychopaths. As such, be prepared-for enemies are needed 
to blame for every "bad ending." 
Look at the dinosaur-they might have blamed the automo-
bile. And if you look at things perversely enough, the death of the 
automobile might create a species more horrifying than the 
dinosaur. 
Even with horror and death aside, few can tolerate complete 
success. It leads to boredom and to the final realization that we 
are all food within the belly of a giant monster whose final goals 
we only have a glimmer of-and the glimmer we see is not 
comforting. 
Thus, while man doesn't seek death per SCI he seeks destruc· 
tion as this provides the opportunity for new and potentially 

The Psychopath/s Bible 
more lively events. Destruction is the great act of control. It is the 
IInoN to in-voluntarism. 
The fact that destruction does, in fact, lead to death is purely 
happenstantial. The organisms of the fu ture will be able to 
destroy themselves and still continue to live. 
Where there exists an ilmate superiority or power, Toxick 
Magick will manifest itself. 
A good Student will immediately understand this once he 
realizes that much of what he has called "failure" is truly pre-
potent success. This is particularly true when the Student can 
write his "autobiographies" with complete dispassion. Every 
autobiography is nothing more than a story of destruction and 
decay. 
Whether a force is ultimately positive or negative doesn't 
matter, for it sets in motion other forces over which the magician 
has little or no control. 
This form of Chaos is desired since unknown results leads to 
more Toxicity and Chaos. Toxick Magicians have been called the 
"Children Who Hate." And, if the truth be known, they do. They 
hate stupidity, death and restriction. They loathe the idea of 
linear time.

The public in general has no concern as to who is a Manipula-
tor. The public is only concerned with petty criminals who might 
affect their petty little lives directly. This is why so many white 
collar criminals go free or get minimal sentences, and why some 
of the most hideous crimes either go totally unnoticed or are ap' 
plauded as greatness. 
For example, the "great" Hawaiian king, Kamehameha tis 
considered "great" because he "unified the islands" -by pushing 
thousands of his "enemies" off of cliffs. 
Similarly, consider the Christian fight against evil in 
which was finally victorious when all of the "witches" were 
burned. 
The public concerns itself with the maintenance of its status 
quo (i.e., chickens) and, as a rule, the public should be helped to 
maintain its status quo even more intensely than it is. 
The heavier it gets, the deeper it sinks and the greater its fears, 
rt can't succeed or leap to the next level of superiority. [t must 
sink deeper and hold on more strongly. 
As it does this, it creates more enemies while, at the same 
time, making itself more impotent. Do not fight the status quo or 
the failures which surround you. Help it, encourage it, and then 
help it encapsulate itself. Help it grow stronger and heavier. Use 
whatever it creates. Don't change it, simply streamline it a little, 
Many normal magicians regard real power as unattainable. 
This is natural for them since they do not have any real power to 
begin with. One who lacks a mind which possesses strength and 
active processes can't, by its very nature, possess power. 
Normal magicians are horrified by the notion of power and 
control over others. The Toxick Magician has no such terror. What 
terrifies him is that the statlls quo may gain power over him 
through his own natural desire to be destroyed and to be replaced 
by better, more flexible life forms. 
Remember, it is a natural tendency to be dark and self-
destructive. The trick is to do it well-very ,veIl. 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Help others get what they want. This is the most insidious 
form of destroying them. It makes them instantly terminal and, in 
most cases, useless. 
This method is similar to what has been called the Peter 
Principle. Ileip each person to reach their highest level of incom-
petence. Once they are there, they will begin digging in, establish 
fixed fortifications, and now you have them as a resource-a tool, 
if you would, to do with as you wish. 
, For example, universiti~s have developed the tenure system 
to guarantee control over a potentially dangerous and Toxick 
faculty. 
49

Always play to security as if it were an adventure. Always 
help others think that their attem.pts to assure themselves secu· 
rity will work. As a Manipulator, we know that most methods to 
assure security are doomed to fail sooner or later-and fail badly. 
It is better to live with danger ami chaos than ulith sl'Clfrity. Your 
chances of surviving long enough and with enough power are 
much greater. This is another fundamental principle of Toxick 
Magick. 
There are natural T oxick Magicians and many of my readers 
know who they are. But there are others who should remain 
unknown and unknmvable, for this affords them the best oppor-
tunity to do their work effectively. 
These individuals know how to extend their power by being 
sort of unconscious of what they are doing. Awareness interferes 
with their activities. One way of recognizing them is from the 
trails of people they leave behind-people who think they have 
been helped. In fact, these people have been made into Zombies 
who later will be used in one way or another to accomplish the 
desired end of Pandemonium. 
The Master is well aware of the value of controlling the 
psychic powers of others. In other words, what some people 
believe to be their spiritual, psychic, or higher self is really the 
shadow spirit of the Master. 
It is the will of the Master that is speaking. This result can 
either be induced or produced in the subject at hand. 
Everyone is a potential subject for the Toxick Magician. 
encounter is a laboratory experiment to determine what forces are 
needed to help the subject develop the correct obsessions and 
compulsions to accomplish the will of the Practitioner. 
He will always first try to bring out what is natural to his 
victim or tool. This is done, not for moral reasons, but because it 
conserves energy and time. If this approach doesn't work, then he 
will simply find other means to produce the effect(s) he wants. 
50 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Encounters take place everywhere. This is the beauty of learn-
ing how to be an effective Manipulator. All day long, every day, 
you can inject your will upon others by using their stu pidity, their 
desire to be gullible and, more importantly, their need to be flat-
tered while disbelieving what you say. 
People are so fearful of being controlled that this fact in itself 
makes them prime resources to be controlled. 
Every subject will guide you in how you can control them and 
help them become a slave to aspects of your will. For, although 
people hate the thought of control, most wish to be controlled. 
Risk, freedom and power are only words for them. Most are 
simply weak and cowardly, secretly waiting for some superior 
force to take them over. The proof is self-evident. Just look at the 
number of people who seek degrees in sociology and education. 
The comatose state of ordinary man is necessary, and every 
attempt to awaken him drives him deeper into security and 
trance. Thus, every promise to make things better is designed to 
make him 
dangerous and more readily destroyed. Even his 
revolutions make him into a better slave. 
In the process of planetary and intergalactic change there is, 
of course, the necessity that the Practitioner himself will be con-
sumed by the procedures he uses in reaching his own ends. 
He, then, must not counterfeit his real-life experiences into 
moral platitudes. Once this is done (except as a device for others 
to believe in), you are no longer dealing with a true Toxick Magi-
cian but with someone who is possessed by his beliefs. 
Such a person is no longer a real Manipulator; he has become 
a True Believer. This is not to be bemoaned, as True Believers are 
the very foundation of change. Stagnation always leads to some 
form of spontaneous combustion. Just look at any garbage heap. 
Zombies are a necessary requirement and, the more of them-
no matter what the source-is a sign of success. 
Many people will reduce all willful action into two simple 
categories: Black Magick and White Magick. The easiest thing to 
do with this simple reductionist ploy is to use it to your benefit. 
In other words, let people call it what they will. Agree with them 
51 

Pandemonium 
and help them to firm up their ideas. Help them make their 
notions so rigid that they can be broken like glass. Other people's 
stupidity is your resource. Help them to remain stupid. 
Remember, one of best ways to get what you want-no 
matter what it is-is to help other people get what they "whim" 
they want. 
Discord is the politics of mobility. 
The more mobile, the more discord you sow. However, it is 
wise to give the impression of stability and order. This keeps your 
enemies from controlling you. 
Remember, the basis of toxicity is control. The more control 
you have-particularly if people do not know it-the more toxick 
you are. Some of the most powerful Masters I know appear to be 
the most obsequious, kind, and helpful people in the world. 
However, they are the most dangerous people in the world-
dangerous, that is, to those who believe in the beneficence of man. 
52

Do not think that by learning the basic principles of Toxick 
Magick that a world of ease and bliss will automatically open to 
you. 
The practice of Toxick Magick is hard and the traps are many. 
One of the worst and most dangerous traps is the "food chain./f 
Every good Manipulator knows exactly where he is on the food 
chain at any moment in time. 
The concept, in and of itself, often separates the real Toxick 
Magician from the pretenders. 
The food chain concept explicitly states that we are in a con-
stant process of consuming each other and being consumed by 
each other. There are no free lunches and each encounter demands 
knowledge of who is going to consume whom. 
Some people prefer to look upon this as trading: after alt we 
are human, aren't we? But no, we consume each other all the 
time, often in subtle ways. Indeed, we live off the flesh and blood 
of everyone we meet. In fact, right now, each of us is living off the 
flesh and blood of people we haven't met and others are living off 
of us. 
However, the Practitioner knows how to delve into and apply 
the most subtle forms of strength or weakness to accomplish his 
ends. 
It is imperative to evaluate what each person wants to con-
sume, the stvle in which he consumes it, and the utensils he uses. 
Everyone w~nts something, even if it is to give away something 
for "free." 
Some people are so overburdened that the greatest way to 
consume them is to not let them help you. By doing this, the 
Practitioner can create situations in which he can get something 
from a person that he didn't wish to give. 
But beware: You are also food. And knowing how to be con-
sumed (eaten/used) is imperative in your practice. If you are 
really outclassed, acknowledge this to yourself. If you don't 
accept the fact gracefully, you will damage yourself severely. 
53 

Pandemonium 
Trying to pull yourself up to your adversary or trying to pull 
your adversary down to yourself is another common error. This 
can cause UI/1lcccssary pain and destruction. 
Evaluating the complex and ever-changing positions on the 
food chain is one the finest applications of your capabilities. Once 
you have ascended to the position of influence in this area and 
practice the method to its fullest extent, you will automatically·
release a vast reservoir of your natural power. 
But under no circumstances should you undervalue the 
power of knowing how to evaluate the power of food-chain 
consciousness. 
Do not be put to sleep by platitudes or niceties. You are al· 
ways being looked at in terms of use, and use means consump' 
tion. Thus, always be prepared to learn new methods of food· 
chain evaluation. To do this you will have to lose, at least for a 
while, much more than you will win. One of the secrets in this 
area is learning how to disguise your scent with marinades. 
The Master trusts evervone--that is, he trusts everyone to be 
human. No matter what disguise each and every perso~l puts on, 
they are out for their own perception of their best interests-
which includes their own self-destruction. 
Almost everyone denies that self-destruction is one of their 
primary goals, but no matter how much they deny it, they prac· 
tice it. ·While self-destruction makes way for new-and possibly 
more interesting-life forms, it also allows people to cope with 
their feelings of helplessness. 
Everyone feels helpless in one way or another. There is no way 
out of it-except to destroy yourself. 
Self-destruction is control, and some control, no matter how 
painful it might seem, is better than no control at all. 
Most so-called insane people are nothing more than bad con· 
trol junkies. So are most drunks and addicts. 
They are very aware of how little control they have except, 
however, to numb themselves, create artificial delusions of gran· 
deur and, finally, to destroy themselves. And, in the process, 
cause pain to the world which "refused" them. 
54 

The Psychopath's Bible 
This feeling exists only in their own imagination. I have known 
a number of people who attempted suicide and one of their 
prime fantasies is watching others cry over them and hate them-
selves for the way they treated the poor, dead martyr. 
If you were there and could have overheard some of these in-
adequate control junkies, you would have laughed yourself silly. 
And, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised that some of them, after 
hearing your laughter, would go right out and try it again. 
In the process of understanding the food chain, it is impera-
tive to keep in mind the kind of diet you prefer. Some Toxick 
Magicians like different types of subjects to manipulate than do 
others. For example, some like women while others prefer men. (I, 
for one, like to help women get wha t they want.) 
However, it is imperative to keep in mind that, since Toxick 
Vampirism is highly sophisticated and intricate, it is important to 
know that some Practitioners go on particular types of diets be-
fore they attempt certain manipulations or activities (e.g., 
rituals). 
Knowing what types of people to "consume" and when to 
"consume" them can be highly effective in determining the suc-
cess or failure of a specific venture. 
Another way to understand this issue is based on the meta-
phor of mea t-eaters and vegetarians. 
Under certain circumstances a meat-eater must go on a vege-
tarian diet to heal an illness or lose weight. The same holds true 
with Toxick Magick. Certain psychic diets (which, in this case, 
means the consumption of the energy of certain types of people), 
is necessary before embarking on a particular experiment or pro-
ject. 
Eat the psychic food of others which best suits your tempera-
ment and the temperament of your operation. If you are going to 
try a magical operation which requires immense strength, you 
might try controlling someone you have never controlled before. 
However, if you fail, you might find that you will need to wait a 
while before you have enough strength to try again. Be careful not 
to overindulge or overdo it. 
55 

Pandemonium 
Draining people of energy can sometimes have a rebound 
effect, particularly if you can't stomach the results. It's like 
buying a puppy dog and feeling possessed by its following you 
around all the time. You might have been better off with a cat or 
a snake. Be careful of what you want, particularly if you do not 
know how to balance the operation. 
The balance of any operation counts on the mixture of ingre-
dients which goes into making up the whole meal. And, for some 
people, looking at a ritual as if it were the preparation of a fine 
meal is an excellent device to guarantee a successful operation. 
Sometimes a meal which appears out of balance (such as an 
all meat diet), may be the exact thing for the forces which you 
plan to deal with. Sometimes alcohol or other substances can 
backfire on a opera tion which requires focused, conscious 
thought, while at other times alcohol may be exactly the right 
ingredient to make the operation a success. 
Regardless of what you decide to "eat," both psychically and 
physically, normally overindulgence will not prove to be useful. 
Tn facC few operations which concern money, sex, or power ben-
efit from overindulgence. 
If you feel that overindulgence is necessary, wait until the 
operation is completed. The higher powers and forces sometimes 
appreciate a great feast afterwards both to signify your commit-
ment to them and to feed a particular entity. 
This issue brings up a very important point. You must 
reward entities which assist you and punish entities which either 
harm or interfere with your work. 
\Vhen you are evaluating someone on the food chain, it is 
important to take into account the quality of their brain and the 
beauty or ugliness of their body. 
Extracting energy from dull-witted or very ugly people, while 
still energy, can cause psychic indigestion. This idea follows from 
the old axiom: "Be careful who you hang out with, you might 
become like them." 
This fact is often ignored, not only in the simple day-to-day 
operations between people, but in the area of Toxick Magick. 
Although a Master can normally offset this effect, most appren· 

The Psychopath's Bible 
tices are not yet strong enough to accomplish this, particularly if 
they are surrounded by parasites and defeatists. 
Under these conditions, it is best to stay away from these 
people, especially if there are too many of them gathered in a 
single place. On the other hand, if there are a few, simply take 
control of them. 
Do not allow them to influence you. Build a shield around 
them first and, if that doesn't work, get away. But don't build a 
constant shield around yourself because it might inhibit other 
work which you might be doing. Personal shield building is only 
necessary under certain conditions. 
Sir,ce the power of the Practitioner is a function of both 
natural superiority and intense practice, it is important to choose 
the right times and places for practice, as well as the right victims 
for your opera tions.

As more people find that they are iImately Toxick, some com-
petition will tend to break out among practitioners. This is natu-
ral since, at this time in our history, more people are being born 
with the talent of manipulating darkness and participating in the 
destruction of normal humans. 
I often feel overjoyed when I find out tha t some worn-out 
impediment to our futures-and the futures of the developing 
life forms-has been destroyed, or has become so rigid that its 
own operating system is failing. 
For example, consider the effects of ever-increasing over-
population. For normal people this is a worry because of the 
drain of resources. For the Toxick Magician it is a joy, pnrtiCl//nrly 
because it is a drain of resources. 
He scoffs at sllch notions or problems. Every problem is sim-
ply an opportunity to fuel the feeding frenzy. 
Groups that hate each other and wish to destroy each other 
are simply tools for the Manipulator. 
For example, the periodic "Satanic Scares," witch hunts over 
organized child abuse, and all TV media-events are viewed first 
as jokes and then as proof that this particular species has reached 
the end of its u tilitv. 
The species is ~imply a resource for the latent, hidden viruses 
of this planet-much as this planet may be a resource for another 
planet. 
The entire process is a food chain which the Master actively 
supports and utilizes for his comfort and fun. He knows that 
everything is part of the problem and that there are no solutions 
from a conventional point of view. He knows that millions die 
daily and millions are born to take their place. He knows that the 
planet is alive as a stomach is alive-it digests everything. 
The Manipulator always contributes to the problem-even 
when he gives millions of dollars to charity. He knows that each 
mini-solution will lead to a greater and bigger problem in the long 
run. He knows that a vaccine which will save lives will, in the long 

The Psychopath's Bible 
run, actually destroy more lives or let the wrong people die and 
the wrong people live. 
Fe\'\' people have the strength and fortitude to stare directly 
into the eyes of the future forms which me preparing to take our 
place. Few can stand the face of the superman. Few can bear the 
horrors that await and no one can stop them. Every law enacted 
is just another nail in the coffin, and to watch the True Believer 
suffer and be tortured is a great joy. It feeds you. 
It is important to have a number of separate, independent, 
and different food sources to feed and maintain you, depending 
on your ever-changing needs. 
For example, I engage in "friendships" and dialogues with 
people who normally would hate each other, but who I use for 
sustenance and enthusiasm. 
Both Satanic cults and Christian fundamentalists are closer to 
seeing the truth than most normal people. 
Something is going on, but it's not what they think. The Beast 
is staring out from each pair of eyes you see. Each glance in the 
mirror is the story of this world-and the Toxick Magician loves 
mirrors. Each time he sees his face, he sees the self-destroying 
power of the species and the planet. This is his true freedom, 
which transcends any cult and any cult hero. 
He knows that each person suffers silently and secretly and 
each person is constantly making up stories to hide his own hide-
ousness from himself and others. 
He has the strength and fortitude to face the Void and see the 
Beast deep within, eating its way out. 
He knows that flesh is mostly for pain-that pleasure is more 
fleeting and pain is more enduring. He laughs into the Cosmic 
Bellvof Hell ilS the Beast consumes him 
Every time people have children the Toxick Magician is over-
joyed, for he knows that within this little bundle is suffering, 
death and destruction. He is overjoyed with hope that each little 
bundle contains the seed of the next monster.

Every human life form is totally and completely occupied 
with itself. 
Even if you appear to be the center of someone else's activi-
ties, it is still the person and his preoccupations which are the real 
center. Never forget this, no matter how interested someone.
seems in you. 
They are interested in how you fit-or might fit-into their 
food chain. Never be fooled by people who sacrifice themselves 
for vou. Without their so-called sacrifice, they would be isolated, i
dep~essed or feel utter emptiness.' 
i
Self-sacrifice is an addiction. Self-sacrificers are often closet-
or ex-morphine addicts. I can't tell you how many addictions are 
prevented and / or "cured" through substitution. The number 
would certainly be startling to most people. 
The idea of "for someone else's good" is patently absurd, 
even if the victim receives benefit. People constantly confuse 
results with motive, and it is much more comforting to ascribe 
mystical and altruistic motivations to events than to accept them 
as magical acts of will (the Merlin phenomenon), or random con-
sequences of complex interaction neucoid-correlation matrices. 
If you place twelve people together in a room, certain unpre-
dictable outcomes have to occur. This is true even if you limit the 
interests of the dozen to preparing and sharing food. 
Every human, while occupied with himself, desires to get 
away from himself and play "follow the leader." Follow the 
leader is not always noticeable in every area of a person's life, but 
the desire to follow must express itself somewhere in a person's 
life. 
Masters have learned how to use this instinct in themselves 
and in others. 
They can imitate others and reflect those qualities which the 
person loves and admires in himself. The expert can always spot 
the areas in which a person wants to follow or be dependent. 
Once this information is properly assimilated into the Toxick 
60 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Magician's neucoid-correlation matrix, the Magician begins to 
close in. 
He becomes more capable than ever of consuming the energies 
and resources of that person. So, if you are strong enough, 
remember that no one really likes you, What they like is how you 
make them feel, and how well you fit into their resource scheme, 
If a Manipulator does something for someone, he never allows 
himself to be totally repaid, He always wants an edge. However, 
he always allows his victim to repay him to a certain degree lest 
the victim turn into a enemy. 
People are always keeping count of what they owe and what 
is owcd to them. Few people are capable of simply taking with-
out its finally having a devastating effect on their personality, 
However, there are some who are expert at it. 
I personally know of three, but even in these cases there are 
occasional paybacks which seem to have a random quality, None 
of these three are Toxick Magicians, In fact, they are excellent ex-
amples of altruists and martyrs who mostly sneak their pleasures 
behind closed doors and always at the expense of everyone they 
know-while, all the time, claiming innocence and ignorance, 
One of these even chastises himself for not understanding the 
ways of the world while he insidiously manipulates everyone to 
conform to his views and to give him what he wants, 
But he is not a Toxick Magician, He doesn't help people 
destroy themselves by helping them get what they want, nor is he 
concerned with advancing himself in any real-world terms, He 
lives totally in his imagination, and is an ideal victim for any 
good Practitioner, I have been utilizing his energy for years and he 
is stilI going strong, 
Do not forget that helpful behavior is often nothing more than 
the attempt to build points for future security, While it might be 
natuml for such a person to give, at the same time he is giving he 
is also accumulating points which, sooner or later, will be col-
lected, 
The collection process can even be displaced-that is, 
collected from someone who doesn't owe that person a thing, 

Pandemonium 
This is often caused by frustration which leads to depression or 
aggression. Neither state can be tolerated for too long, so the 
results of the frustration build and find release in sado-masochis-
tic activities-which include extracting points from any victim. 
Note that I didn't say imlOccnt victim, for no one alive is inno-
cent. Everyone is involved in accumulating points and surviving 
Thus, every act of survival is an act of destruction. Every breath 
destroys universes. We are all murderers. 
These sado~masochistic acts include punishments dealt out 
both upon others and upon oneself. But even if a person simply 
punishes himself, his pitiful sight is punishment for all those 
around him. 
If he wishes to be helpful, his best bet is to commit suicide-
unless, of course, he learns how to be a Toxick Magician and uses 
his natural self~destructive habits in a more effective and satisfy-
ing fashion. 
If you ever have to use force to get what you want, be pre-
pared for anything. Unless you are completely assured that you 
can destroy the other person completely and with impunity, do 
not use physical force or the threat of physical force to get what 
you want. Even if you receive what you want, you will have 
made a potential enemy. 
There are exceptions. The threat of force may be necessary 
from time to time with certain schizoid, masochistic types who 
feel highly anxious unless they feel completely controlled. It will 
even be necessary to use actual force from time to time to keep 
such a person from going off the deep end. In this sense you 
might consider yourself a lifesaver. 

10 
The disparity coefficient between Toxick Magicians and regu-
lar people is enormous, and this disparity is easily observable 
even among Practitioners. 
The disparity coefficient is a number derived by complex 
mathematics which tells us the difference between how a person 
lives (observed behavior) and how he ought to live if he wishes to 
benefit himself and the planet as a whole. Thus, the disparity 
coefficient can tell us whether or not someone is a Toxick 
Magician, and then tell us how good a Practitioner he is. 
A good Manipulator is like a farmer with many fields. At any 
time he is in various stages of planting, reaping, sowing, and al-
lowing the land to rest. This is a very important model-although 
some prefer the hunter-gather model. I, for one, use and combine 
both. To be a stalker and a gatherer and a farmer is, in my view, 
an ideal formula for proper operation. Unfortunately, however, I 
learned some of my skills too late in life to take full benefit of 
them. 
As is so often said by psychologists and philosophers, 
humans go through a protracted period of "maturation" when 
compared to other species. This lengthy period of being a child 
and under the thumb of various authorities makes the human a 
prime candidate for re-instituting the infantilizing process during 
any period of his life. 
For example, consider most people's response to the Toxick 
Platitude: "Everything I Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergar-
ten." They nod their head knowingly and smile because an 
authority has endorsed as brilliance what they had always 
thought was shame. 
Most forms of learning, teaching and punishment are nothing 
more than forcing infantile and childish roles upon others. 
Most of the modern health profession is pervaded by this 
technique of infantilizing the "patient." It is especially common 
among physicians, dentists and psychotherapists. 
The most adept of these might be called "terrorist doctors." 

... , 
Pandemonium 
They are commonly found, for example, among the majority 
of gynecologists (who get a thrill from terrorizing women into 
signing off on unnecessary hysterectomies) and cardiologists who 
routinely stampede their victims into unnecessary, useless and 
dangerous invasive procedures which "must be done immedi-
ately or you could die at any moment." (This latter group has 
been so successful that the "zipper," which characterizes open-
heart surgery, has become a status symbol.) 
Most psychotherapists, of course, have always treated their 
"patients" as infants. As the field has driven out the few good 
therapists in favor of the mediocrity of the "housewife therapist," 
the opportunity for infantilization has expanded dramatically. 
Witness the self-righteousness, witch-hunt mentality of "adult 
survivors of child abuse" and the stylishness of Multiple Person-
ali tv Disorder. 
~ 
One of the key factors in understanding why people are so 
pathetic is that, during the infantile stage of development, they 
"come to constant erroneous conclusions" as to "what causes 
what." 
In other words, they learn erroneous negotiation strategies 
right from the very beginning and come up with conclusions 
about themselves, the world, and their interCOlUlections which 
they continue to use and be victims of until they are buried alive. 
The reason they survive at all is because of "slop" (i.e., most 
people have the same wrong conclusions). 
Building upon wrong conclusions leads to habits which, once 
ingrained, are difficult if not impossible to break. People's minds 
become calcified. They blindly proceed through their lives, deceiv-
ing themselves and repressing the immense spite they have accu-
mulated over all the years for continuously being treated like 
children. 
lf this is not bad enough, all humans have a collection of 
traumas and have learned to carry around a backpack of 
anxieties. 
I have often said of the human that he suffers from an auto-
immune disease. He desires oblivion while, at the same time, 

The Psychopath's Bible 
loathing the idea of losing control and his occasional feelings of 
integrity. 
He can't tolerate his condition, but has no way out short of 
self-destruction. For man, life is a blind assembly line. Each 
person thinks he is free while secretly living out the fantasies of 
his DNA. 
His needs and resentments are so intense that annihilation 
through symbolic means is often his only option. He can't flee 
and he sees no one in particular to fight. Thus the need for 
symbolic substitutions such as masochism, depression, war, 
enemies, and so forth. 
For example, there are wars on drugs, fruit flies, border inva-
sions ("illegal aliens") and even the occasional revolution. 
There is no therapy for the human condition as death, decay, 
disease, detention, and dementia always force themselves on this 
pitiful creature in one form or another. -
One solution to man's pitiful condition of dependency and 
vulnerability is llnrcissis Irl. 
Buried somewhere in every person are delusions of grandios-
ity and perfection and a desire to be admired. Although the direct 
expression of these feelings is not allowed (except through 
acceptable means), they are the basis by which the human being 
survives his dead-end condition. 
No matter what happens, each person holds on to these delu-
sions; without them he would die. The Toxick Magician is quite 
aware of these complex dynamics and uses them for all they're 
worth. 
All governments (some might assert that I should have said 
"authoritarian" governments, but this is, in fact, a redundant 
notion) count on "their" "citizens" to respond in typical infantile 
fashion. This includes identifying unconsciously with a more 
powerful force, even if this force enslaves, brutalizes and humili-
ates you. For most people, slavery is freedom. 
Thus, democracy is nothing but a ruse to hide the power and 
force of this technique. Adolph Hitler was an expert in its use. He 
knew that the German People wanted to be children with a strong 

Pandemonium 
magical father to care for them. However, the Gennan people, like 
any other group of people, would have felt offended if their nose 
was rubbed in what they had to become in order to 
what they 
believed they wanted. 
~ 
. 
The chronic process of making-and being made-the child is 
a technique at which every bureaucrat and government official is 
adept. This is fundamentally how the police operate. The Master 
is an expert in this area. 
This is particularly true when others attempt to make the 
Master Practitioner into a child. He knows how to let others think 
they are accomplishing their ends and, as they relax and expose 
themselves, the Master can strike-if he so chooses. 
However, more often than not, the T oxick Magician will save 
the information he has gained by letting others make him into a 
child and then use it at the most appropriate times. 
The method of reducing everyone to a child is primary for this 
species and pervades this planet. All life forms have the means to 
turn every situation into a potentially "infantilizing" one. 
The Toxick Magician is conscious that a boomerang effect can 
occur when someone is made aware that they have to playa 
childlike role in order to get what they want. 
Unlike most people, the Manipulator knows how 110/ to use 
his authority to excess. No act of intimidation is free of a price 
and the price for playing on the needs of adults to be children can 
be two-fold-sabotage and dependence. Often, both occur at the 
same time. 
The Practitioner is well aware of what types of people will 
respond with what reaction. Sabotage is the most common 
method. Often this takes the form of passive-aggressive behavior. 
We note this often in the American factory when workers sabo· 
tage the company's profit because they resent the role of being 
told what to do. The worker, of course, carries this home to his 
family where he has the opportunity to brutalize his wife and she 
has the opportunity to brutalize the children and the children 
have the opportunity to brutalize the pets. This is the essence of 
the nuclear family. 
66 

The Psychopath's Bible 
The entire structure of the world is a food chain of infantiliz-
ing. Everyone gets to play adult and child in various situations 
and many people relish any minor role of authority so they can 
get even. 
One way to counteract rebellious employees is to give them 
the opportunity to infantilize someone 
or to act in some role 
of authority. At one time, suggestion boxes served this function. 
However, employers must continually corne up with other tech-
niques because employees have a way of finding out how seri-
ouslv they are taken. 
rVlost 'people perform so poorly in the role of adult that they 
rarely get complete satisfaction from this process. They are so 
contaminated by their infantile roles that they overreact or under-
react in the role of authority. The Toxick Magician is well aware 
of these failures and is aptly capable of taking advantage of 
them. 
Normal people search out situations where they can be the 
king. This includes cultivating hobbies, developing special talents 
or useless knowledge, pursuing addictions, being the angry or 
bitchy shopper or the irate tenant or the bossy or cranky eater, 
joining political groups, developing severe psychological symp-
toms, and other normative activities. 
Some people are so desperate to be the King that they allow 
themselves to be severely tortured and humiliated. Even when 
they are on their knees, in'their mind they believe they are control-
iing the person who is hurting them and this is what ultimately 
provides them with satisfaction. Other types have learned how to 
yell and throw adult temper tantrums to make others feel small 
and childlike. The Practitioner should know how to handle each 
of these situations to his satisfaction. 

11 
One technique that the Toxick Magician uses is making some-
thing look harder than it is. 
Universities constantly use this ploy and the longer people 
live the more difficult things will have to be made. So, instead of 
taking three years to learn a skill which should have only taken 
one year, it will now take five years. 
Making things look harder and taking more time allows for 
better indoctrination and control of the victim who wishes to have 
a better life for himself by getting the sanction of certain groups. 
Most people want to be Certified by someone greater than 
themselves. The idea of having a life without some form of 
Certificate will become more and more terrifying as the beast 
becomes more complex and begins to fall apart. This is when the 
Manipulator begins to shine. He is always best at-"fall apart." 
The Practitioner knows how to hold out the Right Carrot and 
to create just the right amount of difficulty and humiliation to 
make an ally out of a potential enemy. 
He knows how to get the victim to identify with his causes 
and his needs and to make him grateful for all the misery he has 
been caused. 
The victim now becomes a True Believer as the Toxick Magi-
cian manipulates the parameters of fear, failure, reward, punish-
ment and success in just the right fashion. 
He knows that people have no direct access to truth, nor do 
they have the ability to find out what truth is. 
Instead they have religions, superstitions, degrees, certificates, 
test scores, badges, passports, licenses, and, of course, good old-
fashioned ancestor worship. 
These all have in common the worship of au thority and power 
which the common man attempts to manipulate through 
gestures (i.e., obsessions), hopes, beliefs and structured living. 
For example, she gets her college degree; gets married (which, 
in turn, unrolls an entire subset of additional obsessions such as 
making babies, attending school functions, arranging baptisms, 
68 

The Psychopath's Bible 
buying houses, and selecting furniture); getting a job (which pro-
vides its own subset of obsessions such as buying a car, being 
preoccupied with taxes, looking forward to holidays and vaca-
tions, attending office parties, working to improve social status, 
preparing for retirement); retirement (,vhich brings preoccupation 
with diseases, leisure, and grandchildren); and-finally-death. 
The truly funny thing about all of this is that each {llld e'Uery 
persoll thinks that he is deciding and controlling these activities 
intentionally and consciously and that they are 1I1lique in the 
historlf of the world. 
In reality, anyone with an ounce of awareness knows that 
these activities are common, banal, trite, vacuous, insignificant, 
boring and ridiculous-and make for 
sport for the 
Manipula tor. 
He will often make believe that he takes these things seriously 
as he disrupts these "unique" social patterns. 
For example, he can have a good laugh over someone's 
mother having her varicose veins stripped or John'S getting 
caught having an affair or Bill's having been diagnosed with 
manic-depressive psychosis. 
The normal man can be defined by his repetitive routines. He 
takes vacations every year-some even take them at the same 
place every year. He performs certain behaviors and avoids others 
on certain davs of the week. Humans onlv have a small set of 
events to 100;k forward to. How many Christmases can you 
tolerate!! 
If a man sat alone, bought nothing, did nothing but had the 
physical strength to act, he would either destroy himself or every-
thing about him. The fact that we measure time linearly while, at 
the same time, the days repeat endlessly until we die, attests to 
the reality of the human condition. 
Even the normal man knows, at some level, that all of this is 
meaningless and empty. Some even respond to this condition by 
having a nervous breakdown. The cure, however, is fascinating: 
few psychologists or psychiatrists would propose that the patient 
climb .\tit. Everest, sail across an ocean, quit his job, divorce his 
wife or abandon his children. 

...
Pandemonium 
Instead almost all of them will provide the drug-of-the-
moment and help the poor schnook return to the very routines 
which drove him mad to begin with. 
Understanding this is an incredibly pmoerflll opportunity for the 
admnced Toxick Magician . 

12 
While human life appears intricate and human actIvIty 
numerous for the average man, quite the opposite is true. The 
Toxick Magician knows how to clarify the habits and willingness 
of his victim in order to get him to respond to his own basic 
desires. 
He knows how to raise every need and desire to just the right 
pitch, making the victim more susceptible-even 
em-
brace his will. Each person is simply an instrument that the 
Manipulator plays. 
In addition, every Master knows how to mis-direct his activi-
ties and use the mis-directions of his victim. 
Every victim has numerous explanations to make beautiful 
and individual his automated and fearful behaviors. 
victim 
has platitudes and moralisms to hide his greed, envy and jeal-
ousy. And every victim has a morass of rationalizations and 
denial mechanisms to mask the numerous sins that keep him 
living in perpetual shame and guilt. Thus, the Toxick Magician 
knows that each person is already well-controlled (habituated 
and ritualized) and all that is needed is the right push here or 
there to create the desired effect. 
Every human is a heap of convictions which he uses to assure 
himself that he exists as a "real" "individual." In fact, this heap 
of convictions is the entire content of this bag of flesh called the 
common man, particularly when it is in the presence of others. He 
babbles on, spouting a fetid, green slime of nonsense syllables 
which constitute all that he "thinks" and "values" about what 
should be and what shouldn't be. 
The victim's first goal is to impress upon others his bounda-
ries of individuality on which, if someone happens to trespass, 
unpleasant consequences might ensue. This is simply the postur-
ing of the insecure whose convictions are nothing more than plati-
tudes and "divine" revelations indoctrinated during childhood. 
The Manipulator has no need to express his convictions-
unless it serves his purpose to control and create effects. 

Pandemonium 
For example, he might express the OpInIOn that he doesn't 
lib eli eve in welfare" while all the time letting others know how 
much he gives to charity. Doing this allows others to think they 
have discovered who someone "really is" (i.e., how they really 
work). Letting others discover who they think you are is much 
better than telling them. People tend to intensively believe what 
they find ou t for themselves, particularly if they think you have 
been hiding something from them. 
The Toxick Magician is well aware how important it is to let 
others discover things for themselves. He accomplishes this by 
leaving clues and establishing puzzles and simple contradictions 
which others can easily solve for themselves. 
He knows that each person is a detective, albeit a bad one, 
but a detective nonetheless. As people get to know one another, 
"great discoveries" by the victim dispel the distrust everyone 
fundamentallv feels toward each other. 
Subtly or 0 unconsciously each person knows he is playing a 
role. Thus, discovering the "truth" for himself helps the person 
give the Manipulator more control than intended. 
It is important to be aware that, secretly, everyone wants to 
be controlled-but in a way which is acceptable to them. Every· 
one wants to give away what they have~along with all the asso-
ciated responsibility~-as long as it is done in a way which 
appears respectable to them. After all, they must keep their 
illusion of pride-which consists of fearfulness and willfulness. 
These two factors are often combined in ways that make people 
appear more complex than they really are. 
People are not complex and the good Toxick Magician keeps 
this in mind, while at the same time giving the opposite impres-
sion to everyone he engages. He makes everyone feel unique and 
complex and pretends to take their troubles to heart. 
The more the Practitioner hangs out with the common people, 
the more he understands the cues which they use to make deci-
sions of trust and their willingness to surrender control. Remem-
ber, to be in control is frequently painful for most people. 
This requires that the Manipulator hang out with groups from 
various social strata in order to learn their cues. This may even 
72 

The Psychopath's Bible 
mean lmvering oneself to a level which normally would be unac-
ceptable. In fact, doing this from time to time is good training, 
and giving charity and alms to those one finds the most disgust-
ing is a very good technique for building the necessary character 
to deal with more powerful and dangerous encounters which are 
sure to occur in an active career. 
73 

... 
13 
The Toxick Magician understands how pride works. He 
knows that if people are forced to lower themselves unwillingly, 
there will be hell to pay at a later date. 
Some people thrive on making people lower themselves and 
giving in. In fact, making people give in is good practice for what 
not to do. Help people decide for themselves to help themselves 
by giving in to you. This is the most subtle and powerful form oi 
control. Always first help people to help themselves. If this 
doesn't work, more aggressive steps are necessary. However, even 
at the last moment, be mean in a good spirit. Always show a 
sense of good spirit no matter what you are doing. 
For practice, it can be useful to push people's convictions to 
the breaking point. If you attempt this experiment, be sure a 
good rapport has been developed between you and the victim. Be 
sure a good flow of energy has been induced and you have the 
strength and the vigor to control yourself from making unneces· 
sary emotional outbursts. Remember, your goal is to get the vic-
tim to lose control over the irrationality or stupidity of his belief. 
Before performing this activity, however, first take dancing 
lessons. DanCing through the mind of a person is very similar to 
dancing with your feet. If you can't take lessons, go to places 
where people dance and learn to watch them. 
Also learn to watch people while they arc drunk. In fact, it is 
a good idea to get drunk yourself at least once a month. This will 
give you the opportunity to see how much you are improving in 
self-control. 
When helping people to lose control, learn how to help them 
save face. Saving face is very important. I suggest learning this 
habit by almost bringing a person to their knees, and then giving 
them a reprieve. 
For example, if you gain a minor concession from someone, 
appear to reconsider what they said for a moment or hvo, and 
then tell them that they have a good point. However, remember 
that you have raised their level of arousal and tension and this 
74 

The Psychopath's Bible 
may be an opportune time to get them to give in to another issue 
which has nothing to do with your present situation. 
It is extremely important to know how to manipulate another 
person's tension level and, as with many things, timing is every-
thing. Learning how to approach people when they are unduly 
tense or relaxed is an excellent way to get what you want. 
75 

14 
The picture of the human condition and the Toxick Magician's 
means and methods for manipulating it to his ends may not 
sound romantic to many. Except, of course, to the Toxick Magi-
cian, whose sole purpose is to explore, exploit and control the 
conditions of life. 
The fact that he attempts to turn the mundane into an adven-
ture is his primary badge of honor. If a normal person reads this 
material or tries the methods described herein, instead of a badge 
of honor he will be wearing a badge of horror. 
The power and force of the influence of the Practitioner can be 
augmented in various ways. First and foremost, practice makes 
perfect. This implies that there will be many so-called "failures" 
which provide the necessary lessons for how to present and pre-
serve oneself during a failure. 
Another way of increasing power is through alignment with 
other Manipulators who have similar aims and goals. 
It is also sometimes useful to help another Toxick Magician 
accomplish his own particular end even if you do not directly 
benefit from it. In these conditions, you will have the opportunity 
to observe, from a different angle, the operations of another Prac-
titioner (and perhaps even of a Master!). 
Third, it is also useful from time to time to surround yourself 
with many disci pIes from whom you can drain resouices and 
energy. 
This tactic is especially fun if you know the dynamics among 
the people in your group. If you know each of their vulnerabilities 
and strengths and how the other members play them, you can 
drain off greater power which you will need when you find your-
in extreme and dangerous circumstances. And do not doubt 
it, you will find yourself in extreme and dangerous circumstances 
from time and time and you will need every trick in the book to 
win-or even to survive. 
As you practice "failure" and note your own reactions (par-
ticularly feelings of smallness and humiliation), you will begin to 

..... 
The Psychopath's Bible 
find ways of turning these feelings into healthy and free reactions. 
You will also learn how to use these reactions to cause severe 
pain in your adversaries. Remember, some adversaries will also 
try to reverse your power and escape from your control. The 
means which they use to accomplish this will give you deeper 
insight into their needs and most secret desires. 
Once you sense that you have gained an insight into their 
secrets, offer them some aspect of it in a way which will not 
offend them or make them look small. Once they accept your 
offer they are yours-unless, of course, they too are true Toxick 
Magicians. If this is the case, back off until you find out more or 
make a psychological alliance. 
77 

lS 
So far, the objective of practicing Toxick Magick is to provide 
relief from life for your subject, thereby assuring yourself adven-
ture and resources. 
The more often you can relieve people from responsibility in a 
way they can accept, the more likely they will allow you to drain 
them. Often they will come directly to you for draining or pun-
ishment. 
are often opportune times to refuse them. This allows 
you to build confidence in yourself and a greater sense of slavery 
in your victim. 
Fail them from time to time. Make them work harder, even 
humiliate themselves in some fashion, and then show them some 
respect and love. Sooner rather than later they vvill be eating out 
of your hand. 
Remember, always be sure to give relief at some time. Allow-
ing tension to remain for too long a period of time can damage 
your resource. Relief, even if it comes through humiliation, is "lNel-
comedo 
It is important to reinforce the idea tha t the Toxick Magician 
is not the cause of human suffering. Human suffering is the norm. 
Being numb to the depth of this suffering is normal. Being un-
aware of the stu pidity of life is a 
defense for the 
survival of this particular species. 
The Manipulator is fully aware that anyone who accepts and 
adapts to this stupidity is not a member of the futures to come 
and is nothing more than a breeding machine for more slaves. 
The Practitioner didn't invent the human condition. He is only 
taking advantage of it by helping others get what they want. The 
human condition is simply slavery-a repetition of species behav-
ior from one generation to the next. The difference between 
humans and other organisms is that there are appear to be more 
wild card possibilities-and this includes the complete annihila-
tion of the species. 

The Psychopath's Bible 
The Toxick Magician accepts these fundamentals and doesn't 
lament. Instead he helps the species to replace itself with some-
thing better, something more flexible, something stronger, some-
thing immortaL 
This will require the death of billions of people and / or the 
leaving of this particular planet. Whatever it takes, the Practitio-
ner is constantly preparing himself both in attitude and informa-
tion. However, he is not fooled-like some-~by man's inventions 
or or by man's cleverness in certain areas. 
He is completely aware that man uses all of his inventions to 
further his primitive nature, and to wait for evolution to catch up 
is pure folly. 
He attempts to force life to speed up the process of evolu-
tion-even if it costs him his own life-but he only does this out 
of choice. 
Toxick Magick is focused magic, and the Toxick Magician 
saturates the wound called mankind with his own vitality. 
He obtains this vitality by consuming the energy which others 
are more than willing to "give" away. They don't want it-it is 
too much for them and the ;vIanipulator knows just the right 
means for gathering in this lifood" and digesting it. He knows 
just the right temperature to store it and, best of all, he knows 
just hoy\' to prepare it, to make it a joyous and delightful meal. 
He knows that the easiest method for gathering in this energy 
is to help people continue to delude themselves, to help them get 
what they think they want. 
79 

16 
Everv once in a while, a Toxick Magician will run across 
someon~ who is somewhat aware of the truths of human exis-
tence. If this person has the fortitude and the willingness, the 
Practitioner can help this person to himself become a Toxick 
Magician. 
This is a particularly problematical exercise and commitment, 
and is fraught with dangers and difficulties. This exercise should 
only be taken on after deep deliberation and testing of the subject. 
It is imperative that the subject be tested in numerous ways. 
It is best if the subject is attractive in some sense, has some 
charisma and has an above average IQ. Having some special 
talent is also a good indication that the Manipulator'S time will 
not be wasted. 
But these are only preliminaries. Numerous tests must be 
passed and many skills learned before the Practitioner can be 
assured that his subject is worthy. 
However, it is also very important to keep in mind the idea of 
circles within circles. Everyone is of some usc, especially those 
who hate the Toxick Magician. Everyone can't become a member 
of the inner circle, and there is no harm in having many grades of 
practitioners. 
80 

17 
The stronger and more knowledgeable the Toxick Magician, 
the greater the tasks he can successfully complete. 
For example, he is aware that he can stir people to chaotic 
behavior by convincing them that they are getting less than what 
they are used to. He is also aware that by stimulating people to 
do more and more, while giving them nothing, can lead them into 
states of depression and hopelessness. Also, he is acutely aware 
of the danger of hope in situations which have been very 
oppressive. 
He uses these devices (among many others), to help people 
get what they really want: more for 
He pretends that he respects the rights of people and is inter-
ested in their plights. Even though most people know that this is 
a ruse, they go along with the program because it is the line of 
least resistance and allows them to express some of their frustra-
tions. This reduces the pain of their pent-up depression and 
aggression. 
As a rule, people believe they have honor and a reputation to 
protect and the Practitioner can manipulate their reactions by 
casting doubt on their honor or reputation. This can be done by 
either supporting or threatening them. Often, casting doubt by 
the method of support has the most useful benefits. 
The Manipulator is always aware how much self-delusion is 
taking place when he is engaged in any conversation. He either 
helps the self-delusion along to the point that no one believes any-
one any longer-thus ending the conversation by switching the 
topic-or enhances the self-delusion just enough to inflate the 
person's public value. 
People can't help but exaggerate their importance, even if it 
means that they only exaggerate it to themselves. At the same 
time, their self-importance is so fragile that the Toxick Magician 
must be aware of what activities or attitudes might deflate the 
potential victim. 

.. 
Pandemonium 
The Manipulator is always ready to make some form of resti-
tution for a perceived wrongdoing. Often a small apology is 
enough. At this point, it is often useful to talk abou t other people 
in a derogatory or gossipy manner. 
Give the victim the sense that you are taking him into your 
"strictest confidence." Although there is some likelihood that you 
might not be fully believed, if the person about whom you are 
gossiping is in some way competitive with your victim, you will 
be doublv believed. 
Any' type of gossip establishes bonds and, secondarily, alerts 
others that they, too, might be betrayed at a later date. Thus, the 
Practitioner always uses gossip wisely. Often he will let the other 
person do the gossiping while keeping his mouth shut. Or he 
might say something which will be heard as gossip by his victim, 
but which also has a double meaning which he can easily twist 
around if later confronted. 
He is expert at lying and confounding information. Little slips 
and small distortions make for potentially great future power 
plays which, if well orchestrated, will produce excellent results. 
82 

18 
While people scream about the importance of social justice, it 
interests them little unless they are in some way harmed. In fact, 
the idea of social justice is something about which almost every-
one is frightened. 
For most people, social justice would mean ruin since almost 
evervone has lied, stolen, distorted the truth, harmed others in 
insidious ways, and held back favors out of selfishness, greed, or 
simple meanness. Thus, from time to time, someone must be 
sacrificed to atone for and hide the sins of the group or even an 
individual. 
In cases like this, the Toxick Magician can perform miracles. 
He can help any group, no matter how small, to find a victim to 
blame and torment. 
By relieving the group of blame, he will often find them will-
ing to provide small favors which he should take as soon as they 
are offered. In some instances, delaying the acceptance of a gift is 
the best thing to do, but not in the case of scapegoating. People 
want to forget this petty part of themselves as quickly as 
possible. 
If vou do a favor for someone who sees himself as honorable 
and r~putable, be sure to get paid well in advance. These people 
have a very short rnemory when it comes to being associated with 
someone who might make them look bad in the future. 
The Practitioner is well aware that all people like to use 
reason and logic to help them follow and fulfill their whims. In 
practical terms, this means talking in moderation while always 
promising a miracle. 
Since most people have been in a chronic stote of hypnotic 
trance since childhood, it takes very little to keep them asleep. 
Thus, it is ideal to promise miracles which are associated with 
stimuli which remind them to forget the promise when the mira-
cle fails to appear in the form expected. 
Miracles will always appear in unexpected ways-which you 
can take credit for. 

... 
Pandemonium 
Of course, having a scapegoat is another means for dealing 
with failed miracles. Still another method is to mention that no 
miracle will occur and that more effort or hard work is needed for 
the desired results. 
Bu t no matter what you do, a miracle is always expected. 
This fact is based on a number of "natural laws," the first of 
which is that no one has experienced their own creation, and life 
goes on no matter what happens. 
All of this, and more, seems like miracles for which the Toxick 
Magician knows how to take credit. 
It is easy to be a miracle worker. Just allow the obvious to 
happen. Since most people are in an hypnotic trance, if you can 
just see 10% of the obvious you are a miracle worker. If you can 
see 25%, you are a God. 
People will always associate whatever precedes an event as 
the calIse of the event. As such, always let your presence precede a 
happy occurrence and always let someone else precede a painful 
one . 

19 
The Toxick Magician is well aware of the constant battle 
between aspects of the same force: the desire for complete control 
and the desire for the unpredictable-which brings about the nec-
essarv destabilization of the entire human structure. 
"~s the desire for predictability (control) increases, natural 
consequences are automatically set in motion which lead to 
destabilization or Chaos. 
This process happens both cosmically and microscopically. 
This theory doesn't assume a simple linear process within this 
gigantic struggle, but instead assumes multiple processes (which, 
from time to time, might include a sim pIe linear process). 
In other words, the mathematical functions are multiple, and 
are sometimes interactive and complex. This leads to inconsistent 
error when certain phenomena are scrutinized, since stabilization 
and destabilization are forever interacting, and something may be 
on the verge of complete destruction (metamorphosis) while 
appearing completely stable at the moment of observation. 
Humans are control freaks. The Manipulator knows that, even 
stronger than the reality of sex and fOOlt is the desire to colltro[ sex 
and food. 
Once something comes under apparent control, the organism 
seeks to control other events to the extent that it invents games 
and devices which provide the opportunity to play the control 
game. 
The Practitioner spends a good deal of tin1e analyzing the 
peculiar way(s) in which people play their control game(s). 
The desire to control is so powerful that suicide and mass 
madness are sometimes the only things which will satisfy this 
desire. 
At other times, on a more individual level, people will force a 
collapse of personality so they can begin controlling small things 
-like "not drinking for the next minute" -to get the high of being 
in control. 

Pandemonium 
Sometimes control junkies are so involuted and play such 
strange control games that it appears that control is the last thing 
they desire. In fact, this is not the case. 
Control is what they desire, even if they have to force someone 
else to take up the cause for them. The Toxick Magician is an ex-
pert in helping people stabilize and de-stabilize. He knows just 
when to introject the necessary force to accomplish his end-
which is, of course, control. 
He helps people seek destruction and death to escape the ten-
sion of living. For most people, time is tension and the clock, with 
its tight spring "forever unwinding," is an ideal model. The ten-
sion unwinds until the clock stops. 
The Manipulator knows how to hold out hope. Hope allows 
the food on the chain the illusion that time has not run out. l-Iow-
ever, hope can't be used continuously. Reality is just too much. 
Aging, death, pain, loss and fear are just too real and, sooner or 
later, the spring doesn't 'wish to be wound up again. But, in spite 
of this wish, the Toxick Magician may give it a wind or two any-
way. 
Hope springs eternal and, just as the hope is coming to frui-
tion, it is swallowed up by the monster of time. 
The Practitioner doesn't believe in the progress of human 
nature, nor does he believe in the progress of human behavior. 
The Toxick Magician operates on the premise that most people 
seek conflict, both internal and external, to the degree they can 
tolerate. 
Since most humans can't tolerate too much inner conflict 
(tension)-as it makes them too aware of time-they seek exter· 
nal causes and events to occupy themselves. Thus, ·status qllo is 
always defined in terms of the level and type of conflict and 
tension a person can tolerate. 
For example, I met one man who was so fearful of losing 
what he had gained that he simply lost it and immediately felt 
better. 
86 

r

l. , 
The Psychopath's Bible 
War serves this purpose as well. As long as conflict and ten-
sion can be identified, man is "happy." But as soon as they 
become covert or internalized, an enemy must be created. 
Externalization is one of the best 'tactics a Toxick Magician 
can employ once he knows how to build internal tension in others 
without causing a rebound effect. 
Build tension in others and help them find a scapegoat. Do 
this in small and insignificant ways until you have the power and 
ability to move people to more gross and hideous behaviors. 
Help people realize how easy it is to lose the things they have 
or want. The trick in all of this is to not become identified as the 
bearer of bad tidings-unless you are looking for people with a 
strong stomach. 
To learn better how to help people achieve the level of tension 
and conflict they can tolerate, begin by learning how to assess 
other people's moods. Once you are expert in this, learn how to 
manipulate their moods in simple ways. 
Once you have this tactic mastered so that it is second nature, 
learn to assess moods and say things from time to time which 
will have significant effect. 
Learn to say things to people indirectly. A useful way to do 
this is to communicate your message by talking to someone other 
than your victim. 
F~r example, if YOLl want to tell someone that they are an 
idiot, do not say so directly. Instead, make up a story about a 
fictitious person and tell it to another person in the same room as 
vour victim. 
. This can also be done even more indirectly by telling the story 
to someone when the victim is not even present-if you know that 
the person to whom you tell the story \\Till spread it in the direc-
tion YOLl want it to go. 
Learn to spread rumors in ways which will create concern, 
suspicion or trust. Create fires and then put them out. This tech-
nique is essential in building trust and confidence in people you 
want to use later. 

Pandemonium 
Learn to confuse people and then help them out of their con-
fusion. Remember, loyalty built on fear and hope is more reliable 
than loyalty built on friendship. 
Friendships, no matter how good and how long they have 
lasted, are bound to turn on you at critical moments. Expect no 
one to take your punishment for you and expect no one Ilot to 
take advantage of you if they can be assured that they will not be 
caught. 
People have a tendency to change the rules of the game at a 
time that is convenient for them. Always keep this in mind and 
watch for the cues which will tell you that someone is about to 
change the rules. 
If there is too much tension in a situation, be prepared for a 
rule change. If things seem too simple and easy, get ready for a 
"theft" of some sort. People like to get away with a little "steal-
ing" from time to time. Give them the opportunity, as it will 
make them feel fragmented, weak and guilty and you can use 
this to your advantage. 
These techniques will not work on a Toxick Magician. Do not 
make the mistake of miscalculating your opponents or your posi-
tion on the food chain. 
It is always unpleasant to find out that you are the one being 
eaten instead of the other way around. However, if this does hap-
pen, use it as a learning opportunity. It is rare that a person has 
the opportunity to learn from a real Master. 
88

The Toxick Magician is forever alert to the fact that, to 
increase his accuracy in manipulating common people, he must 
continually scan the environment for appropriate reinforcers. He 
must know what will increase the chances of getting others to do 
what he wants. 
Often a reinforcer can be as simple as a smile. At other times, 
however, a reinforcer can be quite complex, consisting of multiple 
categories of behaviors or items as well as multiple contingencies. 
After much self-training, the Practitioner always asks himself 
questions about the environment and the humans operating in it. 
Heis always aware of the limitations of a situation. 
He is constantly examining the important social reinforcers 
within any given context. He determines the pecking order and 
notices which people are most easily influenced by approval or 
disapprovaL 
He is especially alert to anyone in authority with excellent 
social skills as he knows that such a person could also be a 
Toxick :VIagician. 
He knows that a good Practitioner avoids direct confrontation 
and frequently speaks obliquely in order not to offend people or 
make them feel small. A person who is expert at this type of 
behavior can, at will, devastate someone by very simple means. 
Common people are eaSily hurt by someone who has been kind 
and friendly toward them and who they look up to. 
The Practitioner knows how to use discomfort at just the right 
time to influence the effectiveness of a worker or an associate. 
As a rule, a good Manipulator-or "Manager"-is secretly 
admired and envied by most of his subordinates. If the Manager 
is having problems with a subordinate, he immediately swings 
into action to correct the situation. He normally doesn't wait until 
unacceptable behavior gets worse. He uses office politics-or 
whatever else it might take-to change the behavior of the 
offender. 
89 

Pandemonium 
It is very important to realize that the Toxick Manager looks 
upon people as "cooperators
il or "offenders." He doesn't take 
any behavior personally and is willing to do just about anything 
to correct damages and reduce the probabilities of negative out-
comes. 
A good Manipulator knows how to change the offender's 
behavior by having him perform tasks unrelated to the offensive 
behavior. Some minor privilege may be manipulated, although 
not taken away. 
An event that the offender was looking forward to might be 
delayed by some flaccidentfl-orchestrated by the Toxick 
Manager. 
He is well aware that some people do not respond well to ver-
bal communications and, thus, he requires a large bag of dirty 
tricks to correct the offensive behavior. 

21 
The Toxick Magician is always aware that, no matter how 
large a person may be, no matter how many degrees or years of 
experience he may have, common people are fundamentally chil-
dren and must be treated as children without their becoming 
aware of the process. 
One of the main themes of childhood is the gaining of infor-
mation. This is called "learning" and adults do a fine job of mak-
ing children stupid by their methods of indoctrination. 
Compared to adults, children have minimal information. On 
the other hand, children have less perceptual and cognitive bias 
than adults. 
For both the adult and the child, information is constantly 
being redefined, not only in content, but also in terms of how real 
information is defined. Put simply, real inform.ation consists of 
learning how to ignore and select data. 
For example, forty years ago few children had much informa-
tion about sex. Today, sex is so common that it is not really infor-
mation at all. Once everything becomes available to everyone, it 
becomes nothing for everyone. 
People appear more sophisticated today but, as the gross 
level of sophistication rises, the real information becomes more 
hidden and valuable. 
When vou hear em advertisement II disclose", "Be the first to 
knOiv what the markets are doing," remember that it is being 
heard by millions of people at once. Where is the real informa-
tion? It's mostly in the fact that millions of people each think they 
are hearing the real infonnation first. 
This is the illusion that TV provides: that you and those 
around you-alone-are being entertained. In fact, the more that 
people feel isolated yet tied together, the easier it is for the Master 
to reign. 
He knows that real information "can't" be known. If real 
information could be had by everyone, it would immediately 
become worthless. Informa tion, by its very definition, im plies 

Pandemonium 
ignorance and exclusivity. We require ignorance m order to be 
informed. 
What most people mil information is nothing more than 
another level of noise. Some optimists who are aware of the prob-
lem simply state tha t the information is available but the use of 
the information is still dependent on the intelligence of the popu-
labon. Mass intelligence is nothing more than mass information. 
Zero is still zero. 
What is fascinating about this entire process is that everyone 
thinks they know more but, in fact, they know less. 
Moreover, what they do know is next to useless and is often 
mis-information. Thus, each new level of information is nothing 
more than a higher level of non-sense. What we generally call 
information is nothing more than a higher level of incompetence. 
People forget that, like individuals, each civilization rises to 
its highest level of incompetence. 
The Toxick Magician knows that if you help someone or 
something long enough, it will finally wish to be left alone. At 
that point help it a bit more and then drop it. At that point it will 
become like England: a land of non-entities with expensive titles. 
This is the meaning of what we call information. The more 
teachers, the dumber the students. 
Every mother's son simply knows more buzz words. But does 
that mean he knows what the buzzing 
Is it a bee or a bomb? 
How much real wealth and how much real information does 
anyone really have? And, more importantly, how long will they 
have it? Wealth which can be easily stolen is not wealth at all. 
Most people are simply storehouses for a master thief. 
With more and more reliance placed on devices which can be 
easily intercepted and manipulated, how long will it take for a 
Toxick collapse? These issues are important considerations for 
~M~~ 
His goal is to help information become more worthless while 
creating the illusion that it has more value. lIe does this by help-
ing people ask more questions in very well-controlled and well-
defined situations. 
92 

The Psychopath's Bible 
He also promotes the collapse by helping criminalize behavior 
which interferes with the information highway. 
He knows that the criminalization of human behavior serves 
one primary purpose: the destruction of the system which defines 
crime. The more criminals, the more resources necessary to con-
trol crime and criminals. The more resources required, the more 
economic disruption and, thus, the more criminals required to fill 
the gaps in the system. 
93 

22 
All mega-systems become top-heavy and chaotic. This is 
much like a family with more children than funds available to 
feed them. The parents become desperate to hold together the 
fortress that their egos had built. 
The Toxick Magician knows that every structure serves to 
keep people hI as well as out. As long as there are doors, there 
will be prisons. 
The key is to 
the prisoner to pay you for services that he 
could provide better for himself. Thus, the first task is to teach 
him that he can't care for himself and requires assistance. Once he 
accepts his dependency on metaphysical grounds and submits, 
his ownership is guaranteed. 
Slavery, as we knew it before (for example) the Civil War in 
the U.s., was a bad thing. It made us aware of something best 
forgotten-universal, hierarchical slavery. 
When overt slavery ended, we lost our example of what slav-
ery was really all about. Slavery slipped back into our uncon-
SCIOUS. 
All good Practitioners know how to manipulate the common 
man's desire to be a slave while maintaining the illusion of being 
a free person. It is better for the common man to think that he is 
free as he is held in the arms of his caretaker. 
Democracy is the best political system of slavery ever in-
vented. In a democracy, the slaves believe that they are "free" 
and have a "voice" in their affairs. Thus, they are z~ilIil1g slaves 
and, as such, the possibility of a revolt is much less than in an 
overt system of slavery. 
This simple fact is supported by the number of books which 
have been written about self-esteem. The desired results are im-
possible to obtain since a slave can only have false self-esteem. 
And even this is a theft accomplished by identifying with his 
master. 
There are no free people-only slaves who have more privi-
leges than others. Even the masters are slaves to their greed and 
94 
J

The Psychopath's Bible 
terror. Control over the lives of millions doesn't free one from hav-
ing to pay the price. 
There are no real successes in this world as we are all bound 
in the brotherhood of death. If you have to diel you have failed. 
95 

23 
One of the most important ideas to get through your head is 
that most people do not feel pain from being used-and mis-
used-by a good Toxick Magician. If they feel any pain at all, it is 
minimal. 
The fact of the matter is simple: people are so familiar with 
abuse and misuse that they are unaware of it. This is worth 
repeating. Most people are so used to being abused that for ail 
intents and purposes they are unaware that they are being 
abused and, in most cases, expect it. 
More interesting is the fact that, when they do feel abused, 
they get upset by events and actions which make them unaware 
of their real condition and the chronic abuse which thev "suffer." 
Moreover, they take the events of life, both goo~i and bad, 
very personally. This fact alone contributes to their overall sense 
of malaise and stupidity. They are hard-vvired to suffer and, in 
most cases, to suffer without much awareness. A deadened 
suffering is the norm and is expected. 
Understanding the origin of human behavior is like looking for 
a place to land a plane when the earth below is covered by a 
huge, thick cloud. Human behavior makes no sense from a hedo· 
nic point of view, nor does it make sense from any altemative 
idea. 
The human being is an unfinished entity, burdened by a 
strange mix of cortical and sub-cortical processes and a body 
which requires immense artifices to protect and assure it of its 
immortality. 

24 
One thing we know-very well-is that most humans have 
been hired on as extras. They are needed for this scene or that, for 
a few moments here and tl1ere, and then they are gone. In fact, 
they are not even forgotten-because to be forgotten you first 
have to be remembered. 
Most people are extras who somehow have become deluded 
into thinking they are stars-albeit burnt-out ones. 
A few people are not extras on the stage but are stunt men, 
hired to play dangerous roles for the real star. But even stunt men 
are rare. 
It's funny to walk into a bank or a grocery store and watch 
the tellers and clerks. A good Toxick Magician knows how to 
watch them and manipulate them. He knows that they feel that 
they have a little power-and they do-but they are taught not to 
abuse it, because it is a sign of bad taste. 
Just watch them drool as they count out the money or say 
"no" to someone. Then watch them hang their little heads as they 
gaze blankly at their paychecks. 
Nonetheless, each is a star, each has a room somewhere where 
he is king. Somewhere people recognize them as they perform 
their daily chores. Watch the smiles on their faces when you rec-
ognize them. Watch how some try to hold back their enthusi-
asm-like a dead puppy dog. 
Others flaunt their authority like a bit player who has 30 sec-
onds on second camera. But the Practitioner knows who these 
people really arc. He, and even they, are not completely fooled. 
They are the extras, the hired hands. They perform a service 
which some ape or machine could do as well-and someday, 
very soon, will. They are completely expendable, and those higher 
up the ladder know all too well how their middle management 
part can quickly revert to head clerk. 
A Toxick Magician will treat such people as important or 
unimportant depending on his mood and wha t he wants from 
them. 
97 

Pandemonium 
Oh yes, Toxick Magicians have moods, too. And yes, they like •
to see the extras twitch once in a while. After all, life is tough, and 
watching someone squirm a bit can sometimes be uplifting-
particularly if they are interfering with your wilL 
However, more often than not, it pays to be "nice/' to the 
hired help. The Manipulator is well aware that the clerk can 
become a monster once someone in authority allows him to play 
a short part as boss. There is nothing more funny than seeing the 
little man inflate his chest and try to walk in shoes that are too 
long and not wide enough. 
After his first day on the new job everyone feels sorry for him. 
Somehow he doesn't fit the part. 
But soon enough no one will notice the difference. Many of the 
extras will have gone, some of the audience will have moved on, 
and the star-well, who can tell? Is her new billing for real, or is it 
just another temp job, waiting until someone better comes along? 
In a strange way it takes a lot of strength or a powerful 
numbing agent to realize how insignificant you really are, what 
minor roles you play, and how everything you "love" and cherish 
can be taken away from you in the wink of a gnat's eye. 
But this is the simple truth, and most people are constantly 
made unaware of their real situation. This keeps them tame and 
prevents them from revolt.

25 
Every Toxick Magician finds out exactly what things a person 
is frightened to lose. And one of the most obvious and primal is 
their apparent sense of freedom. 
That this feeling consists of nothing but the "freedom" to 
choose more or less what to eat, to come and go as they please 
(more or less), to say what's on their mind (more or less), to buy 
what they want, to 'stay up late, to have sex, to try something 
illicit once in a while, to spend money on things they like, is a 
joke. Is this all there is? 
As a grown-up he is acutely aware (and yet, must keep secret 
from himself) that all these privileges which have been given to 
him, these "rights" which he has "earned" -can, all at once, for 
no good reason, be taken away. 
Why must this be kept secret? 
Because he has been told that he can lose them only if he 
deserves to-that is, if he does something wrong, if he disobeys. 
The Practitioner is completely aware of this horrifying lie and 
often needs to go no further in planning his strategies. 
He knows what everyone is frightened of and why they are 
frightened. He knows that people believe that they have been 
giI'en rights and privileges and, from their personal experience, 
they are completely correct. Of course, in reality no one has given 
anyone anything. 
The Master has it one up on everyone: he knows that he really 
doesn't own anything. He knows that everything is borrowed-
including his life. 
Common man, however, always believes that which never 
was a reality. This ability comes from a strong imagination and 
the inability to distinguish the existential condition of his life from 
his hopes, wishes and dreams. In this sense, common man lives in 
limbo. He can neither climb the mountain, nor descend to helL 
99 

26 
If, from time to time, the Toxick Magician sounds like some-
one who concocted Huxley's Brave New World, let me assure you 
he is not. Indeed, as a matter of perversity, we might assume that 
Huxley was himself a Master with a keen knack for observing 
human behavior and who projected forward from what he saw. 
While common man is competitive, greedy and ambitious-
unlike Huxley's common worker-bee-this is only a small anom-
aly. Common man, as so many brilliant and stupid authors have 
noted, is simply a domesticated primate. And the zoo runs quite 
well, most of the time, until any of the many zero hours is 
reached-at which time pandemonium breaks loose. 
While common man is domesticated, seething within him are 
all the necessary components of destruction which allow him to 
be controlled and, at the same time, allow him to be self-
destructive. In this way, common man has the potential to act as 
if he were a sower of discord and disobedience, but this remains 
well under control--except during certain times of the year and in 
certain places. 
Other than pathological individuals (including Toxick Magi-
cians who have lost contro1), common man is nicely controlled by 
bouts of depression, temper tantrums, guilt, sorrow, terror and 
fear. The result of all of these emotions: common man is nulli-
fied-which allows for his ability to perform the rather pathetic!
and puny tasks to which he and others have given significance.

CPC 176.a9: Keep in mind that 90% of all humans are 
nothing more than talking, breeding monkeys in costume, 
They are constantly being tossed between greed and fear. 
Rules to keep in mind: 
a. You will find a person greedy, or satisfied for the 
moment; you will find a person fearfuL or secure for the 
moment. If both fear and greed are satisfied. you will find a 
person bored/ seeking or depressed...... If either/or both 
fear and greed are active you will find a person motivated ... 
If over-active you will find the person manic and/or 
depressed... Learn to identify these states from observa-
tion ... and then learn how to manipulate one state into the 
other. .....

The Psychopath's Bible 
b. Do not pay attention to what they say; attend only to 
what they have done and what they are doing. If you find 
yourself getting lost in their ideals, titles, and possessions, 
simply imagine them in diapers sucking on a bottle, or lying 
quietly in their grave. Always keep in mind that humans are 
animals. Think of everyone as a five-year-old. 
c. Finally, never be fooled by their education or their 
talents ...... They don't know how to apply their learning to 
themselves or others once removed from their roles & 
labels. Remember. they live and "think" through labels and 
are incapable of perceiving reality clearly. This means that 
you can get them to jump through hoops by simply manip-
ulating their labels ...... If you find them doing something 
which interferes with your plans. simply "throw" them a 
tasty label and watch them munch their way through it. 
Design Errors & the World of Unruly Chance 
The frontal lobes-the executive, rational thinking centers-
are easily influenced by the lower brain, while the lower brain is 
not easily influenced by the execu tive, thinking centers. This alone 
has such overwhelming implications that volumes could, and 
should, be written. 
What we think and the thoughts we have are motivated-
distorted by our innate nature, but not the other way around. The 
primary forces are fear, aggression and power. These traits are 
present in everyone ...... use them for your benefit. Reflect well! 
We are inherently irrationat although we like to fancy our-
selves as rational beings ...... the truth is simple: we are irrational 
beings capable of rational thought. 
In addition, the protracted state of dependency and defense-
lessness of the human infant make it highly susceptible to im-
printing and early learning which is increasingly difficult to erase 
as the organism matures. Thus, the errors and irrationality of the 
previous generation are easily passed forward. The belief that 
education can modify these early errors and innate tendencies are 

Pandemonium 
more a dream than an actuality. So-called "socialization"-
which is innate for humans-simply disguises what is really there 
and makes it more difficult for us to redesign ourselves ..... . 
We are the only living creatures on earth that have the ability 
to re-design ourselves. However, this fact horrifies the monkey-
man. Few humans can think clearly about their own lives and 
thus truly transform themselves into the higher type. 
Another difficulty is that the lower brain centers not only talk 
to and influence the higher brain centers, but also talk within and 
between themselves. This means that, while some early condi-
tioning can be modified, under intense stress the lower centers 
activate previous learning within and behveen the lower brain 
centers. 
Another design problem is that we are fundamentally social 
animals. The parts of the brain in which memories are stored are 
at various distances from the part of the brain associated with 
emotional activity: closest are the memories related to human 
relationships; ne;t closest are the memories related to animals; 
and next are the memories associated with tools. This means that 
our highly dependent periods of imprinting act as if they are 
more or less hard-wired. Research on the brains of stroke patients 
show that the memory centers associated with lower social brain 
activity are physically closer to the emotional brain than memories 
associated with tools. This has vast and broad implications. 
Write one concise paragraph about what these implications might 
be. 
Was Aristotle the First Psychopath? 
"A person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much 
and deserves much ... He that claims less than he deserves is 
small-souled ... The truly great-souled man must be a good 
man ... 
Greatness of soul seemS ... <1 crowning ornament of all the 
virtues ... Great honours accorded by persons of worth will 
afford [the greal-souled 1111111J pleasure in a moderate degree: he 
will feel he is receiving only what belongs to him, or even 
less, for no honour can be adequate to the merits of perfect 
110 

The Psychopath's Bible 
virtuE', yet all the same he will deign to accept their honours, 
because they have no greater tribute to offer him. 
Honour rendered by common people and on trivial 
grounds he will utterly despise, for this is not what he 
merits ... He therefore to whom even honour is a small thing 
will be indifferent to other things as \vel1. lIence great-souled 
men are thought to be haughty... 
' 
The great-souled man is justified in despising other 
people-his estimates are correct; but most proud men have 
no good ground for their pride ... He is fond of conferring 
benefits, but ashamed to receive them, because the former is a 
mark of superiority and the latter of inferiority. 
He returns a service done to him with interest, since this 
will put the original benefactor into his debt in turn, and 
make him the party benefited. The great-souled are said to 
have a good memory for any benefit they have conferred, but 
a bad memory for those which they have rec!:.'ived {since the 
recipient of a benefit is the inferior'of his benefactor, whereas 
they desire to be superior) ... 
It is also characteristic of the great-souled men never to ask 
help from others, or only with reluctance, but to render aid 
willingly; and to be h"lUghty towards men of position and 
fortune, but courteous towards those of moderate station ... and 
to adopt a high manner with the former is not ill-bred, but it is 
vulgar to lord it over humble people ... He must be open both 
in love and in hate, since concealment shows timidity; and 
care more for the truth than for what people will think; ... he is 
outspoken and frank, except ,vhen speaking with ironical self-
deprecation, as he does to common people. He will be incapa-
ble of living at the will of another, unless a friend, since to do 
so is slavish ... He does not bear a grudge, for it is not a mark of 
greatness of soul to recall things against people, especially the 
wrongs they have done you, but rather to overlook them. He 
is ... not given to speaking evil himself, even of his enemies, 
except when he deliberately intends to 
offence ... Such 
then being the great-souled man, the corresponding character 
on the side of deficiency is the small-souled man, and on that 
of excess the vain man."

Pandemonium 
And what might a vain man be? Someone who deserves little 
and demands a lot. 
CPC356.0: "It is smarter to give than to receive." However. 
giving too much will create hostility in the reCipient. It often 
becomes a debt which the person can't pay back-except by 
harming you. But learn how to use this: give too much and, 
if you are punished, use it to your benefit.. .... guilt is its 
own reward. 
CPC689.we: Although it is important to express strong 
feeling from time to time, doing so too often will make you 
seem weak in the eyes of others. Not being able to control 
the expression of your emotions will cost you dearly. Time 
your temper tantrums-throw one when least expected, 
then ask to be forgiven ...... Most often, you won't. 
CPC974.0: When it is time to punish someone, decide 
whether or not an audience should be present. Humiliating 
someone in public can make a docile dog more docile, but a 
vain and bitter dog revengeful. Be sure to understand the 
nature of your victim. Learn to be an expert in using the 
"nature survey" provided below. 
CPC863.0: Treat an inferior fairly: however, do not let him 
know that you know how he really feels about himself. Keep 
in mind that most people feel inferior. This is evidenced 
both by those who frequently act out and by those who ap-
pear very humble. The humble type is bitter and more dan-
gerous. Remember, the humble person prides himself on 
his humility. When a person is being especially humble. be 
silly ...... If he looks hurt.. .... tell him you are sorry ...... and 
say that your laughter was not directed toward him ... This 
will make him distrust you and make mistakes.

The Psychopath's Bible 
CPC009.7: Let weaker people help you in insignificant 
matters. Be sure to show a little more gratitude than the 
person deserves. 
CPC231.99a: As most people are sheep, kind words are 
both cheap and effective. Use them at the right time but 
also randomly ...... use them when the person is behaving 
badly ... I once transformed a professor by telling him his 
hostile behavior was simply the only way he knew how to 
tell people he really cared ... He agreed. I was the only per-
son to understand him. He was in my debt. 
CPC052.76: Treat a man who is full of himself with occa-
sional random praise. Never praise him for what he does 
well, but only for what he does poorly. 
CPC874.81: Treat petty people with power with kindness 
and respect.. .... but be cautious of over-indulging them ... 
They are acutely aware of how dependent they are on their 
titles and their superiors. When a policeman gives you a 
. ticket, tell him you are going to write a letter to his superi-
ors telling them how he turned an unpleasant experience 
into a humane encounter. Get a pen out and write down his 
badge number, the time and place of the ticket, etc .... You 
will scare and confuse him ... Be gracious ......

In the reality of the moment man is naked. He looks for power 
over himself and his environment. His power of creativity is so 
great that he creates ideas and ncts as if they ltape nn illdependent 
existence. He believes them to be true-independent of his will to 
create them. When the mortar hardens he is trapped-having 
forgotten that he has made the concrete.

Man is particularly creative in the areas of metaphysics. He 
creates beginnings, endings, values, purposes, morals, causes, 
time, justice, things-in-themselves, laws, order, right, wrong; and 
then he forgets that they are llis inventions. If he remembered that 
he invented them., his pain would be overwhelming. He would 
"live" in nihilism or he would become our hero: the psychopath. 
CPC3593.5: The human brain is hungry for causality. This 
is a primitive survival mechanism which. through great suf-

job is to provide people \\Tith the causalities which best suit 
your purposes. Lacking explanations for both good and bad 
events, humans invent ··causes." Inventing "reasons" like 
god, spirits, and a morass of other nonsense fill the void 
that fear and the inability to think have created. Creating 
causes which involve intrigue, enemies. bias. etc. are par-
ticularly interesting for these infantile creatures. \\then 
events occur which have no obvious cause. help people find 
"answers" which suit you. This method is particularly good

An example of a cure: Pity 
The cure is to show you how your pity for others is simply a 
device to cover up your own vulnerability. Your sighs and groans 
of concern are simply for yourself. You support weakness 
because vou are too weak to stand the blade of the knife as it 
passes through your illusions. And what is this illusion? That 
your desire to overcome yourself-the desire for power over 
yourself and life -has now enslaved you. And how do you 
maintain your illusions? Forgetfulness. Ask yourself how many 
people do you "keep" around you to support your enslavement? 
This is one purpose of the family. 
'rhe Altruist 
You have convinced yourself that you are nothing and wish 
everyone else to be nothing. You are vain and weak and hide 
behind your concern for mankind. Do not feel guilty for your 
wealth and accomplishments; don't apologize by pretending to 
yourself that it is for the benefit of others. 
The Lover of Man 
If you really love man and wish to help him-stick him with a 
pitchfork. Stick him hard enough so he can hear his own screams 
-stick him hard and if he hears himself cry and drops the illu-
sion, it does not matter what else happens-it can only be in the 
service of him. There is no more time to string the beast along. 

Pandemonium 
Stick him or leave him alone. Show him how creative and power-
ful he has been in creating his heavens and hells. 
CPC4325.9: Avoid helping people improve themselves 
unless you value them or want them indebted to you. Keep 
in mind that most people will not improve themselves no 
matter what you do ... In fact, you can destroy them if you 
help them too much ... Be kind from time to time ..... . 
The Egoist 
The brain that creates beauty also creates tragedy. The brain 
that solves the riddle of the cosmos and the mathematics of 
quantum electrodynamics also creates the myths that destroy, 
weaken, enslave, ensnare and paralyze. The psychopath acknowl-
edges that he is born a fool and is living in an insane asylum. He 
does not seek to make sense of the senseless, he does not look to ' 
find reason in chaos. Being convinced that those about him are 
nuts, he commits to the law of the self rather than the blatherings 
of the herd. 
You know about those "huddled masses yearning to be free"? 
Well, the psychopath refuses to be huddled, he refuses to be one 
of the masses, he refuses to yearn. The psychopath does not 
yearn-he docs, he is. The psychopath says violence and compul-
sion are in the slave and his master-freedom is in me. I choose 
freedom and I will live it. The psychopath does not advertise his 
specialness-he knows that the masses must destroy the differ-
ent. He prospers in secret away from the envious 
of the herd. 
CPC86.av: Learn what concerns the sheep and offer them 
assistance; and always let them know that they deserve the 
handout. Be sure to turn every weakness into a virtue. 
every failure into a success. Never forget that reality is 
that last thing people want to know about.

The Psychopath is Not the Sociopath 
Diction<'lry definitions notwithstanding, there is a simple dif-
ference between the psychopath and the sociopath: the sociopath 
is against people and himself. He is dependent, he needs to harm 
others to be himself. 
The psychopath exists for himself ...... other people are simply

You've heard about people who are co-dependent? How 
about people who are co-il1depe11dellt. The psychopa th needs 
others for their vallles, not for their weaknesses. The psychopath 
lives, others exist. To steal from Thoreau, the mass of men leads 
lives as corks on the ocean of life; the psychopath is the ocean. 
The psychopath does not look to others to create his happiness; 
he creates his own.

No matter what your position or title, you can be broken 
when it suits those who have absolute immunity to employ

For most people, finding truth is not what it is all about. 
What is important is the appearance of order-known by lawyers 
as "due process" ..... . 
Due process simply means going through the prescribed 
motions to soothe the terror of the sheep. However, the results are 
the same as the threat of a firing squad: obey or else. (In passing, 
when I was taking a post-doctoral course in criminal justice, we 
were asked to write a lengthy paper comparing various laws by 
cultures, countries, states, etc. We were asked to find what was 
common amongst them. Some students wrote "laws against 
murder," etc. I simply wrote: "OBEY." This is the common 
fundamental factor of all laws: "OBEY ... or else!") 
120 

The Psychopath's Bible 
A number of sociologists have disagreed with me. They have 
said that laws against murder and rape are fundamental and 
necessary. (Oh, really? Every feudal society has at least one class 
which can commit murder and rape with impunity-as long as it 
is done outside their class.) Regardless of their factual inaccu-
racy, however, they have missed the point. "What is the purpose 
of law," I ask? Usually they give lengthy answers involving issues 
such as "social order." They do not seem to understand that, 
underlying all law (whether the Torah with its 613 laws, or US 
Federal law; and regardless of what the law is) its "metastruc-
ture" is Obey the Law. If you don't obey the law there are conse-
quences which, of course, are backed by the threat of violence. It 
does not matter what is obeyed, as much as that you must obcy-
-from cradle to grave. Thus, the sociologist must recognize that 
whatever comprises the social fabric, its fundamental nature is 
obedience to whomever is in charge. 
CPCa231.9: The psychopath must be able to act as if he is 
socialized while. at the same time. quietly observing and 
acting from a pOSition of social indifference. He must act 
involved in the petty concerns of those around him while 
standing back, pulling the strings. Who said, "I stood

Listen to the news for one hour every day for a month ...... but 
listen as you have never listened before. Make a recording of at 
least two different news channels; compare and contrast their 
styles, define their basic assumptions about human nature, and 
their assumptions about what the audience believes. Define their 
style of manipulation ... pay close attention to who pays for their 
time. 
Dupe Alert 
There are three ways to lie: by deliberate misstatement; by 
leaving out relevant facts; by adding irrelevant facts. News pro-
grams use all three methods . 
. The New York Times often lies by misstatement. One famous 
example was their defense of Fidel Castro as an "agrarian re-
former" when it was well known that he was a communist. 
Lying by leaving out relevant facts is shown in the reporting 
of the shootings at Columbine High School. Almost no one 
pointed out that teachers were forbidden to have guns and, there-
fore, the students had lots of time to kill the maximum number 
of people because everyone at the school was defenseless. The 
number of people killed was a result of gun control which 
prevented any self-defense. 
Lying by adding irrelevant "facts" is shown by the talk of the 
looting at the Baghdad Museum. Most public artifacts had been 
moved out of the museum before the war started and the great-
est number of missing exhibits were from the locked vaults for 
which keys were only in the possession of the museum execu-
tives. But the news programs report that thousand of exhibits 
were missing and showed pictures of smashed vases. 
Without being a news-junky, you can't be expected to know 
all the lies; but you can listen to all news with the assumption in 
mind that at all times you are being lied to, manipulated, and 
treated like a member of the unwashed (m)asses. Do not become

experts and have few facts ...... Help idiots believe that they are

In the real world, with real people, there are a number of pas, 
sible answers to any question; but before we get to those answers, 
we ask, is tlie question really a question? 
Never assume that simply because some words are strung 
together to give the appearance of a question that it is a question. 
For example, "Does god exist?" Although this looks like a ques-
tion it isn't. Why? 
Could we ~et up an experiment to demonstrate that god 
exists? If you can't devise an experiment to demonstrate that 
something exists, the entire issue becomes absurd. 
By the very definition of god, its existence can't be proven ... 
God must be believed in and, as such, the so-called question is 
absurd. Another interesting point: the phrase "does god exist?" 
can only be looked at mythologically (i.e., pre-history); or relig-
iously (Le., belief with historical events-assumed calendar time); 
or philosophically (i.e., real calendar time) and requires "proof"-
that is, it must be answered yes or no, but the answers are often 
flawed and incorrect. Why? Because arguments based on the 
mythical, religious and philosophical levels are loaded with a 
pyramid of hidden assumptions. Another problem is that often 
these "proofs" are simply analogies: e.g., if there is a watch, there 
has to be a watchmaker. The watch exists so, therefore, someone 
had to make it. But argument by analogy is no argument at all. 
All attempts to prove that god exists by reason, logic, alld 
deduction are false-they involve massive logical errors. 
All of this leads us to the world of the psychopa th and the 
hard-won world of science (Le., actuality); if it can't be answered 
empirically, it isn't a legitimate question at the present time. The 
psychopath is an empiricist. He lives in the world of actuality 
and not the world of metaphysics.

Danger: 
Thinking Causes Brain Growth 
Proofs come in different flavors. Other than chocolate, vanilla, 
and strawberry there are existence proofs, causality proofs, 
statistical proofs, and best-fit proofs. 
Memorize these-
Evolution uses a best-fit proof. 
Psychology uses a statistical proof. 
Astronomy uses a causality proof. 
God requires an existence proof. 
So, if a question is a question, we can attempt to find an 
answer and, broadly speaking, the answers can fall into a number 
of categories: yes, no, maybe, sometimes, don't know at this time. 
But life isn't as simple as that. A question that can be answered 
requires specific definitions for each term. Thus, it must specify 
who, what, where, how, and when before any meaningful answer 
can be given. For example the question, "Did Dr. Hyatt write this 
sentence?" is a real question; we have a who and a what.. .and we 
can specify where and how and we can define what proof would 
be needed to demonstrate that it was Dr. Hyatl who wrote this 
129

sentence. So the question is legitimate and we can investigate and 
find an answer: yes, no, can't be determined, maybe, I don't 
know.

Most human beings have a secret "entitlement program: 
Deep down they believe that they are owed. The owing can 
take any form. so be alert. Learn to reinforce their feeling of

The Psychopath's Bible 
Find your own entitlement program ... 
Right along with the entitlement program is the "precious 
program." This program states that. no matter who and 
what I am, no matter how much I claim I hate myself, my 
personality is unique and "precious." Help people believe 
that they are even more precious then they believe they are. 
This will keep them waiting for the mystery reward from 
heaven. and prevent them from changing their way of life. 
The precious personality program guarantees failure. To 
change, the pain of disintegration is required. As long as 
they perceive that their attitudes, habits and halo are pre-
cious, the necessary painful experiences required for 
change can't be effective. 
Fjnd your precious personality program. 
Finally, not only do people feel entitled and precious, they 
believe that they are individuals-and many will have to 
show you how individual they are. Some will reject doing 
something your way even if doing so would yield a large 
potential profit. Instead they will do it their way to show 
you what an individual they are-even if it means failure. 
We have often enjoyed helping people do it their way ......

TRUISM: In this world, ultimate flexibility and adaptability 
are essential. However, every adaptation must be an ad-
justment to the 
moment~it shouldn't exist in granite. 
When the moment is gone. the adjustment is gone. The 
moral idealist will always lose to the man of passion, 
commitment and goal: the psychopath. A man who 
i loves his work is a rare man indeed and he will always 
triumph over the moralist-the man who does his work 
for the "right" reason. 
What does this mean? Write it in your journal. 
The Secret 
• CPC7567 .w: Be capable of anything, at anytime, anywhere. 
Your first investment is yourself. Be the bank, banker and 
the depositor. Examine your books before you go to sleep 
each night and, while sleeping, devise plans for increaSing 
your net worth. Help others make deposits in your bank. 
You can help them to do this by getting them to believe that 
they are helping themselves by helping you. Learn to give 
meaning to other people's lives .. .let them help a little. 
CPCl.h8: You must learn everything you can, believe every-
. thing others believe. and then believe nothing. You become 
the chameleon while everyone else is becoming some-

is necessary to expand himself and his life.

The Psychopath's Math 
Mathematicians refer to something they call "a zero-sum 
game." That is, every winner implies a loser. Like poker. 
Psychopaths have a "one-sum game." That is, 1 win and you 
can either win or lose depending on your own psychopath 
quotient. It is nice if we both win, but my job is to see that I win 
and your job is to see that you win. Psychopaths cooperate easily 
because they don't have an interest in the other person's losing. 
Non-psychopaths want either the other person to win (at their 
134 

The Psychopath's Bible 
own altruistic expenseL or they want both to win (and thus 
usually both lose), or they want to win while the other person 
loses. Homo norma/is dies waiting for his turn to come. Homo 
psychopathis doesn't wait-he lives life to his fullest advantage all 
along. 
The goal of life is living. If you think the goal of life is to get to 
the afterlife, then give this book to someone who deserves it. 
If you think the goal of life is to impress someone with your 
possessions or looks or intelligence or. .. then you are not living-
you are a circus act. 
CPC357.7: If you are successfuL buy toys which others 
approve of. Use symbols which instill respect in the minds 
of the weak. Wear cheap clothes from time to time. but 
make them look expensive ...... show others how much you 
need them to approve of you ...... but always do this in indi-
rect ways. Appear to be working on something impor-
tant.. .... but are having a hard time. See if you can get 
someone to take an interest in your insane project.. .... 
CPC4141.k: If you have a lot of money, use it to support 
your secret projects ...... When people ask you for money, 
tell them that it is tied up for your children's education ...... 
Always give them a value that they value. not a value that 
you value ...... Keep your real values to yourself and only 
share them with people worthy of them. 
CPC970.p: Give people the opportunity to disappoint you

Belief: Something believed or accepted as true, especially a particular 
tenet or a body of tenets, simply becallse a persoll, cw authority, or a 
number of persons assert it is tme. Accepting a string of words as I'Cllid

What are some of the most misused words? Stop now! Don't 
continue reading! Determine the most misused word and then 
check it below. 
STOP BEFORE LOOKING 
Believe? Think? Want? Love? Must? Cannot? Feel? 
Let us take, for example, the word "feel". People treat the 
word as though it were a magic potion that excuses all desires, 
whims, impulses, mistakes in thinking, irrationality, and igno-
rance. All you have to do is throw in "I feel" before any statement 
and then the statement is unchallengeable. "] feel defeated and so 
I 11111 defeated and there is no possible course of action." "r feel 
you don't love me and that proves you don't love me." "I feel I 
can't live up to being a psychopath and therefore there is no 
reason to even start." 
Most so-called feelings are not feelings at all-they are ran-

which reveal a lack of knowledge.

Another Word About Language 
Most statements, in most languages, are actually metaphors. 
It is easy to mistake metaphor for fact. Here is an example. You 
are looking at a picture that shows a person and a hill. The 
person appears closer to the camera than the hill. We say "the 
person is in front of the hill." That statement is actually a meta-
phor. Hills do not have fronts and backs. It is just as appropriate 
to say the person is behind the hill as it is to say the person is in 
front of the hill. It would be more appropriate to say the hill is 
behind the person for people do have fronts and backs. 
There is nothing wrong with metaphor. In fact, without it, lan-
guage would be impossibly clumsy. 
The problem arises when we all too easily confuse metaphor 
with fact. 
A common example of confusing metaphor with fact is 
"·higher consciousness." Do you have higher consciousness when 
vou are flying in an airplane? How many people might say 
"yes"? 
CPC217.u: Do not threaten other people's metaphors; for 
most monkeys, metaphors are facts. They are their identity 
and their identity is fragile. 
CPC444A: All identity is fragile. Avoid stepping on the glass 
at the next cocktail party. 
YOU ARE YOUR OWN END. YOU ARE NOT THE MEANS TO 
ANYONE ELSE'S END. 
CPC39.oto: However, it is wise to let others believe that you 
are a means to their ends. 
IF YOU ARE NOT SELFISH YOU ARE WASTING YOUR 
LIFE. 
Buy another copy of this book and send it to the President. 

Pandemonium 
CPC-97.l: If you tell people you are selfish, they will not like 
you. Remember, words are more real than reality. Never let 
love take the place of power ... but be sure to refer to power 
as "love." People use the word love when they are feeling 
weak. People do not use the word power when they are 
feeling strong ...... Be as selfish as hell, but call yourself an 
altruist. Remember, you are always sacrificing yourself for 
the good of others. 
CPC774: I was once told by a pompous, humble couple how 
intuitive their black maid was. What did I learn from this? 
Pay little and tell people they have secret powers. Remem· 
ber, a maid is always a maid. 
CPC=-09: The first label someone gives you is the label they 
will always believe. 
CPC555.09: Labels are substitutes for reality. Learn to use 
them well and instill others to label you in the way you 
want. First impressions are difficult to overturn ...... People 
do not like to admit they were wrong ... and overiurning 
labels threatens the primitive survival function of quick 
impressions. 
CPC333.6: People are so much alike, it is a joke. However. 
they believe they are unique ... Become a mind reader by 
telling them something they think you don't know about...

question. Any question which has a difference score of +2 or more 
requires work ... For example, on the intelligence issue, your "have 
now" score is 3 and what you want is 6; your Despair Coefficient 
is +3 ...... Ask yourself is this realistic and, if so, what might you 
have to do to approximate the score of 6? Remember, a 5 is all 
vou reallv need ... How do I know this?

brainwashing yourself into unsanity. 
Take a break and think about despair math. Is not this test 
something that people do automatically all the time? Are they 
not measuring themselves against some standard? You are to

Interlude 
Now, take a break, get on your dirty clothes and take a walk 
through a very wealthy neighborhood. If you don't want to wind 
up in jail, be sure to carry your 10, a credit card and $80.00 in 
tens, twenties and ones ...... Be sure to remember or write down 
your thoughts and experiences ...... 
Another Interlude 
Once every three months attend a wedding, a funeral, or 
another social event of someone you don't know at all. Learn 
what you can about the people and the event and make up a 
story in case someone asks you why you are there ...... If someone 
tries to throw you out, apologize, tell them you lost your family 
and were lonely ...... See if they let you stay ..... .

Nature Survey 
(This survey is adapted from the work of W.H. Sheldon, 
M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Sheldon, although well respected in many areas 
of science, was frequently ostracized because of his focus on the 
inheritance of temperament. More recently, however, further 
research has tended to show that Dr. Sheldon was right after all.) 
The following technique is one of the most important you will 
learn ... It requires few direct questions, but instead utilizes obser· 
vation and paying close attention to the conversation of other 
people. This will provide you with a powerful edge when you 
need one ..... . 
From memory, using the following scales, analyze someone 
you know very well. When you meet the person again compare 
your analysis with what you see. 
This exam is designed to pick up on a person's fundamental 
nature. There are 9 points, so chose a number from 1 to 9. One is 
low and nine is high ...

The Psychopath's Bible 
What does this mean? Each of the 20 sets contains three 
descriptive factors: A, B, and C. Add all the A scores and divide 
by 20; do the same with the B scores and the C scores. 
For example I will analyze myself. 
A score is: 97/20=4.85 
B score is: 1 
/20=6.25 
C score is: 80/20=4.00 
The scores must be arranged with A first, B second, and C 
third. My overall profile is A=4.85; 
. C=4.00. 
Check my math, please. 
Superficially these scores say that my basic orientation 
toward life is activity, accomplishment, and aggression. This is 
revealed by my B Score, my highest score. 
Next I enjoy the physical comforts of life, and can be self-
indulgent. This is revealed by my A Score, the next highest score. 
Finally, while at times I am introverted, my overall style is 
that of an aggressive extrovert...... This is revealed by my C 
score, my lowest score. 
This'is my basic nature ...... and any attempts to restrict me 
would be met with aggression, rebellion and direct resistance. It 
also tells us that I would get along better with people who were 
higher in A and B scores than C scores. In passing, 1 would say 
that I intensely dislike people with extreme C scores ...... and 
enjoy people who like moderate, occasional social gatherings, 
particularly if it leads to accomplishing a goal. From this infor-
mation and what you can gather from this survey determine 
what tactics you would use to manipulate me to do what you 
want. 
A 10 t more inform a lion can be gleaned from this ev al ua tion; 
for example, by comparing the magnitude of differences between 
scores, by looking at the average score for each variable, and by 
comparing the average score for each variable to each individual 
score from each set.. .... Its power is endless ...... But vvill you 
learn how to use this power? 
One very powerful quality of this method is that you don't 
have to ask questions; you can observe and listen and find out a 
159 

Pandemonium 
lot about a person ...... This will allow you to adjust your tactics 
when you interact with others. 
Tltis is one of tlte most imlJOrtant techniques ... I can't over· 
stress this. It can be used to select mates and friends, to find 
latent enemies, and to get along with almost anyone ...... It is 
powerful and has been condemned by society-particularly by 
the liberal academic community-because it emphasizes innate 
tendencies and individual differences. And, after alt aren't we all 
"equal"? 
Now, using the same scales, analyze someone you just 
met.. .... Wait a month and analyze them again ...... What are the 
differences?

The First Thirty Minutes 
These are the most important minutes of the day, the first 30 
minutes after you wake up. Keep track of all emotions, feelings 
and, in particular, thoughts which "pop" into your mind. Write 
these down no matter how silly they may seem. After the day is 
over, go back over them. See what you can make of them. After a 
week go over them again and see what theme is developing. After 
a month do it again. Write a paragraph containing no moraliza-

Dr. Hyatt's Demands 

Pandemonium 
You would think that Humans might spend their time over· 
coming death, disease, stupidity. Dr. Lindner said that in the 
mid-1950's and Dr. Leary picked up the bandwagon. Now it is 
our turn, doing something-any something-every day to 
demolish this morass of human pollution. 
If you spend your time working like a fool-believing, roman· 
ticizing, breeding, nesting and digesting-you deserve whatever 
happens to you. If this is your" choice," please leave the class. 
Dr. Dad and staff have prepared a list of course-exercises. J 
use the phrases course-exercises and exercise-courses to convey 
the idea of the seriousness of this program and training. I am 
presenting as complete a program as possible on short notice. 
However, I expect only a few will attempt the program, let alone 
complete it. The modern world contains very few who think of 
anything but social status, sex and fulfilling their biologic 
im pera tives. 
CPC 111.8: Help people use what is natural for them to keep 
them in their place. Help people get married, buy houses, 
shop and have lots of children. 
All pleasure and all pain are brain phenomena. Here is an 
assumption-blaster: did you ever hand in a paper or take a test, 
get an A grade, and feel bad because you wanted a C grade? 
How about the reverse? 
If you have ever seen a child who did not 
bored when he 
did nc;t have something to do, then you have seen a hibernating 
bear in people-clothing. Human beings are accomplishment crea· 
tures. Even when we sleep, we accomplish through dreaming. 
Vegetables don't accomplish. That is why we refer to not accom-
plishing anything as "vegging out." 
CPC874.aa: Help people accomplish what they will do any-
way. They will always be indebted to you. Help them find a 
secure job, help them get laid, invite them to parties. help 
them get married. help them have children, help them buy 
a house, help them have a barbecue. 

The Psychopath's Bible 
Help them do what is normal for a talking monkey ..... . 
Remember, words are more real than reality ...... Help them 
be as common as they are and tell them they are doing 
right, being good, being profound. Tell them about their 
secret talents ...... 
To be human is to accomplish. To accomplish is to think. 
Computers sim.ply repeat what they have been programmed to 
do. People who simply repeat what they have been told to do are 
animated computers. 
Learning takes effort. Applying what you learn takes even 
more effort. 
Accomplishment takes effort. Learning is an accomplishment. 
To be other than an animated computer or a monkey in cloth is to 
constar:ttly expand your learning and, more importantly, your 
power. 
Some of these course-exercises can be taken at junior or senior 
colleges, either for credit or audited. You could simply go to va.ri-
ous universitv bookstores, look at the courses vou need to take, 
and buy the l~ooks. However, you must be disciplined. 
Other course-exercises can be taken on the web: videos, books 
and the like. Still others can be taken at private institutions or by 
requesting manuals and ads from corporations. 
You can learn to use automatic weapons at some gun ranges. 
Some of these courses can only be taught by Dr. Hyatt or his 
associates. For those that wish it-and can afford it-papers, 
developing ideas, etc. can be sent to the Dr. for his comments, 
evaluation and recording. 
You must have money to pay for these courses and exercises. 
How you accomplish this is your business. Some of the training 
will be difficult or almost impossible to find, but this is your 
quest and problem. We have provided some references; however, 
they are incomplete, leaving enough room for you to find your 
own. 

Pandemonium 
For a fee we will provide guidance. (Pay Pal, Cashier's Checks, 
Cash and Money Orders get immediate attention; personal checks 
must clear the bank first.) 
Our motto is "no excuses." PAY \JOW-~JUST DO IT-
NOW! 
p.s.: There is a lot to learn and, more importantly, a lot to 
apply. Choose what is best for you and don't allow the number 
of courses to distract you ...... It was designed to discourage 
you ........ . 
If and when you have completed these exercise-courses suc-
cessfully, you will be have earned the right to call yourself more 
than human; thus, you can stop being ashamed of being an illvol-
IIntan! member of the human race. 
You will be better trained and more powerful than most. You 
will be able to go anywhere and do anything you decide to do. 
How long will this take? As long as necessary. The definition 
of "work" in economics is: something done as a means to an end. 
The definition of "recreation" is: something done as an end in 
itself. Self-improvement through study violates the standard of 
economics. It is work in that it is a means to an end ~nd it is 
recreation in that it is an end in itself.

Interlude 
"Could the young but realize how 5(xm they will become 
bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct 
while in the plastic state. We are spinning our own fates, good 
or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest stroke of 
virtue or of vice leaves its never so little scar. The drunken Rip 
Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play, excuses himself for every 
fresh dereliction by saying, 'I won't count this time.' Well! he 
may well not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; but 
it is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve-cells 
and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering and stor-
ing it up to be used against him when the next temptation 
comes. Nothing we ever do, in strict scientific literalness, is 
wiped out. Of course this has its good side as well as its bad 
one. As we become permanent drunkards by so many sepa-
. mte drinks, so we become saints in the moral, and authorities 
and experts in the practical scientific spheres, by so many 
separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth have any anxi-
ety c1bout the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it 
ma y be. If he keeps filithfully busy each hour of the working-
day, he may safely leave the final result to itself. lie can with 
perfect certainty count on waking up some fine morning, to 
find himself one of the competent ones of his generation, in 
whatever pursuit he rna y have singled out." 
William James, Principles of Psychology 
Brain Change Willed 
When you study something new, your brain actually makes 
new connections and grows in size, The increase in size is tiny, 
but the increase in new connections is massive. New connections 
don't develop instantaneously, they take time to grow. We wallt to 
emphasize that the right way to learn new material is to read the book 
at least three times. The first time just read it straight through. You 
may well not Ullderstand much at all; it does not matter. Just keep 
reading. The secolld time through, it will mostly make a lot of sense. 
The third time through YOIl will understand alld likely learn the

materia/. Those three readings give your brain time to grow those 
new connections and set them in place. The first reading is hard. 
The second reading is interesting. The third reading is fun. 
All power to the brain. The creator of gods, ghosts, myths, 
fantasies, knowledge, beauty, and reference. 
These exercise-courses will not make you a specialist but 
rather a generalist-although you may choose to specialize in as 
many areas as you wish. They are not designed to get you a job, 
but to change you in a radical way and become someone you 
won't recognize.

The model of transformation presented here is based on the 
old Saracen system of education. If a student wanted to learn 
and a teacher wanted to teach, they would come to an arrange-
ment. The teacher was not licensed by either the State or the 
Church, and there were no entrance requirements other than those 
agreed upon. If the student and teacher become unhappy with 
each other, the student would simply find another teacher or vice 

Pandemonium 
versa. If and when the student was satisfied with what he 
wanted to learn he would simply leave. The student would pay 
for what he wanted and then went on to the next teacher or area 
of interest. 
Homes were often used as classrooms as were rented facili-
ties; sometimes these would grow into small communities of 
learning where services required by the student-lodging, food, 
etc.-were simply paid for. Over time, some of these small 
centers grew into profound centers of learning, yet there was no or 
little formality and no sta te interference. 
In the final analysis, the proof of the student's knowledge was 
his ability, and not degrees, certificates, grades or licenses. This 
form of education 
of course, unacceptable in today's world of 
point-and -click mentality.

Fundamentally there are three types of guilt. We call them: 
1. Existential: That which comes from the very fact of exis-
tence. You exist so you do not want anyone to steal your prop-
erty or to hurt you. Thus, we do not steal other people's property, 
nor do we initiate physical violence. We assert that violating these 
principles can, and should, result in guilt-existential guilt. 
2. Biblical/Social: Except for existential guilt (which both 
bibles and society generally include in their babble), the remainder 
is utter nonsense and designed to tame and control. To find ex-
amples of this type of guilt thumb a bible or a law book. 
3. Developmental: Those speCific stupidities that derive from 
the process of being raised. For example, your parents wanted 
you to be a dentist and you became a pilot. 
Sometimes I collapse the three categories into two: existential 
and neurotic. 
Guilt has two feelings associated with it: fear and self-
hate...... Fear relates to punishment and self-hate is self-
punishment. 
When you feel guilt whose origins are biblical! social or devel-
opmental, you are weakened. This is their purpose-to weaken 
vou. 
~ 
When you feel guilty, immediately ignore the associated 
thoughts; instead, associate an image which gives you pleasure. 
173 

Pandemonium 
Instead of focusing on the feelings or the associated thoughts, 
force yourself to focus on the pleasurable image ...... In time you 
will be mostly guilt free. But remember, you must practice and 
not allow yourself to entertain the associated bad feelings or 
thoughts. Do not argue with yourself whether you are guilty or 
not-just force yourself to practice. 
Before you can do this you will have to find life experiences 
that gave you pleasure, or invent an image that you think will 
give you pleasure. 
Since a person's identity partially consists of guilt feelings 
and all it entails, as you begin to become guilt free you may feel 
anxiety. This is natural as you are re-constructing yourself-
which means you do not feel like your usual self. This is not the 
problem that many professionals would like you to believe. It is a 
sign of self-empowerment. 
CPC YY¥: Dysfunctional self-interest: People who are moti-
vated by self-interest are the smartest people to work with; 
however. a large group who claim self interest are aetually 
highly dysfunctionaL. .... Their self-interest is motivated by 
intense inferior feelings so they are primarily self-destruc-
tive and dangerous ..... .

a. Beliefs 
Undoing YourSelf: 
Some Important Terms 
to Keep in Mind 
Beliefs are unquestioned assumptions (sec below) which are 
often spoken aloud and practiced day-to-day in your everyday 
life. 
b. Behavior-Habits 
This is what you do day-to-day like an machine weaves 
clothes. It is the way you put on clothes, address your boss, talk 
to your husband, how you cook, etc. 
c. Attitudes 
These are points of view similar to beliefs but believed by the 
talking monkey to have been thought out. Most of these are peer 
group and media generated. 
d. Assumptions 
Assumptions are neither good nor bad, but simply unex-
plored belief patterns which have not been questioned rationally 
or empirically. Most of what we do, belief and say are based on 
false assumptions. Find all your assumptions and question them 
with the utmost cruelty. 
e. Mommy and Daddy 
These are the two primates who you imprinted on. They 
taught you how to think, act and what to believe long before you 
could question their assumptions or even acquired language. You 
learned to imitate them, to rebel blindly against them, and your 
psychological development was primarily dependent on them. 
They, of course, are simply talking monkeys reflecting the non-
175 

Pandemonium 
sense belief and history inculcated in them. Study them as talking 
monkeys; drop the label parents, replace it with talking monkeys. 
Some Psychology Terms 
a. Greed 
The horror of helplessness. An out-of-control state of the 
"soul" that makes you a victim. Greed is very different from get-
ting what you want. 
b.Fear 
Something often real, like an approaching car. At times, an 
almost paralyzing emotion. More often than not, fear is induced 
by the anticipation of punishment and is the result of early learn-
ing and an undisciplined imagination. 
c. Anxiety 
An anticipatory response, more often than not irrational. The 
feeling of melting away, of disappearing, of falling apart. 
d. Frustration 
Being thwarted in getting what you want when you want. 
Often frustration leads to aggression and/or depression instead 
of productive efforts to get around obstacles. 
Terms for you to define: 
aggression 
depression 
perversions 
shame 
guilt 
hostility 
humiliation 
self-destructive and other destructive behavior.

path's life and everyone has errors. Your job is to study them 
and then find at least some of the errors. For each philosopher, 
read something of his or a summary of his thinking and then read 
a book of criticisms. 
Start with an introductory course in philosophy at your local 
university or junior college. All philosophers are bigots for their 
own system. The psychopath is a bigot for the system that bene-
fits his own life. The law of the psychopath is: how does this help 
me get what r want in life.

A Few Useful Teaching Tools 
by Nicholas Tharcher 
The followin.g is a short, semi-random list of books, movies 
and events which we like for various reasons and which the 
aspiring or practicing Toxick Magician might find useful to 
study. Each has its own unique quality and some may have no 
value to you at all; we may even have included some as ringers. 
In many cases these works provide information about atti-
tudes and occasionally about techniques (martial arts movies can 
be useful in both regards). Only in a few cases, however, do we 
recommend the ,,,,,ork unreservedly: often the amount of useful 
information varies tremendously. Some (like The Thomas Crow)] 
Affair and Poi1lt Break) are excellent portrayals of the psychopath 
from beginning to end. Others (like Thelma and Louise are more 
limited-in our view it was rather so-so until the end), In some 
the psychopath-protagonists are highly limited by the circum-
stances of their social environment (e.g., in Goodfellas the full 
expression of psychopathy was limited-not because of the wider 
external society, but because of the more limited society of a gang 
with its own rules.) 
You may find it useful to consider some of our criteria for 
excluding some titles: many potential candidates were left off the 
list because the characters come off as too pathetic, or as social-
ized/moralized, or as driven only by outside forces or as 
"crazy." 
197 

Pandemonium 
As we were putting this list together we noted that many 
examples fell into certain distinct categories (though a fe,,\' seem 
to defy categorization-Being There is a good example). The main 
categories, however, seemed to be 1) Vengeance, 2) Obsession, 
3) Expressing the "wm to Power," and 4) Doing Your Own "True 
Will." We also noted another category which we could only 
describe as "Boring": they include almost all poli tical movies; 
Nixon. 
For a while we felt surprised that we found so few candidates 
in certain groups, notably Science Fiction and War Movies. 
Perhaps that's because the former group seems mostly concerned 
with the improvement of the species (though frankly we can't 
think of many that succeed even minimally: when Captain Kirk 
says, "I'm from Iowa; I only work in outer space," he seems to 
make the point most eloquently) and War Movies seem focused 
on an area which is inherently tied to accepted social values. 
One may argue that some titles do not belong on the list at 
all; on the other hand, one may argue that we missed obvious 
and significant works. \Ve certainly won't argue about that. 
Here's our list:

Another useful classification we noted includes training 
devices which help illustrate how the system really works. Most of 
these examples are from "real life" and are far from exhaustive. 
It seems that in this classification, "fact" can be far more educa-
tional than fiction.

Appendix II 
A Toxick Chaos Virus Rite 
by Rev. Dagon 
Over a decade ago, after reading through the first edition of 
TIlc Psychopath's Biblc, (initially released as TIle Toxick Mngicirm), I 
contemplated many courses of action that could be taken using 
the philosophies and tools of T oxick Magick. A discussion 
between a fellow Frater, the late William S. Burroughs, brought to 
light an opportunity that appeared ripe for such an approach. 
A certain Reverend, who for liability purposes we shall name 
Rev. Ned Yelps, had a penchant for conducting campaigns of 
hatred and harassment against homosexuals and victims of 
AIDS. In the years prior to our decision to take action to 
manipulate the Rev. Yelps, he had been successful in attracting a 
rather large contingent of followers in the Midwest. Their modus 
operandi was to blanket-fax the media and picket the businesses 
and funerals of homosexuals and persons infected or killed by the 
AIDS virus with such messages as "Gods Hates Fags", "We 
Hate Homos", etc. In our research, we also uncovered that the 
Rev. Yelps was a disbarred lawyer and had been convicted of 
child abuse-which was a sure sign that the Rev. Yelps had a soft 
underbelly, ripe for evisceration. 
Utilizing the Toxic Magick techniques of feeding the victim's 
ego and using it against him covertly, as well as a bit of subter-
fuge in disarming the victim with a false honesty and admiration, 
we infiltrated the Rev. Yelps organization via email and phone 
conversations. Our goal was to create a situation wherein the vic-
tim and his organization would destroy themselves through their 
own actions. 
As a basis for our action, we utilized the concept of a "Chaos 
Virus." Chaos Virii are similar to Chaos Servitors2S in that they 
2HSee Phil Hine's Conde1lsed Chaos and Primt' Chaos; Peter Carroll's 
PsyberMagick; and Lawrence Galian's Beyond Duolity. 
202 

The Psychopath's Bible 
are entities capable of functioning independently of the magi-
cian-an independent thoughtform or Tulpa. One trait that 
Chaos Virii exhibit is that they replicate themselves by feeding off 
the host. This is not necessarily the case with Chaos Servitors 
unless they are specifically prog;ammed to do so. 
A Chaos Virus does not necessarily need to have a specified 
length of life, unless so desired, 
their life span is contingent 
on the life of their host(s) or their host's defenses. Therefore Chaos 
Virii have a built-in self-destruct mode since they die when the 
host dies or they are killed off by the host's defenses. Construc-
tion of a Chaos Virus should incorporate characteristics of the 
AIDS virus, at least to the extent thM the AIDS virus is immune 
to human defense systems. 
Included in the' following ritual rubric are examples from a 
Chaos Virus Rite performed for the purpose of infiltrating and 
subverting a well-known homophobic Christian evangelist, The 
Rev. Ned Yelps. 
This rite was an exercise in utilizing the Internet and phone as 
tools of Toxick Magick. Research, infiltration and infection were 
all accomplished utilizing FTP searches, email, and phone conver-
sations! messages. Prior to the rite, contact with the host, through 
the Rev. Yelps' brother-in-law, was made undercover via email 
and telephone. The text of the initial letter and reply was as 
follows: 
Dear Mr. XXXXXXX, 
After perusing numerous ftp archives, I came across many 
files with derogatory statements regarding you, Rev. Yelps 
and the XXXXX Baptist church. These faggots make me sick 
and I wanted you to know that I, and many of my friends, 
support your 
We have to stop these homo hoards 
from taking over the country, the media and the gov't. 
We are starting a 
magazine called 
"WE SHALL 
OVERCOME" and we would be interested in a phone inter-
view with Rev. Yelps. Hopt:>fully, this would be aired on a 
locill mdio station and subsequently transcribed to be 
included in our magazine. If Rev. Yelps is interested, we 
would be glad to include any questions that he would like us 
to ask in the interview. If you could email me a reply at

XXX@XXXX.XXX with a confirmation of Rev. Yelps' interest in 
doing an interview, questions, time and phonl> number we 
could contact him at, it would be most appreciated. 
Yours Sincerely,

Dear Mr. XXXXXXX: 
I must admit that I find this to be a bit shocking, for seldom is

do not take this to be anything but caution on our part. I would 
be interested in receiving information from you regarding 
where you are, more about your organization, etc. Nothing 
personal is necessary, just information about your 
tion, etc. 
On a personal note, where are you finding the information 
about us through ftp? I'm interested in seeing the articles 
myself, as I'm sure I don't see even a small fraction of what is 
out there. 
Again, let me express my surprise at this invitation. 1 am 
sure that if you call Fred Sr. and leave the message on his 
machine he would be willing to speak to you when it is con-
venient.

This set the stage for contact and subsequent infection 
through the Branch Yelpsians compound and cohorts. 
The Chaos Virus Rite 
Pre-Ritual (to be performed prior to the rite, either for a day, a 
week, or a month): 
1. Focus on oneself as an eating, drinking, sleeping, speaking, 
fornicating creature. 
2. Radically change, alter, stop any or all of the above for a 
specified period of time before the ritual. 
Ritual Preparation 
1. Construct a mantric and symbolic sigil of the intent, 
purpose and action of the Chaos Virus. 
2. A sturdy staff or rod. 
3. Relevant incense, music, strobe lights, fog, etc. 
4. Acquire a Television you are willing to sacrifice for use in 
this rite. 
a. Prepare T.V. by painting a chaos star \vith a Chaos Virus 
SigH in the center of the screen. 
Ritual 
Statement of Intent: (lilt is our will to create a Chaos Virus 
to ... ") 
For this rite the statement of intent was: 
It is our will to create a Chaos Virus that will cause the 
Reverend Ned Yelps and his followers to make fools of 
themselves in the media <md ruin their credibility and success 
in their goals. 
This intent was condensed into the mantra: "BO-IS-£-NAW" 
and the sigil: 0*", an asterisk which was inspired by Kurt Vonne-
gut's book Brl'l1kj(lsl with Champiolls where the asterisk is likened 
to a human asshole. The asterisk, being a sublime symbol, was 
easily embedded in a letter or email. 
205 

Pandemonium 
1. Light incense; turn on the TV to static with the sound 
turned all the way up; strobe lights on; fog machine spewing; and 
any other effects to create a theatrical circus atmosphere. 
2. All participants sit in a half circle in front of the prepared 
TV with the staff (rod) in the center. 
a. For this rite, the Virus Sigil to be charged was an asterisk 
(painted within a chaos star on the screen of the TV set.) 
3. All start mimicking the behavior of the host. 
In this rite, we exhibited homophobic behavior by stomping 
around and screaming in a fanatical fashion statements such as: 
"God hates fags!", "Sodomites be10ng in hell!", "We Hate 
Homos!" This aligns the group with the host and programs the 
virus to appear benign, non-harmful and sympathetic, thereby 
allowing access to the host. 
4. Each participant then invokes a different godform related 
to the rite, not a full invocation but more overshadowing (see 
Prime Chnos by Phil Hine) or intense visualizations and theatrics. 
For this rite, we utilized god forms of the Greek and Roman 
pantheon (Dionysus, Apollo, Hermes, Ganymede and Zeus), 
because of the prevalence and acceptance of homo- Ibi-sexuality 
and power within those archetypes. 
5. All participants then move back into a half-circle in front of 
the TV, kneeling, and all grabbing the staff lrod. All then start 
stroking the staff as if masturb<lting a phallus and chanting 
phr<lses incongruent to the host, something you want the host to 
dol act! say. Each participant chants only one phrase repeatedly. 
a. For this rite, we utilized phrases such as "Jesus was an 
ass fucker", "God loves fags", "Jehovah eats man cum" I 
"Jesus licks my dick", etc. 
6. Continue to glossal<llia. 
7. At the height of glossal<llia and staff stroking, all pick up 
the staff <lnd stare into the Chaos Star Virus sigil and yell the 
mantric sigil of the Chaos Virus purpose, "BO-IS-E-NAW," while 
smashing the staff into the center of the Chaos Star Virus Sigil on 
the TV screen, charging I programming the Virus. 
8. Banish with laughter 
206 

The Psychopath's Bible 
9. Send the sigil in a letter through the mail, email or in a 
phone message for infection. 
A letter was sent via email with the Chaos Virus imbedded 
therein, as well as in a call made to Rev. Yelps' answering 
machine. The phone message thanked the Rev. Yelps for the 
opportunity for an interview but, at this time, the magazine and 
interview had been indefinitely put on hold to take care of other 
business. The Toxick mantric sigil was sublimely chanted in the 
background of the message. 
This particular version of the rite was rather successful in 
that, the day following the rite, Rev. Yelps and his contingent of 
picketers with signs such as "God hates Fags", "Homos belong in 
Hell", etc. were run out of Lawrence, Kansas. This was the first 
occurrence of a negative backlash at one of Rev. Yelps' anti-gay 
rallies. A month later, Rev. Yelps was a guest on the Ricki Lake 
Show and was thoroughly ridiculed and laughed at for his beliefs 
and actions. A few years later, a news segment on the Rev. Yelps 
and his group was aired on TV relating how Rev. Yelps' group 
was going to picket a coffee shop that employed homosexuals. 
The coffee shop owners turned the tables on Rev. Yelps' group by 
sponsoring a benefit wherein every hour the Rev. Yelps' group 
picketed the coffee shop; the coffee shop patrons would make a 
donation to an AIDS charity. The Rev. Yelps did not show up 
and only five members of his group stood outside for only a few 
hours-earning the AIDS charity a few thousand dollars. This 
approach has since been used against Rev. Yelps' protesters on a 
number of occasions. 
The Rev. Yelps' group recently initiated a flyer campaign and 
protest against the constant "Hate Crimes," violence and vandal-
ism against Rev. Yelps' church membership with little sympathy 
from the local authorities. The hilarity continues with protests 
against the benevolent children's television personality Mr. 
Rogers. Rev. Yelps' daughter was quoted in the press stating, 
"This country has forgotten God and effectively flipped him off 
and Mr. H.ogers is in part responsible." 
207 

Pandemonium 
It appears tha t a chemical cocktail to cure the spread of the 
Toxick Virus has not been discovered by Rev. Yelps and his 
group ... Maybe a Kool-aid virus n fa Jim Jones is in order.

CPCXYXY.2: Sex-what price? 
The great secret to control is: diminish pleasure, increase 
guilt. Happy people cannot be controlled. Guilty people 
demand to be punished. All religions and governments are 
built on these principles. 
Sex has been channeled by all cultures. By controlling sex 
in various ways people are enslaved. 
The price of sex is often destruction of the marginal type. 
Marriage, children, job, family, etc. are a linear path to the 
grave. Many marginal types are lost forever in this prison of 
socialized flesh. 
Never pay too much for sex. Vou are much better off mas-
turbating than getting trapped in marriage (Le .. sex sanc-
tioned by the priest and politician). 
You are better off in direct payment than in paying with 
your life. The entire game is rigged, particularly against 
potentially powerful males. Simply read the law books. 
209 

Pandemonium 
CPC82478a: For Men 
Learn to use sex to achieve power: masturbate often so the 
psycho-chemical reaction doesn't control you... Practice 
tantra ... any style will do. If you decide on a partner, find 
one whose nature will enhance you. Keep in mind, however, 
that once a woman becomes pregnant and has a child, her 
brain changes. Be alert to the black widow in every mother. 
More and more male children are being destroyed by 
"momism"; so if you have a male child be sure that he is 
trained in sports and that you take a direct hand in raising 
him. Teach him how to play rough-consider military 
school. or an all male school out of the country. 
Regardless of what any male says, women are first mother-
images. So the label "wife" is a substitute mother-fIgure 
who he is allowed to have sex with. Getting married to a 
highly socialized female will cost you more than 50evo of 
your life. The children are hers, you are hers. Your value is 
the contribution of sperm, money and status. Always keep 
in mind that most females are agents for the social fabric 
and, in this sense, "work" for the culture. 
CPC82478b: For Women 
Some potentially powerful women have been ruined by mar-
riage with children ... I personally know of two cases, and 
there is very little we can do to reverse the SOCial-chemical 
process. 
If you pick men for their power, what does that leave for 
you? If you pick men for their competence and self-esteem. 
you invite your own development. 
"In order to say 'I love you,' you must first be say to say '1'."

The Psychopath's Bible 
Multiple Motives 
People do things for multiple reasons. However, we tend to 
look for "The Motive." And we usually accept the most sinister. 
The rule here is to help people find your "real" motive while 
keeping hidden your other motives. First you have to know most 
of your own motives. Then, by selective misdirection, help other 
people discover the one you want them to believe. People will 
assume the motive you deny is the real motive. [f someone of 
authority tells them what your real motive is, they will tend to 
believe it. [f your motive seems "selfishll they will believe it. And 
so on. 
Pre-emptive Strikes 
If someone is about to accuse you-or is accusing you-of 
something sinister, pre-empt them by admitting to a lesser 
offense. Switch the motive they are attributing to you, change the 
timing, but give them something to criticize. No one will believe 
that you are completely innocent, so always plead guilty to a 
lesser "crime." Accept responsibility for somcthillg, even if it is 
something as simple as ignorance. Apologize for things you 
didn't do. It makes people happy to find your faults. 
Misdirection 
This is an innate survival technique of most animals. Most 
people are fair at this game; however, adding conscious misdirec-
tion is good training. It will help your thinking process and pos-
sibly teach you how to cover up your fears and anxiety. 
[n poker, misdirection is a primary strategy. Checking at the 
right time with a losing or winning hand; checking and raising, 
again at the right time; bluffing: all of these simple techniques are 
based on the power of misdirection. You allow other people to 
jump to their own conclusions ...... everybody loves to be a 
prophet and predict the future. Allow them to do this a few 
times and, when it is worth your while, simply fool them by not 
doing what they expect. 
211 

Pandemonium 
Prediction and the Illusion of Control 
The popularity of astrology assures us that it is more impor-
tant to have the illusion that you can predict and are in charge 
than it is to act1lally predict accurately and be in charge. Never 
argue with people who use more or less useless techniques ..... .let 
them do it. In fact, help them. Buy them books on subjects which 
give them the illusion that they can predict the future and are in 
control. For example, with a person who believes in astrology, 
provide them with information they made have missed. Assure 
them of their abilities and then use it against them: if a person 
says that Mercury is retrograde, then take advantage of them at 
that time and let them attribute it to Mercury's being retrograde. 
Let Them Give You Reasons 
Avoid arguing with the reasons people give you-they are 
usually just complaining and creating illusions. Just shake your 
head and say, "Yes r understand" and then do what you want 
anyway. I often use this technique in real estate or o'ther large 
purchases. I agree with them in subtle ways, giving them the 
impression that their item is worth more than it is, and then offer 
what I want. 
Delusions Everywhere 
As humans are "causal hungry," they attribute causality to 
either internal causes (me) or otherwise (not me). It doesn't 
matter whether the attribution is true or false. I am discussing 
attribution styles: 
/I All events are caused by me"; very rare and delusional. 
II All events are caused by other forces"; very rare and 
delusional. 
212 

The Psychopath's Bible 
-
"Good events are caused by me, bad events are caused by 
not me"; very immature. (The good me, bad you.) 
-
"Bad events are caused by me, good events are caused by 
not me"; very immature. (The bad me, good you.) 
-
The objective type-scientific type, very rare indeed-no 
moral irn plica tion. 
Most commonly, some events are caused by me and others 
are not. Remember that any explanation doesn't-and 1 repeat, 
doesn't -have to be accurate for anyone ..... . 
Keep in mind the importance of style and manipulating 
style ... Also keep in mind that people assume that the ability to 
explain something means that they have influence over the 
"something." 
If you get a person to believe the attribution you have created, 
you have also gotten them to believe that either they or you can 
influence that "something.// 
Example 1: 
John is in a bad mood; his girlfriend refused to go to a party 
with him ... John is an externalizer; that is, he attributes the 
"why" she won't go to external forces. You pick up a newspaper 
and tell him that Mercury is retrograde and that this is the likely 
cause why his girlfriend refused him. 
John has heard of astrology; you continue with your explana-
tion of "why his girlfriend won't go with him." He shows signs 
that he believes this. Your next step is to get him to pay for a 
chart of his girlfriend's sign so he will know when she is more 
likely to go along with what he wants. His mood lifts as he is 
writing you a check. It doesn't matter that the reason she won't 
go is that she is trying to break off the relationship. Even when 
John finds out later that this is what she is doing, you inform him 
that by having her chart and buying another on himself, he will 
increase his chances of halting the termination of the relationship. 
When the relationship ends and John approaches you with 
this fact, you say you are sorry, but when you analyze the posi-
tion of Venus and Mars in their charts you inform him that their 
213 

Pandemonium 
relationship was doomed from the very beginning and that he is 
better off. John is disappointed but he knows two things. First, he 
knows the cause; and second, he knows it wasn't his fault. 
Example 2: 
Bill has been diagnosed with diabetes. He is an internalizer; 
that is, he believes that he is the cause of most things. You inform 
him that it is his bad living habits that have caused the diabetes. 
You might even say that he had a genetic predisposition, but that 
his lifestyle is at fault. You suggest that he change his diet and 
exercise and present him with a contract to a health spa. Bill signs 
the contract because you have provided him with a cause that he 
can accept. First, it is his fault and, because it is his fault and he 
now knows the cause, he can do something about it. Although 
exercise and diet will, in fact, help, it will not "cure" the disease. 
But what it did cure was Bill's need to know that the cause is 
under his control. 
What are some of the factors which make both Jim and Bill 
accept your attributions? 
First you are credible: you look as if you have power. 
Second, your explanation sounds reasonable within the 
social/cultural matrix of the subject. 
Third, you have given them both a sense that they have some 
way of controlling the future: John, by understanding charts and 
Bill by doing exercise and diet.
