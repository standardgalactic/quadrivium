INTRODUCTION
The internet has changed the way we shop 
beyond all recognition. Global e-commerce 
sales reached $1.25 trillion in 2013 and, of 
course, the indications are that this will 
only increase.
The advantages for the shopper are 
clear. It’s a timesaver and it’s often more 
convenient—there’s no need to leave home, 
and shopping can even be done on the 
move with a smartphone (not surprisingly 
this is a habit that’s growing among 
shoppers). In addition, it’s often cheaper 
to shop online and you can compare prices 
easily; the choice is far wider, and you can 
purchase pretty much anything. 
But for the business owner, as well, the 
attraction of selling online is great. You can 
access a global market, or at least as wide a 
market as you are prepared to ship to. Your 
overheads are less, and you can be “open” 
24 hours a day, every day of the week.
Most importantly, the internet offers a level 
playing field. If you have a professional-
looking website and products that people 
want to buy, you stand as much of a chance 
of making your online business a success as 
the next person, even if that person has 
considerably more money to invest.
The great news for the small business 
person or entrepreneur is that while setting 
up a full-blown, made-from-scratch 
e-commerce website is an expensive, 
time-consuming, and complicated 
undertaking, there are an increasing number 
of solutions that put the creation of an 
online sales system well within anyone’s 
reach, and many of these can be achieved 
relatively quickly.
There are solutions for everyone, some more 
expensive, some slightly more technical, 
some requiring more time invested to 
complete the setup. Whether you’re selling 
your own products or someone else’s, 
whether you’re selling services online or 
downloadable files, there will be an 
e-commerce solution that’s just right for 
you—within your financial reach, within your 
capabilities, and which won’t need months 
of planning to achieve.

7
In this book we’ll look at some of the fast 
and simple systems now available to the 
online entrepreneur. Multiple systems exist, 
and it can be hard work to figure out which 
will be easy to implement, against those 
which will cause the non-programmer a 
headache to set up and work with, and 
those which will need expensive and 
unexpected add-ons in order to do the job.
For this book, I’ve selected the options 
I think are the best choices, based on 
these criteria:
> The system can be set up quickly and 
painlessly, without you having to hire 
a web developer.
> It is, of course, secure.
> It looks excellent.
So that you can choose which one will work 
best for you, we’ll analyze which systems 
require more technical expertise, which cost 
more, and which are best suited to particular 
kinds of business. For each system, we’ll 
attempt to balance out the pros and cons 
so you can make an informed decision, 
and then guide you through the steps to 
implement the solution you decide upon.
We’ll look at the different ways of taking 
payment via the internet and see which will 
be the most appropriate for you. We’ll show 
you how you can present your products to 
maximum advantage, including marketing 
your store, social media, and how best to 
prepare your site for the search engines.  
Later in the book, we’ll equip you with the 
knowledge you need to manage and develop 
your rapidly growing online business, and 
see some of the different ways webstore 
owners can increase their sales. 
Within just days, you’ll have your own online 
store and be taking payments online—you’ll 
be a part of the online sales revolution.

E-commerce basics
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE EASIER 
WAYS OF SELLING ONLINE, AND WHAT 
YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BEGIN.
 
The “from-scratch” method of selling 
online involves setting up a website, 
installing shopping cart software, and 
integrating it with a payment gateway 
to deposit payments into your internet 
merchant account, as well as optionally 
integrating it with email mailing list soft-
ware, a customer database, and stock 
control software, among others. You also 
need to make sure your site is secure and 
that it conforms to legal requirements.
If this sounds complicated, that’s because 
it is—it’s fiddly, it needs technical expertise, 
and requires significant financial investment.
Happily, the alternative systems that we’ll 
be looking at in this book have been created 
specially to make the whole process easier. 
By rolling some of these elements together 
and implementing an interface that lets the 
user control the look of their site without 
coding knowledge, they make the task of 
getting yourself an online selling system 
much more accessible and dramatically 
reduce time spent and money invested.
Online selling systems—at least, the ones 
we’ll be looking at together—can be divided 
into three groups.
“Traditional” online selling 
VS. THE QUICKER, EASIER WAYS

1. A “STOREFRONT” ON AMAZON OR EBAY
Setting up a storefront on one 
of these large “marketplace” 
sites is an extremely fast and 
low-cost way of getting your 
products out there. As well as 
speed, cost, and ease of setup, 
another huge advantage is that 
you’ll have access to their giant 
customer base and get instant 
traffic to your store, while at 
the same time benefitting 
from their brand.  
Setting up a storefront with Amazon or eBay is a quick and economic way of selling your products, bringing you lots 
of instant traffic, but it doesn’t allow you much room for branding. Above: stores.ebay.com/historicimages-store.
TERMINOLOGY
The term “storefront” is also widely 
used to refer to any kind of online 
store, however in this book, to avoid 
confusion, we’ll be using it to refer 
to this way of selling via a larger 
marketplace. Also in this category 
are storefronts on Etsy, Boticca, 
and a host of other marketplace 
options—see page 21.
The downside is that your 
store clearly isn’t entirely your 
own, which makes presenting 
your individual brand hard, so 
in time you’ll probably want 
to set up your own webstore, 
separate from Amazon or eBay. 
But using the infrastructure of 
one of these online giants is an 
excellent way of testing your 
products and prices, and of 
building a client base without 
any significant financial outlay.

2. A WEBSTORE
A webstore is an all-in-one 
system that comprises the 
site design with hosting and a 
built-in shopping cart. You need 
to input your payment details 
(more about this in Chapter 3) 
and your site content, product 
info, and so on, and you’re 
ready to go.
The advantages of this kind 
of system are that you have 
a choice of great-looking 
TERMINOLOGY
Like “storefront,” the term “webstore” 
is often used to refer to any kind of 
online shop; here we’ll use it to refer 
to an all-in-one system, to make a 
clear distinction between the two.
templates that you can modify, 
you don’t have to worry about 
technicalities or security, and 
the system is very easy to use. 
Additionally, a host of add-ons 
make it easy to integrate your 
all-in-one webstore with other 
needs such as mailing list 
systems and inventory control. 
Obviously, there are costs 
associated with such a service 
that make it more expensive to 
run a webstore than to sell via 
Amazon or eBay, or to do the 
whole thing yourself using the 
WordPress system.
Setting up your store via a webstore provider gives you your own online presence. It’s quick and easy to set 
up and removes the hassle of hosting your own site. Above: www.cookbookvillage.com set up with Shopify.

11
3. WORDPRESS
WordPress is a free software 
system that you can use to 
run an online store on your 
own web host.
This is a great solution if you 
want your own store but you 
don’t have the budget for an 
all-in-one webstore system with 
its monthly payments. While 
the setup is not too technical, 
it is not as straightforward as 
using a webstore system and 
Setting up your site via WordPress is a little trickier to navigate, but your online store will be entirely your own, 
and you’ll avoid the monthly fees of a webstore provider. Above: www.utique.co.za.
does require a certain amount 
of application.
Wonderful-looking professional 
templates will make your site 
look as good as it would using 
an all-in-one webstore system, 
and an added plus is knowing 
you’re in charge of your own 
site, rather than being dependent 
on an external company.

Before you BEGIN
DECIDING WHAT TO SELL
It’s likely you’ve already decided 
what you are going to sell 
online. However, it may be worth 
considering the following before 
you dive into your setup.
Online sites fall into one of the 
following three categories:
> Those that sell everything 
one could want, like a 
department store.  
> Those that sell a medium-sized 
range of products.
> Those that sell products in 
a very specific niche.
If you’re reading this book, 
it’s unlikely you’re planning 
on setting up a very large 
online business, as per the 
first category. If this were 
the case, you’d probably be 
embarking on a tailor-made 
“from-scratch” site build. 
It’s much more likely that you 
are planning to specialize in a 
particular niche of products or 
a specific field of interest. This 
kind of online store can often 
be very successful; firstly, it 
is more easily found in web 
searches. Secondly, specializing 
makes you look like an expert 
in your niche, and if you do it 
well, it will be relatively easy 
to cultivate a reputation as the 
go-to place for your kind of 
product. Do bear in mind though 
that if your site is too far toward 
the “niche” end of the scale, you’ll 
find your profits are restricted.
If your site falls into the second 
category and you’re planning 
a store with a broader scope, 
your products probably won’t 
come up in searches as easily 
and you’ll have to compete 
with larger stores. Key to the 
success of your store will be 
your branding, your marketing, 
and the impact you make with 
your USP.
Basing your online store around a niche can often be very 
successful. Above: funstufffordogs.com, right: www.ties.com.

13
YOUR “USP” OR “UNIQUE 
SELLING POINT”
What makes your store special? 
Why should people visit it and 
spend their money with you 
rather than with one of your 
competitors? Before you launch, 
and before you even start 
building, be sure to work this 
out as it will have an impact on 
how your site looks and how 
you present your products.  
Your USP could be one 
of the following:
> cheap prices
> unique products
> superlative customer 
service (including free 
delivery, free shipment 
on returns, fast delivery)
> your expertise
> being the best in your field
> being the most up-to-the-
moment in your field
> your brand—making your 
products the most desirable
/the most fashionable/the 
best “lifestyle” choice
What is going to make your 
business stand out from the 
competition? Make sure your 
customers know.
“BEFORE YOU BEGIN” CHECKLIST
This book will show you how to set up your online store 
in a weekend, although, of course, developing an entire 
business requires more time.
Before diving into your webstore-building weekend, 
I’m assuming you’ll already have:
> Carried out research into your competition and your field 
of business. 
> Considered your “USP” as well as the image you want to 
present to your customers (see Chapter 4).
> Got your products available so they’re ready to go as soon 
as you get your first order.
> Decided on your distribution system­, i.e. how you are going 
to dispatch your orders (at least, at the outset).
> Complied with any legal requirements to ensure you will be 
conducting your business legally, in accordance with where you 
are based, as regulations vary (see Chapter 15).
To complete your webstore build in a weekend, you’ll also 
need to have sorted out the following before you begin:
> A logo for your new webstore (see page 40; if you’re getting 
a logo professionally designed, this will take some time).
> Good photographs of your products to display on your site 
(see page 50).
> Your payment system: PayPal takes at least a few days to 
set up, as you will need to get your account verified. If you are 
planning on using a payment gateway/merchant account 
system, this can also take some time to set up. Some people 
begin with PayPal and add a payment gateway later (see 
Chapter 3).
With the above in place, the first things you’ll need to do are:
> Decide on a domain name for your online store and register 
it, either via your webstore provider, or independently (see 
page 29). If you’re using a storefront this doesn’t apply.
> Get set up with your web-hosting company if you’re going 
with the WordPress option (see page 31). If you’re using any 
of the other options, you don’t need to worry about this.

Preparing to set up
CHOOSING A SYSTEM FOR YOUR ONLINE 
STORE, PLUS SOME OTHER TECHNICALITIES 
YOU NEED TO GET IN PLACE.
Choosing the right system is very important. 
Having set everything up, you don’t want to 
find the one you’ve chosen isn’t suitable. 
Luckily, many of the systems offer a trial 
account, enabling you to see how the 
system operates and the features it offers.
STOREFRONTS
In this book we focus on Amazon and eBay 
as these are the best choices if you want 
to start selling your products as quickly as 
possible, and to the widest audience. (You 
can also integrate one, or both, with some 
of the webstore systems we’ll look at.) 
However, there are other storefronts 
you may want to explore—see page 21.
WEBSTORES
To be included in this book, a system 
had to be easy and quick to set up with 
no technical knowledge, be secure, and 
look great. For the webstore section, the 
providers that fit this remit best are Wix, 
Shopify, Bigcommerce, and Volusion­—all 
looked at in detail in Chapter 7.
Wix has a super-easy interface that allows 
you to set it up very quickly and gives you 
complete control over the way your pages 
appear and the content you include on 
them. The templates look great, however 
Wix doesn’t offer as many features as the 
more sophisticated systems, and at present 
Choosing the right system 
FOR YOUR ONLINE STORE

the choice of payment gateways offered is 
limited. But if you want something very easy 
to set up and use, Wix could be for you.
Shopify is by far the slickest of the webstore 
systems with wonderful, highly customizable 
designs and an easy-to-use interface. You 
can set it up to work with multiple “apps”—
add-ons and third-party features—so you 
only pay for the extras you need. These can 
add up on top of your monthly fee, and (in 
most cases) there is a transaction charge 
on each item sold, which for people with 
tight margins may be a decisive no-no.
Bigcommerce doesn’t charge a transaction 
fee on sales and includes a very impressive 
list of features as an integral part of its 
package. The templates aren’t as dazzling as 
the feature list though. A further drawback 
is that the designs aren’t customizable at 
all without going into the code, and there 
is also a restriction on the number of 
products you can list for each pricing level.
Volusion just makes it into the remit. The 
interface is far from intuitive, and to adjust 
content, you need to make changes within 
the code. These are just about manageable 
for a non-coder, otherwise it wouldn’t be in 
this book, but don’t make this your choice 
unless you’re prepared for a steep learning 
curve. Volusion templates are very classy, 
but you can’t adjust them via the interface. 
The plus side, and the reason for including 
it, is that it is ultra-rich in functionality. Like 
Bigcommerce, there aren’t any transaction 
fees, although again you’re restricted at 
each price level regarding the number 
of products you can sell.
You may be surprised that we are not 
looking at Amazon Webstore and Yahoo 
Merchant in this book. These are hugely 
important systems that host some very 
large online stores. However, you’d need 
a serious amount of development to get 
a great-looking site running on either; both 
boast “easy” design tools, but the built-in 
systems aren’t adequate to get you some-
thing that looks good without employing 
a programmer. Bear in mind that the four 
webstore systems I have chosen to focus 
on may not be the only options that suit 
you (see page 25), and with DIY webstores 
being in demand, others will come into 
existence during the publication of this 
book, so check the companion website.
WORDPRESS 
The final system we focus on is WordPress, 
an altogether different kind of setup, as it 
requires you to host it yourself. This allows 
you to remain in charge of your online store 
in a way that you aren’t if you use a hosted 
system; your costs will also be lower since 
there are no monthly charges. You won’t 
need to do any coding, but it isn’t as easy 
to set up as some of the hosted webstore 
systems. (Note that there are several 
“plugins” that you can choose from to give 
a WordPress site e-commerce functionality—
the one selected for the walkthrough in this 
book is WooCommerce, but there are others 
that are popular as well.)
The chart on the following pages is designed 
to help you compare the systems we look at 
in detail in this book. (Don’t forget the other 
setups—see the pages after the chart for 
numerous other possibilities.)

How to choose which system is best for you
The following may help you when making a decision:
> How complicated is the system to operate?
> What payment options are available?
> Do you want to sell a large number of products, or are 
you going to expand to do so?
> How easy is it to upload a lot of products?
> Do you need a lot of storage space?
> Does the system allow you enough scope for branding?
> Do the templates correspond to your business’s image?
> Do you need a template that’s customizable—colors, fonts, 
etc.? Do you want to change the layout of your template, 
and if so, does the system allow you to?
> Are you able to access the code of the template, so that if 
you want to hire a programmer further down the line this 
will be an option for you?
> Do the templates have a mobile version?
> How detailed do your customer and sales reports need 
to be?
> Do you want to add your own SSL?
> Does it have an integrated blog, or are you happy to use 
an external one?
> Do you need an integrated email list, or are you happy to 
work with a third-party company, such as MailChimp?
> Do you need integration with suppliers and dropshippers?
> Do you need integrated shipping options, and are these 
applicable to the country where you are based?
> Does it allow you to sell downloadable products?
> Does it integrate with social media in the way that you 
need, for example allowing you to sell your products 
on Facebook?
> Does the webstore allow you to sell on multiple platforms, 
e.g. Amazon and eBay?
> Does it provide a product feed so that you can list your 
items with Google Shopping, etc.?
> Is there a way to allow your customers to leave reviews?
> What tracking options does it offer? Does it tie in with 
Google Analytics?
Choosing an online store 
system
Read through the rest of the 
book before making your choice 
and make a precise list of the 
features you need. Once you’re 
clear on this, you can look 
at each of the options you’re 
considering and see which 
one best meets your needs.
Missing a feature?
Don’t reject a webstore system 
because of a single feature it 
lacks—additional features are 
often added to keep up with 
competitors, so if you don’t see 
a feature you particularly want, 
it’s worth contacting support and 
asking if there are plans to add 
this feature in the near future.
TERMINOLOGY
Don’t worry if you don’t understand 
some of these terms, such as 
dropshipper, SSL, and Google 
Shopping. These different elements 
will be explained later in the book.

you also get your own independent, highly customizable store, 
a major advantage of this system. You can even use your own 
domain name for a small monthly fee.

Zibbet (www.zibbet.com)
Another handmade marketplace that’s been taking off hugely. 
As with ArtFire, there’s no listing fee or commission; you can 
sign up for a free account and sell with no charge at all, or pay 
a monthly/yearly fee which gives you access to more features.
Not On The High Street (www.notonthehighstreet.com)
A creative small-business marketplace. At the time of writing, 
it’s only for UK sellers, although there are plans to expand. 
ArtFire (www.artfire.com)
An alternative to Etsy, but you pay a flat monthly rate to sell 
your items, rather than a listing fee. 
Bonanza (www.bonanza.com)
An alternative to eBay, focusing on “everything that isn’t shiny, 
new, and mass-produced.” There are U.S., UK, Canadian, 
French, German, Mexican, and Spanish versions (at the time 
of writing), and there are no listing fees (you only pay when 
you sell). Sellers can chat online with their customers, and 
you can import directly from eBay and Etsy.

A rather more rarefied way of selling your artwork (as wall art, or 
reproduced on a select range of products). You set the price, and if 
you choose, your products may be picked by Society 6’s partners, 
one of which is Urban Outfitters, for sale through their site.

TIP
Selling on multiple platforms
There may be multiple storefront 
options that suit you, as well as 
the “main” selling outlet you are 
planning on creating. Just make 
sure that any additional system 
you choose fits in with the image 
you’re building of your business. 
Does your presence on that 
platform sit well with your brand?

OTHER WEBSTORE SYSTEMS
Big Cartel (bigcartel.com)
A simple and inexpensive way for artists and 
small-scale creators to set up an online store.  
You can sell up to 300 products via PayPal 
or Stripe, with no transaction fee (apart from 
PayPal’s payment processing). There’s an app 
that allows you to sell on Facebook, and the 
themes you can choose from are attractive and 
very easy to customize.

Squarespace (www.squarespace.com)
Until recently, Squarespace was mainly used 
for blogs and online creative portfolios, but 
now it offers e-commerce, which makes it 
a great option if you want a visually focused, 
ultra-slick, “designer” appearance for your 
store. At the time of writing, Squarespace is 
currently only available if you’re in the U.S., 
Canada, and the UK. Payments are accepted 
via Stripe, with no other option available.

Weebly (www.weebly.com)
An extremely user-friendly interface means 
creating a website is really easy and very 
affordable (free if you don’t mind a Weebly 
link and you can even get e-commerce with 
the basic, free setup); the tradeoff is that 
while there is a large selection, the templates 
aren’t as stunning-looking as they might be. 
Webs (www.webs.com)
Webs has been around for more than ten 
years and is a hugely popular all-in-one 
website builder. Like Weebly, the Webs 
interface is amazingly easy to use. You can 
sell online even with the free version, though 
you’re limited to five items (also note that 
the free version doesn’t offer support). A 
downside is that there aren’t many templates 
to choose from, but there is a good variety of 
apps, including a social media toolbar, Etsy 
shop, appointment-booker, and website chat.    
Jimdo (www.jimdo.com) 
Another user-friendly store builder (though 
not drag-and-drop), Jimdo runs in twelve 
different languages and offers good back-end 
store admin facilities (even available with the 
free version, although, as with Weebly, you’re 
limited to five items). Their support forum is 
impressive, but the designs aren’t the slickest. 
They have recently extended their range of 
templates though, for example to allow full-
screen video backgrounds.

C H A P T E R  2
Moonfruit (www.moonfruit.com)
An easy-to-use, UK-based system that 
allows you to create a great-looking site 
and sell products from it within minutes. 
While the e-commerce management side of 
things is rather basic, and the store system 
only accepts PayPal, the templates look 
great—they are among the best around—
and you can easily integrate your shop into 
Facebook. The free version allows you to set 
up a shop selling unlimited products, but the 
Moonfruit branding will be visible, as shown 
in the screenshots; at the time of writing, 
a blog feature for the latest version was 
under development. 
Create (www.create.net)
Another UK-based webstore system with an 
impressive feature list and an easy-to-use 
interface. Favored by the craft community, 
Create accepts a range of payment gateways 
and caters to users worldwide.

How to choose a DOMAIN NAME
In order to get up and running, 
you will need to decide on and 
purchase a domain name for 
your new webstore. (Your 
domain name is your address 
on the web, something like 
www.yourstore.com.)  
Most webstore systems will 
allow you to run your store with 
the initial address they give you 
(for example, www.mystore.
mybigcommerce.com), but in 
order to look like a professional 
business, you really need to 
purchase your own domain 
name. (Note that with the vast 
majority of storefronts, you 
don’t get the option of using 
your own domain.)
Your domain name could be:
> your brand name or 
business name
> a name composed of search 
engine keywords (such as the 
kind of products you sell)
> something creative that’s 
altogether different (see 
“Ideas for domain names”)
When choosing a domain
name, make sure you don’t 
choose anything that’s too 
similar to your competition. 
Do also check your chosen 
name doesn’t resemble 
anyone else’s trademark.
Ideas for domain names
Many .com domain names have 
already been registered. Here 
are some ideas to help you find 
something available or come up 
with something new.
> Use a phrase or slogan.
> Use a deliberate misspelling
> Invent a name.
> Combine words. 
> Use words from different 
languages.
> Use your brand or business 
name and add “store,” “web,” 
or something else on to 
the end.
> Make use of one of the many 
online tools that can help you 
come up with something 
unique (see the box below).
Online tools to help you come up with a name
> www.dotomator.com
> namestation.com
> www.nameboy.com
> www.domainsbot.com
> www.randomainer.com
> impossibility.org
> domai.nr (getting creative with unusual and 
country-specific extensions)

30
C H A P T E R  2
CHOOSING AN EXTENSION 
The extension (also known as 
“TLD,” top level domain) is the 
part of the domain name after 
the dot, i.e. the “com” or the 
“co.uk” part.
In most cases, it’s advisable 
to choose a .com domain, as 
it looks most professional, and 
can be remembered easily.
However, choosing a country-
specific extension such as 
.co.uk, .fr, .es, and so on, may 
suit you better if you don’t want 
to do business globally, for 
example if shipping costs 
make this prohibitive.
REGISTERING YOUR 
DOMAIN NAME
For many, the easiest option 
will be to register your domain 
name via your webstore provider. 
However, if you’re not certain 
whether you will remain with 
the same system indefinitely, 
it makes sense to register it 
independently with a registrar.
Two reliable domain 
name registrars are: 
Godaddy 
(www.godaddy.com)  
Namecheap 
(www.namecheap.com)
For international 
registrations, look at:

Do compare prices for 
international registrations, as 
these can vary significantly.
If you register your domain 
with an independent registrar, 
you’ll need to change the 
nameserver settings from within 
the management area of your 
registrar’s website. This will 
connect your domain name to 
your new webstore. Look for 
“DNS” or “Domain Name Server 
Setup” from within the admin 
area; your webstore provider will 
give you the correct nameserver 
information to paste into the 
fields in this area. You may find 
it takes several hours for your 
nameservers to switch over.
NEW EXTENSIONS
As of 2014, a number of new domain 
extensions are due to become 
available, including .shop, .store, 
.book, .fun, and dozens more.
TIP
Researching domain names
Googling a domain name isn’t 
a sure-fire way to see if it is 
available. The owner may simply 
not be using it. Instead, search 
for it via a registrar’s website, 
such as Godaddy. To find out 
who the owner is of an already-
registered domain name, try 
betterwhois.com.

Website hosting is the space 
you rent in cyberspace to house 
your new website. For the 
webstore and storefront systems 
looked at in this book, you will 
not need to take out your own 
website hosting, as this will be 
included in your package. But if 
you are going for the WordPress 
option, you will need to get set 
up with a web host in order to 
set up your webstore.
HOW TO CHOOSE A 
WEB HOST
There are hundreds of web 
hosting companies to choose 
from and it’s essential that yours 
is reliable—you don’t want to 
find your website is “unavailable” 
to potential customers.
As far as technicalities go, 
in order to set up WordPress, 
you need to choose a hosting 
package capable of running PHP 
and MySQL. You will almost 
certainly also want to choose 
a company that features a 
“one-click” WordPress install, 
as this will make your setup 
infinitely easier than installing 
WordPress manually. (You may 
see this feature mentioned by 
name as “Fantastico,” “Simple 
Scripts,” or “Installatron”—
whichever system your web 
host uses is absolutely fine.)
Website hosting FOR WORDPRESS
You’ll most likely be able to 
see the web host’s “uptime” 
record posted on its website—
if you can see that it is “up” (i.e. 
running correctly) 99 or 100% 
of the time, you can be assured 
its service is reliable. It must also 
offer 24/7 technical support 
so that if you ever run into any 
difficulties, you can be certain 
of a prompt response.
In addition, you may want to 
choose a hosting package that 
offers unlimited storage—so that 
you don’t have to worry about 
the number of products you 
showcase or the number of 
images of them you upload 
to the site—and unlimited 
bandwidth, to be sure you can 
cope with the impact of a flood 
of traffic to your site. Unlimited 
email addresses is also a good 
idea, so if you need to, you can 
set up different email addresses 
for sales, enquiries, after sales, 
press, and so on.
Recommended hosts that 
offer all the above criteria are: 
Bluehost 
(www.bluehost.com) 
Dreamhost 
(www.dreamhost.com) 
You will find others that fulfil 
your criteria, and the choice is 
entirely yours. However, if your 
language is not English, you will 
probably want to set up with 
a local host that offers you the 
features discussed above, so 
that you can access support 
in your own language.
SHARED OR VIRTUAL 
PRIVATE SERVER (VPS)?
A “shared” hosting package will 
usually be adequate for the needs 
of a small- to medium-sized 
webstore, but if in doubt, ask 
the hosting company.
SHOPPING CART SOFTWARE
There are excellent, multi-featured 
“open source” shopping cart softwares 
(meaning they are free and available 
to everyone) that you can use if you 
have your own web host setup. The 
best are Zen Cart, OsCommerce, 
and PrestaShop. We are not focusing 
on these in the book as to use them 
the average person would need 
some technical knowledge or 
professional help, but if you do have 
some technical skill, you may find 
one of these systems suits your 
needs perfectly.

Bluehost is a reputable host perfect for a WordPress installation. Above: www.bluehost.com
Registering your name through your hosting company
Most web hosts will include a domain name with your package. This is an easy option to go for, 
in that you will be dealing with one company rather than two. However, if you anticipate changing 
your web host at any time in the future, or using an all-in-one webstore later down the line, 
registering your domain name with an independent registrar may make your life easier later on.  
While it’s fine to register your domain name with your hosting company, it is not advisable to 
take out web hosting with a domain name registrar, although it’s likely they will offer it to you—
a dedicated hosting company will usually meet your hosting requirements better.

As soon as we log into Amazon.com, the padlock and the “https://” in the address bar shows us our details are secure.
SSL
SSL stands for “Secure Sockets Layer” 
and is a system used to encrypt sensitive 
information input via your website, such 
as your customers’ credit card numbers 
and other personal data, helping to keep 
it safe from hackers.  
It isn’t always necessary to have your 
website protected by SSL. For example, if 
your customers are submitting a payment to 
you via PayPal, if they type their information 
directly into the PayPal interface, they are 
protected by PayPal’s SSL. But with many 
webstore systems, your customers will be 
typing their information into your shopping 
cart interface, so even if you are using 
PayPal to accept their payment, you do 
need SSL to make sure they are protected.
Some webstore systems include an 
SSL certificate, but some require you 
to purchase one independently. This will 
vary from system to system, so consult 
the comparison table on pages 16–19 for 
information, or ask the webstore provider 
for more precise details.
It’s a fact that customers are often reassured
by seeing the “https://” at the beginning of
your website address; it shows that SSL is 
in place on the website, so any transactions 
that occur will do so in a secure environment. 
This may be enough of a reason to purchase 
an SSL certificate, even when it isn’t strictly 
necessary. This won’t be a concern if you’re 
operating a storefront as your payments 
will be processed by Amazon or eBay and 
therefore protected by Amazon or eBay’s 
security system.

Taking payment online
IN ORDER TO COLLECT PAYMENT FROM YOUR 
CUSTOMERS VIA YOUR ONLINE STORE, YOU NEED 
TO HAVE A PAYMENT SYSTEM SET UP.
PayPal is king when it comes to taking 
money quickly and easily online. Most of 
the systems talked about in this book offer 
PayPal as a payment processor, and for 
some (though not the ones we focus on in 
detail), it’s the only way that you can take 
payments from your customers. Amazon is 
an exception, in that they pay you directly 
into your bank account; Squarespace (see 
page 26) only works with Stripe. Some of 
the stores that allow you to sell your designs 
online (see pages 21–28) may pay you 
directly, but for the most part, PayPal is the 
obvious, and in some cases the only, option.
If you don’t have an account, it’s simple 
to set one up at www.paypal.com. In order 
to accept credit or debit card payments 
(rather than just having your customers 
pay you from their PayPal account, which 
is limiting if it’s the only option), you need 
to sign up for, or upgrade to, a Premier or 
Business account. The main difference 
between a Premier and Business account 
is that you can’t use your business name 
with a Premier account. 
For your account to be functional, PayPal 
needs first to verify your bank account, 
which can be done quickly via online 
banking. PayPal will transfer a small amount 
of money to your account with a number 
as a reference; you then type this into your 
PayPal account. For a Business account,

ACCEPTING PAYMENTS WITH PAYPAL VIA YOUR WEBSTORE
With some webstore systems you have a choice of PayPal payment solutions, although these will vary 
depending on where you are based. The most commonly used option (and the only one, with many systems) 
is PayPal Payments Standard. Here, the customer is taken to the PayPal site to make their payment, then 
transferred back to your webstore afterward. Some webstore systems may offer you other options: PayPal 
Payments Advanced, for which there is a monthly fee, allows the customers to check out on your site without 
transferring to PayPal; PayPal Payments Pro, with a higher monthly fee, also allows you to accept credit cards 
by phone or mail. PayPal Express Checkout is an additional option for you to offer your customers if you’re 
using an alternative payment gateway, so that they can pay quickly and easily by PayPal if they choose to.

however, PayPal will need to give you 
approval, which can take several days. 
To set up a Business account, you need 
to have your business information to hand, 
including your business bank account details 
and your business address (the precise 
details required will vary from country to 
country). If you don’t have all this ready yet, 
or you’re in a hurry to start taking payment 
from your site, you can sign up for a Premier 
account, get your bank account verified, 
and upgrade to a Business account at a later 
date. To sign up for a Premier account, you 
need to register for a Personal account, and 
you’ll then be asked if you want a Premier 
account during the signup process.

Merchant accounts, payment 
gateways, AND PAYMENT PROCESSORS
If you are planning to sell 
in large quantities, sooner or 
later you’ll probably want to 
sign up for a payment gateway/
merchant account system to use 
with your online store (assuming 
that option is there with the 
platform you choose to use).  
An internet merchant account 
is a special bank account that 
accepts payments from your 
online business, while a payment 
gateway functions as the 
intermediary between your 
online store and your bank 
account. Although you’ll have 
to pay a monthly fee if you 
use a merchant account with 
a payment gateway setup, the 
transaction fees for each sale 
will be lower, which will save you 
money if you’re selling in any 
quantity. You’ll also receive the 
payments automatically into 
your account, rather than having 
to withdraw them to your bank 
account manually from PayPal 
(sometimes waiting several 
days for the funds to transfer, 
depending on your bank). 
A third reason why you might 
want to set up your own 
merchant account system is 
that it makes your online store 
look more professional and 
serves to boost credibility.
It can sometimes be difficult 
for a small business to open 
an internet merchant account 
directly from its bank, so to 
get around this problem, some 
payment gateways offer you 
a merchant account as part of 
the package; other third-party 
systems exist—see below—that 
offer you an all-in-one, and 
altogether simpler, means of 
processing your payments.
The payment system you put 
in place will depend both on the 
online store setup you choose, 
and the country you are based 
in. Some webstore providers 
have developed their own 
all-in-one systems that allow 
you to take payment directly 
from your store, which avoids 
going through a third-party 
setup completely—Shopify, 
Bigcommerce, and Volusion 
all offer such a system, but it’s 
only available for U.S. applicants 
(or U.S. and Canada, in the case 
of Shopify’s version). 
These webstore providers all 
offer alternative international 
third-party payment processors: 
Authorize.net, SagePay, PSIGate, 
WorldPay, Stripe, and Realex, to 
name a few. With WooCommerce 
(the e-commerce plugin for 
WordPress we’ll be using in 
Chapter 8), you also have a 
range of options, although you 
will have to buy an extension to 
go with the payment gateway 
you choose.
It may take some time to 
get your payment processing 
system fully functional. Many 
online sellers use PayPal as a 
first step, since it’s usually very 
easy to upgrade a personal 
PayPal account to an account 
that lets you take payments 
online. Then, once they’ve 
started selling from their store, 
they move on to a merchant 
account/payment gateway or 
third-party payment system.

37
Offer several payment methods to 
your customers
You want to make it as easy as possible for your 
customers to pay you. Even if you get your own 
merchant account system so customers don’t 
have to go via PayPal to pay by credit or debit 
card, it makes sense to offer the choice of 
paying by PayPal as an alternative, and also (if 
Shopify’s all-in-one payment system makes accepting payment 
online easier than using a third-party payment gateway; 
Bigcommerce and Volusion offer a similar service, but at the 
time of writing these are not available for international users.
Accepting payments via WordPress
If you’re using WordPress for your online store, 
and are going to use a version of PayPal other 
than PayPal Payments Standard or any other 
payment processor, you’ll need an extension to 
connect your payment provider with your store 
and make sure it is PCI compliant. You can 
either purchase a premium extension to work 
with your payment processor, or you can sign 
it’s feasible for you, as it will mean extra work) 
by check sent in the mail. Depending entirely on 
the kind of business you run, cash on delivery is 
another option you might want to consider, as 
well as taking payment by credit card over 
the phone.
up for Mijireh Checkout, a low-cost checkout 
system that comes bundled with WooCommerce. 
It is free to set up and meets all the required 
security standards. Transactions (after the first 
five) cost $.50 at the time of writing, on top of 
your other payment processor fees. (See Chapter 
15 for more details about PCI compliance.)

The look of the site
THE IMAGE YOU PRESENT TO THE WORLD.
The way your website looks is essential. 
It’s the only chance you get to present your 
business to the world. Unlike with a brick-
and-mortar store, you won’t get a chance 
to engage your customers in conversation 
to help them decide to buy; if the first sight 
of your webstore fails to engage with your 
customers, they will click away.
With a storefront on a big marketplace, 
you won’t be able to customize your site to 
a large degree, but you can make sure you 
have a good logo to reinforce your branding 
and look as professional as possible.
One advantage of a webstore, over a site 
built from scratch, is that you’ll be starting 
from a beautiful and polished template, 
which you’ll then customize. There’s no 
doubt that your site will look professional, 
and essential aspects such as clarity of 
layout and usability, which are major factors 
to consider, will already have been covered.
However, what you do need to invest serious 
thought into is the right “look and feel” for 
your customers. Think about who you are 
selling to. What kind of look and feel would 
your prospective customers want? What 
kind of image do you want to create of 
your business? Does your site need to look 
commercial and well-established, or should 
it look more personal and quirky? Should 
it look modern, or traditional? Are your 
customers conservative, or cutting-edge? 
Your site needs to resonate with your 
customers from the get-go, so spend time 
imagining how they’d like your site to look.

Your LOGO
Your online business needs 
to have an effective logo. A 
logo performs some essential 
functions. First off, it makes your 
site memorable and distinguishes 
your business from the other 
webstores, perhaps selling 
similar products, that your 
potential customers will almost 
certainly also visit. It needs to 
be correctly pitched and fit the 
image you want to display, so 
that straightaway it will resonate 
with your customers and they’ll 
be more easily persuaded you’re 
the company they want to do 
business with. A great-looking 
logo will also make you look 
professional from the moment 
they click onto your site, and 
this is the first step to creating 
trust with your customers. 
Since it’s so important, you 
may want to get a logo 
designed professionally. There 
are a number of online services 
that can do this for you—see 
the box below right.
 A logo makes your site look professional, as well as creating a memorable visual 
reminder for your potential customers. From top: www.littlejoydesigns.co.uk,

transparent background so that 
you can use it on your site, no

Using an individual font can be a simple and effective way of creating a logo, and 
is a great solution if you haven’t budgeted for something professionally designed. 
From top: tattly.com, camilaprada.com, littersf.com, undrest.com
Alternatively, an easy and 
effective way to create a logo 
yourself is simply to choose a 
distinctive font that suits the 
image of your business, and 
create a “logo” by writing your 
business or store name in this 
font. Any graphics software, 
such as Photoshop, Photoshop 
Elements, or Gimp, will enable 
you to do this, or you can simply 
use the free online service Pixlr.
com (as shown on the following 
page). Try www.1001freefonts.
com for interesting fonts you 
can download to your computer. 
It’s for both Mac and PC, and 
downloading and installing a 
font to your computer will also 
make it accessible in Pixlr. 
Since you’re using the font for 
commercial use, you’ll need to 
upgrade to their paid-for 
commercial package, but the 
price is extremely reasonable.
REINFORCING YOUR BRAND
Once you have your logo you’ll
want to use it on your stationery—
letterheads, bills, wrapping materials, 
etc. Postcards, stickers, and printed 
labels are also good ways of 
reinforcing your branding. Have a 
look at Moo.com for ideas. Other 
ways to echo your website branding 
are to use your website accent colors 
on labels or packaging, or carry the 
fonts used on the site through to any 
other printed material—price lists, 
compliment slips, and the like.

The content of the site
THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF YOUR SITE 
AND WHERE TO PUT IT.
THE HOME PAGE
The home page is the first page that your 
customers see, so it has to engage them 
immediately. Your layout may depend on 
the template you choose, but here are 
some points to consider.
First off, you want to show your visitors 
straightaway that you can provide what 
they are looking for. So, you’ll want to 
display your bestselling products, or at least 
have very visible links to them. A “slider” 
or “carousel”—that is, a large enclosed area 
toward the top of the page that rotates, 
either automatically or when an arrow is 
clicked—is a common way of displaying 
important content in the most prominent 
position on the home page. You can put 
special offers, seasonal products, new 
products, or your bestsellers here, where 
you’re sure people will see them. Be aware 
that the text you put on your home page is 
of great importance to the search engines. 
It’s easy to find that your home page is 
mostly images—pictures of bestsellers, new 
products, etc.—but make sure you have text, 
including your main search terms, as well. 
(We’ll look more thoroughly at search 
engines in Chapter 11.)
In addition, think about your USP—your 
“unique selling point.” If your products are 
the best, or the cheapest, or you have the 
best deals, point this out very obviously. 
If you have a special deal, such as free

A slider (or carousel) 
with rotating content is a 
great way of displaying 
important information 
to make sure no-one 
misses it. From above: 
www.giftlab.com, www.
shoplatitude.com, 
www.elvafields.com
Getting creative with your slider images
Notice as you browse other online stores on the web how they have composed 
each of the images that make up their slider sequence. Each usually includes 
explanatory text as part of the image—as you can see on the websites shown 
on this page—with a call to action such as “Shop Now” to encourage the visitor 
to click on the image and be drawn further into the store. You can also combine 
several elements within one slider image.

OTHER PAGES
As well as the pages that 
describe your products, you’ll 
want to include the following 
pages on your site:
> About—your chance to make 
the business come to life for 
your potential customers. If 
you can engage them, you 
stand a chance of converting 
them into buyers.
> Contact—include a telephone 
number, if possible, and a 
street address to show you’re 
a bona fide business.
> Shipping/Delivery—say which 
countries you ship to, what the 
costs are, and how long 
delivery is expected to take.
> Return policy—state the time 
limit for returning unwanted 
goods, and whether return 
shipping is free.
> Terms & conditions—these 
need to be published on your 
site, and some systems will 
oblige your customers to 
check a checkbox to say they 
agree with them before they 
order (see Chapter 15).
> Privacy policy—this is a legal 
requirement (as above, see 
Chapter 15).
> Cookies—a cookie declaration 
is a requirement for websites 
based in the EU (again, see 
Chapter 15).
> Frequently Asked Questions 
(FAQ)/Help—this is a chance 
to answer any questions your 
customers have that may 
prevent them from buying.
> Press—show existing coverage, 
give links to online coverage, 
and give the contact details of 
the person who will deal with 
press enquiries.
Other elements you may want to include
> A search box so customers can find what they’re looking for 
easily within your store.
> An email mailing list signup form—we’ll talk more about email 
lists in Chapter 13.
> Social media badges and “share/follow” buttons—we’ll go into 
detail about social media (Facebook, Twitter, and the like) in 
Chapter 12.
> Reviews
> Testimonials
> A blog—we’ll see more about blogs in Chapter 10.
Your About page is the place to let 
your customers know more about you, 
your vision, and the business. Here, 
a photograph of the founders and 
an introductory video make sure 
the visitor is fully engaged. Above: 
www.brika.com
Your Contact page needs to show 
your street address and give a 
telephone number where you can 
be reached in case of queries.

Writing your TEXT
When you’re putting together 
the text for your store, there 
are certain aspects of writing for 
the web that you should bear in 
mind in order to make your text 
as effective as possible. Creating 
text for a website isn’t at all the 
same as creating text for a 
printed document.
First off, when reading a website, 
people want the information 
they’re looking for right away. 
Their attention spans are shorter 
when reading onscreen, perhaps 
because of the huge amount of 
information readily available to 
them. So, say what you need to 
say as clearly as possible, and 
don’t be too wordy. If you have 
a lot of information you need to 
include, you don’t have to cut 
it short, just break it up into 
easily digestible paragraphs and 
use plenty of visual signposts
—headings, subheadings, and 
bullet points.  
Make sure you leave plenty 
of blank space to give the eyes 
a break, and be sure your most 
important points are visible right 
away. These should be at the 
top of the page, in bold or in 
a larger heading style, and not 
hidden deep within paragraphs 
of text far down the page. 
Another aspect to consider 
is making your copy customer-
centric. Rather than telling 
visitors how great your business 
is, focus on how your products 
will help your customer. Think 
of benefits for the customer, 
not features, as you create your 
page text and your product 
descriptions. (There are some 
great examples over the page.)
Remember to keep your copy 
lively. You may have dozens of 
pages to create text for, and this 
may seem daunting, but keep it 
interesting! Your aim is to keep 
the customers on the page long 
enough to inspire them to buy 
from you—they’ll quickly click 
away if your copy sounds tired 
or boring.
Your website text should also 
include specific calls to action. 
Make use of direct requests 
to “click here,” “order now,” or 
“buy” to inspire your visitors 
to make that crucial step.
Also think about the style 
of your writing. Whether it is 
formal or less formal will depend 
on your target market, but 
remember that you can also 
sound fun and interesting, at 
the same time as professional.
Finally, but crucially, when 
crafting your page text, think 
in terms of the search engines. 
You are writing for the search 
engines as well as for your 
customers. Your headings 
should include major search 
terms, and your product 
descriptions should be rich 
in keywords. We will look at 
search engines in more detail 
in Chapter 11; it’s a good idea to 
read and absorb the information 
in that chapter before you start 
writing your website text.
Pay attention to your text
Double-check for typos and 
grammar mistakes. It’s very easy 
to overlook these in copy you’ve 
written yourself, so if possible, 
ask someone else with a good 
eye for detail to look for mistakes 
for you. It’s very important for 
your website visitors to see 
that your site looks professional, 
and a silly spelling mistake may 
undermine their trust in you; if 
your site looks sloppy, how can 
they trust you with their credit 
card details, and to deliver 
their purchases on time?

Different writing styles are appropriate for different types of 
website. Note that even though the Amazon text (right) is more 
formal, the copywriter has taken care to make the product text 
highlight the benefits of the product. 
Above: www.soworthloving.com, above right: www.amazon.com
The text of this webstore successfully engages the visitor 
by presenting the story of the products they are selling.
Above: hiutdenim.co.uk
“A must-have for lovers of coziness, the 
lightweight material of this slouchy 
pullover makes this SWL original a 
perfect candidate for layering flannels,

are worth love and to be comfortable in 
your own skin and to step out fearlessly 
into the world. You might stumble, you 
might sway, but we promise we’ll always

“Our Story: Our town used to make 
35,000 pairs of jeans every week for 
40 years employing 400 people. Then 
in 2001 the factory closed. So we 
decided 4 decades worth of know-how 
shouldn’t go to waste. That’s why the 
Hiut Denim Company was born: To get 
the town making jeans again.”

This is a brilliant example of product text 
that is interesting to read and entirely 
customer-centric. While all the features 
of the hair-styling tongs are clearly listed, 
each of them is presented as a benefit to 
the customer. Above: www.johnlewis.com/
ghd-iv-hair-styler-mk4/p231760887
Describing your products
There is some debate as to 
whether product descriptions 
are better long or short. In my 
opinion, longer is better for two 
reasons: first, you want to tell 
your customers everything they 
need to know in order to buy 
the product, and second, as long 
as all the content is relevant, 
longer descriptions are ideal 
material for the search engines. 
Just make sure you break 
up the text with line spaces, 
subheadings, and bullets, as 
mentioned, so your readers 
don’t get lost while reading.
The following points are key 
when creating descriptions for 
your products:
> Make sure the product heading 
has the most important 
keywords in it, using a 
subheading if necessary 
for secondary keywords or 
phrases (see Chapter 11).
> Keep your product 
descriptions interesting.
> Give your customers all the 
information they need to know 
to buy. Don’t leave them with 
any unanswered questions. 
This may be the difference 
between whether they buy 
from you, or from another 
competing website.
> Be sure to list all the features 
of your products, and wherever 
you can, present these as 
benefits to your customers, 
as shown in the example right.
In summary, think about your 
customers. What’s in it for them 
to buy your product? 
On your individual product 
pages, you should include:
> All information the 
customer may require, 
including features, 
dimensions, etc.
> Details of all possible 
variations—size, color, etc.
> Reviews, preferably 
independent ones. If your 
system doesn’t allow you 
to include reviews, you can 
always include them in the 
product description text.
> Photos of different angles, 
details, etc. (see the next 
page).

Photographing your PRODUCTS
The importance of good 
photography can’t be 
overemphasized; bad photos 
can completely undermine the 
effect you’ve worked so hard 
to achieve. If at all possible, get 
your products photographed 
professionally, or ask your 
suppliers if they have good 
product photographs that 
you can use. However, bear in 
mind that all photographs you 
show on the site should be in 
the same style, so you won’t 
want to use some provided by 
the supplier, as well as some you 
or someone else has taken.
If the cost of hiring a 
photographer is prohibitive, 
> Create a staging area in which to place the 
products. Consider the horizontal surface 
that the item will rest on, and the vertical 
area behind it. Alternatively, buy a roll of 
white paper and unroll it so that it provides 
a continuous backdrop and horizontal 
surface, thereby creating a completely white, 
professional-looking background. Or buy 
a lightbox (also called a light tent)—these 
are very inexpensive, so if you have a large 
number of photographs to take for your 
site, it may be worth the investment.
> You may want to add other just-visible items 
to create an atmosphere (for example, other 
tableware items such as knife and fork, glass, 
napkin, if you are displaying a plate), but don’t 
let these distract from the main item.
> Surround the item with multiple light sources, 
so there aren’t any harsh shadows on one side 
of the object. A lightbox (light tent) is ideal as 
it diffuses the light, preventing any glare. 
Holding a sheet of paper between the light 
and the item you’re photographing is another 
way of reducing glare (don’t tape the paper as 
it could be a fire risk—get someone to hold it 
for you).
> Make sure you zoom in on the product (or crop 
it afterwards)—you don’t want too much extra 
space around it. 
> Eliminate camera shake and create a consistent 
angle for your photos by propping your 
camera on a level surface, or by using a tripod.  
> Take care to make your lighting consistent by 
using similar lighting conditions for each series 
of shots.
> Make use of the Macro mode, if your camera 
has this option, to shoot details. This will 
mean your main subject is in focus, but the 
background is not, and the photo will have 
a professional look.
here are some tips for 
photographing your products 
yourself. Today’s smartphone 
cameras are so sophisticated 
that if you don’t have access to 
anything more fancy, you’ll find 
that with a little care and by 
following the tips below, you 
can achieve results that are 
perfectly adequate.
Tips for photographing your products yourself

51
PREPARING YOUR IMAGES 
FOR THE WEB
Use a graphics software such 
as Photoshop Elements, Gimp, 
or Pixlr.com to crop your photos 
and resize them to the exact 
pixel dimension they need to 
be for your site. (Images for 
websites are measured in pixels, 
but your system may refer to 
the proportion that the images 
should be, instead of giving pixel 
dimensions.) Your webstore 
system might crop and resize 
your images automatically, but 
doing it yourself beforehand 
allows you total control over the 
way the images are cropped, 
and prevents any distortion.
You may find that there is a 
limit to the file size you can 
upload to your store. If this is 
the case, use software such 
as those mentioned above to 
reduce the size of the image.
Your photos should be saved 
as .jpg or .jpeg format.
TIP
Get ideas for product photos
Spend some time looking at other 
webstores, noting carefully the 
way in which their products are 
photographed. Is there an effect 
you particularly like? Can you 
achieve a similar effect?
Using the Crop tool in Pixlr, you can choose the “Aspect ratio” or “Output size” 
drop-down to resize your image.
When you save your file from Pixlr, you can reduce the file size, if necessary, 
using the Quality slider.

A current trend is to photograph items 
in an informal setting on a nice-looking 
wooden tabletop, with other items visible 
to create an atmosphere.

53
TIP
Include as many photographs 
of your products as you can on 
your site  
Some systems give you a “zoom” 
facility, but if yours doesn’t, you can 
still include close-ups of details. If 
some of your products are available 
with variations, e.g. in color, include 
photos of the variations as well. 
Customers will want to see whole 
items of clothing in the different 
colors available, rather than a swatch 
that doesn’t really show them what 
it will look like.
Multiple images showing different angles with a zoom facility 
allows your customers to see clearly what you’re offering.

Building TRUST
Establishing trust with your 
website visitors is a big part 
of converting them into paying 
customers. When they arrive on 
your site they don’t know you, 
and, unlike in a brick-and-mortar 
store, you can’t chat with them 
to make them feel comfortable.
Your About page is a chance 
to present your business as one 
with real people behind it; we’ve 
also mentioned how you should 
give a telephone number on your 
Contact page if possible, and 
show your real-life street address. 
Even after you’ve made a sale, 
take care to look after your 
customer. Build a relationship 
with them—if you cherish your 
customers, you stand a good 
chance of turning them into 
repeat customers.
The following measures will also help reinforce the feeling 
that your business is trustworthy:
> Offer a no-quibbles guarantee so that your visitors can feel 
confident enough to buy, and offer free shipping for returns, 
if this is viable. 
> Be upfront about delivery charges.  
> State clearly when something is out of stock. Customers 
hate to feel they may be tricked into making an order when 
something isn’t actually available. 
> Allow customers plenty of time to return goods.
> Keep the customer informed. Confirm dispatch, and, when 
possible, give tracking numbers. 
> Display payment gateway badges when possible.
> Display any badges of groups and associations you belong to.
> Publish testimonials and reviews on your site.
Displaying payment gateway badges can help your customers feel secure.
Displaying delivery information clearly—
charges, and the time it will take for the goods 
to reach the customer—helps your visitors 
believe your business is trustworthy. 
Right: www.lucylovesthis.com.

55
Publishing your returns policy prominently will help your 
customers feel you’re trustworthy and give them confidence 
to buy. Above: www.goodasgold.co.nz
Showing testimonials, as well as the logos of well-known 
publications in which the products have been featured, adds 
to the impression that this is a trustworthy and successful 
company. Left: camilaprada.com

SETTING UP A STOREFRONT WITHIN A 
WELL-KNOWN MARKETPLACE IS A VERY 
EASY WAY OF SELLING ONLINE, AND 
ONE THAT CAN BE VERY SUCCESSFUL.
Setting up an Amazon storefront is one of 
the quickest ways of getting your products 
out there for sale; as soon as you sign up 
as a seller and start listing your products, 
you’ll instantly have access to the millions 
of potential customers who use Amazon. 
Your products will show up when someone 
searches those products, whether or not 
they know of your existence or even visit 
your storefront where all your products are 
listed together. When you choose to 
list your products on Amazon, you avoid 
the costs of setting up your own online 
store, and while you don’t get much of 
an opportunity to build your brand as the 
customization possibilities are very limited, 
your customers already know and trust 
Amazon, and you get to benefit from this 
before you’ve generated your first review, 
or even made a single sale.

Sign-up requirements
In order to sign up for an Amazon storefront you 
need to have a phone number where you can be 
reached, your tax information on hand, and an 
internationally chargeable credit card (so your 
fees can be deducted even if you don’t make 
any sales). 
To be paid, you need a bank account in the U.S., 
the UK, or the eurozone. You don’t need to be 
based in the U.S. to sign up to sell on Amazon.
com, but you do need to be able to ship to the 
U.S. (whether or not you use the Fulfillment by 
Amazon service), and to conduct all customer 
service in English.  
SETTING UP YOUR AMAZON 
STOREFRONT

Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)
One of the great benefits of listing on Amazon—apart from 
being able to access such a huge marketplace of customers 
ready to order—is the option to use Fulfillment by Amazon. 
This is a fabulous service that allows Amazon to handle all your 
order fulfillment for you, from storing your products to packing 
and shipping them, and even dealing with customer service. 
It works on a pay-as-you-go basis, so you’re only charged for 
orders that are fulfilled, and your customers can benefit from 
free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime at no extra cost 
to you. Plus, the “Fulfillment by Amazon” badge that will display 
next to your product listing helps build customers’ confidence 
in buying from you. Note you can also use the FBA system 
for your dispatch, independently of an Amazon storefront.
AN “INDIVIDUAL” OR A 
“PROFESSIONAL” ACCOUNT?
There are certain categories of 
products you can’t sell without a 
Professional account, including 
jewelry, collectibles, and car parts, 
for which you need to get approval. 
If you’re unsure of which service you 
need to sign up for, go to this page:
services.amazon.com/selling/
benefits.htm, where there’s a table 
comparing what you can and can’t 
do with each. If you’re planning to 
sell more than 40 items a month, 
you need a Professional account.
3.	 Follow the registration 
process; you can sign in 
with an existing Amazon 
account, or you can create 
a new account. During the 
process you’ll receive an 
email welcoming you to 
Amazon Seller Central, but 
you won’t actually be able 
to access this until you have 
completed the registration 
process. The process has 
five parts:
i. Your Selling Plan—this is 
where you choose between 
an Individual or Professional 
account and whether 
you’re going to use the 
Fulfillment by Amazon 
service (you’d come back 
here if you wanted to 	 	
 change your plan in 
 the future). 
	
ii. Your Seller Information—
your address.
	
iii. Your Charge Method—
your bank account 
information.
	
iv. Your Identity Verification—
you can choose to either 
receive a call or a text 
message giving you a 
PIN number that you 
input into the system 
to confirm verification.
	
v. Your Tax Identity 
Information—this will 
be checked, but you can 
go on and set up your 
products once you’ve 
input your information.

4.	 Having completed your 
registration, you’ll find 
yourself inside Seller Central. 
This is where you upload 
your product details (as well 
as access your orders, 
reports, feedback, etc.). 
Products can be added to 
Amazon’s product catalog 
individually—you can either 
add a product that is already 
for sale by someone else on 
Amazon, or create an entirely 
new listing for the product if 
it isn’t already in the Amazon 
catalog. Alternatively, you 
can upload product 
information via a spreadsheet 
created from a downloadable 
template that is specific 
to the type of products 
you’re inputting.
Adding a new product to Amazon’s catalog requires a product code.
What is an SKU?
An “SKU,” or Stock-Keeping 
Unit, is the code or number 
assigned by a merchant to a 
particular product so that it 
can be tracked for inventory 
purposes. You’ll need to 
assign different SKUs to 
every variation of a product, 
for example an item of 
clothing in a particular 
size will have one SKU, 
a different size will have 
a different SKU, the same 
size but a different color 
will have yet another SKU, 
and so on.
Product Name:
(Max 250 characters. Please include the size and color of the item in 
the Product Name, if available.)
Supply enough information to make 
the buying decision easy, Please 
ensure that all products and content 
comply with our Selling polices and 
restrictions including the Restricted 
Products policy.
Manufacturer:
(An alphanumeric string; 1 character minimum in length and 50 
characters maximum in length. UPC or manufacturer + 
mfr-part-number is required)
Brand Name:
(Max. 50 characters)
Model Number:
(Product code assigned by the manufacturer; can be numbers, letters 
or both)
Package Quantity:
(Quantity of the item for sale in one package)
Manufacturer Part Number:
(For most products, this will be identical to the model number; 
however some manufacturersdistinguish part numbers from model 
number.)
line-size:
(A number with up to 10 digits to the left of the decimal point and 2 
digits to the right of the decimal point. Please do not use commas.)
paper-size:
(Please select a value from th Valid Values tab.)

Product codes
A product code—UPC (Universal Product Code), EAN 
(European Article Number), JAN (Japanese Article Number), 
or ISBN (International Standard Book Number)—is required to 
sell on Amazon. If your items are unique or you fabricate them 
yourself, you’ll need to buy bar codes, one for each product, 
including variations of the same product, such as color. There 
are many places you can buy barcodes: three of these are 
speedybarcodes.com, www.barcodestalk.com, and www.gs1uk.
org. You can easily find other providers and compare prices 
by doing a Google search.

7.	 As we have emphasized, 
the Amazon storefront 
system doesn’t allow for 
much branding of the 
individual sellers’ storefronts, 
however there are various 
customizations you can 
apply to your account from 
within the Your Info and 
Policies section (down 
toward the bottom of the 
left-hand column on the 
Seller Central page). The 
system allows you to upload 
a logo (sized to 120 pixels 
wide by 30 pixels high) and 
you get the opportunity to 
provide some “about” text 
(as shown in the screenshot). 
You’ll also need to add 
a privacy policy, and you 
may want to provide FAQ, 
custom help pages, and 
other information such as 
gift wrapping, tax policy, 
and shipping options.
Once you’ve input all your 
product details (and if you’re 
using the FBA system, once 
your goods are shipped to 
Amazon’s fulfillment center), 
you’ll be in business, with millions 
of potential customers able to 
access what you’re selling.

Getting help
It’s likely you’ll need guidance during the setup and the early 
days of running your store. Go to Seller Central (sellercentral.
amazon.com) and click the “Getting Started Guide” link; this is 
a very helpful guide that covers what you need to know for the 
setup. When you need more information, you can click the help 
button (indicated in the screenshot) which will take you to 
Amazon’s very thorough help documentation, the Seller Forum 
(sellercentral.amazon.com/forums), or to contact Amazon 
(sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/contact-us/contact-amazon-
form.html), where you can request a telephone callback. 
AMAZON PRODUCT ADS
Taking out ads on Amazon to promote 
your products is one way of getting 
ahead of the competition (which is 
anyone selling the same goods as 
you are). It’s also a way of getting 
your products listed on Amazon, even 
if you haven’t got product codes. See 
Chapter 10 for more details about 
“Pay Per Click” advertising.

GLOBAL SELLING VIA AMAZON
You’re not restricted to selling via 
your local “branch” of Amazon. 
Sellers can set up accounts in the 
U.S., Europe, or Japan. If you sell 
on Amazon.co.uk, you can sell on 
all of the European marketplaces—
Amazon.de, Amazon.fr, Amazon.it, 
and Amazon.es. 
(When you sign up for the European 
Amazon you will find it varies slightly 
in terminology, e.g. “Sell a Little” and 
“Sell a Lot,” instead of the Individual 
and Professional account options.)

C H A P T E R  6
An eBay STOREFRONT
Like selling on Amazon, listing 
your products on eBay makes 
them available to a ready 
audience of millions. Why would 
you set up an eBay store rather 
than simply list your products 
on eBay? 
There are several benefits 
to setting up a store:
> You’ll save on listing fees.
> You’re more likely to attract 
regular customers.
> You can refer potential 
customers to a single web 
address.
> You can customize your eBay 
store so that you can bring 
promotions to buyers’ 
attention.
> You can create individual 
categories that fit the products 
you’re selling.
> You get some great marketing 
tools, including an email list 
manager.
BEFORE YOU SET UP: BE AWARE OF SELLER LIMITATIONS
As a new seller, your account will be limited for the first 90 days; you need to 
build your sales and establish a good reputation for your limits to be increased. 
This means that it may take several months for your store to bring in a large 
revenue. Be aware of this when making your plans as it will prevent you 
growing fast if your eBay store is your only sales outlet.
Sign-up requirements 
You need a “Premier” or “Business” PayPal account to set up 
an eBay store. If you already have a Personal PayPal account, 
it’s simple to upgrade—click “Upgrade Account” from within 
your PayPal admin area. You also need to get your PayPal 
account verified, if it isn’t already. Requirements vary slightly 
from country to country, but verifying your account usually 
involves confirming a bank account. To do this, PayPal will 
transfer a small sum to your bank account with a series of 
numbers as a reference; to verify your account, you have to 
type in these numbers within your PayPal admin area. This can 
be done quickly and easily if you have internet access to your 
bank account.
If you want anything other than a Basic level store (150 listings 
a month) you can’t have a seller performance from previous 
eBay listings that is below standard.
OTHER PAYMENT METHODS YOU CAN USE WITH AN EBAY STORE
Skrill and ProPay are alternative payment methods you can offer to your customers 
from your eBay store, as well as accepting credit cards. You can’t do the latter via 
the system, however—you need to ask your customers to contact you to complete 
the transaction. If it suits you, you can also offer “payment on pickup.”

SETTING UP YOUR EBAY 
STOREFRONT 
1.	 Go to www.ebay.com and 
sign in, if you’re already an 
eBay seller, or register if 
you’re new (the link to do 
this is at the very top left 
of your screen).
2.	 Go to pages.ebay.com/
storefronts/start.html and 
look at the information about 
which package is right 
for you. Clicking the blue 
“Compare Packages” button 
will take you to a table where 
you can read the features of 
each. When you’ve decided 
which package to go for, 
scroll right to the bottom and 
click the green “Subscribe 
now” button. 
3.	 If you’ve just registered for 
a new eBay account, you’ll 
need to confirm your contact 
information by phone or text, 
by typing the PIN number 
given to you into the box.  
You’ll also need to choose 
the payment method with 
which eBay will take payment 
for the charges incurred by 
your sales, and provide 
them with the necessary 
information. When you’ve 
done this, you can go on and 
You can choose from different levels of eBay store subscription, 
depending upon the number of sales you anticipate making.
“Subscribe” for the store 
package you’ve decided on. 
You’ll be giving your store a 
name at this stage; you can 
rename it any time you like, 
but be aware that if you 
rename it, the web address 
will also change, so think 
carefully and decide on a 
permanent name before 
passing on its web address 
to anyone, and don’t change 
it again.

4.	 You’ve now completed the 
sign-up—you’ll be taken to 
a “Congratulations” screen. 
Note the web address of your 
new store; right-click on the 
link, and open it in a new tab.

Your new eBay store will look 
rather drab, so go back to 
the tab in which you have the 
congratulations screen open 
and click on the blue button 
labeled “Start Quick Store 
Setup.” This is a good way 
to get started, although 
you’ll want to make many 
refinements, so scroll down 
to the bottom of the screen 
and click “Apply changes.”
5.	 Having done this, you’ll find 
yourself inside the Manage 
My Store area of My eBay 
(see the screenshot opposite). 
Here you can carry out a 
number of customizations:
i. From the left-hand menu, 
click “Display Settings” 
under Store Design. Here, 
you can change your store 
name, if you want to. You’ll 
need to add a logo and 
change the description 
for your store; click the 
“Change” link to the right.  
Your description needs to 
include essential keywords 
that describe the products 
you sell to enable your 
store to be found by your 
prospective buyers, so 
think about this carefully 
(see Chapter 11 for more info 
about the search engines). 
ii. For your logo, you have 
the option of choosing 
one of eBay’s pre-
designed logos, but if 
you have your own, you’ll 
certainly want to display 
it. It’s important that 
before you do anything, 
you resize the image file 
to 310 x 90 pixels. If you 
don’t, the image you 
upload will be resized 
to fit those dimensions 
and it will look either 
squashed or stretched. 
If you don’t have any 
image-editing software 
you can do this easily 
using Pixlr.com. Having 
resized the image, select 
the button next to 
“Upload a logo to eBay,” 
and use the “Browse” 
and “Upload” buttons to 
upload your resized logo 
to your store. You have 
the option not to have 
a logo, but if you want to 
make your store look 
attractive, it makes sense 
to show a logo and 
choose a template (the 
next step) that allows 
you to do this (not all of 
them do). When you’re 
done, click the “Save

iii. Now, you’ll want to 
change the “theme” 
(template) of your 
site, unless you’re 
happy with the classic 
blue theme. In the 
Theme and Display 
section underneath 
the Basic Setting 
section, click “Change 
to another theme,” 
select the theme you 
want, and click “Save 
Settings.” You can 
then customize it 
further by changing 
the colors and fonts 
by clicking “Edit 
current theme.” You 
can change further 
elements of the layout 
in the lower part of 
the Theme and Display 
area. For example, 
reorganizing the 
content that appears 
in the navigation area 
and choosing how 
your products will 
be displayed, but 
this you’ll find easier 
when you have some 
content on the site, 
such as items for 
sale, extra pages, 
categories, etc.
Customizing your header area
Your header area is a great place 
to feature bestselling items or 
links to other pages of your store. 
Click the “Change” button next 
to “Store header display” (under 
Theme and Display in Display 
Settings); click the radio button 
next to “Yes, include additional 
information in the header,” and 
click the link labeled “Stores 
HTML Builder.” The wizard that 
opens allows you to create text 
links or more advanced boxes 
that display images and text.

6.	 The next thing you need 
to do is create some extra 
pages for your site. Pages 
you might want to include are 
an “About” page, an “FAQ” 
page, and a page of special 
offers. Click “Custom Pages” 
from the left-hand navigation, 
then “Create New Page.” 
From the next screen, you 
can choose from the various 
different layouts available 
to you, as shown in the 
screenshot. Click “Continue.” 

Now add the content you 
want to add to the page, 
referring to the HTML tips in 
the box (right) if needed, and 
putting the content into the 
boxes as required. Choose if 
you want the page to have 
a navigation bar or not, and 
click “Continue.” If the page 
is as you want it, scroll right 
down to the bottom of the 
page and click “Save and 
Publish;” if you want to make 
any changes, go back. Note 
that from the Custom Pages 
screen you can change the 
order of the pages in the 
menu, edit, deactivate, or 
delete pages, and choose a 
different page other than the 
main listings page to appear 
as your store’s home page.
Some basic HTML to use with your custom pages
To create a large title, type <h1>, type the title text, and type 
</h1> after it. You can do the same with numbers down to 6, 
with the titles decreasing in size, so <h6>your title</h6> would 
be the smallest title. To create a word or text in bold, type <b>, 
type the text, and type </b>. The same principle follows for 
italic text, by typing <i> and </i> before and after the text in 
question. Type <center> and </center> to center text. To create 
a line break, type <br> where you want the break. To type text 
in paragraphs (i.e. with a blank line between paragraphs), type 
<p> at the beginning of each paragraph, and </p> at the end. 
To create a bulleted list, type <ul> and then <li> before each 
bullet item and </li> at the end of each bullet item, and </ul> 
when you’ve finished the list.
You can refer to: www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp 
if you need any more formatting codes.

7.	 Promotion boxes are a nice 
feature of an eBay store. You 
will have noticed that some 
custom page formats allow 
you to include promotion 
boxes. You can create them 
especially for these pages, 
or design them for different 
locations throughout the 
site—the navigation area, 
the top of each page, etc. To 
create promotion boxes click 
“Promotion Boxes,” from the 
left-hand navigation; you will 
see some already present. 
One of these is a sign-up 
form for your store newsletter, 
the other two are suggestions 
put there by eBay to start 
you off. You’ll need to add 
content to these if you want 
to keep them; you can do 
this by selecting “Edit” from 
the drop-down menu, or you 
can delete them and start 
afresh by clicking the “Create 
New Promotion Box” button.
8.	 The next step is to create 
the categories and 
subcategories into which 
you’re going to organize 
your products—these don’t 
need to correspond to eBay 
categories. Go to Store 
Categories and add your 
categories by using the “Add 
Category” button. You can 
create subcategories in just 
the same way—click on the 
category and then click the 
“Add Category” button.
9.	 The penultimate thing you 
need to do before you add 
your products is to enter 
some keywords for the 
search engines. Click on 
“Search Engine Keywords” 
from the left-hand menu and 
add the keywords you want 
to use for your pages and 
categories. (Chapter 11 
explains search engines and 
keywords in more detail.)
10.	The last thing to do before 
you list your products is to 
connect your PayPal account 
with your eBay store. Go to 
My eBay > Account > PayPal 
account. Click the “Link to 
PayPal” button, log into 
PayPal as prompted, then 
click the “Return to eBay” 
button—your account is 
now linked.
11.	 To list your items, click “Sell” 
in the top navigation bar of 
any page, or by clicking the 
“Start Selling” link toward the 
bottom of your Manage My 
Store page. You can name 
and describe your product 
yourself, or you can type in 
an existing product code 
that will bring up existing 
information of the product. 
Fill in the details and add 
images as required; choose 
whether you’re selling the 
product as an auction item 
or at a fixed price; and add 
shipping and payment details. 
Click the blue “Continue” 
button when you’re done. 
Preview how the item looks 
and click “List your item.” 
Once you have your store 
set up, all your items listed 
on eBay will show up in your 
store, and you can display 
them in the gallery view or 
list view format, ordered as 
you choose: “Ending First,” 
“Newly Listed,” etc.
Now that you have your 
products listed, your eBay 
store is in business!
EBAY SELLER RULES
Make sure you’re familiar with eBay’s 
rules before you start listing your 
items. It’s also worth reading up on 
best practices in case of any problem 
with a sale: pages.ebay.com/help/
policies/seller-rules-overview.html

There are multiple tools provided by eBay 
to help you manage your eBay business. If 
you go to My eBay you will be taken to your 
Selling Manager screen where you can see 
your listings, orders, and other information 
all in one place (you can also access this 
area from inside your Store Manager). 
From here, you can download sales history 
reports from the File Management Center 
(in the left-hand navigation), print invoices 
and shipping labels, and if you plan to sell a 
large number of items from your store, sign 
MANAGING YOUR EBAY STORE
up for Turbo Lister, which allows you to 
upload product information to your store 
in bulk.
From your Store Manager page you can 
sign up for traffic reports with a system 
called Omniture, which also allows you to 
see which keywords your buyers have found 
you with, and sign up to access detailed 
sales reports (subscribe to both these 
facilities from the bottom of the Store 
Manager home page).
The Selling Manager will be the center of your store management once your store is up and running.

You can access all kinds of marketing 
tools from within your Store Manager, such as 
promotional flyers to print out, cross-promotion 
tools, “Top Picks” selections, setting up an RSS 
feed, creating a listing frame, and the inclusion of 
“similar items” on customer emails and product 
pages. A great feature offered by an eBay store 
is a built-in mailing list system, allowing you to 
contact your email list subscribers with images 
Promoting your eBay store
of your latest products, items on sale, and so on. 
This is a highly effective way of staying in touch 
with your prospective customers and one that 
eBay makes very easy for you to implement. 
Additionally, inside the Promote Your Store area 
of the eBay Stores Overview (see the link in the 
“Getting help” box) you can generate blog 
widgets and download templates for business 
cards, letterheads, and more.
With an eBay 
storefront you 
are provided with 
a multitude of 
marketing tools, 
including an email 
mailing list system.

In focus: webstores
A WEBSTORE IS TRULY YOUR OWN ONLINE SPACE. 
YOU CAN PRESENT YOUR ONLINE BUSINESS AS 
YOU WANT TO, YET THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES 
STRUCTURE IS ALREADY IN PLACE.
Wix is a wonderful solution, ideal for 
small-scale entrepreneurs. The ready-made 
designs are great, the interface is very easy 
to work with, and it’s cheap. It won’t be your 
webstore of choice if you’re planning to 
grow your business in a big way, since the 
system lacks some of the more sophisticated 
features, such as sales reports. But for many, 
you won’t need to look any further, and you 
can be up and running with a stunning-
looking webstore both quickly and easily.
A Wix WEBSTORE

Wix offers a wide variety of styles so there’s something for everyone. The templates are really easy to edit, as well.

SETTING UP YOUR WIX 
WEBSTORE
1.	 Click “Templates” on Wix’s 
home page at www.wix.com. 
Choose the template you 
want to use from the Online 
Shop category (clicking on 
“View” brings up a demo of 
each). You can play around 
with the different templates 
by clicking “Edit” and signing 
up for an account; you don’t 
have to commit to anything 
at this stage. This is great 
because you’re able to see 
what changes you can make 
to a template before you 
decide on it—but beware: 
when you do choose a 
template, you won’t be able 
to change it, so make sure 
you’ve chosen well.
2.	 When you’ve chosen your 
template, if you haven’t 
already clicked the “Edit” 
button in order to fiddle 
around with the site, do 
so now, and from the top 
navigation, click “Upgrade.”
TIP
A unique design
If you want to create something 
unique, you can choose from 
a selection of blank layout 
templates and create the 
design yourself from scratch.

3.	 Name your site and save it. 
You need to do this, even if 
you haven’t done anything 
yet, in order to upgrade. (It’s 
not worth spending a lot of 
time thinking about the name 
you give your site as you’ll be 
adding your own domain, so 
you won’t be using the web 
address given to you by Wix.)
4.	 Upgrade to either the 
monthly or yearly 
e-commerce package.
5.	 Depending on your choice 
of monthly or yearly payment, 
your domain name may or 
may not be included in the 
price. If you’ve chosen to 
pay monthly, the final 
“Congratulations” screen will 
offer you the possibility of 
purchasing your domain at 
this point—type the domain 
name you want into the box 
and click “Search” (as shown).
6.	 If you’ve chosen to pay for 
the year, the price of your 
domain will be subtracted 
from your payment. To claim 
your free domain go to My 
Account and click “Domains” 
from the Manage Premium 
menu. (You can do this at 
any stage, but your right to 
claim a free domain will only 
last for a year.)
You can change your site name later or 
Connect your own personal domain i.e. (www.mydomain,com)
Don’t worry, your site is still private and will only be shown to the 
world when you publish it.

When registering your 
domain, you may be offered 
the option of a “Public” or 
“Private” registration. You 
can choose the private option 
if you don’t want your name, 
address, and telephone 
number to be accessible to 
someone researching the 
owner of the domain name, 
but you have to pay for the 
privacy option.
Note that Wix can only register .com, .co.uk, .org, .net, .info, 
and .biz extensions, so if you want a country-specific domain 
name such as .fr, or any other type of domain name, you’ll 
need to register it independently with a registrar such as 
Gandi or Godaddy (see page 30) and point the nameservers 
to your Wix store. This is very easy to do, and there are 
very clear instructions for different registrars inside the 
Wix Learning Center. Click “Support” (at the top right of 
your Site Manager page) > Domains & Email > Setting Up 
a Domain from Other Hosts (i.e. Networksolutions, Godaddy, 
etc.). You need to log into your registrar and edit the 
nameservers to “NS1.WIX.COM” and “NS2.WIX.COM,” 
as per the precise instructions in the Learning Center.
SSL AND WIX
It is not necessary to use an SSL (secure sockets layer, see page 33) to 
make sales from your Wix site. Many consumers are reassured when they 
see https:// in the address of a site, however, at present it is not possible 
to add your own SSL to a Wix site.
7.	 If you did not buy your 
domain directly from the 
“Congratulations” screen, 
you will need to connect 
your domain to your new 
website. To do this, go to My 
Domains and click “Manage” 
next to your domain name. 
Under Domain Summary, 
click “Change,” and under 
Point Your Wix Site, choose 
your Wix site, click “Save,” 
then “Done.”
Customizing your webstore
To customize your site, go back 
to My Account > Manage & Edit 
Site > Edit Site. The page editing 
interface has been designed to 
be extremely easy to use. Here 
is a brief guide as to what can 
be done with which tool.
1.	 Select the page to be edited 
from this drop-down.
2.	 Here is where you create new 
pages and arrange how they 
appear in the menu. You also 
access the search engine 
settings for each page from 
this area.
3.	 Change the background, 
colors, and fonts from here.
4.	 Add text, images, and other 
elements from here. Wix has 
a built-in image editor with 
dozens of effects you can 
apply: choose from frames, 
shadows, and different 
lighting effects. You can 
upload your own images or 
choose from a built-in image 
library, and display them as 
galleries or sliders with a 
multitude of different styles 
on offer. You can also add 
video, audio, boxes, dividing 
lines, social media icons, list 
layout elements (labeled “List 
Builder”), apps such as

Google Maps, contact forms, 
a members’ login, and PayPal 
buttons, navigation bars, a 
blog, and of course, your 
online shop. It’s also here 
that you can add an HTML 
snippet if you ever need to, 
for example, if you want to 
paste in a MailChimp signup 
box (see Chapter 13).
5.	 This is the settings area, 
where you add information 
such as your contact details, 
your mobile settings, your 
social media settings, and 
site-wide search engine 
settings, as well as accessing 
your site stats, which you 
can connect with Google 
Analytics (see page 137).
6.	 This is the Wix Apps Market, 
where you can add third-
party components to further 
juice up your site, such as 
Flickr galleries, an Instagram 
stream, or a Facebook 
comment box.
7.	 These buttons undo and 
redo your latest moves, 
so you can quickly undo 
choices you don’t like, 
without having to go back 
into your site history.
8.	 Copy and paste buttons.
9.	 Gridlines will allow you to 
align elements more easily.
10.	Snap to grid button. When 
this is selected, items you 
move around will easily 
align with others.
Select any element to edit, move, or delete it.
11.	 Adds rulers to the sides of 
your editing area. Clicking 
the rulers at the top or side 
will add more vertical or 
horizontal gridlines where 
you choose to put them 
to help you align items.
12.	The preview button—use 
this to see how your live 
site will look.
13.	Save your changes.
14.	Publish your site.

How to add your logo
One of the first things you’ll 
probably want to do is add your 
own logo to replace the heading 
supplied with your template. 
Using this template as an 
example, here’s how to do it. 
1.	 First you need to delete 
the words “Gift Shop” (or 
whatever words you have at 
the top of your template), so 
click on the text and then the 
dustbin in the box of options 
that comes up (as shown).
2.	 Next, click on the “+” button 
on the left, and click “Image,” 
then “Image without Frame.” 
3.	 An image will appear on your 
page, so click on it, and select 
“Change Image” from the 
small window that pops up.
4.	 Now click the orange “Upload 
Images” button in the large 
window that appears (as 
shown). Navigate to the 
image on your computer 
and select it. Back in the 
uploading window, click 
on your image when it has 
uploaded, and then click the 
blue “Change Image” button 
at the bottom right of the 
window. Note that you will 
need to use a version of your 
logo with a transparent 
background, unless its 
background matches exactly 
with the background color of

the area of your site in which 
you want it to appear. You 
may also need to resize it for 
your site—it’s easy to do this 
if necessary using Pixlr.com 
(see page 42).
5.	 You now have your logo 
on the site but it will be the 
wrong size on the page—you 
want it to be exactly the 
same size as the image file 
you uploaded so that it does 
not appear distorted. Double-
click on the logo as it is on 
the page, and the large 
window opens again. Mouse 
over the magnifying glass at 
the bottom left of the logo 
image and you can see the 
size of the image file—here 
it’s 333 x 37 pixels. Click the 
“x” at the top right of the 
window to close it.
6.	 Now click once on the 
oversized logo and choose 
“Settings” from the small 
window that appears. Add 
the correct pixel sizes in the 
boxes in the Image Settings 
pane (as shown), hit “Enter,” 
and the logo will resize.
7.	 Once your logo is resized,  
just move it to the right 
place. Note that it’s a good 
idea to keep a descriptive 
subheading written in text 
beneath your logo, because 
the search engines will be 
able to read it.

ADDING YOUR PRODUCTS 
AND MANAGING YOUR 
ORDERS
Just like the rest of the interface, 
the online shop is very easy to 
work with.  
To add the store to your site, 
you need to add a product 
gallery from the Online Store 
section of the “+” menu, from 
which your customers can 
choose the items they want to 
purchase. In order to allow them 
to make their purchases, you 
need to create a page for the 
Shopping Cart, also in the 
Online Store section. If you’ve 
chosen an e-commerce 
template, your site will already 
be set up with these, together 
with a “View Cart” button, which 
shows the number of items in 
the cart and allows customers 
to click on it to access the 
Shopping Cart page, from where 
they check out. “Add to Cart” 
buttons are optional as your 
products will already be listed in 
the product gallery, but you can 
add these in other places. For 
example, if you are profiling a 
product on a page elsewhere on 
the site, it makes sense to add 
an “Add to Cart” button at the 
bottom of the description.
Note that the product gallery 
and the product pages can be 
styled in different ways—bigger 
images, different layouts, frames 
around the images, and many 
other customizations. Click on 
the product gallery to access 
these styling options.
You can access your Store 
Manager in several ways. From 
within the page editing area, by 
clicking “Online Store” from the 
“+” in the left-hand menu of the 
editing screen, then “Product 
Gallery.” You’ll be provided with 
a “Go to Manage Store” link (or 
you can click on the product 
gallery on the page itself and 
then “Manage Store”). Or, from 
your Site Manager page, by 
clicking “Online Store” from the 
left-hand menu (you’ll have to 
scroll down the  page a little 
to see it).
Getting help with Wix
Wix has a very clear and informative Learning Center, complete 
with videos. Click Support at the top right of the main part 
of the site. There’s also a support forum. Clicking the small 
“Contact Us” link in the footer of each page in the main part 
of the site will bring you to a page with a toll-free U.S. number 
and an international number for telephone support.

The Store Manager 
works like this.
1. 	 All your products are listed 
here. To edit one, click on it. 
Products can be reordered 
simply by dragging them.
2. 	Add a new product by 
clicking this button.
3.	 Duplicating a product, then 
editing it, is an easy way to 
create similar product listings.
4. 	Products need to belong to 
collections. Product galleries 
on the site display one 
collection at a time. Products 
can belong to more than one 
collection. To add a new 
collection, click the “Add 
Collection” button.
5.	 You can keep track of your 
orders here.
6.	 Set your currency (just one 
per site) and your payment 
details here. At present, 
PayPal, Authorize.net, Skrill, 
WebMoney, and PagSeguro 
are supported. You also 
choose your weight unit 
here, either in pounds or 
kilos, for shipping purposes.
7.	 Here is where you create 
product coupons to give 
your customers special 
discounts.
8. 	Set your shipping rules here: 
where are you going to ship 
to, are you going to calculate 
shipping by weight or price, 
and are you going to set 
a handling fee?
9.	 Set your tax rules here: is 
tax included in your pricing, 
for which countries is it 
applicable, and what 
percentage is it?
10.	This area brings products to 
your attention that may be 
out of stock, not visible on 
the site, or not classed into 
any collection.
11. 	This link allows you to sign 
up to display your online 
store on Facebook, complete 
with purchase buttons.

The Product Details interface 
works like this. (It is accessed 
by clicking on a product within 
the Store Manager.)
1.	 Product title and the price 
at which it will be sold.
2.	 Choose the collection(s) 
to which the product will 
be added.
3.	 You can add multiple photos 
and videos for each product.
4.	 The “Overview” information 
appears at the top of the 
product page, the “Detail” 
information will appear at 
the bottom.
5.	 You can optionally add text 
that will appear on a strip of 
color on the product image 
in the product gallery.
6.	 If you want a crossed-out 
price to appear next to the 
current price, type it here. 
If you put “0,” nothing will 
show up.
7.	 If you’ve set the system to 
calculate shipping costs 
by weight, you need to add 
the product weight in this 
box (this is set under the 
“Shipping” tab in the 
Store Manager).
8.	 Here is where you can 
manage options, such as 
size and color (two are 
allowed for each product), 
and the quantity of each 
product you have in stock.
9.	 Here is where you can 
temporarily remove an item 
from the gallery, for example, 
if it’s out of stock.

A Shopify WEBSTORE
If you need more sophisticated features 
than Wix can offer you, consider Shopify. 
Shopify’s templates are some of the most 
stunning around, and the easy-to-use 
interface makes it a breeze to set one up. 
The system can also be extended 
with hundreds of apps to increase 
functionality, and you can integrate 
it with various dropshipping and 
fulfillment systems. 
Shopify has the best selection of ready-made webstore templates (“themes”) around, with slick designs to suit every type of site. 
Top: Masonry theme (Chameleon), Limitless theme (Methods); bottom: Radiance theme (Slate), Clean theme (Colour).

SETTING UP YOUR SHOPIFY 
WEBSTORE
1.	 First, sign up for a free 
14-day trial at www.shopify.
com. Input your store name 
(which can be changed 
later), your email address, 
desired password, and click 
“Create your store now.” 
You’ll need to wait while your 
new store is created, then 
click “Take me to my store.”
2.	 Supply your address as 
requested, click the “I’m 
done” button, and proceed 
to your Dashboard. You’ll 
see three steps listed on the 
Dashboard home screen that 
you need to follow for your 
site to be functional. If you 
want to see what your store 
looks like, click on the green 
button labeled “View your 
store” at the top of the screen, 
which will open in a new tab. 
This way you can work in the 
admin area and check your 
changes on the site in a 
separate tab (refreshing your 
browser each time you make 
a change). As you scroll 
down the site, you’ll see 
customization suggestions 
appearing in yellow boxes as 
you mouse over the different 
areas—don’t follow these. It’s 
easier to follow the three-
step setup from the admin 
area, plus you’ll probably 
want to change the theme 
(template), in any case.

3.	 The first thing to do is 
customize your theme. 
You may want to change 
the theme—this you can do 
straight away by clicking the 
“Visit the Theme Store” link. 
Alternatively, you may want 
to play around a little with the 
default theme first, in order 
to familiarize yourself with 
the way Shopify works.

To customize the default 
theme click on “Edit theme.” 
From within this area, you 
can make a huge number of 
customizations. Not only can 
you change colors, fonts, and 
background, and upload a 
logo, you can add a slideshow, 
and choose what content 
appears where on your 
home page. Here, you also 
configure your mailing list 
settings and decide which 
social media buttons you 
want on your product pages. 
(You will need to scroll right 
down the page and open 
each menu item.) 

You’ll see that you can 
also make some choices 
relating to the display of 
your products, but this won’t 
really make sense until you’ve 
added some in the next step, 
so you’ll want to come back 
here when you’ve done that.  
(To come back here, click 
“Themes” from the left-hand 
navigation and then “Theme 
Settings”—don’t click on 
“Template Editor,” as this is 
where you or a developer, 
would make changes to 
the code.)

When you’ve made these 
customizations, saved them, 
and checked how they look 
on your live site, return to 
your Dashboard by clicking 
the “Dashboard” link on the 
left-hand navigation.

If you want to change themes 
at any later stage, click 
“Themes” from the left-hand 
navigation and then “Visit the 
Theme Store” from the top 
right corner of the screen.

Working with images
You can add images to your site either by uploading them from 
your computer or directly from the web. To get an image from 
the web, navigate to the image in question, right-click on the 
image and choose “View image” or “Open image in new tab.” 
Then copy the web address of the image, and paste it into the 
window in Shopify that appears when you click on “add images 
from the web” (the upper arrow in the screenshot). The image 
now resides on your own webstore system.
Shopify also has a useful built-in image editing feature (as 
shown) that allows you to resize, rotate, crop, add text, alter 
colors, etc. To access it, click on the small pencil (the lower 
arrow in the screenshot). Clicking on the “alt” label allows you 
to add keywords that will be visible to a viewer who can’t 
access images on their computer; this is very rare these days, 
but this information has value for the search engines, so do take 
the trouble to type a keyword in here. Images can be reordered 
by dragging them, and deleted by clicking the trash icon.

4.	 Back at the Dashboard, 
which now tells you you’ve 
customized your store, scroll 
down the page to the second 
step and click “Add Products.” 
Now, click the green “Add a 
product” button, as directed.  
Add your product information 
and images, grouping them 
into collections as you 
wish. (You can create new 
collections in the Collections 
area—click “Collections” in 
the left-hand navigation.) 

If you have your product 
details ready, a fast way 
of uploading them is via a 
spreadsheet. Click “Products” 
from the left-hand navigation 
and then the “Import 
Products” button at the 
top right of the screen. 
Download the sample 
spreadsheet, input your 
own product information, 
and upload the completed 
spreadsheet to your store.

Note that you will need to 
choose which products you 
want to appear on the home 
page, and add them to the 
“Frontpage” collection. 

When you’ve added as many 
products as you want to at 
this stage, click “Dashboard.”

6.	 You’re through with the 
three-step quick setup, but 
there are other settings that 
need to be configured. You’ll 
need to set up your tax and 
shipping rates—these you 
access via the “Settings” 
link at the bottom of the 
left-hand navigation. (If you 
need to consult the Help 
area, click “Need help?” from 
the top right of your screen, 
then “Shopify Help Center.”)

There are just 4 steps to take to set up your online store.       Launch your store to start selling
5.	 The third step in the quick 
setup is to configure your 
domain name. If you are 
ready to do this, click the 
“Add a domain” button 
(you’ll have to scroll down 
the page to see it). Click the 
“Buy domain” button at the 
top right of the screen to 
register a new domain name 
via Shopify, or if you already 
have a domain name that 
you want to point to your 
Shopify store, click the “Add 
existing domain” button. 
Type in your domain name, 
click “Add domain,” then “Go 
to instructions,” and follow 
the instructions Shopify gives 
you to point your domain to 
your store for your particular 
domain registrar. It can take 
up to 24 hours for the change 
to take effect, but during this 
time, you can continue to 
work on your store.
Note that if you are going to 
use a dropshipping or order 
fulfillment service, such as 
Fulfillment by Amazon, 
you can configure your 
dropshipping or fulfillment 
settings from within the 
Shipping area. You may 
also want to change the 
currency or the unit system, 
which can be done within 
Settings > General.

7.	 Now you need to set up 
your payment system(s). 
This is done under Settings 
> Checkout. The options you 
have available to you vary 
depending on where you 
are based. North American 
users have the option of 
using Shopify Payments to 
collect credit and debit card 
payments. You can activate 
any of the other payment 
gateways available in your 
country by using the “Choose 
a Credit Card Gateway” drop-
down menu. As discussed 
previously, you may choose 
to launch your store using 
PayPal only and sign up 
for an alternative payment 
system later.

PayPal Express checkout 
is a default payment system 
with Shopify. As soon as 
you receive your first order, 
PayPal will send you an 
email instructing you how 
to complete your PayPal 
Express setup. If you want 
to use a different type of 
PayPal payment system, 
just deactivate the PayPal 
Express Checkout setting. 
Click Edit > Deactivate (it 
can be reactivated later, if 
you want) and choose the 
PayPal system you want 
to use from the “Select a 
Payment Method” drop-
down. Complete the setup 
by following the instructions 
in the pane that opens up 
and completing the fields 
as required. In addition, you 
can choose Cash on Delivery, 
Money Order, or Bank Deposit 
from the “Custom Payment 
Method” drop-down.
SSL AND SHOPIFY
There is no need to purchase a 
separate SSL (secure sockets layer, 
see page 33) as you’ll be using the 
Shopify checkout, which is protected 
by its own SSL. It may add extra 
customer reassurance to see that an 
entire site is protected by https://, 
however adding a custom SSL is not 
an option with Shopify at present.

8.	 When you’ve configured your 
means of collecting payment 
from your webstore, scroll 
further down the page. 
Under the “Customer 
accounts” heading, choose 
whether you wish customers 
to sign up for an account 
with you. The next section, 
“Order Processing” allows 
you to make some choices 
about how checkout and 
payment processing occurs. 
You may need to consult the 
“Help” section here as some 
of the options are a little 
complicated—click the “Learn 
about order processing” link 
to the left.
9.	 Finally in this area, you will 
need to configure the text for 
your Refund, Privacy, and 
Terms of Service statements. 
Clicking the “Generate . . . “ 
buttons to the left populates 
the fields with standard text 
that you may find useful as 
a basis from which to create 
your own. When you’ve done 
this, click the “Save Changes” 
button at the bottom.
10.	You are through with the 
basic setup walkthough, but 
there is other customization 
to be done before your site 
goes live: 
> adding pages to the site 
> attaching these pages to a 
menu for the site 
> adding “link lists” to your site 
(These are mini-menus. You 
can also create drop-down 
menus this way. Create a link 
list with the same name and 
“handle” as the main menu 
item you want it to appear 
under, and it will appear as a 
drop-down menu beneath it.)
> adding blog posts to the site
> editing the emails customers 
will receive when they make a 
purchase, if wanted (Settings > 
Notifications)
> setting up discount codes 
(Discounts area in the admin 
menu)
Congratulations! Your webstore 
is now live. Enjoy using Shopify!

Getting help with Shopify
The support available from Shopify is 
excellent. Click the “Need help?” link at the

A Bigcommerce WEBSTORE
Bigcommerce is a full-featured 
system that offers multiple 
“bells and whistles” right out 
of the box. The designs have 
a different look and feel to 
Shopify’s, so it’s really a matter 
of listing your needs, comparing 
who can provide what at 
what cost, and then making 
a decision in terms of budget 
All the Bigcommerce templates available from within the interface are free. You can’t make simple changes, 
such as to colors or fonts, without going into the coding, so choose one you are completely happy with if you 
don’t want to have to call on a programmer. Top: Clean-Harmony, Bride to Be; middle: Health and Beauty, 
Classic Hip; bottom: München, Beautification.
and appearance. Note that the 
templates are not customizable 
without going into the coding.

The Quick Start Wizard guides 
you through the setup. At any 
point in the setup you can 
return to the Wizard by clicking 
the tab at the top of the screen.
1.	 Step one of the Wizard is 
the basic customization of 
the site. Click “Change your 
design theme and add a 
logo,” then the “Change your 
theme and logo” button. 
Choose your template by 
trying them out—very little 
customization is possible 
without going into the 
coding, so make sure there’s 
a template there you’re really 
happy with just as it is.
2.	 Click on the “Logo” tab and 
either upload your logo, or 
change the title of the 
webstore, if you need to.
3.	 While you’re in this area, 
although you could always 
do this later, you can change 
your mobile settings. It’s a 
good idea to enable your 
shop on tablet devices as 
well as on phones, and 
upload a smaller-sized logo 
to appear on the mobile 
version of the webstore. 
All Bigcommerce stores 
have a mobile version that 
is clear and easy to use, but 
the design is the same for
all themes, meaning your 
branding is restricted 
to the logo.
The Quick Start Wizard helps you get set up quickly and easily.

4.	 While you’re here, customize 
your carousel, if your template 
includes one. Bigcommerce 
lets you add up to five slides 
to the home page carousel. 
Prepare your images in 
advance using Pixlr.com 
or any other image-editing 
software; they need to be 
sized at 980 pixels wide x 
450 pixels high. (These sizes 
work for any of the templates 
that use a carousel—the 
system will resize them 
as necessary to fit the 
template.) Click the large 
rectangular area to browse 
for the prepared images on 
your computer, or simply 
drag them into this area. 
Add headings, smaller text, 
and button text as required; 
you can change the color of 
this text by clicking the small 
squares next to the fields, 
which brings up a color 
picker. You’ll find it easier to 
come back later and add the 
“destination links”—these are 
the web pages you want the 
user to be directed to when 
they click on the images, so 
you’ll need to have some real 
website content in place first. 
(Note that to delete a slider, 
click the small gray “x” top 
right of the thumbnail version 
of the image).
CHOOSING YOUR CURRENCY
Go to Setup & Tools at the top right 
of your screen, and click “Currency” 
to add currencies and choose your 
default. You can either manually 
input an exchange rate, or use the 
Bigcommerce Currency service—if 
you want to use the latter, check the 
radio button and a “Get Rate” button 
will appear. Click it and the exchange 
rate will appear in the box. (You can 
get three-letter currency codes here:

5.	 Now, scroll down a little and 
choose which social media 
buttons you want to appear 
on your site. You can choose 
between the standard icons 
with logos on them, and 
specially designed icons 
that go with the theme. 
Click “Save” when you’ve 
finished making changes 
to this section.
6.	 The “More” tab allows you 
to access “Design Mode,” 
which is a way of letting 
you change text on the site 
easily, and move the content 
panels around.
	
The other elements 
underneath the “More” tab 
allow you to access the 
content of emails that get 
sent out to clients, and gift 
certificates, as well as allowing 
you access to the template 
files so that changes can be 
made to your design and 
layout. You need to know how 
to code to edit these, so you 
probably won’t be going into 
these files yourself, but if you 
ever employ a programmer to 
work on your site, here is 
where these edits can be 
carried out. 
	
Changes you may want 
to make yourself from this 
section would be the header 
images, if your chosen 
template has one—you would 
download it, edit it, and 
upload the new version 
within the Header area—and 
a “favicon,” which is the tiny 
image (16 x 16 pixels) you 
can see to the left of each 
browser page title at the top 
of your screen. It’s worth 
creating one and adding 
it via the Favicon area, 
as it adds to your overall 
professionality and branding.
7.	 Click the “Quick Launch 
Wizard” tab at the top of the 
screen and click the link that 
says “Name your store and 
configure important settings;” 
then the blue button that 
says “Update your store 
settings.”
	
This area—navigate as before, 
moving from tab to tab—is 
where you set your basic 
settings and make other 
more complex decisions 
about the layout and 
functionality of the site, as 
well as configuring social 
media and SEO (see 
Chapters 11 and 12). There 
are numerous features to 
be configured, each with an 
explanation displayed when 
you click on the “i” next to it.

8.	 Go to the Quick Launch tab 
again, click “Next,” and then 
“Add products.”

The Products section 
is where you add your 
products, with their details, 
images, weight, and so on; 
configure options such as 
size and color; set custom 
fields; add SKUs (stock 
keeping units) and product 
codes; activate Google 
Shopping (see page 164); 
specify shipping costs; add 
keywords and descriptions 
for SEO; and so on. If you 
have a large number of 
products, these can be 
imported via a CSV file. 
Go to Products > Import 
Products from the main 
menu.

When you’ve added your 
products, it’s easy to manage 
them from the View Products 
screen (Products > View 
Products). You can see stock 
levels, prices, and codes at a 
glance, select which products 
are displayed as “Featured,” 
and, using the links across 
the top of the table, see which 
ones offer free shipping, 
which ones are out of stock, 
which ones are “hidden” on 
the site, etc. Once you’ve 
linked the system with your 
eBay account, you can even 
list the products on eBay 
from this screen.

9.	 When you’ve finished adding 
products for now, go to the 
Quick Launch tab and click 
the “Next” button. Click 
“Accept online payments” 
and then “Setup payment 
methods.” Once you’ve 
chosen your payment 
systems, you’ll see them 
appear as tabs. Click on the 
tabs and configure each one 
individually. When you’ve 
finished, click “Save.” 

Note that the recommended 
PayPal system for use with 
Bigcommerce is PayPal 
Express Checkout. You can 
also use PayPal Website 
Payments (Standard) by 
selecting it from the “More 
payment methods” box—
you’ll need to do this if for 
the time being PayPal is your 
only means of accepting 
payment.
10. Go back to the Quick Launch 
tab and configure your 
shipping and tax settings—
if you need help, see the 
box below.
11.	 Click on the Quick Launch 
tab one more time and click 
“Next”—you’ve now finished 
the basic setup. You can 
click the orange button and 
launch your store. If you’ve 
successfully completed all 
the steps, your store is now 
open and you’ll see a large 
“Open” sign appear. 

Of course, there is more 
customization that you’ll 
want to do. For example, 
you’ll want to add some 
more pages to your site.
Getting help with shipping and tax settings
There are articles to help with both these in the Bigcommerce 
knowledge base. Click “Help” at the top right of your admin 
screen, then “Getting Started” underneath “Browse by 
Category;” you’ll see articles here labeled “How do I set 
up shipping zones and methods?” and “How do I set up 
my tax settings?”

Adding pages to your site
You’ll certainly want to add 
pages to your site: Terms & 
Conditions, FAQ, About Us, 
etc. Here’s how to do it.
1.	 Go to Web Content > Create 
a Web Page.
2.	 Click the radio button next 
to “This Page Will Contain 
content created using the 
WYSIWYG editor below.”
3.	 Type your page title in the 
field labeled “Page Name;” 
no need to write anything in 
the “Page URL” field as this 
will be filled in automatically. 
Type whatever content you 
like into the “Page Content” 
field. You can also add 
images or videos by using 
the buttons indicated in 
the screenshot.

Supposing you wanted to 
write a different, perhaps 
more succinct version for 
people browsing your website 
on a smartphone or tablet; 
you’d check the checkbox 
next to “Mobile Version” and 
fill in your alternative text in

4.	 Scroll down beneath the 
text editing fields, and 
deselect the checkbox next 
to “Navigation Menu” if you 
don’t want the new page 
to appear in the menu bar. 
(Bear in mind that if you 
choose not to include it in 
the menu bar, you’ll have 
to link to it from the text of 
another page, in order for 
people to be able to access 
it.) If you like, or if you have 
too many extra items you 
want to include in the menu 
bar—it shouldn’t wrap to 
two lines, as it will look 
very messy and spoil your 
layout—you can group the 
elements into drop-down 
menus by indicating a 
“Parent Page” in the menu.
5.	 Scroll down and fill in your 
SEO information (as per 
Chapter 11).

If you want the new page to 
display as the home page for 
your site, you can check the 
checkbox next to “Display 
as Home Page.” It’s most 
unlikely you’ll want to do this, 
as the home page, the first 
page your visitors will see, 
with its carousel and featured 
products, is designed to be 
the most attractive page 
on the site. However, in the 
case of the need for an 
announcement on the front 
page, I can see this being 
useful on occasion. Another 
option you have is to make 
this page only accessible to 
customers once they have 
logged in.

Finally, at the bottom of 
the page you’ll see that 
you can type a number 
into the “Sort Order” field 
to determine this page’s 
position in the menu. You’ll 
find it’s actually easier to 
order your pages from the 
View Pages screen, using 
your mouse to drag the 
pages into the required 
positions; you can also 
remove pages from the 
menu directly from here 
by clicking the tick or 
the cross, as shown. (I 
decided that the link to 
“RSS Syndication” wasn’t 
relevant in the main menu).
Ordering categories
You’ll notice that your categories 
automatically appear in the main 
menu of your store. You can 
re-order these easily from the 
Products > Product Categories 
screen. It makes sense to group 
your categories as well, to keep 
your menu tidy and your products 
organized in a sensible way for 
your customers. You can group 
categories in the same way as 
pages by choosing a “Parent” 
on the individual category page.

Extending the functionality of Bigcommerce
Bigcommerce comes with plenty of features, but it also allows 
you to integrate with an increasing number of third-party 
services to which you can subscribe on a monthly basis. To 
explore the apps available, either click on “Apps” from within 
your admin area (at the top right), or go to www.bigcommerce.

the Analytics drop-down.
Creating forms on your site
You can create a page with a 
contact form in the same way 
as you created an ordinary 
page. When creating the page, 
select the radio button next to 
“Allow people to send questions/
comments via a contact form,” 
and underneath the text field, 
choose which fields you’d like to 
include in the form. As well as 
a page with a contact form, you 
may want to create a page with 
a form you can use for returns—
there’s an “RMA Number” (Return 
Merchandise Authorization) field 
especially for this purpose.
Creating news items
There may not be a proper blog 
feature on Bigcommerce, but you 
can still add news items which 
will appear in the footer area of 
your store. Create your news items 
at Web Content > Add a News 
Item. Just the first few lines of 
the article you create will appear 
in your footer and readers can 
click on it to read more—you can 
therefore make it as long as you 
like, and add images or videos, 
if you want.

Getting help with 
Bigcommerce 
To access the support area, 
click “Help” at the top right of 
the admin screen. From this 
area you can access Live Chat, 
phone for support, or send a 
support ticket. There is also a 
knowledge base, a forum, and 
a series of videos; in addition, 
Bigcommerce runs “webinars” 
you can sign up for if you 
have questions you want to 
ask, or watch pre-recorded 
webinars on topics such as 
content marketing, website 
conversion, and Search 
Engine Optimization.
E-commerce webinars from 
Bigcommerce are a fount of 
information on online business 
in general, as well as on the 
system itself.
DOMAINS AND SSL 
When you’re ready to add your own domain to your webstore, you can either purchase 
one through Bigcommerce, or you can link up a domain you’ve already registered with 
a different registrar. Go to Setup & Tools from the top right of your admin area, and 
click either “Buy a new domain name” or “Use an existing domain name.” Follow the 
instructions. If you have a domain registered elsewhere, you will need to log in and 
change the nameservers to “ns1.bigcommerce.com” and “ns2.bigcommerce.com.” 
(If you need help with this, go to the support area and search “nameservers” for more 
specific instructions.)
You do not need to purchase an SSL to start selling on Bigcommerce, as your 
checkout will be protected by a shared SSL. If you want to purchase a custom SSL, 
or use one you already have, you have that option. Go to “Setup & Tools” and click 
on “SSL certificate.”
Connecting a blog to your 
Bigcommerce store
As mentioned, there’s no integral 
blog with Bigcommerce, but 
you can connect an external 
blog (e.g. on WordPress.com 
or Blogger) to the menu so your 
visitors can access it directly. Go 
to Web Content > Create a Web 
Page and select “Link to another 
website or document.” Type the 
link title as you’d like it to appear in 
the menu (e.g.“Blog”), paste in the 
web address of your blog, and click 
“Save & Exit.” Alternatively, you 
can map your blog to a subdomain 
of your store domain. It will look 
something like blog.yourdomain.
com. For instructions on how to 
do this, go to the knowledge base 
and search “subdomain blog,” 
and you’ll find links to articles 
explaining how to do this with 
both WordPress and Blogger.

A Volusion WEBSTORE
Volusion is an extremely 
full-featured, professional online 
store system that offers pretty 
much all the functionality you 
could ever imagine needing for 
your webstore. 
Two factors set it apart from 
the other systems we look at 
in this book. Firstly, it isn’t 
designed to be particularly 
intuitive to work with; you’ll find 
you do have to edit some code 
through the admin interface in 
order to customize it with your 
own content. It is certainly 
possible for someone to set 
it up without knowing how to 
code, however, otherwise we 
wouldn’t be including it in this 
book. This is thanks to Volusion’s 
documentation which is very 
thorough, complete with videos 
and useful “help” links from each 
page. If you sign up for the free 
trial, which allows you to access 
all the features of the highest 
level package (except the 
Customer Relationship Manage-
ment center), you will be able 
to see whether this is a system 
that you want to work with. Also 
note that the templates come 
with enough ready-made 
content that you can simply 
adjust, rather than build your 
pages entirely from scratch.
Secondly, while you should be 
able to get your webstore in 
place over the course of a 
weekend, you won’t actually be 
able to go live with it so soon. 
This is because in order to take 
transactions from your site, you 
need to purchase an SSL (see 
page 33), which Volusion will 
install for you. This is a process 
that can take 7–10 days, so if you 
need to be able to take payment 
sooner than this time, Volusion 
won’t be the system for you.

SETTING UP YOUR VOLUSION 
WEBSTORE
1.	 Go to www.volusion.com and 
click the “Try it Free” button 
at the top right.
2.	 Fill in your information and 
click “Start my Trial.”
3.	 Wait a little while your 
trial site is built. When it’s 
finished, you’ll find yourself 
at an attractive-looking 
storefront, which uses one 
of Volusion’s basic templates. 
Note that the store is already 
set up with dummy 
information and products.

The Quick Start tab at the 
bottom allows you to switch 
to other free templates, add 
your logo, and add some 
products quickly and easily, 
which gives you a good idea 
of how it is going to look. 
If you want to purchase a 
premium template, click the 
link to the Template Gallery 
that you’ll see when looking 
though the free templates 
inside the Quick Start tab (or 
select the “Website Design” 
menu item underneath “Edit” 
in the top navigation) and 
add your premium template 
to your site.
WHEN CHOOSING A TEMPLATE . . .
Be aware that these templates are not designed to be customizable from the admin 
area. As with Bigcommerce, to make “simple” changes, such as to fonts or colors, 
you’ll either have to go into the code of the template, or get someone else to.

Changing elements on the site, changing text on pages, 
and adding pages
Volusion has an “on-page editing” feature which makes editing 
content that already exists relatively easy. Click “Edit” from the 
top navigation and check “Enable on-page editing.” You’ll now 
find that when you mouse over the different elements of the 
site, a blue box and an “Edit” button appear, as you can see in 
the screenshot below.
Despite it being easy to access the changeable elements, it isn’t 
always that obvious how to proceed from clicking the “Edit” 
button. We’ll run through some of the elements you’ll certainly 
want to change and see exactly how it can be done. (These 
kinds of customizations are likely to be similar, regardless of 
which template you choose for your store.)
First off, let’s change the 
image on the front page.
1.	 First, you need to resize 
the image you want to put 
on the home page, outside 
the system. If you upload 
a picture with different 
dimensions, it won’t fit into 
the layout. You can use any 
image editing software to do 
this, or Pixlr.com. The easiest 
way to see the size of the 
existing image is to open it 
in a new browser window—in 
Firefox, for example, you can 
see the dimensions of the 
image written at the top 
of the screen, as shown.

4.	 In the editing window, click

Now let’s see how you can 
change the text at the bottom 
of the pages. Even if you want 
to keep the links to most of the 
pages which have been created 
for you, you’ll certainly want to 
add your own “About Us” text 
and change the customer 
support number.
1.	 Click the “Edit” button that 
appears at the top right of 
the “About Us” text when 
you mouse over it.
2.	 Now, edit the text in the box 
that comes up. Here, you can 
see HTML code, but you 
don’t have to touch it. As a 
simple rule, don’t ever touch 
anything in these editing 
boxes that’s in purple, and be 
extremely careful when you 
have to change something 
that’s in red. You’ll usually 
be making changes to code 
that’s written in black, as it’s 
the black part that shows up 
as text on the page. So, in 
this instance, remove the 
black text that’s indicated, 
and type in something of 
your own. When you’re done, 
click “Apply.” Allow the page 
to refresh, and you’ll see your 
own text appearing on 
your home page.
3.	 Now, you’ll want to change 
the customer support 
number. Click on the “Edit” 
button that appears when 
you mouse over that area. 
4.	 Just as before, alter the 
black text as necessary. 
(Don’t be alarmed that you 
can see more code in this 
window than you did for the 
last change we made—you’re 
only going to change what’s 
written in black.) Click “Apply” 
as before, and allow the page 
to refresh before checking 
the change you’ve made.

To edit a page that’s already 
been created for you, for 
example the “Terms & 
Conditions:” 
1.	 Navigate to that page on the 
site and with on-page editing 
active, click the “Edit” button 
at the top right. 
2.	 A window will open, as 
before, but when you’re 
editing an entire page rather 
than just a small element, 
you’ll have the option of 
accessing an HTML editor to 
make the formatting easier. 
So, click the button that says 
“Easy Editor,” as shown in 
the screenshot.
3. 	Now, edit the text as you 
need to within the HTML 
editor, using the two rows of 
buttons to help you with the 
formatting, and when you’re 
done, click the “Copy HTML 
to parent window” button.
4.	 Click “Apply,” then “OK.” This 
editing window only allows 
you to change the body text 
of the page. If you need to 
change the title, click “Edit 
article details” seen toward 
the bottom right of the 
screenshot. Edit the title 
and “caption” (subtitle) 
from there, clicking the 
orange “Save” button when 
you’re finished. Having done 
this, don’t forget to return 
to the storefront editor and 
save your changes to the 
body text.

more complex as you’ll have to 
create the page from scratch.
1.	 Go to Dashboard > Design > 
Site Content.
2.	 Click the “View List” button

scroll right to see it), and 
from the next screen, click

3.	 Complete the “Article Title” 
and (optionally) the “Article 
Caption” (subtitle) fields. 
Next to the large “Article 
Body” area, click the “HTML 
Editor” link, add your text, 
images, etc., formatting it 
as you require using the row 
of buttons. Click the “Copy 
HTML to parent window” to 
insert this content into the 
main page.

part of the web address of 
the page—it will be something 
like “Articles.asp?ID=251” 
(as shown in the screenshot). 
Paste it into a text file to 
keep it safe for a moment.
7.	 Now go to the storefront 
and navigate to the group 
of links you want to add the 
link to the new page to. Here, 
I’m adding it to the group of 
links underneath the heading 
“Company Info,” and I’m 
going to add it to the bottom 
of the list. Click the “Edit” 
button so that the window 
with the code appears.
8.	 Carefully copy the entire last 
line of the code (line 10) and 
paste it in, so that you have 
two identical lines of code, 
as shown.
9.	 Very carefully edit the new 
line you have added, line 11, 
as follows: Replace Config_
FullStoreURLreturns.asp 
with the part of the URL you 
saved in the text file earlier. 
Replace Returns and 
Exchanges with the title 
of the new page, and finally, 
replace Returns &amp; 
Exchanges again with the 
title of the new page.

Your line of code will 
now look something like:
<li><a href=”Articles.
asp?ID=251” title=”New 
Page”>New Page</a></li>
10.	Click the green “Apply” 
button; you will now see 
the link to the new page 
added to the list of links.

Adding your products and 
setting up the store
Clicking Dashboard > Inventory 
> Products will take you to the 
Products area, where you can 
see the sample products 
Volusion has put in for you. 
Clicking “Enable Quick Edit” 
from the Settings drop-down 
(as shown) will enable you to 
edit items from a split screen 
interface (also shown), without 
having to open a separate 
window for each product you 
want to edit. If you can’t see 
anything to edit once you 
enable Quick Edit, drag the 
dark blue bar down with 
your mouse and click on the 
product you want to edit.
From within the Products area, 
you can add product details, 
price, weight, inventory details, 
shipping details, multiple images 
and videos, and unlimited 
options such as size, color, 
etc., as well as keywords, 
meta tags, and descriptions 
for the search engines.
TIP
Deleting sample products
To add your own products, you’ll need to delete the products Volusion has 
put in for you. You can do this by doing a “bulk” delete; click the checkbox 
next to “Delete” at the top of the table, and then click the orange “Save” 
button. However, since the system is complex, it may be helpful to keep 
some of these items to look at how they are set up. To do this, use the 
“Hidden” feature—click on “Edit” under “Hidden” to enable it, then select 
the items you want to hide and click “Save.”

Connecting a blog to your Volusion store
As with Bigcommerce, there is no in-built blog. If you want to feature a 
blog, you’ll have to set one up externally (on WordPress.com or Blogger) 
and create a subdomain (e.g. blog.yourdomain.com) that will point to it. For 
step-by-step instructions, go to: support.volusion.com/article/linking-your-
blog-your-volusion-store. When you’ve created the subdomain, you’ll need 
to create a link to the blog in one of your footer columns—use this code:
<a href=”blog.yourdomain.com” target=”_blank”>Blog</a>
Bookmark your store and 
your admin area
Because your development 
store will have a complicated 
web address, it makes sense to 
bookmark both the live site and 
the admin area so that you can 
find them again easily. If you 
need to log in again and haven’t 
bookmarked the addresses, go 
to www.volusion.com and log in 
(top right), then from your “My 
Volusion” screen, click “Manage 
my store” from the left-hand 
navigation.
Your company details, shipping 
details, and tax rules are set up 
under the Settings navigation 
heading within the Dashboard. 
Here you also set your currency 
details (for international stores, 
Volusion allows you to function 
in more than one currency) 
and you set the exchange rate. 
You also need to specify your 
payment gateway, and choose 
to offer any other payment 
options to your customers such 
as PayPal Express, wire transfer, 
check by mail, etc.

Going live with Volusion
When your store is ready to go live, you’ll need 
to activate it by clicking the orange “Activate 
My Store” button at the top of the screen. At 
this point you’ll need to decide which package 
you want to go with, depending on your 
budget, the features you need, how many 
products you’ll be stocking, and how much 
bandwidth you estimate you’ll need. 
Whichever you choose, you’ll need to connect 
a domain name to your store. If you haven’t 
already purchased a domain name, it may make 
sense to do so through Volusion, so that it is 
already connected to your webstore. (When you 
purchase your domain name through Volusion, 
do so with the same email address that you 
used to sign up for your webstore, that 
way the two purchases will be listed under 
the same account.) If you’ve already registered 
your domain name, you need to point the 
nameservers to Volusion. The required 
nameservers are ns1.volusion.com, ns2.volusion.
com, ns3.volusion.com, and ns4.volusion.com. 
If your registrar requires just two nameservers, 
use 3 and 4.
As mentioned, you also need to purchase an 
SSL (secure sockets layer, see page 33) for 
your site. This can only be done once your 
domain is live. Purchase it from the Services > 
SSL Certificates area of the Volusion home 
page—they will install it for you.
Getting help with Volusion
Volusion is a complex system, so it’s just as well 
the support is good. There’s a Live Chat link on 
your admin dashboard, as well as a contact 
telephone number. The Knowledge Base link 
(under Resources on your dashboard) links to a 
very thorough article database. There’s also a 
series of video guides accessible from the 
dashboard (although at the time of writing the 
links all point to the same place). Volusion also 
has an e-commerce information section at 
onlinebusiness.volusion.com, which although it 
doesn’t directly help with Volusion, makes for 
interesting reading, and a series of webinars 
here: www.volusion.com/webinar.

In focus: WordPress 
WORDPRESS IS A LOW-COST ONLINE STORE 
SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO RETAIN 
COMPLETE CONTROL OF YOUR SITE.
WordPress wasn’t conceived as an online 
store—it began as a blogging tool—but 
it has developed hugely over the last few 
years and is now the most used content 
management system (“CMS”) around—that 
is, a system that allows users to log in and 
create a website without knowing anything 
about programming. It features in this book 
as it is now very often used as an online 
store as well. But why would you choose it 
if it wasn’t really conceived for this purpose? 
The answer is that it is low-cost—you can 
run it on your website for free, and you’re 
not tied into the monthly charges of a 
webstore provider. Of course, there will be 
the costs of your hosting, and your payment 
gateway, and you may choose to use a 
premium theme as well, but these will 
be significantly lower than if you used an 
all-in-one webstore. The downside is that 
you will have to do a bit of technical fiddling 
around to set it up, and it will require quite a 
steep learning curve to get going with it, but 
chances are that if you are on a budget, the 
benefit may well offset this inconvenience.
Quite another reason why you might favor 
WordPress is that you get to keep your 
website entirely in your own hands, and 
you aren’t tied in to a particular webstore 
provider. It is your online business, and in 
An online store with 
WORDPRESS AND WOOCOMMERCE

117
choosing to run it on WordPress, you remain 
completely in control (as well, of course, as 
being in charge of security issues, adhering 
to legal requirements, etc.).
WordPress alone doesn’t have the 
functionality of an online store, so to make 
it work as one, you have to add a plugin
—a piece of code created by an independent 
third-party that isn’t actually a part of 
WordPress. There are several plugins 
that can add e-commerce functionality 
to WordPress, and the one we’re going to 
look at in the walkthough in this chapter 
is WooCommerce. 
There are other excellent e-commerce 
plugins that can be used, WP e-Commerce 
and Jigoshop to name just two, however we 
focus on WooCommerce here, as it’s grown 
massively in popularity recently and has 
some very attractive themes designed 
to go with it.
INSTALLING WORDPRESS
Back in Chapter 2, we talked about 
choosing a web host. You may have chosen 
to go with one of the hosting companies 
suggested, and we’ll look here at how to 
install WordPress on both of these, but if 
you’ve chosen another, you can simply 
follow the install directions on their site.
WooThemes are the makers of 
WooCommerce, and the creators 
of a collection of beautiful 
themes made to work with the 
plugin. There are also many 
independently designed themes 
that go with WooCommerce.

Installing WordPress 
on Dreamhost
1.	 Log into your control panel. 
Toward the top of the 
left-hand navigation, under 
“Toolbox,” click “One-Click 
Installs.” Then click 
“WordPress” (as shown).
2.	 In the window that pops up, 
click the large blue “Custom 
Installation” button.
3.	 Select your domain from 
the drop-down menu and 
click “Install it for me now!” 
(Leave the field to the right 
blank, unless you don’t want 
to install your online store 
directly onto the main 
domain.)
4.	 Check your email, and when 
it arrives, click the link in the 
email underneath “1. Please 
create an admin user at:”
5.	 In the browser window that 
opens up, fill in a “Site Title” 
(this can easily be changed 
later), a password, and your 
email address. Uncheck the 
checkbox next to “Allow 
search engines to index 
this site,” because you don’t 
want your new store to be 
accessible before it is ready. 
Then click “Install WordPress.”
6.	 On the next screen, click 
“Log in” (and log in)—your 
setup is complete.

Installing WordPress 
on Bluehost
1.	 Log into your Bluehost 
control panel and click 
“Install Scripts.”
2.	 Click “WordPress.”
3.	 Click “Start.”
4. Choose your domain from 
the drop-down menu and 
click “Check Domain.”
5.	 Check the checkbox that 
says “Show advanced 
options.” Replace the 
automatically generated 
password with something 
you can remember more 
easily. Check the checkbox 
next to “I have read the terms 
and conditions of the GPLv2” 
and click “Install Now.”
6. 	When you see that the install 
has completed, scroll down 
a little bit and underneath 
“Step 1,” click the link next to 
“Login URL.” You can simply 
log in with your email address 
and the password you chose. 
You don’t need to bother

all of that from inside the

INSTALLING WOOCOMMERCE 
AND THE MYSTILE THEME
For this walkthrough we’ll 
use the free Mystile theme 
by WooThemes. Note that 
if you choose a theme from 
WooThemes, the setup will be 
very similar, even if the theme 
is different, but if you choose 
a theme designed by another 
theme creator, the installation 
process for WooCommerce will 
be the same, but the theme 
will be customized differently.
1.	 Go to www.woothemes.com/
products/mystile, register for 
a WooThemes account, and 
download the free theme. 
(You will have to pass through 
a shopping cart process, but 
the theme is in fact free; 
once you’ve “ordered,” click 
the “Downloads” tab and 
download the theme. 
You’ll also receive an email 
containing the download link.)
2.	 The theme may have 
been unzipped for you by 
your browser following the 
download. If that’s the case, 
locate the downloaded folder 
named (“mystile”) on your 
computer, right-click on 
it, and select “Compress 
mystile” to zip the file up 
again. (If it has remained 
zipped, you can ignore 
this step.)
Mystile is a free theme designed by WooThemes to run with WooCommerce. 
It’s highly customizable and therefore suitable for all kinds of online store.

3.	 From within the WordPress 
admin area, if you click on 
the title of your new website 
from the dark gray strip at 
the top left (as shown in 
the screenshot; I named 
my demo site “My 
WooCommerce Site”), you 
can toggle backwards and 
forwards between the live 
website and the admin area. 
If you visit the live site, you 
can see that the default 
theme is installed; you 
now need to upload the 
Mystile theme to your 
WordPress installation.

So, from the WordPress 
Dashboard, navigate to 
Appearance > Themes, and 
click the “Add New” button 
at the top of the screen.
4.	 Click “Upload,” as shown 
in the screenshot.
5. 	Click “Browse” and navigate 
to the “mystile.zip” file. 
Select it, and click “Open” or 
“Choose,” then “Install Now.”
6.	 When it has installed, click 
“Activate.”

13.	WooCommerce is now in 
place, but before you start 
setting it up, there are a 
few steps to take.
	
i. Go to Settings > General 
and choose your time zone. 
You can also change the 
site title and tagline 
(subtitle; optional) here as 
well. Save the change by 
clicking the blue button.
	
ii. If you weren’t offered the 
option to tell the search 
engines not to list your site 
during the setup process, 
do it now: go to Settings > 
Reading and check 
“Discourage search 
engines from indexing this 
site.” Save. (You will, of 
course, change this when 
your store is ready.)
	
iii. Go to Settings > Discussion 
and uncheck “Allow people 
to post comments on new 
articles.” This is because 
you won’t want people 
to be able to leave 
comments at the bottom 
of your site pages, which 
you will be setting up 
in due course. However, 
since you will probably 
want people to be able to 
leave comments on your 
blog posts (assuming you 
are planning to incorporate 
a blog), before creating 
your blog posts, you 
will come back here and 
switch the comments 
on again. (This is merely 
a convenience for you, 
as you can turn them on 
and off for each individual 
page or blog post from 
within the editing area of 
each individual page or 
post.) Save the setting.
	
iv. Go to Settings > 
Permalinks and select 
“Post name.” Then scroll 
a little further down and 
choose how you’d like 
your product pages to 
be named. I suggest “Shop 
base with category.” Click 
“Save Changes.” If you 
don’t make these changes, 
WordPress will give you 
clumsy web addresses 
for your pages, products, 
and posts (like www.
yourdomain.com/?p=1). 
If you make the changes, 
your products and pages 
will have addresses that 
incorporate your titles, 
product names, and 
categories, and therefore 
will be useful for the 
search engines.
	
v. Go to Users > Your Profile 
and choose how you would 
like to be named when you 
post to your blog and reply 
to comments—”admin” is 
the default, but it’s very 
unengaging.
CUSTOMIZING THE 
MYSTILE THEME 
We’ll now move on and 
begin a more fun part of the 
store construction, which is 
customizing the theme. Click on 
Mystile > Theme Options. You 
will see that there are a large 
number of options available—
you’ll want to have a good look 
around, but let’s make sure 
you’ve seen the important ones.
1. 	 At General Settings > Quick 
Start, you can change the 
color scheme of the site and 
optionally upload a logo.
2.	 When you click on “Display 
Options,” you can choose to 
enable “breadcrumbs” on 
your site. Breadcrumbs are 
a navigational aid—for 
example “Furniture > Chairs > 
Wooden,” which let your site 
visitors see exactly where 
they are within the store.
3.	 Under Styling Options 
> Background, you can 
choose a background color or 
image for the store, which is a 
great way of giving your site 
instant personality. Note that 
you must go to the Layout 
Options tab and check 
“Enable Boxed Layout” so 
your background shows up.
	
4.	 Go to Styling Options > 
Links, where you can change 
your link and button colors.

5.	 Click on “Typography,” if you 
want to change the fonts of 
the site. Make sure you tick 
the checkbox at the top of 
the screen next to “Enable 
Custom Typography” to allow 
your selection to be visible.
6.	 On the Layout Options 
screen you can choose to 
put a border around your 
site, which will give you the 
option of using a background 
image or color. You can also 
choose whether the store 
sidebar will be on the left or 
the right side.
7.	 Homepage > Featured image 
is where you decide if you 
want to have a large banner 
image on the home page 
(like the one saying 
“Welcome to our store” that 
you can see on the Mystile 
theme screenshot on page 
121). Check the box, and add 
a heading and subheading. 
It’s probably easiest to resize 
the image before you upload 
it using an image editor (or 
Pixlr.com). The system will 
resize it to the right width, 
but you don’t want the image 
to be too high, or it will use 
up too much of the home 
page space. Therefore, resize 
it to a width of 1120 pixels 
with a height of about 360, 
then upload it. Click the “Use 
this image” button within the 
window that opens up.
8.	 The Sidebar, WooCommerce, 
and Blog tabs, underneath the 
Featured Image tab, allow you 
to decide what appears on 
your home page. You’ll need 
to come back here when you 
have products in your store. 
The same applies to the 
“WooCommerce” section just 
underneath this, which you’ll 
also need to come back to.
9.	 The Footer Customization 
tab allows you to decide how 
many widgets (individual 
elements) you’d like across 
the bottom of the site. These 
are generally used for lists 
of bestselling products, 
featured products, etc.—we’ll 
set these up later. You can 
also type in your copyright 
notice and any other 
information, which will 
appear left and right at the 
very bottom of the page.
10.	The Subscribe & Connect 
area allows you to put a 
MailChimp sign-up link at the 
bottom of every blog post, 
together with social media 
badges. (See Chapters 12 
and 13.)

add your email and physical 
address, and, optionally, 
configure a Google Map to

if you also have a physical 
store you want to encourage 
people to come to. 
SETTING UP WOOCOMMERCE
WooCommerce has many 
features that you will want to 
investigate as they will assist with 
the running of your business, but 
here we’ll go through the setup 
as this is more complicated.
1. 	 Go to WooCommerce > 
Settings (from the main 
left-hand navigation). Under 
the General tab, set your 
country, currency, and the 
countries to which you are 
planning to ship goods to. 
You can also choose whether 
you want to allow people to 
make purchases without 
creating an account.
2.	 Under the Products tab, set 
the price display options 
suitable for your currency, 
and choose some display 
options for your products 
such as size and weight—you 
may need these for some 
shipping methods—and 
whether to allow customers 
to rate products.
Where to get e-commerce themes for WordPress
As mentioned, there are dozens of beautiful themes available to 
use with WordPress, whether you’re using WooCommerce or 
another plugin to power your store. Some good places to look 
for themes are:
> WooThemes (www.woothemes.com)—themes by the makers 
of WooCommerce
> ThemeForest (themeforest.net)—a marketplace listing 
thousands of themes created by independent designers
> Creative Market (creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress)—
another marketplace showcasing themes by independent 
designers
> Organic Themes (organicthemes.com)
> ColorLabs (colorlabsproject.com)
> ThemeTrust (themetrust.com)
> Elegant Themes (www.elegantthemes.com)
select the page you’ve just 
created using the drop-down 
next to “Terms Page ID.”
6.	 To make your payments 
PCI-compliant (see chapter 
15) you’ll need to either 
purchase, install, and setup 
a premium extension from 
WooThemes, or sign up for 
Mijireh Checkout, which is 
free to set up and comes 
bundled with WooCommerce. 
(That is, unless you are just 
using the basic PayPal 
system—PayPal Payments 
Standard—for which you will 
not need anything extra). 

To set up Mijireh, click 
“Mijireh Checkout” from the 
row of links toward the top of 
3.	 Under Inventory (click the 
link at the top of the screen, 
underneath the Products tab), 
you’ll probably want to enable 
the built-in stock management 
system and allow customers 
to see stock levels on the site.
4.	 Set up your taxes under the 
Tax tab.
5.	 Go to Pages > Add New from 
the left-hand navigation and 
create a “Terms & Conditions” 
page. (If it’s more convenient, 
you can simply type the title 
at this stage, and come 
back and fill in the actual 
content of the page later.) 
Save this page, then return 
to WooCommerce > Settings. 
Under the Checkout tab,

the Checkout area, then the 
blue “Join for free” button. 
(When you’ve signed up, 
choose the “DIY” option.) 

From the Mijireh dashboard, 
copy the access key and 
paste it into the box back in 
your WordPress admin area, 
not forgetting to select the 
checkbox to enable Mijireh 
Checkout; save the change.  
Now check your email and 
confirm your email address 
by clicking the link in the 
email you’ve received from 
Mijireh. Back at the Mijireh 
dashboard, configure the 
settings with your payment 
processor information and 
then click the green “Go Live” 
button at the bottom right 
of your dashboard. 

If you’re not using a payment 
gateway other than PayPal 
Payments Standard, or you 
just want to accept payment 
via cash, transfer, or check, 
you don’t need any extension 
and you don’t need to sign 
up for Mijireh Checkout. If 
this is the case, simply use 
the links across the top of 
the “Checkout” screen to 
input the details of the 
various payment options 
you’re going to implement.
7.	 Under Shipping, enter details 
of the shipping methods that 
you are going to use (using 
the row of links toward the 
top of the screen).
8.	 You don’t need to change 
anything from within the 
Accounts area, unless you 
specifically want to. Lastly, 
the emails the system sends 
can be optionally customized 
from within the Emails area.

Adding product variations (colors, sizes, etc.)
Select “Variable Product” from the drop-down labeled “Product 
Data.” Under Attributes, click the “Add” button, then name the 
attribute (for example, “Color”), and add the values, separated 
by a “|” (e.g. “Blue|Red”). Check the two checkboxes “Visible 
on the product page” and “Used for variations,” and save the 
product with the “Save attributes” button. Under the Variations 
tab to the left, choose your default and click “Add Variation.” 
Type the prices and the other details you need to add, and 
click “Publish” (or “Update”) to save the product.
FEATURED PRODUCTS
You can select which products you 
want to be “featured” by clicking 
the star next to the product on the 
main Products page. Click “Products” 
from the left-hand column to see 
the list of products. If you don’t need 
to see all the information relating to 
the products, you can remove the 
elements you don’t want within the 
Screen Options area at the top right 
of the screen.
2.	 Now that you’ve set up 
your products, you can 
decide how you’d like them 
displayed on your home 
page. Go back to Mystile > 
Theme Options > Homepage 
> WooCommerce and 
choose how to show 
your product categories, 
recent products, and 
featured products.
3.	 Your home page is now in 
place, but you’ll need to 
add other pages on your 
site. WooCommerce has 
automatically created the 
pages you need for your store 
for you, but you’ll need other 
site pages, such as your 
“About” page, “Frequently 
Asked Questions,” “Contact,” 
etc., and (optionally) add a 
blog as well.

Go to the Pages section of the 
site and delete the Sample Page 
that WordPress has created for 
you. Then click “Add New” to 
start making your pages, just 
as you did for the “Terms & 
Conditions” page. For the blog 
page and the contact page, you 
will need to assign the specific 
layout created by the theme for 
those pages from within the 
Page Attributes pane, as shown 
in the screenshot on page 129. 
(For an ordinary page, you can 
keep the setting at the “Default” 
template.) Note that when you 
create the blog page, you need 
to leave the page empty—this 
page will automatically be filled 
with your blog posts as you 
create them later from the Posts 
area of the admin. Any text 
you type will not show up, 
so you should leave the page 
completely blank. You can 
choose the layout for individual 
pages (sidebar on the right, the 
left, or no sidebar, for example) 
from within the Mystile Custom 
Settings pane at the bottom 
of the page (as also shown on 
page 129); settings made here 
will override the general settings 
within the Theme Options area.
4.	 You now need to specify 
which widgets (individual 
elements) appear in the 
sidebars of the pages on 
your site that contain a 
sidebar, and at the bottom 
of your pages. Go to the 
Appearance > Widgets area, 
where to the right, you’ll 
see some panes labeled 
“Primary,” “Footer 1,” “Footer 
2,” “Footer 3,” and “Footer 4.” 
The panes can be opened by 
clicking on the small triangle 
to the right of each title. 
WordPress has put some 
widgets in for you; you can 
remove the ones you don’t 
want by dragging them to 
the left or clicking “Delete.” 
Simply move the ones you 
want into each pane and 
configure each one as 
necessary before clicking 
“Save.”
JETPACK
Jetpack is a collection of additions 
you can add to a WordPress site, 
including a Facebook faces widget 
that you may want to add to your 
blog. If you want to explore these 
options, activate Jetpack from within 
the Plugins > Installed Plugins 
area. You’ll need to sign up for a 
WordPress.com account to do this, 
but that’s no problem—you don’t 
actually have to use the WordPress.
com system, and you’ll need to 
sign up for it anyway to activate 
Akismet (see step 7). Once Jetpack 
is activated, you’ll see new widgets 
appearing in your Widgets area that 
you can then drag into your sidebar 
or footer.

5. 	Now you need to set up 
menus for your store. At this 
stage the menu on your site 
will look very messy, with lots 
of extra e-commerce pages 
and the pages you’ve added 
appearing in the order you 
created them, but you’ll be 
able to organize them in the 
way you want. The theme 
allows you two menus, 
though you can create 
additional custom menus 
and use the Custom Menu 
widget for your sidebars, if 
you want to. The main menu 
goes in the primary position, 
and you can also create a 
second menu, which will 
appear at the very top of 
the site (ideal for items 
like Terms & Conditions).


Go to Appearance > Menus 
and create two menus by 
clicking the “create a new 
menu” link toward the top of 
the screen. You can call them 
whatever you like, but “Main” 
and “Top” would be obvious. 
Then assign them to the 
correct place in the theme 
either using the checkboxes 
(see the screenshot) or within 
the Manage Locations tab.

Now, in the Pages pane, add 
pages to your menus by 
selecting them and clicking 
“Add to Menu.” For the main 
menu, you don’t need to 
include all the pages that 
WooCommerce has created 
for you. For example, the “My 
Account” page has links to 
the pages where users can 
update their address and 
make other changes, so there 
is no need to add the “Edit 
My Address” or the “Change 
Password” pages to the 
menu as well. You will 
certainly need to add some 
of these items as drop-downs, 
otherwise there will not be 
room for all the items. Do this 
by indenting the sub-menu 
items by dragging them 
slightly to the right with 
your mouse.

6.	 If you’re going to use the 
blog feature on your site, 
you need to add some 
blog posts so there is some 
content there when your 
store launches. As mentioned, 
blog posts are added within 
the Posts area of the admin 
(go to Posts > Add New). If 
you go to Mystile > Theme 
Options > Homepage > Blog, 
you can decide whether you 
want your blog posts to 
show up on the home page, 
and if so, how many posts 
should be displayed.
7.	 The penultimate step is to 
add four plugins to your site. 
Plugins are extras that aren’t 
actually part of WordPress 
but you can add them to
give extra functionality.
	
i.  Go to Plugins > Installed 
Plugins and activate 
Akismet. This is a very 
powerful spam blocker, 
and you’ll need it so that 
you don’t get a torrent of 
comment spam (which 
you will probably receive, 
even if you don’t have a 
blog in action on your 
site). To do this, you’ll need 
to sign up with WordPress.
com, if you didn’t already 
do so, to install Jetpack 
(see the box on page 130). 
For commercial sites 
Akismet is paid-for, but 
believe me, you really will 
need it; you can choose 
how much you want to 
pay per year.
	
ii.  You may also want to sign 
up for Google Analytics in 
order to track your visitors 
(see page 137). If you do 
this, you’ll need to add 
the Google Analytics for 
WordPress plugin. Go to 
Plugins > Add New, search 
for, install, and activate 
Google Analytics for 
WordPress. You’ll need 
a Google account to sign 
up for Google Analytics; 
when you’ve done this, 
add your website address 
as an “account” within 
Google Analytics, and 
copy your tracking ID, 
which will begin with “UA.” 
The easiest way to set it 
up is to manually paste in 
your tracking ID, an option 
you’ll see when you open 
the plugin settings.
	
iii. Add the WordPress SEO 
by Yoast plugin to help 
you prepare your store 
for the search engines 
(searching, installing, and 
activating from Plugins > 
Add New, as above). This 
will allow you to add titles 
and descriptions to your 
pages and your products, 
and ensure that your 
content is correctly 
targeted toward your 
desired keywords (more 
about this in Chapter 11). 
Don’t forget to allow the 
search engines access to 
your site once your store 
is ready! Go to Settings 
> Reading and deselect 
the checkbox next to 
“Discourage search 
engines from indexing 
this site.”
	
iv. Add, and configure, the 
BackupWordPress plugin 
in order to automate 
backups to your site. 
Because you are running 
your online store 
independently, you need 
to be responsible for your 
own backups.
8.	 You’ll want to test your 
store before you go live. 
The easiest way to do so 
is by creating a low-cost 
product and performing the 
purchase yourself. If you’re 
using PayPal, the site offers 
a sandbox facility for 
testing, but it will be more 
straightforward for you to 
carry out your own test 
purchase. When you’ve done 
that successfully, your store 
is ready to go live.

coupons, and manage the status of your orders

Running your online store
CREATING YOUR STORE IS JUST THE 
FIRST STEP; YOUR BUSINESS WILL GROW 
AND YOU’LL NEED TO HAVE SYSTEMS IN 
PLACE TO ENSURE IT ALL RUNS SMOOTHLY. 
It’s all too easy to forget the customer’s 
perspective when you’re creating an online 
store. You may put so much effort into 
creating a beautiful, smoothly functioning 
website that the follow-up somehow 
assumes secondary importance. However, 
while it’s obvious that purchasing from 
your site has to be an easy and pleasant 
experience, for the customer, the emphasis 
is actually on receiving, and enjoying, the 
item they have ordered. 
You may feel that once the order is 
completed and the payment on the way 
to your bank, your part of the work is done—
but in fact, the most important part from the 
customer’s point of view is still to come.
Today, speed is of the essence in fulfilling 
orders. Customers won’t wait even a week 
to receive an object—unless, of course, it’s 
extremely special, custom-made, and comes 
from the other side of the world. People 
expect fast dispatch, sometimes even the 
very day the order has been placed. It’s 
crucial, therefore, that you have your 
fulfillment system well organized.
Most small businesses choose to fulfill their 
orders themselves when they’re starting out. 
This means a lot of packing, printing of labels, 
trips to the post office, and liaison with your 
chosen delivery service, as well as handling all 
Fulfilling YOUR ORDERS

135
returns and exchanges yourself. This has 
its positive side—handling order fulfillment 
yourself saves a lot of money at this crucial 
time, and you get to interact directly with 
your clients, which is both useful for working 
out potential problems and establishing 
answers to frequently asked questions. It also 
reinforces a positive image of your brand, 
as it will be you personally who handles 
enquiries, deals with problems, and so on.
But when it reaches the point where 
fulfillment is eating up time that would 
be better spent creating or sourcing new 
products, or marketing your store, then 
it’s time to outsource. At the most modest 
level, this could mean employing a friend 
part-time to handle dispatch and answer 
customer service emails (though do 
remember people expect a fast response 
these days, certainly within 24 hours). At 
a more sophisticated level, it might mean 
outsourcing to a fulfillment house who 
will handle everything for you, from 
warehousing, order processing, packing, 
gift wrapping, and shipping, to dealing 
with returns and exchanges. You simply 
pass on the orders to the chosen fulfillment 
center; in some cases, your webstore platform 
may offer integration, so the fulfillment 
center receives and can start acting on 
 orders immediately.
If you use a fulfillment center, your customers 
will probably end up having more contact 
with the staff there than with you, so it’s 
essential your chosen company fulfills your 
ideas of efficient, accurate dispatch and 
excellent customer service. The impression 
they give is the impression your customers 
will have of you. A good way to find out if 
their service is up to your expectations is to 
ask for past and current client references and 
check thoroughly how satisfied the other 
webstore owners are. Another area to check 
is if the company has specific experience with 
the type of goods you’re providing, especially 
if they need any kind of special handling or 
assembly. If you are going to be shipping 
internationally, make sure the company is 
familiar with the necessary procedures. 
Choosing a fulfillment house
Choose a fulfillment house based near your 
customers rather than near you—you’ll save 
shipping costs that way. Also make sure they 
can be reached easily if you need to contact 
them about a change in shipping address for 
a particular order, or any other urgent matter.
TIP

C H A P T E R  9
Points to consider when planning the running of your online business:
> Keep the customers informed: notify them when their order has been dispatched, providing 
tracking information when possible (there are apps for some of the webstore systems that can 
do this for you).
> Show what’s in stock on your website, don’t backlog orders—customers will cancel their orders 
if they have to wait, necessitating a refund and creating bad feeling. 
> Keep a steady flow of stock available. If you use a fulfillment service, you should be able to 
monitor stock levels online.
> You need to be competitive with your pricing as prospective customers will usually compare 
prices. If you can’t afford to cut your prices, offer superior customer service and after sales 
support to stand out.
> Always remember that customer service is key to a customer’s loyalty. It’s much easier to get 
repeat orders from customers who already know you than to find new customers, and it’s a lot 
cheaper in terms of marketing.
DROPSHIPPING
Dropshipping means buying products 
individually from a wholesaler who 
ships them to your customers directly 
as orders come in. You only manage 
the selling part, cutting out the need 
to spend large sums on inventory, 
as well as sidestepping the whole 
business of delivery and dispatch. 
There’s a useful article on the 
Shopify site where you can find out 
more about Dropshipping, as well 
as a free guide.
INTEGRATING WITH YOUR 
WEBSTORE SYSTEM
The more sophisticated 
platforms (including WordPress) 
offer their users integrations 
with systems that can automate 
many of the time-consuming 
aspects of running your 
business, or at least, help you 
cut some corners, even if it is as 
simple as printing out postage 
stamps or shipping labels 
directly from your own printer, 
thereby saving you loads of 
time copying and pasting 
and working out rates. Which 
third-party integrations you 
choose depends on where you 
are based and what your needs 
are; there are a vast number 
available—the best advice when 
choosing a webstore system is 
to first work out what you will 
need and then see which can 
best accommodate these needs.
Some of the integrations 
available are:
Stamps.com, USPS, Royal Mail, 
Canada Post, Australia Post, 
FedEx calculators, OrderCup, 
Shipstation (streamlining orders 
and shipping), Ordoro (shipping 
and inventory management), 
AfterShip (order tracking and 
delivery updates), Shipwire, 
Fulfillrite, Webgistix, Whiplash 
(fulfillment), Softcookies 
(QuickBooks), FreshBooks, 
eBridge Connections (different 
accounting packages), and 
Lettuce (all-in-one inventory, 
shipping and accountancy 
package, works with Shopify).

137
TIP
Plan before choosing 
your platform
It pays to think carefully about 
how your business is going to 
be run, even before choosing 
the system you’re going to use 
to create the store. Integrating 
with a fulfillment center could be 
crucial to the smooth processing 
of your orders, especially if you 
see your business growing fast. 
It could even mean you don’t 
have to employ anyone else to 
handle this part of the business. 
Another huge timesaver will be 
integrating with an accountancy 
software such as QuickBooks or 
Peachtree—if you use these, or 
plan to down the line, it makes 
sense to choose a system at the 
outset which will work with your 
chosen software.
Shipwire (www.shipwire.
com) is a large fulfillment 
center with warehouses 
in the U.S., UK, Canada, 
and China, and new ones 
opening soon in Australia, 
Germany, and Brazil. You 
can completely automate 
your delivery via Shipwire 
if you’re using Shopify, 
Bigcommerce, Volusion, 
or WordPress with 
WooCommerce. To work 
with smaller fulfillment 
companies, you will need 
to forward your orders by 
email or input orders into 
an online interface.
Wix, Shopify (shown here), 
Bigcommerce, Volusion, 
and WooCommerce all 
offer a large number of 
add-ons you can use to 
add extra functionality to 
your site and help with 
the management of 
your webstore.
GOOGLE ANALYTICS
Right from the start, you’ll want to 
track the visitors to your store, to see 
where they’re coming from, at what 
times, with which search terms, and 
so on. The best way to track your 
visitors is by using Google Analytics. 
To get set up, go to www.google.
com/analytics and sign up with your 
Google login. Add your webstore URL 
as an “account,” copy the tracking 
code Google provides you with, and 
paste it into your webstore page 
template as per the instructions 
provided by your webstore provider. 
For WordPress, add it via the Google 
Analytics for WordPress plugin.

Marketing
MARKETING IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF YOUR 
WEBSTORE CREATION AND WILL BE AN 
ONGOING PART OF YOUR ONLINE BUSINESS. 
You’ll need to have marketing in mind 
throughout the planning process and the 
construction of your online store, and you’ll 
also need to have a strategy in place for 
once the store has gone live. 
We’ve already talked about your USP—your 
unique selling point—and how the “look” of 
your website, in other words how you brand 
yourself, is essential so that you appeal to 
your customers in the right way. These are 
the first marketing decisions you make for 
your online store. So, in fact, are many other 
aspects of creating your store. How you 
write, for example, reinforces your image; 
whether your tone is formal, or lighter and 
shows humor.
Once your site is launched, it’s your marketing 
strategy that will take it from being a brand 
new, unvisited store to a busy and successful 
store that takes orders around the clock, gets 
talked about, generates plenty of glowing 
product and customer service reviews, and 
brings back repeat customers. So, how can 
you market your store?
Marketing OPTIONS

139
OFFLINE MARKETING 
It’s easy to assume that because 
this is an online store, all your 
marketing should also happen 
online. This is a mistake. You’ll 
actually be able to advertise 
your site far more easily, to more 
people, more quickly, and often 
more cheaply, if you market in 
the real world.
Offline marketing ideas include:
> Being present, or having a stand at shows and fairs. You may 
even be able to take orders from your online store via a tablet. 
These are also great opportunities to collect email addresses 
for your email list—see Chapter 13.
> Direct mailing. You can expect a response rate of about 1% 
(higher than most forms of online marketing) but it does 
require a considerable investment upfront.
> Getting articles written about you. This, of course, could be 
online as well.
> Getting interviewed on the radio. 
> Running print adverts in newspapers and magazines.
> Carrying and distributing postcards or fliers that are attractive, 
clever, or funny, that people may want to send or pin up.
> Encouraging people to recommend you, perhaps with rewards.
> Distributing coupons.
> Including fliers, coupons, and details of promotions in 
packages you dispatch to encourage repeat orders.
> Always carrying business cards and giving them out 
at every opportunity.
Giving a good impression
Every detail of your presentation, 
your packing slips and invoices, 
the packaging you send your 
products out in, conveys an 
impression. It all contributes to 
public perception of your brand.

SEARCH ENGINES
In terms of the online world, 
discovering your online store 
via the search engines is 
perhaps the most obvious way 
of people coming across you. 
As we mentioned before, when 
discussing your USP, if your field 
of interest is a niche topic, you 
stand a very good chance of 
getting traffic to your site from 
the search engines, providing 
there isn’t too much competition. 
Getting the highest possible 
ranking for a site has evolved 
into a complicated pseudo-
science known as “SEO” (Search 
Engine Optimization), and while 
you probably don’t need to 
become an expert in this, you 
do need to understand a certain 
amount about it in order to 
stand any chance at all of 
your site appearing in a good 
position for the relevant 
keywords. This is so important 
that we’ve devoted a whole 
chapter to the subject—see 
Chapter 11.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Using social media—Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and so on—is 
a unique way of interacting with your customers and spreading 
the word about your company and your products. We’ll discuss 
ideas as to how you can make the most of social media in 
Chapter 12. In order to use social media, you need something 
to talk about, apart from simply your products, which is where 
content marketing comes in (see below). 
BLOGGING AND OTHER “CONTENT MARKETING” IDEAS
Content marketing is material that relates to your products, 
or field of interest, that you can put on your website for others 
to read, refer to, and share. One of the best content marketing 
strategies that an online store can implement is blogging. 
Why would you want to have a blog on your online store? 
> It fleshes out the image your customers and potential 
customers have of you (rather like your About page can, 
only even more so). It makes you real, and, hopefully, 
also interesting.
> It engages people in a way that a store can’t, even if the 
store looks beautiful and your wording is fun.
> It establishes you as a leader in your market, the store of  
choice to come to.
> Whatever your USP is, a blog can reinforce it.
> It makes you very difficult to copy, as the personality and 
“flavor” of your store will be unique.
> It makes your site look up-to-the-moment.
> It gives people something interesting to tweet or post on 
Facebook (which they are more likely to do than clicking 
on the social media links underneath your products).
> It’s great for the search engines—blogs contain loads of 
relevant keywords and will act as “link bait” (meaning other 
websites will link to it). The search engines also lap up 
website material that is frequently updated; a major reason 
in itself to start a blog.
Create a schedule and 
stick to it
There’s nothing more dispiriting 
than a blog that isn’t updated—
it creates the worst impression 
imaginable. You don’t need to 
blog every week, but do make 
it regular; if you can’t keep your 
blog up to date, don’t have one.
TIP

141
Blogging is time-consuming 
and will not bring rewards 
immediately, but after a while 
of consistent posting, it will start 
to bring you a steady stream 
of traffic that is interested in 
your products. 
Blogging ideas:
> announcements, such as 
new products
> reviews
> comparison of products
> trends
> how-to articles
> interviews with or “spotlights” 
on the creator or designer 
of your products
> the story behind certain products
> interesting/successful use of your 
products, plus photos, as sent in 
by customers
> customer competitions
> behind the scenes at a product 
photoshoot
> top tens: “ten ways to . . . ”/ “ten 
reasons to . . . ” types of articles
> guest posts (where you invite 
other people to write a post for 
your blog; or someone invites 
you to write on theirs

Looking at inspiring blogs created to accompany online stores, such 
as these ones, will give you plenty of great content ideas. From top left: 
inkandspindle.com, www.shoon.com, www.bonjourmoncoussin.com.

143
You can also create extra “meat” 
for your site in the form of 
additional site content, rather 
than (or as well as) a blog. For 
example, you could flesh out 
your “About” pages into several, 
giving your story, details of the 
people who work for you, and 
any interesting background; in 
short creating a “story” for your 
business. FAQs also provide an 
ideal source of content you can 
add to your site. They can be 
expanded into a series of pages, 
as you can see with the Island 
Creek Oysters website above, 
which includes information on 
what to eat with your oysters, 
oyster care, and how to shuck 
them, and incorporates a 
demonstration video.
Other ideas for content 
marketing are posting videos 
and photos. Product reviews 
and how-to demonstrations 
work brilliantly on YouTube. 
You can then embed them onto 
a site page, as in the oyster 
shucking example above. Post 
photos on Flickr and share them 
with Pinterest and Instagram 
(see Chapter 12).
The Island Creek Oysters 
site develops the story of the 
business, details the process 
behind oyster cultivation, and 
gives oyster care, eating, 
and shucking tips, so that 
the site carries much more 
valuable information than 
merely selling oysters and 
the branded accessories 
that are also on offer. Above: 
islandcreekoysters.com.

PPC (PAY PER CLICK)
You’ll have almost certainly noticed the 
ads that appear at the top and to the right 
when you do a search on Google. This is 
“PPC” (Pay Per Click) advertising, one of the 
quickest methods of getting traffic to your 
store, and it it can be extremely effective.
It works like this: the advertiser chooses 
the keywords for which they want the ad to 
appear and pays according to the number 
of “clickthroughs” the advert receives. Be 
careful as it can quickly get expensive—
keywords with heavy competition can cost 
you. However, you can set your budget per 
day, to make sure you don’t accrue huge 
bills, and with a little experimentation, you’ll 
settle on a balance between the cost of a 
click for a certain keyword and the business 
it generates for you.
As well as being instant, another benefit 
of this type of advertising is that it is very 
flexible. You can run ads on certain days for 
special offers, you can suspend an ad if the 
specific item is out of stock, or you can 
change the details if necessary.
PPC ads can be set up on Google (Google 
Adwords) and Yahoo and Bing (Microsoft 
Adcenter). You can also run ads on 
Facebook, LinkedIn, and Amazon (Amazon 
Product Ads; you don’t need an Amazon 
storefront to participate, as the ads can link 
to an external website). See also the 
“Google Shopping and Comparison 
Shopping Engines” box in Chapter 14, 
page 164.
Google ads are visible at the top and to the right of a Google search listing; the pictures you can see are images 
of products listed with Google Shopping, and the stars are from online reviews. See pages 164–165.

AFFILIATE PROGRAMS
Running an affiliate program 
is a great way of getting others 
to sell your products for you. It 
works like this: you allow other 
people to recommend your 
products, and if someone 
purchases on their recommen-
dation, they get a percentage 
as a reward. Sales are logged 
and percentages are calculated 
automatically. For example, 
if you sell craft products and 
the owner of a craft blog writes 
an article mentioning your 
products, he or she can include 
a special link to your store, and 
from within your system, you’d 
be able to see if a buyer had 
come directly from their 
recommendation and made 
a purchase. You then pay the 
reward monthly, quarterly, 
or however often you agree. 
Some webstore systems 
offer you a built-in affiliate 
marketing system, and for 
others there are affiliate 
program apps you can add.  
PARTNERSHIPS
A partnership isn’t quite the 
same thing but it’s along the 
same lines. You simply strike up 
an agreement with someone in a 
different field from you, but who 
has customers with a similar 
profile. You refer your customers 
to them, and they refer their 
customers to you. This could be 
in the way of a recommendation 
in a newsletter, which they then 
reciprocate, or the inclusion of a 
promotional flyer or a coupon in 
all packages shipped, and so on.
Of course, you have to be 
careful in choosing the 
companies with which you 
partner. You have to be sure 
they reflect your values and that 
they offer the same high levels 
of customer service that you do.
CUSTOMER SERVICE
As we have mentioned, customer 
service is key. If someone enjoys 
dealing with you, they’ll not only 
speak well about you to others, 
but they’ll also be more disposed 
to coming back for more. It’s 
so much easier to cultivate a 
relationship with someone who 
has already agreed to buy your 
products, than try to convert a 
new site visitor into a paying 
customer. So, treasure your 
customers, and make sure your 
after-sales service is superlative. 
We’ll look into some of the ways 
you can encourage your 
customers to come back 
for more in Chapter 14.
If you have a brick-and-
mortar point of sale, 
you’ll want to get a listing on 
Google Places (www.google.com/
local/business/add) and Yahoo 
Local (smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
local-listings/basic-listing).
TIP
EMAIL MARKETING
Social media is one way of keeping yourself in 
people’s minds. Developing an email list of 
people who are interested in your products, 
and past customers, is another way. Sending 
an email newsletter is a great way of keeping 
in touch with people who might otherwise 
have forgotten all about you. We’ll see more

The search engines
GETTING YOUR STORE AND YOUR PRODUCTS 
FOUND IN THE SEARCH ENGINES IS KEY TO 
THE SUCCESS OF YOUR ONLINE BUSINESS. 
IF PEOPLE CAN’T FIND YOUR SITE, THEY 
CAN’T BUY YOUR PRODUCTS.
As we’ve mentioned, Search Engine 
Optimization (SEO)—which means, in brief, 
doing what you can to ensure that your 
website is as visible as it can possibly be 
in the search engines—has evolved into 
a complex “science.” This chapter covers 
the basics of what you need to know. 
If SEO is a major consideration for you, 
in that you need to compete in the search 
engine rankings with competitors selling 
similar products to make or break your 
online business, it will be an ongoing 
process requiring serious analysis and 
planning, and you may need to do more 
specialized reading to equip yourself with 
the necessary knowledge.
There are a few common misconceptions 
concerning SEO that we should do away with 
right away. Firstly, there isn’t any trickery that 
can help you prepare your online store for 
the search engines. In order to rank websites, 
the search engines use a sorting method 
(called an algorithm) that changes frequently 
to make absolutely certain the search engine 
is listing sites as accurately as possible. It’s 
simply your job as a webstore owner to 
prepare your store so that the search engines 
can list it in the right place. There is no longer

the possibility (though this was common 
practice back at the beginning of the web) 
of “stuffing” your site with relevant keywords, 
or packing them into the coding of your site 
to hoodwink the search engines. 
Secondly, you can’t buy a good position in 
the search engines. You can, of course, buy 
The following factors will influence how the 
search engines read your site.
1.	 The wording you have included on your site. 
The search engines read the text of your 
website and analyze its subject matter.
2.	 How often your site is updated. The 
search engines love dynamic, up-to-the-
moment content.
3.	 The size of your site. If it’s a tiny site, it will 
sink below the larger ones in the rankings. 
ads on Google, but appearing in what’s 
called a “natural” search—that is, appearing 
in the listing, hopefully in a high-up position, 
when someone types a relevant keyword—is 
purely a matter of how the search engines 
have analyzed your subject matter, and how 
“important” they understand your store to be.
(Extra website content has got to be 
relevant, however.)
4.	 How much traffic you get. A popular site will 
rise in the rankings.
5.	 How many other sites link to you. This shows 
popularity—it’s another measure of how 
“important” a site is perceived to be by the 
search engines. (The sites that link to you 
should be relevant to your subject matter.)

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO 
PREPARE YOUR ONLINE 
STORE FOR THE SEARCH 
ENGINES
Before you do anything, work out 
which keywords and phrases you 
are going to concentrate on (see 
the box). You’ll need keywords 
and phrases for your home page, 
and for each of your products.
1.	 Pay careful attention to 
your keywords and phrases 
when composing the text 
for the pages of your online 
store and for your individual 
products. Headings are 
especially important to the 
search engines, particularly 
the largest ones (labeled 
as “<h1>” in website code). 
Make sure you repeat your 
keywords in your text without 
sounding strange—apart from 
alienating your customers, 
you could also find yourself 
penalized for artificially 
including obvious repetitions.
2.	 There are three key areas 
within the code of your 
website that you need 
to pay attention to. Webstore 
platforms usually let you set 
these for each individual 
page of the site and for each 
product without going into 
the code. (If you’re using 
WordPress, you can use a 
plugin such as WordPress 
SEO by Yoast or All in One 
SEO Pack to input these.)
KEYWORDS AND PHRASES
SEO is all about keywords. Your keywords are the words you expect people to 
be typing into Google if they are looking for products like yours (key phrases are 
simply clusters of words). In order to prepare your site for the search engines, you 
need to be very clear on your most important keywords and phrases, and those 
that you also want to include but that can be classed as of secondary importance. 
For example, “pet products” and “pet supplies” might be your major key phrases, 
with “dog treats” and “dog chews” among your secondary.

i. The page titles 
(see the screenshot left)
This is the title that shows 
up at the top of your 
browser window when you 
are surfing the web. This 
is important for the search 
engines, and is the title that 
will show up in the rankings. 
Your most important 
keywords should be in here, 
but keep it short—any more 
than 65 characters won’t 
show up. If you include 
your brand or store name, 
put it at the end after your 
main keywords, separated 
by a “|” or a “-”. Make sure 
that the keywords you put 
into your page titles are 
also present in the actual 
page text.
	
ii. The page descriptions 
(see the screenshot left)
This is the description you 
can see under the title in 
the search engines. This 
text should include your 
keywords, but here you’re 
also writing for the real, 
human user. If your 
description is appealing, 
it’s much more likely the 
person reading it will 
click through to visit 
your site. Don’t go 
over 165 characters.
Most webstore platforms allow you to add titles, descriptions, and keywords 
for each page on the site (and with some systems, for each product), as well 
as specifying the web address of each page. Here we can see the Shopify (top) 
and Wix (above) interfaces for the home pages and the interior pages of the 
store. Shopify doesn’t include a keywords field, as these are widely regarded as 
redundant when entered into the code of a website. Note that Shopify allows you 
to add titles and descriptions for each product whereas this isn’t possible with 
Wix at present.

iii. Keywords
Putting keywords into the 
code of your online store 
is less important than 
it used to be, as search 
engines probably don’t 
refer to these any more 
(though of course, putting 
your keywords into the 
actual text of your site 
is absolutely essential).
However, if you have the 
option to do this, you 
might as well put in the 
keywords and phrases 
you chose for each page, 
separated by a comma. 
3.	 Pay attention to your page 
names or URLs. Your system 
may allow you to name the 
web addresses of your pages; 
if it does, name your pages in 
a way that is meaningful for 
the search engines.
4.	 Name your images in a 
useful way. While the search 
engines can’t “see” an image, 
they can read its filename. 
Instead of simply adding 
your images to your 
site with their existing 
filenames—for example 
“DEA_3022.jpg”—rename 
them with a meaningful 
filename, such as “metal-
table-lamp.jpg.” 
5.	 It’s likely that when you 
upload images you’ll be 
offered the chance to provide 
an “alt” (alternative) tag. 
These no longer serve their 
original purpose—which was 
to allow internet users with 
slow dial-up connections to 
switch off images and instead 
read what the images should 
be on the web pages they 
were viewing—but they do 
provide the search engines 
with information as to the 
content of the image, so 
you should be sure to use 
this opportunity.
6.	 Create an XML sitemap 
(“sitemap.xml”) for your 
store. This is a sitemap that 
the users don’t see, but it 
helps the search engine 
crawlers (“bots”) access all 
the pages of your site and 
see how often they are 
updated. Most systems allow 
you to generate a sitemap or 
will create one automatically 
for you. If using WordPress, 
you can use the Google XML 
Sitemaps plugin.
ONGOING TACTICS TO 
IMPROVE YOUR SEARCH 
ENGINE VISIBILITY
1.	 Work on getting links 
to your site from other 
websites. Getting online 
coverage of your store 
is one way of doing this.
2.	 Consider blogging and 
developing other content 
alongside your store, as the 
increase in relevant material 
will increase your “weight” 
in the eyes of the search 
engines, and as we’ve already 
stressed, they love material 
that’s updated often.
3.	 Promote your site in other 
ways, including offline 
marketing (see page 139), 
as the increase in traffic 
will boost your ranking.
A Yahoo Directory listing?
This is a costly investment ($299 
a year) that is probably not worth 
the expense for a small business, 
since Yahoo is no longer the 
search engine market leader. But 
if you have a real-world base for 
your store, you can get a free 
listing in Yahoo Local, as with 
Google Places (see the tip on 
page 145).
TIP

151
Be realistic with your search engine ambitions 
If you’re a small business and your products aren’t 
super-niche (which would mean you’d be easily found 
in a search), it may be best to focus on other marketing 
techniques. If you’re not on page one for your major 
keywords, it’s unlikely you’ll get a lot of traffic this way.
TIP
Submitting your site to the search engines
Google is by far the most important search 
engine, with Yahoo and Bing holding smaller 
slices of the pie—while they appear to be 
separate search engines, Yahoo listings are 
actually powered by Bing, so you don’t need to 
submit to them separately. Baidu has its own, 
smaller segment, but it’s for Chinese-language 
users; Yandex, similarly, dominates the Russian 
market. It’s very likely that your site will be 
found by the major search engines very rapidly 
without you having to do anything, but you can 
submit your site manually if you don’t find your 
site automatically listed.
To submit to Google 
(you’ll need to have a Google 
Webmaster Tools account): 
www.google.com/webmasters/tools/
submit-url
To submit to Bing (and Yahoo):
www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url
To submit to Baidu:
zhanzhang.baidu.com/sitesubmit/index
To submit to Yandex:
webmaster.yandex.com/addurl.xml
Webmaster tools
Both Google and Bing offer a suite of 
“Webmaster Tools” that will help you make 
sure your store is prepared effectively for the 
search engines. Sign up for each and submit 
your sitemap URL. Once signed up, you’ll be 
able to check that the search engines can 
read all the pages of your site correctly, and 
you can see how your store is listed in the 
rankings for your different keywords 
and phrases.

Social media
Social media OPTIONS
SOCIAL MEDIA IS OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE 
TO BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT 
FUNCTION ONLINE. YOUR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS 
ARE HANGING OUT THERE AND YOUR COMPETITORS 
ARE USING IT, SO TUNING IN TO PROMOTE YOUR 
NEW ONLINE STORE IS A NO-BRAINER. 
Most online store sytems give you a whole 
range of tools to help you connect your 
store and your chosen networks. 
At the time of writing, using Facebook 
and Twitter is standard practice for online 
businesses. Pinterest has also become 
a powerful selling tool; YouTube is the 
world’s second-largest search engine; 
and smartphone app Instagram has 
developed into a popular way of showing 
off the visual side of your business and 
reinforcing your brand. 
The goal of your social media activity 
is engagement with your existing and 
prospective customers, so that they will 
become loyal fans and buy from you, not 
just once, but repeatedly. There are dozens 
of other less-used networks also in existence, 
and the landscape will change over the 
next months and years with still more new 
networks arriving on the scene; what’s 
important is that you are where 
your customers are. 

153
Social media buttons on your online store
There are three kinds of social media 
buttons you can use, and you’ll most likely 
want to make use of all of them, if your 
system allows you to. They are:
1. Badges that link the site visitor to your 
profile page so they can view what you 
have posted (and hopefully participate).
Connecting your social media to 
your store will be more limited if 
you’re selling via a storefront, 
but you don’t have to limit your 
independent social media activity. 
Social media content ideas:
> new arrivals
> seasonal ideas
> contests
> special deals—time-sensitive ones 
are particularly effective
> pictures of people enjoying your 
products
> requests for opinions and 
feedback
> most common Q&As
> incentives to get people to 
interact—a prize for the first, 
the weirdest, the funniest story/
photo/comment etc.
Pictures of people enjoying your products make 
great social media material, like these photos sent 
in by happy customers. Right: www.facebook.com/
the.crabplace.
2. Buttons that allow visitors to “follow” or 
“like” you directly from your store, without 
having to leave it.
3. Buttons that allow visitors to “share” 
your material (product, blog post, or 
other content) directly to their network 
by whichever social media they choose 
to use.

154
C H A P T E R  12
USING FACEBOOK
> You need a Facebook business 
page rather than a personal 
profile to promote your online 
business. Go to www.
facebook.com/pages/create 
and choose a suitable 
category from the drop-down 
in the Brand or Product box to 
the right. Think carefully when 
you’re choosing your page 
name, as you’ll only be able 
to change it once.
> The “cover image” is 851 x 315 
pixels. It’s a good idea to 
prepare an image to this size 
beforehand to make sure 
it displays as you want. The 
profile picture displays at 
160 x 160 pixels, but it needs 
to be uploaded at a minimum 
of 180 x 180 pixels.
> Many webstores have a built-in 
system that lets you display 
your products as a store within 
your Facebook page (Wix, 
Shopify, Volusion; multiple 
apps also exist that you can 
add to do this). Some of these 
allow you to oblige a visitor to 
“like” you before they can see 
the store (a practice known 
as “like-gating”), others allow 
you to create discounts only 
accessible once a visitor “likes” 
the page.
> Images get better results 
on Facebook than any 
other kind of post—consider 
incorporating text into your 
images so they don’t need 
any extra explanation. If you 
have a special deal or contest 
running, consider creating a 
graphic to promote it. Another 
idea is instead of simply 
posting single product images, 
to do something creative with 
them, such as putting together 
collages or photographing 
your products in groups. 
The owners of Puppylove Dogstore (left) use the Fliptabify app with their Shopify store to show their products on their Facebook page. 
When a user clicks the product, they are automatically transferred to the main webstore. By contrast, the Beetailer Facebook app for 
Shopify used by Dirty Couture (right), allows the user to add to the cart without leaving Facebook, only going to the webstore to 
complete their payment. This app also adds other social media buttons to the Facebook store.

155
USING TWITTER
> Your Twitter profile image 
(it can be your logo rather 
than a face) will be displayed 
at 73 x 73 pixels. It will show 
up much smaller in the 
timeline, so make sure the 
image you upload is clear.
> You need to keep your posts 
within 140 characters so they 
need to be both succinct 
and interesting. Craft your 
messages with as much 
care as a newspaper crafts 
its headlines.
> You can include pictures 
and videos with your tweets, 
but users have to click an 
extra button to see them, 
so make the accompanying 
tweet enticing.
> Reply as quickly as you can 
to customer service questions
—even more quickly to any 
complaints that may arise—
to keep down the number 
of people who see them 
before you’ve solved the 
problem.
> Make use of hashtags in your 
tweets, e.g. #handmade. This 
makes it much more likely 
your tweet will be read by 
more people.
USING YOUTUBE
> Take the time to customize your channel and write a 
description of your business. Include tags, allow people 
to leave comments (you probably want to choose the 
“with approval” setting), and add your webstore address 
under the Advanced Options tab so that it shows up on 
your channel page.
> Don’t forget to include your webstore address in the 
video itself.
> Include your videos within your online store or on your blog.
Ideas for videos:
> testimonials from real customers—great for your website
> how-tos—as well as providing good content that will serve 
as a marketing tool, online information such as assembly 
instructions, if relevant, will also boost customer satisfaction
> product demos—much more effective than simple images
> customers using products
> your products being made (perhaps a virtual tour of your 
workshop?), or any other interesting story behind them
The YouTube channel for online store Gouletpens.com features a regular Q&A video 
answering real questions asked by customers.

156
C H A P T E R  12
> Pinterest can be an important selling tool—
clicks to websites from Pinterest reportedly 
bring twice as much revenue as those that 
originate from Facebook.
> To promote your products online, you need 
a business Pinterest account, so go here: 
business.pinterest.com (or convert an existing 
board by clicking the “Convert here” link). 
You’ll need to “verify” your website—this can 
be done by adding a snippet of code into your 
webstore template. Ask your webstore’s 
customer support to provide assistance or 
instructions, if needed. If using WordPress, 
you can use the Pinterest Verify Plugin. 
> Profile images need to be scaled to 160 × 165 
pixels. Include a description when you set up 
your profile as this will help people come 
across your boards when they search.
> As well as showing your products, Pinterest 
can be used as a “lookbook” or mood board 
for your brand. Use your boards to collect all 
kinds of visual inspiration and flesh out your 
fans’ view of your image.
> Collaborate with others whose products you 
like—pin their products as well as your own 
and you’ll find yours repinned all over 
Pinterest as well.
> As per the Facebook tip, create graphics you 
can pin to advertise your deals.
> When you upload your product images, 
include a link in the description to the page 
on your webstore, plus a price, to show the 
item is for sale.
> Pinterest has recently introduced a feature 
called “rich pins,” which allows product 
information—price, plus any price change, and 
whether the product is in stock or not—to 
appear on a board when someone pins the 
product image (plus, they also get notified 
by email when the price changes). If you use 
Shopify, you can implement this feature 
relatively easily by following the instructions; 
just search the Shopify manual for “rich pins.” 
As yet this feature isn’t available for other 
webstore systems, at least not without 
enlisting the help of a programmer.
> Pinterest also supports videos—these can be 
pinned from YouTube or Vimeo and will play 
within Pinterest.
> Ideas for boards other than simply posting 
your products, or groupings of your products, 
are: repurposing images from your blog posts; 
a current deals board (showing graphics of 
your deals); the people behind the products; 
and other visual influences.
USING PINTEREST

157
USING INSTAGRAM
> Featuring images snapped with a mobile phone (Apple 
or Android), to which filters are optionally applied, has taken 
off hugely as a way of showing your products in a more 
creative way. 
> You can use Instagram to promote special deals and sales 
(as in the screenshot shown), or just enjoy creating a more 
artistic image of your products and your company.
> Sign up via the App Store or Google Play. 
USING GOOGLE+
> At the time of writing, 
Google+ doesn’t have nearly 
as many users as Facebook 
but it looks as though it could 
well become huge. It also has 
a very nice, clean interface 
and displays your images, 
videos, and posts beautifully. 
> Google Hangouts—similar 
to live Skype sessions—are 
a great way to interact with 
your customers and they get 
saved as YouTube videos, so 
they can be accessed after 
the scheduled Hangout 
has passed.
> You need a business page 
to promote your store, rather 
than a personal page. Go to 
www.google.com/+/business 
and pick a category from the 
Product or Brand drop-down. 
Customize your page, post 
images, videos, and other 
content just as you would 
for your Facebook page, and 
invite your customers to follow 
you; try to cultivate as much 
activity on your Google+ page 
as you can.

Email marketing
Promoting your products 
BY EMAIL
EMAIL MARKETING IS ONE OF THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REMIND PEOPLE ABOUT 
YOUR PRODUCTS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO 
BUY, OR BUY AGAIN.
In order to promote your products via email, 
you need a list of people to contact. You 
can’t email people without their permission, 
as this is against the law, nor is it a good 
idea to purchase a list of email addresses, 
even if this list is composed of people who 
have accepted to receive emails from “third 
parties”—as you usually won’t get a good 
response from people who don’t know you. 
The most effective way of getting results 
from email marketing is—as with social 
media—by interacting with people who 
do know you, whether they’ve signed up 
from your website to receive updates or 
newsletters, or purchased from you in the 
past. This is called “permission marketing” 
and it can be really successful because 
you’re attempting to sell to people who you 
know are already interested in your products.
To manage the list of interested people, you 
need an account with a third-party email list 
manager, or ESP (email service provider), 
unless the system you’re using has a built-in 
list manager, such as Volusion, or if you’re 
running an eBay storefront, which has its 
own built-in system. Two of the most used 
third-party email marketing systems are

159
MailChimp is a hugely popular 
email list manager with a stunning 
collection of templates you can use. 
Left: mailchimp.com.
Connecting your webstore to your email list
In most cases you’ll find that an app exists to put a signup 
form for your mailing list on your site, so visitors can choose 
to receive your newsletters; if you don’t find an app, it’ll 
usually be possible to add an HTML signup form provided 
by your email list manager. 
If it’s possible, you’ll also want to integrate your customer 
list with your email list, so that when someone makes a 
purchase they are added to your email list automatically 
(otherwise you’ll have to do this manually). Most systems 
offer integrations, but if there isn’t an app to connect the 
two, try doing so via Zapier (zapier.com); you’ll need a 
premium account, but you may find it’s worth the cost to 
save your time.
TIP
MailChimp and Constant Contact, although 
there are dozens of other excellent ones 
(such as AWeber, iContact, and Mad Mimi). 
MailChimp is particularly popular as it’s free 
for up to 2,000 subscribers, has an 
extensive feature list, and many beautiful 
newsletter templates.

Customize your webstore 
emails
Customize the emails your 
system sends out: choose your 
own wording and add your logo 
(maybe even your social media 
links) to put your unique stamp 
on the whole experience.
Putting a friendly message in an automated email is much more engaging 
than using boring standard text, so change your automated messages 
whenever possible. Above: www.thejournalshop.com.
TIP
USING EMAIL MARKETING
> Create interesting subject 
lines—your first goal is to 
succeed in getting the 
email opened!
> Who is the email “from”? 
Sometimes it’s more effective 
to have the email appear as 
though it’s coming from a 
particular person in the team, 
rather than simply from the 
company. It will depend on 
how you’re presenting your 
company—small and personal 
or more corporate?
> ESPs usually let you 
personalize the subject line 
and/or the email with the 
receiver’s first name. This only 
works if you’re sure you have 
the right information—not 
everyone fills in the Name field 
correctly when they sign up 
for updates. Another issue is 
whether it could seem overly 
familiar to be on first-name 
terms with your customers—
it’s your decision.
Stay within the law
There are strict rules 
governing how you send 
out your newsletters and 
follow-up customer emails. 
Your ESP will help you to a 
certain extent in that it will 
automatically include your 
business address and an 
unsubscribe link at the 
bottom of your emails, as 
required; for more precise 
information on what you 
need to do to adhere to 
the rules, see Chapter 15.
“Dear Alannah Moore,
Thanks for joining up at The Journal 
Shop. That was pretty smart of you—
now you’ll have access to some of the 
world’s best stationery as well as some 
of the world’s best customer service. 
We’re kind of obsessive-compulsive 
about these things. 
Anyway, first things first: let’s show 
you the ropes. To log in…”

161
Growing your email list
If you exhibit at shows or fairs, 
collect email addresses for your 
newsletter, either on a paper form 
that people can fill in, using a 
tablet (directly into your mailing 
list system), or by asking them 
to leave business cards in a box.
You could also run a competition 
at a real-world event with one of 
your products as the prize, and 
have everyone who enters agree 
to be added to your email list.
TIP
> Once your email has been 
opened, your goal is to 
encourage the reader to 
click over to your store (and 
hopefully make a purchase). 
So, make as much as possible 
in the email “clickable”—your 
images, product titles, parts 
of the text, and so on.
> Remember to keep the copy 
customer-centric. Your text 
will be much more effective 
if you focus on benefits, not 
features, as we talked about in 
Chapter 5 (see the Christmas 
newsletter to the right for a 
great example).
> Include information that 
doesn’t simply promote 
your products, for example, 
interesting stories that might 
feature your products. As well 
as selling, you are also aiming 
at building a relationship with 
your customers, so you don’t 
want to come across too 
overtly commercial.
> Create a schedule for your 
mailings. You don’t have to 
send them too often, just 
make sure they’re regular.
> Include a “View in browser” 
link at the top of your email 
in case your readers’ email 
software can’t read HTML. 
> Your ESP will give you the 
option of creating a text 
version as well as an HTML 
version, so opt to do both.
> According to a recent study, 
email marketing is most 
effective when the emails are 
sent on the weekend, and in 
the evenings between 8pm 
and midnight.
This newsletter from a children’s craft supplier gives plenty of project ideas as well as 
promoting its products. Also note the text, which is cleverly written to create the image 
of busy, occupied creative children in the reader’s mind (benefits), rather than simply 
listing the products and their prices (features). Above: www.littlecraftybugs.co.uk.
“This fantastic craft collection is 
perfect for keeping the kids occupied 
this festive season!”
“We think that the festive season 
is a brilliant reason to get crafting, 
especially to get the kids involved! 
Why not make your own baubles 
and decorations? Stockings? Cards? 
Something for the table maybe? Or 
how about something just to keep 
the little elves occupied?”

Increasing your sales
YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR TRAFFIC THROUGH 
MARKETING, SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION, 
AND SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT YOUR MAIN GOAL 
WILL BE TO INCREASE YOUR SALES.
Now that you have visitors to your site, how 
do you convert those visitors into buyers?
If you have a hundred visitors to your site 
a day, and two of these make purchases, 
that means you have a 2% “conversion rate.” 
You might assume that if you manage to 
get more visitors to your site, you will 
achieve more sales, but if you have to pay 
for advertising to achieve this extra traffic, 
your profits won’t increase at the same rate. 
It’s therefore worth doing everything you 
can to increase your conversion rate—that 
is, turning as many of your existing site 
visitors as possible into customers.
Website conversion rates vary dramatically 
according to the field you’re in and factors 
such as how well you’re known. They can 
range from 0.5% up to 10%, or even higher 
(sites like Amazon.com have conversion 
rates above 20%). As a general rule, if your 
conversion rate is 2% or under, there 
will be ways you can improve it. 
Website “CONVERSION” 

163
Paying attention to the 
following can have a 
significant impact on 
your conversion rate.
> We saw in Chapter 4 how 
conveying the right image is 
essential. Does your site look 
professional? Does your logo 
strike the right note? 
> Do your photographs look 
professional enough? Do they 
show your products from all 
angles, and in enough detail, 
and in all the different colors 
available, etc.?
> People want to do business 
with people they like. We’ve 
looked at conveying an image 
of the company and the people 
behind it via an “About” page, 
and how a blog can help to 
engage your visitors. Does 
your site interest and engage 
your prospective customers?
> We discussed the trust factor 
back in Chapter 5. Does your 
site reassure your visitors? Do 
you display payment gateway 
badges, do you show when 
products are out of stock, do 
you clearly show your terms 
and delivery charges?
> Are your products or services 
good quality? Will your 
customers be happy when 
they receive them?
> Is the price right? As we’ve 
said, it’s easy for people to 
compare prices so your prices 
need to be competitive.
> Can people see reviews on 
your site? If you can’t add 
independent reviews, you 
can at least publish ones 
you’ve asked for on your 
site. Do you display any 
testimonials (e.g. thanking 
you for your great customer 
service) prominently, or are 
they hidden away?
> As we’ve said, tablets and 
smartphones are growing in 
importance with more and 
more shoppers using them to 
make online purchases. If your 
system offers you the option 
of a mobile version of your 
webstore (quite often a 
different design specifically 
created for mobile use), make 
sure you enable it from your 
admin area so that your 
customers can shop as easily 
as possible, even via a very 
small screen. Other systems— 
such as Wix—will automatically 
optimize your online store for 
mobile viewing.
> Make it easy for your 
customers to buy, and to 
receive—offer multiple 
payment options and multiple 
delivery options.
> Help your customers find 
what they want. Organize your 
products into categories, make 
it easy to search your store, 
and display the most popular 
products upfront.
> Can your customers contact 
you easily? Display a contact 
number (there are numerous 
systems offering local or 
free numbers you can use 
to forward calls to your own 
landline or cellphone) as well 
as an email form for questions, 
and an online chat facility 
if appropriate. As we’ve 
mentioned, customers expect 
you to reply to queries fast.
> Do you have an FAQ page on 
your site? Your goal should be 
to remove any doubts from 
the mind of the buyer that 
might dissuade him or her 
from following through.
> Do you offer any incentives? 
For example, time-sensitive 
special offers, free bonuses, 
free shipping, if viable.
> Finally, make your site 
stand out. As we know—
you probably do it yourself—
consumers carry out research 
before buying and will most 
likely visit numerous sites. Do 
what you can to make them 
remember yours and come 
back to make their purchase.

GOOGLE SHOPPING AND COMPARISON 
SHOPPING ENGINES
The images of products that appear in Google 
when you conduct a product search (as per 
the screenshot on page 144) are paid-for ads 
(PLAs—product listing ads). To have your 
products appear here, you’ll need both 
a Google Merchant Center Account and a 
Google Adwords account; go to www.google.
com/ads/shopping, link the two accounts 
together, and set up your data feed as per 
the instructions. You can also submit your 
products for inclusion in various comparison 
shopping engines (CSEs), such as 
PriceGrabber, Shopzilla, and Shopping.com. 
These are paid-for services and you’ll need to 
set up separate accounts for each. Apps exist 
that you can use from within your webstore 
platform to add your products to the various 
CSEs and to Google Shopping.
TURNING CUSTOMERS INTO REPEAT 
CUSTOMERS
We’ve looked at many ideas that can help you 
turn the visitors who come to your website into 
paying customers. Another way you can increase 
your sales is by doing everything you possibly can 
to turn your customers into repeat customers.
We’ve stressed customer service throughout the 
book as an essential tool for the small business. 
It’s well known that it makes good business 
sense for you to cherish your existing customers 
because it’s much easier, and costs you much 
less, than going out and finding new ones. If you 
provide a great customer experience (including 
prompt delivery and excellent product quality) 
the chances are they’ll come back to you, and 
speak well about you to their friends.
Some ideas to help you secure repeat 
customers:
> Follow up on sales with a personal email asking 
for any feedback.
> Keep in touch with your customers (via social 
media and email).
> Make your customers feel special, part of a club, 
so they’ll feel loyal to you.
> Include extra goodies with deliveries, if possible.
> Include handwritten notes, if possible.
> Offer customer-only promotions.
> Respond personally to good reviews, thanking 
the customer.
> Respond to complaints by apologizing and 
rectifying the situation as best and as rapidly as 
possible—you may well succeed in turning the 
situation around.
The images of products shown when you search for an item in 
Google are paid-for ads. To have your products appear in Google’s 
search results, go to www.google.com/ads/shopping, configure 
your account, and set up a data feed.
Other ideas to INCREASE YOUR SALES

165
MORE IDEAS TO INCREASE YOUR SALES
> Cross-selling—offering a choice of similar 
products gives the visitor another chance to 
buy, if the first product they looked at wasn’t 
exactly what they wanted.
> Upselling—offering an add-on, an accessory, 
or a more expensive item than the one 
currently being purchased. Many systems 
allow you the possibility of offering cross-
sells and upsells to your customers.
> Distribute promotion codes.
> Offer gift certificates.
> Offer seasonal promotions.
> Set up a wish list system.
> Create a loyalty program.
> Offer “fans-only” discounts to your social 
media followers (as we talked about in 
Chapter 12).
> Offer discounts to newsletter subscribers.
> Listen to your customers to improve the 
shopping experience. Follow up sales and 
put a prominent feedback page on your 
website that encourages customers to 
comment on their experience. This will not 
only generate you some nice testimonials, 
but also allow you to . . . 
> Act on any complaints you receive. People 
are happy to tell you if they’ve had a bad 
shopping experience; turn lemons to 
lemonade and take action.
> Ask your customers what they want. Perhaps 
there is something else you could provide 
that they’d be happy to buy from you?
ONLINE REVIEWS AND SELLER RATINGS
Online reviews are a powerful way of 
generating more sales. For seller ratings to 
show up in Google (whether in the natural 
search results, AdWords, or Google Shopping 
listings—see the screenshot on page 144), 
your customers need to have reviewed your 
products on a third-party review site such as 
Trustpilot, PriceGrabber, ResellerRatings, or 
Epinions; you need at least 30 reviews before 
Google will show the rating. Alternatively, 
there are review apps you can add to your 
store, such as Yotpo, which automatically 
sends the customer an email asking for a 
review, once the order has been fulfilled.
Trustpilot is one of several sites that allow customers to leave 
independent reviews. When you have enough reviews, the number 
of stars will start showing up in Google next to your listing.
Browse around well-known online stores and see what 
they are doing that you could implement to encourage 
your visitors to buy.

Legalities
Considerations
WHEN YOU’RE SETTING UP AN E-COMMERCE 
BUSINESS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RULES 
YOU HAVE TO ADHERE TO. 
PCI-COMPLIANCE
The Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements 
designed to ensure that all companies 
that process, store, or transmit credit card 
information maintain a secure environment. 
Since you’re selling online, you need to make 
sure your online store complies with these 
rules. Failing to do so could result in severe 
penalties, but the good news is that if you’re 
running an eBay or an Amazon storefront, 
or are using Wix, Shopify, Bigcommerce, or 
Volusion as a webstore platform, your online 
store is automatically PCI-compliant. If 
you’re using WordPress, you need to make 
sure your payment system functions within 
the guidelines. In the WordPress example in 
this book, we signed up with the low-cost 
Mijireh Checkout service (free to sign up), 
which works with WooCommerce to make 
it PCI-compliant.
For more information about PCI-
compliance, see these links:
www.pcicomplianceguide.org
www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_
standards/index.php
PRIVACY
Specific laws, depending on which country 
or state you are based in, demand that you 
publish a privacy policy on your website. 
Broadly speaking, this statement declares 

167
to your site visitors what 
information you are gathering 
from them and what you plan to 
do with it. Generally, you need 
to state that you will protect any 
personal information, such as 
names and email addresses, and 
any other consumer information. 
See the links below as a 
starting point, but do check 
what applies to you according 
to where you’re based. 
www.sba.gov/content/privacy-
law
www.sba.gov/community/
blogs/7-considerations-crafting-
online-privacy-policy
COOKIES
Since May 2011, an EU-wide law 
declares that all websites that 
use cookies need to display 
information about the cookies 
they use and allow the user to 
opt in or opt out. Cookies are 
small files stored on a user’s 
computer that web pages can 
access to determine what is 
shown on the web page being 
looked at; these are often 
regarded as a way of “spying” 
on consumers, but mostly 
they simply improve your user 
experience in simple ways such 
as showing information on a 
page the first time you visit it, 
and not on subsequent visits, 
or setting the currency on 
a webstore to the one used 
where you are. 
Since cookies are an essential 
part of a webstore, if you are 
based in the EU or you do 
business with customers in the 
EU, this applies to you. It isn’t 
as complicated as it may sound 
to comply with the rules. Some 
webstore systems will provide a 
pop-up system that allows users 
to opt in or out of cookie use 
on your website with a simple 
mechanism that allows them to 
agree to continue browsing. If 
yours doesn’t, you can publish 
a simple statement announcing 
that you use cookies and that 
continued browsing of the site 
assumes acceptance, and link 
to a page giving more details 
of the cookies used. At the 
time of writing, you’ll find 
Bigcommerce and Shopify 
have a cookie law solution in 
place that you can use, plus 
detailed instructions on how 
to implement it. WordPress has 
a large number of easy-to-use 
plugins you can install. For Wix 
and Volusion, you’ll need to rely 
on a statement as at the time 
of writing they don’t have a 
ready-to-use solution.

TRADEMARKS AND 
COPYRIGHT
You get the rights to your trade 
name the moment you start 
using it, but you only get the 
right to prevent other people 
from using it when you register 
it as a trademark.
Trademarks are covered by 
trademark law and are specific 
words, symbols, or slogans 
that identify your products 
or services. Registering a 
trademark is important to 
protect your identity; if you’re 
not protected, you could find 
someone stealing your identity 
and your customers once you’ve 
built up your business by using 
your words and slogans. Just as 
important for a small business 
is being sure that you aren’t 
unknowingly using someone 
PLAYING BY THE RULES
Since rules vary considerably according to where you’re based, 
you’re advised to check out the ruling specific to where you are. 
This chapter will give you a heads-up as to what you need to 
look into.

C H A P T E R  15
else’s trademarked words or 
slogans, as this could mean 
trouble for you. Trademark 
research is therefore essential 
before you start your business; 
you can pay a specialist firm to 
carry out the research for you.
Copyright, as distinct from a 
trademark, is the right of the 
creator to own creative works 
such as art, software, or writing. 
(Note that you can’t copyright 
ideas, but you can copyright 
their implementation—the 
artwork, or the words you use 
to convey them.) When you 
create a work, it is automatically 
copyrighted. This means that as 
soon as your logo appears on 
a web page, the copyright is 
yours. You don’t have to display 
a copyright symbol on your 
website, but if you do, you 
express your copyright authority 
more officially. A usual copyright 
statement is: “© [YEAR] [Your 
name]. All rights reserved.” 
In order to protect yourself 
further you can officially register 
your copyright. You may well 
want to consider this as it’s 
usually relatively inexpensive 
and uncomplicated, and it will 
mean your case carries much 
more weight should you ever 
need to go to court over 
copyright issues.
Every country has its own 
procedures for registering 
trademarks and copyright.

following links may be useful.

EMAIL
We’ve mentioned the rules you need to adhere to when you’re 
sending out commercial email. They are not hard to follow:
> Don’t add people to your email list without their permission, 
but you are allowed to add past customers to your list.
> Your message needs to show a correct email address and show 
the name of the person or business who sent the email.
> You may not use a misleading subject line (you wouldn’t want 
to do this anyway).
> You need to make it clear if the message is an advert rather 
than an update.
> You need to include your physical business address.
> You need to tell people how to unsubscribe from your list 
within the email.
> You need to unsubscribe people if they request it (your 
mailing list manager will take care of this automatically).
For precise information about the requirements of the 
CAN-SPAM Act, see the link: www.business.ftc.gov/
documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business 
(CAN-SPAM Compliance Guide)
TAX AND FISCAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Each country, and each state 
within the U.S., has different 
rules, so you’ll need to research 
or seek professional advice on 
what kind of business entity you 
need to set up, what records 
you need to keep, and what 
kind of sales taxes you need 
to charge your customers. 
If you’re based in the U.S., 
the U.S. Small Business 
Administration website is a 
good place to get legal and 
tax information: www.sba.gov

169
BUSINESS PERMITS AND OTHER LEGAL 
REQUIREMENTS
Again, depending on where you are based, 
you may find you need a permit to do 
business from your home. 
If you’re doing business with other 
countries, you’ll need to make sure you 
comply with international trade laws. 
See here: www.hg.org/trade.html
If you’re based in the U.S., you can apply for a registered trademark 
online at www.uspto.gov.
If you use a hosted webstore platform like those we look at in this 
book, or if you sell via an Amazon or an eBay storefront, your online 
store is automatically PCI-compliant.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
The basic programming language 
used to build websites. You won’t 
need to know any to use any of 
the systems in this book (with 
the exception of Volusion, which 
requires you to copy, paste, and 
adjust already written snippets 
of code).
Integration Connecting your 
webstore with third-party systems, 
often via an app, so that certain tasks 
happen automatically. For example, 
subscribers signing up to your

your website, shipping rates being 
calculated, and orders being passed 
to your fulfillment house.

security as set down by the Payment 
Card Industry Security Council (see 
Chapter 15).
Piggyback If you sell via a site such 
as Amazon, eBay, or Etsy, you 
benefit from the large amount of 
website traffic that already visits that 
site, so you could be considered to 
be “piggybacking” on the success of 
that site. See Marketplace.

alongside their prices, appearing

engines include Yahoo! and Bing.

173
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 
The practice of tweaking your site—
its content and coding—in order to 
get the highest possible ranking in 
the search engines.
Share To mention an article on 
a website (or a product) to a 
particular social media network; this 
is usually done by clicking a Tweet, 
Pin, or Share on Facebook button 
directly from the website.
Shopping cart The piece of

store customers to select the 
products they want to buy. It’s also 
where they view the products 
they’ve chosen, before moving to the 
checkout page.
Sidebar The column on the left or on 
the right of some web pages.
Slider A large image usually toward 
the top of the home page that 
displays a sequence of images in 
rotation. A slider usually contains 
pictures of seasonal offers or 
bestsellers, and often has writing in it 
as well as images to encourage the 
site visitor to click or buy. This is 
sometimes known as a “carousel.”
Social media Online networks 
via which users create, share, and 
exchange information and ideas (e.g. 
Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.).
Spam Unrequested email messages, 
usually containing advertisements. 
(Also known as Unsolicited 
Commercial Email—“UCE.”)
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) A 
system used to encrypt sensitive 
information input via your website, 
such as your customers’ credit card 
numbers and other personal data.
Storefront This term can mean 
an online store in general, but in 
this book we use the term more 
precisely to describe the collection 
of your products displayed on 
a single page within a larger 
marketplace environment such 
as eBay or Amazon.
Subscribe To sign up to receive an 
email newsletter or to follow a blog 
by email.
Tag A keyword you can add to a 
product (or a blog post) to enable 
your site visitors to find the product 
via your site search.
Theme Another word for a 
template. The template you apply 
will determine the layout, the 
colors, and the fonts; some may be 
customizable to a greater or lesser 
extent (Wix, WordPress, Shopify), 
but this is not always the case. 
Other webstores (Bigcommerce, 
Volusion) don’t allow you to 
customize the themes at all 
without going into the code.
Thumbnail A small, square image, 
often of a product. When clicked on, 
the visitor usually gets to see a larger 
image, plus details of the product.
TLD (Top Level Domain) Examples 
are “.com” or “.co.uk.” See Extension.
Tracking Observing and analyzing 
your website traffic statistics, in

to find your site, the pages they 
visited, how long they stayed on 
the site, and so on.
Traffic The visitors to your website.
Tweet A message sent via Twitter.
Upload Putting a file on your 
website, for example an image file, 
usually via the admin area of your 
online store.
URL The address of a site or web 
page, e.g. www.yourwebstore.com
USP (Unique Selling Point) The 
factor that sets you apart from 
your competitors, for example your 
products being the very latest, or 
your customer service the best.
Visits Refers to people who visit 
your website (as distinct from “hits,” 
which are simply the number of 
times a certain item, such as an 
image, is viewed on your website).
Web host The company who 
provides you with space on which 
to construct your website in 
cyberspace. Most of the webstore 
systems in this book are “hosted.” 
See Hosted webstore.
Website conversion The practice of 
trying to encourage your webstore 
visitors to purchase something and 
become a paying customer, for 
example, by ensuring any questions 
they may have are answered clearly 
on the site.
Webstore An online store. In the 
real world, this term is used generally 
to describe anywhere on the web 
where a purchase can be made, 
but in this book, we use it more 
specifically to mean your own store 
online, as distinct from adding your 
products to a larger marketplace 
such as eBay where you have your 
own “storefront,” that displays your 
products, but over which you have 
little branding control.
Wholesaler A company that 
provides products at a low bulk 
price, that you, as a store owner, will 
then sell on to your retail customers 
at a higher price.
Widget An element, most usually 
found in the sidebar or in the footer 
area of your website, such as a 
Facebook Like button with faces, or 
customer reviews. Widgets are often 
provided by third parties for display 
on your online store.

Acknowledgments
Many thanks to my editors at The Ilex Press—Ellie Wilson, 
Zara Larcombe, and Nick Jones—and to Laura Hodgson, 
Elizabeth Milovidov, Sarah Cole, and Hugh Abbott for 
ideas, encouragement, and brainstorming. Thanks too to 
all the online store owners who allowed me to include 
screenshots of their sites, and the webstore/storefront 
providers who answered my questions.
