Introduction
F
ace it: Life is stressful. Just going through your normal daily routine can
often leave you frazzled and out of balance. And, if you’re like most
people, you also have to cope with your share of aches and pains, ranging
from those mild-yet-irritating annoyances to the big-time, all-consuming
pains.
Wouldn’t it be great if you could wave a magic wand to restore balance and
harmony to your life and to help alleviate some of those aches and pains?
Well, in a way, you can. Only instead of a magic wand, you use your own two
hands (or someone else’s). That’s all it takes to unleash the healing power
you have inside you — power that you can put to good use through the tech-
niques of acupressure and reflexology.
About This Book
Because acupressure and reflexology are rooted in ancient oriental healing
arts, they can seem mysterious and intimidating to understand. That’s where
this book comes in. We tell you everything you need to know about these
bodywork techniques, from start to finish. We begin by explaining exactly
what acupressure and reflexology are, and how they came to be. After a short
history lesson (very brief, we promise), we get into the real “meat” of the
book — showing you exactly how these techniques can improve your quality
of life and alleviate some of your pain.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate easily through this book, we set up a few conventions
that we use consistently throughout the book:
 Anytime we want to highlight new words or terms that we define in the
text, we italicize them.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate the action part of numbered steps and
the keywords of a bulleted list.
 We use monofont for Web sites and e-mail addresses.

 In the illustrations and healing routines, we use abbreviations for the
acupoints for simplicity’s sake — we provide the full names of the points
and their accompanying meridians (see Chapter 1 for a definition) in the
accompanying tables.
 Every acupoint has many functions, and different routines use the same
points for different reasons. We list only the functions that we’re focus-
ing on in a specific routine, so you see different functions for the same
point in different routines.
 Because acupressure was developed in Japan from Chinese acupuncture
theories and practices, the terms used to describe these two very simi-
lar practices are often different, which can cause some confusion. In this
book, we use the Japanese terms. We do, however, provide the Chinese
names as well in cases where the Chinese terms are more common.
 Some meridians have multiple names. In this book, we use the meridian
names we like best.
 Most acupoints have many different names. We used the most common
names in this book, but you may see many variations in other literature.
 The meridian illustrations throughout this book are renditions and
aren’t meant to be taken as exact maps. For precise detail, refer to
acupuncture textbooks.
 The bladder meridian (see Chapter 3) has two different numbering sys-
tems. In this book, we use the system that numbers the inside line and
then the outside line before heading down the leg. (Traditional Chinese
Medicine, from which acupuncture stems, typically uses the alternate
numbering system.)
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If you come across these instances, rest assured that
we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as a hyphen) to indicate the
break. So, when typing one of these Web addresses in a Web browser, just
type in exactly what you see in this book, pretending as if the line break 
doesn’t exist.
Foolish Assumptions
Although we normally don’t like to make assumptions, we made an exception
in this case in order to make this book most helpful to as many readers as
possible. To that end, we assume that:
 You have little or no previous training in acupressure or reflexology.
 You have a positive attitude and will do your best to focus that positive
energy on the healing process.
2
Acupressure & Reflexology For Dummies 

 You approach this process with an open mind, welcoming new ideas and
techniques that may seem strange or foreign to you at first.
 You or someone you know has some aches, pains, or general uneasiness
that you or they want to treat in a natural way.
 You want to discover how your body has the capability of healing itself
(within reason — we’d never suggest that acupressure or reflexology can
cure cancer or perform any other type of medical miracle).
What You’re Not to Read
Granted, we like to think every single word on these pages is important.
However, the information in the gray sidebars is interesting and informative,
but it isn’t required reading in order for to you to grasp the material in each
chapter. We like to think of them as a bonus — a tasty little dessert to enjoy
after you digest the main course.
How This Book Is Organized
Acupressure and Reflexology For Dummies is divided into five parts, each of
which has its own special theme and focus. Here’s an outline of the parts, and
highlights of what you can find in each of them.
Part I: Touching on the Basics of
Acupressure and Reflexology
If you know little or nothing about these bodywork techniques, we recom-
mend that you start by reading Part I. Here, we give you all the basics of
these healing arts, including
 Definitions of important terms
 A quick overview of the history of ancient oriental healing arts
 Basic healing art principles such as qi, yin/yang, and energy forces
 Things you need to know to prepare to heal yourself or others
 Maps of the meridians and reflex zones, the foundations of these healing
sessions, to serve as your guide throughout the rest of the book
 Full explanations of all the techniques used in both acupressure and
reflexology, along with illustrations to show you how to perform them
3
Introduction

This part also teaches some basic exercises that come in handy to get you
warmed up, and gives you a preview of what the recipient and provider can
both expect from a session. We also cover all the important issues you need
to consider when enlisting professional help — from finding qualified candi-
dates to evaluating their credentials. In addition, we give you a sneak peek of
what to expect from your first session.
Part II: Promoting Emotional and 
Physical Wellness
An important concept when it comes to healing is the strong connection
between emotional health and physical well-being. If your emotions are upset
or out of balance, you will almost inevitably experience physical discomfort
as a result. This is a major belief in the healing arts. Separating emotional and
physical well-being is almost impossible. The two go hand-in-hand, and if you
focus on one while neglecting the other, you won’t reap the full benefits of
your healing sessions.
To that end, in this part we focus on maintaining the best possible health,
both physically and emotionally. We explain the correlation between energy
and emotions, and we show you how negative and positive thinking can
affect your physical well-being.
Of course, we know that realistically you can’t totally avoid emotional stress,
so we also show you how to do damage control and keep those unavoidable
stressors from wreaking havoc on your body.
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating
Common Aches and Ailments
Most likely, you’re dealing with at least one or two aches or pains at this very
moment. Perhaps that’s why you picked up this book, hoping it would help
you attain some relief from your discomfort.
Relax, we’re here to help. In this part, we target specific body parts and iden-
tify common ailments that often afflict those areas. More importantly, we pro-
vide — in clear, easy-to-understand steps — routines you can do to address
these particular ailments.

Acupressure & Reflexology For Dummies 

Here are a few of the problems we cover in this part: backaches, including
sciatica and muscle strain; pain in the hips and legs; headaches and other
problems in the facial region; problems in the arms, shoulders, and hands;
digestive problems and other stomach concerns; and issues affecting the
heart and chest.
Part IV: Addressing Specific 
Needs and Concerns
In this part, we get a bit more specific, addressing issues that may be of par-
ticular interest to certain groups of people.
First, we touch on the various pains and problems that tend to be age related.
This applies to people on all ends of the chronological spectrum, from babies
to seniors and everyone in between.
Then we discuss those myriad problems that plague our female readers.
Ladies, we feel your pain — and we come to your rescue in Chapter 16. (To
our male readers: We’re not neglecting you. It’s just that women have several
major gender-specific needs, whereas the majority of problems that may
plague men are covered throughout other areas of this book.)
We also cover routines for handling common conditions like colds and the
flu, and we talk about boosting the immune system for preventive measures.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In every For Dummies book, you find the Part of Tens. The last two chapters
in this book address facts and fallacies about acupressure and reflexology,
and also illustrate just a few of the many ways that these healing arts can
enrich your life.
And last but not least, we include an appendix full of various resources in
case you hunger for a more advanced understanding of acupressure and
reflexology, want to find a good practitioner, or simply want to talk it up with
others who love the healing arts as much as you do.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you find different small pictures in the margins. These
pictures, called icons, alert you to little tidbits of information along the way.
Here’s a list of icons you will encounter in this book:
As the name implies, this icon lets you know that we’re sharing a little helpful
piece of information that relates in some way to the material we cover in that
section.
This icon points out little pieces of material that you should commit to
memory.
You should pay special attention to the Warning icon, because it cautions you
away from things you should avoid in order to stay safe and prevent any
problems.
Where to Go from Here
Although we hope you find this book so intriguing that you devour it from
cover to cover, the path you take to explore it is totally up to you. We
designed this book to be a complete how-to guide for the beginning healer. If
you have a specific need, you can dive right into a specific chapter. The chap-
ters are complete and thorough enough to stand on their own so that you can
zero in on particular topics (or parts of the body) that interest you most.
Otherwise, we recommend starting at the beginning and working your way
through the book. Don’t worry — you can jump past any topics that don’t
interest you at the moment and skip ahead to others that do. (You can always
go back and catch up on what you missed later on.)

Acupressure & Reflexology For Dummies 

Part I
Touching on the
Basics of
Acupressure and
Reflexology

In this part . . .
P
art I gives you all the important essentials you need
to know about acupressure and reflexology. Think of
this as your Healing 101 introductory course.
We explain exactly what acupressure and reflexology are,
and what they mean to anyone who needs emotional
and/or physical healing. We fill you in on the history of the
healing arts and the meaning of qi. We tell you what you
need to heal yourself and others — your own two hands
and confidence in yourself — and give you a little pep talk
to strengthen your faith in your innate ability to heal.
Finally, we review the anatomical concepts that you need
to know in order to properly perform the techniques in
this book. You become familiar with the meridians, acu-
points, reflex zones, different types of tissue, and other
body parts that play an important part in the healing
process. Unless you already have some massage training,
we strongly suggest that you read this part so that you
know all the basics.

Acupressure and Reflexology
Essentials
In This Chapter
 Defining acupressure and reflexology
 Tracing the roots of the healing arts
 Getting the keys to understanding qi
 Finding out how bodywork can help you
I
f you’re like most people, you know little (if anything) about acupressure
and reflexology. You may incorrectly believe that acupressure involves
needles. It doesn’t — but don’t worry, we address that and other misconcep-
tions in the next few chapters. And when thinking about reflexology, you may
guess from the name that it involves your reflexes in some way, but that may
pretty much be the extent of your insight on the topic.
Or perhaps you do have some knowledge of the healing arts. You may know,
for example, that a basic tenet of these approaches is the idea that pain can
often be traced back to its root, which is often some distance away from the
place where the pain is felt. However, you may not know exactly what that is,
or how to trace the source of your pain.
Regardless of your knowledge level, or your reason for wanting to discover
more, you can definitely benefit from reading about these important
approaches to healing. Bodywork is beneficial to almost everyone, and it’s
often helpful if you know the background behind the techniques.
In this chapter, you explore the roots of reflexology and acupressure. You find
out about the fundamental principles involved, including the concept of qi.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you discover how these approaches to
healing can help you. No matter what your physical ailment or health con-
cern, you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised at the difference even a minimal
amount of bodywork can make.

Acupressure and Reflexology Defined
Before you get too far into the healing routines and practices that we discuss
in this book, you need to make sure that you understand exactly what acu-
pressure and reflexology are. They’re closely related, and in much of this
book we refer to them jointly as a pair of complementary healing arts. But
despite their similarities, they do have some differences.
Acupressure
Acupressure is an ancient healing art that entails using an object (generally the
hands or arms) to stimulate specific key points on the body with the goal of
relieving pain or discomfort. Pain and discomfort are considered to be signs of
energy imbalance, which, if left in this state, will become illness and disease.
Acupressure approaches this energy imbalance in a concrete way through the
identification of acupoints. Acupoints are located on meridians, or channels that
run throughout the body and connect all parts of the body together. These acu-
points are specific sites on the body that often treat pain or discomfort else-
where. By addressing problems or imbalances at the acupoints, you can balance
the flow of energy and thereby reduce or eliminate pain in the affected areas.
Many people confuse acupressure with acupuncture. The two are similar and
closely related. Both rely on the same fundamental principles, and both use
the same points and meridians. The most important difference: acupuncture
uses pins — technically, they’re hair-thin, sterile needles — and acupressure
doesn’t. This difference is crucial, because the needle aspect is something
that makes many people squeamish or nervous about acupuncture. For those
people, acupressure can be an equally effective — yet much less nerve-
wracking — alternative.

Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology
Eunice Ingham: Reflexology’s patron saint
Reflexology first began catching on in the
United States in the early 1900s. This was due in
large part to a woman named Eunice Ingham.
Eunice was a massage therapist who worked in
the 1920s for a man named Joe Shelby Riley. Dr.
Riley was well known as the creator of the Zone
Theory, which is often seen as the precursor to
modern-day reflexology. Inspired by Dr. Riley,
Eunice expanded on the ideas of zone therapy
while focusing on only one zone, the feet. She
published her first book on the topic, called
Stories the Feet Can Tell, in 1938. Soon Eunice
became an in-demand teacher and lecturer
who was often asked to share her knowledge of
healing therapies. Eventually, she was joined by
her nephew, Dwight Byers, who went on to
become the founder of the International
Institute of Reflexology.

Reflexology
Reflexology is a system of healing based on balancing energy by stimulating
areas in the feet and hands that relate to organs, glands, and parts of the
body. Reflexology is similar to acupressure in basic principle, but the two
have some differences as well. They both correct imbalances in the energy
force by focusing on specific areas of the body where they pinpoint (and
treat) that imbalance. Although acupressure involves meridians and acu-
points, reflexology relies on pathways called reflex zones, which contain
reflex areas located on the hands and feet. The reflex areas on the hands and
feet are essentially holograms of the whole body; therefore, stimulating the
hands and feet affects the whole body. By applying pressure to specific reflex
points, you adjust the flow of energy and can create a positive response
(reduced pain) in a corresponding location elsewhere on the body.
Digging Deeper into Origins 
and Philosophy
Many healing arts, including acupressure and reflexology, are based on the
beliefs of Chinese energy medicine — which people first practiced more than
5,000 years ago. The ancient Chinese believed that spiritual imbalances
caused many illnesses and physical ailments. In order to effectively address
the pain, the Chinese believed, you needed to resolve your spiritual imbal-
ance and get your energies and life force in a balanced state. In other words,
the Chinese felt that you couldn’t properly treat physical pain unless you also
addressed your spiritual issues and any imbalances in your energy force. In
this section, we explain a bit more about where this belief started as well as a
bit about how acupressure and reflexology support that philosophy.
The origins of acupressure and reflexology
Acupressure and reflexology are no New Age “flash in the pan” trends. In fact,
they’ve actually been around for thousands of years. Their roots are believed
to trace back to the ancient people of Asia, who realized the many benefits of
strategic touch as part of a healing therapy routine. (In the case of reflexol-
ogy, some evidence indicates that ancient Egyptians also practiced this type
of healing therapy. Treating the body through the feet and hands has also
been found in many indigenous healing systems. For example, Native
Americans and Australian aborigines are both believed to have healing prac-
tices based on foot manipulation.)
11
Chapter 1: Acupressure and Reflexology Essentials

The ancient people of Asia discovered that pressing specific points on the
body can reduce or eliminate pain — often in locations elsewhere on the
body. Chinese doctors began focusing on pressure points as a way to treat
pain, fight illnesses, and encourage healing after injuries. These sessions, like
many others developed by the Chinese of the period, were often used to treat
soldiers who had been injured in various military conflicts.
Stone probes, found in Chinese tombs and believed to date back thousands
of years, are believed by experts to be the first tools used in acupuncture and
acupressure. These stones were called Bian stones and were used as tools to
apply pressure to acupoints.
Originally, in Asia, many schools of Chinese medicine passed down in family
lines. Most of these schools were similar to each other, but they also had lots
of little differences — such as the exact function, name, or location of a point,
how you use point combinations, and the use of extra points and extra chan-
nels of qi. After the Maoist revolution, General Mao combined all the teach-
ings into one, eliminating all the differences, and he called it Traditional
Chinese Medicine, or TCM. However, current practices still use acupuncture
and acupressure techniques that fall outside of TCM and don’t necessarily
use organ meridians or standard acupoints. Some examples are auricular
(ear) acupunture, which many practitioners use today to treat addictions,
and Korean hand acupuncture, which is similar to reflexology. The point?
These examples show the vast array of healing techniques available to practi-
tioners who use acupressure and reflexology therapies.
How and why they work
The foundation of Chinese energy medicine is the belief that a balanced and
positive energy force is imperative for good health and emotional well-being.
If you move or manipulate this energy to create a more balanced harmonious
state, they believed you could effectively treat pain and illness.
12
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology
Huang Di Nei Jing
One of the most well-known works related to
ancient Chinese medicine is the Huang Di Nei
Jing, which translates to The Medical Classic of
the Yellow Emperor. This book, believed to date
back to around 200 B.C., details the philosophy
and techniques of acupuncture and other forms
of medical treatment. In addition, it also covers
other important topics such as astronomy,
weather, and military operations.

As many people now acknowledge, the ancient Chinese healers were on to
something. Today, people know that the body is like a big puzzle, with each
part interconnected to other parts in many different (and sometimes mysteri-
ous) ways. In other words, you may say, “No man’s body part is an island.” A
problem that originates with one part of the body inevitably begins to have
repercussions on other parts of the body and mind.
Determining Preference: It’s Up to You
We use acupressure and reflexology together in this book because the effects
of one reinforce the effects of the other (see Chapter 3 for more detail). We
can’t give you a magic formula that tells you when using acupressure would
be more beneficial than using reflexology. Many times it’s a matter of prefer-
ence — maybe you want to have your whole body touched and like the full-
body approach of acupressure. Or maybe you have ticklish feet. Everyone is
a little different, and some people respond better to one type of session than
the other. Most people, however, enjoy both, and adding both to a session is
the ideal because you’re impacting more than one pathway and stimulating
more than one type of physiological effect.
You may notice more acceptance of acupressure than reflexology in the main-
stream. The reason? Acupressure has been studied more by Western medi-
cine. Although Russians have studied reflexology, it has largely been ignored
by medical researchers in the West. This fact is surprising because according
to the Pacific Institute of Reflexology, the founder of modern day reflexology,
Dr. William Fitzgerald, was a specialist in Boston City Hospital; the Central
London Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital in England; and the St. Francis Hospital
in Hartford. Unfortunately, until scientific research validates this approach,
reflexology won’t reach the same level of acceptance as acupressure.
Fundamental Principles of 
Acupressure and Reflexology
Learning basic acupressure and reflexology is much easier when you under-
stand the fundamental principles. Pressure point therapies don’t work with
your body as if it’s a machine; they work with your body as an energy system.
The energy involved is called qi (pronounced kee) or chi (pronounced chee).
Health and healing is dependent on the smooth and abundant flow of qi
throughout the body. Life events can challenge your energy system, disrupt-
ing the flow of qi and causing imbalance.
13
Chapter 1: Acupressure and Reflexology Essentials

Pressure point therapies seek to regain balance. Pressure is applied to spe-
cific points to regulate the flow of qi. As qi becomes more balanced, healing
processes are stimulated. In this section, we focus on how this works and
what forces are involved.
Your body as an energy system: 
An Eastern approach to healing
You probably know that models of healing in the West are significantly differ-
ent from those in the East. In the West, health practitioners see the body as a
machine. When the machine has a breakdown, medicine fixes the symptoms
and considers that health has been restored. The progression is linear, and
goes something like this:
1. You get sick.
2. You have symptoms.
3. You stop the symptoms.
4. You feel better.
Treatment is goal oriented, and the goal is to eliminate symptoms. Here’s an
example: You go to the doctor with heartburn. Using Western medicine, she
gives you an antacid or a drug to block the production of acid. With either
treatment your symptoms go away, and her job is done, even though the
cause of the problem may not be addressed.
In the East, health practitioners see the body as an energy system. The pro-
gression of illness goes something like this:
1. Your energy flow is disrupted.
2. You develop symptoms that show you where the energy imbalance is
located.
3. Treatment involves shifting the cause of the imbalance.
Treatment focuses on patterns and cycles of disease. Rather than being goal ori-
ented, Eastern medicine tries to understand what the symptoms mean. Here’s an
example in this model: You go to the doctor with heartburn, and he assesses the
balance and flow of your qi. He determines that the symptoms reveal too much
qi in your stomach. He uses pressure point therapies to stimulate the rebalanc-
ing of qi and to explore the underlying patterns that created the imbalance. Are
you working too much? Do you consistently burn the candle at both ends? Is this
overwork an attempt to feel more useful, more worthy of recognition? After you
understand your pattern, pressure point therapy can more effectively stimulate
qi. Why? Because your mind and emotions are no longer working against you.
Now that the pattern is shifted and your qi is balanced, you no longer need the
symptoms of heartburn to tell you that you’re out of balance.
14
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

In the Western model, the doctor does the healing. Your body heals, but the
doctor does it! In the Eastern view, you already have everything you need to
heal yourself. All body processes are geared toward self-healing. Pressure
point therapies help shift patterns to remove obstacles to balance.
Everything is based on timing. You can’t force someone else’s energy to
change, and you don’t know the best timing for change to happen. When
giving yourself or someone else a healing session, you’re facilitating change.
Whether or not that change happens is up to the wisdom of the body. Never
try to force results. Daylight can’t come until night is over.
The importance of qi
Unfortunately, we can’t give you an exact definition of qi. Trying to define it is
like trying to define consciousness or infinity. They aren’t easily and intu-
itively grasped, but they’re the foundations of higher principles. Essentially,
qi is life force, but Chinese texts describe it not only as a force, or energy, but
also as a substance. It’s a substance that acts through matter, binding mole-
cules together, organizing them into form, and holding form together. At the
same time, it’s a force that enlivens and activates the form it organizes.
Qi can be described as vital force that sustains all life. Have you heard the
expression “dead weight”? That’s a body without qi flow. Consider two bodies
with all their structures working properly: one is alive and one is dead. The
presence or absence of vital life force is the only difference between the two.
Every culture has a concept and name for life force. In China it’s chi; in Japan
it’s qi or ki; in India it’s prana; Polynesians call it mana; in Hebrew it’s rauch;
Islamic cultures call it barraka; and Native American and Australian tribes all
have different names as well. In modern times, people have referred to it as
biomagnetism, plasma, orgone, L-fields, and factor X.

Results-based payments for Chinese doctors
In ancient China, every village had a doctor. The
doctor’s job was to prevent illness and keep
everyone in the village healthy. Each month, the
doctor was paid for his services, but only if
everyone stayed healthy. If anyone got sick,
they considered the illness a failure on the
doctor’s part, and the doctor didn’t get paid —
now that’s preventive medicine! Today it’s up to
you to practice preventive medicine and stay
healthy — the doctor gets paid only when
people get sick. And one of the most effective
ways that you can keep yourself healthy (in
addition to maintaining healthy nutrition and
regular exercise, of course) is to use acupres-
sure and/or reflexology. The tools and tech-
niques in this book can go a long way toward
keeping your qi balanced, your body and mind
healthy, and your doctor bills low! Co-author
Synthia has been practicing them for years, so
trust her on this one.

Where does qi come from?
Qi is everywhere. It’s present within, between, and around everything that
exists. You can think of it as an ocean of qi that you’re swimming within (and
don’t forget, humans are 65 percent water — or in this case, qi!). You may
hear people call it universal life force or universal qi. Universal qi changes
form when it embodies matter and becomes an individualized life force. You
may not know it, but you were born with your own personalized qi that’s
yours for life. You may be asking yourself right now whether you were born
with enough qi to last you your entire life. The truth is that you spend qi
every day. Every activity you perform (including thinking!) uses qi. To live a
long and healthy life, you need an abundance of qi, so supplementing your
original qi is important.
Keeping your qi plentiful
You restock your qi in three different ways. The first way is to obtain qi from
the world around you through the air you breathe, through the food you eat,
and through natural elements like sunlight. The quality of qi you have to live
your life with depends on the quality of what you eat and the environment
you’re in. Take a minute to consider the quality of qi that’s becoming you. Is
it reflected in the quality of your health, thoughts, and emotions?
Another way you replenish your qi is to generate it internally. Many systems
have been developed to generate internal qi. Yoga, T’ai Chi, and Qi Kung are
three moving methods of generating internal energy. Pranic breathing and
mediation practices are two of the more sedentary approaches. Your ability
to generate internal qi is affected by your thoughts and emotions. Do the
thoughts you think give you more energy, or do they drain your energy? You
may want to try one of these practices to build your internal energy reserves.
Two good books to get you started are T’ai Chi For Dummies, by Therese
Iknoian, and Yoga For Dummies, by Georg Feuerstein and Larry Payne (both
published by Wiley).

Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology
The duality of light
The description of qi as both energy and matter
is very similar to the duality of light. Isaac
Newton described light as a particle and
designed experiments that proved it. His con-
temporary Christian Huygens described light as
a wave and designed experiments that proved
this, too. It took almost two centuries before
people began to accept that light is both a par-
ticle (matter) and a wave (energy), expressing
itself differently under different conditions.
Understanding the duality of light gave rise to
quantum physics. Were the ancient Chinese
aware of this duality centuries earlier?

A third way to supplement qi is through connection to universal qi. All the
methods that teach you how to generate internal energy ultimately help you
to connect with universal qi. As you become more and more attuned to uni-
versal qi, you can begin to fill directly from the source, keeping your own
supply vibrant and abundant.
What does qi do?
Talking about what qi does is easier than talking about what qi is. All your
cells need to be nourished and sustained with life force. Without life force,
your cells would be, well, lifeless! Life force organizes the development of
your body, animates you, and motivates you. Without qi, your body degener-
ates and decomposes; with a deficiency of qi, your life may lack meaning and
direction, and your body may lack vibrant health. Qi provides your body-mind
(a common term illustrating that the body and mind are so interconnected
that they really should be treated as one) with information, directing your
cells and psyche in fulfilling your own unique design. Not to be overlooked, qi
is also a connecting force, connecting your organs, teeth, and tissue to each
other; your mind to your body; and your spirit to your path. As it connects
you internally, it connects you externally, allowing you to feel attached to the
world you live in.
Accepting that qi codes and transmits information is often hard. However,
information is always transmitted on energy carrier waves. For example, you
access information encoded onto radio waves and microwaves every time
you turn on your radio or use your cellphone.
The bottom line? Qi keeps you healthy. When qi is flowing unrestricted
through your body, it harmonizes all organs and optimizes body functioning.
Have you ever experienced the hum of feeling on top of the world; feeling
vibrant, alive, and where you’re supposed to be in the universe? This is the
feeling of unrestricted, free-flowing, and balanced qi! Using pressure point
therapies can help you find this internal balance.
Meridians, acupoints, and reflex points as conductors of qi
Qi is organized in the body in channels called meridians. These channels dis-
tribute qi to every organ, tissue, and cell in your body. They start as large
channels and branch into smaller and smaller channels. You can think of it
like arteries becoming arterioles and then capillaries, delivering blood to the
cells. Another useful comparison is to think of them like streams or irrigation
channels. All supply vital nutrients that are needed for health. Meridians
have a higher conductivity than surrounding tissue.
Acupoints are points on the meridians that are closest to the surface of the
skin (although some are deeper, depending on where they’re located on the
body). They have an even higher conductivity to energy flow than the rest of
the meridian; this energy flow can be measured with micro-electrical voltage
meters attached to the skin. Consequently, acupoints are like little whirlpools
in a stream. Pressing these whirlpool points helps to regulate the flow of qi.
17
Chapter 1: Acupressure and Reflexology Essentials

Reflexology also works with life energy, but it doesn’t focus on the meridians
as transporters of qi. Pressing the reflex points on the feet and hands influ-
ences qi reflexively. You push a point on the feet that relates to an organ, and,
through a reflexive action, qi flow to the organ is increased or decreased as
needed. Although reflexology doesn’t focus on meridians, many meridians
start or end in the feet, which may be another reason why reflexology can be
so effective.
How qi imbalance affects health
So how do acupressure or reflex points get empty or full? Imbalance can
happen in several ways. Energy flow is impacted by injury, overuse, poor
nutrition, emotional trauma, pain, being in bad environments, stress, pollu-
tion, and toxic overload, to name a few. When imbalance happens, energy
accumulates in some areas and is depleted in other areas. Areas of accumula-
tion can become stagnant, like blood pooling in the extremities. Stagnant qi
loses its energetic quality and the ability to promote health. Areas of deple-
tion become isolated, losing access to healthy qi flow and losing connection
to the rest of the body.
Imbalance in the qi flow impacts your health in many ways. It can open the
door to the development of disease, it can give you muscle tension and pain,
or it can cause you to feel depression or anxiety. If you’ve had an imbalance
for a long time, you may experience loss of function or a lowered immune
system. Maybe you have a small or relatively new imbalance; in that case,
you probably feel just a little off or under the weather. Whether you have a
big imbalance or a little imbalance, you can support your health by regulat-
ing qi flow with pressure point therapies.
Emotions, the mind, and qi
Where you put your attention influences where your qi flows. Are you think-
ing all the time about how bad you feel or how tired you are? Guess what?
You’re instructing your qi to maintain the status quo! And you could be caus-
ing more qi to become obstructed or depleted. Instead, try generating some
internal qi, and then practice sending it to the areas in your body that need
it. How do you do that? By focusing your attention on areas that need help
and imagining life force flowing to those areas. If you have life force (and if
you’re reading this, you should!), it will follow your attention and support
your body in achieving better health.
The heart is considered the seat of Shen, or your spirit. When you’re in a
healthy state, your mind follows the mandates of your spirit, the heart of who
you are. Your emotions are your body’s way of translating the desires of the
heart. Every emotion is linked to a specific organ and has a defined function.
Some emotions calm the qi, and some emotions disrupt the qi. All emotions
are normal responses to life events and have value. However, if you get stuck
in a specific emotional pattern, your qi flow can be disrupted.
18
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

Do you find that you always react the same way? Maybe you feel irritable a
lot, or you say no to every question, or maybe you say yes to everything even
when you don’t want to. Maybe everything scares you so that you never want
to go places and do things. These situations are examples of being stuck in an
old emotional pattern that disturbs your flow of qi. You can read more about
emotions — and find some exercises to balance your emotional qi — in
Chapters 7 and 8. Every thought you think and every emotion you feel directs
your energy.
Yin and yang: Forces of health
The yin/yang symbol is the fundamental expression of Eastern medicine and
philosophy. You’ve probably already seen this symbol in many different
places (if you haven’t, check out Figure 1-1). It’s a circle divided in two; one
side is a swirl of black (yin) and the other side is a swirl of white (yang). The
black swirl contains a white dot, and the white swirl contains a black dot,
indicating that within each is the seed of the other. But what does this
symbol mean, and what does it have to do with pressure point therapy?
Yin and yang are the two opposing forces of the universe. Although they’re
opposites, they’re not unrelated; they’re different halves of the same whole
or different sides of the same coin. You can’t have one without the other. You
can’t have a mountain without a valley, or day without night, and you can’t
have yin without yang. All things are composed and contain both yin and
yang — matter, qi, and even emotions. When something contains more yin
than yang, it’s considered to be yin, and vice-versa — but never forget that
both aspects are still present in all things.
The qualities of yin are considered to be feminine, and the qualities of yang
are considered to be masculine (see the nearby sidebar “Qualities of yin and
yang” for more info). Yin and yang exist only in relation to each other; noth-
ing is yin or yang all by itself — it can be yin or yang only in relation to some-
thing else. For example: If yang is hot and yin is cold, then what’s warm — yin
or yang? If you’re comparing warm to cold, warm is yang. If you’re comparing
warm to hot, warm is yin. Warm by itself is neither or both.

Chapter 1: Acupressure and Reflexology Essentials

Health is the dynamic balance between yin and yang forces in the body.
Sometimes a person needs more yang energy. Remember the time you had to
stay up all night painting a new room? Without activating yang energy, you
wouldn’t have been able to do it. Sometimes a person needs more yin energy.
Remember how long it took to recover from staying up all night? Without nur-
turing yin energy, you wouldn’t have been able to recover! The ability to
respond to what’s needed in a situation is a keynote of good health.
When you’re using pressure point therapy, you determine your healing rou-
tine based on whether the points are yin or yang (empty or full). You can
determine that a point is yin or yang only in comparison with another point,
and we show you how in Chapter 4.
The Tao of change
Tao loosely translates as the way or the path. However, it doesn’t mean one
way or one path, but the way or the path of the individual. Other translations
are the origin of all things, the way of nature, and the ultimate reality. In the
yin/yang symbol, the Tao is represented by the circle, symbolizing all that is.
The Tao divides itself into two opposite expressions, yin and yang; the
dynamic tension between yin and yang creates qi, the energy and substance
of all that exists within the Tao.
Take a good look back at Figure 1-1. You may notice that as one swirl gets
bigger, the other gets smaller. In fact, when the yin side gets as big as it can, it
flips and becomes the yang side, which starts small and gets bigger and
bigger until it too flips and becomes the yin side. Yin and yang aren’t static.
They’re constantly moving, turning one into the other; night turns into day,
and winter turns into spring. Change is a constant in the universe. Staying the
same isn’t possible. Change, however, isn’t random — it happens when the
timing is right; morning only comes when night is finished. This notion is
important in the practice of acupressure.

Qualities of yin and yang
Yin and yang are each associated with specific
qualities. For example:
 Qualities of yin: Cold, dark, night, earth,
incubation, moon, rest, contraction, soft,
deficient, empty, matter, nurturing, calm
 Qualities of yang: Hot, light, day, heaven,
creation, sun, activity, expansion, hard,
excessive, full, energy, defensive, passionate

Health, like the Tao, is always changing. It’s a dynamic equilibrium between
the forces of yin and yang. If health was a static state, you wouldn’t be able to
respond to changing situations and environmental demands.
So, all these fundamentals are interesting, but do you need to know them to
perform pressure point therapies? Well, the answer is yes and no. You can
certainly give pressure point sessions knowing nothing about the dynamic
forces you’re working with, and you can even be effective. On the other hand,
understanding these principles will assist you in giving the most effective ses-
sions possible, assessing the needs of the person you’re working with, and
minimizing uncomfortable side effects.
Personalizing the Benefits and Cautions
Even if you have a good understanding of the basic principles of acupressure
and reflexology (if you don’t, just check out the earlier parts of this chapter),
you still may be thinking, “That’s all very interesting — but how can these
techniques help me personally?”
That answer varies depending on your specific situation and any health con-
cerns you have. But the general answer is that bodywork can help you in
many ways by improving your overall health and well-being and alleviating
pain while treating any illnesses or nagging injuries you may have. This, in
turn, will surely improve your emotional health and spiritual harmony.
What acupressure and reflexology 
can do for you
The following list looks at a few specific ways in which acupressure and
reflexology may be able to help you:
 Immune support: Bodywork therapies can have a major positive impact
on your immune system. The ancient Chinese believed that too much
(or too little) energy in a certain meridian or zone could cause undue
stress, which would weaken the immune system.
Although specific acupoints are often cited as being specific “immune
booster” targets, addressing any energy imbalances you may have will
certainly have a positive impact on the state of your immune system.
For maximum benefit to your immune system, use healing arts in con-
junction with related techniques, such as meditation and deep breath-
ing. In addition, avoid stress whenever possible.
21
Chapter 1: Acupressure and Reflexology Essentials

Also, using bodywork techniques to treat any specific condition you may
have — say, a cold or sinus infection — will alleviate the toll on your
immune system.
 Circulatory stimulation: One of the basic goals of bodywork techniques
is to stimulate the proper circulation of energy. But here’s a little secret:
blood flow follows energy. So, in essence, by opening pathways for
energy, you simultaneously stimulate blood to flow better.
Acupressure and reflexology are excellent ways to stimulate your circu-
latory system, which is essential to good health. Poor circulation can
cause all sorts of undesirable problems, from cramps and swelling
(especially in the legs and feet) to more serious conditions like blood
clots and strokes.
In addition, poor circulation makes it tougher for your body to heal
areas that have suffered a wound or other injury.
 Relieving aches, pains, and muscle strains: Bodywork is perhaps most
well-known (and most commonly employed) as an effective way to treat
aches and pains. Although any type of massage or muscle stimulation (if
done properly) can help alleviate aches and pains, the techniques used
in acupressure and reflexology can allow you to pinpoint the root of the
pain, thus treating it much more quickly and efficiently.
Plus, by using these techniques correctly, you can often treat pain in
several different parts of the body at once (or in rapid succession), thus
providing a healing option that can save you considerable time and
effort.
 Rehabilitation and support for injury recovery: Bodywork is also com-
monly used to help the body heal more quickly following an injury. By
encouraging the optimal flow of energy to the affected area (and stimu-
lating its corresponding acupoints), you can often speed up the healing
and recovery process. In addition, eliminating or reducing pain in that
area makes it much easier to perform physical therapy exercises or
other routines involved in the rehabilitation process.
 Optimal wellness and performance: It’s common knowledge that if you
feel better, you perform better. Performing at your best (in sports, work,
or anything else) is tough if you’re plagued by pain or struggling with
injuries.
Improving your energy flow not only helps the specific areas involved,
but also boosts your overall well-being and puts you in a more positive
frame of mind. This combination allows you to perform at your peak
level, while also sustaining proper energy flow necessary for endurance.
 Stress reduction: One of the most important benefits of acupressure and
reflexology is stress reduction. Restoring balance to the system reduces
muscle tension and promotes relaxation. When you begin to change the
patterns of imbalance, stress automatically reduces in your life.
22
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 Emotional growth and transformation: During a pressure point session,
you may experience deep relaxation. This type of relaxation allows you
to access deeper places within. Here you may find some of the patterns
that keep you from being fully satisfied in life. You may find that you’re
able to see things with a new perspective and that issues that have
always bothered you don’t anymore.
 Making you aware that your body is your temple: Universal qi is a
pretty special substance. You store it in your body, so increasing inter-
nal qi sort of makes your body a temple. When this increase of internal
qi happens, you may find that you develop a new appreciation for your
body, for being alive, and for the special and unique place you have on
this planet.
What injuries and ailments 
you need to avoid
Professionals are trained to work with different pathologies, but because
you’re just starting, stay away from pressure point therapy on the following
conditions:
 Varicose veins, especially deep or painful conditions
 Inflammation, a sign of injury — signs are redness, swelling, heat, and
dysfunction
 Severe swelling (edema)
 Fractures, sprains, strains, or surgery
 Contagious diseases
 Infections
 Contusions, bruises, or bleeding
 Herniated disk in the spine
 Severe neck trauma
 Deep emotional issues or trauma

Supplementing and Complementing
Acupressure and Reflexology
As you’ve probably realized by now, acupressure and reflexology can benefit
your health and well-being in many ways. And even if your healing plan con-
sists of these techniques alone, you’re bound to see a noticeable improve-
ment in the way you feel.
However, your results will be many times greater if you incorporate these
techniques into a comprehensive overall treatment and lifestyle plan. For
maximum benefit, you should supplement bodywork with other positive
strategies, such as meditation, yoga, stretching, deep breathing, and related
exercises. In addition, taking steps to reduce or eliminate stress will make a
big difference in your health, both physically and mentally. Naturally, you
should also practice other healthy-living habits — in other words, avoid
smoking, maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and get sufficient sleep.
All these healthy-living habits play an important role in how you feel and how
your body performs. By bringing all these pieces together into one big treat-
ment plan puzzle, you’ll be amazed at the positive differences you see in your
life.

Healing Yourself or a Loved One
In This Chapter
 Tracing the roots of your pain
 Preparing for a healing session
 Knowing what sensations to expect
 Following up after a session
C
hances are good that you’re eager to rush right into a healing session,
especially if you or a loved one is in pain right now. Your enthusiasm is
understandable, but you must be patient. Before you just dive right in and
practice these healing techniques, you need to spend a little time educating
yourself about the basics of the process.
Consider all the important aspects of the healing process: why pain happens,
what you can (and can’t) realistically do about it, and the risks you need to
keep in mind. Be prepared for the different sensations you may experience
during a healing session. This preparation helps you avoid any unexpected
(and possibly unwelcome) surprises.
The information in this chapter tells you how to become fully prepared
before the session so that you can achieve the best results and maximum
benefit.
Giving Yourself — or Others — 
a Healing Hand: The Basics
Anyone, at any time, can benefit from the techniques involved in bodywork.
These healing strategies — whether self-administered or given to another —
can relax and rejuvenate the body, and they’re almost guaranteed to make
you feel better, even if you’re not in pain. However, people with pain or dis-
comfort benefit the most from healing therapies. If you have aches, pains,
sore muscles, or virtually any other source of physical discomfort, you’re in

need of a healing session. A weekend warrior still recovering from Saturday’s
football game? A healing session may be exactly what he needs. A busy mom
whose back and legs ache from chasing after kids all day? She, too, should
treat herself to a session, pronto.
Whether you plan to treat yourself or others, you just need to know the fun-
damentals of the healing arts. By simply brushing up on the basics of acu-
pressure and reflexology, you can accomplish amazing results. Before you
attempt to exert those powers on others, however, take care of the items on
this list:
 Do some basic research (which you’re doing right now by reading this
book). This research ensures that you know the essentials of conducting
a healing session.
 Make sure that the receiver is ready for the healing plan and able to
experience a session safely. In the case of illness or injury, this step may
involve consulting with a doctor before embarking on any healing plan.
The following sections explain what you need to know before deciding to
treat yourself or someone else.
Benefits and drawbacks
You can find many benefits of participating in acupressure and reflexology.
First and foremost, you probably feel better (possibly a lot better) after just
the first session. Many people are pleasantly surprised at the noticeable
improvement after their session.
Another benefit, if you perform a healing plan on yourself, is that you become
much more in tune with your own body and the effect that healing sessions can
have on it. This benefit gives you a boost of confidence in your power over
pain and your ability to heal yourself or others. You may be amazed at the new
revelations you discover about the connection between pain and its source(s).
You may begin to see your body in an entirely new and fascinating way.
Healing sessions have few (if any) drawbacks if they’re conducted properly.
Obviously, you should use care and exert only enough pressure to perform
the techniques without causing discomfort. Make sure that you’re not using
these techniques as a substitute for medical care and treatment. Serious ill-
nesses and injuries need to be addressed by a doctor. Healing therapy should
be applied in conjunction with a medical treatment plan, not in place of it.
26
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

When and where to get or 
provide a healing session
One of the best things about acupressure and reflexology is that you can use
them virtually anywhere at anytime. You don’t need elaborate, time-consuming
preparations or a lot of expensive, bulky equipment. If you’re treating your-
self, all you really need is a peaceful space and your own two hands (a few
tools may help, too; see the next section for suggestions). If you’re treating
someone else, you still need only your hands and a quiet moment. Of course,
the ideal is to have a clean, quiet, comfortable space with no interruptions,
but you can certainly help ease a headache by pressing points even when sit-
ting on a busy bus. So don’t hold back; use acupressure and reflexology when
you need them!
When to start? The sooner, the better — especially if you’re suffering from
any kind of pain or discomfort. For best results, plan your acupressure and
reflexology sessions for a time when you can concentrate without distrac-
tions. The exact timing often depends on your personality and preferences.
Just as some people are night owls who like to conduct important tasks in
the wee hours of the night, most people find that they most enjoy sessions at
certain times of the day. Many people like to schedule their sessions for right
before bed so that they can take advantage of the relaxing nature of these
healing sessions. Others find the sessions invigorating, and thus view them
as the perfect way to start the day.
The frequency of sessions may also vary depending on your preferences. You
may experience a bit of soreness or sensitivity following an intense session. If
so, you may want to wait a day or two before your next session. On the other
hand, some people treat themselves to numerous mini-sessions several times
throughout the day, and this practice isn’t unusual. The important thing is to
let your body be your guide and do whatever feels best for you.
Reaching those difficult places
If you’re treating yourself, you can easily reach all the reflexology points and
many of the acupressure points; however, some of the acupressure points
require a bit of twisting and stretching; and still others may not be reachable
at all! You may wish that you needed acupressure only on the easy points,
but most people want to reach the points on the back the most. That’s when
a few tools can come in handy. Here are a couple of suggestions:
27
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One

 Two tennis balls and a sock: The easiest and perhaps best tool you can
ever have is simply made up of two tennis balls and a sock. Put the
tennis balls in the sock all the way to the toe, and then tie the end of the
sock so that the balls are held tightly together. Voilà — an acupressure
tool! Simply place this tool of advanced technology between your back
and the floor when lying down, or lean against a wall with the sock
between your back and the wall (this technique works well when you
want less pressure than your full body weight). Experiment by moving,
rolling, and pressing to create the pressure you want on the areas you
most need.
 Professional acupressure tools for the back: The best type of tool
we’ve found for back acupressure points is anything with a knob ending
on a curved or S-shaped rod. You can position the curve around your
body or over your shoulder to place the knob exactly where you need it.
A little leverage is all you need for just the right amount of pressure to
feel the ahh of relief.
Of course, feet are pretty easy to reach — you probably need tools only if
your thumbs get sore (this applies to both acupressure and reflexology). In
that case, you may want to try any of the hand-held acupressure tools with
knobby ends. They allow you to apply pressure but still give your thumbs a
break. General stimulation on your feet is also good, and you can buy lots of
rollers and massage mats for pressure point stimulation of the feet.
You can easily find acupressure tools on the Internet — simply perform a
search, using Massage Tools or Acupressure Tools as your keywords.
Pain as part of healing
The body has an interesting response to injury. Have you ever had a sprained
ankle? As soon as the ankle swells with inflammation and pain starts, the
muscles all around the injury tighten up. This tightening is called muscle
splinting, and it’s the body’s effort to immobilize the injury to prevent more
damage. Sometimes the body forgets to relax the muscles and unsplint the
area after the injury starts to get better. Unfortunately, this tends to stop the
healing process, leaving weakened tissue, trigger points, and energy blocks in
the meridians.
Healing techniques can restart the healing process by shifting the energy
block and bringing energy into the area. When energy flows, circulation fol-
lows. Before you know it, the muscles are relaxing and the old injury is
waking up! Although it may feel bad, this is a great sign that healing
processes are underway and pain-free function is around the corner.
28
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

The presence of pain — when no underlying injury is being aggravated and
the receiver is in a comfortable position — gives good information about the
health and energy flow (or lack thereof) in an area. If everything is physically
okay, the pain may be the effects of increased qi (see Chapter 1 for more on
qi) into a blocked area. Pain during a session usually decreases as the
blocked energy begins to move, and you can continue working as long as the
pain isn’t excessive.
If the person you’re treating feels increased pain, has an emotional release, or
feels uncomfortable in some way during the session, use this information to
direct the session and be more effective. Ask whether she wants less pres-
sure or whether she wants to stop the session, but don’t assume that she
wants to stop or that what’s happening is bad. Stay calm and centered and let
the energy do its job. By staying calm and centered, you can allow healing
space where your receiver can explore the blocks in his or her energy flow
and maybe even shift them permanently. (See the later section “Achieving
presence” for more on staying calm and centered.)
Good pain is the pain of healing. Bad pain is the pain of injury. Telling the dif-
ference can be difficult. Usually, good pain has an element of relief to it, and
even though you feel sore, it hurts in good way. Good pain usually likes pres-
sure and touch, doesn’t last long, and gets better each day. Bad pain feels like
damage is occurring. It may be red, hot, and angry feeling. It doesn’t want to
be touched and may get worse before it gets better.
29
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One
Setting reachable goals and expectations
Although ancient healing arts like reflexology
and acupressure can have an air of mystery
about them, they aren’t magic and can’t perform
miracles. Keep your expectations realistic; other-
wise, you may find yourself disappointed and
tempted to give up before you make any real
progress. Although you’re likely to feel some
level of relief almost immediately, using acu-
pressure and reflexology is often a gradual
process, and it can take a while to reach a point
where your pain is really “conquered.” This
scenario is especially true in the case of
chronic pain. After all, chronic pain didn’t show
up overnight, and expecting it to go away that
quickly is unrealistic.
Granted, some people do experience amazingly
quick relief following these healing sessions.
Counting on that, however, is setting your
expectations too high. Hope for just a moderate
improvement, and then you can be pleasantly
surprised if the results exceed your expectations.
So, what are reasonable goals and expecta-
tions? Simply put, your main goal for yourself or
your receiver should be to feel increasingly
better (even if only a little bit) after each session.
More exact goals depend upon specific pains
or concerns. For example, if the pain in your legs
makes sleeping difficult for you, one of your pri-
mary goals may be to get an uninterrupted night
of sleep. A short-term goal may be to wake up
less often and get more restful sleep than you
were. Note: You may also notice that you’re
sleeping better because of the relaxing proper-
ties of bodywork.

Preparing Yourself to Give 
a Healing Session
Before you begin a healing session on yourself or someone else, spend some
time preparing for it. You want to focus on locating the source of pain and
then coming up with a healing plan and goal. Develop your presence by taking
a few minutes to ground and center. Also, because this activity is physical,
trying some of the stretches in the section “Staying fit” can help you become
physically prepared for your session. Finally, pressure point therapy requires
contact between you and your receiver. Be sure your fingernails are short
and be aware of cleanliness.
Being prepared for the session means preparing your space, too. Having
ready everything you require for the session is the last preparation you need.
Be sure to have pillows or supports, maps and charts, music, and the healing
plan you intend to use easily available.
Achieving presence
Have you ever used phrases such as “She was so scattered,” or “He was all
over the place”? These phrases describe people who are distracted and unfo-
cused. Maybe they have too much on their minds, or maybe they’ve just
received bad news. Although most people feel this way at one time or
another, can you imagine giving a session feeling this way? Your session
would be ineffective, and chances are good that you could hurt someone.
When giving someone a session, you must be fully present, focused on the
person, and paying attention to the flow of the session. The quality of your
attention is called presence, and your presence is the most important tool
you have. Presence is what you project — the vibe you carry that people
respond to.
Developing presence requires you to be grounded and centered. This con-
cept sounds pretty esoteric, but it’s really simple. Where you put your atten-
tion is where your energy flows. If your attention is scattered, your energy is
scattered. If you want to be grounded, put your attention into the earth and
your energy will follow. When you’re grounded, you can easily stay balanced
and relaxed no matter what you’re doing or what’s happening around you.
Maybe you’re having a hard time making a decision, and your mind is flitting
from one idea to the next, leaving you feeling uncentered. The solution? Bring
your attention inward to the center of your body, to the area just below your
belly button. This area is called the hara (in Japanese) or Dan Tien (in
Chinese) and is the center of gravity in your physical body (we stick with the
former in this book). When you bring your attention to your hara, your
30
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

energy follows and you become more centered. Sound simple? It is! Being
centered and grounded keeps you on track, and when you’re on track, you
make good decisions and give an effective session. It keeps you from getting
over-involved and drained.
The language used in the fields of acupuncture and acupressure, two very
similar healing arts, can be a bit confusing because acupuncture was devel-
oped in China, but acupressure was developed in Japan. So, acupuncture and
acupressure terms aren’t always in the same language! You don’t need to
know this info for this book, but if you deepen your study of acupressure, you
should be aware that these nuances in language do exist.
Using a grounding exercise
The best way to become more grounded is to use your breath and your mind
to direct your attention. As you breathe in, imagine your breath bringing
energy into your body through the top of your head. Breathe this energy in
and through your body. As you breathe out, imagine sending this energy out
of your feet, deep into the earth, sending roots into the ground. In just a few
short minutes you can enjoy the benefits of being grounded, which include
greater focus and balance.
Homing in on a centering exercise
You can use your breath and mind to become more centered. Start by putting
your right hand over your hara (the center of gravity in your physical body;
it’s under your belly button) and your left hand over your heart. As you
breathe in, imagine your skin collecting light and pulling it in through all
areas of your body. Imagine breathing this light through the center of your
body and into your hara. With every breath in, let your energy build in your
hara, moving up into your heart as well; with every breath out, release ten-
sion. You soon feel the clear, calming effects of being centered.
The hara is located one palm width down from your belly button and halfway
between the front and back of your body. It’s the biomechanical center of
your body and the place where you store your excess qi. You can find more
exercises on accessing your hara in Chapter 3.
Breathing into your belly (Hara breathing)
Expand your belly as you breathe in deeply and slowly, pulling air all the way
down into the bottom of your abdomen. As you exhale, contract your abdom-
inal muscles to push all the air out. Continue this breathing pattern five or six
times with full and deep inhalations and complete exhalations. This tech-
nique helps build your energy as you ground and center.

Staying fit
Physical fitness is an important part of overall well-being, both for your body
and your soul. If you’re in good physical health, you feel better in every way
and tend to have a more positive outlook on life.
Whole-body fitness is also important because it specifically relates to per-
forming bodywork. If you’re not in good physical shape, these techniques can
quickly become tiring and may cause you to experience soreness and muscle
aches.
Taking care of hands, arms, and shoulders
When you perform bodywork, your upper body (mainly your hands, arms,
and shoulders) does the bulk of the work. Therefore, you should try to make
sure those areas of your body are in the best possible shape so that you can
perform these techniques as well as possible.
Your hands are your most important tool in acupressure and reflexology.
Using them correctly ensures a long career in the healing arts. Using them
incorrectly not only shortens your use in bodywork, but also affects all the
other activities you use your hands for. Here are some tips for using your
hands wisely:
 Never use more pressure than is needed to release the point. At first,
knowing how much pressure to use is hard to pin down. With practice,
you can feel things more clearly. When you’re working points, ask your-
self, “Can I maintain this amount of pressure using less muscle
strength?” When starting out, practitioners of acupressure and reflexol-
ogy commonly use more muscles to perform an action than are actually
required. This is called co-contraction and can set you up for future
injury.
Muscles that perform opposing actions are arranged opposite each
other across a joint. For example, the muscles to straighten your knee
cross the front of your knee joint, and the muscles that bend the knee
cross the back of your knee joint. The same is true for the elbow, wrist,
fingers, and all joints. Usually when one set of muscles contracts, the
opposite set of muscles relaxes to allow the joint to move; if both sets of
muscles contract (co-contraction), the joint can’t move without a lot of
effort to overcome the opposition. When applying pressure, new practi-
tioners often co-contract, using way more muscle than they need!
 Whenever possible, use reinforced fingers. Using reinforced fingers
means using more than one finger to apply pressure. If you’re using your
index finger to press the point, put your middle finger of the same hand
behind your index finger to support your index finger.
32
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 Switch it up. You’re taught to apply pressure using lots of different parts
of your hand and body, such as the knuckles, heel of the hand, elbows,
and even knees. Switch the part you’re using often to avoid overusing
any one area.
 Stretch your hands and wrists before, after, and during your sessions.
 If you have pain in your wrist or fingers after a session, you can ice
them to decrease inflammation. However, consider this pain a signal
that you’re using too much pressure in your sessions, or you’re using
your thumbs incorrectly. It’s good to follow ice with gentle stretching to
bring circulation and qi back into the joints. It’s worth noting, though,
that traditional Chinese medicine avoids the use of ice because it can
cause stagnant qi, so be sure to keep the qi flowing with movement.
A good way to ice your hands or any hurting part is to put ice cubes in a
plastic baggie until it’s about one-third full. Add water to the level of the
cubes. Squeeze out any air and close the bag. Wrap the bag in a wet,
warm, thin towel and apply it to your hurting area. The warm towel will
get cold, and you will go through four stages of sensation. First you will
feel cold, then burning, then aching, then numbness. Keep the ice on
until you feel numb or no longer than 20 minutes. This reduces inflam-
mation, decreases pain, and stops spasms in muscles.
 Stop when you’re tired. Consider acupressure or reflexology a sport
and know that it takes time to strengthen your muscles for a new task.
 Take a cue from professional massage therapists and use some of the
specially designed massage tools available from a variety of retail
stores and online retailers. Both www.massagewarehouse.com and
www.gaiam.com are good Web sites for purchasing tools and supplies.
Stretching the hands and arms
Taking care of your hands and arms is an essential part of giving a good ses-
sion of acupressure and reflexology. This section gives you four easy
stretches to do before you start.
This first exercise stretches your tricep and posterior deltoid muscles, both
important in providing power to your work:
1. Raise one arm over your head.
2. Bend the elbow of the arm over your head so that your hand falls
toward your shoulder blades.
3. With your other hand, grasp your elbow and gently pull backward
until you have a good, but comfortable, stretch.
4. Hold for 20 seconds.
5. Repeat on the other side.
33
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One

This exercise stretches your upper back, shoulder, and posterior arm mus-
cles, keeping you from getting all bound up when working:
1. Cross one arm over your chest.
2. With the other hand, grasp the elbow of your crossed arm and gently
pull that arm farther across your chest.
3. Hold for 20 seconds.
4. Repeat on the other side.
This exercise is very important in keeping the wrist flexible, allowing qi to
flow freely into your hands:
1. Place your palms together in front of your chest in prayer position.
2. If you comfortably can, gently raise your elbows toward the ceiling
while keeping your palms connected.
Stop if you feel any pain in your wrists.
3. Hold for 20 seconds.
The final exercise for your hands and arms is the reverse of the exercise
above; stretching the opposing muscles and keeping qi flowing smoothly:
1. Place the backs of your hands together with your fingers pointing
down.
2. Gently lower your elbows as far as you can.
3. Hold for 20 seconds.
Benefiting from whole body stretching
You may also benefit from doing stretches that help increase the flexibility of
your entire body. Following are some examples of basic simple stretches you
may want to try.
This exercise stretches your back muscles:
1. Lie on your back.
2. Bring your knees to your chest.
3. Hold your calves with your hands.
4. Hold for a moment, release, and repeat.
If you want to stretch your legs, try this exercise:
1. Stand upright with your feet wide apart.

Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

2. Shift your body weight to one side.
Keeping your hands on your hips can help maintain balance.
3. Bend from the waist to one side as far as you can without causing 
discomfort.
4. Reverse sides to stretch the other leg.
If you’re looking for another leg stretch, give this one a try:
1. Sit on the floor with your knees apart and your feet pressed together,
soles touching, in the “butterfly” position.
2. Lean forward gradually, and you should feel a stretch in your upper
thighs.
3. Stretch as far as you can comfortably, and hold for a few seconds.
Having supplies on hand
One of the best things about acupressure and reflexology is that you don’t
need a lot of supplies and equipment, unless you decide to be trained as a
professional. You need just your receiver, yourself, and a few items for com-
fort. This list outlines what you need to know about those supplies:
 Your hands and body: Your hands are your primary tools for giving
bodywork sessions, but you may also sometimes use your knees and
feet. Use whatever works to give the amount of pressure you want. The
tools you use for self-healing can be great for saving your hands when
working on others, too (see the earlier section “Reaching those difficult
places” for more info on these tools).

Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One
Keeping it clean
We want to take a moment to stress the impor-
tance of good hygiene. Please don’t get
offended — we’re not implying that you’re
unclean. However, when you’re in close contact
with another person (and you are when you’re
performing acupressure or reflexology on
someone else), hygiene becomes much more
important than it is in normal social situations.
Wash your hands often to reduce the possibility
of spreading colds or other illnesses.
Remember that bodywork involves using your
hands to treat yourself or someone else.
Obviously, this can be tricky (not to mention
painful) if you have long, dagger-like fingernails.
If you plan to perform bodywork, keep your nails
neatly trimmed and at a reasonably short length.

 Mats, towels, blankets, and pillows: You need a place for your receiver
to comfortably lie down. The best place to give an acupressure session
is on the ground, using a soft and comfortable mat or pad. Massage
tables are great, but you can adapt your session to almost anything. You
can give acupressure on a bed, couch, or even sitting in a chair if neces-
sary. The best place to give a reflexology session is sitting in a chair, but
you can also give a great session with the person lying down on a mas-
sage table or bed. Wherever you decide to give the session, be sure you
have a clean set of sheets for your receiver to lie on.
After the receiver is lying or sitting, make sure he’s well supported and
comfortable. Use rolled-up towels, pillows, or bolsters under his knees,
ankles, or abdomen. Keep extra on hand in case you need to support his
shoulders and neck, too.
 Maps and charts: You need maps and charts for a healing session.
Chapter 3 walks you through the charts by explaining how they work,
what they mean, and how to use them. When you’re ready for your ses-
sion, have your charts on hand to read from and guide your session.
Don’t worry about where to put them in a session; you can even rest
them on your receiver’s body while you work.
 Candles, scents, and music: Although you don’t technically need these
items, many people like to set a relaxing atmosphere for the session by
arranging some candles nearby. This arrangement can provide a sooth-
ing, warm setting. Calming scents, such as vanilla, can also help. In addi-
tion, some relaxing music can help put both the giver and the receiver in
a calm mood. However, you should always consider the receiver’s feel-
ings. If he or she prefers not to have any of these elements, remove them
without making a fuss.
For optimum benefit, conduct sessions in a quiet area (with the exception of
any soothing background music you may choose). Relaxing is tough with lots
of loud conversations and other noise nearby. Warmth and ventilation are
also important. Achieving the proper balance of warmth and ventilation is
tricky when you’re establishing the perfect healing session atmosphere. You
want the receiver to feel warm (which also helps her to feel relaxed and
cozy), but the room should be well ventilated to allow for enough fresh air.
You may want to keep a small heater on hand in case any breezes or air con-
ditioners create a chill.
Preparing Yourself to Receive 
a Healing Session
You may be surprised to discover that you need to prepare yourself to
receive a session. After all, you may think that the receiver has the easy part.
What’s the big deal? You lie down and enjoy! Actually you may need a little
more preparation than that. Here are a few tips:
36
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 Don’t receive a session with a full stomach. Wait an hour after eating
before receiving any sort of healing session.
 Try to be relaxed and receptive right from the start. Check your cares
and concerns at the door: Don’t worry, they’ll still be there when you’re
done, and you can pick them up on your way out — if you still want
them, of course.
 If you wear contact lenses, be sure to tell the person giving the ses-
sion. He or she will want to avoid any pressure around the eyes.
 If you wear a hearing aid, turn it off so that it doesn’t squeal during
the session. Tell your practitioner that you don’t hear well, so that he or
she knows to speak up when giving you instructions.
 Because acupressure involves stretching, wear loose and comfortable
clothing with no tight waistbands or belts. Also, remove your jewelry,
watch, glasses, and other accessories, which can get in the way during
the session and also may effect the movement of qi. Although reflexol-
ogy doesn’t have as much movement as acupressure, you’ll still want to
wear loose clothing for comfort.
The art of being touched
Do you love or hate being touched? You may be a sponge who can’t get
enough, or you may find touch invasive. Maybe you aren’t too happy with
your body image, or maybe you have a lot of pain and just don’t want to be
touched. The truth is that humans are meant to be touched. Infants who
aren’t touched die. Touch improves well-being and contentment, calms the
nervous system, balances regulatory systems, and connects you to the world
you live in. However, receiving touch can be a little intimidating, especially
with someone you don’t know too well or with someone you know very well
but not in the capacity of giving and receiving touch. The great thing about
acupressure and reflexology is that they provide touch in a safe, gentle, and
health-promoting manner.
Here are a few tips for the art of receiving touch during healing sessions:
 Be sure that you’re comfortable. Don’t be afraid to speak up if you’re
cold, the position is uncomfortable, the light is too bright, the room is
too stuffy, the scents are too strong, or whatever. This is your session,
and being comfortable helps you receive.
 Take the time to get to know your acupressurist or reflexologist. Even
if you’re good friends, a healing plan is a new way of being friends and
deserves recognition. Talk about any concerns you have, how silly you
feel, and what you hope to experience. And then ask your practitioner
the same questions. Don’t let an unasked question keep you from relax-
ing during your session.
37
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One

 Tell your practitioner about the areas where you want special atten-
tion and the areas you really don’t want touched (or areas that
shouldn’t be touched because of an injury). You have the final say over
what happens to your body in a session.
 Let yourself relax and enjoy the session — you deserve a little atten-
tion, so let yourself receive it!
Letting your joints be moved
During the course of the session, the practitioner moves your arms and legs
to stretch different muscles or to get a better angle for specific points. Don’t
help! Your job is to relax; every time you help, you actually get in the way.
Relaxing and letting someone else move your limbs can be difficult, but 
with practice, it gets easier. The instinct to help isn’t surprising. You were
probably a baby the last time someone moved you around. You’ve worked
hard since then to gain control of your limbs, and giving up that control 
doesn’t come easily. But the more control you have, the less you can relax,
and relaxation has lots of benefits. Learning to let go of control in a session
may help you let go of overcontrolling other parts of your life as well. In any
case, what do you have to lose? Just a little control.
Receiving pressure
Some of the points that get worked in a session are tender. A practitioner
may apply pressure gently and carefully, but that pressure can still feel a little
threatening. Always tell the person working on you if the amount of pressure
is hurting you. Most of the time, the pressure feels good, but you can still find
yourself tightening up and resisting it. This instinct is usually protective; your
body is afraid that the pressure may suddenly be too much, so it tightens to
protect itself from injury. The best way to receive pressure is to relax and allow
the pressure in. This relaxation permits the person working on you to use less
pressure with more result. Check out these tricks for allowing pressure:
 Talk to your muscles, instructing them to relax.
 Your mind is powerful: Imagine your muscles getting longer and softer.
 Visualize tension leaving your body as the pressure comes in.
 Breathe! Your breath is the best tool you have for relaxation. When a
tender area receives pressure, the natural response is to try to push it
out. Instead, try the following exercise:
• As pressure increases into a tender area, use your breath and mind
to release the pressure and the pain.
38
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

• As you breathe in, imagine your breath going to the area of pres-
sure. Imagine you’re breathing in a calming, healing light. Maybe
this light has a color — one that you find calming. As you breathe
in, draw this calming, healing color with your breath into the area
that’s receiving pressure.
• As you breathe out, release your tension and pain, and let the
breath carry them out of your body. Maybe your tension has a
color. Imagine your exhalation is this color as you release all ten-
sion and pain.
Experiencing Qi Flow
Acupressure and reflexology both work by moving and balancing qi (flip to
Chapter 1 for an introduction to qi). You can sense and feel the movement of
qi in your body. Most people, however, don’t pay attention to the subtle
changes they feel that indicate energy is moving. Because science can’t mea-
sure qi yet, some people have a hard time believing that qi really exists. After
you receive some bodywork, you’ll most likely find that you do notice the
sensations associated with moving qi — and you’ll certainly feel the benefits.
Feeling qi may be unusual for you, and you may wonder whether what you
feel is real. No, you’re not crazy; you really can feel this stuff! Knowing what
other people feel may help reassure you that your experience is normal.
Acupressure and reflexology are natural healing techniques that have been
practiced by people for centuries. They’re perfectly safe when performed
correctly and with care. Obviously, if the receiver is in pain or has an existing
injury, proceeding with caution is important. Start out slowly and gingerly,
gradually increasing the pressure while making sure the receiver has no dis-
comfort. If the receiver experiences any additional pain or discomfort, stop
the session immediately until a doctor is consulted and gives the okay for the
receiver to continue with the sessions.
What you may feel when 
receiving a session
Receiving acupressure and reflexology is relaxing and fun, whether you’re
giving to yourself or receiving from another. These healing sessions can
relieve muscle aches and pains, but — be prepared — pressure points can be
sore, too!
39
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One

In the following sections are some common sensations people have when
receiving a session, but don’t expect anything. You may feel all these sensa-
tions, some of them, or none of them, and that’s okay — bodywork is good
for you regardless of what you feel or don’t feel.
Common sensations of moving qi
Everyone experiences the movement of qi differently. Here are some common
sensations you may expect:
 Tenderness is one of the primary sensations you may feel when receiv-
ing acupressure or reflexology. The tenderness usually goes away when
the point releases, because the release allows greater flow of qi and pro-
motes greater balance.
 You may feel warmth (or cold) spreading through your body.
 You may have the sensation of an electric current.
 Most people experience a change in consciousness, in which they’re
both deeply relaxed and highly alert at the same time. This is typical of
alpha and theta brain wave states and is considered one of the most
important benefits of bodywork. (See the nearby sidebar “It’s electric!”
for more on brain wave states.)
 One of the most common physical sensations people experience during
a session is “the jolt.” No one can really explain why this sensation hap-
pens, although you can find many theories (see the nearby sidebar for a
prominent theory on this effect). The jolt can happen at any point
during a session and usually goes something like this: The receiver is
feeling deeply relaxed with calming warmth spreading throughout her
body. Suddenly, out of nowhere, she experiences a body jolt. The jolt
may cause an arm or leg to move suddenly or may cause the whole body
to jump. Having a jolt generally indicates that energy is moving through
a blocked area. Although startling at first, you may notice that it’s also
oddly relaxing.
40
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology
The jolt
In order for a muscle to move, it must receive an
electrical/chemical signal from the nervous
system. A signal has to obtain a specific ampli-
tude, or strength, to jump-start the circuit. This
is called an action potential. Nerve synapses
accumulate signals until they reach a high
enough amplitude to become an action poten-
tial and initiate movement. Muscles can have
signals in the nerve synapses that are just under
the amount needed to start an action potential.
This is called sub-threshold stimuli. Some
people think releasing acupoints provides
enough additional stimuli to push sub-threshold
synapses into an action potential, creating a jolt
in the body. After the nerve synapse releases, it
can go back to normal, thereby helping to rebal-
ance the nervous system.

 In addition to physical sensations, you may feel deep emotions. These
emotions may have been locked up in your body for some time, becom-
ing part of the energy imbalance. Feeling deeply emotional is normal,
and it’s a sign that the session is stimulating strong healing impulses
that help to rebalance energy.
The signs of emotional release in a session are crying, shaking, trem-
bling, sighing, yawning, and sweating. Experiencing any of these things
during a session is normal. Each sign results in the receiver feeling emo-
tionally more balanced, free, and lighter afterward.
Relaxation
The most universal effect of acupuncture and reflexology is relaxation.
Relaxation has many benefits, including the following:
 Relaxation allows the body to metabolize and rebalance stress hor-
mones, which relieves stress.
 Relaxation lowers blood pressure.
 Relaxation reduces muscle tension.
 Relaxation promotes mental and emotional well-being.
 Relaxation frees the human mind for greater levels of creative thinking,
allowing people to see problems from a new perspective.
Sadly, many people don’t know how to relax or even what relaxation feels
like. If you’re one of these people, acupressure will work wonders!
41
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One
It’s electric!
Whenever nerves fire, they give off electricity.
In the brain, this activity is measured by an elec-
troencephalogram (EEG). The measurements of
an EEG are called brain waves. EEGs measure
the four main brain wave emissions — beta,
alpha, theta, and delta — and three additional
subtypes. Each is associated with a specific
range of frequency and type of brain function.
Beta brain waves are associated with normal
everyday activity; when someone is in beta
state, he’s awake. Most activities and thinking
processes occur during beta state. Alpha brain
waves are associated with deep relaxation and
alert mental function. The alpha state is often
associated with creativity and is useful for
stress management. Theta brain wave states
are associated with deep internal awareness,
dreaming, and deep states of meditation. Delta
brain waves are emitted primarily during sleep.

Press here, feel it there
If you’re like most people, you expect to feel pressure where someone is
pushing. Prepare for a surprise! When you push an acupoint, you’re sending
energy along the entire meridian. Look at the reflexology and meridian maps
in Chapter 3. See all the connections? Don’t be surprised when you push a
point in your shoulder and feel it in your feet. This is especially true in reflex-
ology, where each point is a reference to a body organ. You may think that
you’re just rubbing, rolling, and pressing your feet, but you can feel the effect
in every organ in your body.
What you may feel when giving a session
When giving an acupressure or reflexology session to another person, you
may have big expectations for yourself. You may expect to immediately be
able to feel energy. In time, most people can feel the qi moving through the
receiver’s meridians or collecting in the receiver’s acupoints, but you need
practice and patience. Try not to be disappointed if you don’t feel energy
immediately. Take heart: Giving a session can open your awareness to your
own energy flow, causing interesting sensations!
An electric current and other common sensations
When you hold two acupoints together, you may feel as if a current is running
through your hands and you’re connecting a circuit. Although this analogy is
useful, strictly speaking, it’s not what’s happening. Your energy isn’t flowing
into the recipient, and her energy isn’t flowing into you. What you’re feeling is
a process called induction.
The best way to explain this process is with a fluorescent light. Try this
experiment: Turn on a fluorescent light and hold another fluorescent light
bulb tube in your hand. Bring the light tube near the fluorescent light. You’ll
notice that the tube begins to emit light even though it isn’t connected to
electricity! This isn’t because electricity has jumped from one lighting tube to
the other. Rather, the light tube receiving electricity has started vibrating the
fluorescent ions inside the tube. When you bring the second fluorescent tube
within the vibrating field, the ions in the second tube begin to vibrate as well.
Vibration in one induces vibration in the other when their fields overlap.
The same is true in acupressure. When you feel the electric feeling of energy
moving, it isn’t someone else’s energy moving into you. It’s your energy
moving in response to the excitement of your energy field. This can work in
both directions, and people you’re working on may say things like: “Wow!
When you touch me I get an electric surge.” Remember that they’re feeling
their own surge sparked by your vibrating field of energy!
Here are some additional sensations you may experience as the giver of acu-
pressure or reflexology:
42
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 You may feel hot or cold throughout your whole body.
 You may have tingling in your hands.
 You may experience the same type of body jolt that the receiver does.
Basically, any sensation you have is normal. The body is simply interpreting
energy movement.
A connection with the recipient
When you’re giving a session, your body changes too! You may notice that as
your recipient relaxes, you relax; as your recipient’s brain wave states
change, your brain wave states change. This is called entrainment and hap-
pens when energy fields interact with each other.
Entrainment is a term physicists use to describe the effect that similar fre-
quencies with different rhythms have on each other. For example, when you
first put two grandfather clocks in the same room, they each have a similar
frequency (one beat per second), but their pendulums are usually swinging in
their own rhythms. When you leave them together, eventually they coordi-
nate so that the pendulums are swinging in sync with each other. They have
become entrained to each other. This happens to the body rhythms of
people, too, including brain wave states.
Usually during the course of a session, as the receiver’s energy becomes
calmer and flows more evenly, yours does too. This principle works in both
directions. If you find the receiver is wired and having trouble relaxing, relax
yourself and settle your own energy to help entrain the receiver and promote
greater relaxation.
Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques to support the qual-
ity of presence and effectiveness you bring to a session as the giver. Flip to
“Achieving presence,” earlier in this chapter, for more info.
43
Chapter 2: Healing Yourself or a Loved One
Does bad energy exist, and can I catch it?
Negative energy is one of the biggest miscon-
ceptions in energy medicine. Is there such a
thing as “bad” electricity? Qi is just a form of
energy; it’s neutral, providing life force to all
cells, tissues, and organs in the body. Because
qi is meant to move, obstructing its movement
creates negative effects. These effects can
include a lack of vitality, pain, emotional upset,
or any of the other effects we describe in
Chapter 1. Unblocking obstructions releases the
qi that’s being held back, and that relieves the
symptoms. So, relax, you can’t get what doesn’t
exist!

Your own imbalance, activated
You can’t catch someone else’s imbalance, but if you have a similar imbal-
ance, you can activate your own pattern by giving a healing session. In this
instance, the principles of induction and entrainment are working when we
wish they weren’t.
If after giving a session you find that you feel sick or tired or have the symp-
toms of the person you were working on, you’ve either activated your own
deep patterns of imbalance or you’ve become overly invested in the session.
How do you avoid this?
 Do your own work. The more aware you are of your own issues, the
better you are at giving a good session and the less likely it is that your
own imbalances become activated. However, if you find yourself going
downhill during a session, take a break. Do some deep breathing and
practice grounding and centering skills, which you can find in the sec-
tion “Achieving presence,” earlier in this chapter.
 Remember the principles of Chinese healing. Who’s doing the healing?
The receiver, not the giver! If you find yourself taking on the symptoms
of the receiver or feeling depleted after sessions, you’re overly invested
in the outcome. In effect, you’re trying to heal the person by taking his
symptoms away or giving him your energy. The best way to help some-
one heal is to stay neutral and let his body do what it needs to do. His
job is to do the healing; your job is to offer support.
After the Healing Session
Ideally, the overall healing strategy doesn’t stop the minute you stop per-
forming the techniques. For best results, follow up and follow through in the
post-session period.
One important part of the follow-up is gauging the receiver’s comfort level,
especially as it relates to her condition before a healing plan begins. Ideally,
she feels better than she did before. If so, and if she isn’t sore, she may wish
to have another session quickly.
Sometimes, she may feel more pain after a session. This increase in pain can
happen for a number of reasons. Maybe you used too much pressure or
worked too long in a given area. Ask your friend whether she felt that you
were too deep. If she says yes, you’ll know better next time. More likely, the
person is in more pain because the session woke up an old injury that had
never fully healed. You can’t heal what’s sleeping, so this is actually an oppor-
tunity for the healing process to begin.

The Terrain: Bones, Muscles,
Meridians, and Reflex Zones
In This Chapter
 Reviewing anatomical fundamentals
 Navigating the rivers of life
 Charting a path through a session
A
lthough the ability to heal comes naturally, you get the most out of the
experience if you brush up on some basic details first. This chapter
provides some advice on preparing for healing sessions. We review the basic
anatomical issues involved and give some important pointers on things you
need to know before you start practicing your healing plans. After reading this
chapter, you’re better prepared to get the most out of your healing sessions.
Handling Anatomy Fundamentals
If you read Chapter 1 or already know a thing or two about acupressure
and/or reflexology, you know that pressure point therapies are applied to
acupoints and reflex points located in meridians and reflex zones. These
points aren’t strictly anatomical, but finding them is easier when you know a
few key landmarks and just a little anatomy terminology. No worries, we
aren’t testing you!
The first things to remember are the functions of the various body parts.
Bones form the structure of the body. Movement is allowed to happen
because of joints between bones. Joint movement is smooth and gliding
because cartilage lines the ends of the joints. Tendons connect muscles to
bones, and ligaments hold joints together, connecting bones to bones. Most
of the acupoints and reflex points you use are located on muscles and ten-
dons, some are on bones, and only very few are on ligaments. Directions for
point location refer to nearby bones, or bony landmarks, even though the
points are most often located on muscles or tendons — for this reason, we
cover the bones first in this section.

On a few places on the body, you shouldn’t use deep pressure unless you
have advanced professional training. On these places, nerves, blood vessels,
or organs are close to the surface and are susceptible to injury. Here’s a list of
where to avoid deep pressure:
 Front of the neck: Pressure here can signal the body to raise or lower
blood pressure. You can also hurt the wind canal as well as different
glands.
 Armpit: Although acupoints are located here, you can also find impor-
tant nerves that can be damaged, so points here should be touched
lightly.
 Groin: Nerves, lymph nodes, and blood vessels are close to the surface.
Palm pressure (often called palmar pressure by healing arts profession-
als) is best to use here rather than finger pressure.
 Back of the knee: This is the popliteal fossa; nerves and blood supply to
the lower leg travel through here without muscular protection. There is
an important acupoint here that we use a lot. Be sure to use very light
pressure.
 Inside of the elbow: This is the cubital fossa; nerves and blood supply
to the lower arm travel through here without muscular protection. There
are several points in this area; when you use them, make sure the pres-
sure is light.
 Ankles: You absolutely must avoid using many of the acupoints in the
ankle region when practicing acupressure on pregnant women (or on
yourself if you’re pregnant). For more info on this endangerment site,
refer to Chapter 17.
Bones: Landmarks in the bodyscape
To locate bony landmarks, you need to look at the full body skeleton, front
and back. Figure 3-1 shows you the bones in the whole body. Most of the
point locations are referenced to bones and joints, simply because these
body parts are easy to identify by feel and are natural landmarks.
Take time to look at the full skeleton in Figure 3-1, and check out the corre-
sponding descriptions of each of the bones and joints in the following sec-
tions. Then try to find the landmarks first on yourself and then on as many
friends as you can. You may be surprised at how different the landmarks feel
on different body types.

Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

Although knowing the anatomically correct name for bones and muscles is
impressive, you can use just the common names if you aren’t an aspiring
anatomist. However, you’re most likely going to become so excited by the
results you get from doing this work that you’ll want to do more and more of
it. And you may even want to go to a professional training program, so you
may enjoy knowing some anatomical names, too. We label the diagrams with
common names and we put the anatomical names in parentheses in the
descriptions throughout this section.
Anklebones
You use many points around the ankle in acupressure. Reflexology also has
organ zones around the ankles, so finding the landmarks here is important.
The main landmarks to know in the ankle are
 The outer anklebone (external malleolus): This one’s easy: run your
hand down the outside of your leg until you reach your ankle. Feel the
pointy, sharp bone on the side of your ankle? That’s your outer anklebone.
 Outer leg bone (fibula): This bone runs from the outer ankle to the
knee. You just ran your hand along it when you located the outer ankle-
bone. This bone has acupoints all along it; press in front and behind this
bone from top to bottom and notice how many sore spots there are —
each sore area probably corresponds to an acupoint. Acupoints tend to
be sore when they’re full of stagnant qi. We discuss the concept of qi
flow in Chapter 4.
 Inner anklebone (internal malleolus): Another easy one. This bone is
opposite the outer anklebone. After you find it, use one hand to feel your
inner anklebone and your other hand to feel your outer anklebone; com-
pare them. Notice that the inner ankle is slightly higher and closer to
your toes than the outer anklebone.
 Shinbone (tibia): This bone runs along the front of your leg from the
knee to the ankle. It connects to the inner anklebone and ankle.
 Heel (calcaneous): The heel is the whole back of your foot. You can cup
it in the palm of your hand. The heel has both an inner and outer aspect
and both have pressure points on them.
 Navicular and cuneiform bones: Sorry, the navicular and cuneiform
bones don’t have common names, but together they form an important
landmark. It’s in the arch of your foot; run your hand along the arch of
your foot until you reach the highest point. Do you feel a very knobby
area? This is where the cuneiform and navicular bones meet. It’s more
on the side of the arch than the bottom, and it’s sometimes sore (as can
be the area near/underneath it) when you press it.
48
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 Metatarsal bones: Again, no common name, but the metatarsals are the
five foot bones that lead to the toes. Grasp your foot, and feel the long
bones between your toes and your anklebones. Many points run
between these bones, so feel the troughs between the bones; grasp two
bones that are next to each other and move them, pushing one down
while you pull the other up. Go back and forth, loosening the tendons
and fascia. Explore all these bones and the way they move.
Knee bones and joints
The knee is another hot spot for good points. The knee points can be hard to
locate, so spending time finding the landmarks is worthwhile, making it much
easier to find the points during your sessions. Knees are a common source of
pain and discomfort, so this is an area that you may want to focus consider-
able attention on. Important landmarks are
 Kneecap (patella): The kneecap sits right on top of the knee joint. It’s
not actually part of the knee joint but floats on top of it in the quadri-
ceps tendon. Straighten your leg and place your hand over the kneecap.
You can tell that it’s floating in the tendon because you can move it
around.
 Knee bump (tibial tuberosity): This bump, which is on the shinbone, is
just below the kneecap and sticks right out. It’s the place where the
quadriceps tendon attaches to the shinbone, connecting the quadriceps
muscle to the bone.
 Outer side of knee (fibular head): Feel the bones on the outside of the
knee. Wriggle your hand down the outside of the joint until you feel the
knob that sits at about the same level as the knee bump. This knob is
the head of the fibula bone. Press all along it.
 Inner side of knee (tibial head): Feel the bones on the inner side of the
knee. Explore all the bumps, nooks, and crannies where the shinbone
meets the femur, or the upper leg bone. Any sore spots? By now you
may be getting the idea that acupoints are often sore!
 Back of the knee (popliteal fossa): This isn’t an actual boney landmark,
but it’s a spot you should be aware of. The back of the knee has two ten-
dons from your hamstring muscles running on the inside and outside of
the joint. Right in the center is a soft boggy spot where blood vessels
and nerves run. Although good points are located here, never use deep
pressure, because you can hurt someone.
Hip, pelvic, and buttock bones
This area is a little sensitive for point location. Some of the points are in, well,
personal areas, although we avoid using any really personal points. Make
sure you show your receivers the locations of the points in these areas
before you get started. This way, they won’t be surprised and wonder what
the heck you’re doing. Landmarks for this area are
49
Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

 Hipbone (ASIS): The hipbone is the pointy bone on either side of your
lower stomach. Put your hands on your hips like you’re getting ready to
yell at someone, and your fingers fall right on the point of the hipbone.
 Top of the hipbone (iliac crest): One more time, place your hands on
your hips, fingers facing in any direction you want. The bones your
hands are resting on are the iliac crests.
 Hip joint (greater trochanter): Place the palm of one hand over your
hipbone, fingers pointing down. Lift your knee up and down. Feel that
ball moving under your fingertips on the side of your upper thigh?
That’s the hip joint. Explore it, pressing all around the contour while
moving your leg around.
 Pubic bone: This bone is the boney plate at the bottom of your
abdomen between your hipbones. To easily locate this area in a non-
invasive way, place the flat of your hand over the recipient’s belly
button, thumb toward her head. Press into her stomach, and start
moving your hand toward the pubic bone until you hit the boney plate
with your baby finger.
The pubic bone is one of the personal places your receiver may want
you to avoid using, but it does contain a couple of important points. Just
be sure that your receiver knows that you’re going to use these points
ahead of time and that you both feel comfortable. The way you
approach a point is often what makes it sensitive; be firm and definite.
Tentative touch makes people wonder what you’re thinking about.
 Sacrum: The sacrum is the upside down triangle at the bottom of your
spine. Place your hands on your hips with your fingers facing backward
and your thumb facing down. Your fingers reach the edge of your
sacrum. If you press around this area, you find a bump on both sides.
This bump is the sacroiliac joint. (Note the difference between the
sacrum and tailbone [coccyx] — your tailbone is located at the bottom
of your sacrum.)
Shoulder blades and vertebrae
The vertebrae are the individual bones of the spinal column. You have lots of
acupoints up and down the back, but you probably have a hard time feeling
them on yourself. Get a friend and borrow his back for exploration of the fol-
lowing landmarks:
 Vertebrae: There are 7 vertebrae in the neck, 12 vertebrae in the mid-
back (these have ribs attached), and 5 vertebrae in the low back (these
have no ribs). Acupoints are beside every vertebra, so feel all along your
friend’s back and be sure you can tell the difference between vertebrae
with a rib attached and vertebrae without a rib attached. It’s easy; is
there a rib or isn’t there?
50
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 Shoulder blade (scapula): You have two shoulder blades, one on each
side of your spinal column, forming the back part of the base where your
arms attach to your body. Like the sacrum, they’re shaped like upside-
down triangles. You should be able to stretch your hand all the way
around your friend’s shoulder blade (or if you’re abnormally flexible,
around your own). Find the following areas:
• Inside border: The inside border of the shoulder blade is the edge
of the blade closest to the spinal column. A lot of muscles attach to
the inside border, so of course you can find good points here.
• Outside border: The outside border is on the outside edge of the
shoulder blade; at the uppermost point, the blade becomes part of
the arm joint. Palpate the entire border and explore where it
attaches to the arm bone.
• Superior angle: This is the sharp point all the way on top of the
inside border of the shoulder blade. It really hurts when pressed.
You can reach your own by taking your hand and crossing it over
to the opposite shoulder. Feel for the sore, pointy spot right at the
top of the shoulder.
• Inferior angle: This is the bottom point of the triangle, at the
lowest part of the shoulder blade. You can try finding the end of
the point on yourself, but it’s easier to find on someone else. The
inferior angle is used a lot as a reference for locating acupoints on
the back, so be sure you know where it is so you have an easier
time finding those points.
Features of the cranium
The face and head have many landmarks. Because most of them are familiar
— like your mouth, eyebrow, or jaw — we don’t need to go over them. When
you’re finding landmarks on the head, be careful not to use too much pres-
sure, because you don’t have much padding over those bones. You can find
all these landmarks on yourself:
 Cheekbone and arch (maxillary bone, zygomatic bone, and zygomatic
arch): This complex runs from your ear to your nose. Place your fingers
in front of your ear and feel the bone. This is the zygomatic arch, which
is part of the temporal bone. Follow it to your nose. It starts in a down-
ward direction, turns into the zygomatic bone then curves back up, turn-
ing into the maxillary bone toward your nose. The lowest point of this
bone, the zygomatic bone, is a smooth knob and is the part we com-
monly think of as the cheekbone. Acupoints are located all along this
complex.
51
Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

 Eye socket (orbit of the eye): Place your fingers on your eyebrows. The
bone that overhangs the eyes is the orbit. Run your fingers all along this
boney socket circling both of your eyes. You’ll feel many tender spots,
so be gentle!
 Occipital protuberance: Sorry, this one has no other name. Find the
ridge at the back of your head with your hands. Feel the hollow in the
bone where the spinal column enters the skull. On either side of the
hollow is the bony protuberance (otherwise known as a knob) that
you’re looking for. Continue to feel the occipital bone all the way over to
the ear.
Be careful when applying pressure to this point, because it can be 
sensitive!
Significant bones of the chest, arms, and hands
We keep the bones in this section to the minimum that are important for
point location. As you can see from Figure 3-1, you have quite a few bones
here, and familiarizing yourself with them can be overwhelming.
 Chest bone (sternum): The chest bone is the big bone over your chest.
It has three main sections: the top section connects with the collar-
bones, the middle section runs between the breasts, and the bottom sec-
tion forms a little pointy knob called the zyphoid process. See whether
you can feel all these different sections.
 Collarbones (clavicals): The collarbones are horizontal and travel from
the chest bone to the point of the shoulder. They’re curved bones that
separate your neck from your body. Follow them from end to end.
 Point of the shoulder (acromium processes): Your collarbones meet
your shoulder blades at a point on the top of your shoulder. The shoul-
der point overhangs the shoulder joint.
 Deltoid tuberosity: This bump is located on the outside of your arm
bone (humerous). It falls just below your deltoid muscle and is tender to
the touch.
 Elbow bone (olecranon process): Okay, everyone knows where the
elbow is, right? You also need to locate the crease of the elbow and the
inside of the elbow joint. Bend your elbow so that your arm crosses your
stomach. See the crease that runs from your elbow bone to the soft
inner side? That’s the elbow crease. The inside of the elbow joint is
another one of the endangerment sites, so be sure to explore this area
with care.
 Wrist bone (ulnar tuberosity): This bone is the bump on the back of
your wrist on the same side as your baby finger. It’s made by the ulnar
bone where it attaches to the wrist bones. Feel all these bones and take
your time to explore the many nooks and crannies. Be sure to move the
wrist around while you’re palpating so that you can feel how the bones
all move.
52
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 Metacarpals: These are the five bones that go from the wrist bones to
the fingers — just like the metatarsals go from the anklebones to the
toes. Feel the areas between the bones where the tendons run. These
areas are important for point location.
Soft tissue: Identifying through feel
Soft tissue refers to connective tissue and muscle. Connective tissue is the
tissue in the body that provides support to all parts of the body. Although
bones aren’t soft, they’re a type of connective tissue and certainly do provide
support. Generally, however, when we speak of connective tissue in reference
to soft tissue, we’re referring to cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and fascia, the
latter being the thin layer of tissue that connects all parts of your body, even
holding and supporting your blood vessels and nerves as they travel to every
cell (we cover it in detail later in this section). Muscle is also soft tissue, and
its function (as you well know) is movement. Although muscles and tendons
are different tissue types, they aren’t totally separate. Muscles turn into ten-
dons as they get nearer to the bones, so the tendons connect the muscles to
the bones they move.
The truth is that you don’t need to know all the different types of tissue or
names of all the muscles. You do need to know the basic layout of muscles,
tendons, and ligaments and to be able to feel the differences between them.
You need to know that a muscle will yield and accept pressure and that a liga-
ment won’t. After all, you don’t want to hurt anyone!
Palpating muscles and tendons
Muscles form the majority of the tissue in your body. You need to be able to
distinguish between muscles, tendons, and other tissue, but you don’t need
to know all the origins, insertions, or functions of all the muscles. Knowing
the names and locations of the major muscles is helpful simply because we
refer to them often. Check out Figures 3-2 and 3-3, which show you the major
muscles of the body — front and back — and give you their names. Try to
remember where these basic muscles are, or you can just mark this page and
refer to it as necessary.
What’s important is to be able to feel muscles. Each muscle has three distinct
sections:
 Belly: This part of the muscle contracts the most. In muscle-builders,
you can see the belly contract into a round ball when they use the
muscle.
 Muscle-tendon junction: This junction is where the fibers of the muscle
begin to interweave with the collagen fibers of the tendons. This part
isn’t as strong as the tendon and isn’t as elastic as the muscle, which
makes it the biomechanical weak point of the muscle.

Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

 Tendon: This part is the bridge from muscle to bone. Tendons and other
connective tissue are made of collagen and elastin fibers — they have a
lot of strength, but not as much elasticity as muscles have. As a result,
they aren’t able to absorb as much pressure as muscles can. Remember
this important point when giving sessions so that you don’t press too
hard on a tendon!
To feel the different sections of muscle and tendon, try this exercise:
1. Bend your elbow and make a fist, showing off your amazing bicep
muscle.
No, you’re not trying out for a muscle man contest, just picking an easy
muscle to feel.
2. Grab the middle of the muscle — this is the muscle belly.
3. Relax slightly by opening your elbow joint just a little bit so that it’s
easier to take hold of your muscle and move it around.
The belly is the thickest part of the muscle and does the most contract-
ing when doing work. It gets thicker and harder when it’s contracting,
and longer and softer when it’s relaxing.
4. Open and close your elbow a few times to feel the difference between
the muscle when it’s tense versus when it’s relaxed.
When you’re using pressure point therapy, you want to know whether
the muscle you’re working is relaxed or tense. Note the following:
• If the muscle is hard and unyielding (you can’t push into it), it’s
tense, and you need to be careful not to fight with the tissue, trying
to force it to relax.
• If the muscle is hard but yielding, it’s a good toned muscle that’s
relaxed. This muscle can receive a fair amount of pressure 
comfortably.
• If the muscle is soft and very yielding, it’s a relaxed, untoned
muscle, and you need to be careful not to use too much pressure.
5. See whether you can pull the muscle belly off the underlying bone.
Wrap your fingers as far around the muscle as you can. Get a good feel
for what muscle tissue feels like. This step helps you recognize how
much you can stretch and move a muscle during sessions.
6. Walk your fingers toward the elbow joint.
The muscle gets thinner as you leave the belly; the muscle is starting to
turn into tendon — this is called the musculo-tendinous junction. Notice
that it’s less fibrous, less yielding, and more slippery than muscle tissue.
When you reach the elbow there is no more muscle, only tendon. The
tendon feels like a hard steel cable and is very strong.
56
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

7. Open and close your elbow a few times and feel this tendon popping out.
When you know what to look for, you can easily feel the distinctions between
different types of soft tissue. However, every person is just a little different
(well, okay, some people may be a lot different), so you may want to palpate a
lot of people’s tissue to get a sense of how varied it can feel. Be careful,
though, and always ask for permission first!
Gently feeling ligaments, the stationary supporters
Some acupoints are located on ligaments, and, unlike muscles and tendons,
ligaments aren’t designed to move. They’re designed for maximum strength
to support the joint and keep it from dislocating. As you may expect, they
don’t have a lot of flexibility and they don’t yield when you apply pressure.
They feel like slippery strings; they’re not as hard as tendons, but feeling the
difference between ligaments and tendons can be difficult.
The basic rule of thumb is that anytime you use acupoints near a joint, don’t
use a lot of pressure. Because the ligaments — and even tendons — don’t
have a lot of give, nothing absorbs the pressure that you apply. A little pres-
sure can feel great, but just a little more pressure can suddenly feel very
painful. This pain isn’t the good pain either; this is the “get off my ligament
now” pain.
Sliding your hand along fascia
Have you ever taken the skin off a piece of chicken when preparing a recipe?
Do you remember the thin, filmy membrane right under the skin and sur-
rounding the muscle? That’s fascia. It looks like saran wrap and covers every
cell in your body; wraps around every muscle, bone, and organ; and covers
your entire body underneath your skin in one continuous, uninterrupted
sheet! Many people theorize that meridians travel through fascia, and that’s
why you can feel the effects of meridian therapy so quickly, in so many differ-
ent places, and on so many different levels.
In a living body, fascia has 2,000 pounds of tensile strength. That means it can
withstand forces up to 55 miles an hour before tearing. Pretty impressive,
huh? What’s really cool is that fascia is more conductive than nerve tissue, so
it can transmit an electrical signal faster than a nerve!
Feeling the superficial layers of fascia is easy. Take your hand and place it
over your leg or arm without using any pressure — use just the weight of
your hand. Let your hand sink into your skin, feeling your muscle or fat layer
under your skin. Lift just a little of the pressure from your hand and gently
move your skin so that it glides over the muscle or tissue underneath. What’s
allowing the skin to glide? Fascia!
57
Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

If you’re really brave, the next time you prepare chicken, try this skin glide on
the chicken. You may be surprised by what you discover.
In the healing plans in this book, you stretch an area before you apply pres-
sure point therapy. The reason you stretch first is to open the fascia so that
the flow of qi in the meridian can move better. When you can feel fascia, you
have an easier time knowing how much or little to stretch an area.
Meridians: Channeling the Rivers of Life
Meridians are channels that deliver qi to all parts of the body. They’re often
called rivers of life because qi is vital life energy. If this sounds like Greek,
check out Chapter 1.
Understanding meridians 
and how they work
Because acupressure is wholly based on the qi flow along meridians, you
need a solid foundational understanding of meridians in order to appreciate
what you’re doing in a session. To make the most of your acupressure prac-
tice, note the following facts:
 The human body has 12 organ meridians on each side of the body (24
total), named by the organs they govern. The meridians on one side are
mirror images of the meridians on the other side. Every organ meridian
governs the health of the organ it supplies as well as specific areas of
the body that may or may not be related to the area where the organ
resides. Each meridian also has important psychological and emotional
attributes, which we cover in the next section. You can use the organ
associations and emotional and psychological attributes to help you
decide which acupressure session from this book to provide. We cover
this topic more fully in Chapter 4. Figures 3-4 and 3-5 show the organ
meridians from the front/side and back views.
Traditional Chinese medicine doesn’t refer to the total number of organ
meridians (24) — rather, it refers to them as 12 different meridians exist-
ing on both sides of the body. Seems like a simple technicality, but you’ll
come across this number often — so when you read that there are 12
organ meridians, just remember that the reference implies 12 on each
side.
58
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

 In addition to the 12 organ meridians, two other meridians travel
along the midline of the body and are called the central channel
meridians. So, it doesn’t take a brain surgeon to figure out that the total
number of meridians is 26. The two meridians of the central channel
don’t govern organs but do govern areas of the body and have psycho-
logical and emotional associations. The meridian on the front side of the
body is called the Conception Vessel, and the one on the back is called
the Governing Vessel.
 Although the organ meridians are referenced as 12 separate channels
of energy (the very definition of meridian in the acupressure sense),
they aren’t separate channels — rather, they’re different parts of one
long channel. The string of meridians forms a loop so that the last
meridian ends at the beginning of the first meridian. As a result, your qi
is always circulating in a big circuit up and down your body.
 The two meridians of the central channel, on the other hand, are sepa-
rate from the big loop made by the organ meridians. They form their
own small loop traveling from your belly button, down around your
torso, up your back, over your head, and down the front of your body,
back to your belly button.
 The 12 organ meridians travel up and down the body. Six travel down
the back and six travel up the front (with one exception — the stom-
ach meridian — which we tell you about later in this chapter).
Imagine a river flowing down the back of your body, getting to your feet,
going under your feet, and then traveling up the front of your body,
making this loop several times. Every time the river changes direction, it
gets a new name, but it’s the same river. This point is important to
understand because it helps you see how a block of qi flow in one meridian
can cause a backup into more than just one other meridian. Knowing in
what direction the qi is moving helps you to know where qi may be in
excess and where it may be deficient. Like a kink in a garden hose, qi builds
up on the side leading into the block and is deficient on the side going
away from the block. Make sense? Finding the source of the block can
sometimes be a challenge, but sit tight — we help you find it in Chapter 4.
 Six of the organ meridians stop or start in the hands, and six of them
stop or start in the feet. To be exact, the hand is the ending place of
three yin meridians and the starting place of three yang meridians, while
the foot is the starting place of three yin meridians and the ending place
of three yang meridians. Not sure what yin and yang meridians are? Read
ahead to the next section.
Check out Figures 3-4 and 3-5 to see the meridians on the human body — and
if you’re dying to know what the abbreviations stand for, head to Table 3-1 in
the next section.

Not only is the direction of qi flow important, but the quality of the qi that’s
being delivered is also a vital part of a person’s overall health. Quality relates
to the movement of qi: the amount of its vitality, force, speed, and focus. Is it
rushing and turbulent, rising to the surface with bounding energy? Is it slow
and stagnant, flowing deep inside and difficult to contact? Although blocks in
qi are indicators of where emotional or physical trauma is being stored, the
quality of qi is often a reflection of the emotional and mental states of the
person.
Pairing meridians into yin and 
yang: The perfect balance
Would you be surprised to learn that half of the meridians are yin meridians
and half are yang meridians? Probably not. Would you be surprised to learn
that each yang meridian had a yin partner? No? It does seem like a perfect
match, doesn’t it? (If all you know about yin and yang is that it’s a cool-
looking black-and-white symbol, you may want to head back to Chapter 1 for
a basic introduction to this important symbol of Eastern medicine.)
The division of the yin and yang meridians is simple:
 Yin meridians are the six meridians that run up the front of the body,
from the earth (yin) to the heavens (yang). They deal with nurturing,
nourishing, generating, and introspection. The soft underbelly of the
animal is the yin side, where the internal organs are easily accessible to
a predator. Nourishment is derived from the internal organs, and nurtur-
ing occurs against this softer underside.
 Yang meridians are the six meridians that run down the back of the body
(actually one flows down the front, see the stomach meridian in Table
3-1). They flow from heaven to earth. They deal with defensive energy,
protection, strength, and action. This makes sense in a very animalistic
sort of way. Think of an animal protecting itself: It takes the blows on its
back, protecting the soft underbelly.
Chinese anatomical position is with the hands in a “stick ’em up” position.
The fingers are pointed toward heaven and are the endpoint of three of the
yin meridians traveling to the hands and the beginning of three of the yang
meridians beginning in the hands.
Table 3-1 shows the six pairs of organ meridians plus the central channel pair.
It tells you what the partners are, where they go, and the psychological and
emotional correlations. The good thing? You don’t need to know most of this
information to use the healing plans in this book, because we used this info
to create the chapters and healing sessions for you to use. The only things
you do need to know are the names and abbreviations of the organ meridians
so that you can follow the healing routine instructions.

Spotting acupoints along the meridians
In order to fully grasp acupressure techniques, you have to understand what
acupoints are and how working with them affects a person’s overall health. In
Chapter 1, we explain that acupoints are points in the meridian that can be
accessed to influence the flow of qi — and the disruption in that flow is what
causes imbalance and eventual disease. Here’s what you need to know about
acupoints:
 Acupoints are closer to the surface of the skin and can be felt more
easily than the meridians. Although meridians aren’t anatomical struc-
tures that can be dissected out, they’re not quite imaginary lines either.
With training and practice, you can feel them, and as we discuss in
Chapter 1, acupoints may be measurable through skin conductivity.
 Every meridian has a series of acupoints. The longest meridian, the
bladder meridian, has 67 points. The shortest meridian, the heart merid-
ian, has 9 points. There are a total of 357 points in the body (actually,
counting “extra points” gives you a few more).
 Every acupoint has its own number and name. A point is numbered by
the meridian it’s on and what order it’s in. For example, the first point on
the bladder meridian is Bladder 1, and so on. A point is named accord-
ing to its quality. The names are things like “Bubbling Brook” and “Sea of
Qi.” Don’t worry — you don’t have to memorize them! We show you the
key points for the areas and imbalances that you’re working on, and
that’s all you need to know.
Acupoints balance the meridian they’re on, but they also have individual
functions. Some of them may stimulate the relaxation of muscles and ten-
dons, and some may influence stamina and well-being. This book chooses
65
Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

points that are specific to the healing plan you’re doing. We tell you the
number of the point, the name of the point, and the function of the point. We
also show you a picture of where the point is and tell you how to locate it. If
you’ve ever played connect the dots, you should have no problem following
our instructions and figures.
Charting Your Way through 
an Acupressure Session
The beginning of this chapter shows you a few bony landmarks, how to feel
tissue, and where the meridians are. The next thing you need to know is how to
find the points. Fortunately, we have charts that you can use. Unfortunately,
the charts are far too complicated for easy navigating. In the healing routine
sections, we break down the charts into easy-to-use diagrams for the areas
that you’re working on, and we use abbreviations to make your reading
easier. For now, take a quick look at Figures 3-4 and 3-5, the organ meridians
from the front, back, and side.
66
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology
Distinguishing among the three 
types of touch points
You’ve probably heard the term trigger points
before and are wondering whether they’re the
same as acupoints or reflex points. The answer
is no, they’re not. Acupoints are related to
energy flow in a meridian and its relationship to
organs and organ systems. Reflexology points
are related to zone reflexes that influence
organs or body areas. Trigger points, on the
other hand, are points in a muscle that trigger
pain when you press them. They’re places
where muscle tissue is contracted, and when
you press them, they refer pain into other areas
of the body. Trigger points can happen any-
where in a muscle where physical trauma has
occurred, but they often happen at the weakest
biomechanical point of the muscle. Trigger point
maps are the places in muscles where trigger
points most often occur and show the area
where trigger points most often refer pain.
The referral patterns of trigger points some-
times — but not always — follow meridian
pathways and sometimes — but not always —
follow nerve zones. The most likely explanation
for trigger point referral patterns is related to
fascia. Fascia is one continuous sheet con-
necting all parts of the body (see the earlier sec-
tion “Sliding your hand along fascia” for more
info). Fascial strains can transmit the tissue pull
from a trigger point to any other part of the body.
Here’s an interesting correlation between trig-
ger points and acupoints: Although not all acu-
points are related to trigger points, 85 percent
of all trigger points happen on acupoints. This
fact indicates the importance of proper energy
flow to muscle function and is another good
reason to do pressure point therapy.

The acupoints are located within the meridians, so knowing the basic merid-
ian pathway that you’re working on is helpful. Every point is named by the
meridian that it’s on, so you don’t have any trouble knowing where you are.
Each meridian name is abbreviated; you can find these abbreviations in Table
3-1, after the meridian name.
The hardest part of understanding the charts we use for an acupressure ses-
sion is translating a two-dimensional picture onto a three-dimensional body.
That’s where your bony landmarks come in — see the earlier section “Bones:
Landmarks in the bodyscape” for more info. We give directions using land-
marks to help make things three-dimensional. From those landmarks, we give
you measurements to help you reach the acupoints.
Points on the body are measured differently than points in space. Locating
points according to how many inches they are from a landmark is a little 
difficult. Instead, we use a body measurement called the chon. The chon is a
Japanese word that means one thumb-width. In Chinese acupuncture the word
is cun. If a point is one chon below the kneecap, you place your thumb against
the bottom of the kneecap and the point is on the other side of your thumb —
one thumb-width from the kneecap! If a point is two chon from the bottom of
the kneecap, you measure your thumb-width twice. Sound easy? It is!
Sometimes a point is so far away from a landmark that it gets hard to count the
thumb-widths. Two simple conversions make things a lot easier. In general:
 Two thumb-widths are equal to three finger-widths. This conversion
makes it easy to measure points that are hard to reach with the thumb.
 A palm-width is approximately four thumb-widths. Go ahead, measure
for yourself. Take your thumb and place it width-wise along the side of
your palm, with the top of your thumb pointing toward your fingers.
How many thumbs does it take to cross the palm? Just a little more than
four, usually!
You may have already figured out the problem with this system. Did you
notice when you were palpating landmarks how much larger some people are
than others? So whose thumb are you using to measure with? A chon is per-
sonal to each body. My chon isn’t the same as your chon, so using my thumb
to measure your body is pointless. I can’t very well use your thumb either.
Before starting a session on someone else, take your thumb and measure it
against your friend’s thumb. Is your thumb a little wider or a little narrower?
It’s your job to adjust each measurement to the same difference. It’s not as
hard as you think, for one good reason. When you palpate the points as we
guide you earlier in this chapter, you notice how tender some of them are.
Remember that most acupoints are a little tender; a lot tender if the point is
blocked up. So when you measure your chon and are adjusting for a size dif-
ference, count out your chon and then feel around the area until you find a
tender spot. That point will most likely be it!
67
Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

To practice, we give you a point and a point location, and you try to find it.
All you have to do is look at the pathway your point is on, follow the direc-
tions to the point you want, and press the point or series of points you need.
Try to find acupoint TW 5. If you refer to Table 3-1, you find that TW stands
for Triple Warmer. Look at the meridian maps in Figures 3-4 and 3-5 and you
notice that Triple Warmer travels down the middle of the back of the arm. 
TW 5 is located two chon above the crease of the wrist, with the wrist bent
backward — it’s between the tendons. To get there, follow these steps:
1. Make a fist and bend your wrist backward (extension).
2. Use your other hand and place your ring finger along the crease.
Your index finger falls two chon above the crease. That’s good use of the
three-finger technique to measure two chon.
3. Press your thumb between the two tendons (aren’t you glad you know
what tendons feel like?).
Press gently into this point. You found it!
Now practice finding St 36. This point is four chon down from the kneecap
and two chon to the outside of the kneecap. St is the stomach meridian. Point
36 is on the outside of the shinbone. Use these steps to find it:
1. Go to the knee and, using the whole-palm technique, place your index
finger along the bottom edge of the kneecap.
Your baby finger is four chon below the knee.
2. Use the three-finger or two-thumb technique to measure two chon to
the outside of the shinbone.
You’re in the tibialis muscle.
3. Press until you find the tender spot.
If you can’t find a tender spot, the point may be balanced or numb. Just
go the spot you think it is and press. Good job!
Focusing on the Hands and 
Feet: Reflexology
Acupressure and reflexology have many things in common, especially the
belief that energy runs in invisible pathways in your body and is important
for maintaining good health. However, reflexology isn’t based on the meridian
pathways used in acupressure — it’s based on zones that the body is divided
into, which we explain in this section.
68
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology

Differentiating reflexology 
from acupressure
The way reflexology is practiced today was developed in the 1930s by Eunice
Ingham, a physical therapist who worked with the system of zone therapy devel-
oped by the physician Dr. William H. Fitzgerald in 1917. Dr. Fitzgerald reported
that applying pressure to the reflex zone points in the hands and feet not only
relieved symptoms but also corrected the underlying cause of the symptoms.
The Ingham Method uses deep, penetrating, and constant pressure on the reflex
points of the hand and feet. Many alternative reflexology methods are in use
today, and most of them stem from this method. One popular alternative to
the Ingham Method is the Universal Method, which was developed in South
Africa in the 1980s by Chris Stormer. This method follows the same zones
developed by Dr. Fitzgerald but is much gentler, using a softer feel with less
force. The way you practice reflexology in this book is somewhere between the
two. We teach you to feel the amount of pressure the body can comfortably
take when stimulating the reflex points on the hands and feet. This pressure
then stimulates the flow of energy to the organs designated by the reflex point.
Although both acupressure and reflexology affect qi flow, the mechanism is
very different. In acupressure, you’re working directly on the flow of qi in the
meridian channel. In reflexology, the flow of qi is being stimulated via the 
nervous system. Think of it like the circulatory system. Blood flow can be
increased mechanically by exercise, massage, or other stimulation; or it can
be increased by the nervous system giving instructions to the body to increase
pulse rate and dilate blood vessels, which happens when you’re excited.
Whether you decide to use one system or the other is often a matter of pref-
erence. Different people respond differently and — for no known reason —
get better results from one system than the other. Also, you may simply enjoy
giving one type of session more than you like giving the other. Many people
find that using both techniques together provides the maximum result because
it stimulates healing from more than one direction.
Understanding reflex zones
The pathways of energy used in reflexology run in ten longitudinal lines from
the top of your head to the soles of your feet (see Figure 3-6). Five of the lines
are on the right side and five are on the left, creating bilateral symmetry. Like
the leg meridians of acupressure, each pathway in reflexology ends in one of
the toes. There are pathways into the hands as well, ending in the fingers. These
pathways divide the body into zones. All your organs and body structures fall
within one of the zones. The zones end in your feet and hands, where every
aspect of your body is reflected in specific reflex points. Unlike acupoints,
though, reflex points have no references to bony landmarks.

The feet and hands are like little holograms of the whole body with every
body part, organ, system, and function represented by an area of the foot/
hand. Pressing the reflex points can stimulate any part of the body that needs
attention. (See Figures 3-7 and 3-8 for the two reflexology maps.)
No one really knows why reflexology works; however, it is thought that the
nervous system plays a key role. Although these reflex points aren’t directly
related to nerve endings, more than 7,000 nerves end in the feet. Before these
nerves arrive at the feet, they pass through many tissue, organs, and struc-
tures. Stimulating nerve endings sends signals back along the nerve path-
ways, which may stimulate organ function. These signals may also affect the
function of the organs by stimulating circulation into and out of the organs,
improving nourishment and waste elimination. So you have many reasons
why pressing, rolling, and rubbing the feet and hands can create great health
benefits.

Chapter 3: The Terrain: Bones, Muscles, Meridians, and Reflex Zones

In this book we give directions for reflexology sessions on the feet. However,
any plan we give you can be performed on either the hands or feet. You may
want to use the hands when people are ticklish on their feet or don’t like to
have their feet touched. Using the hands is also convenient when you want to
assist someone in a public situation and you don’t have the privacy to take
off shoes and socks.
You don’t need to memorize these maps in order to use reflexology points. You
can always refer to charts, even in the middle of a session. In fact, to help you
out, we include the maps and legends on the yellow tear-out card at the front of
this book so that you can keep it with you at all times (or whenever you’ll use
it, anyway). It does help, however, if you’re a little familiar with the maps and
the general organ areas.

Technique: The Healing Touch
In This Chapter
 Discovering acupoints and reflex points
 Looking at the steps of a healing plan
 Examining the beginning and end of a session
 Perfecting your healing touch
W
hen you understand the fundamentals of the philosophy, anatomy,
and therapeutic basics of acupressure and reflexology, you’re ready to
get into the hands-on practice. As you start your journey, keep in mind that
acupressure and reflexology can be easy and effective, but they still require
sensitivity and know-how. This chapter teaches you how to find acupoints
and reflex points. Then we talk about how to treat the ailments, showing you
how to evaluate the problem, prepare the body tissue for the healing session,
and use pressure and various techniques to improve qi flow and boost over-
all health.
Finding What You’re Feeling For
Before you begin treating yourself or someone else, you need to fine-tune
your sense of touch and know what various textures mean in terms of qi flow.
Generally speaking, acupoints are small, round areas that can feel “charged,”
as if you’re touching an electric circuit. They function as little relay stations
for the qi flow along the meridians. The points generally fall into one of three
categories in terms of qi flow:
 They can be functioning normally. Acupoints that are functioning nor-
mally help to maintain an even flow of qi along the line. (Please don’t 
ask how — no one really knows the answer!)
 They can be full. If an acupoint has excess qi, meaning it’s holding too
much energy, it’s full. As you know, meridians can become blocked or
imbalanced from injury, overuse, surgery, trauma, or other causes.

When a meridian is blocked, qi builds up behind the block, which makes
the acupoints there full, excessive, and overactive.
 They can be empty. If an acupoint has too little energy (as a result of
other acupoints being full), it’s empty.
Pressing points helps to rebalance them. Pressing full points releases the qi
they are holding, moving energy down the line and helping to balance the
whole meridian. Pressing empty points helps to fill them with qi and restore
normal function. Different types of pressure help to release full points and to
fill empty points. We cover those techniques later in this chapter.
Feeling normal, full, and empty points
Throughout this section, we guide you in assessing what you feel at acu-
points, so you need to know how to feel one in the first place. Try this acu-
point on the large intestine meridian:
1. Bend the elbow of your left arm so that the thumb is in “thumbs up”
position and cross your arm over your stomach. Hold your elbow with
your right hand.
2. Place your right thumb in the crease of your left elbow all the way to
the topside (thumb side) of the crease.
You may feel some tendons and muscles — if so, jump over them until
you feel the elbow joint, which may put you slightly to the backside of
the thumb line.
3. Explore by using a gentle, circular motion over the bones of the elbow.
You’ll probably find a very tender spot — that’s the acupoint.
After you locate an acupoint, you can evaluate what lies beneath the surface
of your skin.
Recognizing the point under your finger
When you feel different acupoints, pay close attention to what the spots feel
like under your thumb, and use these guidelines to determine whether the
spot is healthy, empty, or full:
 Normal points: Usually your finger sinks in when you press normal
points and you can feel a bouncy ball in the center.
 Full points (jitsu points): Full (or jitsu) points may feel as if they pro-
trude above the skin line and may feel swollen, warm, and full. If a point
has been jitsu for a long time, it may feel hard. These points may be hot
or cold, and the ball in the center of the point can feel like a nodule or a
little BB. In both cases, when you press, the points usually resist your
pressure. It feels like they push back against you when you press them.
74
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

Because they’re generally overactive, you may have trouble keeping the
ball under your finger when you press.
Most of the time acupoints are tender to the receiver when they’re
touched or even when the person uses the muscle the acupoint is in;
other times they’re not. The degree of tenderness is related to how
easily the qi is flowing through them at any given time, which reflects
the overall balance of energy along the meridian. Even in perfectly
healthy people, the acupoints work to keep the qi balanced, so full
points are often tender on everyone — be careful when you press them!
 Empty points (kyo): When the acupoints are empty, depleted, or under-
active, they’re called kyo (key-oh). Kyo points are typically located
downstream from a blocked (jitsu) point in a meridian. The qi flow is
usually reduced, like water in a stream after a dam, and the points on
the down side are emptier than normal. (Remember: The direction of
flow of the meridians is upward on the front of the body and downward
on the back of the body.)
As a rule, kyo points feel depressed rather than protruding. When you
press a kyo point, your finger may sink right into it, and the ball will feel
deflated, or like it’s not there at all. At the other extreme, a kyo point can
be so empty that it feels like you fall into a hole and onto a steel plate.
The bottom feels hard and impenetrable. This feeling can be likened to
reaching the bottom of the riverbed; you have nowhere else to go. When
you press the point, it may not hurt the receiver at all and may even be a
little numb. But of course it can feel tender, too! This explanation can be
confusing for beginners, but remember that a kyo point always feels less
active than a jitsu point!
Noticing the change in energy flow
When you hold the points, you feel them change as the energy flow changes:
 When you hold jitsu points, they may quiver or jump and then suddenly
seem to deflate. You may feel the points soften or simply feel calmer.
They may have temperature changes and feel less tender to the receiver.
 When you hold kyo points, you may feel them fill and become bouncier.
Or they may start pushing against your finger or suddenly get a charged
feeling.
 When you hold healthy points, stop. Healthy points feel alive with
gentle pressure against your finger. They don’t really change when you
hold them because they don’t need to, so you won’t feel too much.
After a pressure point changes, move on to another point. You don’t need to
stay longer because you’ve done what you were trying to do — effect a
change to rebalance the system.
If you can’t feel anything, don’t worry — it can take years of practice. In the
meantime, you’ll be quite effective following the instructions and pressing
75
Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

gently. You have enough information from the initial evaluation you do with
your receiver to know what healing routine you want to use (more on the
evaluation later in this chapter); if you listen to the receiver, she will tell you
whether what you’re doing is working.
Moving to the extremities: 
Focusing on reflex points
Just like acupoints, reflexology points in the feet and hands have fullness and
emptiness. Typically, when a reflex point is full, the organ it relates to is said
to be stagnant or holding energy. When a reflex point is empty, the organ is
thought to be depleted and needing energy. When you press reflex points,
they can share many of the same properties as acupoints. You may be
pushed out of a full point or sucked into an empty point. As you continue
pressing various reflex points, you may find bumps, valleys, soft spots, hard
spots, and so on. No worries — all those characteristics are normal.
You may also feel something that we can best describe as little crystals that
crunch when you press them. Take a foot in your hand and firmly but gently
massage it. Do you feel any little crunchy things? Are any areas more sore
than others? The crunchy things are thought to be crystallized minerals
deposited in your feet because of poor circulation, toxic build-up, or blocked
qi. They tend to show up more in your feet than in your hands because the
effect of gravity is stronger in your feet, slowing down circulation. Although
these crunchy things can sometimes be found in acupoints, they’re rare. If
you find one or two in your foot, or if you have a few really sore spots, check
out the foot map in Chapter 3 to see what organ or body area is being
affected.
Don’t press these areas too hard — you can cause inflammation. See the sec-
tion on pressure later in this chapter to find out how much is too much.
Detecting energy imbalance 
(and balance)
Detecting imbalance is easy! Simply compare one point in the routine you’re
doing to another point in the routine and decide whether they’re the same or
different. It they’re different, which one is empty and which is full? If you
can’t tell, ask the receiver. The receiver is the only person who really knows
his body, because he’s the one who lives in it. You can feel something from
the outside and compare it to what you know, making an educated guess, but
76
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

only the receiver really knows. Press both points with the same amount of
pressure and ask whether one is more tender than the other; or ask whether
the points feel different, and if so, how. Use the receiver’s description of what
he feels to decide which is empty and which is full. Later in this section you
discover how to balance empty and full points, and every routine in this book
will instruct you in how to balance the points.
Walking through the Three Steps 
of a Healing Plan
If you’re starting to think that you’ll never be ready to put a whole acupres-
sure or reflexology routine into practice, take heart — feeling overwhelmed 
is normal. Mastering the techniques takes practice, and the only way to get
practice is to jump in, ready or not. Just follow the instructions, listen to your
receiver, and don’t worry. Whatever you do is bound to help because touch
heals!
A reflexology and acupressure healing session has four basic steps:
1. Evaluate the issue the receiver wants addressed and decide on a heal-
ing plan.
2. Stretch the area and warm the tissue.
3. Apply pressure point therapy.
4. Allow the receiver to relax quietly while qi flows through the area.
This integration period is a very important part of the session. During
this time you may feel warmth, tingling, or a flowing sensation. Allowing
for integration helps the qi to more fully rebalance after your session.
Occasionally you may need to skip steps. For example, the receiver may not
always have time to relax, or you may treat someone on a bus, pressing
points to relieve a headache, and she won’t be able to do the stretches.
Pressure point therapy will still have a positive impact and is definitely 
worth doing — it just won’t be maximally effective.
Occasionally, a receiver feels more soreness after a session or has an aggra-
vation of symptoms. This usually happens when the body is having trouble
healing an injury that’s becoming a chronic problem. It’s often called a heal-
ing crisis because it initiates healing when the body was “stuck.” It almost
always resolves within 24 to 36 hours. If it doesn’t, a visit to the doctor may
be in order.
77
Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

Evaluation
Before you can embark on a healing plan, you must first evaluate your spe-
cific needs and issues and determine which area(s) you need to address. In
this section, we give you some pointers on doing this initial evaluation.
What area do you want to apply pressure point therapy to? With acupressure,
usually you focus on an area that hurts or has some other symptom. Your
receiver gives you this information. You can work where she feels pain, but
you probably already realize that where someone hurts isn’t always where
her problem is. So you may need to play detective and try to find the origin of
the problem. Here’s how:
1. Watch how the person moves.
a. Look for stiffness and lack of movement. If she says her neck
hurts, watch how she moves her body. Does she hold one shoulder
up higher than the other? Does she turn her head in one direction
more easily than the other?
b. Look for emptiness and fullness in the body. Is the chest collapsed
and the back overstretched? The person will feel the pain in the
stretched area (in this case the back), but the problem may be
tight muscles in the chest that pull the back forward.
c. Look at the body’s relationships of front to back, top to bottom,
left to right. Some people push their chest out and all the attention
is on their front; other people collapse their chest, protecting with
their back. Does the person you’re looking at have a pear shape,
heavy on the bottom and fragile on the top? Is she apple shaped,
with a big chest and small, narrow hips? Does the person have
imbalances side to side? Is one side held higher? Does one side
have more developed muscles? All this information helps you
decide where the receiver may be holding energy and what areas
of the body to work on.
2. Feel the area where you notice an imbalance to see where the 
tension is.
In general, if you find an empty area and a corresponding full area, you
want to use pressure point therapy on both.
The pain in a specific area may be originating from more than one source, 
so you may need to address several acupoints in order to efficiently resolve
the problem. The best way to start is to look at the body, notice the asym-
metry, and simply use the person’s symptoms to choose a healing plan in 
this book.
78
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

Reflexology evaluation is more straightforward. Have the receiver tell you what
issues he has. When you’re stretching his feet or hands to prepare them for
pressure point therapy, feel the places that relate to different organs. Check
for the symptoms that we discuss in the earlier section, “Moving to the extrem-
ities: Focusing on reflex points.” Work both the reflex areas that your receiver
tells you about and what you feel in the foot or hand. You can decide whether
you want to use both the foot and hand or only one. Sometimes hands are
more accessible, but otherwise the choice comes down to preference. Some
people don’t like to have their feet touched.
Stretches and warm-ups
In order to get your body in optimum shape for receiving healing, it’s a good
idea to do a stretching routine first. Stretching helps stimulate the proper
flow of energy and increase flexibility. Qi is often bound in muscles and/or
restricted by fascia (see Chapter 3 for more info). Stretching or warming up
tissue before a session opens the meridians and reflex zones, starting your
work for you. Usually you stretch the areas that you’re going to work at the
beginning of a session. If you’re working multiple areas, you may want to
stretch an area, do the acupressure or reflexology, and then stretch the next
area, and so on.
In this section we tell you about seven main stretches and warm-up 
techniques — three for acupressure and four for reflexology. You can use one
or two at the beginning of each session. Each session plan instructs you on
how to do this.
 Muscle stretching: This common stretching technique requires opening
the joint and lengthening the muscles while they’re relaxed. Qi flows
through tissue, and when muscles are tense and tight, qi flow is restricted.
When you’re giving yourself a session, you can do simple movements to
stretch your muscles and open meridians. We provide these stretches at
the start of each session. If you’re working on someone else, you can
guide him or her through the stretches that we provide, or you can use
the stretch in the next bullet.
 Cross-hand fascial stretch: This technique involves crossing one hand
over the other and placing each hand on opposite ends of an area that
you want to stretch. Place the hands on the area lightly, with very little
downward pressure (see the explanation of fascia in Chapter 3). Then,
separate your hands, stretching the fascia underneath (check out Figure
4-1 for a visual aid). Opening the fascia unbinds the muscles and allows
qi to flow through the meridians more easily. This technique isn’t usu-
ally done in self-treatment because it’s difficult to do to yourself.
79
Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

 Meridian stretching: As you’re working on points, you can do this
stretch to help the qi flow through the meridian more easily. Apply pres-
sure to two different points on a meridian using only enough pressure to
connect with the fascia. Stretch the points away from each other.
 Foot rolling: This technique is more of a warm-up than a stretch. If
you’re working on your own foot, place it in your lap and put your foot
between your two hands so that the palms of your hands are on either
side of the foot. Gently roll the foot back and forth between your two
hands by simultaneously moving your left hand upward and your right
downward. Keep reversing this action as you roll the foot. If you’re work-
ing on a friend, have her sit on a chair or lie down on a mat. Hold her
foot in your hands, put your palms on either side of her foot, and roll as
you do with self-treatment. See Figure 4-2 for a visual aid.
 Foot stripping: Place your hands on the inside and outside of the
receiver’s foot or hand. Place your thumbs together in the centerline of
the foot (bottom) or hand (palm). Move your thumbs all the way up the
foot and then repeat in a downward direction. Starting at the base of the
toes or the base of the fingers, gently and firmly separate your thumbs,
pulling them along the surface of the skin. Repeat several times in rows
down the foot to the heel and then back up to the toes and also down
the hand to the wrist. This technique helps release restrictions in the
tissue, which helps release reflex points.

 Finger or thumb walking: This is a great overall stimulating warm-up for
your feet or hands. Start at the big toe, use your fingertips or thumbs,
and press and release while “walking” your fingers down the foot and
then back up a finger-width at a time (see Figure 4-3). Make a row from
your toe to your heel, and then make a row for each toe. This stimulates
all the reflex zones. If you’re working the hands, start by making a row
from your thumb to your wrist, and then make rows for each finger.
 Circular motion: Use your thumb and compress to the point of resis-
tance. Move your thumb in circles without sliding it along the skin (see
Figure 4-4). This is tricky, but you want to move the skin with your
thumb instead of moving your thumb over the skin. This technique gives
better contact to the tissue under your skin. Generally, you use circular
motion all over the foot and hand but especially in the areas that are
imbalanced.
Applying correct pressure
In both acupressure and reflexology, pressure is a key ingredient to success.
You need enough pressure to contact and connect with the qi, but not so
much that you cut off the flow. You also need to know how to position your
hands before you even begin pressing, and you need to know how long to
hold the touch — this section tells all.
Figure 4-2:

warm-up for

Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

Where to put your fingers and thumbs
When applying pressure, you can use your fingers, thumbs, knuckles, the
heel of your hand, and even your knees! The correct use of your thumbs con-
sists of using your thumb pad(s) to transmit pressure from your body
through your thumbs to the acupoint (see Figure 4-5).
You can reinforce your pressure so that you don’t hurt yourself. To reinforce
fingers, you can use two hands to reinforce each other, or you can use two
fingers together on the same hand (see Figure 4-6). Using two hands is espe-
cially helpful when reinforcing the thumb.

Using an elbow, the side of the heel of the hand, or a knuckle is another great
way to give your fingers and thumbs a break (see Figure 4-7).
How hard to press
Generally, you want enough pressure for the receiver to feel it. He may say
things like “Ah, that hurts so good!” If he says it hurts bad, you’re using too
much pressure. A good question to ask when you’re first starting out is “Does

Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

that pressure hurt good or bad?” Asking questions in a way that makes the
person choose one thing or another is always helpful. Never ask things like
“Is that enough pressure?” or “Is that too much pressure?” People have a
hard time admitting that they’re uncomfortable, or they may not want to hurt
your feelings by suggesting that you’re doing it wrong. Let them know that
their feedback helps you learn and get better at what you do and also helps
you respond to their individual needs.
To know how much pressure to use, you need to listen to your hands as well
as to the receiver. When you press into the “ball” of a pressure point, you
don’t want to crush it; you want to press just enough to compress it. When
you feel the ball starting to push back against your thumb or finger, you’ve
reached the resistance of the point. You never want to go deeper than this
point; if you do, you’ll cause the body to fight your overly aggressive
approach. It should feel like it’s starting to push back, but it doesn’t push 
you all the way out.
You can apply pressure in a variety of ways to produce different effects. Using
different types of pressure is an essential skill, and to do this skill well, you
need an ability to find, feel, and evaluate points. This helps you determine
how much pressure to use.
Which procedure to use, based on desired effect
You use three main procedures in acupressure sessions, and these three pro-
cedures apply to reflexology as well. You use a different procedure when you
want a different effect — check out this list for details:
 Work the same points on both sides of the body at the same time
(called the bilateral approach — see Figure 4-8). Imbalances in meridi-
ans can happen from one side of the body to the other side. People 
don’t use both sides of their bodies in the same way, and points on one
side may be more (or less) full than points on the other, creating dishar-
mony. This procedure is called a bilateral treatment and is commonly
used in Shiatsu-type acupressure. To do this type of treatment, press the
same points on both sides of the body and decide which side is more
full and which is more empty. Then press both points at the same time,
applying the techniques to each side as we explain in the later section
“Which pressure-application technique to use, based on point quality.”
This technique can help with left-to-right sided imbalances and is great
for overall body harmony, calming frayed nerves, and restoring proper
qi flow.
86
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

 Work points on one meridian at a time. Another way you can work on
side-to-side imbalances is to press key points along an entire meridian
from beginning to end, and then repeat the same points on the other
side of the body. This approach has the same benefits as working bilat-
erally but is easier on areas like the arms. To do this, start by pressing
and releasing the points at the beginning of the meridian, moving up one
point at a time until you reach the end of the meridian. Your goal is to
even the flow of qi from beginning to end. You may repeat these steps 
on one meridian several times before all the points feel even. In general,
it isn’t practical to press every point on a meridian. It takes too much
time and can actually be draining to the receiver to have too many
points stimulated at one time. We use this technique in the healing 
routines and give you the points to balance.
Figure 4-8:
The bilateral
approach in
action.
87
Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

 Balance the full and empty points (see Figure 4-9). When energy is
blocked, you can help by balancing the full and empty points. Balancing
the points helps establish normal qi flow through the blocked area.
Sometimes balancing the points is enough to remove the block; other
times it may help establish more normal flow. Either way, help has
arrived. In this approach, you’re working different points on the same
meridian at the same time. Start by finding the area where the block is.
It’s usually where the person experiences discomfort, and the acupoints
or reflex points here are often tender. These points are your key points,
and they’re almost always full. Points above and below the block are
almost always empty. If you don’t know which points to use, try the key
points we give you in later chapters for specific ailments. Apply pressure
according to our guidance in the “Which pressure-application technique
to use, based on point quality” section, later in this chapter.
Figure 4-9:

88
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

In reflexology terms, you can
 Hold the same points on both feet or both hands at the same time.
 Alternately press the points selected for the session on one foot, and
then press all the same points on the other foot.
 Hold different points on the same foot together at the same time.
When you hold different reflex points together on the same foot, you’re
balancing one reflex area to another. You may want to use this approach
when two organs that usually function together, such as the gall bladder
and liver, are out of balance with each other. You may decide two organs
are out of balance with each other based on what your receiver tells you
about his or her problems. To feel this imbalance with your hands takes
practice, but you can do it! When out of balance, the qi won’t feel con-
nected. When they’re connected, you’ll feel a change in one as you press
the other. When they aren’t connected, you can press one and you won’t
feel any change in the other.
Which pressure-application technique to use, based on point quality
When performing a healing routine, the pressure-application technique you
need varies depending upon the point(s) involved. Here are some tips:
 When a point is empty, you want to tonify, which means to tone the
point or to fill and strengthen it. To do this, use sustained pressure.
Apply pressure with your thumb or fingertip to the level of resistance 
of the point and hold it until it changes (or for 3 to 4 minutes). While
holding the point, you can also apply massage in a clockwise circular
motion around the point.
 When a point is too full, use sedating or dispersing techniques. Sink 
to the level of resistance and then pulse the pressure by alternately
holding and releasing the point. This technique helps to disperse or
move excess qi. You can also sink to the level of resistance and then
massage in a counterclockwise circular fashion around the point.
 To calm the system, you can use your palms over the points while 
thinking peaceful, loving thoughts (yes, we’re serious). This technique
has the advantage of balancing both empty and full points, so you don’t
have to make any decisions.
How long to hold the pressure
How long you hold the pressure depends on the point to some degree. Every
point takes the time it needs to change — and sometimes it may not want to.
Your job is to assist the body in maintaining its own balance, so never force
the body to make a change. Every tension in the body (or meridian) relates
to something that the body is trying to do. For instance, if you have a hurt
toe, your body sends qi to the toe to help it get better. You may decide that
89
Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch

the toe has too much qi and try to disperse it, but the body always knows
best! You can make suggestions to the body through healing sessions, but
you can’t force change.
Hold a point until you feel it change or release, and then move on. If you hold
a point and don’t feel a change, move on after 3 to 4 minutes. Sometimes the
pressure you apply initiates a change that doesn’t complete itself until later.
Your receiver may tell you that she didn’t feel anything during the session
but noticed less pain or tension the next day. Be patient, because you never
know what the body may do with what you give it.
You can look for three cardinal signs that a point has released: a pulsation in
the point, a change in temperature (gets hotter or colder), or a change in sen-
sation, such as more or usually less tenderness, for the receiver.
Preparing for the Session and 
Ending It Successfully
Before you can start, you have some preparation to do: You need to get your
receiver ready; use the proper props, pillows, and supports; and pick your
session protocol. Here’s a checklist for putting it all together:
 Prepare your supplies: Get all the supplies you need ready and in one
place. Your supplies may include your maps, charts, candles, pillows,
and extra blankets, plus any tools you want to use.
 Prepare your space: Be sure it’s clean, warm, and inviting. Light candles
if you want to, turn off phones, and play music. Place a mat or pad on
the floor and cover it with a clean sheet. Have a pillow ready for your
receiver’s head and a blanket nearby.
 Prepare yourself: Stretch your arms, hands, and whole body before
beginning. Practice the grounding and centering exercises in Chapter 1,
and be sure that you’re calm and focused.
 Prepare your individual session: Before asking your receiver to lie
down, take a quick history and see where he wants to focus and what
kind of symptoms he has, and then pick the session plan you’ll use.
 Prepare your receiver: Ask your receiver to lie down on his stomach or
back, depending on the session you’re giving, and check to see whether
he needs extra supports. If you notice any place where his body doesn’t
touch the mat, put a towel or support underneath. This extra support
ensures maximum relaxation and also protects areas from being over-
stretched. See the nearby sidebar on props and supports for more info.
 Prepare your session protocol: Use whatever protocol you’ve decided
on, and be sure to stretch the areas before applying pressure.
90
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

When you finish the session, be sure to do the following:
 Let the receiver relax as long as he wants to. Be sure that he drinks
plenty of water to flush out toxins released in the session.
 If your receiver has more pain after the session, ask some questions.
Find out whether the pain is good pain or bad pain. Does it feel like a
workout, or does it feel like an injury? Most of the time soreness after a
session resolves within a day, and the person feels much better than he
did before the session.
91
Chapter 4: Technique: The Healing Touch
Props and pillows
Specific areas need to be supported in both the
face-up and facedown positions, especially if
the receiver has problems or injuries. Although
you won’t be working on people’s injuries, you
may be working on other issues they have, and
you need to make sure to support the injured
area. Note: If the receiver experiences discom-
fort in any of these areas, you should get more
material to prop up the joints in question until he
or she is comfortable.
Face-up: For general comfort, always place a
pillow under your receiver’s knees. To ease
other common sources of discomfort during
treatment in the face-up position, consider the
following supports:
 Neck problems: Put a rolled-up hand towel
or small pillow under the neck.
 Shoulder or elbow injury: Put towels
around the joint to protect it from unwanted
movement.
 Low back pain: Put a larger pillow under
the knees to open the back.
Facedown: For general comfort, always place a
pillow under the receiver’s ankles. To ease other
common sources of discomfort during treat-
ment in the facedown position, consider the fol-
lowing supports:
 Overstretched back or rounded shoulders:
Roll up two hand towels and place them
under the receiver’s shoulders.
 Low back pain: Place a pillow or folded
bath towel under the receiver’s abdomen.
 Knee discomfort: Replace the pillow under
the receiver’s ankles with a larger one.

In This Chapter
 Knowing whether you should consult a professional
 Finding a pro you can trust
 Knowing what to expect from the first and subsequent visits
A
s we say repeatedly throughout this book, you have the natural ability
to heal yourself and others. Still, everyone has limits, and at times you
may need to call in a professional (especially if you can’t reach the points you
need to and don’t have a friend who can help). We help you to determine
your bodywork needs in the very first section.
If you do decide to see a professional, you want to choose your practitioner
carefully. Although a competent, qualified professional can greatly improve
your state of well-being, an incompetent one can not only waste your time
and money, but also leave you feeling worse than before you started. Or
worse, you could end up with a “pretender” who isn’t actually a qualified 
professional at all.
In this chapter, we tell you what you need to know to find your match. Also,
because many people are nervous when they first begin receiving healing
sessions, in this chapter we help calm your nerves by giving you an idea of
what to expect, from scheduling the appointment to experiencing your first
session and beyond.
Knowing When to Call in the Pros
Although bodywork techniques are generally easy to learn and can be per-
formed by just about anyone, some cases are best handled by a professional.
Examples include the following:

 You or the person you’re giving a healing session to has serious pain
or is suffering from a long-term injury. You may need more extensive
sessions than you can comfortably perform yourself.
 Despite your best efforts, you’re unable to achieve positive results.
Don’t be discouraged by this. Some cases can be effectively treated only
by an experienced professional.
 You or the person you’re giving a healing session to experiences
increased pain after a session or finds the session unusually uncom-
fortable. This problem may indicate a very stubborn injury that needs
the kind of help only a trained professional can provide.
If you’re just beginning to study these techniques and are anxious or nervous
about your abilities, it may be helpful to receive (or observe) one or two ses-
sions in order to become more familiar with any specific aspects that con-
cern you.
Perusing Your Options
Under the broad umbrella of healing-arts professionals are several specialties
from which you can choose your particular acupressure or reflexology
provider. They include the following folks:
 Reflexologists: As you can guess from the name, reflexologists specialize
in performing reflexology techniques. Depending on the state they’re
located in, they may need to meet certain licensing requirements (more
on that topic later in this chapter).
 Acupressurists: Again, this one is a no-brainer. These types of profession-
als specialize in acupressure techniques. Licensing requirements vary.
 Massage therapists and other professionals: Some professional
providers refer to themselves by other titles but are trained in the art of
acupressure and/or reflexology. Look for massage therapists or holistic
healers who mention bodywork or ancient Chinese medicine in their ads.
Some massage professionals are trained in both reflexology and acupres-
sure techniques, which allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds.
 Acupuncturists: Generally acupuncturists don’t perform acupressure
because it requires separate training in finger pressure technique and,
more importantly, takes more time to perform. However, some do, so
check the promotional material and credentials of the acupuncturist
you’re interested in.
 Pedicurists: Pedicurists often take additional training in reflexology as
an adjunct to their work. Receiving reflexology in this setting is primarily
for relaxation and stress reduction.
94
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

Looking in All the Right Places
So you’re ready to try to find a healing practitioner, but you’re not sure where
to look. Here are some suggestions:
 The Yellow Pages: When you’re searching for a bodywork practitioner,
the phone book is as good a place to start as any. Look under reflexology
or acupressure first, and if you have no luck there, try the more general
category for massage or acupuncture.
Beware of phone directory listings or classified ads for “massage”
providers that sound at all suspicious or questionable. These are often
just thinly disguised ads for escort services.
 Online directories: Many reflexology and acupressure organizations 
and Web sites have a list of resources, which often includes a directory
of providers. On online acupressure/reflexology groups and message
boards, users often post recommendations of good practitioners (and
warnings about not-so-good ones). Check out the appendix for the 
organizations’ contact information.
 Tips from like-minded individuals: When you’re looking for a practi-
tioner, ask around at health-food stores, yoga centers, and other places
where people who practice a holistic, natural lifestyle tend to gather.
 Word-of-mouth referrals: As with any other type of professional or serv-
ice provider, often the best way to find a good candidate is through
word-of-mouth. Ask your friends, relatives, and neighbors for the names
of any practitioners they used with positive results.
Separating the Quacks from the Pros
Unfortunately, massage therapy (and the specialties that fall under that gen-
eral umbrella) tends to attract a small segment of less-than-qualified “practi-
tioners.” Because of loose licensing/qualification requirements in some areas,
almost anyone can hang up a sign claiming to be a “specialist.” Legitimate
massage therapists don’t refer to themselves as “masseuse” and are quite
offended if you do. Masseuse and escort are often code words offering more
services than you may be intending.
In order to avoid being fleeced by one of these quacks, check out the info in
the following sections and rely on your own common sense and intuition.
95
Chapter 5: Professional Help Wanted?

Being knowledgeable and inquisitive
about licensing and certification
The specific licensing/certification requirements governing bodywork practi-
tioners vary from place to place. Frequently, these professionals are licensed
or certified in another area of healthcare or treatment, such as massage ther-
apy or chiropractic care.
Licensing and certification is kind of a tricky area, because as you go from
place to place, the healing arts are seen in different ways in the eyes of the
law. Some states have a so-called “massage law” governing the licensing of
massage and bodywork practitioners — these laws require that any person
charging money for healing sessions that include touching the body and
manipulating tissue must have a massage license from an accredited school
with a specified training program. This includes acupressure, because you
manipulate tissue when you stretch it. You’d think it would also include
reflexology, but it often doesn’t, because it’s been overlooked. Other states
don’t have such laws, so anyone can practice as a professional even after
only reading a book or taking a weekend course. And in still other states, a
massage law exists, but reflexology is exempt from it. Only a couple of states
have legislation that specifically covers reflexology, because it isn’t univer-
sally recognized as a valid modality. Public education on the benefits of
reflexology and its scientific validity are greatly needed.
Contact the health department or the department of education in your local
municipality to find the rules that apply in your area.
Doing some background research
These days, the Internet makes it pretty easy to get the scoop on just about
anyone. After you find a practitioner who you think may be a good match for
you, do your research and check out the person’s background and reputa-
tion. Cover your ground with the following steps:
1. Check the professional organizations that govern the modality you’re
interested in.
They usually have a member board of licensed professionals, and they
also provide a list of practitioners who have been censored by the 
organization. We list these organizations in the appendix.
2. Check the accreditation boards for the modality you’re interested in
to find out whether the school your practitioner went to is accredited.
You can find reflexology and acupressure accreditation organizations in
the appendix.
96
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

3. Contact your local training centers and ask for direct referrals of 
students from the school.
You can also inquire as to the credentials of the practitioner you’re 
interested in.
4. Check the Better Business Bureau and other consumer protection groups
to make sure that this person or facility has received no complaints.
5. Check for online referral boards that give personal references from
people who have used the service you’re interested in; in this case,
acupressure or reflexology.
Getting to know your prospective 
practitioners
When evaluating potential practitioner candidates, don’t be reluctant to ask
questions. Good professionals understand that this is a big decision for you,
and they’re happy to answer whatever questions you may have. They want to
put your mind at ease and make sure you’re totally comfortable that you’re
making the right choice.
So, what exactly should you ask? Some of your questions depend on your
specific circumstances, but, in general, you want to find out about the practi-
tioner’s background and training. You also want to get an idea of what a typi-
cal session is like.
Here are a few basic questions that you may want to ask:
 Where did you get your acupressure and/or reflexology training?
 What were the requirements in order to earn the certificate or graduate
from the program? Accredited training programs give certificates that
most people display. Licensed states require that the state license be
prominently displayed for consumer protection. Look for both.
Fortunately, spotting unqualified pretenders is usually pretty easy. Most
likely, they won’t be able to prove that they’ve had any formal training
or education.
 How much experience in the field do you have?
 What is your overall philosophy of healing?
 What can I expect from a typical session?
 How much will the session cost? What is your cancellation policy?
97
Chapter 5: Professional Help Wanted?

Also, try to find out as much as you can about the practitioner’s philosophy
on and attitude toward healing and well-being. These views are very individ-
ual and vary greatly from one person to another. No answers are necessarily
right or wrong here — you mainly want to make sure the practitioner’s ideas
are in sync with your own.
You also want to be in sync with the practitioner’s level of professionalism.
Lack of professional demeanor or facilities can be a big red flag. Mostly,
though, you should rely on your sixth sense. If your instinct is telling you that
something isn’t right, just keep on walking and look for another candidate.
This process isn’t a one-way street. The practitioner should also be asking
you some questions about what you’re looking for in a practitioner, and what
your long-term goals are — in other words, what you ultimately hope to get
out of this treatment. In some cases, the practitioner may realize that he or
she can’t meet your needs, or that the two of you may not be the perfect
match. In that case, the practitioner should be honest and upfront with you.
Don’t take this personally — be thankful for the practitioner’s honesty and
continue with your search.
Preparing for Your First Visit
Now it’s time for the actual visit, and at this point you may be starting to 
get nervous. You may feel silly seeking this kind of help, wondering about 
its legitimacy and effectiveness. Maybe you feel concerned about being
touched, especially if you’re not so happy about or comfortable with your
body. Or perhaps you’re concerned that the treatment will be painful or
uncomfortable. Some people, and this may be you, are afraid they’ll do 
something embarrassing, like pass gas, burp, or fall asleep.
Relax. This type of session meets you right where you are, sans judgment or
embarrassment. The goal of healing therapy is to fix anything that’s out of
whack with your energy flow and to right any imbalances. Bottom line: You’ll
almost surely feel better, perhaps even like a new person.
So, here’s how to prepare for your first appointment:
1. Make the appointment. Obviously, this task is simple, but you should
give it a little thought. Choose the timing of your first visit carefully. You
want to be able to concentrate fully on everything the practitioner says
and does, so you should schedule this appointment for a day when your
schedule is relatively light and when you can relax afterward. You don’t
want to be distracted because you’re worried about rushing off to some-
place else.
98
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

This initial visit is generally more time-consuming than the average ses-
sion. Generally, you should plan on spending about 11⁄2 hours for your
first appointment. Later appointments typically are about an hour long,
but they vary, based on your specific needs.
When you make the initial appointment, be sure to ask whether you need
to bring anything with you, such as a list of your questions and concerns.
The more prepared you are, the more smoothly and efficiently that first
visit will go and the better the healing plan you can put in place.
2. Prepare yourself mentally. If you’re skeptical, nervous, or tense, 
your mood will affect your qi flow. (For more information on how 
your thoughts and emotions affect your qi, head to Chapters 7 and 8.)
However, bodywork modalities meet you where you are, and if you 
come into the session with a closed mind, your practitioner will focus on
expanding it during the session. The result? You may have a more open
mind when you leave, but if you’re going for help with a specific ache or
pain, make that the focus of the session by arriving with an open mind!
You may need to give yourself a little attitude adjustment, especially if
you’re new to the world of holistic medicine and ancient healing thera-
pies. Acupressure and reflexology don’t fit the preconceived mold that
many people may put healing therapies in (when envisioning “healing,”
people often picture a sterile impersonal environment like a doctor’s
office with many pieces of medical equipment around). Because body-
work is derived from ancient healing practices, as opposed to “conven-
tional” medicine, it may seem a bit foreign at first.
Your First Appointment
So, it’s time for your first appointment. In the following sections, we give you
a general overview of what to expect.
The initial examination
During your first visit, the practitioner conducts an initial examination. This
session usually takes a little longer than a regular session because the practi-
tioner has a lot of information to collect.
This initial examination for acupressure involves what are called the four
assessments. Although not verbally formalized, reflexology uses these same
four tools, but not to the same degree of detail. To find out where your energy
imbalance is, your practitioner does the following, in this order:
99
Chapter 5: Professional Help Wanted?

1. Looks: Your practitioner begins looking as soon as you walk in the room,
assessing how you move to identify places where qi isn’t flowing or
seems to be in excess: What is stiff, what is free, how your arms swing,
and what your gait is like. What else does the practitioner look for? She
may take note of your body language, watching how you present your-
self and especially checking out your general expression of vitality. Are
you full of energy, vivacious, and present in conversation? Or are you
tired, mentally unfocused, and lacking connection in your conversation
with your practitioner?
You may be surprised to learn that the practitioner may be interested 
in the colors you’re wearing, your clothes, and your accessories. This
interest isn’t a fashion critique; the practitioner is interested because
colors are related to specific meridians. If you always wear a certain
color or always avoid a certain color, it can tell your practitioner which
meridians may be unbalanced or overused. (See the nearby sidebar
“Meridian color associations” for more information.)
2. Listens: Your practitioner uses listening skills as well. She listens to what
you have to say — such as any comments you make about what hurts —
but also listens to what you don’t say, which can be just as revealing. 
You may avoid talking about what you don’t want to see or think about,
which can be addressed in the session. An attentive practitioner can
learn a lot by paying attention to what you don’t like to talk about. She
assesses the quality of your voice, listening to the strength, force, and
tension. This tells about the strength of your qi and how much emo-
tional tension you may be carrying. The same words can be expressed 
in a lot of ways.
3. Asks: During the course of the interview, the practitioner delves into the
issues you want help with. She will ask all the regular questions, such as
past medical history, medications, family history, stress, relationships,
work load, and so on. Then she may ask a lot of questions that may initially
seem strange: what you eat, what your routines are like, how much sleep
you get, how well you sleep, and whether you feel rested when you get up.
She asks you about exercise, fitness, and fatigue levels — generally, about
how healthy your lifestyle is.
Contrary to what you may think, your practitioner isn’t trying to kill
time by engaging in a lot of small talk. Each meridian has heightened
function at certain times of day and in certain seasons. If you always
have an energy drop at the same time, or prefer a certain season, these
are indicators of meridian imbalance.
4. Palpates: Finally, based on the information that has been gathered, your
practitioner may spend about 10 minutes palpating key points on the
meridians that indicate the overall balance of the entire meridian. The
practitioner notes any sore areas, empty or full points, and asymmetries,
and she uses that information later in the session. If your bodywork
practitioner notices any serious medical conditions that are cause for
concern (which does indeed happen), she may suggest that you see an
appropriate medical specialist.
100
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 

Acupressurists and reflexologists aren’t trained doctors, so don’t rely on
them to find medical conditions; check out any concerns you have with
your primary-care physician.
These four assessments involve much more than just your physical complaint;
they encompass many areas of daily life. Signs and symptoms are a good place
to start, but finding the area of imbalance takes perception and time.
Practitioners of Chinese medicine use all the information gathered through
the assessment tools to discover a person’s “pattern of disharmony.” This
pattern is based on a constellation of all the signs and symptoms that have
been organized for thousands of years into treatable categories. This is partly
why practitioners ask so many questions; they’re gathering up the necessary
components needed to pinpoint this pattern. This holistic approach takes the
specific disorder or problem into context within both the body-mind and the
total person in whom the condition exists. As a result, this approach is very
individualistic and timely.
Discussing your goals and 
creating a healing plan
During the initial visit, your practitioner spends some time discussing your
goals and finding out what you hope to get out of the session. To some extent,
these goals may be easy to identify. If you’ve been experiencing chronic back
pain, for example, your initial goal is to alleviate some of that pain.
You also want to mull over some broader, long-term goals. If you’ve been
plagued by repeated cases of the flu or other chronic conditions, you may
hope to give your immune system a boost so as to reduce these incidents. Or
perhaps you want to be able to do things that are currently off limits due to
pain, and you hope to get to a point where you need only occasional mainte-
nance visits. (To address the problems fully, of course, you need to rebalance
the conditions in your life that caused the problem to begin with. This means
that you need a commitment to explore how your thoughts, attitudes, and
emotions help to create imbalances that express themselves physically. For
more information, consult Chapters 7 and 8.)
It’s important not to limit your goals to the physical. Perhaps you also hope
to achieve more balance in your life or to reduce stress (or at least find a 
way to deal better with the stress you can’t avoid). You may be a little chal-
lenged to pinpoint these issues, put them in words, and then use those words
as a springboard to come up with an appropriate course of therapy, but the
effort is worth it, because these issues can respond well to bodywork ses-
sions. And, as you’ve probably realized by now, the body and mind go hand
in hand: After you address any spiritual or emotional issues you may be
facing, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll begin to feel much better physically.
101
Chapter 5: Professional Help Wanted?

This visit is no time to be shy, so speak up! The more open and honest you
are with the practitioner, the better he can guide you in figuring out the best
plan of action for your needs and issues.
Together, you and your practitioner will formulate a healing plan, which will
vary widely depending on your particular goals and needs. After you have
your healing plan, the practitioner can suggest specific steps toward reaching
your goals.
If you have several areas that are causing you pain, for example, the practi-
tioner may suggest a healing plan that includes more frequent sessions and
specific targets in each session. He may suggest that you come once or twice
a week depending on the severity of the issue. Someone who is seeking pre-
ventive care may need less-frequent visits focused more on well-being and
stress reduction. This person may have a session only once a month.
The frequency of healing sessions is ultimately your decision. It depends 
on many factors, such as how helpful you feel the sessions are, what other
modalities you are using, and of course your financial situation. For the
majority of people, insurance doesn’t cover these sessions. Consequently,
your finances, not to mention time, will be a driving factor. Be assured that
whatever the level of commitment you can make, you’ll still benefit from the
healing sessions.
102
Part I: Touching on the Basics of Acupressure and Reflexology 
Meridian color associations
In ancient Chinese medicine, color was consid-
ered to be important in relation to the various
parts of the body and how those parts were
functioning. In five-element theory, a practice
within Chinese medicine, each set of meridian
partners is related to an element and has a
color association. The elements of Chinese
medicine aren’t the same elements that you’re
probably used to. Here are the elements, merid-
ians, and their colors:

Lung and Large Intestine
White

and Triple Warmer

Some insurance companies do cover “massage modalities,” which can
include acupressure and reflexology, if one has been prescribed by a doctor
and/or relates to an auto accident.
Keep your expectations realistic. If you’ve been having back pain for ten
years, it’s unrealistic to expect the pain to disappear overnight, even with the
best sessions. Focus on tiny steps and small goals, and you’re more likely to
enjoy successful results.
Finally, the healing session
Now that you have all the talking and planning out of the way, it’s time to get
down to the real heart of the appointment: your healing session. Many practi-
tioners like to do a short hands-on session in the first visit after the intake;
others do the intake and schedule a second appointment for the hands-on 
session. Some practitioners charge more for the initial visit, and others charge
the same amount as a regular hands-on session. Some practitioners shorten
the whole intake, just focusing on your chief goal and not tailoring the session
beyond that. This wide variety can cause a lot of confusion, so ask your poten-
tial practitioner how he handles it before you commit to a session.
You may be so eager to reach this point that you’ll feel like jumping for joy
when it has finally arrived. Here’s what to expect:
1. If you’re having an acupressure session, you lie on a massage table or
shiatsu mat. You stay fully clothed, but loose clothing is best to make
stretching easier. If you’re having a reflexology session, you take a
seat, fully clothed (minus socks and shoes), in a reflexology chair.
The room will have low lighting, may have aromatherapy scents, and will
be warm and comfortable. It isn’t possible to eliminate all distractions,
like building or traffic noises, but as the session progresses, you won’t
even notice them.
2. Your healing session begins, and the practitioner performs the tech-
niques outlined in Chapter 4 on the points that need to be balanced.
The session usually lasts an hour.
The practitioner may talk to you during the session, giving observations
or asking questions, depending on your session goals. If you prefer
quiet, you can say so.
If you were nervous about this treatment, you may discover that you got
yourself all worked up needlessly. Most likely, you’ll find yourself quickly
becoming relaxed as your practitioner begins performing soothing tech-
niques that may result in noticeable improvements in your stress level
and in any pain or discomfort that you may have been experiencing.
103
Chapter 5: Professional Help Wanted?

3. After the session, you get a few minutes to relax before you have to
get up.
4. The practitioner tells you any pertinent findings and makes self-care
suggestions, and then you book another session.
In your follow-up sessions, some issues will get better, revealing other issues
underneath. Like peeling an onion, you can always work on something under-
neath. Each session will contain a re-evaluation of the issues and goals, 
so expect to spend about 10 minutes at the start of every follow-up session
re-assessing. How long you continue will depend on results. You may notice
steady improvement and want to stay focused on weekly sessions. You may
feel so good that you want to schedule a monthly tune-up, or it may not be
helping and you may decide to stop. In all cases, your practitioner can help
guide the decision-making process.

Promoting
Emotional and
Physical Wellness

In this part . . .
You can’t have physical wellness unless you also have
emotional balance and harmony. This issue is so
important that we devote this part to the relationship
between physical and emotional health.
We cover the importance of regular maintenance, and we
teach you how to monitor — and react to — changes in
your qi. We also include some routines to help prevent
future problems. In addition, we go into detail about yin
and yang, and the process by which emotions are stored
in the body, thus causing physical problems. We then
share techniques for handling (and avoiding) anxiety,
stress, depression, and other factors that threaten your
emotional health. To sum it up, this part tells you every-
thing you need to know about the crucial body-mind 
connection and how it impacts the healing process.

Chapter 6
Maintaining Good Health
In This Chapter
 Discovering the importance of regular maintenance
 Adapting to qi changes
 Focusing on specific points for optimum well-being
 Heading off future problems
W
hen you think about it, most people take steps in their everyday lives
to preserve their good health (assuming they’re lucky enough to enjoy
good health). For example, most people brush their teeth several times a day
without even giving it a second thought, but it’s perhaps the most important
thing that they can do to protect their dental health. Then there are other,
smaller steps that can make a big difference to overall health. Some people
take a daily dose of Vitamin C to try to keep colds at bay, while many others
make a multivitamin part of their daily routine.
Now you can add one more thing to this arsenal against illness: therapeutic
healing plans. Even if you’re lucky enough not to have discomfort from any
injuries or illnesses right at this moment, bodywork can still help you. By
encouraging spiritual and physical balance and harmony, and allowing the
proper flow of energy, healing therapy can prevent the energy imbalances
and roadblocks that contribute to some sources of pain. In this chapter, we
discuss the various ways that acupressure and reflexology can help you
maintain your good health — and what you can do to encourage this process.
The Importance of Regular Maintenance
(And How Healing Plans Can Help)
As any health professional can tell you — and as most people already know —
regular maintenance is important for optimal health. Be diligent about this
maintenance for all facets of your health: physical, mental, and emotional.
Optimal wellness is expressed not only by a lack of sickness or symptoms, 
but also by vitality, motivation, and general well-being.

Keeping all your systems on an even keel — and maintaining optimum energy
levels and a balanced state — makes your body better equipped to fight off
any imbalances, and to heal from any injuries it may sustain. Maintaining the
natural balance of vital life forces is important in keeping your system strong
enough to handle whatever may come your way. And acupressure and reflex-
ology can take you well on your way to doing just that, primarily in two over-
arching areas: emotional stability and overall energy flow. In particular, these
healing arts help maintain wellness by strengthening qi and balancing the yin
and yang forces in the body.
Nurturing emotional strength and stability
Enjoying good physical health is difficult — perhaps even impossible — when
you don’t have emotional balance and well-being. Sooner or later your unsta-
ble emotional state has an impact on how you feel physically. Disruptions in
your emotional balance almost always trigger physical symptoms. When you
feel worried or scared, you automatically have a physical reaction — tension
in your shoulders, perhaps, or clenching your hands and fingers. Needless to
say, this wreaks havoc with your physical health and well-being.
Emotional stress can also trigger unhealthy reactions that can have a negative
effect on your long-term physical health. For example, when you’re stressed or
worried, you may eat too much, smoke cigarettes, or drink excessive amounts
of alcohol. You may also have trouble sleeping. These reactions set off an
unhealthy downward spiral, because your declining physical state increases
your emotional stress.
In addition, when your emotional state is unbalanced — because you’re wor-
ried, stressed, angry, or upset, for example — your body must use precious
energy and resources to try to deal with that situation. Meanwhile, it has
fewer available resources to handle other crises, leaving you more vulnerable
to illness and other physical problems.
Bodywork can help you maintain good health in several ways:
 It reduces tension and stress, both of which have strong links to pain.
Alleviating stress can help lessen (or possibly reduce altogether) the
pain associated with various health conditions — and it’s a well-known
fact that stress and tension can present themselves in the form of physi-
cal conditions, such as headaches, muscle pain, and other problems.
 It stimulates the nervous system to release endorphins, those neurotrans-
mitters that elevate a person’s mood and create a sense of well-being.
 It eases the ups and downs of hormonal shifts, which are also impacted
by changes in qi flow.
108
Part II: Promoting Emotional and Physical Wellness 

 It develops your awareness of the connection between your emotions and
your physical self. With awareness, you can take control of the balance in
your life.
Boosting self-awareness
Proper regular maintenance means that you must maintain a healthy, balanced
qi, or energy, flow. Ideally, you maintain this balance at all times, or at least as
much as possible. This means that you must be in tune with your systems as
acutely as possible, so that you can immediately detect and address any slight
disruptions or disturbances in your energy flow.
Your qi inevitably varies somewhat from day to day — it’s just the natural cycle
of ups and downs. Your qi is affected by a whole laundry list of factors: your
emotional state, your surroundings, even the time of year (seasonal shifts). Any
deviations in your regular routine (dietary changes, disruptions in your sleep
pattern, and so on) can also affect the balance of your qi. For women, qi levels
tend to fluctuate in relation to changing hormone levels throughout the month.
Bodywork routines nurture your senses, sharpening your ability to continu-
ously assess the state of your energy. As you become more aware of your own
body’s natural balance, you’re able to immediately recognize (and even antici-
pate) when something is “off” and take steps to restore harmony to your
system before any serious complications appear. For example, if you know
that your qi will be off-balance because you’ve been skimping on sleep lately,
you may also know that you need to take certain steps — such as performing
specific self-healing techniques — in order to restore the proper energy flow.
It’s important that you acknowledge your ability to diagnose the state of your
own qi. Too many people doubt their own instincts. You know your body
better than anyone. Listen to the signals it gives you. If you have a hunch that
something is off, you have a good chance of being right, even if you’re not yet
experiencing any obvious symptoms.
This self-awareness is really a gift. Rather than ignoring it, you should
embrace it. This special insight into your own condition will help you spot
the slightest imbalance and make necessary adjustments while the potential
problem is still in its earliest stages.
Preventative Treatments to 
Reduce Future Concerns
Keeping your system in proper balance and harmony doesn’t involve simply
making adjustments after you notice changes in your qi. Equally important is
taking the offensive and trying to prevent problems before they happen.
109
Chapter 6: Maintaining Good Health

By encouraging your body’s healthy energy flow and vitality on a regular
basis, you can often prevent the stagnant state that causes many disruptions
in qi and, inevitably, discomfort or pain.
Relieving stress, tension, and fatigue
Mental and emotional stress, along with physical tension and fatigue, can
cause or contribute to a long list of painful problems and health concerns. By
practicing the stress-reducing routines in this section, you can take a big step
in heading off future problems. You can find the points you need in Figures
6-1, 6-2, and 6-3, and you can read about them in Table 6-1. If you’re not sure

The routine in this section — which requires all of 20 minutes — will help
keep you healthy if you do it on a regular basis. It focuses on stimulating and
regulating qi flow and establishes harmony throughout your body. You can
hold all these points on a friend, too. First lead the receiver through the
stretching and breathing exercises that follow:
1. Sit quietly in a chair or in a cross-legged position on the floor. Take
three deep, balancing breaths from your belly to help energize your
body. At the same time, try to ground and center yourself.
Refer to Chapter 2 for an explanation of these important techniques.
113
Chapter 6: Maintaining Good Health

2. Continue the belly breathing while stretching your whole body:
• Stand up and take your arms up over your head while breathing in
and stretch backward as far as it’s comfortable (don’t overstretch
and hurt yourself!). Hold for the count of three.
• Exhale as you bend forward, stretching your arms to the floor. Be a
rag doll and hold this stretch for the count of three.
• Inhale as you stand back up; bring your arms over your head and
lean to the side, exhaling while you lean. Hold for a count of three.
Breathe in as you straighten up, and repeat on the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open all meridian
channels.
After you warm up, you’re ready to begin the pressure-point routine. Ask the
receiver to lie down face-up on a comfortable mat or table before you begin
addressing the acupoints. Before you begin, identify the points in Figures 6-1,
6-2, and 6-3. If you’re working on yourself, you can do all these while sitting in
a chair. Throughout the session, you may need to ask the receiver to move
once or twice. You use a bilateral approach on the legs and back points and 
a one-meridian-at-a-time approach on the arms, just because it’s hard to hold
points bilaterally on the arms.
Press the following sequences of points using alternating pressure for full
points and sustained pressure for empty points:
1. Use the bilateral approach on points St 36, Lv 3, and Sp 4.
Hold each point on both sides at the same time for 2 to 3 minutes.
Repeat the sequence two to three times until all points feel equal.
2. Use the one-meridian-at-a-time approach on the points HP 6, TW 5,
and LI 4.
Starting with either arm, press each point one at a time, pulsing the 
pressure on each for about 30 seconds, and then moving on. Repeat 
the sequence three times on each arm.
3. Use the bilateral approach on the points Lu 1, B 47, and GB 21.
Hold each point for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat the sequence three times.
4. Finish the treatment by lying quietly and relaxing (or by having the
receiver lie quietly and relax).
You may notice warmth and tingling throughout your body and an over-
all sense of openness and well-being. Focus your thoughts on attracting
health, harmony, and happiness.
You can follow this routine with the reflexology routine for well-being, which
we explain in the next section, or simply spend time relaxing.
114
Part II: Promoting Emotional and Physical Wellness 

Reflexology routine for total wellness
Total wellness means just that — wellness in all your parts: physical, mental,
and spiritual. The following routine stimulates all parts of the foot and there-
fore all parts of the body-mind; if you want to focus more on particular areas,
use the reflex map in Figure 6-4 as your guide.
Follow these steps for a comprehensive session:
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
You can turn this step into a ritual by adding creams or oils and pamper-
ing yourself.
You can perform this routine on a friend with simple adaptations. Sit
down with the receiver in a chair that’s opposite yours. Hold your
friend’s foot in your lap. Be sure he’s warm and comfortable. Or, have
him lie face-up on a mat with a large pillow under his knees. Lift each
foot one at a time. Proceed in the same way you did for yourself, paying
attention to the receiver’s feedback. Of course, all you may hear is ahh
and ohhh, but you can consider those affirmations of approval.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing 
exercises, do some deep belly breathing now. See Chapter 2 for 
more about deep breathing routines.

3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap. Use the foot rolling technique (see Chapter 4) to
loosen up any qi-flow restrictions.

Repeat in rows until you reach your heel. Do this three or four times.
5. Use the circular motion technique all over your foot.
If you have a tender place, look it up on your foot map. Give these areas
extra attention with stretching and circular pressure. Hold these points
with sustained pressure, and then follow sustained pressure with puls-
ing pressure. Continue on each point for several minutes or until it’s no
longer sore.
6. Repeat all steps on the other foot.
7. End with 5 to 10 minutes of relaxation, breathing deeply and noticing
the relaxation and well-being spreading through your body.
Relaxation is the time when your body integrates the flow of qi.

Balancing Emotions 
for Well-Being
In This Chapter
 Realizing the importance of emotions

 Encouraging positive feelings
 Handling negative emotional energy
E
motions have a huge impact on how you feel, how much enthusiasm and
appetite you have for life, and how healthy you are in general. This chap-
ter explores the way emotions, thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs impact your 
qi and affect your health and well-being. You also discover how to shift the
unconscious patterns that get in your way and cause your body discomfort,
by using simple but powerful tools on yourself or on friends and family. Just
remember, everything changes in its own time — you can’t force the emo-
tional well-being, but you sure can encourage it!
Emotions Happen in the Body
You were probably taught that emotions happen in the brain as a chemical
process, right? You may be surprised to learn that an increasing segment 
of the scientific community is now embracing the belief that emotions are
somatic, or body events. Instead of happening in the brain, they happen in
the body. This may be a new way of thinking, but it makes sense.
Imagine the last time you felt really sad. Let yourself deeply feel the sadness
as you remember the event surrounding it. Where do you feel sadness? Most
people feel it in their heart, or chest area. Another emotion people feel in the
chest area is love. Think about a person or animal who you really love; imag-
ine the last time you enjoyed this person or animal. Really immerse yourself
in the memory and let the feeling of love grow and grow. Where do you feel it?
Exactly! On the other hand, when was the last time you felt anxious? Did you

get butterflies in your stomach? Anxiety is usually felt in the stomach, or
solar plexus. Most people feel emotions somewhere in the torso, and,
although everyone is different, many people share the same association
between what they feel and where they feel it.
Generally, most people trust their feelings and perceptions. If you feel pain
coming from your left toe, you look at your left toe to see what’s wrong. You
don’t imagine that the pain is really in your head and that you’re accidentally
feeling it in your toe, do you? But that’s what people do with emotions. Even
though you feel the emotion in your body, you think it’s coming from your
head! Actually the chemicals in the brain that are associated with emotions
are found in all parts of the body and can be made by any cell.
Some scientists, like Dr. Candace Pert, now think that one of the functions of
emotion is to communicate between the body and the mind. Research con-
ducted over the last decade shows that chemicals of emotion are made by
cells throughout the body, and these chemicals travel to the brain, giving 
the brain information about the body. The process works in both directions
because brain cells also create emotion-related chemicals that travel to the
body. This is the basis of mind-body medicine.
If you find this concept as fascinating as we do, check out these books:
Molecules of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine by Candace B.
Pert (Simon & Schuster) and Bodymind by Ken Dychtwald (Tarcher Putman).

Part II: Promoting Emotional and Physical Wellness 
Feelings and their locations
Although everyone is different, many people
share the same association between what they
feel and where they feel it. You may notice an
association in the metaphors people use. For
example, when you feel grief, your heart is
broken; when you’re anxious, you get butterflies
in your stomach; and when something makes
you angry, it’s galling. I’m sure you can think of
several more examples. Here are some common
associations between areas in the torso and
emotions — both balanced and unbalanced:
Location
Balanced emotion
Unbalanced emotion
Pelvic bowel
Safety
Mortal fear/terror
Lower abdomen
Pride
Shame/guilt
Upper abdomen
Personal power
Anxiety/anger
Chest
Love/happiness
Grief/sadness

Eastern medicine is way ahead of the game! The idea that mind and emotions
are important in illness is integral to traditional Chinese medicine and dates
back more than 2,000 years. In this medicine, emotions are considered to be
generated in the body and transmitted on qi. Imbalances or emotional stress
can cause muscle tension and problems with organ function. Acupressure is
an ideal tool for balancing emotions and thus promoting wellness.
Emotions and Meridians
Each meridian governs an organ and is generally named after the organ it gov-
erns. Each organ generates, stores, or distributes an emotional quality. Yin
organs and meridians generate emotions, and their yang partners distribute
the emotional information to the rest of the body-mind. Meridians and organs
generate both balanced and unbalanced emotions; however, people typically
focus on the unbalanced aspects. Naturally, if things are going well, you leave
them alone. The only reason you balance a meridian is if it’s out of balance.
Before we go too much further, take a look at the following associations:
 Liver: Generates anger, frustration, irritability, and resentment; deals
with planning and decision-making
 Gall Bladder: Expresses anger and depression (anger against self); 
deals with executing the plans and decisions of the liver
 Lung: Generates grief; deals with boundaries (what to take in, what to 
let go of)
 Large Intestine: Expresses grief; maintains the boundaries
 Kidney: Generates fear; stores ancestral energy or genetic material
 Bladder: Expresses fear in fight or flight behavior; manages genetic
information
 Spleen: Generates worry and pensiveness; deals with memory and 
reminiscence
119
Chapter 7: Balancing Emotions for Well-Being
Smile at your organs
A Taoist saying goes like this: “Smiling causes
the organs to secrete sweet substances; frown-
ing causes the organs to secrete sour sub-
stances.” Many people take this saying to heart
and start each day by taking five minutes to
smile at every organ in their body. Try it! You
may be surprised.

 Stomach: Expresses worry; affects memory; pursues or neglects 
self-care
 Heart: Generates joy; imbalance is overjoy (overstimulation), anxiety,
and shock; deals with knowing your path, passion, and spiritual center
 Small Intestine: Distributes emotions of the heart; assimilates information
 Heart Protector: Protects the heart from excess and shock. The heart
protector is an extra meridian that doesn’t have an organ association
per se but relates to the pericardium, a fluid-filled membrane that sur-
rounds the heart, protecting it from injury and infection. It’s considered
a second heart meridian.
 Triple Warmer: Distributes emotions of the heart and information of the
small intestine through the “three heaters,” or burners, of the torso. The
TW doesn’t have an actual organ association, but is associated with the
three energy centers and nerve complexes of the torso — the brachial
plexus, solar plexus, and sacral plexus.
You may want to look at Chapter 3 to refresh your memory on the meridians.
When you consider emotional balance, look at what’s generating the emotion
and how it’s being expressed. You can use this information to determine your
healing routine. For example, if you’re worried and anxious, be sure to check
the balance of the stomach and spleen meridians when creating your healing
plan. The reverse works, too — for example, if you have a stomachache, you
may wonder what you’re worried about. Connecting the stomachache to an
emotion can help eliminate the tension you’re holding especially if you’re
using acupressure or reflexology to balance the meridian or organ that gov-
erns the emotion at the same time. So the next time you’re feeling a physical
pain, see whether you can find an emotional association while balancing the
appropriate points. You can find the points you need in the session plans in
Chapters 6 through 18.
How Your Thinking Affects Your Qi
Every thought you think produces a reaction in the body. If you hear a noise
in the basement and think it’s an intruder, your body generates fear. Fear is
distributed through the body with a chemical cascade that sends a message
to every cell to get ready for action. But wait — suddenly you remember that
you left the window open and what you hear is the wind. Whew, harmless! 
As your thinking changes, your emotion changes to relief and, slowly, your
pounding heart slows down. This is just one example of how your thoughts
affect your body by generating emotions.
120
Part II: Promoting Emotional and Physical Wellness 

The more aware you are of how your thoughts and emotions create body
reactions, the more control you have over your wellness. Negative thoughts
generate emotions that restrict qi flow, raise blood pressure, create digestive
upset, and undermine the immune system. Positive thoughts open the flood
gates and allow qi to flow freely and evenly through the body. This promotes
healthy function of all organs.
Eastern medicine believes that thought directs your qi. We talk about atten-
tion in Chapter 2. Where you put your attention is where your qi goes. If you
always put your attention on what isn’t working, your energy supports what
isn’t working. Here’s an example: Co-author Synthia has a client with high
blood pressure. She worries about how high it is and takes her blood pres-
sure several times every day. When it’s high, she’s anxious because it’s high.
When it’s low, she’s anxious that it will rise. This type of worry raises her
blood pressure. This is an example of sending your qi with your mind to 
produce unhealthy effects. A better approach would be, to send positive
thoughts about how well your body works. This directs the qi to support
healthy function.
The Transformational Power of
Acupressure and Reflexology
Acupressure and reflexology have the power to transform your life. Fears and
insecurities that hold you back can be transformed into strengths. Attitudes
and beliefs that undermine your confidence can be shifted into positive out-
looks. If you take the time to explore your attitudes, emotions, and thoughts
while using acupressure points, your emotions will clear, your qi will shift,
and your thinking will become more positive.
Suppose you have an energy block in the gall bladder meridian in your left
leg. Maybe you’re having trouble making a certain decision, and this has built
up in your meridian. Every time you think of how much your leg bothers you,
you send energy to the block. This energy isn’t necessarily a good thing.
Sending more energy can add to the block, building greater pressure. On the
other hand, sending your attention to the blocked area and exploring it can
produce the opposite effect. It can release the block and allow stagnant qi 
to move. How does this happen? Actually, a lot of blocks occur because you
have unconscious beliefs or unresolved emotions, and exploring them helps
to resolve them.
121
Chapter 7: Balancing Emotions for Well-Being

You can find many great books on the subject of changing your attitudes and
emotions with positive thinking. Reading these books while using acupres-
sure for emotional well-being has tremendous power to transform your life.
The best book for using acupressure to transform emotions is Acupressure
Way of Health: Jin Shin Do by Iona Marsaa Teeguarden (Japan Publications).
Reflexology can also help shift emotions and release qi. When you use reflex-
ology and acupressure together, the two join forces and increase the effec-
tiveness of both. Reflexology doesn’t have a list of associated emotions, but
you can borrow the associations from acupressure and apply them to reflex-
ology. A British study in the 1990s showed that reflexology provided benefi-
cial emotional effects. The study, titled “Reflexology meets Emotional Needs,”
was reported in the International Journal of Alternative and Complementary
Medicine in November 1996. According to the study, reflexology provided
improvements both physically and emotionally, including improved self-
esteem, motivation, and self-confidence.
Using the tools of acupressure and reflexology allows you to let go of the
experiences you’ve stored that limit the way you express your true self. It’s a
pathway to being more fully who you are and who you want to be. So what
are you waiting for? Read the following sections and get to work!
Balancing Points for Emotional 
Well-Being
Emotional well-being is a whole body event and incorporates all the meridi-
ans. Remember that the meridians are all different bends in the same river, 
so an imbalance in one essentially creates an imbalance through the entire
system. Like optimal wellness, emotional well-being is more than an absence
of symptoms like depression or frustration. It’s an appetite for life. It includes
feelings of confidence and self-worth, a desire to fulfill one’s dreams, and the
motivation to do so.
Working major points on all the meridians would take way too long, but fortu-
nately, the meridians have special points that have a balancing effect over
the entire meridian. They’re sort of like primer points, priming the entire
pathway. They’re called source points and they balance a meridian whether
it’s empty or full so that it can be used any time. All the source points are
located on the hands and feet, making it easy to give a good self-balancing
session. You can optimize your results by practicing positive thinking and
affirmations while holding and pressing points.
Be sure to get everything ready first. You need your bone-locating and point-
locating charts from Chapter 3. And don’t forget to have fun!

* Never use this point during pregnancy.
Focus on the points in Table 7-1 when you’re performing this routine that
encourages emotional well-being.
1. Start every session with grounding, centering, and belly breathing
(see Chapter 2 for details).
2. Stretch your whole body while continuing the belly breathing.
Even though all the source points are on the hands and feet, they affect
the whole body, making it a whole-body treatment, so go ahead and use
the following stretches to start out:
• Take your arms up over your head while breathing in and stretch
backward as far as you comfortably can (don’t overstretch and
hurt yourself!). Hold for the count of three.
• Exhale as you bend forward, stretching your arms to the floor. Be a
rag doll and hold this stretch for the count of three.
• Inhale as you stand back up; bring your arms over your head and
lean to the side, exhaling while you lean. Hold.
• Breathe in as you straighten up and repeat to the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open all meridian
channels.
127
Chapter 7: Balancing Emotions for Well-Being

3. Balance the meridians on both sides of the body.
• To balance the points, press each one with a deep, sustained 
pressure for three minutes or until you feel a change. Then 
pulse pressure on the point for another one to two minutes. 
(See Chapter 4 for more info.)
• If a 24-point session is too long, find each point but treat only 
the ones that feel sore.
4. End your session by pressing CV 17 and GV 14 on the Central
Channel.
The front point on the breastbone connects with all yin meridians in the
body. The point on the back of the neck connects all yang meridians in
the body. Ending your session with these yin/yang balancing points puts
the icing on a great, overall, emotionally balancing routine.
• Press CV 17 at the same time as GV 14. These two points promote
great relaxation.
• Hold the two points with medium to light sustained pressure for
three to four minutes.
5. Relax quietly for five to ten minutes, paying attention to any insight
you may have about your stress.
Reflexology routine
Emotional well-being is a whole-body event physically, mentally, and spiritu-
ally. The following routine adds to the routine for total wellness in Chapter 6,
stimulating all parts of the foot and therefore all parts of the body-mind. See
Chapter 4 for explanations on how to perform the various techniques.
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing exer-
cises, do some grounding, centering, and deep belly breathing now.
(See Chapter 2 for details.)
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening up any restriction.
5. Perform foot stripping all over your foot.
Start this step at the top of the foot and repeat in rows until you reach
your heel. Do this three or four times.
128
Part II: Promoting Emotional and Physical Wellness 

6. Start at your big toe, and use your thumbs to press and release while
thumb-walking down a row from your toe to your heel (see Chapter 4).
Make a row for each toe. This stimulates all the reflex zones.
7. Add circular motions.
You can use two approaches to this step, and both are great:
• You can simply use the circular pressure over certain reflex points
on the feet (see Figure 7-4), taking note of which ones are tender,
crystallized, hard, empty, and so on. Work on those points, adding
and releasing pressure until they change. As that happens, your
emotional tension will change, too.
• Or, consider what emotional state you’re in. If you’re angry, use 
circular motions and pulsating pressure over the liver and gall
bladder areas of your feet. You can do this for any emotion, using
the acupressure organ associations.
8. Repeat with the other foot.
Don’t forget that you can perform this routine on a friend with simple adapta-
tions. Check out Chapter 6 for details, and be sure to pay attention to your
friend’s feedback.

In This Chapter
 Learning about the stress/pain connection
 Keeping stress under control
 Using bodywork to provide emotional balance
 Keeping your worries in check
E
ver wonder why people spend so much time trying to control their emo-
tions? What if, instead of trying to get rid of them, you tried to under-
stand their message? In this chapter, we tell you why emotions have so much
influence over how you feel physically. We show you ways to keep anxiety,
stress, and other emotional issues from having a negative impact on your
health. Finally, we give you insight on techniques that can help you alleviate
pain and other physical symptoms that may have been triggered by emo-
tional factors. Although we don’t cover the fundamental acupressure tech-
niques in this chapter, you can find all the basics in Chapter 4.
Stress: The Good, the Bad, 
and the Consuming
The majority of physical and emotional tension you experience comes from
stress. Chronic stress contributes to many debilitating health problems, such
as heart disease, high cholesterol, chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal problems,
emotional distress, and terminal illness.
As bad as stress can be for health, it’s also an essential ingredient for growth
and expansion. Without physical stress, you can’t develop strong muscles and
bones or cardiovascular fitness. Without psychological stress, you may not
be challenged to develop your abilities and discover your highest potential.

So when does good stress become bad stress? Stress becomes harmful when
you don’t allow yourself recovery time; when tense muscles aren’t allowed to
rest; when you rush from one demand to another; when you don’t have control
over the forces in your life. Growth-oriented stress has periods of demand
and periods of rest. Muscles can’t lift weights all day long; they need time to
rest and repair damage; time to restore nutrient and oxygen levels. Without
rest, your muscles get weak and become a site for potential injury.
Psychologically, the information you take in can integrate during your rest
time, resulting in a new insight or potential skill. If you’re always pushing, you
don’t have enough time to learn from what you’re doing. Harmful stress is a
signal that you’re out of balance and out of touch with yourself.
Telling the difference between good stress and bad stress can be a major
challenge. Ask yourself whether the things you do give you energy or take it
away. How would your life be different if you had fewer demands? Everyone
is different; you may be the type of person who thrives on deadlines and
high-pressure situations. No one but you knows whether the level of stress in
your life is good for you.
From the perspective of Chinese medicine, stress can be disruptive to the
harmonious flow of qi, unbalancing the meridians. One easy way to reduce
the impact of stress on your health is to take acupressure breaks and restore
your smooth flow of qi. It’s a great way to relax and rejuvenate even if you
have only a few short minutes to practice. In the end, to be in touch with
yourself requires time to connect inwardly. Pressure point therapies are an
ideal way to do this.
Stress-free pressure points in the 
head, neck, and shoulders
If you’re like the majority of the population, stress tends to build up in the
muscles of your shoulders and neck, causing neck pain and headaches. 
Table 8-1 provides pressure points that are great for reducing mental and
emotional stress and relieving the physical effects of excess tension (if you’re
not sure how to measure chon, go to Chapter 3). Find the points in Figures
8-1, 8-2, and 8-3.

You can simply hold the points or use the following routine:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (refer to Chapter 2).
2. Wrap a towel around your neck for some support, and then stretch by
rolling your head in a full circle, three times in both directions. Stop
anywhere it feels sore and hold the stretch for 20 seconds.
3. Using bilateral holds, press both GB 20s and then both GB 21s. Use
sustained pressure if the point feels empty, or alternating pressure if
the point feels full.
4. Alternately hold LI 4 on each hand. Use sustained pressure, or alter-
nating pressure as indicated.
5. Use bilateral holds for both Lv 3s.
6. Alternately hold HP 7 and H 7 on each hand.
7. End by holding GV 24–25 between the eyebrows with gently sustained
pressure for one to three minutes.
8. Spend a few minutes relaxing quietly and paying attention to any
insight you may have about your stress.

Face points for letting go
People often say things like, “I know something’s wrong; I can see it written
all over your face.” Of course you know that you hold stress in your face; you
can see the effects when you look in the mirror. This look is the effect of long-
term, unrelenting stress! Table 8-2 shows you points to relieve face tension.
Refer to Figure 8-1 and check out Figure 8-4 to locate the points.

You can use these points anytime, anywhere, or you can make a special time
to use this de-stressing face routine. To maximize effectiveness, find all the
points before you begin so that you don’t stress out trying to find them during
the session. Before you address the points, though, we recommend a sooth-
ing relaxation treatment as a warm-up:
1. Put a washcloth in a pan of hot (not boiling!) water and put it next to
the area where you’ll be working.
Add a chamomile tea bag for an added relaxation treat.
140
Part II: Promoting Emotional and Physical Wellness 

2. Contract all the muscles in your face; scrunch up your mouth, your
eyes, and your forehead.
Squeeze all the muscles as tight as you can.
3. Open your mouth, stretch your lips, and widen your eyes.
Open everything as far as you can.
4. Relax and place your hands over the sides of your face, covering as
much of your face as you can. Pull your skin upward, and then down-
ward; forward and then backward.
Hold each stretched position for 30 seconds to one minute.
5. Wring out the washcloth, lie down or lean back in your chair, and
place the washcloth over your face.
6. Take a few minutes to relax all the muscles in your body.
Give yourself an opportunity to enjoy breathing in and breathing out;
listen to the sounds around you; let yourself be present without having
to do anything.
You can rewarm the washcloth in the pan of hot water as many times as
you want to.
7. When you finish the warm washcloth treatment, use the bilateral
approach and hold each point from Table 8-2 on both sides of your
face at the same time.
Start in order, beginning with GB 14 on the forehead. Hold each point
with sustained or alternating pressure for 30 seconds to 3 minutes.
Reflexology to the stress rescue
Reflexology can be a lifesaver in alleviating the uncomfortable physical effects
that stress and anxiety often cause. We recommend using this routine as a
way to combat the toll that stress takes on your body. Note also that using
reflexology has the added benefit of relieving one of the most stressed parts
of your body — your feet. Choosing between reflexology and acupressure
isn’t hard — they both work great, so do whichever feels best to you! See
Chapter 4 for details on how to perform the various techniques.
1. Wash and dry your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing exer-
cises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
141
Chapter 8: Treating Emotional Upset

4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening up any restriction.
5. Use foot stripping to further open the reflex zones.
6. Thumb-walk and massage the entire foot, paying special attention to
any soreness that you find.
7. Ask yourself how stress affects you as you work the spine, shoulder,
and neck reflex points, and again as you work the stomach reflex
points (see Figure 8-5).
Do you get tense shoulders or a backache as you work your spine,
shoulder, and neck? Do you get butterflies in your stomach as you work
on that area?
You can use circular motions on all the reflex areas for your own stress
patterns.
8. End with thumb-walking and circular motions to the solar plexus and
the adrenals, which are both important forces in managing stress.
9. Repeat with the other foot.
10. Relax and fully experience the sensations of reduced stress, such as
decreased muscle tension, less mental chatter, and greater well-being.

Getting Hold of Worry and Anxiety
Mental concentration consumes more energy than any other function in the
body. In Chinese medicine, excessive thinking, or worry, deprives the rest of
the body of vital qi. On the other hand, worry is a natural part of living. Like
stress, worry has a productive side. Worry may prompt you to prepare for an
upcoming challenge. It can alert you to areas where you may not be perform-
ing up to standard. It can keep you attentive to situations that may be danger-
ous, allowing you to avoid harm.
Worry becomes nonproductive when it’s consuming and no longer results in
positive action. Unfortunately, a lot of worry is nothing more than your brain
rehashing the same information over and over again, without creating any
change. Worry of this kind drains you of energy and steals energy from the
rest of the meridians and organs.
The stomach and spleen meridians govern mental activity and worry (see
Chapter 3 for more info). Balanced qi in these meridians allows for sharp
intellect, attention to important details, and the proper “digestion” and analy-
sis of information. When these meridians are unbalanced, you may have a
hard time analyzing information, which is the root of much worry.
Anxiety is related to worry but is less mentally focused. Anxiety can result
from feeling out of control, or at the mercy of events around you. While worry
is usually focused on the future, anxiety is more immediate. If you’ve ever
had an anxiety attack, you know how uncomfortable it can be. You may ex-
perience a pounding heart with shortness of breath and extreme emotional 
agitation.
In meridian theory, anxiety is an imbalance in qi flow in the heart meridian. In
Chapter 3 we talk about the meridians being one continuous river of qi that
changes names when it changes directions. Well, interestingly, the spleen sec-
tion of the river turns into the heart section of the river. Anxiety is sometimes
a reflection of excessive worry holding energy in the spleen and causing a
deficiency in the heart channel.
Moderate fluctuations in emotions are normal, but you should take any 
major roller-coaster swings in emotions seriously and mention them to your
doctor. Major emotional fluctuations could indicate a medical disorder that
requires treatment (possibly including medication, therapy, or a combination
of the two).

After reviewing the points in Table 8-4, put them into action in this routine,
which helps ease anxiety woes:
1. Prepare with belly breathing, grounding, and centering (refer to
Chapter 2).
2. Place your hands together in prayer position and lift your elbows,
holding for 30 seconds. Then stretch your arms backward, rotating
your hands in both directions to create a good stretch.
3. Hold HP 7 on one side of the body, followed by HP 6 and TW 5 (you
can hold these two together at the same time; they’re opposite each
other on the wrist).
4. Hold H 7 followed by H 5.
5. Repeat on the other arm.
6. Use bilateral holds for both Lu 1s.
7. End with CV 17.
Worry-free reflexology
Reflexology can also be helpful in reducing the mental worry of worrywarts.
The routine earlier in the chapter, “Reflexology to the stress rescue,” focuses
on emotional and physical stress. This routine deals with mental stress, the
need to ease the mind of worry that goes round and round:
1. Wash your feet, and then center and warm up.
2. Thumb-walk and use circular motions to detect and release any imbal-
ances in the reflex areas on the foot for the stomach, spleen, heart,
and small intestine (see Figure 8-6).
3. If you experience worry and anxiety in a specific part of your body,
be sure to pay attention to the associated reflex areas.
4. End with thumb-walking and circular motions to the solar plexus and
the adrenals, both of which generate and manage anxiety and worry.
5. Repeat with the other foot.
6. Spend some time relaxing and enjoying the benefits of your session.
Relaxation allows the body to feel what it’s like to be free of worry
and anxiety.

Chapter 8: Treating Emotional Upset

Don’t Let Depression Keep You Down
Much as we’d like to, we’re not going to tell you that you should try to live
your life without ever feeling depressed. Going through life and never feeling
a little down is impossible. When you suffer a loss, or can’t express yourself
in an important area of your life, you may get a bad case of the blues.
Depression is often seen as the opposite side of anger, or, as Freud said,
anger turned against self. Anger itself is a symptom of being blocked in some
aspect of your life. Maybe someone is breaching your boundaries, or you’re
trying to push the river, making something happen when its time hasn’t yet
come. Knowing the source of your emotions is the first step to allowing
change.
People can be genetically predisposed to depression, so if this problem runs
in your family, you need to be aware that you could be at risk of this condi-
tion. Females are especially susceptible to depression. According to the
National Institute of Mental Health, women experience depression about
twice as often as men.

Uplifting acupressure
In oriental medicine, depression and anger are imbalances in the liver and
gall bladder meridians. As we discuss in Chapter 3, in Chinese medicine the
liver meridian makes decisions, and the gall bladder meridian carries them
out. Are you having trouble making decisions? Or do you feel frustrated making
your dreams come true? Maybe you feel your life has no purpose, or you’ve
lost connection to your heart. Take some time to connect with yourself, treat-
ing the acupoints in Table 8-5, shown earlier in the chapter in Figures 8-1, 8-2,
and 8-3, by using the corresponding routine we provide in this section.

Easing the blues with reflexology
Reflexology can also help improve your mood and alleviate depression. If
you’re feeling low and enjoy practicing reflexology, try this routine:
1. Start with foot washing, centering, and a warm up.
2. Use the reflex areas on the foot for the liver, gall bladder, and heart
(see Figure 8-7).
Thumb-walk and use circular motions to detect and release any 
imbalances.
3. Work the spine, shoulders, and neck areas.
Anger and depression are often expressed through tension in postural
muscles, so pay particular attention to these areas if you’re angry or
depressed.
As always, if you hold your emotions in a specific pattern, be sure to pay
attention to the associated reflex areas.

n Part III, we target specific areas of the body that may
be causing you pain or problems. No matter what your
most pressing issue, chances are good that you’ll find
helpful treatments for it in this part.
We start at the feet, work our way up the leg, and move
into the hips. From aching heels to sore hamstrings, you
find the keys to relief in this part. Backaches are a big
problem for many people, so we address that in this part,
as well. Having pain in your hands or arms? We have that
covered, too. And if you have trouble in your stomach or
chest areas, you’ll want to zero in on those sections of
this part. Then we head higher up, tackling headaches and
problems related to the face.
You might say that this is “the part for all your parts.”

Chapter 9
Putting Your Best Foot Forward
In This Chapter
 Figuring out why your feet hurt
 Realizing the importance of nurturing your feet
 Checking out common causes of foot pain
 Relieving foot pain and strain
N
o matter how big or small, all feet have one thing in common: For some-
thing that looks so simple, the foot is surprisingly complex. About 25
percent of all the bones in your body are found in your feet — along with
more than 20 muscles, numerous tendons and ligaments, and assorted other
anatomical bits and parts. In other words, your feet have lots of intricate —
and often neglected and overworked — parts. So you’re left with lots of
places where pain can occur and really bring the entire operation to a
screeching halt.
And because your feet have so many individual parts packed so closely
together in a relatively small space, one small pain can quickly affect an
increasingly larger area of your foot. In addition, your feet and ankles are the
foundation upon which the entire rest of your body depends — they literally
carry the weight of everything else in your anatomy. So, for example, if foot
pain causes you to walk awkwardly or distribute your weight unevenly, you
may wind up with pain in your legs and back.
Ankles are small compared to the rest of the body, and a lot of weight bears
down on this rather narrow joint, so the joint has to be pretty strong to pro-
vide enough support. For this reason, it’s important to nip the problem in the
bud, addressing and alleviating foot and ankle pain at the very start.
Fortunately, we can give you hope. Acupressure can assist the movement of
stagnant qi accumulating in the many joints of your feet and ankles, increas-
ing flexibility and movement. But reflexology may be your first choice,
because pressing, moving, and stimulating the feet directly relieves muscular
tension as well as reflexively moving qi.

Identifying the Culprit
Before you can treat your foot pain, you need to figure out what’s causing it
in the first place. Removing the pain without treating the source is just like
applying a temporary bandage — the pain will return. Lots of things — rang-
ing from mild annoyances to major health concerns — can cause pain or dis-
comfort in the foot and lower leg. In some cases the cause of the pain may
not be resolvable — such as with damaged nerves from diabetes. In those
cases you can still use acupressure and reflexology to ease the discomfort
and slow the degeneration process.
Often, the cause of foot pain is blatantly obvious. If you spend ten straight
hours on your feet at work while standing on an unforgiving concrete floor,
you don’t need the skills of Sherlock Holmes to figure out why your feet are in
agony. In order for acupressure and reflexology to have a lasting effect, you
need to find a solution to your working conditions. Same thing goes for pain
that starts right after you suffer a broken toe — the pain will remain as the
toe heals. But there’s good news: These bodywork techniques will help the
toe heal faster and reduce the pain of healing by encouraging the flow of
nourishing qi.
Sometimes the root of your pain may be a bit more of a mystery. What if you
have foot discomfort first thing in the morning, before you even take a single
step? Or what about feet that never seem to feel better, no matter how long
you soak them in that foot bath? In these cases, you need to proceed with
caution until you have a diagnosis. You don’t want the pressure you use to
cause damage to already damaged tissue.
In this section, we cover both scenarios.
Recognizing common causes of pain
Several everyday scenarios commonly cause foot pain. Here, we discuss a
few of the most likely culprits:
 The strain of the daily grind: Quite a few foot problems are caused by
what amounts to wear and tear — you put a lot of miles on your feet and
all that use is bound to take its toll. And, unfortunately, you really can’t
avoid putting a certain amount of miles on your feet — at least, not
unless you plan to spend your entire life in bed. For city dwellers espe-
cially, walking considerable distances is simply an inevitable part of
156
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

daily life. Then again, just standing still is tough on your feet — and in
some ways, it’s worse than walking because standing in one spot exerts
continuous pressure on the same limited group of muscles, causing
increasing fatigue.
In addition, if you stand on your feet all day, your veins can get weak,
allowing fluid to build up in the ankles. This fluid build-up is called
edema and can increase joint stiffness. Acupressure can stimulate
venous return and lymph flow, so the ankle routine later in this chapter
can be very helpful for alleviating fluid build-up, too.
 Fashionable yet painful shoes: Perhaps you mistreat your feet by sub-
jecting them to tasks and conditions that they were never designed to
endure. Stiletto heels and pointy toes, anyone? High heels are often
blamed for ankle problems, but other types of shoes (such as clogs) can
also put strain on the feet and ankles. When you decide to suffer for the
sake of fashion, your feet often pay the price. (Not surprisingly, women
are several times more likely than men to experience foot problems.)
According to the American Podiatric Medical Association, heels over
two inches high change the way a woman normally walks, and heels
over three inches put seven times the pressure on the ball of the foot! 
In addition, the small of your back suffers with the change in body 
positioning.
 Corns and bunions: These annoying foot problems are another cause of
discomfort. They can both be caused by a change in weight distribution
as you walk, but having corns changes how you walk even more, causing
misalignment and pain in the bones and joints.
 Hobbies and such: Certain lifestyle habits can be tough on your feet. If
you do a lot of hiking or climbing (even if it’s climbing a lot of stairs),
you’re causing a lot of stress for your feet.
 The way you sit: If you often sit with your feet crossed or tucked under-
neath you, you can cause a lot of strain and stress on your feet, espe-
cially over extended periods of time.
 Accidents and injuries: Feet tend to be unlucky, because they’re often in
the wrong place at the wrong time — or they’re forced to suffer the con-
sequences of their owner’s clumsiness and carelessness. As a result, feet
endure more broken bones, sprains, twisted ankles, and stubbed toes
than anyone can count.
An added complication is that foot injuries can heal slowly or incorrectly
because people with these types of injuries are frequently unable or
unwilling to stay off their feet long enough to allow for proper recovery.
157
Chapter 9: Putting Your Best Foot Forward

Foot problems are extremely common. A study conducted by the American
Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) in 2004 found that 31 percent of those
interviewed had foot or ankle problems within a year’s time.
Finding a mysterious source of pain
The cause of your foot pain is often blatantly obvious. When the origins of
your foot pain aren’t so clear, though, you need to spend a bit of time evaluat-
ing your health and family history. Here are a few causes that you may not
have considered:
 Hereditary conditions: Sometimes people are born with conditions that
cause foot pain, including things like flat feet or high arches.
 General health problems: People with diabetes and circulatory condi-
tions also frequently experience pain in their feet. (People who suffer
from these conditions should make their doctor aware of any new or
increased foot pain, in case it signifies a serious problem.)
 Bone spurs: Bone spurs are growths that develop along the edges of
bones and can cause pain by rubbing against nearby nerves and other
bones. They generally occur with aging but also can be caused by vari-
ous medical conditions, such as osteoarthritis and plantar fasciitis.
 Hammertoes: Hammertoes are toes in which the middle joint sticks out,
producing a painful “buckling” effect, which is often complicated by the
growth of a corn in that area.

Daily tips for easing foot pain 
(aside from bodywork)
Obviously, you can’t change the shape (or size)
of the feet you were born with, but you can 
take several steps to make those feet more
comfortable:
 Arch supports can be helpful in treating a
variety of foot problems, including flat feet.
In severe cases, you may need to order a
custom-fitted support from your podiatrist,
but generally an over-the-counter support
will work just fine.
 Cushioned shoe inserts can often make a
big difference in how your feet feel at the
end of the day, especially if you walk a lot.
Look for insoles with gel cushioning, which
many people say work the best. If you have
flat feet or fallen arches, arch supports can
also help.
 Exercise and stretching can relax the foot
muscles — particularly those around the
ankles — which can make a big difference
in your comfort level.
 Pain creams and over-the-counter pain
relievers can often provide temporary relief,
but it’s not a good idea to rely on these
(especially medications) for extended peri-
ods of time.

Obviously, you can’t do much to change the conditions you were born with
(although medical treatment may be able to help with some conditions to a
certain extent). In these cases, often the best you can do is to try the following:
 Keep your feet in the best shape possible by treating them to regular
preventative-maintenance therapy sessions.
 Promptly address any specific problems and pain that you have.
If you’re facing pains you weren’t born with but have developed over time, ask
your doctor for recommendations on treating them and check out our advice
in the nearby sidebar “Daily tips for easing foot pain (aside from bodywork).”
Relieving Pain in Your Kickers
The following routines are great for reducing ankle pain, swelling, and stiff-
ness as well as foot pain and discomfort. They can also promote healing from
sprains and strains, which is important because improper healing from ankle
injuries may leave you with a weak joint. Weakness in the ankles translates
into stress on the knees and hips, leading to pain in these joints as well.
Obviously, these routines are limited when you’re trying to help “surface prob-
lems” like blisters and corns (in those cases, your best bet is to also use topi-
cal treatments like ointments and creams specifically for those ailments). Still,
by reducing your pain and making your feet more comfortable, these exercises
can greatly improve your overall foot health. When poor foot alignment causes
corns, stretching can be beneficial along with evaluating and correcting the
biomechanics of your gait. This treatment requires the professional help of a
physical therapist, orthopedist, or doctor of physical medicine.
Ankles and feet: Pressure on 
the acupoints for fast relief
The main points you use in this section are ankle and feet points on the
kidney, bladder, stomach, spleen, and gall bladder meridians. Moving blocks
in the ankles opens pathways for stagnant qi to move out of the feet as well.
We show you the points (see Figures 9-1 and 9-2) and then make suggestions
on how to use them.
Keep in mind that every point has multiple functions, and we use the same
point to do different things in different treatments. Table 9-1 gives you infor-
mation on the points and their benefits (if you aren’t familiar with the mea-
surement term chon, see Chapter 3). You can provide benefit to any foot or
ankle problem by using the points in Table 9-1 — we recommend using them
159

all for overall ankle and foot well-being, but if you don’t have time, just work
on the points that address the specific conditions we identify in the table.

Here’s an exercise that can help ankles and feet feel their best:
1. Start with deep belly breathing, grounding, and centering (refer to
Chapter 2).
2. Stretch the ankle by doing the following:
• Rotating it in a circle, first clockwise and then counterclockwise.
• Sitting on the floor or bed with an outstretched leg. Flex your foot
and reach forward to grab your toes. If you can’t reach your toes,
take a towel and loop it around your foot, holding onto the ends so
that you have a sling around your foot. Slowly lean back to create 
a gentle stretch on the ankle. If you have an injury, be very gentle;
never cause pain. You can even omit the stretches altogether if 
you need to.
• If you’re working on someone else, gently do these stretches for
her. Make sure she doesn’t help when you put her ankle through its
range of motion. Be very cautious if your friend has an injury —
you may want to omit the stretches altogether.
3. For overall wellness, alternately press and release each point in Table
9-1, focusing attention on the sore points — if you’re pressed for time,
skip ahead to Step 4.
Disperse points that seem very full or stagnant by pulsing your pressure.
Tonify or build qi in empty points by holding sustained pressure until
the acupoint fills up.
163
Chapter 9: Putting Your Best Foot Forward

If you have active inflammation, be sure to use light pressure on inflamed
areas. If you have an ankle injury, press the points above and below the
injury to encourage qi flow through the injured area. You may want to do
this every day until your ankle is healed.
4. If you’re pressed for time or just want to focus on a particular issue,
focus on these key points:
• Swollen ankle: K 3, K 6, St 41, Sp 4
• Sprained ankle: K 3, K 6, St 41, GB 34, GB 40
• Fallen arches: GB 39, Sp 4
• Plantar fasciitis: St 41, B 60, B 62, Sp 4
• Arthritis: K 3, K 6, St 41, B 60, B 62
5. Enjoy your well-earned 5 to 10 minutes of relaxation. Focus on noth-
ing at all except your breath and the warmth in your relaxed yet 
stimulated feet.
Reflexology: Rotate, roll, and rub away!
Reflexology can be helpful in treating injuries and in reducing swelling in feet
and ankles. Co-author Synthia has seen swelling reduce by as much as 25 per-
cent after a session when stimulating the lymphatic pathways. The lymph
system drains excess fluid from an area, helping with swelling from standing
on your feet all day or inflammation swelling from an injury. Reflexology is
especially helpful when the ankle itself is too painful to work on directly. In
addition to assisting the body in healing after injuries, it can improve qi flow
through the area, reducing stagnation, pain, and stiffness.
Here’s a routine that can be helpful:
1. Sit in a comfortable chair and put your foot in your lap.
If you can’t comfortably put your foot in your lap, use a reflexology tool.
Try a tennis ball in a sock or any reflexology tool you have (see Chapter
2 for more on these tools).
2. Follow your warm-up routine of foot washing, belly breathing, foot
rolling, and foot stripping.
3. Use your thumbs to “thumb-walk” all over the end of the heel in the
foot reflex area.
4. Finger- or thumb-walk up the lymphatic strip (see Figure 9-3), starting
at the heel and walking toward the toe.
Do this step several times, starting each time at the heel and moving
toward the toe.
164
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

5. Use your thumbs to do circular motions on the heel area (reflex areas
for the feet, ankles, and sciatic nerve) and the lymphatic strip.
Finding the ankle points may be difficult, because the ankle has no desig-
nation on the map. Generally, ankles are considered part of the reflex
area for the feet found on the very small wedge on the end of both heels.
Take extra time where you feel soreness, stickiness, or crystals.
6. End by thumb-walking several times up and down the lymphatic strip.
7. If you’re using a tool, put it on the floor under your foot and simply
roll your foot over the tool along the reflex areas, stopping when you
feel soreness and working that area thoroughly.
Use as much pressure as is comfortable.
8. Repeat with the other foot (although you can skip this step if you’re
assisting an injury on one foot only).

I
f feet are the foundation of the body (see Chapter 9), legs and hips are the
load-bearing walls that keep it standing upright and properly supported.
Think about it: Every time the foot takes a step, the leg is right there taking
the trip along with it.
In this chapter, we discuss some of the most common hip and leg problems,
and we demonstrate bodywork techniques that can help you address — and
hopefully correct — any imbalances that may be causing or worsening the
pain. By making sure your energy flow is in sync, you can also put your
system in optimum condition to recover from any illness or injury that may
be bringing you pain.
Common Leg Ailments
Legs really get a workout through the entire day. Whether you’re walking,
standing, driving, dancing, or doing any of the other activities you do on a
daily basis, your legs are bearing at least a moderate amount of stress or
strain. And don’t forget lifting. By now, everyone’s heard the advice to “lift
with your legs, not your back.” Well, that’s great for your back — but not so
great for your poor legs.
Hips and knees face their share of problems and challenges, too. In order for
you to be able to move in all directions, your hips need to have a very large
range of motion. And the hardest job for any joint is to provide great stability
with a lot of movement — they’re sort of opposite needs. No wonder hips get
tired and sore. Pain and stiffness in the hips (which can often increase with
age) can make if difficult to do everyday tasks — or even to move much at all.

And although the knee seems like a simple joint, it’s actually a masterful bal-
ance of opposing forces that align and propel movement. Of course, with 
lots of different forces, you expect lots of different problems. No surprise,
knees are the site of common complaints both for athletes and for less active
people.
In the following list, we touch on a few of the most common leg ailments, all of
which can be treated with acupressure and reflexology (in addition to medical
treatment when appropriate, of course):
 Muscle cramps and injuries: People often experience leg pain as a result
of muscle cramps. Often felt in the calves or upper thighs, muscle cramps
can strike during or after exercise or other physical exertion. Muscles
are also susceptible to injuries as a result of accidents or overexertion.
Anyone who’s suffered a torn or strained muscle knows how painful those
injuries can be. Reflexology and acupressure move qi through these sore
areas, relieving stagnation, increasing nourishment, and improving circu-
lation to the tissue.
Dehydration can cause or worsen muscle cramps in the legs. Be sure to
stay properly hydrated, especially during and after exercise.
 Knee problems: Knee problems can be incredibly painful and debilitat-
ing. Unfortunately, they’re also fairly common — especially for people
who are very active or athletic. Most types of sports and other athletic
activities involve at least a moderate amount of strain on the knees.
Anyone who follows sports knows how often athletes are sidelined by
various knee problems. Increasing nourishing qi can help the body’s
healing efforts, speeding recovery time and ensuring the most complete
healing process possible.
 Vein-related conditions: Many of the most common (and most serious)
health problems occurring in the legs involve the veins. Veins are ves-
sels that carry blood to the heart. (Then there are arteries, of course,
which bring blood from the heart to the rest of the body.) About two-
thirds of the body’s blood supply is carried via the veins. Acupressure
and reflexology have a direct impact on circulation: where qi goes, blood
follows. The healing arts are ideal for assisting the body with some types
of circulatory conditions; always use caution if serious conditions are
suspected, and never use pressure directly on a sore vein. Two condi-
tions in particular affect a significant number of people:
• Varicose veins are probably the most well-known vein-related
problem in the legs. This is a condition in which veins become
swollen and enlarged. Typically, this condition is associated with
large blue veins that protrude through the skin of the legs. The
majority of cases of varicose veins occur in women. Heredity plays
a role, although women are generally at greater risk during and
after pregnancy.
168
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

Varicose veins aren’t just a cosmetic problem. They can interfere
with proper blood flow and cause circulation problems. Acupressure
and reflexology are ideal for assisting with the circulation of qi and
blood. Take care not to press on a varicosity; use only light contact
with no pressure on any points that are directly on top of a vein
that’s enlarged, swollen, or painful.
• Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot
forms deep within a vein in the leg or pelvic region. Although this
condition can cause cramping and circulation problems, the more
serious risk is that the blood clot will break off and travel to the
lung — which can be deadly. People who spend prolonged periods
of time sitting (especially in cramped conditions) or lying in bed
are at greater risk of developing DVT. This is a serious and poten-
tially deadly condition that shouldn’t be treated with acupressure.
Pressure on the clot can release it into circulation. Only the profes-
sionally trained should work with this condition. Reflexology can
be used more safely as long as the person is under medical care
and supervision.
 Restless leg syndrome (RLS): This common leg-related problem affects
up to 10 percent of the population at some point in their lives. Although
not deadly, this condition can still be very painful and disruptive to the
people who suffer from it, especially if they have a severe case. The pri-
mary symptoms of RLS are a compulsive urge to move your legs and a
strange sensation — often described as a “creepy crawly” feeling — up
and down the legs. These symptoms occur most often and most severely
when you’re lying down. As a result, getting a good night’s sleep can be
nearly impossible for people with RLS. In Chinese medicine, RLS is con-
sidered a condition that can be addressed by directing unruly qi and
smoothing qi flow. This can be done with acupressure and reflexology. If
you go to a professional, he or she may use Chinese herbs as well.
Caffeine, chocolate, and alcohol frequently worsen the symptoms of
RLS. Likewise, certain prescription medications (such as those used to
treat high blood pressure and depression) can also sometimes increase
the severity of symptoms. If you suffer from RLS, ask your doctor for
advice on which substances you should avoid.
Addressing the Source of Pain
Knowing the source of your pain helps determine where you focus your ses-
sions. For example, if your hip pain is because of poor mechanics of the feet,
your session will include the feet and hips. The bottom line, however, is that
your body has its own healing plans underway. Bringing qi into the area gives
the body more to work with and provides assistance and support.
169
Chapter 10: Healing the Leg and Hip Regions

Several factors can contribute to pain in the leg and hip — or worsen any
pain that already exists:
 Age: With age, the risk of suffering a serious hip injury as a result of
even a “minor” fall increases. The healing powers of the body also
weaken as you age, making the addition of healing qi a welcomed 
support.
 Physical activity: If you’re very active (especially if you suddenly become
much more active than you were previously), you can put strain on your
legs and hips until your body becomes accustomed to this new level of
physical activity. On the other hand, if you’re very inactive, you can also
develop strains due to lack of movement and muscle weakening. Lack of
movement promotes conditions of stagnant qi, such as arthritis and
adhesions. Tonifying techniques can be helpful in these conditions.
 Accidents or injuries: Many leg problems are the result of accidents.
Examples include the broken leg suffered after a skier attempted a really
challenging trail, and the fracture caused by slipping on a patch of ice.
These types of injuries require medical treatment and a necessary recov-
ery period. Speed and completeness of recovery depend on adequate qi
levels. Your acupressure and reflexology skills will be well used here.
 Health conditions: Many conditions can cause pain in the hips and legs,
including arthritis, lupus, diabetes, sprains, fractures, and lots more. In
this case, you need to know the underlying cause to make significant
improvements. Bodywork on the hips and legs in this case will be tem-
porarily relieving, but you need to address the underlying cause to get a
more lasting effect.
 Genetic conditions: Examples of genetic conditions include muscular
dystrophy and congenital deformities. In these cases, bodywork can be
useful to decrease discomfort.
 Lifestyle factors: Participating in many athletic activities, for example,
can increase your risk for leg and hip problems.
 Certain medications: Some medications can increase the likelihood of leg
cramps, swelling, and other painful conditions. Knowing what medications
your receiver is taking is important to avoid unwanted interactions. For
example, because bodywork lowers blood pressure, a healing session can
have an accumulative, synergistic effect on someone taking medication
to lower his or her blood pressure.
Sometimes, tracking down the cause of your hip and leg pain is a challenge.
Of course, if you’ve suffered a broken leg, the cause of your pain is blatantly
obvious. On the other hand, if you’re plagued by a gradually worsening pain
in the lower leg, you may have a tougher time tracking the roots of that 
problem. When you’re trying to determine the cause of leg pain, keep the 
following in mind:
170
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

 Most hip problems are caused by one of three things: a fall or other
injury, a chronic medical problem (such as arthritis), or poor bio-
mechanics from issues of foot, knee, or pelvis alignment.
Because the hips and legs are part of such a complex system of muscles,
bones, joints, ligaments, and other body parts, a problem that originates
in one limited area of the body can quickly start affecting the rest of this
larger region.
 Most knee problems originate in either the hips or the ankles and feet,
unless you suffer a direct trauma, like getting hit in the knee with a ball
or twisting your knee in a fall.
If you’re an athlete, you may have knee problems from overuse, from
pivoting motions, or from repetitive use — doing the same thing over and
over. If you’re not an athlete, you may have knee problems from muscu-
lar imbalance that pulls your knee out of proper alignment. In either
case, when helping ease the discomfort of knee problems, be sure to
work the ankle and hip as well.
Naturally, you want to make your doctor aware of any sudden or severe pain
that you may be experiencing; he or she may be able to help diagnose the
problem and the cause.
Healing Routines for the 
Knees, Hips, and Legs
When practicing bodywork, your best strategy is to look at any complicating
factors you may have, and try to adjust or address those that are under your
control. Treat the underlying causes if you know what they are. Because acu-
pressure and reflexology don’t actually treat diseases or conditions, you’re
treating imbalances of qi. As qi flow becomes more even, the body has access
to its unique healing properties and can maximize its healing efforts. Ask
yourself what feels empty and what feels full. See Chapter 4 for more informa-
tion if needed.
Obviously, you must have realistic expectations. For example, bodywork
alone can’t magically make a broken bone whole again. On the other hand,
adjusting imbalances in your energy flow may help reduce the pain you 
feel from circulation problems by encouraging proper blood flow. Just how
effective healing therapy can be varies greatly depending on the type and
severity of the problem causing your pain.
171
Chapter 10: Healing the Leg and Hip Regions

Getting a leg up with acupressure
Here’s a healing routine to use for knees and hips. The meridians you use are
mostly the gall bladder, bladder, stomach, and spleen. Basically, these points
promote qi flow through the entire leg, so you can use them for any leg ail-
ment you have. They’re great to relieve bursitis, tendonitis, or strains and
sprains. You can use them to support healing, to promote recovery after a
road race or athletic event, or simply to relieve the aches and pains from
standing all day. You can work the acupoints of both joints for a full routine
or work only the points for the joint you want to emphasize. As always, don’t
work directly on an injury, and be sure to get proper medical help for any
problems you have. You can find these points in Tables 10-1 and 10-2 and in
Figures 10-1 and 10-2.

Chapter 10: Healing the Leg and Hip Regions
The legend of stomach 36
There’s an interesting legend about the stomach
36 acupoint. According to the story, a general in
an ancient Chinese army needed his troops to
march a long distance to reach their destina-
tion. They were all tired from fighting and
marching for so many weeks. At some point, 
the army stopped marching — they felt they
couldn’t go any farther. The general ordered his
army doctor to use acupuncture on the stomach
36 point on every soldier. Legend has it that the
troops marched for another 3 miles and reached
their destination. From that day on, the point
was called Three Mile Point.

Here’s a routine that’s often helpful for the legs, knees, and hips. Because the
joints in the legs and hips all affect each other, do all the sequences in Step 3
if possible. If you don’t have time, however, you can use specific sequences
we highlight there for the areas you want to balance.
1. Do your belly breathing while grounding and centering yourself
(refer to Chapter 2).
176
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

2. Stretch your hamstrings (back of the leg), quadriceps (front of the leg),
and the inside of your leg.
If you have a favorite stretch for these areas, use them. If you don’t, here
are some ideas (Hold each stretch for a minimum of 20 seconds and
repeat each three times for the full effect.):
• Sit on the floor with both legs stretched out in front of you. Lift
your arms over your head and bend forward, over your out-
stretched legs. Try to keep your back straight and lean out over
your leg rather than folding your upper body. You can assist the
stretch by grasping your toes with your hands. If you can’t reach,
use a towel; hold both ends and make a sling around your feet.
• Stretch the inside of your legs by sitting with your legs out-
stretched and opened as wide as you can. Take your arms over
your head and lean forward as far as you comfortably can between
your open legs. Keep your back straight. You can push your hips
out behind you to get a better stretch on your inner thighs.
• To stretch the quadriceps, lie on your side. Flex the knee of your
top leg, moving your foot to your buttocks. Reach back and grasp
your ankle, pulling it toward your buttocks to improve the stretch.
Repeat on the other side.
3. Using the bilateral approach or working one meridian at a time — bal-
ance the points by using sustained pressure to tonify the empty points
or pulsating pressure to disperse the full points (refer to Chapter 4) —
follow these sequences:
• To address problems in the hip joints and buttocks as well as
problems with the outside of the knee, such as lateral collateral
ligament (LCL) strains, hold GB 29 or 30 (whichever is more sore);
press and release GB 31 and 34. This set of points is geared to the
buttocks, pelvis, and the outside of the thigh.
• To focus on the low back and sacrum (which affect the hips and
legs and vice versa) and/or to relieve pain at the back of the
knee, hold B 28; press and release B 48, B 54, and B 57.
Always remember to treat the back of the knee with care and use
light pressure on B 54.
• To address the inside of the leg and knee and ease medial knee
problems, such as sprains in the medial collateral ligament
(MCL), hold St 36; press and release Sp 6, Sp 8, and Sp 10.
4. End the session by lying quietly on your back, or sitting comfortably
in a chair, with one hand on your lower abdomen and one hand on
your solar plexus.
Relax and allow the benefits of the session to sink in.
177
Chapter 10: Healing the Leg and Hip Regions

Dancing to the beat of a different 
reflexology routine
This reflexology routine helps alleviate pain in the hips and knees:
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing exer-
cises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Warm, stretch, and open your feet by first rolling your foot back and
forth in your hand, and then stripping your foot from top to bottom
(see Chapter 4 for an explanation of this technique).
Repeat three or four times to reduce restrictions.
5. Wrap your middle fingers over the top of your foot and place your
thumbs on the sole of your foot. Gently push your foot up into dorsi-
flexion (toes up), and then pull it down into plantar flexion (toes
down).
Repeat this motion several times, rhythmically pumping your foot. This
stimulates the reflex points along the top of the ankle and moves qi.
6. Move your thumbs down to your heel and do thumb-walking along the
reflex points for hips, sciatica, and knees (see Figure 10-3).
• If any spots are sore, use circular motions to work them out.
• If any joints are inflamed, be sure to thumb-walk up the lymphatic
strip along the outside of the foot, followed by circular motions on
sore areas.
7. Do circular motions on the reflex area for the adrenal glands to work
out any sluggishness.
Stimulating the adrenal glands also promotes healing; the reflex points
for the adrenal glands are located on the inside of the arch of the foot.
8. Repeat with the other foot.
9. Relax.

Relieving Backaches
In This Chapter
 Analyzing back problems
 Figuring out why your back hurts
 Treating your aching back
 Taming back tension
F
ortunately for most people, back pain is usually a temporary, limited-
time thing, often brought on by strenuous activity or overexertion. Some
unlucky souls, however, must cope with back pain constantly. This can make
every day seem like an endless struggle with pain and tension in the back.
Depending on the specific type of back problem, you may have difficulty
doing even the simplest things, like sitting down or lying down in bed.
Many people are relieved to discover how effective acupressure and reflexology
can be in reducing or eliminating their back pain. In this chapter, we help you
figure out the source of your back pain so that you can apply acupressure safely
and use the most effective points. Some causes of pain, like muscle tension,
respond well to good stretching and deep pressure on the involved acupoints.
Other causes, such as a herniated disc, require gentle stretching and less 
pressure. In all cases, acupressure and reflexology are great tools for back care.
Use them together or individually to reduce the pain of muscle tension, aid 
the recovery of torn muscles or injured discs, reduce the stiffness of arthritis,
relieve pressure on compressed nerves, and reduce or even eliminate pain. In
this chapter, we explain just how the healing arts can help, and we provide a few
healing routines to nip your pain in the bud (or at least give you a bit of relief!).
Understanding the Origins of Back Pain
“Back pain” is kind of a catchall term for pain, discomfort, or tenderness any-
where in the spinal region, or even sometimes in the hips, neck, and shoul-
ders. In this chapter, though, we focus specifically on pain in the spinal area.
We focus on other regions (hips, neck, and so on) in other parts of this book
so that we can help you zero in on the techniques that will best target your
particular pain.

Because the back takes up such a large part of your body, it makes sense that
many specific types of problems can cause problems in this region. The fol-
lowing list outlines those specific types of problems:
 Accidents and injuries: In some cases, you may be able to pinpoint the
exact moment your back began hurting. In these cases, tracing the cause
of the pain may be easy. For example, if you begin experiencing pain in
your upper back immediately after a strenuous basketball game, the
reason for your pain is pretty obvious. On the other hand, sometimes
the event that appears to cause the pain is really just a “precipitating
incident,” the final straw that breaks the camel’s back. In this case, you
usually have an underlying problem. Underlying problems can lie dor-
mant for long periods of time until a little extra exertion reveals their
presence. The extra exertion doesn’t have to be too much; bending
down to pick up a sock, falling asleep on a soft couch, or opening a 
sticking sliding door.
 Impairments or abnormalities in the back: Sometimes you don’t need
to look very far to find the root of your back pain. Some common causes
of back pain include pinched nerves, herniated or ruptured disks, arthri-
tis, muscle spasms, and abnormal curvature of the back.
With these types of conditions, a doctor is often able to diagnose the
problem through a variety of tests, possibly including an MRI or a CAT
scan. The doctor may then be able to recommend a treatment plan that
may help alleviate some of your pain. In severe cases, surgery may be
necessary. (Fortunately, back pain rarely requires such extreme mea-
sures.) However, trying acupressure and reflexology while you’re pursu-
ing your treatment plan can be beneficial in relieving pain.
 Problems in other areas of the body: In some cases, the source of your
back pain may not be quite so obvious. And for good reason — the pain
may not actually be originating in your back at all. Organ dysfunction
often refers pain into the back. For example, gall bladder and liver prob-
lems refer pain between the right shoulder blade and spine in the rhom-
boid muscles. Bladder trouble can refer into the sacral iliac joint, and
pancreas issues can refer into the left mid and upper back. According to
the basic principles of acupressure and reflexology, you may be feeling
pain in one area of your body and it can travel along the meridian to
another area. If you suspect organ dysfunction as the cause of your back
pain, get a medical diagnosis before using alternative techniques. When
you know what the problem is and are receiving proper treatment and
care, you can use acupressure and reflexology to relieve discomfort and
assist energy flow through the problem area.
182
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

If you don’t have an injury or illness that could be affecting your back and
you’re trying to figure out what’s causing your back pain, think about where —
and how — you sit. Spending long periods of time on a hard chair or bench
can frequently trigger backaches. Poor biomechanics in your workstation,
poor posture, shoes, and repetitive actions can all contribute to your discom-
fort. Also, if you often have large and/or bulky items in your back pockets 
(a wallet, tools, and so on), they can cause you to sit unevenly, or sitting on
them can compress the piriformis muscle causing sciatica and pain. Although
acupressure and reflexology can help, the benefits won’t last until the cause 
is removed.
Treating Your Aching Back
The bladder meridian is your highway to heaven if you experience back pain,
because it’s the main meridian flowing through your back. It begins at the
inside of the orbit of your eye, travels over the top of your head, and down
your back and legs to the outside of your little toe. It’s the longest meridian in
your body and takes a few strange curves along its path. For instance, when
the bladder meridian reaches the base of your neck, it splits in two, sending
two branches down each side of the back. The branches track the big muscle
group, the erector spinae, that runs next to your spine and helps keep your
back straight. One branch of the bladder meridian travels on the inside of
this muscle group, between the muscle and your spine; the other branch
travels on the outside of this muscle group. Not surprisingly, they’re called
the inner and outer branches of the bladder meridian.
Okay, we can just about manage a split in the line, but here’s the rub:
Different systems number the lines differently! Some systems number the
inside line and then go down the leg to the knee before coming back up to 
get the outside line. Other systems, like the one we use, number the inside
line, and then the outside line, and then travel down the leg. It doesn’t really
matter to the routines you’re doing, but if you look things up in other places,
you need to know about this numbering problem.
The points in Table 11-1 help in alleviating pain in the upper/middle back,
shoulders, and neck. In Table 11-2, you discover points for helping with low
back pain and sciatica. Figure 11-1 shows the points for both tables.
When you look at Tables 11-1 and 11-2, you may wonder what those points
are that are in parentheses. They’re the numbers for the points used in the
alternate numbering system. You can ignore them; we put them there in case
you’re also referencing other books while you learn acupressure.

points along the back. Also, if you aren’t sure what a chon is (or how to
measure it), refer to Chapter 3.

Acupressure routine to relieve 
back tension and pain
Here’s a great routine to relieve stress and muscle tension along the whole
back. At the end we add some specific points for sciatic pain and for assisting
disk healing. Before starting, be sure that you have a sock filled with two
tennis balls or your tools for reaching back points (see Chapter 2). Also,
you’ll be using the points in Table 11-2, which you can locate in Figure 11-1.
1. Do your belly breathing while grounding and centering.
2. Do stretches for the bladder meridian and back.
Use your favorite back stretch or use either one of these stretches:
• Stand with your legs open to shoulder width.
Inhale and raise your arms over your head, gently leaning 
backward and stretching the front of your body.
Exhale and bend forward, reaching your hands to the floor. Try to
place your hands flat on the floor, raising your head to increase the
stretch along your bladder meridian.
Hang like a rag doll, breathing normally, and bouncing gently as
you relax all the muscles in your back.
Stretch to the right side, leaning over the right leg and holding the
stretch for 20 seconds. Then walk your hands across the floor to
your left leg and stretch over your left leg, holding it for 20 seconds.
187
Chapter 11: Relieving Backaches

• Sit on the floor with your legs together, stretched out in front 
of you.
Lift your arms over your head while inhaling, and then exhale and
bend forward, over your outstretched legs. Try to keep your back
straight and lean out over your leg rather than folding your upper
body. You can assist the stretch by grasping your toes with your
hands. If you can’t reach, use a towel; hold both ends and make a
sling around your feet.
3. Work all the points on both the inside and outside bladder lines.
You can work these points in several ways:
• Use your tennis ball sock tool while lying on your back by 
following these directions:
Lie on your back and place your tennis ball sock under your neck.
Bend your legs so that your feet are flat on the floor. Gently raise
your hips and back off the floor, so that you’re balancing your
weight on the tennis balls.
Walk yourself up the tennis balls, so that they put pressure on your
bladder points.
Stop wherever you’re sore and rock back and forth on the balls to
work the tension out.
When you finish the inside bladder line, untie the sock and re-tie 
it so that the tennis balls are more loosely held together. They
should have enough room to separate and reach both outer blad-
der lines, just on the outside of the erector muscles on both sides
of the spine.
• You can use your tennis ball sock tool while standing by follow-
ing these directions:
Stand against a wall with your legs wider than shoulder width
apart, knees bent at a 90 degree angle, as if you’re sitting on an
imaginary chair.
Lean forward and place the tennis ball sock under your shoulders
along the inside bladder line.
Lean against the sock as you slowly straighten your legs, moving
different parts of your back over the balls. As before, stop wher-
ever you have soreness and roll up and down, massaging these
points with the balls.
Repeat for the outside bladder line.
188
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

• You can also work these points while sitting in a chair with a 
tall back.
Start with the sock under your neck; roll around to relieve tension.
Lean forward just a bit and let the balls fall down your back.
Remember how close the bladder points are to each other, and
don’t let the balls fall more than an inch.
Lean back and roll around on these new spots.
Continue leaning forward and rolling until you’ve covered the
whole back.
Do the same with the outside bladder line.
• You can use your back massage tool with the curved handle 
and the knobby end.
Place the knobby end on the bladder points and stimulate each
individually. This method may take some time, so hang out only
with the points that are really sore!
4. Create even more relief by using the points in Tables 11-1 and 11-2
with the method of your choice — bilateral or one meridian at a time
(check out Chapter 4 for more info).
You don’t need to hold every point, just the ones that are calling you.
And don’t forget to try these on a friend too.
Reflexology for back stress and pain
The following reflexology routine can be effective in alleviating back pain and
stiffness. You use the reflex areas included in Figure 11-2.
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing 
exercises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold 
your foot in your lap.
4. Warm, stretch, and open your feet by first rolling your foot back and
forth in your hand, and then stripping your foot from top to bottom.
Repeat three or four times to reduce restrictions.
189
Chapter 11: Relieving Backaches

5. Move your thumbs down to your heel and do thumb-walking along the
reflex points for the entire spine and the sciatic nerve (see Figure 11-2).
The spine is the narrow strip on the inside of your foot running from
your heel to your toe. The heel portion of the strip represents the small
of your back; the middle part, in the arch of your foot, represents your
waist; the upper part of the strip before your big toe represents your
upper back. The base of the toes represents your neck. You find the sci-
atic nerve on the heel.
6. If any spots are sore, use circular motions to work them out.
7. If any of the joints are inflamed, be sure to thumb-walk up the lym-
phatic strip along the outside of the foot, followed by circular motions
on sore areas.
8. Repeat with the other foot.
9. Relax by lying quietly and feeling the flow of energy along your back.
You may notice heat or tingling as qi flow balances.

Relief for Hurting Heads 
(And Pains in the Neck)
In This Chapter
 Realizing how common headaches are
 Knowing that stress can trigger head and neck pain
 Getting relief for pain in the eyes and ears
 Alleviating painful jaw problems
T
he area of your body above your shoulders occupies a relatively small
portion of your total body, yet it’s home to a considerable number of the
chronic and painful conditions that plague people every day.
Maybe you have that headache that seems to strike almost every afternoon
like clockwork, usually after a long and stressful day on the job. Or perhaps
you have that dull pain in your jaw that strikes so often that you just take it
for granted. Or maybe you’ve been plagued with earaches for as long as you
can remember. For a relatively small area, the head and neck region has the
potential to cause all sorts of painful problems that can really affect your
quality of life in a negative way.
That’s the bad news. The good news is that because so many of the problems
in this area are related to excess muscle tension and vascular imbalance,
they respond very well to acupressure and reflexology. Acupressure points 
in this area are easy to access and require very little pressure to impact. In
fact, a lot of people rely on bodywork to provide the much-needed relief from
these painful conditions that allows them to enjoy a relatively comfortable
and happy life. In this chapter, we tell you about the most common problems
associated with these parts of the body, and you learn techniques that can
help you deal with the pain these problems can cause.

Going Whole Head: Treating 
the Entire Extremity
How do you deal with everyday tasks and responsibilities when your head
and/or neck is killing you? Not very easily. And not with your usual care and
attention, most likely. Pain in these areas is particularly disruptive because 
it can totally destroy your ability to concentrate and focus on the things you
need to do. In addition, pain anywhere in your head or neck may affect your
vision, hearing, and other senses that are necessary for you to absorb and
process basic information, which is why we provide treatments for those spe-
cific areas later in this chapter. Bottom line: Head and neck pain can really
wreak havoc on your life. So in this section, we take a closer look at the types
of problems involved — and, more importantly, how you can deal with them.

People suffer from many different types of headaches, and those headaches
have just as many different causes. The basic cause of a headache is gener-
ally the constriction of blood vessels and muscles (mainly in the head),
which sends pain to the affected area. In some cases — especially with sinus
headaches — the pain may be caused by an infection or injury. Of course,
emotional stress, anxiety, depression, and other situational factors can also
cause (or worsen) a headache.
 Tension headache: As the name implies, this type of headache often
seems to be triggered by stress or frustration. The pain associated with
a tension headache can vary from dull to severe, and is often described
as a pressing or squeezing sensation. These headaches are usually
caused by excess muscle tension in the neck, which presses on nerves,
causing nerve pain, and presses on arteries, decreasing circulation into
the head, which causes more pain. Acupressure and reflexology help by
reducing muscle tension, taking pressure off nerve endings, and increas-
ing circulation.
Tension headaches are extremely common. In fact, close to 80 percent 
of the population experiences a tension headache at some point in their
life, according to the National Headache Foundation.

 Migraine headache: This is a severe headache that can often be debili-
tating, making it almost impossible to function normally. When suffering
with a migraine headache, people may be nauseous or dizzy and experi-
ence severe pain on one or both sides of the head. Frequently, they’re
also very sensitive to noise and bright lights. Some evidence suggests
that migraines may be hereditary. Migraine headaches are triggered 
by many things, including stress, hormone imbalance, pulsating light,
foods, caffeine, alcohol, allergies, and more. The cause of these
headaches is vascular — either too much or too little blood flow in 
the head — as opposed to tension. However, extreme muscle tension 
in the neck can disrupt blood flow to the head, contributing to the onset
of a migraine. Many times, migraines are initiated by multiple triggers.
Acupressure and reflexology help by balancing the circulation and
reducing stress and muscle tension. The balancing effect of acupressure
and reflexology on hormones may also be helpful.
According to the National Headache Foundation, one in four American
households contains a migraine sufferer.
 Sinus headache: Sinus headaches are often brought on by a sinus 
infection, allergies, or related conditions. Not surprisingly, this type 
of headache involves pain close to the sinuses (nose, cheekbones, 
forehead) and can cause teeth pain, frontal headaches, and eye pain.
Acupressure and reflexology can help in the longer term by supporting
the immune system to fight the infection. In the short term, they help 
by reducing pain through the release of endorphins and by opening the
sinuses to drain.
 Cluster headache: This type of headache gets its name from the fact
that the headaches tend to come in groups. This is a very intense type of
headache that often comes in a series (a person may experience several
headaches within a day or two). It often involves excruciating pain
behind or around one eye, possibly radiating to the temple on the same
side, and may include a drooping eyelid. This headache is considered
one of the worst types of pain and, like migraines, may include vomiting
and sensitivity to light. Cluster headaches occur at the exact same time
of the day on consecutive days or the same time and day, one week later.
No one knows what causes them, but the regularity and timing suggest
that they’re related to a person’s biological clock, or circadian rhythm.
The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle of changing physiologic
processes that relate to sunlight and season.
Headaches may be common, but that doesn’t mean they should be taken
lightly, especially when they seem unusual for any reason. Some signs of 
trouble include dizziness, nausea, vision problems, and slurred speech. If 
you experience any of these symptoms with a headache — especially in the
193
Chapter 12: Relief for Hurting Heads (And Pains in the Neck)

case of a very severe headache, or one that comes on suddenly — you
should seek medical treatment right away. Likewise, you should consult a
doctor about any headaches that follow a fall, head injury, or other trauma 
to the head or neck area.
Understanding the cause of neck pain
Go a little lower down the body, and you have the neck. It can be a great 
body part in many ways. It’s a great showcase that conveniently displays 
the sparkling new necklace you love so much. And it’s also the perfect spot
for that beloved youngster in your life to wrap her arms around you for a
goodnight hug.
Unfortunately, discomfort and soreness are also pretty common in this area.
Sometimes you have pain due to something minor, perhaps even silly. Maybe
you fell asleep while leaning over the side of your favorite recliner. Sure you
may have slept like a baby, but a careless move like that can leave you paying
the price (and rubbing your sore neck) for days.
Neck pain occurs for lots of different reasons, ranging from the small (sleep-
ing funny) to the serious (arthritis, meningitis, and other unpleasant things).
Injuries, accidents, and muscle strains are also common causes of neck pain.
If you experience neck pain, be sure to stay alert for any unusual signs of pos-
sible trouble. These signs could include any sudden loss of bladder or bowel
function/control (which indicates neurological problems). Another red flag? A
stiff neck that triggers pain when you drop your chin to your chest can some-
times indicate meningitis. If your neck pain is accompanied by numbness or
shooting pain that extends down the arms or legs, it can also be a sign of seri-
ous problems that need to be addressed right away. If you experience any of
these situations, see your doctor immediately.
Finding relief in the head and neck 
region: It’s all in the yang points
All the points in the head and neck are yang points and tend to have excess
energy. Yang meridians are the meridians that start in the head and face, trav-
eling down the back of the body and backs of the arms. Almost all points
194
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

above the collarbone in the front and above the shoulders in the back are on
yang meridians. This means that they’re likely to be active and full of qi. For a
full discussion on the difference between yin and yang points, see Chapter 1.
In this section, we provide a routine to address all those nasty headaches we
talk about in this chapter and the neck pain that often causes them. The dif-
ferent types of headaches have many common features, and their pain can be
relieved by the following routine. Figures 12-1, 12-2, and 12-3 show you where
these points reside, and Table 12-1 explains what each point does and how
you find it.

Fibromyalgia can be a real pain in the neck
If you frequently experience pain in the neck
(and possibly the shoulders, elbows, knees, and
upper back) and can’t seem to figure out what’s
causing it, perhaps you may be suffering from
fibromyalgia.
Fibromyalgia is a syndrome in which the person
(most commonly a woman) experiences diffused
pain, fatigue, and a wide range of other symptoms,
such as irritable bowel. The pain generally is most
severe on 18 specific spots (commonly referred to
as “tender points” because even the slightest
touch can be painful), and then radiates out from
that point into a more general region of the body.
A person must have pain in at least 11 of the
tender spots to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia.
The pain of fibromyalgia often occurs in the
shoulders and neck. It’s not accompanied by
any swelling or lumps, but you may have some
stiffness in the affected areas. People with
fibromyalgia often also have insomnia, fatigue,
and other sleep-related problems.
The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown — and,
unfortunately, it has no cure. However, many
people find relief from their symptoms through
bodywork, massage, chiropractic treatment, and
over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers.

Controversy surrounds the diagnosis, treatment,
and even existence of fibromyalgia. Until 20
years ago, the symptoms were thought to be all
in the head of the sufferer. Even today many
doctors don’t recognize it as a legitimate condi-
tion, because it’s diagnosed based on a set of
symptoms that aren’t related to a physiological
cause. However, current research indicates
that fibromyalgia may be a problem with the
way the person’s nerve cells transmit pain sig-
nals. Further research is needed to determine
the cause of the syndrome before the medical
community will fully recognize this debilitating
chronic condition.

In the following routine, use the alternating pressure technique that we
explain in Chapter 4 to disperse the energy in these points. If you don’t have
time for all the points, jump to the end of the routine, where we provide mini-
sessions for specific types of headaches.
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (refer to Chapter 2).
2. Stretch out any overwork and tension by following these steps:
• Wrap a towel around your neck for support.
• Stretch by rolling in a full circle, three times in both directions.
• Stop anywhere it feels sore and hold the stretch for 20 seconds.
199
Chapter 12: Relief for Hurting Heads (And Pains in the Neck)

3. Use the points in Table 12-1, starting with bilateral holds on GB 21, 
GB 20, and GB 12.
4. Fan your fingers and press all the GB points (6–11) that wrap around
the ear together.
Press and release these points until they lose their soreness.
5. Bilaterally hold B 10.
6. Fan your fingers and press the bladder points that go over the top of
the head (B 3–9).
Hold as many at one time as you can, pressing and releasing these
points until they lose their soreness. Keep moving along the line until
you’ve pressed all the points. Repeat the entire line of bladder points at
least three times.
7. Bilaterally hold GB 14, B 2, LI 20, and TW 16.
8. Alternately hold LI 4 on each hand.
9. Use the following mini-healing sessions for specific headaches:
• Tension Headache: Use bilateral pressure on GB 21, GB 20, and 
GB 12; fan your fingers over GB 6–11 and then over B 3–9, working
these points bilaterally. End holding LI 4 alternately on each hand.
This mini-session reduces tension in the neck and head muscles
that can cause tension headaches.
• Migraine Headache: Bilaterally press B 10, TW 16, and GB 12. Fan
your fingers over GB 6–11, compressing and releasing until sensi-
tivity diminishes. Don’t use too much pressure on these points 
or hold them for too long. End by pressing GB 14, followed by LI 4
on each hand. This helps balance blood flow into the head and 
regulates gall bladder qi. (If you’re experiencing nausea with your
migraine headache, HP 6 is a great anti-nausea point. Although 
we don’t show it in this routine, you can find it in the routine in
Chapter 6, and locate it in Figure 6-2.)
• Sinus Headache: Use bilateral pressure on GB 20 and GB 17. Go back
and forth on these points until they feel soft and have less soreness.
Then press the following points bilaterally: SI 18, LI 20, St 1, B 1, B 2,
and GB 14. End with LI 4 on each hand. This pattern helps relieve the
pain of a sinus headache and opens the sinuses to drain.
• Cluster Headache: The points that are sore in a cluster headache
can be so tender that you don’t want to touch them, so you can
choose points above and below the pain to balance nerve and 
vascular function. On the side of your pain, hold GB 14 with GB 20;
then hold B 2 with B 10. Fan your fingers over GB 6–11. End with LI
4 on both hands. If the pain is clustered around your eyes, check
out Table 12-2 for help with eyestrain.
10. Whatever session you do, end with 5 to 10 minutes of relaxation, or
more if you have time.
200
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

Relaxing allows the qi and blood flow to balance and stabilize before you
become active again, and gives you time to appreciate those pain-relieving
endorphins.
Relief for Eyestrain
Eyestrain can cause minor eye problems — such as blurred vision, pain in
the muscles around the eyes, night blindness, and other conditions — that
can be not only painful, but also very disruptive. Think about how much you
rely on your eyes for virtually everything you do, throughout the entire day.
Even a minor eye problem can really make your life much more challenging
and frustrating than it needs to be.
Fortunately, simple strain and overexertion are often temporary and easily
treated.
Eye problems that come on severely and suddenly should be monitored
closely — especially if their onset coincides with other troublesome signs
like slurred speech or a severe headache.
In the following routine, you use the points included in Table 12-2 and located
in Figures 12-2 and 12-3, which we include earlier in the chapter.

Use this routine to alleviate the discomfort associated with eyestrain:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Look up, look down, look all around.
Exercise your eyes by looking as far as you can to the left, to the right,
up, and then down. Do this slowly and really stretch your eye muscles.
Afterward, slowly roll your eyes in a clockwise direction, and then in a
counterclockwise direction.
3. Locate the pressure points in Table 12-2 for clear vision:
• Use a bilateral hold on each point.
• Spend as much time as you need to release each point.
• When you’re finished, rub your hands briskly together and place
your palms over your eyes for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Relax to allow the qi to balance and to let the tension drain from
your eyes, fully receiving the benefits of the session.
Toning Down Tinnitus and 
Other Ear Problems
Ear problems are another fairly common source of pain and discomfort.
Some typical causes of pain include the following:
202
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

 Wax and fluid: Fluid in the ear can be the source of uncomfortable pres-
sure imbalances, especially when flying, or even traveling up a large hill.
A variety of over-the-counter treatments can help eliminate fluid and
wax in the ear. Ear infections and more serious problems need to be
treated by your doctor.
 Tinnitus: Tinnitus is a distracting and debilitating ringing or rushing
sound in the ears. The cause of tinnitus is often unknown, although it
can be a symptom of a more serious problem; acupressure and reflexol-
ogy have been helpful in reducing the annoying sounds.
 Loss of balance and vertigo: Loss of balance can be due to fluid in the
ear or disruption of normal fluid movement in the inner ear. Vertigo is a
very debilitating condition where the room appears to be spinning, caus-
ing loss of balance, nausea, and disorientation.
Although medical treatment is usually necessary or helpful for ear problems,
acupressure and reflexology techniques can prove to be a helpful addition in
alleviating pain and noises in your ear(s).
If you experience ear pain accompanied by any type of discharge or bleeding
from the ear, or any redness or swelling in the area around the ear, seek med-
ical treatment right away.
In this section, you use the points included in Table 12-3, and illustrated in
Figures 12-1 and 12-3, which we include earlier in this chapter.

• When you’re finished, rub your hands briskly together and hold
them over your ears for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Relax by sitting or lying quietly while the qi you have stimulated
balances the area.

Getting Cheeky and Chomping 
on Jaw Pain
Sure, you’ve probably heard the expression, “Put on a happy face.” But trying
to look happy can be nearly impossible when your face seems to be working
against you. If you have pain in the facial area, a smile may seem like an
impossible dream. Luckily, we have some techniques that may just help you
turn that frown upside down.
In addition to your run-of-the-mill facial tension (think back to all those 
prom photos you had to smile endlessly for and the cheek exhaustion 
you may have felt afterward), many people experience jaw pain. TMJ 
is the abbreviation for the temporomandibular joint, commonly known 
as the jaw joint. You have a TMJ joint on each side of your face. It con-
nects your jaw to your skull and allows your jaw the mobility it needs 
in order to talk, chew, and make pretty much any other kind of facial 
movement.
Although the term technically refers to the joint itself, TMJ is also the
umbrella term commonly used to refer to several conditions involving the
jaw and surrounding muscles and tissues. It can be tough to diagnose TMJ
conditions, though, because pain in the jaw and facial region can be caused
by many different things, including headaches, ear problems, dental prob-
lems, and others. In addition to pain in the jaw joint, a common symptom 
of TMJ conditions is a clicking or popping noise when opening and closing
the mouth.
Doctors believe that stress can often be partially responsible for TMJ or for
worsening its symptoms. For example, if a person tends to grind his jaw or
clench his teeth when he’s angry or stressed, it takes its toll on the jaw area
and may trigger TMJ conditions.
Muscle tension can pull on the joints, stress can cause teeth grinding 
that wears on the joint, and arthritis in the joint can produce pain.
Acupressure and reflexology have been very successful in reducing the 
symptoms of TMJ. Table 12-4 explains some helpful acupoints for treating
facial pain; you can locate these points in Figures 12-2 and 12-3, earlier in 
this chapter.

The following routine includes points that reduce muscle tension around the
joint and disperse stagnant qi contributing to arthritis. All the points are
stress reducing as well.
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Exercise your face by following these steps:
• First, contract all the muscles in your face; scrunch up your
mouth, your eyes, and your forehead. Squeeze all the muscles as
tight at you can.
• Then open everything as wide as you can; open your mouth,
stretch your lips, widen your eyes.
3. Follow these steps to get a good stretch:
• Relax and place your hands over the sides of your face, covering as
much of your face as you can.
• Pull your skin upward, and then downward; forward, and then back-
ward. Hold each stretched position for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
4. Bilaterally hold each of the points in Table 12-4.
5. Briskly rub your hands together and place them over your face for 
1 to 3 minutes.
6. Relax to receive the greatest benefit while allowing qi flow to balance.

Reflexology for the Head, 
Face, and Neck
Reflexology can be very helpful in alleviating many types of pain in the head,
neck, and face. Here’s an easy routine to try:
1. Wash and dry your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing 
exercises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Use the reflex areas on the foot for the shoulders, neck, head, ears,
eyes, lymphatic strip, and face (see Figure 12-4).

5. Press and massage the pads of your foot at the base of each toe, and
then pull out to the end of the toes.
6. Thumb-walk and use circular motions all along the pads of the foot
and toes to detect and release any imbalances.

Lending a Hand (And Arm 
and Shoulder, Too!)
In This Chapter
 Zooming in on shoulder ailments
 Alleviating elbow problems
 Easing the pain of arthritis
 Helping hands and fingers
Your arms and shoulders perform countless stressful tasks throughout
the day — examples include typing on the computer, sewing, playing
baseball, ironing, and more. Most people use their hands for things that
involve repetitive motions, especially when they’re on the job. Repetitive
motions can be especially tough on the hands and fingers, and they can lead
to specific painful conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, while also
aggravating existing conditions like arthritis.
Unfortunately, if you’re like most people, you can’t spend a few days refrain-
ing from using your arms or hands to give them a chance to recover from
stress or injury. As a result, you further aggravate whatever problem caused
the initial pain.
Discomfort in the hands and arms can make even the simplest daily tasks 
difficult and exhausting. Imagine trying to open a medicine bottle if your fin-
gers are in serious pain. Or the sadness of being unable to lift your precious
grandchild because your shoulder hurts too much.
Fortunately, we have some good news. By employing some acupressure and
reflexology techniques, you can likely see considerable improvement in your
arms and hands. And that opens up a whole new world of possibilities by
allowing you to enjoy activities that may have been off-limits because they
caused discomfort. If you’re unsure of the root of your arm and hand pain,
discuss it with your doctor, who may be able to determine the cause (and
thus suggest some helpful treatment options).

Shouldering the Burden
Shoulder pain can have many different causes. The most common cause is
muscle tension, often involving the trapezius, the muscle that pulls your
shoulders to your ears when you’re stressed out; the rhomboids, the muscles
that pull the shoulder blade back; and the pectoralis muscles, which fight with
the rhomboids to hunch the shoulders forward. (When that happens, your
shoulders get caught in the middle!) Because the rhomboids are located on
the back and the pectoralis muscles are on the chest, we provide routines for
those aches in Chapters 11 and 15, respectively. The routine in this chapter
effectively relieves the trapezius muscle, which most directly applies to your
shoulder area.
Rotator cuff injuries and bursitis are two more conditions that can be
improved with this routine. The rotator cuff muscles are a group of four mus-
cles that rotate the shoulder, a ball and socket joint that can move in a full
circle, through its range of motion. The more motion a joint has, the less
stable it is, so these muscles work hard to provide both motion and stability.
Common causes for rotator cuff injuries are overuse, repetitive use, and
overextension. These are also the most common causes of bursitis, in which
the bursa — the fluid-filled sacs inside the joint that protect the bones of the
joint from rubbing against each other — become inflamed. The result?
Excessive pain and discomfort and limited range of motion.
210
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 
Don’t let a frozen shoulder 
leave you out in the cold
Ever heard of a frozen shoulder? No, it’s not
what you get after a vicious snowball fight.
Frozen shoulder is, in fact, a very serious and
painful condition of the joint capsule causing
pain and immobility of the shoulder. It’s called
frozen shoulder because it consists of limited
range of motion in the joint. Usually the person
can’t lift the arm even to shoulder level in any
direction. The exact cause is unknown; it can
happen from an injury, overextending the arm,
sitting down too hard in a chair, and so on.
Sometimes it’s the result of the area being
immobilized for an extended period, such as
after an accident or injury. It generally afflicts
only one shoulder, and is more common among
people who are middle-aged or older, and more
common among women than men.
A frozen shoulder usually resolves in time; on
average, it takes about six months. Physical
therapy exercises to help release adhesions,
lubricate the joint capsule, and strengthen sur-
rounding muscles are very helpful. People with
frozen shoulder often find relief with acupres-
sure. Nourishing qi helps lubricate the joint and
release muscle tension. Pain is often reduced
and mobility increased after an acupressure
session. The shoulders can also be worked with
reflex areas on the feet or hand to stimulate the
healing process.

The acupressure and reflexology routines in this chapter alleviate muscle 
tension and can speed the recovery time of these injuries. They increase cir-
culation to the area and stimulate the body’s healing processes. Increased
circulation brings all the ingredients the body needs to heal and takes away
the products of inflammation that get in the way of tissue repair.
You can use the healing techniques of acupressure to assist (and possibly
prevent) some common shoulder problems. Use the points included in Table
13-1 and illustrated in Figure 13-1.

Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

The following acupressure routine helps relieve stress, tension, and pain in
the shoulders:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (refer to Chapter 2).
2. Stretch the meridians in the front and sides of the arms by following
these steps:
• Stand with your feet shoulder-width — or farther — apart.
• Bend your knees slightly.
• Breathe in while raising your arms to shoulder level, with your
palms down. Continue breathing in while spreading your arms
backward at shoulder blade level and rotating your hands to a
palms-up position. Reach your thumbs toward the floor behind
you without bending backward.
• Exhale and relax, bringing your arms back to your sides.
• Repeat three times.
3. Stretch the meridians in the back of the arm and shoulder meridians
by following these steps:
• Clasp your hands together and raise them in front of you at shoul-
der height.
• Swing side to side in time with your breathing, stretching your
arms as you swing.
4. Select the shoulder that needs the most care, and then use your 
opposite hand to press the points on the shoulder in the following
sequences:
• GB 21, LI 16, LI 15, and LI 14.
• SI 12, SI 11, and SI 10.
• Use sustained pressure on points that feel empty, and use alternat-
ing pressure on points that feel full. Repeat each sequence several
times until the points feel less painful.
5. Repeat Step 4 with the other shoulder.
6. You can continue the session with points for the elbows and hands, or
relax and enjoy the free flow of energy through your shoulders.
Tennis Elbow, Anyone?
If you’re an athlete or if you work with your arms and hands, you’re a candidate
for elbow problems. Roofers, carpenters, road workers, tennis players, lacrosse
players, and even baseball players are subject to this problem. Repetitive use of
the elbow contributes to both tennis elbow and golfer’s elbow.
213
Chapter 13: Lending a Hand (And Arm and Shoulder, Too!)

Tennis elbow is the common name for lateral epicondylitis. This condition
affects the tendons on the outside of the elbow. It’s the most common injury
that results in elbow pain. Although nobody knows exactly what causes it,
you’re most likely to get it through repetitive use of your elbow.
If you’re a golfer, you may be familiar with another, less frequent elbow strain:
golfer’s elbow. Golfer’s elbow is the common name for medial epicondylitis and
affects the tendons of the inside of the elbow. It’s also caused by repetitive use.
Acupressure can help bring circulation and healing qi to elbow issues. We list
acupressure points for the elbow in Table 13-2 and show them in Figures 13-1
and 13-2. If you’re unfamiliar with using a chon as a measurement, check out
Chapter 3 for details.

The funny bone: No laughing matter
It may have a humorous-sounding name, but to
anyone who’s ever suffered an injury to the
area, the funny bone is anything but comical.
The funny bone (or olecranon, as it’s officially
called) is an area of your elbow that seems to
be particularly vulnerable to bumps and other
injuries. It can also be the site of a painful con-
dition called olecranon bursitis, which causes
symptoms like tingling, pain, and swelling in the
elbow region.

Here’s a routine that can help address elbow problems. If you’re adding the
elbow points on to the shoulder-freeing routine from the earlier “Shouldering
the Burden” section, start right in. If you’re skipping the shoulder-freeing rou-
tine points, go back and do Steps 1, 2, and 3 in that routine before starting the
elbow tendon points in this routine.
1. Start with the elbow that needs the most attention, and use your oppo-
site hand to give alternate pressure on the following pairs of points.
Work each pair until it feels less tense and then move on to the 
next pair.
• LI 11 and LI 4
• H 3 and H 4
• TW 11 and TW 12
Use sustained pressure on points that feel empty, or alternating pressure
on points that feel full.
2. Repeat with the other elbow.
Even if you don’t have problems with the other elbow, doing the oppo-
site side is always a good idea. This helps the body further relax and
send qi to the side in need.

Chapter 13: Lending a Hand (And Arm and Shoulder, Too!)

Help for Your Wrists and Hands
All too often the hands are the site of discomfort and pain from joint-
degenerating conditions, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
When you bring circulation and qi into the area, you can reduce stiffness,
inflammation, and pain.
You can also try the ice treatment in Chapter 4, but only when your joints are
hot and inflamed. Be careful not to overuse ice. In traditional Chinese medicine,
too much cold can cause harmful side effects like stagnant qi, contributing to
arthritis and other conditions that you may be trying to alleviate. You’re using
too much ice if you rely on it every time you feel pain. Using ice correctly
means using it only when you have a hot, inflamed, painful joint or injury.

Maybe you’re one of the many people who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.
If so, the routine in this section may provide some relief.
Opening the tunnel in your carpal 
(and other wrist and hand issues)
Carpal tunnel can be a very painful condition. The carpal tunnel is a tunnel
through your wrist in which tendons, arteries, veins, and nerves travel to get
to the hands. The syndrome has many causes. The tunnel may collapse, in
which case you may need surgical correction or physical therapy. Another
cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is inflammation of the tendons going into
the hand. This happens from overuse, especially with activities like computer
work or video games. When the tendons inflame, they compress the median
nerve going into your hand.
You may be surprised to learn that a popular pastime is being blamed for
more and more cases of carpal tunnel. What is it? Video games. Doctors are
reporting an increasing number of cases among kids and teenagers (groups
rarely afflicted by this condition in previous times). Experts attribute this to
the number of hours many kids today spend playing video games involving
repeated finger movements to operate the controls.
The following routine for pain relief in the hands can be added to the shoul-
der and/or elbow routines. You can find points in Table 13-3 and in Figures
13-1 and 13-2. If you’re not sure how to measure a chon, check Chapter 3.

Try this acupressure routine to help alleviate some of the discomfort. If you’re
adding the carpal tunnel points to the shoulder-freeing routine from the earlier
“Shouldering the Burden” section, start the following sequence. If you
skipped the shoulder routine points, go back and do Steps 1, 2, and 3 from
that routine before starting this one.
1. Work the hand that needs the most attention first, and, using your
opposite hand, alternately press the following point pairs, using alter-
nating or sustained pressure as needed.
Work with each pair until it feels clear and then move to the next pair:
• LI 4 and LI 6
• TW 4 and TW 5
• HP 6 and HP 7
2. Hold TW 4 and HP 7 at the same time with sustained pressure for 
3 minutes.
3. Hold TW 5 and HP 6 at the same time for 3 minutes.
4. End by holding HP 8 for 3 minutes.
5. Relax and enjoy the free flow of qi.
Silencing the click of a trigger finger
Trigger fingers (or trigger thumbs) are identified by a characteristic clicking
when you bend or straighten your finger or thumb. It occurs most often in
the index finger and thumb. If you have a trigger finger, you know that in addi-
tion to clicking, it can lock in either a fully straightened or bent position.
Do you garden, play the piano, knit, or do detailed work with your hands? If so,
you can be susceptible to trigger finger because it can be caused by repetitive
use (again!). The tendons swell as they pass through the tendon sheath — a
condition called tenosynovitis. If you have trigger finger, you may feel pain in
your wrist as well as over the top of your finger.
In this section, we give you a routine that may help your trigger finger. The
points you need are in Table 13-4, and you can locate them in Figures 13-1 
and 13-2.

Tormented by trigger finger? Here’s a routine that may help. If you’re adding the
trigger finger points to the shoulder-freeing routine from the earlier “Shoul-
dering the Burden” section, start the following sequence. If you skipped the
shoulder routine points, go back and do Steps 1, 2, and 3 of that routine
before starting the trigger finger routine. If you have time, doing these points
after the carpal tunnel routine in the last section can be very beneficial.

Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

1. Start with the hand that needs the most attention, and, using your
opposite hand, put alternate pressure on the following point pairs:
• LI 2 and LI 4
• Lu 9 and Lu 10
2. Use alternating or sustained pressure and continue to work with these
two point pairs until they feel better.
3. End by holding HP 8 for 3 minutes.
4. Relax and experience the reduced tension in your muscles and ten-
dons; you may want to gently stretch your trigger finger or thumb as
the qi flow balances.
Reflexology to the Rescue for 
Shoulders, Elbows, and Hands
Reflexology can be a great way to relieve tension and soreness in your shoul-
ders, arms, and hands. As with all reflexology routines, you can use the reflex
areas on either your feet or your hands. You may notice that there is no reflex
area for the arms and hands; working the shoulders stimulates qi flow along
the whole limb. You may prefer to do this routine on your hands because
they’re directly involved with the treatment. But be careful — don’t aggravate
your own sore hands by using them! You may want to get someone else to do
it for you! You can benefit by using reflexology alone or by using it following
the acupressure treatments in this chapter.
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing exer-
cises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening up any restric-
tions. Use horizontal stripping (see Chapter 4) to further open the
zones of your foot.
5. Find the reflex zones for the shoulders, arms, and hands (see 
Figure 13-3).
You can find them under the baby toe on both feet.
221
Chapter 13: Lending a Hand (And Arm and Shoulder, Too!)

6. Thumb-walk the area looking for any nodules, soreness, or crackling
sounds, and use circular motions to work out the tension.
7. End with thumb-walking and circular motions to the solar plexus and
the adrenals to stimulate smooth qi flow.
8. Repeat with the other foot.
9. Lie still and let yourself feel the benefits of moving qi.
You may notice tingling, warmth, or relaxation. The longer you give
yourself to integrate the session, the better your result will be.

Chapter 14
Time for a Gut Check
In This Chapter
 Discussing common digestive problems
 Stopping the agony of stomach pain
 Knowing what causes those bellyache blues
 Finding relief from your gut-related woes
M
ost people use the generic term stomachache to refer to any type of
abdominal pain or problem. But a wide variety of conditions can cause
discomfort in this area. Many people suffer from one or more of a group of
symptoms that could fall under the category of digestive problems and gener-
ally aren’t the type of things people are eager to discuss: nausea, gas, consti-
pation, and so on.
Digestive problems can result from many causes — a poor diet, obviously, 
is one. Even if your overall diet is generally good, you may have a sensitivity
to a specific food or type of food. For example, many people have trouble
digesting dairy products, while others have stomachs that aren’t exactly
thrilled with hot and spicy meals. Stress can also frequently disrupt the
normal flow of your digestive process. An additional cause of digestive prob-
lems is invasion of microscopic pests such as bacteria. Of course, chronic
medical conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) can also con-
tribute to abdominal pain and digestive problems.
Determining the root cause of your digestive problems is difficult if all you
have to go by are symptoms. Many causes produce the same symptom, so
see your doctor for a diagnosis.
The ideal solution for stomach problems is to get your dietary routine in
better shape — and that should definitely be your long-term goal. But in the
meantime, bodywork techniques can help you cope with some of your stom-
ach woes. This chapter tells you how.

How Bodywork Techniques Can Ease
Symptoms of Poor Digestion
You’re probably familiar with the symptoms of digestive problems. We’re talk-
ing about all those nasty maladies the narrator rattles off during the typical
commercial for an antacid or other stomachache remedy. Heartburn, sour
stomach, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, and other assorted intestinal
problems all fall into this category.
For better or worse, these conditions tend to be blatantly obvious. In other
words, if you’re having trouble in the stomach area, you’re probably painfully
aware of it — usually immediately after the problem begins. The good news is
that this awareness means you can also start treating the symptoms immedi-
ately, increasing your chances of rectifying the problem before it gets any
worse.
Stomach ailments can be the result of excess stimulation to the digestive tract,
or stimulation at times when it isn’t needed. The cause? You guessed it —
stress! Acupressure and reflexology are great at reducing stress, and they also
help restore normal digestive function by restoring balance. Most important,
acupressure helps the body do what it’s already trying to do — heal itself —
so you don’t have to be an expert in knowing the cause of the problem. Use
the routines in this chapter for any digestive upset to help restore balance.
Even some of the more severe digestive ailments, like Crohn’s disease and
colitis, can be improved with acupressure and reflexology. Most digestive 
disorders disrupt the lining of the digestive tract and create inflammation,
decreasing the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Acupressure and reflex-
ology can help the body’s efforts to repair the digestive lining and reduce
inflammation by increasing circulation and restoring harmonious qi flow.
Settling Digestive Disturbances 
with Acupressure
In Chinese medicine, disorders are treated by balancing the qi in unbalanced
areas. The acupressure approach can work well in alleviating digestion-
related discomfort.
Focus on the points in Figures 14-1, 14-2, and 14-3 — and read about them in
Table 14-1 — for the acupressure routine in this section, which helps address
digestion problems.

Chapter 14: Time for a Gut Check

The following acupressure routine is effective for opening up the digestive
channels and making your abdominal area more comfortable. Any digestive
condition can benefit from the following routine. You can also focus the ses-
sion by using only points whose functions are specific to your concern.
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (refer to Chapter 2).
2. Stretch your whole body to open all the digestive channels.
• Take your arms up over your head while breathing in and stretch
backward as far as it’s comfortable (don’t overstretch and hurt
yourself!). Hold for the count of three.
• Exhale as you bend forward, stretching your arms to the floor. Be a
rag doll and hold this for the count of three.

• Inhale as you stand back up; bring your arms over your head and
lean to the side, exhaling while you lean. Hold.
• Breathe in as you straighten up and repeat on the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open all meridian
channels.
3. For overall digestive health, use all the points in Table 14-1 as follows:
• Use the one meridian at a time technique (see Chapter 4) and hold
LI 4, LI 11, TW 5, and HP 6. Hold each with alternating or sustained
pressure for 1 to 3 minutes each, or until they feel open and with-
out tension.
• Repeat these points on the other side of the body.
• Use the bilateral technique to hold St 36, Sp 4, Sp 6, and Lv 3. Hold
each with alternating or sustained pressure for 1 to 3 minutes
each, or until they feel open and without tension.
• Repeat any points that need additional attention.
• End by holding CV 12 for 1 to 3 minutes.
4. If you don’t have time for a full treatment or to address a specific
intention, hold the following points with either a bilateral approach
or one meridian at a time, whichever is easiest for you:
• Short overall treatment: St 36, Sp 4, LI 11, LI 4
• Nausea: St 36, Lv 3, HP 6, TW 5
• Diarrhea: Sp 4, Sp 6, St 36, LI 4, LI 11
• Constipation: LI 11, LI 4, St 36, Lv 3, CV 12
• Bloating: Lv 3, Sp 6
• Urinary incontinence: TW 5
• Indigestion: CV 12, Sp 4, St 36
• Ulcers: St 36, Sp 4, Sp 6
5. Rest and relax, or include a reflexology session.
Resting after a session allows the qi to fully balance and restore harmony.
The longer you rest and relax, the more effective the session will be.
Reflexology for Healthy Digestion
Reflexology is a great way to improve digestive symptoms. All the digestive
organs can be stimulated through the hands and feet, encouraging better 
229

balance and overall function. In addition, reflexology acts through the ner-
vous system. The nervous system and endocrine system are the master con-
trollers of the digestive process, and this routine can help regulate nervous
system control over digestive function. Use Figure 14-4 to find the reflex
points for the digestive organs to use in this routine.
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing exer-
cises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening up any restric-
tions. Use horizontal stripping to further open the zones of your foot.
5. Find the reflex zones for all the digestive organs: the stomach, spleen,
large intestine, small intestine, liver, gall bladder, and pancreas.
They’re all located mostly in the arch of the foot.

7. Use circular motions on any sore or nodular areas.
8. Repeat with the other foot.
9. Relax and allow your body time to respond to the changes you have
started.
You may hear gurgles and other noises coming from your digestive tract.

Chest-Related Care 
and Considerations
In This Chapter
 Brushing up on breathing basics
 Breathing easier for better comfort
 Encouraging better respiratory function
 Knowing the essentials of heart health
You could say that the chest is, literally and figuratively, the heart and
soul of the body. First and foremost, it’s where your heart hangs out and
runs the entire operation. We don’t think we need to explain why your heart
is important — we’re pretty sure that you’re well aware of your heart’s role in
the grand scheme of things.
The chest is also home to the lungs, which provide the oxygen that makes all
things possible, biologically speaking. Sure, you know that breathing is an
important thing. If a person doesn’t breathe, he quickly dies. But it’s not as
cut-and-dried as that. It isn’t enough just to breathe; for optimal performance
and vitality, you must breathe well. If your breathing is compromised in any
way, it affects many of your other bodily functions. Your heart may need to
work harder, your brain may struggle to perform without its necessary
supply of fresh oxygen, and countless other anatomical processes may also
be affected.
In this chapter, we tell you about some common causes of heart and lung
problems. We tell you how acupressure and reflexology can help with these
common problems, and we give you specific routines to help you get your
heart and lungs into the best shape possible.

What Causes Heart and Lung Problems
(And How Bodywork Can Help)
A variety of health conditions can cause (or worsen) heart and lung problems.
High blood pressure, asthma, genetic conditions — these can all spell trouble
for the heart and lungs, as can temporary/recurring problems such as bron-
chitis and pneumonia.
From a traditional Chinese viewpoint, many of these problems can also be
caused by energy blockages or imbalances. Improper energy flow can, for
example, cause poor circulation, which in turn causes the heart to work less
efficiently and forces the lungs to work harder.
By restoring the proper flow of energy — and focusing on specific points that
correspond with heart and lung function — you can greatly improve the way
your body feels and performs.
Bodywork isn’t intended to treat heart attacks or other critical emergencies.
Should you experience any sudden chest pains, rise in blood pressure, or
other symptoms of heart problems, seek medical treatment immediately.
When the blood pump gets weak
Many of the same things that pose a danger to your lungs (see the next sec-
tion) can also threaten the health of your heart — things like smoking and
pollutants. However, your heart faces additional dangers. For one thing, it’s
much more vulnerable to diet-related factors, such as too much cholesterol,
fat, and sugar.
Diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries (athero-
sclerosis), and kidney problems all put added strain on your heart. So too
does the swelling in your feet that happens with varicose veins and other cir-
culatory problems, causing the heart to work extra hard to move the fluid.
On top of that, some people are born with congenital heart diseases or may
develop defects such as faulty heart valves and arrhythmias that may need to
be treated and monitored throughout their entire lives.
Ultimately, a healthy heart reflects healthy choices; lifestyle changes are key
in correcting or managing heart problems. Acupressure and reflexology are
great tools to support you and your heart in this effort — they contribute to
heart health in the following ways:
234
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

 They decrease blood pressure. These techniques promote relaxation of
the smooth muscles in the arteries, which helps reduce blood pressure.
Although temporary, with regular use it has cumulative effects.
 They support organ function. Nourishing qi supports the function of 
all organs, and in this case, the heart and kidneys. Qi provides vitality,
and blockages in qi flow decrease the heart’s and kidney’s abilities to
function.
 They improve circulation. In Chapter 3, we tell you that where qi goes,
blood follows. In addition, the nervous system controls constriction of
arteries; acupressure and reflexology stimulate the regulatory function
of the nervous system, causing improved blow flow and heart function.
 They decrease inflammation. Inflammation attracts cells and choles-
terol that form plaque on the artery walls, decreasing blood flow.
Acupressure and reflexology can’t directly reduce atherosclerosis, but
they can help reduce inflammation.
When air won’t flow free
A variety of factors can negatively affect your breathing. Check out the fol-
lowing list for details:
 Smoking: Perhaps the most obvious cause of breathing problems is
smoking. In addition to causing lung cancer, smoking also damages your
lungs and makes it tougher to breathe deeply and effectively. When you
quit smoking, the benefits to your lungs begin almost immediately. You
actually begin to breathe better (and experience reduced blood pres-
sure) within minutes after puffing that last cigarette.
 Pollution: Pollutants other than cigarette smoke also affect your lungs
and make breathing more difficult. These pollutants can be found in
smog, exhaust fumes from large trucks, the materials emitted from
smokestacks, and numerous other sources.
 Asthma and allergies: Quite a few medical conditions can affect your
breathing. Asthma is one of the biggest culprits. Asthma is a chronic
inflammatory condition affecting the lungs — and it can be life-threaten-
ing in some cases. There are also great herbal remedies for treating the
symptoms of allergies, and acupuncture is helpful to many people.
 Serious medical conditions: On the serious end of the spectrum, heavy-
duty health problems like lung cancer, emphysema, and tuberculosis can
inflict serious damage on the lungs, in some cases, making breathing vir-
tually impossible without the help of a respiratory or oxygen tube.
235
Chapter 15: Chest-Related Care and Considerations

 Temporary conditions: Temporary conditions like the flu, bronchitis,
and common colds can also compromise your lungs’ ability to perform
at peak capacity. In addition, allergies can often have a negative impact
on your breathing.
By using acupressure and reflexology techniques that encourage better
breathing, you help your lungs perform to the best of their ability, and you
allow your entire body to enjoy the benefits of an ample supply of vital
oxygen. These techniques help in the following ways:
 They open airway passages.
 They relieve constrictive tension in the chest.
 They deepen breathing patterns.
 They improve cell function — qi flow nourishes every cell in the body.
 They improve immune function by balancing qi throughout the body.
A Healing Session to Keep 
Your Ticker Tockin’
The heart routine in this chapter uses the points in Figures 15-1 and 15-2,
which are described in Table 15-1, to help you keep your heart healthy and
beating strong. Learning and finding these points before you do the routine
will help you be confident and correct in your session.

Chapter 15: Chest-Related Care and Considerations

Using this routine helps your heart maintain strong function, supplying life-
giving blood to all organs and tissues in the body. If you have a specific concern,
you can shorten the routine and use only the points that address that concern.
H 7 and HP 6 are key points that can be used for all conditions. Remember
that heart health is often a lifestyle issue and can’t be corrected without
lifestyle changes. (Heart concerns are serious; don’t neglect medical care!)
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Stretch the meridians in the arms and chest by following these steps:
• Stand with your feet shoulder-width — or farther — apart.
• Bend your knees slightly.
• Breathe in while raising your arms, palms down, to shoulder level.
• Continue breathing in, and spread your arms backward at shoulder
level while rotating your hands palms up.
• Reach your thumbs toward the floor behind you.
• Exhale and relax, bringing your arms back to your side.
• Repeat three times.
3. Start with either arm, and use alternating pressure for full points or
sustained pressure for empty points (refer to Chapter 4 for a
refresher). Work each of the following points for 1 to 3 minutes:
• Using one meridian at a time, press HP 4, HP 6, HP 7, H 7, and LI 11.
Repeat this entire sequence two or three times, until you establish
an even flow (the points feel mostly equal to each other in fullness
and tenderness).
• Press K 27 bilaterally.
• Press both CV 14 and CV 17 together and hold for 3 minutes.
4. Relax by lying quietly and slowing down your breathing, which also
slows the mind.
Allow the qi to respond to your directions in the routine by giving it time
to fully balance. You may notice warmth or tingling through your body,
especially in your chest.
If you have time, follow this routine with the corresponding reflexology rou-
tine for the heart and lungs, which we include later in this chapter in the sec-
tion “Reflexology: Massaging the Heart and Lungs Through the Feet.”

Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

Although balancing the qi in the chest and lungs benefits all breathing condi-
tions, you may want to focus on something specific. This routine helps you
with both the general and the specific:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Stretch the meridians in the arms and chest by following the process
described in Step 2 of the preceding section.
3. Start with either arm, and use alternating pressure for full points or
sustained pressure for empty points. (See Chapter 4 for explanations
on techniques.) Work each point for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Use one meridian at a time and press Lu 1, Lu 6, Lu 9, and Lu 10.
• Repeat with the other arm.
• Use a bilateral approach and press K 27 and St 13.

• Use one meridian at a time to press LI 4 and LI 11.
• Repeat on the other arm.
• If you’re having trouble breathing due to a clogged nose or sinus
problems, use a bilateral approach and press LI 20, St 3, and B 2.
Otherwise, you can skip these points.
4. If you want to specifically focus on one type of chest problem, you can
hold any combination of the following points:
• Asthma: Lu 1, Lu 6, Lu 9, Lu 10, K 27
• Allergy: K 27, LI 4, St 3, B 2
• Bronchitis: Lu 1, Lu 9, K 27, St 13
• Emphysema: Lu 1, Lu 6, Lu 9, K 27, St 13
• Sinusitis: St 3, LI 20
5. End by pressing CV 17 for 3 minutes with sustained pressure.
6. Relax, by lying or sitting quietly, and let the qi flow rebalance as it
responds to your session.
You may want to spend this time meditating or breathing deeply and
evenly, calming your body and mind.
If you want, you can follow this routine with the chest-relieving reflexology
routine for the heart and lungs (see the next section).
Reflexology: Massaging the Heart 
and Lungs Through the Feet
Reflexology is thought to work by stimulating the nervous system, which ulti-
mately controls body functions. As we discuss earlier in this chapter, the ner-
vous system is the master controller of heart and lung function. Stimulating
the corresponding reflex areas on the foot or hands helps balance the ner-
vous system’s control, thereby calming and strengthening the heart and
opening airways into the lungs.
Use the following routine to address heart and lung problems with 
reflexology — refer to Chapter 4 for information on how to perform the 
techniques:
1. Wash and dry your feet.
244
Part III: Where Does It Hurt? Treating Common Aches and Ailments 

2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing exer-
cises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening up any 
restrictions.
5. Use horizontal stripping to further open the zones of your foot.
6. Find the reflex zones for the heart, lungs, and chest on your reflexol-
ogy map in Figure 15-4.
These areas are in the ball of the foot. The lungs are found on both feet,
but the heart has a reflex point only on the left foot, off the outside of
the lung reflex area.

7. Thumb-walk, looking for any nodules, soreness, or crackling sounds.
Use circular motions to work out the tension.
8. End with thumb-walking and circular motions to the solar plexus and
the adrenals to stimulate smooth qi flow.
9. Repeat with the other foot.
10. Relax while lying quietly and let the nervous system fully integrate
the stimulation you have provided.
You may notice that you’re breathing more deeply and/or your heart is
beating more slowly.

Age-Related Treatments
In This Chapter
 Encouraging proper balance for kids
 Conquering midlife maladies
 Helping seniors through bodywork
 Practicing reflexology at any age
A
s most people are painfully aware, everyone’s body changes (and 
not always in ways you like) as you age. Your physical challenges 
and health concerns as youngsters are totally different from those you face
as seniors. Specific pains and problems tend to plague those in the midlife
years, for example, whereas these conditions may not be a concern for
younger people.
Bodywork isn’t necessarily a one-size-fits-all type of thing. Sure, everyone 
is likely to get benefits of some sort from just about any of the techniques
practiced in acupressure and reflexology. Bodywork is a fantastic remedy
because, unlike medications or more stressful treatment approaches, its tech-
niques are gentle enough for almost everyone. (In the case of someone who’s
extremely delicate or frail, obviously you proceed with caution.) To reap the
maximum rewards, however, make an effort to spend some time on the tech-
niques geared specifically to the concerns that are common among people in
your age group (or that of the loved one you want to help).
In this chapter, we touch on some techniques geared to people of specific age
groups, from infants to seniors and everyone in between.
Just for Kids
True, babies and kids aren’t yet old enough to face the litany of aches and
pains that adults must deal with (often resulting from years of hard work,
overexertion, and bad habits). But as any parent knows, babies and children
tend to have a laundry list of aches and pains all their own: teething, diges-
tive discomfort, earaches, and so on.

Also, despite the fact that they often seem to have endless supplies of it, 
their energy isn’t always flowing as well as it should. Kids need all that energy
because their bodies have lots of hard work to do. We’re not talking just
about all that running, jumping, and playing. On a daily basis, their bodies 
are continuously changing, maturing, and getting stronger. Handling these
growing pains isn’t easy, and kids need all the help they can get.
Infants and toddlers
Nothing is worse for a parent than feeling helpless while your child struggles
with physical discomfort. Acupressure can be an effective way for you to
help with some of the simple aches and pains of growing, but it has its own
challenges. For one thing, babies are small, and finding points can be hard.
Don’t worry; finding the general area still stimulates healing qi. Your child
always benefits from calming and nourishing qi, whatever the situation is.
You can massage the acupoints that we introduce throughout this section (see
Figure 16-1 to locate them) any time your baby is having discomfort — in a
car, at the park, or anywhere. When you want to use a full routine, the perfect
time is while bathing, massaging, dressing for bed, or nursing your baby.
Infants respond quickly to acupressure, so shorter sessions of 10 or 15 min-
utes are all you need.
Try the following routine with the points throughout the following sections,
and you’re likely to see a much happier and more content baby:
1. Gently squeeze and release your baby’s arms and legs.
You don’t need to stretch an infant; babies are pretty loose already.
2. Find the acupoints you want to use (see Tables 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3)
and massage them gently, using circular motions with very light 
pressure.
You can use the points in any order or combination, or on any part of
the body. Just try to incorporate all the points for the condition you’re
caring for. You can also use points from different tables in this chapter
as needed.
Be careful with pressure. With infants, light soothing massage over the
point is perfect. Also, don’t spend too much time on any point. The most
you need to spend is 30 seconds, because children respond more
quickly than adults.
3. When you finish, continue with your normal routine.
Your baby should be calmer and more comfortable.

Overcoming colic
Colic is a condition that affects many babies. According to the Mayo Clinic,
colic is defined as “crying for more than three hours a day, three days a week
for more than three weeks in an otherwise healthy, well fed baby.” The crying
usually happens at the same time each day, is intense, and the baby tightens
his muscles in pain. It can start within a month after birth and is usually
resolved by 3 months.
No one knows the cause of colic. Food allergies or lactose intolerance were
thought to be the cause, but many children with colic don’t have these condi-
tions. Other culprits are thought to be immature digestive systems, immature
nervous systems, or abnormal bowel flora causing excessive gas. After exten-
sive research, no one knows why some babies have colic and others don’t.
Often conditions such as gastric reflux and food allergies are misdiagnosed as
colic, which is too bad because even though colic has no real treatment, you
can treat these other conditions.
Colic can be an extremely stressful and exhausting experience for both baby
and parent. Even though you can’t treat colic, parents find little tricks to
help, like bouncing the baby or swaddling the baby very tightly. Acupressure
may also help, so try focusing on the points in Table 16-1 to help relieve the
pain of colic.

Reducing teething pain
Teething can be a painful experience for a baby, causing the child to lose
sleep and become very unhappy overall. The pain of teeth breaking through
flesh can be diminished in a number of ways; you can rub ice cubes, clove oil,
or other pain-numbing substances on the gums, or even just apply pressure,
as a child does when chewing on a teething ring. Acupressure and reflexology
can also take the edge off by sedating the nervous system and by releasing
pain-relieving endorphins. Table 16-2 shows points that can help alleviate
some of the pain associated with teething.

Soothing the way to sleep
For small babies (and their parents), sleep can seem like an elusive luxury.
Babies lose sleep for a number of reasons, such as overstimulation or even
tummy aches and pains. Reflexology and acupressure calm and sedate fussy
babies by smoothing turbulent qi flow. They can help reduce pain by increas-
ing levels of endorphins — and these pain-reducing neurotransmitters are
also effective sleep aids. Because lullabies and teddy bears can work only a
limited number of miracles, Table 16-3 shows some points you may want to
try to help your baby (and you) get a good night’s sleep. (If you’re not sure
what a chon is, check out Chapter 3.)

Older kids
Imagine that your child is (fortunately) past the colicky stage and firmly
entrenched in early childhood. Although teething and other infant concerns are
no longer issues, kids of this age have their own problems to deal with, primar-
ily in the form of boo-boos. One advantage: Older children have the verbal skills
to express their pain, discomfort, and unhappiness (and trust us, they will!), so
employing bodywork techniques to ease the pain can be a lifesaver. Figure 16-2
shows some helpful points to use on children, and Table 16-4 describes each
point individually. (If you’re not sure what a chon is, refer to Chapter 3.)
Although bodywork can be effective for handling minor, routine aches and
pains, any serious/sudden pain or severe injuries should be treated by a med-
ical professional.

Chapter 16: Age-Related Treatments

Older kids are easier to work with than infants in some ways and more diffi-
cult in other ways. They’re a little larger and closer to adult proportions, so
finding the points is a bit easier. On the other hand, they move around a lot
and don’t have a long attention span for receiving acupressure.
When you work with toddlers, keep the pressure light, and incorporate circu-
lar massage on the points for added relaxation. Don’t worry too much about
finding the exact spot; you’re still stimulating healing qi.
Keep the sessions short. Fewer than 20 minutes is best for your child’s atten-
tion span and keeps him from overstimulating his qi.
As with babies, bedtime is an ideal time to use acupressure. If your child is
too sick or grouchy to play games, skip Steps 1 and 2. Otherwise, follow this
routine:
1. Play a deep-breathing game with your child (refer to Chapter 2 for
more on this warm-up exercise).
Kids are pretty good at belly breathing, because they do it all the time.
But encourage your child with a “Simon Says” or “Follow the Leader”
type of game.

2. Play a stretching game with your child.
Kids are pretty loose, too, but it never hurts them to do a good stretch.
Again, make stretching a game, and encourage your child to stretch her
whole body. (Stretching For Dummies, by LaReine Chabut and published
by Wiley, has some great stretches that most kids love doing.)
3. Because all the points you use in this routine are on the front and side
of the body, have your child lie on her back (face up).
4. Pick your points from Table 16-4, according to what your child needs.
If your child needs some of the points from the infant routines (refer to
Tables 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3, as well as Figure 16-1), don’t hesitate to use
them; they work for all ages.
Using the bilateral method or working one meridian at a time, and apply-
ing sustained pressure to tonify empty points and pulsating pressure to
disperse full points, press the points that are closest to the head or
chest first, ending with the points on the arms.
5. Read your child a story or give her a bedtime cuddle as she integrates
the energy from the session.
Reflexology for youngsters of all ages
Foot reflexology works great for kids as long as they aren’t too ticklish. If they
are, you may have to skip the healthy benefits of reflex stimulation until they
outgrow the tickles.
In general, light, narrow (finger-width) touch is more ticklish than steady,
broad (whole-hand) touch, so opt for the latter. Using the pad at the base 
of your thumb to rub the entire foot is an overall tonic.
This routine works well for infants, toddlers, and older kids, and you can do it
while washing them in a bath:
1. Warm up by using the pads of your thumbs or the pads at the base 
of your thumbs to massage the entire foot gently and thoroughly.
2. Start by thumb-walking the chest and lung points in the ball of the
foot (see Figure 16-3) to help clear congestion.
Feel for nodules, crystals, and sore spots to use circular motions on.
3. Thumb-walk the areas for the ears and sinuses.
Ear points are located at the base of the second and third toes, and the
sinus points are located on the toe pad. Pull, squeeze, and roll the toes
from the base to the point, using circular motions on any nodules or
sore spots. Work in as many directions as you can.
257
Chapter 16: Age-Related Treatments

4. Thumb-walk the lymphatic strip along the outside edge of the foot to
help clear infection and stimulate the immune system.
As always, use circular motions to dispel any soreness or nodules.
5. Use circular motion on the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.
You can promote sleep by helping balance the endocrine glands, espe-
cially the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. You can find the pitu-
itary point on the big toe and the thyroid point at the base of the big toe.
The points for the adrenal glands, which regulate the stress response,
are just below the ball of the foot on the inside of the arch. Spending
extra time on both these places can help promote a good night’s sleep.
6. If you want to address any other problem areas, use circular motion
or thumb-walk those reflex areas.
7. End by holding the feet with your whole hands, transmitting good
thoughts for good dreams.

Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

Midlife Issues
If you ask us, midlife gets a bad rap. The pessimistic types tend to act as
though their life (at least, the fun part) is pretty much history when they reach
this point. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the word midlife implies,
half your life is still ahead of you, filled with all sorts of exciting possibilities.
Sure, some parts of your body may look and feel different from the way they
did when you were a teenager, but that’s not always a bad thing. Remember
acne and that awkward growth spurt that plagued your junior-high days?
For all its good points, the midlife period admittedly can come with its share
of stress, exhaustion, and emotional highs and lows. The typical midlife crisis
is a roller coaster of hormonal changes and shifting life issues. Transitions
are never easy; focusing on the points that we use in this section (illustrated
in Figures 16-4, 16-5, and 16-6, and explained in Table 16-5) can help you deal
with these challenges.

You may also be experiencing the aches and pains of old injuries, arthritis, 
or chronic muscle tension from all that desk work you do. Maybe you’re
having trouble keeping your blood pressure low, or maybe you’re experienc-
ing other degenerative conditions. If so, acupressure and reflexology can
help. Bodywork can balance immune function, stimulate healing and repair
mechanisms, lower blood pressure, and reduce pain — all these things make
acupressure and reflexology ideal for midlife concerns. If you identify with
any of these physical concerns, look up the appropriate chapter in Part III of
this book and find the routine you need.
If midlife problems have you tired and stressed, try this routine for some
much-needed relief:
261
Chapter 16: Age-Related Treatments

1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (see Chapter 2).
2. Stretch the meridians in the arms and chest:
• Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart or farther.
• Bend your knees slightly.
• Breathe in while raising your arms to shoulder level, palms down.
Continue breathing in, and spread your arms backward at shoul-
der-blade level while rotating your hands palms up. Reach your
thumbs toward the floor behind you.
• Exhale and relax, bringing your arms back to your side.
• Repeat three times.
3. Use a bilateral hold on K 27 for 1 to 3 minutes with sustained or 
alternating pressure.
4. Starting with either arm, work H 7, HP 7, and TW 5 in any order,
using alternating or sustained pressure as indicated, and working
each point for 1 to 3 minutes.
5. Repeat Step 4 with the other arm.
6. Bilaterally hold Sp 4 on the inside of the foot for 1 to 3 minutes.
This point usually is sore, so you may want to use circular motions to
ease the congested qi.
7. Relax, or follow with the supportive reflexology routine at the end of
the chapter (see “Reflexology for Teens and Adults”).
For Seniors
You’ve left the midlife period behind and are coming to terms with your more
“mature” self. These years truly are your golden years, and you should trea-
sure all the wonderful experiences you’re having.
If you find enjoyment tough to come by because your bones are achin’ or you
generally just feel wiped out, try a dose of acupressure or reflexology. The
free movement of qi throughout your body may deliver the pain relief or the
boost of energy you need. Also, when practiced on a regular basis, acupres-
sure and reflexology may lead to less pain and better mental and physical
function in the long term.
Moving qi through your body
You’re never too old to support your qi and reap the rewards of a better-
balanced energy flow. You can find acupressure and reflexology routines for

many of the aches and pains you may be experiencing in Part III of this book.
Maybe you’re having a harder time resisting illness, catching everything that
comes around — if so, head to Chapter 18. Or maybe you’re having trouble
with arthritis in your knees or with your heart — if that’s you, check out
Chapters 10 and 15, respectively. However, if you need more energy to pursue
the things that interest you in life, this is the chapter for you. Replenishing
and stimulating qi flow helps all the systems in the body and helps you find
the get-up-and-go you may be looking for.
To help support your qi in your senior years, concentrate on the points 
illustrated in Figures 16-4, 16-5, and 16-6, earlier in this chapter, and listed

Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

Improving memory and mental 
function with acupressure
One of the biggest health-related complaints among senior citizens is the
memory loss they often experience to varying degrees. Memory loss can be
extremely stressful and upsetting to those who suffer from it. Like all parts 
of the body, the brain needs smooth qi flow to function well. Memory is only
one function of the brain that suffers. Along with memory loss can come 
confusion, anxiety, and disorientation. Fortunately specific acupoints can
recharge your memory and help alleviate these other symptoms as well.
People of all ages can experience occasional memory lapses — and some
people are born with a terrible memory — so this routine can be helpful for
everyone, not just seniors.
Table 16-7 lists points for improving memory and overall mental function.
You can locate these points in Figures 16-4 and 16-6, earlier in this chapter.

Reflexology for Teens and Adults
You can use reflexology to address key organs and glands to relieve stress,
worry, and overactive emotions; support qi; and improve memory and over-
all mental function. The organs involved are the lungs and heart. The key
endocrine glands are the pituitary, pineal, thyroid, and adrenal glands.
Here’s a reflexology routine designed with the needs of teens and adults 
in mind:
1. Wash and dry your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep-breathing 
exercises, do some deep belly breathing now (refer to Chapter 3).
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed, and cross your leg so that you can hold one
foot in your lap.
4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening any restrictions.
5. Use horizontal stripping (refer to Chapter 4) to open the zones of your
foot further.
6. Find the reflex zones for the heart, lungs, and chest on the reflexology
map in Figure 16-7.

These areas are in the ball of the foot. The lung zones are on both feet,
but the heart has a reflex point only on the left foot, off the outside of
the lung point.
7. Thumb-walk, looking for any nodules, soreness, or crackling sounds,
and use circular motions to work out tension.
8. Stimulate the endocrine glands by using circular motions.
You can find the pineal and pituitary reflex points on the big toe, and the
thyroid reflex point at the base of the big toe. The reflex points for the
adrenal glands, which regulate the stress response, are just below the
ball of the foot on the inside of the arch.
9. End with thumb-walking and make circular motions on the solar-
plexus point in the center of the foot and on the lymphatic strip on the
outside edge of the foot.
10. Repeat Steps 3 through 9 on the other foot.
11. Relax, breathe deeply, and allow qi to flow through the organs and
glands you have stimulated.
You may feel warmth, tingling, or a sense of opening as qi moves.

E
ven if you’re for equal rights — and we certainly are — face it: physically,
men and women are obviously very different. And that means that they
each have their own specific needs for health and healing.
Women in particular have additional healing needs. They need something to
help them cope with the physical pain and discomfort they face on a monthly
basis, as well as the pain related to labor and childbirth, and menopause
symptoms.
In addition, women can often experience problems as a result of the shifts in
energy flow due to hormonal changes and imbalances.
By tailoring the healing plan in recognition of women’s specific anatomical
makeup, you can target their particular needs more efficiently.
We felt it was important to include a section specifically addressing women,
because some common conditions affect a large number of women on a regu-
lar, predictable basis. (Men, on the other hand, tend to be plagued more by a
variety of different conditions, such as those we discuss throughout other
parts of this book.) In this chapter, we cover the major female-specific prob-
lems, including PMS and menstrual cramps, problems related to
pregnancy/childbirth, and menopause symptoms.
Curtailing Menstrual Pain and PMS
One of the biggest pain-related concerns of women — and one they must deal
with on a monthly basis for most of their lives — is the discomfort associated

with their menstrual cycles. This discomfort includes not only menstrual
cramps but also the irritation and mood swings associated with premenstrual
syndrome (PMS). This discomfort is no minor inconvenience — for some
women, these symptoms can last for a week or two out of every month. And
women deal with more than physical discomfort: PMS can also affect a
woman’s sleep schedule and concentration and leave her totally exhausted.
From a Chinese medicine perspective, menstrual problems can result from a
number of energetic factors, the most common being a condition of excess
yin. (Refer to Chapter 1 for a discussion of yin and yang characteristics.) By
balancing the yin and yang of the body, you can alleviate the symptoms of
PMS. In this section, we help you do just that — see Figures 17-1, 17-2, and
17-3 to locate the points, and read about them in Table 17-1. If you’re not sure
how to measure chon, check out Chapter 3.

Use the following routine anytime you experience menstrual cramps:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (refer to Chapter 2).
2. Stretch your whole body to open the meridians involved in maintain-
ing female health and balance (yes, that’s all of them!) by following
these steps:
• Take your arms up over your head while breathing in and stretch
backward as far as you comfortably can (don’t overstretch and
hurt yourself!). Hold for the count of three.
• Exhale as you bend forward, stretching your arms to the floor. Be a
rag doll and hold this stretch for the count of three.
• Inhale as you stand up; bring your arms over your head and lean to
the side, exhaling while you lean. Hold.
• Breathe in as you straighten up and repeat on the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open the meridian
channels.

3. Work the points in Table 17-1 by using sustained pressure on points
that feel too empty and alternating pressure on points that feel too full.
Work each set of points for 1 to 3 minutes.
4. Use bilateral holds for the following sets of points, repeating pressure
on each set of points two to three times:
• Lv 3, Sp 4, Sp 6
• GB 34, St 29, B 47
Spend extra time on points that are sore or feel “needy.”

Dulling Pregnancy and Post-Pregnancy
Aches and Pains
As every woman who has ever been pregnant knows, impending motherhood
is a blissful time that’s often accompanied by some not-so-blissful aches and
pains. In Chinese medicine, many of the minor ailments are imbalances of qi,
especially in the spleen and stomach meridians where qi imbalances show up
as morning sickness, food cravings, heartburn, and fatigue. On an emotional
level, these meridians also demonstrate imbalance through irritability and
worry. The liver, heart, and kidney meridians are also key during pregnancy,
but in general, the balance of all the meridians is necessary to maintain a
healthy, easy pregnancy.
Acupressure to ease pregnancy woes
Acupressure can be a great tool for assisting a happy and healthy pregnancy.
It can help relieve minor aches, pains, and discomforts of carrying many
274
Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

extra pounds all in one place. It can help reduce excess fluid build-up in 
the ankles, and release nervous tension and excess excitement. It also helps
balance the roller coaster of hormones and emotions and the roller coaster
of your stomach during morning sickness. And don’t forget the importance 
of smooth and adequate flow of qi to nourish all cells, including the fetus.
Acupressure is great, but remember that these points powerfully affect the
body and need to be used with care. Here are some tips for using acupres-
sure during pregnancy:
 Don’t hold points for a long time — 30 seconds to 1 minute is plenty.
Holding the points for this amount of time helps avoid too many toxins
being cleared from the cells at once and entering the bloodstream in one
big rush. Toxins in the bloodstream can enter the baby, stressing both
mommy and baby. Although removing toxins is important, slower is
better in this situation.
 Don’t press the points deeply — pregnancy is a time when everything is
extra sensitive, points can be more painful as well, and the effects can be
more dramatic because the body is highly tuned to react. So remember
that less is more.
 Make the sessions short — 20 minutes is plenty. The goal is to 
stimulate change, but you don’t want the body to do too much at 
one time.
 Avoid using acupressure and reflexology when a pregnancy is 
fragile. At this time a mother needs all the qi she has to sustain 
the pregnancy.
Most reflexologists believe that using reflexology is safe even in fragile
pregnancies because it supports the direction in which qi is needed
rather than redirecting it. However, if you aren’t professionally trained,
avoiding both reflexology and acupressure is wise.
 Never use the points that we list in Table 17-2 during pregnancy. Some
of these points, such as Sp 6 and LI 4, are absolutely taboo. Others are
cautionary, especially during the first trimester, but should be avoided
throughout just to be safe. A practiced professional will use these points
as indicated, but you need more than this book to be prepared for that
level of practice.
 Do use acupressure along with reflexology (avoiding the ankles) and
gentle massage to relieve the aches and pains of pregnancy. Just make
sure you follow the precautions in this list.

Figure 17-4 in this section, can be effective in providing some welcome relief
for the mommy-to-be.

Use the following routine to ease some of the aches and pains of pregnancy
and prepare the woman’s body for delivery. Warning: Be sure to follow the
list of precautions when using acupressure in pregnancy and avoid all the
points in Table 17-2.
278
Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

1. Start with the opening warm-up in Steps 1 and 2 of the routine for
PMS relief (see the earlier section “Curtailing Menstrual Pain and
PMS” for details).
Be sure to stretch gently and always stay within your comfort zone.
2. To continue your warm-up, do a series of squats.
This stretch is one of the best you can do for pregnancy. If you can, simply
spend time squatting every day. This stretch helps open your pelvis and
prepare the bones, ligaments, and skin for stretching during childbirth.
3. Use bilateral holds on the following sets of points, repeating pressure
on each set of points two to three times:
• Sp 3, Sp 4, K 6
• B 47, B 48, B 54
Spend extra time on any sore points or points that feel as if they need
more attention.
4. Alternately press HP 6 on each arm.
You can press firmly between the two tendons that run down the arm
and into the wrist. Don’t worry about damaging veins or tendons; they’ll
move out the way of your pressure.
5. End with a relaxing rest or some rejuvenating reflexology.
Relief on your labor day
Although women need attention and pain relief throughout their entire preg-
nancy, they really need all the help they can get during labor. Fortunately,
bodywork techniques can be effective in alleviating some of the pain associ-
ated with labor, particularly in the back. You can have your birthing partner
use the points in Table 17-4, which you can locate in Figures 17-1, 17-2, and
17-3, earlier in this chapter, to ease your back pain and to support and assist
your body in the delivery processes. You may notice that points that were
taboo during pregnancy are great for labor to help push the baby out.
It’s a good idea to have your birthing partner memorize these points. If you’re
supporting someone else through a birth, memorize these points in plenty of
time before the event. Things start to move pretty fast, and finding maps can
be impossible.

classes. And forget the stretching! Your body will be stretching enough all on
its own!
280
Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

1. Your partner can use the points in Table 17-4 in any order and at any
time during the delivery.
2. Some specific points that may give you relief include the following:
• B 28, B 48, St 29, and K 3 are great for easing the discomfort of
early labor and preparing for delivery.
• To assist delivery, use Sp 6, LI 4, and GB 21.
3. Rub the feet — especially after the birth.
Restorative reflexology works well (see the routine in Chapter 6 for opti-
mal wellness, or use the one at the end of this chapter).
Just for new moms
Giving birth is probably the hardest thing a woman’s body will ever do. Give
yourself every support possible in recovering your qi; you need the energy to
breastfeed and care for your baby. Breastfeeding is taxing and you may have
trouble with pain or insufficient milk flow. And although labor can involve
considerable pain, the discomfort doesn’t end instantly after the baby is
born. New moms must cope with pain, as well, which often isn’t easy consid-
ering the exhausting toll of the recovery process (and, face it, babies can
make it tough to get a good night’s sleep).
But a mom who’s tired, weak, and in pain can’t fully enjoy crucial bonding
moments with her new bundle of joy. So using bodywork techniques to make
a new mom more comfortable can benefit both mom and baby.
Bringing qi to traumatized tissue post-delivery
For new moms, the recovery phase immediately following labor can involve
considerable pain, cramping, and other discomfort. The body has to adjust 
to changes in hormones, restrengthen overstretched tissue, repair tears or
cuts to the perineum, and recover qi. If the new mom had a C-section, she 
has additional challenges of repairing the surgical cuts and muscles of the
abdomen and pelvic floor. For these women, the relief that bodywork pro-
vides can be a lifesaver. For the routine in this section, you can find the
points in Table 17-5 and locate them in Figures 17-1, 17-2, and 17-3, earlier 
in this chapter.

To garner relief post-delivery, try the following healing routine:
282
Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Use the whole-body stretches from Step 2 of the routine to relieve
PMS (see the earlier section “Curtailing Menstrual Pain and PMS” 
for details).
3. Stretch your chest and arm meridians by opening your arms wide 
and stretching them behind you as you arch your back and breathe 
in deeply.
Do these stretches two or three times.
4. Use the following points in the following patterns, using sustained
pressure on points that feel too empty and alternating pressure on
points that feel too full.
Work each set of points for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Hold CV 6 for 3 to 5 minutes to open the flow of energy into the
Lower Sea of Qi.
• Hold HP 6 on each arm, one meridian at a time.
• Use bilateral holds for B 47, St 36, and Lv 3.
• Repeat the previous two steps until the points are no longer 
sore or the flow feels even and smooth.
• Finish by holding CV 6 again for 3 to 5 minutes to harmonize 
qi flow.
Soothing sore breasts and encouraging milk flow
Recovering from delivery can be tough enough, but the physical demands 
of breastfeeding can add an extra challenge for new moms. Many women
have trouble starting the breastfeeding process due to congestion of chest 
qi or qi deficiency. Using St 13 and CV 17 can really help. And if you have
trouble producing as much milk as your baby needs, St 36 and Lv 3 can stim-
ulate qi sufficiency.
Breastfeeding may be exhausting, but it’s a great way to bond with your baby.
Bonus: It also helps you shed pregnancy weight fast — on average, breast-
feeding burns up an extra 500 calories a day!
The specific points in Table 17-6 can help breastfeeding moms feel better. You
can find the points in Figures 17-1, 17-2, and 17-3, earlier in this chapter.

• Hold HP 6 on each arm using one meridian at a time.
• Repeat the previous two steps until the points are no longer sore
or the flow feels even and smooth.
• Hold CV 17 for 3 to 5 minutes to harmonize the qi flow.
Note: If you hold points for both labor relief and breastfeeding 
support, drop this last step from both routines. Instead, when
you’re finished with both routines, hold CV 6 and CV 17 together
for 3 to 5 minutes. This is a great way to end, and you can use 
this alternative in either routine.
5. End with a relaxing ritual of your choice or move on to the foot 
reflexology routine at the end of this chapter, “Reflexology for
Overall Women’s Health.”
Squelching the Fires 
of Menopause
Menopause (and pre-menopause) can cause all sorts of uncomfortable and
painful symptoms thanks to changing hormones, ranging from night sweats
and hot flashes to mood swings and insomnia. Perhaps one of the most
annoying symptoms of menopause, though, is the emotional roller coaster
caused by fluctuating hormone levels. These up-and-down fluctuations can
make life miserable for the menopausal woman (and everyone around her).
Relief is here. Because qi impacts the endocrine system, acupressure can be
helpful in easing the passage of menopause. We cover all those aggravating
symptoms and more in this section. In the routine that follows, you use the
points found in Table 17-7 and located in Figures 17-1, 17-2, and 17-3, earlier in
this chapter.

Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

1. Breathe, stretch, and ground yourself as in the acupressure routines
that appear earlier in this chapter.
2. Use the following points in the following pattern; use sustained pres-
sure on points that feel too empty and alternating pressure on points
that feel too full.
Work each point for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Use a bilateral hold on GB 20.
• Press LI 11 on one arm, and then on the other.
• Press H 6 on one arm, and then on the other.
• Use a bilateral approach for Lv 3, K 3, and Sp 6.
• Hold CV 6 and CV 17 together.
3. You can use individual points any time you need them — H 6 and LI
11 are particular favorites!
Reflexology for Overall Women’s Health
Several studies have shown reflexology to be beneficial in treating female-
specific ailments, especially PMS and menstrual cramps. This is partly
because reflexology helps balance the body’s systems, including hormone
levels — the fluctuation of which can lead to problems such as PMS and men-
strual pain. Here’s a reflexology routine that can be helpful in addressing a
variety of women’s concerns:
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep breathing 
exercises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold 
your foot in your lap.
4. Roll your foot back and forth in your hand, loosening up any 
restrictions.
Use horizontal stripping to further open the zones of your foot.
5. Locate the reflex zones for female reproductive organs (see the 
reflexology map in Figure 17-5).
These points are on the top of the foot and along the Achilles tendon
next to the anklebones. You can use them for all female issues, but
they’re especially great for PMS, fertility, and pregnancy.
287
Chapter 17: Especially for Women

6. Massage and finger-walk these areas using circular motion on sore
spots as needed.
Note: Be sure to avoid using pressure on the ankles — you might inad-
vertently stimulate Sp 6, which is a taboo point during pregnancy.
7. On your reflexology map, find the reflex zones for the breasts, cervix,
thyroid gland, and adrenal glands.
Thumb-walk these areas and use circular motion as needed.
8. If you need them, find the reflex zones for breastfeeding stimulation,
PMS symptoms, and/or menopause.
Thumb-walk these areas and use circular motion as needed.

9. Use finger-walking along the lymphatic strip to help your body flush
out toxins.
This step is especially important during pregnancy when you don’t want
toxins creating an imbalance in the system.
10. End with thumb-walking and circular motions to the solar plexus and
the adrenals to stimulate smooth qi flow.
11. Repeat with the other foot.
12. Relax, lie quietly, and breathe deeply, allowing qi flow to respond to
the session.
You may notice warmth and tingling through your body as qi rebalances.

Chapter 18
Fighting Colds, Preventing Illness,
and Relieving Some 
Chronic Conditions
In This Chapter
 Keeping colds at bay
 Fighting off the flu and fevers
 Improving your immune system
S
ure, everyone knows that major accidents and injuries can cause serious
pain. But many people underestimate the impact that small maladies like
the common cold, the flu, and other chronic conditions can have on your
daily life.
Think about it: Are you really giving 100 percent at your job, at home, or any-
where else if you’re distracted by those bothersome cold symptoms? Even
minor symptoms like an annoying cough or a slight fever can prevent you
from performing at your best. In addition, these pesky illnesses tend to linger
and make themselves at home inside your body until they eventually wear
you down and take a toll on your immune system and energy levels. That’s
why it’s so important to nip these conditions in the bud, fighting them off
before they grow into bigger problems.
By using acupressure and reflexology, you can keep these irritating cold and
flu symptoms at bay. In addition, you can give your immune system the boost
it needs to keep these nasty bugs from invading your space in the first place.
Boosting Your Immune System with Qi
The best way to deal with cold and flu symptoms is to avoid them altogether
by keeping your immune system strong enough to fight off these germs before

they ever get a chance to set up shop inside your body. Your immune system
determines your ability to resist infection, degeneration, and the growth of
abnormal cancerous cells. As we discuss in Chapter 1, according to Chinese
medicine, your health and immune system depend on the proper balance and
flow of qi. Qi nourishes and sustains the body; without balanced, harmonious,
and adequate qi, you lose vital energy, which opens the door to illness.
By using bodywork to boost your immune system, you increase your resis-
tance to illness of all kinds and have the greatest odds of avoiding these
common maladies and more serious ailments. And if you’re already feeling a
little under the weather, acupressure can give your immune system the boost
that it needs to fight off the invading illness. Familiarize yourself with the
points in Table 18-1 if you want to know which points strengthen the immune
system. If you want a visual reference, check out Figures 18-1, 18-2, and 18-3.

The following routine is useful when you’ve been exposed to an illness or just
want a little extra precaution:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding (see Chapter 2).
294
Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

2. Stretch your whole body to encourage qi flow to all areas by following
these steps:
• Take your arms up over your head while breathing in and stretch
backward as far as you comfortably can (don’t overstretch and
hurt yourself). Hold for the count of three.
• Exhale as you bend forward, stretching your arms to the floor. Be a
rag doll and hold this stretch for the count of three.
• Inhale as you stand back up; bring your arms over your head and
lean to the side, exhaling while you lean. Hold.
• Breathe in as you straighten up and repeat the previous three
steps on the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open the meridian
channels.
3. Work the points in Table 18-1, using sustained pressure on points that
feel too empty or alternating pressure on points that feel too full.
Work each set of points for 1-3 minutes.
• Use bilateral holds on K 3, Lv 3, and Sp 6. Press each one in turn
and repeat until soreness is reduced or you have an overall sense
of flow; repeat at least three times.
• Use bilateral holds on St 36 and K 27. Alternate pressure between
these two points for three rotations.
• Alternately press LI 11 on both arms for approximately 3 minutes
each. Repeat as necessary to reduce any soreness.
• End by pressing CV 17 for 3 minutes.
4. Follow with reflexology, or lie quietly and give yourself time to allow
the qi to balance through your system.
Ousting the Common Cold, Flu, and Fever
You may not think you can do much to cope with cold and flu symptoms,
aside from taking some over-the-counter medication and waiting for the
storm to pass. Well, you’ll be pleasantly surprised to learn that acupressure
can make a big difference in the effects of these common conditions. The
immune system is comprised of white blood cells (WBC) that fight infection,
cell destruction or degeneration, and cancer. With acupressure and reflexol-
ogy, you can direct qi to stimulate WBC production and function, and you can
direct it to areas that are weakened or under attack by infection.
295
Chapter 18: Fighting Colds, Preventing Illness, and Relieving Chronic Conditions

Don’t underestimate the seriousness of the flu. Each year, at least 30,000
deaths in the United States are attributed to the flu. Older people, babies, and
people with health problems that leave their immune systems in a weakened
state are most at risk.
Focusing on the points in Table 18-2 can help you survive this miserable
experience. You can see these points in Figures 18-1 and 18-2, earlier in 
this chapter.

don’t have time to do all the points, choose the points that most match your
symptoms. Press them with alternating pressure if they’re too full or with
sustained pressure if they’re too empty.
296
Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Stretch the meridians in the arms and chest by following these steps:
• Stand with your feet shoulder-width — or farther — apart.
• Slightly bend your knees.
• Breathe in while raising your arms to shoulder level, palms down.
Continue breathing in and spread your arms backward at shoulder-
blade level while rotating your hands palms up. Reach your
thumbs toward the floor behind you.
• Exhale and relax, bringing your arms back to your side.
• Repeat three times.
3. Work the points in Table 18-2, using sustained pressure on points that
feel too empty or alternating pressure on points that feel too full.
• Start with either arm and work LI 4, Lu 9, TW 5, and LI 11 for 1 to 3
minutes each. Repeat the series until all the points feel even.
• Repeat on the other arm.
• Use the bilateral approach on GB 20, alternating pressure on each
point until they’re even.
4. Follow with reflexology or lie quietly and imagine your defense
system actively destroying the microbes causing your illness.
Flushing Out Toxins
One of the main causes of illness is toxic overload. Junk food, food additives,
pollution, and toxic chemicals clog the system with harmful substances and
interfere with cellular function. This can cause you to feel groggy, tired, and
unmotivated with aches, pains, groans, and moans. Toxins decrease your
body’s defenses and contribute to degenerative conditions, such as arthritis.
Repetitive or chronic illnesses are often indicative of toxic overload blocking
the body’s repair mechanisms.
Detoxification is an important step to acquiring better health and promoting
a stronger immune system. The organs of detoxification and elimination of
toxins are the liver, kidneys, colon, lungs, and skin. In the removal of stored
toxins, these organs often take a toll. Be sure to drink plenty of water, six to
eight 8-ounce glasses per day, to flush your system whenever you’re initiating
detoxification pathways.
Methods of detoxification include fasting or other dietary changes and/or
herbs to initiate the cleansing process. Acupressure and reflexology can
assist by sending qi to the organs involved. You can even use specific points
to stimulate the removal of toxins and flush them from the system — check
out Table 18-3 and refer to Figures 18-1, 18-2, and 18-3, earlier in this chapter.
297
Chapter 18: Fighting Colds, Preventing Illness, and Relieving Chronic Conditions

Use both acupressure and reflexology together to promote detoxification,
because each supports the other in this process.

This routine helps clear your system of toxins and encourages a healthy
immune system:
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Stretch your whole body to encourage qi flow to all areas by following
these steps:
• Take your arms up over your head while breathing in and stretch
backward as far as you comfortably can (don’t overstretch and

• Breathe in as you straighten up and repeat the previous three
steps on the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open the meridian
channels.
3. Work the points in Table 18-3, using sustained pressure on points that
feel too empty or alternating pressure on points that feel too full.
Work each set of points for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Use bilateral holds on Lv 3, Sp 6, and K 27. Repeat this sequence
until the points feel even.
• Start with either arm, and alternately hold LI 4 and HP 6. Repeat on
the other arm. Continue until all four points are even and balanced.
• Finish by holding CV 17 and CV 6 together for 1 to 3 minutes.
4. Follow with reflexology or lie quietly, relaxing your muscles and
allowing qi to flow easily and smoothly through your body.
Combating Chronic Fatigue
Chronic fatigue is another long-term condition that leaves many people phys-
ically exhausted (hence the name). Often, it has no clear cause, which makes
it difficult to treat. But many people have found bodywork techniques to be
effective in alleviating the “always tired” feeling that this condition causes.
If your energy flow is blocked or disrupted, your endurance ability lags and
you feel tired all the time (even when you first wake up in the morning). These
symptoms can only add to the problems already faced by someone who suf-
fers from chronic fatigue. By freeing your qi, you rev up your energy levels.

Part IV: Addressing Specific Needs and Concerns 

The following routine can help boost your energy levels, which can help you
perform your daily routine more efficiently and just help you feel better overall.
1. Belly breathe while centering and grounding.
2. Stretch your whole body to encourage qi flow to all areas by following
these steps:
• Take your arms up over your head while breathing in and stretch
backward as far as you comfortably can (don’t overstretch and
hurt yourself). Hold for the count of three.
• Exhale as you bend forward, stretching your arms to the floor. Be a

• Inhale as you stand back up; bring your arms over your head and
lean to the side, exhaling while you lean. Hold.
• Breathe in as you straighten up and repeat the previous three
steps on the other side.
• Repeat the whole sequence three times to fully open the meridian
channels.
3. Work the points in Table 18-4, using sustained pressure on points that
feel too empty or alternating pressure on points that feel too full.
Work each set of points for 1 to 3 minutes.
• Start with either arm and hold TW 4, alternating arms until both
points feel even.
• Use bilateral holds on K 27, St 36, Sp 4, and B 62. Repeat the appli-
cation of pressure on this set of points until the points feel bal-
anced and even.
• Hold CV 6 at the same time as GV 14 for 1 to 3 minutes.
4. Follow with reflexology or relaxation.
During relaxation, your body and mind integrate the change of qi flow.
You may notice a deeper state of relaxation than you normally feel with
deeper breaths and fewer thoughts running around in your mind.
Immune Stimulation and 
Detox with Reflexology
Foot and hand reflexology is great to stimulate detoxification and build the
immune system. The major organs for eliminating toxins are the kidneys,
liver, lungs, large intestine, lymphatic system, and skin. You can stimulate
each of these through the feet and hands, and most of them have specific
reflex areas. In addition to supporting immune system function, detox is a
301
Chapter 18: Fighting Colds, Preventing Illness, and Relieving Chronic Conditions

great way to support weight loss and can help overcome the nasty side
effects if you’re quitting smoking.
The following reflexology routine can help boost your immune system while
simultaneously helping your body get rid of harmful toxins:
1. Start by washing and drying your feet.
2. If you haven’t already stretched and performed deep-breathing exer-
cises, do some deep belly breathing now.
3. Sit in a chair or on a bed and cross your leg so that you can hold your
foot in your lap.
4. Use foot rolling and foot stripping to stretch the tissue, loosen restric-
tions, and open the reflex zones.
For directions, refer to Chapter 4.
5. Thumb-walk, looking for any nodules, soreness, or crackling sounds,
and then use circular motions to work out the tension.
6. Stimulate the reflex area to balance the adrenal glands (see Figure 18-4).

The adrenal glands, which regulate stress response, are just below the
ball of the foot on the inside of the arch.
Adrenals are very helpful in regulating body processes that assist detoxi-
fication. In addition, overfunctioning of the adrenal glands produces too
much cortisol, a stress hormone that inhibits the immune system.
Balancing this reflex area can decrease stress, reduce cortisol produc-
tion, and improve immune function.
7. End with thumb-walking and circular motions to the solar plexus in
the center of the foot, and the lymphatic strip on the outside edge of
the foot.
8. Repeat with the other foot.
9. Relax to allow the body to fully adjust to the changes you have initiated.

 Debunking myths surrounding needles, black magic, and fads
 Setting the record straight on pain, danger, time, and more
T
he healing arts of acupressure and reflexology are often misunderstood
or incorrectly represented. In this chapter, we present some common 
fallacies surrounding these practices.
Acupressure Involves Needles
Different from acupuncture, acupressure involves no thin needles or sharp
instruments at all (in fact, no instruments of any kind). Generally, the only
“tools” involved are the practitioner’s own two hands. Both acupuncture and
acupressure, however, are guided by the principles of Chinese medicine, use
acupoints to effect change in meridians, and employ a holistic approach to
healing that includes mind, body, emotions, and spirit.
Acupressure and Reflexology 
Are Crazy, Short-Lived Fads
A lot of people believe that acupressure and reflexology are nothing more
than a crazy fad. This belief couldn’t be further from the truth. In reality, acu-
pressure and reflexology both have their roots in ancient Chinese medicine.
People of various cultures have been practicing them for thousands of years.

So, in comparison to the ancient roots of acupressure and reflexology, you
may say that many of the newer popular healing treatment methods used
today — such as many modern cutting-edge techniques — are really short-
lived fads.
The Healing Arts Are Connected to Black
Magic and Other Spiritual Stuff
Perhaps you’re reluctant to try acupressure and reflexology because you
heard that they’re tied to black magic. This is totally false — acupressure 
and reflexology have no connection to black magic or anything scary at all. 
A basic tenet of the healing arts is the importance and power of positive
thoughts and good energy. The healing arts have been (and continue to be)
employed by people of all walks of life and many different religions. This
belief originated because the concept of energy is so foreign. In general,
people are afraid of what they don’t know. Science does not yet have the
equipment to measure qi directly (skin measurements are indirect measure-
ments of skin conductivity, not direct measurements of an energy output),
and research on the effects and benefits of acupuncture, acupressure, and
other energy medicine has been scanty. As such, it has easily been misunder-
stood. Fortunately this is all changing. Medical research is now more plenti-
ful, and the benefits of energy modalities are more accepted.
Healing Requires Special Powers 
or Complicated Training
Not true. Healing doesn’t require any special powers or complicated training.
Everyone has the power to heal. You just need to embrace your abilities and
have confidence in your own innate ability to heal. True, specialized training
is essential for the more complicated, in-depth, professional use of acupres-
sure and reflexology. However, a few simple guidelines are all you need for
the basic techniques and simple applications presented in this book.
Healing Techniques Require Lots of Time
Healing techniques don’t necessarily take a lot of time. You can devote as
much or as little time as you’re willing and/or able to spare. Obviously, the
more time you can devote to healing, the better results you can often
achieve. The routines in this book can easily be applied in 20 to 30 minutes;
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

however, when you have a headache, foot problem, or so on, spending just 5
minutes pressing the appropriate points can make a big difference in how
you feel, and in your energy levels.
The Healing Arts Are a Substitute 
for Conventional Care
The healing arts definitely aren’t a substitute for conventional care, and we
want to stress that emphatically. The healing arts are used in conjunction
with (and as a complement to) necessary medical treatment, not as a replace-
ment. No ethical and responsible healing-arts practitioner would ever claim
that these techniques can cure cancer, diabetes, MS, or any other serious
medical condition. You should always seek a doctor’s care for any painful 
or chronic medical condition, or for a serious accident, illness, or injury.
However, bodywork can stimulate the body’s healing mechanism and relieve
some of the pain and other symptoms that are caused by these and other
medical conditions.
The Healing Arts Are Dangerous 
for Certain People
The assumption that the healing arts are dangerous for certain groups of
people is false, for the most part. In general, acupressure and reflexology 
are completely safe for almost everyone. It is true, however, that youngsters,
pregnant women, and others may need adjustments to general sessions.
Session time may need to be reduced, and specific movements or certain
points may need to be avoided. In this book we alert you to such adjustments
as needed. Also, people who are extremely delicate or weak should, of
course, use caution (and perhaps consult their doctor) before embarking on
any kind of healing routine.
Acupressure and Reflexology 
Techniques Are Painful
Some people believe that acupressure and reflexology techniques are painful.
False. On the contrary, these techniques should make you feel at least a little
bit better, often immediately. In some cases, you may experience what’s
sometimes called “good pain,” similar to what you may feel with a really deep
309
Chapter 19: Ten Myths and Misconceptions About Acupressure and Reflexology

stretch or a good massage. However, you should never experience any actual
pain — and if you do, you should stop immediately. After a session, some
people may experience a healing crisis, which is an exacerbation of symp-
toms prior to resolution.
Acupressure and Reflexology Are Fancy
Names for Garden-Variety Massages
Massage is certainly one of the healing arts, and acupressure and reflexology
do involve some basic massage techniques, but they aren’t the same as your
garden-variety massage. Massage, acupressure, and reflexology all employ
detailed, specific approaches based on scientific foundations involving the
roots of pain and basic physiology. They all have a holistic approach to well-
ness, interacting with mind, body, and spirit. However, acupressure and
reflexology are much more complex practices that include assessing and bal-
ancing the flow of energy along meridian or reflex pathways.
Energy Is Transferable
Many people believe that one person’s energy is transferred to another in heal-
ing practices. We can’t speak for all healing practices, but acupressure and
reflexology don’t exchange energy between giver and receiver. A basic assump-
tion of this work is that the receiver has everything he needs within himself; it’s
just out of balance or harmony. Acupressure and reflexology seek to balance
the energy of the receiver, not give the receiver energy or take it away.

Ten Ways Acupressure and
Reflexology Can Enrich Your Life
In This Chapter
 Helping you feel better
 Improving your relationships with others
A
cupressure and reflexology can have many positive effects on your 
life — physically, emotionally, and mentally. In this chapter, we 
address a few of the major benefits you can enjoy by taking part in body-
work sessions.
You’re More Relaxed
Perhaps the most immediately obvious benefit of bodywork sessions is that
you’re more relaxed. From practically the moment a session starts, you most
likely begin to feel increasingly relaxed. And when practiced regularly, body-
work leaves you more relaxed in general.
Acupressure and reflexology both encourage deep tranquility and relaxation
by restoring the optimal flow of energy throughout your body, helping your
body release the negative energy brought on by stress. By promoting the
proper flow of qi and helping to remove any energy blockages, which can be
stressful, bodywork allows you to enjoy a more relaxed state no matter what
you may be doing. See Chapters 1 and 3 to learn more about the importance
of proper qi flow.

You Lessen the Effects of Stress
Bodywork treatments can also help alleviate the physical symptoms of
stress, such as increased muscle tension, which can cause headaches, stiff-
ness, and muscle pain; elevated blood pressure, which contributes to heart
disease; or feelings of anxiety brought on by feeling stressed out. Relieving
physical symptoms of stress can put your body in a better energetic state to
handle whatever stressful situations you can’t avoid.
Your Life is More Balanced
A basic principle of both acupressure and reflexology is the restoration of
harmonious energy flow, putting qi in proper balance. In Chinese medicine,
all illness and distress in life can be attributed to imbalances of qi. So balanc-
ing qi brings you more balance and stability, physically, mentally, and emo-
tionally. As a result, you enjoy better health, a more positive attitude, fewer
aches and pains, and better decision-making skills. In short, a more balanced
life overall!
You’re More in Tune with Your Body
Acupressure and reflexology both encourage you to become more aware of
your body. This heightened awareness makes you much more sensitive to your
body’s natural rhythms and its optimum state. When you have this heightened
awareness, you’re often able to immediately notice any deviation from your
body’s optimum state or any disruption to your energy flow. As a result, you
can sometimes nip problems in the bud, treating an energy blockage while it’s
still in an early state, before it grows into a more disruptive condition.
Another added benefit of becoming more aware of your body: You have a
greater appreciation for all the amazing and wonderful things your body does
on a daily basis. You may be surprised to discover just how many things you
had taken for granted!
You’re in Less Pain
Acupressure and reflexology almost always lessen pain. Obviously, if you’ve
suffered a severe injury or if you’re dealing with a debilitating disease, body-
work treatments can do only so much. However, for routine pains caused by
minor to moderate injuries, illnesses, and other conditions, the healing arts are
often very effective in reducing your pain and making you more comfortable.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You Enjoy Better Relationships
Enjoying better relationships with those around you does tend to happen, for
a variety of reasons. First, face it — people who are in pain tend to be a bit
crabby. If you feel better physically, you also have a better outlook on life and
are probably a much more pleasant person to be around. People are drawn to
you and enjoy being in your company. Also, when your energy flow is in sync
and you have emotional balance, you tend to enjoy more positive relation-
ships with loved ones and interact better with professional colleagues.
You Have More Energy
Acupressure and reflexology are both focused on restoring a person’s proper
balance and flow of qi. As a result, your energy is no longer blocked or slowed
down, and you’re able to enjoy more of this positive fuel. Also, people who are
uncomfortable or in pain tend to feel less motivated and less energetic. By
alleviating some of your pain, bodywork techniques can in turn leave you 
feeling more invigorated and optimistic about life in general. Pressure point
therapies, as well as massage and other bodywork techniques, have the added
benefit of increasing the release of endorphins. Endorphins are neurotransmit-
ters released in nerve synapses that stimulate feelings of well-being, relax-
ation, and inner calm. This combination of beneficial effects provides you 
with the optimum combination of more energy, greater alertness, and clam
relaxation. Bottom line: You feel ready to go out and conquer the day!
You Heal Faster
One of the main goals of acupressure and reflexology is to encourage and
accelerate the healing process by stimulating the proper flow of energy to the
correct parts of the body. This helps your body heal itself naturally. The body
is designed with self-healing mechanisms that require proper fuel and condi-
tions to work. Physiologically, every cell needs nutrients, removal of waste
products, fuel from the food you eat, oxygen, and water. In Chinese medicine,
vitality, supplied by qi, is included in that list. All physical substances are
supplied to cells by the circulatory system, so when circulation is dimin-
ished, cell health is compromised. The principle demonstrated through 
acupressure and reflexology is that where qi goes, blood follows. When the
channels of qi are open, cells receive vitality and circulation is improved, 
providing the cells with all they need to heal faster.
313
Chapter 20: Ten Ways Acupressure and Reflexology Can Enrich Your Life

In addition, acupressure and reflexology also encourage emotional well-
being, and this positive state often helps speed up the healing and recovery
process. Many studies have demonstrated a connection between positive
thinking and faster healing. For example, a study published in the July 2006
issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons showed
that refraining from stress, worry, and other negative emotions played an
important role in speeding patients’ recovery.
You Have More Self-Confidence
By performing these techniques on yourself and others, you start to discover
the fact that you have the power to heal yourself. This discovery can be emo-
tionally and mentally empowering, and can really give your self-confidence a
big boost.
You Nurture Yourself
If you’re like most people, you spend lots of time taking care of everyone else,
and very little time taking care of yourself. Most likely, you often neglect your
own physical and emotional needs — even when you’re in pain.
Engaging in acupressure and reflexology sessions forces you to treat yourself
to some “me time,” which you most likely desperately need. This “me time” is
far from selfish — the better you feel, the more efficiently you can fulfill all
your daily duties and nurture the important people in your life.

Professional Organizations
Bodywork associations have been getting more organized in the face of
changing state regulations. Associations offer a wide variety of services.
They’re often involved in legally helping to define the field and creating 
state and national standards of practice and training. You can log on to the
associations’ Web sites to find a licensed or certified therapist near you; to
find a list of certified schools and resources; to obtain professional liability

316

insurance; or to find out the legal requirements in your state for becoming a
professional. These sites can also provide information on continuing educa-
tion, new book critiques, and sales of books and tools:
 American Oriental Body Therapies Association (AOBTA): This organi-
zation’s Web site (www.aobta.org) is the most comprehensive associa-
tion for acupressure with the largest membership base.

lished codes of ethics or standards of practice. The organization also
receives complaints from receivers.
Training Centers
Innumerable bodywork training centers around the country offer certification
in acupressure and/or reflexology. Many states require a massage therapy
license in order to practice acupressure, so many massage therapy schools
offer secondary certification programs in acupressure and/or reflexology.
Other massage schools offer a few classes as adjunctive therapies, which is
fine if acupressure or reflexology isn’t your primary interest. The following
schools and training centers offer high-quality programs that meet profes-
sional standards.
Acupressure training

Books
We tried to make this book as informative as possible, but bodywork is a vast
topic that encompasses lots of issues and ideas. Here are some books that can
provide you with more insight into specific topics related to the healing arts.
Philosophy of Chinese medicine
If you enjoy reading about the basic ideas and philosophy of Chinese medi-
cine in Chapter 1, you may want to check out these two books. They’re con-
sidered to be classics in the field. They’re clear and easy to read (sort of), so
you shouldn’t feel too overwhelmed by new and different thinking.
