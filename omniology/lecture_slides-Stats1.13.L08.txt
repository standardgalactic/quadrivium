NHST: Overview 
•  Null Hypothesis Significance Testing 
(NHST) 
– H0 = null hypothesis 
•  For example, r = 0 
– HA = alternative hypothesis 
•  For example, r > 0

NHST: Overview 
•  Null Hypothesis Significance Testing 
(NHST) 
– H0 = null hypothesis  
•  For example, B = 0 
– HA = alternative hypothesis 
•  For example, B > 0 
 
5 
NHST: Overview 
•  If the alternative hypothesis predicts the 
direction of the relationship between X & Y 
(positive vs. negative) 
– Directional test 
– Otherwise it is known as a non-directional test

NHST: Overview 
•  Null Hypothesis Significance Testing 
(NHST) 
– H0 = null hypothesis  
•  For example, B = 0 
– HA = alternative hypothesis 
•  For example, B != 0 
 
7 
NHST: Overview 
•  Assume H0 is true, then calculate the 
probability of observing data with these 
characteristics, given that H0 is true 
•  p = P(D | H0) 
•  If p is very low, then Reject H0, else Retain H0

NHST: Overview 
•  p = P(D | H0) 
•  Given that the null hypothesis is true, the 
probability of these, or more extreme data, is 
p 
– NOT: The probability of the null hypothesis 
being true is p 
– In other words, P(D|H0) != P(H0|D)  
10 
NHST so far in this course 
•  r 
–  Is the correlation significantly different from 
zero? 
•  B 
–  Is the slope of the regression line for X 
significantly different from zero? 
11 
NHST for B 
•  t = B / SE 
– B is the unstandardized regression 
coefficient 
– SE = standard error 
– SE = SQRT[SS.RESIDUAL / (N – 2)]

Segment summary 
•  NHST is a procedure for hypothesis 
testing 
•  Requires a binary decision 
– Reject or Retain the Null Hypothesis 
•  Four possible outcomes 
– Correct retention, correction rejection 
– False alarm (Type 1 error), Miss (Type II 
error)

NHST Problems & Remedies 
14 
NHST Problems 
•  Biased by sample size 
•  Arbitrary decision rule  
•  Yokel local test 
•  Error prone 
•  Shady logic 
15 
NHST Problems 
•  Biased by sample size 
–  For example, in regression 
•  p-value is based on t-value 
•  t = B / SE 
•  SE = SQRT(SS.RESIDUAL / (N – 2)) 
16

NHST Problems 
•  Arbitrary decision rule 
–  The cut-off value (alpha) is arbitrary 
–  p < .05 is considered standard but still arbitrary 
–  Problems arise when p is close to .05 but not 
less than .05 
17 
NHST Problems 
•  Yokel local test 
–  Many researchers use NHST because it’s the 
only approach they know 
–  NHST encourages weak hypothesis testing 
18 
NHST Problems 
•  Error prone 
–  Type I errors 
•  Probability of Type I errors increases when 
researchers conduct multiple NHSTs  
–  Type II errors 
•  Many fields of research are plagued by a large 
degree of sampling error, which makes it difficult to 
detect an effect, even when the effect exists 
19 
NHST Problems 
•  Shady logic 
•  Modus tollens 
–  If p then q 
–  Not q 
–  Therefore, not p 
–  If the null hypothesis is correct, then these data can 
not occur 
–  The data have occurred 
–  Therefore, the null hypothesis is false 
20

NHST Problems 
•  Shady logic 
• 
If the null hypothesis is correct, then these data are highly 
unlikely 
• 
These data have occurred 
• 
Therefore, the null hypothesis is highly unlikely 
• 
If a person plays football, then he or she is probably not a 
professional player 
• 
This person is a professional player 
• 
Therefore, he or she probably does not play football 
 
21 
NHST Remedies 
•  Biased by sample size 
–  Supplement all NHSTs with estimates of effect size 
•  For example, in regression, report standardized regression 
coefficients and the model R-squared 
22 
NHST Remedies 
•  Arbitrary decision rule  
–  Again, supplement NHST with estimates of effect 
size 
–  Also, avoid phrases such as “marginally significant” 
or “highly significant” 
23 
NHST Remedies 
•  Yokel local test 
–  Learn other forms of hypothesis testing 
–  Consider multiple alternative hypotheses 
•  Model comparison

NHST Remedies 
•  Error prone 
–  Replicate significant effects to avoid long-term 
impact of Type 1 errors 
–  Obtain large and representative samples to avoid 
Type II errors 
25 
NHST Remedies 
•  Shady logic 
–  Simply remember, p = P(D | H0) 
–  OR, avoid NHST, and… 
–  Report Confidence Intervals only (see Lecture 10) 
–  Apply Bayesian inference
