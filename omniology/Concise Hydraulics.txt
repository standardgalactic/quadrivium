Preface
Preface
Hydraulics is a branch of scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the mechanical properties 
of fluids, mainly water. It is widely applied in many civil and environmental engineering systems (water 
resources management, flood defence, harbour and port, bridge, building, environment protection, 
hydropower, irrigation, ecosystem, etc.). This is an introductory book on hydraulics and written for 
undergraduate students in civil and environmental engineering, environmental science and geography. 
The aim of this book is to provide a concise and comprehensive coverage of hydraulics that is easy to 
access through the Internet.
The book content covers the fundamental theories (continuity, energy and momentum equations), 
hydrostatics, pipe flow, physical modelling (dimensional analysis and similarity), open channel flow, 
uniform flow, channel design, critical flow, rapidly varied flow, hydraulic jump, hydraulic structures, 
gradually varied flow, computation of flow profile, unsteady flow and hydraulic machinery (pump and 
turbine). The text has been written in a concise format that is integrated with the relevant graphics. 
There are many examples to further explain the theories introduced. The questions at the end of each 
chapter are accompanied by the corresponding answers and full solutions. A list of recommended reading 
resources is provided in the appendix for readers to further explore the interested hydraulics topics.
Due to its online format, it is expected that the book will be updated regularly. If you find any errors 
and inaccuracies in the book, you are encouraged to email me with feedback and suggestions for further 
improvements.

Fundamentals
1	 Fundamentals
Hydraulics is a branch of scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the mechanical properties 
of fluids, mainly water. It is widely applied in water resources, harbour and port, bridge, building, 
environment, hydropower, pumps, turbines, etc.
1.1	
Properties of Fluids
1.	 Density: Mass per unit volume r (kg/m3)
For water, 	
r = 1000kg/m3 at 4°C,
	
	
r = 998 kg/m3 at 20°C
For air, 	
r = 1.2kg/m3 	
at 20°C at standard pressure
2.	 Specific gravity: Ratio of the substance’s density and water’s density at 4oC
3.	 Pressure: Normal fluid force divided by area over which it acts (N/m2). (Note: pressure is 
scalar while force is a vector. A force is generated by the action of pressure on a surface and 
its direction is given by the surface orientation)
4.	 Viscosity and shear stress

Fundamentals
High viscosity: sticky fluid; low viscosity: slippy fluid
m is not a constant and changes with temperature.
Another form of viscosity is kinematic viscosity Q  P
U
 (m2/s)
Assumptions for the equation:
1.	 Fluids are Newtonian fluids (Non-Newtonian fluids are studied by Rheology, the science of 
deformation and flow);
2.	 The continuum approximation: the properties of the fluid can be represented by continuous 
fields representing averages over many molecules (The exception is when we are dealing 
with gases at low pressures).
1.2	
Flow Description
There are two approaches
1.	 Lagrangian approach: follow individual fluid element as it moves about;
2.	 Eulerian approach: focus on a fixed location and consider how the fluid properties change at 
that location as time goes on.
Definitions relating to Fluids in Motion
Ideal flow: frictionless and incompressible (i.e. nonviscous).
Steady flow: The flow is steady if the properties at each point in the fluid do not change with time.
One, Two and 3D flows:
One dimensional flow requires only one coordinate to describe the change in flow properties.
Two dimensional flow requires two coordinates to describe the change in flow properties.
Three dimensional flow requires all three coordinates to describe the change in flow properties.
In general, most flow fields are three dimensional. However, many practical problems can be simplified 
into one or two dimensions for computational convenience.
Control Volume
A suitable mass of fluid can be identified by using control volume. A control volume is a purely imaginary 
region within a body of flowing fluid. The region is usually at a fixed location and of fixed size. Inside 
the region, all the dynamic forces cancel each other. Attention may therefore be focused on the forces 
acting externally on the control volume.

1.3	
Fundamental Laws of Physics
The fundamental equations that govern the motions of fluids such as water are derived from the 
basic laws of physics, i.e., the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy. The conservation of 
momentum comes from Newton’s second law of motion stated in 1687 in Principia Mathematica. The 
law of conservation of mass was formulated in the late eighteen century and the law of conservation of 
energy in the mid-nineteenth century. In modern physics, mass and energy can be converted from one 
to the other as suggested by Albert Einstein in 1905. This combines two individual conservation laws 
into a single law of conservation of mass/energy. However, since conversion between mass and energy 
are not of relevance to fluids studied by hydraulics, the two individual laws of conservation are used in 
hydraulics. The conservation of mass is also called the equation of continuity.
Conservation of mass: mass can be neither created nor destroyed.
Conservation of energy: energy can be neither created nor destroyed.
Conservation of momentum: a body in motion cannot gain or lose momentum unless some external 
force is applied.
The application of the three fundamental laws will be further explained in the following chapters.

Hydrostatics
2	 Hydrostatics
Hydrostatics deals with the pressures and forces resulting from the weight of fluids at rest.
2.1	
Pressure
Pressure is the force per unit area acting on a surface and it acts equally in all directions. A common 
pressure unit is N/m2, also called Pascal (Pa). Depending on the benchmark used (with/without 
atmospheric pressure), pressure can be described as absolute pressure or relative pressure.
1.	 Atmospheric pressure (
ap ): is the pressure at any given point in the Earth’s atmosphere 
caused by the weight of air above the measurement point. The standard atmosphere 
(symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure equal to 101.325 kPa (or 760 mmHg, 1013.25 millibars).
2.	 Absolute pressure (
abs
p
): is the pressure with its zero point set at the vacuum pressure.
3.	 Relative pressure (
rp ): is the pressure with its zero set at the atmospheric pressure. It is 
more widely used in engineering than absolute pressure.
The relationship between them is

A differential manometer is used to measure the pressure difference between two points. A U-tube with 
mercury (or other fluids) is attached to two points whose pressures are to be measured. The pressure 
difference can be derived by measuring the elevation differences between Point A and Point B (i.e., Dz), 
and between the mercury levels (Dh).

Pressure Force on Curved Surface
For curved surfaces, the pressure force is divided into horizontal and vertical components. The vertical 
force Fy is the total weight of the fluid above the curved surface and its centre of pressure acts through its 
centre of gravity. The horizontal force Fx equals to the pressure force on a vertical plane surface projected 
by the curved surface. The resultant force is a triangular combination of the horizontal and vertical parts.

Flotation
1.	 Buoyancy
Buoyancy is the upward force on an object from the surrounding fluid (liquid or gas). This 
force is due to the pressure difference of the fluid at different parts of the object. The buoyancy 
force is derived by
	
B
F
gV
ρ
=
where V is the displaced fluid volume by the object, ρ is the fluid density.
An object submerged in a fluid is subject to two forces: gravity and buoyancy. When gravity 
force is greater than buoyancy force, the object sinks to the bottom. If the situation is reversed, 
the object will float. If two forces equal to each other, the object could be anywhere in the fluid.
2.	 Stable flotation and metacentre
A floating object is stable if it tends to return to its original position after an angular 
displacement. This can be illustrated by the following example. When a vessel is tipped, the 
centre of buoyancy moves from C to C’. This is because the volume of displaced water at the 
left of G has been decreased while the volume of displaced water to the right is increased. 
The centre of buoyancy, being at the centre of gravity of the displaced water, moves to point 
C’, and a vertical line through this point passes G and intersects the original vertical at M. 
The distance GM is known as the metacentric height. This illustrates the fundamental law of 
stability. When M is above G, the metacentric height is positive and the floating body is stable, 
otherwise it is unstable.

There are two ways to find the metacentre: experiment and analytical method.
a)	 Metacentre by experiment (if a ship is already built, the experiment method is easy to apply)
Shift a known weight w from the centre of the ship by a distance l to create a turning moment 
P=wl and the ship (with a total weight of W) is tilted by an angle a. The metacentre can be 
derived by the balance of moments at the point G.

Image the displacement centre (centroid of the buried body) is moved by x due to a turning

reduced buoyancy). If the ship’s displacement volume is V, length is L and width is D, we can

Energy Equation
3	 Energy Equation
The energy equation is based on the conservation of energy, i.e., energy can be neither created nor 
destroyed.
3.1	
Basic Formula
1.	 From solids
Total energy = kinetic energy + potential energy (unit: joule)
2
 
2
mu
Total energy
mgz
=
+
2.	 For fluids
In comparison with the solid mechanics, there is an extra energy term in fluids (pressure).
Total energy = kinetic + potential + pressure (unit: metre)
 i.e. u2
2g  z  p
Ug
 (per unit weight)
Pressure energy is similar to potential energy and they are closely linked (
/
z
p
g
C
ρ
+
=
). One 
thing to be noticed is that in physics, energy unit is joule, but in hydraulics, engineers use meter 
and call it energy head. Unlike solid objects, fluid can move around and change its shape, so 
we use metre per unit fluid weight to describe the energy in fluid. One meter of energy head 
is equivalent of one joule energy of 1 Newton weight of fluid.
3.	 Energy equation and continuity equation
With the conservation of energy, the energy equation for one dimensional flow can be derived as

Energy Equation
This is called the Bernoulli equation and it has been widely used in practical problems.
In addition to the energy equation, the conservation of mass is usually used jointly to solve 
fluid problems.
Rate of mass flow across 1 = Rate of mass flow across 2
	
U1A1u1  U2A2u2
If r is constant
	
A1u1  A2u2
It is usually called the continuity equation.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Introduction
Pipes are widely used in engineering to deliver fluid from one place to another. There are two 
flow types.
Laminar: flow in discrete layers with no mixing
Turbulent: flow with eddying or mixing action.
Reynolds Number is used to predict the laminar/turbulent flows

6.1	
Background
Hydraulic modelling includes physical and mathematical models. Initially, due to a lack of computing 
power, physical models dominated the hydraulic modelling field. Froude (1870) established the famous 
Froude similarity when he was testing a ship model. In 1885, Reynolds built a river model for Mersey 
based on the Froude similarity. The Buckingham’s Pi theorem (by J. Buckingham in 1914) extended the 
similarity principle to a broader sense. Since then, physical models have been widely used in hydraulics, 
including complex 3D river models with sediments.
With the advent of computers, mathematical modelling has been gaining popularity. It is possible to 
solve complicated differential equations using numerical techniques due to modern computer’s large 
memory and CPU speed. Nowadays, mathematical models are highly accurate and efficient to tackle 1D 
river problems. They are cheaper to build and fast to run in comparison with physical models. In 2D 
modelling, mathematical models are gaining ground from physical models. However, for 3D modelling, 
physical models still have superior performance in many complicated problems and it would be a long 
time before mathematical models are able to totally replace them.
6.2	
Dimensional Analysis
Dimensional Analysis is a branch of applied mathematics for investigating the form of a physical 
relationship. Dimensional Analysis not only helps us to design experiments but also allows us to gain 
an insight into how all the factors depend on each other even before we start experimenting.
Example:
A thin rectangular plate having a width w and a height h is located so that it is normal to a moving 
stream of fluid. Assume the drag D, that the fluid exerts on the plate is a function of w, h, the fluid 
viscosity m and density r, and the velocity V of the fluid approaching the plate. Perform a dimensional 
analysis of this problem.

total number of variables in the problem and r is the number of reference dimensions (up to 3).
	
k-r = 6-3=3	
so we have three free variables
4.	 Select dependent variables,
Select w,V and r as dependent variables ( Avoid choosing both w and h since they have the 
same dimension). The rest are free variables (D,m,h).
5.	 Form a P term by grouping one of the free variables with all dependent variables,
Starting with the free variable, D, the first P term can be formed by combining D with the 
dependent variables such that

Now, there are only three variables instead of six, which are much easier for experimental data 
analysis.
Dependent variables are also called repeating variables, and free variables are called nonrepeating 
ones.

Dimensional analysis can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed and improve the data 
processing efficiency.
1)	 One Π term
Example: Assume that the drag D, acting on a spherical particle that falls very slowly through 
a viscous fluid is a function of the particle diameter d, the particle velocity V, and the fluid

For problems involving two P terms, results of an experiment can be conveniently presented

It is still possible represent three variable problems in 3D graphics. Mathematically, surface

This is the prediction equation and indicates that the measured value of obtained with the model will 
be equal to the corresponding for the prototype as long as other pi terms are equal.
In many hydraulic engineering problems, models are with free surfaces (rivers, estuaries etc). Force F is 
linked with length, velocity, viscosity, and gravity acceleration, hence

In practice, it is usually impossible to satisfy all the Π terms, so it is important to identify the dominant 
terms. The Froude number is very common in river modelling, which represents gravitational forces in 
dominance. Hence, the Froude numbers for the model and the real-world structure (prototype) should 
be the same.

Open Channel Flow
7	 Open Channel Flow
7.1	
What is “Open Channel Flow”
Open channel flow is flow of liquid in a conduit in which the upper surface of the liquid is in contact 
with the atmosphere. The flows in the following cases are all open channel flow (include the one in the 
circular pipe).
There are many types of open channel flow and a common classification system is as follows.
Classifications 
 
Steady  
 Flow 
 
Unsteady  
 Flow 
 
By time 
 
By space 
 
Uniform  
 Flow 
 
Varied Flow 
 
Gradually Varied

Varied Flow 
The uniform flow refers to flow whose water depth, width, flow area and velocity do not change with 
distance. If any of these factors change, the flow will be called varied flow (or nonuniform flow).

Open Channel Flow
The steady flow refers to flow factors and variables that do not change with time, otherwise the flow will 
be called unsteady flow.
7.2	
Channel Geometric Properties
The measurable geometric properties of channels are:
Depth (y), Area (A), Wetted perimeter (P), Surface width (B)
They are aggregated into two useful factors:
Hydraulic radius (R=A/P), Hydraulic mean depth (Dm=A/B)

Introduction
Definition: Water depth, width, flow area and velocity do not change with distance.
An important term in hydraulics is flow rate or discharge. It is defined as the volume of water that passes 
a particular reference point in a unit of time. Its common units are m3/s or cumecs (other units: cfs , 
mgd, etc).
To understand how large 1m3/s is, here is an example.
Example:
If the daily water consumption in Bristol is 300 liters/person, how many people would be provided with 
water by 1 m3/s flow?
Solution:
	
1000 24 3600( /
) /300
288,000
l day
×

=
So it could supply water to 288,000 people in Bristol.
8.2	
Laminar or Turbulent Flow
As in a pipe flow, the Reynolds Number (Re) can be used to identify laminar and turbulent flow state 
for open channels.
Re  URV
P
where :
R	
hydraulic radius (m)	
	
	
r	
density (kg/m3), 1000 kg/m3
V	
mean velocity (m/s)	
	
	
m	
viscosity ( kg/m s), about 1.14 x 10-3 Ns/m2
Laminar Flow 	 	
Re < 500
Turbulent Flow	 	
Re > 1000
For practical open channel flows in civil engineering, usually Re >> 1000, i.e., turbulent flow (try  
Re for R=1m and V=1m/s).

Computation of Uniform Flow
There are two common problems to solve:
1) Determine the discharge given the depth
Example:
The normal depth of flow in a trapezoidal concrete lined channel is 2 m. The channel has a base width 
of 5 m and side slope of 1 (vertical):2 (Horizontal). Manning’s n is 0.015 and the bed slope So is 0.001. 
Determine the discharge Q and the mean velocity V.
Solution:

Channel Design

9.1	
Channel Design
Main purpose: to transport water between two points in a safe, cost-effective manner.
Channel Types: Unlined, Lined(with concrete), Grassed
Permissible Velocities
The maximum permissible velocity is the maximum velocity that will not cause erosion to the channel 
bed and walls.
The minimum permissible velocity is the lowest velocity that will prevent both sedimentation and vegetative 
growth. In general, 0.6 to 0.9 m/s is used.
Freeboard is the vertical distance from the top of a channel to the water surface at the design condition.
Freeboard
Water Depth
In design, 5% to 30% of the depth of flow is commonly used for freeboards.
9.2	
Compound Channel
It is common to use compound channels in practical engineering projects to cope with different flows so 
that the sediments and vegetation in the channel could be controlled. However, the hydraulic computation 
for compound channels needs a special treatment as demonstrated by the following example.

The Best Hydraulic Section
A channel can have many shapes and dimensions. However, certain types of channels are better at 
conveying flows than others.
Example: The following channels have the same amount of excavation (cross section area), as well as the 
same Manning’s n and bed slope. Which channel is the best hydraulically?

2.	 A rectangular, concrete lined channel (Manning’s n = 0.015) is to be constructed to carry 
flood water. The slope of the channel bed slope is 1 in 500. The design discharge is 10m3/s. 
(a) Calculate the proportions of the rectangular channel that will minimize excavation 
and result in the optimum hydraulic section. (b) If the cross sectional area of flow is kept 
the same as in part (a) but for safety reasons the depth of flow in the channel is limited to 
1.00m, what will be the discharge now?
 (Answer: a) B=2y=2.89 m b) 9.55m3/s)
3.	 Compare semicircular section with rectangular and trapezoidal sections to show that it is 
the most hydraulically efficient.
4.	 Show that the best hydraulic isosceles triangular section is one-half of a square.

Critical Flow
10	 Critical Flow
Similar to airplanes with supersonic and subsonic speed classifications, water flow in open channels can 
also be classified into supercritical and subcritical flows. As a counterpart to the sound speed, the wave 
speed (also called celerity) is used in hydraulics.
10.1	
Small Wave in Open Channel

Push
A small wave can be generated in an open channel by pushing a plate. The celerity of a small wave in 
open channel is
c

The derivation of this formula is explained in the unsteady flow chapter.
If a pebble is dropped into a channel with flowing water, the pattern generated could be one of the 
following cases that represent the four types of flow.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Rapidly Varied Flow
11	 Rapidly Varied Flow
For a rapidly varied flow, its water surface profile changes suddenly. This occurs when there is a sudden 
change in the geometry of the channel (to be described in this chapter) or in the regime of the flow 
(hydraulic jump, to be described in the next chapter).
11.1	
Sudden Transitions
Transitions with a change of cross-sectional dimensions occurred in a relatively short distance
The energy equation is used to solve these problems.

2.	 Water is flowing at a velocity of 3.4 m/s and a depth of 3.4 m in a channel of rectangular 
section with a width of 3.4m. Find the changes in depth produced by
1)	 A smooth contraction to a width of 3.0m
2)	 The greatest allowable contraction for the flow to be possible upstream as described.
(Answer: 3.0m, 2.89m)
3.	 The normal depth of flow in a rectangular channel (2m deep and 5m wide) is 1m. It is laid 
to a slope of 1m/km with a Manning’s n=0.02. Some distance downstream there is a hump 
of height 0.5m on the stream bed. Determine the depth of flow (y1) immediately upstream 
of the hump and the depth of flow (y2) above the hump. If the hump is reduced to 0.1m, 
what values will y1 and y2 be?

Hydraulic Jump
12	 Hydraulic Jump
A hydraulic jump occurs when a supercritical flow meets a subcritical flow. The resulting flow transition 
is rapid, and involves a large energy loss due to turbulence. The depth before the jump is called the initial 
depth and that after the jump is called the sequent depth.
It is used for dissipating energy in flow to protect dams, weirs, and other hydraulic structures.
12.1	
Jump Equation
Because significant energy loss in hydraulic jumps, the energy equation is not a suitable tool in hydraulic 
jump analysis, therefore the momentum equation is applied.

Questions 12
Hydraulic Jump
1.	 Water is flowing at a rate of 10m3/s through a rectangular channel 4 m wide, at a depth of 
0.5 m. A weir downstream causes the water to backup the channel and a hydraulic jump 
occurs. Find the sequent depth and the loss of energy at the jump.
 (Answer: 1.37m, 0.234 m)
2.	 Water flows in a rectangular channel at a depth of 30cm and with a velocity of 16m/s. If a 
downstream sill forces a hydraulic jump, what will be the depth and velocity downstream of 
the jump? What head loss is produced by the jump?
(Answer: 3.81m, 1.26m/s, 9.46m)
3.	 Starting from the first principles, show that the following equation holds true for a hydraulic 
jump in a trapezoidal channel:

13	 Hydraulic Structures
Hydraulic structures are devices which are used to regulate or measure flow (weirs, flumes, spillways, 
gates, etc). The energy equation is applied to estimate the discharge and the momentum equation is used 
to calculate the forces on the structures.
13.1	
Flumes (Venturi)
Flumes are used to measure discharge in channels. The energy equation is used to derive the flume formula.

If the width b is small enough, there will be a critical flow in the throat (also it will cause backwater 
upstream to get extra energy and a hydraulic jump after the flume to get rid of the energy gained from the 
backwater).

Example Venturi Flume
An open channel is 2 m wide and of rectangular cross section. A venturi flume having a throat width 
of 1.0m is installed at one point. Estimate the discharge:
a)	 if the upstream depth is 1.2 m and a critical flow occurs in the flume
b)	 if the upstream depth is 1.2 m and the depth in the throat is 1.05 m
(Take Cv=1 and Cd=0.95)

Hydraulic Structures
Broad crested weirs are robust structures and usually used in larger rivers in comparison with flumes. 
However, flumes usually create relatively smaller backwater (or afflux) than weirs and hence less energy 
loss. The floating debris can usually pass through them smoothly (a useful feature in sewerage treatment 
works).
13.3	
Energy dissipators
Kinetic energy in flow can erode the foundation of dams and other hydraulic structures. It is important 
that excessive energy should be dissipated to protect the foundation.

will occur in the channel. The sequent depth y3 can be derived from the depth at y2. If the downstream

It is possible to derive y=f(x) from a simple differential equation. For example, if dy / dx = 0.5, the solution 
for it would be y = x/2 + c, where c is a constant. There are an infinite number of curves by changing 
the c value. To uniquely identify the profile, a control point is required (i.e., a boundary condition).

y=x/2+ c

Control Point
y=x/2+ 3 
For example, if y=3 when x=0, the curve function would be fixed as y = x/2 + 3.
For practical flow profile computation, there are three types of solutions: 1. direct integration; 2. graphical 
integration; 3. numerical integration. The first two methods are superseded by numerical integration 
methods due to the widespread use of computers.

Unsteady Flow
16	 Unsteady Flow
16.1	
Basic Types
If the flow velocity at a point varies with time, the flow is called unsteady flow. They can be further 
divided into (in a similar way as to steady flow types):
a)	 Rapidly varied unsteady flows: Surges and bores by dam break, quick operation of control 
structures, tidal effects
b)	 Gradually varied unsteady flows: Translatory waves by flood waves, slow operation of 
control structures (gates, etc.)

Unsteady Flow
A surge wave results from a sudden change in flow (e.g., a partial or complete closure of a gate that 
increases the depth), called positive surge (similar to water hammers). It is termed as a bore if caused by 
tides. The momentum equation is used in a similar way to hydraulic jumps. A surge can be considered 
as a steady flow case if an observer is travelling at the surge speed.

There are two equations so the two unknowns can be solved (with the three knowns). Iterations are 
usually required in the nonlinear calculations (assume Vsrg=0, calculate the other unknown from the 
continuity equation, then get Vsrg from the momentum equation, enter it into the continuity equation 
again to get the other unknown, repeat the process until the required accuracy is achieved). Note, the 
surge velocity is much faster than small solitary waves.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Total water power from the gross energy head if expressed in Watt
P = rgHQ (Watt)
where
P= total water power by gross energy head (Watt)
H= gross energy head (m)
Q= discharge (m3/s)
r=density of water (1000 kg/m3)
2) Efficiency
Efficiency of a hydraulic machinery device is measured as the ratio of energy output to input. The overall 
efficiency of a hydro power plant/pumping station is a product of the efficiencies of its several elements.
hs=h

2…hn
Hydropower plant/pumping station output power
Po = hsPi
where
Pi = Input power (Watt or K Watt)
Po= Output power (Watt or K Watt)
hs= Overall Efficiency
3) Hydroelectric power
Water is dammed and then diverted through a mechanical device to convert water’s kinetic energy into 
rotational energy which can then be converted into electrical energy in a generator.

b) Loss of land suitable for agriculture;
c) Relocation of highways, railroads, even small towns;
d) Change of local environment;
e) Long transmission line.
System Components
a) Hydraulic Works; b) Power House; c) Turbines; d) Generators; d) Power lines.
Classification of Hydropower Plant
a)	 Storage Plant has a reservoir of sufficient size to develop a firm flow substantially more than 
the minimum natural flow.
b)	 Run-of-River Plant can use water only as it comes. It is cheaper than the storage plant of 
equal capacity, but suffers seasonal variation of output.
c)	 Pumped Storage Plant generates energy at peak load and at off peak, water is pumped from 
the lower pool to upper pool.

a)	 Abstraction from surface sources: water is fed from an open-surface source such as canal, 
river, or a reservoir, often through a sump and intake. The water level may change over a 
large range and sediment trapping structure may be necessary.
b)	 Water supply from treatment plants: treated water from treatment plants is usually supplied 
to a distribution network or a storage tower-reservoir through a pumping station. The water 
is clear and free from sediments, hence no screen and sediment settling structure is needed.
c)	 Storm water pumping: storm water is full of suspended sediments and a coarse screen should 
be installed before the pump’s intake. The pumping station is used intermittently.
d)	 Sewage (untreated) pumping: a sewage pump should be able to pass all solid matter through 
its system. Stagnant areas or corners must be avoided.
e)	 Abstraction from borehole: the pumps used are normally less bulky (around 100-400 mm 
diameter), which could be fitted into well diameters of 150-600mm.
17.2	
Turbines
A turbine is a device that converts the energy in water into rotating mechanical energy.
1) Classification of Turbines
a)	 Impulse Turbines: use water velocity to move the runner, rather than pressure (e.g., Pelton 
Wheel).
b)	 Reaction Turbines: mainly use pressure rather than velocity (e.g., Francis turbine and 
Propeller turbine).

A Pelton Wheel is a disc with buckets attached to the outside edge. The jet strikes the buckets one at 
a time, causing the wheel to spin. For a Francis turbine, water is introduced just above the runner and 
all around it and then falls through, causing it to spin. A Propeller Turbine resembles a boat propeller 
running in a tube and operates on a similar principle. Type ‘Pelton Wheel’, ‘Francis turbine’ and ‘ Kaplan 
turbine’ in Wikipedia for further information.
Selection of turbines is based on the following factors: performance (i.e. efficiency at various discharges), 
energy production, machine cost, availability, powerhouse construction cost, etc.
2) Hydraulics of Turbines
The geometry of turbines is specifically shaped so that the fluid exerts a torque on the rotor in the direction 
of its rotation. The shaft power generated is available to drive electric generators. The hydraulics of a 
Pelton Wheel is used here to illustrate the application of the momentum principle in turbine analysis. 
The wheel has a series of split buckets located around its periphery. When the jet strikes the dividing 
ridge of the bucket, it is split into two parts that discharge at both sides of the bucket. The speed of the 
wheel is kept constant under varying load through use of a governor that actuates a mechanism that 
changes the setting of the nozzle.

decrease in efficiency occurring when the load drops below about 30% of normal load. The efficiency 
of propeller turbines is very sensitive to load, and a significant drop in efficiency is experienced as the

The discharge and head curve is the most important curve among the pump characteristics. It demonstrates 
that a pump can deliver a wide range of discharges but there will be the changes in pressure as the discharge 
changes. The speed of at which the pump runs can also change the discharge and head. Each curve is 
produced under a specified speed and several curves should be obtained from the manufacturers under 
different speeds so that a whole picture can be obtained. In the curve, the normal operating condition 
is represented as 100% and all other values are relative to this point. It can be seen that all pumps have 
higher heads at low discharge and lower heads when discharges go up.

Efficiency (%)
All pumps need power to rotate their impellers. The amount of power needed depends on the speed 
of a pump and the head and discharge required. For centrifugal pumps the power requirement is low 
when starting up but it rises steadily as the discharge increase. For axial pumps, the trend is different. 
There is a very large power demand when starting up and it will decrease as discharge increases. Mixed 
flow pumps lie in between other two types and their power consumption is more uniformly distributed.
Discharge and Efficiency
It is quite important to consider the pump efficiency under its operational conditions, because of losses 
occurring in transferring fuel energy to water energy via the power unit and pump. The losses are caused 
by friction and water turbulence. The maximum range of efficiency is usually between 30 and 80% so 
there is only limited range of discharges and heads over which pumps operate at maximum efficiency.
2) Initial pump selection
Many features of a pump are summarised into one factor, i.e., specific speed, which provides a common 
base for comparing pumps. It is the speed at which a pump will deliver 1m3/s at 1.0m head when operating 
at peak efficiency and is calculated as

Specific speed is independent of the pump size so it describes the shape of the pump rather than how 
large it is.

A user can calculate the specific speed required and check the table to find the suitable pump types.
3) Similarity and pump model
From dimensional analysis, the scaling law can be derived, so it is possible to experimentally determine 
the performance characteristics of one pump in the laboratory and then use these data to predict the 
corresponding characteristics for other pumps with the geometrically similar shape under different 
operating condition. The two geometrically similar pumps will have the same specific speed.

Example: A centrifugal pump having an impeller diameter of 1m is to be constructed so that it will 
supply a head rise of 200m at a discharge of 4.1m3/s of water when operating at a speed of 1200rpm. 
To study the characteristics of this pump, a 1/5 scale geometrically similar model operated at the same 
speed is to be tested in the laboratory. Determine the required model discharge and head rise based on 
the pump similarity law.

Duty Point
A duty point refers to the point in terms of head and discharge at which a pump normally operates. 
There are many pumps on the market and there may be several that can meet the duty point or near it. 
The next is to examine the efficiency of each pump at the duty point and select the one that will operate 
near the maximum efficiency.

The pipeline could have a few diameter options and several pipeline curves could be generated by the

considering the initial capital cost and running cost of the whole system should be used as the final 
decision criterion.
Example: Water is to be pumped from a river through a 150mm diameter pipeline 950m long to an 
open storage tank with a water level 45m above the river. A pump is available and has the discharge ~

Series and parallel arrangement
When the required flow or head is greater than a single centrifugal pump, two or more pumps could be 
combined to meet the demand. Also if the demand varies greatly with time, it is desirable to have a few 
smaller pumps that can be run in parallel instead of a single one.
To increase the head, two or more identical pumps are operated in series. The same flow passes through 
Pump 1 and Pump 2 so that the discharge is the same as individual pumps but the head is doubled (in 
case of two pumps). The discharge~head curve for two pumps can be obtained by taking the curve for 
one pump and doubling the head for each value of discharge. Like in series electricity circus, the whole 
system breaks down when one pump stops.

To increase the discharge, two or pumps could be operated in parallel. Again the pumps must be identical, 
have individual suction pipes but share a common delivery pipe. The head is the same as for a single 
pump but the discharge is doubled. The dischare~head curve is obtained by taking the curve for one 
pump and doubling the discharge for each value of head. Usually one pump is used to provide low flow 
demand and other pumps are used to provide extra flow when the demand is increased.

Cavitation and safe installation height
Z
When a pump is operating, it draws water from the sump and the water is pushed by the atmospheric 
pressure. At the sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about 10m of water head and would be considerably 
less in high mountains. Considering the hydraulic loss along the pipeline, the practical limit is below 
7 meters. In addition, low pressure will increase the possibility of cavitation within the pump, which 
occurs when the liquid pressure at a given location is reduced to vapour pressure of the liquid. When 
this occurs, vapour bubbles form (the liquid starts to ‘boil’). Cavitation can cause a loss in efficiency as 
well as structural damage to the pump. To decide the maximum elevation for a pump installation, an 
important parameter is introduced: NPSHR (Net Positive Suction Head), which is a value provided by 
pump manufacturers as a reference for limiting suction lift under each discharge to ensure that a pump 
operates satisfactorily.

The actual NPSH for an installation can be calculated as NPSHa=Pa – Z- Vp – hL
where Pa is the atmospheric pressure (m), Z is the elevation difference between the pump and intake 
water level (m), Vp is the vapour pressure of water (approximately 0.5m, depending temperature) and 
hL is the head loss in the suction pipe (approximately 0.75m, local loss is more dominant). To prevent 
cavitation, it is necessary that

A centrifugal pump is to be placed above a large open water tank with discharge 14 litres/s. The required 
net positive suction head (NPSHR) is 4.6 m, as specified by the pump manufacturer. If the water 
temperature is 27oC and atmospheric pressure is 101.353 KPa, determine the maximum height Z, that 
the pump can be located above the water surface without cavitation. Ignore the friction loss, and the 
local loss is mainly caused by a special inlet filter with KL=20. The diameter of the inlet pipe is 10cm.

Surges in pumping stations
1. Pump stops suddenly and water 
continues to flow to create water column 
separation
2. Flow reverses and a sudden 
impact on the pump 
Water hammer can cause damages to the pipelines and this could also be a problem for pump mains, 
which is the slower mass movement of water often resulting from the faster-moving water hammer shock 
waves. When a pump stops, the flow in the pipe does not stop immediately but continues to move along 
the pipe. Since the driving force is gone and the water will gradually slow down due to friction. As the 
flow moves away from the pump and no water enters the pipe, the empty space forms near the pump. 
This is called water column separation and pressure in the empty space drops rapidly to the vapour 
pressure. Then the water begins to flow back towards the pump gathering speed as it goes, and comes 
to a sudden stop as it hits the pump (similar to a sudden closure of a valve on a pipeline). This could 
burst the pipe and the pump.
Possible solutions are:
1)	 Stop pumps slowly: This will avoid the water column separation and minimise the surge. 
Diesel pumps are more suitable for this solution since they stop gradually after the fuel is 
cut off, while electric pumps usually have sudden stop when the electricity is switched off.
2)	 Use a non-return valve: it will allow water to pass in one direction only and protect the 
pump (not the pipeline) when water flows back.

3)	 Use an air vessel: This is similar to a surge tank. When a pump stops and pressure starts to 
drop, water flows from a pressured tank into the pipeline to fill the void and stop the water 
column from separating, and water is allowed to flow back into the tank when the flow is 
reversed. The water will oscillate back and forth until it eventually stops through friction 
(much like a car shock absorbers). This device is expensive and should be used only for 
large scale pump stations where serious water hammers are expected.

1.	 Each day 600m3 of water is pumped by 10m to a tank above the ground. Calculate the 
amount of power required to do this (assume the system is 100% efficient and there is no 
energy loss in the pipeline).
(Answer: about 0.7 kW)
2.	 A Hydraulic power plant takes in 30m3/s of water through its turbine and discharges it at 
V=2m/s at atmospheric pressure. The head loss in the turbine and conduit system is 20 
meters. Estimate the power extracted by the turbine.
(Answer: 23.5 MW)

3.	 A power plant is to be built on a stream capable of utilising a flow up to 1 m3/s with a 
gross head of 40m at 78 percent overall efficiency. Assume the stream has enough flow to 
maintain the plant working at full capacity continuously and the power is valued at £0.05 
per kilowatt-hour. What annual revenue could be expected from this plant?
(Answer: £134,000)
4.	 A Pelton Wheel is to be selected to drive a generator at 600rpm. The water jet is 75mm 
in diameter and has a velocity of 100m/s. With the blade angle at 170o, the ratio of vane 
speed to initial jet speed at 0.47, and neglecting losses, determine 1) diameter of wheel to 
centerline of buckets (vanes); 2) power developed. (Note P
