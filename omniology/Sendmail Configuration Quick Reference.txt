What is Sendmail? 
Sendmail is the most popular mail server software and runs on Unix/Linux 
computers. The freeware version is available from: www.sendmail.org 
 
Sendmail relies on a configuration file sendmail.cf which normally resides 
in /etc/mail directory. It is not easy to modify this file directly. One should 
modify sendmail macro configuration file: /etc/mail/sendmail.mc and then 
generate sendmail.cf with m4 macro processor:  m4 
/etc/mail/sendmail.mc > /etc/mail/sendmail.cf 
 
For new configuration file to take effects, you must restart sendmail 
daemon. On Redhat, use:  service sendmail restart  
Macro Configuration File - sendmail.mc 
In sendmail.mc, any thing after “dnl” is treated as comments. A block of 
comments are delimited by divert(-1) and divert(0). To use string value, 
use back tick  (`) and end quota (') 
 
You must specify OSTYPE for OS dependent definitions, for example 
OSTYPE(`linux'). Optionally, you can specify using DOMAIN dependent 
definitions, e.g., DOMAIN(`generic').  Note: must use back tick  (`) and 
end quota (') to enclose a string value. 
 
At the end of .MC, give mailer for Internet and Local mail 
MAILER(smtp) 
MAILER(procmail) 
 
Use FEATURE(keyword) to enable desired features. Here are some useful 
keywords. For complete list of features, see 
http://www.sendmail.org/m4/features.html 
 
After you changing sendmail.mc, you generate new sendmail.cf with: 
m4 /etc/mail/sendmail.mc > /etc/mail/sendmail.cf 
Keyword 
Description 
redirect 
In aliases file, use following entry to tell 
sender the new address: 
foo:   foo@newplace.com.REDIRECT 
relay_hosts_only 
By default, names listed in /etc/mail/access 
treated as domain. Allow only computer name. 
access_db 
Turns on the access control feature. 
blacklist_recipients Turns on the ability to block incoming mail for 
certain recipient usernames, hostnames, or 
addresses. 
use_cw_file 
Read /etc/mail/local-host-names file to get 
alternate names for this host (for multiple host 
name). 
use_ct_file 
Read /etc/mail/trusted-users file to get trusted 
users that allow set sender address. 
virtusertable 
Used for host mutiple virtual domains. 
You can use define in .MC file to change some default settings: 
define(`ALIAS_FILE', 
`/etc/aliases') 
location of aliases file 
define(`SMART_HOST',`smtp.
your.com') 
use external outgoing server 
define(`confME_TOO', true) 
In aliases mailing, if sender is in the 
list, also send copy to the sender. 
define(`confMAX_MESSAGE_
SIZE', 0) 
Maximum size of mail (0: no limit) 
 
 
Access Control 
An access database can be created to accept or reject mails from selected 
domains or senders. You edit a text file /etc/mail/access. Each 
domain/computer/senders can be followed by: OK, RELAY, REJECT, or 
DISCARD. 
#--------------------------------------- 
#   SAMPLE of /etc/mail/access 
#--------------------------------------- 
localhost.localdomain   RELAY 
localhost                        RELAY 
127.0.0.1                       RELAY  
spammer@aol.com       REJECT 
 
After modifying access text file, you have to create database map with 
command: makemap hash /etc/mail/access.db < /etc/mail/access 
 
if FEATURE(use_cw_file) is used, sendmail will read /etc/mail/local-
host-names file to get alternate names for this host.  You can list machine 
names that treat as localhost for RELAY.  
 
Aliases file and $HOME/.forward 
A system wide aliases file (/etc/aliases) provides alternate names for 
individual users, forwarding of mail to other hosts and mailing lists. This is 
a text file. You can also include an external file in the aliases file 
 
aliasname: recipient[, recipient,...] 
listname:    :include: /path/filename 
 
After modifying aliases file, you must run newaliases to rebuild aliases 
database. 
 
An individual user can create a .forward file in his home directory to 
forward mails send to him. It is possible put many email addresses in the 
.forward file and use it as a mailing list.  
 
Keep a copy in mailbox and forward a copy
