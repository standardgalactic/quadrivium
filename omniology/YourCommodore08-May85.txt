"IF MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF LOVE, PLAY
on", wrote Shakespeare. And,  w it h
Spring in the air, who wants a lovesick
computer? Not us. To ensure that our
readers won't be reported to the A.C.L.C.
(Association f o r  Cruelty t o  Lovesick
Commodores) -  surely there is such an
institution w e  bring you this all-singing,
all-dancing, May-time music extrava-
ganza.
Those h e d o n i s t i c  h e a d s  a t
Commodore seem t o  have taken Mr .
Shakespeare a t  h is  w or d. Hav ing
equipped the 64 with a powerful sound
generator chip, SID -  Sound Interface
Device - and such music making facilities
as 3 separate voices, an 8 octave range.
modulation a n d  ﬁltering, they  have
provided a basis for one of the most
powerful music synthesisers available on
any micro computer.
Music and computers ar e well-
matched bedfellows. Although artistry
obviously plays a larger role in creating
music, there are similarities between this
and writing a computer program. Both
have a set of rules and structures to
follow: with music, for example, the rules
of harmony, counterpoint and timing.
Sound c a n  b e  reproduc ed o n
computers with great precision. I t  is
transmitted as electrical pulses and then
stored as binary digits in memory.
You certainly don't have t o  be a
musician or even a whizz at programming
to exploit such potential. Our new music
series will help you teach even the most
discordant Commodore to croon. Also
included in Your Commodore this month
is your very own music program to type in.
Or you can really cheat by jazzing up your
sluggish 64 with Siel's CMK 49 keyboard.
See our review.
But, maybe you think Shakespeare got
it all wrong. Music is anathema to your
ears, food is nothing more than bacon
sarnies a n d  c alor ies , a n d  y o u r
Commodore receives all the love it needs,
thank you very much.
OK, so you're the practical type. Well,
what c ould b e  more practical than
realising that some computer add-ons are
vastly overpriced and deciding that you
could probably do just as good a job
yourself, if only you knew how? Drop
your excuses, read our D.I.Y. series and
make your Commodore the envy of all its
fellow computers by kitting it out with a
vast array of  add-ons such as printer
interfaces, mother boards, video leads and
RAM/ROM cartridges.
C16 software
"64, 64 that's all they care about", I hear
you say. Not true. We realise that the C16
is fast becoming a  popular machine
(175,000 sales at the time of writing) and
this ﬁgure should increase now that some
retailers, such as Dixons plc, are selling it
at half price following the dramatic cut in
the pr ic e o f  t h e  Plus/4. Software
companies are, at long last, noticing this
machine although a  lot o f  the early
releases are of a low standard, many being
re-hashed versions of popular 64 games.
But, do not despair, as there are one or
two goodies appearing on the scene. The
LET Show at the end of February certainly
wouldn't win any prizes for innovative
software f o r  t h e  mor e popular and
established machines, but it offered a
glimmer o f  h o p e  t o  C 16 owners,
Commodore, for  example, have now
released over 50 titles, from arcade games
to sophisticated utilities, for the C16 and
Plus/4, a n d  o t h e r  c ompanies  -
Melbourne House, Tynesoft, Anirog,
Gremlin Graphics and CRI, to name a few
- are following suit. We review some C16
games in this month's Software Spotlight
section and, next month, we have a C16
software special. So, we don't yet want to
see an inﬂux of C16s and Plus/4s into our
Classiﬁed Ads section!
Survey
Enough of my views. We're always asking
for your views in this column and many of
you are certainly proliﬁc letter writers. But
not enough of you write and tell us about
yourselves or what you would like to see
more (or less) of in this magazine. So, your
forte doesn't lie in letter writing; you'd
sooner accept the status quo than put pen
to paper? Fear not! We've made it oh so
simply for you in our readers' survey. All
you need to do is tick a box or string a few
words together i n  response t o  o u r
questions. What could be simpler? And
not only will the results enable us to
produce your type of magazine but one
lucky reader will win a 1541 disc drive.
Turn to the heart of Your Commodore -
it's crying for attention!

The new, portable Epson Ma
Now the home computer user can
have a true business quality printer,
from Epson -makerof the world's most
popular printers.
Our new P40 is only E99.95 -
that's including VAT and recharger.
It's suitable for BBC, Sinclair,
Commodore, Oric and almost any
other popular home computer, as well
as virtually any portable or desk top
micro.
Running off its own rechargeable
batteries as well as mains, your P40 is
totally portable and being Epson,
an absolute doddle to use. And though
particularly compact it even gives
EPSON
you 80-column width printing in
condensed mode.
So wherever and whenever you
want to print, now you can - with the
new, portable Epson P40. In fact,
anything a ball-point does, it can do -
better. See it at selected branches of
Boots, or ring 01-200 0200 for details.

AT A COST OF E125. WHAT DO YOU GET
for your money? Well ﬁrst and foremost, a
keyboard. And a very nice one at that. Its
got 49 keys, some of them black and some
of them white, so all looks in order.
Leading out the back is a ribbon cable
which terminates i n  a  cased edge
connector which allows you to plug it in
to the cartridge port. Of course the
hardware is useless without software so
there is either a tape or disc containing
the control program.
Having plugged the keyboard in. I
loaded the software from the tape. While
it was loading I had time to make and
drink ﬁve cups of coffee and my doctor
has now advised me to only use disc based
software in order to preserve my health!
As you might have guessed, the tape is not
turboed. Anyway the software ﬁnally
loaded and it was time to get down to
some serious music making.
The major stumbling block of the
CMK system is the manual. Considering
that most of the people who will buy this
package will have very little conception of
how a synthesiser works or how to go
about creating a sound. the manual fails
dismally. For a start it is only 26 pages long
and also contains Italian, French and
German translations. Admittedly it does
tell you how to work the software, but
nothing more. Luckily some of the preset
sounds are quite good, so if you don't
know how to program the SID chip then
all is not lost.
Putting aside the manual, let's look at
the software. After it has loaded you are
confronted with the main menu. This
offers you six options. With Edit Play,
which I imagine will be the most used
option, you are able to select one of the
voices stored in memory and play it using
the keyboard. Depending on which voice
you've chosen the keyboard will either
react monophonically (one note at a time)
or polyphonically (up to 3 notes at a time).
The response off the keyboard is very
good, the feel is very positive and this is
reﬂected in the software. I tried some very
fast cascading arpeggios and my ﬁngers
got tied in knots before the software!
If you decide that you don't like the
sound of the voice you can either select
another or. if you feel brave enough, edit
it. To edit the sounds you move a cursor
around the different 'sections' o f the

synthesiser using the function keys. The
values of the different parameters can be
changed using the + & keys. A quick
press of the F7 key and the computer will
go away and compile your sound so that
you can play it from the keyboard. All the
elements of the Commodore's SID chip
are accessible through th e  editing
software.
My two criticisms of the editing page
are, ﬁrstly, that it seems to be written in
BASIC and, is thus, a little bit on the slow
and pedantic side. Secondly, it would be a
great help if you could hear the sound
whilst you were changing the parameters.
It gets really annoying to have to tweak a
control and then wait for the sound to be
assembled before you can hear the
results: you end up going backwards and
forwards through the menus with boring
regularity before you get the sound right.
The Polyphonic New Sound and
Monophonic New Sound options let you
create a sound from scratch using the edit
page.
The most interesting section of the
software is the option labelled Midi
Master Keyboard. Using this page in
conjunction with Siel's MIDI interface
enables yo u  t o  play other MID I
compatible keyboards from the Siel
keyboard. Not staggering in its own right,
but Siel also give you the ability to split the
keyboard. So what you play on one half
goes to one keyboard and the other half
to another. Very nice if you like this sort of
thing.
The software rounds o ff with a
tape/disc save and load option and an exit
page. Also included are a couple of demo
songs which show o ff some o f the
Commodore 64's presets.
It is very difﬁcult to conclude whether
or not this is good addition to a 64 set up.
On the one hand the preset sounds and
the keyboard itself are very good.
Unfortunately th e  software and the
editing let it down. One addition which
Siel could make which would certainly
swing things in their favour would be an
inbuilt sequencer, so that you could at
least write and replay tunes.

STATEMENTS
LET'S go to the show
THE 1 9 8 5   LET S H O W  C O U L D
justiﬁably be renamed the 'LET Down'
show if judged solely on the lack of new,
exciting and innovative software on show.
But all was not doom and despondency.
For instance, the future is  deﬁnitely
looking brighter for the C16 with more
software companies taking this machine
seriously and producing software for it.
So, with an open mind and a positive
outlook, I  shall highlight some of the
plusses of the show.
Activision announced 10 new games.
all of which will eventually be available on
the Commodoree 64. This can't be bad
news coming from the company who
produced the chart-topping Ghostbusters
game.
Argus Press Software are really going
ﬁlm crazy. First there was Alien and now
their latest release is Give My Regards to
Broad St., based (loosely) on the ﬁlm of
the same name. The game involves
collecting the members of the band (who,
to facilitate your task, only travel on the
underground) within 15 hours t o  re-
create a missing tune. It includes the same
role-playing facility as Alien, along with a
sprinkling of McCartney music. If nothing
else, i t  w ill certainly improve y our
geological knowledge o f  the London
underground system!
Alligata Software are jumping on the
Frankie bandwagon with their latest 64
release, Blagger goes to Hollywood, And,
Anirog set out to prove that games alone
do not maketh a show with two new 64
utilities -  Super Sketch, a graphics tablet
enabling artistically inclined 64 users to
create video graphics, and Voice Master, a
speech synthesiser and music package.
Ariolasoft announced that i t  was
setting up its own direct selling scheme
for independent dealers and Audiogenic,
amongst other offerings, are planning a
C16 version of their Linkword Language
course in French and German and a 16K
RAM pack for the C16.
Bubble Bus dived into this sea o f
software with Aqua Racer, an arcade style
racing game for  the 64, while CRL
N e w s
presented a show within a show with a
viewing o f  their Rocky Horror Show
game.
Monty M o l e  creators, G r emlin
Graphics, were previewing Zargon Wars
for the C16. Two other C16 games are also
due for release from this company; they
are Petals of Doom and Tycoon Tex.
Turning our backs on software for a
moment, Kempston revealed a  new
joysticks duo a t  the exhibition. This
comprises t h e  Formula 1 ,  whic h i s
modelled on the Pro 5000 series with self-
centering and dual control ﬁre buttons
for right or left handed play, and the
Formula 2, which includes pistol grip for
fast ﬁring and top or base buttons.
Jeff Minter  o f  Llamasoft, after a
digression t o  the unhairy Psychedelia,
returned to the realms of his furry friends
with Mama Llama, his latest game for the
64.
Martech, makers of the Ofﬁcial Eddie
Kidd Jump Challenge further promoted
their sporting image with Brian Jacks
Superstar Challenge. And how to cope
with all those sporting injuries thus
acquired? lust pick up a copy of the
computer version o f  the Living Body,
based on the book and series of the same
name and privileged t o  boast as its
consultant, Professor Christiaan Barnard.
Melbourne House were one of the
ﬁrst software companies to sit up and
notice the C16. Roller Kong is already
available o n the C16 and Melbourne
House are soon to release C16 Wizard and
Princess, previously available on the VIC,
and C16 Classic Adventure.
On the more serious side, there was
Megabase, a  databas e f o r  t h e
Commodore 64 from Orpheus, Protek's
Powerplay joystick for the C16, a selection
of Commodore interfaces from RAM
Electronics and The Connection, a 64
interface, from Tymac.
Finally, Tynesoft had a whole host of
C16 games on show, as well as a C16
database called Superﬁle, and American
imports were well represented by  US
Gold who accompanied their display of
some excellent games with US music
and glamour girls. Maybe in American
eyes, whether trade or otherwise, a show
is always an excuse for an extravaganza.

Armchair antics

to call The Dukes of Hazzard a children's

his armchair, must be the Duke boys'

immortalising the Dukes as a computer
game might not beﬁt a family magazine!
That's what Elite intend to do. They
have signed an agreement with Warner
Brothers to launch a new computer game
based on the series. As with the series, the
main characters of the game are Bo and
Luke Duke (plus car, of course), and Boss
Hogg, Hazzard County sheriff. The game
sees them trying to outwit the bungling
Boss in a variety of adventures.
The Dukes includes nearly 100 frames
of animation on the car, and will be
available for the Commodore 64 in the
late Spring.

THE FIGHT AGAINST PIRACY IS AT LAST
being fought in the hallowed halls of
government. The Copyright (Computer
Software) Amendment B i l l  passed
successfully through its second reading in
the Hous e o f  Commons  o n  22nd
February. The bill will now have to pass
through a Committee stage and return to
the House o f  Commons for  a  third
reading_ If all goes well, it would come
into force two months after being passed
by the House of Lords and receiving royal
ascent.
If the Bill does become law, software
pirates could face very hefty ﬁnes and up
to two years' imprisonment. This would
greatly please William Powell, MP for
Corby, who ﬁrst proposed the bill, and
the members of the Federation Against
Software Theft (FAST), on whose behalf
he acted.
FAST is hoping to draw more public
attention to their campaign by producing
:
posters a n d  badges  f o r  national
distribution. These are far from tame with
such slogans as 'Beat the Cheats' and 'You
Wouldn't Steal the Hardware Don't Steal
the Software'. Hard Hitting stuff -  let's
hope it works and that Mr. Powell's bill
enjoys a smooth passage to the statute
book.

At last some of the best
Spectrum adventures are
available on the 64.
Melbourne House's Sherlock
and Incentive's Ket trilogy are
some of the games to ie
pulled out of Runecaster's
bag of goodies this month.
SOME MONTHS AGO WE MENTIONED
a very useful item from 'Print n'Plotter -
the Adventure Planner, 50 sheets of A3
size sheets especially designed to assist
the would be adventurer in keeping track
of his travels. Another couple of aids to
the weary and lost have been published
by Duckworth -  The Adventurer's
Companion (0.95) by Mike and Peter
Gerrard, and The Adventurer's Note-
book (L3.95) by Mike Gerrard.
The ﬁrst of these is really a 'cheat book'
for four of the better known adventures
namely: The Hobbit, Colossal Caves,
Adventureland and Pirate Adventure.
The book supplies a sensible solution to
all the problems you will come across, in
such a fashion that looking up your
present predicament will not spoil your
future enjoyment by giving away too
much! Also included are complete maps
of all the locations. The stated reason is,
for you to check the maps you have made
for yourself. Sadly here, it is all too easy to
learn too much!
The Adventurer's Notebook is mainly
just that, with over half the pages taken up
with blank maps for you to ﬁll out as you
explore an adventure. Alongside each
map is space for you to make notes on
objects found, verbs, nouns etc.
There are chapters explaining what
adventure games are, their history,
together with a few useful hints and tips
on playing them. There are also several
pages giving a helpful list of often used
words and their synonyms.
Looking at this book in a bookshop
you may well wonder if you want to spend
13.95 on it b u t  once you have been
given it for a birthday present you will
certainly use it!
64 Mountains
If all goes smoothly, by the time you are
reading this there should be a version of
the Mountains of Ket available for the
64. This proved to be a winner on the
Sinclair Spectrum and rumours have it
11.10
that an improved version is on the way for
us Commodore users.
Mountains of Ket, from Incentive Soft-
ware, interlinked trilogy of adventures,
the other two being The Temple of Vran
and The Final Mission.
Each game is a complete adventure
and may be played independently of the
other two. The puzzles are good and
although the games include a form of
combat, this does not seem to spoil the
games attraction (combat can introduce
-4•••••
an unacceptable random factor, that does
not ofte n enhance t he  normal
adventure!). The Commodore version
will include a new feature - an auto-map
drawing facility. With this, every time you
more to a new location, that location
automatically appears on the map. This
should certainly facilitate your course
through the adventure. Look out for
these; they are worth playing.. .we will
'delve' further when they send us the
Commodore versions.

Tale of two tecs
The core of  an adventure game is
exploration, both of locations and of the
objects you ﬁnd on your travels. What
better scenario, then, than that of a detec-
tive, story.
If you fancy a bit of deduction - two
'murder mysteries' are available for the
CBM 6 4  -  Deadline, a n Infocom
adventure marketed by Commodore, and
Sherlock from Melbourne House.
Deadline is text only and is only
available on disc. Like previous Infocom
adventures i t  has very extensive
descriptions of the locations and objects
found o n  your investigations. A
reasonably large vocabulary is under-
stood and complex sentence structure
may be entered.
The action takes place in the grounds
and the house of the late Marshall
Robner. The deceased was found two
days ago, apparently having taken an
overdose of  the drug Ebullion. The
number of  locations is quite small,
covering the two storey house (largish)
and the extensive grounds.
No graphics could hope to convey the
feeling that the wealth of  textual
description supplies. If anifthing, Infocom
has gone a little overboard this time with
the length of  some of the location
descriptions.
As you play the part of a sleuth, the
commands at your disposal are extended.
Not only can you EXAMINE the objects
around you but you can also SEARCH,
SEARCH NEAR and EXAMINE CARE-
FULLY! You may also dust an object
for ﬁngerprints or send something to the
police labs for analysis.
There are several people in the house
and grounds who may be considered as
suspects. They will move around in a
seemingly independent manner and may
or may not appear to take suspicious
actions. It is up to you to interrogate them
sensibly and form your own conclusions

as to their innocence or guilt.
You have only the one day, from eight
in the morning to eight in the evening in
which to form you conclusions. Each
move you make takes about one minute
so you should have enough time.
Deadline supports SAVE a nd
RESTORE and also the facility to have your
answers output to a printer for future
study! As with other Infocom games,
there is no facility to change the text or
background colours once the game is
loaded. If you ﬁnd the default switch-on
colours are not t o your liking for
prolonged viewing you must change
them prior to loading the game.
There are many advantages to a
complex command structure, such as
the feeling that you are really part
of the scene around you. There are
also some pitfalls! 'EXAMINE Sneezo
tablets' may seem OK to you, and you may
be surprised to be told: 'You can't see that
here.' The answer is simply that although
you can see the 'bottle of tablets' you
cannot see the tablets themselves until
you open the bottle. Such are the
ramiﬁcations of the more sophisticated
adventure game!
The instructions supplied with
Deadline are comprehensive, explaining
the major areas of your investigative
armoury i n  detail. There are also
transcriptions of the interrogations of the
people in the house at the time of death
read them carefully.
Sherlock by Melbourne House, as
the title may suggest, is a  hitherto
unknown adventure o f  the famous
detective S. Holmes Esq. of Baker Street,
London, aided and abetted by his faithful
friend and conﬁdant, Dr Watson. You
have much to live up to, as you are about
to play the part of the great sleuth himself.
The aim of the game is to solve a
number of  different crimes, while
avoiding being killed yourself! The action
takes place in 'real time', so travelling by
train to Leather Head (the scene of at least
two crimes) can become frustrating.
Using WAIT enables you to speed things
up to a more acceptable timescale.
This program also accepts complex
command sentences, such as - 'pick up
the note and take the lamp our of the
house'. Again with this more articulate(!)
type of input, you must take care that the
intent o f  your instruction is  fully
understood.
Sherlock uses an extended form of
'Inglish' previously used so successfully in
The Hobbit. The instructions are fairly
clear on how to issue various commands
but, in practice, this sometimes leads to a
gruelling challenge to ﬁnd out which
words the program really understands.
Neither, perhaps understandably, is one
completely clear on what you are
supposed to do!
The instructions inform us that the
Hansom Cab drivers of London do not
know where the railway stations are and
to get to Victoria Station we must ask to be
taken to Buckingham Palace Road! I
found this sort of thinking somewhat
disturbing especially when I realised that
to catch a train I would need to ﬁnd the
appropriate station and the right
platform!
The game comes with two additional
slips of paper that one can only suspect
were afterthoughts to save would-be
detectives from giving up too soon! These
are a fragment of a train timetable and a
'where to begin' hint sheet!
Mine may have been an early 'un-
debugged' version but, so far, the pro-
gram has crashed no less than ﬁve times
before I've managed to climb into the
hansom cab!
Having got to Victoria Station, I am not
always able to pay the cabbie! He gets
somewhat agitated but lets Watson and I
enter the station. Once you have boarded
a train, you then have to travel to the right
main line station to catch a train for
Leather Head.

number of the locations and they are
'drawn' to the screen very rapidly. The
music is reasonable for the ﬁrst minute or
so but, thereafter, becomes a  little
painful The text is informative and an
effort has been made to give it a Victorian
atmosphere.
You may SAVE and LOAD your present
position in the game and return later to
any particularly tricky situations. The
function keys may be used as single key
direction commands.
The instructions hint at all sorts of
interesting possibilities together with
independent action on the part of the
other people that you meet, but I have to
admit that I found this game boring. There
seem t o be  too many unecessary
restrictions put in your path, that have
little to do with detecting -  the train
sequence and the totally unexpected
sudden death of Sherlock Holmes -
neither of which are conducive to a long
addictive game.
Two Action Movies?
Well not quite, but moving towards that
idea. Having looked at the ﬁeld of arcade
adventures only two months ago, it is
interesting to see another couple of
contenders already on the shelves.
Dungeons of la  from Accelerated
Software Inc  and distributed by
Quicksilva, claims to be 'a real time
action interactive ﬁlm'. It might not
completely live up to that but, so far, it is
probably the arcade adventure that most
closely follows the classic 'Adventure'
pattern: explore, examine, learn, die,
explore, examine...
Unfortunately, it is only available on
disc, but then you were going to buy one
this year weren't you? (or you could even
win one, if you enter our survey - ed). The
scenario is pretty standard: you are an
adventurer searching for the fabled
'Stone of Ba', which is to be found under a
wined city. You enter the ruins which
promptly collapse behind you. Can you
„IAMBI
A d v e n t u r e s
survive, let alone
priceless stone?
Movement is by joystick only, as you
guide our hero (you) around a series of
screens, evading the guardians and traps
that abound, Each screen displays a few
passages and rooms for you to explore. In
some of these you will ﬁnd food, arrows
or strange potions. You will also trigger off
a selection of unpleasant surprises, some
lethal.
Having explored the obvious routes
that are visible you suddenly realise that
by moving your character near to, or at
certain walls, further hidden passages and
rooms can be found.
Move carefully and be careful what
you touch; it's amazing what can happen
when you pass over those strange ﬂashing
coloured lights.
Movement control is very smooth and
the graphics are good. Those giant cobras
are enough to give you nightmares! The
display is 'from above', giving a partial 3D
effect. The sound effects are something
again, especially when you are involved in
a punch-up with the baddies!
When you enter the dungeons you
have an energy level of 4000. As you move
about you expend some of this energy,
ﬁght a  monster and, of  course, it
decreases more rapidly. Certain actions
like ﬁnding food increase your energy -
but not by much!
The four function keys allow you to:
'Shield' yourself against the arrows that
appear from nowhere, 'Fire' an arrow at
an adversary, 'Fight' using less energy and
'Take' whatever you may ﬁnd in your
travels.
Of course you could just go into the
dungeons and have a jolly ﬁne romp for
however long your energy lasted, but that
is not the aim of the game is it.. The Stone
of la...remember?
After the ﬁrst few games it is obvious
that the 'screens' are a three by three
block, and that you are unable to get to
one of these nine. This intensiﬁes the hunt
for 'that something missing'; not one, but
win through with the
three items that have to be found before
you can descend to further levels. Search
for the Crown, the Key and the Sceptre,
then try for screen nine!
There are four levels to explore (if you
can reach them) and some 200 odd rooms
to search for food or weapons to keep you
alive -  graphics, sound, puzzles and
action this one's got the lot,
The Ultimate game?
The Staff of Karnath by Ultimate Play
the Game is up to their normal high
standard, with smoothly scrolling
graphics and plenty of action all round.
The number and variation of effects and
'creatures' met is most impressive.
It is certainly in the adventure mould
but, unlike Dungeons of Ba, it does
require the player to have fairly quick
reﬂexes and a good degree of joystick
dexterity.
You must guide Sir Arthur Pendragon
around the castle of the long dead
sorcerer Karnath. The aim is to ﬁnd 16
pieces of a pentacle 'key', which will
enable you to ﬁnd the legendary 'Staff of
Karnath'_ Having found it, you must then
destroy this evil artefact before it can
wreak its wicked will on the world.
As one might expect, this is not the
simple task it sounds! Karnath set a
number of otherwordly creatures to
guard against the Staff being stolen. Sir
Arthur has a number of spells at his
disposal...but there is a snag (isn't there
always?): he does not know which spell
will be effective against the different
creatures he will meet.
There is the additional problem of
having to complete the Staff's destruction
before the hour of midnight, this being
Walpugis Night, the predestined hour for
the evil to be let loose!
There are ten spells which may be
selected in rotation by pressing any key
(except F7, this pauses the game for you to
wipe the sweat from your fevered brow!).
You start with 100% energy and this
dwindles fairly rapidly as you move
around and are hit by the various evil
forces. Each time you ﬁnd a part of the
pentacle and take it to the ancient obelisk
where the staff is hidden, your energy
returns to 100%.
The action is fast and furious and you
must learn how to move around the castle
and evade the baddies. The number of
locations is not that great but do not think
this makes it any easier! There are several
puzzles to solve in order to secure the
'keys' - just being able to see them does
not mean you can as easily pick them up!
This is an addictive game but will
probably appeal more t o  those
adventurers who have a 'Space Invaders'
streak in them rather than the classic
'Adventurer'. Get your local computer
shop to show you its ﬁne graphics and
have a go.

Who W M  s e O W S t h i
64's resident software?' A.P.
and DJ. Stephenson do and
they're willing to share them
with you.
THE PERMANENT (RESIDENT) SOFT-
ware in the Commodore 64 is buried
within various ROM chips. The machine
code programmer cannot afford t o
disregard these ROMs because some
important subroutines are available free,
providing you know where they are in the
address map and how to use them. We
begin with some general information on
the ROMs.
The BASIC ROM
The RO M which handles the BASIC
language occupies position U3 on the
printed circuit board and bears the type
number 2364A. I t  is  located o n  the
memory map between the range o f
hexadecimal addresses A000 TO BEFF
(40960 to 49151 decimal). This represents
8K worth of intelligence. Now BK is a very
small amount of RAM in which to lay
down all the software for a BASIC inter-
preter. The system programmers have
done their best but there is no point in
denying that the Commodoree 64 will
never be renowned for the quality of its
BASIC. It is adequate but free of frills and
fuss. Because of this, there is a greater
need for, and consequently a greater
incentive to learn, machine code in order
to supplement BASIC.
The character generator ROM
The d o t  pattern f o r  512 different
characters are stored in the character
generator ROM which occupies position
U5 on the printed circuit board. It carries
the type number 2332A and has an
address map range from hexadecimal
D000 to DFFF (53248 to 57343 decimal).
This means there is 4K of address space
allocated just to store 256 characters. At
ﬁrst sight, this may appear rather a lot. But
remember the ROM is not storing 512
ASCII codes; it has the job of storing the
actual bit patterns required to paint each
character on the screen.
A character on the screen is built up
from a matrix of 64 tiny dots. The fact that
some characters, such as h a v e  only a
few dots should not deceive you because
the rest o f the matrix round the 'I'
must contain black dots! The dots
you can't see (logic 0) require just as much
storage space as those you can (logic 1).
Therefore, whatever the character, it still
requires 64 bits of storage space. This
means that each character requires 8
bytes. Therefore, a 4K ROM (4096 in real
money) is not so extravagent after all - it is
the minimum necessary to  store 512
characters. One set o f 256 characters
covers the upper case characters and
ﬁxed keyboard graphics. The other set of
256 character caters for the normal
typewriter-style, upper and lower case
characters.
We must emphasise again that the
ROM only provides the bit patterns. To
actually display a  chosen character, it
must be stored in that part of RAM
designated as screen memory t h e  range
of hex addresses between 400 and 7E7
(1024 to 2023 decimal). Note that this
represents exactly 1000 addresses,
organised on the screen as 25 lines each of
40 characters, Any character generated by
the RO M placed in  this area will be
displayed on the screen at a position
dependent on the current cursor or by a
suitable POKE,
The Kemal ROM
The operating system in the Commodore
64 is called the Kemal. the 8K Kernal ROM
sits in position U4 on the printed circuit
board and bears the type number 2364A.
The range o f  hexadecimal addresses
allocated to the ROM extends from E000
to FFFF (59344 to 65535 decimal). This
address range is right at the top o f
memory evidence of its importance. The
software within the Kernal ensures that
the conﬂicting demands of the machine
sub-units are dealt with in an orderly
fashion, according t o  priority. F or
example, keyboard scanning and the dis-
play system are all under the control of
the Kemal. The Kernal contains many
useful subroutines which can be tapped
by the machine code programmer, a list of
which will be given later.
The RAM chips
Some readers may consider discussions
on the layout of RAM to be of limited use

22
to a  machine language programmer.
However, enthusiasm for machine code
will increase with experience and can
eventually lead to projects which require
a more intimate knowledge of hardware
The 64K of  user RAM is provided
by a  bank o f  eight chips occupying
positions U12,U24,U11,U10,U22,U9 and
U21. All chips have the type number 4164-
2 and each has a capacity of 64K bits (not
bytes). Since the memory has t o  be
organised in bytes, eight RAM chips are
needed with their address wires, all
strapped together.
However, things are not as straight-
forward as they seem. There are only
eight address lines on a chip, labelled
MAO to MA7, which should mean that
only 28 (256) different address combina-
tions are possible - and yet we need 2. 16
(65,536) different addresses.
To reduce the number of pins on large
memory chips i t  has been common
practice for some years to supply the full
address i n  t w o  ins talments . T h e
addressing matrix within the 64K chip is
arranged in eight columns and eight rows.
Only eight address lines are needed to
feed the chip because two control lines,
CAS and RAS, switch the ﬁrst instalment
of eight to the row address and the next
instalment to the column address. The
steering is  handled b y  t w o  74IS257
multiplexer chips. (A multiplexer, in this
sense, is an electrically operated multi-
arm switch without moving parts.)
Introducing Kemal subroutines
As mentioned previously, the Kernal
contains some useful subroutines which
can be utilised in your own programs. It is
surprising how much thought is needed
to write machine code for even the most
simple operations. For example. it is by no
means easy to code a routine to scan the
keyboard to see if a key has been pressed
and, furthermore, to ﬁnd out which key it
was. It may be within your capacity after a
little experience but, in the meantime, it
saves a lot of worry if you pinch such
routines ready made from the Kemal.
They form a valuable source of machine
code building bricks for splicing into
sections of your own code. The Kemal, as
far as we are concerned, should b e
visualised as a jump table containing a set
of addresses for calling up the various
subroutines, Some are called by a direct
jump to the given address but the more
important, and more commonly used,
subroutines are called via an indirect
jump.
The t e c h n iq u e  o f  loc ating a
subroutine by means of an indirect jump
is well known and is not at all peculiar to
the Commodore 64. The reason for this
apparently roundabout method is based
on the possibility of a future ROM update
by manufacturers. No ROM operating
system o r  BASIC interpreter remains
'perfect' for long. Tiny snags or 'awkward
features' are brought to the attention of
the design team by end users, although it
is a matter of polite protocol to refrain
from calling them bugs.
After a few months, or perhaps years,
of use, the original Mark 1 ROM may be
replaced by an updated Mark 2 version
with awkward features removed and with
perhaps a few extra facilities thrown in as a
bonus. It will be appreciated that many of
the old subroutine addresses would be
shifted around a little in the update ROM
and would mean that software prepared
on the old ROM may no longer operate
on the new ROM. Software incompata-
bility between the old and the new has
disastrous effects on the reputation of the
manufacturer.
An indirect jump table is  a neat
solution to the problem. It works because,
although the actual subroutines in the
new ROM may have a different calling
address, the contents of the locations
holding t h e  j u m p  v e c t o r  a r e
correspondingly changed to match them.
As an example, suppose that in the old
ROM, the address of a certain subroutine
was given as $FID2. In point of fact, this
will not be the actual address. It is merely
the address of a location which holds the
subroutine address. in other words, it is
the address vector rather than the address
itself. The Kernal jump tables are always
changed in a new ROM so that they match
the old ROM as far as calling addresses are
concerned. (All memory management
and input and output subroutines are
handled by the Kemal). To sum up, the
overall advantages of the Kernal system
calling on the resident subroutines are as
follows:
1. T h e  user is  allowed freedom t o
intercept t h e  standard operating
system call by simply changing the
vectored address.
2. I t  allows the user t o  modify the
normal call or to write in some extra
code.
3. O perating system ROMs can b e
updated a n d  modiﬁed without
affecting previously written software
because new ROMs will retain the
old subroutine calling addresses.
Those with fearless and reckless natures
can, i f  they wish, bypass the ofﬁcial
subroutine Kernal addresses and, b y
ferreting out the actual addresses, jump
straight to them. This saves a little on
execution time but it could be at the
expense of personal tranquility!
Using Kemal subroutines
There are many of these but, to avoid
confusion, we shall concentrate on the
few m o s t  c ommonly  us ed. Eac h
subroutine has its own special rules for
successful operation but, in general, you
will n e e d  t o  satisfy t h e  following
requirements;
(a) The subroutine NAME
Example: CHRIN
This is for mnemonic purposes only. You
cannot directly call up a subroutine by its
name unless you previously assign it to the
actual calling address.
(h) The calling address
Example: SHCF
This is the Kernal calling address and will
be given in hexadecimal.
(c) Communication registers
Example: A,X
Certain information may require loading
into certain registers before a call can be
made.
(d) Registers affected
A subroutine requires registers to carry
out the work. It is up to the programmer
to make arrangements to store valuable
data already in these registers before

P r o g r a m m i n g
calling the subroutine. Otherwise, the
data could be corrupted -  a common
source of bugs.
(e) Stack requirements.
Nearly all Kernal subroutines use some of
the stack locations. Knowing how many
they need can often be useful information
if there is an imminent danger of stack
overﬂow.
(f) Error returns
Some subroutines can act like a bomb
under c ertain conditions. I f  thes e
subroutines return with the carry bit set, it
indicates that an error condition has been
detected. The error number will be left in
the accumulator.
(g) Preparation subroutines
Some subroutines will only work if certain
others are called ﬁrst because they may be
nesting within each other.
(b) Function
This takes t h e  f or m o f  a  concise
description of the action, which isn't an
easy task. The various things which go on
must be described completely and must
cover all possible conditions of use.
In the following description of Kernal
subroutines, we have taken the easy way
and covered only  the most common
applications. Readers who want full data
should c ons ult t h e  " Commodor e
Programmer's Reference Guide", which
should b e  considered the overriding
authority. T o  simplify matters, t h e
following description of certain Kernal
subroutines will assume that only the
default peripherals, the keyboard and
screen, are of interest. A full description,
taking i n t o  ac c ount a l l  pos s ible
input/output devices, can obscure the
underlying simplicity.
Getting characters from the
keyboard
The keyboard, although we tend to think
of it as 'part' of the computer, is really
nothing more than one o f  the input
peripherals. Input could come from a
variety of sources - a tape read, a ﬂoppy
disc transfer or  joystick. However, the
operating system does realise that the
keyboard is the most common source of
input so it is awarded default status. That is
to say, a  request for  input is always
assumed t o  have originated from the
keyboard unless there is an overriding
instruction to the contrary. Similarly, the
screen, although only one of a variety of
possible output peripherals, is recognised
to be the most used and so, in common
with the keyboard, is awarded default
status.
CHRIN
function: Places one byte of data from a
previously chosen input device into the
accumulator, defaulting to the keyboard.
In addition, the cursor is turned on and
continues blinking until the keyboard
character is  recognised as a  carriage
return (ASCII 13). Up to 80 characters, a
logical screen line, can be retrieved one at
a time by calling this routine.
Calling address: SFECE (65487 decimal)
Communicating registers: Accumulator
Registers affected: A,X
Error returns: 0
Preparation subroutines: none required
unless the input is to come from a source
other than the keyboard.
Stack requirements: seven bytes.
The following two lines indicate how to
transfer one keyboard character into the
accumulator and then store it in address
SC200.
JSR
STA $C200
This is simple but, as we have mentioned
several times, it is far better to ﬁrst assign
the variable names to absolute addresses
so the following method is preferable,
even if it appears rather long-winded.
CHRIN = SHCF
SAVE =SC200
JSR C H R I N
STA S A V E
The next example develops the idea
further by using a loop to transfer a stream
of keyboard characters into consecutive
memory loctions until such time as a
carriage return is detected. Note that, this
time, we have included assignments and a

RIS
possible program counter address.
Note that index addressing, using the Y
register, is used for storing the characters
in the memory block. The loop continues
indeﬁnitely u n t il t h e  accumulator
contains 13. CHRIN, used in this way,
bears a  close similarity t o the INPUT
statement of BASIC
SCNKEY
Function: A s  its  name implies, t h e
keyboard is  scanned and, if  a key is
pressed down, places the ASCII value in
the keyboard input buffer. It features
interrupt action_
Calling address: SiFF9F (65439 decimal).
Communicating register: Accumulator
Registered affected: Accumulator. X and
Y.
Error returns: 0
Preparation subroutines: nil
Stack requirements: ﬁve bytes
This subroutine is seldom needed on its
own. Its main use is to preceed the GETIN
subroutine.
GETIN
Function: Removes one character from
the keyboard buffer queue and places its
ASCII value in the Accumulator. If queue
is empty, the accumulator will contain O.
Calling address: SFEE4 (65508 decimal).
Communicating register: A
Register affected: Accumulator, X and Y
Preparation subroutines: SCNKEY
Stack requirements: seven bytes.
We must be careful with this one because
it only  transfers characters from the
keyboard buffer, not the keyboard. The
most obvious preparation subroutine
would be SCNKEY. The two combined
would represent a reasonable simulation
of the BASIC keyword GET because
SCNKEY provides the liason between
keyboard and keyboard buffer, while

P r o g r a m m i n g
GETIN provides the liason between the
buffer and t h e  Accumulator. T h e
following illustrates how  a  'wait f or
character' loop can be written:
JSR SCNKEY
BACK J SR GETIN
CMP 0
BEQ BACK
CHROUT
Function: Outputs a character t o the
screen at the next printing position. The
ASCII code for the character must be
resting in the Accumulator before theca!!
is made.
Calling address: $FFD2 (64590 decimal).
Communicating register: Accumulator
Registers a f f e c t e d :  O n l y  t h e
Accumulator.
Preparation subroutines: nil
Error returns: nil
Stack requirements: eight bytes
We ended last month with a  simple
example using CHROUT. The one that
follows shows how to use it in conjunction
with a few of our previous subroutines.
BACK SCNKEY4FF9F
GETIN=SFFE4
CHROUT=SFED2
*=$C000
ISR SCNKEY
CMP 4 2
BEQ SKIP
JSR CHROUT
IMP BACK
SKIP R T S
SCN KEY puts the keyed character into the
buffer queue. GETIN transfers character
to Accumulator. If the character happens
to be " le' (ASCII 42), the BEQ causes a
branch to RTS which is a loop exit. If the
character is  not "Itr", the subroutine
CHROUT is called and the character is
printed on the screen. This is followed
by an unconditional jump to BACK ready
for the next character. The program can
function as a simple typing exercise loop

which continues until y ou enter the
asterisk. Yes, we know it can all be done
more easily using BASIC but we are
supposed to be learning machine code!
Function: Reads the current three-byte
value o f  t he system clock into t he
Accumulator, X and V registers. The most
signiﬁcant byte is left in the Accumulator
and the least signiﬁcant in Y.
Preparation subroutines: nil
Call address: $FFDE (65502 decimal)
Registers affected: Accumulator. X and Y.
Error returns: nil
Stack requirements: two bytes
The three byte number is in units of 1/60
second formerly known as the 'jiffy'. The
following shows how we might store the
three bytes in consective locations, the
least signiﬁcant in TSTOR.
RDTIM =WI D E
TSTOR =$C200
CHROUT =SF 1)2
-1r=$ C 000
STY T S T O R
SIX I S T O R + 1
STA T S T O R + 2
RIS
Instead of storing the bytes, we could
arrange to display them on the screen
with:
Note that the Accumulator is displayed
ﬁrst because it is the most signiﬁcant byte.
We then transfer X (which holds the next
signiﬁcant byte) into the Accumulator
before w e  use CHROUT• Lastly, w e
transfer Y before using CHROUT. These
'few lines do not take into account where
on the screen the time is to be printed. To
avoid further complication, we have to
put u p  with the printing position as
deﬁned by  the currcat cursor_ This is
where the next subroutine can be useful.
PLOT
Function: Depending on the state of the
carry bit before calling. PLOT can be used
to either ﬁnd out the value of the cursor
X,Y coordinates or  to actually set the
cursor position t o  a given set o f  XY
coordinates.
To ﬁnd what the coordinates are, set
the carry before calling. The coordinates
will then be returned to the X and Y
registers.
To set the cursor coordinates to any
position, clear the carry before calling
PLOT and load the X and Y registers
with t h e  d e s ir e d  c o o r d in a t e s .
Unfortunately, you can get into a mess
here because, for some reason, the X and
Y appear to be chosen 'user-antagonistic'
rather than 'user-friendly'. The position
along a row, the column position, is the Y
value. The position down the screen, the
row number, is the X value.
Communication registers: Accumulator x
and Y
Preparation subroutines: nil
Error returns: nil
As an example, suppose we want to move
the cursor to the Bth position along the
ine and 6 lines down. We might write:
PLOT =SEFF0

THE WELLETE
In the ﬁrst installment of a
four part series on making
music on the 64, Phil South
concentrates on synthesis and
making sound.
IN ORDER TO MAKE SOUNDS WITH A
synthesiser, y ou need t o  know what
sound is, how a synthesiser makes sound,
how it 'colours' it and how it 'shapes' it.
Sound, as you probably remember
from physics lessons at school, is made up
of waves. A source object vibrates, thus
vibrating the air  around it, and the
resultant invisible concentric spheres of
sound radiate outward until they hit your
ear. Once there, the soundwaves vibrate
the air in contact with your eardrum, and
the tiny bones inside your ear decode the
speed of the vibrations (frequency) into
electrical messages that the brain can
understand.
The higher the number o f  waves
crammed into the space between your ear
and the source, the higher the sound - a
high frequency. The lower the amount of
waves between you and the source, the
lower the sound •:• a low frequency.
The c olour ' o f  t h e  s ound ( o r
'timbre'), is  basically the tone of the
sound. It might be high, ready sound, like
an oboe, or a deep, hollow sound, like the
bottom pipe o f  a church organ. The
colour of the sound is affected by the
'ﬁlter' and the 'waveform'. I'll explain
these in detail later on.
The shape o f  the sound, like the
difference between a sharp sound such as
a snare drum, or the slow build-up of a
bowed violin string, is affected by use of
the 'envelope' (which is nothing to do
with the GPO!). The envelope is also
known as the 'ADSR', which stands for
Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. This
refers to the way a note is triggered from
the keyboard. When you press the key,
the attack is how the note starts. With a
short attack, the note starts straight away.
With a long attack, the note builds up
slowly. If the note has a short decay, it tails
off almost immediately. If it has a long
decay, it rings on for a period of time. The
sustain length affects how long the note is
held if you continue to hold the key. The
release length affects how the sound dies
off when you release the key (Figure 1).
See ya later, Oscillator
The basic sound-making apparatus in a
synthesiser is called the oscillator. This is
the sound source. The SID chip has three
such oscillators, enabling you to build up
chords of three notes or complex sounds
requiring t w o  o r  t h r e e  differ ent
waveforms i n  c ombination. Eac h
oscillator, or 'voice', has a range of eight
octaves, from very low frequencies for
bass, to very high frequencies, for treble.
Since each voice hasn't got separate
column control, we must change their
combined volumes every time.
Each oscillator has a choice of three
waveforms: triangle, sawtooth, pulse and
noise (see Figure 2). As you can see, tri-
angle waves move straight up and down;
these have a woodwind sound. Sawtooth
Figure 1 — The 'envelope' in operation
PERED 64
waves look exactly like the teeth of a saw,
and have a tinny, reedy sound like that of a
brass instrument. Pulse waves are square,
but are the most versatile wave since the
width of the gaps, or 'pulse width', can be
ﬁnely adjusted to achieve a vast breadth
of different sounds, Finally, there is noise
which i s  a  r andom s elec tion o f
frequencies and is similar to the 'white'
noise made by  the T V set between
stations.
The oscillator is the 'sound source',
like the mouthpiece of  a trumpet. It
makes t h e  basic buzzing whic h is
modiﬁed by the brass tubing and horn
into a colourful and pleasant sound. The
'modiﬁers' in a synth are the ﬁlter and
volume. The ﬁlter is a sort of sophisticated
tone control, which can either cut off the
high or low frequencies of a wave, or a
selection of frequencies in a speciﬁed
wave 'band', like a chunk Out of the
middle. These different types of ﬁlter are
available in  the SID, and are called,
logically enough, the 'high-pass', 'low-
pass' a n d  ' b a n d - p a s s '  ﬁl t e r s .

OK, so that's the basis of synthesis in a
nutshell. But, where can y ou happy
hackers ﬁnd all these control parameters
in the 64's memory? SID resides in the
memory at addresses between 54272 and
54300. Here is a list of the addresses in
memory where y ou can ﬁnd all the
controls mentioned above:
Function
Low note value for Osc 1
High note value for Osc 1
Low pulse rate for Osc 1
High pulse rate for Osc 1
Waveform for Osc 1
Attack/Decay for Osc 1
Sustain/Release for Osc 1
Low note value for Osc 2
High note value for Osc 2
Low pulse rate for Osc 2
High pulse rate for Osc 2
Waveform for Osc 2
Attack/Decay for Osc 2
Sustain/Release for Osc 2
54286 — Low note value for Osc 3
54287 — High note value for Osc 3
54288 — Low pulse rate for Osc 3
54289 — High pulse rate for Osc 3
54290 — Waveform for Osc 3
54291 — Attack/Decay for Osc 3
54292 — Sustain/Release for Osc 3
54293 — High frequency cut-off
54294 — Low frequency cut-off
54295 — Filter ON
54296 — Set Volume and select ﬁlter
type
54297 — Access to output of Osc 3
envelope generator
54298 — Digitised output from Osc 3
54299 — Digitised output from Osc 3
envelope generator
Now you have the addresses of all the
synthesiser functions of the SID chip, you
need to know what values to POKE into
these locations. First up is the ADSR, By
the way, when I say 'high' in these tables it
means long, 'low' meaning short, OK?
Osc Addr es s
ATTACK
High Med
DECAY
Low Lower High M e d
Low L o w e r
SUSTAIN
RELEASE
In order to obtain values in between, you
must combine two or more of the given
values; to get a low attack with a high de-
cay, for example, we would add the re-
quisite values together to read, say, POKE
54277,40; Oscillator 1 = 54277, Low attack =
32, plus high decay = 8; 32+8=40! Simple,
isn't it?
Sustain/Release func tions  t h e
same way. Volume is set from location
54296, and the range goes from 0, softest,
to 15, loudest. Setting the waveform of
any oscillator is achieved by POKEing the
following values, corresponding to their
equivalent waveshapes:
Triangle 1 7
Sawtooth 3 3
Puke

Noise 1 2 9
The High and Low note values are far too
numerous to list here but, to get you
started, here are the values for the middle
(5th) octave:

Let's write a program!
All the parameters mentioned can be
driven from a  simple BASIC program
format, like so:
1 0  R E M  - -  G i v e  p a r a m e t e r s  a  v a r i a b l e  - -
P L = 5 4 2 7 4
3 0  P O K E  V , 1 5 :  R E M  s e t
4 0  P O K E  W , 6 5 :  R E M  s e t
Then a l l  w e  hav e t o  d o ,  us ing
READ/DATA loops, is load the high and
low frequency values and information
about dur ation i n t o  t h e  requis ite
locations, that is to say 54272 and 54273, HF
and [F. This sounds our note:
For durations, all you do is set up a loop to
cycle for the duration of the note, and
READ the value from the DATA:
1 5 0  P O K E  W
All you need then are DATA statements
with your note values and durations, in
that order, starting at line 170. (Duration
125 for a quaver. 250 for a crotchet, 500 for
a minim, and 1000 for a semibreve). I'll
leave the tune up to you!
I've given you all the information you
should need to get going; just get in there

one of  the most difﬁcult t o produce
synthetically. But a synthesiser is capable
of far more sounds, and the SID is no
exception. Also, I challenge any one of
you to link your computer to a piano and
make it sound like Oscar Peterson.
Computers enable the most tone deaf
of us  t o  make beautiful music, and
program the built in synthesiser to make
our games addictive and gripping: I play a
lot of games just to hear a particular sound
effect or tune, and extract a lot of pleasure
in doing so.
In the next part of this series, I shall be
leading you into music programming in a

like 'imitative synthesis', making one
synthesiser imitate another , m o r e
conventional instrument. Also, I'll have a
couple of programs to key in, and a peek
at some pieces of software which can do
some of the work for you.
later in the series, I'll be looking at
machine code interrupts, how music can
be added to games, and delving deeply
into t h e  exciting wor ld o f  speech
synthesis.
That's all folks!

accidently scratching a
ﬁle from disc. With
this utility from Les •
Allen, you can easily
retrieve that lost ﬁle.
OCCASIONALLY, A FILE ON
disc can become inadvertently
scratched due to a mistake or
error on the part of the user. If
the material is 'backed up', the
problem is of no consequence.
If not, the user is left either to
re-enter t h e  pr ogr am o r
retrieve the data from the disc.
Fortunately, it would only be a
single byte in the directory that
was changed during the snatch
process which prevents the
program from being displayed
or loaded.
It is useful to know how the
directory is structured in order
to appreciate the unscratch

whether that sector is occupied
by an existing ﬁle or available
for storage. The ﬁrst T&S of the

Eric Doyle reckons that CBS
Software are deﬁnitely on the
right track with their sequel to
Pitstop.
Pitstop II
CBS
£10.95 (cassette)/f 13.95 (disc)
CBM 64 + joystick
DURING THE GRAND PRIX SEASON I
am an avid viewer o f  the dare-devil
exploits of Lauder and Co. At last I have
found a game which brings some of this
excitement t o  my  computer screen.
Pitstop II is from the Sega catalogue and
forms part of the American assault on the
British software market.
The races take place on one of six
international tracks including our own
Brands Hatch. Each one can be selected
individually or all six can be completed
one after the other in the Grand Circuit
option.
At the beginning of the game the
menu is displayed giving the choice of
number o f  players, track selection,
number of laps and one of three levels of
difﬁculty. When the selection is made
you are ready to start the game and the
screen is split into an upper and lower
picture, with player one always at the top.
Control of the car is by natural joystick
movement, forwards or backwards for
speed change and sideways for steering.
In addition to this, pressing the ﬁre button
whilst accelerating gives the car a 'turbo
boost' which n o t  only  increases the
normal acceleration rate but also allows a
higher speed to be reached.
The screen display shows a 3D view
from just behind each car and a graphic
representation of the -
with a position indicator. Underneath
each screen is a speed indicator, timer and
fuel gauge. As  the race progresses a
watchful eye should be kept on the fuel
gauge and the tyres (irritatingly spelt
'tires' in the American booklet). Tyre wear
is indicated by coloured bars on the top of
each wheel whic h progress through
gradually lighter colours until white
indicates that a blow out and disaster are
only a  whisker away. As  the name
suggests, Pitstops are allowed not only
when changing tyres but also when
refuelling -  a n  option n o  longer
permitted in the real Grand Prix.
As you accelerate away from your
opponent you can afford a quick glance at
their screen where you can see your
vehicle zooming off into the blue yonder
or his car looming up behind you and take
the necessary avoiding action_ During the
race it is impossible to leave the track
R e v i e w
PITSTOP II:
OUR RAVE
R VIEW
except for a pitstop but running along the
broken white lines at the edges of the
road causes tyre wear and loss of speed, as
does the occasional collision with one of
the other cars encountered during the
race.
Pitstops are made by pulling off the
track at the correct place near the starting
grid and then the picture changes to
reveal the two members of your crew
waiting to assist you. Refuelling is simple
to achieve but tyre changes area different
proposition, requiring the manipulation
of the crewman back and forth from the
car to the tyre stacks. If the fuel tank
overﬂows in the meantime, it empties and
must be reﬁlled from scratch.
A leader board is shown at the end of
each race. Victory over your opponent
does not always mean maximum points
because the computer keeps tracks ot
several other  competitors and y our
performance has to be near perfect to
beat them all. To ﬁnd out who these
mystery drivers are you'll have to buy the
game - my lips are sealed.
Graphically, this game is excellent: the
response of the car is immediate and takes
into account the centrifugal forces whilst
cornering. I  did notice the occasional
glitch during the course of a race but
these were only quick ﬂickers which did
not interrupt the enjoyment. Playing
against t he computer is  only  t o  b e
recommended at the lowest level because
of the computer's highly efﬁcient pit
crew. In any case it's far more fun to
defeat a human opponent in a battle of
speed and efﬁciency. I've not had such an
exhausting sit down for years.

Not even the book pages
have escaped our May time
obsession with music. Evelyn
Mills assesses two new books
covering music on the 64
while Garry Marshall takes a
more general look at this
machine.
Title: Commodore 64 Music
Author: I a n  Waugh
Publishers: Sunshine Books
Price: £6.95
WHATEVER YO U  WISH T O  KN O W
about t h e  musical power  o f  y our
Commodore 64, it will certainly be found
in this book. The author has unlocked the
full potential of the SID chip for you to
explore in an inventive and interesting
manner.
The format is well designed and there
is no difﬁculty in interpreting the data.
While there appears to be an excess of
REM statements I  suspect this  is
intentional -  by  the time y ou have
programmed a few chapters you really
know what you are doing. May I remind
you NOT to omit lines with a colon only;
as the author points out these are essential
to delete unwanted lines  b u t  this
information is on the last page and may
escape your attention.
The book opens with two chapters on
the deﬁnition of sound and music. 'What
is Music' may defeat the non-musician
but the text is well deﬁned for those who
wish t o  u n d e r s t a n d  m u s c i c a l
construction. Thereafter the book  is
designed to take you through a step by
step programming technique, starting
with a discussion of the SID chip and a
follow through to programming based on
this discussion. All capabilities of the
Commodore 64 are well demonstrated
and each program is constructed in a
manner ﬂexible enough for the reader to
experiment freely with waveforms, pitch,
envelope generator and time loops.
There is a program to convert your
Commodore i n t o  a  monophonic
keyboard but the author has extended
this to programming in three voices; this
is so designed that you may enter your
musical compositions or interpretations
in scale notation (C, D, E, F, G # ,etc.) with
octave and time values; rests are also
incorporated. This  is  a  v er y  good
development of BASIC, and musical data
can be saved to tape or disc for replay.
Good sample programs are provided.

A most interesting chapter is devoted
to 'c omputer  compositions' whic h
compares random selection of notes with
a program controlled output.
If you want 'instant music' turn to
'Musical Miscellanea' or 'Zaps and Zings
and other  Things'; y ou w ill not b e
disappointed.
Altogether this is a most instructive
and entertaining book. While the text
may appear laborious, there is a wealth of
information a n d  a l l  programs ar e
discussed in detail.
The program which I explored (some
80%) were fully functional and the sound
generated mostly excellent. Considerable
care should be taken when typing in the
more complex data.
This is a highly commendable book
and excellent value for the price.
Title: Electronic Music on
the Commodore 64
Author: M a r k  Jenkins
Publisher: Sunshine Books
Price: £6.95
THE MAJOR PART OF THIS BOOK IS
concerned with a review of the musk
software, pr ogr amming aids  a n d
hardware available for the Commodore
64 so if you are an ardent programmer you
will only ﬁnd around 20% of the book
available for entering. This is made quite
clear by the author in his introduction.
There is an extensive introduction on
sound and the SID chip. While this is
generally dealt with in most books on
Commodore music, and is well known to
most people, the author explores it in
rather more detail.
The sections o n  'Music Programs'
provide a variety of 'demos' on volume,
waveshapes a n d  s o  for th w it h  a n
interesting little insert on how to link your
joystick to playing from a series of eight
notes. Various suggestions are made
throughout this section on how to extend
your programs but, unless y ou ar e
experienced in this art, you can merely
speculate.
Summaries of the programs are well
detailed; 'Mus ic  Player' is  the most
interesting but could be improved with a
more e x p lic it  s c r een dis play . A
monophonic keyboard listing is  also
given.
The review of commercial software
and hardware is concise and well detailed.
Sound processing is very extensively
discussed so for those whose interest lies
in converting the Commodore into a
synthesiser full details are given o n
interface devices available on the market.
Title: Building with Logo on the
Commodore 64
Author: Boris  Allen
Publisher: Sunshine Books
Price: £6.95
THIS BOOK IS AIMED AT A NARROWER
segment of 64 users than the previous
book as it assumes that its readers have
not only a 64 but also the dreaded disc
drive and Commodore 64 Logo, I warmed
to the book and its author as soon as I read
the dedication, which is: "This book is
dedicated to my VIC 1540 disc drive, may
it rot in hell," Perhaps you need to have
written a book yourself to savour the
peculiar pleasure that thinking up an
appropriate dedication can give!
The ﬁrst part of the book introduces

LIBRARY
Logo generally and the niceties of 64 logo
in particular. The second part develops a
range o f  ingenious and interesting
applications.
Logo is the language that is supposed
to turn the computer into an educational
machine from which we can learn by
programming it rather than by having it
program us, as is the case with so much
computer-assisted educ ation. T he
language is  widely  used i n  schools,
although that is not to say that children
are the only ones who can beneﬁt from it.
Its most widely known feature is the
turtle. In addition to this, 64 Logo can
maintain sprites. This enhances its value
enormously: whereas with one sprite (the
turtle) t h e  ideas  a n d  concepts o f
geometry c an b e  explored, multiple
sprites allow all sorts of interactions to be
investigated.
Against this, 64 Logo has the deﬁnite
drawback that the horizontal and vertical
scales on its screen are different. This
means that the turtle moves further down
when it takes one step sideways across the
screen than when it takes one step up the
screen. Worse, it also means that a path
that should be a square appears as an
oblong while circles become ellipses. This
can b e  c orrec ted b y  mak ing a n
appropriate modiﬁcation t o  Logo's
procedures. Allan shows how to do this
although i t  destroys t h e  essential
simplicity that many of the procedures
should have.
The introduction to Logo is sound, if
similar t o  a  number o f  others. The
examples in the second part are well
judged and should draw the reader a long
way into Logo. The many illustrations,
which are screen dumps of the results
produced by Logo procedures, consider-
ably enhance the value and the usefulness
of the book.
Title: Get t ing t h e  mos t
from your Commodore 64
Author: Simon Potter
Publisher: Penguin Books
Price: £5.95
THE COMMODORE 64 HAS ATTRACTED
a large number of books, and with good
reason -  it has a pretty dire manual. As a
computer i t  is  b o t h  c omplex  a n d
idiosyncratic. It can perform well in all the
areas that a  personal computer is
expected to, but it is often difﬁcult to
make it to do so and the secrets of how to
make it perform well are relatively well
kept.
All this makes the 64 one of God's gifts
to authors of computer books. They can
write books for large numbers of  64
owners o n  anything fr om a  simple
introduction to many of the complexities
of the 64.
When the author of a book that is
essentially a replacement for the manual
has written computer manuals, t h e
possible consequences are interesting.
There are such things as decent manuals,
although this may seem hard to believe if
you are only familiar with Commodore
computers!
This book is intended as a manual re-
placement. It starts very well indeed. The
machine is introduced in a section that is
comprehensive, accurately geared to the
needs of the absolute beginner and never
condescending in  any way. I t  covers
setting up the machine for the ﬁrst time, a
beginner's introduction to BASIC, a tour
of the keyboard and using the cassette
player. The section on the keyboard is
particularly good. After reading it even
the total novice will have no trouble in
getting any colou
those graphics characters will be instantly
available, inc luding t h e  ones  t h a t
Commodore don't tell you about. The
function keys in programs are explained
that seem to trouble newccomers, such as
RESTORE, are all dealt with simply and
clearly. T h is  s ec tion i s  a  gr eat
improvement on anything in that spiral-
bound t hing that comes w it h  t h e
computer!
The second section deals with BASIC
programming. The pace is a little fast for
beginners. But, the section is good in that
there are plenty of programs although the
explanations of how they work are not
clear and detailed enough. Also, the point
of a program is often unclear -sometimes
because there is no point in its inclusion
other than to introduce some feature of
BASIC. Consequently, although t h e
features o f  BASIC ar e themselves
introduced, the reason for their existence
is not made clear at all.
PEEK a n d  POKE, and us ing t h e
function keys in programs are explained
quite w e ll b u t  again, ther e i s  n o
explanation of what they might really be
used for.
Next, there is a section on colour,
graphics and sound -  the 64's strong
points. There is nothing wrong with this
section, but I thought that it fell pretty
solidly between what a beginner would
need ta slow and steady approach is
necessary t o  a l l  that POKEing and
PEEKing) and what a fairly experienced 64
owner would want (there are many more
complete a n d  detailed treatments
available).
The next section on peripherals is
quite good. It concentrates mainly on
Commodore's printers and disc drives.
There is a good deal of common sense and
sound advice here. I can endorse much of
what is said, having used a 1515 printer
and 1541 disc drive myself for some time. I
think events have overtaken the book's
coverage of the 1515 printer. It has been a
while since I could get paper for it (it takes
a non-standard size), and I don't think
that you can easily replace the ribbon
either.
The ﬁnal section of the book is a
useful collection of BASIC key words,
functions, memory maps and codes.
All in  all, the book is  a middling
example o f  its kind falling, as I have
already suggested, between the needs of
the b e g in n e r  a n d  t hos e o f  t h e
experienced user. It contains four pages
of colour pictures which, as far as I can
see, have nothing at all t o  do with
anything written in the book, although
they cannot have helped to keep its price
down. These are screen shots fr om
application programs such as a  word
processor, a spreadsheet and a graphics
program. I f  the book had included a
section on the availability and uses of such
programs, it might have told us rather
more about how to get the most from the
64.

Phil South wrecks yet another
joystick as he wades through
games.
The 'best of all time' award goes to the
arcade/adventure, The Staff of Karnath
(Ultimate). The sound effects are pretty
zippy, too. No hi-scores here - it's too
tough!
Ny favourite Manic Miner clone of
the moment is  Hard H a t Mack
(Ariolasoft), a tough little platform game
set on a  building site. I t  is pretty
challenging with lovely sound and the
proud owner of my lowest hi-score this
month. 950!
One-on-One (also by Ariolasoft) is a
superb basketball game which I found the
most addictive out of this month's crop. I
advise you to keep your back to the
opposing player and move fast.
Raid on Bungleing Bay (Ariolasoft) is a
cracking shoot-'em up game featuring a
heavily armed helijet. You have to destroy
factories to prevent the ultimate war
machine from being built. It also features
effective plan view scrolling graphics.
My favourite this month is the totally
amazing Cad Cam Warrior (Taskset).
This is a new twist on the usual arcade
shooting matches with excellent
synthesised sounds and a delightful 3D
double-sided playing area. This is now the
game I reach for instead of Ghostbusters!
Incidentally, my new account number
for Ghosibusters is NAME <cr>acc. no.
05426101. This gives you about $72,600! ! I ).
In the bin
Havoc (Dynavision) is a Zaxxon clone. The
graphics and sound are good but you
have little or no control over your aircraft.
I got bored with it after only an hour.
Olympic Skier (Mr. Chip) is a rather
elementary skiing game. Since no clear
instructions are given on which way to
turn the joystick, it's near impossible to
attain high scores.
Suicide Express (Gremlin Graphics) is a
fast train ride on an alien planet. Two
screens are all the rage at the moment but,
when will these guys realise that most
people can only look at one screen at a
time? The graphics on this game are really
good but, because you spend most of
your time looking at the map at the
bottom, you miss them. The speech
synthesis isn't very good: Speak'n'Spell
could talk rings around this one( The
other noises are much better. My hi-score
was 9040.
Golden Oldies
Metagalactic Llamas Battle at the Edge of
Time and Revenge of the Mutant Camels
(Llamasoft) are great fun. All of the Hairy
One's (Jeff Minter, that is!) software is
good since Jeff strives to produce taxing
but satisfying games of a high standard.
My hi-scores are Revenge - 200,890 and
Battle -  50,245. But these shouldn't be
hard to beat -  Jeff Minter's score for
Revenge of the Mutant Camels was a
mindmelting 900,000 odd! Stand by your
beasts!
Tip of the month
Indiana Jones and the Lost Kingdom (US
Gold) is a real brain bender. Clues: 1st
screen - transfer the lights; 2nd screen -
combination lock; 3rd screen -  like
Mastermind; 4th screen - who knows?1;
5th screen - kill the creature and dig; 6th
screen teleport and climb. This is a really
ﬁrst class game. My hi-score was 10,600.

The sounds of real music
Save come to your computer.
Tom Nash has composed i t
IL
some notes.

IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN GHOSTBUSTERS
yet, then it's about time you took a look -
or rather a listen. I'm no great fan of the , 4 1 1 0 1
game, It smacks too much of real work - w h ic h  you must decide when- nuclear
travelling around town as a  sort o f  weapons  are your only alternative to an
supernatural Rentokil man rounding up endless diet of vodka and caviar (Pass the
slimy sprites instead of rats and other b o t t le  -  Ed.). Gary Mays of PSS told me
rodents. But the music is magic. Even if t h e y  chose the music to underline the
you've had it up to here with Ray Parker—point that there can be no winners in a
Jules original disco mix and you bust a nuc lear  holocaust, It just worries me that
'blood vessel every time they re-run the t h e  constant drone of John Lennon's
promo video, you'll still n e v e r

'Ghost busters' ring out from your 64.
-• , Sound has _started
, A n d ,  more often, the sound that sells a
,
game is the same one that sells recent
, records. Ghostbusters w ould b e  a n
unimpressive game without the backing
. track. And its impact would be reduced
, e v e n  further without the chart hype of a
, c u r r e n t  hit single.
. G h o s t b u s t e r s  wasn't the ﬁrst, but it
is the best example to date, Remember
Mastertronic's C hiller  -  ev en les s
memorable ghosts, though they were cut-
rate ones, backed by  an even bigger
chart-topper. O r  rather it  was, until
Michael Jackson decided to collect his
cut by pointing out (not personally, of
course, but through channels) the minor
problem of copyright.
So, if you've seen the ﬁlm, listened to
the record, watched the video, worn the
t-shirt, eaten the punk food (slimeburgers
a speciality), then you'll be queueing up
to play the game. Or at least that's what
the marketing boys are banking on. And
to a certain extent they're right. I'm not
drop-out dirge w ill have m e  either
pushing the button or pulling the plug on
the game.
As well as providing the backing for
games, t h e  music business has also
offered itself as a theme for some new
software. There was Virgin's The Biz,
which wasn't, Taskset's Jammin', which
was and, o f  course, hankie goes t o
Hollywood, which isn't yet. Look out for
more games about, and by. pop stars as
more of them look for things to do with
their hands now that sound sampling in
the studio has taken away the need for
musical prowess.
Not everyone is adapting existing dit-
ties or cashing in on chart success. Some
software houses ar e employing, o r
commissioning, talented musicians t o
write new music especially for games.
Beam Software, the Aussie writing arm of
Melbourne House, has a couple of people
working solely on software soundtracks as
part of their games designing team. And
they're not bad for Aussies, considering
the country has so far produced only one
musician of note, Rolf Harris, and he
ought to stick with his didgeredoo and
going to fork out the meagre amounts o f
my inc ome that c ould b e  termed B i m  to see what.' mean, There's a good
disposable on yesterday's fashions. There C huc k  Berry song just in the title.
New Generation Software have gone
not for a Sixties song but a Sixties songster,
Brian Doe. (You know, the Doe bit of
Dave, Dozy, Bonk y, Dick and Bitch, lots of
cracking whips and stuff. Or was it Doe,
Ray, Me Far and So but I thought that was
Julie Andrews which rather cuts out the
whips bit /). He has written the music for
Cliff Hanger and Travels with Trashman.
Not classics of our time perhaps but
certainly improvements on the bleeps
and boosters of earlier computer games.
Copyright
are no ﬂares on me (That's what you think,
bell-bottoms - Ed). With software staying
in the charts for about the same length of
time as singles, it's not surprising that
some bright spark hit on the idea of
combining the two. After all, it's the only
way of giving games air-play on the radio.
Something old...
Cashing i n  o n  c u r r e n t  c h a r t
commercialism isn't the only  way o f
putting a sound-track to software. Others
are approaching the problem differently.
PSS for example, have plumped for the
golden oldie, Give Peace a Chance, for
their new game, Theatre of Europe. The
game is a sort of strategic war-game in
So how does a software house go about
acquiring the rights to a piece of music?
Until recently a lot of them didn't bother.
Just slap it in and hope that nobody who is
anybody notices.
But now, there is Rocksoft which
controls and negotiates the copyright for
music which is to appear on software. It
was Rocksoft which took Mastertronic to
task over the unauthorised use of Thriller
and it is to Rocksoft that PSS went when
they wanted to use Give Peace a Chance.
If you want to add music to your own
games, you don't have to worry about all
this, of course. As long as you're not
selling your software there's nothing to
stop y ou using any music you like.
However, if you do decide that you want
to submit your latest masterpiece to a
software hous e f o r  consideration,
remember that it might be tricky for them
to acquire the music you want. And it
might be tricky for l e l  
o
u
t
 -
so think ahead.
Come on feel the noise
II
Perhaps you should also consider other
ways of giving atmosphere to your games
_ without any  music. Explosions are a
doddle, of course, and old hat but there
are plenty of other ways of bringing your
characters
at Impossible Mission. If you can match
the sound of those footsteps crunching
down the corridors or the scream as our
hero plunges into oblivion, then you
don't need music. Sound effects really
haven't been exploited to the full yet.
Let's have some creaking doors in your
Gothic horrors or thundering hooves in
medieval battles.
Even software music is stuck in a rut -
everyone follows the safe motto, bland is
best. What I want to hear is a good drum
roll just before the swish of the guillotine
chops off my head, It's hard to keep
suspense up or even sleep at bay if there's
only one tune playing and you've been at
the game for the last four hours.
Maybe the real solution has been
supplied by the youngest hippy of them
all, Jeff Minter. Psychedelia is a music
program without a single note of music on
it. You provide the music, he provides the
graphics to go with it and it works as well
for Wagner as for Wham. The plot's not
much cop but the patterns are great. And
it has the one software soundtrack you
can never get bored with -  silence.

Mike Roberts introduces a
new series in which, each
month, you will learn how to
build all those computer
components you've always
wanted but have never been
able to afford.
H a r d w a r e
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE PRICE OF
add-ons f o r your Commodore 6 4
recently? Astronomical aren't they.
Simply connecting a  monitor t o  the
video/audio I/O  socket is a great song
and dance -  the correct lead and plug
combination is simply not available. Yet it
is very easy operation to hook up a 64 to
an industry standard green screen
monitor at around f100 -  the type that
gives excellent reproduction f o r
programming, word processing ( I am
using a Kaga Denshi 14 inch green screen
monitor to write this), and for preventing
arguments over Dallas (whether it be on
BBC or ITV!) whenever you want to use
the 'domestic' TV for anything useful.
Another example is connecting
printers. The Centronics interface is the
standard method of connecting printers
to computers. However, the 64 cannot do
this. Not because of anything that is
particularly difﬁcult (the hardware
interface is built into the machine) but
Commodore failed t o  provide t h e
1 E
software is quite simple to produce and
some of the smaller software companies
have been manufacturing the cables and
software for some time. I have recently
seen a package of software and hardware
selling for 120 in Boots. The component
cost of the cable is very small and the
software can be knocked up over an
evening.
This opens up the wide world of cheap
highly advanced centronics-type printers,
with a much increased speciﬁcation over
the standard Commodore item.
There are many other items like this
that a re  either t o o  expensive f o r
a manufacturing company to 'tool up'
or are so simple to construct, but can be
made by the home user with a reasonable
knowledge of methods and materials.
Things to come
In the following few months I will be
giving full details on how to construct the
simple things, such as printer interfaces
and video leads, working through the
medium d if ﬁcu lt y u n it s l i k e  a
motherboard or a slo-mo module, and
then getting to the more difﬁcult devices
like battery backed u p  RAM/RO M
cartridges or extra 64/128/(256!)K RAM
cards.
All projects w ill have extensive
instructions for build up, designed for the
absolute b eg in n er, f u l l  list s o f
components and where to get them. Most
will be from Tandy, this is for reasons of
FACTS s
availability more than anything. There will
also be a list of alternate suppliers where
you can get the stuff by mail order, which
is a little cheaper (and that is, after all, the
main reason for DIY).
Getting started
There are certain items you need before
you start. Pliers, wire cutters, and a
soldering iron are deﬁnite musts -  you
cannot start without them. The iron
should be very thin with a quarter inch tip,
and be a high wattage. A  multimeter
is also very useful for various tasks
and, as the ultimate luxury (and only
if you have one anyway, or know how to
use one) a n  oscilliscope (preferably
triggering and a storage type). Knowledge
of how to solder is also necessary, but I

critical eyes, this
imonth.
Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom
U.S. Gold
£9.95
CBM 64 * Joystick
INDY IS AFTER AN ARTEFACT -  YOU
don't know what it is or how to get it, but
you do know that it is fabulously valuable.
To get the artefact you must progress
through six chambers, in each of which is
a puzzle.
At ﬁrst you are in a rocky seascape,
which, surprisingly, has lifts between
rocks. At each side of the screen is what
appears to be a set of trafﬁc lights. You are
under attack from some creatures which
look like Pterodactyls - at least, they are
like all the ones I have ever seen. Do not
despair, though, there is a way to turn
them into butterﬂies!
Each of the other rooms possesses its
own puzzle and, in each room, the joy-
stick is used in a different way. You are
given no guidance in this - it all adds to
the challenge. You do know that there are
dangers in each room, so you are likely to
need all seven of the lives you are given.
There are three difﬁculty levels, and on
E
 the higher levels everything happens
much faster.
This is a very good and compulsive
game. The sound is excellent and the
graphics good, though rather fuzzy.
Highly recommended. P . R . B .
Murder By The Dozen
CBS Software
£17.95
CBM 64 (Disci
MURDER BY THE DOZEN FROM CBS
Software is an interactive game for 1 to 4
players. There are twelve murders to be
solved, one at a time. If any of you have
ever played the excellent Witness then
you're half way there, only this is better!.
By using your powers of deduction and
collecting clues you have to decide 'who
did it' and why. Included in the rule book
are the twelve case histories, which
should be read very carefully, and a pad of
worksheets for you to record your notes
and suspects etc. This worksheet also
shows you a map of the town with all
relevant places marked. You also need a
book of clues and the solutions which
can't be read simply (clever, these Yanks).
On booting up the disc, you're asked
to input your name. The computer will
accept anything up to Sherlock Holmes in
length; being a ham I played as Marlow.
You then decide the order in which you
wish to tackle the cases. As all the murders
are equally tough I plumped for No 1. The
1541 whirls into life and the chosen
scenario is loaded into memory.
Everything is  governed by  a main
menu. You can either talk to someone,
examine something or move to a different
location or, if you like, all three. But, as
your ﬁnal rating depends on how fast you
ﬁnish the game, its wise to choose your
options carefully.
As this game can be played by more
than one player, CBS has devised a way of
making your suspects' answers relate only
to the person currently in play. Thus,
you k e e p  t h e  infor mation y ou'v e
gathered secret from your opponents. On
interrogating someone, their answers are
shown o n  the screen as a  series of
numbers which relate to clues contained
in the clue booklet. All you do is look up
the relevant number and, hey presto, you
have your information.
Once y o u  hav e exhausted y our
enquiries, and have discovered the guilty
party, you can then reveal all by reading
the solution book and making sure your
worksheet tallies in  all respects. You
ﬁnally declare your outstanding success
to the computer, only to be told, as in my
case, that you rate 'Befuddled Detective!
This kind of program doesn't fall into
any pre-deﬁned slot; neither true arcade
adventure, text or otherwise. I suppose
it's intended for those who prefer to think
their way out of a situation rather than
blast it. I recommend it as a game just a
little out of the ordinary. M . T . U .

pretty near the mark.

Written by Tony Crowther, the author of
Loco, it is really just a rehash of Loco. The
train has turned into a car, which is
speeding along a  road system. From

a picture of the action, in superb graphics.
The car runs along its track. periodically

frequent attack from passing helicopters,
tanks, guided missiles a n d  UFOs.
Ammunition is scooped up from the road,
but if  you collect too much you will

bird's eye view.
You have three cars, and there are
nine difﬁculty levels. At the end of each
game a  voice tells y ou y our  score,
sounding like an American Dalek with
laryngitis. This is enhanced if you have the

comprehensible without it. The hi-score

gates is no easy task but joystick control

IriStall and Isolde

FROM THE TITLE IT MAY BE DEDUCED
that Tristan and Isolde is a German import.
The cassette is accompanied by  good
looking instructions in scroll-like form in
keeping with the game and, after a fast
turboload, the screen offers a demo
option.
The game itself is a graphic adventure
but it seems to operate at the speed of a
slow text type adventure. Naturally, I
would not think of breaking into the
code, but parts of the game, notably the
block graphic characters, hinted at a basic
program. Not a lot happens on screen
until one or two key-press instructions are
given from the options menu which is
continuously displayed. Also shown is
your current location with exits in 3-D
type format, any artefacts such as food or
weapons which can be collected and a
window showing ground level exits from
your current location.
Tristan, t h e  her o, is  guided b y

for the ﬁrst few plays. But be patient as,

equipment, His object, as you may have
guessed, is to rescue his beloved Isolde
who has been imprisoned in a castle by
the evil Wumper, a monster who appears
from time to time.
True adventure, graphic or  other-
wise, this game is not. If you need an
object t o  reach another location, the
screen w ill t ell y ou whilst Wumper
appears randomly gobbling y ou u p
without so much as a reincarnation. The
opening illustration of a castle and music
produced courtesy of the 64 harpsichord
promise much but, once in the quest,
adventurers and arcadians alike may be
disappointed. Tristan clonks about slowly
sounding as though he were a clog dancer
and, getting i n  t ow  with Isolde, h e
proceeds at an agonisingly slow pace.
The graphics inc lude some nic e
touches: for example, each character has
a faithful shadow but on the whole the
available memory might have been better
utilised speeding up the action. High
scores can be entered on a ten name roll
of honour but really the only time this is
likely to be ﬁlled would be at a children's
party.
Overall, t h e  game is  quite w ell
produced if a bit ponderous but it is more
of the children's cartoon variety than a
buy for adventure garners.

is to destroy Gir Draxon the supreme

Once this game has loaded, you are
given a short menu of options. You should
choose the mission brieﬁng ﬁrst. This is

displayed in superb 3D perspective vector

IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THE YEAR 2000,
when all the world has been conquered
by aliens except for London, and they're
even after that! Your task is basically very
simple -  to free the known world, by
ﬂying around and killing all the aliens.
Alien spacecraft, as everyone knows,
are very strange things, varying in shape
from oversized frogs to wriggly green
clouds. They cannot shoot at you, but they
spinning in from the distance and then
rotating once in full view. The overall
effect is smooth and very realistic and just
as good in the main game.
Choosing the play option presents you
with another menu of game missions.
These range from training missions right
up to the hardest mission where you have
to ﬁnd and destroy Gir Draxon.
Once you have chosen your mission
you are given further details on what you
have to do and then you are in full control
of the Raven. I  recommend using a
joystick as there are over eight keys to
operate the Raven without mentioning
the other special control features.
The game is very similar to the Atari
game Battlezone. However, this is a well
presented w it h  g o o d  graphics and
engrossing game play. The sound is a little
feeble, but it's worth looking at if you are
a Battlezone fan.

jumping over obstacles. Not to mention
head banging with bombs and throwing
vacuum cleaners all over the place.
This new game from Interceptor takes
you into the world of crime and shows it
does not pay - at least, not all the time.
After pressing space to begin, you are
told you must qualify in the 200 yard dash
to begin your ﬁrst job. There are around
24 jobs in this game. They involve running
from a  comical policeman, collecting
jewels and safes and leaping over or
vacuuming up obstades in your path.
Running involves the now usual joystick
ﬂy kamikaze missions, trying to collide
with your plane. When you shoot an alien
it sometimes drops a fuel pod, which you
can collect and use. If you shoot a fuel pod
it turns miraculously into a crystal, and
each crystal you collect takes you forward
to the next phase of the game.
The graphics are excellent, especially
the skylines of the cities you ﬂy over,
which scroll very smoothly. The sound
effects are adequate, though nothing
special. The game is challenging and the
pace is fast and furious, particularly in the
higher levels. After wave 10 you can no
longer ﬂy low.
The game is similar in essence to
Neoclyps, but much faster. A nice bonus is
a little game called "SSSNAKE", to play
while the main game is loading.

method - waggling it like crazy. rec k on
joystick manufacturers are sponsoring
this type of game!) However, Interceptor
have tried to save us from becoming worn
out by all this strenuous excercise. With
the main jobs there are bombs ﬂoating
above the villain's head, Jumping up and
hitting one of these in the right place gives
our criminal a boost in his adrenalin. Just
push the joystick left and watch him run.
But this is only temporary.
This is a good game with large clear
graphics and worthy of a higher rating.
Unfortunately, it contains a nasty bug.
Usually it occurs around the second job:
you are running along when suddenly
you ﬁnd a blank screen and the 'READY'
message. Hopefully Interceptor will have
this sorted out and then they may have a
VIC winner on their hands. P . R . R .

F-15 STRIKE EAGLE, BY MICROPROSE
simulates t h e  ﬁghting a n d  tactical
capabilities o f  this  awesome ﬁghting
machine. The program makes no attempt
to simulate the 'ﬂying' aspects in as much
as there are no take off and landing stages,
as there are in Fighter Pilot for instance.
The emphasis has  been placed o n
providing the simulation with airborne
radar, cannons, air-to-air missiles, bombs,
decoy ﬂare and electronic jamming
devices. All these, plus your skill and
strategy, are required i f  y ou are t o
succeed in your mission.
My ﬁrst reaction was that the screen
was cluttered and I didn't know what was
happening. You need to remember which
key does what -  quickly. The 36 page
manual explains all of this in great detail
and it is essential information. Any delay
could result in a SAM missile homing in

on the heat o f  your exhaust. Not a
pleasant experience!
However, after much reading and
more practice, t h e  c oc k pit display
became clearer and the program became
far more enjoyable. Roughly half of the
manual is devoted t o the tactical and
weapon systems and the other half to
ﬂying the aircraft. Flying is fairly easy with
the aid of a joystick. This allows one to
concentrate on the main job„ which is to
bomb as many missile sites and airﬁelds as
possible. In between bombing runs you
have to shoot down the odd enemy jet
and protect yourself against the missiles
which will be launched at you. How you
tackle this depends on your strategy. For
instance, you could ﬂy high to reduce the
effectiveness of the SAM missiles or fast
and low under the enemy radar. If your
radar detects an enemy aircraft you have
the choice o f  closing and using the
cannons or ﬁring one of two types of air-
to-air missiles.
There are four skill levels with the
lowest, arcade, keeping a  horizontal
horizon even when the aircraft is in a turn.
There are seven missions to ﬂy with each
getting progressively more difﬁcult. It is
Wrong, it's yet another Manic Miner
derivative. I can't think of anything we
need less, unless it's another Frogger.
After about three minutes of Pavloda
loading, side t w o  eventually loaded,
although side one refused at all attempts.
You are given the option of either seeing
the instructions or playing the game. On
completing each room, a letter is revealed
which will solve a puzzle and allow you to
win another Melbourne House game.
Playing the game is an experience in
'deja-vu'. You control a little man shaped
like an egg, and have to collect jewels
which are hung on the walls of each
screen using platforms and ladders as
required and jumping over the moving
'guardians' as you go. If you touch these
or the platforms in the wrong order
with the scenario of these missions that I
have some misgivings. For instance, they
are located in Libya, Egypt, Vietnam, Syria
and Iraq. The program is intended for
home amusement only (at least I hope it is
otherwise we're in trouble). I would much
prefer the scenarios to be ﬁcticious rather
than real geographical areas. I wonder if
the Soviets have a game called Raid Over
Washington?
That apart, this is an excellent program
with good 3D graphics. Enemy aircraft are
shown as  'wire' shapes, as they are
redrawn to show perspective, so they lose
their impact (sorry!). Sound is well used
for the various engine and weapon noises.
I particularly liked the sound o f  the
electronic jamming device.
F-15 Strike Eagle is  a  very well
documented strategy ﬂight simulator and
should keep you entertained for many
hours. The Novaload program loaded in
just over 4 minutes but this did not seem
so long as one is entertained with the
customary US GOLD screen and stirring
U.S. music. Look out Colonel G. Here I
come!
you're dead.
As w ith other  Melbourne House
games, the screens are nicely drawn,
without being too ﬂash. In fact, some are
quite sparse.
The little man moves well enough and
all screen changes are swift. The music is
cheery but gets annoying after a while.
You start with ﬁve lives and will
probably need them all; it  isn't easy.
You'll also need more devotion to this
type of game than I have to see the last
screen; even for a free game I couldn't be
bothered to go more than ten screens,
there simply isn't the variation to maintain
interest.
If you want a Manic Miner game, get
the original.

COMMODORE'S FIRST OFFERINGS FOR
The C16 are also the oldest.
The ﬁrst game on the tape is Stellar
Wars, a space ﬁghter game o f  inter-
galactic proportions, but don't get too
excited. The screen is quite impressive:
the central view is from the front of the
space ﬁghter and most of the screen is the
standard black dotted with white stars.

of the screen. This gives warning of an

new arcade game to review and
just when I was beginning to
despair.
Barney is the star of this
particular c ir c us  scenario
which is split into four separate
everything he can see.
The game is written in machine code,
and features hi-res pictures, which are
drawn very quickly and sometimes give
you clues, unlike many other adventures.
Another good point is that commands can
be strung together using the '+' symbol,
enabling you to return speedily to an
earlier position. I also like the fact that it is
easy t o  map, following the rules o f
enemy 'ON TARGET' or  of a state of
'ALERT'. The laser temperature meters are
also at the foot of the screen: too much
ﬁring and they overheat and jam, not
funny as you only have 100 seconds of play
per game. In the centre of the screen are
the sights, the idea being to align the
sights on an approaching enemy ﬁghter
and destroy it with your lasers. In practice
this proved difﬁcult as  t h e  smooth
scrolling screen moves very fast even with
a slight touch of the joystick.
The graphics are adequate with only
one type of enemy ﬁghter to destroy,
albeit in  different colours. The sound
from my TV was very harsh and needed to
be turned down considerably in order to
enjoy the game comfortably. The best
acts. You choose one of the
four game plays, eac h o f
which is  a  variation o n  a
In Act One, Barney takes
on a bit of tight rope walking.
It's a 100 metre excercise and to
get to the other end he has to
avoid a number of obstacles,
the 'drat' factors. Points are
gained f o r  jumping over
chimps, through ﬁre hoops
and grabbing money bags
which turn into golden eggs
as the difﬁculty level increases.
In Act Two you must guide
Barney up and down a series
of platforms avoiding the evil

THIS GAME CLAIMS YOU CAN ENJOY
the thrills, spills and skills o f  BMX
competition racing. There are six events
for you, and up to three friends, to take
part in. These include straight, obstacle
and wheelie races. There are also long and
high jump events. The last event is the
bunny hop.
The game loads very quickly from tape
and you are presented with an event
table. You can then enter all the names. If
you're playing alone, the computer is
your opponent. There are also three ways
of controlling your bike: two types of
joystick control o r  keyboard control,
although t h e  latter method i s  n o t
recommended.
The ﬁrst event is the straight race.
Pressing the space bar starts the race. If
you have played any of the Olympic
games you will be familiar with what
happens next. Yes, it's waggle the joystick
like a looney time! Well, it's either that or
bash your poor old 54's keyboard like
crazy. This madness goes on for up to 60
seconds. You must qualify in under 47
seconds. This is very hard to do and if you
fail you must try again before you can get
on to the next event.
The graphics and sound are good. The
game is not so good. It seems to be aimed
at BMX owners, but I don't think it's any
substitute for the real thing.

PERHAPS THIS ISN'T ST. ANDREWS BUT
at least you can play this golf without
getting wet or up at the crack of dawn; all
you need is a C16 and a lot of patience.
Your ta5k is to complete 18 holes on
the craziest golf course you will ever
encounter. Each hole has its own unique
set o f  obstacles w hic h y o u  mus t
overcome or use to your advantage. Every
hole is given a 'par' rating and you must
endeavour to 'hole out' in par or less.
the main area of the screen shows as
overhead display of the hole in play„
complete with 'block graphic' obstacles.
Playing the game is easier than it looks
at ﬁrst sight. Down the right hand side of
the screen is the 'power of shot' meter;
the longer you make the yellow bar the
harder you will strike the ball. Above this
is the direction indicator; you may hit the
ball in the direction of any one of the
eight compass points. To play, just choose
the direction and power and then hit the
ball, easy!
Crazy Golf's biggest advantage is
playability. After only a little practice,
I progressed quite quickly.
But it loses points on the limited use of
sound, the absence of a two player option
and the fact that 'IS holes get boring after a
while; nine holes with better graphics
would have been an improvement.
Harbour Attack
Commodore
£599
C16 + joystick
HARBOUR ATTACK IS AN EXCEPTION-
ally annoying game, since I  couldn't
progress beyond screen one of a three
screen game. This might b e  due t o
my ineptitude at the game (although four
of us have tried) but it is more likely that
the margin of error has been ﬁxed slightly
too low. Whatever the reason I know I
have no wish to try this game again.
The plot sounds exciting; captain a
submarine through dangerous waters,
run t he gauntlet o f  mines and anti-
submarine aircraft, av oid nets  and
eventually win your way through to the
enemy harbour where you can torpedo
and sink the cargo. If it sounds good,
don't be fooled.
Once powered up, the initial screen is
very disappointing: a  poorly depicted
submarine controlled by the joystick with
several rows of mines going up and down
at a set pace. Between these mines are the
submarine nets with holes just large
enough for your sub to pass through.
Your task is to avoid the drifting mines
and pass through t h e  nets without
touching anything on the way: simply in
theory, t o o  difﬁcult i n  practice.
According to the instructions, in the
second stage you are under attack from
ships, which try to depth charge you, and
aircraft, which bomb you from above.
In the ﬁnal part, you ﬁre torpedoes at
the cargo ship in the harbour, in similar
fashion to those torpedo games seen in all
good arcades.
This game was a poor attempt at a nice
scenario; both the sound and graphics
were well below the capabilities of the
C16. I  should wait for  better games
than this to come along.

House is still Crazy Kong or Super Kong or
any other Kong by another name. Just in
case someone somewhere hasn't seen a
Kong game, I'll explain.
At the top of the screen is a large angry
gorilla; he's Kong. He has kidnapped your
girlfriend and is holding her hostage at
the top of a high building. You have to
rescue her by climbing a series of ladders
and platforms until you reach the girl.
Kong meanwhile is trying to hurl barrels
and ﬁreballs at you which you must avoid
or jump over. Because every game has to
have a score, you pick ﬂowers on your
way to the top. and smash little monsters.
'SPINK5', to bits with an axe.
Once you reach your girl in the ﬁrst
screen, guess what happens? Yes, you do
it all over again on screen two, only this
time the ladders have been replaced with
lifts.
As an early offering for the C16 it's
quite a good effort; the sound is a little
limited and rough in places, but the
graphics are good, with a  very nice
animated gorilla. The game is addictive:
the ﬁrst screen is quite easy but the game
gets harder and harder.
The little ﬁgure seemed a bit slow to
respond to the joystick, but then that
might just bean excuse for my poor score.
You could buy worse than this good and
faithful reproduction of Kong.

PSYTRON HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR
the Spectrum for some time and now
Beyond have seen sense. The 64 version of
this space-base defence simulation,
naturally, ought to be superior.
The Psytron is a computer guarding
the human colony o n  the Betula 5
installation and the player takes on the
role of the defence computer marshalling
ground and air defences and delegating
the human resources to carry out repair
work on the various parts of the base. The
graphics are good and a  beautifully
detailed scrolling view of the base can be
achieved through 360 degrees.
A sixteen page manual will give some
indication of the size of this game with full
instructions and hints for each of the ﬁve
levels. There is a sixth level, the Final level,
but this can safely be ignored for the ﬁrst
few months play. Each level is accessed
from a menu but it is as well to start at
level one as other features of Psytron's
defences are added as levels progress so
that various skills can b e  built u p
gradually. T h e screen is ﬁlled with
information o n  t h e  b ase status
throughout the game, alien spacecraft,
gunsights and a view of the base occupy-
ing the top half of the VDU. In the lower
half there are damage reports, missile
status, resources reports, tw o radar
functions and a neat window used for
chasing and zapping any aliens who may
have landed.
The game has too many features to
cover in a  short review -  it's action
packed, it's strategic and it's difﬁcult. High
scores? Forget it, your very own service
record for all levels can be loaded and
saved for a number of tries at each level.
For all of this, the price is a snip.

you tell me, maybe by comparison with

In o n e  o f  y our  replies o n  t h e

devices', including Commodore single
and twin disc versions. Does this meatu
that Commodore make these drives for
use with these interfaces? Also, do the
drives use the same type and size of disc as
the 1541, and will they load typical
software from disc?
Mark R. Jones
Blackpool
Firstly, the main problem with the speed
of the 1541 is the serial interlace between
it a n d  t h e  computer. Secondly,
comparison with drives suitable for other
computers are of little interest as they are
not compatible. Comparisons between
the 1541 and IEEE drives are possible but
the extra cost of these drives put them far
Out of the reach of most users.
Commodore currently make the
8520Ip 2 megabyte twin disc drive retailing
at £895 and the SFD1001 1 megabyte single
disc drive retailing at E495.
These drives and all other IEEE devices
require an IEEE interface if they are to be
used with the Commodore 64. They use
double sided, double denisty discs
whereas the 1541 requires only single
sided, single density discs. The drives will
load any software that has been properly
created. s

Using the basic 1 1 1
information given last
month on using your
computer as a ﬁling
cabinet, A.P. and D.J.
Stephenson now show
you how to build
ﬁling programs
through a collection
of subroutines. 
a
,PART 8
THIS MO N T H  W E  SHALL
cover some general purpose
subroutines which should be
useful to you as building bricks
if you decide to develop your
own programs. A s f ar as
possible, we shall restrict the
discussion to cassette tape ﬁles
because the majority of readers
may not yet have invested in a
1541 disc drive. I t  i s not
expected that you follow the
subroutines strictly t o  t h e
letter. No doubt you will want
to introduce some variations
and, perhaps, extra cosmetic
touches such a s  co lo u r
emphasis for headings etc. Line
numbers have been chosen so
that, i f  yo u  u se all t h e
subroutines, there will be no
clashing. Furthermore, they are
all low enough to allow room
for a short calling program, via
a menu. W e  say, 'short'
because the subroutines will
do most of the donkey work.
The main task left is to provide
the menu display and the ON
GOSUB selection mechanism.
(Refer back to Part 6 of the
series.)
The subroutine have been
introduced in logical, rather
than lin e number, order.
However, it is suggested that
you ﬁnish up with one long
program which can then be
saved o n  tape under o n e
composite name, such a s
'LIBRARY'. To help you in this,
the subroutines should b e
entered in the following order:
Subroutine 8.3 Create ﬁle: 1000
Subroutine 8.8 Load ﬁle: 2000
Subroutine 8,7 Save ﬁle: 3000
Subroutine 8.5 Display ﬁle:
4000
Subroutine 8.4 Add records:
5000
Subroutine 8.6 File name:
10000
Subroutine 8.9 Record search:
14000
Subroutine 8_2 Press any key:
1 5000
Subroutine 8.1 Input validation:
25000
The round-ﬁgure starting
numbers, given at the right,
should be used in the GOSUB
statement rather than the ﬁrst
REM line which is simply the
title. The lines are deliberately
spaced well apart in order to
allow extra subroutines to be
inserted later. T o  use t he
LIBRARY tape as a basis for a
full program:
1. Load LIBRARY tape
2. Keep r e c o r d  o f  t h e
subroutine titles and round-
ﬁgure starting lines.
3. Develop a program, using
the vacant line numbers from
10 to 999, which displays a
menu f o r  c a l l i n g  t h e
subroutines. Include an y
initialisation a n d  p r e -
assignments necessary.
4. Add some colour commands
or other cosmetic aids for
tarting up the ﬁnal project.
Avoid bizarre effects - they can
detract f ro m  rather than
enhance the appearance.

Variable names
IFIA • C Elf% S
In t h e  subroutines t h e
following variable names are
used consistently:
AV(F,R)=element of the two-
dimensional array representing
the main ﬁle data
F S % t
(maximum number of records
allowed in ﬁle)
FL%=current ﬁle size
NS=ﬁle name
NF%=number o f  ﬁelds i n

F=particular ﬁeld number
R=particular record number
S%=selected menu option
number
KS=general purpose variable.

L%=main ﬁle length
Fl%=ﬁle status ﬂag. F1%=1 if ﬁle
already loaded.
55=bottom line of display
Stop line of display
SL%ulciﬁle length
CH%=number o f  characters
allowed in ﬁeld.
LC and IT  are other general
purpose variables
IS is a string of 39 characters for
drawing a line on the screen,
using CHRS(99).
Input routine
Creating and maintaining ﬁles
can be a time consuming task,
most of which will be spent at
the keyboard. In view of this, a
friendly input routine i s
particularly im p o rt an t .
Replying o n  a  bare INPUT
statement is not good enough
because no allowance is made
for human error. Subroutine

A check is made for the null-

RETURN before data) and also
the number  o f  characters
received. Any excess characters
are truncated without warning.
Although the machine allows
255 characters per string, there
will usually be a much lower
restriction in  a  practical ﬁle
due to display limitations. In
fact, y o u  s hould allow  a
maximum o f  1 9  characters
otherwise the ﬁles won't ﬁt in
properly when the ﬁle is later
displayed.

Create new ﬁle
subroutine
When creating a new ﬁle, the
ﬁrst items  o f  information
required from the keyboard
would be:
1. File size. That is  t o  say,
maximum number of records
allowed (FS%)
2. Number of ﬁelds in record.
(NM)
Once these two items have
been obtained, the array can
be dimensioned with:
DIM AVNIF%,FS%)
3. Field headings. These can be
sorted in the 0 record slot of the
array in the form AS(F,0), where
F is the particular ﬁeld number.
Thus, ﬁeld 1 can be stored in
AS(1,0), ﬁeld 2 in A$(2,0) and
ﬁeld n in AS(n,0). This is a neat
and convenient dodge f o r
storing the heading informa-
tion providing, of course, the
ﬁrst record number is deemed
to be Record 1  instead o f
Record O.
The ﬁle will then be ready to
receive records. Subroutine 8,3
is based on the requirements
outlined above
Before each record is entered,
line 5000 checks that t h e
number o f  records has not
exceeded t h e  m a x im u m

example of nesting. Restricting

reasonable to us but line 1060
can easily be adjusted to allow
more ﬁelds. The blank REM
lines s erv e t o  demarcate
submodule boundaries and are
given spooky line numbers so
they can be erased without
fear.
Add records routine
Subroutine 8.4 can be used for
adding records to a ﬁle, once it
has been created.
allowed by the DIM statement
at the time the ﬁle was created.
Records can be added, one
after t h e  ot her  u n t il t h e
operator types EXIT. Note that
the record number is reduced
by 1  after receipt o f  EXIT
because it is not a valid record.
Because the number of records
which will be added at each
section is unknown, the loop
must b e  c o n t r o lle d  b y
incrementing t h e  r ec or d
length (I.%) each time round
instead of using the customary
FOR/NEXT loop.
Display ﬁle subroutine
After entering records into a
ﬁle, it is customary to view the
ﬁle on the screen, either for
interest or to check that the
records have actually gone in.
Displaying a ﬁle on the screen
presents problems. Suppose
we want the ﬁelds t o be
displayed horizontally and the
records vertically. The screen
width is only 40 characters so
only one or two ﬁelds of the
record can b e  displayed at
once. The limit of 25 lines also
imposes a limit on the number
of records whic h c an b e
displayed at one time without
scrolling. T o  overcome t he
horizontal limitation, t h e
following subroutine allows
only two ﬁelds of each record
to be displayed at one time.
The ﬁrst ﬁeld of the record (the
key ﬁeld)  i s  permanently
displayed a t  t he left hand
position. The other ﬁelds can
be rotated into view, one at a
time, to occupy the right hand
position. This is achieved by
using the •L' key to rotate left
and the 'R' key to rotate right.
the display is rotated beyond
the boundaries of the ﬁelds,
wrap-around ac tion occurs.
Only a 'page' of 18 records
come into view at a time, but
other pages can be scrolled

THE SIX PIECES O F  FIELDMASTER
Software to come under my scrutiny were
Worksheet, Home Accounts, Pagewriter,
Posterprint, Record Card and Mail label.
The programs are very long and the tape
version take an age to load. The disc
versions all take around 70 seconds.
r M r
Fieldmaster offer quite a
range of software for the 
•
small business. Dave Crisp put
their six packages to the test.
Before dealing with speciﬁc programs
it may be worth pointing out a few things
that are applicable to all six. The ﬁrst
thing is that they have all been compiled
using the Petspeed Compiler, and this is
fairly obvious from the speed at which
they operate. Searches (where relevant)
are fast, as is response to key-presses,
although not quite fast enough on the
Pagewriter software_
Consistency seems to be an important
consideration w i t h  F ieldmas ter .
Throughout all the programs the method
of use is the same, as illustrated by the
instruction manual. Whole chunks are the
same irrespective of the program. This is
not a criticism. It makes changing from
one program to the other easy, and is
something other software houses could
take a look at.
E
In t h e  programs where information
storage is  an integral part, the database
for example, there are limitations. The

sheer size of the programs prevent large
amounts of data being stored in RAM but,
with careful use of the disc drive, large
amounts o f  data can b e  stored and
retrieved from the disc. This is what
lets the programs down.
The screen presentation is smooth and
professional - everything is clear and easy
to read with plenty of on screen prompts.
Worksheet is a Spreadsheet program. I
cannot even recommend this as a good
spreadsheet for  beginners due to the
scant documentation. But, it does have
the ability to produce a bar graph of
ﬁgures. This may be its saving grace but
look carefully before you buy.
Record card is a database program of the
simplest type. For storing things lik e
names and addresses, record collections
and so on it is more than adequate. Like all
the other Fieldmaster software it is easy to
use and the presentation is superb, but it
falls down on versatility.
It is a basic card index program with
fairly good search facilities, and a small
degreee o f  calculation. Totals can be
obtained from numeric ﬁelds but that is its
extent. Records appear to be stored by
the page, so there seems no advantage to
keeping cards small. According to the
manual the maximum is 100 records. Of
course you can store more than 1 ﬁle on a
disc but with the loading times of the
program and its price it does seem a bit
like taking a nut to crack a sledgehammer!
Pagewriter
Pagewriter is a very basic wordprocessor.
It is easy to use but has its limitations.
It is  advertised as a  full function
wordprocessor b u t  that i s  a  little
optimistic to my mind. The most obvious

omission is wordwrap. With this function
missing I found I had missed many words
and had t o  do constant editing. The
facilities it does have are insert/delete,
centre, l/ r  justify, calculation, reverse
print line, double width print and the
ability to build up a small ﬁle of names and
addresses, etc, in order to label print.
Memowriter would be a better title for
this package because of its limitations but,
if y ou d o  need t o  prepare s hort
documents quickly and simply, this may
be a reasonable buy.
You can use all the Commodore
graphic keys to produce your design and
print it out, if you have a printer which
will support Commodore graphics. This is
an expensive colouring book at £21.95.
Mail Label
Mail label does just what it says. It can be
used as a simple card index or, more
usefully, as a label printer.
It is limited to 200 labels per ﬁle but the
biggest restriction is its inability to cope
with more than 1 label width at a time. The
printout options should certainly be more
versatile.
It is a pity there is no integration
between this and pagewriter as that
would have made it more useable.
Posterprint
Posterprint allows you to design and print
posters up to a maximum size of 4011r21
cms.
Home Accounts
Home accounts was the best offering of
the lot although I was still amazed by its
lack o f  capacity. There are only  18
headings f o r  inc ome a n d  1 8  f o r
expenditure. Once again, its presentation
was good, and it was easy to use. A big
plus was the on-screen calculator -  a
calculator appears while you are doing
your maths.
It provides for full banking routines,
and a comprehensive range of printouts
can b e  obtained. I f  you d o want to
computerise your home accounts then
this may  sufﬁce. But, with only  18
headings it is only suitable for a very small
business
In conclusion
First of all, I  think Fieldmaster should
reconsider their pricing structure: all,
except Home Accounts are overpriced.
Technically, apart fr om t h e  lo w
capacity, they are excellent. A partnership
between Fieldmaster's programmers and
Gemini's designers would, I feel, produce
some ex c ellent software. G emini's
problem is in the programming itself;
everything else is excellent.

COMPOSER 64 ALLOWS YOU
to concentrate on your tune
and to forget about PEEKs and
POKEs and other programming
headaches normally associated
with sound. Your completed
masterpieces can be dumped
straight on to a printer in the
form of numbers, although this
can be done by hand if you
have a hard copy facility in this
system. The ﬁgures can be used
in your own programs but, if
you feel that your BASIC is not
good enough, you can simply
hear your tune played back to
you on Composer 64.
The program constantly checks
the loctions 54272-54296 i n
the memory and displays the
contents on the screen. This
means you can see exactly what
is happening in the SID chip
while you enter your tune.
Composer 64 allows you to
use almost all of the 64's sound
features. For example, you can
build up chords using all three
voices, change the shape of a
note us ing t h e  env elope
c ontrols  a n d  w a v e f o r m
features, and even sychronise
or modulate two voices.
Using Composer 64
When the program is run, a title
page w i l l  appear . W h e n
instructed to, press the space
bar and begin. Figure 1 shows a
breakdown of the screen.
Five boxes display informa-
tion. The top box represents
the keyboard. White notes are
displayed in the bottom half
and black notes in the top half.
In the empty space between
the notes, a white asterisk is
displayed at the left-hand end
and above the 'C'; this is the
note marker. For example, to
play a 'D', the marker must be
moved two positions right so it
will be placed directly above
the 'D' on the keyboard. To do
this, press the cursor left/right
key twice, followed by a space
which plays and remembers
the note. If a 'C  sharp is now
needed, the marker must be
moved to the correct position
by pr es s ing t h e  c u r s o r
up/down key once and then
the space bar. Note: the space
bar must be pressed before
continuing with another note.
Recording
When you understand how to
play the notes and feel ready to
move to the next note on your
tune, press RETURN. The note
number will be increased by
one and is displayed in another
box -  the tune information
box. You can now play more
notes. If you press 'P', the tune
will be played back. Composer
64 allows you to play a tune
consisting of up to 100 notes.
Introducing chords
So f a r ,  y o u  w o u l d  hav e
been u s i n g  v o i c e  o n e .
However, there are two extra
voices which can have different
note values and b e  played
simultaneously with voice one.
To play  a  C  c hor d, t h e
following procedure should be
followed:
1. P r e s s  C T R L  a n d  1
simultaneously to start again.
2. M o v e  the marker to 'C' and
press space then V - voice 1.
3. Mo v e  the marker to 'E' and
press space then V - voice 2.

4. M o v e  the marker to 'G' and
press space then V - voice 3.
Whenever space is pressed, a
'C' chord should be played.
When 'V' is pressed, the voice
number which you are using
increases b y  o n e  a n d  i s

information box. If you want
one voice to be silent for a
note, move the marker to the
extreme right of the keyboard
when you are using the correct
voice.
Special features
These are summarised in Figure
2. First of all, to change the type
of waveform, ie, the shape of
note, press the W key, enter
the voice number and pick one
of four options:
1. Triangle
2. Sawtooth
3. Pulse
4. Nois e
If 3 is selected, you will have to
enter high a n d  l o w  puls e
values. This is done by entering
a number between one and
ﬁfteen then a number between
1 and 255, for example 5 then
94. The other functions are
fairly self-explanatory and are
found in Figure 2.
Extra-special effects can be
created by  using the special
effects panel which comprises
an envelope, ring-modulation
and synchronise controls. The
envelope control determines
the length and peak volume of
a note and is divided into 4
parts as shown in ﬁgure 3. The
ﬁrst half of the note (the Attack
and Decay) i s  altered b y
pressing 'A' - enter a number

between 1 and 255. The second
half is altered by pressing '5' -
enter a number between 1 and
255. If a synchronisation of two
voices is required, press a n d
enter a number according to
ﬁgure four. The same applies to
ring-modulation except y ou
must press "  instead.

This is how to enter a tune.

Mike Hart will present
you with useful 1 1
subroutines from
which you can buig
an invaluable
programming
reference library.
WHEN YOU HAVE STARTED
to master your Commodore
machine, t w o  o f  t he most
frequently asked questions are
these: 'How do I get a message
printed o u t  o n  t he screen
exactly where I want it?' and
'How do I present a column of
ﬁgures?'
In m o r e  s ophis tic ated
BASICs, these two problems
are usually taken care of by a
couple of keywords or rather
key phrases, namely PRINT'
and PRINT USING, respec-
tively, However, the BASIC
present in the VIC and the
Commodor e 6 4  i s  t o o
restricted t o  cater for these
possibilities and, consequently,
we will need to have recourse
to subroutines which simulate
both of these procedures.
PRINT @
Here I  shall show you three
methods of which the ﬁrst is in
BASIC, the third in machine-
code and the second some way
in-between!
Method 1: Listing No, 1
Here the strings H$ and V$ are
deﬁned as  t h e  r equis ite
number of cursor rights and
cursor downs appropriate to
your machine (eg, for a Com-
modore 64,40 cursor rights and
25 cursor downs). I n  t h e
subroutine, t h e  c urs or i s
'HOMEd' and an appropriate
number of cursor rights and
downs printed before printing
the null character followed by a
semi-colon.
After the return from the
E
 subroutine, the string is printed
at the appropriate position on
the screen. I n  eac h case,
counting starts f r o m z er o
rather than f r o m 1  a s  i s
conventional.
6 4  U t i l i t y
RELIABLE
ROUTINES
Method 2: Listing 2
This is almost exactly the same
technique as the previous one
but w e  rely upon a  RO M
technique t o  pos ition t h e
cursor for us. Notice that the
vertical co-ordinate is fed into
location 781, the horizontal
into loc ation 782, 0  in t o
location 783, before the SYS call
is made into ROM. This works
equally well on the VIC-20 or
the Commodore 64.
Method 3: Listing 3
This s hor t mac hine c o d e
routine can be POKEd into a
convenient part o f  memory
(eg, at  300 decimal o r  700
decimal will do). Then to call
the routine, use the following:
SYS (Location) H,V,
where H  is  t h e  horizontal
vector and the V is the vertical
vector, Notice that there is no
comma after the bracket but
there is a semicolon delimiter
after the V. immediately before
you print out your string.
PRINT USING
This r outine w ill correctly
round your columns of ﬁgures
to the required number o f
decimal places and will also
line up the ﬁgures with the
decimal point i n  t h e  right
position. This is not a full-scale
PRINT USING but will serve for
most o f  y our  purposes. I t
makes us e o f  user-deﬁned
functions, the ﬁrst being t o
round your number and the
second being to work Out the
correct number  o f  spaces
before the decimal point for
both positive and negative
numbers.
Listing 4 shows you how the
user-deﬁned functions are set
up. Note that in  line 4020.
RN refers to rounding number
and will be 10 for one place
of decimals, 100 for two and
so on. In line 4040, you may
alter the padding 'value' o f
spaces which is  set initially
to 10,

In the last part of this series,
Allen Webb discusses how to
add that extra special touch
to your adventure with
graphics o f  humour, for
example. 1
UP TO NOW, I HAVE DISCUSSED THE
use of text only. For some inexplicable
reason, graphics are being used more and
more. But, whilst. they can be used to
portray a pretty scene, the careful use of
text can be equally effective. If you must
use graphics, the ﬁrst problem is  t o
choose the system most suited to your
needs/programming ability. It must be
appreciated that graphics ar e R A M
hungry and you will have to make a
c ompromis e b e t w e e n  p r o g r a m
complexity and picture quality.
Picture production
On the 64 there are many ways o f
producing pictures, each presenting
it's own difﬁculties:
i) B i t  mapping can either be used in
multicolour or high resolution mode. To
use this method effectively you would
need to write a set of graphic routines,
preferably in machine code, and devise a
compression system o f  the storage of
picture data. To display text with the
picture you would need to use raster
interrupts or some other method.
ii) With the advent of packages such as
the Koala pad, it is possible to draw high
quality pictures in  multicolour mode.
Such pictures can be loaded one by one,
when required, from disc, Due to it's
sequential nature, the cassette recorder is
not suitable for this approach.
iii) The 64 allows great ﬂexibility with the
creation of redeﬁned characters. Using
one or more character sets on screen (by
virtue o f  raster interrupts), complex
pictures (with animation) can be readily
created.
iv) ﬁnally, sprites can be used to generate
pictures.
For most users, options iii) and iv) are
probably most feasible.
You may have noted that I constantly
refer to the use of raster interrupts. This
powerful facility allows the mixing of
several graphics modes  o n  screen
simultaneously. (See our November issue
SETTING O U T
ON
AN ADVENTURE
for f ur t her  infor mation i n  ras ter
interrupts).
Adding complexity
One way of adding depth to the game is to
introduce other characters. These can
either be active, so you can interact with
them, or passive. It is a fairly simple matter
to introduce a simple form of artiﬁcial
intelligence which will give the feeling of
complexity.
Consider the trivial example in Listing
1. This shows the reactions of a ﬁgure met
in an inn. The variable SF' is a suspicion
factor; the lower it's value, the more
suspiciously the man behaves. The value
of SF' can be altered during the game by
your actions.
Similar concepts can be applied to
bravery, aggression, anger etc. Listing 2
gives a second example. This time you
ﬁnd a group of men in the inn. The
routine gives the effect of listening to
their conversation.
The secret o f  effective routines of
these types is to offer variety without
excessive repetition. The element o f
surprise is an additional element which
can enhance the game. How about being
captured by various foes without warning
and being put in some nasty situation
from which you must escape? Please don't
use instant death, however. Games which
give messages such as "You fell down a
hole and are dead" simply show a lack of
imagination.
Game for a laugh
Why not write a game in which you can't
get killed? Humour is closely related to
artiﬁcial intelligence. T h e  occasional
humourous touch can vastly improve a

P r o  r a m m i n
Humour can be a two edged sword.
On the one hand, it can brighten up a
game and provide real entertainment. If
misused, however, it can become tedious
and very irritating.
Avoid o n e  o f f  jokes, they  soon
become tedious especially if over used
and frequently repeated. A  continuing
joke involves the development of a theme
by use of a series of related incidents. You
could, for example, encounter a whippet
which becomes progressively mor e
aggresive and does progressively nastier
things to you each time you meet it.
Continuing jokes are fun, but difﬁcult to
write well.
The unexpected joke, by virtue of it's
shock value, can be very effective. Let me
give an example. In one of my games,
there is a red button in one location.
Pressing the button gives a simulation of
the 64 resetting and the usual sign on
display complete with ﬂashing cursor is
given. The usual reaction is one of disgust
at the machine crashing, but the routine is
written s o that pressing o f  any key
restores t h e  display w ith a  suitable
comment. This ploy works well only once,
but t he effect is  excellent and fully
justiﬁes it's use.
Data compression
If you've read the ﬁrst two parts of this
series, y o u  w i l l  hav e realised t h e
importance of data storage. Even using
the techniques discussed earlier, data
storage is still RAM hungry. In order to
save space, it may be necessary to use data
compression. Such techniques usually
store the data in an amended form to save
space and are most applicable to text.
Level 9 ,  f o r  ex ample, us es  d a t a
compression extensively to create very
complex games.
There are a variety of methods of
compressing data. The most effective
involve splitting words into frequently
used groups of letters and then storing the
words as codes. With such methods,
reductions in data of 40% to 50% are
possible. Listing 3 gives a program which
will compress data to give a 33% reduction
in size. This  method involves t h e
crunching of 3 letters (usually occupying 3
bytes) into 2 bytes.
First assume that we have only 31
letters, namely the alphabet, ,  and the
common punctuation marks. If you're
prepared to use only upper case in your
adventure, this is sufﬁcient, Next, allocate
a value to each character:
A = 1
Z = 26
= 27
1 =28
= 29
SPACE = 30
Each value will occupy 5 bits. The 15 bits
used by  3  letters can, therefore, b e
converted to 2 bytes. Consider the letters
ABC. The binary representation of their
values are:
Value 
1
 
2
 
3
Binary 00000001 00000010 00000011
By loosing the left hand three bits of each
binary number and crunching them
together, the encoded bytes become:
00001000 10000110 ﬁe 8 and 134)
Listing 3 gives a simple compression and
decoding routine using this approach.
The section between lines 1 and 200
compresses a string, SS (see line S), and
stores it in RAM starting at address ME.
Because the string ends in @ it will end in
a zero byte, thus enabling the decoding
routine to stop at the end of the string.
Since characters ar e compressed i n
groups o f  thr ee, t h e  process i s
complicated slightly. Lines 10 and 20 pad
out the string with extra @ characters
until the string's length is divisible by 3.
The subroutines starting at 60000 and
61000 c onv er t a  character t o  it's
appropriate value and vice versa. In both
cases, the character is kept in CS and its
value i n  C .  T he compression a n d
expansion of characters are performed in
the subroutines a t  50000 and 51000.
Although the operations in these routines
appear a little involved, they are really
quite trivial and can be readily converted
to machine code.
The routine starting at line 2000 will
decode and print text stored at address
ME until the terminating zero byte is
found,
Using this routine is quite simple:
i) Encode the text using the ﬁrst routine.
The routine will give you details of the
start and ﬁnish address. Keep a note of
each start address! Always ensure that you
terminate each with@.
ii) Save y our  encoded tex t using a
machine code routine is quite trivial.
compressed text can be LOADed at run
time to save program space.
iii) Build the start addresses into your
program by using data statements.
An example of storage of addresses is:
4 1
10 DATA L I
20 DATA H1,H2,H3,H4,H5
30 FOR 1  x  1  TO 5
40 READ L,H
50 NE111 •  H425641.
60 NEXT I
70 mg M E 1 3 1 :  GOSH 2100
a
etc. etc...
Since the start addresses will be larger
than 256, two byte representation is used.
Line 70 gives an example call assuming
that you type the decoding section in with
the same line numbers as Listing 3, This
line will print the message starting at
ME(3).
If you test Listing 3, you will ﬁnd the
decoding routine a little slow. Whilst the
speed sufﬁces for most adventures, a
machine code routine would obviously
be m o r e  ac c eptable. Sin c e  t h e
compression process essentially involves
simple shifts and rolls, the corresponding
machine code routine is quite trivial
Much of what I've discussed involves
the storage of data in some area of RAM.
For those of you with a machine code
monitor, the manipulation of such data is
quite simple. For those of you without
this I ' v e  inc luded Lis ting 4 .  T his
simple routine will save any block of RAM
between $0000 and SUFF. The routine

Carry Marshall guides you"!
step by step, through this
month's project - to write a
menu-driven interactive
graphics system.
THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD INTER-
active graphics packages offer a menu of
shapes from which the user can pick one
and then 'drag' a copy of it into position
anywhere on the display screen before
releasing it to 'ﬁx' it there. A picture can
then be constructed by  placing all its
component parts in the correct positions,
relative to each other. The success of a
package in a particular application will
depend, in part. on the repertoire of
shapes that it provides.
Graphics systems o f  this k ind are
available on many types of computer,
including the largest ones. But, their ease
of use does not mean that it is easy to write
software for them. While it is one thing to
write a program that works as long as you
know what it expects of you, it is quite
another matter to write a program for the
naive user where no such assumptions
can be made.
Setting the scene
We shall develop our interactive graphics
program by using sprites -  each of the
shapes that can be chosen will be deﬁned
as a sprite. Because the 64 provides only a
limited number of sprites, our menu will
offer a choice of only two shapes, which
will b e  sufﬁcient t o  illustrate t h e
principles involved in the creation of the
system (you can increase the number if
you want to). It is, therefore, important to
select carefully the shapes which the
program offers.
The program will be developed by ﬁrst
deﬁning t h e  t w o  shapes and, then.
positioning them on the screen as shown
in Figure 1. They are positioned at the left
of t h e  screen w it h  a  vertical lin e
separating them from the rest of the
screen whic h naturally provides t he
display area, or 'canvas', on which we shall
create o u r  pictures. Each shape is
E
 numbered, and t h e  instructions f o r
'picking' the shape (enter its number) are
also displayed on the screen.
With this preparation, the program
then allows the user repeatedly to pick
one of the shapes and to drag it to the
required position on the screen before
PROGRAMMING
PROJECTS
How it's done
releasing it, The form for this part of
the program is:
REPEAT
PICK SHAPE
DRAG AND RELEASE SHAPE
END REPEAT
The program w ill implement these
operations as follows. When one of the
shapes is picked, a new sprite will be
created, which will have the same shape
as the one that was picked and will be
positioned directly under it. Then the new
sprite can be dragged from its initial
position to any desired position on the
display area by pressing the appropriate
keys. We shall use R,I., U and Das the keys
for moving it a small distance to the right,
the left, u p  and down, respectively.
Finally, when the required position has
been reached, the sprite can be ﬁxed in
that position by pressing another key, in
this case the F key.
First steps
The initial screen can be set up, except for
the shapes, by:
The graphics character in line 110 is that
obtained by pressing CBM and H, and the
one in line 120 by pressing CBM and Y.
Sprite creation
The next task is to position the sprites on
the initial screen. To do this we must delve
into the mechanics of designing, enabling
and displaying sprites.
A sprite consists o f  21 rows each
containing 24 dots. Any of the dots can be
coloured (to make a visible part of the
sprite) or not coloured (to either form a
hole in  the sprite through which the
background can be seen or help to deﬁne
the shape of the sprite). Figure 2 shows the
hash-shaped sprites (composed of two
rows and two columns of coloured dots)
that has been chosen as one of the shapes
for Our program.
Once a sprite has been designed. we
have t o  describe that design t o  the
computer. This is done by ﬁrst using a 1 to
represent a coloured dot and a 0  to
represent a non-coloured dot This gives
21 rows each of 24 binary numbers. If we
take one of these rows, we can treat it as
three 8-bit numbers, each of which can be
converted to a decimal number. Thus, we
get a set of numbers with which to tell the
computer the shape of our sprite. There
will be 63 numbers in all. For our 'hash'
sprite, the numbers for most of the rows
are 1, 1 and 0, but for the two rows where
all the dots are coloured in the numbers
are 255. 255 and 255.

180 NEXT K
190 PRINT "PRESS R; L; U; OR D TO DRAG IT"
200 PRINT "PRESS F TO FIX IT"
Having designed a sprite, we have to
know which locations the M  uses to
create and control it. Eight sprites can be

handled, and they are numbered from 0
to 7. Our program will make use of the
following locations each of which has the
special pur pos e described i n  t h e
following table. In the table, the variable
N can assume any sprite number from 0 to
7.
Using the sprites
The next part of the program begins by
placing the description o f  the sprite
illustrated in Figure 2 in the block of
memory starting at location 832. It then
places a second description, this time of a
sprite with just one vertical line and one
horizontal line, in the block starting at
location 896. Line 300 assigns the ﬁrst
description to sprite number 0, and the
second t o  sprite number 1. Line 310
enables sprite number 0  and sprite
number 1. Line 320 gives the colour with
code 7 (yellow) to both sprites. Line 330
gives a column and row, and so a position
on the screen, for sprite 0, and line 340
does the same for sprite 1.
Once these two lines are obeyed, the
sprites providing the shapes for  our
program appear in their initial positions as
shown in Figure 1. Finally, line 350 stores,
under the name S. the number of the next
sprite which is to be created when we start
picking shapes and dragging them onto
the display area with the next part of the
program. We have now created sprites 0
and 1, so the next sprite will be number 2.
The program segment is:
With the preliminaries completed, the
remainder o f  t h e  pr ogr am m u s t
repeatedly pick one of the shapes and
drag it onto the screen before ﬁxing it
there. Writing one subroutine for picking
a shape (which starts at line 1000) and a

(starting at line 2000) gives the remainder
of the program as:
Picking a shape
This subroutine scans the keyboard until
either 1 or 2 is pressed. The new sprite
is then displayed at the top left corner
of the screen to give a visible cue that the
shape is  available: the new sprite is
created and displayed directly under
the one which i t  copies. Line 1010

and D for dragging, and to f or  ﬁxing. The
ﬁrst four keys move it, respectively, to the
right, to the left, up and down with lines
2010 to 2040. All four lines work in the
same way, and line 2010, for example,
moves the sprite to the right if the R key is
pressed, b y  increasing t h e  c olumn
position of the sprite by 5. Line 2050 ﬁxes
the position of the sprite simply by leaving

it in the position it has reached when the
key is  pressed. I t  also increases the
number stored under S by one so that the
correct number is available for the next
sprite when control is returned from this
subroutine and the program goes back to
call the subroutine starting at line 1000 to
allow another shape to be picked. The
subroutine for dragging and ﬁxing is:
2000 GET R$1 I F  R$.
2060 GOTO 2000
2070 RETURN
Program summary
The program creates its initial display
showing the available shapes, the display
area and the instructions for its use. Then
the user can select one of its shapes by
pressing its number, that is, by pressing 1
or 2. The shape that was selected can be
dragged to any position on the display
area by pressing in succession the keys R,
L, U and D. Finally, it can be ﬁxed at the
position that it has reached by pressing F.
Further developments
The interactive graphics program we have
developed can be amended, extended
and improved in a variety of ways. These
include the following.
• T h e  sha pes that the program provides
can be improved upon, particularly if
the interactive graphics are intended
for some special application.
• T h e  number of shapes in the menu
offered b y  the program can be
changed
• A f t e r  a shape has been picked, it
could be assigned a colour rather
than having to be white as in the
program.
• S in c e  only  eight sprites can b e
supported, t h e  program should
prevent its users from trying to create
a ninth. At present, the program does
not do this, and the consequences of
such an attempt can be dramatic or
even catastrophic. Make absolutely
sure that y ou save the program
before y ou ﬁrst r un it ,  because
one mistake in the program's POKE
instructions c o u ld  c aus e t h e
computer t o  'hang'. nut, i f  you
intend to see what happens when
you t r y  f o r  t h e  n in t h  s pr ite
make doubly sure that the program
has already been saved. Experience
shows that, at the very least, the
computer will have to be reset after
such an attempt, sometimes because
it w ill n o t  recognise t h e  RUN
command.

• A f t e r  six copies have been dragged
and ﬁxed in position, the original two
shapes in the menu could themselves
be made to form part of the display.
• T h e  program could be extended to
record the picture that is created
interactively so that a description of it
can be stored to help recreate it
another time.

Les Alien's utility
is a sequel to
his No Entry utility
in our February issue.
It provides the facility
to auto load and run
BASIC programs from
machine code and
then lock up the
program to make it "
/iv!
secure from prying
eyes.
IN THIS ARTICLE, I  SHALL
explain h o w  t o  provide a
machine code based loader
with auto boot. There are two
locations in the memory map
of the 6510 which cope with
this requirement -  the stack
area and the warm start vector.
I have included an explanation
and a BASIC listing to provide
the user with a method of auto-
booting t h e  main program
which cannot b e  indepen-
dently operated without the
code offered b y  t h e  auto
loader.
The w ar m s tart v ec tor
located at $030240303 is used
to point to the start address of
the a u t o  loader. Sufﬁcient
memory exists between S02A7
and $0300 to enable an auto
loader routine to be employed.
Machine code based programs
are easy to boot: they merely
need a  JUMP t o  t he start
address of the main program.
But, with a BASIC program, this
has to be restored and the main
program forced to run by ﬁlling
the input buffer with the ASCII
code for RUN + RETURN.
The auto loader boots from
$02A7 and automatically sets
up the device from which the
main program will load. Data is
located in the following area of
the auto loader:
502E1 :  ASCII code for RUN + RETURN
S02E5 :  link to restore BASIC
SO2EF :  length of ﬁle to be loaded
$ONO :  name of ﬁle to be loaded
Once the main ﬁle is loaded,
the w a r m  s tar t v ec tor  is
restored to normal, BASIC is
restored t o  provide the link
data to the next line, which was
removed dur ing t h e  SAVE
routine, a n d  t h e  program
forced to run.
When a NEW is performed
in BASIC, t h e  ﬁrs t thr ee
locations in memory are ﬁlled
with zeroes leaving intact the
remainder o f  t h e  program.
When the main program ﬁle is
saved, the ﬁrst four bytes are
written to $03E5 + increment
and replac ed w i t h  zeros,
making it secure. With three
bytes removed, the program
could be LOADed in BASIC.
However, w it h  f o u r  bytes
removed, t h is  i s  n o t  s o
straightforward.
The p r o g r a m  l i s t i n g
provides a hex loader for the
mac hine c o d e  r o u t i n e
required to load and secure the
BASIC program. Only BASIC
programs should be used with
this utility.
The pr ogr am mus t b e
entered exactly as written and
saved prior to running. Error
trap r outines  hav e b e e n
included to minimise the risk of
a system crash. Included within
this hex loader is a machine
code r outine t o  save t h e
ﬁnished product as a machine
code ﬁle whic h w ill wor k
independently o f  t h e  hex
loader. Subsequently, t h e
program w ill function w ith
either tape or disc without any
alteration whatsoever. Simply
type L O AD  f o r  t a p e  o r
LOAD"AUTOBOOT",8,1 f o r
disc and t h e  program w ill
automatically load and boot
the protection routine.
When c ompleted, t h e
program requests the name of
the program ﬁle to be loaded
for protection; the maximum
length of the name ﬁle is 15
characters. Simply enter the
required name correcting any
errors with the DEL key and
press RETURN. The program
then loads  t h e  ﬁle t o  b e
protected from tape or disc. It
must be noted that the utility
will load and save to and from
the same device as no provision
is made for tape to disc or vice
versa.
Once t h e  pr ogr am i s
loaded, it asks if it is OK to
continue. If it is, you must place
a blank tape or formatted disc
into the drive, press REC and
PLAY and enter 'Y' for yes. Two
program ﬁles are now saved -
the ﬁrst bearing the name of
the program loaded and the
second the name + space. Any
number o f  saves c an b e
s ubs equently  m a d e  b y
requesting a further copy.
To quit the routine, press FS
at any time while entering the
name ﬁle or hit RUN/STOP and
RESTORE keys simultaneously.
In conclusion, I  s hould
point out that this routine loads
and auto runs the main ﬁle by
restoring the missing link. It is
not intended to lock up the
program and make it  totally
secure. But, if  the following
POKEs are included, they will
ensure a watertight program:

P0KE8 08,225:REM D is a b le  R U N /ST O P k e y :

The world you are about to enter bears no resemblance to any arena you ever
encountered before. Weapons are of no avail in this small habitat.
The only sources of protection at your disposal are quick wits and fast reﬂexes.
The only reward is to survive against monsters of unbelievable ferocity and
cunning, and to avoid hazards more perilous and deadly than any you might ﬁnd
on a trip through the outer universe. This is the real world, populated by the
creatures of our own inner universe, where nature is red in tooth and claw. Brace
yourself now, and come with Starcade into the still water and deceptive calm of
the SAVAGE POND.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT were very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC I should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICA1C 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPeRSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STK Q U M
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order)_ However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by  calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card
