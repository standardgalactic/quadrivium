Wrappers
scripts or intermediate language binaries need special 
environment to run in
execution environment might not be installed on target 
system
wrappers create a single executable from the script or IL 
binary that has everything to run it
4

Wrapped files
often big executable and tied to one operating system
but works on that operating system regardless of installed 
programs

Obtaining the code from wrapped files
DYNAMICALLY
often: unpacker drops 
everything into %TEMP%
step 1: monitor file writing 
operations
step 2: run executable
step 3: copy the newly 
written files
STATICALLY - NOT 
ENCRYPTED
search for embedded script 
or IL binary and extract with 
hex editor
use magic numbers for IL 
binary search
use strings.exe for script 
search
STATICALLY - 
ENCRYPTED
identify wrapper with DiE
search for extraction tool
otherwise you need to 
analyze the unpacker for 
decryption procedure
