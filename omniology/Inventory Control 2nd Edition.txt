Preface 
Modem information technology has created new possibihties for more so-
phisticated and efficient control of supply chains. Most organizations can re-
duce their costs associated with the flow of materials substantially. Inventory 
control techniques are very important components in this development proc-
ess. A thorough understanding of relevant inventory models is a prerequisite 
for successful implementation. I hope that this book will be a useful tool in 
acquiring such an understanding. 
The book is primarily intended as a course textbook. It assumes that the 
reader has a good basic knowledge of mathematics and probability theory, 
and is therefore most suitable for industrial engineering and management 
science/operations research students. The book can be used both in under-
graduate and more advanced graduate courses. 
About fifteen years ago I wrote a Swedish book on inventory control. 
This book is still used in courses in production and inventory control at sev-
eral Swedish engineering schools and has also been appreciated by many 
practitioners in the field. Positive reactions from many readers made me 
contemplate writing a new book in English on the same subject. Encourag-
ing support of this idea from the Springer Editors Fred Hillier and Gary Fol-
ven finally convinced me to go ahead with that project six years ago. 
The resulting first edition of this book was published in 2000 and con-
tained quite a lot of new material that was not included in its Swedish prede-
cessor. It has since then been used in quite a few university courses in differ-
ent parts of the world, and I have received many positive reactions. Still 
some readers have felt that the book was too compact and some have asked 
for additional topics. Some of those who have used the book as a textbook 
have also requested more problems to be solved by the students.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
The Springer Editors Fred Hillier and Gary Folven finally convinced me 
to publish a Second Edition of my book. This new edition is quite different 
from the previous one. The text has been expanded by more than 50 percent. 
My main goal has been to make the new book more suitable as a textbook. 
There are eleven chapters compared to six in the previous version. The ex-
planations of different results are more detailed, and a considerable number 
of exercises have been added. I have also included several new topics. The 
additions include: alternative forecasting techniques, more material on dif-
ferent stochastic demand processes and how they can be fitted to empirical 
data, generalized treatment of single-echelon periodic review systems, ca-
pacity constrained lot sizing, short sections on lateral transshipments and on 
remanufacturing, coordination and contracts. 
When working with the book I have been much influenced by other text-
books and various scientific articles. I would like to thank the authors of 
these books and papers for indirectly contributing to my book. 
There are also a number of individuals that I would like to thank. Before I 
started to work on the revision. Springer helped me to arrange a review proc-
ess, where a number of international scholars were asked to suggest suitable 
changes in the book. These scholars were: Shoshana Anily, Tel Aviv Univer-
sity, Saif Benjaafar, University of Minnesota, Eric Johnson, Dartmouth Col-
lege, George Liberopoulos, University of Thessaly, Suresh Sethi, University 
of Texas-Dallas, Jay Swaminathan, University of North Carolina, Ruud Te-
unter, Lancaster University, Geert-Jan Van Houtum, Eindhoven University 
of Technology, Luk Van Wassenhove, INSEAD, and Yunzeng Wang, Case 
Western Reserve University. Some of them had used the first edition of the 
book in their classes. The review process resulted in most valuable sugges-
tions for improvements, and I want to thank all of you very much. 
Several colleagues of mine at Lund University have helped me a lot. I 
would especially like to mention Johan Marklund for much and extremely 
valuable help with both editions, and Kaj Rosling (now at Vaxjo University) 
for his important suggestions concerning the first edition. Furthermore, Jonas 
Andersson, Peter Berling, Fredrik Olsson, Patrik Tydesjo, and Stefan 
Vidgren have reviewed the manuscript at different stages and offered valu-
able suggestions which have improved this book considerably. Thank you so 
much. 
Finally, I would also like to thank the Springer people: Fred Hillier, Gary 
Folven, and Carolyn Ford for their support, and Sharon Bowker for polishing 
my English.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Importance and objectives of inventory control 
For more or less all organizations in any sector of the economy, Supply 
Chain Management, i.e., the control of the material flow from suppliers of 
raw material to final customers, is a crucial problem. The strategic impor-
tance of this area is today fully recognized by top management. The total in-
vestment in inventories is enormous, and the control of capital tied up in raw 
material, work-in-progress, and finished goods offers a very important po-
tential for improvement. Scientific methods for inventory control can give a 
significant competitive advantage. This book deals with a wide range of dif-
ferent inventory models that can be used when developing inventory control 
systems. 
Advances in information technology have drastically changed the possi-
bilities to apply efficient inventory control techniques. Furthermore, the re-
cent progress in research has resulted in new and more general methods that 
can reduce the supply chain costs substantially. The field of inventory con-
trol has indeed changed during the last decades. It used to mean application 
of simple decision rules, which essentially could be carried out manually. 
Modem inventory control is based on quite advanced and complex decision 
models, which may require considerable computational efforts. 
Liventories cannot be decoupled from other functions, for example pur-
chasing, production, and marketing. As a matter of fact, the objective of in-
ventory control is often to balance conflicting goals. One goal is, of course, 
to keep stock levels down to make cash available for other purposes. The 
purchasing manager may wish to order large batches to get volume dis-
counts. The production manager similarly wants long production runs to

INVENTORY CONTROL 
avoid time-consuming setups. He also prefers to have a large raw material 
inventory to avoid stops in production due to missing materials. The mar-
keting manager would like to have a high stock of finished goods to be able 
to provide customers a high service level. 
It is seldom trivial to find the best balance between such goals, and that is 
why we need inventory models. In most situations some stocks are required. 
The two main reasons are economies of scale and uncertainties. Economies 
of scale mean that we need to order in batches. Uncertainties in supply and 
demand together with lead-times in production and transportation inevitably 
create a need for safety stocks. Still, most organizations can reduce their in-
ventories without increasing other costs by using more efficient inventory 
control tools. 
There are important inventory control problems in all supply chains. For 
those who are working with logistics and supply chains, it is difficult to 
think of any qualification that is more essential than a thorough understand-
ing of basic inventory models. 
1.2 Overview and purpose of the book 
The main purpose of this book is that it should be useful as a course text-
book. The structure of the book is illustrated in Figure 1.1. 
After this introduction we consider diifQXQnt forecasting techniques in 
Chapter 2. We focus on methods like exponential smoothing and moving 
average procedures for estimating the future demand from historical demand 
data. We also provide techniques for evaluating the size of forecast errors. 
Chapters 3-6 deal with basic inventory problems for a single installation 
and items that can be handled independently. More precisely, Chapter 3 pre-
sents various basic concepts. Chapter 4 deals with deterministic lot sizing 
and Chapter 5 with safety stocks and reorder points. In Chapter 6 we discuss 
integration and optimality. 
The contents in Chapters 2 - 6 provide the foundation for an efficient 
standard inventory control system, which can include: 
â¢ A forecasting module, which periodically updates demand forecasts 
and evaluates forecast errors. 
â¢ A module for determination of reorder points and order quantities. 
â¢ Continuous or periodic monitoring of inventory levels and outstanding 
orders. Triggering of suggested orders when reaching the reorder 
points.

In Chapter 7 we leave the assumption of independent items and consider 
coordinated replenishments. Both production smoothing models and so-
called joint replenishment problems are analyzed. 
Chapters 8-10 focus on multi-echelon inventory systems, i.e., on several 
installations which are coupled to each other. The installations can represent, 
for example, stocks of raw materials, components, work-in-process, and final 
products in a production system, or a central warehouse and a number of re-
tailers in a distribution system. In Chapter 8 we consider structures and or-
dering policies. Chapter 9 deals with lot sizing and Chapter 10 with safety 
stocks and reorder points.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
Finally, in Chapter 11 we discuss various practical problems in connec-
tion with implementation of inventory control systems. 
Over the years a substantial number of excellent books and overview pa-
pers dealing with various inventory control topics have been published. A 
selection of these publications is listed at the end of this chapter. A natural 
question then is why this book is needed. To explain this, note first that this 
book is different from most other books because it also covers very recent 
advances in inventory theory, for example new techniques for multi-echelon 
inventory systems and Roundy's 98 percent approximation. Furthermore, 
this book is also different from most other books because it assumes a reader 
with a good basic knowledge of mathematics and probability theory. This 
makes it possible to present different inventory models in a compact and 
hopefully more efficient way. The book attempts to explain fundamental 
ideas in inventory modeling in a simple but still rigorous way. However, to 
simplify, several models are less general than they could have been. 
Because the book assumes a good basic knowledge of mathematics and 
probability theory, it is most suitable for industrial engineering and man-
agement science/operations research students. It can be used in a basic un-
dergraduate course, and/or in a more advanced graduate course. 
Chapter 2 may be omitted in a course which is strictly focused on inven-
tory control. If it is included, it should probably be the first part of the 
course. Chapters 3 - 6 should precede Chapters 7-10. Chapter 7 can either 
precede or succeed Chapters 8-10. Chapter 11 should come at the end of 
the course. 
An undergraduate course can, for example, be based on the following 
parts of the book: Sections 2.1 - 2.6, Sections 2.10 - 2.12, Chapters 3 - 4 , 
Section 5.1.1, Section 5.2.1, Sections 5.3 - 5.8, Section 5.13, Section 6.3, 
Section 7.2.1, Section 8.1, Sections 8.2.1 - 8.2.2, Sections 8.2.4 - 8.2.5, Sec-
tion 9.1, Section 9.2.1, Chapter 11. 
For students that have taken the suggested undergraduate course, or a cor-
responding course, a graduate course can build on a selection of the re-
maining parts of the book, e.g., Sections 5.1.2 - 5.1.5, Section 5.2.2. Sections

A graduate course for students that have no prior knowledge of inventory 
control but a good mathematical background should include most of the 
material suggested for the undergraduate course, but can exclude some of the 
sections suggested for the graduate course. 
Another purpose of this book is to describe and explain efficient inven-
tory control techniques for practitioners, and in that way simplify and pro-
mote implementation in practice. The book can, e.g., be used as a handbook 
when implementing and adjusting inventory control systems. 

 
INTRODUCTION 
5 
1.3 Framework 
Models and methods in this book are based on the cost structure that is most 
common in industrial applications. We consider holding costs including op-
portunity costs of alternative investments, ordering or setup costs, and short-
age costs or service level constraints. We will not deal with, for example, in-
ventory problems related to financial speculation, i.e., when the value of an 
item can be expected to increase, or with aggregate planning models for 
smoothing production in case of seasonal demand variations. The interaction 
with production is recognized through setup costs but also in some models 
by explicit capacity constraints. The book does not cover production plan-
ning settings that are not directly related to inventory control. 
The models considered in the book assume that the basic conditions for 
inventory control are given, for example in the form of demand distributions, 
lead-times, service requirements, and holding and ordering costs. In practice, 
most of these conditions can be changed at least in the long run. There are, 
consequently, many important questions concerning inventories that are re-
lated to the structure and organization of the inventory control system. Such 
questions may concern evaluation of investments to reduce setup costs, or 
whether the customers should be served through a single-stage or a multi-
stage inventory system. Although we do not treat such questions directly, it 
is important to note that a correct evaluation must always be based on in-
ventory models of the type considered in this book. The question is always 
whether the savings in inventory-related costs are larger than the costs for 
changing the structure of the system.

2 FORECASTING 
There are two main reasons why an inventory control system needs to order 
items some time before customers demand them. First, there is nearly always 
a lead-time between the ordering time and the delivery time. Second, due to 
certain ordering costs, it is often necessary to order in batches instead of unit 
for unit. This means that we need to look ahead and forecast the future de-
mand. A demand forecast is an estimated average of the demand size over 
some future period. But it is not enough to estimate the average demand. We 
also need to determine how uncertain the forecast is. If the forecast is more 
uncertain, a larger safety stock is required. Consequently, it is also necessary 
to estimate the forecast error, which may be represented by the standard de-
viation or the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). 
2.1 Objectives and approaches 
In this chapter we shall consider forecasting methods that are suitable in con-
nection with inventory control. Typical for such forecasts is that they con-
cern a relatively short time horizon. Very seldom is it necessary to look more 
than one year ahead. In general, there are then two types of approaches that 
maybe of interest: 
â¢ Extrapolation of historical data 
When extrapolating historical data, the forecast is based on previous de-
mand data. The available techniques are grounded in statistical methods for 
analysis of time series. Such techniques are easy to apply and use in compu-

 
8 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
terized inventory control systems. It is no problem to regularly update fore-
casts for thousands of items, which is a common requirement in connection 
with practical inventory control. Extrapolation of historical data is the most 
common and important approach to obtain forecasts over a short horizon, 
and we shall devote the main part of this chapter to such techniques. 
â¢ Forecasts based on other factors 
It is very common that the demand for an item depends on the demand 
for some other items. Consider, for example, an item that is used exclusively 
as a component when assembling some final products. It is then often natural 
to first forecast the demand for these final products, for example by ex-
trapolation of historical data. Next we determine a production plan for the 
products. The demand for the considered component is then obtained di-
rectly from the production plan. This technique to "forecast" demand for de-
pendent items is used in Material Requirements Planning (MRP) that is dealt 
with in Section 8.2.4. 
But there are also other factors that might be reasonable to consider when 
forecasting demand. Assume, for example, that a sales campaign is just 
about to start or that a competing product is introduced on the market. 
Clearly this can mean that historical data are no longer representative when 
looking ahead. It is normally difficult to take such factors into account in the 
forecasting module of a computerized inventory control system. It is there-
fore usually most practical to adjust the forecast manually in case of such 
special events. 
It is also possible, at least in principle, to use other types of dependencies. 
A forecast for the demand of ice cream can be based on the weather forecast. 
Consider, as another example, forecasting of the demand for a spare part that 
is used as a component in certain machines. The demand for the spare part 
can be expected to increase when the machines containing the part as a com-
ponent are getting old. It is therefore reasonable to look for dependencies be-
tween the demand for the spare part and previous sales of the machines. As 
another example we can assume that the demand during a certain month will 
increase with the advertising expenditure the previous month. Such depend-
encies could be determined from historical data by regression analysis. (See 
Section 2.7.) Applications of such techniques are, however, very limited. 
2.2 Demand models 
Extrapolation of historical data is, as mentioned, the most common approach 
when forecasting demand in connection with inventory control. To deter-

 
FORECASTING 
9 
mine a suitable technique, we need to have some idea of how to model the 
stochastic demand. In principle, we should try to determine the model from 
analysis of historical data. In practice this is very seldom done. With many 
thousands of items, this initial work does not seem to be worth the effort in 
many situations. In other situations there are not enough historical data. A 
model for the demand structure is instead determined intuitively. In general, 
the assumptions are very simple. 
2.2.1 Constant model 
The simplest possible model means that the demands in different periods are 
represented by independent random deviations from an average that is as-
sumed to be relatively stable over time compared to the random deviations. 
Let us introduce the notation: 
Xt = demand in period /, 
a = average demand per period (assumed to vary slowly), 
St = independent random deviation with mean zero. 
A constant model means that we assume that the demand in period t can 
be represented as 
x^ -a + Sf. 
(2.1) 
Many products can be represented well by a constant model, especially 
products that are in a mature stage of a product life cycle and are used regu-
larly. Examples are consumer products like toothpaste, many standard tools, 
and various spare parts. In fact, if we do not expect a trend or a seasonal 
pattern, it is in most cases reasonable to assume a constant model. 
2.2.2 Trend model 
If the demand can be assumed to increase or decrease systematically, it is 
possible to extend the model by also considering a linear trend. Let 
a = average demand in period 0, 
b = trend, that is the systematic increase or decrease per period (as-
sumed to vary slowly). 
A trend model means that the demand is modeled as: 

 
10 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Xf =a + bt + Sf. 
(2.2) 
During a product life cycle there is an initial growth stage and a phase-out 
stage at the end of the cycle. During these stages it is natural to assume that 
the demand follows a trend model with a positive trend in the growth stage 
and a negative trend in the phase-out stage. 
2.2.3 Trend-seasonal model 
Let 
Ft = seasonal index in period t (assumed to vary slowly). 
If, for example, Ff = 1.2, this means that the demand in period t is expected 
to be 20 percent higher due to seasonal variations. If there are T periods in 
one year, we must require that for any T consecutive periods YA=I ^t+k ~ ^ â¢ 
When using a multiplicative trend-seasonal demand model it is assumed that 
the demand can be expressed as 
Xf ={a + bt)F^ +^^. 
(2,3) 
By setting b = 0m (2.3) we obtain a constant-seasonal model. 
In (2.3) it is assumed that the seasonal variations increase and decrease 
proportionally with increases and decreases in the level of the demand series. 
In most cases this is a reasonable assumption. An alternative assumption 
could be that the seasonal variations are additive. 
Many products have seasonal demand variations. For example the de-
mand for ice cream is much larger during the summer than in the winter. 
Some products, like various Christmas decorations, are only sold during a 
very short period of the year. Still, the number of items with seasonal de-
mand variations is usually very small compared to the total number of items. 
A seasonal model is only meaningful if the demand follows essentially the 
same pattern year after year. 
2.2.4 Choosing demand model 
When looking at the three demand models considered, it is obvious that (2.2) 
is more general than (2.1), and that (2.3) is more general than (2.2). It may 
then appear that it should be most advantageous to use the most general 
model (2.3). This is, however, not true. A more general demand model cov-

 
FORECASTING 
11 
ers a wider class of demands, but on the other hand, we need to estimate 
more parameters. Especially if the independent deviations are large, it may 
be very difficult to determine accurate estimates of the parameters, and it can 
therefore be much more efficient to use a simple demand model with few pa-
rameters. A more general model should be avoided unless there is some evi-
dence that the generality will give certain advantages. 
It is important to understand that the independent deviations Â£t cannot be 
forecasted, or in other words, the best forecast for St is always zero. Conse-
quently, if the independent deviations are large there is no possibility to 
avoid large forecast errors. Consider the constant model (2.1). It is obvious 
that the best forecast is simply our best estimate of a. In (2.2) the best fore-
cast for the demand in period t is similarly our best estimate of a + bt, and in 
(2.3) our best forecast is the estimate of (a + bi)Ft. 
In some situations it may be interesting to use more general demand mod-
els than (2.1) - (2.3). (See Section 2.9.) This would, however, require a de-
tailed statistical analysis of the demand structure. In practice this is rarely 
done in connection with inventory control. 
One practical problem is that it is quite often difficult to measure demand, 
since only sales are recorded. If historical sales, instead of historical de-
mands, are used for forecasting demand, considerable errors may occur in 
situations where a relatively large portion of the total demand is lost due to 
shortages. (See Section 2.10.5.) 
2.3 Moving average 
Assume that the underlying demand structure is described by the constant 
model (2.1). Since the independent deviations St cannot be predicted, we 
simply want to estimate the constant a. If a were completely constant the 
best estimate would be to take the average of all observations of x^ But a can 
be expected to vary slowly. This means that we need to focus on the most 
recent values of Xf. The idea of the moving average technique is to take the 
average over the Almost recent values. Let 
Uf 
= estimate of a after observing the demand in period t, 
x^^ 
= forecast for period r > t after observing the demand in period t. 
We obtain: 
^t,T =^t "^ i^t + ^t-i + ^t-2 + - + ^t-N+\) / ^ â¢ 
(2.4) 

 
12 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Note that the forecast demand is the same for any value of z" > t. This is, of 
course, because we are assuming a constant demand model. 
The value of N should depend on how slowly we think that a is varying, 
and on the size of the stochastic deviations St. If a is varying more slowly 
and the stochastic deviations are larger, we should use a larger value of A^. 
This will limit the influence of the stochastic deviations. On the other hand, 
if a is varying more rapidly and the stochastic variations are small, we 
should prefer a small value of iV, which will allow us to follow the variations 
in a in a better way. 
If we use one month as our period length and set A^ = 12, the forecast is 
the average over the preceding year. This may be an advantage if we want to 
prevent seasonal variations from affecting the forecast. 
2.4 Exponential smoothing 
2.4.1 Updating procedure 
When using exponential smoothing instead of a moving average, the forecast 
is updated differently. The result is in many ways similar, though. We are 
again assuming a constant demand model, and we wish to estimate the pa-
rameter a. To update the forecast in period /, we use a linear combination of 
the previous forecast and the most recent demand x^, 
where r > t and 
a = smoothing constant (0 < a < 1). 
Due to the constant demand model the forecast is again the same for any 
future period. 
Note that the updating procedure can also be expressed as 
^t,T -^t 
- ^t-\ + ^(-^z ~ ^/-i) â¢ 
(2-6) 
We have assumed that 0 < a < 1 although it is also possible to use a=0 
and a= \. The value a^O means simply that we do not update the forecast, 
while cr = 1 means that we choose the most recent demand as our forecast. 

 
FORECASTING

2.4.2 Comparing exponential smootliing to a moving average 
To be able to compare exponential smoothing to a moving average, we can 
express the forecast in the following way: 
d^ =(l-a)df_i 
+aXf =(l-a)({l-a)df_2 
+ ca:^_|) + ox^ 
= aXf +a{l- a)Xf_i + (1 - a) a^_2 = ... = aXf + a(l - a)Xf_i 
+ ail - afxt_2 
+... + a(l-ay 
x^_^ +{l-a) ""^^ a^_â_i. 
(2.7) 
Let us now compare (2.7) to (2.4). In (2.4) the N last period demands all 
have the weight 1/A^. In (2.7) we have, in principle, positive weights for all 
previous demands, but the weights are decreasing exponentially as we go 
backwards in time. This is the reason for the name exponential smoothing. 
The sum of the weights is still unity.^ When using a moving average, a larger 
value of N means that we put relatively more emphasis on old values of de-
mand. When applying exponential smoothing, a small value of a will give 
essentially the same effect. 
When using a moving average according to (2.4) the forecast is based on 
the demands in periods t, t - I, ..., t - N + 1. The ages of these data are re-
spectively 0, 1, ..., and A^- 1 periods. The weights are all equal to 1/A^. The 
average age is therefore (A^ - l)/2 periods. To be able to compare the pa-
rameter A^ to the smoothing constant a, we shall also determine the average 
age of the data when using exponential smoothing according to (2.5), or 
equivalently (2.7). We obtain:^ 
aO + a(l-a)l + a(l-af2 
+ ... = a(l-a)S'(l-a)^{l-a)/a, 
(2.8) 
^ Let 0 < X < 1 and consider the infinite geometric sum S{x) = 1 + x + x 
+ x^... Note that S(x) = l + x- S(x). This implies that S{x) = l/{\-x). 
The 
sum of the weights in (2.7) is a-S(l-a) 
= l. 
^ Let 0 < X < 1 and consider the infinite geometric sum S'(^) = 1 + 2x + 3x .. 
= 1 + X + x^ +... + x(l + 2x + 3x^...) ^ S{x) + X â¢ S'(x). This imphes that 
S'ix) = S(x)/(l-x) = 
l/il-x)\ 

 
14 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
and we can conclude that the forecasts are based on data of the "same aver-
age age" if 
{\~a)la = {N-\)l2, 
(2.9) 
or equivalently when 
a = 2l{N + \). 
(2.10) 
Consider, for example, a moving average that is updated monthly with N 
= 12. This means that each month in the preceding year has weight 1/12. 
Consider then an exponential smoothing forecast that is also updated 
monthly. A value of a "corresponding" to iV= 12 is according to (2.10) ob-
tained as a = 2/(12 + 1) = 2/13 Â« 0.15. 
2.4.3 Practical considerations and an example 
If the period length is one month, it is common in practice to use a smooth-
ing constant a between 0.1 and 0.3. Table 2.1 shows the weights for differ-
ent previous demands for a = 0.1 and a = 0.3.

We can see from Table 2.1 that the forecasting system will react much 
faster if we use a = 0.3. On the other hand, the stochastic deviations will af-
fect the forecast more compared to when a = 0.1. When choosing a we al-
ways have to compromise. 
If the forecast is updated more often, for example each week, a smaller a 
should be used. To see how much smaller we can apply (2.10). Assume that 
we start with a monthly update and that we use the value of a "correspond-
ing" to a moving average with A^ = 12, i.e., a ^0.15. When changing to 
weekly forecasts it is natural to change N to 52. The "corresponding" value 
of a is obtained from (2.10) as a = 2/(52 + 1) ;^0.04. 

 
FORECASTING 
15 
When starting to forecast according to (2.5) in some period /, an initial 
forecast to be used as a^_| is needed. We can use some simple estimate of the 
average period demand. If no such estimate is available, it is possible to start 
with a^_| = 0, since a^_| will not affect the forecast in the long run, see (2.7). 
However, especially for small values of a, it can take a long time until the 
forecasts are reliable. If it is necessary to start with a very uncertain initial 
forecast, it may be a good idea to use a rather large value of a to begin with, 
since this will reduce the influence of the initial forecast. 
Example 2,1 The demand for an item usually fluctuates considerably. A 
moving average or a forecast obtained by exponential smoothing gives es-
sentially an average of more recent demands. The forecast cannot, as we 
have emphasized before, predict the independent stochastic deviations. Table 
2.2 shows some typical demand data and the corresponding exponential 
smoothing forecasts with a = 0.2. It is assumed that the forecast after period 
2 is dj -100.

which is rounded to 94 in Table 2.2. Note that when determining d^ the de-
mands in future periods are not known. Therefore at this stage, d^ serves as 
our forecast for any future period. After period 4 the forecast is again up-
dated 
^4 =0.8-94.4 + 0.2-170 = 109.52.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
If we compare exponential smoothing to a moving average there are some 
obvious but minor advantages with exponential smoothing. Because the av-
erage a, which we wish to estimate is assumed to vary slowly, it is reason-
able to use larger weights for the most recent demands as is done in expo-
nential smoothing. As we have discussed before, however, a moving average 
over a full year may be advantageous if we want to eliminate the influence 
of seasonal variations on the forecast. It is also interesting to note that with 
exponential smoothing we only need to keep track of the previous forecast 
and the most recent demand. 
In practice, exponential smoothing (or possibly a moving average) is, in 
general, a suitable technique for most items. But there is also usually a need 
for other methods for relatively small groups of items for which it is feasible 
and interesting to follow up trends and/or seasonal variations. 
2.5 Exponential smoothing with trend 
2.5.1 Updating procedure 
Let us now instead assume that the demand follows a trend model according 
to (2.2). To forecast demand we need to estimate the two parameters a and b, 
compared to only a in case of a constant model. As before, we cannot predict 
the independent deviations <s}. There are different techniques for estimating a 
and b. We shall here consider a method that was first suggested by Holt 
(1957). (Another technique based on linear regression is described in Section 
2.7.) Estimates of a and b are successively updated according to (2.11) and 
(2.12). 
a, ={l-a){d,_i+bi_i) 
+ ax,, 
(2.11) 
b,={l~j3)b,_,+j3(d,-a,_,), 
(2.12) 
where a and ^ are smoothing constants between 0 and 1. 
The "average" a^ corresponds to period t, i.e., the period for which we 
have just observed the demand. The forecast for a future period, / + ^ is ob-
tained as 
^t,t+k =at+k'bt, 
(2.13) 

 
FORECASTING 
17 
The most important difference compared to simple exponential smooth-
ing according to (2.5) is that the forecasts for future periods are no longer the 
same. Note that the trend, i.e., the change per period, can just as well be 
negative. 
The method means that d^is always adjusted to fit the present period. 
With this in mind, (2.11) is essentially equivalent to (2.5). As long as Xf is 
unknown, a^_| + 6^_| is our best estimate for the mean demand in period t. 
We determine d^ as a linear combination of this estimate and the new de-
mand Xf. The average difference between two consecutive values of 
a^ should in the long run be equal to the trend. Therefore, we use these 
differences in (2.12) to update the trend by exponential smoothing. 
It can be shown that if the demand is a linear function without stochastic 
variations, the forecast will, in the long run independent of the initial values, 
estimate the future demand exactly. When using simple exponential 
smoothing this is not the case. See Problem 2.4. 
2.5.2 Practical considerations and an example 
The idea behind exponential smoothing with trend is to be able to follow 
systematic linear changes in demand better. As with exponential smoothing, 
larger values of the smoothing constants a and J3 will mean that the fore-
casting system reacts faster to changes but will also make the forecasts more 
sensitive to stochastic deviations. When choosing values in practice it can be 
recommended to have a relatively low value of /? since errors in the trend 
can give serious forecast errors for relatively long forecast horizons. Note 
that the trend is multiplied by k in (2.13). It is therefore very unfortunate if 
pure stochastic variations are interpreted as a trend. When updating the fore-
cast monthly, typical values of the smoothing constants may be a = 0.2 and 
y3 = 0.05. When the forecasting system is initiated it is usually reasonable to 
set the trend to 0 and, as in exponential smoothing, let the initial d be equal 
to some estimate of the average period demand. If the initial values are very 
uncertain it can be reasonable, also for exponential smoothing with trend, to 
use extra large smoothing constants in an initial phase. 
Example 2.2 We consider the same demand data as in Example 2.1. Table 
2.3 illustrates the forecasts when applying exponential smoothing with trend 
and looking one and five periods ahead, respectively. The smoothing con-
stants are a = 0.2 and /? = 0.1. At the end of period 2, ^2 = 100 and b2 =0 .

Our forecast for period 4 is then 94.4 - 0.56 = 93.84 Â« 94. At the end of pe-
riod 4 we obtain the real demand 170. Applying (2.11) and (2.12) again we 
get 
^4 =0.8-(94.4-0.56) + 0.2-170 = 109.072, 
64 = 0.9 â¢ (-0.56) + 0.1- (109.072 - 94.4) - 0.9632. 
The forecasts in Table 2.3 are rounded to integers. 
2.6 Winters' trend-seasonal method 
Let us now assume that the demand is modeled by a multiplicative trend-
seasonal model, see (2.3). Such a model is usually only used for a few items 
with very clear seasonal variations like Christmas decorations. 
2.6.1 Updating procedure 
Winters (1960) suggested the following technique that can be seen as a 
generalization of exponential smoothing with trend. We shall describe how 

 
FORECASTING

the parameters a, b, and F( are updated. Note first that in (2.3), a + bt repre-
sents the development of demand if we disregard the seasonal variations. 
When we record the demand Xf in period t, we can similarly interpret Xt IF^ 
as the demand without seasonal variations. At this stage we have not updated 
F^ with respect to the new observation Xt, In complete analogy with (2.11) 
and (2.12) we now have 
a, ={\-a){a^_^^b,_^) 
+ a{x^lF,), 
(2.14) 
b,^{\-P)b,_,+p{a,-a,_,), 
(2.15) 
It remains to update the seasonal indices. We first determine 
F; = {\-y)F,+y{xJa,), 
(2.16) 
and 
F;_, =F,_, for/=l,2,...,r-l, 
(2.17) 
where 0 < ;K< 1 is another smoothing constant. Recall that 7 is the number of 
periods per year. Note that (2.17) means that the other indices are left un-
changed in this initial step. We must also require, however, that the sum of T 
consecutive seasonal indices is equal to T. Therefore, we need to normalize 
all indices 
T-\ T 
/t=0 
F,_,=FUT/Y^FU) 
for/ = 0,l,...,r-l. 
(2.18) 
These indices are also applied to future periods until the indices are updated 
the next time. For example, 
F^_.^^^ = F^_. for / = 0, 1, ..., r-1, and k=l,2, 
.... 
(2.19) 
The forecast for period ^ + A: is obtained as 
^t,t+k =(^t^'^'^t)Ft+k' 
(2-20)

INVENTORY CONTROL 
An alternative is to use manually set seasonal indices. In this case we do 
not need to go through (2.16) - (2.19). 
The corresponding constant seasonal model is obtained if (2.14) and 
(2.15) are replaced by 
a^ =(\-a)a^_^ +a{xJF,), 
(2.21) 
and (2.20) by 
^t,t+k =^tFt+k- 
(2-22) 
2.6.2 Practical considerations and an example 
Example 2.3 To illustrate the computations we shall go through a complete 
updating of all parameters. Assume that we are dealing with monthly up-
dates, i.e., that 7=" 12. The smoothing constants are a= 0.2, J3= 0.05, and y 
= 0.2. Assume that the last update took place in period 23 and that this up-
date resulted in the following parameters: ^23 - 9 , ^23 -1' ^12 ~ ^13 ~ ^14 
= 1.2, F^3 =Fi^=Fi7 =/^i8 =1, F^g= 0.4 and, Ao =^21 =^22 =^23 
= 1. Note that the sum of the seasonal indices equals 12. At this stage 
F24 = F|2 =1.2 according to (2.19). 
In period 24 we record the demand X24 = 7. Applying (2.14) - (2.16) we 
get 
^24 =0.8(9 + l) + 0.2(7/1.2) = 9.167 
624 =0.95-l + 0.05(9.167-9) = 0.958 
^2^4 =0.8-1.2 + 0.2.(7/9.167)-l.113 
E
24 
f]' = 11.913 . By applying (2.18) we get the updated nor-
malized indices for periods 13-24 as F13 = F^4 =1.209, ^^5 =F^^ ^F^j = 
F18 =1.007,Fi9 = 0.403,^20 =^2\ ==^22 =^23 =1.007,and F24 =1.121. 
The forecast for period 26 is obtained from (2.20) as 

 
FORECASTING 
21 
^24,26 =(9.167 + 2-0.958)-1.209-13.40, 
where we apply Fj^ = F^^ according to (2.19). 
When using a trend-seasonal method, which also updates the seasonal in-
dices, it is quite often difficult to distinguish systematic seasonal variations 
from independent stochastic deviations. The problem is that we have so 
many parameters to estimate. The indices may then become very uncertain. 
Sometimes it can therefore be more efficient to estimate the indices in other 
ways. For example, if a group of items can be expected to have very similar 
seasonal variations, it may be advantageous to estimate the indices from the 
total demand for the whole group of items. By doing so we can limit the in-
fluence of the purely stochastic deviations. Assume, for example, that we 
have a number of items that can all be classified as Christmas decorations. 
By aggregating historical demand data for all items in this group, it may be 
possible to estimate seasonal indices that are quite accurate for all items in 
the group together. We can, for example, use Winter's procedure as de-
scribed above for determining the indices for the aggregate data. Further-
more, we can usually assume that the obtained indices are also reasonably 
accurate for the individual items in the group. So when determining forecasts 
for individual items we regard these aggregate seasonal indices as given. 
In general, it can also be recommended that only items with very obvious 
seasonal variations be accepted as seasonal items. 
2.7 Using regression analysis 
2.7.1 Forecasting demand for a trend model 
Assume once again a demand model with trend according to (2.2). One 
technique to forecast the future demand has been described in Section 2.5. 
Let us consider an alternative technique. Assume that we have just obtained 
the demand in period t and that we wish to base the forecast on the N most 
recent observations Xt, x^, ..., Xt.N+i- One possibility is to use simple linear 
regression, which means that we fit a line yf_^j^ ~d^ +b^k to the observa-
tions so that the sum of the squared errors is minimized ior k= - N -^\,-N-^ 
2, ..., 0. We can then useyt+k for A: > 0 as our forecast for period t + k, i.e., 
we set x,^,^j, ^yt^k-
Let us now determine a^ and b^. We wish to minimize

2.1.2 Practical considerations and an example 
This technique based on hnear regression can be seen as a generahzation of a 
moving average (Section 2.3) to a demand model with trend, in the same 
way as we can see exponential smoothing with trend (Section 2.5) as a gen-
eralization of exponential smoothing (Section 2.4). When determining d^ 
and bf by linear regression, we give the same weight to the N most recent 
known demands as we do when determining a moving average. Furthermore, 
if instead of fitting a line to the observations, we fit a constant d^ so that the 
sum of the squared errors is minimized for k = - N+l, - N-^2, ..., 0, we will 
obtain a moving average. See Problem 2.5. Normally it is reasonable to give 
more weight to more recent observations as is done when applying exponen-
tial smoothing with trend, which has also become a more common forecast-
ing technique. 
Example 2.4 Let us go back to the data in Example 2.2 where we applied ex-
ponential smoothing with trend. Assume that the demands in periods 3-7 are 
given. The corresponding values of A: are /:= - 4, - 3, ...,0. See Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1 Forecasts (for /c > 0) with linear regression and exponen-

In Example 2.2 we updated an initial forecast ^2 =100 and 62 =0 succes-
sively. In period 7 we got d-j = 106.1571 and 67 =0.567955. See Figure 
2.1, where the corresponding forecasts ^77^^ =d'j -{-b-jk are illustrated. In 

 
24 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
the figure we also show the Hne for ^ < 0, although these values are not used 
because we already know the demands. We have also used linear regression 
(2.26) - (2.29) based on the demands in periods 3, 4, ..., 7 to determine 
a-j =115 and b^ = 4.1. The corresponding forecast is also illustrated in Fig-
ure 2.1. Again we also show the line for A: < 0, although these values are not 
used as forecasts. 
In this example we have only used five demands, N= 5, when determin-
ing the linear regression forecast. For the considered demand variations, 
which are rather typical, it is normally better to use a considerably larger A^ 
(A^> 10) to get a more stable forecast. It is easy to see from Figure 2.1 that 
an occasional very high or very low demand can affect the forecast consid-
erably. 
2.7.3 Forecasts based on other factors 
The application of linear regression for forecasting demand in case of a trend 
model is fairly limited. Usually exponential smoothing with trend is pre-
ferred. Of more practical interest is to use linear regression when the demand 
depends on one or more other factors that are known when making the fore-
cast. 
Consider as an example a spare part that is exclusively used as a replace-
ment when maintaining a certain machine. The maintenance activities are 
carried out by the company selling the spare part, and the customers have to 
order the maintenance two months in advance. In such a case it is natural to 
assume that the demand for the spare part in the next month is essentially 
proportional to the known number of machines undergoing maintenance in 
that month. Let 
Xf = demand in month t, 
Zt = number of machines undergoing maintenance in month t. 
It is then natural to assume the following demand model 
x^ =a + bz^ + â¬^, 
(2.30) 
where a and b are constants and St are independent random variations with 
mean zero. Note now that we can fit a line y^j^j^ = <3^ + b^z^^j^ to the Almost 
recent observations so that the sum of the squared errors is minimized ex-
actly as we did in Section 2.7.1, where we dealt with the special case z^+^t "=

k. We can then use yt+k for A: > 0 as our forecast for period t + k, i.e., we set 
^t,t+k - yt+k â¢ ^ complete analogy with Section 2.7.1 we get

tical, hi that case b^z^^f^ is constant and there is no unique solution for d^ 
and bi. One optimal solution is obtained by setting Z)^ = 0. From (2.32) we 
then get a^ = J, i.e., simply a moving average. 
2.7.4 More general regression models 
Several generalizations of the models considered in Sections 2.7.1-2.7.3 are 
possible. We can include more than one factor by using multiple regression, 
i.e., the demand model may be expressed as 
J 
^t =^ + Z!^7^7V +^/' 
(2.35) 
7=1 
Such models are, however, not common when forecasting demand in con-
nection with inventory control. 

 
26 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Furthermore, some nonlinear relationships can easily be transformed into 
linear models. Assume, for example, that we wish to choose positive pa-
rameters a^ and b^ so that the function 
y,^,=a,b^'*' 
(2.36) 
closely follows some previous demand data. If we take logarithms of both 
sides we get 
log yt+k = log ^t + (log bf )z^^j^, 
(2.37) 
and we can then use simple linear regression to determine loga^ and log 6^. 
2.8 Sporadic demand 
Sometimes an item is demanded very seldom, while the quantity that is de-
manded by a customer may be relatively large. It may, for example, turn out 
that customers order only about twice per year. If we use exponential 
smoothing the resulting forecast will decrease in periods without demand 
and go up again when a customer arrives. If we use a small smoothing con-
stant the forecast will still be relatively stable, but on the other hand, it will 
react very slowly to demand changes. Croston (1972) has suggested a simple 
technique to handle such a situation. The forecast is only updated in periods 
with positive demand. In case of a positive demand, two averages are up-
dated by exponential smoothing: the size of the positive demand, and the 
time between two periods with positive demand. This gives a more stable 
forecast and also a better feeling for the structure of the demand. Let as be-
fore Xt be the demand in period /. Define also 
kt = the stochastic number of periods since the preceding positive 
demand, 
k^ = estimated average of the number of periods between two positive 
demands at the end of period t, 
df == estimated average of the size of a positive demand at the end of 
period t, 
df = estimated average demand per period at the end of period t.

where 0< a, p<\ are smoothing constants. 
We get the forecast for the demand per period as 
a,=d,/k,. 
(2.40) 
2.9 Box-Jenkins techniques 
The stochastic variations in the demand models that we have considered, 
(2.1) - (2.3), are assumed to be independent. This is a major simplification. It 
is, however, easy to realize that situations exist when this is not true. If there 
are only a few large customers we can sometimes expect demands in con-
secutive periods to be negatively correlated. A high demand in one period 
can indicate that several of the customers have replenished, and it is reason-
able to expect that the demand in the next period will be a little lower. How-
ever, there are also situations with positively correlated demand. A high de-
mand in one period may mean that the product is exposed to more potential 
customers, and a high demand can also be expected in the next period. 
Forecasting techniques that can handle correlated stochastic demand 
variations and other more general demand processes have been developed by 
Box and Jenkins (1970). See also Box et al. (1994). 
A general non-seasonal demand model is known as an AutoRegressive 
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. There is a large variety of 
such models. It is common to use the notation ARIMA(p, d, q) where 
AR: p = order of autoregressive part, 
I: 
d = degree of first differencing involved, 
MA: q = order of the moving average part. 
Consider as an example an ARIMA(p, 0, q) model. 

 
28 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
(2.41) 
In (2.41) Â£i are passed errors that, combined with previous demands, are used 
as explanatory variables, while bi and C/ are constants. The errors are as-
sumed to be independent and have zero mean. The forecasting technique can 
be divided into two steps. In each period all constants are first estimated 
from historical data, and next the model is used to determine forecasts for fu-
ture periods. Assume that we want to forecast the demand in period t, and 
that we know the outcome in all previous periods. The error in period t, St, is 
then not known and is replaced by zero since it has zero mean. Otherwise we 
can use observed values of previous demands and errors. If we also want to 
forecast the demand in period / + 1 we increase the subscripts in (2.41) by 
one throughout. To get the forecast for x^+i, we also use our forecast for x^ 
and we set the unknown errors St^x and St equal to zero. 
More extensive computations are needed to use such a technique. Fur-
thermore, a relatively large record of historical data must be kept available. 
This, in connection with inventory control, can usually only be motivated for 
a few very important products. Various computer programs exist for fitting 
ARIMA models. 
The demand model in (2.41) has (i = 0. Because of that it is also equiva-
lently denoted ARMA(p, q). Similarly, if/? = 0 we can equivalently say 
IMA(^, q). Yip = (i = 0 we get a MA(^) model. 
Let us now consider an ARIMA(p, 1, q) model. 
x; = a + z?ix;_i + z?2x;_2 +...+z?^x;_^ + -^^ + q^^.j + C2S^_2 +... + Cq8^_^. 
(2.42) 
The only difference compared to (2.41) is that X/ is now replaced by 
x\ - Xi - x^_|. If ^ = 2, x'i is replaced by x'/= x- - x-.^. 
To illustrate the richness of the class of ARIMA models let us consider a 
simple example, ARIMA(0, 1,1) with a = 0 and C]=- (I - a), 
^t+i = ^/ + ^t+\ - (1 - ^)^t ^ 
(2-43) 
i.e., after observing the demand in period t our forecast for period ^ + 1 is 
df =x^ -(l-a)s^. 
(2.44) 

 
FORECASTING 
29 
Because x^ = a^_| + 6-^, we can rewrite (2.44) as 
a^ = dj^i + aSf = df_i + a(Xf - a^_|) = (1 - a)a^_| + ca^. 
(2.45) 
So we can conclude that exponential smoothing is just a special case of an 
ARIMA model. 
In practice it is usually sufficient to consider values ofp, d, q in the range 
0, 1,2. This will simplify the model identification. Still it is possible to cover 
a very large set of practical forecasting situations. 
It is also possible to add seasonality to ARIMA models. See e.g., Makri-
dakisetal. (1998). 
2.10 Forecast errors 
2.10.1 Common error measures 
So far we have only discussed how we can estimate the mean of the future 
demand. But it is not sufficient only to know the mean. To be able to deter-
mine a suitable safety stock we also need to know how uncertain the forecast 
is, i.e., how large the forecast errors tend to be. 
The most common way to describe variations around the mean is through 
the standard deviation. Let Xbe a stochastic variable with mean m = E(X). 
The standard deviation cr is defined as 
â¢â¢JE(X-
my , 
(2.46) 
and o^ is denoted the variance. In connection with forecast errors it is, by old 
tradition, not common to estimate cror o^ directly. Instead the Mean Abso-
lute Deviation (MAD) is estimated. MAD is the expected value of the abso-
lute deviation from the mean 
MAD = E\X-m\. 
(2.47) 
The original reason that MAD is estimated instead of cr or o^ was that this 
simplified the computations. Today it is no problem to estimate cror o^ di-
rectly, but still most forecasting systems first evaluate MAD. It is obvious 
that MAD and a in most cases give a very similar picture of the variations 
around the mean. It is also possible to relate them to each other. A common 

 
30 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
assumption is that the forecast errors are normally distributed. In that case it 
is easy to show that 
a = VW2 MAD Â« 1.25 MAD . 
(2.48) 
This relationship is very often used in connection with forecasting, also in 
situations when it is less natural to assume that the forecast errors are nor-
mally distributed. The approximation ^JTT / 2 Â»1.25 is in no way needed but 
is still quite often used in practice. 
2.10.2 Updating MAD or o^ 
We shall now describe how to successively update MAD or o^. Let MADt be 
the estimate of MAD after period /. At the end of period / - 1 we obtained 
from the forecasting system a forecast for period t, x^_i^^. At this stage we 
could regard this as a "mean" for the stochastic demand in period t, Xf. (Of 
course, this is not always true. Very often there are substantial systematic er-
rors in the forecast.) After period t we know Xt and the corresponding abso-
lute deviation from the "mean", x^ ~^/-i,/ â¢ It is, in general, assumed that 
these absolute variations can be seen as independent random deviations from 
a mean which varies relatively slowly, i.e., that they follow a constant model 
according to (2.1). It is then natural to update the average absolute error, 
MADt, by exponential smoothing, see (2.5). The forecast for the absolute er-
ror at the end of period t is consequently determined as 
MAD^ ={\- a)MAD^_^ + a\x^ - x^_|^^ [, 
(2.49) 
where 0 < c;^ < 1 is a smoothing constant (not necessarily the same as in 
(2.5)). 
Since the observed absolute deviations usually vary quite a lot, it is com-
mon to use a relatively small smoothing constant like a = 0.1 in the case of 
monthly updates. 
An alternative to (2.49) would be to update MADt as a moving average. 
When we have determined MADt we use (2.48) to get the corresponding 
standard deviation. 
(7, = VW2 MAD^ Â«1.25 MAD^. 
(2.50) 

 
FORECASTING

Example 2.5 We consider the same demand data and the same forecasting 
technique (exponential smoothing with trend) as in Example 2.2. Table 2.4 
shows the updated values of MAD t when using a= OA and the initial value 
MAD2 = 20. 
Table 2.4 Updated values of MADt with a = 0.1 and initial value 
MAD2 = 20. The forecasts are obtained by exponential 
smoothing with trend. The smoothing constants are a = 
0.2 and /?= 0.1, and the initial forecast a2=100, ^2= 0, 
see Example 2.2.

Note first that the forecast for period 3 in period 2 was ^2 +62 = 100. In 
period 3 we then obtain from (2.49) 
MAD^ =0.9-20 + 0.1-|72-100| = 20.8, 
and similarly in period 4 
MAD^ =0.9-20.8 + 0.1-|l70-93.84| = 26.336. 
Note that when updating MAD we use forecasts that are not rounded, e.g., 
94.4 - 0.56 = 93.84 instead of 94, see Example 2.2. 
A less common technique is to update the variance in the same way 
a^ -(l-a)cr^li +a(x^ -^/-u)^- 
(2-51) 
When starting to update MAD or c^ we need an initial value. This value is 
easy to obtain if historical data of forecast errors are available. If such data 
are not available it can be reasonable to determine initial values as functions 
of the estimated demand. See Section 2.10.3. As we have discussed before 

 
32 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
concerning forecasts, it may also be a good idea to use a relatively large 
smoothing constant during a short initial period if the initial MAD is very 
uncertain. 
The determination of forecast errors in connection with inventory control 
is normally carried out as described in this section. However, other possi-
bilities exist, for example, in connection with linear regression. See also 
Section 2.10.3. 
2.10.3 Determining the standard deviation as a function of 
demand 
Sometimes when a forecasting system is initiated we do not have a sufficient 
number of historical data per item to evaluate initial values of MAD or a. 
Still, we may have some idea of the size of the average demand a . hi such a 
situation it is common to determine an initial value of cr as a function of the 
average demand. We can get a corresponding MAD from (2.50). Such func-
tions are sometimes also used as an alternative to the updating procedures 
(2.49) or (2.51). This can be reasonable in case of very low demand, when it 
may be difficult to get good estimates by using (2.49) or (2.51). Examples of 
such items can be certain types of spare parts. 
The forecast errors are nearly always increasing with the average de-
mand, but the relative errors are decreasing. When determining cr as a func-
tion of the average demand a , a reasonable and common approach is to use 
the form 
a = k^a^\ 
(2.52) 
or equivalently 
log a = log ki + ^2 ^^g ^ ' 
(2.53) 
so we can evaluate log ki and kj by linear regression. The same function is 
used for many items, so we do not need to go back in time much to get a 
relatively good estimate. As before, we can get a corresponding MAD from 
(2.50). 
2.10.4 Forecast errors for other time periods 
Our determination of MADt and cjt in Section 2.10.2 concerns the forecast er-
ror when we look one period ahead. The error when forecasting the demand 

 
FORECASTING 
33 
in a more distant period is usually larger. In principle we could update the er-
ror for such a forecast similarly. This is not often done in practice, though. It 
is most common to use MADf as the expected absolute error not only for the 
demand in period t + I, but also for the demand in period t -^ k for k > I. 
This means that we usually are underestimating the errors for such forecasts. 
The estimates MADf and a^ represent the mean absolute deviation and the 
standard deviation of the demand during one period. If (7^, for example, is 
updated monthly, the time period implicitly considered is one month. In 
connection with inventory control it is very common, though, that we need 
to consider a shorter or a longer period, e.g., a certain lead-time. Assume that 
after updating at in period t, we need to determine the standard deviation of 
the forecast error over L time periods, o(Z), where L can be any positive 
number, i.e., not necessarily integral. If, as discussed above, we disregard 
that the errors usually increase when forecasting the demand for a more dis-
tant period, and also assume that forecast errors are independent over time, 
we obtain: 
CT{L) = CJ^4L . 
(2.54) 
Example 2.(5 Assume that MADt is updated each month and that the most re-
cent value is MADt = 40. From (2.50) we obtain oj ^ 1.25 40 = 50. In case of 
independence over time, the standard deviation over two months is obtained 
as a(2) = 50 2^'^ Â« 71, and over 0.5 month as a(0.5) = 50" 0.5^'' ^ 35. 
The determination of o{L) in (2.54) is very common. It is important, though, 
to recall that it is based on the assumptions discussed above. For a long lead-
time the standard deviation is therefore often underestimated. One way to 
reduce the error is to use a forecast period that is of about the same length as 
the majority of the lead-times. This will limit the possible error when apply-
ing (2.54). If the lead-times vary a lot it may also be reasonable to update the 
forecast and the forecast error for different periods. 
Another possibility is to use the following slightly more general relation-
ship instead of (2.54) 
(7(L) = a,L', 
(2.55) 
where 0.5 < c < 1. Consider first the assumption that the forecast errors are 
independent. The value c = 0.5 corresponds to independence over time and 
gives (2.54), while the other extreme c= I corresponds to forecast errors that 
are completely correlated over time. However, we can also use c > 0.5 to 

 
34 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
compensate for disregarding that the forecast error for a more distant period 
tends to be larger. 
2.10.5 Sales data instead of demand data 
In practice it is quite often difficult to measure the real demand, because if a 
demand cannot be met this results in a lost sale, which is not accounted for. 
If it is sales instead of demand that is observed, the forecast is of course also 
for the sales. This means a systematic error that is not considered by the 
techniques discussed in Sections 2.10.1-2.10.4. If we keep a high service 
level there are very few lost sales and the error can more or less be disre-
garded. But situations also exist when this error may be quite large. An ob-
vious possibility to reduce the error is to try to account for demands that can 
not be met. When a customer asks for some item that is not in stock, this 
should be accounted for as a demand. Another possibility is to adjust the 
forecasting technique. Consider a certain period and assume that there are 15 
units in stock in the beginning of the period, and that there are no incoming 
deliveries during the period. Assume also that demands that cannot be met 
directly are lost. If the stock on hand at the end of the period is 5, we know 
that the period demand was 10. However, if the stock on hand at the end of 
the period is 0, we only know that the demand was at least 15. There are 
forecasting techniques that take this into account and can provide more accu-
rate forecasts. See Nahmias (1994). 
2.11 Monitoring forecasts 
The forecasting methods that we have described will, in general, work ex-
cellently for most items. However, a forecasting system will normally com-
prise several thousand items. Various problems will occur for a few of these 
items in each period. These problems may depend on errors in the input to 
the system or on a less appropriate forecasting technique. This means that 
there is a need to follow up and check the forecasts. It would be extremely 
time consuming to do this manually for all items. It is therefore usually suit-
able to let the forecasting system itself perform certain automatic tests to 
check whether an item should go through a detailed manual examination. 
These tests are similar to techniques used in connection with statistical qual-
ity control. The tests are performed each time the forecasts are updated and 
result in a list of items that should be checked in more detail. If necessary the 
forecasting procedure can be reinitiated for some of these items with new 
initial values and possibly new parameters, e.g., smoothing constants. 

 
FORECASTING 
35 
Two types of tests that are very often done automatically are to check 
whether the input, i.e., the new demand, is reasonable, and to evaluate 
whether the forecast represents the mean adequately. 
2.11.1 Checking demand 
If the forecasting system works well, MAD and the corresponding standard 
deviation a illustrate how much the demand can be expected to deviate from 
the forecast. Assume that that in period t-l we obtained a certain forecast for 
period t, x^^y and a certain MADt-x- If ^^-i^^ can be regarded as the mean 
and the deviations of the demand from the forecast are normally distributed, 
we can determine the probability that the forecast error in period t is within k 
standard deviations as, 
P^^t - ^t-u I < ^^t-\) = ^ W - ^(-^)' 
(2-56) 
where 0(-)is the cumulative normal distribution function. See Appendix 2. 
It is common to use the test 
\^t "" ^t-u < kiMAD^_i = k^(Jt_\ 14n II, 
(2.57) 
with A:i = 4 to check whether Xt is "reasonable". (When checking x^ it is ap-
propriate to use MADt-x instead of MADt, which has been affected by the 
demand that we are checking.) By applying (2.56) with k = AHTT 12 
Â« 3.19, we can see that the probability that the test should be satisfied is ap-
proximately 99.8 percent under normal conditions. Consequently, if (2.57) is 
not satisfied there is probably some error in the new demand or in the fore-
cast, alternatively, an event with a very low probability has occurred. Any-
way it is reasonable to check the item manually. If it turns out that there is an 
error, it should be corrected. After that the forecasting system for the item is 
restarted with new initial values. 
2.11.2 Checking that the forecast represents the mean 
The determination of MADt in (2.49) means that we evaluate the average ab-
solute error. It is also common to update the average error in a similar way. 
Let 
Zf = estimate of the average error in period t. 

 
3 6 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
In complete analogy with (2.49) we have 
z^ = (1 -a)z^_i 4- a{x^ - x^_|^^), 
(2.58) 
where 0 < a < 1 is a smoothing constant. If the forecast works as a correct 
mean, positive and negative forecast errors should be of about the same size 
in the long run, and Zt can be expected to be relatively close to zero. On the 
other hand, if z^ differs significantly from zero we have reason to believe that 
the forecast is biased. When updating Zt it is natural to use zero as the initial 
value and to have a relatively small smoothing constant like a = 0.1 in case 
of monthly updates. A common test is 
\z\<k2MAD^, 
(2.59) 
What is a suitable value of the parameter A:2? Comparing (2.58) to (2.49), it is 
evident that we should expect |zj <MAD^. A reasonable initial value of k2 
may be 0.5. If this leads to too many error signals it can be reasonable to in-
crease k2. Similarly, if there are very few error signals we can tighten the 
control by using a smaller A:^-
Systematic errors that are detected by (2.59) can have different explana-
tions. One possibility is that the forecasting method is inadequate. For exam-
ple, if demand has a trend and we are using simple exponential smoothing, 
there will always be a systematic error. Another common reason is that a 
large change in the average demand has occurred. It will then take a long 
time for the forecast to approach the new demand level. If such a situation is 
detected by (2.59), we can improve the forecasts by restarting the system 
with a new, more accurate initial forecast. 
The tests (2.57) and (2.59) should, in general, be thought of as a basis for 
manual adjustments of the forecasting system. It is also possible to design an 
adaptive forecasting system that makes various adjustments automatically. 
The system can, for example, change forecasting method and smoothing 
constants after performing various tests. See e. g., Gardner and Dannenbring 
(1980). Such systems are very seldom used in practice, though. 
2.12 Manual forecasts 
Most of the forecasting methods we have discussed in this chapter have the 
purpose of extrapolating historical demands as well as possible. There are 
situations though, when such forecasting techniques are less suitable. There 

 
FORECASTING 
37 
can be known factors that will affect the future demand, but which have not 
affected the previous demand. In some cases it is possible to model the in-
fluence of such factors as described in Section 2.7.3. However, in general, it 
is both difficult and impractical to take such factors into account within a 
computerized forecasting system. Usually it is much more practical to let 
manual forecasts replace automatic forecasts. A forecasting system should 
therefore be designed so that such replacements are easy. 
Normally, manual forecasts are only needed for a limited number of 
items over relatively short times. It is never a good idea to use a manual 
forecast if the forecast simply means an extrapolation of historical data. Such 
forecasts are obtained much more easily and with fewer errors by using the 
various methods that have been described earlier in this chapter. 
Examples of situations when manual forecasts could be considered are: 
â¢ 
price changes 
â¢ 
sales campaigns 
â¢ 
conflicts that affect demand 
â¢ 
new products without historical data 
â¢ 
new competitive products on the market 
â¢ 
new regulations 
A special problem with manual forecasts is that they sometimes have sys-
tematic errors because of optimistic or pessimistic attitudes by the forecast-
ers.

A company is using exponential smoothing with trend to forecast the demand 
for a certain product. The smoothing constants are a = 0.2 and ^ = OA. MAD 
is updated with exponential smoothing with a = 0.1. At the end of month 4 
the mean and trend were 220 and 10, respectively, and MAD was 35. The de-
mand in month 5 is 250. Update forecast and MAD and estimate mean and 
standard deviation for the total demand during the three months 6-8. The 
forecast errors are independent over time. 
2.15 
The demand for a product has a clear trend. The company producing the 
product is therefore determining its forecasts by applying exponential 
smoothing with trend. At the end of March the updated mean was 50 and the 
trend was 13. MAD was 2. The smoothing constants for exponential smooth-
ing with trend are a = 0.2 and J3 - 0.05 . MAD is updated by exponential 
smoothing with a = 0A . The demands during April, May, and June are 57, 
64, and 73 respectively. Update forecast and MAD during these months. De-
termine also a forecast for the total demand during July and August and the 
standard deviation for this period. (Forecast errors during different periods 
are assumed to be independent.) 
2.16 The forecast for an item is determined by exponential smoothing with a = 
0.2. When updating MAD, a = 0.1. After the update at the end of period 6 the 
forecast is 320 and MAD = 82. We have just observed the demand in period 
7, which is 290.

3 COSTS AND CONCEPTS 
In Chapters 3-6 we consider a large and very important class of inventory 
problems, for which, in general, we can offer satisfactory solutions that can 
be used in practice relatively easily. This class of systems is characterized by 
two qualities: 
â¢ Different items can be controlled independently. 
â¢ The items are stocked at a single location, i.e., not in a multi-stage 
inventory system. 
The first condition is very often satisfied, but there are also many impor-
tant counter examples. When orders are issued to a factory for example, we 
usually wish to obtain a smooth production load. This means that we need to 
coordinate orders for different items and the condition is evidently not satis-
fied. Another example is when we get a discount that is based on the total 
order sum for several items. In that case we wish to order these items at the 
same time. We shall deal with such situations in Chapter 7. 
There are also many practical settings where the second condition is not 
satisfied. For example, when distributing an item over a large geographical 
region, it is common to use an inventory system with a central warehouse 
together with local stocks close to the final customers. Such situations are 
considered in Chapters 8-10. 
Typical settings where the two conditions are satisfied can be found at 
many wholesalers. In production there is very often a certain coupling be-
tween different stocks. Sometimes, though, this coupling is so weak that it 
can be disregarded. 

 
44 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
3.1 Considered costs and other assumptions 
The models that we deal with are based on certain standard assumptions. In 
general, we consider the following costs or constraints. (See also Berling, 
2005, Silver et al., 1998, and Zipkm, 2000.) 
3.1.1 Holding costs 
By holding stock we have an opportunity cost for capital tied up in inven-
tory. This part of the holding cost should, in principle, be closely related to 
the return on an alternative investment. It is not necessarily equal to the ex-
pected return though, because we also need to take into account financial 
risks associated with alternative investments. The capital cost is usually re-
garded to be the dominating part of the holding cost. Other parts can be ma-
terial handling, storage, damage and obsolescence, insurance, and taxes. All 
costs that are variable with the inventory level should be included. Consider, 
for example, the costs for storage space. In some situations with owned 
warehouses, these costs may be essentially fixed. This means that they 
should not be included in the holding cost. In other situations, however, it 
may be possible to increase or decrease rented warehouse space in the short 
run, and the costs should consequently be included in the holding cost. 
The holding cost per unit and time unit is often determined as a percent-
age of the unit value. Note that this percentage can usually not be the same 
for all types of items. It should, for example, be high for computers due to 
obsolescence. In general, the percentage should be considerably higher than 
the interest rate charged by the bank. 
An alternative to including the financial costs in the holding cost is to 
consider the net present value, i.e., the discounted value, of all expenditures 
and revenues. See, for example, Grubbstrom (1980). In this book we will 
only consider standard holding costs. 
3.1.2 Ordering or setup costs 
There are usually fixed costs associated with a replenishment (independent 
of the batch size). In production, common reasons are setup and learning 
costs. But there are also administrative costs associated with the handling of 
orders. Other fixed costs can occur in connection with transportation and 
material handling. The setup cost may be especially high if an expensive ca-
pacity constrained machine has to stop during the setup. In some situations, 
though, most of the setup can take place outside the machine, which reduces 
the costs. 

 
COSTS AND CONCEPTS 
45 
When ordering from an outside supplier there are also various fixed costs 
for an order, like costs for order forms, authorization, receiving, inspection, 
and handling of invoices from the supplier. 
3.1.3 Shortage costs or service constraints 
If an item is demanded and cannot be delivered due to a shortage, various 
costs can occur. There are situations when a customer agrees to wait while 
his order is backlogged, but also situations when the customer chooses some 
other supplier. If the customer order is backlogged, there are often extra 
costs for administration, price discounts for late deliveries, material han-
dling, and transportation. If the sale is lost, the contribution of the sale is also 
lost. In any case, it usually means a loss of good will that may affect the 
sales in the long run. Most of these costs are difficult to estimate. 
Shortage costs in production are, in general, even more difficult to esti-
mate. If a component is missing for example, this can cause a chain of nega-
tive consequences like delays, rescheduling, etc. 
There are also situations when shortage costs are easy to evaluate. As-
sume, for example, that a missing component can be bought at a higher price 
in a store next door. We can then use the additional cost as our shortage cost. 
Because shortage costs are so difficult to estimate, it is very common to 
replace them by a suitable service constraint. Of course it is also difficult to 
determine an adequate service level, but yet this is regarded to be somewhat 
simpler in many practical situations. Still, the motivation for a service con-
straint is nearly always some underlying shortage cost. 
3.1.4 Other costs and assumptions 
The above costs are those that are most common in inventory models. Al-
though we shall in most cases limit our attention to these costs, it is evident 
that it can also be relevant to consider other costs. 
As discussed in Section 3.1.1 the holding cost is usually determined as a 
percentage of the unit cost, which is normally obtained as the cost figure 
given by accounting. Otherwise it is in most cases assumed that the unit cost 
is not affected by inventory control decisions concerning e.g., order quantity 
and reorder point. There are some obvious exceptions, though. One example 
is when a large order quantity can affect the unit cost through a discount. See 
Section 4.3. 
Other costs that should be considered are the costs of operating the inven-
tory control system. This includes costs for data acquisition and computa-
tion, as well as costs for training the involved personnel.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
In this book, we shall generally, assume that demand is backordered and 
not lost in case of a shortage. Models with backordering are usually much 
simpler, and unless shortages are very common, can also be used as an ap-
proximation in case of lost sales. A model with lost sales is considered in 
Section 5.14. 
3.2 Different ordering systems 
3.2.1 Inventory position 
The purpose of an inventory control system is to determine when and how 
much to order. This decision should be based on the stock situation, the an-
ticipated demand, and different cost factors. 
When talking about the stock situation, it is natural to think of the physi-
cal stock on hand. But an ordering decision can not be based only on the 
stock on hand. We must also include the outstanding orders that have not yet 
arrived, and backorders, i.e., units that have been demanded but not yet de-
livered. In inventory control the stock situation is therefore characterized by 
the inventory position: 
inventory position = stock on hand + outstanding orders - backorders. 
If the customers can reserve units for later delivery, the reserved units are 
usually also subtracted from the inventory position. This means that the in-
ventory control handles the reserved units in the same way as units that have 
been ordered for immediate delivery. This may be reasonable unless the de-
livery time is too distant, which will result in unnecessary holding costs. If 
the delivery time is far away, a reasonable policy is to subtract the reserved 
units from the inventory position first when the remaining time until delivery 
is less than a certain time limit. The customers will then, with a high prob-
ability, still get their orders in time. We shall from now on disregard reserva-
tions. 
Although the ordering decisions are based on the inventory position, 
holding and shortage costs will depend on the inventory level: 
inventory level = stock on hand - backorders. 
In some situations the holding costs should also include holding costs for 
outstanding orders. The resulting additional cost term is easy to evaluate be-

 
COSTS AND CONCEPTS 
47 
cause the average outstanding orders is easily obtained as the average lead-
time demand. 
3.2.2 Continuous or periodic review 
An inventory control system can be designed so that the inventory position is 
monitored continuously. As soon as the inventory position is sufficiently 
low, an order is triggered. We denote this continuous review. The triggered 
order will be delivered after a certain lead-time. Let 
L = lead-time. 
The lead-time is the time from the ordering decision until the ordered 
amount is available on shelf. It is not only the transit time from an external 
supplier or the production time in case of an internal order. It also includes, 
for example, order preparation time, transit time for the order, administrative 
time at the supplier, and time for inspection after receiving the order. 
An alternative to continuous review is to consider the inventory position 
only at certain given points in time. In general, the intervals between these 
reviews are constant and we talk about periodic review. Let 
T = review period, i. e., the time interval between reviews. 
Both alternatives have advantages as well as disadvantages. Continuous 
review will reduce the needed safety stock. When using a continuous review 
system the inventory position when ordering should guard against demand 
variations during the lead-time L. With periodic review the uncertain time is 
instead T -^ L. Consider a review when no order is triggered. The next possi-
bility to order is T time units ahead, and consequently, the time to the next 
possible delivery is T + L. Therefore, the inventory position must guard 
against demand variations during this time. 
Periodic review has advantages, especially when we want to coordinate 
orders for different items (see Chapter 7). Although modem information 
technology has reduced the costs for inspections considerably, periodic re-
view will also reduce the costs for the inventory control system. This is es-
pecially true for items with high demand. For items with low demand it does 
not cost much more to use continuous review. The advantages of continuous 
review are also usually larger for such items. In practice it is therefore com-
mon to use continuous review for items with low demand, and periodic re-
view for items with higher demand. 
Periodic review with a short review period T is, of course, very similar to 
continuous review.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
3.2.3 Different ordering policies 
The two most common ordering policies in connection with inventory con-
trol are often denoted (R, Q) policy and (s, S) policy. 
3.2.3.1 (i?,0 policy 
When the inventory position declines to or below the reorder point R, a batch 
quantity of size Q is ordered. (If the inventory position is sufficiently low it 
may be necessary to order more than one batch to get above R, The consid-
ered policy is therefore sometimes also denoted (R, nQ) policy.) If demand is 
continuous, or one unit at a time, we will always hit the reorder point exactly 
in case of continuous review.

Figure 3.1 (R, Q) policy with periodic review. Continuous demand. 
In case of periodic review, or if the triggering demand is for more than one 
unit, it will often occur that the inventory position is below R when ordering. 
In this case we will not reach the position R + Q after ordering. Figure 3.1 
illustrates this for a periodic review (R, Q) policy. Note that the development 
of the inventory position is completely independent of the lead-time L. 

 
COSTS AND CONCEPTS 
49 
An ordering policy that is very similar to an (R, Q) policy is a so-called 
KANBAN policy. With a KANBAN policy there are A^ containers, each con-
taining Q units of the item and with a card on the bottom. When a container 
becomes empty, the card (a KANBAN) is used as an order for Q units. A^- 1 
of the KANBAN cards are always associated with full containers, which are 
either in stock or ordered but not yet delivered. So the inventory position is 
{N - 1)Q plus the number of units in the container that at present is satisfying 
the demand. When this container is empty an order is triggered. A KAN-
BAN policy is consequently very similar to an {R, Q) policy with R = (N -
1)Q. But if there are already A^ outstanding orders, i.e., no stock on hand, no 
more orders can be triggered since no KANBANs are available. We can 
therefore interpret a KANBAN policy as an {R, Q) policy where backorders 
are not subtracted from the inventory position. 
3.2.3.2 (s, 5) policy 
This policy is also similar to an (R, Q) policy. The reorder point is denoted 
by s. When the inventory position declines to or below s, we order up to the 
maximum level S. The difference compared to an (7?, Q) policy is that we no 
longer order multiples of a given batch quantity. If we always hit the reorder 
point exactly (continuous review and continuous demand), the two policies 
are equivalent provided s = R and S = R + Q. But if we do not always hit the 
reorder point exactly, the equivalence does not hold. Figure 3.2 illustrates 
such a situation with periodic review. Since we order when the inventory po-
sition is below the reorder point, we would not have reached the inventory 
position R + Q after ordering in case of an {R, Q) system. See Figure 3.1. 
In case of periodic review, it may happen with either policy that we do 
not reach the reorder point at a certain inspection. In that case no order is 
triggered. A variation of the {s, S) policy denoted S policy, or order-up-to--S 
policy, or base stock policy, will always order unless the period demand is 
zero. An S policy simply means that we order up to S independent of the in-
ventory position. An S policy is equivalent to an {s, S) policy with s = S - I 
and to an (R, Q) policy with R = S - I and Q = l.Jn case of continuous re-
view, a single demand may similarly not trigger an order when using an (7?, 
0 policy or an (s, S) policy. A policy which always immediately orders the 
demanded number of units is also an S policy, but is in connection with con-
tinuous review often denoted (S - I, S) policy. 
For single-echelon systems it is possible to show that the optimal policy, 
under very general assumptions, is of the (s, S) type. See Section 6.2. From 
a theoretical point of view it should therefore be advantageous to use (s, S) 
policies. However, the cost differences are, in general, very small, and in 
practice it is often easier to use an (R, Q) policy with a fixed batch quantity.

Independent of which pohcy we choose, it remains to determine the con-
trol parameters R and Q, or s and S. We shall deal with this problem in

4 SINGLE-ECHELON SYSTEMS: 
DETERMINISTIC LOT SIZING 
When using an (R, Q) policy we need to determine the two parameters R and 
Q. We shall first consider the determination of the batch quantity Q. (When 
using an (s, S) policy, Q essentially corresponds to ^S - ^.) We shall assume 
that the future demand is deterministic and given. If the lead-time is con-
stant, it does then not affect the problem and we can therefore just as well 
assume that the lead-time L = 0. The only difference in case of a positive 
lead-time is that we need to order L time units earlier. See also the discussion 
in Section 4.1.3. (If the demand is stochastic, we cannot disregard the lead-
time.) 
Deterministic demand may seem to be a very unrealistic assumption. In 
most situations there are stochastic variations in demand. It turns out, 
though, that the assumption of deterministic demand is in general very rea-
sonable. First of all there exist situations when a company is really facing 
deterministic demand. An example is a company delivering according to a 
long-range contract. More important is that it is also often feasible to use 
deterministic lot sizing in case of stochastic demand. The determination of Q 
should, even in a stochastic case, essentially mean that we balance ordering 
and holding costs. Although a larger Q will, in fact, reduce the need for 
safety stock, this is of minor importance. A standard procedure in practice is 
therefore to first replace the stochastic demand by its mean and use a deter-
ministic model to determine Q. Given Q, a stochastic model is then used in a 
second step to determine the reorder point R. Under relatively general as-
sumptions it is possible to show that this approximate procedure will give a 
cost increase compared to optimum that is always lower than 11.8 percent 

 
52 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
(See Axsater, 1996 and Zheng, 1992). In general, the cost increase is much 
lower than that. 
4.1 The classical economic order quantity model 
4.1.1 Optimal order quantity 
The most well-known result in the whole inventory control area may be the 
classical economic order quantity formula. This simple result has had and 
still has an enormous number of practical applications. It was first derived by 
Harris (1913), but Wilson (1934) is also recognized in connection with this 
model. The model is based on the following assumptions: 
â¢ 
Demand is constant and continuous. 
â¢ 
Ordering and holding costs are constant over time. 
â¢ 
The batch quantity does not need to be an integer. 
â¢ 
The whole batch quantity is delivered at the same time. 
â¢ 
No shortages are allowed. 
We shall use the following notation: 
h = holding cost per unit and time unit, 
A = ordering or setup cost, 
d = demand per time unit, 
Q = batch quantity, 
C = costs per time unit. 
Since no safety stock is needed and no shortages are allowed the inven-
tory level will vary over time as in Figure 4.1, i.e., a batch is delivered ex-
actly when the preceding batch is finished. 
The relevant costs are the costs that vary with the batch quantity g, i.e., 
the holding costs and the ordering costs. We obtain 
C = ^h + -A. 
(4.1)

Q 
The first term in (4.1) represents the holding costs, which we obtain as the 
average stock, Q/2, multiplied by the holding cost h. The average number of 
orders per time unit is d/Q, and multiplying by the ordering cost A, we obtain 
the ordering costs per time unit in the second term.

i.e., for the optimal order quantity the holding costs happen to be exactly 
equal to the ordering costs. 
In (4.1) we have expressed the costs as a function of the order quantity Q. 
An alternative is to express the costs in terms of the cycle time T = Q/d. Ob-
viously, T = Q / d.

From (4.5) it is evident that the relative cost increase C/C" when using the 
batch quantity Q instead of the optimal g* is a simple function of Q/Q . It 
turns out that even quite large deviations from the optimal order quantity 
will give very limited cost increases. For example, if Q/Q*= ^ill (or 2/3) we 
get C/C* = 1.08 from (4.5), i.e., the cost increase is only 8 percent. It is also 
interesting to note that the costs are even less sensitive to errors in the cost 
parameters. For example, if we use a value of the ordering cost A that is 50 
percent higher than the correct ordering cost, we can see from (4.3) that the 
resulting relative error in the batch quantity is Q/Q*= (3/2)^^^ =1.225 and the 
relative cost increase is only about 2 percent. Consequently, we can conclude 
that the choice of cost parameters when using the classical economic order 
quantity is not that critical. It should be noted, however, that other more 
complex situations exist when even small errors in the batch quantities can 
affect the costs dramatically. We shall discuss such situations in Chapter 7. 
Example 4.1 Consider an item with unit cost $100, and holding cost rate per 
year corresponding to 20 percent of the value. The constant demand is 300 
units per year. The ordering cost is $200. We get /z - 0.20 â¢ 100 =$20 per 
year. A = $200 and d = 300 per year. Applying (4.3) we obtain the optimal 
batch quantity Q* = {2Ad/hf^ = (2 â¢ 200 â¢ 300/20)'^' = 77.5 units. 
In practice Q often has to be an integer. Assume that n < Q* < n + 1. Since 
the cost function (4.1) is convex, it is obvious that the best integral Q is ei-
ther n or n+ 1. We can see from (4.5) that we should choose the lower value 
Q = nifQyn 
<{n+iyQ\ 
4.1.3 Reorder point 
Assume that we want to use a continuous review {R, Q) policy under the 
considered simple assumptions. How should we choose the reorder point Rl 
If the lead-time X = 0 we simply choose i? = 0. This means that we order 
when the inventory position is equal to zero and we get the delivery immedi-

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - LOT SIZING

ately. Note that when i = 0 the inventory position is always equal to the in-
ventory level. Assume then a lead-time Z > 0. As we have pointed out above, 
we only need to order the batch L time units earlier. This means that we need 
to change the reorder point to i? = Ld, i.e., we add the deterministic lead-time 
demand. Assume for example, that this results in i? =^ 2.5Q. An order is trig-
gered when the inventory position is equal to R, while the inventory level 
will never exceed Q. When an order is triggered, there are two outstanding 
orders and the inventory level is equal to QI2, i.e., the inventory position is 
no longer equal to the inventory level. 
4.2 Finite production rate 
If there is a finite production rate the whole batch is not delivered at the 
same time. The batch is instead delivered continuously with a certain pro-
duction rate. It is quite easy to modify the basic model to encompass such 
successive deliveries. The inventory will now vary as in Figure 4.2. 
Let 
p == production rate (p> d). 
In each cycle we produce during the time Q/p. Consider the first cycle in 
Figure 4.2. During the time Q/p the stock is increasing at the rate;? - d. The 
maximum level is (Q/p)(p-d) "= Q(l - d/p). After the time Q/p the stock is 
decreasing with rate d. 
The only difference compared to the classical model (4.1) is that the av-
erage inventory level is now g(l - d/p)/! instead of g/2 and we obtain: 
C = S(1ZA^J,,IA.

The optimal solution is then

It is easy to show that (4.5) is also valid in this case. Note furthermore 
that if /? -> 00, (4.7) degenerates to the classical economic order quantity 
formula (4.3).

4.3 Quantity discounts 
In general, it is relatively easy to include other costs that vary with the order 
quantity in lot sizing models. We shall illustrate this by considering the sim-
ple model in Section 4.1.1 with an additional assumption. If the order quan-
tity is sufficiently large we get an all-units discount on the purchase price. 
Let 
V = price per unit for Q < Qo, i.e., the normal price, 
V' = price per unit for Q > Qo, where v' < v. 
Note that we assume that we get the whole order at the lower price if Q> 
Qo. It is also possible to handle the case when there is a discount only for 
units above the breakpoint QQ. See Benton and Park (1996). 
The holding cost will depend on the unit cost and we assume that it has 
the following structure: 
h = ho + rv 
forQ<Qo. 
h' = ho + rv' 
forg> go, 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
57 
i.e., we assume that the holding costs consist of two parts, a capital cost ob-
tained by applying the interest rate r on the unit cost, and other out-of-pocket 
holding costs HQ independent of the price per unit. As before, A is the order-
ing cost and d the constant demand per time unit. 
Since the purchasing costs now depend on the order quantity they must 
be included in the objective function used to determine Q. We obtain 
C = dv + ^(hQ+rv) 
+ ^A 
fore<eo, 
(4-8) 
C = dv' + ^(ho+rv') 
+ ^A 
forg>eo- 
(4-9) 
Figure 4.3 illustrates the resulting cost function. 
We shall use two steps to get the optimal solution: 
1. First we consider (4.9) without the constraint Q > QQ. We obtain 
and 
C = ^2Ad{hQ+rv')+dv\ 
(4.11) 
Note now that since v' < v, (4.9) provides a lower bound for (4.8) with Q 
< go. Therefore if g ' > go, (4.10) and (4.11) give the optimal solution, 
i.e., e* = 2 ; and C* = C'. 
2. If Q< Qo as in Figure 4.3 we need to optimize the cost function (4.8) 
Q" = ] - ^ . 
(4.12) 
and 
C' = pAd(h^ + rv)+dv. 
(4.13) 

 
58 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Since v > v' we know that Qis 
smaller than g ' so we have 
Q'<Q< 
go- Clearly, (4.12) and (4.13) provide the lowest possible cost without a 
discount. Because of the convexity of (4.9) and that Q'< go, we know 
that the lowest cost with a discount is 
(4.14) 
The optimal solution in this case is consequently obtained as the 
minimum of (4.13) and (4.14).

Example 4.2 Assume that v = $100 and v' = $95 for g > go =100. Further-
more ho = $5 per unit and year, and r = 0.2, i.e., h = $25 and h '= $24 per unit 
and year. The constant demand is d = 300 per year, and the setup cost A = 
$200. 
In the first step we get Q'= 70.71 and C'= 30197 from (4.10) and (4.11). 
Since Q'< QQ we need to go to the second step. From (4.12) and (4.13) we 
get Q" = 69.28 and C" = 31732. Applying (4.14) we obtain C(100) = 
30300. Consequently g* = go = 100 is the optimal order quantity.

4.4 Backorders allowed 
So far we have assumed that backorders are not allowed. Backorders can 
make sense in a deterministic model, though. Therefore we shall now allow 
backorders and introduce a certain penalty cost proportional to the waiting 
time for the customer. 
bi = shortage penalty cost per unit and time unit. 
Otherwise the assumptions are exactly the same as when we derived the 
classical economic order quantity in Section 4.1.1. 
The backorder penalty costs per time unit are Z?i times the average num-
ber of backorders, since each unit backordered during one time unit means 
that some customer is waiting during that same time. Recall that the inven-
tory level is the stock on hand minus backorders. The backorder cost consid-
ered has a structure that is very similar to the holding cost. The only differ-
ence is that the backorder cost is charged when the inventory level is nega-
tive and the holding cost when it is positive. Note that we can similarly in-
terpret the holding cost /z as a penalty cost per unit and time unit for units 
waiting to be demanded. Each unit on hand is waiting for its demand to oc-
cur. So the total of such penalty costs (holding costs) per unit of time are 
obtained as h times the average inventory on hand. (There are other types of 
shortage costs, as will be discussed in Section 5.5.) 
Note also that because the average number of backorders equals the aver-
age customer waiting time per unit of time, the average number of backor-
ders divided by the demand d is the average waiting time per unit demanded. 
This relationship is valid in much more general stochastic settings and is 
then denoted Little's formula. See also Section 10.2. Similarly, the average 
inventory on hand divided by d is the average waiting time for a unit to be 
demanded. 
Allowing backorders means that some units are delivered in stock after 
they have been demanded. Let us define 
X = fraction of demand that is backordered. 
This means that when a batch Q is delivered the fraction x of the batch is 
used to cover backorders that have occurred before the batch was delivered. 
We wish to optimize both x and Q, The development of the inventory level is 
very similar to that in Figure 4.1. See Figure 4.4.

The costs are now obtained as

(4.15) 
In (4.15) we use that the ratio of time with positive stock is {\-x) and with 
backorders x. When the inventory level is positive, the average stock on 
hand is g(l-x)/2, but when the inventory level is negative, the stock on hand 
is zero. So we obtain the average stock on hand as {\-x)Q{\-x)l2 + x 0 = 
Q{l-x)^/2. In complete analogy the average number of backorders is Qx^/2. 
The cost is convex in x, and it is easy to see that the optimal x is inde-
pendent of Q. By setting the derivative equal to zero we obtain

(4.19) 
Note that the batch quantity (4.18) is larger and the optimal costs (4.19) are 
lower than the corresponding batch quantity and costs for the classical eco-
nomic order quantity model (4.3) and (4.4). The costs are lower because we 
have more flexibility when allowing backorders. We get the cost function 
(4.1) if we force x to be zero. 
It is easy to check that (4.5) is still valid. Note also that the solution will 
approach that of the classical economic lot size problem as fe^ -> oo. 
Example 4.3 Consider the same data as in Example 4.1 with the additional 
assumption that backorders are allowed with a backorder cost 6i == $100 per 
unit and year. The constant demand is J = 300 units per year. The ordering 
cost is ^ = $200 and the holding cost h = $20 per unit and year. Applying 
(4.16) we get x = 20/120 = 1/6 and from (4.18) we get the optimal batch 
quantity g* = (2 â¢ 200 â¢ 300 â¢ 120/2000)^^^ = 84.85 units. 
4.5 Time-varying demand 
So far we have only considered constant demand. Time-varying demand is 
quite common, though. The variations can depend on different reasons. For 
example, an item may be used as a component when producing some prod-
uct that is only produced on certain known occasions. Another possibility is 
production on a contract, which requires that certain quantities are delivered 
on specified dates. There can also be known seasonal variations in demand. 
Note that we are still considering deterministic demand, i.e., all variations 
are known in advance. We can therefore still disregard the lead-time. 
When dealing with lot sizing for time-varying demand, it is generally as-
sumed that there are a finite number of discrete time steps, or periods. A pe-
riod may be, for example, one day or a week. We know the demand in each 
period, and for simplicity, it is assumed that the period demand takes place at 
the beginning of the period. There is no initial stock. When delivering a 
batch, the whole batch is delivered at the same time. The holding cost and 

 
62 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
the ordering cost are constant over time. No backorders are allowed. We 
shall use the following notation: 
T = number of periods, 
di = demand in period /, / = 1, 2, ..., T, (it is assumed that di > 0, since 
otherwise we can just disregard period 1), 
A = ordering cost, 
h = holding cost per unit and time unit. 
We wish to choose batch quantities so that the sum of the ordering and 
holding costs is minimized. The problem considered is usually denoted the 
classical dynamic lot size problem. Since the demand is varying over time, 
we can no longer expect the optimal lot sizes to be constant. 
Example 4.4 Let T= 4, d^ = 10, J2 = 20, d^ = 10, J4 = 30,h = 2, and^ - 150. 
Consider the batch that should be delivered at the beginning of period 1. 
(Note that we always need a delivery in period 1.) It is important to realize 
that only a few values of the batch size are possible in an optimal solution. 
For example, a first batch size of 35 units can be disregarded. This batch size 
would cover the first two periods and half of the demand in period 3. But 
since a new batch is needed anyway in period 3, it would thus be advanta-
geous to add 5 units to the second batch and reduce the first batch to 30. By 
doing so we can reduce the stock in periods 1 and 2 by 5 units, and this 
means, of course, lower holding costs. We can conclude that a batch should 
always cover the demand in an integer number of periods. Consequently, the 
first batch can only be 10, 30, 40, or 70. But in this example we can also rule 
out batch size 70, since this batch size implies that the demand in period 4 is 
stocked during periods 1 - 3 , incurring the holding costs 3'2-30 = 180. This 
means that it is cheaper to cover the demand in period 4 by a separate deliv-
ery that will incur the ordering cost 150 but eliminate the considered holding 
costs. 
Let us summarize the conclusions from Example 4.4 as two properties of the 
optimal solution: 
Property 1 A replenishment must always cover the demand in an integer 
number of consecutive periods. 
Property 2 The holding costs for a period demand should never exceed the 
ordering cost. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
63 
Property 1 is often denoted the zero-inventory property, meaning that a 
dehvery should only take place when the inventory is zero. It can be shown 
that Property 1 is valid in a more general setting, see e.g., Problem 4.15. A 
consequence of Property 1 is that the optimal solution has a relatively simple 
structure. 
We will only deal with the case when backorders are not allowed. It is 
also common to consider a more general version of the problem with back-
orders. 
4.6 The Wagner-Whitin algorithm 
The dynamic lot size problem described in Section 4.5 is relatively easy to 
solve exactly. The most common approach is to use Dynamic Programming. 
This was first suggested by Wagner and Whitin (1958) and their solution is 
usually denoted the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. 
Let us introduce the following notation: 
fic = minimum costs over periods 1, 2, ..., k, i.e., when we disregard 
periods A: + 1, A: + 2, ..., T, 
fkj = minimum costs over periods 1, 2, ..., k, given that the last delivery 
is in period t{\<t 
<k). 
Note first that 
/ , = m m / , , , 
(4.20) 
\<t<k 
since the last delivery must occur in some period in the optimal solution. It is 
also obvious that/o = 0 and that/i =/i,i = A. This is so because with just one 
period we get a setup cost but no holding costs. Recall that the period de-
mand is assumed to occur at the beginning of a period. 
Assume now that we know/J.i for some / > 0. It is then easy to obtainy^^^ 
for A: > / as 
4 , =f,_^+A + h{d,^^+2d,^^+,.,^{k-t)dk), 
(4.21) 
Because we have a delivery in period t, the minimum costs for periods 1, 2, 
..., t - 1 must be/J.i. The cost in period t is the setup cost A. Recall again that 
the demands are assumed to take place at the beginning of the periods. This 
means that J/will not cause any holding costs. The demand in period t + 1 

 
64 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
incurs the holding costs hdt^\ since the quantity dt+\ is kept in stock during 
period t. The demand in period / + 2 is similarly kept in stock during two 
periods, t and / + 1, and incurs the holding costs Ihdt+i, etc. 
Assume now that we know/i,^, -", fk-u i-e., that we have solved the 
problem for 1, 2, ..., k - \ periods. We can then determine/t,/ for 1 <t <k 
from (4.21). Next we apply (4.20) to get^ and the problem is also solved for 
k periods. After that we are ready to use the same procedure for A: + 1 peri-
ods, etc. From Property 2 in Section 4.5 we know that if h(j - t)dj > ^ we do 
not need to determine^^^ for k>j when applying (4.21). Furthermore, it is 
obvious that we only need to consider k<T. 
After going through all T periods we obtain the optimal solution as fol-
lows. First we consider (4.20) for k = T. The minimum value is the optimal 
cost, and the minimizing t is the period with the last delivery. Denote the 
minimizing ^ by /'. Since the last delivery is in period t\ the solution for pe-
riods 1, 2, ..., T- 1 must also be optimal. So we can again consider (4.20) for 
k = t'- 1. The optimal last delivery for this problem, say /", is the second last 
delivery for the total problem. Next we consider (4.20) for A: = /"- 1, and we 
continue in this way until the minimizing t equals one, since we have then 
obtained all periods with deliveries. 
We shall illustrate the computations with an example. 
Example 4.5 The demands in r = 10 periods are given in the first two rows 
of Table 4.1. The ordering cost is ^4 = $300 and the holding cost h = %\ per 
unit and period. 
Li Table 4.1 we start by setting/i,i = 300. Next we use (4.21) to deter-
mine/2J =/i,i + 1- 60 = 360,/3,i =/2,i + 2 â¢ 90 = 540, etc. When we come to 
/6j we note that the holding cost associated with the demand in period 6 is 
500 > A = 300 and the column is therefore complete due to Property 2. It is 
clear that/i =/i,i = 300. Applying (4.21) we obtain^,25/3,2, etc. After com-
pleting this column we apply (4.20) to get^ = min [fi^ufi^i] "^ niin {360, 
600} =360. Note that these two numbers are in the underlined diagonal in 
Table 4.1. After completing the next column we have to optimize over the 
next diagonal to the right to get/3 = min{540, 690, 660} = 540. We continue 
in this way until the table is complete. We get the minimum costs /lo = 
mm{1550, 1630, 1570, 1550, 1770} = 1550 by applying (4.20). It is obvious 
that the minimum costs are obtained both for T = 9 and r= 6. Let us first 
consider the solution with /'= 9. Since the last delivery is in period 9, the 
problem over 8 periods must also be solved optimally. By looking in the cor-
responding diagonal we get r'= 6. Next we consider the five period prob-
lem and obtain r " = 3. Finally we get V'- 
1 and the solution is complete. It 
is easy to verify that the other optimal solution with r= 6 simply means that

The Wagner-Whitin algorithm was generalized to the backlogging case 
byZangwill(1966). 
Consider Table 4.1. There are T columns. Furthermore, there may also 
be as much as T cells in a column. This means that the computational com-
plexity is 0(7^), i.e., the computation time may be proportional to T^. Re-
cent more efficient methods for solving the dynamic lot size problem are 
given in Federgruen and Tzur (1991, 1994, 1995) and Wagelmans et al. 
(1992). The computational complexity of these techniques is 0(TLog(T)). 
In practice it is very common to consider dynamic lot size problems in a 
rolling horizon environment. In each period we want to determine the lot 
sizes in the first period. The real horizon is infinite but we consider a finite 
horizon as an approximation. The question then arises whether it is possible 
to replace an infinite horizon by a sufficiently long finite horizon, such that 
we still get the optimal solution in the first period. Several such planning ho-
rizon results have been derived. See e.g., Wagner and Whitin (1958), Kun-
reuther and Morton (1973), Lundin and Morton (1975), and Federgruen and 
Tzur (1994, 1995). Such planning horizons are generally quite long, though. 
It may even happen that no planning horizon exists. The following example 
from Bhaskaran and Sethi (1988) illustrates this. See also Section 4.9. 

 
66 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Example 4.6 The demands over an infinite horizon are given as di =" 5, d2 = 
4, ds = 5, d4 = 4, and di = 5, for / > 5. Furthermore, A = 1 and h = 0.05. Let T 
be a considered finite horizon. It can be shown that the optimal initial batch 
varies as follows: for T^ 3, 6, 9, 12, .... it is 14, for T= 4, 7, 10, 13, ... it is 
18, and for T= 5, 8, 11, 14, .... it is 9. So if we increase or decrease the hori-
zon Thy one time unit the initial batch is changing. 
4.7 The Silver-Meal heuristic 
Although the Wagner-Whitin algorithm and other exact methods are in most 
circumstances computationally feasible, in practice it is much more common 
to use simple heuristics to obtain an approximate solution. One of the best 
and most well-known methods is the Silver-Meal heuristic (Silver and Meal, 
1973). 
The Silver-Meal heuristic is, like most other lot sizing heuristics, a se-
quential method. When determining the delivery in period 1 we consider 
successively the demands in periods 2, 3, .... (Recall that we know that the 
delivery batch in period 1 must at least cover the demand in period 1). When 
considering period 2 we use a simple test to decide whether this period de-
mand should be added to the delivery batch in the first period. If this is the 
case we continue with period 3, etc. Assume that this procedure shows that 
the next delivery will come in period k. The procedure is then repeated with 
period k as the "first period". 
The idea of the Silver-Meal heuristic is to choose to have a new delivery 
when the average per period costs increase for the first time. This means that 
the first delivery shall cover n periods and the next delivery take place in pe-
riod n+ I if

Example 4.7 We consider the same problem as in Example 4.5, i.e., A = 
$300 and h = $\ per unit and period. The demands are given in Table 4.3.

If the delivery in period 1 covers only the demand in period 1 the cost for 
this period is the ordering cost ^ = 300. We now successively consider the 
per period costs for deliveries that cover 2, 3,... periods. 
2 periods 
(300 + 60)/2 = 180 < 300, 
3 periods 
(300 + 60 + 2 â¢ 90)/3 = 180 < 180, 
4 periods 
(300 + 60 + 2 â¢ 90 + 3 â¢ 70)/4 - 187.5 > 180, which 
means a new delivery in period 4. 
The same procedure is now applied with period 4 as the first period. 
2 periods 
(300 + 30)/2 = 165 < 300, 
3 periods 
(300 + 30 + 2 â¢ 100)/3 = 176.67 > 165, which means a 
new delivery in period 6. 
Starting with period 6 as the first period we obtain 
2 periods 
(300 + 60)/2 = 180 < 300, 
3 periods 
(300 + 60 + 2 â¢ 40)/3 = 146.67 < 180, 
4 periods 
(300 + 60 + 2 â¢ 40 + 3 â¢ 80)/4 = 170 > 146.67, which 
means a new delivery in period 9. 
Starting with period 9 as the first period we obtain 
2 periods 
(300 + 20)/2 = 160 < 300. 
The corresponding solution is given in Table 4.4.

The total costs are obtained as C = 3 â¢ 180 + 2 â¢ 165 + 3 â¢ 146.67 + 2 â¢ 160 = 
1630 (3 periods with average period cost 180, 2 periods with average period 
cost 165, etc.). This is about 5% higher than the optimal costs obtained by 
the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. Note that in this case we are very close to ob-
taining the optimal solution. If, for example, the demand in period 3 had 
been 91 instead of 90, the heuristic would have suggested a delivery in pe-
riod 3 and we would have obtained the optimal solution. 
In most situations the cost increase is only about 1 - 2%, see e.g., Baker 
(1989). Still it has been demonstrated that the relative error can be arbitrarily 
large, see Axsater (1982, 1985). It is straightforward to extend the logic of 
the procedure to more general problems, e.g., to include discounts. 
When using the Silver-Meal heuristic we consider the costs per period. 
An alternative is to consider the costs per unit. This means that we are di-
viding by the total number of units instead of the number of periods in our 
comparisons. This alternative procedure is denoted the Least Unit Cost heu-
ristic. It has been shown that the Silver-Meal heuristic, in general, outper-
forms the Least Unit Cost heuristic (Baker, 1989). 
4.8 A heuristic tliat balances holding and ordering 
costs 
When we derived the classical economic order quantity formula in Section 
4.1.1 it turned out that in the optimal solution, holding costs and ordering 
costs are exactly equal. This is no longer true for the dynamic lot size prob-
lem, but it is reasonable to expect that holding and ordering costs are of 
about the same size. This is the basis for the following algorithm, which is a 
simplified version of a technique suggested by De Matteis and Mendoza 
(1968). 
Let the first delivery quantity cover n periods, where n is determined by 
the condition 
hf^U-'^)dj<A<hYU-l)dj , 
(4.24) 
7=2 
J=2 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
69 
i.e., we choose to have a new dehvery as soon as the holding costs exceed 
the ordering cost. As with the Silver-Meal heuristic, the next batch is deter-
mined in the same way with period /z + 1 regarded as the first period. 
In general this heuristic does not perform as well as the Silver-Meal heu-
ristic. The relative error cannot be arbitrarily large, though. It is bounded by 
100 percent, see Axsater (1982, 1985). 
Example 4.8 We consider again the same problem setting as in Examples 4.5 
and 4.7, i.e., A = $300 and ^ = $1 per unit and period. The demands are 
given in Table 4.3. 
Starting with period 2 we compare the accumulated holding costs to the 
ordering cost. 
2 periods 
60 < 300, 
3 periods 
60 + 2 â¢ 90 = 240 < 300, 
4 periods 
60 + 2 â¢ 90 + 3 â¢ 70 - 450 > 300, which means a new 
delivery in period 4. 
The same procedure is now applied with period 4 as the first period. 
2 periods 
30 < 300, 
3 periods 
30 + 2 â¢ 100 = 230 < 300, 
4 periods 
30 + 2 â¢ 100 + 3 â¢ 60 = 410 > 300, which means a new 
delivery in period 7. 
Starting with period 7 as the first period we obtain 
2 periods 
40 < 300, 
3 periods 
40 + 2 â¢ 80 = 200 < 300, 
4 periods 
40 + 2 â¢ 80 + 3 â¢ 20 = 260 < 300. 
The solution is given in Table 4.5. It is easy to verify that we get the same 
costs as with the Silver-Meal heuristic, i.e., 1630. Of course, this might not 
always be the case.

Other lot sizing heuristics are suggested in e.g., Groff (1979) and Axsater 
(1980). 
4.9 Exact or approximate solution 
We have considered three methods for solving the classical dynamic lot size 
problem. The Wagner-Whitin algorithm gives the optimal solution while the 
other techniques are approximate. An exact solution is by no means compu-
tationally infeasible. Still it is much more common in practice to use an ap-
proximate method. One reason is that the approximate methods are easy to 
understand. It is also easy to check the computations manually. However, 
there is also another, probably even more important reason. As we have dis-
cussed in Section 4.6, the considered lot sizing techniques are usually ap-
plied in a rolling horizon environment. In each period we want to determine 
lot sizes for the first period. The real infinite horizon is then replaced by a fi-
nite horizon. If this finite horizon were sufficiently long we would often still 
get the optimal solution for the first period. But in practice it is common to 
use a relatively short horizon. This means that the solution is also approxi-
mate when using an exact method like the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. The 
approximate methods are, in general, not similarly sensitive with respect to 
the length of the horizon. In such situations a good approximate method may 
therefore even outperform an exact method (see Blackburn and Millen, 
1980).

5 SINGLE-ECHELON SYSTEMS: 
REORDER POINTS 
5.1 Discrete stochastic demand 
We shall now consider different techniques for determining reorder points, 
or equivalently safety stocks, when the demand is stochastic. To do this we 
first of all need a suitable demand model. In practice the demand during a 
certain time is nearly always a nonnegative integer, i.e., it is a discrete sto-
chastic variable. (Exceptions may occur when we deal with products like 
oil.) Provided that the demand is reasonably low, it is then natural to use a 
discrete demand model, which resembles the real demand. However, if the 
demand is relatively large, it is more practical to use a continuous demand 
model as an approximation. See Section 5.2. 
5.1.1 Compound Poisson demand 
A common assumption in stochastic inventory models is that the cumulative 
demand can be modeled by a nondecreasing stochastic process with station-
ary and mutually independent increments. Such a process may always be 
represented as a limit of an appropriate sequence of compound Poisson proc-
esses. See, for example. Feller (1966). We shall therefore often make the as-
sumption that the demand is a compound Poisson process. This means that 
the customers arrive according to a Poisson process with given intensity A. 
The size of a customer demand is also a stochastic variable. 
In a small time interval At the probability for exactly one customer is AAt, 
while the probability for more than one customer can be disregarded, or in 

 
78 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
other words it is o{At). The number of customers in a time interval of length 
t then has a Poisson distribution and the probability for k customers is 
P(k) = ^ e - ' ' , 
k = 0,l,2,.... 
(5.1) 
ki 
Both the average and the variance of the number of customers are equal to 
At. 
Compound Poisson demand means that the size of a customer demand is 
also a stochastic variable that is independent of other customer demands and 
of the distribution of the customer arrivals. The distribution of the demand 
size is denoted the compounding distribution. It is convenient to assume that 
each customer demands an integral number of units. Let 
^ 
= 
probability of demand sizey (j = 1, 2, ...). 
If/i = 1, the demand process degenerates to pure Poisson demand. The 
demand is then equal to the number of customers and the demand distribu-
tion is given by (5.1). 
Let us now consider the general case where the demand sizes are varying. 
Note that we assume that there are no demands of size zero. This is no lack 
of generality. Iffo > 0, we can replace the demand process by an equivalent 
process characterized by /I' and^' where A' = A(7 -/o),/o'= 0, and^' ^J^/(l 
- fo) for J > 0. We shall also assume that not all demands are muhiples of 
some integer larger than one. This is, for example, always the case when/i > 
0. Assume that this condition is not satisfied and that the demand size is, for 
example, always a multiple of 5. It is then natural to switch to a new unit that 
consists of 5 old units. With the new unit the condition is satisfied. 
Let 
fj 
= probability that k customers give the total demandj, 
D(t) = stochastic demand in the time interval t. 
We can determine the distribution of D(t) as follows. Note first that fo =1. 
and 
fj=fj.

Using (5.1) we then have

P(D(t) = J)=^j:^e-^ff. 
(5.3) 
Let us now determine the average and the standard deviation of the de-
mand during one unit of time. 
ju = average demand per unit of time, 
(7 = standard deviation of the demand per unit of time. 
Consider one time unit. Let K be the stochastic number of customers during 
this time unit, J the stochastic demand size of a single customer, and Z the 
stochastic demand during the time unit considered. Recall that E{K) = 
Var{K) = A, and that K and J are independent. For a given K, Zis simply the 
sum of AT independent customer demands and we have 
JU = E{Z) = E{E{Z\K))

(5.6) 
Equations (5.4) and (5.6) give the mean and standard deviation of the de-
mand during one unit of time. Let ju' and a^ be the mean and standard de-
viation of the demand during the time t. We then simply have ju^ = jut and 
(af = a^t. 
From (5.4) and (5.6) we note that a^/ju = E(jyE(J) 
> 1 with equality 
only for pure Poisson demand. Consequently, it is not possible to model de-
mand processes with d^//u < 1 as compound Poisson demand. 
We shall use the compound Poisson process when deriving various theo-
retical results. For items with relatively low demand, it may also be advanta-
geous to use this demand model in practice. An advantage with compound 
Poisson demand is that it is easy to represent the demand in a simulation 
model. 
hi connection with inventory control we usually need the distribution of 
the demand over a certain time / (e.g., the lead-time). In general we have es-
timates of//' and cr' from the forecasting system (see Chapter 2). The stan-
dard procedure is then to fit the selected demand model to these two pa-
rameters. 
5.1.2 Logarithmic compounding distribution 
Let us first assume that the demand size has a logarithmic distribution. This 
means that 
fj=-, 
,f 
. . 
J = 1,2,3,... 
(5.7) 
ln(l - a)] 
where 0 < Â« < 1 . This distribution has the following mean and variance 
(1 - a) ln(l - a) 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
81 
(l-Â«)^(ln(l-Â«))^ 
Note that this gives 
E{J^) = Var{J) + {E{J)f= 
-^ 
. 
(5.10) 
(l-Q;)Mn(l-a) 
When a -> 0 the demand size / will approach constant unit demand, i.e., 
/, -> 1 and all other fj^O. When a -> 1 Var(J)/E(J) 
-> 00. 
Let now //' and a' be given. From (5.4) and (5.8) we get 
M' = AtEiJ) = ~- 
~ 
- , 
(5.11) 
(1 - a) ln(l - a) 
and from (5.6) and (5.10) 
{ay=AtE(J') 
= 
~ 
. 
(5.12) 
(l-Â«)Mn(l-a) 
It follows immediately from (5.11) and (5.12) that, for given //' and a\ we 
can determine a and A as 
" - ' - ^ - ' - ^ ' 
(5.0, 
^_^,(l-.)ln(l-a)_^^(l^a)l.(l-a) 
^^ ,^, 
ta 
a 
Using (5.2) and (5.3) we can then determine the distribution of the de-
mand D(t) during the time /. However, when the compounding distribution is 
logarithmic there is a much simpler way. It is possible to show that in this 
case D(t) has a negative binomial distribution, i.e., PiD(t) = 0) = (I - p ) \ 
and 
pm)-kW^'''^-i''~'\i-pyp',

where the parameter r can be any positive number and 0 < /? < 1. In the spe-
cial case when r is an integer, we can interpret the distribution as the sum of 
r independent random variables each having a geometric distribution (see 
below). The negative binomial distribution has E(D(t)) = rp/{\ - p) and 
Var(D(t)) = rp/(l -pf. So given //' and a\ we can directly determine/? and 
r as 
p^\â^^a, 
(5.16) 
(o-')2 
r^^'^^^^. 
(5.17) 
It is then easy to apply (5.15). 
5.1.3 Geometric compounding distribution 
Assume now that the compounding distribution is instead a delayed geomet-
ric distribution, i.e., 
fj={\-/i)/i''-\ 
j = l,2X.. 
(5.18) 
where 0< j3<l. The resulting process is sometimes denoted a stuttering 
Poisson process. The geometric distribution has the following mean and 
variance 
E(J)=j^,

Var{J) = â ^ .

/l = Ml-y9). 
(5.22) 
Finally we can apply (5.2) and (5.3) to get the distribution of the demand 
over the time t. It is, in general, easier to use a logarithmic compounding 
distribution and apply (5.15)-(5.17). 
Example 5.1 Assume that //' = 5, {cr^' =15 and that the considered time is / 
= 20. Let us first use a logarithmic compounding distribution. Using (5.16) 
and (5.17) we get j? = 0.667 and r = 2.5. The corresponding distribution of 
the demand during t is then easily obtained from (5.15). See Figure 5.1. We 
can also determine a = p = 0.667, and X^ 0.137 from (5.14). The average 
demand size is E{J) = 1.82 from (5.8). 
Consider now instead a geometric compounding distribution. Using 
(5.21) and (5.22) we get p = 0.5 and Z = 0.125. The average demand size is 
E{J) = 2 from (5.19). Finally we apply (5.2) and (5.3) to get the distribution 
of the demand during t, see Figure 5.1. 
It is obvious that the two obtained distributions are very similar. In prac-
tice the shape of the distribution is normally unknown. Furthermore, //' and 
(j^ are uncertain estimates. Given this, it seems better to use a logarithmic 
compounding distribution to simplify the computations.

5.1.4 Smooth demand 
If we use compound Poisson demand as our demand model, the total demand 
during a certain time must have a variance-to-mean ratio larger or equal to 
one, see Section 5.1.1. In some situations we want to model a smoother de-

mand. Note, however, that this means that the cumulative demand can no 
longer be interpreted as a nondecreasing stochastic process with stationary 
and mutually independent increments. Furthermore, as long as we are deal-
ing with a discrete random variable, for a given mean there is always a lower 
bound for the possible variance. See Adan et al. (1995) for details. They sug-
gest the following technique that can be used for variance-to-mean ratios that 
are smaller than one. 
Let BIN{k, p) be a binomially distributed random variable, where the in-
teger k is the number of trials and/? is the success probability, i.e.. 
P{BIN{k,p) = j) = 
pJ{\-p)'-J. 
(5.23) 
The binomial distribution has mean kp and variance kp(l-p). 
Assume now as before that //' and cr' are given. Determine 
^a'^ 
2 
^M' 
(5.24) 
Assume also that -1 < a < 0, otherwise the considered technique cannot be 
used. Note that (cr')^ / //' < 1 imphes a<0. 
]n the special case when a = -1, use BIN{\, ju) as the demand distribu-
tion. (It can be shown that ju <\ in this case.) If a < - 1, it may also be rea-
sonable to use this distribution as an approximation. 
Otherwise determine k such that -\lk<a<ll{k 
+ \) , i.e., A:> 1. The de-
mand distribution is then obtained as the mixture of two random variables, 
BIN{k, p) with probability q and BIN{k +\, p) with probability 1- q. The 
probabilities q and/? are obtained as 
\ + a{\ + k) + ^-ak(l 
+ k)-k 
q = 
, 
(5.25) 
1 + a 
^ 
(5.26) 
k + l-q 
It can be shown that q and p are always between 0 and 1. We note that 
k^'co 
as a-^0 and this means that the computational effort will increase.

5.1.5 Fitting discrete demand distributions in practice 
In practice it is very convenient and computationally efficient to use the 
Poisson distribution (5.1), so this is a reasonable choice as long as 
(cr') ///' Â»1. A suitable decision rule is to use the Poisson distribution for 
e.g., 0.9<(a')^ / ju'<lA. 
For (a')^ / ju'> IA it is efficient to use the nega-
tive binomial distribution, or in other words, compound Poisson demand 
with a logarithmic compounding distribution, see Section 5.1.2. For 
(cr') / //' < 0.9 it is quite common to use Poisson demand, even though this 
means that the variance is overestimated, but an alternative is to use a mix-
ture of binomial distributions as described in Section 5.1.4. 
5.2 Continuous stochastic demand 
5.2.7 Normally distributed demand 
For items with higher demand, it is usually more convenient and efficient to 
model the demand over a time period by a continuous distribution. For many 
reasons it is most common to use the normal distribution. We know from the 
central limit theorem that, under very general conditions, a sum of many in-
dependent random variables will have a distribution that is approximately 
normal. In many situations the demand comes from several independent 
customers, so it reasonable to let the demand be represented by a normal 
distribution. Furthermore, if the time period considered is long enough, the 
discrete demand from a compound Poisson process will become approxi-
mately normally distributed. The normal distribution has also for a long time 
been common in practice and is easy to deal with. 
A problem with the normal distribution is that there is always at least a 
small probability for negative demand. Some results which are exact for 
compound Poisson demand are therefore only approximately true for normal 
demand. See Browne and Zipkin (1991) for a detailed discussion of various 
assumptions concerning demand distributions. 
Given the mean //' and standard deviation ex' of the demand during a time 
period t, we can always fit a unique normal distribution to these parameters. 
The so-called standardized normal distribution with mean //'= 0 and standard 
deviation a - \ has the density

Both the density and the distribution function,

e ^du^ 
(5.28) 
are tabulated in Appendix 2. For other values of //' and cr', we obtain the 
density as 
(l/cr')^((x-//')/cr') 
and the distribution function 
as 
cl)((x - /d')l a') . There is no closed form for the distribution function, but it 
is still easily available. One possibility is to use tabulated values and inter-
polation. Another alternative is to use very accurate approximations, see e.g., 
Abramowitz and Stegun (1964). 
5.2.2 Gamma distributed demand 
If the ratio cl/u' is not considerably less than 1, there is a relatively high 
probability for negative demand when using the normal distribution. Al-
though the normal distribution usually works quite well also in such cases, it 
may be more attractive to use some other distribution for which the demand 
is always nonnegative. An alternative is to use the so-called gamma distri-
bution. 
The gamma distribution has the density 
g{x) =

X > 0.

The two parameters r and A, are both positive, and T{r) is the gamma func-

(5.30) 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
87 
In the special case when r is an integer Y{r) = (r -1)!, and we get a so-called 
Erlang distribution i.e., the sum of r independent exponentially distributed 
random variables with parameter X. For any r > 1, r(r) â (r - \)Y{r â 1) . 
The gamma distribution has mean r/X and variance r/A^. Given //' and a 
it is therefore always easy to determine the corresponding unique parameters 
r and X as 
r = {^'la'f. 
(5.31) 
X = /Ll'l{C7'f. 
(5.32) 
The distribution function cannot be expressed in closed form, but is to-
gether with the density available in various software packages, e.g., in Excel. 
Example 5.2 Let //' = 25 and a = 10. From (5.31) and (5.32) we get r = 
6.25 and/I = 0.25. In Figure 5.2 gamma distributed demand is compared

Using the gamma distribution, the demand is always positive. Another 
difference is that the probabihty for very high demand is larger with the 
gamma distribution. 
Other possible continuous demand distributions are, for example, the 
lognormal distribution, the Weibull distribution, and mixtures of Erlang dis-
tributions. All these distributions can be fitted to positive random variables 
with given mean and standard deviation. See Tijms (1994) for details. 
5.3 Continuous review fR, Q) policy - inventory level 
distribution 
5.3.1 Distribution of the inventory position 
Consider now an inventory system with discrete compound Poisson demand, 
which is controlled by a continuous review {R, Q) policy. We shall derive 
some important results for such a system. Let 
IP = inventory position. 
When using an (7?, Q) policy, an order is triggered as soon as the integer IP 
is at or below the reorder point R. The order is for Q units if this is enough to 
bring IP above R. If not, the order is for the smallest number of batches 
needed to make the inventory position larger than 7?. Since an order is trig-
gered as soon as the inventory position is less than or equal to R, we always 
have IP > R+ 1. Initially the inventory position may be arbitrarily large, but 
as soon as we have ordered at least once we must have IP <R + Q. This is 
so because we always order the smallest number of batches needed to make 
/P > i? + 1. In steady state we must therefore have R + I <IP < R + Q.WQ 
shall now prove the following interesting proposition. 
Proposition 5.1 In steady state the inventory position is uniformly distrib-
uted on the integers R+l,R 
+ 2, ..., J? + g. 
Proof Recall that we assume that not all demands are multiples of some in-
teger larger than one. Therefore it is evident that, in the long run, we must 
reach all the considered inventory positions. 
Assume that the inventory position is i? + / at some time. Each time a cus-
tomer arrives, IP will jump to some other value (or possibly to the same 
value if the size of the demand is a multiple of Q). Let us denote the prob-
ability for a jump from R + i to R + j by pij. It is evident that these prob-

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
89 
abilities can be determined from the distribution of the demand size. It is 
also evident that we can see the jumps as a Markov chain. Since all states 
can be reached, the chain is irreducible. In the special case of pure Poisson 
demand the chain is periodic, otherwise ergodic. We shall consider the er-
godic case. (It is more or less directly evident that the Proposition is also true 
for Poisson demand.) Because the chain is irreducible and ergodic, it has a 
unique steady-state distribution. Consequently, we only need to prove that 
the uniform distribution is a steady-state distribution, i.e., that if the distribu-
tion is uniform at some time it is also uniform after the next (unknown) de-
mand. So we need to show that 
Q I 
I 
Z g ^ w = g ' J=h2,-,Q. 
(5.33) 
or equivalently that y^._ p^j -1 for all values ofy. When this equality is 
satisfied the chain is said to be doubly stochastic. (Recall that the equality 
2_.._ Pi J = 1 is always true for a Markov chain.) 
Let the state be / and consider a certain demand size k. Given k, the next 
state is known i.e., Pij{k) is equal to one for a certainy and zero otherwise. 
Furthermore, it is similarly evident that for a giveny,/?//^:) is one for exactly 
one value of /. If we know the new state and the demand size, we also know 
the preceding state. Consequently, V._ Pij{k) = 1. The probability/?/j can 
be expressed as the average ofpij{k) over k, i.e., Pij = EkPij(k). We now have

This completes the proof. 
When dealing with normally distributed demand, we similarly assume that 
the continuous inventory position is uniformly distributed on the interval [R, 
R + Q]. This is a very accurate approximation provided that we can disre-
gard the possibilities for negative demand.

5.3.2 An important relationship 
We shall assume that the replenishment lead-time is constant. Let us intro-
duce the notation: 
L = lead-time, 
IL = inventory level, 
D(t, t + T) =D(T) = stochastic demand in the interval (t, t + r]. 
Consider an arbitrary time t when the system is in steady state. Let IP{i) be 
the inventory position at that time. Consider then the time t + L. At that time 
everything that was on order at time t has been delivered. Orders that have 
been triggered in the interval {t, / + Z] have not reached the inventory due to 
the lead-time. Consequently we have the simple relationship 
IL{t + L)= IP{t) - D(t, t + Z). 
(5.35) 
The demand after t is obviously independent of the inventory position at 
time t. Furthermore, we know from Proposition 5.1 that the distribution of 
IP{t) is uniform. We can therefore relatively easily determine the distribution 
of the inventory level at time t + L. Since t is an arbitrary time this is also the 
case for / + Z. Consequently we obtain the steady-state distribution. 
5.3.3 Compound Poisson demand 
For discrete compound Poisson demand we have from (5.35) 
P(IL^j) 
= ~ 
^ 
P{D{L) = k-j) 
j<R + Q. 
(5.36) 
y k=max{R+l,J} 
where we condition on the inventory position and use the fact that the inven-
tory level at time t + L can never exceed the inventory position at time t, i.e., 
k>j. 
It is interesting to note that if we have determined these probabilities for 
one value of R, for example 7? = 0, we can obtain the probabilities for other 
values of i? by a simple conversion. Although this is intuitively clear, we 
show this formally. Let P(IL = j\R = r) be the probability for inventory 
levelj when R = r. We then have from (5.36)

(5.37) 
In the special case of an S policy we have R = S - I and g = 1, and the in-
ventory position is always S. This means that (5.36) can be simplified to 
P(IL = j) = P(D(L) = S-j) 
j<S, 
(5.38) 
5.3.4 Normally distributed demand 
Let us now derive the corresponding relationship for normally distributed 
demand. Recall that we assume that the continuous inventory position is uni-
formly distributed on the interval [R, R -^ Q]. Let ju^ = juL and cr' = oL^^^ de-
note the mean and the standard deviation of the lead-time demand. Further-
more, \ctf{x) and F(x) denote the density and the distribution function of the 
inventory level in steady state. In analogy with (5.36) we then have 
F{x) = PiIL<x) = -- 
j 
Q R 
l - O ^ u-x- 
ju'^ du. 
(5.39) 
Given the inventory position u at time t, the inventory level at time t + Lis 
less or equal to x if the lead-time demand is at least u-x, see (5.35). 
We shall now introduce the loss function G(x), tabulated in Appendix 2 
and defined as 
G(x) = j(v - x)(p(v)dv = (p{x) - x(l - cD(x)). 
(5.40)

G\x)=^(x)-l,

When 2 â> 0 this means simply that we are applying an S policy with S = R, 
i.e., the inventory position is kept at R all the time. The distribution of the in-
ventory level is then normally distributed. This is also easy to see from 
(5.35). 
Example 5.3 Consider pure Poisson demand with A = 2. Let the lead-time L 
= 5 and consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy with i? = 9 and Q = 5. 
The lead-time demand is obviously Poisson distributed with mean 10. Ap-
plying (5.36) we obtain

It is reasonable to compare P{IL =j) in the Poisson case by F(j + 0.5) -
F(J - 0.5), i.e., to the probability that the continuous inventory level is be-
tween j - 0.5 and7 + 0.5. For7 = 1 we obtain the probability of an inventory 
level 0.5 < /L < 1.5 as F(1.5) - F(0.5) = 0.113. hi Figure 5.4 the distributions 
are compared for other values of7. We can see that the normal distribution 
provides a very accurate approximation. 
In case of continuous demand and continuous review, an order is trig-
gered exactly when the inventory position reaches the reorder point R. The

order will arrive L time units later. The average stock on hand just before the 
order arrives is denoted the safety stock, SS, and is obtained as 
SS = 
R-M\ 
(5.46) 
The safety stock can be interpreted as an additional stock that is used as 
protection against demand variations. Note that we can replace (5.42) by the

5.4 Service levels 
When determining a suitable reorder point, or safety stock, we can base the 
reorder point either on a prescribed service constraint or on a certain short-
age or backorder cost. In practice it is often regarded to be easier to specify a 
service level. 
We shall consider three service level definitions: 
Si = probability of no stockout per order cycle, 
^2 = "fill rate"- fraction of demand that can be satisfied immediately 
from stock on hand. 
S3 = "ready rate"- fraction of time with positive stock on hand. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
95 
The first definition can be seen as the probability that an order arrives in 
time, i.e., before the stock on hand is finished. This service definition is very 
easy to use, but it also has some important disadvantages. The problem is 
that Si does not take the batch size into account. If the batch size is large and 
covers the demand during a long time, it does not matter much if Si is low. 
Most of the time there is still plenty of stock on hand due to the large batch 
size. If the batch quantity is small, the "real" service can similarly be very 
low even if Si is high. As a consequence Si cannot be recommended for in-
ventory control in practice. It is considered in this book because it is still 
used in many practical applications. 
The fill rate and the ready rate make the determination of the corre-
sponding reorder points a bit more complex, but on the other hand, will give 
a much better picture of the customer service. In case of continuous demand 
or Poisson demand, ^2 and S^ are equivalent. This is not the case, though, if a 
customer may order several units at the same time. Even if the stock on hand 
is positive, the stock may not be sufficient to cover a large customer order. If 
the stock contains a small number of units on hand most of the time, the 
ready rate can be high. Still the fill rate may be very low if there are some 
large customers who order huge quantities. 
Service measures can also be defined in many other ways. For example, it 
is not necessary to define service by a probability. In some situations it can 
be more adequate to require that the average customer waiting time does not 
exceed a certain number of days. 
From a practical point of view it is usually most important that the ser-
vice level is clearly defined and interpreted in the same way throughout the 
company. It is obviously an advantage if it is possible to follow up the real 
customer service according to the established definition. In general, it is not 
suitable to have the same service level for all different items. On the other 
hand, it may be impractical to use individual service levels for all items. A 
common solution is to group the items in some way and specify service lev-
els for each group. See also Sections 6.3 and 11.2. 
The choice of service level should be based on customer expectations, or 
in other words, the underlying shortage costs, and on the costs for giving 
good service. In case of long lead-times and large demand variations, it may 
become very expensive to maintain high service levels. 
5.5 Shortage costs 
The alternative to a service level is to use a shortage cost. We shall consider 
two types of shortage costs: 

 
96 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Z?i = shortage cost per unit and time unit, 
62 = shortage cost per unit. 
The choice of shortage cost definition should, of course, reflect the real 
costs that are incurred by shortages. 
A shortage cost of type bu for example, is relevant for a spare part when 
a shortage implies that a machine has to stop until the spare part is available 
again. The costs are then proportional to the customer waiting time. Recall 
that we have already used bi in Section 4.4 in connection with deterministic 
demand. The shortage cost b\ can also be interpreted as a cost per average 
number of backorders, as was explained in Section 4.4. 
If shortages are covered by overtime production to a higher cost, a short-
age cost of type bi may be suitable. 
One problem with shortage costs is that practitioners usually find it diffi-
cult to determine how high they should be. It is, on the other hand, an ad-
vantage that a given shortage cost makes it possible to balance shortage and 
holding costs and find the optimal customer service. 
Independent of whether we use a service level or a shortage cost, the op-
timal reorder point will increase with the service level or the shortage cost 
used. For a certain item it is, in principle, always possible to determine the 
service level which gives the same safety stock as a certain shortage cost, 
and the other way around. Such relationships between service measures and 
shortage costs will, in general, depend on data for the individual item, like its 
batch quantity, the mean and standard deviation of lead-time demand, etc. 
An interesting exception is a relationship between the service levels ^'2 and 
53 and Z>i, which we shall derive in Section 5.9.2. 
5.6 Determining the safety stock for given Si 
The service measure Si, i.e., the probability of no stockout per order cycle, is 
usually used in connection with continuous review and continuous demand 
models. This means that we order a batch Q exactly when the inventory po-
sition is R. The batch size is assumed to be given. Our problem is to deter-
mine the reorder point i?, such that there is a certain specified probability S\ 
for the lead-time demand to be lower than R. We will assume that the lead-
time demand is normally distributed with average //' and standard deviation 
a\ We obtain 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
97 
P{D(L) <R) = S^ = 0 
^ U o p ^ 1 
(5.48) 
since SS = R - ju\ For a given value of Sy we have to choose the ratio SS/a^ 
= k sufficiently large. The required ratio k (easy to determine from the table 
in Appendix 2) is often denoted the safety factor. After determining the 
safety factor we obtain the safety stock simply as 
SS^ka', 
(5.49) 
Finally we get the reorder point 2i^R = SS -^ ju\ Table 5.1 illustrates how the 
safety factor grows with service level ^i.

Note that the safety factor is increasing rapidly for large service levels. 
5.7 Fill rate and ready rate constraints 
Consider again a continuous review {R, Q) policy with a given batch quan-
tity Q. We will now see how we can determine the reorder point R to satisfy 
a given fill rate 52 or ready rate S^, 
5.7.1 Compound Poisson demand 
Consider first compound Poisson demand and recall that we have derived the 
distribution of the inventory level P(IL = j) in (5.36). The ready rate is the 
probability for positive inventory level, i.e., 
S3 =P(IL>0). 
(5.50) 
It is a little more complicated to determine the fill rate because the demand 
size can vary. Recall that^^ is the probability for demand size k. We consider 
a customer demand and get the fill rate as the ratio between the expected 
satisfied quantity and the expected total demand quantity. 

 
98

^2=^^^^^^

â¢ 
(5.51) 
If the positive demand size is k and the positive inventory level isy the deliv-
ered quantity is min (j, k). In the special case of Poisson demand, we have/i 
= 1 and the expression for S2 in (5.51) degenerates to the expression for ^3 in 
(5.50), i.e., ^2 = S3 in that case. 
It is evident that both 5*2 and ^3 will increase with the reorder point R. 
Furthermore R < - Q means that the stock is never positive, implying that 
both ^2 and S3 are zero. Consequently, for a given positive S2 (or ^'3) we 
know that we must have R > - Q. Poisson or compound Poisson demand 
models are normally only used when the demand is relatively low. There-
fore, when determining the reorder point we can simply increase R by one 
unit at a time starting from R = - Q until S2 obtained from (5.51) (or S3 from 
(5.50)) exceeds the required service level. For each value of 7? we need to re-
calculate the probabilities P(IL =j). It is then convenient to use (5.37). 
5.7.2 Normally distributed demand 
For continuous normally distributed demand, it is evident that S2 = S3 and the 
service level is the probability of positive stock, which is obtained from 
(5.42) 
S2 = 53=l-F(0) = l - ^ ^,R-M'] 
JR + Q-M' 
y. 
(5.52) 
Using G\v) = 0(v) - 1 it is easy to show that dS2/dR = dS3/dR > 0, i.e., S2 = 
S3 increases with R. For a given service level we can use a simple bisection 
search to find the smallest R giving the required service level. We start with 
a lower bound for R, e.g., R = -Q, and an upper bound R, which gives a 
service level that exceeds the required service level. Next we consider 
R = (R + R)/2. If the obtained service is too low, R can replace R, and 
otherwise it can replace R. We continue like this until the gap between R 
and R is sufficiently small. 
It is common to approximate (5.52) by

(5.53) 
From the table in Appendix 2 it is obvious that this approximation generally 
works well for large values of Q. It can be of interest to use the approxima-
tion in manual calculations, but it is not needed in a computerized inventory 
control system. Note that (5.53) underestimates the service levels. 
Example 5.4 Consider again the data in Example 5.3, i.e., pure Poisson de-
mand with A = 2, L = 5, and a continuous review (R, Q) policy with R = 9 
and Q = 5. We want to determine the fill rate S2 and the ready rate ^^3, which 
in this case are equal because we have pure Poisson demand. Applying 
(5.50) we obtain

5.8 Fill rate - a different approach 
So far our approach has been to start by deriving the distribution of the in-
ventory level from (5.35). This must be regarded as the standard technique in 
inventory theory. There is also another useful approach, which means that 
we focus instead on what happens to an individual batch after being ordered. 
To illustrate this other approach we shall once more derive the expression 
(5.52) for the fill rate, or equivalently, the ready rate. 
We are studying a continuous review (R, Q) policy and the lead-time de-
mand is assumed to be continuous and normally distributed with mean //' = 

 
100 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
juL and standard deviation a^ ^ oL^'^. We focus on a batch Q that is ordered 
when the inventory position is R. This batch will later be consumed by cus-
tomer demand. The reorder point R will cover the demand for R units after 
the ordering time. So the considered batch will be consumed by the demand 
for the Q units following after these first R units. When the batch arrives in 
stock, a part of this demand may have already occurred, i.e., there are back-
orders waiting for the batch. Let 
B = backordered quantity that will be covered by the batch. 
Note that we are only considering the backorders that are covered by the 
batch. Therefore, we must have 0 <B <Q. If the backorders exceed Q when 
the batch arrives in stock, the quantity exceeding Q is covered by future 
batches. If we know E{B) we can obtain the fill rate (and the ready rate) as 
S^ =S^ 
^\-E{B)IQ. 
(5.54) 
It remains to determine E{B). Let u be the normally distributed demand dur-
ing the lead-time. We need to consider three cases: 
u <R 
R<u 
<R + Q 
R + Q<u 
means 
5 = 0, 
means 
B = u - R, 
means 
B = Q. 
Consequently, E(B) can be determined by averaging over u

where we have used the definition of G(x) in (5.40). Combining (5.54) and 
(5.55) we obtain (5.52). 
Note that this derivation also covers the case when R is negative. This 
simply means that a part of the demand that is covered by Q has already oc-
curred when the order is triggered. 
5.9 Shortage cost per unit and time unit 
We will now instead consider a shortage (or backorder) cost bi per unit and 
time unit. (Recall that we have dealt with this backorder cost in Section 4.4.) 
As before, we consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy with given batch 
quantity Q, and we let //' and a' represent mean and standard deviation re-
spectively of the lead-time demand. The holding cost per unit and time unit 
is denoted h. We optimize the reorder point by minimizing the sum of ex-
pected holding and backorder costs. This means that we are balancing back-
order costs against holding costs. It is convenient to use the notation 
(xY 
= max(x, 0), 
(xY 
= max(-x, 0). 
Given the inventory level IL, the holding cost rate is h(ILy and the backor-
der cost rate is b\{ILy. Using x^- x~ = x, we can express the total cost rate in 
different ways 
hilLf 
+ 6| (IL~) = -b^IL + (h + b^ )(lLy = A IL + (/z + 6| )(/Z)~. 
(5.56) 
It is usually most convenient to use the second or third alternative in (5.56). 
E{ILy is the expected amount of backorders. Let ju be the average de-
mand per unit of time. Then the expected waiting time to satisfy a demand is 
E{ILyi //. This is an application of the well-known Little's formula from 
queuing theory. We can interpret E(ILy as the average queue length and ju as 
the average arrival rate to the queue. Recall the related discussion for a de-
terministic setting in Section 4.4. 
5.9.1 Compound Poisson demand 
Consider now compound Poisson demand. Recall that we have derived the 
distribution of the inventory level in (5.36). When expressing the expected 

 
102 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
costs per unit of time, C, it is in general, best to use the second alternative in 
(5.56) for discrete demand. The reason is that we only need to consider a fi-
nite number of inventory levels, because the inventory level cannot exceed 
the maximum inventory position R + Q. We get 
(9-hl 
^ ^ ^ 
C = -b,E(lL) + {h + b, )E{ILt =-b,iR + ^ 
//') + (/? + *i) X JP(IL = j \ 
(5.57) 
where E{IL) is easily obtained as the average inventory position minus the 
average lead-time demand. 
Let us now regard the cost difference when using the reorder point R+ \ 
instead of 7?. 
C{R + l)-C{R)^-b^ 
+(h + b^) 
fR+\+Q 
R+Q 
Y,jP{IL^j\R + \)-Y,jP{IL

(5.58) 
From (5.37) we know that P{IL = j \ R) = P(IL = j + l\R + \). Using this 
we have 
R+Q 
R+Q 
R+\+Q 
Y, jP{IL = j\R) = Y JP{IL = 7 + l|i? +1) = Y. ^J - ^)^(^^ = j \ ^ + ^) â¢ 
7=1 
y=i 
y=2 
(5.59) 
Inserting (5.59) in (5.58) we have 
R^i+Q 
CiR + l)-C{R) = -b^ +{h + b^) ^P{IL 
= j\R-h\) = -b^+{h + b^)S^(R + l). 
y=i 
(5.60) 
Because the ready rate increases with the reorder point, it follows that C(R + 
1) - C(R) is increasing with R, i.e., the cost is convex in the reorder point. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
103 
Since ^3 = 0 for 7? < - g it follows directly from (5.60) that we do not need to 
consider R< - Q. Consequently, to find the optimal R we can start with R = 
- Q and increase R by one unit at a time until the costs are increasing. 
It is also interesting to note from (5.60) that there is always a special re-
lationship between the cost parameters and the ready rate in the optimal so-
lution. The optimal reorder point can be characterized as the largest reorder 
point giving a ready rate not higher than b]l{h + bi). In other words, if 7? * is 
the optimal reorder point we have 
S^{R")<â^â<S^{R" 
+\). 
h + b 
(5.61) 
In case of pure Poisson demand this is also true for the fill rate. 
5.9.2 Normally distributed demand 
For continuous normally distributed demand, the relationship between the 
cost parameters and the service levels fill rate and ready rate is, as we shall 
see below, even more striking. Recall that S2 = S3 in this case. 
We start by evaluating the expected costs per unit of time. Let us now use 
the third alternative in (5.56). As before we let F{x) be the distribution func-
tion andj{x) the density of the inventory level.

In the second line of (5.62) we use (5.42), and when going from the second 
to the third line we change the order of integration. Recall that G(GO):^0. 
At this stage it is useful to define the function H{x) which is tabulated in 
Appendix 2. (In the literature it is common to use H{x) = 2H{x) instead of 
H{x)).

Since H\x) = - G(x), H(x) is decreasing and convex. Recall that G{x) is posi-
tive and decreasing. The function H{x) is illustrated in Figure 5.5.

as 
^1 =

(5.68) 
we can also go in the other direction, i.e., given a service level we can de-
termine an implicit shortage cost. The relations (5.67) and (5.68) (as well as 
(5.61)) are very useful when choosing service levels or shortage costs in 
practice. Consider, for example, a company that works with service level 
constraints because it seems difficult to determine shortage costs. Still it may 
very well be possible to evaluate whether a certain shortage cost is reason-
able or not. Using (5.68), the shortage costs corresponding to chosen service 
levels can be determined and discussed. Such discussions are often very 
fruitful when trying to improve inventory control. 
Note, however, that the considered "equivalence" between a certain fill 
rate or ready rate, and a corresponding shortage cost per unit and time unit, 
is only valid when the order quantity Q is given and the optimization only 
concerns R. It is not valid if we add ordering costs and carry out a joint op-
timization of both R and Q.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
5.10 Shortage cost per unit 
We shall now instead consider a shortage cost 62 per unit. As before, we 
consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy. The demand is assumed to be 
continuous and normally distributed. Except for the different type of short-
age cost, the model is the same as in (5.62). We assume that each unit which 
is demanded when the stock level is zero or negative incurs the cost bj. Us-
ing (5.62) and (5.42), the costs per time unit C can now be expressed as 
du 
(5.69) 
+ ^2-"-
Note that in (5.69) we are using both the average demand per time unit // and 
the average lead-time demand //'. If we use the function H{x) according to 
(5.64), we can aUematively express (5.69) as 
C = h{R + QI2-^')

It can be shown that the costs in (5.69) and (5.70), although not convex, have 
a unique local minimum. See Rosling (2002a), and Chen and Zheng (1993). 
It is common to replace the exact costs by a simpler approximate cost ex-
pression. If there are relatively few backorders we can disregard the second 
term in (5.69) and (5.70). Furthermore, if Q is relatively large we can also

disregard the second term in the last parenthesis. This gives the following 
approximate costs:

where 5*1 is the probability of no stockout per order cycle. Note that the right 
hand side of (5.73) can become negative for certain parameters. But S\ is a 
service level and cannot be negative. The reason that this can happen is our 
approximation. If this occurs in practice, we have to replace the right hand 
side in (5.73) by some given lowest service level. 
5.11 Continuous review (s, S) policy 
We shall now consider an {s, S) policy instead of an (R, Q) policy. We are 
still assuming continuous review. Recall that an (s, S) policy means that an 
order is triggered as soon as the inventory position declines to or below the 
reorder point s. The order size is chosen so that the inventory position in-
creases to S. (See Figure 3.2.) 
First of all, we note that an (s, S) policy is equivalent to an (R, Q) policy 
with s = R and g = 5* - 5 as long as we know that the inventory position is 
exactly s when the order is triggered. In case of continuous review this 
equivalence is true both for continuous demand and for pure Poisson de-
mand. It is not true, however, for compound Poisson demand with demand 
sizes larger than one. Here we will only consider such demand since we have 
already dealt with {R, Q) policies in Section 5.3. 
In Proposition 5.1 in Section 5.3 we proved that the steady-state distribu-
tion of the inventory position in case of an {R, Q) policy is uniform on the 

 
108 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
integers [R + I, R -^ Q]. With an (s, S) policy the inventory position is obvi-
ously always in the corresponding interval [^ + 1^ 5], but it is in general not 
uniformly distributed on these values. We therefore need to determine the 
distribution. 
Note first that the transitions of the inventory position IP are a renewal 
process. Each time an order is triggered and a new order cycle begins, the 
inventory position is raised to S and we have a regeneration. We shall now 
consider the number of customers and the transitions of the inventory posi-
tion between two orders (regenerations). For each customer arrival we con-
sider the inventory position just after the arrival when both the demand and a 
possible replenishment order have taken place. Let 
mj = probability to reach IP =j during an order cycle (s -^ I < j < S), 
As before,/i: is the probability of demand size k (recall that we assume that/o 
= 0). 
Obviously ms= I since we start each cycle with IP = S. No inventory po-
sition can be visited more than once during an order cycle. We can come to 
IP =j from some IP = k> j provided the next demand is k - j . When deter-
mining nij we consider all IP > j . We get 
s 
^j= 
Yj^kfk-j^ 
j = s-\-\,s 
+ 2,...,S 
-\. 
(5.74) 
From (5.74) it is easy to determine the probabilities nij recursively forj = S -
1,5-2, ... , s + 1. Note that MJ can also be interpreted as the expected num-
ber of visits to IP = j during an order cycle. Each transition of the inventory 
position is triggered by a customer. The average total number of customers 
during an order cycle is therefore > 
m ,â¢ . Since the customers arrive ac-
cording to a Poisson process, the average time between two arrivals is al-
ways the same. This means that we can obtain the steady-state distribution of 
the inventory position as 
s 
P(IP=^k) = mj^/ 2]my, 
k = sn,s 
+ 2,...,S. 
(5.75) 
Note that these probabilities only depend onS - s, i.e., if, for example, we 
increase both s and S by the same number, we get the same probabilities. 
Furthermore, if we have determined the probabilities mj foYS=s 'and S = S' 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
109 
and want to consider s = s'- 1 and S = S\ the probabilities ms+i, ... , ms- are 
unchanged and we only need to determine rus- from (5.74). 
Example 5,5 Let the probabilities for demand sizes 1 and 2 be/i =/2 = 1/2 . 
Consider an (s, S) policy with ^ = 5 and ^S = 8. We obtain mg =1 and accord-
ing to (5.74) 
TTlj = Wg /2 = l/2, 
m^ = ^7 / 2 + Wg / 2 = 3 / 4. 
The average number of customers in an order cycle is me -^ m-j + m^ = 91 A. 
We finally get the distribution of the inventory position from (5.75) as P{IP 
= 6) = 3/9, P{IP = 7) = 2/9, and P(IP = S) = 4/9. Obviously this distribution 
is far from uniform. 
After obtaining the distribution of the inventory position from (5.75) we can 
derive the distribution of the inventory level in complete analogy with 
(5.36). 
s 
P(IL = j)= 
Y.^iIP = k)P(D(L) = k-j), 
j<S. 
(5.76) 
k=max{s+l,j} 
The determination of various performance measures for a given inventory 
level distribution is straightforward and parallels essentially corresponding 
expressions for {R, Q) policies. 
5.12 Periodic review - fill rate 
Let us now consider an inventory system that is controlled by a periodic re-
view policy instead of a continuous review policy. Periodic review means 
that the inventory position is inspected at the beginning of each period and 
that all replenishments are triggered at these reviews. A period may, for ex-
ample, be a day or a week. First of all it is obvious that if the review period 
is short enough there is not much difference between periodic and continu-
ous review. In such a case, continuous review results can be used as an ap-
proximation in periodic review systems and the other way around. Quite of-
ten, though, the review period cannot be disregarded. 

 
110 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
5.12.1 Basic assumptions 
As before, we assume a constant lead-time L. Furthermore we let Tbe the re-
view period. It is common to assume that the lead-time is an integral number 
of periods, but we shall not introduce that restriction. 
It is important to understand that the assumptions regarding when in the 
period the demand takes place, and when in the period various performance 
measures are evaluated, may affect the results and the optimal policy. Let us, 
for example, consider a situation with L = 0 and no ordering costs. If all de-
mand takes place at the beginning of a period and it is possible to order im-
mediately after that, we do not need to keep any stock. We just have to order 
the period demand in each period, and because the lead-time is zero, the de-
livery will take place instantaneously. We shall assume that the demand in a 
period is spread out over the whole period as we have assumed in the previ-
ously considered continuous review models. This is the most natural as-
sumption in most applications. Evidently this means that we need some 
stock also if i = 0. 
Furthermore, we shall focus on evaluation of the fill rate. Assume, for ex-
ample, that the inventory is controlled by an (R, Q) policy and that the batch 
quantity Q is given. We can use the results in this section to find the smallest 
R that satisfies a given fill rate.

Figure 5.6 Considered time epochs. 
Consider Figure 5.6 and let t be an arbitrary review time. The orders can 
take place at times ... , t, t -^ T, ... A possible order at time t is delivered at 
time t + L. The next possible delivery time is evidently t + L -^ T. When de-
termining the fill rate we consider the interval between these two times. It is 
easy to determine the expected demand in the considered interval. Further-
more, it is clear that the demand that can be delivered from stock on hand in 
this interval depends only on the inventory level after the possible delivery at 
time t + L and the total stochastic demand in the interval. 
Note that the fill rate is also the same for most other demand assump-
tions, e.g., if the whole demand takes place just after the delivery at time t + 
L or just before the next possible delivery at time t + L + T. 
In this section we shall first deal with discrete compound Poisson demand 
both for {R, Q) policy and {s, S) policy. Thereafter we consider an (R, Q) 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POESfTS 
111 
policy and continuous normally distributed demand. We refer to Sobel 
(2004) and Tijms (1994) for more details and other assumptions. 
5.12.2 Compound Poisson demand - (R, Q) policy 
We shall first consider discrete compound Poisson demand. Recall that such 
demand models are mainly of interest in case of relatively low demand. Con-
sider again Figure 5.6. We shall first determine the distribution of the in-
ventory level at the two times t -^ L and t + L + T, i.e., the start and the end 
of the considered interval. At time ^ + Z we consider the inventory level after 
a possible delivery, but at time / + Z + T, a possible delivery has not taken 
place. 
Consider an {R, Q) policy and the transitions of the inventory position at 
the review times after a possible order. Recall that we in the continuous re-
view case instead considered the times when customer demands occurred. 
The associated Markov chains are essentially the same if we let the period 
demand here correspond to the demand per customer in the continuous re-
view case. Under some mild assumptions (see Section 5.3.1), the steady-
state distribution of the inventory position will be uniform. For a discrete 
demand distribution it is uniform on the integers [i? + 1, i? + g]. 
The inventory level IL at time t + L after a possible delivery can be ob-
tained as 
IV = IL(t + L) = IP(t) - D{L\ 
{5.11) 
because orders after time t have not been delivered at time t + L. Recall that 
we can determine the distribution of the demand over a given time according 
to (5.3), or more simply according to (5.15) in case of a logarithmic com-
pounding distribution. The distribution oiIL' can consequently be obtained 
as in (5.36), i.e., 
1 
R+Q 
P(IV = j) = ~ 
Y. 
P(D(L) = k~j) 
j<R + Q. 
(5.78) 
^ 
k=m2ix{R+\,j} 
The distribution of the inventory level IV at time ^ + Z + 7 before a possi-
ble delivery can be determined in exactly the same way. It is just to replace L 
by Z + Tin the computations. 
Consider now the interval between the two times ^ + Z and t + L -^ T. The 
expected demand during one unit of time is // = '^ZT^i Jfj -> where X is the in-

 
112 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
tensity of the customer arrivals and^ is the probabiHty of demand size7. The 
expected demand in the considered interval of length Tis obviously juT. 
Consider then the part of the demand in the considered interval between t 
+ L and t + L + T that cannot be met from stock on hand. This demand is 
backordered so it can be determined as E{IUy- E(IL y. This means that we 
can determine the fill rate as 
When determining E{IL^y and E{ILX it is usually most practical to use that 
E{ILy = E{ILY 
-E{IL), 
because IL^<R + Q is bounded. Â£(/Z') and 
E{IL") are easily obtained as i? + (g + l)/2 - /zL and i? + (g + l)/2 - //(i + 
T), respectively. Recall that the inventory position immediately after the or-
der at time / is uniform on [i? + 1, i? + 0 . 
Example 5.6. Consider pure Poisson demand with yl = 0.1, the lead-time L = 
5 and the review period T = 1.5. Furthermore, R = I and Q "= 2. We get 
E{IL'T = 0.01925 mdE{ILT 
= 0.00913. Using (5.79) we get ^'2 - 0.933. 
5.12.3 Compound Poisson demand - (s, S) policy 
We can also handle (s, S) policies essentially as in Section 5.11. Let 
gj = probability that the period demand, i.e., the demand D(T) during a 
period of length T, isy (/* == 0, 1, ...), 
rrij = average number of periods with IP =j during an order cycle. 
Recall that the period demand essentially corresponds to the demand by a 
single customer in the continuous review case. In Section 5.11 we assumed 
that the size of a customer demand is at least one unit. We shall now also 
consider the possibility of zero period demand, which requires a minor 
modification of the technique in Section 5.11 (see also Zheng and Feder-
gruen, 1991). If the period demand is zero the inventory position will not 
change. Consequently we have rus = 1/(1-go), and in analogy with (5.74)

(5.83) 
k=m20i{s-\-\,j] 
We can then apply (5.79) just as in Section 5.12.2. 
5.12.4 Normally distributed demand - (R, Q) policy 
Let us now consider an (R, Q) policy and continuous normally distributed 
demand. As before, we denote the mean and standard deviation of the de-
mand per unit of time by ju and a. Furthermore, the mean and standard de-
viation of the demand during the lead-time L are denoted //'= i//and (T'= 
L^^^a. We shall also consider the demand during the time L + J and the cor-
responding mean and standard deviation //"= (Z + T)ju and a^'= (L + T)^^^a. 
Consider again Figure 5.6. The inventory position /P just after the arbi-
trary review time t is now uniform on the continuous interval (R, R + Q]. We 
can again apply (5.77), and in complete analogy with (5.39) and (5.42) we 
obtain the inventory level distribution at time t + L after a possible delivery 
as

We then use the same approach as in Sections 5.12.2 and 5.12.3. First we 
note that the expected demand in the interval between t + L and t + L + Tis 
juT. We then evaluate the expected demand that cannot be met from stock on 
hand during this interval. This demand is backordered so it can be deter-
mined as E(IL^Y- E{IL y. We can then get the fill rate as 
^2 - 1 EjIL'y 
-Ejliy

(5.85)

We get E{IL^^ in exactly the same way. We just have to replace //' and cf 
by //'' and <j' in (5.86). 
Example 5.7. Consider a normal approximation of the data in Example 5.6. 
We get juT=0.l5, ju' - 0.5, &= 0.5^^^ = 0.707, //" = 0.65 and cr" = 0.65^^^ = 
0.806. For i? = 1 and e = 2 we get from (5.86) E{iry 
= 0.038 and E{IL y = 
0.017. Using (5.85) we get 5*2 = 0.86. Because we are dealing with very low 
demand, the size of the error is not surprising. 
5.13 The newsboy model 
Let us now consider a classical inventory problem, the so-called newsboy 
model. There is a single period with stochastic demand. We assume that it is 
normally distributed with mean ju and standard deviation a. We have to de-
termine how much to order before the period starts. There are penalty costs 
associated with ordering both too much and too little compared to the un-
known stochastic period demand. The problem is to optimize the size of the 
order. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
115 
Let 
X = stochastic period demand, 
S = ordered amount, 
Co = overage cost, i.e., the cost per unit for a remaining inventory at the 
end of the period, 
Cu = underage cost, i.e., the cost per unit for unsatisfied period demand. 
Using the original interpretation of the problem, we can think of a news-
boy who can buy copies of a newspaper for 25 cents early in the morning 
each day and sell them for 75 cents during the day. He is not paid anything 
for unsold copies. In that case we have Co = 25, and Q = 75 - 25 = 50. For a 
given demand x the costs are 
C{x)^(S-x)c^ 
x<S, 
(5.87) 
C(x) = {x-S)c^ 
x>S, 
(5.88) 
and we can express the expected costs C = E{C(x)} as

(5.91) 
It is easy to see that C is convex, so (5.91) provides the optimal solution. 
Example 5.8 Let us return to our example with Co = 25 and Q = 50. Assume 
that the daily demand for newspapers is normally distributed with mean // = 
300 and standard deviation 0"= 60. Applying (5.91) we obtain the optimal 
solution from

25 + 50 
implying that (see the table in Appendix 2)

or, equivalently, S Â« 326 copies of the newspaper. 
The same problem occurs in many other contexts. Here are a few exam-
ples. A garment retailer has to decide on the quantity of various style goods 
before the short selling season. A supermarket must decide on the quantities 
of fresh meat to buy each day. A farmer must decide on quantities of differ-
ent crops to be planted in a certain season. 
So far we have assumed that the problem concerns a single period. The 
simple newsboy solution (5.91) is, however, also common in multiperiod 
settings as in Section 5.12. Assume first that the lead-time is zero and that 
we apply an S policy at the beginning of each period. The period demand is 
normally distributed with mean // and standard deviation a. Units that are 
left over at the end of a period can be used in the next period, but we have a 
holding cost h per unit and period. Similarly, a possible shortage at the end 
of a period is backordered and can be filled in the coming period. The back-
order cost per unit and time unit is bi. The problem considered is a newsboy 
problem with Co = h, and c^ = bi. If we have a lead-time of L periods the 
problem is still a newsboy problem. We just have to consider the demand 
during L + 1 periods instead of the demand during a single period. This 
means that the mean ju and standard deviation crin (5.91) should be replaced 
by the mean //''= (Z + l)/j and standard deviation (j^= (L+iy^^cr correspon-
ding to L + 1 periods.

5.14 A model with lost sales 
In this section we leave the assumption of complete backordering and as-
sume instead that demand that cannot be met immediately is lost. Otherwise 
the model is similar to that in Section 5.10. We refer to Rosling (2002b) for a 
more complete model. 
Again we consider a continuous review (R, Q) policy. Note first that the 
inventory position can never become negative, because in a lost sales model 
there are no backorders so the inventory level cannot be negative. We must 
therefore assume that i? >0. We shall also make the standard simplifying as-
sumption that Q> R. Consequently, if one order is outstanding the inventory 
position is strictly above the reorder point and no more orders can be trig-
gered. Recall that the inventory level is nonnegative. The simplifying as-
sumption implies, therefore, that there can be at most one outstanding order. 
The demand is assumed to be continuous and normally distributed. The 
demand per time unit has mean // and standard deviation a. Consequently 
the demand during the constant lead-time Z, D{L), has mean //'= Lju and 
standard deviation (j'= (L Y^^cr. There is a holding cost per unit and time 
unit, h, and a shortage cost per unit lost, Z?2. (Note that a shortage cost per 
unit and time unit does not make sense in a lost sales model.) 
We shall also assume that hQ/2 < 62//, since otherwise it is not profitable 
to operate the system. To see this, note that a batch Q will at least incur the 
average holding costs h^/2ju corresponding to the case when there is no 
stock on hand when the batch is delivered. The batch will cover the demand 
Q. This means that we will avoid the shortage costs Qb2. The system can 
only be profitable to operate if the expected holding costs are lower than the 
avoided shortage costs. This means that we must require that hQ^/2/j < gZ?2, 
or, equivalently, hQ/2 < biju. 
Consider a complete order cycle between two deliveries of a batch. Re-
call that Q> R. Consequently, when a batch has been delivered, there is first 
a stochastic time until the reorder point is reached and the next batch is or-
dered. During this time there are no outstanding orders and the inventory 
levelIL = IP > R>0, i.e., no lost sales can occur. When the inventory level 
reaches R, a new batch is ordered. This batch is delivered after the lead-time 
L. Lost sales will occur if the stochastic lead-time demand exceeds the reor-
der point. Let us first determine the average lost sales during the order cycle, 
E(R - D(L)y. We obtain 
E(R-D(L))-= \iu-R)-^J^^--^\du^a'G\^^

INVENTORY CONTROL 
The average length of an order cycle must be (Q + E(R - D(L)y)//d, since 
all demand is either met or lost. 
The average inventory on hand just before the delivery at the beginning 
of the order cycle considered is 
E{R - D{L)t = E(R - D(L)) + E(R - D{L)y =R~ju' + CT'G(^â^) 
. 
(5.93) 
Note that the inventory on hand at the beginning of the cycle and the demand 
during the cycle are independent stochastic variables. Therefore, the average 
time in stock for an item in the batch that is delivered at the beginning of the 
order cycle can be obtained as E(R - D{L)y//u + g/(2//). (The first term is the 
expected time before the batch starts being consumed. As usual we disregard 
the occurrence of negative demand.) The corresponding holding costs are 
hQ[E{R - D{L)y + QllY/u, The total costs per time unit can consequently be 
expressed as 
hQ 
C = 
R-M'^a'G(^)^^ a

(7

(5.94) 
The costs in (5.94) can be minimized with respect to 7?. It is possible to 
show that the costs have a single local optimum. It is therefore easy to find 
the optimal solution. 
Recall that i? > 0. Furthermore, the model is only an approximation for R 
> Q. If the model is used for R> Q, the lost sales are underestimated and an 
optimization will give a reorder point R that is too low. We have assumed 
that the lead-time is constant, but independent stochastic lead-times can be 
handled in essentially the same way. 
If we compare (5.94) to the corresponding costs with complete backor-
dering, (5.69) or (5.70), we can see that the cost expressions, as expected, 
approach each other when the average lost sales during an order cycle are 
small compared to the batch quantity Q. If we disregard the term aG{{R -
//')/<T') in the first term in the numerator and in the nominator, we obtain the 
approximate cost expression (5.71) with the simple solution (5.73). This so-
lution is often a good approximation also in the lost sales case (Rosling, 
2002b).

It is also easy to evaluate the fill rate in the considered model.

In (5.95) we use the fact that the total demand in an order cycle consists of 
two parts, the demand that is satisfied from stock on hand g, and the lost 
sales 
a'GiiR-ju')/cT'). 
Other inventory models with lost sales are presented in e.g., Hadley and 
Whitin (1963), Archibald (1981), Buchanen and Love (1985), Beyer (1994), 
Johansen and Thorstenson (1996), Johansen (1997), and Johansen and Hill 
(1998). 
5.15 Stochastic lead-times 
5.15.1 Two types of stochastic lead-times 
So far we have only dealt with constant lead-times. It is quite common, 
though, that the supply process is also stochastic and we shall therefore show 
how stochastic lead-times can be incorporated in inventory models. 
We shall here describe two different types of stochastic lead-times. (Also 
other types are possible.) In Sections 5.15.2 and 5.15.3 we show how they 
can be handled, and in Section 5.15.4 we provide a numerical comparison. 
1. Sequential deliveries independent of the lead-time demand. 
By sequential deliveries we mean that orders cannot cross in time. This type 
of stochastic lead-times is most common in practice. Consider, for example, 
a situation where we order from a factory or from an external supplier, and 
assume that the orders placed with the outside supplier are delivered ac-
cording to a first-come, first-served policy. The orders can then not pass 
each other. The stochastic lead-time for a certain order may depend on the 
previous demand due to earlier orders that have caused congestion in the 
supply system, but the demand after the order will not affect the lead-time. 
Let us also give an example of when the stochastic lead-times are not in-
dependent of the lead-time demand and therefore do not belong to type 1. 
Assume, for example, that we order from a factory and that the factory pro-
duces many different items. If the factory gives higher priority to items for 

 
120 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
which there are many orders, the lead-times can evidently be affected by the 
lead-time demand. 
2. Independent lead-times 
The second type of lead-times, i.e., independent stochastic lead-times, may 
occur if the orders are served by many independent servers. If the lead-time 
for a certain order is long, it may then happen that later demands will trigger 
orders that will be delivered earlier than the order considered. 
In many situations it is complicated to model lead-times of type 1. Consider 
for example, orders to a factory and assume that the stochastic lead-time at a 
certain time depends on the queues in front of some machines, and that these 
queues are due to previous orders for the item. To model such lead-times we 
may need to include both the inventory and the queues in an integrated 
model. See e.g., Song (1994) and Zipkin (1986, 2000) for a further discus-
sion of different types of stochastic lead-times. Similar situations may also 
occur in connection with multi-echelon inventory systems, where shortages 
at a higher echelon may cause stochastic delays for lower echelons. See 
Chapter 10. 
In practice it is usually more difficult to evaluate stochastic variations in 
the lead-times compared to demand variations. Unless the lead-time varia-
tions are large, it is then reasonable to disregard them and replace a stochas-
tic lead-time by its mean. As we shall see in Section 5.15.3, this is also exact 
in some situations when dealing with independent stochastic lead-times. 
5.15.2 Handling sequential deliveries independent of the lead-
time demand 
Consider first a continuous review inventory model with stochastic lead-
times of the first type. Since the orders cannot pass each other, it is evident 
that (5.35) is still valid, i.e., 
ILit + L)= IP{t) - D{U t + L{t)\ 
(5.96) 
where L{i) is the stochastic lead-time that occurs at time t. 
Assume that a certain {R, Q) policy is used and define 
IP = stochastic inventory position in steady state, 
IL = stochastic inventory level in steady state, 
D = stochastic lead-time demand when averaging over Z, 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
121 
i.e., for discrete demand 
P{D = j) = EP{{D{L)^j)). 
(5.97) 
Let now t in (5.96) be a completely arbitrary time. Note that this means that t 
+ Z is also a completely arbitrary time. Furthermore, L{i) is an arbitrary sto-
chastic lead-time. We get 
IL=IP-D, 
(5.98) 
which can be used in the same way as we have used (5.35) in case of a con-
stant lead-time. 
For compound Poisson demand the distribution of the inventory level can 
be obtained through a slight generalization of (5.36). We simply average 
over different lead-times

R+Q

P{IL = j) = E\-

P(DiL) = k-jy^

For an 5policy, or equivalently (S - I, S) policy, (5.99) simplifies to 
P{IL = j) = E{PiD{L) = S-j)} 
= PiD = S-j), 
j<S. 
(5.100) 
Similarly we get the inventory level distribution for continuous normally 
distributed demand from (5.39) as 
F(X) = P(IL<X) = EI^

R+Q

(5.101) 
Lead-times of the first type should, in principle, be handled as in (5.99)-
(5.101). It is often practical, though, to use a simple approximation where 
the distribution of the demand during a stochastic lead-time is replaced by a 
normal distribution with correct mean and variance. As before, we denote 

 
122 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
the mean and standard deviation of the demand per time unit by // and a. 
We obtain the mean ofD as 
E{D) = ^{L). 
(5.102) 
For a given L, E{{D{L)f} = a^L + {^f. 
The variance of Z) can then be de-
termined as 
Var{D) = EICT^L + {/jlf ]- //^ {E{L)f 
L ^ 
^ 
= a^EiL) + M^Vcir(L) + M^(E(L)f 
-^^(E(L)f 
(5.103) 
= a^E(L) + M^Var(L). 
If we set //' = E{D) and cr' = {Var{D)f'^, we can then, as an approximation, 
use expressions for constant lead-times like (5.39), (5.42), (5.43), etc. 
5.15.3 Handling independent lead-times 
We shall consider a well-known and interesting result. Assume an S policy 
and Poisson demand with intensity A, i.e., each demand triggers an order. 
This also means that the orders can be described by the same Poisson proc-
ess as the demands. The stochastic lead-times are independent but otherwise 
general. We can see the supply system as an (M/G/oo) system. (M stands for 
Poisson arrivals, G for a general lead-time distribution, and oo for an unlim-
ited number of servers.) According to Palm's theorem (Palm, 1938), the total 
occupancy in an (M/G/oo) system (Poisson arrivals, general service time and 
unlimited number of servers) is Poisson distributed with mean AE(L). So the 
outstanding orders have a Poisson distribution that only depends on the ex-
pected value of the lead-time. This means that we can replace the stochastic 
lead-time by its mean or by exponential service times, or whatever we feel is 
easy to deal with. 
It is a little surprising that in the considered situation a stochastic lead-
time will not give any disadvantages compared to a constant lead-time. One 
reason is that when orders cross in time we can always use the earliest deliv-
eries to satisfy customer demands. So, items do not, in general, satisfy cus-
tomer demands in the same order as they are replenished from the supplier. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
123 
In case of compound Poisson demand, the number of outstanding orders 
(but not the number of items) is still Poisson. 
5.15.4 Comparison of the two types of stochastic lead-times 
We shall illustrate the differences between the two types of lead-times by an 
example. 
Example 5.9 Consider pure Poisson demand with intensity X = 2 and an {S -
1, 5) policy with S= 3. 
Assume first that the orders placed with the outside supplier are served by 
a single server with exponential service time and service rate K= 2.5. This 
means that the supplier is modeled as an (M/M/1) queuing system. The lead-
time, i.e., the waiting time including the service time, is evidently of type 1. 
It is well-known that the waiting time has an exponential distribution with 
density (K- X)e^'''^^' = 0.5 e^^"^ \ Using (5.100) we obtain

(5.105) 
i.e., the inventory level has a geometric distribution with P(IL - j) = 
0.2-0.8^"^' (/â¢<3). 
Let us now instead assume that the stochastic lead-times are service times 
in an (M/M/oo) system, i.e., the supplier is modeled as a queuing system with 
infinitely many servers and exponential service times. Let us also assume 
that the service rate for each server is A: = 0.5. This means that the distribu-

 
124 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
tion of the lead-time is exactly the same as in the above situation with a sin-
gle server. The lead-times are, however, now of the second type, i.e., inde-
pendent. Using the results in Section 5.15.3 we can simply replace the sto-
chastic lead-time by its mean !//<:= 2. The lead-time demand is Poisson dis-
tributed with mean XlK = A. We obtain the probability for inventory level7 
as the probability that the lead-time demand is 3 -7, 
( 3 - J ) ! 
(5.106)

Recall that the lead-time distribution is the same in both cases. It is obvious 
that the inventory level varies much less in case of independent lead-times. 
This is, in general, advantageous since it is easier to avoid large backorder 
levels. 
Note also that a constant lead-time is both of type 1 and of type 2.

6 SINGLE-ECHELON SYSTEMS: 
INTEGRATION - OPTIMALITY 
6.1 Joint optimization of order quantity and reorder 
point 
In practice it is most common to determine the batch quantity from a deter-
ministic model. The stochastic demand is then replaced by its mean. In 
Chapter 4 we have considered different methods for determination of batch 
quantities under the assumption of deterministic demand. Stochastic varia-
tions in the demand, and possibly in the lead-time, are then only taken into 
account when determining the reorder point. As discussed in Chapter 4 this 
procedure is, in general, an adequate approximation. In Chapter 5 we have 
described various techniques for determining the reorder point for a given 
batch quantity. 
It is also possible, though, to optimize the batch quantity and the reorder 
point jointly in a stochastic model. In this section we shall consider such 
techniques. 
6.1.1 Discrete demand 
Assume discrete compound Poisson demand. Each customer demands an 
integral number of units. As before, we also assume that not all demands are 
multiples of some integer larger than one. The average demand per unit of 
time is denoted //. The lead-time L is constant. The stochastic lead-time de-
mand is denoted D(L) and its mean //' = /zL.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
Furthermore, we consider a holding cost h per unit and time unit, a short-
age cost b\ per unit and time unit, and an ordering or setup cost ^. 
6.1.1.1 {R, Q) policy 
We shall first deal with a continuous review {R, Q) policy and the joint 
optimization of the integers R and Q. A periodic review model can be han-
dled in essentially the same way. See also Federgruen and Zheng (1992). 
Recall the following standard argument from Section 5.3.2. Let IP{t) be 
the inventory position at time t. Consider then the time / + Z. At that time, 
everything that was on order at time t has been delivered. Orders that have 
been triggered in the interval {t, t + L] have not reached the inventory due to 
the lead-time. Consequently we have 
IL{t+L)=IP{t)-D{L). 
(6.1) 
Let us initially consider the special case of an (iS - 1, S) policy with S = k, 
i.e., R =" k - \ and Q= I. This means that the inventory position is k at all 
times. Using (6.1) the inventory level distribution can then be obtained as 
P{IL = j) = P(D(L) = k- j \ 
j < k. 
(6.2) 
Let g{k) be the average holding and shortage costs per time unit. We have 
from (5.56) 
g{k) = -b,E{IL) + {h + b, )E{IL' ) = -b,(k-M') 
+ (h + boi JPilL = j). 
7=1 
(6.3) 
The results in Section 5.9.1 imply that g{k) is a convex function of the in-
ventory position k. Furthermore g{k) ^^ oo as |A:| ^> OO. 
Let us now go back to the {R, Q) policy. Recall that the inventory posi-
tion is uniform on [i? + 1, i? + g]. Consequently the total average costs per 
time unit can be expressed as 
A 
1 ^^^ 
C(R,Q) = ^ ^ Â± 
^ g ( ^ ) . 
(6.4) 
In (6.4) we obtain the holding and backorder costs by averaging over the in-
ventory position. We assume that each batch incurs an ordering cost A, i.e., 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - INTEGRATION 
131 
if an order for two batches is triggered, the associated ordering cost is 2A. 
Our objective is to optimize C(R, Q) with respect to both R and Q. 
Let us now define C{Q) as 
C ( 0 = min{C(i?,0}. 
(6.5) 
R 
It is evident that C(l) = A/j-^ miuy^ {gQ^]^ i-^-? if the sum in (6.4) includes a 
single value of k, we choose a k that gives the minimum cost. We denote an 
optimal k, i.e., a value of A: that minimizes g{k) by A:. A corresponding opti-
mal reorder point for g = 1 is i?*(l) = k*- 1, i.e., if we use a single value of A:, 
we choose the best one. Consider now Q = 2, which means that we use two 
values ofk. Due to the convexity oig{k), the second best k must be either k*-
1 or A: + 1. Clearly, we should use the better of these two values. From (6.4) 
it is therefore evident that it is optimal to choose R*i2) = i?*(l) - 1 if g(i?*(l)) 
< g{R\\) 
+ 2), and R\2) = R\\) 
otherwise. We obtain C(2) = A/jJ2 + 
[mm{g(i?*(l)) , g{R\\) + 2)} + g{R\\) + l)]/2, or equivalently, C(2) = 
C(l)/2 + min{g(i?*(l)), g{R\l) + 2)}/2. More generally we have 
R\Q^\) 
= R\Q)-\ 
ifg{R\Q))<g{R\Q)^Q 
+ \\ 
(6.6) 
R\Q 
+ \) = R*{Q) otherwise, 
and 
2 + 1 
2 + 1 
(6.7) 
It is evident from (6.7) that C{Q + 1) > C{Q) if and only if min{g(i?*(2), 
g{R\Q) + 2 + 1)} ^ C{Q). Furthermore, it is obvious that min{g(i?*(2). 
SiR*iQ) + 2 + 1 ) } is increasing with Q. Let Q' be the smallest Q such that 
C(2 + 1) > C(2). It follows from (6.7) that C{Q) > C(Q*) for any Q > Q\ 
Consequently, Q and R{Q) provide the optimal solution. 
To summarize, it is very easy to determine the optimal solution by ap-
plying (6.6) and (6.7) until the costs increase.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
6.1.1.2 (5, 5) policy 
Let us now instead consider the optimization of an (s, S) policy. Other-
wise the assumptions are exactly the same as above. When using an (s, S) 
policy the inventory position is no longer uniformly distributed. This makes 
the optimization more complex. Zheng and Federgruen (1991), however, 
have developed a very efficient optimization procedure. We shall here only 
describe the procedure and refer to their paper for proofs and more details. 
In Section 5.11 we defined and determined the probabilities 
ruj = probability to reach IP =j during an order cycle (s -^ I < j <S). 
The average total number of customers during an order cycle is YJI=S+\^J â¢ 
Let A be the customer arrival rate. The average length of an order cycle is 
consequently Sf=5+i ^j /^- The steady state distribution of the inventory po-
sition is obtained as 
P(IP = k) = m,,/ Yu^J' 
k = s+\,s + 2,...,S. 
(6.8) 
j=s+\ 
See Section 5.11 for more details. Given these probabilities we can deter-
mine the average costs per time unit as 
AX 
^ 
C{s^S) = â 
+ X ^(^^ = ^) â¢ S(ky 
(6.9) 
7=5+1 
k=s+\ 
We are now ready to describe the optimization procedure. 
1. In the first step we set S* = k*, i.e., a value of A: that minimizes g(k). Next, 
consider s = S* - I, s = S* - 2, ... , until C(s, S*) < g(s). When this occurs, 
set 5* = s and the initial best solution as C = C(s , S). Set S = S . 
2. Set 5 = S + 1. lfg{S) > C\ s* and S* provide the optimal solution with the 
costs C , and the algorithm stops. 
3. It is possible to show that the considered S will improve the solution if, 
and only if, C(s\ S) < C*. In that case set S* = S. Otherwise go to 2. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - INTEGRATION 
133 
4. To find the best s corresponding to 5 , it is only necessary to consider s = 
s , s + 1, ... The new s is obtained as the smallest value of ^ giving C(s, 
S*) > gis + 1). Update C* = C(s\ S*) and go to 2. 
6.1.2 An iterative technique 
Now consider normally distributed demand instead, and add ordering costs 
to the (i?, 0 model with backorder cost per unit and unit time that we dealt 
with in Section 5.9.2. The lead-time demand has mean /u' and standard de-
viation cf. The mean per unit of time is //. 
By adding the average ordering costs per time unit to the cost expression 
in (5.65) we have 
fi 
CiR,Q) = h(R + Q/2-^') 
+ (h + 
b,)^ H R-ju' 
-H 
R + Q-M 
Aju 
(6.10) 
Recall the definitions ofH(x) and G(x). See Appendix 2. 
Our objective is to optimize C(R, Q) with respect to 7? and Q. As 
pointed out in Section 5.9.2, we cannot replace the backorder costs by the fill 
rate (5.67) when carrying out a joint optimization of 7^ and Q. 
We shall demonstrate how the optimization can be carried out by a sim-
ple iterative procedure. It can be shown that this procedure will always con-
verge to the optimal solution (Rosling, 2002b). 
The necessary conditions dC I dQ= dC I dR = 0 are also sufficient and 
will guarantee the unique optimal solution. 
We obtain dCId^ as in (5.66) 
dR

R^Q-fi' 
R-/ 
(6.11) 
For a given Q we can use (6.11) to determine the corresponding reorder 
point R giving dC/dR= 0. The resulting R decreases with Q. We can also 
get dC/dQ from (6.10) as

We shall now describe the iterative procedure for finding the optimal so-
lution satisfying dCldQ=dCldR= 
0. 
We start by determining the batch quantity according to the classical eco-
nomic order quantity model 
Q"" 
^^lAiu/h, 
(6.13) 
Next we determine the corresponding reorder point F^ from (6.11) and the 
condition dC / 8R =0. In the following step we get a new batch quantity Q^

After that we determine the reorder point 7?^ corresponding to ^ from (6.11) 
and the condition dCIdR=Q. Given Q^ and J?^ we obtain ^ and B^ in the 
same way, etc. 
It can be shown that the batch quantity increases in each step, Q^^^ >Q\ 
while the reorder point decreases, R'^^ <R\ The costs decrease in each step. 
Let C* be the optimal cost. It is possible to show that C{R \ Q'^^^yC* < h{Q'^^ 
- g'), i.e., the remaining gap can be bounded.

Example 6.1 Let A = 100, h = 2, and b\ = 20. The demand per time unit is 
normally distributed with //= 50 and a= 20. The lead-time is i = 4. We ob-
tain //'= juL= 200 and cr= aL^'^ = 40. 
The results from the iterations when applying the described procedure are 
shown in Table 6.1. We can see that the costs converge very rapidly. The 
changes in batch quantity and reorder point as compared to the initial solu-
tion are significant. Still the total cost reduction is only about 2.5 percent.

Similar procedures for models with other types of costs can be designed 
in the same way. We could, for example, have used a shortage cost per unit 
as in Section 5.10. A corresponding procedure for a model with lost sales is 
given in Rosling (2002a). 
6.1.3 Fill rate constraint - a simple approach 
We shall now consider a different and very simple technique from Axsater 
(2004). This technique is especially suitable when optimizing R and Q under 
a fill rate constraint, because it is in general only necessary to consider rela-
tively few different fill rates. The cost function is the same as in (6.10) ex-
cept for the backorder costs that are omitted

It is possible to show that the considered problem has a pure optimal 
strategy, i.e., a single (i?, Q) as its optimal solution, see Rosling (2002b). 

 
13 6 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
At a first glance the problem to optimize (6.15) under the constraint 
(6.16) for a given fill rate S2 depends on five parameters: h, A, //, //', and cf. 
However, it is easy to see that the problem does in fact depend on a single 
parameter only. Define 
c = C/{ha% 
q ^ Qla\ 
r = 
{R-^ya\ 
E = Ajj/(h(af). 
Substituting in (6.15) and (6.16) we get the equivalent problem to minimize 
c = r + ^ + -[H{r)-H{r 
+ q)] + - , 
(6.17)

q 
q 
under the constraint 
S2=l--[G{r)-G{r + q)l 
(6.18) 
Note that this version of the problem for a certain given S2 depends on a sin-
gle problem parameter, 
E>0. 
Axsater (2004) suggests that q* is determined by linear interpolation of 
tabulated values (or by using a polynomial approximation). (The tabulated 
values can, for example, be obtained by using the technique in Section 
6.1.2.) The corresponding r* is then obtained from (6.18) in a second step. A 
part of the required table is given in Table 6.2. 
We are now ready to describe a simple way to solve the original problem 
for a given fill rate S2 and any problem parameters. We start by determining 
E. Next we obtain the solution of the one-parameter problem from the table 
and (6.18). Given the optimal solution q* and / , we get the solution of the 
original problem as 
R* ^r*a' + ju'-
Note that we can use the same table repeatedly for all items. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - INTEGRATION 
137 
Example 6.2 Let ^2 = 0.9, A = 100, h = 2, jU= 50, //'= 200, and a = 40, i.e., 
except for the backorder cost, the same data as in Example 6.1. We get E 
=Aju/(h((7f) = 1.5625 and e = In (E) - 0.4463. Using the table values for e = 
0.4 and e = 0.5 and interpolating linearly, we get q*= (2.5111(0.5 - 0.4463) + 
2.6070(0.4463 - 0.4))/0.1 = 2.5555. Using (6.18) we get r* = 0.3294. Finally 
we 
obtain 
g* =^*cr'= 2.5555-40 = 102.22 
and 
R*=r*a' + ju' 
= 
0.3294-40 + 200 = 213.18. The corresponding optimal solution is Q* = 
102.20 andi?* = 213.14.

6.2 Optimality of ordering policies 
In all the models that we have considered in this chapter it has been assumed 
that the policy is either of the (R, Q) type or of the {s, S) type. A natural 
question to ask is whether other, better policies exist. This is, in general, not 
the case. In most situations one of these policies is indeed optimal for a sin-
gle-echelon inventory system with independent items. 
In Section 6.2.1 we shall show that an {R, Q) policy is optimal when there 
are no ordering costs but a given fixed batch quantity Q. After that we com-
ment on the optimality of (5, S) policies in Section 6.2.2. 

 
13 8 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
6.2.7. Optimality of (R, Q) policies when ordering in batches 
Consider an inventory system with continuous review. Assume discrete 
compound Poisson demand and that each customer demands an integral 
number of units. As before, we assume that not all demands are multiples of 
some integer larger than one. The average demand per unit of time is de-
noted ju. The lead-time L is constant. The stochastic lead-time demand is de-
noted D{L) and its mean /u' = juL. 
Furthermore, we consider a holding cost h per unit and time unit and a 
shortage cost bi per unit and time unit. There are no ordering costs but all 
orders must be multiples of a given batch quantity Q. Orders can only be 
triggered by customer demands. We shall show that an (i?, Q) policy is opti-
mal under these assumptions. Our proof follows essentially Chen (2000). 
Obviously the inventory position must be an integer at all times. Assume 
first that the inventory position is k at some arbitrary time t. Using (6.1) the 
inventory level distribution at time t + L can be obtained as 
P{IL = j) = P{D{L) = k-j), 
j < k. 
(6.19) 
Furthermore, (as in Section 6.1.1.1), let g(k) be the corresponding holding 
and shortage cost rate at time t + L. We have 
g(k) = -b,EiIL) + (h + b,)E{IL^) = -b,(k-M') 
+ (h^b,)J:jP(IL 
= j). 
(6.20) 
As shown in Section 5.9.1, g{k) is a convex function of the inventory posi-
tion k. Furthermore g{k) -> oo as \k\ -> oo. 
Define now 
Q 
M 
where y is an integer. Clearly g{y) is also convex. Denote by R the finite 
integer;^ that minimizes giy) . 
Lemma 6.1 Let x and z be integers. For a given z, g(z + xQ) is convex in x. 
Let x^ be the unique integer so that 7? +1 < z + x^Q <R + Q. Then g(z + xQ) is 
minimized with respect to x for x = x^. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - INTEGRATION 
139 
Proof It follows from the convexity of g(k) that g{z + xQ) is convex in x. 
Note that 
g{z + (x +1)0 - giz + xQ) = giz + xQ) - giz + xQ-l). 
(6.21) 
Consider first any x < x^. This means that z -^ xQ < R. Obviously 
g(z + xQ) - g(z -\- xQ-l)<0. 
Similarly, x> x^ implies z -^ xQ> R + Q and 
g(z + xQ) -g(z + xQ-l)>0. 
It follows that g(z + xQ) is minimized with 
respect to ;c for x = x^. 
We are now ready to prove the following proposition. 
Proposition 6.1 An (R, Q) policy is optimal. 
Proof Consider any feasible policy. Let j^/ be the inventory position at time t. 
The cost rate at time ^ + Z is then giy^. From Lemma 6.1 we know that g{y^ 
> giyi) where yi =yt + nQ and n is the unique integer so that j ; / G {i? + \,R 
+ 2, ... , R + Q}. Consequently, the long-run average cost must be greater 
than or equal to the long-run average value of giyi)- To determine these 
costs consider the stochastic process jv/. Obviously;;/ is constant between 
the customer demands. Let Dt be a demand at some time t. Let j ; / be the 
inventory position before the demand and y'l the inventory position after 
the demand. Clearly 
yt^y; -D,+mQ, 
(6.22) 
where m is nonnegative. Furthermore, due to our construction we must also 
have, 
y';=y[--D,+m'Q, 
(6.23) 
where m' is an integer. Given y[~ and A? the value of m' is unique because 
yi ^{R + 1, i? H- 2, ... , R + Q). The demand sizes are independent, so the 
different y/ can be seen as a Markov chain with the finite state space {i? + 1, 
i? + 2, ... , i? + g}. The steady state distribution can be shown to be uniform. 
(This can be done in essentially the same way as the proof of Proposition 5.1 
in Section 5.3.1. We omit the details.) 

 
140 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
The long-run average value of g(y/) is therefore g(R)/Q. This is a lower 
bound on the long-run cost of any feasible policy. But this lower bound can 
be achieved by using an (iJ, Q) policy. Using an (R, Q) policy the inventory 
position is also uniform on {R + 1, i? + 2, ... , R + Q}. (We obtain the costs 
by setting^ = 0 in (6.4).) This completes the proof. 
Proposition 6.1 can be generalized in different ways, for example to other 
cost structures and to periodic review. In the special case when g = 1 the (R, 
Q) policy degenerates to an S policy with 5 = i? + 1. This means that Propo-
sition 6.1 also demonstrates the optimality of an S policy in case of no or-
dering costs and no constraints concerning the batch quantities. 
For problems with continuous or Poisson demand, (i?, Q) policies and {s, 
S) policies are equivalent. For such problems {s, S) policies are consequently 
also optimal. 
6.2.2 Optimality of (s, S) policies 
If we replace the fixed batch quantity in Section 6.2.1 by an ordering cost the 
optimal policy is under quite general conditions of the (s, S) type. This is 
more difficult to show, see e.g., Porteus (2002). 
It is interesting to note, however, that {s, S) policies are not necessarily 
optimal for problems with service constraints. Consider, for example, a 
problem with discrete integral demand where s and S are integers. It may 
very well happen that no (s, S) policy provides a certain given service level 
exactly. The best (s, S) policy that satisfies the service constraint will conse-
quently give a slightly higher service than what is required. In such a situa-
tion it may be possible to reduce the costs by varying the policy over time so 
that the average service level is exactly as prescribed. 
Early optimality results were presented by Iglehart (1963) and Veinott 
(1966). More recent results are provided by Zheng (1991), Rosling (2002b), 
and Beyer and Sethi (1999). 
6.3 Updating order quantities and reorder points in 
practice 
In Chapters 2 - 5 we have presented different techniques for forecasting and 
determination of batch quantities and reorder points. We shall now illustrate 
how these techniques can be implemented in an inventory control system. 
We assume that we are dealing with a single-echelon system and independ-
ent items. 

 
SINGLE-ECHELON - INTEGRATION 
141 
The forecasts are normally updated with a certain periodicity. In general, 
it is most practical to also update reorder points and batch quantities at these 
times, immediately after updating the forecasts. Let 
tf = forecast period. 
We can think of the forecast period as, for example, one month. The time 
unit is not important. We can use one month as the time unit. In that case tf = 
1, but we can also express tp in days (tf = 30), or in years (tf = 1/12). How-
ever, to avoid unnecessary errors it is recommended to use the same time 
unit in all inventory control computations. 
Typically the forecasts are updated either by exponential smoothing (Sec-
tion 2.4), or by exponential smoothing with trend (Section 2.5). It may also 
be reasonable to use a seasonal method (Section 2.6) for a few items. The 
forecasting method is, in general, chosen manually for each item. To specify 
the forecasting method, we also need the smoothing parameters that are part 
of the different forecasting methods. Usually it is practical to divide the 
items into a number of inventory control groups and let the forecasting tech-
nique as well as various inventory control parameters, like holding cost rate 
and service level, be identical for all items in the same group. See also 
Chapter 11. 
When using exponential smoothing we update the average demand d^ at 
the end of each forecast period. If instead we use exponential smoothing 
with trend, we update both the average demand d^ and the trend b^. In ei-
ther case we also update some error measure like MADt (Section 2.10). 
In case of exponential smoothing the average demand per unit of time ju 
is obtained as 
ju = df/tf. 
(6.24) 
When using exponential smoothing with trend we are, in principle, 
assuming that the demand is increasing or decreasing linearly with time. Just 
after the forecast update the estimated demand in the coming period is 
df-^bf, A natural estimate of the demand rate in the middle of this period is 
then d^/tf-^bf /tf. The trend is b^ /(tff.The corresponding estimate of the de-
mand rate in the beginning of the period, i.e., just after the update, is then 
df/tf + 4 /(2^F)- The estimated demand rate u time units after the update is 
df /tf + 4 /(2^F) + W 4 /(tff'

INVENTORY CONTROL 
The standard deviation of the demand per time unit is obtained according 
to (2.50) and (2.55) as 
a^â^J-MAD,, 
(6.25) 
where the parameter c = 111 if we assume that forecast errors in different 
time periods are independent. This can be regarded as the standard assump-
tion. The parameter c is always in the interval (0.5, 1). 
Assume that a continuous review {R, Q) policy is used for inventory con-
trol. Since the items are treated independently we shall consider a certain 
item with lead-time L. The lead-times are in general different for different 
items. Our first step is to update the batch quantity Q. The most common 
technique is to use the classical economic order quantity model and let the 
average demand per time unit // replace the constant demand per unit of 
time. As in (4.3) we obtain 
The ordering cost, A, is in general, the same for items belonging to the same 
inventory control group. The holding cost, h, is usually determined as a cer-
tain percentage of the value of the item. This carrying charge should include 
capital costs as well as other types of holding costs. Usually the carrying 
charge is the same for all items in the same inventory control group, but the 
holding costs vary among the items because of different values of the items. 
A typical carrying charge could be something like 10-15 percent if we use 
one year as the time unit. The carrying charge is normally higher than the 
interest rate charged by the bank. See Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. 
Although (6.26) is intended for stationary demand, it is often also applied 
when using exponential smoothing with trend. In that case the average de-
mand rate // should correspond to the time when the batch is used. Consider 
a time interval of length r starting at the time of the update. Let D{f) be the 
stochastic demand during this interval and g(r) the expected value of this 
demand. We have 
g{r) = E{D{T)]^ \â{a, +^) + .^u)du=ia, 
+^)-^ + ^ ^ .

By setting g(T) equal to a certain quantity d and solving for r, we can esti-
mate the time T{d) until a certain quantity d has been demanded. We obtain 
T(d) as the solution of a second order equation 
T{d) = -tj, a^

(6.28) 
We can use (6.27) and (6.28) for estimating the demand rate ahead of 
time in connection with determination of reorder point and batch quantity. 
Consider, for example, an order just after the forecast update. Assume 
that the inventory position is equal to the reorder point R, What is then the 
average demand to be used in (6.26)? Let Q be an estimate of the batch 
quantity, e.g., the previous batch size. We will start to consume the batch 
around time r(i?), and the whole batch will be consumed around time T(R + 
g'). About half of the batch has been consumed at time r'= T{R + 2'/2). A 
reasonable estimate of the average demand rate during the time when the 
batch is consumed is then 
1 .. 
h,^

and we can use this ju instead of (6.24) in (6.26). Recall also from Section 
4.1.2 that the costs are very insensitive to small errors in the batch quantity, 
so it may also be reasonable to use simpler approximations. 
It is a little more complicated to take seasonal demand variations into ac-
count when determining batch quantities. In practice it is therefore quite 
common to disregard the effect of the seasonal variations on the batch quan-
tities. 
To be able to determine the reorder point, we next need to determine the 
distribution of the lead-time demand. Let /u^ and d be the mean and average 
of the lead-time demand just after the forecast update. In case of exponential 
smoothing we have 
/j' = â L, 
(6.30) 
and in case of exponential smoothing with trend 

 
144 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
^i'=g{L). 
(6.31) 
The standard deviation is obtained as 
a' = aL^ ^J-MAD, U^' 
\^F J 
(6.32) 
It is not common to take stochastic variations in the lead-time into ac-
count. One reason is that it is usually difficult to determine the lead-time 
distribution. If the lead-time variations are known and the deliveries are se-
quential it is easy to use the approximation based on (5.102) and (5.103). 
Given the mean and standard deviation, the most common approach is to 
assume that the lead-time demand is normally distributed. For items with 
low demand it may sometimes be more appropriate to use a Poisson distri-
bution or a compound Poisson distribution. If we assume that the normal dis-
tribution is used and that there is a given fill rate S2 (See Section 5.4), it is 
easy to determine the reorder point R from (5.52). In case of compound Pois-
son demand we can apply (5.36) and (5.51). 
Note that in this section we have used models for stationary demand also 
when there is a trend in demand. This approximation is usually satisfactory 
as long as the trend is relatively small compared to the average. 
Example 6.3 We shall update forecast, batch quantity, and reorder point for 
an item controlled by a continuous review (i?, Q) policy. The updates take 
place at the end of each month, and we use one month as our time unit, i.e., 
tf = I. We apply exponential smoothing with smoothing constant a = O.l 
when updating both the forecast and MAD. At the end of the preceding 
month we obtained the forecast a = 132 and MAD = 42. We have just re-
ceived the demand during the last month as 92. The batch quantity is deter-
mined according to the classical economic order quantity model. The hold-
ing cost is $1.5 per unit and month, and the ordering cost $200. The lead-
time is two months. The fill rate is required to be 95 percent. The demand 
can be regarded as continuous and normally distributed, and forecast errors 
during different time periods are assumed to be independent. 
As our first step we update the forecast and MAD 
a = 0.9.132 + 0.1-92 = 128, 
M4D = 0.9-42 + 0.1.1132-92U 41.8.

Next we determine the batch quantity 
2 = ^ 1 : ^ = 1 8 4 . 7 5 , 1 8 5 . 
It remains to determine the reorder point R from (5.52). First we obtain //' 
and cr as 
ju' = 2-US = 256, 
o-' = V2- /-â¢41.8 = 74.09. 
Finally, using the search procedure described in connection with (5.52) we 
obtaini? = 313.62^314. 
We have assumed a continuous review (R, Q) policy. Periodic review can be 
handled as described in Section 5.12. When using an {s, S) policy instead of 
an (R, Q) policy it is common in practice to first determine R and Q for an 
(7?, 0 policy and then apply the simple approximation s = R and S â¢- s = Q.

Forecasts are determined by both simple exponential smoothing and by 
exponential smoothing with trend. For simple exponential smoothing, the 
smoothing constant is 0.2. The same smoothing constant is used when 
updating the mean with the trend model. The smoothing constant for the 
trend is 0.4. When updating MAD the smoothing constant is 0.2. The forecast 
errors are assumed to be independent and normally distributed. Before the 
first week (16) the forecasted demand was 100.0 and the trend was assumed 
to be zero. MAD was 7.

7 COORDINATED ORDERING 
In Chapters 3-6 it was assumed that different items in an inventory could be 
controlled independently. We shall now leave this assumption and consider 
situations where there is a need to coordinate orders for different items. In 
this chapter we shall still, as in Chapters 3-6, assume that the items are 
stocked at a single location. (Multi-stage inventory systems are dealt with in 
Chapters 8-10.) We consider traditional inventory costs and constraints, i.e., 
holding costs, ordering or setup costs, and backorder costs or service con-
straints. 
When coordinating the replenishments for different items, it is common 
to use cyclic schedules, and especially so-called powers-of-two policies. In 
Section 7.1 we derive some important results for such policies. 
There are two main reasons for coordinating the replenishments of a 
group of items. One reason, dealt with in Section 7.2, is that we wish to get a 
sufficiently smooth production load. Assume, for example, that a considered 
group of items is produced in the same production line. We then want to co-
ordinate the orders for different items so that they are evenly spread over 
time. 
The other main reason for coordinated replenishments, which is treated in 
Section 7.3, is completely opposite. We want to trigger orders for a group of 
items at the same time. This can be advantageous in many situations. It may 
be possible to get a discount if the total order from the same vendor is 
greater than a certain breakpoint. It may also be possible to reduce the trans-
portation costs, for example, by filling a truckload. Sometimes the setup 
costs can also be lowered substantially if a group of similar items are pro-
duced together in a machine. 

 
150 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
7.1 Powers-of-two policies 
Both when using mathematical algorithms and when choosing schedules 
manually, it is very common to use so-called powers-of-two policies in con-
nection with coordinated replenishments. This means that the cycle times are 
restricted to be powers of two times a certain basic period. If the basic period 
is, for example, one week, nonnegative powers of two give 2^ = 1 week, 2^ = 
2 weeks, 2^ = 4 weeks, 2^ = 8 weeks etc. With negative powers of two we 
also obtain 2'^ = 1/2 week, 2"^ = 1/4 week, etc. A main advantage of such cy-
cle times is that we obtain relatively simple cyclic schedules. Consider, for 
example, two items that are produced every fourth and every eighth week, 
respectively. The total cycle time is then eight weeks, since everything is re-
peated every eighth week. If instead of four and eight weeks we use the 
similar cycle times five and seven weeks, the total cycle time would be 
5-7 = 35 weeks, i.e., more than four times longer. Assume, for example, that 
both items are produced in week 1. The item with cycle time five weeks is 
then produced in weeks 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, etc., and the other item, 
with cycle time seven weeks, in weeks 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, etc. So week 36 
is the first time after week 1 when both items are produced. 
Consider a number of items with constant continuous demand. Given 
holding costs and ordering costs we wish to determine suitable batch quanti-
ties, or equivalently cycle times. (See Section 4.1.1.) We shall show that a 
restriction to powers-of-two policies will give a solution which is very close 
to the optimal solution. 
Consider first a single item. Recall the following result from Section 
4.1.2.

which gives the relative cost increase when deviating from the optimal batch 
quantity Q* in the classical economic order quantity model. The expression 
(7.1) is valid also with a finite production rate (Section 4.2). Furthermore, 
since we are dealing with constant demand, d, we can just as well express 
the policy through the cycle time T = Q/d where T* = Q /d is the optimal so-
lution. This means that we can equivalently formulate (7.1) as

CORDINATED ORDERING 
151 
We shall consider cycle times and the representation (7,2) when deriving 
our results on the approximation errors, but it is important to note that the re-
sults are also valid for the batch quantities. 
Consider now a powers-of-two solution of a lot sizing problem, i.e., as-
sume that the cycle time Thas to be chosen as 
r-2^g, 
(7.3) 
where m can be any integer and where, for the time being, we assume that 
the basic period q is given. Assume that T* cannot be expressed according to 
(7.3). We then have to choose either the next lower or the next higher T sat-
isfying (7.3). Due to (7.3), the ratio between these two values is 2. Note also 
that the best solution under the constraint (7,3) is not affected if q is multi-
plied by a power of two. If, for example, q is multiplied by 2, we can reduce 
m by 1 to get the same result. 
What is the worst possible relative cost increase caused by restricting the 
solution with the constraint (7.3)? Because of the convexity, the worst possi-
ble error must occur when two consecutive values of m, say m = k and m = k 
+ 1 give the same error. Let T< T correspond to m = k, and 2T> T to m = k 
+ 1. We obtain

Proposition 7.1 For a given basic period q, the maximum relative cost in-

152 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
We have only discussed a single item, but Proposition 7.1 is evidently 
also true if there are several items, because the worst case occurs when all 
items incur the maximum error of 6 percent. 
Let us now assume that it is possible to change q. For a single item we 
will then get the optimal solution simply by choosing q equal to a power of 
two times T . If, however, we have A^items (items / = 1, 2, ... , N), we can, in 
general, not fit q perfectly to all cycle times T^ , which depend on the prob-
lem data for different items. The relative cost increase can be expressed as

i.e., Ti I Ti = l""' (-1 / 2 < X,- < 1 / 2). The end points x/ - - 1/2 and x,- = 1/2

different values of X/ in (7.7), Q / ^ M Q Â» ^s probabilities. Denote the 
corresponding distribution function on [-1/2, 1/2] by F(x), i.e., F(-l/2) = 0

formulate (7.7) as

Assume now that we change q by multiplying by 2-^ , where 0 < 3; < 1. (Re-
call that multiplying ^ by a power of two does not affect the solution, so we 
are considering the most general change.) If we do not change x this is 
equivalent to replacing x by x + j;. However, if x + j ; > 1 / 2 it is advantageous 
to change x to x - 1. This means that a certain x is replaced hy x~^y for x + y 
<l/2 , and by x+3; - 1 forx +j^ >l/2 . Consequently we have

For a given distribution F{x) the minimum cost increase is obtained by 
minimizing (7.10) with respect to 0 < JF < 1. 
We are now ready to prove Proposition 7.2, which shows that the maxi-
mum relative error is surprisingly low. 
Proposition 7.2 If we can change the basic period q, the maximum relative 
cost increase of a powers-of-two policy is 2 percent. 
Proof The average cost increase for 0 < >Â» < 1 must be at least as large as the 
minimum and we have from (7.10), by changing the order of integration,

The worst case will occur when the distribution F{x) is uniform on

This completes the proof. 
Powers-of-two policies are important ingredients of Roundy's so-called 
98 percent approximation. See Sections 7.3.1.2 and 9.2.2.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
7.2 Production smoothing 
In general, it is a very complicated problem to control the stocks of different 
items in such a way that we get both low inventory costs and smooth capac-
ity utilization. To simplify the problem it is common to first disregard sto-
chastic demand variations and solve the remaining deterministic problem. 
Safety stocks are then usually determined in a second step using techniques 
for independent items, see Chapter 5. However, the deterministic problem 
can also be very difficult, especially if there are many items with time-vary-
ing demand and several capacity constraints. 
When the demands for different items are relatively stable over an ex-
tended period, it is often advantageous to use cyclic schedules as a means to 
obtain a smooth production load. This means that each item is ordered peri-
odically, and that the ordering periods for different items are chosen such 
that the load becomes as smooth as possible. 
Consider, for example, a machine which is used for producing four items 
(items 1-4) all with about the same demand. It can then be a good idea to 
decide that item 1 is produced in weeks 1, 5, 9 ..., item 2 in weeks 2, 6, 10 ... 
, item 3 in weeks 3,7, 11 ... , and item 4 in weeks 4, 8, 12 ... . This can be 
organized by applying periodic review order-up-to-^S policies. Each item has 
a review period equal to four weeks, but the reviews take place in different 
weeks. Since the machine is producing exactly one of the items each week, 
the load will be very smooth. As we have discussed in Chapter 3, we need, 
for a given lead-time, more safety stock when applying a periodic review 
policy as compared to a policy with continuous review. But the alternative of 
using a continuous review policy would in this case probably yield large 
variations in the production load, which would in turn, result in long and un-
certain lead-times. Longer lead-times would also mean that we need more 
safety stock. Furthermore, if we applied a continuous review policy, the 
capital tied up as work-in-process would increase and lead to additional 
holding costs. In a situation like this, the total costs would generally be much 
lower when using the cyclic schedules obtained through the periodic review 
policy. 
In a general case with many items and several production facilities, it can 
be extremely difficult to find suitable cyclic schedules. In Section 7.2.1 we 
will deal with different mathematical approaches for solving the problem in 
the special case when there is only a single machine. In practice it is most 
common to choose cyclic schedules manually without using mathematical 
techniques. 
When the demand is time-varying, one possible approach is to formulate 
the problem as a mixed integer program (MIP) and apply mathematical pro-
gramming techniques to obtain a solution. A typical formulation involves a 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
155 
number of items with given demands over a planning horizon, and holding 
and setup costs as in the dynamic lot size problem (Section 4.5). To produce 
an item, we need to use certain production resources with limited capacities. 
We shall consider such a model in Section 7.2.2. 
Situations where it is, for various practical reasons, very difficult to coor-
dinate the replenishments for different items are quite common. It can then 
still be possible to get a reasonably smooth flow of orders simply by adjust-
ing the order quantities. We discuss such adjustments in Section 7.2.3. 
It is also common in practice to smooth production outside the inventory 
control system. Orders obtained from the inventory control system are then 
not automatically released to production. Release times and order quantities 
are instead adjusted with respect to the present production load. One possible 
planning rule can, for example, be to not release more orders than there is 
capacity to produce within some fixed time frame. Adjustments of the re-
lease times mean essentially that the safety stocks are allowed to vary over 
time in order to smooth the load. We know from the models in Chapters 4 
and 5 that small changes in batch quantities and safety stocks will, in gen-
eral, not affect the costs significantly, while larger changes can have a sub-
stantial impact. When adjusting the orders obtained from the inventory con-
trol system, it is therefore important to avoid large changes for individual 
items. In this context it is also interesting to note that ordering systems of 
KANBAN type will automatically limit the number of outstanding orders. 
See Sections 3.2.3.1 and 8.2.1. 
7.2.1 The Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP) 
7.2.1.1 Problem formulation 
We shall now consider a problem that has been dealt with extensively in the 
inventory literature, the classical Economic Lot Scheduling Problem. This 
problem concerns the determination of cyclic schedules for a number of 
items with constant demands. Backorders are not allowed. The production 
rate is finite and we wish to minimize standard holding and ordering costs. 
Everything is as in the elementary model in Section 4.2 with one exception; 
the items are all produced in a single production facility, i.e., we have a ca-
pacity constraint. It turns out that this additional constraint transforms a sim-
ple model into a very challenging problem. 
We assume that batch quantities and, equivalently, cycle times are kept 
constant over time. Let us introduce the following notation: 
N = number of items, 
hi = holding cost per unit and time unit for item z. 

 
156 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Ai = ordering or setup cost for item /, 
di = demand per time unit, 
Pi = production rate (pi > di), 
Si - setup time in the production facility for item /, independent of the 
sequence of the items, 
Ti ^ cycle time for item i (the batch quantity Qi = Tidi). 
We shall also for simplicity define: 
Pi = 
di/pi, 
Ti = piTi = production time per batch for item i excluding setup time, 
o; = Si + 1/ = total production time per batch for item i. 
Table 7.1 shows data for A^ = 10 items. This sample problem was first 
presented by Bomberger (1966) and has since then been used extensively in 
the literature on economic lot scheduling.

7.2.1.2 The independent solution 
Expressing the costs for item /, C/, as a function of the cycle time, Ti, we 
have 
C , = ^ + / ^ , J , ( l - A ) - | . 
(7.11) 
The problem is to minimize Z/^iQ subject to the constraint that all items 
should be produced in the common production facility. 
A first approach to solving the problem could be to disregard the capacity 
constraint and simply optimize each item separately as in Section 4.2. The 
optimal cycle time when disregarding the capacity constraint is

and the corresponding cost

(7.13) 
Note that (7.11) and (7.12) are equivalent to (4.6) and (4.7) if we replace T/ 
by Qi/d, 
Table 7.2 shows this "independent" solution of Bomberger's problem. 
The last row gives the corresponding production times per lot for each of the 
10 items.

The sum of the costs, C = ^^Jf^ Q =31.62, is evidently a lower bound for 
the total costs, since we have disregarded the capacity constraint. 
Is the solution feasible? No, it is relatively easy to see that the solution in 
Table 7.2 cannot be implemented. Consider, for example, items 4, 8, and 9. 
Assume that the production of item 9 starts at some time /. The production of 
the following batch will then start at time / + 61.5 etc. Since 09 = 11.20, the 
production facility is occupied by item 9 during the interval (t, t + 11.20). 
Items 4 and 8 have cycle times 19.5 and 20.5. This means that we must be 
able to produce one batch of item 4 and one batch of item 8 in the interval (/, 
t + 20.5). Given the production schedule for item 9, this implies that both 
items must be produced in {t + 11.20, t + 20.5). The length of this interval is 
only 9.30, while 04 + Og = 10.16. The independent solution can consequently 
not be implemented. 
7.2.1.3 Common cycle time 
Does a feasible solution exist? Note first that if at least one setup time is 
positive, an obvious necessary condition for a feasible solution to exist is 
that 

 
15 8 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
N 
E A < 1 - 
(7.14) 
The left-hand side of (7.14) is the ratio of the time the production facility 
must be busy (excluding setup time). Since we also need some time for the 
setups, we can see that (7.14) is necessary. (If all setup times are zero, (7.14) 
should be replaced by Y^tLiPi ^ 1 â¢) It is easy to verify that (7.14) is satisfied 
for Bomberger's problem. 
It turns out though, that the condition (7.14) is also sufficient for feasibil-
ity. If it is satisfied, it is always possible to find a feasible solution where all 
items have a common cycle time. Denote the common cycle time by T. Dur-
ing the cycle time we produce all items, each time in the same order. The 
production quantity for an item is the demand during the cycle time. By 
choosing T sufficiently large, we can reduce the ratio of the time needed for 
setups as much as we need. This explains why (7.14) is sufficient. 
Given the assumption of a common cycle time, the problem now is to 
minimize

i.e., it simply means a lower bound for the cycle time. 
If we disregard (7.17), the optimization of (7.15) is similar to (7.12) and

Since (7.15) is convex in T, the optimal solution, Topt, is obtained as 
T^p,=max(f,T^i^), 
(7.19) 
i.e., if r < T^^^ the best we can do is to choose Topt ^ T^tn-
For Bomberger's problem we obtain 7 = 42.75 and r^/â = 31.86, and 
consequently, T^^^ =T = 42.75 . This gives the costs C = 41.17 , which is an 
upper bound for the optimal solution since we have enforced the additional 
constraint that all cycle times have to be equal. 
At this stage we know that the optimal costs, C*, are in the interval 
C = 3\.62<C 
<C =41.17. For Bomberger's problem it is rather evident 
that the upper bound is not especially tight. If we look at the independent 
solution in Table 7.2, we can see that some of the cycle times are very differ-
ent, and we can therefore not expect a good solution with a common cycle 
time. For problems where the individual cycle times are reasonably similar, 
we can, on the other hand, expect the common cycle approach to give a very 
good approximation. 
We shall now consider two approaches for deriving better solutions. 
7.2.1.4 Bomberger's approach 
Bomberger (1966) generated feasible upper bound solutions by a relatively 
simple dynamic programming model. First it is assumed that each cycle time 
Ti is an integer multiple of a basic period W, i.e., Ti == riiW for some positive 
integer Â«/. Bomberger also makes the very restrictive assumption that W 
should be able to accommodate production of all items. To see that this con-
dition is not necessary, consider two items (item 1 and item 2), which both 
have Ti = Tj = 2W. We can then produce item 1 in periods 1, 3, 5 ... , and 
item 2 in periods 2, 4, 6 ..., and we will never have to produce both items in 
the same basic period. The condition will, however, obviously guarantee that 
the obtained solution is feasible. Let 

 
160 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Fi(w) = minimum cost of producing items / + 1, / + 2, ... , N when the 
available capacity in the basic period is w, i.e., W - w has been 
used for items 1,2,...,/. 
We now have 
F,_,(w) -min{C,(Â«,ff) + F,(>v-(T,)}, 
(7.20) 
where Ci{niW) are the costs (7.11) for item / with T/ == UiW, Ui = Si + piUiW, 
and the integer w/ is subject to the constraint 
l<ni <{w-Si)/PiW. 
(7.21) 
Note that the upper bound in (7.21) is equivalent to o;- < w. 
It is obvious that FM{W) = 0 for all w > 0. In the first step we determine 
pN-ii^) for a suitable grid of values of w > 0 from (7.20). Given Fj^.i{w), we 
can next determine FM-IQ^), etc. Fo(W) gives the minimum costs when the 
basic period is equal to W. In the final step we need to optimize FQ(W) with 
respect to W. Bomberger's solution of his example gave the costs C = 36.65 
for W= 40, Hi = 1 for i ^ 7, and rij = 3. This solution is a considerable im-
provement as compared to the common cycle approach. 
Bomberger's approach is simple and will always provide a feasible solu-
tion (if a feasible solution exists). Still, the assumption that ^should be able 
to accommodate production of all items is very restrictive. Later contribu-
tions (Elmaghraby, 1978, and Axsater, 1984, 1987), have improved the ap-
proach and provide considerably better solutions. 
7.2.1.5 A simple heuristic 
We shall now consider a completely different heuristic technique (essentially 
according to Doll and Whybark, 1973). The procedure means that we suc-
cessively improve the multipliers /i/ and the basic period W according to the 
following iterative procedure: 
1. Determine the independent solution and use the shortest cycle time as 
the initial basic period W. 
2. Given W, choose powers-of-two multipliers, (ni = 2"^, m> 0), to mini-
mize the item costs (7.11). 
3. Given the multipliers Â«/, minimize the total costs 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
161 
c^i(^-M,a-P,Kf] 
with respect to W. We obtain 
W = 
if^AJn, 
i=\ 
Y^kdii^-Pi)ni 
4. Go back to Step 2 unless the procedure has converged. In that case, 
check whether the obtained solution is feasible. If the solution is in-
feasible, try to adjust the multipliers and then go back to Step 3. 
The main disadvantage of the considered heuristic is that there is no 
guarantee for even a feasible solution. On the other hand, the computations 
are very easy. 
We shall apply the heuristic to Bomberger's problem. In Step 1 we start 
with the shortest cycle time in Table 7.2 as our basic period W "= 19.5. In 
Step 2 we obtain the powers-of-two multipliers Ux = 8, ^2 = 2, /^s = 2, ^24 = 1, 
Us = 2, /Z6 - 4, ill = S,ns = 1, Ug = 4, and riio = 2. In Step 3 we get W= 20.30. 
At this stage the algorithm has converged and we have to check whether the 
solution is feasible. We can see that this is not the case by using an argument 
which is very similar to the argument that we used to show that the inde-
pendent solution is infeasible. We consider again items 4, 8, and 9, and de-
termine 04 = 4.45, Og = 5.81, and 09 = 14.55. Consider a basic period when 
item 9 is produced. Since items 4 and 8 are produced in all basic periods, the 
production of all three items must take place in the considered basic period, 
i.e., during the time 20.30. This is obviously impossible. A major problem is 
the long production time for item 9. To reduce 09, we change rig from 4 to 2 
and start the iterations in Step 3. We get W= 23.42 and no more changes of 
the multipliers, see Table 7.3. 
It turns out that this solution is feasible, see Table 7.4. The total produc-
tion time is below W = 23.42 in each basic period. The total costs are C = 
32.07, i.e., very close to the lower bound. This is also the best known solu-
tion of the problem.

The solution in Table 7.4 is repeated every 8th period. Note that it is eas-
ier to check feasibility when using powers-of-two policies since the total cy-
cle time is usually relatively short. There are still, however, a large number 
of plans that correspond to the solution in Table 7.3. liui = 4, for example, 
we can produce item i in periods 1 and 5, or in periods 2 and 6, or in periods 
3 and 7, or in periods 4 and 8, i.e., there are 4 possibilities. More generally 
the number of possibilities for item / is equal to Ui. We can, however, without 
any lack of generality, always allocate one of the items with maximum rii, 
say item 1, in some arbitrary period. If, consequently, we disregard the allo-
cation of item 1, the number of remaining possibilities can be obtained as the 
product of the multipliers of the remaining items 2 - 10, i.e., 
2-2-1-2.4 â¢8-1 â¢2-2 = 1024. 
Although the classical economic lot scheduling problem involves only a 
single production facility, it can also be of interest in more general situa-
tions. For example, if there are several production facilities with limited ca-
pacities, it is quite common that one of the constraints constitutes the real 
bottleneck. It is then a reasonable approach to first derive a plan that only 
takes this constraint into account, and then in a second step, try to adapt the 
plan to other capacity limitations.

163 
A more detailed overview of different approaches to solving the problem 
is provided in Elmaghraby (1978). Feasibility issues are analyzed by Hsu 
(1983). 
7.2.1.6 Other problem formulations 
In Sections 7.2.1.1 - 7.2.1.5 we have considered the classical Economic Lot 
Scheduling Problem. Several papers have dealt with a variation of this prob-
lem. This more general formulation of the problem allows the lot sizes to 
vary over time. There is still a cycle time T, which is the overall period of 
the system. The schedule repeats itself every T units of time. Each item is 
produced during T but some items may be produced more than once. Fur-
thermore, the batch sizes of these runs may be different. See, for example, 
Dobson (1987), Roundy (1989), and Zipkin (1991). 
Gallego and Roundy (1992) allow backorders, while Gallego and Moon 
(1992) consider a situation where setup times can be exchanged by setup 
costs. 
There are also quite a few papers dealing with stochastic demand. In case 
of stochastic demand it is necessary to allow backorders and/or capacity 
variations, for example by using overtime production. See Sox et al. (1999) 
for a review. They classify the existing research approaches in two catego-
ries: cyclic sequencing and dynamic sequencing. The cyclic sequencing 
category uses a fixed cyclic schedule on the production facility, while the lot 
sizes are varied to meet demand variations. The cyclic schedule can, for ex-
ample, be obtained from a deterministic model. Dynamic sequencing means 
that both the production sequence and the lot sizes are varied. Examples of 
the cyclic sequencing approach are Gallego (1990), Bowman and Muckstadt 
(1993, 1995), and Federgruen and Katalan (1996a, b). Papers considering 
dynamic sequencing are e.g.. Graves (1980), and Sox and Muckstadt (1997). 
7.2.2 Time-varying demand 
12,2 A A generalization of the classical dynamic lot size problem 
Recall the classical dynamic lot size problem in Section 4.5. In this section 
we shall consider a generalization of this problem. Instead of a single item 
there are N items. Furthermore, these items are produced in the same ma-
chine, which has limited capacity. (The generalization to several machines is 
relatively straightforward.) For simplicity, it is assumed (as in Section 4.5) 
that all events take place in the beginning of a period. A quantity that is pro-
duced in period t can also be delivered to customers in period t. The de-

 
164 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
mands for different items are given but vary over time. No backorders are 
allowed. Let us introduce the following notation: 
A^ 
= number of items, 
T 
= number of periods, 
dit 
= demand for item i in period t, 
at 
= setup time for item /, 
bi 
= operation time per unit for item /, 
qt 
= available time in the machine in period t, 
Mij 
= upper bound for the production of item / in period t, 
Ai 
^ ordering or setup cost for item z, 
hi 
- holding cost per unit and time unit for item /, 
Xij 
= production quantity of item / in period t, 
yij 
= inventory of item / after the demand in period /, yio = 0, 
[0 otherwise, 
C 
== total variable costs. 
We wish to choose production quantities in different periods so that the sum 
of the ordering and holding costs C are minimized. The considered problem 
can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP).

We need the constraint (7.25) to enforce that production in a period implies 
that there is a corresponding setup time and setup cost. If there is no upper 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
165 
bound on Xij, we can let Mij be very large. In the sequel it is assumed that 
this is the case. 
Although the considered problem can be seen as a minor variation of the 
classical dynamic lot size problem, the model is quite complex. If, for exam-
ple A^== 100 and r = 12, there are 1200 integer variables and 2400 nonnega-
tive continuous variables. The number of constraints (7.23) - (7.25) is 2412. 
A possible approach is to eliminate the capacity constraints (7.23) by a 
Lagrangian relaxation. Let /L^ > 0 be the multiplier for period /. We get the 
Lagrangean: 
1 
/V 
1 
N 
T 
It is easy to see that the following proposition is true (Problem 7.7). 
Proposition 7.3 For any nonnegative multipliers L<C. 
Consider (7.27) together with the constraints (7.24) - (7.26). Because we 
have eliminated the capacity constraint (7.23) we can determine L by opti-
mizing each item separately for certain given multipliers. For item /, the 
problem that we need to solve is a generalized dynamic lot size problem (see 
Section 4.5) with a time-variable setup cost Ai + atXt and an additional time-
variable production cost per unit 6/ Xf Also this more general problem is 
easy to solve, e.g., by dynamic programming. 
If we want to get a tight lower bound for C we can solve the dual prob-
lem. 
D= 
max L. 
(7.28) 
In general, we will get a duality gap i.e., D < C because our MIP is noncon-
vex. A tight lower bound is very useful, though. We can, for example, check 
whether a heuristic feasible solution to the original problem gives a cost that 
is reasonably close to the lower bound. In that case we know that the ap-
proximate solution is acceptable. Furthermore, if we want to solve the origi-
nal problem by a branch-and-bound procedure, we can determine the needed 
associated lower bounds from the dual problem. 
Let us now consider another interesting approach for solving the problem 
(7.22) - (7.26). Note first that in an optimal solution of the considered prob-
lem all items must have ytj ~ 0. Otherwise we would just get unnecessary 
holding costs. Let us now focus on one of the items. (For simplicity, we sup-

 
166 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
press index /.) We shall say that a production plan, (X], X2, ... , XT), is de-
mand-feasible if all demands are satisfied without delays and the end stock is 
zero. It is easy to verify that the set of demand-feasible plans is convex, i.e., 
if two plans are demand-feasible, a convex combination of these plans is also 
demand-feasible (Problem 7.8). 
In Section 4.5 we showed that the optimal solution of the dynamic lot 
size problem must satisfy Property 1, meaning that the production in a pe-
riod must cover the demand in an integer number of consecutive periods. 
This is no longer true for our more general problem with a capacity con-
straint. However, it turns out that the set of such plans constitute the extreme 
points of the convex set of all demand-feasible plans. 
Proposition 7.4 The set of plans satisfying Property 1 constitute the extreme 
points of all demand-feasible plans. 
Proof Consider first a demand-feasible plan, which does not satisfy Property 
1. Then there must exist a period 7 such that the demand in this period is 
covered partly by the production in some period k <j\ and partly by the pro-
duction in period7. We denote this plan by x. Let she 3, small number and 
consider two other plans x^ and x " , which are almost identical to x. The 
only differences are that in x' we replace Xk by x^^ + Â«? and Xj by Xj - s, and in 
X " we replace Xk by Xj, - s and Xj by Xj + s. Clearly these plans are demand-
feasible provided s is sufficiently small. But x = {x^ + x")/2, so x is not an 
extreme point. 
Consider then the set of plans satisfying Property 1. Let x be such a plan 
and assume that it can be expressed as a convex combination of two other 
such plans y and z. We shall show that this assumption leads to a contradic-
tion. It follows that all periods without production in x must be without pro-
duction also iny and z. This means that the difference between jv (or z) and x 
is that some of the batches associated with x have been aggregated. (Recall 
that we by assumption cannot have the same batches.) Any given holding 
cost h> 0 will then give higher holding costs for 3; and z than for x. It is easy 
to see that this must then also be true for a convex combination of j^ and z. 
This is a contradiction and completes the proof. 
Proposition 7.4 implies that any demand-feasible plan can be expressed as a 
convex combination of plans satisfying Property 1. Let us now reintroduce 
index / for item z. Consider the plans for item / satisfying Property I and as-
sume that these plans are numbered in some way. Let i?/ be the total number 
of plans. (Ri < 2^'\ see Problem 7.9.) Furthermore, let 
Xij^r - production of item / in period t when using plan r,

(7.34) 
Although (7.29) is exact, the considered linear program is an approximation 
unless all Oir are 0 or 1. Assume, for example, that for item / we have 
di,\ = 9i,2 - 1/2, i.e., we are using a mixed strategy with weights 1/2 for plans 
1 and 2. Assume also that plan 1 has production in period t but not plan 2. 
According to (7.31) the setup cost in period t is only half of the correct setup 
cost, hi the same way we will underestimate the setup time in (7.32). 
Although, the linear program (7.31) - (7.34) is approximate, it turns out 
that the approximation in many important cases is very good. If we solve the 
linear program we will get a solution that has at most T + N nonzero vari-
ables, i.e., the number of constraints (excluding nonnegativity constraints).

Assume that there are m items that have more than one positive 6ir. The total 
number of nonzero variables is then less or equal to2m-^ N-m = m + N<T 
+ A^ so we get m<TAi 
there are many items and few time periods the frac-
tion of mixed strategies will be very small. Let, for example, A'^^ 500 and T 
= 5. We then have m < 5. This means that the fraction of items with mixed 
strategies is at most 1 percent. The resulting solution may not be optimal and 
may also be infeasible. Still, from a practical point of view, the solution is 
probably very good. The real capacity constraint is usually not that rigid. It 
may, for example, be possible to use some overtime. The resulting costs will 
be very close to the optimal costs. Note, however, that in case of a small A^ 
and a large Tthe considered model is of less interest. See, e.g.. Example 7.1 
below. 
The first model of this type was formulated by Manne (1958). 
Example 7.1 Consider a problem with two items and three periods. See Ta-
ble 7.5. There are no initial stocks. The available production capacity is 100 
time units per period. For both items the setup time is 15 time units and the 
operation time is one unit of time per unit. The holding cost is 1 per unit and 
time unit. There is no setup cost.

duction plans are (175/4, 25/4, 75) for item 1 and (20, 75, 0) for item 2. The 
optimal cost obtained from the linear program is 175/4. It is easy to see that 
the obtained solution is not feasible (Problem 7.10). 
7.2.2.2 Application of mathematical programming approaches 
Recently there has been a renewed interest in mathematical programming 
models for production-inventory planning. One reason is that such models 
are quite often included as so-called Advanced Planning Systems (APS) in 
modem Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. An overview of APS 
systems is given by Fleischmann and Meyr (2003). ERP systems are dis-
cussed in Section 8.2.4. 
As illustrated in Section 7.2.2.1, detailed models dealing with individual 
items are, in general, quite complex due to nonlinear setup times and costs. 
Still, it is possible to solve relatively large problems of this kind quite effi-
ciently. Shapiro (1993) gives an overview of these types of models. See also 
Billmgton et al. (1983) and Eppen and Martin (1987). 
One possibility to partly avoid the difficulties associated with setup times 
and setup costs is to use a hierarchical planning procedure. This means that 
the planning is carried out at two (or more) hierarchical levels. This is in line 
with standard industrial planning procedures. At an upper level an aggregate 
problem is considered. This problem concerns aggregate entities like product 
groups and machine groups. At the lower level the aggregate plan is disag-
gregated into a detailed plan for individual items and machines. The disag-
gregation is usually carried out by a simple heuristic procedure. In a model 
representing the aggregate level, it is usually necessary and reasonable to 
disregard the nonlinearities because they are associated with individual 
items. It is consequently possible to use linear programming. Furthermore, 
the number of variables and constraints are reduced by considering product 
groups and machine groups instead of individual items and machines. There-
fore the model becomes less complex. 
An overview of hierarchical planning models is given by Bitran and Tiru-
pati (1993). See also the discussion of different planning concepts in De Kok 
and Fransoo (2003). 
7.2.3 Production smoothing and batcti quantities 
In many situations it is not practical to smooth production by active coordi-
nation of the replenishments. If, for example, the demands of different items 
are varying substantially over time, it is difficult to smooth production by 
using cyclic schedules. It may still be an important goal to avoid excessive 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
171 
queues in production, though. A remaining possibiHty is to try to adjust the 
batch quantities in order to obtain a reasonably smooth load. 
Many companies have found that smaller order quantities may smooth 
the production load and reduce the queues in production. There is a simple 
explanation for this. If the orders arriving to production can be seen as a sto-
chastic process, smaller batches will reduce the variations over time due to 
the laws of large numbers. The load during a certain time is then built up of a 
larger number of smaller batches. If the orders are more or less independent, 
this will clearly smooth the load. On the other hand, we cannot use order 
quantities that are too small, since this will mean that the setup times will 
take too much of the available capacity into account and increase the queues. 
As usual, we have to find a suitable middle way. 
The models which we have dealt with in Chapters 4 - 6 do not address 
these types of questions. In these models it is assumed that the lead-time is 
constant, or that the lead-time distribution is given but independent of the 
batch quantity. But from our discussion it is obvious that there are situations 
when this is not true and the lot sizes strongly affect the lead-time distribu-
tion. There are some lot-sizing models that explicitly take the queuing situa-
tion in production into account. We shall consider a simple such model es-
sentially according to Karmarkar (1987, 1993). See also Axsater (1980, 
1986), Bertrand (1985), and Zipkin (1986). 
Consider a machine in a large multi-center shop. This machine is used for 
producing a number of similar items having the same batch size. We define 
d = average total demand for all items, units per time unit, 
p = average processing rate, units per time unit, 
Q = batch quantity for an item, 
s = setup time for a batch, 
T = average time in the system for a batch. 
We shall, for simplicity, assume that the batches arrive at the machine as 
a Poisson process with rate A = d/Q. This is a reasonable approximation if 
there are relatively many items. Let us also, for simplicity, think of the proc-
essing time as exponentially distributed. The average processing time for a 
batch is \/K= S + Q/p and the service factor p= A/K= dslQ + dip. The aver-
age time in the considered (M/M/1) queuing system is then 
\-p 
\-dslQ-dlp 

 
172 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Note that we must require p < 1, or equivalently, Q > dsl{\ - dip), i.e., the 
cycle time must on average accommodate both the setup time and the opera-
tion time. 
By minimizing the average time in the system, 7, with respect to Q, it is 
possible to show that the minimum occurs for 
ds 
sJdp 
l~d/p 
l-d/p 
The average time in the system is large both when using batch quantities 
that are too small and when using batch quantities that are too large. When 
the batch quantities are too small the setup times will require too much ca-
pacity. When the batch quantities are too large the production time for a 
batch is long and there are also more stochastic variations in the production 
load, which will cause longer queuing times. 
If we wish to minimize the sum of holding costs for work-in-process we 
should, in the considered case, use Q according to (7.43). However, there are 
also other objectives when choosing the batch size. For example, there are 
holding costs for stocks of completed items. There may also be ordering 
costs. The holding costs for completed items are clearly affected by the re-
plenishment lead-time. We can see (7.42) as the lead-time (or part of the 
lead-time) when modeling the stocks of completed items. (This means that 
we disregard that the lead-time is stochastic.) Doing so, we can include 
holding costs for both work-in-process and the stocks of completed items in 
the same model when determining batch quantities and reorder points. 
Note that the average time in the system for a batch is, in steady state, not 
affected by the reorder points for completed items. 
7.3 Joint replenishments 
In Section 7.2 we have considered situations where we want to have orders 
for different items spread out over time in order to get a smooth production 
load. In this section we shall deal with the opposite problem, i.e., we shall 
consider a group of items which should be replenished jointly as much as 
possible. As we have discussed previously, there are several possible reasons 
for joint replenishments, for example, joint setup costs, quantity discounts, 
coordinated transports, etc. 
The methods for determination of batch quantities and reorder points that 
we have dealt with in Chapters 4 - 6 are evidently not directly applicable in 
case of joint replenishments. If there is a joint setup cost, for example, we 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
173 
wish to have a total order size that is sufficiently large while the individual 
lot sizes may be of less importance. We would also like to choose the batch 
sizes such that we have reasonable possibilities to coordinate future orders. 
Furthermore, we can normally not use reorder points that have been deter-
mined individually. Assume that the individual reorder points correspond to 
a certain service level that we would like to maintain. If we make a joint re-
plenishment as soon as one of the items reaches its reorder point, other items 
will be ordered too early. This means that the service level (and the holding 
costs) will be higher than what was intended. 
7.3.1 A deterministic model 
A common way of modeling joint replenishment problems is to assume that 
there are two types of ordering or setup costs: individual setup costs for each 
item, and a joint setup cost for the whole group of items. The joint setup cost 
does not depend on the number of items that are ordered. We shall first con-
sider such a model with constant continuous demand. No backorders are al-
lowed. The cycle times, or equivalently the batch quantities, are constant. 
The production time can be disregarded. We can also without any lack of 
generality disregard the lead-times, provided they are the same for all items. 
Let us introduce the following notation: 
A^ = number of items, 
hi = holding cost per unit and time unit for item /, 
A = setup cost for the group, 
ai = setup cost for item /, 
di = demand per time unit for item /, 
Ti = cycle time for item /. 
The problem is to determine cycle times in order to minimize the sum of 
holding and setup costs. Given a cycle time T/, the corresponding batch 
quantity Qi is obtained as Qi = Tidt. To simplify the notation we shall replace 
the holding costs hi by rji = hidi, and set all demands equal to one. It is easy 
to check that this will not change the problem. (See Problem 7.12.) Further-
more, we assume for simplicity, that the items are ordered so that ai/r/i < 
a2/r/2< ... < a^/r/M. We shall consider two approaches to solve the problem. 
The first approach is a simple iterative technique. The second one is based 
on Roundy's 98 percent approximation. 

 
174 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
7,3.1.1 Approach 1. An iterative technique 
If there were no joint setup cost the optimal cycle times could be determined 
by the classical economic lot size formula as: 
Ti-}^. 
(7.44) 
V Vi 
i.e., T\ would be the smallest cycle time. A natural approach to solving the 
problem is therefore to assume that the cycle times of items 2, 3, ... , A^ are 
integer multiples Â«/ of the cycle time for item 1, or equivalently, 
T,^n,T,, 
i = 2,3,...,N,

Given n2, n^, ... , n^, the optimal Ti and the corresponding costs are ob-

Note that T* is not chosen according to (7.44). 
If we disregard that ^2, n^, ... , n^ have to be integers and optimize the 
costs (7.48), it is possible to show (Problem 7.13) that: 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
175 
^^ 
(7.49) 
Inserting (7.49) in (7.48) we get the following lower bound for the costs: 
N 1 
i=2 
C = V2(^ + ai)?7i+XV2^- 
(7-50) 
The lower bound (7.50) can also be understood in the following way. As-
sume that there is no joint setup cost but that the individual setup cost for 
item 1 is ^ + ai. If we optimize each item separately we obtain the total costs 
(7.50). But the considered problem is clearly a relaxation of the original 
problem since we can have setups of items 2, 3, ... , A^ without any joint 
setup cost. Consequently (7.50) is a lower bound for the total costs. 
We are now ready to formulate a heuristic for the original problem where 
112, n^, ... ,n^ are integers. 
1. Determine start values of n2, n^, ... , n^ by rounding (7.49) to the closest 
positive integers. 
2. Determine the corresponding Ti from (7.47). 
3. Given Tu minimize (7.46) with respect to ^2, ^3, â¢â¢â¢ , ^N- This means that 
we are choosing rii as the smallest positive integer satisfying: 
n,(n,+l)>-^. 
(7.51) 
Return to Step 2 if any multiplier rii has changed since the last iteration. 
Since the procedure gives an improvement in each step it will obviously 
converge, but not necessarily to the optimal solution. The resulting costs can 
be compared to the lower bound (7.50). 
Example 7.2 Consider A^= 4 items with a joint setup cost A = 300. The indi-
vidual setup costs are ai = a2 = a3 = a4 = 50, and the holding costs are hi = hj 
= h3 = h4= 10. The demands per time unit are di = 5000, ^2 = 1000, ds = 700, 
and (^4 = 100. Note that in this case /// = hidt = lOJ/. As requested, ai/r/i is 
nondecreasing with /. When applying the heuristic we obtain:

3. We again obtain the multipliers n2= I, n^ = I, n4 = 3, i.e., the algorithm 
has already converged. 
We get the resulting costs from (7.48) as C = 8082.9, which can be com-
pared to the lower bound according to (7.50) C = 8069.0. 
Related procedures are described in e.g., Goyal and Satir (1989), and Sil-
ver et al. (1998). A technique for finding a solution with an arbitrarily small 
deviation from the optimal value is given by Wildeman et al. (1997). 
7.3.1.2 Approach 2. Roundy's 98 percent approximation 
We shall now look for a solution where the joint setups have cycle time To > 
0, and all other cycle times are nonnegative powers-of-two times To, i.e., 
r,=2''To, 
/= 1,2, ...,7V, 
(7.52) 
where ki is a nonnegative integer. Using the notation ao = A, and r/o = 0, we 
can express our objective as: 
min 
/ 
(7.53) 
subject to the constraints (7.52). This means that we let the joint setups be 
represented by a fictive item 0. 
Let us now relax the considered problem by replacing (7.52) by 
r,>ro, 
/= 1,2, ...,7V. 
(7.54) 
It is a relaxation because (7.52) implies (7.54) while the opposite is not true. 
The resulting solution will therefore give a lower bound for the costs. 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
177 
Consider the relaxed problem, i.e., (7.53), with respect to the constraints 
(7.54). Since the objective function is convex and the constraints are linear, 
we can get the solution from the following Lagrangean relaxation: 
max 
mm 
> V 
2 
^T,j + Y,^i(To-T,), 
(7.55) 
where the multipliers 2/ are also required to be nonnegative. Let us define: 
^0 =r/Q+2^Ai 
, 
/=i 
T][= 7/1 
-IJiu 
(7.56) 
It is easy to see that the optimal solution must have all 77 â¢ > 0. Otherwise Tt 
â> 00, which is obviously not optimal. 
Given the multipliers, the optimal solution of the relaxed problem can be 
obtained by solving: 
mm T 
(7.57) 
without any constraints on the cycle times, i.e., we have N -^ I independent 
classical lot sizing problems. 
Let us now go back to the original joint replenishment problem but with 
cost parameters ai and 77-. Consider the effect of 1/ on the holding costs. The 
holding cost of item / is reduced by 2/Li and the holding cost of item 0 is in-
creased by 2/1/. This will mean a cost reduction for any solution of the joint 
replenishment problem, even if we allow the periods between orders to vary 
over time. To see this, consider the period between two orders for item / > 0. 
If there are additional joint setups between the two orders the total holding 
costs during the considered period will decrease, otherwise they will be the 
same. 

 
178 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
But given the cost parameters ai and ri\ ,(1,51) will obviously provide the 
minimum cost since no constraints are considered. The optimal solution of 
the relaxed problem will consequently give a lower bound for the costs of 
any solution. This bound is tighter than (7.50) because of the constraints 
(7.54). 
Assume that we have solved the relaxed problem. We can then adjust this 
solution by rounding the cycle times so that they can be expressed as: 
T^ ^I'^'q 
(7.58) 
for some number ^ > 0. We know from Proposition 7.1 in Section 7.1 that if 
q is given, the maximum cost increase is at most 6 percent, and if we can 
also adjust q to get a better approximation, the cost increase is at most 2 per-
cent according to Proposition 7.2. Due to (7.54), we know that m/ > WQ and 
the cycle times obtained must consequently satisfy (7.52). We have now ob-
tained Roundy's solution of the problem. This solution has an important 
quality. The cost increase compared to the optimal solution is at most 2 per-
cent, since it is at most 2 percent compared to the lower bound (7.57). 
It is possible to use the considered Lagrangean relaxation for numerical 
determination of Roundy's solution, but in general, it is much simpler to use 
the following technique. Since the items are ordered so that ajrii are nonde-
creasing with / for i > 0, it is obvious from (7.53) and (7.54) that the optimal 
cycle times in the relaxed problem are nondecreasing with / for / > 0. It is 
also clear that we must have Ti == TQ in the optimal solution of the relaxed 
problem because aQ = A, and r/o = 0. This means that 
r, >r,_i, 
/= 1,2, ...,7V. 
(7.59) 
Consider the relaxed problem with (7.54) replaced by (7.59). This will 
not change the optimal solution. Without the constraints (7.59) it would be 
optimal to use T^ = {lajri^^^^ for all /. Consequently, if ai/r/i is increasing 
with /, we have found the optimal solution since the resulting batch quanti-
ties will satisfy (7.59). Since ?]o = 0 this is never the case initially. Assume 
that for some z, a//// < a/.i/^/.i, or equivalently that 7j- <T^_i. Assume 
furthermore that in the optimal solution Ti > T/.i. Because of the convexity 
this implies that 7/ <T^ since we would otherwise reduce T/, and similarly 
that Ti_i > Ti_i since we would otherwise increase T/.i. But this means that T/ 
< T/.i which is a contradiction. Consequently, Ti = Ti.\ in the optimal solution 
of the relaxed problem. But this implies that we can aggregate items / - 1 and 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
179 
/ into a single item with cost parameters a/.i + a,-, and T/M + 7/. Next we con-
sider the resulting reduced problem with one item less. If ajrii < aiJrji.i for 
some / we can aggregate the two items, otherwise we obtain the optimal so-
lution from the classical economic lot size model, etc. 
Since T/O = 0 we will always aggregate items 0 and 1. After aggregation 
we have an item with cost parameters A + a\ and //i. Next we check whether 
ci2lri2 < (^ + ai)l 7]i. If this is the case the aggregate item should include also 
item 2, etc. When no more aggregations are possible, we can optimize the re-
sulting aggregate items individually. 
Example 7.3 Consider the same data as in Example 7.2, i.e., 7V= 4, ^ = 300, 
ai = ^2 = ^3 = ^4 = 50, /71 = 50000, 772 = 10000, 73 = 7000, and 74 = 1000. 
To solve the relaxed problem we first aggregate items 0 and 1. The com-
bined item has cost parameters A^ ai = 350, and riQ+ r]i = 50000. Consider 
then item 2. Since a2/772 = 50/10000 < 350/50000, item 2 should also be 
added to the combined item. The resulting cost parameters are obtained as A 
+ ai + a2 = 400, and //o + 7i + 72 = 60000. Consider item 3. Since 50/7000 
> 400/60000, item 3 should not be added. Compare finally item 4 and item 3. 
We get 50/1000 > 50/7000, i.e., items 3 and 4 should not be combined. This 
gives the cycle times To = Ti = T2 = (800/60000)^^^ = 0.1155, T^ = 
(100/7000)'^' - 0.1195, and T4 = (100/1000)'^' = 0.3162. The resulting lower 
bound for the costs is C= C0+K2 + C3 + C4 =- 6928.2 + 836.7 + 316.2 -
8081.1. Note that this bound is better than the bound obtained in Example 
7.2. 
Consider then cycle times that can be expressed as powers of two, i.e., let 
q=lm 
(7.58). We obtain To = Ti = T2 = 2'^ = 0.125, T^ = 2'^ = 0.125, and T4 
= 2'^ = 0.250. The resulting costs are C = Co+1+2 + C3 + C4 = 6950 + 837.5 + 
325 = 8112.5, i.e., 0.39 percent above the lower bound. 
By minimization of (7.10) it is possible to show that it is optimal to have 
q = 1.88 in (7.58). The corresponding cycle times are TQ = Ti = T2 = 2''^q = 
0.1175, T2 = T^q = 0.1175, and T4 = T^q = 0.235. The resulting costs are C = 
Co+1+2 + C3 + C4 = 6929.3 + 836.8 + 330.3 = 8096.3, i.e., 0.19 percent above 
the lower bound. The solution in Example 7.2, which is not a powers-of-two 
policy, is still slightly better. 
A similar approach is used for multi-stage lot sizing in Section 9.2.2. See 
also Jackson et al. (1985), Roundy (1985, 1986), and Muckstadt and Roundy 
(1993). 
The two approaches considered assume constant demand, but can also be 
used in case of stochastic demand. We then replace the stochastic demands 
by their means when determining cycle times. Given the cycle times we can,

INVENTORY CONTROL 
using the techniques in Section 5.12, detennine appropriate periodic review 
S pohcies for each item. The order-up-to inventory positions should include 
suitable amounts of safety stock. Next, in Section 7.3.2, we will consider a 
different model that is more directly focused on stochastic demand. 
7.3.2 A stochastic model 
We shall now instead consider a stochastic model. The demands for the 
items are independent and stationary stochastic processes. Each customer 
demand is for an integral number of units. We can, for example, consider 
Poisson or compound Poisson demand processes. We assume complete 
backordering. Let us introduce the following notation to describe the prob-
lem: 
A^ 
= number of items, 
hi 
= holding cost per unit and time unit for item /, 
bij 
= shortage cost per unit and time unit for item /, 
A 
= setup cost for the group, 
Ui 
= setup cost for item z, 
L 
= constant lead-time. 
Viswanathan (1997) suggests the following technique that, in his numeri-
cal tests, outperforms other suggested methods. 
Li the first step we disregard the joint setup cost and consider the items 
individually for a suitable grid of review periods T. For each review period 
we determine the optimal individual (s, S) policies for all items and the cor-
responding average costs. This can be done very efficiently as explained in 
Section 6.1.1.2 Let 
Ci{T) = average costs per time unit for item i when using the optimal 
individual (s, S) policy with a review interval of T time units. 
In the second step we determine the review period Thy minimizing, 
N 
C(T) = A/T + Y,Ci{T), 
(7.60) 
Note that the actual costs are lower than the costs according to (7.60), 
since the major setup cost A is not incurred at reviews where none of the 
items are ordered. 

 
CORDINATED ORDERING 
181 
Atkins and lyogun (1988) also use periodic review policies but in a dif-
ferent way. 
Other policies that have been used frequently in the inventory literature 
are so-called can-order policies. When using such a policy there are two re-
order points for each item: a can-order level and a lower must-order level. 
An item must be ordered when its inventory position reaches the must-order 
level. When an item in the group is ordered, other items with inventory posi-
tions at or below their respective can-order levels are also ordered. This type 
of policy was first suggested by Balintfy (1964). Techniques for designing 
can-order policies have been suggested by Silver (1981) and Federgruen et 
al. (1984). 
Renberg and Planche (1967) suggested a so-called {Si, Q) policy. Accord-
ing to this policy all items are replenished up to certain levels Si when the 
total demand for the whole group since the preceding replenishment has 
reached Q.

8 MULTI-ECHELON SYSTEMS: 
STRUCTURES AND 
ORDERING POLICIES 
So far we have considered a single installation. In practice, though, it is also 
common to see multi-stage, or multi-echelon, inventory systems, where a 
number of installations are coupled to each other. For example, when dis-
tributing products over large geographical areas, many companies use an in-
ventory system with a central warehouse close to the production facility and 
a number of local stocking points close to the customers in different areas. 
Similarly, in production, stocks of raw materials, components, and finished 
products are coupled to each other. To obtain efficient control of such in-
ventory systems it is necessary to use special methods that take the connec-
tion between different stocks into account. In Chapters 8 - 10 we will show 
when and how such methods can be used. 
The interest in Supply Chain Management in general, and for multi-eche-
lon inventory control in such chains, is growing rapidly. The management of 
multi-echelon inventory systems is a crucial part of supply chain operations. 
Furthermore, the possibilities for efficient control of multi-echelon inventory 
systems have increased substantially during the last two decades. One reason 
is the progress in research, which has resulted in new techniques that are 
both more general and more efficient. Another reason is new information 
technologies which have created a completely different infrastructure and 
greatly increased the possibilities for efficient supply chain coordination. 
Examples of such new technologies are EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), 
satellite communication systems, and RFID (Radio Frequency Identifica-
tion). 

 
188 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Multi-echelon inventory systems in supply chains are not always part of a 
single company. Quite often, different companies work together to improve 
the coordination of the total material flow. An example is the implementa-
tion of so-called VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) systems. 
8.1 Inventory systems in distribution and production 
Multi-echelon inventory systems are common in both distribution and pro-
duction. When analyzing such systems it is important to understand that in-
ventory systems which may physically appear to be very different can still 
be very similar in an inventory control context. Consider for example the 
two installations in Figure 8.1. The customer demand takes place at installa-
tion 1. Installation 1 is replenished from installation 2, which in turn, re-
plenishes from an outside supplier. 
In a distribution system, installation 1 can be a local sales stock in a dis-
tant country, while installation 2 is a central warehouse close to the factory. 
The replenishment lead-time at installation 1 is then essentially the trans-
portation time. 
In production, installation 1 may be the stock of a final product while in-
stallation 2 is the stock of a subassembly which is used when producing the 
final product. In this case the stocks contain different items, yet the coupling 
is the same. In both situations installation 1 can be seen as a customer at in-
stallation 2. In the production situation the replenishment lead-time at in-
stallation 1 is essentially the production time, and the two stocks may very 
well be situated in the same building. 
Figure 8.1 An inventory system with two coupled inventories. 
8.1.1 Distribution inventory systems 
Distribution inventory systems are, in general, divergent, i.e., the number of 
parallel installations increase along the material flow. In a pure distribution 
system, or arborescent system, each stock has at most a single immediate 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
189 
predecessor. Figure 8.2 shows such a system with two levels: a central ware-
house, and a number of retailers. 
Central warehouse 
Retailers 
Figure 8.2 Distribution inventory system. 
In the special case when each installation has also at most one immediate 
successor, as in Figure 8.1, we have a serial system. 
The stocks at the retailers in Figure 8.2 are needed to maintain a high ser-
vice at different local markets. The central warehouse supports all retailers. 
More stock at the central warehouse will give shorter and less variable lead-
times for the retailers, and this can enable the retailers to reduce their stocks. 
On the other hand, the holding costs at the central warehouse will increase. 
The best distribution of the total system stock will depend on the structure of 
the system, the demand variations, the transportation times, and the unit 
costs. Situations exist when there should be a relatively large stock at the 
central warehouse, but it is more common that the optimal solution means a 
very low warehouse stock, much lower than what most practitioners would 
expect. 
8.1.2 Production inventory systems 
Inventory systems in production may also sometimes have a structure like 
that in Figure 8.2. Such systems are especially common in process indus-
tries, but also occur quite frequently at the end of the production chain in 

 
190 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
mechanical industries. The central warehouse in Figure 8.2 can then corre-
spond to the stock of a subassembly that is used as a basic module when 
producing a number of different end products. The stocks of these end prod-
ucts correspond to the retailer stocks in Figure 8.2. 
In production it is more common, though, to have inventory systems with 
many parallel stocking locations early in the material flow and successively 
fewer stocks later in the flow, i.e., a convergent flow. If each installation has 
at most one immediate successor, as in Figure 8.3, we have an assembly 
system. Note that a serial system is also a special case of an assembly sys-
tem. 
Figure 8.3 An assembly system. 
For an assembly system there also exist various reasons for keeping stock 
early in the material flow. Raw materials and components early in the flow 
usually have much lower values than subassemblies and final products at the 
end of the flow. This means that the holding costs are lower. Sometimes high 
setup costs in early production stages may also make it necessary to use 
large batch quantities. 
It is, in general, considerably easier to deal with serial systems than with 
other types of multi-echelon systems. Some results for serial systems how-
ever, can be generalized to pure distribution systems or assembly systems. In 
production it is very common, though, to also encounter more general in-
ventory systems which are much more difficult to handle. Figure 8.4 shows 
such a system. Note that a facility can have several successors as well as 
several predecessors. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
191 
For a certain multi-echelon inventory system in production there exists an 
equivalent bill of material, or product structure. In Figure 8.4, stock 1 can be 
seen as the stock of a final product that is produced from items 2 and 3. Item 
2 is produced from items 4 and 5 etc. The complete bill of material corre-
sponding to Figure 8.4 is shown in Figure 8.5.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
In production, it is also common that we need more than one unit of a 
component when producing some other item. For example, item 1 may con-
sist of two units of item 2 and three units of item 3. For serial and assembly 
systems this does not add to the complexity. Since an item can only be part 
of a single item we can always redefine the unit so that we always need ex-
actly one unit of a lower level item. If, for example, a certain item contains 
two units of some other item, we can let two units of this item be the new 
unit. But we cannot handle a general system in this way. To see this, con-
sider again Figure 8.5. It may happen that item 2 contains two units of item 5 
while item 3 contains three units of the same item. We cannot circumvent 
this difficulty by redefining the unit. 
8.13 Repairable items 
In this book we deal with consumable items. However, it is interesting to 
note that repairable items can in many situations be handled in essentially 
the same way. Some of the early important work concerning multi-echelon 
inventory systems (e.g., Sherbrooke, 1968) was focused on repairable items, 
which are especially common in military applications. 
To illustrate the relationship between consumable and repairable items, 
consider again Figure 8.2. Assume that the stocks contain repairable spare 
items which can replace items that fail. Furthermore, assume that all replen-
ishments are one-for-one. When an item fails it is sent to the central site for 
repair. It is then stocked at the central site. The failed item is, if possible, re-
placed by another item at the local site. If no item is available, the item is 
backordered. In any case a new item is ordered from the central site. Con-
sider then a corresponding system with consumable items. The only differ-
ence is the warehouse lead-time. In the case of consumable items, this lead-
time is given or has a given distribution. In the case of repairable items, the 
corresponding warehouse lead-time is the transportation time from a local 
site plus the repair time. By using this equivalence we can use models and 
techniques for consumable items for repairable items as well. 
A review of repairable item inventory control is given by Nahmias 
(1981). 
8.1.4 Lateral transshipments in inventory systems 
Consider again the distribution inventory system in Figure 8.2. We can say 
that the advantage of the central warehouse is that it enables pooling of 
stock. The stock in the warehouse can be used by any of the retailers. But 
pooling of stock can also be obtained by other inventory systems. One possi-

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
193 
bility is to use so-called lateral transshipments between parallel local stock 
points. Consider Figure 8.6. 
Figure 8.6 Lateral transshipments between parallel stocks. 
The local stocks normally replenish from an outside supplier, for example by 
applying (i?, Q) policies. But in emergency situations it is also possible to 
use lateral transshipments between adjacent retailers. These transshipments 
are faster but incur additional costs. Such lateral transshipments are common 
in practice. Models with lateral transshipments are usually more difficult to 
handle, and the available results are less general. 
There are two problems associated with lateral transshipments: 
1. What is a suitable decision rule for deciding on the source and size of 
a lateral transshipment? 
2. Given a certain decision rule for lateral transshipments, how can this 
policy be evaluated and how does it affect the policy for normal reple-
nishments? 
Many of the earlier papers dealing with lateral transshipments consider 
the second problem and assume that some simple decision rule is given. A 
frequent assumption is that a demand at a local stock point that can not be 
met by stock on hand is, if possible, supplied by a lateral transshipment from 
some other stock point with inventory on hand. Examples of such ap-
proaches are Lee (1987), Axsater (1990), Dada (1992), Alfredsson and Ver-
rijdt (1999), Grahovac and Chakravarty (2001), Kukreja et al. (2001), Sher-
brooke (1992), Muckstadt (2005), and Vidgren (2005). 
A possible approach when trying to optimize decisions concerning lateral 
transshipments (Problem 1) is to use stochastic dynamic programming. See 

 
194 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
e.g., Das (1975), Robinson (1990), Archibald et al. (1997), and Olsson 
(2005). Tagaras and Cohen (1992) evaluate different decision rules by 
simulation. Given the policy for normal replenishments, the decision rule in 
Axsater (2003) provides a performance guarantee; it will always lead to an 
improvement compared to not using lateral transshipments. Another heuris-
tic decision rule is suggested by Minner et al. (2003). Rudi et al. (2001) con-
sider decentralized decisions concerning transshipments and determine 
transshipment prices that lead to joint-profit maximization. We shall not dis-
cuss lateral transshipments any further in this book. 
Problems concerning transshipments are related to problems with substi-
tutions. See e.g., Bassok et al. (1999) and the references therein for a further 
discussion of such problems. 
Another related problem area is emergency deliveries (from the supplier) 
in an inventory system. See e.g., Moinzadeh and Nahmias (1988), Johansen 
and Thorstenson (1998), Minner (2003), and Axsater (2005). 
8.1.5 Inventory models with remanufacturing 
It has become more and more common to use production-inventory systems 
where manufacturing and remanufacturing operations occur simultaneously. 
For example, it may be possible to process used components of certain prod-
ucts so that they satisfy the same quality standards as new components. This 
means that new components can be replaced by remanufactured used com-
ponents when available. See Figure 8.7. 
Demands 
Returns 
Figure 8.7 Production-inventory systenn with remanufacturing. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
195 
There are several motivations for such manufacturing systems. One im-
portant reason is new regulations that force manufacturing companies to 
collect and handle used products after customer usage. Another reason is that 
remanufacturing processes tend to become more competitive. 
Remanufacturing policies will lead to inventory systems with coupled in-
ventories. The demands as well as the returns are usually stochastic proc-
esses. It is obvious that the control of the system in Figure 8.7 involves many 
complex questions. For example, what does a suitable production strategy 
look like, and how much safety stock is needed in the two stocks? 
The literature dealing with such inventory models is growing rapidly. See 
e.g., Van der Laan et al. (1998), Van der Laan et al. (1999), Guide et al. 
(2003), Dekker et al. (2004), and the references therein. 
8.2 Different ordering systems 
For a single-echelon system we know that an (s, S) policy is optimal under 
very general conditions. Some optimality results exist for serial systems, see 
Clark and Scarf (1960), Chen (2000), and Muharremoglu and Tsitsiklis 
(2003). But for most multi-echelon systems the structure of the optimal pol-
icy is unknown. Generally we can expect an optimal control policy for a 
multi-echelon inventory system to be quite complex. An optimal decision to 
send a batch from one site to another site may depend on the inventory status 
at all sites. Such a centralized decision system is usually associated with sev-
eral disadvantages. A lot of information is needed and although information 
technology has improved dramatically, the data movement will lead to addi-
tional costs. Furthermore, completely general centralized policies are diffi-
cult to derive. It is therefore usually more suitable to limit the degree of cen-
tralization and use relatively simple local control rules that are similar to 
policies used in single-echelon systems. Multi-level methods mean then that 
we try to coordinate such local decision rules in a suitable way. It is common 
to use simple reorder point policies in multi-echelon inventory systems, for 
example. Our problem may then be to find reorder points for the different 
facilities that will give a satisfactory coordinating control of the system as a 
whole. 
The need to decentralize the control is generally larger in a distribution 
system than in a production system. Within distribution, different facilities 
are normally situated at locations far from each other, and quite often rela-
tively independent organizational units make the replenishment decisions. 
Also for multi-echelon systems we can choose between continuous re-
view and periodic review. In Section 7.2 we have discussed the possibility of 
using periodic review systems in order to smooth the production load. This 

 
196 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
is, of course, also a possibility when dealing with multi-echelon inventory 
systems. Furthermore, there can be other similar reasons for using periodic 
review in connection with multi-echelon systems. Consider, for example, the 
distribution system in Figure 8.2. If the four retailers use periodic review 
systems with a review period of four weeks, and with different ordering 
weeks, the demand at the central warehouse will be very smooth. This will 
simplify the inventory control and also lead to a smooth production load in 
the factory delivering to the warehouse. 
In this section we will describe different common ordering systems and 
show how they are related to each other. The ordering systems are all quite 
simple, but regardless of which ordering system we choose, it is difficult to 
determine suitable control parameters like batch quantities and safety stocks. 
We shall deal with these questions in Chapters 9 and 10. 
8.2.1 Installation stock reorder point policies and 
KANBAN policies 
One common way to control a multi-echelon inventory system is to control 
each facility by an (R, Q) policy or by an S policy. Recall that for discrete 
integral demand an S policy is a special case of an (i?, Q) policy where R = S 
- 1 and Q=\. The reorder points and batch quantities do not, of course, need 
to be the same for different facilities. As we have described in Section 3.2.3, 
each facility considers its own inventory position, i.e., stock on hand plus 
outstanding orders and minus backorders. When the inventory position de-
clines to or below R, a batch of size Q (or possibly a number of batches) is 
ordered so that the new inventory position is above R and less or equal to R 
+ Q. 
As we shall describe in Section 8.2.2, it is also common to use a different 
type of reorder point policy in multi-echelon inventory systems. When using 
this modified reorder point policy, the inventory position is defined in an-
other way and not based only on the stock at the installation. To avoid mis-
interpretation the normal (i?, Q) policy is therefore often denoted installation 
stock (i?, 0 policy in connection with multi-echelon inventory control. 
As pointed out above, the optimality of the {s, S) policy for single-eche-
lon systems does not, in general, carry over to multi-echelon systems. There-
fore it is more common to let the installations use the somewhat simpler (7?, 
Q) policy in a multi-echelon setting. 
It is also common to apply KANBAN policies in multi-echelon systems. 
As described in Section 3.2.3.1, a KANBAN policy can be interpreted as an 
installation stock (i?, Q) policy where backorders are not subtracted from the 
inventory position. This means that the number of KANBANs is an upper 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERE^G 
197 
bound for the number of outstanding orders and will limit work-in-process, 
which is sometimes an advantage, see Veatch and Wein (1994) and Spear-
man et al. (1990). 
8.2.2 Echelon stock reorder point policies 
Consider the inventory system and the corresponding product structures in 
Figure 8.8. 
1 
2(1) 
3 
4(3) 
4(2) 
Figure 8.8 Inventory system and corresponding product structures. 
We use a number in parenthesis to illustrate the number of units contained in 
the higher level item. For example, 2 units of item 4 are used as components 
when producing one unit of item 2. Similarly, 3 units of item 4 are needed 
when producing one unit of item 3. 
Consider the stock of item 4. If the inventory position is low, it is clearly 
an indication that we might need to replenish. But on the other hand, if the 
stocks of items 1, 2, and 3 are very high, there is no immediate need for 
more units of item 4 and it may not be necessary to replenish. The idea of 
using the echelon stock is to take this into account by also including down-
stream stock of an item. This means that we also add units of item 4 con-
tained in the inventory positions of items 1, 2 and 3 when deciding whether 
to replenish item 4. This strategy does not always work well, though. As-
sume that the stock of item 3 is very high, while the stocks of items 1 and 2 
are low. The echelon stock of item 4 may then be very high, and no replen-
ishment is triggered even though the stocks of items 1 and 2 need to be re-
plenished. The replenishments of item 2 will cause corresponding demands 
for item 4. The problem is that these demands cannot be covered by the 
stock of item 3. 
We shall explain the echelon stock concept in detail by an example. 

 
198 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Example 8.1 Consider the inventory system in Figure 8.8 and assume instal-
lation inventory positions as in the second column of Table 8.1. 
Table 8.1 
Installation and echelon stock inventory positions in 
Figure 8.8.

Items 1 and 3 have no downstream stock. The echelon stock inventory posi-
tions are therefore the same as the installation stock inventory positions. 
Consider item 2. Since each unit of item 1 contains one unit of item 2, the 
echelon stock inventory position of item 2 is obtained as the installation in-
ventory position plus the stock included in the inventory position of item 1, 
i.e., 2 + 5 = 7 units. Item 4 is part of items 1, 2, and 3. Each unit of items 1 
and 2 contains two units of item 4 and each unit of item 3 contains three 
units. Consequently we obtain the echelon stock inventory position of item 4 
as 5 + 2-5 +2â¢2 + 3-3 = 28. Alternatively, we can use the echelon stock posi-
tions of items 2 and 3 to obtain the same result, i.e., 5 + 2-7 + 3-3 = 28. 
Since the echelon stock inventory position is normally higher than the in-
stallation stock inventory position, an echelon stock reorder point policy will 
generally use larger reorder points than an installation stock policy to 
achieve similar control. 
Note that if the number of units contained in a higher level item is always 
one, the echelon stock inventory position is simply obtained as the installa-
tion stock inventory position plus the sum of the installation inventory posi-
tions of all downstream items. This is always the case in a distribution sys-
tem where all stocks contain the same item. Recall also that we can always 
obtain this situation when dealing with serial or assembly systems by a suit-
able change of units. 
8.2.3 Comparison of installation stock and echelon stock 
policies 
We shall now consider the serial inventory system in Figure 8.9. Item 1 is 
the final product facing customer demand. Item A^ is raw material obtained

Figure 8.9 Serial inventory system with N installations. 
We shall analyze the relationship between installation stock (R, Q) policies 
and echelon stock (i?, Q) policies. The batch quantities are assumed to be 
given and the same for both policies, 
Qn = batch quantity at installation n. 
We make the additional assumption that the batch quantity at installation n is 
an integer multiple of the batch quantity at installation n - I (it is convenient 
to define go = 1), i.e., 
Qn=JnQn-U 
(8.1) 
where 7â is a positive integer. This assumption is natural if the rationing pol-
icy is to satisfy all or nothing of an order, since the installation stock at in-
stallation n should then always consist of an integer number of the next 
downstream lot size Qn.i. 
Let us now introduce some additional notation: 
IP^ 
= installation inventory position at installation n, 
IP^ 
= IP^ + IPl^_Y +... + /P/ = echelon stock inventory position at 
installation n, 
i?^ 
= installation stock reorder point at installation n, 
R^ 
= echelon stock reorder point at installation n. 
We shall assume that the system starts with initial inventory positions 
/Pf and IPf satisfying: 
R[ <IP^' <Rl + g , , 
i?: <IPf 
<K ^Qn- 
(8.2) 

 
200 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Note that these conditions are always satisfied as soon as each installation 
has ordered at least once. 
Let us now make some observations. An installation stock policy is al-
ways nested, i.e., installation n will not order unless its inventory position 
has just been reduced by an order from installation n-\. 
But if installation n 
- 1 orders, this must then also be the case for installation /i - 2 etc., and con-
sequently for all downstream installations. 
The echelon stock inventory position at installation n is not affected by 
orders at installations 1, 2, ... , n - 1. If, for example, installation n - \ orders 
a batch from installation n, IP^^i is increased by QnA and IP^^ is reduced by 
Qn-]. This will clearly not affect IP^. The echelon stock inventory position 
at installation n is only changed by the final demand at installation 1 and by 
replenishment orders at installation n. 
We shall now prove Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 below for the special case 
of unit demand and continuous review. The propositions are also valid for 
other types of demand and for periodic review. They can furthermore be ex-
tended to assembly systems. See Axsater and Rosling (1993). 
We shall also, without any lack of generality, assume that IPi,^ - R'â IS an 
integer multiple oi Qn.\. All demands at installation n are for multiples of the 
batch quantity at installation Â« - 1, Qn-u and all replenishments are also mul-
tiples of Qn-i due to (8.1). Therefore this assumption simply means that we 
will hit the reorder point exactly when ordering. The reorder point i?^ + y, 
where I <y < Qn-u will trigger orders at the same times and inventory posi-
tions. The only difference is that the inventory position will be 3; units below 
the reorder point when ordering because the reorder point is y units higher. 
Proposition 8.1 An installation stock reorder point policy can always be re-
placed by an equivalent echelon stock reorder point policy. 
Proof Assume that the installation stock policy is given. Consider installa-
tion n. Since the installation stock policy is nested, and since we have chosen 
the reorder points such that all inventory positions will hit the reorder points 
exactly when orders are triggered, the echelon stock inventory position just 
after ordering must be: 
< = | ; ( i ? i + e , ) . 
(8.3) 

 
MULTI^ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
201 
Because of the unit demand, the echelon stock inventory position is reduced 
by one unit at a time. Consequently, the orders will be triggered at exactly 
the same times as with the installation stock policy if we use an echelon 
stock policy with reorder points: 
K=Rl+j;^iRi+Q,). 
(8.4) 
This proves the proposition. 
If the condition that IP^^ -i?^ is a multiple of Qn.i is not satisfied, we first 
have to change to an equivalent i?^ satisfying the condition. After that we 
can apply (8.4) to get the equivalent echelon stock policy. Note that Propo-
sition 1 concerns only the inventory positions. Consequently, the result is not 
affected by the lead-times. 
Under the same assumptions we shall also prove: 
Proposition 8.2 An echelon stock reorder point policy which is nested can 
always be replaced by an equivalent installation stock reorder point policy. 
Proof Let the echelon stock policy be given. For installation 1 there is no 
difference between an echelon stock and an installation stock policy. Conse-
quently, Rl = Ri will trigger orders at the same times as the echelon stock 
policy. Consider installation n> I. Due to the unit demand, all installations 
will always hit their reorder points exactly when ordering. Since the policy is 
nested we know that if installation n orders, installations 1, 2, . . . , Â« - 1 will 
also order. Immediately after ordering, the installation inventory position at 
installation n is: 
iPi = IP: - iPl, = K +Qn- K-x - Qn-\ â¢ 
(8-5) 
Consequently, an installation stock policy with reorder points 
R{=R',, Ri=K-RU-Qn-x 
n>\, 
(8.6) 
will trigger orders at the same times as the echelon stock policy. (Note that 
(8.6) is equivalent to (8.4).) This completes the proof. 

 
202 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Example 8.2 Consider a serial system with N = 3 installations and batch 
quantities Q\ = 5, Q2= 10, and Q3 = 20. Assume that the initial inventory po-
sitions are: IP{^ = 10 , IPf = 20, and IP^ = 30. Assume furthermore that 
the demand for item 1 is one unit per time unit. Consider first an installation 
stock policy with reorder points: R{ =5, R2 -\0, 
and R^ =10. Note that 
our assumptions that Qn as well as IP^^ -i?^are multiples of QnA are satis-
fied. It is easy to check that installation 1 will order at times 5, 10, 15, ... The 
demand at installation 2 is consequently 5 units at each of these times. This 
means that installation 2 will order at times 10, 20, 30, ... Demands for 10 
units at installation 3 at these times will trigger orders at times 20, 40, 60, ... 
Using (8.4) we obtain the equivalent echelon stock policy as i?f =5, 
i?| = 20 , and i?| =40. Recall that when considering the echelon stock, the 
inventory positions at all installations are reduced by the final demand, i.e., 
by one unit each time unit, and not by the internal system orders. The initial 
inventory positions are: IP^^^ = 10 , IPf = 30 , and IPf = 60 . It is easy to 
verify that the orders will be triggered at the same times as with the installa-
tion stock policy. 
Assume then that we change the echelon stock reorder point at installa-
tion 3 to i?3 =42. This will not change the orders at installations 1 and 2, 
but the orders at installation 3 will be triggered 2 time units earlier, i.e., at 
times 18, 38, 58, ... Recall that the echelon stock is reduced by one unit at a 
time. The resulting echelon stock policy is not nested and it is impossible to 
get the same control by an installation stock policy. 
Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 show that in any serial inventory system an instal-
lation stock policy is simply a special case of an echelon stock policy. This is 
also true for assembly systems. Recall that these results depend on the as-
sumption (8.1). One advantage of an installation stock policy is that once the 
reorder points are determined only local information is needed for control-
ling the replenishments. To implement an echelon stock policy, we need 
both the installation inventory position and the inventory positions of all 
downstream installations. An alternative is, at least in principle, to have in-
formation of the initial echelon stock inventory position and be able to keep 
track of the final customer demand. In practice it is usually difficult though, 
to determine the echelon stock from these data because of various changes in 
the inventory positions, for example, due to damage and obsolescence. 
The higher generality of an echelon stock policy can be an advantage in 
certain situations. We shall illustrate this by an example. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
203 
Example 8.3 Consider a serial system (Figure 8.9) with N = 2 installations 
and batch quantities gi = 50 and Q2 =100. Assume that the final demand at 
installation 1 is constant and continuous, 50 units per time unit. The lead-
time at installation 1 (excluding possible delays at installation 2) is one time 
unit, and at installation 2 it is 0.5 time units. No shortages are allowed, and 
the holding costs at installation 1 are higher than at installation 2. The opti-
mal control of the system is illustrated in Figure 8.10. 
Consider, for example, the two batches that are delivered to installation 1 
at times 2 and 3. These two batches were ordered by installation 1 at times 1 
and 2. The delivery of these 100 units to the warehouse took place, just-in-
time, at time 1. Immediately after the delivery, 50 units were sent to installa-
tion 1. Since the lead-time at installation 2 is 0.5 time units, the correspond-
ing order was triggered at time 0.5. But this can never be achieved by an in-
stallation stock (R, Q) policy because it is nested. Installation 2 can only or-
der when installation 1 orders, i.e., at times 0, 1, 2, ... This will lead to addi-
tional costs (See Axsater and Juntti, 1996). The optimal control can be ob-
tained by an echelon stock policy with i?f =50and i?| =75. Just before 
time 0.5 the installation inventory position is zero at installation 2 and 75 at 
installation 1, since one batch is on order at installation 1.

Let us also state the following result from (Axsater and Rosling, 1993). 

 
204 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Proposition 8.3 S policies based on the echelon stock are equivalent to S 
policies based on the installation stock for general systems. 
The dominance of echelon stock policies for serial and assembly systems 
does not carry over to distribution systems. For such systems an installation 
stock policy may perform better in certain situations, but the opposite can 
also be true. In general, the differences are relatively small (Axsater and 
Juntti, 1996), but in special situations very large differences may occur (Ax-
sater, 1997). 
A KANBAN policy can be interpreted as an installation stock (i?, Q) pol-
icy with constraints on the number of outstanding orders. By applying the 
same constraints to echelon stock policies, we obtain a class of policies 
which, for serial and assembly systems, contains the KANBAN policies as a 
subset. See Axsater and Rosling (1999). 
8.2.4 Material Requirements Planning 
When using reorder point systems, based on the installation stock or on the 
echelon stock for multi-echelon inventory control, it is generally implicitly 
assumed that the demands at the different installations are stochastic but still 
relatively stationary. The reorder points are updated with a certain periodic-
ity but do not change much over time. However, especially in production, it 
is common to find settings where such reorder point systems do not perform 
well. Consider, for example, a component for which nearly all demand oc-
curs twice per year when assembling a certain product. Assume that the pro-
duction lead-time of the component is three weeks. In such a case it is gener-
ally suitable to start production of the component a little more than three 
weeks before the two times per year when large numbers of the component 
are needed in production. A reorder point system could in principle provide 
this control, provided that the reorder point is updated continuously with re-
spect to the immediate lead-time demand caused by production of higher 
level items. In the considered case the expected lead-time demand would 
then be close to zero unless we are within three weeks of one of the produc-
tion times. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is essentially such a re-
order point system, where the reorder points are updated continuously with 
respect to known discrete requirements. 
To be able to update the lead-time demand it is necessary to keep track of 
all future production plans for higher level items that may affect the lead-
time demand. The time horizon for the planning system should therefore ex-
ceed the total system lead-time, i.e., the time from ordering raw materials to 
deliveries of final products. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
205 
We shall now describe material requirements planning in detail. The 
planning procedure is usually applied in a periodic review, rolling horizon 
setting. The review period can be, for example, one week. The planning 
procedure is based on the following data: 
â¢ A production program for final products, a Master Production Sched-
ule (MPS). In a make-to-order environment the master schedule is 
usually comprised of plans for final assembly and delivery to custom-
ers. The master production schedule must cover the total system lead-
time, i.e., the time span between ordering raw materials and delivering 
end products to customers. Production beyond that horizon cannot af-
fect today's plans for components and raw materials. 
â¢ External demands of other items, e.g., demands that do not emanate 
from production plans for higher level items. An example is the de-
mand for spare parts. 
â¢ A bill of material for each item specifying all of its immediate compo-
nents and their numbers per unit of the parent. 
â¢ Inventory status for all items, i.e., stock on hand, stock on order, and 
backorders. 
â¢ Constant lead-times for all items. 
â¢ Rules for safety stocks (and/or safety times) and batch quantities. 
The procedure starts with end products, i.e., items that only face external 
demand. The requirements of these items are given by the master production 
schedule. These items are sometimes denoted Level 0 items. Next we con-
sider all items that are immediate components of Level 0 items. These items, 
which can also face external demand, are denoted Level 1 items. More gen-
erally, Level n items are direct components of Level n - \ items. They can 
also be components of higher level items and have external demand. 
Let us consider the simple product structure in Figure 8.11. We start with 
the end item, item 1. Table 8.2 illustrates how the net requirements of item 1 
are determined.

In the first column the planning parameters, lead-time, order quantity, and 
safety stock, are given. If the order quantity is one, this is usually termed lot-
for-lot in connection with material requirements planning. Table 8.2 de-
scribes the planning situation at the end of period 0, i.e., just before the start 
of period 1. The inventory on hand at that time is 22. The given gross re-
quirements of item 1 in different periods are obtained from the master pro-
duction schedule, since item 1 is an end product. Usually the requirements as 
well as the deliveries are assumed to occur in the beginning of a period. A 
requirement occurs just after a possible delivery. The scheduled receipts in 
Table 8.2 show planned deliveries of outstanding real orders. ThQ projected 
inventory is the inventory level after the gross requirement and the scheduled 
receipt. In period 1 the initial inventory is reduced by the gross requirement 
in period 1 and we obtain the projected inventory 22-10 = 12. In period 2 
the receipt is added and we obtain 12 + 25 = 37 etc. In period 4 the projected 
inventory declines to 2 units. The safety stock is 5 units. The most common 
convention when determining the net requirement is to require that backor-
ders plus the safety stock should be covered. This means that the net re-
quirement in period 4 is 3 units. In period 5 the additional net requirement is 
20, since 3 + 20 - 18 = 5. It is straightforward to complete the table. 
We shall in this section follow the mentioned convention that the net re-
quirement should cover the safety stock. Sometimes another rule is used, 
though. According to the alternative rule, there is no net requirement unless 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
207 
the projected inventory is negative. But when there is a net requirement, the 
number of units should also cover the safety stock. In Table 8.2 this means 
that there is no net requirement in period 4, while the net requirement in pe-
riod 5 is increased by 3 units to 23. 
Let us now replace the net requirements in Table 8.2 hy planned orders. 
We shall also let the planned orders affect the projected inventory. Note that 
the order quantity is 25 and that the lead-time is one period. To cover the net 
requirement in period 4 we need to trigger an order of size 25. This order 
must be placed in period 3 due to the lead-time. See Table 8.3. Note that a 
planned order is represented by its starting time, while a scheduled receipt is 
represented by its delivery time. A planned order is replaced by a scheduled 
receipt when the order is started. This is because we want to make a differ-
ence between real and planned orders. If for example, in period 3, we choose 
to initiate the planned order in that period, it is removed from planned orders 
and added as a scheduled receipt in period 4.

The projected inventory is still below the safety stock in period 6. We there-

We can interpret the planning of orders as the application of an installa-
tion stock reorder point system, where the reorder point is the lead-time de-
mand plus the safety stock minus one (the projected inventory should be lar-
ger or equal to the safety stock). Without an order in period 3, the inventory 
position after the gross requirement is 12. The reorder point in period 3 is 10 

 
208 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
+ 5 - 1 =^ 14. This means that an order is triggered. After the order the in-
ventory position is 37. In period 4 the inventory position is 27 and the reor-
der point 20 + 5 - 1 = 24, i.e., no order is triggered. In period 5, the inventory 
position is 7 and the reorder point 5 + 5 - 1 = 9 , and the second order is trig-
gered. 
Tables 8.2 and 8.3 have mainly been used to explain the MRP logic. 
From now on we will use the representation in Table 8.4 directly. Recall that 
Table 8.4 represents the planning situation at the end of period 0. At the end 
of period 1 we consider a similar table covering periods 2-9. 
Let us now go back to Figure 8.11. We assume that item 2 is only needed 
for production of item 1, and that item 3 is only needed for production of 
item 2. According to Table 8.4 we plan to start production of 25 units in the 
beginning of periods 3 and 5. This means that we need 25 units of item 2 at 
the same times, i.e., we have determined the gross requirements of item 2. 
Given the gross requirements, we can apply the same planning procedure for 
item 2 and determine the planned orders, which in turn are the gross require-
ments of item 3. The whole MRP procedure is shown in Figure 8.12.

Note that the planning procedure in Figure 8.12 gives a shortage of item 3 
in period 2. To avoid the shortage the order should have been started in pe-
riod 0, but we are already at the end of this period. The shortage means that 
the plans for items 1 and 2 cannot be followed. In practice there are usually 
several ways to overcome the problem. Perhaps it is possible to temporarily 
reduce the lead-time of item 3 to one period. Another alternative is to adjust 
the basis for the planning. It may, for example, be possible to change the 
master production schedule, which determines the gross requirements of 
item 1, or to adjust order quantities and safety stocks. 
So far we have assumed that safety stocks are used to cover variations in 
demand and lead-times. When applying MRP it is also common to use a 
safety time as an alternative or supplement. This means that we plan the or-
ders so that the deliveries are expected to occur the safety time before the 
corresponding net requirements. Table 8.5 shows the MRP record if we add 
a safety time of one period to the planning situation in Table 8.4.

In Figure 8.12 it is assumed that item 2 is only part of item 1 and that 
item 3 is only part of item 2. It is very common, though, that an item is a 
component of many higher level items. Figures 8.13 and 8.14 illustrate how 
this is handled in MRP. Recall that when processing a certain item, plans for 
all items at higher levels are already complete.

Sometimes it is important to keep track of which higher level items have 
generated different gross requirements. If for example, we obtain an infeasi-
ble plan such as for item 3 in Figure 8.12, it is interesting to see if it is pos-
sible to avoid the difficulties by changing the plans for one or more of the 
parent items. To be able to do that we need to "peg'' generated gross re-
quirements with identifications of the items generating them. 
MRP is often referred to as dipush system since orders are in a sense trig-
gered in anticipation of future needs. Reorder point systems and KANBAN 
systems are similarly said to be pull systems because orders are triggered 
when downstream installations need them. This notation is unclear and mis-
leading. An MRP system is, in fact, a more general ordering system than an 
installation stock reorder point system. Recall that the MRP logic can be in-
terpreted as application of a reorder point system, where the reorder point in 
each period is the lead-time demand plus the safety stock minus one. The 
lead-time in the MRP system is a planning parameter that does not necessar-
ily need to correspond to an estimate of the real lead-time. If we set the lead-
time to zero, the reorder point is constant and equal to the safety stock minus 
one. The safety stock is also a planning parameter that can be chosen arbi-
trarily. Consequently, we can state the following proposition: 
Proposition 8.4 For a general inventory system, an MRP system can give 
the same control as any installation stock reorder point system. 
In Axsater and Rosling (1994) it is also shown that: 
Proposition 8.5 For serial and assembly systems, MRP can work as any 
echelon stock reorder point system. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING 
211 
Consequently we can conclude that if MRP is a push system, it is also a pull 
system. 
The MRP logic is simple, yet the computational effort can be very large if 
there are thousands of items and complex multi-level product structures. In 
such systems it is also difficult to update all data. As we have discussed 
above, the major advantage of MRP is that it enables us to keep track of 
relatively infrequent large requirements. Many low level components often 
have a large number of parents, and the gross requirements obtained from 
the MRP calculations will, for statistical reasons, be very smooth. Quite of-
ten it is more practical for such items to forecast the demand by exponential 
smoothing and use a simple reorder point system. These items can then be 
excluded from the bills of material and the remaining product structures will 
be simpler. 
One problem with MRP can be that the plans for individual items change 
too frequently over time. Even a very small change in the master production 
schedule can lead to relatively large changes in the plans for many lower 
level items. This "instability" of MRP is often called "nervousness '\ One 
possibility to reduce the nervousness is to ''freeze'' orders within a certain 
time frame. This means that orders within this time frame are not changed 
according to the MRP logic. 
It is most common to use MRP in production. But since a product struc-
ture corresponds to a multi-echelon inventory system (See e.g., Figure 8.8), 
we can also use the same ordering technique in a distribution system. In this 
context the term MRP is sometimes replaced by DRP, Distribution Require-
ments Planning. 
Usually the MRP procedures that we have described are the core in a 
planning system that also contains other planning modules. It is especially 
common to include modules for capacity planning. In such more general 
systems MRP is then sometimes interpreted as Manufacturing Resource 
Planning. The term MRP II is also used. 
Capacity requirements can be estimated in two ways. One possibility is to 
forecast the needed production capacity directly from the master production 
schedule. Such a forecast is usually not very accurate since the inventory 
status of different items is not taken into account. In general, this is denoted 
Rough Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP). It is more accurate to estimate the 
capacity requirements after carrying out the complete MRP calculations. 
This is usually denoted Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP). Figure 8.15 
illustrates how the modules can be coupled to each other.

Figure 8.15 Manufacturing Resource Planning. 
When choosing the master schedule, the capacity requirements are estimated 
by Rough Cut Capacity Planning. After choosing the master schedule and 
going through the MRP calculations, a more accurate estimate is obtained 
from Capacity Requirements Planning. If there are large deviations between 
these two estimates of the capacity requirements, and the more accurate es-
timate is infeasible, it may be necessary to go back and adjust the master 
schedule. 
Although the system in Figure 8.15 contains more than material require-
ments planning, it is obvious that MRP is the heart of the system. The capac-
ity planning modules essentially give only the estimated capacity conse-
quences of the MRP plan. A planning framework of this type is natural if the 
main task of the system is materials management. If the main problem is to 
achieve high and smooth capacity utilization, it can be more suitable to start 
with the capacity planning and let the results of this planning be a basis for 
the materials management. 
A so-called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can be seen as a 
further extension of MRP. Such systems usually provide a number of addi-
tional functions, many of which are outside the production area, like ware-
house management, shipping, financial information and planning, etc. ERP 
can also be a multilocation system and handle production planning across 
multiple sites, which is usually very important for large corporations. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - STRUCTURES AND ORDERING

We refer to Orlicky (1975), Baker (1993), Silver et al. (1998), and Voll-
man et al. (1997) for a more detailed treatment of MRP. 
8.2.5 Ordering system dynamics 
A major advantage of installation stock reorder point policies and KANBAN 
policies is that these policies are easy to implement. In particular, they only 
need local information about inventory positions after the control parameters 
are set. One disadvantage, however, is that the information in the supply 
chain is delayed. Consider again the material requirements planning in Fig-
ure 8.12. Assume that the gross requirements of item 1 will increase due to 
larger demand from the final customers. This may lead to a change in the 
planned orders for item 1 so that the order in period 3 will instead be placed 
in period 2. When using material requirements planning, this will immedi-
ately lead to corresponding changes in the plans for items 2 and 3. We are 
consequently able to let changes in the master production schedule directly 
affect plans for all items. Echelon stock reorder point policies provide simi-
lar possibilities, since the echelon stock is immediately affected by the final 
customer demand. If the stocks are controlled in a decentralized manner by 
installation stock reorder point policies, the information concerning the in-
creasing customer demand is not transmitted in the same rapid way, how-
ever. With an installation stock reorder point system, the order for item 1 in 
Figure 8.12 may also be placed in period 2 instead of period 3. The problem 
is that this information is not available at installation 2 until the order actu-
ally occurs in period 2. Nothing happens during period 1. In some situations 
with large batch quantities and many stages, such information delays can 
cause major problems. 
There is also considerable evidence, theoretical as well as practical, that 
decentralized installation stock policies in multi-echelon systems can yield 
very large demand variations early in the material flow, even though the fi-
nal demand is very stable. Consider the simple serial system in Figure 8.16. 
Figure 8.16 A simple serial two-echelon inventory system. 

 
214 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
Let us assume that the inventory system is part of a distribution system and 
that the installations are situated far from each other. We also assume that 
the lead-times are five weeks for each installation. The two installations are 
adapting their reorder points with respect to the demand at their site. The 
demand at installation 2 is the orders from installation 1. We shall also as-
sume that both installations use periodic review policies with a review period 
of one week. There are many similar items, but the items are handled indi-
vidually. 
Assume now that site 1 estimates that the final demand for all items has 
increased by 20 percent. Normally the site orders about one week's demand 
each week. The increase in customer demand means that the estimated lead-
time demand is also increased by 20 percent, which corresponds to the origi-
nal demand during one week. The reorder points are raised correspondingly. 
The orders from installation 1 will increase due both to the higher reorder 
points and due to the increase in the demand. The resulting demand at in-
stallation 2 in the first week will increase by more than 100 percent. If in-
stallation 2 adjusts its reorder points with respect to that change, the effects 
for its supplier will be devastating. 
Note that the demand at installation 2 in the long run will only increase 
by 20 percent. The very high demand just after the change is due to the ad-
justments of the reorder points at installation I. Furthermore, if installation 2 
has information about the final customer demand, or if the dynamic effects 
that we have described are understood, the adjustments of the reorder points 
at installation 2 can be expected to be less dramatic. 
The high demand variations at upstream stages have been analyzed and 
discussed by several authors. The first well-known contribution was by For-
rester (1961). The phenomenon is today often denoted the bullwhip effect. 
For further details see Baganha and Cohen (1998), Lee et al. (1997a,b), and 
Towill and Del Vecchio (1994). It is common to illustrate the bullwhip effect 
by a game concerning a distribution system for beer, the Beer Game. Differ-
ent variations of this game exist; see Sterman (1989), and Chen and Samro-
engraja (2000). 
It is important to note that both the information delays and the problems 
of large demand variations at upstream facilities are largely due to long lead-
times and large batch quantities. With small batch quantities, the times be-
tween orders will be short, and the information will be transmitted relatively 
rapidly between the echelons even when using an installation stock reorder 
point system. If the lead-times are short, adjustments of the reorder points 
due to demand changes will also become small, and the demand variations at 
the next upstream stage will be limited. Consequently, for systems with 
small batch quantities and short lead-times, installation stock reorder point 
policies and KANBAN policies will perform very well in most cases.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
The initial installation stock inventory positions are IPI^ =15 and /Pf 
= 12 . The system is controlled by installation stock reorder point policies 
with R\ = 8 , e, = 10, i?^ = 9 , and Qi = 20. 
a) Determine an equivalent echelon stock reorder point policy. 
b) Consider constant continuous demand, one unit per time unit, and verify 
that the two policies order at the same times. 
c) Increase R^ by one unit. At what times will installation 2 order? Does an 
equivalent installation stock policy exist? 
8.4 
Consider again the serial inventory system in Problem 8.3. The production 
control manager has been visiting Japan. Influenced by what he has seen 
there he wants to use a KANBAN system. For installation 1 he has one card 
and a container for 50 units. For installation 2 he has also one card but a 
container for 100 units. Both lead-times are zero so no shortages can occur. 
Initially there are 50 units in stock at each installation. The demand at 
installation 1 is one unit per time unit. 
a) The assistant production control manager thinks that the new ideas are 
unnecessary and suggests an equivalent installation stock {R, Q) system. 
How should R and Q be chosen for the two installations? 
b) Is it possible to get the same control by an echelon stock policy? How 
should in that case R and Q be chosen for the two installations?

Consider again the serial inventory system in Problem 8.3. Let the batch 
quantities be gi = 10 and Qi = 20. The installation stock reorder points are 
R\ = 22 and R2 = 35 . The initial installation stock inventory positions are 
/Pj'^ = 27 and IP2^ = 50 . Determine an equivalent echelon stock policy.

9 MULTI-ECHELON SYSTEMS: 
LOT SIZING 
In Chapter 8 we have discussed why and how multi-echelon inventory sys-
tems appear in practice, and how the most common ordering systems work. 
We shall now turn to the problem of choosing batch quantities for a multi-
echelon inventory system. Note that this important problem must be solved 
independently of which type of ordering system we use. 
First of all, when determining order quantities for a multi-echelon inven-
tory system, it is not optimal to handle each site individually. The choice of 
batch quantity at a certain site will namely affect the demand structure at the 
next upstream site. This dependency makes the determination of batch quan-
tities much more complex. Although it is not optimal to determine batch 
quantities individually for each site, this is very common in practice because 
it is so easy. Generally this will lead to order quantities that are too small. 
When dealing with order quantities for multi-echelon systems we shall 
assume that the customer demand is known and deterministic, i.e., we disre-
gard random variations. In case of stochastic demand, it is normally reason-
able to replace the stochastic demand by its mean and use a deterministic 
model when determining batch quantities. The stochastic demand variations, 
are however, taken into account, in a second step, when we determine safety 
stocks and reorder points. This approximation, which is common also for 
single-echelon systems, is usually more or less necessary for multi-echelon 
systems. 
Furthermore, we make the standard assumption that all lead-times are 
zero. Recall that for a single-echelon system with a constant lead-time and 
deterministic demand, we can make this assumption without any lack of gen-
erality. In case of a positive lead-time L, we just need to order L time units

INVENTORY CONTROL 
earlier. When dealing with multi-echelon systems it is generally possible to 
handle serial and assembly systems similarly, i.e., we can determine batch 
quantities for zero lead-times and still use the results also for positive lead-
times. For distribution systems (Figure 8.2) and general systems (Figure 
8.4), however, positive lead-times may be more difficult to deal with. 
9.1 Identical order quantities 
9.1.1 Infinite production rates 
Consider first the simple assembly system and the corresponding product 
structure in Figure 9.1.

Figure 9.1 A simple assembly system. 
Let us think of a production system. Assume that we have chosen the units 
so that when producing one unit of item 1, exactly one unit of item 2 and one 
unit of item 3 are needed as components. (Recall that this is always possi-
ble.) 
Item 1 is a final product with constant continuous demand d. Let the 
setup costs be Ai, A2, and ^3, and the holding costs hu hi, and A3. 
Furthermore, we assume infinite production rates, and that for some rea-
son, the same batch quantity is used for all three items. Infinite production 
rate means that the whole batch is delivered at the same time. (As discussed 
above we also assume that the lead-times are zero.) 
Given that the batch quantities are the same, it is obviously optimal to 
produce batches of items 2 and 3 just-in-time for the production of item 1. 
This means that there are never any stocks of items 2 and 3, and all three 
items are produced at the same time. But if the items are produced at the 
same time, we can replace the considered three items by a single item with 
setup cost A= Ai + A2 + A^, and holding cost h = hi.ln case of constant de-

 
MULTI-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
223 
mand, we can then simply use the classical economic order quantity model 
(4.3) for determining the optimal batch quantity. 
Our conclusions for the simple assembly system in Figure 9.1 can easily 
be generalized to a general assembly system and to time-varying demand. 
9.1,2 Finite production rates 
If we have finite production rates but still identical lot sizes, it is more diffi-
cult to determine the optimal lot size for a multi-echelon system. However, 
for serial and assembly systems and constant demand, it is still usually pos-
sible to determine the optimal batch size from a model, which can be seen as 
a variation of the classical economic order quantity model. We shall illus-
trate this by an example. 
Example 9.1 Consider a product that is produced from raw material in two 
machines, 1 and 2. The machines have production rates/?i > p2> d, where d 
is the constant customer demand. At the beginning of a production cycle, a 
batch of raw material is delivered to machine 1. The output from machine 1 
is immediately (continuously) transferred to machine 2. When the whole 
batch has completed production in machine 2, it is transported to a ware-
house facing the constant customer demand. The machines have setup costs 
A] and ^2- There is also a fixed cost ^3 associated with the transportation of a 
batch of goods from machine 2 to the warehouse. The holding cost before 
machine I is h] per unit and time unit. After being processed in machine 1 
the holding cost is hj, and after machine 2 it is ^3 (valid also at the ware-
house). We wish to determine the optimal batch size. 
First of all, we note that we can disregard the holding costs during trans-
portation since each unit is in transport the same time independent of the 
batch size. Still we have four echelons where the holding costs are affected 
by the batch size, i.e., before machine 1 (1), between machines 1 and 2 (2), 
after machine 2 (3) and at the warehouse (4). Figure 9.2 illustrates the devel-
opment of the stock levels over time. From the figure it is easy to determine 
the average stock over time at the different stock points. Consider, for exam-
ple, the stock level before machine 1. The time between two deliveries is 
Q/d. During this time we have stock in front of the machine while the ma-
chine is producing, i.e., during the time Q/pi. This means that the fraction of 
time with a positive stock level is d/pi. The average stock level while the 
stock is positive is Q/2. The average stock level over all times is therefore 
(Q/2)(d/pi). Other stocks can be handled similarly. Each batch will give or-
dering costs in both machines and a fixed cost for transportation. Conse-
quently we can express the total relevant costs as:

Note that if we let the production rates approach infinity, we are back in 
the situation considered in Section 9.1.1 and we only need to consider a sin-
gle echelon with setup cost A = Ai -^ Ai + A3, and holding cost h = h^. The 
only stock that we need to consider is then the stock at the warehouse. 
9.2 Constant demand 
We shall now consider the more general case when the batch quantities at 
different installations do not need to be identical. We assume constant con-
tinuous demand for the end product and infinite production rates. 
9.2.7 A simple serial system with constant demand 
Consider the simple serial system in Figure 9.3. 
Figure 9.3 A simple serial inventory system. 
Let us assume that item 1 is a final product which is produced from one unit 
of the component 2, which in turn, is obtained from an external supplier. As 
we have discussed above, we assume that the lead-times are zero. The de-

 
226 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
mand, d, for item 1 is constant and continuous. Both items have ordering 
costs, Ax and A2, as well as holding costs, hx and /za- When delivering a batch, 
the whole quantity is delivered at the same time. No backorders are allowed. 
We want to determine optimal batch quantities, Qx and Q2. Note that except 
for the two echelons, the assumptions are exactly the same as in the classical 
economic order quantity model, see Section 4.1. 
Example 9.2 Let the problem parameters be J = 8, ^1 = 20, A2 = 80, hx = 5, 
and ^2 ^ 4. 
Item 1 faces constant continuous demand and the costs are consequently 
obtained as 
C,=h,^ 
+ A,^. 
(9.3) 
One approach to solving the problem could be to apply the classical eco-
nomic order quantity model to item 1, i.e., to minimize (9.3). We obtain 
2Axd 
and the corresponding costs 
Q =^2Axdhx =40. 
The demand for item 2 is then discrete and not continuous, 8 units each time 
unit. Given a constant Qx, we should always choose Q2 as a multiple of Qx, 
Qi-kQ,, 
(9.4) 
where A: is a positive integer. This is easy to show in the same way as we 
showed Property 1 in Section 4.5. 
Figure 9.4 illustrates the behavior of the inventory levels for A: = 3. Since 
the lead-times are zero there is no difference between inventory levels and 
inventory positions. The figure shows both the installation stock and the 
echelon stock. The echelon stock of item 2 is simply the sum of the stock at 
both installations. For item 1 the echelon stock is equal to the installation 
stock since there is no downstream stock.

The costs for item 2 are obtained as:

since the average installation stock of item 2 is (A: - l)gi/2. C2 is evidently

If k < 1 it is optimal to choose k= I. Assume that k* > \, Let k'be the larg-

optimal to choose k = k^ ifklk' < (A:' + 1)/A:*. Otherwise k = A:'+ 1 is optimal. 
(See Section 4.1.2.) 
We obtain k* Â« 2.24 and it is optimal to have A: = 2. The corresponding 
costs are obtained from (9.5) as C2 = 56, and we get the total costs per time 

 
228 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
unit as C = Ci + C2 = 40 + 56 = 96. As we shall show below, this is not the 
optimal solution. It is not feasible to optimize item 1 separately without con-
sidering the consequences for item 2, since the batch size for item 1 will af-
fect the demand for item 2. 
Let us now derive the optimal solution. It can be shown that (9.4) must be 
satisfied in the optimal solution for a two-level system. (As illustrated by 
Example 9.4 in Section 9.2.2, this is not necessarily true if there are more 
than two levels.) The total costs are obtained by adding (9.3) and (9.5), 
C = Q+C2=(^i+(^-l)/^2)% + (^i+4^)4-- 
(^-^^

Alternatively, we can represent the costs in terms of the echelon stock. Since 
the echelon stock of item 2 includes the stock of item 1, the holding cost for 
item 1 should only represent the value added when producing item 1 from 
item 2. This means that we shall use the echelon holding costs e\ = h\ - hi, 
and ^2 = /?2. We obtain:

The costs (9.7) and (9.8) are not the same as the costs (9.3) and (9.5) but it is 
easy to verify that the total costs, 
2 
k Qx 
are the same, i.e., the cost expressions (9.6) and (9.9) are equivalent. The 
representation in (9.7)-(9.9) is, in general, easier to handle since the struc-
tures of (9.7) and (9.8) are exactly the same. This is also illustrated by Figure 
9.4. 
For a given k the optimal Qx is obtained from (9.9) by setting the deriva-
tive equal to zero. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
229 
(9.10) 
Inserting (9.10) in (9.9) we obtain the optimal costs for a given k as 
C{k)^,l2(A,+^)d(e^+ke2). 
(9.11) 
It is easy to see that 
C^ik)^2d(A^e^-hA2e2+A^e2k 
+ ^^) 
(9.12) 
is a convex function of k. The optimization of (9.12) with respect to k is 
similar to the optimization of (9.5) above. First we disregard that k has to be 
an integer. We get 
If A:* < 1 it is optimal to choose k= \. Assume that k* > I. Let A:' be the larg-
est integer less or equal to k*, i.e., k^ <k <A:'+l.Itis optimal to choose k = 
k' \ik*lk' < (k^ + l)/k*. Otherwise k = k^+ 1 is optimal. 
If Ai/ei > Ajlei we get k= I. This means that we should use the same 
batch size for the two items, and consequently, each time we produce a batch 
of item 2, the batch should immediately be used for production of item 1. 
This implies that we do not need any stock of item 2 and that our two-stage 
system can be replaced by a single-stage system. It can be shown that the 
condition Axlei > ^^2/^2 is also sufficient in case of time-varying demand, see 
Axsater and Nuttle (1987) and Section 9.3.3. 
Example 9.3 Consider again the problem in Example 9.2, i.e., d= ?>,Ai = 20, 
^2^80,/zi-5,and/z2 = 4. 
We obtain ei = hi - h2 = 1, and 62 = hj = 4. From (9.13) we get yt = 1 
which is, consequently, the optimal value of A:. Applying (9.10) and (9.11) 
we get Q* Â«17.89, QI =kQ* =Q* Â«17.89, and C* Â« 89.44, i.e., about 7 
percent lower than the costs obtained in Example 9.2. The batch quantity of 
item 1 has increased by more than 100 percent. This is rather typical. If we 

 
230 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
take the multi-echelon structure into account, this will very often lead to a 
larger order quantity for the end product. 
Note that (9.10) and (9.11) are essentially equivalent to the corresponding 
expressions (4.3) and (4.4) for the classical economic order quantity model. 
The only difference is that the ordering cost A is replaced by: 
and the holding cost h by: 
A[ = Ai+A2/k, 
(9.14) 
h{=ei-^ke2. 
(9.15) 
Note also that it is not clear how the "real" holding costs should be de-
termined in different situations. Assume that there is plenty of stock of item 
2. If we produce one unit of item 1, the holding costs per time unit for item 1 
will increase hy hi, but since the stock of item 2 is reduced by one unit, the 
holding costs per time unit for item 2 are reduced by h2. The increase in 
holding costs therefore corresponds to the value added instead of the total 
value. The additional holding cost is the echelon holding cost ei = hi - hj. If, 
on the other hand, we need to replenish item 2 in order to produce item 1, the 
holding costs will increase by the normal holding cost rate hi. The average 
additional holding costs when producing one unit of item 1 will conse-
quently be somewhere between ei and hi. 
9.2.2 Roundy's 98 percent approximation 
Even if customer demand is constant, multi-echelon lot sizing problems may 
be very difficult to solve. Optimal solutions are sometimes surprisingly 
complex. For example, the optimal solution for a serial system with constant 
demand can mean order quantities that vary over time, see Williams (1982) 
and Example 9.4 below. Roundy (1985, 1986), however, has shown that it is 
often possible to use rather simple approximations with a guaranteed cost 
performance of at most 2 percent above the optimal costs. We shall describe 
how Roundy's technique can be applied to a serial system, but it is also pos-
sible to use the same approach for assembly and distribution systems. An 
overview is given in Muckstadt and Roundy (1993). Recall that we have al-
ready used Roundy's approach in Section 7.3.1.2 in connection with joint 
replenishments. 
Consider a serial system with A^ stages, see Figure 9.5.

Figure 9.5 Considered serial system with N installations. 
The final demand at installation 1 is constant and continuous. There are 
nonnegative ordering and echelon holding costs at all stages. No shortages 
are allowed. When producing one unit of item / - 1, one unit of item / is 
needed as a component (/ = 2, 3, ... , N). We disregard the lead-times. It is 
easy to see that an optimal solution is nested, i.e., a batch at stage / should 
exactly cover an integer number of batches at stage / - 1. (See Section 4.5 
and the explanation oiProperty 1) As we will see in Example 9.4, however, 
the optimal batch sizes are not necessarily constant over time. 
Roundy's approximation means first of all that the batch quantities for 
different items are restricted to be constant over time. Let us introduce the 
following notation: 
d = final demand per time unit for item 1, 
Ai = ordering cost for item i, 
ei = echelon holding cost for item i, 
Qi = batch quantity for item i. 
Furthermore, the batch quantity for item / is restricted to be a power of two 
times the batch quantity for item / - 1, i.e., 
a.=2^'a_i, 
/ = 2,3,...,A^, 
(9.16) 
where ki is a nonnegative integer. This implies that the solution must be 
nested, i.e., if a batch of item / is produced at some time, we must also have 
production of items z - 1, z - 2, ... , 1. 
Our objective is to minimize the total holding and ordering costs. In anal-
ogy with (9.7)-(9.9) we have: 
min 
'Zie.^ 
+ A,-^), 
(9.17) 

 
232 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
subject to the constraints that the batch quantities are nonnegative and satisfy 
(9.16). 
What is particularly interesting about Roundy's solution is that the costs 
are at most 2 percent higher than the optimal costs, i.e., without the con-
straints (9.16). 
Roundy's approach is to first relax the constraints (9.16) and instead use 
the milder constraints: 
e, >e,_,, 
i=2,i>,...,N. 
(9.18) 
Note that (9.16) implies (9.18) while the opposite is not true. Therefore, by 
using (9.18) we will get a lower bound for the costs when using the con-
straints (9.16). The objective function (9.17) is convex and the constraints 
(9.18) are linear. The unique solution of the relaxed problem can therefore 
be obtained through the Lagrangean relaxation: 
max 
mm Yj^e,^ 
+A,â)-^Ya^,{Q,_, 
- g / ) , 
(9-19) 
where the multipliers 2/ are also restricted to be nonnegative. 
Assume that we have determined the optimal multipliers. Define 
e\ â ei- 2/^2 + 2^3, 
(9.20) 
It is possible to show that the optimal solution of the relaxed problem must 
give all e\ > 0. To see this note that the optimal costs for the relaxed prob-
lem can be obtained as the solution of: 
mm f,ie\^^A^), 
(9.21) 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
233 
without any constraints on the batch quantities, i.e., a problem with inde-
pendent items, ordering costs Ai, and echelon holding costs ej. If e'l < 0 we 
can let Q^ -^ oo which means that the costs in (9.21) approach - oo. This is 
clearly impossible. 
Let us now compare the original holding costs ei to the holding costs e|-, 
see (9.20). Recall that the multipliers are nonnegative. Consider first the ef-
fect of/I2. The echelon holding cost rate at stage 2 is reduced by 2/I2 and the 
echelon holding cost rate at stage 1 is increased by 2^2. More generally, the 
effect of Ai is that the echelon holding cost rate at stage / is reduced by 2/1/ 
and the echelon holding cost rate at stage / - 1 is increased by 2/1/. 
What is very interesting is that this implies that (9.21) provides a lower 
bound for the optimal costs for our original problem where the batch quanti-
ties can be chosen in any way. They can, for example, vary over time. Yet 
the echelon stock at stage / - 1 is always less than or equal to the echelon 
stock at stage /. A change from the echelon holding costs e^ to the echelon 
holding costs e- can therefore not increase the costs for the optimal solution. 
Furthermore, given the echelon holding costs e^, (9.21) provides a lower 
bound for the costs since there are no constraints at all on the batch quanti-
ties. 
Assume that we have solved the relaxed problem. This means that we 
have a lower bound for the optimal costs and batch quantities satisfying 
(9.18). We can now adjust this solution by rounding the batch quantities so 
that they can be expressed as 
2 / = 2 " ' ^ . 
(9.22) 
We know from Section 7.1 that if ^ is given, the maximum cost increase is at 
most 6 percent, and if we can also adjust q to get a better approximation the 
cost increase is at most 2 percent. Due to (9.18), we know that m^ >m^_i 
and the batch quantities obtained must consequently satisfy (9.16). We have 
now obtained Roundy's solution of the problem. We have feasible constant 
batch quantities and the cost increase compared to the optimal solution is at 
most 2 percent, since it is at most 2 percent compared to the lower bound 
(9.21). 
It is possible to use the considered Lagrangean relaxation for numerical 
determination of Roundy's solution, but generally it is much simpler to use 
the following technique. Consider the relaxed problem. Without the con-
straints (9.18) it would be optimal to use Qi = {lAidle^^'^ for all /. Conse-
quently, if Ailei increases with /, we have found the optimal solution since

the resulting batch quantities will satisfy (9.18). Assume that for some z, Af/ei 
< AiJei.u or equivalently that Q^ <g/_i. Also assume that in the optimal 
solution of the relaxed problem Qi > g/.i. This implies that Qi <Qi since we 
would otherwise reduce Qi, and similarly that Qi.\ > g^_| since we would 
otherwise increase g/.j. But this means that Qi < Qi.u which is a contradic-
tion. Consequently, Qi = Qi.i in the optimal solution of the relaxed problem. 
This means that we can aggregate items i - 1 and / into a single item with or-
dering cost Ai.i + Ai and echelon holding cost e/.j + e,-. Next we consider the 
resulting reduced problem with N - 1 items. IfAi/ci < AiJci.x for some /, we 
can aggregate the two items; otherwise we obtain the optimal solution of the 
relaxed problem from the classical economic order quantity model, etc. 
Example 9.4 Consider a serial system with TV = 4 installations (items). The 
constant continuous demand for item 1 is J = 1. Ordering and echelon hold-
ing costs are given in Table 9.1.

First we want to solve the relaxed problem, i.e., we want to minimize the 
costs in (9.17) with respect to (9.18). First consider items 1 and 2. Note that 
Ailex = 5/4 > A2/e2 = 2/10. This means that Qi = Q2 in the optimal solution, 
and we can aggregate items 1 and 2 into a single item with ordering cost A] 
-^ A2 = 70 and echelon holding cost e^ + 62=140. We can now see that ^^4/^4 
= 12.5 > A^/es = 3 > (^1 + A2y( ex + 62) = 0.5. The constraints (9.18) will 
therefore not be binding for the remaining three items: items 1 and 2 to-
gether, item 3, and item 4. By optimizing each batch quantity separately, we 
obtain the optimal solution of the relaxed problem: Q\ = Q2'= (2d{ Ax + A2)l{ 
ex + e2)f^ = \^'^ = 1, gs = 6^^^ and Q^ = 15^'^ = 5. The corresponding costs 
per time unit are: C1+2 = (2<i( Ax + ^2)( ^1 + ej))^'^ = 140, C3 = 6^^^ and C4 = 
50. The total relaxed costs are then C,,/ = 190 + 6^^^ = 192.45. (The corre-
sponding Lagrangean multipliers in (9.20) are X2 = 30, Ji^ = 0, and A4 = 0. 
This means that ej =40 + 60 = 100 and ^2 = 100-60 = 40. The ratios 
Ax I e\ and ^2 /^2 ^^^ ^^en both equal to 0.5, which implies identical batch 
quantities when optimizing (9.21).)

Next we round the order quantities to obtain Roundy's feasible solution. 
Let us first, for simplicity, set g = 1 in (9.22). We then obtain the rounded 
batch quantities Qi = Qi = ^, Q3 = 2, and Q4 = 4. This gives the costs C == 
193.75, i.e., 0.68 percent above the relaxed costs and well below the guar-
anteed 6 percent. It turns out that an optimal q in (9.22) is ^ = 1.0626 (we 
omit the details). When using this q, it is optimal to use the same multiples, 
i.e., Qi = Q2 = q, Q3 = 2q, and Q4 = 4q. The corresponding costs are 193.39, 
i.e., 0.49 percent above the relaxed costs to be compared to the guaranteed 2 
percent. 
Note, however, that this is not the optimal solution. A feasible solution is 
to use Qi = gi = 1, 04 ^ 5, and to have Q3 = 2 and Q3 = 3 every second time. 
This nonstationary solution gives the costs C = 192.5, i.e., only 0.026 per-
cent above the lower bound from the relaxed problem. Why is this solution 
so good? Note first that the costs for item 3 are very low. Furthermore, Q2, = 
2 and Q3 = 3 work equally well. The best individual solutions for items 1, 2 
and 4 is gi = ^2 "^ Ij and Q4 "= 5, and these batch quantities are combined 
with having Q3 = 2 and gs = 3 every second time. 
The corresponding solution for an assembly system is similar. The solution 
for a distribution system is different, however. For a distribution system it is 
generally not possible to keep the batch quantities constant. Instead, the cy-
cle times are kept constant and it is required that they can be expressed as 
powers-of-two times some basic period. 
To see that constant cycle times can give time-varying batch quantities in 
a distribution system with constant demand, consider the system in Figure 
9.6. 
Figure 9.6 A simple distribution system. 
Assume that customer demands at installations 1 and 2 are 2 units per time 
unit, and that the cycle times are To= I, Ti=^ 1/2 and T2 = 2. The batches at 
installations 1 and 2 are, of course, constant and equal to 1 and 4, respec-

 
23 6 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
lively. But the batches at installation 0 are 2 and 6 every second time. During 
a cycle time To= I, there is always a demand for two batches of size 1 from 
installation 1. However, the demand from installation 2 is 4 units every sec-
ond cycle. 
9.3 Time-varying demand 
Let us now instead consider time-varying discrete demand. As before, we as-
sume that the lead-times are zero. No shortages are allowed and it is as-
sumed that the customer demands take place in the beginning of a period 
immediately after a possible delivery. Except that we are dealing with more 
than one echelon, the assumptions are consequently exactly the same as in 
Sections 4.5-4.9. 
9.3.1 Sequential lot sizing 
Consider again the simple serial system in Figure 9.7 and the following ex-
ample. 
Figure 9.7 A simple serial inventory system. 
Example 9.5 Assume that ordering and holding costs are the same as in Ex-
amples 9.2 and 9.3, i.e., the ordering costs are A\ = 20 and Ai = 80, and the 
holding costs per unit and time unit are hi = 5 and h2 = 4. We consider a time 
horizon of four periods with customer demands for item 1 equal to d] = 3, dj 
= 6, ^3 = 5, and d4 = 2. 
As in Example 9.2 we shall first solve the problem sequentially and dis-
regard its multi-stage structure. This is a common approach in practice. We 
start with the end item, item 1, for which we know the demands. After de-
termining batch quantities for item 1 we know the demands for item 2, i.e., 
the orders from installation 1, and are also able to determine batch quantities 
for this item. It is easy to determine the optimal solution for item 1 when dis-

 
MULTI-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
237 
regarding item 2 by applying the Wagner-Whitin algorithm with the ordering 
cost Ai = 20 and the holding cost h] = 5. Since there are only four periods, it 
is also easy to derive the optimal solution by considering all feasible alterna-
tives. Note first that due to the high holding cost, the demands in periods 1-3 
should be covered by separate deliveries. Given this we can see that the 
batch in period 3 should also cover the demand in period 4. The optimal so-
lution for item 1 is consequently to have three batches. The first batch has 
size 3 and covers the demand in period 1, the second batch has size 6 and 
covers the demand in period 2, and the third batch has size 7 and covers the 
demands in periods 3 and 4. It is also easy to see that the costs Ci for item 1 
are 
Q =3-20 + 2-5 = 70, 
i.e., three ordering costs plus the holding costs during period 3 for the de-
mand in period 4. 
The solution for item 1 implies that the demands for item 2 in periods 1-
4 are 3, 6, 7, and 0, respectively, i.e., the demands occur when we produce 
item 1. Given these demands, the ordering cost A2 = 80, and the holding cost 
h2 = 4, it is easy to conclude that the optimal solution for item 2 is to have a 
single batch of size 16 in period 1. The total holding costs for item 2 are then 
80, and there are still some holding costs left if we add another order, which 
would incur the additional ordering cost 80. The costs for item 2 are ob-
tained as 
C2 =80 + 6-4 + 2-7-4 = 160, 
and the total costs as 
C = Ci+C2 =70 + 160 = 230. 
The solution obtained is not optimal. We minimized the costs for item 1 
without considering the implications for item 2. It is easy to find a better so-
lution. Choose instead to have a single batch of size 16 for both item 1 and 
item 2. We then obtain the costs as 
C| =20 + 6-5 + 2-5-5 + 3-2-5=130, 
C2 = 80, 

 
238 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
C = Ci+C2 -210. 
As expected, this solution means additional costs for item 1. But the cost re-
duction for item 2 is larger. It is possible to show that this is the optimal so-
lution. 
9,3.2 Sequential lot sizing with modified parameters 
Let us now consider an alternative relatively simple approximate technique, 
which was suggested by Blackburn and Millen (1982). When using this tech-
nique we still determine the lot sizes sequentially. However, we use modi-
fied cost parameters. When dealing with the two-echelon serial system in 
Figure 9.7, we still start with item 1. Instead of the original cost parameters, 
however, we use the modified parameters (9.14) and (9.15), which give the 
optimal solution in case of constant demand. 
Example 9.6 We shall solve the problem in Example 9.5 by applying the 
suggested technique. Recall that A\ = 20, A2 = 80, hi = 5, and A2 = 4. The 
customer demands for item 1 are di = 3, d2 = 6, d3 = 5, and d^ = 2. 
In Example 9.3 we determined the optimal k= \. Note that the optimal k 
is not affected by the demand, see (9.13). From (9.14) and (9.15) we get A[ = 
Ai+ A2= 100, and h{ = ei + ^2 = 5. If we use these modified cost parameters 
and solve the problem for item 1 by the Wagner-Whitin algorithm, we obtain 
the optimal solution, i.e., a single batch of size 16 in period 1. Item 2 has no 
upstream installation so we use the original parameters A2 = 80 and /?2 = 4. 
Since there is a single demand in period 1 it is obvious that we will have a 
single batch in period 1. 
Let us now leave the simple serial system and consider a general assembly 
system. See Figure 9.8. 
Recall that in an assembly system each installation has at most one down-
stream successor. We can also, without any lack of generality, assume that 
one unit of each component is needed when producing one unit of a parent 
item. Lot sizing for an assembly system is more difficult than for a serial 
system. Yet it is much easier to deal with an assembly system than with a 
general system. 
It is possible to generalize the approximate technique of Blackburn and 
Millen (1982) to assembly systems. Let 
s(j) = the installation which is an immediate successor of installation j . 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
239 
p{j) = the set of installations which are immediate predecessors of 
installation j . 
In Figure 9.8 we have, for example, ^(4) = 3, and/>(3) ={4, 5}.

to be a positive integer. Note that (9.24) - (9.26) can be seen as generaliza-

Example 9.7 Consider the assembly system in Figure 9.8. Table 9.2 illus-
trates how the modified ordering and holding costs are obtained. The origi-
nal costs Aj and hj are given. We get the echelon holding costs from (9.23) 
starting with items 2, 4, and 5, which have no predecessors. Consider again 
items 2, 4 and 5. For these items A/ = Aj and hy' = ej. We can then also get 
the ratios kj for these items from (9.26) (rounded to integers). Next we go to 
item 3. We get ^3' and h^' from (9.24) and (9.25). Thereafter we can deter-
mine ks. Finally we obtainv^i' and hi\

9.3.3 Other approaches 
It is also possible to solve quite large lot sizing problems exactly for assem-
bly systems with deterministic time-varying demand by using mathematical 
programming techniques. See Afentakis et al. (1984) and Rosling (1986). 
Such an approach would, however, be difficult to use in practice if there are 
many items and complex product structures. 
There are also various other approximate techniques. One example is 
Graves (1981), who suggests an iterative procedure. 
Furthermore, it may sometimes be possible to simplify the lot-sizing 
problem by initially showing that some items should always be produced in 
identical batch sizes. A general assembly system can be seen as a number of 
subsystems with two levels. See Figure 9.9. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - LOT SIZING 
241 
Figure 9.9 Two-level assembly subsystem. 
Assume that the installations in Figure 9.9 have ordering costs Aj and 
echelon holding costs e/. It is possible to show that all installations should 
use the same batch sizes provided that the following condition is satisfied 
(Axsater and Nuttle, 1987). 
S-^y 
J^l 
A, 
/ = 2,3,...,A^. 
(9.27) 
Note that the condition is sufficient but not necessary. Recall that we have 
already discussed a special case of this condition in connection with (9.13). 
If we always use the same batch quantities in the subsystem in Figure 9.9, 
we only need stock of item 1. This means, as we have discussed in Section 
9.1.1, that the subsystem can be replaced by a single item with ordering cost 
^1 + ^2 + â¢â¢â¢ + ^A^ and echelon holding cost ^i + ^2 + â¢â¢â¢ + ^yv-
9.3A Concluding remarks 
We have seen that it is difficult to determine optimal lot sizes for multi-
echelon inventory systems, although we have assumed given deterministic 
demand. In most practical situations it is necessary to use simple approxi-

 
242 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
mations. However, even when using approximations it may be possible to let 
theoretical results have an impact on the heuristic rules. 
For assembly systems and systems that resemble assembly systems, it is 
very often practical to let upstream batch quantities be integer multiples of 
downstream batch quantities, although this does not need to be optimal. 
For serial and assembly systems, an optimization of the batch quantities 
will, in general, lead to larger lot sizes as compared to a simple sequential 
technique where different items are considered separately. Furthermore, we 
recall that stochastic demand variations will also make it advantageous to 
use larger batch quantities (Section 6.1). Note however, that these conclu-
sions are only based on ordering costs, holding costs and possibly shortage 
costs. The conclusions do not take capacity constraints into account. In Sec-
tion 7.2 we have discussed different possibilities to smooth the production 
load. A cyclical planning system can be used to smooth the load also in a 
multi-stage environment. But if it is not feasible for some reason to use a cy-
clical planning system, the remaining possibility is quite often to reduce the 
batch quantities in order to smooth the flow of orders. This means that we 
have conflicting goals. We wish to have large batches due to the multi-
echelon structure, but on the other hand we want to have small batches to get 
a smooth production load. It is difficult to know how to handle such a situa-
tion, but in general, it is more important in practice to get smooth capacity 
utilization than to reduce ordering and holding costs. See also Axsater 
(1986).

Consider the following production process. 
/XJAy-U 
The final demand at site 3 is 100 units/day. No backorders are allowed. Del-
iveries at site 1 come from a supplier, which delivers a full batch immediat-
ely on request. The ordering cost is 1500. For the two production stages we 
have: 
Stage 1: Production rate (pi) = 300 units/day, 
Stage 2: Production rate (pi) "= 200 units/day. 
The setup costs for each production stage is 750. The holding costs are 1 in 
stock 1, 2 in stock 2, and 3 in stock 3. Determine the optimal batch quantity. 
Production at production stage 2 starts as soon as there are units available in 
stock 2. When a unit has passed production stage 2, it is immediately 
delivered to stock 3. 
9.2 
A batch Q is processed in two machines and is then transported to a ware-
house. The demand at the warehouse is constant and continuous. No back-
orders are allowed. During a cycle Q units are placed in front of the first 
machine. Units which are processed in the first machine, are successively 
processed in the second machine. When all Q units have passed the second 
machine, the batch is transported to the warehouse. Use the following 
assumptions and notation and determine the optimal batch quantity.

10 MULTI-ECHELON SYSTEMS: 
REORDER POINTS 
This chapter deals with various techniques for determining safety stocks and 
reorder points in multi-echelon inventory systems. Throughout the chapter 
we assume that the batch quantities are given. 
The methods for determining safety stocks and reorder points described 
in Chapter 5 are not directly applicable in a multi-echelon inventory system. 
The reason is, again, that different installations cannot be handled separately. 
A fundamental problem in connection with multi-level inventory systems is 
to find the best balance between upstream and downstream stock. As we 
have already discussed in Section 8.1, it is clear that inventories at different 
levels will support each other. For example, if there is a large safety stock of 
a final product, it is possible to accept some production delays and it may 
consequently be feasible to have relatively low safety stocks of different 
components of the product. For inventories in a distribution system there are 
similar dependencies. Consider a two-level distribution system with a central 
warehouse and a number of retailers. With a large central inventory, orders 
from the retailers will very seldom be delayed and it may be possible to re-
duce the local safety stocks at the retailers. 
In general, it is very difficult to allocate safety stocks optimally in a 
multi-echelon system. Quite often we have to be satisfied with a reasonable 
"second best" solution. Still, in most situations it is important to adapt the 
solutions in some way to the multi-echelon environment. See Muckstadt and 
Thomas (1980), and Hausman and Erkip (1994). In those cases where no ef-
ficient methods are available, it is still usually possible to evaluate at least a 
few alternative solutions by simulation. 

 
248 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
The allocation of safety stocks in a multi-stage inventory system concerns 
two related questions. The first question is how much total system safety 
stock is needed. The second question is how to allocate the stock among the 
different installations. For example, how much of the total safety stock 
should be placed early, respectively late, in the material flow. This distribu-
tion is affected by various factors. One such factor is the structure of the 
system. In a distribution system (Figure 8.2) there are few installations early 
in the material flow as compared to an assembly system (Figure 8.3). In gen-
eral, it is advantageous to allocate safety stocks where there are few items 
with high and relatively stable demand. This indicates that it could be more 
reasonable to keep safety stock early in the material flow for a distribution 
system than for an assembly system. 
There are, however, other factors which may point in the other direction. 
In production, the holding costs are often quite low early in the material 
flow. This means that it can be a good policy to have relatively large safety 
stocks of various components in an assembly system. 
The allocation of safety stocks should also be affected by the lead-times. 
Consider again the distribution system in Figure 8.2. If the warehouse lead-
time is very long as compared to the lead-times of the retailers, relatively 
more stock should be kept at the warehouse. 
Note also that we can improve the service in different ways. Sometimes a 
safety time is a better alternative than a safety stock. This is the case for a 
component which is used only a few times per year when producing a higher 
level item. If we use a safety time in an MRP system, we will only stock the 
item during a short time just before it is needed in production. 
Safety stocks and safety times in production are largely due to uncertain 
lead-times. One question that should always be raised is whether it is possi-
ble to reduce the uncertainty and hence avoid large safety stocks. To do that 
it is often necessary to have more, or possibly more flexible, production ca-
pacity, so that production delays due to various disturbances will not be too 
long. Safety capacity can be an alternative to safety stocks. There will, how-
ever, always remain some uncertainty both in the lead-times and in the de-
mand for final items. 
10.1 The Clark-Scarf model 
The best-known technique for determining safety stocks in a multi-echelon 
inventory system was presented by Clark and Scarf (1960). This was also the 
origin of the echelon-inventory measure. Their method, which is exact for 
serial systems, can be seen as a decomposition technique. In the first step we 
consider the most downstream installation facing customer demand. Short-

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS

ages at the next upstream installation lead to stochastic delays, which will 
imply certain additional costs. These additional costs are evaluated and 
added as shortage costs when determining an optimal policy for the next up-
stream installation. 
10.1.1 Serial system 
We shall first describe the Clark-Scarf technique for the simple two-level se-
rial system in Figure 10.1. Our assumptions are somewhat different from 
those in Clark and Scarf (1960), who considered a finite time horizon. We 
assume an infinite horizon as in Federgruen and Zipkin (1984a,b). For more 
details and further aspects we refer to Van Houtum (2001) and Van Houtum 
etal. (2001). 
Figure 10.1 The considered two-echelon serial inventory system. 
We assume periodic review. The continuous period demand at installa-
tion 1 is assumed to be normally distributed and independent across periods. 
(It is straightforward to generalize to other distributions.) Demand that can-
not be met directly from stock is backordered. Installation 1 replenishes from 
installation 2, and installation 2 replenishes from an outside supplier with in-
finite supply. We assume that the lead-times (transportation times) are inte-
gral numbers of periods. There are standard holding and backorder costs but 
no ordering or setup costs. 
It is assumed that all events take place in the beginning of a period in the 
following order: 
1. 
Installation 2 orders. 
2. 
The period delivery from the outside supplier arrives at installation 2. 
3. 
Installation 1 orders from installation 2. 
4. 
The period delivery from installation 2 arrives at installation 1. 
5. 
The stochastic period demand takes place at installation 1.

D{n) =

y2 
= 
echelon stock inventory position at installation 2 in period ^ just 
before the period demand, 
ji 
= 
realized (echelon stock) inventory position at installation 1 in 
period t + L2 just before the period demand. 
The realized inventory position at installation 1 does not include out-
standing orders, which are backordered at installation 2. 
Our purpose is to minimize the total expected holding and backorder 
costs per period. We consider the holding costs for stock on hand at the in-
stallations, i.e., we do not include the expected holding costs for units in 
transportation from installation 2 to installation 1, ^2/^1 â¢ These costs are 
not affected by the control policy. 
Recall that for installation 1 there is no difference between installation 
and echelon stock, and that ei = hi-h2 can be interpreted as the holding cost 
on the value added when going from installation 2 to installation 1. 
We use the notation x'^ = max (x, 0), x~ = max (-x, 0), and x'^ -x'^ 
x. 
Let t be an arbitrary period. After ordering in period /, installation 2 has a 
certain echelon stock inventory position y2. At this stage we do not assume 
anything about the ordering policy. Because the outside supplier has infinite 
supply, there is no difference between the inventory position and the realized 
inventory position. Consider then the echelon stock inventory level at in-
stallation 2 in period t + L2 just before the period demand, ILj . We can ex-
press ILl as IL2 =y2 -D{L2), ^-O-.yi minus the stochastic demand during 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
251 
the L periods ^, ^ + 1, ... , ^ + Z2 - 1. We are then using the standard argument 
that was introduced in Section 5.3.2. All that was included in the inventory 
position after the order in period t has arrived in stock in period t -^ L2. Or-
ders after period t are still outstanding. Note that the customer demand in pe-
riod t + Li has not taken place at this stage. D{L'2) has mean ^^ = Li/d and 
standard deviation cr2 = {L2)^'^(7. 
Next, we consider the realized echelon stock inventory position y\ at in-
stallation 1 after ordering in period / + L2. Recall that the difference between 
inventory position and realized inventory position is that the realized inven-
tory position does not include outstanding orders that are backordered at in-
stallation 2. Again we do not assume anything about the ordering policy. 
Note, however, that whatever policy is followed we must have 
y,< 
IL\ = y^-D{L2). 
(10.1) 
In case of strict inequality, the difference is positive installation stock at in-
stallation 2. 
The (installation stock) inventory level at installation 1 after the demand 
in period ^ + Zi + Z2 is, by using our standard argument, obtained asyi minus 
the demand in periods ^ + Z2, ^ + Z2 +1, ... , ^ + ^2 + ^u i-^-, the demand dur-
ing Z] + 1 periods, D{L\ + 1). Note that whatever policy is followed, y\ is in-
dependent of this demand, which has mean /7{'= {L\ + 1)// and standard 
deviation a[' = (Zi + 1)^^V. 
For installation 2, we shall consider the ordering in period t and the costs 
in period / + Z2. For installation 1, we consider the ordering in period / + Z2 
and the costs in period / + Z2 + Zi. Note that all these periods can be seen as 
arbitrary periods. 
The installation stock inventory on hand at installation 2 just after the 
order from installation 1 is {IL\Y = IL^-yx. This is then the installation in-
ventory status at installation 2 during the whole period. 
Using this, we can now express the average holding costs at installation 2 
in period ^ + Z2 as 
C2 = h^E{IL\ -y,) = h^Eiy^ 
-D{Lj)-y,) 
(10.2) 
= ^2(3^2 
-i^2)-h2y\-
Similarly, the average period costs at installation 1 (evaluated after the pe-
riod demand has taken place) in period t + L2+ L\ are obtained as

+ b,E{{y, 
-D{L,+\))-) 
(10.3) 
= h,{y,-^'^) 
+ {h, +b,)E{{y, -D{L, +1))-). 
Recall that so far, we have not assumed anything about the ordering policies 
used at the two considered installations. Whatever ordering policy is used it 
must result in some y2 in period t and some yx in period t -^ L2. We note that 
the total expected period costs are completely determined by 3^2 and yi, so 
when looking for the optimal policy we do not need to consider any other 
parameters. 
It is now convenient to reallocate the costs slightly. The last term in 
(10.2), - h2y] is transferred to stage 1. Using that hi-h2 
= eu we obtain: 
C2=h2(y2-M2l 
(10.4) 
and 
Ci =ei7, -h^Ml'+ih 
+b,)E{{y, -D{L, +1))"). 
(10.5) 
Of course this reallocation does not affect the total costs. Since the trans-
ferred term is normally negative, Q may very well also become negative. 
Observe now that (10.4) is independent of j^i. The costs (10.5) at stage 1 
may depend on 3^2 due to (10.1). However, it turns out that the optimal policy 
at installation 1 is independent of j^2- To see this, let us for a moment forget 
that the realized inventory position yx may depend on jV2- We simply assume 
that we can choose any value of yx. We denote this value j)|. This means 
that we replace (10.5) by

Note that the optimization of (10.6) is essentially a newsboy problem. See 
Section 5.13. Let y\ be the optimal solution. 
Consider now (10.1). If j^2 - ^(^2) ^ y\ we obtain the optimal solution if 
we have 3/1 =y\ . But if j^2 - ^(^2) < i'l*, the best possible value of 71 isjvi "^ 
yi - D{L2) due to the convexity of (10.6). But this optimal policy can be re-
alized if we apply an (echelon stock) order-up-to-^S policy with S^ = j) *. 
Note that this optimal policy at installation 1 is completely independent of 
j2- Furthermore, the optimal policy is easy to obtain from (10.8). (Recall that 
there is no difference between echelon stock and installation stock at instal-
lation 1, so we can also see the obtained pohcy as an installation stock policy 
with S\ - j)*.) 
Note that if ei = 0, or equivalently if ^i = ei, (10.8) implies that Sf = j)* 
-^ 00. This means that installation 2 will never carry any stock. To under-
stand this, note that in a serial system the whole consumption takes place at 

 
254 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
installation 1. If there is no difference in holding costs, we can just as well 
move all stock to installation 1. In a distribution system this is no longer the 
case. It can be advantageous to retain stock at an upstream installation be-
cause it is then still possible to allocate the stock to alternative lower level 
sites. See Section 10.1.2. 
It remains to determine the optimal policy at installation 2. The only re-
maining decision parameter is y2. We consider the total costs assuming that 
we use the optimal policy at installation 1. We obtain the costs from (10.4) 
and (10.6). Since>^i =5f if/)(l2) <y2 - ^f, andj^i =3/2 -^(Zi) forD(L2) >

Note that the costs in (10.9) include the costs at installation 1 under the as-
sumption that installation 1 uses the optimal policy. The last term in (10.9) 
can be seen as the shortage costs at installation 2 induced by its inability to 
deliver on time to installation 1. It is easy to verify that C2 (y2) is convex in 
y2, which means that we only have to look for a local minimum. Denote the 
optimal solution by 3^2 â¢ Because the outside supplier has infinite supply it is 
obvious that it is optimal to apply an echelon stock order-up-to-iS policy with 
^ 2 
=y2' 
Example 10.1 Consider a system with the following data: Zi = Z2 = 5, // = 
10, (7= 5, Cx = 0.5, 62 = 1, and bi = 10. In the first step we determine 
Cj (j)|) according to (10.6). A graph is given in Figure 10.2. 
The optimal ^Sf = jp* = 81.0 is obtained from (10.8). The corresponding 
costs are Q =-47.0. 
In the next step we determine the total costs C2(y2)f^om (10.9), see Fig-
ure 10.3. The optimal echelon stock order-up-to level is S2 -y2 "^ 129.7, 
giving the total costs C2 = 39.4 . 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
255 
Note that the total costs are relatively flat, and particularly that the costs 
do not increase especially rapidly for low values of 3^2- This is typical for 
multi-echelon inventory systems. Furthermore, optimal upstream stocks are, 
in general, surprisingly low. The average optimal inventory level at installa-
tion 2 is Si - 1U2 - 5f = 129.7 - 50 - 81.0 = - 1.3.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
The described technique is easy to generaUze to more than two echelons. 
The additional costs at installation 2 due to insufficient supply are then used 
as the shortage costs at installation 3, etc. It is also easy to generalize to a 
batch-ordering policy at the most upstream installation (installation 2 in our 
case). 
We have assumed echelon stock policies since this simplifies the deriva-
tion. Otherwise this is not important, though. As shown in Section 8.2.3, we 
can, under general conditions, replace echelon stock S policies by equivalent 
installation stock S policies. The corresponding installation stock inventory 
positions are Sj = S2- Si , and *S( = Sf. However, if we start with initial in-
ventory positions that are above the optimal order-up-to positions, the eche-
lon stock policy is still optimal while the installation stock policy may fail. 
For two levels and normally distributed demand, i.e., the case that we 
have considered, the exact solution is relatively easy to obtain, see Feder-
gruen and Zipkin (1984a,b). However, in a general case the computations 
can be very time consuming. Van Houtum and Zijm (1991) have developed 
approximate techniques. One approximation is exact for demand distribu-
tions of mixed Erlang type. A different type of approximation based on sepa-
rate single-stage problems has been suggested by Shang and Song (2003). 
It can be shown that the Clark-Scarf approach can also be used for assem-
bly systems. Rosling (1989) has demonstrated that an assembly system can 
be replaced by an equivalent serial system when carrying out the computa-
tions. Chen and Song (2001) have generalized the Clark-Scarf model to de-
mand processes where demands in different time periods may be correlated. 
10.1.2 The Clark-Scarf approach for a distribution system 
Let us now instead consider the distribution system in Figure 10.4. It is 
common to use the Clark-Scarf approach also for such systems, but the ap-
proach is then no longer exact. The approximation is based on a so-called 
"balance'' assumption, which essentially means that an upstream installation 
is allowed to make negative allocations to its downstream neighbors. This 
implies that the total stock at the downstream neighbors can be optimally 
distributed between the sites in any period. The technique was sketched in 
the original paper by Clark and Scarf (1960). Eppen and Schrage (1981) 
used the approach in a model with identical retailers and normally distrib-
uted demand where the central warehouse was not allowed to carry any 
stock. Their model was extended in a number of ways, including non-identi-
cal retailers and stock at the warehouse, by Federgruen and Zipkin (1984a,c). 
See also Federgruen (1993), and Diks and de Kok (1998). 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS

As in Section 10.1.1, let us assume periodic review and normally distrib-
uted period demands at the retailers. The demands at the retailers are inde-
pendent across periods and retailers. The retailers replenish their stocks from 
the warehouse, and the warehouse replenishes its stock from an outside sup-
plier with infinite stock. We assume that all installations apply echelon stock 
order-up-to-iS policies.

We shall use the following notation:

yj

A major difference compared to Section 10.1.1 is that we now have a 
number of parallel installations at the downstream level. Otherwise we can 
say that the warehouse corresponds to installation 2 and the retailers to in-
stallation 1 in Section 10.1.1. We assume that all events take place in the 
same order as in Section 10.1.1. 
Again we consider an arbitrary period t. The echelon stock level at the 
warehouse at time t + LQ, just before the period demand, is obtained as S^ 
minus the total system demand during LQ periods, DQ(LO). 
We consider the costs at retailer y in period t + LQ + Lj. Using the same 
cost allocation technique as in Section 10.1.1, we obtain the costs at the 
warehouse and at retailerj in complete analogy with (10.4) and (10.5). (Re-
call that;;^ is the realized inventory position.)

where &'^ ~ {Lj +1)^ ^^j- L^t j)* be the optimal solution. 
In analogy with the optimal solution in the serial case, it may now seem 
reasonable to allocate 5j = j)* to each retailer provided that the sum of all 
5y does not exceed the echelon stock inventory level at the warehouse. This 
is also what we will do, but it is important to understand that this is just an 
approximation. 
Assume, for example, that we have only two identical retailers and that in 
a certain period we are able to allocate S^ ~ S^ to each of them. After this 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
259 
allocation we get a large period demand at retailer 2 and no demand at all at 
retailer 1. This means that we would like to allocate up to 5*1 at retailer 2 in 
the next period. But this may not be possible due to insufficient supply at the 
warehouse. In that case we will get unequal realized inventory positions at 
the two retailers. However, it is rather obvious that it would be better to dis-
tribute the inventory positions equally. This might have been possible if we 
had saved some more stock at the warehouse in the preceding period, i.e., if 
we had not allocated 5f = Sj to both retailers. Due to this "balance" prob-
lem the decision rule that was optimal in the serial case is now only ap-
proximate. 
The considered approximation is often denoted the "balance" approxima-
tion since it means that we disregard the possibility of unbalanced retailer 
inventory positions. Another interpretation is that we also allow negative al-
locations from the warehouse to the retailers. An implication is that in a two-
echelon system, given this approximation and if the holding costs at all in-
stallations are the same, then there is no reason to keep stock at the ware-
house. 
Let us now accept the "balance" approximation and also take into account 
that we cannot always allocate Sj to each retailer. Assume that the available 
amount is v<S^ =^ 
,_ Sj , Given that negative allocations are possible it 
is "optimal" to solve the following myopic allocation problem: 
C,(v)= min Y.Cj(yj), 
(10.13) 
and C^(v) provides the corresponding retailer costs. If we relax the con-
Vj < V by a Lagrange multiplier A>0, the solution of (10.13) 
can be obtained from 
O 
CQ -\-bj - X

(10.14) 
which is a slight variation of (10.12).

where

The "balance" assumption means that we assume that the warehouse 
stock can be used more efficiently than what is possible in reality. Therefore, 
CQ (SQ ) is a lower bound for the real costs, and the optimal SQ is lower than 
what would be optimal. 
When implementing the solution we cannot allocate negative quantities to 
the retailers. Therefore the actual allocations are determined by solving a 
modified version of the myopic allocation problem (10.13). Let Xj denote the 
realized inventory position at retailery just before the allocation. 
C;(v)= mm f]Cj(yj), 
(10.16)

Note that C^(v) > C^(v), since (10.16) is more constrained than (10.13). 
The "balance" assumption has been used extensively in the inventory lit-
erature and has been shown to produce solutions of very good quality in 
many different situations, see for example Eppen and Schrage (1981), Fed-
ergruen and Zipkin (1984a,b,c), Federgruen (1993), Van Houtum et al 
(1996), Verrijdt and de Kok (1996), Van der Heijden et al. (1997), Diks and 
de Kok (1998, 1999), Dogru et al. (2005) and references therein. Still the 
"balance" assumption may be less appropriate in situations with large differ-
ences between the retailers in terms of service requirements and demand 
characteristics. Other allocation approaches that are not based on the "bal-
ance" assumption have been suggested by e.g., Erkip (1984), Jackson 
(1988), Jackson and Muckstadt (1989), McGavin et al. (1993), Graves 
(1996), and Axsater et al. (2002). 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS

10.2 The METRIC approach for distribution systems 
In multi-echelon inventory theory there are two classical approaches. One is 
the Clark-Scarf technique that we considered in Section 10.1. The other is 
the so-called METRIC approximation of Sherbrooke (1968, 2004), which 
has also been of great importance for the development of the field. In this 
section we will describe how this simple technique can be applied to a two-
level distribution system with independent Poisson demand processes at the 
retailers, complete backordering, and one-for-one replenishments. Ware-
house backorders are filled on a first come-first served basis. The structure 
of the inventory system is illustrated in Figure 10.4. 
A difference compared to Section 10.1 is that we consider continuous re-
view policies instead of periodic review policies. We shall choose to deal 
with installation stock (S - I, S) policies, or equivalently order-up-to-iS poli-
cies. The considered policy means that the installation stock inventory posi-
tion at an installation is kept equal to some S at all times. Because of the con-
tinuous review, each demand for a unit at a retailer will immediately trigger 
an order, i.e., a corresponding demand for a unit at the warehouse. The Pois-
son demand processes at the retailers are assumed to be independent. The 
warehouse demand is consequently a superposition of these independent 
Poisson processes and is therefore also a Poisson process. 
Our assumptions of Poisson demand, continuous review, and one-for-one 
replenishments are often reasonable for items with relatively low demand 
and high holding costs. Such items are, for example, common among spare 
parts. 
We introduce the following notation: 
A'^ = number of retailers, 
Li = transportation time for an item to arrive at retailer i from the ware-
house, i.e., the lead-time if the warehouse has stock on hand, 
LQ = replenishment lead-time for the warehouse, 
Xi = demand intensity at retailer /, 
AQ = y]._, ^i = demand intensity at the warehouse. 
Si = order-up-to installation inventory position at installation z, 
ILi= stochastic installation stock inventory level at installation z in 
steady state, 
Wo= stochastic delay at the warehouse in steady state due to stock-outs. 
For simplicity, we suppress superscript z for installation stock, e.g., we write 
So instead of SQ . 

 
262 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
As explained in Section 8.2.3 installation stock and echelon stock policies 
are equivalent for the considered inventory system. As a consequence, we 
can just as well use the corresponding echelon stock order-up-to positions: 
^0 = I.^o ^/' and 5f = S^ for / > 0. 
Our purpose is to evaluate the distributions of the inventory levels for 
given ordering policies. The optimization of ordering policies is considered 
in Section 10.4. For standard cost structures with holding and backorder 
costs, it can be shown that the optimal ^/-levels (/ = 0, 1, ..., N) are nonnega-
tive. We shall therefore assume that this is the case. 
When applying the METRIC approximation we first consider the ware-
house. It is easy to determine the distribution of the warehouse inventory 
level exactly. The inventory position is always SQ. We use our standard ap-
proach and consider an arbitrary time, t. At time t + LQ, all that is included in 
the inventory position at time t has reached the warehouse, and we can ex-
press the inventory level as So minus the demand in the interval (t, t + LQ], 
DoiUl 
ILo(t + Lo) = So-Do(Lo). 
(10.17) 
The demand in (/, t + LQ] has a Poisson distribution with mean AQLQ, and we 
obtain the exact steady state distribution as 
(10.18) 
Note that this is also true if the warehouse lead-times are independent 
stochastic variables with mean LQ due to Palm's theorem, see Section 5.15.3. 
Given the distribution of the inventory level, it is easy to determine the 
average inventory on hand as 
E{ILl) = Y,j-PiILo=j), 
(10.19) 
7=1 
and the average number of backorders as 

 
MULTI-ECHELON-REORDER POINTS 
263 
E(IL^) = I ; (-7) â¢ P{ILo = j), 
(10.20) 
or 
EiJLl) = E(IL;)-E(IL,) 
= E(ILl)-(So-AoLo). 
(10.21) 
It is normally more efficient to use (10.21) instead of (10.20), because we 
avoid an infinite sum. 
The warehouse can be interpreted as an (M/D/oo) queuing system, where 
the backorders are the waiting customers. This means that we can get the av-
erage delay at the warehouse according to Little's formula: 
EiW,)^E{IL-^)/Xo. 
(10.22) 
Because of the Poisson demand at the warehouse and the first come-first 
served assumption, the average delay is the same for all retailers. 
Consider now retailer /. The retailer lead-time is stochastic due to the de-
lays at the warehouse. However, we already loiow the average lead-time L^, 
i.e., the transportation time plus the average delay at the warehouse: 
L^ =Li+E{WQ). 
(10.23) 
The METRIC approximation simply means that the real stochastic lead-
time is replaced by its mean according to (10.23). (It may appear that Palm's 
theorem implies that this is an exact approach. This is not true, though, be-
cause successive stochastic delays at the warehouse depend on the inventory 
status at the warehouse and are not independent.) Given this approximation, 
we have a constant lead-time and can determine the distribution of the in-
ventory level precisely as we did for the warehouse in (10.18)

The determination of the average stock on hand and the average number of 
backorders parallels completely (10.19) - (10.21). Thus the approximation 
enables us to decompose the problem so that all installations can be handled 
as single-echelon systems. Note that the approach starts with the upstream

installation. When using the decomposition approach in Section 10.1 we 
start with the downstream installations. 
Example 10.2 Consider a system with the following data: N=2,LQ 
= Lx^ L2 
= 2A\= 0.1, M = 0.9, So = 2, Si =1, and S2 = 4. Note first that ^ = Ai + /I2 =

W Z S ) - i ; i - ^ ( ^ i o = i ) = l â ^ " ' + 2 â e - ^ = 0 . 5 4 1 , 
and 
Â£(/Io) = W 4 ) - ( ^ 0 - ^ 0 ^ 0 ) = 0.541-0 = 0.541. 
From (10.22) we have E{WQ) = Â£(11^)/AQ= 
0.541, and applying (10.23) 
we get 
For retailer 1 we obtain 
E(II^) ^ f^j. 
PilL, = J) = 1 .^:?^,-o.254i ^ 0 776 
and 
EilLJ) = EilL-^) - (5i - /liZi) = 0.776 - (1 - 0.254) = 0.030. 
For retailer 2 we similarly obtain ^(7^2) = 1.837 and Â£(/Z,2) = 0.124. Re-
call that the results for the retailers are approximate. 
The corresponding exact results are E(IL'l) = 0.777, ^(/L^) = 0.031, 
Â£(/L2) = 1-866, and EilLj)^ 
0.153. 
It is straightforward to extend the METRIC approach to more than two lev-
els. The analysis is then exact at the most upstream level, while all down-

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
265 
stream installations are handled approximately. It is also easy to handle 
compound Poisson demand. 
Furthermore, it is easy to generalize to a batch-ordering policy at the 
warehouse. Assume that the warehouse applies an installation stock (RQ, QQ) 
policy. The inventory position at the warehouse is then in steady state uni-
formly distributed on the integers RQ + 1, i?o + 2, ... , i?o + So- This means 
that (10.18) is replaced by 
1 
RQ+QO 
(2 
T 
\^~J 
(10.25) 
where we average over the uniformly distributed inventory position. There-
after we can use exactly the same procedure. 
The METRIC approximation has many advantages. It is simple and com-
putationally efficient. At this stage it seems to be the multi-echelon tech-
nique that has been applied most widely in practice. There are especially 
many military applications involving high-value repairable items. 
It is more difficult, though, to handle nonidentical batch-ordering retail-
ers. It is still relatively easy to determine the average delay at the warehouse. 
The problem is that the retailers normally face different average delays, and 
it is more difficult to determine the average delay for a specific retailer. One 
possibility is, of course, to disregard that the average delays are different for 
the retailers. This means an additional approximation. 
Quite a few approximate techniques for evaluation of general batch-or-
dering policies in distribution inventory systems are similar in spirit to the 
METRIC approach. In a two-level system a retailer is handled as a single-
echelon system but the parameters describing this system depend on the 
warehouse. See further Section 10.5.2.2. 
Muckstadt (1973) has shown how the METRIC framework can be ex-
tended to include a hierarchical or indented-parts structure (MOD-MET-
RIC). To illustrate the basic idea in Muckstadt's approach, consider a group 
of ^ items {j = 1,2, ... , n) that are controlled by (5 - 1,5) policies in a two-
level inventory system. We can use the METRIC approach to estimate the 
average waiting time for itemy at retailer /, E(Wij). Let us furthermore as-
sume that the considered items are exclusively used as modules when re-
pairing a certain assembly. Each retailer also has a stock of such assemblies. 
It is assumed that the assembly is repaired by exchanging exactly one of the 
items. The demand for itemy at retailer / is A^, and the demand for repairs at 

 
266 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
retailer / is consequently ^^ =^ 
._, y^ij â¢ Assume that the repair time at re-
tailer / is Ti. We can now estimate the average repair time, including waiting 
time, for modules as 
A- M 
When determining a suitable inventory policy for the assembly, we can then 
replace the stochastic total repair time by its mean 7]-. See also Rustenburg 
et al. (2003). 
10.3 Two exact techniques 
10.3.1 Disaggregation of warehouse backorders 
We shall now show how we can analyze the problem in Section 10.2 exactly. 
We refer to that section for the necessary notation. Our derivation essentially 
follows Graves (1985). The first derivation of exact steady-state inventory 
level distributions was carried out by Simon (1971). 
From (10.18) we have for A: > 0 
P{ILo =k) = PilLo = -k) = P{D, (Zo) - ^0 + ^) = ^ ^ ' ^ ' \ ' 
e-'^'^. 
(10.27) 
Now let 
Bi = number of backorders from retailer / at the warehouse in steady 
state, stochastic variable. 
E
AT 
_ 
._ Bi - ILQ . When a new backorder occurs, the probability that 
it emanates from retailer i is /l///lo due to the Poisson demand. Consequently, 
the conditional distribution of 5/ for a given IL^ is binomial and we have

Now consider retailer / at some arbitrary time t when the system is in 
steady state. St - Bt units are on their way to, or already at, retailer /. At time t 
+ Li all these units have reached retailer /, while ordered units backordered at 
the warehouse at time t and all orders that have been triggered after time t 
have still not reached the retailer. Consequently, using our standard approach 
we have 
ILi{t^Li)^Si-Bi-Di{Li), 
(10.29) 
or in other words, to get the inventory level at time t + Z/ we subtract the 
demand at retailer / in the interval (/, t + ZJ from the amount on route to, or 
already at, retailer / at time t. Note that the demand D,(Z,) is independent of 
Bi. The exact distribution of the inventory level at retailer / can therefore be 
obtained as 
PiILi=j) 
= P(B^ + D^m) = S^-j)

= Y^P{B,=k)

The considered derivation works very well for Poisson demand and one-
for-one replenishments. It is difficult, though, to use the approach in more 
general situations with batch-ordering retailers. The problem is that we can 
no longer use the binomial disaggregation of the warehouse backorders in 
(10.28). See Section 10.5.2.3. 
10.3.2 A recursive procedure 
We shall now again solve the problem in Section 10.2 exactly, but in a dif-
ferent way. The described procedure is a special case of a more general 
technique in Axsater (2000) that provides an exact solution for installation 

 
268 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
stock (i?, 0 policies and independent compound Poisson processes at the 
retailers. 
Consider retailer / and the lead-time for an ordered unit. The lead-time is 
evidently stochastic due to possible delays at the warehouse. The stochastic 
lead-time for an ordered unit is independent of the lead-time demand. Fur-
thermore, orders cannot cross in time due to the first come-first served as-
sumption. We have dealt with such lead-times in Section 5.15.2. 
Let 
J = stochastic lead-time demand at retailer i when averaging over the 
lead-time. 
It was shown in Section 5.15.2 that for this type of stochastic lead-time, the 
distribution of the inventory level can be determined by using the relation-
ship 
P(IL,=j) = P(J = S,-j), 
(10.31) 
i.e., essentially in the same way as for a constant lead-time. 
It remains to determine the distribution of J. Since we are dealing with (S 
- I, S) policies, each system demand triggers a retailer order for a unit that in 
turn, triggers a warehouse order for a unit. Consider a warehouse order for a 
unit at some time /. Because of the first come-first served assumption, the 
ordered unit will fill the ^So-th retailer order for a unit at the warehouse after 
the order. (If So = 0 the ordered unit will fill the retailer order that triggered 
the warehouse order.) This means that the considered ordered unit will be as-
signed to the retailer order triggered by the So-th system demand after the 
warehouse order. We are interested in the lead-time demand for an order 
from retailer i. Therefore we consider a situation where the ^'o-th system de-
mand occurs at retailer i. 
The iSo-th system demand after time t can occur either before or after the 
ordered unit has reached the warehouse. If the ordered unit has reached the 
warehouse the retailer lead-time is Z/, otherwise it is longer. Let 
u(SoJ) 
= P(iSo-th system demand occurs before the order has reached 
the warehouse and J <j), 
v(Soj') 
= P(So-th system demand occurs after the order has reached 
the warehouse and J <j). 
We can express the distribution function for / as 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
269 
PiJ<j) = u(Sâj) + v(SoJ). 
(10.32) 
Given u(So, j) and V{SQ, j), we can determine the distribution of the in-
ventory level from (10.31) and (10.32). 
P(IL,^j) = PiJ = S,-j) 
(10.33) 
= u(SQ,Si-j)-u(SQ,Si -J-1) 
+ V(SQ,S^ -j)-v{SQ,Si 
-j-l). 
It remains to determine the probabilities u{So,j) and v{So,j). 
It is easy to determine the probability v(So, j). The corresponding event 
occurs if there are first at most 5*0-1 system demands during the time LQ, and 
then at most j demands at retailer / during the lead-time Z/. Because there are 
at most So ' I system demands during the time Zo, the item is in stock at the 
warehouse when ordered by retailer /. The lead-time is therefore Z/. The two 
considered probabilities are independent. Consequently, 
^(SoJ') = \ y (^LQ) ^-;toLo 
y i^iLi) ^-X,L,. 
k-0 
k\ 
\k=0 
(10.34) 
We shall now show how to derive u{SoJ) recursively. If the ^So-th demand 
arrives before the time t + Zo, there are three mutually exclusive possibilities. 
In all three cases the unit ordered by retailer / will arrive at the retailer at 
time t + LQ + Li, i.e., it will not stop at the warehouse. In other words, it is 
ordered by retailer / before it has reached the warehouse. 
1. One possibility is that there are exactly SQ system demands during Zo, 
and at mostj demands at retailer / during the time Z/. After the item 
has been ordered by retailer i there is no more system demand until 
the item has reached the warehouse. This probability is given by the 
first term in (10.35) below. 
2. The second possibility is that there are at least 5o + 1 system demands 
during LQ, the (So + l)-th system demand is also at retailer /, and there 
are at mosty - 1 additional demands at retailer / before the time / + Zo 
+ Li. The probability for this can be expressed as {Ai/Ao)u(So + 1,7 - 1). 
This is the second term in (10.35). 
3. The third possibility is that there are at least iSo + 1 system demands 
during Zo, the (So + l)-th system demand is not at retailer /, and there 

 
270 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
are at mostj additional demands at retailer / before the time t + Zo+ Li. 
The probability for this can be expressed as ((/lo - Xi)IA^)u{SQ + 1,7). 
This is the third term in (10.35). 
Consequently, we have forj > 0

(10.36) 
Note that U{SQ , 7) -> 0 as ISQ -> 00 for any value of7. This follows from 
the definition. We can therefore first set u{So' + 1,7) = 0 for some large So' 
and all values of7. Thereafter we can first apply (10.36) for^ = 0, and then 
(10.35) fory > 0, recursively for 5*0 = So\ SQ'-X, ... , 0. Since the coefficients 
/I///I0 and (Ao - ^i)l^ in (10.35) and (10.36) are both strictly smaller than 1, 
the suggested numerical procedure is always stable. 
A related iterative procedure for the costs in case of Poisson demand and 
{S - \, S) policies is given in Axsater (1990). Forsberg (1995) and Axsater 
and Zhang (1996) generalize this procedure to compound Poisson demand. 
See also Axsater (1993c), which deals with periodic review. 
Normally, it is considerably more difficult to deal with models where all 
installations apply (i?, Q) policies as compared to the simpler (5-1, S) poli-
cies, which we have considered in Sections 10,2 - 10.3. However, the analy-
sis of (i?, 0 policies is simplified significantly by the important fact that the 
inventory positions of all installations are uniformly distributed and inde-
pendent in steady state, as in the single-echelon case. See Sections 10.5.2.1 
and 10.5.2.4. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS

10.4 Optimization of ordering policies 
When applying the Clark-Scarf approach in Section 10.1 we obtained the 
optimal policy as part of the approach. In Sections 10.2 and 10.3, however, 
we have focused on deriving the distributions of the inventory levels. We 
shall now add a standard cost structure to the considered model and show 
how the policy can be optimized. We assume that we have either obtained 
the exact probability distributions as in Section 10.3, or approximate distri-
butions as in Section 10.2. Let 
Si = installation stock order-up-to inventory position at installation /, 
(/ = 0, l,...,iV), 
hi = holding cost per unit and time unit at installation /, (/ = 0, 1,..., A^, 
bi = backorder cost per unit and time unit at retailer /, (/ = 1, 2, ... , A^, 
C = average system costs per time unit. 
The holding costs at the warehouse are not affected by the retailer inventory 
positions because the structure of the demand at the warehouse is not af-
fected if we change S^. Furthermore, the costs at retailer / are not affected by 
the order-up-to-inventory positions at the other retailers. Recall that these in-
ventory positions do not affect the demand at the warehouse. We therefore 
have 
Co(^o) 
- average holding costs per time unit at the warehouse, 
Ci (So, Si) = average holding and backorder costs per time unit at retailer 
z,(/-l,2,...,A0. 
Note that we have no explicit backorder costs at the warehouse. Backor-
ders at the warehouse will, however, cause delays for retailer orders and thus 
indirectly influence the costs at the retailers. 
The warehouse costs are obtained as 
C^(So) = h,EiILl), 
(10.37) 
and the costs at retailer / as 
C,(^0,Si) = hiEiILt) + biEilL-:). 
(10.38) 
The total costs can then be expressed as

C = CoiSo) + Y.^,(SoA)'

i=\ 
If we have determined the distribution of the inventory levels approxi-
mately as in Section 10.2, or exactly as in Section 10.3.1 or 10.3.2, it is easy 
to evaluate these costs. See (10.19) - (10.21). Recall that is more efficient to 
apply (10.21) than (10.20). It can be shown that the optimal order-up-to-lev-
els must be nonnegative. 
Consider now the costs at retailer i for a given value of SQ. It follows from 
the results in Section 5.9 that if the retailer lead-time were constant, the re-
tailer costs would be convex in St. This implies directly that Q (So, Si) is con-
vex in Si when using the approximate technique in Section 10.2, since we are 
then replacing the stochastic retailer lead-time by its mean. But this convex-
ity is also true in the exact case. To see this, recall that the lead-time for an 
ordered unit is independent of the lead-time demand, and that orders cannot 
cross in time. This means, as explained in Section 5.15.2, that the costs Ci(So, 
Si) can be seen as an average of costs for different constant lead-times, which 
implies convexity in Si. 
Furthermore, it is easy to find lower and upper bounds for the optimal S^. 
A lower bound, Si , can be found by optimizing Si for the shortest possible 
deterministic lead-time, Z/, and an upper bound, S^ , by optimizing Si for the 
longest possible lead-time, Lo + Li. 
For a given So, we can find the corresponding optimal Si (5o)by a simple 
local search where, starting with Si = Sf, we successively increase Si by one 
unit at a time until we find a local minimum of Q (SQ, SI). Note that this op-
timization can be done separately for each retailer. 
The optimization of C with respect to SQ is not that simple, though, since 
I 
(=1 
C(S,) = C,iS,) + f^qiSo,S;(S,)), 
(10.40) 
is not necessarily convex in iSo. We can, however, find a lower bound, SQ , 
by optimizing (10.39) with respect to 5*0 for Si =Sf , and similarly, an upper 
bound, SQ , by optimizing SQ for Si = Si . To find the optimal iS'o we then 
need to evaluate the costs (10.40) for all values of So within these bounds. 
See Axsater (1990) for details. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
273 
An optimization of the reorder points when the installations apply instal-
lation stock (R, Q) policies can normally be carried out in essentially the 
same way. An optimization of echelon stock (R, Q) policies requires some 
modifications. See Axsater (1997) or Chen and Zheng (1997). 
A joint optimization of reorder points and batch quantities is more com-
plex, though. It is therefore most common to determine the batch quantities 
in advance from a deterministic model. Recall that this is also the standard 
procedure for single-echelon systems and that the resulting errors are usually 
very limited. 
10.5 Batch-ordering policies 
10.5.1 Serial system 
We shall now generalize the model in Section 10.1.1 by considering more 
general echelon stock (R, Q) policies. As in Section 10.1.1, we shall deal 
with normally distributed demand, periodic review, and the two-level serial 
system in Figure 10.1. The events in a period also take place in the same or-
der, i.e., 
1. Installation 2 orders. 
2. The period delivery from the outside supplier arrives at installation 2. 
3. Installation 1 orders from installation 2. 
4. The period delivery from installation 2 arrives at installation 1. 
5. The stochastic period demand takes place at installation 1. 
6. Evaluation of holding and shortage costs. 
Let 
Li 
= lead-time (transportation time) for replenishments at installation i, 
ju 
= average period demand, 
(7 
= standard deviation of period demand, 
Ri 
= echelon stock reorder point at installation /, (Note that we write i?/ 
instead of i?f.) 
Qi = order quantity at installation /, 
Fi(x) = distribution function of the echelon stock inventory level at inst-
allation i, 
fi{x) = density of the echelon stock inventory level at installation/. 

 
274 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
We make the assumption that Q2 as well as the initial installation stock at 
installation 2 are integer multiples of Qi. This means that the installation 
stock inventory level at installation 2 is a multiple of Qi at all times. Recall 
from Section 8.2.3 that, given these assumptions, the class of echelon stock 
reorder point policies contains the class of installation stock reorder point 
policies as a subset. Furthermore, Chen (2000) has shown that echelon stock 
(R, Q) policies are optimal for serial systems under quite general conditions. 
We shall derive the probability distributions of the echelon stock inven-
tory levels. The derivation essentially follows Chen and Zheng (1994). 
Note first that the echelon stock inventory status of installation 2 com-
pletely parallels the status of a single-echelon inventory, see Section 5.3. 
Consider an arbitrary period, t. The echelon stock inventory position just af-
ter a possible order in period t (before the demand), IP2~(t), is in steady 
state uniformly distributed on the interval {R2, R2 + Qi)- The echelon stock 
inventory level in period t + L2 after the period demand, /Z2 (^ + Z2), is ob-
tained by subtracting the demands in periods /, / + 1, ... , ^ + Z2, i.e., the de-
mands during L2+ I periods, D(L2 + 1), 
ILl(t + 
L2)-IPi-{t)-D(L2+l).

The demand during Lj + I periods has mean /j'2 = (Z-2 + ^)M ^rid standard

(10.42) 
Given F2(x), we can, for example, evaluate the echelon holding costs at in-
stallation 2. 
Installation 1 orders from installation 2 before the demand in period t + 
L2. We are therefore also interested in the distribution of the inventory level 
at this point in time. Let 7X2" be the inventory level and /^C-^) ^^^ corre-
sponding distribution function. The only difference compared to (10.42) is 
that //2'^nd a2 are replaced by /J2 ^Lj/u and a2 = L2

The inventory position at installation 1, /Pi, after the review with the pos-
sibility to order is always in the interval (i?i, i?i + Qx\. Consequently, if 
IL^2 ^ ^1, we know that there is no installation stock at installation 2 after 
the review of the inventory position at installation 1. All stock included in 
/Z|~ must be on its way to, or already at, installation 1. The other possibility 
is that IL^2 > i?i. Recall now that the installation inventory level at installa-
tion 2 after the review at installation 1 is always a multiple of Qu ^^y jQi-
We haveygi - / i f -IP\ >R\ -{R\ +Q\) = -Q\ since IPx < R^ + Qx. But 
this means that 7 > 0. Consequently, there are no backorders at installation 2 
and all stock included in IPx must be on its way to, or already at, installation 
1. Note that given /Zf , we can obtain IPx uniquely from the conditions IP^ 
~ IL^2 - JQ\ ^^^ ^1 "^ ^P\ ^R\'^ Q\ since the second condition determinesy

Let us now again consider the two-echelon distribution system in Figure

We have considered the evaluation of order-up-to-iS policies in such in-
ventory systems in Sections 10.1.2, 10.2, and 10.3. We shall now, as in Sec-
tion 10.5.1, consider more general batch-ordering policies. But in contrast to 
Section 10.5.1, we shall mainly deal with continuous review policies. 
We start by providing some basic results in Section 10.5.2.1. Thereafter 
we discuss, in Sections 10.5.2.2 - 10.5.2.5, different approaches for evalua-
tion of batch-ordering policies. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
277 
10.5.2.1 Some basic results 
Let us first consider a simple special case. Assume that all retailers apply 5*-
policies. This means that their inventory positions are kept constant, and 
there is no difference between an echelon stock ( RQ , Qo) policy and an 
installation stock ( RQ , QQ) policy at the warehouse. The difference between 
the echelon stock inventory position and the installation stock inventory po-
sition at the warehouse is simply the sum of the constant retailer inventory 
positions. So although we shall consider installation stock policies, the fol-
lowing is also true for echelon stock policies. 
Consider first the case when also the warehouse applies an installation 
stock S policy. Let 
C(SQ,S{,...,S^J^) 
= total system costs per time unit for a given installation 
stock S policy. 
Assume that these costs can be evaluated for different policies using the 
techniques in Sections 10.1 - 10.3. Consider then instead an (RQ.QQ) policy 
at the warehouse. For discrete integral demand this means that the ware-
house inventory position is uniform on [RQ +1,RQ +2,...,RQ 
-\-QQ] and we 
obtain the total costs for the (RQ,QQ) policy at the warehouse by simply 
averaging over these inventory positions.

This means that it is easy to evaluate and optimize the ordering policy. Note 
also that we can, in a sense, force the retailers to order in "batches" while 
still using a simple S policy, if we use periodic review with a suitably long 
review period. 
Although multi-echelon inventory systems with general batch-ordering 
policies are difficult to analyze, there are some important properties of sin-
gle-echelon inventory systems that carry over to the multi-echelon case. One 
such property concerns the uniform distribution of the inventory position 
when using (i?, Q) policies. 
Consider first a distribution system with discrete demand (for example 
compound Poisson demand), where all installations apply installation stock 
(R, Q) policies. Let q be the largest common factor of all batch quantities go,

INVENTORY CONTROL 
2b â¢â¢â¢ â¢> QN' It is evident that all replenishments and all demands at the ware-
house are multiples oiq. Therefore it is natural to assume that also the ware-
house reorder point RQ , as well as the initial inventory position at the ware-
house are multiples of q. Let us furthermore assume that not all customer 
demands are multiples of some unit larger than one. Under these assump-
tions we have the following simple result (see e.g., Axsater, 1998). 
Proposition 10.1 (Installation stock (i?, Q) policies.) In steady state the in-
stallation stock inventory positions are independent. The warehouse installa-
tion stock inventory position is uniform on [RQ +q,RQ +2^,...,7?o +2o]' 
and the retailer installation stock inventory positions are uniform on 
[R^+IR)+2,...,R)+Qj]. 
Consider then the same system with echelon stock (R, Q) policies instead of 
installation stock policies. We then have 
Proposition 10.2 (Echelon stock (R, Q) policies.) In steady state all installa-
tions have their echelon inventory positions uniformly distributed on 
[Rj +l,Rj + 2,...,i?y + Qj ], i.e., also the warehouse. The retailer inventory 
positions are still independent of each other, but the warehouse echelon 
stock inventory position is correlated to the retailer inventory positions. 
The coupling between the warehouse echelon stock inventory position and 
the retailer inventory positions depends on the initial stock at the warehouse. 
See Axsater (1997), and Chen and Zheng (1997). 
Recall that when dealing with batch-ordering policies a standard ap-
proach is to determine the batch quantities from a deterministic model in an 
initial step. This is a major simplification. The remaining main difficulty is 
the policy evaluation. Given a suitable evaluation method we can normally 
optimize the reorder points in the same way as the order-up-to inventory po-
sitions when dealing with-S* policies. See Section 10.4. 
In the following we give an overview of how different researchers have 
approached the policy evaluation problem for distribution systems with gen-
eral batch-ordering policies. To avoid getting involved in too many technical 
details, we shall only sketch the basic ideas behind different approaches. 
10.5.2.2 METRIC type approximations 
As we have already discussed in Section 10.2, several authors have tried to 
generalize the METRIC approach to batch ordering retailers. Recall that the 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
279 
METRIC approach means that we evaluate the average delay for retailer or-
ders due to shortages at the warehouse. This average delay is added to the 
retailer transportation times to get exact average lead-times for the retailers. 
When evaluating the costs at the retailers, these averages are, as an approxi-
mation, used instead of the real stochastic lead-times. 
When dealing with different batch-ordering retailers it is still easy to de-
termine the average backorder level at the warehouse, and to obtain the aver-
age delay at the warehouse by applying Little's formula. This delay, how-
ever, is an average over all retailers. A problem in connection with this ap-
proach is that the average delays may vary substantially between the retail-
ers. Of course the average delays are the same in the special case of identical 
retailers. 
The first METRIC type approach for batch-ordering retailers was by 
Deuermeyer and Schwarz (1981). They first approximate the mean and vari-
ance of the warehouse lead-time demand and fit a normal distribution to 
these parameters. Next they estimate holding costs and the average delay at 
the warehouse. The retailer lead-times are, as in METRIC, obtained as the 
transportation times plus the average delay at the warehouse. Svoronos and 
Zipkin (1988) use a different type of second moment approximation. Except 
for the average warehouse delay, they also derive an approximate estimate of 
the variance of the delay. Using these parameters they then fit a negative bi-
nomial distribution to the retailer lead-time demand. Another related tech-
nique is suggested in Axsater (2002). 
A METRIC type approximation is quite simple. It means essentially that 
a multi-echelon system is decomposed into a number of single-echelon sys-
tems. Although the errors may be substantial in some cases, the approach is 
also often reasonable in practical applications. 
10.5.2.3 Disaggregation of warehouse backorders 
Another possibility is to use the approach in Section 10.3.1. This approach is 
similar to our standard approach for single-echelon systems. For a single-
echelon system we get the inventory level at time / + Z as the inventory po-
sition at time t minus the lead-time demand. When dealing with retailer / in 
the considered two-echelon distribution inventory system, we also need to 
subtract the backorders at the warehouse at time /, which emanates from re-
tailer /. These backorders cannot be delivered before time t + Z/. This means 
that we need to disaggregate the total number of backorders to obtain the 
distribution of the backorders that emanate from a certain retailer. In the case 
of Poisson demand and one-for-one replenishments, a binomial disaggrega-
tion is exact and it is relatively easy to evaluate a policy exactly as shown in 
Section 10.3.1. In the case of batch-ordering retailers, an exact disaggrega-

 
280 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
tion is much more complicated. Chen and Zheng (1997) have still been able 
to derive an exact solution this way for echelon stock (R, Q) policies and 
Poisson demand. Lee and Moinzadeh (1987a,b), and Moinzadeh and Lee 
(1986) approximate the demand process at the warehouse by a Poisson proc-
ess. Using this approximation they determine the distribution of the total 
number of outstanding orders at all retailers. Next the mean and variance of 
the number of outstanding orders at a single retailer are obtained by an ap-
proximate disaggregation procedure. They then use different two-moment 
approximations of the distribution of outstanding orders at the retailer. Ax-
sater (1995) is another related approach. 
10.5.2.4 Following supply units through the system 
A third possible approach is to try to keep track of each supply unit as it 
moves through the system. A batch is then seen as a "package" of individual 
units. This approach is related to the technique for one-for-one ordering 
policies described in Section 10.3.2 and to Axsater (1990). Using this tech-
nique Axsater (2000) derives the exact probability distributions for the in-
ventory levels for a quite general continuous review multi-echelon inventory 
system with batch-ordering retailers facing compound Poisson demand. Re-
lated papers, which also deal with batch-ordering policies, are Axsater 
(1993a,b, 1997, 1998, 2003), Forsberg (1997a,b), and Andersson (1997). See 
also Muharremoglu and Tsitsiklis (2003). 
Marklund (2002, 2005), Cachon (2001), Cachon and Fisher (2000), and 
Axsater and Marklund (2005) use related approaches for evaluating different 
types of policies. The policy considered in Axsater and Marklund (2005) 
will always outperform both installation stock and echelon stock (i?, Q) poli-
cies. 
Using this type of techniques exact policy evaluations are possible as 
long as we deal with relatively small problems characterized by low demand 
and corresponding small batch quantities. For larger problems the computa-
tional effort grows quite rapidly and it is more realistic to rely on approxi-
mate techniques. 
10.5.2.5 Practical considerations 
It is clear that the research concerning evaluation and optimization of distri-
bution inventory systems with stochastic demand has made a lot of progress 
during the past two decades. It is possible to handle a wider range of systems 
exactly, and we have better approximate techniques for systems which can-
not be analyzed exactly. 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
281 
Numerical experimentation with various test problems in many research 
papers has also illustrated what a typical optimal solution looks like. See 
e.g., Muckstadt and Thomas (1980), Axsater (1993b, 2000), Hausman and 
Erkip (1994), Andersson (1997), and Gallego and Zipkin (1999). The opti-
mal solution of a particular problem will, of course, depend on problem pa-
rameters like holding costs, backorder costs (or service constraints), trans-
portation times, and demand processes. Although it is difficult to generalize, 
it is striking that the optimal solutions very often look the same in a certain 
sense. What is typical is that upstream installations should have very low 
stocks compared to downstream installations. Consider, for example, a dis-
tribution inventory system with a central warehouse and about five retailers. 
Let us assume that the retailers are required to provide a fill rate of 95% to-
wards the final customers. The optimal solution may then typically show that 
we should have a negative safety stock at the warehouse, and that the ware-
house fill rate for orders from the retailers should be something like 50%. A 
first important question is how this knowledge can be used for more efficient 
control of practical supply chains. 
In practice it is still most common to handle different stocks in a supply 
chain by single-echelon techniques. As discussed in Section 10.5.2.2, it may 
then be possible to use some simple type of METRIC approximation. 
Quite often practitioners handle upstream and downstream stock points in 
a similar way. This means generally that the distribution of the total stock 
between upstream and downstream installations is far from optimal. One 
way to achieve better control is, of course, to implement exact or approxi-
mate techniques for multi-echelon inventory systems. However, it may be 
difficult to replace an existing simple control system with a relatively ad-
vanced multi-echelon technique. The computational effort will also grow 
considerably. In the short run it may be more realistic to implement the new 
knowledge in the following way: (i) Analyze a small number of representa-
tive items by multi-echelon techniques, and (ii) Adjust the service levels in 
the existing control system so that they roughly correspond to the optimal 
solution. 
10.6 Other assumptions 
10.6.1 Guaranteed service model approach 
We shall now consider a relatively simple approximate approach for setting 
order-up-to inventory positions in a multi-echelon inventory system. The ad-
vantage of the approach is its simplicity, while it is difficult to see how the 

 
282 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
approximations will affect the results. The general approach was first sug-
gested by Kimball in 1955. (This manuscript was later reprinted in Kimball, 
1988.) The most well-known early paper dealing with this topic is Simpson 
(1958), who used the technique for determining safety stocks in a serial in-
ventory system. Various generalizations have been provided by Graves 
(1988), Inderfurth (1991), and Inderfurth and Minner (1998). The presenta-
tion here follows essentially Graves and Willems (2003). 
We assume continuous review. Let 
^j 
= mean demand per unit of time at installationy, 
oj 
= standard deviation of demand per unit of time at installation^, 
*S^- 
= order-up-to inventory position at installation^', 
5^"^ = service time provided by installation 7 to its downstream instal-
lations, 
sj 
= service time for installation/ from upstream installations, 
Lj 
= processing time at installation^, 
kj 
= safety factor for installation^, 
p(J) 
= the set of installations which are immediate predecessors of in-
stallationy, 
Ij 
= on-hand inventory at installation^. 
Consider installation 7. It is assumed that the service times provided by in-
stallations that are immediate predecessors, s^^^ for / e p(j), have been de-
termined. The service time, or delay, for installation 7 from upstream instal-
lations is then 
^7 = maxLr^}. 
(10.48) 
The corresponding lead-time for replenishments is obtained as Lj + sj . The 
average demand during this time is ^j(Lj + 5J^), and the standard deviation 
oj(Lj + sj y^^. A standard procedure for setting the order-up-to inventory 
position so that a delivery from stock (i.e., s^-^^ = 0) is possible with a high 
probability is 
S'j=Mj(Lj+sf) + kjajiLj +sff\ 
(10.49) 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS 
283 
where kj is the so-called safety factor. In case of unbounded demand, we will 
of course, not always be able to deliver immediately from stock, but we shall 
still interpret (10.49) as the order-up-to inventory position that will provide 
sf' = 0. 
Let us now instead assume that we can accept a positive service time to-
wards downstream installations, i.e., some sj^^ > 0. This is equivalent to re-
ducing the lead-time by sj^^ in (10,49). This simple result, which was first 
pointed out by Hariharan and Zipkin (1995), is easy to derive. We obtain the 
corresponding Sj as 
Sj ^/UjiLj^sJ -sf')-^kjGj{Lj +sf -sff^\ 
(10.50) 
In (10.50) we must require that ^^"^ < Lj + sf . 
Given (10.50) we can approximate the expected inventory on hand at in-
stallationy as 
EiIj) = kjaj(Lj+sf -s';"')"^ 
(10.51) 
Using the considered approach in a decentralized setting, each site can 
successively set its service time towards downstream sites and determine the 
corresponding order-up-to inventory position Sj. 
We can also include (10.51) in a safety stock optimization. Assume that 
the service times provided by external suppliers are given. Furthermore, for 
sites facing customer demand there are required service times towards the 
customers. Using (10.48) and (10.51) we can then, for example, minimize 
the total holding costs with respect to the internal service times, Sj^^, pro-
vided by sites not facing demand from external customers. 
10.6.2 Coordination and contracts 
In practice it is common with supply chains, which consist of several inde-
pendent firms. So far in this book we have assumed that all information con-
cerning the supply chain is available and that our purpose is to optimize the 
total supply chain. So we have adopted the perspective of a central planner. 
However, it is obvious that this perspective is not always relevant. A 
company that is part of a supply chain quite often wishes to limit the infor-
mation that is available for other companies. An interesting question is then 

 
284 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
to which extent this Hmits the possibihties for improved control. It is clear 
that extensive information sharing becomes more and more common in sup-
ply chains. An example is the implementation of so-called vendor managed 
inventory (VMI) programs. In such implementations the supplier may have 
access to real-time sales data at its downstream installation. This puts, in a 
sense, the supplier in the position of a central planner. 
Furthermore, a company in a supply chain may be more interested in its 
own objectives than in the objectives of the total supply chain. This may lead 
to additional costs due to sub-optimization. A question here is whether such 
incentive conflicts can be resolved by agreements or contracts that guarantee 
good coordination, while still allowing decentralized planning and control. 
There is a rich and rapidly growing literature on information sharing, co-
ordination, and contracts. We refer to two recent overviews in Cachon 
(2003) and Chen (2003) for more details and additional references. 
We shall in this section illustrate modeling and analysis of contracts by 
considering a simplified version of an example that is discussed in Cachon 
(2003). 
10.6.2.1 The newsboy problem with two firms 
We return to the newsboy problem that we dealt with in Section 5.13. How-
ever, we now assume that the distribution is handled by two independent 
firms, a supplier and a retailer. The two firms want to maximize their own 
profits. 
The supplier has a certain given production cost per unit. The retailer or-
ders from the supplier and faces a newsboy problem. There is a single season 
and the demand is normally distributed. (Other distributions can be handled 
in the same way.) There is a certain given market price per unit. The retailer 
is not paid anything for unsold units. Let us introduce the following notation: 
c = given production cost per unit for the supplier, 
p = given market price per unit, 
S = amount ordered by the retailer, 
// = mean of stochastic demand, 
a = standard deviation of stochastic demand, 
q = expected sales. 
It is evident that we must assume that/? > c. Otherwise no business will take 
place.

285 
10.6.2.2 Wholesale-price contract 
Let us first consider a so-called wholesale-price contract. This means that the 
supplier decides on a price per unit that the retailer has to pay. Let us intro-
duce the following additional notation. 
w = price per unit charged by the supplier and paid by the retailer, 
Tis = expected profit for the supplier, 
Kr = expected profit for the retailer, 
n = expected total profit. 
Consider first the retailer profit: 
S
i 
_ 
CO 1 
TTj. ^ p{ \ xâ(p{ 
â)dx + S\â (p{ 
â)dx) - Sw

(p(^^-^^)dx) -SW = P(M- 
OG(^^^)) 
- Sw, 
(10.52) 
s 
- 
- 
^ 
where 
q = ju-oG(^-^), 
(10.53) 
is the expected sales. The expected profit for the supplier is simply 
7r,=S(w-c), 
(10.54) 
and the expected total profit is 
n= 7r,+7r,= p(ju - GG{^^^)) 
- Sc. 
(10.55) 
a 
Note that we can assume c<w<p.lfc>w 
there is no supplier profit, and if 
w>p it is optimal for the retailer to choose S=0. 
Let us now first consider the total profit. The problem to maximize the 
total profit is equivalent to the original newsboy problem in Section 5.13. 
Note that 17= (p - c)ju - C, where C is the cost in (5.89) with Co = c and c^ = 

 
286 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
p- c. So, profit maximization with respect to S is equivalent to cost minimi-
zation. 
The optimal S is obtained from 
cD(^^Zii)^Z^. 
(10.56) 
cr 
p 
This condition is easy to derive from (10.55) and equivalent to (5.91). The 
optimal S is denoted S'{c), 
Consider then the expected retailer profit. The structure of (10.52) is 
completely equivalent to (10.55) so we obtain the minimizing S (w) from 
^{^-^)=P^, 
(10.57) 
a 
p 
It is easy to see that S*{w) < S*{c) because w > c. The considered contract 
will therefore fail in the sense that it will not lead to a maximization of the 
total profit. 
Assuming that the retailer uses S (w), the supplier can maximize her 
profit by maximizing 
;r^ =(w-c)S\w). 
(10.58) 
10.6.2.3 Buyback contract 
Let us now consider a different type of contract. The supplier still charges 
the retailer a certain price per unit purchased. However, he also pays the re-
tailer a certain amount per unit of leftover inventory. Let 
Wb = price per unit charged by the supplier and paid by the retailer, 
b = compensation per unit for leftover inventory, 
71^ = expected profit for the supplier, 
TT^ = expected profit for the retailer, 
U = expected total profit. 
It is obvious that we should require b < w^. Otherwise, the retailer earns 
profit from leftover inventory. We shall choose the parameters b and Wb as 

 
MULTI-ECHELON - REORDER POINTS

^ 
. 
(10.59) 
w^ == (1 - X)p + Ac, 
where 0 < 2 < 1. We get 
n^ =pq-Swi^ +b{S-q) = Xpq-XSc = m , 
(10.60) 
and 
^^ ^S{w^~c)-b{S-q)^{\-X)pq-{l-X)Sc 
= {\-X)n. 
(10.61) 
We can conclude that the considered contract coordinates the supply 
chain in the sense that both the supplier and the retailer wish to maximize the 
total profit. For both firms it is rational to use S*{c) obtained from (10.56). 
We can interpret /I as the retailer's share of the total supply chain's profit. It 
is reasonable for both firms to accept the cost structure (10.59) and only ne-
gotiate about the value of/I.

11 IMPLEMENTATION 
In Chapters 2 - 10 we have described different methods for forecasting and 
inventory control. An inventory control system is usually based on a suitable 
selection of these methods. However, efficient algorithms cannot guarantee 
successful control. It is also necessary to create a good environment for 
practical application of the methods. This means, for example, correct in-
ventory records and sound objectives for the control. Section 11.1 deals with 
various prerequisites for implementation of inventory control. In order to 
succeed, it is also necessary to understand how different control parameters 
like holding costs and service levels can be used for adjusting the control 
system. The implementation process, as well as adjustments of the control 
system, should be planned carefully and it is very important to monitor the 
results closely. We discuss issues concerning implementation and adjust-
ments in Section 11.2. 
11.1 Preconditions for inventory control 
Due to the development of modem information technology, an inventory 
control system is today usually computerized. There still exist, though, envi-
ronments where it is more suitable to use simple manual systems. One ex-
ample can be an inventory control system for items of low value such as of-
fice supphes or bolts. It can also be reasonable to use a manual control sys-
tem when dealing with very few items. When discussing various practical 
aspects of inventory control, we shall, however, primarily think of a comput-
erized system with many items. 

 
296 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
11.1.1 Inventory records 
To be able to use an inventory control model it is first of all necessary to 
have the required data available. This includes stock on hand, stock on order, 
backorders, various costs, lead-times, etc. If these data contain errors, the in-
ventory control system will not be able to trigger orders as intended. When 
implementing an inventory control system it is therefore vital to have good 
procedures for keeping the inventory records accurate. 
In general, it is especially difficult to keep track of the inventory position 
due to frequent receipts and deliveries of material. All such transactions are 
possible sources of errors. When an error has occurred, it can often affect the 
inventory control for a long time. There are two ways to overcome such 
problems. The first way is to improve the procedures for updating the re-
cords in connection with various transactions. In that way we can avoid 
having errors occur. The second way is to develop a good system for audit-
ing and correcting inventory records. 
11.1.1.1 Updating inventory records 
To keep the records accurate it is, of course, necessary to have correct pro-
cedures for updating the records in connection with different transactions. 
However, this is usually not the main problem. Instead the difficulty often 
lies in making sure that the procedures are followed. The most common 
source of error is, without any doubt, that transactions take place without 
being recorded properly. 
The behavior of the personnel involved is obviously very important. First 
of all, the stockroom supervisors must take full responsibility for maintain-
ing record accuracy. All personnel must be instructed and trained in stock-
room operating procedures. The training should also provide motivation for 
keeping the records accurate. It is important to set accuracy goals and to 
measure the fulfillment of these goals. Errors that occur should be traced and 
analyzed. It is usually efficient to limit and control access to the storeroom. 
This can prevent most undocumented transactions. 
Various types of automatic identification systems may reduce the errors 
considerably. The less you rely on human intervention to input information 
the more accurate your records will be. Automatic identification will also re-
duce the time needed for updating records. A major tool is bar coding, which 
is an optical method that relies on light being reflected off of a printed pat-
tern. In connection with inventory control it is most common with one di-
mensional, linear bar coding. A system includes the bar code itself, a reading 
device (scanner), and a printer. Bar coding is not the only automated tech-

 
IMPLEMENTATION 
297 
nique of identifying inventory. There is also, for example, optical character 
reading, machine vision, magnetic stripe, and radio frequency tags. 
All parts should be identified by number and location in the storeroom. A 
well-ordered storage room will reduce problems involving lost and mis-
placed items. 
It is easier to keep the records accurate if the items h^YC fixed locations. 
This means that each item has a home and that nothing else can live there. 
On the other hand, such a system can lead to inefficient space utilization. 
This is because you need to allocate space for each item corresponding to the 
largest quantity of the item that may be in the facility at one time. With ran-
dom location the same item can be stored in more than one location. How-
ever, it is then necessary to accurately note the location in a computer data-
base. Although space can be used very efficiently when using a random lo-
cator system, it is obvious that such a system will further increase the need 
for good operating procedures. In practice it is very common to use 
combination systems, where some items are given specific locations, while 
most items are randomly located. 
For items where the stock always consists of an integral number of units, 
it should, in principle, be possible to eliminate nearly all sources of errors. 
This can be more difficult for items which can have a continuous stock level 
that is obtained, for example, by weighing. Each transaction may then cause 
a small error in the stock level due to measurement errors. 
Another type of problem occurs, when we have, for example, a stock of 
tubes of a certain dimension. The tubes in stock may have different lengths. 
Furthermore, it may be the case that short tubes cannot cover certain types of 
demands. Therefore, in situations with many short tubes in stock, the inven-
tory on hand may appear to be much larger than it really is. 
For certain types of items, thefts may be a major problem. Apart from the 
loss in value, thefts will also lead to inaccurate inventory records. Thefts can 
be another strong reason for limiting access to the storeroom. 
11,1.1.2 Auditing and correcting inventory records 
All inventory balances must also be checked by counting. The counting fre-
quency should, in general, be higher for items with high demand. For such 
items the transactions are more frequent, and it is usually also more impor-
tant to have accurate balances. 
Traditionally it has been most common to use periodic counting, for ex-
ample to take an annual physical inventory. This usually means a complete 
count of more or less all items over a short time period. It is common that the 
stock of each item is counted twice by different persons. 

 
298 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
It has become more and more common, though, to replace the periodic 
counting by cycle counting. Each day a Hmited number of items are checked. 
This method means a continuous counting of stock throughout the year. As a 
consequence, personnel can be assigned to counting on a full-time basis 
which permits the use of specialists. It is practical to let the inventory control 
system trigger counts at suitable times. It is, of course, easier to check the 
stock level when it is low. Therefore it may be suitable to count the items 
just before a replenishment is received. The stock level is then, on average, 
equal to the safety stock. It is also common to perform a count when the bal-
ance on hand becomes zero or negative, or after a certain number of transac-
tions. 
The inventory records are not always updated exactly when the physical 
movements take place. The resulting differences in records must be taken 
into account. Therefore it is often practical to count when there is no move-
ment of paper or product, for example, at end of business day, prior to start 
of day, or over the weekend. 
Initially, or when having problems with inventory records, it may be a 
good idea to count a control group of items very often. Let, for example, the 
control group consist of 100 items that constitute a good cross-section of the 
total population of items, and let the cycle for each item be 10 days. By fol-
lowing the control group in detail you will usually be able to identify major 
errors that may occur. This will, in turn, enable adjustments of the proce-
dures that will correct these errors. 
11.1.2 Performance evaluation 
The purpose of an inventory control system is, in general, to reduce holding 
and ordering costs while still maintaining satisfactory customer service. To 
achieve this it is necessary to be able to continuously evaluate the perform-
ance of the system. A performance evaluation is needed both for creating 
motivation for efficient application of the system and for being able to adjust 
the control when various changes in the operating conditions occur. 
A good system for performance evaluation should satisfy several impor-
tant requirements. First of all it is necessary to measure costs and service in a 
well-defined way so that measurements at different times can be compared. 
Some performance measures are not always easy to define suitably. Cus-
tomer service, for example, can be evaluated in many ways. It is, of course, a 
clear advantage if the measured service is defined in the same way as the 
service level used when determining the reorder levels in the inventory con-
trol system. It is then much easier to check that the control system works as 
intended. 

 
IMPLEMENTATION 
299 
Except for the customer service, it is in general necessary to monitor the 
capital tied up in inventories and the ordering costs. It is also common to 
evaluate other performance measures like inventory turnover. Usually it is 
not very difficult to determine suitable performance measures. It is more dif-
ficult to determine the level of aggregation for the measurements. There are 
often many thousands of items. It is therefore not practical to follow individ-
ual items separately. Neither is it appropriate to aggregate all items. It should 
be possible to use the evaluation system as a tool for identifying various 
problems that may exist. For example, we want to know whether the control 
is inadequate for certain types of items, and we would also like to identify 
major savings that can be achieved by improved control. 
To obtain a reasonable overview it is necessary to aggregate and consider 
suitable groups of items instead of individual items. It is normally advanta-
geous if the items in such a group are related and if the inventory control is 
similar. See also Section 11.2.2. The performance evaluation should initially 
be carried out for relatively large groups of items which are then, if required, 
divided into smaller groups. Even with a well-designed system for perform-
ance evaluation, it may sometimes be quite difficult to evaluate the effi-
ciency of the inventory control system. The measurements are often affected 
by various changes in the operating environment. Such changes can be due 
to new suppliers, major changes in the demands for different items, business 
cycles, etc. It is important to be aware of possible measurement errors and 
take them into account when interpreting the results of the evaluation. Even 
more difficult is to compare various performance measures across different 
companies. Two companies may, at a first glance, seem to have very similar 
conditions for inventory control. However, when looking at the conditions in 
more detail, it often turns out that it is very difficult to compare performance 
measures like inventory turnover. 
11-2 Development and adjustments 
An industrial computerized inventory system generally contains much more 
than the inventory control, e.g., customer billing and supplier payments. The 
total system is often more an information system than a control system, and 
the inventory control module is only a minor part of the entire system. An 
example is an inventory control module in a modem ERP system. (See Sec-
tion 8.2.4.) Furthermore, it is not uncommon that major parts of the inven-
tory system already exist when starting to develop or install a module for in-
ventory control. In such situations the development and installation costs can 
be surprisingly low. 

 
300 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
11.2.1 Determine the needs 
Developing and implementing inventory control is a customizing operation. 
The requirements can vary substantially between different companies and 
between different types of items within a company. Sometimes it can, at 
least initially, be reasonable to leave items with very special requirements 
outside the system. 
At this stage it is recommended to question more or less everything. The 
very first question is what items that should be kept in stock at all. Maybe it 
is advantageous to deliver some items only after receiving customer orders. 
Nearly everything can be changed. For example, investments in production 
can reduce the setup times. This means that smaller batch quantities are fea-
sible and it may also be possible to use a simpler replenishment system. The 
evaluation of such investments has been considered by e.g., Porteus (1985, 
1986a, 1986b), Spence and Porteus (1987), and Silver (1992). 
Furthermore, better information can sometimes reduce the service needs. 
If the inventory system can provide customers with precise information con-
cerning the lengths of various delays, this can enable the customers to revise 
their plans in such a way that the additional costs in connection with delays 
are relatively low. This will consequently reduce the need for a high service 
level and thereby make it possible to obtain lower carrying costs. 
When designing an inventory control system it is also necessary to de-
termine which control methods should be used for different groups of items. 
A first important question is whether we are dealing with a single installation 
and items that can be controlled independently of each other. If this is the 
case, at least approximately, it is possible to use the methods which we have 
considered in Chapters 4-6, and it is, in general, relatively easy to obtain ef-
ficient inventory control. 
If the operating conditions are more complex so that we need to use 
methods from Chapters 7-10, the implementation of inventory control will 
become substantially more difficult. First of all the information system must 
be able to coordinate data for different items or installations. Normally this 
means additional costs. Furthermore, the control system will be considerably 
more complex. Obviously, it is always necessary to compare the additional 
costs for a better control system to the possible advantages of improved in-
ventory control. 
When designing an inventory control system it is also important to evalu-
ate potential savings for different types of items. If possible the implementa-
tion should be planned so that large savings are obtained as early as possible. 

 
IMPLEMENTATION 
301 
11.2.2 Selective inventory control 
In principle each individual item can be controlled in a unique way. But 
since there are, in general, several thousands of items, this is not a practical 
solution. It is much easier to divide the items into a number of groups and 
use the same forecasting and inventory control techniques for all items in the 
same group. See also Section 6.3. We have already discussed grouping of 
items in connection with performance evaluation (Section 11.1.2). It is a 
clear advantage if the same groups can be used both when selecting control 
techniques and when evaluating the performance. 
A grouping of the items can be done in many different ways and must 
depend on the needs of the organization. It should, in general, be affected 
both by marketing and production factors. 
A type of grouping that is common in many companies is so-called ABC 
inventory analysis. This means a grouping by dollar volume. Usually a rela-
tively small percentage of the items accounts for a large share of the total 
volume. Typically 20 percent of the items can account for about 80 percent 
of the dollar volume. This means, of course, that the remaining 80 percent of 
the items only account for 20 percent of the volume. Items with a high vol-
ume are often more important, and it is therefore reasonable to expect that 
such items should require a more precise control and performance evalua-
tion. Consequently, many companies initially group their items in three 
classes. A, B, and C. The A class consists of items with very high dollar vol-
ume. Typically the A class contains 10 percent of the items. Likewise about 
30 percent of the items with intermediate dollar volumes can be classified as 
class B items, and finally the remaining 60 percent of the items with low 
dollar volumes are referred to as the C class items. 
Especially if the inventory control is expensive, e.g., if the control system 
contains manual elements, it is important to concentrate the control efforts 
on the A items. In a completely computerized system it does not, in general, 
require much additional effort to include more or less all items once the sys-
tem has been implemented. It is always very important, however, to monitor 
the performance of the A items closely. 
When dealing with a single installation and independent items, it can 
sometimes be reasonable to initially use an ABC classification and let the 
control techniques be the same for all items in the same class. In general, 
though, there will successively emerge needs for dividing these initial groups 
into smaller subgroups. When using the more complicated methods in Chap-
ters 7 - 10, a grouping of the items must normally also depend on couplings 
between items and facilities.

INVENTORY CONTROL 
11.2.3 Model and reality 
In this book we have presented different models and corresponding methods 
which can be used for forecasting demand and controlHng inventories. There 
are also many other models available in the inventory literature. Although 
there are many models to choose from, it is still nearly always very difficult 
or impossible to find a model that completely describes a certain real-life 
situation. Most real settings are indeed very complicated. Furthermore, in 
order to be a useful tool, a model should be reasonably simple. In most 
situations we are forced to accept that our model is a rather rough approxi-
mation of the real system. When working with inventory control it is very 
important to remember this when dealing, for example, with methods for lot 
sizing and determination of safety stocks. 
The relationship between model and reality is illustrated in Figure 11.1.

The control methods used are based on an approximate description of the 
real system, the inventory model. This means, in other words, that the meth-
ods take some aspects of reality into account but ignore others. The resulting 
control will not always be as intended. Quite often it is therefore necessary 
to adjust cost parameters and service constraints in order to compensate for 
the incomplete model description. To understand how this can be done, and 
be able to use an inventory control system efficiently, it is very important to 
understand the underlying basic assumptions of different models. It is usu-
ally very fruitful to think over carefully how these basic assumptions differ 
from the real inventory system. For example, what can the consequences be 
if the real demand distribution differs substantially from that in the model? 

 
IMPLEMENTATION 
303 
On the other hand, it is not necessary for successful application of a cer-
tain control method to be able to follow the mathematical analysis that is 
used when deriving the control method from the inventory model. 
Because a model is an approximate description of reality, we cannot just 
choose cost parameters (Section 3.1) corresponding to what we think are the 
real cost factors and hope to get an adequate balance between different types 
of costs. To obtain efficient control it is normally necessary to monitor dif-
ferent performance measures carefully (Section 11.1.2) and adjust the con-
trol parameters with respect to the actual outcome. 
Assume, for example, that in the performance evaluation we find that the 
capital tied up in stock is higher that what was expected. If we want to re-
duce the carrying costs, there are several possibilities. We can use smaller 
batch quantities and/or smaller safety stocks. One way to obtain this is to in-
crease the carrying charge when determining holding costs. This will reduce 
the batch quantities and also the safety stocks if the holding costs are bal-
anced against certain backorder costs. The safety stocks, however, are not af-
fected in case of given service levels. A lower service level will, of course, 
always reduce the safety stocks. Since the model is approximate, the cost pa-
rameters of an inventory model do not need to correspond to real cost fac-
tors. The cost parameters of an inventory model should instead be regarded 
as control parameters that can be adjusted to obtain a satisfactory overall 
control as measured in the performance evaluation. Parameter adjustments 
should, however, as we shall discuss in Section 11.2.6, be carried out slowly 
while continuously monitoring the outcome. 
11.2.4 Step-by-step implementation 
An inventory control system can be more or less automatic. At least in prin-
ciple, the system can generate complete purchasing and production orders 
without any manual interaction. It is possible, however, that this is too dan-
gerous because of possible errors. Especially in the implementation phase 
and when adjusting the control, it is rational to be extremely careful. 
An implementation as well as adjustments of the control system should 
be carried out successively under thorough supervision. Two main rules can 
be recommended: 
â¢ 
Introduce changes step-by-step 
As we have discussed earlier, the same control techniques are usually 
used for a group of items. The economic outcome is also, in general, moni-
tored for each group separately. When implementing the control system it is 

 
304 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
recommendable to take one group at a time and continue the implementation 
with other groups first when feehng confident concerning already imple-
mented parts of the system. 
â¢ 
Use the new and the old system in parallel 
In an initial phase it is reasonable to compare a new or revised inventory 
control system to the previous decision rules. This makes it easier to dis-
cover and correct various errors and shortcomings of a new system. 
An inventory control system should be continuously adjusted to changing 
operating conditions. In practice it is not uncommon that the personnel using 
the system discover that orders for some items are triggered in a less suitable 
way. In such a situation it is far too common that the orders are changed 
manually without adjusting the system itself This means, of course, that 
such changes must be carried out also in the future, and the benefits of the 
control system are reduced substantially. Nearly always in such situations it 
is possible to adjust cost parameters or make minor changes in the method-
ology so that the control system will work adequately. It is therefore impor-
tant to document all errors and other problems initially. 
11.2.5 Simulation 
Sometimes it can be difficult to choose suitable inventory control methods, 
and also to find appropriate values of the various control parameters that af-
fect system control. One problem in this context is that it is normally not fea-
sible to evaluate a control policy by practical application, since such an 
evaluation would take considerable time. For example, if the service level is 
adjusted for a group of items, it can take several months before the conse-
quences can be clearly observed. If the change turns out to have mainly 
negative consequences the experiment can be quite expensive. 
One way to evaluate different control methods in advance is to use simu-
lation. When using simulation we are also, like in Figure 11.1, replacing the 
real system by a mathematical model. Simulation experiments with the 
model which can be carried out very quickly are then used for analyzing the 
system. Using simulation, it is in general, possible to evaluate the develop-
ment during several years in a few seconds, and it is easy to make various 
test runs with different inventory control techniques. 
Technically it is quite easy to simulate an inventory system. It is possible 
to use special simulation software, or to develop a model using a standard 
programming language. A simulation model is, however, in principle associ-

 
IMPLEMENTATION 
305 
ated with the same limitations as all other mathematical models and can 
never give a complete illustration of the real system. Note especially that if a 
simulation model is based on the same assumptions as a certain inventory 
model which can be evaluated exactly, the results of the simulation will, of 
course, be exactly the same and will therefore not give any additional in-
sight. Simulations can give valuable additional information, though, if the 
simulation model illustrates the real system better in some way. Assume, for 
example, that the determination of safety stocks in an inventory control sys-
tem is based on the assumption of a certain demand distribution, and that it 
has not been possible to analyze in detail how well this type of demand cor-
responds to the real demand distribution. A simulation model based on real 
historical demand data can then be used for analyzing whether the demand 
distribution used is reasonable. 
11.2.6 Short-run consequences of adjustments 
Adjustments of the inventory control have consequences both in the short 
run and in the long run. The objective when making adjustments is usually to 
obtain good control in the long run. Furthermore, it is normally only the 
long-run steady state situation that is reflected in different inventory models. 
Quite often, though, it is important to consider also the short-run, transient 
behavior of an inventory system. 
To illustrate the development in the short run we shall discuss the conse-
quences when changing reorder points and batch quantities. When increasing 
the reorder points, due to, for example, longer lead-times or higher safety 
stocks, this will result in a lot of new orders since many items will reach 
their reorder points directly or relatively soon. If the increase of the reorder 
points corresponds to, for example, one week's demand, the additional or-
ders in the short run will also correspond to about one week's demand. The 
consequences are similar but in the other direction when reducing the reorder 
points. When reducing the reorder points the change in the flow of orders is 
slower, though, since it cannot be seen until the items successively reach 
their original reorder points. (See also Section 8.2.5.) An increase of the 
batch quantities will, of course, mean larger orders when the items reach 
their reorder points and will consequently increase the total flow of orders in 
the short run. From this discussion we can formulate two important conclu-
sions: 
â¢ 
Changes in the inventory control will nearly always first result in a 
higher total stock. When changing the control, some reorder points are 
increased while others are reduced. Because the effects of the increased 

 
306 
INVENTORY CONTROL 
reorder points can be observed earlier, the total stock will increase in the 
short run. 
â¢ 
In the short run, adjustments of the control can cause major changes in 
the flow of orders. This can, for example, result in a production load that 
is far too high. It is therefore important to adjust the control continuously 
and under careful supervision. 
When adjusting the inventory control system it is important to be aware 
of the short-run effects and understand that it can take a relatively long time 
until the system reaches steady state. It is not uncommon that changes in the 
inventory control, due to insufficient understanding of these effects, can cre-
ate a situation that is completely opposite of what was intended. An example 
is when increasing the system lead-times due to a temporary overload in 
production. Although it may be correct that the real lead-times have in-
creased because of the overload, increased system lead-times will mean 
higher reorder points and a short-run increase in the triggered orders. This 
will obviously just increase the overload. 
11.2.7 Education 
Successful inventory control requires both knowledge and motivation. The 
importance of education cannot be overemphasized. First of all it is, of 
course, very important that the inventory control methods implemented are 
based on adequate inventory models. It is surprisingly common that ineffi-
cient techniques are implemented by people who do not know the inventory 
control area sufficiently well. However, the need for education concerns not 
only an initial implementation phase. Too often an inventory control system 
deteriorates when a key person leaves the company and the person taking 
over does not have adequate training. The inventory control system will then 
no longer be adjusted properly to fit a changing operating environment. 
Poor training in connection with inventory control can sometimes ema-
nate from the misunderstanding that the control system completely replaces 
manual decisions. An inventory control system should instead be seen as a 
tool that can be applied more or less professionally. How the tool is used is 
often even more important than the design of the tool. To gain the advan-
tages of a more advanced tool, the user needs a better education. 
The most important part of the education concerns inventory models. It is 
necessary to understand the basic assumptions in the models used and how 
system control is affected by different parameters. Education programs fre-
quently focus too much on the information system aspects and do not give 

 
IMPLEMENTATION 
307 
sufficient insight concerning the stock control. Good training is needed not 
only for being able to adjust system control but also for obtaining satisfac-
tory motivation. When clearly understanding how the control system works, 
it is both challenging and stimulating to work for improved system control. 
When implementing a new system, a broad education program for all in-
volved personnel is recommended. The persons who have the main respon-
sibility for the inventory control need continuous training. They should be 
active in professional societies, attend conferences, and read journals in the 
field.

a) Applying (7.12) and (7.13) we obtain Ti=21.031, 72=39.528, 73=43.759, 
and the costs Q = 59.178, Cj = 25.298, Q = 45.705. The sum of these 
costs C = 130.182 is a lower bound for the total costs. 
b) Assume that the independent solution is feasible and that we start produc-
tion of product 3 at times t\ r+ 43.759, f+ 2-43.759 ... etc. Assume that 
the first production of product 2 after time f starts at time f+zli. Clearly 
zli > 03 = 15.003. But the next time the time difference 
is A2 = Ai -^ Tj -
Ts = Ai - 4.231. The time after that it is A3 = A2 - 4.231, etc. After some 
time we will obtain for some n, 0 < A^ < cr^ which means that the solution 
is infeasible. 
c) Applying (7.17)-(7.19) we obtain Tmtn = 7.292, and f = 34.462 , i.e., Topt 
= T- 34.462 . The resulting total costs per unit of time are C =133.481. 
d) Starting with W= 27.037 we obtain Â«i = 1, ^2 "^ '^s "^ 2. Next we get the 
final solution W= 23.611 with the same multipliers and the total costs C 
= 131.259. The solution is feasible if we produce items 2 and 3 in diffe-
rent basic periods. In basic periods where product 1 and 2 are produced, 
the time required is crj + 02 = 6.168 + 9.697 = 15.865 < 23.617. In basic 
periods where product 1 and 3 are produced, the time required is a\ + 03 
= 6.168 + 16.115 = 22.283 < 23.617.

Product I and II are produced in each basic period, III in every second 
basic period. Feasible schedule. In a basic period with production of all

a) Change first to the equivalent Rj =2 such that 7/3^ ~ ^2 ^^ ^ multiple of

A lower bound for the costs is ^2A^de^ + 724^^2 Â« 144.72 . Without 
any lack of generality we can assume that 20V5 /v2 < q < 20^l5 -^2 . 
This means that Q\ = q. Furthermore, we should choose Qi = 2q for
