PREFACE
This book began in 2005 in a basement at Columbia University. At the time,
I was a graduate student, and I was running an online experiment that would
eventually become my dissertation. I’ll tell you all about the scientific parts of
that experiment in chapter 4, but now I’m going to tell you about something
that’s not in my dissertation or in any of my papers. And it’s something that
fundamentally changed how I think about research. One morning, when I
came into my basement office, I discovered that overnight about 100 people
from Brazil had participated in my experiment. This simple experience had
a profound effect on me. At that time, I had friends who were running
traditional lab experiments, and I knew how hard they had to work to recruit,
supervise, and pay people to participate in these experiments; if they could
run 10 people in a single day, that was good progress. However, with my
online experiment, 100 people participated while I was sleeping. Doing your
research while you are sleeping might sound too good to be true, but it isn’t.
Changes in technology—specifically the transition from the analog age to the
digital age—mean that we can now collect and analyze social data in new
ways. This book is about doing social research in these new ways.
This book is for social scientists who want to do more data science, data
scientists who want to do more social science, and anyone interested in the
hybrid of these two fields. Given who this book is for, it should go without
saying that it is not just for students and professors. Although I currently
work at a university (Princeton), I’ve also worked in government (at the US
Census Bureau) and in the tech industry (at Microsoft Research), so I know
that there is a lot of exciting research happening outside of universities. So if
you think of what you are doing as social research, then this book is for you,
no matter where you work or what kind of techniques you currently use.
As you might have noticed already, the tone of this book is a bit different
from that of many other academic books. That’s intentional. This book
emerged from a graduate seminar on computational social science that I
have taught at Princeton in the Department of Sociology since 2007, and
xv

I’d like it to capture some of the energy and excitement from that seminar.
In particular, I want this book to have three characteristics: I want it to be
helpful, future-oriented, and optimistic.
Helpful: My goal is to write a book that is helpful for you. Therefore, I’m
going to write in an open, informal, and example-driven style. That’s because
the most important thing that I want to convey is a certain way of thinking
about social research. And my experience suggests that the best way to convey
this way of thinking is informally and with lots of examples. Also, at the end
of each chapter, I have a section called “What to read next” that will help you
transition into more detailed and technical readings on many of the topics
that I introduce. In the end, I hope this book will help you both do research
and evaluate the research of others.
Future-oriented: I hope that this book will help you to do social research
using the digital systems that exist today and those that will be created in the
future. I started doing this kind of research in 2004, and since then I’ve seen
many changes, and I’m sure that over the course of your career you will see
many changes too. The trick to staying relevant in the face of change is ab-
straction. For example, this is not going to be a book that teaches you exactly
how to use the Twitter API as it exists today; instead, it is going to teach you
how to learn from big data sources (chapter 2). This is not going to be a book
that gives you step-by-step instructions for running experiments on Amazon
Mechanical Turk; instead, it is going to teach you how to design and interpret
experiments that rely on digital age infrastructure (chapter 4). Through the
use of abstraction, I hope this will be a timeless book on a timely topic.
Optimistic: The two communities that this book engages—social scientists
and data scientists—have very different backgrounds and interests. In addi-
tion to these science-related differences, which I talk about in the book, I’ve
also noticed that these two communities have different styles. Data scientists
are generally excited; they tend to see the glass as half full. Social scientists, on
the other hand, are generally more critical; they tend to see the glass as half
empty. In this book, I’m going to adopt the optimistic tone of a data scientist.
So, when I present examples, I’m going to tell you what I love about these
examples. And when I do point out problems with the examples—and I will
do that because no research is perfect—I’m going to try to point out these
problems in a way that is positive and optimistic. I’m not going to be critical
for the sake of being critical—I’m going to be critical so that I can help you
create better research.

PREFACE

We are still in the early days of social research in the digital age, but
I’ve seen some misunderstandings that are so common that it makes sense
for me to address them here, in the preface. From data scientists, I’ve
seen two common misunderstandings. The first is thinking that more data
automatically solves problems. However, for social research, that has not
been my experience. In fact, for social research, better data—as opposed to
more data—seems to be more helpful. The second misunderstanding that
I’ve seen from data scientists is thinking that social science is just a bunch of
fancy talk wrapped around common sense. Of course, as a social scientist—
more specifically as a sociologist—I don’t agree with that. Smart people have
been working hard to understand human behavior for a long time, and it
seems unwise to ignore the wisdom that has accumulated from this effort.
My hope is that this book will offer you some of that wisdom in a way that is
easy to understand.
From social scientists, I’ve also seen two common misunderstandings.
First, I’ve seen some people write off the entire idea of social research using
the tools of the digital age because of a few bad papers. If you’re reading
this book, you’ve probably already read a bunch of papers that use social
media data in ways that are banal or wrong (or both). I have too. However,
it would be a serious mistake to conclude from these examples that all
digital-age social research is bad. In fact, you’ve probably also read a bunch
of papers that use survey data in ways that are banal or wrong, but you
don’t write off all research using surveys. That’s because you know that
there is great research done with survey data, and in this book I’m going
to show you that there is also great research done with the tools of the
digital age.
The second common misunderstanding that I’ve seen from social scien-
tists is to confuse the present with the future. When we assess social research
in the digital age—the research that I’m going to describe—it’s important
that we ask two distinct questions: “How well does this style of research work
right now?” and “How well will this style of research work in the future?”
Researchers are trained to answer the first question, but for this book I
think the second question is more important. That is, even though social
research in the digital age has not yet produced massive, paradigm-changing
intellectual contributions, the rate of improvement in digital-age research is
incredibly rapid. It is this rate of change—more than the current level—that
makes digital-age research so exciting to me.
PREFACE
xvii

Even though that last paragraph might seem to offer you potential riches
at some unspecified time in the future, my goal is not to sell you on any
particular type of research. I don’t personally own shares in Twitter, Face-
book, Google, Microsoft, Apple, or any other tech company (although, for
the sake of full disclosure, I should mention I that have worked at, or received
research funding from, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook). Throughout the
book, therefore, my goal is to remain a credible narrator, telling you about
all the exciting new stuff that is possible, while guiding you away from a few
traps that I’ve seen others fall into (and occasionally fallen into myself).
The intersection of social science and data science is sometimes called
computational social science. Some consider this to be a technical field, but
this will not be a technical book in the traditional sense. For example, there
are no equations in the main text. I chose to write the book this way because
I wanted to provide a comprehensive view of social research in the digital
age, including big data sources, surveys, experiments, mass collaboration,
and ethics. It turned out to be impossible to cover all these topics and provide
technical details about each one. Instead, pointers to more technical material
are given in the “What to read next” section at the end of each chapter. In
other words, this book is not designed to teach you how to do any specific
calculation; rather, it is designed to change the way that you think about
social research.
How to use this book in a course
As I said earlier, this book emerged in part from a graduate seminar on
computational social science that I’ve been teaching since 2007 at Princeton.
Since you might be thinking about using this book to teach a course, I
thought that it might be helpful for me to explain how it grew out of my
course and how I imagine it being used in other courses.
For several years, I taught my course without a book; I’d just assign a
collection of articles. While students were able to learn from these articles, the
articles alone were not leading to the conceptual changes that I was hoping
to create. So I would spend most of the time in class providing perspective,
context, and advice in order to help the students see the big picture. This
book is my attempt to write down all that perspective, context, and advice
in a way that has no prerequisites—in terms of either social science or data
science.
xviii
PREFACE

In a semester-long course, I would recommend pairing this book with
a variety of additional readings. For example, such a course might spend
two weeks on experiments, and you could pair chapter 4 with readings
on topics such as the role of pre-treatment information in the design and
analysis of experiments; statistical and computational issues raised by large-
scale A/B tests at companies; design of experiments specifically focused on
mechanisms; and practical, scientific, and ethical issues related to using
participants from online labor markets, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. It
could also be paired with readings and activities related to programming. The
appropriate choice between these many pairings depends on the students in
your course (e.g., undergraduate, master’s, or PhD), their backgrounds, and
their goals.
A semester-length course could also include weekly problem sets. Each
chapter has a variety of activities that are labeled by degree of difficulty:
easy (
), medium (
), hard (
), and very hard (
). Also, I’ve
labeled each problem by the skills that it requires: math (
), coding (
), and
data collection (
). Finally, I’ve labeled a few of the activities that are my
personal favorites (
). I hope that within this diverse collection of activities,
you’ll find some that are appropriate for your students.
In order to help people using this book in courses, I’ve started a collection
of teaching materials such as syllabuses, slides, recommended pairings for
each chapter, and solutions to some activities. You can find these materials—
and contribute to them—at http://www.bitbybitbook.com.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1
An ink blot
In the summer of 2009, mobile phones were ringing all across Rwanda. In
addition to the millions of calls from family, friends, and business associates,
about 1,000 Rwandans received a call from Joshua Blumenstock and his col-
leagues. These researchers were studying wealth and poverty by conducting a
survey of a random sample of people from a database of 1.5 million customers
of Rwanda’s largest mobile phone provider. Blumenstock and colleagues
asked the randomly selected people if they wanted to participate in a survey,
explained the nature of the research to them, and then asked a series of
questions about their demographic, social, and economic characteristics.
Everything I have said so far makes this sound like a traditional social
science survey. But what comes next is not traditional—at least not yet.
In addition to the survey data, Blumenstock and colleagues also had the
complete call records for all 1.5 million people. Combining these two sources
of data, they used the survey data to train a machine learning model to
predict a person’s wealth based on their call records. Next, they used this
model to estimate the wealth of all 1.5 million customers in the database.
They also estimated the places of residence of all 1.5 million customers using
the geographic information embedded in the call records. Putting all of this
together—the estimated wealth and the estimated place of residence—they
were able to produce high-resolution maps of the geographic distribution of
wealth in Rwanda. In particular, they could produce an estimated wealth for
each of Rwanda’s 2,148 cells, the smallest administrative unit in the country.
It was impossible to validate these estimates because nobody had ever
produced estimates for such small geographic areas in Rwanda. But when
Blumenstock and colleagues aggregated their estimates to Rwanda’s thirty
districts, they found that these estimates were very similar to those from the
1

Demographic and Health Survey, which is widely considered to be the gold
standard of surveys in developing countries. Although these two approaches
produced similar estimates in this case, the approach of Blumenstock and
colleagues was about ten times faster and fifty times cheaper than the
traditional Demographic and Health Surveys. These dramatically faster and
cheaper estimates create new possibilities for researchers, governments, and
companies (Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On 2015).
This study is kind of like a Rorschach inkblot test: what people see depends
on their background. Many social scientists see a new measurement tool
that can be used to test theories about economic development. Many data
scientists see a cool new machine learning problem. Many business people
see a powerful approach for unlocking value in the big data that they have
already collected. Many privacy advocates see a scary reminder that we live
in a time of mass surveillance. And finally, many policy makers see a way that
new technology can help create a better world. In fact, this study is all of those
things, and because it has this mix of characteristics, I see it as a window into
the future of social research.
1.2
Welcome to the digital age
The digital age is everywhere, it’s growing, and it changes what is
possible for researchers.
The central premise of this book is that the digital age creates new op-
portunities for social research. Researchers can now observe behavior, ask
questions, run experiments, and collaborate in ways that were simply im-
possible in the recent past. Along with these new opportunities come new
risks: researchers can now harm people in ways that were impossible in the
recent past. The source of these opportunities and risks is the transition
from the analog age to the digital age. This transition has not happened
all at once—like a light switch turning on—and, in fact, it is not yet
complete. However, we’ve seen enough by now to know that something big is
going on.
One way to notice this transition is to look for changes in your daily life.
Many things in your life that used to be analog are now digital. Maybe you
used to use a camera with film, but now you use a digital camera (which
is probably part of your smart phone). Maybe you used to read a physical
2
CHAPTER 1

newspaper, but now you read an online newspaper. Maybe you used to pay
for things with cash, but now you pay with a credit card. In each case, the
change from analog to digital means that more data about you are being
captured and stored digitally.
In fact, when looked at in aggregate, the effects of the transition are
astonishing. The amount of information in the world is rapidly increasing,
and more of that information is stored digitally, which facilitates analysis,
transmission, and merging (figure 1.1). All of this digital information has
come to be called “big data.” In addition to this explosion of digital data,
there is a parallel growth in our access to computing power (figure 1.1).
These trends—increasing amounts of digital data and increasing use of
computing—are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
For the purposes of social research, I think the most important feature of
the digital age is computers everywhere. Beginning as room-sized machines
that were available only to governments and big companies, computers have
been shrinking in size and increasing in ubiquity. Each decade since the 1980s
has seen a new kind of computing emerge: personal computers, laptops,
smart phones, and now embedded processors in the “Internet of Things”
(i.e., computers inside of devices such as cars, watches, and thermostats)
(Waldrop 2016). Increasingly, these ubiquitous computers do more than just
calculate: they also sense, store, and transmit information.
For researchers, the implications of the presence of computers everywhere
are easiest to see online, an environment that is fully measured and amenable
to experimentation. For example, an online store can easily collect incredibly
precise data about the shopping patterns of millions of customers. Further,
it can easily randomize groups of customers to receive different shopping
experiences. This ability to randomize on top of tracking means that online
stores can constantly run randomized controlled experiments. In fact, if
you’ve ever bought anything from an online store, your behavior has been
tracked and you’ve almost certainly been a participant in an experiment,
whether you knew it or not.
This fully measured, fully randomizable world is not just happening on-
line; it is increasingly happening everywhere. Physical stores already collect
extremely detailed purchase data, and they are developing infrastructure
to monitor customers’ shopping behavior and mix experimentation into
routine business practice. The “Internet of Things” means that behavior in
the physical world will increasingly be captured by digital sensors. In other

words, when you think about social research in the digital age, you should
not just think online, you should think everywhere.
In addition to enabling the measurement of behavior and randomization
of treatments, the digital age has also created new ways for people to
communicate. These new forms of communication allow researchers to run
innovative surveys and to create mass collaboration with their colleagues and
the general public.
A skeptic might point out that none of these capabilities are really new.
That is, in the past, there have been other major advances in people’s abilities
to communicate (e.g., the telegraph (Gleick 2011)), and computers have been
getting faster at roughly the same rate since the 1960s (Waldrop 2016). But
what this skeptic is missing is that at a certain point more of the same
becomes something different (Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira 2009). Here’s an
analogy that I like. If you can capture an image of a horse, then you have a
photograph. And if you can capture 24 images of a horse per second, then
you have a movie. Of course, a movie is just a bunch of photos, but only a
die-hard skeptic would claim that photos and movies are the same.
Researchers are in the process of making a change akin to the transition
from photography to cinematography. This change, however, does not mean
that everything we have learned in the past should be ignored. Just as the
principles of photography inform those of cinematography, the principles
of social research that have been developed over the past 100 years will
inform the social research taking place over the next 100 years. But the
change also means that we should not just keep doing the same thing.
Rather, we must combine the approaches of the past with the capabilities
of the present and future. For example, the research of Joshua Blumenstock
and colleagues was a mixture of traditional survey research with what some
might call data science. Both of these ingredients were necessary: neither the
survey responses nor the call records by themselves were enough to produce
high-resolution estimates of poverty. More generally, social researchers will
need to combine ideas from social science and data science in order to take
advantage of the opportunities of the digital age: neither approach alone will
be enough.
1.3
Research design
Research design is about connecting questions and answers.
INTRODUCTION
5

This book is written for two audiences that have a lot to learn from each
other. On the one hand, it is for social scientists who have training and
experience studying social behavior, but who are less familiar with the
opportunities created by the digital age. On the other hand, it is for another
group of researchers who are very comfortable using the tools of the digital
age, but who are new to studying social behavior. This second group resists
an easy name, but I will call them data scientists. These data scientists—who
often have training in fields such as computer science, statistics, information
science, engineering, and physics—have been some of the earliest adopters of
digital-age social research, in part because they have access to the necessary
data and computational skills. This book attempts to bring these two com-
munities together to produce something richer and more interesting than
either community could produce individually.
The best way to create this powerful hybrid is not to focus on abstract
social theory or fancy machine learning. The best place to start is research
design. If you think of social research as the process of asking and answering
questions about human behavior, then research design is the connective
tissue; research design links questions and answers. Getting this connection
right is the key to producing convincing research. This book will focus
on four approaches that you have seen—and maybe used—in the past:
observing behavior, asking questions, running experiments, and collabo-
rating with others. What is new, however, is that the digital age provides
us with different opportunities for collecting and analyzing data. These
new opportunities require us to modernize—but not replace—these classic
approaches.

Themes of this book
Two themes in the book are (1) mixing readymades and
custommades and (2) ethics.
Two themes run throughout this book, and I’d like to highlight them now
so that you notice them as they come up over and over again. The first
can be illustrated by an analogy that compares two greats: Marcel Duchamp
and Michelangelo. Duchamp is mostly known for his readymades, such
as Fountain, where he took ordinary objects and repurposed them as art.
Michelangelo, on the other hand, didn’t repurpose. When he wanted to
6
CHAPTER 1

Readymade
Custommade
Figure 1.2: Fountain by Marcel Duchamp and David by Michelangelo. Fountain is an
example of a readymade, where an artist sees something that already exists in the world
and then creatively repurposes it for art. David is an example of art that was intentionally
created; it is a custommade. Social research in the digital age will involve both readymades and
custommades. Photograph of Fountain by Alfred Stieglitz, 1917 (Source: The Blind Man, no.

dell’Accademia, Florence/Wikimedia Commons).
create a statue of David, he didn’t look for a piece of marble that kind of
looked like David: he spent three years laboring to create his masterpiece.
David is not a readymade; it is a custommade (figure 1.2).
These two styles—readymades and custommades—roughly map onto
styles that can be employed for social research in the digital age. As you
will see, some of the examples in this book involve clever repurposing of big
data sources that were originally created by companies and governments. In
other examples, however, a researcher started with a specific question and
then used the tools of the digital age to create the data needed to answer that
question. When done well, both of these styles can be incredibly powerful.
Therefore, social research in the digital age will involve both readymades and
custommades; it will involve both Duchamps and Michelangelos.
If you generally use readymade data, I hope that this book will show
you the value of custommade data. And likewise, if you generally use
custommade data, I hope that this book will show you the value of readymade
data. Finally, and most importantly, I hope that this book will show you
INTRODUCTION

the value of combining these two styles. For example, Joshua Blumenstock
and colleagues were part Duchamp and part Michelangelo: they repur-
posed the call records (a readymade), and they created their own survey
data (a custommade). This blending of readymades and custommades is
a pattern that you’ll see throughout this book; it tends to require ideas
from both social science and data science, and it often leads to the most
exciting research.
A second theme that runs through this book is ethics. I’ll show you how
researchers can use the capabilities of the digital age to conduct exciting and
important research. And I’ll show you how researchers who take advantage
of these opportunities will confront difficult ethical decisions. Chapter 6 will
be entirely devoted to ethics, but I integrate ethics into the other chapters as
well because, in the digital age, ethics will become an increasingly integral
part of research design.
The work of Blumenstock and colleagues is again illustrative. Having
access to the granular call records from 1.5 million people creates wonderful
opportunities for research, but it also creates opportunities for harm. For
example, Jonathan Mayer and colleagues (2016) have shown that even
“anonymized” call records (i.e., data without names and addresses) can be
combined with publicly available information in order to identify specific
people in the data and to infer sensitive information about them, such as
certain health information. To be clear, Blumenstock and colleagues did
not attempt to identify specific people and infer sensitive information about
them, but this possibility meant that it was difficult for them to acquire the
call data, and it forced them to take extensive safeguards while conducting
their research.
Beyond the details of the call records, there is a fundamental tension
that runs through a lot of social research in the digital age. Researchers—
often in collaboration with companies and governments—have increasing
power over the lives of participants. By power, I mean the ability to do
things to people without their consent or even awareness. For example,
researchers can now observe the behavior of millions of people, and, as
I’ll describe later, researchers can also enroll millions of people in massive
experiments. Further, all of this can happen without the consent or awareness
of the people involved. As the power of researchers is increasing, there has
not been an equivalent increase in clarity about how that power should be
used. In fact, researchers must decide how to exercise their power based
8
CHAPTER 1

on inconsistent and overlapping rules, laws, and norms. This combination
of powerful capabilities and vague guidelines can force even well-meaning
researchers to grapple with difficult decisions.
If you generally focus on how digital-age social research creates new
opportunities, I hope that this book will show you that these opportunities
also create new risks. And likewise, if you generally focus on these risks, I
hope that this book will help you see the opportunities—opportunities that
may require certain risks. Finally, and most importantly, I hope that this book
will help everyone to responsibly balance the risks and opportunities created
by digital-age social research. With an increase in power, there must also
come an increase in responsibility.
1.5
Outline of this book
This book progresses through four broad research designs: observing be-
havior, asking questions, running experiments, and creating mass collabo-
ration. Each of these approaches requires a different relationship between
researchers and participants, and each enables us to learn different things.
That is, if we ask people questions, we can learn things that we could not
learn merely by observing behavior. Likewise, if we run experiments, we can
learn things that we could not learn merely by observing behavior and asking
questions. Finally, if we collaborate with participants, we can learn things that
we could not learn by observing them, asking them questions, or enrolling
them in experiments. These four approaches were all used in some form fifty
years ago, and I’m confident that they will all still be used in some form fifty
years from now. After devoting one chapter to each approach, including the
ethical issues raised by that approach, I’ll devote a full chapter to ethics. As
mentioned in the preface, I’m going to keep the main text of the chapters as
clean as possible, and each of them will conclude with a section called “What
to read next” that includes important bibliographic information and pointers
to more detailed material.
Looking ahead, in chapter 2 (“Observing behavior”), I’ll describe what and
how researchers can learn from observing people’s behavior. In particular,
I’ll focus on big data sources created by companies and governments.
Abstracting away from the details of any specific source, I’ll describe
10 common features of the big data sources and how these impact re-
searchers’ ability to use these data sources for research. Then, I’ll illustrate
INTRODUCTION
9

three research strategies that can be used to successfully learn from big
data sources.
In chapter 3 (“Asking questions”), I’ll begin by showing what researchers
can learn by moving beyond preexisting big data. In particular, I’ll show
that by asking people questions, researchers can learn things that they can’t
easily learn by just observing behavior. In order to organize the opportunities
created by the digital age, I’ll review the traditional total survey error
framework. Then, I’ll show how the digital age enables new approaches
to both sampling and interviewing. Finally, I’ll describe two strategies for
combining survey data and big data sources.
In chapter 4 (“Running experiments”), I’ll begin by showing what re-
searchers can learn when they move beyond observing behavior and ask-
ing survey questions. In particular, I’ll show how randomized controlled
experiments—where the researcher intervenes in the world in a very specific
way—enable researchers to learn about causal relationships. I’ll compare the
kinds of experiments that we could do in the past with the kinds that we can
do now. With that background, I’ll describe the trade-offs involved in the two
main strategies for conducting digital experiments. Finally, I’ll conclude with
some design advice about how you can take advantage of the real power of
digital experiments, and I’ll describe some of the responsibilities that come
with that power.
In chapter 5 (“Creating mass collaboration”), I’ll show how researchers
can create mass collaborations—such as crowdsourcing and citizen science—
in order to do social research. By describing successful mass collaboration
projects and by providing a few key organizing principles, I hope to convince
you of two things: first, that mass collaboration can be harnessed for social
research, and, second, that researchers who use mass collaboration will be
able to solve problems that had previously seemed impossible.
In chapter 6 (“Ethics”), I’ll argue that researchers have rapidly increasing
power over participants and that these capabilities are changing faster than
our norms, rules, and laws. This combination of increasing power and lack
of agreement about how that power should be used leaves well-meaning
researchers in a difficult situation. To address this problem, I’ll argue that
researchers should adopt a principles-based approach. That is, researchers
should evaluate their research through existing rules—which I’ll take as
given—and through more general ethical principles. I’ll describe four estab-
lished principles and two ethical frameworks that can help guide researchers’
10
CHAPTER 1

decisions. Finally, I’ll explain some specific ethical challenges that I expect
will confront researchers in the future, and I’ll offer practical tips for working
in an area with unsettled ethics.
Finally, in chapter 7 (“The future”), I’ll review the themes that run through
the book, and then use them to speculate about themes that will be important
in the future.
Social research in the digital age will combine what we have done in the
past with the very different capabilities of the future. Thus, social research
will be shaped by both social scientists and data scientists. Each group has
something to contribute, and each has something to learn.

CHAPTER 1

CHAPTER 2
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
2.1
Introduction
In the analog age, collecting data about behavior—who does what, and
when—was expensive and therefore relatively rare. Now, in the digital age,
the behaviors of billions of people are recorded, stored, and analyzable. For
example, every time you click on a website, make a call on your mobile phone,
or pay for something with your credit card, a digital record of your behavior is
created and stored by a business. Because these types of data are a by-product
of people’s everyday actions, they are often called digital traces. In addition to
these traces held by businesses, there are also large amounts of incredibly rich
data held by governments. Together, these business and government records
are often called big data.
The ever-rising flood of big data means that we have moved from a world
where behavioral data was scarce to one where it is plentiful. A first step to
learning from big data is realizing that it is part of a broader category of data
that has been used for social research for many years: observational data.
Roughly, observational data is any data that results from observing a social
system without intervening in some way. A crude way to think about it is that
observational data is everything that does not involve talking with people
(e.g., surveys, the topic of chapter 3) or changing people’s environments
(e.g., experiments, the topic of chapter 4). Thus, in addition to business and
government records, observational data also includes things like the text of
newspaper articles and satellite photos.
This chapter has three parts. First, in section 2.2, I describe big data
sources in more detail and clarify a fundamental difference between them
and the data that have typically been used for social research in the past.
Then, in section 2.3, I describe 10 common characteristics of big data sources.
Understanding these characteristics enables you to quickly recognize the
13

strengths and weaknesses of existing sources and will help you harness
the new sources that will be available in the future. Finally, in section 2.4,
I describe three main research strategies that you can use to learn from
observational data: counting things, forecasting things, and approximating
an experiment.
2.2
Big data
Big data are created and collected by companies and governments
for purposes other than research. Using this data for research
therefore requires repurposing.
The first way that many people encounter social research in the digital age
is through what is often called big data. Despite the widespread use of this
term, there is no consensus about what big data even is. However, one of
the most common definitions of big data focuses on the “3 Vs”: Volume,
Variety, and Velocity. Roughly, there is a lot of data, in a variety of formats,
and it is being created constantly. Some fans of big data also add other
“Vs,” such as Veracity and Value, whereas some critics add “Vs” such as
Vague and Vacuous. Rather than the “3 Vs” (or the “5 Vs” or the “7 Vs”),
for the purposes of social research, I think a better place to start is the “5
Ws”: Who, What, Where, When, and Why. In fact, I think that many of the
challenges and opportunities created by big data sources follow from just one
“W”: Why.
In the analog age, most of the data that were used for social research
were created for the purpose of doing research. In the digital age, however,
huge amounts of data are being created by companies and governments for
purposes other than research, such as providing services, generating profit,
and administering laws. Creative people, however, have realized that you
can repurpose this corporate and government data for research. Thinking
back to the art analogy in chapter 1, just as Duchamp repurposed a found
object to create art, scientists can now repurpose found data to create
research.
While there are undoubtedly huge opportunities for repurposing, using
data that were not created for the purposes of research also presents new
challenges. Compare, for example, a social media service, such as Twitter,
with a traditional public opinion survey, such as the General Social Survey.
14
CHAPTER 2

Twitter’s main goals are to provide a service to its users and to make a profit.
The General Social Survey, on the other hand, is focused on creating general-
purpose data for social research, particularly for public opinion research.
This difference in goals means that the data created by Twitter and that
created by the General Social Survey have different properties, even though
both can be used for studying public opinion. Twitter operates at a scale and
speed that the General Social Survey cannot match, but, unlike the General
Social Survey, Twitter does not carefully sample users and does not work hard
to maintain comparability over time. Because these two data sources are so
different, it does not make sense to say that the General Social Survey is better
than Twitter, or vice versa. If you want hourly measures of global mood (e.g.,
Golder and Macy (2011)), Twitter is the best choice. On the other hand, if
you want to understand long-term changes in the polarization of attitudes
in the United States (e.g., DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson (1996)), then the
General Social Survey is best. More generally, rather than trying to argue that
big data sources are better or worse than other types of data, this chapter
will try to clarify for which kinds of research questions big data sources
have attractive properties and for which kinds of questions they might
not be ideal.
When thinking about big data sources, many researchers immediately
focus on online data created and collected by companies, such as search
engine logs and social media posts. However, this narrow focus leaves out
two other important sources of big data. First, increasingly, corporate big
data sources come from digital devices in the physical world. For example, in
this chapter, I’ll tell you about a study that repurposed supermarket check-
out data to study how a worker’s productivity is impacted by the productivity
of her peers (Mas and Moretti 2009). Then, in later chapters, I’ll tell you
about researchers who used call records from mobile phones (Blumenstock,
Cadamuro, and On 2015) and billing data created by electric utilities (Allcott
2015). As these examples illustrate, corporate big data sources are about more
than just online behavior.
The second important source of big data missed by a narrow focus on
online behavior is data created by governments. These government data,
which researchers call government administrative records, include things such
as tax records, school records, and vital statistics records (e.g., registries
of births and deaths). Governments have been creating these kinds of
data for, in some cases, hundreds of years, and social scientists have been
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
15

exploiting them for nearly as long as there have been social scientists.
What has changed, however, is digitization, which has made it dramatically
easier for governments to collect, transmit, store, and analyze data. For
example, in this chapter, I’ll tell you about a study that repurposed data
from New York City government’s digital taxi meters in order to address
a fundamental debate in labor economics (Farber 2015). Then, in later
chapters, I’ll tell you about how government-collected voting records were
used in a survey (Ansolabehere and Hersh 2012) and an experiment (Bond
et al. 2012).
I think the idea of repurposing is fundamental to learning from big data
sources, and so, before talking more specifically about the properties of big
data sources (section 2.3) and how these can be used in research (section 2.4),
I’d like to offer two pieces of general advice about repurposing. First, it can be
tempting to think about the contrast that I’ve set up as being between “found”
data and “designed” data. That’s close, but it’s not quite right. Even though,
from the perspective of researchers, big data sources are “found,” they don’t
just fall from the sky. Instead, data sources that are “found” by researchers are
designed by someone for some purpose. Because “found” data are designed
by someone, I always recommend that you try to understand as much as
possible about the people and processes that created your data. Second,
when you are repurposing data, it is often extremely helpful to imagine the
ideal dataset for your problem and then compare that ideal dataset with
the one that you are using. If you didn’t collect your data yourself, there
are likely to be important differences between what you want and what
you have. Noticing these differences will help clarify what you can and
cannot learn from the data you have, and it might suggest new data that you
should collect.
In my experience, social scientists and data scientists tend to approach re-
purposing very differently. Social scientists, who are accustomed to working
with data designed for research, are typically quick to point out the problems
with repurposed data, while ignoring its strengths. On the other hand, data
scientists are typically quick to point out the benefits of repurposed data,
while ignoring its weaknesses. Naturally, the best approach is a hybrid. That
is, researchers need to understand the characteristics of big data sources—
both good and bad—and then figure out how to learn from them. And,
that is the plan for the remainder of this chapter. In the next section, I
will describe 10 common characteristics of big data sources. Then, in the
16
CHAPTER 2

following section, I will describe three research approaches that can work
well with such data.
2.3
Ten common characteristics of big data
Big data sources tend to have a number of characteristics in
common; some are generally good for social research and some are
generally bad.
Even though each big data source is distinct, it is helpful to notice that there
are certain characteristics that tend to occur over and over again. Therefore,
rather than taking a platform-by-platform approach (e.g., here’s what you
need to know about Twitter, here’s what you need to know about Google
search data, etc.), I’m going to describe 10 general characteristics of big data
sources. Stepping back from the details of each particular system and looking
at these general characteristics enables researchers to quickly learn about
existing data sources and have a firm set of ideas to apply to the data sources
that will be created in the future.
Even though the desired characteristics of a data source depend on the
research goal, I find it helpful to crudely group the 10 characteristics into two
broad categories:
• generally helpful for research: big, always-on, and nonreactive
• generally problematic for research: incomplete, inaccessible, nonrepre-
sentative, drifting, algorithmically confounded, dirty, and sensitive
As I’m describing these characteristics, you’ll notice that they often arise
because big data sources were not created for the purpose of research.
2.3.1 Big
Large datasets are a means to an end; they are not an end in
themselves.
The most widely discussed feature of big data sources is that they are BIG.
Many papers, for example, start by discussing—and sometimes bragging—
about how much data they analyzed. For example, a paper published in
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
17

Science studying word-use trends in the Google Books corpus included the
following (Michel et al. 2011):
“[Our] corpus contains over 500 billion words, in English (361 billion),
French (45 billion), Spanish (45 billion), German (37 billion), Chinese
(13 billion), Russian (35 billion), and Hebrew (2 billion). The oldest
works were published in the 1500s. The early decades are represented
by only a few books per year, comprising several hundred thousand
words. By 1800, the corpus grows to 98 million words per year;
by 1900, 1.8 billion; and by 2000, 11 billion. The corpus cannot be
read by a human. If you tried to read only English-language entries
from the year 2000 alone, at the reasonable pace of 200 words/min,
without interruptions for food or sleep, it would take 80 years. The
sequence of letters is 1000 times longer than the human genome: If you
wrote it out in a straight line, it would reach to the Moon and back
10 times over.”
The scale of this data is undoubtedly impressive, and we are all fortunate
that the Google Books team has released these data to the public (in fact, some
of the activities at the end of this chapter make use of this data). However,
whenever you see something like this, you should ask: Is that all that data
really doing anything? Could they have done the same research if the data
could reach to the Moon and back only once? What if the data could only
reach to the top of Mount Everest or the top of the Eiffel Tower?
In this case, their research does, in fact, have some findings that require
a huge corpus of words over a long time period. For example, one thing
they explore is the evolution of grammar, particularly changes in the rate of
irregular verb conjugation. Since some irregular verbs are quite rare, a large
amount of data is needed to detect changes over time. Too often, however,
researchers seem to treat the size of big data source as an end—“look how
much data I can crunch”—rather than a means to some more important
scientific objective.
In my experience, the study of rare events is one of the three specific
scientific ends that large datasets tend to enable. The second is the study of
heterogeneity, as can be illustrated by a study by Raj Chetty and colleagues
(2014) on social mobility in the United States. In the past, many researchers
have studied social mobility by comparing the life outcomes of parents and

Figure 2.1: Estimates of a child’s chances of reaching the top 20% of income distribution
given parents in the bottom 20% (Chetty et al. 2014). The regional-level estimates, which
show heterogeneity, naturally lead to interesting and important questions that do not arise
from a single national-level estimate. These regional-level estimates were made possible in
part because the researchers were using a large big data source: the tax records of 40 million
people. Created from data available at http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/.
children. A consistent finding from this literature is that advantaged parents
tend to have advantaged children, but the strength of this relationship varies
over time and across countries (Hout and DiPrete 2006). More recently,
however, Chetty and colleagues were able to use the tax records from 40
million people to estimate the heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility
across regions in the United States (figure 2.1). They found, for example, that
the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income
distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is about 13% in San
Jose, California, but only about 4% in Charlotte, North Carolina. If you look
at figure 2.1 for a moment, you might begin to wonder why intergenerational
mobility is higher in some places than others. Chetty and colleagues had
exactly the same question, and they found that that high-mobility areas
have less residential segregation, less income inequality, better primary
schools, greater social capital, and greater family stability. Of course, these
correlations alone do not show that these factors cause higher mobility, but
they do suggest possible mechanisms that can be explored in further work,
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
19

which is exactly what Chetty and colleagues have done in subsequent work.
Notice how the size of the data was really important in this project. If Chetty
and colleagues had used the tax records of 40 thousand people rather than
40 million, they would not have been able to estimate regional heterogeneity,
and they never would have been able to do subsequent research to try to
identify the mechanisms that create this variation.
Finally, in addition to studying rare events and studying heterogeneity,
large datasets also enable researchers to detect small differences. In fact,
much of the focus on big data in industry is about these small differences:
reliably detecting the difference between 1% and 1.1% click-through rates on
an ad can translate into millions of dollars in extra revenue. In some scientific
settings, however, such small differences might not be particular important,
even if they are statistically significant (Prentice and Miller 1992). But, in
some policy settings, they can become important when viewed in aggregate.
For example, if there are two public health interventions and one is slightly
more effective than the other, then picking the more effective intervention
could end up saving thousands of additional lives.
Although bigness is generally a good property when used correctly, I’ve
noticed that it can sometimes lead to a conceptual error. For some reason,
bigness seems to lead researchers to ignore how their data was generated.
While bigness does reduce the need to worry about random error, it actually
increases the need to worry about systematic errors, the kinds of errors that
I’ll describe below that arise from biases in how data are created. For example,
in a project I’ll describe later in this chapter, researchers used messages
generated on September 11, 2001 to produce a high-resolution emotional
timeline of the reaction to the terrorist attack (Back, Küfner, and Egloff 2010).
Because the researchers had a large number of messages, they didn’t really
need to worry about whether the patterns they observed—increasing anger
over the course of the day—could be explained by random variation. There
was so much data and the pattern was so clear that all the statistical statistical
tests suggested that this was a real pattern. But these statistical tests were
ignorant of how the data was created. In fact, it turned out that many of
the patterns were attributable to a single bot that generated more and more
meaningless messages throughout the day. Removing this one bot completely
destroyed some of the key findings in the paper (Pury 2011; Back, Küfner,
and Egloff 2011). Quite simply, researchers who don’t think about systematic
error face the risk of using their large datasets to get a precise estimate
20
CHAPTER 2

of an unimportant quantity, such as the emotional content of meaningless
messages produced by an automated bot.
In conclusion, big datasets are not an end in themselves, but they can
enable certain kinds of research, including the study of rare events, the
estimation of heterogeneity, and the detection of small differences. Big
datasets also seem to lead some researchers to ignore how their data was
created, which can lead them to get a precise estimate of an unimportant
quantity.
2.3.2 Always-on
Always-on big data enables the study of unexpected events and
real-time measurement.
Many big data systems are always-on; they are constantly collecting data.
This always-on characteristic provides researchers with longitudinal data
(i.e., data over time). Being always-on has two important implications for
research.
First, always-on data collection enables researchers to study unexpected
events in ways that would not otherwise be possible. For example, researchers
interested in studying the Occupy Gezi protests in Turkey in the summer of
2013 would typically focus on the behavior of protesters during the event.
Ceren Budak and Duncan Watts (2015) were able to do more by using the
always-on nature of Twitter to study protesters who used Twitter before,
during, and after the event. And they were able to create a comparison
group of nonparticipants before, during, and after the event (figure 2.2).
In total, their ex-post panel included the tweets of 30,000 people over two
years. By augmenting the commonly used data from the protests with this
other information, Budak and Watts were able to learn much more: they
were able to estimate what kinds of people were more likely to participate
in the Gezi protests and to estimate the changes in attitudes of participants
and nonparticipants, both in the short term (comparing pre-Gezi with during
Gezi) and in the long term (comparing pre-Gezi with post-Gezi).
A skeptic might point out that some of these estimates could have been
made without always-on data collection sources (e.g., long-term estimates
of attitude change), and that is correct, although such a data collection for
30,000 people would have been quite expensive. Even given an unlimited

Figure 2.2: Design used by Budak and Watts (2015) to study the Occupy Gezi protests in
Turkey in the summer of 2013. By using the always-on nature of Twitter, the researchers
created what they called an ex-post panel that included about 30,000 people over two years. In
contrast to a typical study that focused on participants during the protests, the ex-post panel
adds (1) data from participants before and after the event and (2) data from nonparticipants
before, during, and after the event. This enriched data structure enabled Budak and Watts
to estimate what kinds of people were more likely to participate in the Gezi protests and
to estimate the changes in attitudes of participants and nonparticipants, both in the short
term (comparing pre-Gezi with during Gezi) and in the long term (comparing pre-Gezi with
post-Gezi).
budget, however, I can’t think of any other method that essentially allows
researchers to travel back in time and directly observe participants’ behavior
in the past. The closest alternative would be to collect retrospective reports
of behavior, but these would be of limited granularity and questionable
accuracy. Table 2.1 provides other examples of studies that use an always-
on data source to study an unexpected event.
In addition to studying unexpected events, always-on big data systems also
enable researchers to produce real-time estimates, which can be important in
settings where policy makers—in government or industry—want to respond
based on situational awareness. For example, social media data can be used to
guide emergency response to natural disasters (Castillo 2016), and a variety
of different big data sources can be used produce real-time estimates of
economic activity (Choi and Varian 2012).
In conclusion, always-on data systems enable researchers to study un-
expected events and provide real-time information to policy makers. I do
not, however, think that always-on data systems are well suited for tracking
changes over very long periods of time. That is because many big data systems
are constantly changing—a process that I’ll call drift later in the chapter
(section 2.3.7).

2.3.3 Nonreactive
Measurement in big data sources is much less likely to change
behavior.
One challenge of social research is that people can change their behavior
when they know that they are being observed by researchers. Social scientists
generally call this reactivity (Webb et al. 1966). For example, people can
be more generous in laboratory studies than field studies because in the
former they are very aware that they are being observed (Levitt and List
2007a). One aspect of big data that many researchers find promising is that
participants are generally not aware that their data are being captured or they
have become so accustomed to this data collection that it no longer changes
their behavior. Because participants are nonreactive, therefore, many sources
of big data can be used to study behavior that has not been amenable to
accurate measurement previously. For example, Stephens-Davidowitz (2014)
used the prevalence of racist terms in search engine queries to measure racial
animus in different regions of the United States. The nonreactive and big (see
section 2.3.1) nature of the search data enabled measurements that would be
difficult using other methods, such as surveys.
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
23

Nonreactivity, however, does not ensure that these data are somehow
a direct reflection of people’s behavior or attitudes. For example, as one
respondent in an interview-based study said, “It’s not that I don’t have
problems, I’m just not putting them on Facebook” (Newman et al. 2011).
In other words, even though some big data sources are nonreactive, they
are not always free of social desirability bias, the tendency for people to
want to present themselves in the best possible way. Further, as I’ll describe
later in the chapter, the behavior captured in big data sources is sometimes
impacted by the goals of platform owners, an issue I’ll call algorithmic
confounding. Finally, although nonreactivity is advantageous for research,
tracking people’s behavior without their consent and awareness raises ethical
concerns that I’ll describe in chapter 6.
The three properties that I just described—big, always-on, and
nonreactive—are generally, but not always, advantageous for social research.
Next, I’ll turn to the seven properties of big data sources—incomplete,
inaccessible, nonrepresentative, drifting, algorithmically confounded, dirty,
and sensitive—that generally, but not always, create problems for research.
2.3.4 Incomplete
No matter how big your big data, it probably doesn’t have the
information you want.
Most big data sources are incomplete, in the sense that they don’t have the
information that you will want for your research. This is a common feature
of data that were created for purposes other than research. Many social
scientists have already had the experience of dealing with incompleteness,
such as an existing survey that didn’t ask the question that was needed.
Unfortunately, the problems of incompleteness tend to be more extreme
in big data. In my experience, big data tends to be missing three types of
information useful for social research: demographic information about par-
ticipants, behavior on other platforms, and data to operationalize theoretical
constructs.
Of the three kinds of incompleteness, the problem of incomplete data
to operationalize theoretical constructs is the hardest to solve. And in my
experience, it is often accidentally overlooked. Roughly, theoretical con-
structs are abstract ideas that social scientists study, and operationalizing a
24
CHAPTER 2

theoretical construct means proposing some way to capture that construct
with observable data. Unfortunately, this simple-sounding process often
turns out to be quite difficult. For example, let’s imagine trying to empirically
test the apparently simple claim that people who are more intelligent earn
more money. In order to test this claim, you would need to measure
“intelligence.” But what is intelligence? Gardner (2011) argued that there
are actually eight different forms of intelligence. And are there procedures
that could accurately measure any of these forms of intelligence? Despite
enormous amounts of work by psychologists, these questions still don’t have
unambiguous answers.
Thus, even a relatively simple claim—people who are more intelligent
earn more money—can be hard to assess empirically because it can be
hard to operationalize theoretical constructs in data. Other examples of
theoretical constructs that are important but hard to operationalize include
“norms,” “social capital,” and “democracy.” Social scientists call the match
between theoretical constructs and data construct validity (Cronbach and
Meehl 1955). As this short list of constructs suggests, construct validity is
a problem that social scientists have struggled with for a very long time. But
in my experience, the problems of construct validity are even greater when
working with data that were not created for the purposes of research (Lazer
2015).
When you are assessing a research result, one quick and useful way to
assess construct validity is to take the result, which is usually expressed
in terms of constructs, and re-express it in terms of the data used. For
example, consider two hypothetical studies that claim to show that people
who are more intelligent earn more money. In the first study, the researcher
found that people who score well on the Raven Progressive Matrices Test—a
well-studied test of analytic intelligence (Carpenter, Just, and Shell 1990)—
have higher reported incomes on their tax returns. In the second study, the
researcher found that people on Twitter who used longer words are more
likely to mention luxury brands. In both cases, these researchers could claim
that they have shown that people who are more intelligent earn more money.
However, in the first study the theoretical constructs are well operationalized
by the data, while in the second they are not. Further, as this example
illustrates, more data does not automatically solve problems with construct
validity. You should doubt the results of the second study whether it involved
a million tweets, a billion tweets, or a trillion tweets. For researchers not

familiar with the idea of construct validity, table 2.2 provides some examples
of studies that have operationalized theoretical constructs using digital
trace data.
Although the problem of incomplete data for capturing theoretical con-
structs is pretty hard to solve, there are common solutions to the other
common types of incompleteness: incomplete demographic information and
incomplete information on behavior on other platforms. The first solution
is to actually collect the data you need; I’ll tell you about that in chapter 3
when I talk about surveys. The second main solution is to do what data
scientists call user-attribute inference and social scientists call imputation. In
this approach, researchers use the information that they have on some people
to infer attributes of other people. A third possible solution is to combine
multiple data sources. This process is sometimes called record linkage. My
favorite metaphor for this process was written by Dunn (1946) in the very
first paragraph of the very first paper ever written on record linkage:
“Each person in the world creates a Book of Life. This Book starts with
birth and ends with death. Its pages are made up of records of the
principal events in life. Record linkage is the name given to the process
of assembling the pages of this book into a volume.”
When Dunn wrote that passage, he was imagining that the Book of Life
could include major life events like birth, marriage, divorce, and death.
However, now that so much information about people is recorded, the
Book of Life could be an incredibly detailed portrait, if those different pages
26
CHAPTER 2

(i.e., our digital traces) can be bound together. This Book of Life could be a
great resource for researchers. But it could also be called a database of ruin
(Ohm 2010), which could be used for all kinds of unethical purposes, as I’ll
describe in chapter 6 (Ethics).
2.3.5 Inaccessible
Data held by companies and governments are difﬁcult for
researchers to access.
In May 2014, the US National Security Agency opened a data center in rural
Utah with an awkward name, the Intelligence Community Comprehensive
National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center. However, this data center,
which has come to be known as the Utah Data Center, is reported to
have astounding capabilities. One report alleges that it is able to store and
process all forms of communication including “the complete contents of
private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of
personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases,
and other digital ‘pocket litter’ ” (Bamford 2012). In addition to raising
concerns about the sensitive nature of much of the information captured in
big data, which will be described further below, the Utah Data Center is an
extreme example of a rich data source that is inaccessible to researchers. More
generally, many sources of big data that would be useful are controlled and
restricted by governments (e.g., tax data and educational data) or companies
(e.g., queries to search engines and phone call meta-data). Therefore, even
though these data sources exist, they are useless for the purposes of social
research because they are inaccessible.
In my experience, many researchers based at universities misunderstand
the source of this inaccessibility. These data are inaccessible not because
people at companies and governments are stupid, lazy, or uncaring. Rather,
there are serious legal, business, and ethical barriers that prevent data access.
For example, some terms-of-service agreements for websites only allow data
to be used by employees or to improve the service. So certain forms of
data sharing could expose companies to legitimate lawsuits from customers.
There are also substantial business risks to companies involved in sharing
data. Try to imagine how the public would respond if personal search data
accidentally leaked out from Google as part of a university research project.
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
27

Such a data breach, if extreme, might even be an existential risk for the
company. So Google—and most large companies—are very risk-averse about
sharing data with researchers.
In fact, almost everyone who is in a position to provide access to large
amounts of data knows the story of Abdur Chowdhury. In 2006, when he
was the head of research at AOL, he intentionally released to the research
community what he thought were anonymized search queries from 650,000
AOL users. As far as I can tell, Chowdhury and the researchers at AOL
had good intentions, and they thought that they had anonymized the data.
But they were wrong. It was quickly discovered that the data were not as
anonymous as the researchers thought, and reporters from the New York
Times were able to identify someone in the dataset with ease (Barbaro and
Zeller 2006). Once these problems were discovered, Chowdhury removed the
data from AOL’s website, but it was too late. The data had been reposted on
other websites, and it will probably still be available when you are reading this
book. Ultimately, Chowdhury was fired, and AOL’s chief technology officer
resigned (Hafner 2006). As this example shows, the benefits for specific
individuals inside of companies to facilitate data access are pretty small, and
the worst-case scenario is terrible.
Researchers can, however, sometimes gain access to data that is inac-
cessible to the general public. Some governments have procedures that
researchers can follow to apply for access, and, as the examples later in this
chapter show, researchers can occasionally gain access to corporate data.
For example, Einav et al. (2015) partnered with a researcher at eBay to
study online auctions. I’ll talk more about the research that came from this
collaboration later in the chapter, but I mention it now because it had all
four of the ingredients that I see in successful partnerships: researcher in-
terest, researcher capability, company interest, and company capability. I’ve
seen many potential collaborations fail because either the researcher or the
partner—be it a company or government—lacked one of these ingredients.
Even if you are able to develop a partnership with a business or to gain
access to restricted government data, however, there are some downsides
for you. First, you will probably not be able to share your data with other
researchers, which means that other researchers will not be able to verify and
extend your results. Second, the questions that you can ask may be limited;
companies are unlikely to allow research that could make them look bad.
Finally, these partnerships can create at least the appearance of a conflict of
28
CHAPTER 2

interest, where people might think that your results were influenced by your
partnerships. All of these downsides can be addressed, but it is important to
be clear that working with data that is not accessible to everyone has both
upsides and downsides.
In summary, lots of big data are inaccessible to researchers. There are
serious legal, business, and ethical barriers that prevent data access, and
these barriers will not go away as technology improves, because they are not
technical barriers. Some national governments have established procedures
for enabling data access for some datasets, but the process is especially ad hoc
at the state and local levels. Also, in some cases, researchers can partner with
companies to obtain data access, but this can create a variety of problems for
researchers and companies.
2.3.6 Nonrepresentative
Nonrepresentative data are bad for out-of-sample generalizations,
but can be quite useful for within-sample comparisons.
Some social scientists are accustomed to working with data that comes from
a probabilistic random sample from a well-defined population, such as all
adults in a particular country. This kind of data is called representative data
because the sample “represents” the larger population. Many researchers
prize representative data, and, to some, representative data is synonymous
with rigorous science whereas nonrepresentative data is synonymous with
sloppiness. At the most extreme, some skeptics seem to believe that nothing
can be learned from nonrepresentative data. If true, this would seem to
severely limit what can be learned from big data sources because many of
them are nonrepresentative. Fortunately, these skeptics are only partially
right. There are certain research goals for which nonrepresentative data is
clearly not well suited, but there are others for which it might actually be
quite useful.
To understand this distinction, let’s consider a scientific classic: John
Snow’s study of the 1853–54 cholera outbreak in London. At the time, many
doctors believed that cholera was caused by “bad air,” but Snow believed
that it was an infectious disease, perhaps spread by sewage-laced drinking
water. To test this idea, Snow took advantage of what we might now call a
natural experiment. He compared the cholera rates of households served by
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
29

two different water companies: Lambeth and Southwark & Vauxhall. These
companies served similar households, but they differed in one important
way: in 1849—a few years before the epidemic began—Lambeth moved
its intake point upstream from the main sewage discharge in London,
whereas Southwark & Vauxhall left their intake pipe downstream from
the sewage discharge. When Snow compared the death rates from cholera
in households served by the two companies, he found that customers of
Southwark & Vauxhall—the company that was providing customers sewage-
tainted water—were 10 times more likely to die from cholera. This result
provides strong scientific evidence for Snow’s argument about the cause of
cholera, even though it is not based on a representative sample of people
in London.
The data from these two companies, however, would not be ideal for
answering a different question: what was the prevalence of cholera in London
during the outbreak? For that second question, which is also important,
it would be much better to have a representative sample of people from
London.
As Snow’s work illustrates, there are some scientific questions for which
nonrepresentative data can be quite effective, and there are others for which
it is not well suited. One crude way to distinguish these two kinds of
questions is that some questions are about within-sample comparisons and
some are about out-of-sample generalizations. This distinction can be further
illustrated by another classic study in epidemiology: the British Doctors
Study, which played an important role in demonstrating that smoking
causes cancer. In this study, Richard Doll and A. Bradford Hill followed
approximately 25,000 male doctors for several years and compared their
death rates based on the amount that they smoked when the study began.
Doll and Hill (1954) found a strong exposure–response relationship: the
more heavily people smoked, the more likely they were to die from lung
cancer. Of course, it would be unwise to estimate the prevalence of lung
cancer among all British people based on this group of male doctors, but
the within-sample comparison still provides evidence that smoking causes
lung cancer.
Now that I’ve illustrated the difference between within-sample compar-
isons and out-of-sample generalizations, two caveats are in order. First, there
are naturally questions about the extent to which a relationship that holds
within a sample of male British doctors will also hold within a sample of
30
CHAPTER 2

female British doctors or male British factory workers or female German
factory workers or many other groups. These questions are interesting and
important, but they are different from questions about the extent to which
we can generalize from a sample to a population. Notice, for example, that
you probably suspect that the relationship between smoking and cancer
that was found in male British doctors will probably be similar in these
other groups. Your ability to do this extrapolation does not come from
the fact that male British doctors are a probabilistic random sample from
any population; rather, it comes from an understanding of the mechanism
that links smoking and cancer. Thus, the generalization from a sample
to the population from which it is drawn is a largely a statistical issue,
but questions about the transportability of pattern found in one group to
another group is largely a nonstatistical issue (Pearl and Bareinboim 2014;
Pearl 2015).
At this point, a skeptic might point out that most social patterns are prob-
ably less transportable across groups than the relationship between smoking
and cancer. And I agree. The extent to which we should expect patterns to
be transportable is ultimately a scientific question that has to be decided
based on theory and evidence. It should not automatically be assumed that
patterns will be transportable, but nor should be it assumed that they won’t
be transportable. These somewhat abstract questions about transportability
will be familiar to you if you have followed the debates about how much
researchers can learn about human behavior by studying undergraduate
students (Sears 1986, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010b)). Despite
these debates, however, it would be unreasonable to say that researchers can’t
learn anything from studying undergraduate students.
The second caveat is that most researchers with nonrepresentative data
are not as careful as Snow or Doll and Hill. So, to illustrate what can go
wrong when researchers try to make an out-of-sample generalization from
nonrepresentative data, I’d like to tell you about a study of the 2009 German
parliamentary election by Andranik Tumasjan and colleagues (2010). By
analyzing more than 100,000 tweets, they found that the proportion of
tweets mentioning a political party matched the proportion of votes that
party received in the parliamentary election (figure 2.3). In other words,
it appeared that Twitter data, which was essentially free, could replace
traditional public opinion surveys, which are expensive because of their
emphasis on representative data.

Figure 2.3: Twitter mentions appear to predict the results of the 2009 German election
(Tumasjan et al. 2010), but this result depends on excluding the party with the most mentions:
the Pirate Party (Jungherr, Jürgens, and Schoen 2012). See Tumasjan et al. (2012) for an
argument in favor of excluding the Pirate Party. Adapted from Tumasjan et al. (2010), table 4,
and Jungherr, Jürgens, and Schoen (2012), table 2.
Given what you probably already know about Twitter, you should im-
mediately be skeptical of this result. Germans on Twitter in 2009 were not
a probabilistic random sample of German voters, and supporters of some
parties might tweet about politics much more often than supporters of
other parties. Thus, it seems surprising that all of the possible biases that
you could imagine would somehow cancel out so that this data would be
directly reflective of German voters. In fact, the results in Tumasjan et al.
(2010) turned out to be too good to be true. A follow-up paper by Andreas
Jungherr, Pascal Jürgens, and Harald Schoen (2012) pointed out that the
original analysis had excluded the political party that had received the most
mentions on Twitter: the Pirate Party, a small party that fights government
regulation of the Internet. When the Pirate Party was included in the analysis,
Twitter mentions becomes a terrible predictor of election results (figure 2.3).
As this example illustrates, using nonrepresentative big data sources to do
out-of-sample generalizations can go very wrong. Also, you should notice
that the fact that there were 100,000 tweets was basically irrelevant: lots of
nonrepresentative data is still nonrepresentative, a theme that I’ll return to in
chapter 3 when I discuss surveys.
32
CHAPTER 2

To conclude, many big data sources are not representative samples from
some well-defined population. For questions that require generalizing re-
sults from the sample to the population from which it was drawn, this
is a serious problem. But for questions about within-sample comparisons,
nonrepresentative data can be powerful, so long as researchers are clear about
the characteristics of their sample and support claims about transportability
with theoretical or empirical evidence. In fact, my hope is that big data
sources will enable researchers to make more within-sample comparisons
in many nonrepresentative groups, and my guess is that estimates from
many different groups will do more to advance social research than a single
estimate from a probabilistic random sample.
2.3.7 Drifting
Population drift, usage drift, and system drift make it hard to use big
data sources to study long-term trends.
One of the great advantages of many big data sources is that they collect
data over time. Social scientists call this kind of over-time data longitudinal
data. And, naturally, longitudinal data are very important for studying
change. In order to reliably measure change, however, the measurement
system itself must be stable. In the words of sociologist Otis Dudley Dun-
can, “if you want to measure change, don’t change the measure” (Fischer
2011).
Unfortunately, many big data systems—especially business systems—are
changing all the time, a process that I’ll call drift. In particular, these systems
change in three main ways: population drift (change in who is using them),
behavioral drift (change in how people are using them), and system drift
(change in the system itself). The three sources of drift mean that any pattern
in a big data source could be caused by an important change in the world, or
it could be caused by some form of drift.
The first source of drift—population drift—is caused by changes in who
is using the system, and these changes can happen on both short and long
timescales. For example, during the US Presidential election of 2012 the
proportion of tweets about politics that were written by women fluctuated
from day to day (Diaz et al. 2016). Thus, what might appear to be a change
in the mood of the Twitter-verse might actually just be a change in who is
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
33

talking at any moment. In addition to these short-term fluctuations, there
has also been a long-term trend of certain demographic groups adopting and
abandoning Twitter.
In addition to changes in who is using a system, there are also changes
in how the system is used, which I call behavioral drift. For example, during
the 2013 Occupy Gezi protests in Turkey, protesters changed their use of
hashtags as the protest evolved. Here’s how Zeynep Tufekci (2014) described
the behavioral drift, which she was able to detect because she was observing
behavior on Twitter and in person:
“What had happened was that as soon as the protest became the
dominant story, large numbers of people ...stopped using the hash-
tags except to draw attention to a new phenomenon ...While the
protests continued, and even intensified, the hashtags died down.
Interviews revealed two reasons for this. First, once everyone knew
the topic, the hashtag was at once superfluous and wasteful on the
character-limited Twitter platform. Second, hashtags were seen only
as useful for attracting attention to a particular topic, not for talking
about it.”
Thus, researchers who were studying the protests by analyzing tweets
with protest-related hashtags would have a distorted sense of what was
happening because of this behavioral drift. For example, they might be-
lieve that the discussion of the protest decreased long before it actually
decreased.
The third kind of drift is system drift. In this case, it is not the peo-
ple changing or their behavior changing, but the system itself changing.
For example, over time, Facebook has increased the limit on the length
of status updates. Thus, any longitudinal study of status updates will
be vulnerable to artifacts caused by this change. System drift is closely
related to a problem called algorithmic confounding, which I’ll cover
in section 2.3.8.
To conclude, many big data sources are drifting because of changes in who
is using them, in how they are being used, and in how the systems work.
These sources of change are sometimes interesting research questions, but
these changes complicate the ability of big data sources to track long-term
changes over time.
34
CHAPTER 2

2.3.8 Algorithmically confounded
Behavior in big data systems is not natural; it is driven by the
engineering goals of the systems.
Although many big data sources are nonreactive because people are not
aware their data are being recorded (section 2.3.3), researchers should not
consider behavior in these online systems to be “naturally occurring.” In
reality, the digital systems that record behavior are highly engineered to
induce specific behaviors such as clicking on ads or posting content. The
ways that the goals of system designers can introduce patterns into data
is called algorithmic confounding. Algorithmic confounding is relatively
unknown to social scientists, but it is a major concern among careful
data scientists. And, unlike some of the other problems with digital traces,
algorithmic confounding is largely invisible.
A relatively simple example of algorithmic confounding is the fact that on
Facebook there are an anomalously high number of users with approximately
20 friends, as was discovered by Johan Ugander and colleagues (2011).
Scientists analyzing this data without any understanding of how Facebook
works could doubtless generate many stories about how 20 is some kind
of magical social number. Fortunately, Ugander and his colleagues had a
substantial understanding of the process that generated the data, and they
knew that Facebook encouraged people with few connections on Facebook
to make more friends until they reached 20 friends. Although Ugander and
colleagues don’t say this in their paper, this policy was presumably created by
Facebook in order to encourage new users to become more active. Without
knowing about the existence of this policy, however, it is easy to draw
the wrong conclusion from the data. In other words, the surprisingly high
number of people with about 20 friends tells us more about Facebook than
about human behavior.
In this previous example, algorithmic confounding produced a quirky
result that a careful researcher might detect and investigate further. However,
there is an even trickier version of algorithmic confounding that occurs
when designers of online systems are aware of social theories and then
bake these theories into the working of their systems. Social scientists
call this performativity: when a theory changes the world in such a way
that it bring the world more into line with the theory. In the case of
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
35

performative algorithmic confounding, the confounded nature of the data
is likely invisible.
One example of a pattern created by performativity is transitivity in online
social networks. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers repeatedly found that
if you are friends with both Alice and Bob, then Alice and Bob are more
likely to be friends with each other than if they were two randomly chosen
people. This very same pattern was found in the social graph on Facebook
(Ugander et al. 2011). Thus, one might conclude that patterns of friendship
on Facebook replicate patterns of offline friendships, at least in terms of
transitivity. However, the magnitude of transitivity in the Facebook social
graph is partially driven by algorithmic confounding. That is, data scientists
at Facebook knew of the empirical and theoretical research about transitivity
and then baked it into how Facebook works. Facebook has a “People You
May Know” feature that suggests new friends, and one way that Facebook
decides who to suggest to you is transitivity. That is, Facebook is more
likely to suggest that you become friends with the friends of your friends.
This feature thus has the effect of increasing transitivity in the Facebook
social graph; in other words, the theory of transitivity brings the world
into line with the predictions of the theory (Zignani et al. 2014; Healy
2015). Thus, when big data sources appear to reproduce predictions of social
theory, we must be sure that the theory itself was not baked into how the
system worked.
Rather than thinking of big data sources as observing people in a natural
setting, a more apt metaphor is observing people in a casino. Casinos are
highly engineered environments designed to induce certain behaviors, and a
researcher would never expect behavior in a casino to provide an unfettered
window into human behavior. Of course, you could learn something about
human behavior by studying people in casinos, but if you ignored the fact that
the data was being created in a casino, you might draw some bad conclusions.
Unfortunately, dealing with algorithmic confounding is particularly dif-
ficult because many features of online systems are proprietary, poorly
documented, and constantly changing. For example, as I’ll explain later in
this chapter, algorithmic confounding was one possible explanation for the
gradual breakdown of Google Flu Trends (section 2.4.2), but this claim was
hard to assess because the inner workings of Google’s search algorithm are
proprietary. The dynamic nature of algorithmic confounding is one form
of system drift. Algorithmic confounding means that we should be cautious
36
CHAPTER 2

about any claim regarding human behavior that comes from a single digital
system, no matter how big.
2.3.9 Dirty
Big data sources can be loaded with junk and spam.
Some researchers believe that big data sources, especially online sources, are
pristine because they are collected automatically. In fact, people who have
worked with big data sources know that they are frequently dirty. That is,
they frequently include data that do not reflect real actions of interest to
researchers. Most social scientists are already familiar with the process of
cleaning large-scale social survey data, but cleaning big data sources seems
to be more difficult. I think the ultimate source of this difficulty is that many
of these big data sources were never intended to be used for research, and so
they are not collected, stored, and documented in a way that facilitates data
cleaning.
The dangers of dirty digital trace data are illustrated by Back and col-
leagues’ (2010) study of the emotional response to the attacks of September
11, 2001, which I briefly mentioned earlier in the chapter. Researchers
typically study the response to tragic events using retrospective data collected
over months or even years. But, Back and colleagues found an always-on
source of digital traces—the timestamped, automatically recorded messages
from 85,000 American pagers—and this enabled them to study emotional
response on a much finer timescale. They created a minute-by-minute emo-
tional timeline of September 11 by coding the emotional content of the pager
messages by the percentage of words related to (1) sadness (e.g., “crying” and
“grief”), (2) anxiety (e.g., “worried” and “fearful”), and (3) anger (e.g., “hate”
and “critical”). They found that sadness and anxiety fluctuated throughout
the day without a strong pattern, but that there was a striking increase in
anger throughout the day. This research seems to be a wonderful illustration
of the power of always-on data sources: if traditional data sources had been
used, it would have been impossible to obtain such a high-resolution timeline
of the immediate response to an unexpected event.
Just one year later, however, Cynthia Pury (2011) looked at the data
more carefully. She discovered that a large number of the supposedly angry
messages were generated by a single pager and they were all identical. Here’s

American pagers (Back, Küfner, and Egloff 2010; Pury 2011; Back, Küfner, and Egloff 2011).
Originally, Back, Küfner, and Egloff (2010) reported a pattern of increasing anger throughout
the day. However, most of these apparently angry messages were generated by a single pager
that repeatedly sent out the following message: “Reboot NT machine [name] in cabinet [name]
at [location]:CRITICAL:[date and time]”. With this message removed, the apparent increase
in anger disappears (Pury 2011; Back, Küfner, and Egloff 2011). Adapted from Pury (2011),
figure 1b.
what those supposedly angry messages said:
“Reboot NT machine [name] in cabinet [name] at [location]: CRITI-
CAL:[date and time]”
These messages were labeled angry because they included the word
“CRITICAL,” which may generally indicate anger but in this case does
not. Removing the messages generated by this single automated pager
completely eliminates the apparent increase in anger over the course of the
day (figure 2.4). In other words, the main result in Back, Küfner, and Egloff
(2010) was an artifact of one pager. As this example illustrates, relatively
38
CHAPTER 2

simple analysis of relatively complex and messy data has the potential to go
seriously wrong.
While dirty data that is created unintentionally—such as that from one
noisy pager—can be detected by a reasonably careful researcher, there are
also some online systems that attract intentional spammers. These spammers
actively generate fake data, and—often motivated by profit—work very hard
to keep their spamming concealed. For example, political activity on Twitter
seems to include at least some reasonably sophisticated spam, whereby some
political causes are intentionally made to look more popular than they
actually are (Ratkiewicz et al. 2011). Unfortunately, removing this intentional
spam can be quite difficult.
Of course what is considered dirty data can depend, in part, on the
research question. For example, many edits to Wikipedia are created by au-
tomated bots (Geiger 2014). If you are interested in the ecology of Wikipedia,
then these bot-created edits are important. But if you are interested in
how humans contribute to Wikipedia, then the bot-created edits should be
excluded.
There is no single statistical technique or approach that can ensure that
you have sufficiently cleaned your dirty data. In the end, I think the best way
to avoid being fooled by dirty data is to understand as much as possible about
how your data were created.
2.3.10 Sensitive
Some of the information that companies and governments have
is sensitive.
Health insurance companies have detailed information about the medical
care received by their customers. This information could be used for im-
portant research about health, but if it became public, it could potentially
lead to emotional harm (e.g., embarrassment) or economic harm (e.g., loss
of employment). Many other big data sources also have information that is
sensitive, which is part of the reason why they are often inaccessible.
Unfortunately, it turns out to be quite tricky to decide what information
is actually sensitive (Ohm, 2015), as was illustrated by the Netflix Prize.
As I will describe in chapter 5, in 2006, Netflix released 100 million movie
ratings provided by almost 500,000 members and had an open call where
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
39

people from all over the world submitted algorithms that could improve
Netflix’s ability to recommend movies. Before releasing the data, Netflix
removed any obvious personally identifying information, such as names.
But, just two weeks after the data was released Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly
Shmatikov (2008) showed that it was possible to learn about specific people’s
movie ratings using a trick that I’ll show you in chapter 6. Even though an
attacker could discover a person’s movie ratings, there still doesn’t seem to be
anything sensitive here. While that might be true in general, for at least some
of the 500,000 people in the dataset, movie ratings were sensitive. In fact,
in response to the release and re-identification of the data, a closeted lesbian
woman joined a class-action suit against Netflix. Here’s how the problem was
expressed in this lawsuit (Singel 2009):
“[M]ovie and rating data contains information of a ... highly personal
and sensitive nature. The member’s movie data exposes a Netflix mem-
ber’s personal interest and/or struggles with various highly personal is-
sues, including sexuality, mental illness, recovery from alcoholism, and
victimization from incest, physical abuse, domestic violence, adultery,
and rape.”
This example shows that there can be information that some people
consider sensitive inside of what might appear to be a benign database.
Further, it shows that a main defense that researchers employ to protect
sensitive data—de-identification—can fail in surprising ways. These two
ideas are developed in greater detail in chapter 6.
The final thing to keep in mind about sensitive data is that collecting it
without people’s consent raises ethical questions, even if no specific harm is
caused. Much like watching someone taking a shower without their consent
might be considered a violation of that person’s privacy, collecting sensitive
information—and remember how hard it can be to decide what is sensitive—
without consent creates potential privacy concerns. I’ll return to questions
about privacy in chapter 6.
In conclusion, big data sources, such as government and business admin-
istrative records, are generally not created for the purpose of social research.
The big data sources of today, and likely tomorrow, tend to have 10 charac-
teristics. Many of the properties that are generally considered to be good for
research—big, always-on, and nonreactive—come from the fact in the digital
40
CHAPTER 2

age companies and governments are able to collect data at a scale that was not
possible previously. And many of the properties that are generally considered
to be bad for research—incomplete, inaccessible, nonrepresentative, drifting,
algorithmically confounded, inaccessible, dirty, and sensitive—come from
the fact that these data were not collected by researchers for researchers.
So far, I’ve talked about government and business data together, but there
are some differences between the two. In my experience, government data
tends to be less nonrepresentative, less algorithmically confounded, and less
drifting. One the other hand, business administrative records tend to be more
always-on. Understanding these 10 general characteristics is a helpful first
step toward learning from big data sources. And now we turn to research
strategies we can use with this data.
2.4
Research strategies
Given these 10 characteristics of big data sources and the inherent limitations
of even perfectly observed data, I see three main strategies for learning from
big data sources: counting things, forecasting things, and approximating
experiments. I’ll describe each of these approaches—which could be called
“research strategies” or “research recipes”—and I’ll illustrate them with
examples. These strategies are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive.
2.4.1 Counting things
Simple counting can be interesting if you combine a good question
with good data.
Although it is couched in sophisticated-sounding language, lots of social
research is really just counting things. In the age of big data, researchers
can count more than ever, but that does not mean that they should just
start counting haphazardly. Instead, researchers should ask: What things are
worth counting? This may seem like an entirely subjective matter, but there
are some general patterns.
Often students motivate their counting research by saying: I’m going to
count something that no-one has ever counted before. For example, a student
might say that many people have studied migrants and many people have
studied twins, but nobody has studied migrant twins. In my experience, this
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
41

strategy, which I call motivation by absence, does not usually lead to good
research.
Instead of motivating by absence, I think a better strategy is to look
for research questions that are important or interesting (or ideally both).
Both of these terms a bit hard to define, but one way to think about
important research is that it has some measurable impact or feeds into an
important decision by policy makers. For example, measuring the rate of
unemployment is important because it is an indicator of the economy that
drives policy decisions. Generally, I think that researchers have a pretty
good sense of what is important. So, in the rest of this section, I’m going
to provide two examples where I think counting is interesting. In each case,
the researchers were not counting haphazardly; rather, they were counting
in very particular settings that revealed important insights into more general
ideas about how social systems work. In other words, a lot of what makes
these particular counting exercises interesting is not the data itself, it comes
from these more general ideas.
One example of the simple power of counting comes from Henry Farber’s
(2015) study of the behavior of New York City taxi drivers. Although this
group might not sound inherently interesting, it is a strategic research site
for testing two competing theories in labor economics. For the purposes
of Farber’s research, there are two important features about the work en-
vironment of taxi drivers: (1) their hourly wage fluctuates from day to day,
based in part on factors like the weather, and (2) the number of hours they
work can fluctuate each day based on their decisions. These features lead
to an interesting question about the relationship between hourly wages and
hours worked. Neoclassical models in economics predict that taxi drivers
will work more on days where they have higher hourly wages. Alternatively,
models from behavioral economics predict exactly the opposite. If drivers
set a particular income target—say $100 per day—and work until that target
is met, then drivers will end up working fewer hours on days that they are
earning more. For example, if you were a target earner, you might end up
working four hours on a good day ($25 per hour) and five hours on a bad day
($20 per hour). So, do drivers work more hours on days with higher hourly
wages (as predicted by the neoclassical models) or more hours on days with
lower hourly wages (as predicted by behavioral economic models)?
To answer this question, Farber obtained data on every taxi trip taken by
New York City cabs from 2009 to 2013, data that are now publicly available.
42
CHAPTER 2

These data—which were collected by electronic meters that the city requires
taxis to use—include information about each trip: start time, start location,
end time, end location, fare, and tip (if the tip was paid with a credit card).
Using this taxi meter data, Farber found that most drivers work more on days
when wages are higher, consistent with the neoclassical theory.
In addition to this main finding, Farber was able to use the size of the data
for a better understanding of heterogeneity and dynamics. He found that,
over time, newer drivers gradually learn to work more hours on high-wage
days (e.g., they learn to behave as the neoclassical model predicts). And new
drivers who behave more like target earners are more likely to quit being taxi
drivers. Both of these more subtle findings, which help explain the observed
behavior of current drivers, were only possible because of the size of the
dataset. They were impossible to detect in earlier studies that used paper
trip sheets from a small number of taxi drivers over a short period of time
(Camerer et al. 1997).
Farber’s study was close to a best-case scenario for a study using a big
data source because the data that were collected by the city were pretty close
to the data that Farber would have collected (one difference is that Farber
would have wanted data on total wages—fares plus tips—but the city data
only included tips paid by credit card). However, the data alone were not
enough. The key to Farber’s research was bringing an interesting question
to the data, a question that has larger implications beyond just this specific
setting.
A second example of counting things comes from research by Gary
King, Jennifer Pan, and Molly Roberts (2013) on online censorship by the
Chinese government. In this case, however, the researchers had to collect
their own big data and they had to deal with the fact that their data was
incomplete.
King and colleagues were motivated by the fact that social media posts in
China are censored by an enormous state apparatus that is thought to include
tens of thousands of people. Researchers and citizens, however, have little
sense of how these censors decide what content should be deleted. Scholars
of China actually have conflicting expectations about which kinds of posts
are most likely to get deleted. Some think that censors focus on posts that are
critical of the state, while others think that they focus on posts that encourage
collective behavior, such as protests. Figuring out which of these expectations
is correct has implications for how researchers understand China and other
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
43

authoritarian governments that engage in censorship. Therefore, King and
colleagues wanted to compare posts that were published and subsequently
deleted with posts that were published and never deleted.
Collecting these posts involved the amazing engineering feat of crawl-
ing more than 1,000 Chinese social media websites—each with different
page layouts—finding relevant posts, and then revisiting these posts to see
which were subsequently deleted. In addition to the normal engineering
problems associated with large scale web-crawling, this project had the
added challenge that it needed to be extremely fast because many censored
posts are taken down in less than 24 hours. In other words, a slow crawler
would miss lots of posts that were censored. Further, the crawlers had to
do all this data collection while evading detection lest the social media
websites block access or otherwise change their policies in response to
the study.
By the time that this massive engineering task had been completed,
King and colleagues had obtained about 11 million posts on 85 different
prespecified topics, each with an assumed level of sensitivity. For example,
a topic of high sensitivity is Ai Weiwei, the dissident artist; a topic of middle
sensitivity is appreciation and devaluation of the Chinese currency; and a
topic of low sensitivity is the World Cup. Of these 11 million posts, about
2 million had been censored. Somewhat surprisingly, King and colleagues
found that posts on highly sensitive topics were censored only slightly more
often than posts on middle- and low-sensitivity topics. In other words,
Chinese censors are about as likely to censor a post that mentions Ai Weiwei
as a post that mentions the World Cup. These findings do not support the
idea that the government censors all posts on sensitive topics.
This simple calculation of censorship rate by topic could be misleading,
however. For example, the government might censor posts that are sup-
portive of Ai Weiwei, but leave posts that are critical of him. In order to
distinguish between posts more carefully, the researchers needed to measure
the sentiment of each post. Unfortunately, despite much work, fully auto-
mated methods of sentiment detection using pre-existing dictionaries are
still not very good in many situations (think back to the problems creating
an emotional timeline of September 11, 2001 described in section 2.3.9).
Therefore, King and colleagues needed a way to label their 11 million social
media posts as to whether they were (1) critical of the state, (2) supportive
of the state, or (3) irrelevant or factual reports about the events. This sounds

Figure 2.5: Simplified schematic of the procedure used by King, Pan, and Roberts (2013) to
estimate the sentiment of 11 million Chinese social media posts. First, in a preprocessing step,
they converted the social media posts into a document–term matrix (see Grimmer and Stewart
(2013) for more information). Second, they hand-coded the sentiment of a small sample of
posts. Third, they trained a supervised learning model to classify the sentiment of posts.
Fourth, they used the supervised learning model to estimate the sentiment of all the posts.
See King, Pan, and Roberts (2013), appendix B for a more detailed description.
like a massive job, but they solved it using a powerful trick that is common
in data science but relatively rare in social science: supervised learning; see
figure 2.5.
First, in a step typically called preprocessing, they converted the social
media posts into a document–term matrix, where there was one row for
each document and one column that recorded whether the post contained
a specific word (e.g., protest or traffic). Next, a group of research assistants
hand-labeled the sentiment of a sample of posts. Then, they used this
hand-labeled data to create a machine learning model that could infer the
sentiment of a post based on its characteristics. Finally, they used this model
to estimate the sentiments of all 11 million posts.
Thus, rather than manually reading and labeling 11 million posts—which
would be logistically impossible—King and colleagues manually labeled a
small number of posts and then used supervised learning to estimate the
sentiment of all the posts. After completing this analysis, they were able to
conclude that, somewhat surprisingly, the probability of a post being deleted
was unrelated to whether it was critical of the state or supportive of the state.
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
45

In the end, King and colleagues discovered that only three types of posts
were regularly censored: pornography, criticism of censors, and those that
had collective action potential (i.e., the possibility of leading to large-scale
protests). By observing a huge number of posts that were deleted and posts
that were not deleted, King and colleagues were able to learn how the censors
work just by watching and counting. Further, foreshadowing a theme that
will occur throughout this book, the supervised learning approach that they
used—hand-labeling some outcomes and then building a machine learning
model to label the rest—turns out to be very common in social research in
the digital age. You will see pictures very similar to figure 2.5 in chapters 3
(Asking questions) and 5 (Creating mass collaboration); this is one of the few
ideas that appears in multiple chapters.
These examples—the working behavior of taxi drivers in New York and
the social media censorship behavior of the Chinese government—show that
relatively simple counting of big data sources can, in some situations, lead to
interesting and important research. In both cases, however, the researchers
had to bring interesting questions to the big data source; the data by itself was
not enough.
2.4.2 Forecasting and nowcasting
Predicting the future is hard, but predicting the present is easier.
The second main strategy researchers can use with observational data is
forecasting. Making guesses about the future is notoriously difficult, and,
perhaps for that reason, forecasting is not currently a large part of so-
cial research (although it is a small and important part of demography,
economics, epidemiology, and political science). Here, however, I’d like to
focus on a special kind of forecasting called nowcasting—a term derived
from combining “now” and “forecasting.” Rather than predicting the future,
nowcasting attempts to use ideas from forecasting to measure the current
state of the world: it attempts to “predict the present” (Choi and Varian
2012). Nowcasting has the potential to be especially useful to governments
and companies that require timely and accurate measures of the world.
One setting where the need for timely and accurate measurement is
very clear is epidemiology. Consider the case of influenza (“the flu”). Each
year, seasonal influenza epidemics cause millions of illnesses and hundreds
46
CHAPTER 2

of thousands of deaths around the world. Further, each year, there is a
possibility that a novel form of influenza could emerge that would kill mil-
lions. The 1918 influenza outbreak, for example, is estimated to have killed
between 50 and 100 million people (Morens and Fauci 2007). Because of the
need to track and potentially respond to influenza outbreaks, governments
around the world have created influenza surveillance systems. For example,
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regularly and
systematically collect information from carefully selected doctors around the
country. Although this system produces high-quality data, it has a reporting
lag. That is, because of the time it takes for the data arriving from doctors
to be cleaned, processed, and published, the CDC system releases estimates
of how much flu there was two weeks ago. But, when handling an emerging
epidemic, public health officials don’t want to know how much influenza
there was two weeks ago; they want to know how much influenza there is
right now.
At the same time that the CDC is collecting data to track influenza,
Google is also collecting data about influenza prevalence, although in a
quite different form. People from around the world are constantly sending
queries to Google, and some of these queries—such as “flu remedies” and
“flu symptoms”—might indicate that the person making the query has the
flu. But, using these search queries to estimate flu prevalence is tricky: not
everyone who has the flu makes a flu-related search, and not every flu-related
search is from someone who has the flu.
Jeremy Ginsberg and a team of colleagues (2009), some at Google and
some at CDC, had the important and clever idea to combine these two
data sources. Roughly, through a kind of statistical alchemy, the researchers
combined the fast and inaccurate search data with the slow and accurate
CDC data in order to produce fast and accurate measurements of influenza
prevalence. Another way to think about it is that they used the search data to
speed up the CDC data.
More specifically, using data from 2003 to 2007, Ginsberg and colleagues
estimated the relationship between the prevalence of influenza in the CDC
data and the search volume for 50 million distinct terms. From this process,
which was completely data-driven and did not require specialized medical
knowledge, the researchers found a set of 45 different queries that seemed
to be most predictive of the CDC flu prevalence data. Then, using the
relationships that they learned from the 2003–2007 data, Ginsberg and
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
47

colleagues tested their model during the 2007–2008 influenza season. They
found that their procedures could indeed make useful and accurate nowcasts
(figure 2.6). These results were published in Nature and received ador-
ing press coverage. This project—which was called Google Flu Trends—
became an often-repeated parable about the power of big data to change
the world.
However, this apparent success story eventually turned into an embar-
rassment. Over time, researchers discovered two important limitations that
make Google Flu Trends less impressive than it initially appeared. First, the
performance of Google Flu Trends was actually not much better than that of a
simple model that estimates the amount of flu based on a linear extrapolation
from the two most recent measurements of flu prevalence (Goel et al. 2010).
And, over some time periods, Google Flu Trends was actually worse than this
simple approach (Lazer et al. 2014). In other words, Google Flu Trends with
all its data, machine learning, and powerful computing did not dramatically
outperform a simple and easier-to-understand heuristic. This suggests that
when evaluating any forecast or nowcast, it is important to compare against
a baseline.
The second important caveat about Google Flu Trends is that its ability
to predict the CDC flu data was prone to short-term failure and long-term
decay because of drift and algorithmic confounding. For example, during the
2009 Swine Flu outbreak, Google Flu Trends dramatically overestimated the
amount of influenza, probably because people tend to change their search be-
havior in response to widespread fear of a global pandemic (Cook et al. 2011;
Olson et al. 2013). In addition to these short-term problems, the performance
of Google Flu Trends gradually decayed over time. Diagnosing the reasons
for this long-term decay are difficult because the Google search algorithms
are proprietary, but it appears that in 2011 Google began suggesting related
search terms when people search for flu symptoms like “fever” and “cough”
(it also seem that this feature is no longer active). Adding this feature is a
totally reasonable thing to do if you are running a search engine, but this
algorithmic change had the effect of generating more health-related searches,
which caused Google Flu Trends to overestimate flu prevalence (Lazer
et al. 2014).
These two caveats complicate future nowcasting efforts, but they do not
doom them. In fact, by using more careful methods, Lazer et al. (2014) and
Yang, Santillana, and Kou (2015) were able to avoid these two problems.

Figure 2.6: Jeremy Ginsberg and colleagues (2009) combined Google search data with CDC
data to create Google Flu Trends, which could nowcast the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI).
Results in this figure are for the mid-Atlantic region of the United States in the 2007–2008
influenza season. Although it was initially very promising, the performance of Google Flu
Trends decayed over time (Cook et al. 2011; Olson et al. 2013; Lazer et al. 2014). Adapted
from Ginsberg et al. (2009), figure 3.

Going forward, I expect that nowcasting studies that combine big data
sources with researcher-collected data will enable companies and govern-
ments to create more timely and more accurate estimates by essentially
speeding up any measurement that is made repeatedly over time with
some lag. Nowcasting projects such as Google Flu Trends also show what
can happen if big data sources are combined with more traditional data
that were created for the purposes of research. Thinking back to the art
analogy of chapter 1, nowcasting has the potential to combine Duchamp-
style readymades with Michelangelo-style custommades to provide decision
makers with more timely and more accurate measurements of the present
and predictions of the near future.
2.4.3 Approximating experiments
We can approximate experiments that we can’t do. Two approaches
that especially beneﬁt from the digital age are natural experiments
and matching.
Some important scientific and policy questions are causal. For example, what
is the effect of a job training program on wages? A researcher attempting to
answer this question might compare the earnings of people who signed up
for training with those that didn’t. But how much of any difference in wages
between these groups is because of the training and how much is because
of preexisting differences between the people that sign up and those that
don’t? This is a difficult question, and it is one that doesn’t automatically go
away with more data. In other words, the concern about possible preexisting
differences arises no matter how many workers are in your data.
In many situations, the strongest way to estimate the causal effect of
some treatment, such as job training, is to run a randomized controlled
experiment where a researcher randomly delivers the treatment to some
people and not others. I’ll devote all of chapter 4 to experiments, so here
I’m going to focus on two strategies that can be used with non-experimental
data. The first strategy depends on looking for something happening in the
world that randomly (or nearly randomly) assigns the treatment to some
people and not others. The second strategy depends on statistically adjusting
non-experimental data in an attempt to account for preexisting differences
between those who did and did not receive the treatment.
50
CHAPTER 2

A skeptic might claim that both of these strategies should be avoided
because they require strong assumptions, assumptions that are difficult to
assess and that, in practice, are often violated. While I am sympathetic
to this claim, I think it goes a bit too far. It is certainly true that it is
difficult to reliably make causal estimates from non-experimental data, but
I don’t think that means that we should never try. In particular, non-
experimental approaches can be helpful if logistical constraints prevent you
from conducting an experiment or if ethical constraints mean that you do
not want to run an experiment. Further, non-experimental approaches can
be helpful if you want to take advantage of data that already exist in order to
design a randomized controlled experiment.
Before proceeding, it is also worth noting that making causal estimates
is one of the most complex topics in social research, and one that can
lead to intense and emotional debate. In what follows, I will provide an
optimistic description of each approach in order to build intuition about
it, then I will describe some of the challenges that arise when using that
approach. Further details about each approach are available in the materials
at the end of this chapter. If you plan to use either of these approaches in
your own research, I highly recommend reading one of the many excellent
books on causal inference (Imbens and Rubin 2015; Pearl 2009; Morgan and
Winship 2014).
One approach to making causal estimates from non-experimental data is
to look for an event that has randomly assigned a treatment to some people
and not to others. These situations are called natural experiments. One of the
clearest examples of a natural experiment comes from the research of Joshua
Angrist (1990) measuring the effect of military service on earnings. During
the war in Vietnam, the United States increased the size of its armed forces
through a draft. In order to decide which citizens would be called into service,
the US government held a lottery. Every birth date was written on a piece of
paper, and, as shown in figure 2.7, these pieces of paper were selected one at a
time in order to determine the order in which young men would be called to
serve (young women were not subject to the draft). Based on the results, men
born on September 14 were called first, men born on April 24 were called
second, and so on. Ultimately, in this lottery, men born on 195 different days
were drafted, while men born on 171 days were not.
Although it might not be immediately apparent, a draft lottery has a
critical similarity to a randomized controlled experiment: in both situations,

Figure 2.7: Congressman Alexander Pirnie (R-NY) drawing the first capsule for the Selective
Service draft on December 1, 1969. Joshua Angrist (1990) combined the draft lottery with
earnings data from the Social Security Administration to estimate the effect of military service
on earnings. This is an example of research using a natural experiment. (Source: U.S. Selective
Service System (1969)/Wikimedia Commons).
participants are randomly assigned to receive a treatment. In order to study
the effect of this randomized treatment, Angrist took advantage of an always-
on big data system: the US Social Security Administration, which collects
information on virtually every American’s earnings from employment. By
combining the information about who was randomly selected in the draft
lottery with the earnings data that were collected in governmental adminis-
trative records, Angrist concluded that the earnings of veterans were about
15% less than the earnings of comparable non-veterans.
As this example illustrates, sometimes social, political, or natural forces
create experiments that can be leveraged by researchers, and sometimes the
effects of those experiments are captured in always-on big data sources. This
research strategy can be summarized as follows:
random (or as if random) variation + always-on data = natural experiment
To illustrate this strategy in the digital age, let’s consider a study by
Alexandre Mas and Enrico Moretti (2009) that tried to estimate the effect of
working with productive colleagues on a worker’s productivity. Before seeing
the results, it is worth pointing out that there are conflicting expectations
that you might have. On the one hand, you might expect that working
with productive colleagues would lead a worker to increase her productivity
because of peer pressure. Or, on the other hand, you might expect that having
52
CHAPTER 2

hard-working peers might lead a worker to slack off because the work will
be done by her peers anyway. The clearest way to study peer effects on
productivity would be a randomized controlled experiment where workers
are randomly assigned to shifts with workers of different productivity levels
and then the resulting productivity is measured for everyone. Researchers,
however, do not control the schedule of workers in any real business, and so
Mas and Moretti had to rely on a natural experiment involving cashiers at a
supermarket.
In this particular supermarket, because of the way that scheduling was
done and the way that shifts overlapped, each cashier had different co-
workers at different times of day. Further, in this particular supermarket,
the assignment of cashiers was unrelated to the productivity of their peers
or how busy the store was. In other words, even though the scheduling
of cashiers was not determined by a lottery, it was as if workers were
sometimes randomly assigned to work with high (or low) productivity
peers. Fortunately, this supermarket also had a digital-age checkout system
that tracked the items that each cashier was scanning at all times. From
this checkout log data, Mas and Moretti were able to create a precise,
individual, and always-on measure of productivity: the number of items
scanned per second. Combining these two things—the naturally occurring
variation in peer productivity and the always-on measure of productivity—
Mas and Moretti estimated that if a cashier was assigned co-workers who
were 10% more productive than average, her productivity would increase
by 1.5%. Further, they used the size and richness of their dataset to explore
two important issues: the heterogeneity of this effect (For which kinds
of workers is the effect larger?) and the mechanisms behind the effect
(Why does having high-productivity peers lead to higher productivity?).
We will return to these two important issues—heterogeneity of treat-
ment effects and mechanisms—in chapter 4 when we discuss experiments
in more detail.
Generalizing from these two studies, table 2.3 summarizes other studies
that have this same structure: using an always-on data source to measure the
effect of some random variation. In practice, researchers use two different
strategies for finding natural experiments, both of which can be fruitful.
Some researchers start with an always-on data source and look for random
events in the world; others start with a random event in the world and look
for data sources that capture its impact.

In the discussion so far about natural experiments, I’ve left out an im-
portant point: going from what nature has provided to what you want can
sometimes be quite tricky. Let’s return to the Vietnam draft example. In
this case, Angrist was interested in estimating the effect of military service
on earnings. Unfortunately, military service was not randomly assigned;
rather, it was being drafted that was randomly assigned. However, not
everyone who was drafted served (there were a variety of exemptions), and
not everyone who served was drafted (people could volunteer to serve).
Because being drafted was randomly assigned, a researcher can estimate the
effect of being drafted for all men in the draft. But Angrist didn’t want to
know the effect of being drafted; he wanted to know the effect of serving
54
CHAPTER 2

in the military. To make this estimate, however, additional assumptions
and complications are required. First, researchers need to assume that the
only way that being drafted impacted earnings is through military service,
an assumption called the exclusion restriction. This assumption could be
wrong if, for example, men who were drafted stayed in school longer in
order to avoid serving or if employers were less likely to hire men who were
drafted. In general, the exclusion restriction is a critical assumption, and it
is usually hard to verify. Even if the exclusion restriction is correct, it is still
impossible to estimate the effect of service on all men. Instead, it turns out
that researchers can only estimate the effect on a specific subset of men called
compliers (men who would serve when drafted, but would not serve when
not drafted) (Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin 1996). Compliers, however, were
not the original population of interest. Notice that these problems arise even
in the relatively clean case of the draft lottery. A further set of complications
arise when the treatment is not assigned by a physical lottery. For example,
in Mas and Moretti’s study of cashiers, additional questions arise about
the assumption that the assignment of peers is essentially random. If this
assumption were strongly violated, it could bias their estimates. To conclude,
natural experiments can be a powerful strategy for making causal estimates
from non-experimental data, and big data sources increase our ability to
capitalize on natural experiments when they occur. However, it will probably
require great care—and sometimes strong assumptions—to go from what
nature has provided to the estimate that you want.
The second strategy I’d like to tell you about for making causal
estimates from non-experimental data depends on statistically adjusting
non-experimental data in an attempt to account for preexisting differences
between those who did and did not receive the treatment. There are many
such adjustment approaches, but I’ll focus on one called matching. In
matching, the researcher looks through non-experimental data to create pairs
of people who are similar except that one has received the treatment and one
has not. In the process of matching, researchers are actually also pruning,
that is, discarding cases where there is no obvious match. Thus, this method
would be more accurately called matching-and-pruning, but I’ll stick with
the traditional term: matching.
One example of the power of matching strategies with massive non-
experimental data sources comes from research on consumer behavior by
Liran Einav and colleagues (2015). They were interested in auctions taking
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
55

place on eBay, and in describing their work, I’ll focus on the effect of auction
starting price on auction outcomes, such as the sale price or the probability
of a sale.
The most naive way to estimate the effect of starting price on sale price
would be to simply calculate the final price for auctions with different starting
prices. This approach would be fine if you wanted to predict the sale price
given the starting price. But if your question concerns the effect of the starting
price, then this approach will not work, because it is not based on a fair
comparison: auctions with lower starting prices might be quite different from
those with higher starting prices (e.g., they might be for different types of
goods or include different types of sellers).
If you are already aware of the problems that can arise when making
causal estimates from non-experimental data, you might skip the naive
approach and consider running a field experiment where you would sell
a specific item—say, a golf club—with a fixed set of auction parameters—
say, free shipping and auction open for two weeks—but with randomly
assigned starting prices. By comparing the resulting market outcomes, this
field experiment would offer a very clear measurement of the effect of starting
price on sale price. But this measurement would only apply to one particular
product and set of auction parameters. The results might be different, for
example, for different types of products. Without a strong theory, it is
difficult to extrapolate from this single experiment to the full range of
possible experiments that could have been run. Further, field experiments
are sufficiently expensive that it would be infeasible to run every variation
that you might want to try.
In contrast to the naive and the experimental approaches, Einav and
colleagues took a third approach: matching. The main trick in their strategy
is to discover things similar to field experiments that have already happened
on eBay. For example, figure 2.8 shows some of the 31 listings for exactly the
same golf club—a Taylormade Burner 09 Driver—being sold by exactly the
same seller—“budgetgolfer.” However, these 31 listings have slightly different
characteristics, such as different starting prices, end dates, and shipping fees.
In other words, it is as if “budgetgolfer” is running experiments for the
researchers.
These listings of the Taylormade Burner 09 Driver being sold by “bud-
getgolfer” are one example of a matched set of listings, where the exact
same item is being sold by the exact same seller, but each time with slightly

CHAPTER 2

Figure 2.8: An example of a matched set. This is the exact same golf club (a Taylormade
Burner 09 Driver) being sold by the exact same person (“budgetgolfer”), but some of these

different characteristics. Within the massive logs of eBay there are literally
hundreds of thousands of matched sets involving millions of listings. Thus,
rather than comparing the final price for all auctions with a given starting
price, Einav and colleagues compared within matched sets. In order to
combine results from the comparisons within these hundreds of thousands of
matched sets, Einav and colleagues re-expressed the starting price and final
price in terms of the reference value of each item (e.g., its average sale price).
For example, if the Taylormade Burner 09 Driver had a reference value of
$100 (based on its sales), then a starting price of $10 would be expressed as
0.1 and a final price of $120 as 1.2.
Recall that Einav and colleagues were interested in the effect of start
price on auction outcomes. First, they used linear regression to estimate

Figure 2.9: Relationship between auction starting price and probability of a sale (a) and sale

sale, but a nonlinear relationship between starting price and sale price; for starting prices

that higher starting prices decrease the probability of a sale, and that higher
starting prices increase the final sale price (conditional on a sale occurring).
By themselves, these estimates—which describe a linear relationship and
are averaged over all products—are not all that interesting. Then, Einav
and colleagues used the massive size of their data to create a variety of
more subtle estimates. For example, by estimating the effect separately for
a variety of different starting prices, they found that the relationship between
starting price and sale price is nonlinear (figure 2.9). In particular, for starting
prices between 0.05 and 0.85, the starting price has very little impact on sale
price, a finding that was completely missed by their first analysis. Further,
rather than averaging over all items, Einav and colleagues estimated the
impact of starting price for 23 different categories of items (e.g., pet supplies,
electronics, and sports memorabilia) (figure 2.10). These estimates show
that for more distinctive items—such as memorabilia—starting price has a
smaller effect on the probability of a sale and a larger effect on the final sale
price. Further, for more commodified items—such as DVDs—the starting
price has almost no impact on the final price. In other words, an average
that combines results from 23 different categories of items hides important
differences between these items.

Even if you are not particularly interested in auctions on eBay, you have to
admire the way that figures 2.9 and 2.10 offer a richer understanding of eBay
than simple estimates that describe a linear relationship and combine many
different categories of items. Further, although it would be scientifically
possible to generate these estimates with field experiments, the cost would
make such experiments essentially impossible.
As with natural experiments, there are a number of ways that matching
can lead to bad estimates. I think the biggest concern with matching estimates
is that they can be biased by things that were not used in the matching. For
example, in their main results, Einav and colleagues did exact matching on
four characteristics: seller ID number, item category, item title, and subtitle.
If the items were different in ways that were not used for matching, then this
could create an unfair comparison. For example, if “budgetgolfer” lowered

prices for the Taylormade Burner 09 Driver in the winter (when golf clubs
are less popular), then it could appear that lower starting prices lead to lower
final prices, when in fact this would be an artifact of seasonal variation in
demand. One approach to addressing this concern is trying many different
kinds of matching. For example, Einav and colleagues repeated their analysis
while varying the time window used for matching (matched sets included
items on sale within one year, within one month, and contemporaneously).
Fortunately, they found similar results for all time windows. A further
concern with matching arises from interpretation. Estimates from matching
apply only to matched data: they do not apply to the cases that could
not be matched. For example, by limiting their research to items that had
multiple listings, Einav and colleagues are focusing on professional and
semiprofessional sellers. Thus, when interpreting these comparisons we must
remember that they only apply to this subset of eBay.
Matching is a powerful strategy for finding fair comparisons in non-
experimental data. To many social scientists, matching feels second-best to
experiments, but that is a belief that can be revised, slightly. Matching in
massive data might be better than a small number of field experiments when
(1) heterogeneity in effects is important and (2) the important variables
needed for matching have been measured. Table 2.4 provides some other
examples of how matching can be used with big data sources.
In conclusion, estimating causal effects from non-experimental data is
difficult, but approaches such as natural experiments and statistical adjust-
ments (e.g., matching) can be used. In some situations, these approaches
can go badly wrong, but when deployed carefully, these approaches can be a
useful complement to the experimental approach that I describe in chapter 4.
60
CHAPTER 2

Further, these two approaches seem especially likely to benefit from the
growth of always-on, big data systems.
2.5
Conclusion
Big data sources are everywhere, but using them for social research can be
tricky. In my experience, there is something like a “no free lunch” rule for
data: if you don’t put in a lot of work collecting it, then you are probably
going to have to put in a lot of work think about it and analyzing it.
The big data sources of today—and likely tomorrow—will tend to have
10 characteristics. Three of these are generally (but not always) helpful for
research: big, always-on, and nonreactive. Seven are generally (but not al-
ways) problematic for research: incomplete, inaccessible, nonrepresentative,
drifting, algorithmically confounded, dirty, and sensitive. Many of these
characteristics ultimately arise because big data sources were not created for
the purpose of social research.
Based on the ideas in this chapter, I think that there are three main ways
that big data sources will be most valuable for social research. First, they
can enable researchers to decide between competing theoretical predictions.
Examples of this kind of work include Farber (2015) (New York Taxi drivers)
and King, Pan, and Roberts (2013) (censorship in China). Second, big data
sources can enable improved measurement for policy through nowcasting.
An example of this kind of work is Ginsberg et al. (2009) (Google Flu
Trends). Finally, big data sources can help researchers make causal estimates
without running experiments. Examples of this kind of work are Mas and
Moretti (2009) (peer effects on productivity) and Einav et al. (2015) (effect
of starting price on auctions at eBay). Each of these approaches, however,
tends to require researchers to bring a lot to the data, such as the definition
of a quantity that is important to estimate or two theories that make
competing predictions. Thus, I think the best way to think about what big
data sources can do is that they can help researchers who can ask interesting
and important questions.
Before concluding, I think that it is worth considering that big data
sources may have an important effect on the relationship between data and
theory. So far, this chapter has taken the approach of theory-driven empirical
research. But big data sources also enable researchers to do empirically driven
theorizing. That is, through the careful accumulation of empirical facts,
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
61

patterns, and puzzles, researchers can build new theories. This alternative,
data-first approach to theory is not new, and it was most forcefully articulated
by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss (1967) with their call for grounded
theory. This data-first approach, however, does not imply “the end of theory,”
as has been claimed in some of the journalism around research in the digital
age (Anderson 2008). Rather, as the data environment changes, we should
expect a rebalancing in the relationship between data and theory. In a world
where data collection was expensive, it made sense to collect only the data
that theories suggest will be the most useful. But in a world where enormous
amounts of data are already available for free, it makes sense to also try a
data-first approach (Goldberg 2015).
As I have shown in this chapter, researchers can learn a lot by watching
people. In the next three chapters, I’ll describe how we can learn more and
different things if we tailor our data collection and interact with people
more directly by asking them questions (chapter 3), running experiments
(chapter 4), and even involving them in the research process directly
(chapter 5).
Mathematical notes
In this appendix, I will summarize some ideas about making causal inference
from non-experimental data in a slightly more mathematical form. There
are two main approaches: the causal graph framework, most associated with
Judea Pearl and colleagues, and the potential outcomes framework, most
associated with Donald Rubin and colleagues. I will introduce the potential
outcomes framework because it is more closely connected to the ideas in
the mathematical notes at the end of chapter 3 and 4. For more on the
causal graphs framework, I recommend Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell (2016)
(introductory) and Pearl (2009) (advanced). For a book-length treatment of
causal inference that combines the potential outcomes framework and the
causal graph framework, I recommend Morgan and Winship (2014).
The goal of this appendix is to help you get comfortable with the notation
and style of the potential outcomes tradition so that you can transition to
some of the more technical material written on this topic. First, I’ll describe
the potential outcomes framework. Then, I’ll use it to further discuss natural
experiments like the one by Angrist (1990) on the effect of military service
on earnings. This appendix draws heavily on Imbens and Rubin (2015).
62
CHAPTER 2

Potential outcomes framework
The potential outcomes framework has three main elements: units, treat-
ments, and potential outcomes. In order to illustrate these elements, let’s
consider a stylized version of the question addressed in Angrist (1990): What
is the effect of military service on earnings? In this case, we can define
the units to be people eligible for the 1970 draft in the United States, and
we can index these people by i = 1, . . . , N. The treatments in this case can
be “serving in the military” or “not serving in the military.” I’ll call these
the treatment and control conditions, I’ll write Wi = 1 if person i is in the
treatment condition and Wi = 0 if person i is in the control condition.
Finally, the potential outcomes are bit more conceptually difficult because
they involve “potential” outcomes; things that could have happened. For each
person eligible for the 1970 draft, we can imagine the amount that they would
have earned in 1978 if they served in the military, which I will call Yi(1), and
the amount that they would have earned in 1978 if they did not serve in the
military, which I will call Yi(0). In the potential outcomes framework, Yi(1)
and Yi(0) are considered fixed quantities, while Wi is a random variable.
The choice of units, treatments, and outcomes is critical because it defines
what can—and cannot—be learned from the study. The choice of units—
people eligible for the 1970 draft—does not include women, and so, without
additional assumptions, this study will not tell us anything about the effect
of military service on women. Decisions about how to define treatments and
outcomes are important as well. For example, should the study be focused
on serving in the military or experiencing combat? Should the outcome
of interest be earnings or job satisfaction? Ultimately, the choice of units,
treatments, and outcomes should be driven by the scientific and policy goals
of the study.
Given the choices of units, treatments, and potential outcomes, the causal
effect of the treatment on person i, τi, is
τi = Yi(1) −Yi(0)
(2.1)
In other words, we compare how much person i would have earned after
serving to how much person i would have earned without serving. To me,
eq. 2.1 is the clearest way to define a causal effect, and although extremely
simple, this framework turns out to generalizable in many important and
interesting ways (Imbens and Rubin 2015).

When using the potential outcomes framework, I often find it helpful to
write out a table showing the potential outcomes and the treatment effects
for all units (table 2.5). If you are not able to imagine a table like this for your
study, then you might need to be more precise in your definitions of your
units, treatments, and potential outcomes.
When defining the causal effect in this way, however, we run into a
problem. In almost all cases, we don’t get to observe both potential outcomes.
That is, a specific person either served or did not serve. Therefore, we observe
one of the potential outcomes—Yi(1) or Yi(0)—but not both. The inability to
observe both potential outcomes is such a major problem that Holland (1986)
called it the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.
Fortunately, when we are doing research, we don’t just have one person;
rather, we have many people, and this offers a way around the Fundamen-
tal Problem of Causal Inference. Rather than attempting to estimate the
individual-level treatment effect, we can estimate the average treatment effect
for all units:
ATE = ¯τ = 1
N

i=1

This equation is still expressed in terms of the τi, which are unobservable, but
with some algebra (eq. 2.8 of Gerber and Green (2012)), we get
ATE = 1
N

i=1

control (N−1 N
i=1 Yi(1)), then we can estimate the average treatment
effect, even without estimating the treatment effect for any particular
person.
Now that I’ve defined our estimand—the thing we are trying to estimate—
I’ll turn to how we can actually estimate it with data. And here we run directly
into the problem that we only observe one of the potential outcomes for
each person; we see either Yi(0) or Yi(1) (table 2.6). We could estimate the
average treatment effect by comparing the income of people that served to
the earnings of people that did not serve:



average earnings, control
(2.4)
where Nt and Nc are the numbers of people in the treatment and control
conditions. This approach will work well if the treatment assignment is
independent of potential outcomes, a condition sometimes called ignora-
bility. Unfortunately, in the absence of an experiment, ignorability is not
often satisfied, which means that the estimator in eq. 2.4 is not likely to
produce good estimate. One way to think about it is that in the absence
of random assignment of treatment, eq 2.4 is not comparing like with like:
it is comparing the earnings of different kinds of people. Or, expressed
slightly differently, without random assignment of treatment, the treatment
allocation is probably related to potential outcomes.
In chapter 4, I’ll describe how randomized controlled experiments can
help researchers make causal estimates, and here I’ll describe how researchers
can take advantage of natural experiments, such as the draft lottery.

Natural experiments
One approach to making causal estimates without running an experiment is
to look for something happening in the world that has randomly assigned
a treatment for you. This approach is called natural experiments. In many
situations, unfortunately, nature does not randomly deliver the treatment
that you want to the population of interest. But sometimes nature randomly
delivers a related treatment. In particular, I’ll consider the case where there
is some secondary treatment that encourages people to receive the primary
treatment. For example, the draft could be considered a randomly assigned
secondary treatment that encouraged some people to take the primary
treatment, which was serving in the military. This design is sometimes called
an encouragement design. And the analysis method that I’ll describe to handle
this situation is sometimes called instrumental variables. In this setting, with
some assumptions, researchers can use the encouragement to learn about the
effect of the primary treatment for a particular subset of units.
In order to handle the two different treatments—the encouragement and
the primary treatment—we need some new notation. Suppose that some
people are randomly drafted (Zi = 1) or not drafted (Zi = 0); in this
situation, Zi is sometimes called an instrument.
Among those who were drafted, some served (Zi = 1, Wi = 1) and some
did not (Zi = 1, Wi = 0). Likewise, among those that were not drafted,
some served (Zi = 0, Wi = 1) and some did not (Zi = 0, Wi = 0). The
potential outcomes for each person can now be expanded to show their status
for both the encouragement and the treatment. For example, let Y(1, Wi(1))
be the earnings of person i if he was drafted, where Wi(1) is his service status
if drafted. Further, we can split the population into four groups: compliers,
never-takers, defiers, and always-takers (table 2.7).
66
CHAPTER 2

Before we discuss estimating the effect of the treatment (i.e., military
service), we can define two effects of the encouragement (i.e., being drafted).
First, we can define the effect of the encouragement on the primary treat-
ment. Second, we can define the effect of the encouragement on the outcome.
It will turn out that these two effects can be combined to provide an estimate
of the effect of the treatment on a specific group of people.
First, the effect of the encouragement on treatment can be defined for
person i as
ITTW,i = Wi(1) −Wi(0)
(2.5)
Further, this quantity can be defined over the entire population as
ITTW = 1
N
N

i=1
[Wi(1) −Wi(0)]
(2.6)
Finally, we can estimate ITTW using data:

ITTW = ¯Wobs
1
−¯Wobs
0
(2.7)
where ¯Wobs
1
is the observed rate of treatment for those who were encouraged
and ¯Wobs
0
is the observed rate of treatment for those who were not encour-
aged. ITTW is also sometimes called the uptake rate.
Next, the effect of the encouragement on the outcome can be defined for
person i as
ITTY,i = Yi(1, Wi(1)) −Yi(0, Wi(0))
(2.8)
Further, this quantity can be defined over the entire population as
ITTY = 1
N
N

i=1
[Yi(1, Wi(1)) −Yi(0, Wi(0))]
(2.9)
Finally, we can estimate ITTY using data:

ITTY = ¯Yobs
1
−¯Yobs
0
(2.10)
where ¯Yobs
1
is the observed outcome (e.g., income) for those who were
encouraged (e.g., drafted) and ¯Yobs
0
is the observed outcome for those who
were not encouraged.
Finally, we turn our attention to the effect of interest: the effect of the
primary treatment (e.g., military service) on the outcome (e.g., earnings).
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
67

Unfortunately, it turns out that one cannot, in general, estimate the effect
of treatment on all units. However, with some assumptions, researchers can
estimate the effect of treatment on compliers (i.e., people who will serve if
drafted and people who will not serve if not drafted; table 2.7). I’ll call this
estimate the complier average causal effect (CACE) (which is also sometimes
called the local average treatment effect, LATE):
CACE =
1
Nco

i:Gi=co
[Y(1, Wi(1)) −Y(0, Wi(0))]
(2.11)
where Gi donates the group of person i (see table 2.7) and Nco is the number
of compliers. In other words, eq. 2.11 compares the earnings of compliers
who are drafted, Yi(1, Wi(1)), and not drafted, Yi(0, Wi(0)). The estimand in
eq. 2.11 seems hard to estimate from observed data because it is not possible
to identify compliers using only observed data (to know if someone is a
complier, you would need to observe whether he served when drafted and
whether he served when not drafted).
It turns out—somewhat surprisingly—that if there are any compliers,
then, provided one makes three additional assumptions, it is possible to
estimate CACE from observed data. First, one has to assume that the
assignment to treatment is random. In the case of the draft lottery, this is
reasonable. However, in some settings where natural experiments do not
rely on physical randomization, this assumption may be more problematic.
Second, one has to assume that their are no defiers (this assumption is
also sometimes called the monotonicity assumption). In the context of the
draft, it seems reasonable to assume that there are very few people who will
not serve if drafted and will serve if not drafted. Third, and finally, comes
the most important assumption, which is called the exclusion restriction.
Under the exclusion restriction, one has to assume that all of the effect of
the treatment assignment is passed through the treatment itself. In other
words, one has to assume that there is no direct effect of encouragement
on outcomes. In the case of the draft lottery, for example, one needs to
assume that draft status has no effect on earnings other than through
military service (figure 2.11). The exclusion restriction could be violated if,
for example, people who were drafted spent more time in school in order
to avoid service or if employers were less likely to hire people who were
drafted.

Figure 2.11: The exclusion restriction requires that the encouragement (draft lottery) has
an effect on the outcome (earnings) only through the treatment (military service). The
exclusion restriction could be violated if, for example, people who were drafted spent more
time in school in order to avoid service and that this increased time in school led to higher
earnings.
If these three conditions (random assignment to treatment, no defiers, and
the exclusion restriction) are met, then
CACE = ITTY
ITTW
(2.12)
so we can estimate CACE:

CACE =

ITTY

ITTW
(2.13)
One way to think about CACE is that it is the difference in outcomes
between those who were encouraged and those not encouraged, inflated by
the uptake rate.
There are two important caveats to keep in mind. First, the exclusion
restriction is a strong assumption, and it needs to be justified on a case-by-
case basis, which frequently requires subject-area expertise. The exclusion
restriction cannot be justified with randomization of the encouragement.
Second, a common practical challenge with instrumental variable analysis
comes when the encouragement has little effect on the uptake of treatment
(when ITTW is small). This is called a weak instrument, and it leads to
a variety of problems (Imbens and Rosenbaum 2005; Murray 2006). One
way to think about the problem with weak instruments is that 
CACE can
be sensitive to small biases in 
ITTY—potentially due to violations of the
exclusion restriction—because these biases get magnified by a small 

(see eq. 2.13). Roughly, if the treatment that nature assigns doesn’t have a big
impact on the treatment you care about, then you are going to have a hard
time learning about the treatment you care about.
See chapters 23 and 24 of Imbens and Rubin (2015) for a more for-
mal version of this discussion. The traditional econometric approach to
instrumental variables is typically expressed in terms of estimating equa-
tions, not potential outcomes. For an introduction from this other per-
spective, see Angrist and Pischke (2009), and for a comparison between
the two approaches, see section 24.6 of Imbens and Rubin (2015). An
alternative, slightly less formal presentation of the instrumental variables
approach is also provided in chapter 6 of Gerber and Green (2012). For
more on the exclusion restriction, see Jones (2015). Aronow and Carnegie
(2013) describe an additional set of assumptions that can be used to es-
timate ATE rather than CATE. For a more general introduction to nat-
ural experiments—one that goes beyond just the instrumental variables
approach to also include designs such as regression discontinuity—see
Dunning (2012).
What to read next
• Introduction (section 2.1)
One kind of observing that is not included in this chapter is ethnography. For
more on ethnography in digital spaces, see Boellstorff et al. (2012), and for more
on ethnography in mixed digital and physical spaces, see Lane (2016).
• Big data (section 2.2)
There is no single consensus definition of “big data,” but many definitions seem
to focus on the “3 Vs”: volume, variety, and velocity (e.g., Japec et al. (2015)). See
De Mauro et al. (2015) for a review of definitions.
My inclusion of government administrative data in the category of big
data is a bit unusual, although others have also made this case, including
Legewie (2015), Connelly et al. (2016), and Einav and Levin (2014). For more
about the value of government administrative data for research, see Card et al.
(2010), Administrative Data Taskforce (2012), and Grusky, Smeeding, and
Snipp (2015).
For a view of administrative research from inside the government statistical
system, particularly the US Census Bureau, see Jarmin and O’Hara (2016).
For a book-length treatment of the administrative records research at Statistics
Sweden, see Wallgren and Wallgren (2007).

CHAPTER 2

In the chapter, I briefly compared a traditional survey such as the General
Social Survey (GSS) with a social media data source such as Twitter. For a
thorough and careful comparison between traditional surveys and social media
data, see Schober et al. (2016).
• Common characteristics of big data (section 2.3)
These 10 characteristics of big data have been described in a variety of
different ways by a variety of different authors. Writing that influenced my
thinking on these issues includes Lazer et al. (2009), Groves (2011), Howison,
Wiggins, and Crowston (2011), boyd and Crawford (2012), Taylor (2013),
Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier (2013), Golder and Macy (2014), Ruths and
Pfeffer (2014), Tufekci (2014), Sampson and Small (2015), K. Lewis (2015b),
Lazer (2015), Horton and Tambe (2015), Japec et al. (2015), and Goldstone and
Lupyan (2016).
Throughout this chapter, I’ve used the term digital traces, which I think is
relatively neutral. Another popular term for digital traces is digital footprints
(Golder and Macy 2014), but, as Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis
(2008) point out, a more appropriate term is probably digital fingerprints. When
you create footprints, you are aware of what is happening and your footprints
cannot generally be traced to you personally. The same is not true for your digital
traces. In fact, you are leaving traces all the time, about which you have very
little knowledge. And although these traces don’t have your name on them, they
can often be linked back to you. In other words, they are more like fingerprints:
invisible and personally identifying.
• Big (section 2.3.1)
For more on why large datasets render statistical tests problematic, see Lin,
Lucas, and Shmueli (2013) and McFarland and McFarland (2015). These issues
should lead researchers to focus on practical significance rather than statistical
significance.
For more about how Raj Chetty and colleagues obtained access to the tax
records, see Mervis (2014).
Large datasets can also create computational problems that are generally
beyond the capabilities of a single computer. Therefore, researchers making
computations on large datasets often spread the work over many computers, a
process sometimes called parallel programming. For an introduction to parallel
programming, in particular a language called Hadoop, see Vo and Silvia (2016).
• Always-on (section 2.3.2)
When considering always-on data, it is important to consider whether you are
comparing the exact same people over time or whether you are comparing some
changing group of people; see, for example, Diaz et al. (2016).
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
71

• Nonreactive (section 2.3.3)
A classic book on nonreactive measures is Webb et al. (1966). The examples in
that book predate the digital age, but they are still illuminating. For examples of
people changing their behavior because of the presence of mass surveillance, see
Penney (2016) and Brayne (2014).
Reactivity is closely related to what researchers call demand effects (Orne
1962, Zizzo 2010) and the Hawthorne effect (Adair 1984; Levitt and List 2011).
• Incomplete (section 2.3.4)
For more on record linkage, see Dunn (1946) and Fellegi and Sunter (1969) (his-
torical) and Larsen and Winkler (2014) (modern). Similar approaches have also
been developed in computer science under names such as data deduplication, in-
stance identification, name matching, duplicate detection, and duplicate record
detection (Elmagarmid, Ipeirotis, and Verykios 2007). There are also privacy-
preserving approaches to record linkage that do not require the transmission of
personally identifying information (Schnell 2013). Facebook also has developed
a process to link their records to voting behavior; this was done to evaluate an
experiment that I’ll tell you about in chapter 4 (Bond et al. 2012; Jones et al.
2013).
For more on construct validity, see chapter 3 of Shadish, Cook, and Campbell
(2001).
• Inaccessible (section 2.3.5)
For more on the AOL search log debacle, see Ohm (2010). I offer advice
about partnering with companies and governments in chapter 4 when I de-
scribe experiments. A number of authors have expressed concerns about re-
search that relies on inaccessible data, see Huberman (2012) and boyd and
Crawford (2012).
One good way for university researchers to acquire data access is to work at a
company as an intern or visiting researcher. In addition to enabling data access,
this process will also help the researcher learn more about how the data was
created, which is important for analysis.
In terms of gaining access to government data, Mervis (2014) discusses how
Raj Chetty and colleagues obtained access to the tax records used in their
research on social mobility.
• Nonrepresentative (section 2.3.6)
For more on the history of “representativeness” as a concept, see Kruskal and
Mosteller (1979a,b,c, 1980).
My summaries of the work of Snow and the work of Doll and Hill were brief.
For more on Snow’s work on cholera, see Freedman (1991). For more on the
British Doctors Study see Doll et al. (2004) and Keating (2014).
72
CHAPTER 2

Many researchers will be surprised to learn that although Doll and Hill had
collected data from female doctors and from doctors under 35, they intentionally
did not use this data in their first analysis. As they argued: “Since lung cancer
is relatively rare in women and men under 35, useful figures are unlikely
to be obtained in these groups for some years to come. In this preliminary
report we have therefore confined our attention to men aged 35 and above.”
Rothman, Gallacher, and Hatch (2013), which has the provocative title “Why
representativeness should be avoided,” make a more general argument for the
value of intentionally creating nonrepresentative data.
Nonrepresentativeness is a major problem for researchers and governments
who wish to make statements about an entire population. This is less of a concern
for companies, which are typically focused on their users. For more on how
Statistics Netherlands considers the issue of nonrepresentativeness of business
big data, see Buelens et al. (2014).
For examples of researchers expressing concern about nonrepresentative
nature of big data sources, see boyd and Crawford (2012), Lewis (2015b), and
Hargittai (2015).
For a more detailed comparison of the goals of social surveys and epidemio-
logical research, see Keiding and Louis (2016).
For more on attempts to use Twitter to make out-of-sample generalizations
about voters, especially the case from the 2009 German election, see Jungherr
(2013, 2015). Subsequent to the work of Tumasjan et al. (2010), researchers
around the world have used fancier methods—such as using sentiment analysis
to distinguish between positive and negative mentions of the parties—in order
to improve the ability of Twitter data to predict a variety of different types of
elections (Gayo-Avello 2013; Jungherr 2015, chapter 7). Here’s how Huberty
(2015) summarized the results of these attempts to predict elections:
“All known forecasting methods based on social media have failed when
subjected to the demands of true forward-looking electoral forecasting.
These failures appear to be due to fundamental properties of social media,
rather than to methodological or algorithmic difficulties. In short, social
media do not, and probably never will, offer a stable, unbiased, representa-
tive picture of the electorate; and convenience samples of social media lack
sufficient data to fix these problems post hoc.”
In chapter 3, I’ll describe sampling and estimation in much greater detail.
Even if data is nonrepresentative, under certain conditions, it can be weighted to
produce good estimates.
• Drifting (section 2.3.7)
System drift is very hard to see from the outside. However, the MovieLens
project (discussed more in chapter 4) has been run for more than 15 years by
OBSERVING BEHAVIOR
73

an academic research group. Thus, they have been able to document and share
information about the way that the system has evolved over time and how this
might impact analysis (Harper and Konstan 2015).
A number of scholars have focused on drift in Twitter: Liu, Kliman-Silver,
and Mislove (2014) and Tufekci (2014).
One approach to dealing with population drift is to create a panel of users,
which allows researchers to study the same people over time; see Diaz et al.
(2016).
• Algorithmically confounded (section 2.3.8)
I first heard the term “algorithmically confounded” used by Jon Kleinberg in
a talk, but unfortunately I don’t remember when or where the talk was given.
The first time that I saw the term in print was in Anderson et al. (2015), which
is an interesting discussion of how the algorithms used by dating sites might
complicate researchers’ ability to use data from these websites to study social
preferences. This concern was raised by Lewis (2015a) in response to Anderson
et al. (2014).
In addition to Facebook, Twitter also recommends people for users to follow
based on the idea of triadic closure; see Su, Sharma, and Goel (2016). So the level
of triadic closure in Twitter is a combination of some human tendency toward
triadic closure and some algorithmic tendency to promote triadic closure.
For more on performativity—in particular the idea that some social science
theories are “engines not cameras” (i.e., they shape the world rather than just
describing it)—see Mackenzie (2008).
• Dirty (section 2.3.9)
Governmental statistical agencies call data cleaning statistical data editing.
De Waal, Puts, and Daas (2014) describe statistical data editing techniques
developed for survey data and examine the extent to which they are applicable
to big data sources, and Puts, Daas, and Waal (2015) present some of the same
ideas for a more general audience.
For an overview of social bots, see Ferrara et al. (2016). For some examples
of studies focused on finding spam in Twitter, see Clark et al. (2016) and Chu et
al. (2012). Finally, Subrahmanian et al. (2016) describe the results of the DARPA
Twitter Bot Challenge, a mass collaboration designed to compare approaches for
detecting bots on Twitter.
• Sensitive (section 2.3.10)
Ohm (2015) reviews earlier research on the idea of sensitive information and
offers a multi-factor test. The four factors he proposes are the magnitude of
harm, the probability of harm, the presence of a confidential relationship, and
whether the risk reflects majoritarian concerns.
74
CHAPTER 2

• Counting things (section 2.4.1)
Farber’s study of taxis in New York was based on an earlier study by Camerer
et al. (1997) that used three different convenience samples of paper trip sheets.
This earlier study found that drivers seemed to be target earners: they worked
less on days where their wages were higher.
In subsequent work, King and colleagues have further explored online
censorship in China (King, Pan, and Roberts 2014, 2016). For a related ap-
proach to measuring online censorship in China, see Bamman, O’Connor,
and Smith (2012). For more on statistical methods like the one used in King,
Pan, and Roberts (2013) to estimate the sentiment of the 11 million posts,
see Hopkins and King (2010). For more on supervised learning, see James et
al. (2013) (less technical) and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009) (more
technical).
• Forecasting and nowcasting (section 2.4.2)
Forecasting is a big part of industrial data science (Mayer-Schönberger and
Cukier 2013; Provost and Fawcett 2013). One type of forecasting that is com-
monly done by social researchers is demographic forecasting; see, for example,
Raftery et al. (2012).
Google Flu Trends was not the first project to use search data to nowcast
influenza prevalence. In fact, researchers in the United States (Polgreen et al.
2008; Ginsberg et al. 2009) and Sweden (Hulth, Rydevik, and Linde 2009) have
found that certain search terms (e.g., “flu”) predicted national public health
surveillance data before it was released. Subsequently many, many other projects
have tried to use digital trace data for disease surveillance detection; see Althouse
et al. (2015) for a review.
In addition to using digital trace data to predict health outcomes, there
has also been a huge amount of work using Twitter data to predict election
outcomes; for reviews, see Gayo-Avello (2011), Gayo-Avello (2013), Jungherr
(2015, chapter 7), and Huberty (2015). Nowcasting of economic indicators, such
as gross domestic product (GDP), is also common in central banks, see Ba´nbura
et al. (2013). Table 2.8 includes a few examples of studies that use some kind of
digital trace to predict some kind of event in the world.
Finally, Jon Kleinberg and colleagues (2015) have pointed out that forecasting
problems fall into two, subtly different categories and that social scientists have
tended to focus on one and ignore the other. Imagine one policy maker, I’ll call
her Anna, who is facing a drought and must decide whether to hire a shaman
to do a rain dance to increase the chance of rain. Another policy maker, I’ll call
her Betty, must decide whether to take an umbrella to work to avoid getting
wet on the way home. Both Anna and Betty can make a better decision if they
understand weather, but they need to know different things. Anna needs to
understand whether the rain dance causes rain. Betty, on the other hand, does

not need to understand anything about causality; she just needs an accurate
forecast. Social researchers often focus on the problems like the one faced by
Anna—which Kleinberg and colleagues call “rain dance–like” policy problems—
because they involve questions of causality. Questions like the one faced by
Betty—which Kleinberg and colleagues call “umbrella-like” policy problems—
can be quite important too, but have received much less attention from social
researchers.
• Approximating experiments (section 2.4.3)
The journal P.S. Political Science had a symposium on big data, causal inference,
and formal theory, and Clark and Golder (2015) summarize each contribution.
The journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
of America had a symposium on causal inference and big data, and Shiffrin
(2016) summarizes each contribution. For machine learning approaches that
attempt to automatically discover natural experiments inside of big data sources,
see Jensen et al. (2008) and Sharma, Hofman, and Watts (2015, 2016).
In terms of natural experiments, Dunning (2012) provides an introductory,
book-length treatment with many examples. For a skeptical view of natural
experiments, see Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000) (economics) or Sekhon and
Titiunik (2012) (political science). Deaton (2010) and Heckman and Urzúa
(2010) argue that focusing on natural experiments can lead researchers to
focus on estimating unimportant causal effects; Imbens (2010) counters these
arguments with a more optimistic view of the value of natural experiments.
When describing how a researcher could go from estimating the effect
of being drafted to the effect of serving, I was describing a technique called
76
CHAPTER 2

instrumental variables. Imbens and Rubin (2015), in their chapters 23 and 24,
provide an introduction and use the draft lottery as an example. The effect
of military service on compliers is sometimes called the complier average
causal effect (CACE) and sometimes the local average treatment effect (LATE).
Sovey and Green (2011), Angrist and Krueger (2001), and Bollen (2012) offer
reviews of the usage of instrumental variables in political science, economics,
and sociology, and Sovey and Green (2011) provides a “reader’s checklist” for
evaluating studies using instrumental variables.
It turns out that the 1970 draft lottery was not, in fact properly randomized;
there were small deviations from pure randomness (Fienberg 1971). Berinsky
and Chatfield (2015) argues that this small deviation is not substantively
important and discuss the importance of properly conducted randomization.
In terms of matching, see Stuart (2010) for an optimistic review and Sekhon
(2009) for a pessimistic one. For more on matching as a kind of pruning, see
Ho et al. (2007). Finding a single perfect match for each person is often difficult,
and this introduces a number of complexities. First, when exact matches are not
available for everyone, researchers need to decide how to measure the distance
between two units and if a given distance is close enough. A second complexity
arises if researchers want to use multiple matches for each case in the treatment
group, since this can lead to more precise estimates. Both of these issues, as well
as others, are described in detail in chapter 18 of Imbens and Rubin (2015). See
also Part II of Rosenbaum (2010).
See Dehajia and Wahba (1999) for an example where matching methods
were able to produce estimates similar to those from a randomized controlled
experiment. But see Arceneaux, Gerber, and Green (2006, 2010) for examples
where matching methods failed to reproduce an experimental benchmark.
Rosenbaum (2015) and Hernán and Robins (2016) offer other advice for
discovering useful comparisons within big data sources.

conducting sentiment analysis.
a) What are the three possible biases that you are most worried about in this

b) Clark et al. (2016) ran just such a study. First, they collected 850,000
tweets that used e-cigarette-related keywords from January 2012 through
December 2014. Upon closer inspection, they realized that many of these
tweets were automated (i.e., not produced by humans) and many of these
automated tweets were essentially commercials. They developed a human
detection algorithm to separate automated tweets from organic tweets.
Using this algorithm, they found that 80% of tweets were automated. Does
this finding change your answer to part (a)?

] In a widely discussed paper, Michel and colleagues (2011)
analyzed the content of more than five million digitized books in an attempt to
identify long-term cultural trends. The data that they used has now been released
as the Google NGrams dataset, and so we can use the data to replicate and extend
some of their work.
In one of the many results in the paper, Michel and colleagues argued that we
are forgetting faster and faster. For a particular year, say “1883,” they calculated
the proportion of 1-grams published in each year between 1875 and 1975 that
were “1883.” They reasoned that this proportion is a measure of the interest
in events that happened in that year. In their figure 3a, they plotted the usage
trajectories for three years: 1883, 1910, and 1950. These three years share a
common pattern: little use before that year, then a spike, then decay. Next,
to quantify the rate of decay for each year, Michel and colleagues calculated
the “half-life” of each year for all years between 1875 and 1975. In their figure
3a (inset), they showed that the half-life of each year is decreasing, and they
argued that this means that we are forgetting the past faster and faster. They used
version 1 of the English language corpus, but subsequently Google has released a
second version of the corpus. Please read all the parts of the question before you
begin coding.
This activity will give you practice writing reusable code, interpreting results,
and data wrangling (such as working with awkward files and handling missing
data). This activity will also help you get up and running with a rich and
interesting dataset.
a) Get the raw data from the Google Books NGram Viewer website
(http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html). In
particular, you should use version 2 of the English language corpus, which
was released on July 1, 2012. Uncompressed, this file is 1.4 GB.
b) Recreate the main part of figure 3a of Michel et al. (2011). To recreate
this figure, you will need two files: the one you downloaded in part (a)
and the “total counts” file, which you can use to convert the raw counts
into proportions. Note that the total counts file has a structure that may
make it a bit hard to read in. Does version 2 of the NGram data produce
similar results to those presented in Michel et al. (2011), which are based
on version 1 data?
c) Now check your graph against the graph created by the NGram Viewer
(https://books.google.com/ngrams).

d) Recreate figure 3a (main figure), but change the y-axis to be the raw
mention count (not the rate of mentions).
e) Does the difference between (b) and (d) lead you to reevaluate any of the
results of Michel et al. (2011). Why or why not?
f) Now, using the proportion of mentions, replicate the inset of figure 3a.
That is, for each year between 1875 and 1975, calculate the half-life of
that year. The half-life is defined to be the number of years that pass
before the proportion of mentions reaches half its peak value. Note that
Michel et al. (2011) do something more complicated to estimate the half-
life—see section III.6 of their Supporting Online Information—but they
claim that both approaches produce similar results. Does version 2 of the
NGram data produce similar results to those presented in Michel et al.
(2011), which are based on version 1 data? (Hint: Don’t be surprised if it
doesn’t.)
g) Were there any years that were outliers, such as years that were forgotten
particularly quickly or particularly slowly? Briefly speculate about possible
reasons for that pattern and explain how you identified the outliers.
h) Now replicate this result for version 2 of the NGrams data in Chinese,

] Penney (2016) explored whether the widespread publicity
about NSA/PRISM surveillance (i.e., the Snowden revelations) in June 2013 was
associated with a sharp and sudden decrease in traffic to Wikipedia articles
on topics that raise privacy concerns. If so, this change in behavior would be
consistent with a chilling effect resulting from mass surveillance. The approach
of Penney (2016) is sometimes called an interrupted time series design, and it is
related to the approaches described in section 2.4.3.
To choose the topic keywords, Penney referred to the list used by the US
Department of Homeland Security for tracking and monitoring social media.
The DHS list categorizes certain search terms into a range of issues, i.e.,
“Health Concern,” “Infrastructure Security,” and “Terrorism.” For the study
group, Penney used the 48 keywords related to “Terrorism” (see appendix
table 8). He then aggregated Wikipedia article view counts on a monthly basis
for the corresponding 48 Wikipedia articles over a 32-month period from
the beginning of January 2012 to the end of August 2014. To strengthen his
argument, he also created several comparison groups by tracking article views
on other topics.

Now, you are going to replicate and extend Penney (2016). All the
raw data that you will need for this activity is available from Wikipedia

the R-package wikipediatrend (Meissner and Team 2016). When you write
up your responses, please note which data source you used. (Note that this
same activity also appears in chapter 6.) This activity will give you practice in
data wrangling and thinking about discovering natural experiments in big data
sources. It will also get you up and running with a potentially interesting data
source for future projects.
a) Read Penney (2016) and replicate his figure 2, which shows the page views
for “Terrorism”-related pages before and after the Snowden revelations.
Interpret the findings.
b) Next, replicate figure 4A, which compares the study group (“Terrorism”-
related articles) with a comparator group using keywords categorized
under “DHS & Other Agencies” from the DHS list (see appendix table 10
and footnote 139). Interpret the findings.
c) In part (b) you compared the study group with one comparator group.
Penney also compared with two other comparator groups: “Infrastructure
Security”–related articles (appendix table 11) and popular Wikipedia pages
(appendix table 12). Come up with an alternative comparator group, and
test whether the findings from part (b) are sensitive to your choice of
comparator group. Which choice makes most sense? Why?
d) Penney stated that keywords relating to “Terrorism” were used to select
the Wikipedia articles because the US government cited terrorism as a
key justification for its online surveillance practices. As a check of these
48 “Terrorism”-related keywords, Penney (2016) also conducted a survey
on MTurk, asking respondents to rate each of the keywords in terms of
Government Trouble, Privacy-Sensitive, and Avoidance (appendix tablea
7 and 8). Replicate the survey on MTurk and compare your results.
e) Based on the results in part (d) and your reading of the article, do you agree
with Penney’s choice of topic keywords in the study group? Why or why
not? If not, what would you suggest instead?

broadcast sharing” was down 21% year over year. This decline was particularly
acute with Facebook users under 30 years of age. The report attributed the
decline to two factors. One is the growth in the number of “friends” people have
on Facebook. The other is that some sharing activity has shifted to messaging
and to competitors such as Snapchat. The report also revealed the several tactics

that make original posts more prominent, as well as periodic reminders of the

9. [
] What is the difference between a sociologist and a historian? According
to Goldthorpe (1991), the main difference is control over data collection.
Historians are forced to use relics, whereas sociologists can tailor their data
collection to specific purposes. Read Goldthorpe (1991). How is the difference
between sociology and history related to the idea of custommades and ready-
mades?
10. [
] This builds on the previous question. Goldthorpe (1991) drew a number
of critical responses, including one from Nicky Hart (1994) that challenged
Goldthorpe’s devotion to tailor-made data. To clarify the potential limitations
of tailor-made data, Hart described the Affluent Worker Project, a large survey
to measure the relationship between social class and voting that was conducted
by Goldthorpe and colleagues in the mid-1960s. As one might expect from a
scholar who favored designed data over found data, the Affluent Worker Project
collected data that were tailored to address a recently proposed theory about the
future of social class in an era of increasing living standards. But Goldthorpe and
colleagues somehow “forgot” to collect information about the voting behavior of
women. Here’s how Nicky Hart (1994) summarized the whole episode:
“...it [is] difficult to avoid the conclusion that women were omitted
because this ‘tailor made’ dataset was confined by a paradigmatic logic
which excluded female experience. Driven by a theoretical vision of class
consciousness and action as male preoccupations ..., Goldthorpe and his
colleagues constructed a set of empirical proofs which fed and nurtured
their own theoretical assumptions instead of exposing them to a valid test
of adequacy.”
Hart continued:
“The empirical findings of the Affluent Worker Project tell us more about
the masculinist values of mid-century sociology than they inform the
processes of stratification, politics and material life.”
Can you think of other examples where tailor-made data collection has the
biases of the data collector built into it? How does this compare to algorithmic
confounding? What implications might this have for when researchers should
use readymades and when they should use custommades?

] In this chapter, I have contrasted data collected by researchers for
researchers with administrative records created by companies and governments.

CHAPTER 2

Figure 2.12: The picture is both a duck and a rabbit; what you see depends on your
perspective. Big data sources are both found and designed; again, what you see depends on
your perspective. For example, the call data records collected by a mobile-phone company are
found data from the perspective of a researcher. But these exact same records are designed data
from the perspective of someone working in the billing department of the phone company.
(Source: Popular Science Monthly (1899)/Wikimedia Commons).
Some people call these administrative records “found data,” which they contrast
with “designed data.” It is true that administrative records are found by re-
searchers, but they are also highly designed. For example, modern tech compa-
nies work very hard to collect and curate their data. Thus, these administrative
records are both found and designed, it just depends on your perspective
(figure 2.12).
Provide an example of data source where seeing it both as found and designed
is helpful when using that data source for research.

] In a thoughtful essay, Christian Sandvig and Eszter Hargittai (2015)
split digital research into two broad categories depending on whether the
digital system is an “instrument” or “object of study.” An example of the
first kind—where the system is an instrument—is the research by Bengts-
son and colleagues (2011) on using mobile-phone data to track migra-
tion after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. An example of the second
kind—where the system is an object of study—is research by Jensen (2007)
on how the introduction of mobile phones throughout Kerala, India impacted
the functioning of the market for fish. I find this distinction helpful because it
clarifies that studies using digital data sources can have quite different goals even
if they are using the same kind of data source. In order to further clarify this
distinction, describe four studies that you’ve seen: two that use a digital system
as an instrument and two that use a digital system as an object of study. You can
use examples from this chapter if you want.

CHAPTER 3
ASKING QUESTIONS
3.1
Introduction
Researchers who study dolphins can’t ask them questions and are therefore
forced to try to learn about dolphins by observing their behavior. Researchers
who study humans, on the other hand, have it easier: their respondents can
talk. Talking to people was an important part of social research in the past,
and I expect that it will be in the future too.
In social research, talking to people typically takes two forms: surveys
and in-depth interviews. Roughly speaking, research using surveys involves
systematic recruitment of large numbers of participants, highly structured
questionnaires, and the use of statistical methods to generalize from the
participants to a larger population. Research using in-depth interviews, on
the other hand, generally involves a small number of participants and semi-
structured conversations, and results in a rich, qualitative description of the
participants. Surveys and in-depth interviews are both powerful approaches,
but surveys are much more impacted by the transition from the analog to the
digital age. Therefore, in this chapter, I’ll focus on survey research.
As I’ll show in this chapter, the digital age creates many exciting oppor-
tunities for survey researchers to collect data more quickly and cheaply, to
ask different kinds of questions, and to magnify the value of survey data
with big data sources. The idea that survey research can be transformed by a
technological change is not new, however. Around 1970, a similar change was
taking place driven by a different communication technology: the telephone.
Fortunately, understanding how the telephone changed survey research can
help us imagine how the digital age will change survey research.
Survey research, as we recognize it today, began in the 1930s. During the
first era of survey research, researchers would randomly sample geographic
areas (such as city blocks) and then travel to those areas in order to have
85

face-to-face conversations with people in randomly sampled households.
Then, a technological development—the widespread diffusion of landline
phones in wealthy countries—eventually led to the second era of survey
research. This second era differed both in how people were sampled and
in how conversations took place. In the second era, rather than sampling
households in geographic areas, researchers randomly sampled telephone
numbers in a procedure called random-digit dialing. And rather than trav-
eling to talk to people face to face, researchers instead called them on the
telephone. These might seem like small logistical changes, but they made
survey research faster, cheaper, and more flexible. In addition to being
empowering, these changes were also controversial because many researchers
were concerned that changes in sampling and interviewing procedures could
introduce a variety of biases. But eventually, after lots of work, researchers
figured out how to collect data reliably using random-digit dialing and
telephone interviews. Thus, by figuring out how to successfully harness
society’s technological infrastructure, researchers were able to modernize
how they did survey research.
Now, another technological development—the digital age—will eventually
bring us to a third era of survey research. This transition is being driven in
part by the gradual decay of second-era approaches (Meyer, Mok, and Sulli-
van 2015). For example, for a variety of technological and social reasons, non-
response rates—that is, the proportions of respondents who are sampled but
do not participate in surveys—have been increasing for many years (National
Research Council 2013). These long-term trends mean that the nonresponse
rate can now exceed 90% in standard telephone surveys (Kohut et al. 2012).
On the other hand, the transition to a third era is also being driven
in part by exciting new opportunities, some of which I’ll describe in this
chapter. Although things are not yet settled, I expect that the third era
of survey research will be characterized by non-probability sampling,
computer-administered interviews, and the linkage of surveys to big data
sources (table 3.1).
The transition between the second and third eras of survey research has
not been completely smooth, and there have been fierce debates about how
researchers should proceed. Looking back on the transition between the first
and second eras, I think there is one key insight for us now: the beginning
is not the end. That is, initially many second-era telephone-based methods
were ad hoc and did not work very well. But, through hard work, researchers

solved these problems. For example, researchers had been doing random-

developed a random-digit-dialing sampling method that had good practical
and theoretical properties (Waksberg 1978; Brick and Tucker 2007). Thus,
we should not confuse the current state of third-era approaches with their
ultimate outcomes.
The history of survey research shows that the field evolves, driven by
changes in technology and society. There is no way to stop that evolution.
Rather, we should embrace it, while continuing to draw wisdom from
earlier eras, and that is the approach that I will take in this chapter. First,
I will argue that big data sources will not replace surveys and that the
abundance of big data sources increases—not decreases—the value of surveys
(section 3.2). Given that motivation, I’ll summarize the total survey error
framework (section 3.3) that was developed during the first two eras of
survey research. This framework enables us to understand new approaches
to representation—in particular, non-probability samples (section 3.4)—
and new approaches to measurement—in particular, new ways of asking
questions to respondents (section 3.5). Finally, I’ll describe two research
templates for linking survey data to big data sources (Section 3.6).
3.2
Asking versus observing
We are always going to need to ask people questions.
Given that more and more of our behavior is captured in big data sources,
such as government and business administrative data, some people might
ASKING QUESTIONS
87

think that asking questions is a thing of the past. But it’s not that sim-
ple. There are two main reasons that I think researchers will continue
to ask people questions. First, as I discussed in chapter 2, there are real
problems with the accuracy, completeness, and accessibility of many big
data sources. Second, in addition to these practical reasons, there is more
fundamental reason: there are some things that are very hard to learn from
behavioral data—even perfect behavioral data. For example, some of the
most important social outcomes and predictors are internal states, such as
emotions, knowledge, expectations, and opinions. Internal states exist inside
people’s heads, and sometimes the best way to learn about internal states
is to ask.
The practical and fundamental limitations of big data sources, and how
they can be overcome with surveys, are illustrated by Moira Burke and
Robert Kraut’s (2014) research on how the strength of friendships was
impacted by interaction on Facebook. At the time, Burke was working at
Facebook, so she had complete access to one of the most massive and
detailed records of human behavior ever created. But, even so, Burke
and Kraut had to use surveys in order to answer their research question.
Their outcome of interest—the subjective feeling of closeness between the
respondent and her friend—is an internal state that only exists inside the
respondent’s head. Further, in addition to using a survey to collect their
outcome of interest, Burke and Kraut also had to use a survey to learn
about potentially confounding factors. In particular, they wanted to separate
the impact of communicating on Facebook from communication through
other channels (e.g., email, phone, and face to face). Even though inter-
actions through email and phone are automatically recorded, these traces
were not available to Burke and Kraut, so they had to collect them with
a survey. Combining their survey data about friendship strength and non-
Facebook interaction with the Facebook log data, Burke and Kraut concluded
that communication via Facebook did in fact lead to increased feelings
of closeness.
As the work of Burke and Kraut illustrates, big data sources will not
eliminate the need to ask people questions. In fact, I would draw the opposite
lesson from this study: big data sources can actually increase the value of
asking questions, as I will show throughout this chapter. Therefore, the best
way to think about the relationship between asking and observing is that they
are complements rather than substitutes; they are like peanut butter and jelly.
88
CHAPTER 3

When there is more peanut butter, people want more jelly; when there is
more big data, I think people will want more surveys.
3.3
The total survey error framework
Total survey error = representation errors + measurement errors.
Estimates that come from sample surveys are often imperfect. That is, there
is usually a difference between the estimate produced by a sample survey
(e.g., the estimated average height of students in a school) and the true
value in the population (e.g., the actual average height of students in a
school). Sometimes these errors are so small that they are unimportant,
but sometimes, unfortunately, they can be big and consequential. In an
attempt to understand, measure, and reduce errors, researchers gradually
created a single, overarching conceptual framework for the errors that
can arise in sample surveys: the total survey error framework (Groves and
Lyberg 2010). Although the development of this framework began in the
1940s, I think it offers us two helpful ideas for survey research in the
digital age.
First, the total survey error framework clarifies that there are two types
of errors: bias and variance. Roughly, bias is systematic error and variance
is random error. In other words, imagine running 1,000 replications of the
same sample survey and then looking at the distribution of the estimates
from these 1,000 replications. The bias is the difference between the mean
of these replicate estimates and the true value. The variance is the variability
of these estimates. All else being equal, we would like a procedure with no
bias and small variance. Unfortunately, for many real problems, such no-
bias, small-variance procedures do not exist, which puts researchers in the
difficult position of deciding how to balance the problems introduced by bias
and variance. Some researchers instinctively prefer unbiased procedures, but
a single-minded focus on bias can be a mistake. If the goal is to produce an
estimate that is as close as possible to the truth (i.e., with the smallest possible
error), then you might be better off with a procedure that has a small bias
and a small variance than with one that is unbiased but has a large variance
(figure 3.1). In other words, the total survey error framework shows that
when evaluating survey research procedures, you should consider both bias
and variance.

Figure 3.1: Bias and variance. Ideally, researchers would have a no-bias, low-variance esti-
mation procedure. In reality, they often make decisions that induce a trade-off between bias
and variance. Although some researchers instinctively prefer unbiased procedures, sometimes
a small-bias, small-variance procedure can produce more accurate estimates than an unbiased
procedure that has high variance.
The second main insight from the total survey error framework, which
will organize much of this chapter, is that there are two sources of errors:
problems related to who you talk to (representation) and problems related
to what you learn from those conversations (measurement). For example,
you might be interested in estimating attitudes about online privacy among
adults living in France. Making these estimates requires two different types
of inference. First, from the answers that respondents give, you have to infer
their attitudes about online privacy (which is a problem of measurement).
Second, from the inferred attitudes among respondents, you must infer the
attitudes in the population as a whole (which is a problem of representation).
Perfect sampling with bad survey questions will produce bad estimates,
90
CHAPTER 3

as will bad sampling with perfect survey questions. In other words, good
estimates require sound approaches to measurement and representation.
Given that background, I’ll review how survey researchers have thought
about representation and measurement in the past. Then, I’ll show how ideas
about representation and measurement can guide digital-age survey research.
3.3.1 Representation
Representation is about making inferences from your respondents to
your target population.
In order to understand the kind of errors that can happen when inferring
from respondents to the larger population, let’s consider the Literary Digest
straw poll that tried to predict the outcome of the 1936 US presidential
election. Although it happened more than 75 years ago, this debacle still has
an important lesson to teach researchers today.
Literary Digest was a popular general-interest magazine, and starting in
1920 they began running straw polls to predict the outcomes of presidential
elections. To make these predictions, they would send ballots to lots of
people and then simply tally up the ballots that were returned; Literary
Digest proudly reported that the ballots they received were neither “weighted,
adjusted, nor interpreted.” This procedure correctly predicted the winners
of the elections in 1920, 1924, 1928, and 1932. In 1936, in the midst of the
Great Depression, Literary Digest sent out ballots to 10 million people, whose
names came predominantly from telephone directories and automobile
registration records. Here’s how they described their methodology:
“THE DIGEST’s smooth-running machine moves with the swift pre-
cision of thirty years’ experience to reduce guesswork to hard facts

lion addresses a day. Every day, in a great room high above motor-

five-times cross-classified and totaled. When the last figure has been
totted and checked, if past experience is a criterion, the country will
know to within a fraction of 1 percent the actual popular vote of forty
million [voters].” (August 22, 1936)
Literary Digest’s fetishization of size is instantly recognizable to any “big
data” researcher today. Of the 10 million ballots distributed, an amazing
2.4 million were returned—that’s roughly 1,000 times larger than modern
political polls. From these 2.4 million respondents, the verdict was clear:
Alf Landon was going to defeat the incumbent Franklin Roosevelt. But, in
fact, Roosevelt defeated Landon in a landslide. How could Literary Digest go
wrong with so much data? Our modern understanding of sampling makes
Literary Digest’s mistakes clear and helps us avoid making similar mistakes
in the future.
Thinking clearly about sampling requires us to consider four different
groups of people (figure 3.2). The first group is the target population; this is
the group that the researcher defines as the population of interest. In the case
of Literary Digest, the target population was voters in the 1936 presidential
election.
After deciding on a target population, a researcher needs to develop a
list of people that can be used for sampling. This list is called a sampling
frame and the people on it are called the frame population. Ideally, the
target population and the frame population would be exactly the same,
but in practice this is often not the case. For example, in the case of
Literary Digest, the frame population was the 10 million people whose names
came predominately from telephone directories and automobile registration
records. Differences between the target population and the frame population
are called coverage error. Coverage error does not, by itself, guarantee
problems. However, it can lead to coverage bias if people in the frame

population are systematically different from people in the target population
who are not in the frame population. This is, in fact, exactly what happened
in the Literary Digest poll. The people in their frame population tended to be
more likely to support Alf Landon, in part because they were wealthier (recall
that both telephones and automobiles were relatively new and expensive in
1936). So, in the Literary Digest poll, coverage error led to coverage bias.
After defining the frame population, the next step is for a researcher to
select the sample population; these are the people who the researcher will
attempt to interview. If the sample has different characteristics than the
frame population, then sampling can introduce sampling error. In the case
of the Literary Digest fiasco, however, there actually was no sampling—
the magazine attempted to contact everyone in the frame population—and
therefore there was no sampling error. Many researchers tend to focus on
sampling error—this is typically the only kind of error captured by the
margin of error reported in surveys—but the Literary Digest fiasco reminds
us that we need to consider all sources of error, both random and systematic.
Finally, after selecting a sample population, a researcher attempts to
interview all its members. Those people who are successfully interviewed are
called respondents. Ideally, the sample population and the respondents would
be exactly the same, but in practice there is nonresponse. That is, people who
are selected in the sample sometimes do not participate. If the people who
respond are different from those who don’t respond, then there can be nonre-
sponse bias. Nonresponse bias was the second main problem with the Literary
Digest poll. Only 24% of the people who received a ballot responded, and it
turned out that people who supported Landon were more likely to respond.
Beyond just being an example to introduce the ideas of representation,
the Literary Digest poll is an oft-repeated parable, cautioning researchers
about the dangers of haphazard sampling. Unfortunately, I think that the
lesson that many people draw from this story is the wrong one. The most
common moral of the story is that researchers can’t learn anything from non-
probability samples (i.e., samples without strict probability-based rules for
selecting participants). But, as I’ll show later in this chapter, that’s not quite
right. Instead, I think there are really two morals to this story; morals that
are as true today as they were in 1936. First, a large amount of haphazardly
collected data will not guarantee a good estimate. In general, having a large
number of respondents decreases the variance of estimates, but it does not
necessarily decrease the bias. With lots of data, researchers can sometimes
ASKING QUESTIONS
93

get a precise estimate of the wrong thing; they can be precisely inaccurate
(McFarland and McFarland 2015). The second main lesson from the Literary
Digest fiasco is that researchers need to account for how their sample was
collected when making estimates. In other words, because the sampling
process in the Literary Digest poll was systematically skewed toward some
respondents, researchers needed to use a more complex estimation process
that weighted some respondents more than others. Later in this chapter,
I’ll show you one such weighting procedure—post-stratification—that can
enable you to make better estimates from haphazard samples.
3.3.2 Measurement
Measurement is about inferring what your respondents think and do
from what they say.
In addition to problems of representation, the total survey error framework
shows that the second major source of errors is measurement: how we make
inferences from the answers that respondents give to our questions. It turns
out that the answers we receive, and therefore the inferences we make, can
depend critically—and in sometimes surprising ways—on exactly how we
ask. Perhaps nothing illustrates this important point better than a joke in the
wonderful book Asking Questions by Norman Bradburn, Seymour Sudman,
and Brian Wansink (2004):
Two priests, a Dominican and a Jesuit, are discussing whether it is a sin
to smoke and pray at the same time. After failing to reach a conclusion,
each goes off to consult his respective superior. The Dominican says,
“What did your superior say?”
The Jesuit responds, “He said it was alright.”
“That’s funny” the Dominican replies, “My supervisor said it
was a sin.”
The Jesuit said, “What did you ask him?” The Dominican replies, “I
asked him if it was alright to smoke while praying.” “Oh,” said the Jesuit,
“I asked if it was OK to pray while smoking.”
Beyond this specific joke, survey researchers have documented many
systematic ways that what you learn depends on how you ask. In fact, the very
94
CHAPTER 3

issue at the root of this joke has a name in the survey research community:
question form effects (Kalton and Schuman 1982). To see how question form
effects might impact real surveys, consider these two very similar-looking
survey questions:
• “How much do you agree with the following statement: Individuals are
more to blame than social conditions for crime and lawlessness in this
country.”
• “How much do you agree with the following statement: Social condi-
tions are more to blame than individuals for crime and lawlessness in
this country.”
Although both questions appear to measure the same thing, they produced
different results in a real survey experiment (Schuman and Presser 1996).
When asked one way, about 60% of respondents reported that individuals
were more to blame for crime, but when asked the other way, about
60% reported that social conditions were more to blame (figure 3.3). In
other words, the small difference between these two questions could lead
researchers to a different conclusion.
In addition to the structure of the question, respondents can also give
different answers, depending on the specific words used. For example, in
order to measure opinions about governmental priorities, respondents were
read the following prompt:
“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can
be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these
problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think
we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the
right amount.”
Next, half of the respondents were asked about “welfare” and half were
asked about “aid for the poor.” While these might seem like two different
phrases for the same thing, they elicited very different results (figure 3.4);
Americans report being much more supportive of “aid to the poor” than
“welfare” (Smith 1987; Rasinski 1989; Huber and Paris 2013).
As these examples about question form effects and wording effects show,
the answers that researchers receive can be influenced by how they ask their

questions. These examples sometimes lead researchers to wonder about the
“correct” way to ask their survey questions. While I think there are some
clearly wrong ways to ask a question, I don’t think there is always one
single correct way. That is, it is not obviously better to ask about “welfare”
or “aid for the poor”; these are two different questions that measure two
different things about respondents’ attitudes. These examples also sometimes
lead researchers to conclude that surveys should not be used. Unfortunately,
sometimes there is no choice. Instead, I think the right lesson to draw from
these examples is that we should construct our questions carefully and we
should not accept responses uncritically.
Most concretely, this means that if you are analyzing survey data collected
by someone else, make sure that you have read the actual questionnaire. And
if you are creating your own questionnaire, I have four suggestions. First,
I suggest that you read more about questionnaire design (e.g., Bradburn,

questions. Adapted from Huber and Paris (2013), table A1.
Sudman, and Wansink (2004)); there is more to this than I’ve been able to
describe here. Second, I suggest that you copy—word for word—questions
from high-quality surveys. For example, if you want to ask respondents about
their race/ethnicity, you could copy the questions that are used in large-
scale government surveys, such as the census. Although this might sound
like plagiarism, copying questions is encouraged in survey research (as long
as you cite the original survey). If you copy questions from high-quality
surveys, you can be sure that they have been tested, and you can compare
the responses to your survey to responses from some other surveys. Third,
if you think your questionnaire might contain important question wording
effects or question form effects, you could run a survey experiment where
half the respondents receive one version of the question and half receive
the other version (Krosnick 2011). Finally, I suggest that you pilot-test your
questions with some people from your frame population; survey researchers
ASKING QUESTIONS
97

call this process pre-testing (Presser et al. 2004). My experience is that survey
pre-testing is extremely helpful.
3.3.3 Cost
Surveys are not free, and this is a real constraint.
So far, I’ve briefly reviewed the total survey error framework, which itself is
the subject of book-length treatments (Weisberg 2005; Groves et al. 2009).
Although this framework is comprehensive, it generally causes researchers
to overlook an important factor: cost. Although cost—which can be mea-
sured by either time or money—is rarely explicitly discussed by academic
researchers, it is a real constraint that should not be ignored. In fact, cost
is fundamental to the entire process of survey research (Groves 2004): it is
the reason researchers interview a sample of people rather than an entire
population. A single-minded devotion to minimizing error while completely
ignoring cost is not always in our best interest.
The limitations of an obsession with reducing error are illustrated by the
landmark project of Scott Keeter and colleagues (2000) on the effects of
expensive field operations on reducing nonresponse in telephone surveys.
Keeter and colleagues ran two simultaneous studies, one using “standard”
recruitment procedures and one using “rigorous” recruitment procedures.
The difference between the two studies was the amount of effort that
went into contacting respondents and encouraging them to participate. For
example, in the study with “rigorous” recruitment, researchers called the
sampled households more frequently and over a longer period of time and
made extra callbacks if participants initially refused to participate. These
extra efforts did in fact produce a lower rate of nonresponse, but they
added to the cost substantially. The study using “rigorous” procedures
was twice as expensive and eight times slower. And in the end, both
studies produced essentially identical estimates. This project, as well as
subsequent replications with similar findings (Keeter et al. 2006), should
lead you to wonder: are we better off with two reasonable surveys or
one pristine survey? What about 10 reasonable surveys or one pristine
survey? What about 100 reasonable surveys or one pristine survey? At some
point, cost advantages must outweigh vague, nonspecific concerns about
quality.
98
CHAPTER 3

As I’ll show in this rest of the chapter, many of the opportunities created
by the digital age are not about making estimates that obviously have lower
error. Rather, these opportunities are about estimating different quantities
and about making estimates faster and cheaper, even with possibly higher
errors. Researchers who insist on a single-minded obsession with minimizing
error at the expense of other dimensions of quality are going to miss out on
exciting opportunities. Given this background about the total survey error
framework, we will now turn to three main areas of the third era of survey
research: new approaches to representation (section 3.4), new approaches to
measurement (section 3.5), and new strategies for combining surveys with
big data sources (section 3.6).
3.4
Who to ask
The digital age is making probability sampling in practice harder and
is creating new opportunities for non-probability sampling.
In the history of sampling, there have been two competing approaches:
probability sampling methods and non-probability sampling methods.
Although both approaches were used in the early days of sampling, probabil-
ity sampling has come to dominate, and many social researchers are taught
to view non-probability sampling with great skepticism. However, as I will
describe below, changes created by the digital age mean that it is time for
researchers to reconsider non-probability sampling. In particular, probability
sampling has been getting hard to do in practice, and non-probability
sampling has been getting faster, cheaper, and better. Faster and cheaper
surveys are not just ends in themselves; they enable new opportunities such
as more frequent surveys and larger sample sizes. For example, by using non-
probability methods, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)
is able to have roughly 10 times more participants than earlier studies using
probability sampling. This much larger sample enables political researchers
to study variation in attitudes and behavior across subgroups and social
contexts. Further, all of this added scale came without decreases in the quality
of estimates (Ansolabehere and Rivers 2013).
Currently, the dominant approach to sampling for social research is
probability sampling. In probability sampling, all members of the target
population have a known, nonzero probability of being sampled, and all
ASKING QUESTIONS
99

people who are sampled respond to the survey. When these conditions
are met, elegant mathematical results offer provable guarantees about a
researcher’s ability to use the sample to make inferences about the target
population.
In the real world, however, the conditions underlying these mathematical
results are rarely met. For example, there are often coverage errors and
nonresponse. Because of these problems, researchers often have to employ a
variety of statistical adjustments in order to make inference from their sample
to their target population. Thus, it is important to distinguish between
probability sampling in theory, which has strong theoretical guarantees,
and probability sampling in practice, which offers no such guarantees and
depends on a variety of statistical adjustments.
Over time, the differences between probability sampling in theory and
probability sampling in practice have been increasing. For example, non-
response rates have been steadily increasing, even in high-quality, expen-
sive surveys (figure 3.5) (National Research Council 2013; Meyer, Mok,
and Sullivan 2015). Nonresponse rates are much higher in commercial
telephone surveys—sometimes even as high as 90% (Kohut et al. 2012).
These increases in nonresponse threaten the quality of estimates because
estimates increasingly depend on the statistical models that researchers use
to adjust for nonresponse. Further, these decreases in quality have happened
despite increasingly expensive efforts by survey researchers to maintain high
response rates. Some people fear that these twin trends of decreasing quality
and increasing cost threaten the foundation of survey research (National
Research Council 2013).
At the same time that there have been growing difficulties for probability
sampling methods, there have also been exciting developments in non-
probability sampling methods. There are a variety of styles of such methods,
but the one thing that they have in common is that they cannot easily fit
into the mathematical framework of probability sampling (Baker et al. 2013).
In other words, in non-probability sampling methods, not everyone has
a known and nonzero probability of inclusion. Non-probability sampling
methods have a terrible reputation among social researchers, and they are
associated with some of the most dramatic failures of survey researchers,
such as the Literary Digest fiasco (discussed earlier) and “Dewey Defeats
Truman,” the incorrect prediction about the US presidential elections of
1948 (figure 3.6).

expensive and estimates are less reliable. Adapted from Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan (2015),

Although “Dewey Defeats Truman” happened in 1948, it is still among the reasons why
many researchers are skeptical about estimates from non-probability samples. Source: Harry
S. Truman Library and Museum.

One form of non-probability sampling that is particular suited to the
digital age is the use of online panels. Researchers using online panels depend
on some panel provider—usually a company, government, or university—
to construct a large, diverse group of people who agree to serve as re-
spondents for surveys. These panel participants are often recruited using a
variety of ad hoc methods such as online banner ads. Then, a researcher
can pay the panel provider for access to a sample of respondents with
desired characteristics (e.g., nationally representative of adults). These online
panels are non-probability methods, because not everyone has a known,
nonzero probability of inclusion. Although non-probability online panels
are already being used by social researchers (e.g., the CCES), there is still
some debate about the quality of estimates that come from them (Callegaro
et al. 2014).
Despite these debates, I think there are two reasons why the time is
right for social researchers to reconsider non-probability sampling. First,
in the digital age, there have been many developments in the collection
and analysis of non-probability samples. These newer methods are different
enough from the methods that caused problems in the past that I think
it makes sense to think of them as “non-probability sampling 2.0.” The
second reason why researchers should reconsider non-probability sampling
is because probability samples in practice are becoming increasingly difficult.
When there are high rates of nonresponse—as there are in real surveys now—
the actual probabilities of inclusion for respondents are not known, and thus
probability samples and non-probability samples are not so different as many
researchers believe.
As I said earlier, non-probability samples are viewed with great skepticism
by many social researchers, in part because of their role in some of the most
embarrassing failures in the early days of survey research. A clear example
of how far we have come with non-probability samples is the research by
Wei Wang, David Rothschild, Sharad Goel, and Andrew Gelman (2015)
that correctly recovered the outcome of the 2012 US election using a non-
probability sample of American Xbox users—a decidedly nonrandom sample
of Americans. The researchers recruited respondents from the XBox gaming
system, and, as you might expect, the sample skewed male and skewed young:
18- to 29-year-olds make up 19% of the electorate but 65% of the Xbox
sample, and men make up 47% of the electorate but 93% of the Xbox sample
(figure 3.7). Because of these strong demographic biases, the raw Xbox data

Figure 3.7: Demographics of respondents in Wang et al. (2015). Because respondents were

were a poor indicator of election returns. They predicted a strong victory
for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama. Again, this is another example of the
dangers of raw, unadjusted non-probability samples and is reminiscent of the
Literary Digest fiasco.
However, Wang and colleagues were aware of these problems and at-
tempted to adjust for their nonrandom sampling process when making
estimates. In particular, they used post-stratification, a technique that is also
widely used to adjust probability samples that have coverage errors and
nonresponse.
The main idea of post-stratification is to use auxiliary information about
the target population to help improve the estimate that comes from a sample.
When using post-stratification to make estimates from their non-probability
sample, Wang and colleague chopped the population into different groups,
estimated the support for Obama in each group, and then took a weighted
average of the group estimates to produce an overall estimate. For example,
they could have split the population into two groups (men and women),
ASKING QUESTIONS
103

estimated the support for Obama among men and women, and then esti-
mated overall support for Obama by taking a weighted average in order to
account for the fact that women make up 53% of the electorate and men
47%. Roughly, post-stratification helps correct for an imbalanced sample by
bringing in auxiliary information about the sizes of the groups.
The key to post-stratification is to form the right groups. If you can
chop up the population into homogeneous groups such that the response
propensities are the same for everyone in each group, then post-stratification
will produce unbiased estimates. In other words, post-stratifying by gender
will produce unbiased estimates if all men have the response propensity
and all women have the same response propensity. This assumption is
called the homogeneous-response-propensities-within-groups assumption, and
I describe it a bit more in the mathematical notes at the end of this chapter.
Of course, it seems unlikely that the response propensities will be the
same for all men and all women. However, the homogeneous-response-
propensities-within-groups assumption becomes more plausible as the num-
ber of groups increases. Roughly, it becomes easier to chop the population
into homogeneous groups if you create more groups. For example, it might
seem implausible that all women have the same response propensity, but it
might seem more plausible that there is the same response propensity for
all women who are aged 18–29, who graduated from college, and who are
living in California. Thus, as the number of groups used in post-stratification
gets larger, the assumptions needed to support the method become more
reasonable. Given this fact, researchers often want to create a huge number of
groups for post-stratification. However, as the number of groups increases,
researchers run into a different problem: data sparsity. If there are only
a small number of people in each group, then the estimates will be more
uncertain, and in the extreme case where there is a group that has no
respondents, then post-stratification completely breaks down.
There are two ways out of this inherent tension between the plausibility
of the homogeneous-response-propensity-within-groups assumption and
the demand for reasonable sample sizes in each group. First, researchers
can collect a larger, more diverse sample, which helps ensure reasonable
sample sizes in each group. Second, they can use a more sophisticated
statistical model for making estimates within groups. And, in fact, sometimes
researchers do both, as Wang and colleagues did with their study of the
election using respondents from Xbox.
104
CHAPTER 3

Because they were using a non-probability method with computer-
administered interviews (I’ll talk more about computer-administered in-
terviews in section 3.5), Wang and colleagues had very inexpensive data
collection, which enabled them to collect information from 345,858 unique
participants, a huge number by the standards of election polling. This mas-
sive sample size enabled them to form a huge number of post-stratification
groups. Whereas post-stratification typically involves chopping the popula-
tion into hundreds of groups, Wang and colleagues divided the population
into 176,256 groups defined by gender (2 categories), race (4 categories),
age (4 categories), education (4 categories), state (51 categories), party ID
(3 categories), ideology (3 categories), and 2008 vote (3 categories). In other
words, their huge sample size, which was enabled by low-cost data collection,
enabled them to make a more plausible assumption in their estimation
process.
Even with 345,858 unique participants, however, there were still many,
many groups for which Wang and colleagues had almost no respondents.
Therefore, they used a technique called multilevel regression to estimate
the support in each group. Essentially, to estimate the support for Obama
within a specific group, the multilevel regression pooled information from
many closely related groups. For example, imagine trying to estimate the
support for Obama among female Hispanics between 18 and 29 years old
who are college graduates, who are registered Democrats, who self-identify
as moderates, and who voted for Obama in 2008. This is a very, very specific
group, and it is possible that there is nobody in the sample with these
characteristics. Therefore, to make estimates about this group, multilevel
regression uses a statistical model to pool together estimates from people in
very similar groups.
Thus, Wang and colleagues used an approach that combined multilevel
regression and post-stratification, so they called their strategy multilevel
regression with post-stratification or, more affectionately, “Mr. P.” When
Wang and colleagues used Mr. P. to make estimates from the XBox non-
probability sample, they produced estimates very close to the overall support
that Obama received in the 2012 election (figure 3.8). In fact their estimates
were more accurate than an aggregate of traditional public opinion polls.
Thus, in this case, statistical adjustments—specifically Mr. P.—seem to do
a good job correcting the biases in non-probability data: biases that were
clearly visible when you look at the estimates from the unadjusted Xbox data.

There are two main lessons from the study of Wang and colleagues. First,
unadjusted non-probability samples can lead to bad estimates; this is a lesson
that many researchers have heard before. The second lesson, however, is that
non-probability samples, when analyzed properly, can actually produce good
estimates; non-probability samples need not automatically lead to something
like the Literary Digest fiasco.
Going forward, if you are trying to decide between using a probability
sampling approach and a non-probability sampling approach, you face a
difficult choice. Sometimes researchers want a quick and rigid rule (e.g.,
always use probability sampling methods), but it is increasingly difficult to
offer such a rule. Researchers face a difficult choice between probability sam-
pling methods in practice—which are increasingly expensive and far from
the theoretical results that justify their use—and non-probability sampling
methods—which are cheaper and faster, but less familiar and more varied.
One thing that is clear, however, is that if you are forced to work with non-
probability samples or nonrepresentative big data sources (think back to
chapter 2), then there is a strong reason to believe that estimates made using
106
CHAPTER 3

post-stratification and related techniques will be better than unadjusted,
raw estimates.
3.5
New ways of asking questions
Traditional surveys are closed, boring, and removed from life. Now
we can ask questions that are more open, more fun, and more
embedded in life.
The total survey error framework encourages researchers to think about
survey research as a two-part process: recruiting respondents and asking
them questions. In section 3.4, I discussed how the digital age changes how
we recruit respondents, and now I’ll discuss how it enables researchers to
ask questions in new ways. These new approaches can be used with either
probability samples or non-probability samples.
A survey mode is the environment in which the questions are asked, and
it can have important impacts on measurement (Couper 2011). In the first
era of survey research, the most common mode was face to face, while in the
second era, it was telephone. Some researchers view the third era of survey
research as just an expansion of survey modes to include computers and
mobile phones. However, the digital age is more than just a change in the
pipes through which questions and answers flow. Instead, the transition from
analog to digital enables—and will likely require—researchers to change
how we ask questions.
A study by Michael Schober and colleagues (2015) illustrates the benefits
of adjusting traditional approaches to better match digital-age communi-
cation systems. In this study, Schober and colleagues compared different
approaches to asking people questions via a mobile phone. They compared
collecting data via voice conversations, which would have been a natural
translation of second-era approaches, to collecting data via many microsur-
veys sent through text messages, an approach with no obvious precedent.
They found that microsurveys sent through text messages led to higher-
quality data than voice interviews. In other words, simply transferring the
old approach into the new medium did not lead to the highest-quality data.
Instead, by thinking clearly about the capabilities and social norms around
mobile phones, Schober and colleagues were able to develop a better way of
asking questions that lead to higher-quality responses.

There are many dimensions along which researchers can categorize survey
modes, but I think the most critical feature of digital-age survey modes is that
they are computer-administered, rather than interviewer-administered (as in
telephone and face-to-face surveys). Taking human interviewers out of the
data collection process offers enormous benefits and introduces some draw-
backs. In terms of benefits, removing human interviewers can reduce social
desirability bias, the tendency for respondents to try to present themselves in
the best possible way by, for example, under-reporting stigmatized behavior
(e.g., illegal drug use) and over-reporting encouraged behavior (e.g., voting)
(Kreuter, Presser, and Tourangeau 2008). Removing human interviewers can
also eliminate interviewer effects, the tendency for responses to be influenced
in subtle ways by the characteristics of the human interviewer (West and
Blom 2016). In addition to potentially improving accuracy for some types of
questions, removing human interviewers also dramatically reduces costs—
interview time is one of the biggest expenses in survey research—and in-
creases flexibility because respondents can participate whenever they want,
not just when an interviewer is available. However, removing the human
interviewer also creates some challenges. In particular, interviewers can de-
velop a rapport with respondents that can increase participation rates, clarify
confusing questions, and maintain respondents’ engagement while they slog
through a long (potentially tedious) questionnaire (Garbarski, Schaeffer, and
Dykema 2016). Thus, switching from an interviewer-administered mode to a
computer-administered one creates both opportunities and challenges.
Next, I’ll describe two approaches showing how researchers can take
advantage of the tools of the digital age to ask questions differently: mea-
suring internal states at a more appropriate time and place through eco-
logical momentary assessment (section 3.5.1) and combining the strengths
of open-ended and closed-ended survey questions through wiki surveys
(section 3.5.2). However, the move toward computer-administered, ubiq-
uitous asking will also mean that we need to design ways of asking that
are more enjoyable for participants, a process sometimes called gamification
(Section 3.5.3).
3.5.1 Ecological momentary assessments
Researchers can chop up big surveys and sprinkle them into
people’s lives.
108
CHAPTER 3

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves taking traditional surveys,
chopping them up into pieces, and sprinkling them into the lives of partici-
pants. Thus, survey questions can be asked at an appropriate time and place,
rather than in a long interview weeks after the events have occurred.
EMA is characterized by four features: (1) collection of data in real-world
environments; (2) assessments that focus on individuals’ current or very
recent states or behaviors; (3) assessments that may be event-based, time-
based, or randomly prompted (depending on the research question); and (4)
completion of multiple assessments over time (Stone and Shiffman 1994).
EMA is an approach to asking that is greatly facilitated by smartphones
with which people interact frequently throughout the day. Further, because
smartphones are packed with sensors—such as GPS and accelerometers—
it is increasingly possible to trigger measurements based on activity. For
example, a smartphone could be programmed to trigger a survey question
if a respondent goes into a particular neighborhood.
The promise of EMA is nicely illustrated by the dissertation research of
Naomi Sugie. Since the 1970s, the United States has dramatically increased
the number of people that it imprisons. As of 2005, about 500 in every
100,000 Americans were in prison, a rate of incarceration higher than
anywhere else in the world (Wakefield and Uggen 2010). The surge in the
number of people entering prison has also produced a surge in the number
leaving prison; about 700,000 people leave prison each year (Wakefield
and Uggen 2010). These people face severe challenges upon leaving prison,
and unfortunately many end up back there. In order to understand and
reduce recidivism, social scientists and policy makers need to understand
the experience of people as they re-enter society. However, these data are
hard to collect with standard survey methods because ex-offenders tend to
be difficult to study and their lives are extremely unstable. Measurement
approaches that deploy surveys every few months miss enormous amounts
of the dynamics in their lives (Sugie 2016).
In order to study the re-entry process with much greater precision, Sugie
took a standard probability sample of 131 people from the complete list
of individuals leaving prison in Newark, New Jersey. She provided each
participant with a smartphone, which became a rich data collection platform,
both for recording behavior and for asking questions. Sugie used the phones
to administer two kinds of surveys. First, she sent an “experience sampling
survey” at a randomly selected time between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. asking
ASKING QUESTIONS
109

participants about their current activities and feelings. Second, at 7 p.m., she
sent a “daily survey” asking about all the activities of that day. Further, in
addition to these survey questions, the phones recorded their geographic
location at regular intervals and kept encrypted records of call and text
metadata. Using this approach—which combines asking and observing—
Sugie was able to create a detailed, high-frequency set of measurements about
the lives of these people as they re-entered society.
Researchers believe that finding stable, high-quality employment helps
people successfully transition back into society. However, Sugie found that,
on average, her participants’ work experiences were informal, temporary, and
sporadic. This description of the average pattern, however, masks important
heterogeneity. In particular, Sugie found four distinct patterns within her
participant pool: “early exit” (those who start searching for work but then
drop out of the labor market), “persistent search” (those who spend much
of the period searching for work), “recurring work” (those who spend much
of the period working), and “low response” (those who do not respond to
the surveys regularly). The “early exit” group—those who start searching for
work but then don’t find it and stop searching—is particularly important,
because this group is probably the least likely to have a successful re-entry.
One might imagine that searching for a job after being in prison is a
difficult process, which could lead to depression and then withdrawal from
the labor market. Therefore, Sugie used her surveys to collect data about the
emotional state of participants—an internal state that is not easily estimated
from behavioral data. Surprisingly, she found that the “early exit” group did
not report higher levels of stress or unhappiness. Rather, it was the opposite:
those who continued to search for work reported more feelings of emotional
distress. All of this fine-grained, longitudinal detail about the behavior
and emotional state of the ex-offenders is important for understanding the
barriers they face and easing their transition back into society. Further, all of
this fine-grained detail would have been missed in a standard survey.
Sugie’s data collection with a vulnerable population, particularly the pas-
sive data collection, might raise some ethical concerns. But Sugie anticipated
these concerns and addressed them in her design (Sugie 2014, 2016). Her
procedures were reviewed by a third party—her university’s Institutional
Review Board—and complied with all existing rules. Further, consistent with
the principles-based approach that I advocate in chapter 6, Sugie’s approach
went far beyond what was required by existing regulations. For example, she
110
CHAPTER 3

received meaningful informed consent from each participant, she enabled
participants to temporarily turn off the geographic tracking, and she went to
great lengths to protect the data that she was collecting. In addition to using
appropriate encryption and data storage, she also obtained a Certificate of
Confidentiality from the federal government, which meant that she could
not be forced to turn over her data to the police (Beskow, Dame, and
Costello 2008). I think that because of her thoughtful approach, Sugie’s
project provides a valuable model to other researchers. In particular, she
did not stumble blindly into an ethical morass, nor did she avoid important
research because it was ethically complex. Rather, she thought carefully,
sought appropriate advice, respected her participants, and took steps to
improve the risk–benefit profile of her study.
I think there are three general lessons from Sugie’s work. First, new
approaches to asking are completely compatible with traditional methods of
sampling; recall that Sugie took a standard probability sample from a well-
defined frame population. Second, high-frequency, longitudinal measure-
ments can be particularly valuable for studying social experiences that are
irregular and dynamic. Third, when survey data collection is combined with
big data sources—something that I think will become increasingly common,
as I’ll argue later in this chapter—additional ethical issues can arise. I’ll treat
research ethics in more detail in chapter 6, but Sugie’s work shows that these
issues are addressable by conscientious and thoughtful researchers.
3.5.2 Wiki surveys
Wiki surveys enable new hybrids of closed and open questions.
In addition to asking questions at more natural times and in more natural
contexts, new technology also allows us to change the form of the questions.
Most survey questions are closed, with respondents choosing from a fixed set
of choices written by researchers. This is a process that one prominent survey
researcher calls “putting words in people’s mouths.” For example, here’s a
closed survey question:
“This next question is on the subject of work. Would you please look
at this card and tell me which thing on this list you would most prefer
in a job?
ASKING QUESTIONS
111

1. High income
2. No danger of being fired
3. Working hours are short, lots of free time
4. Chances for advancement
5. The work is important, and gives a feeling of accomplishment.”
But are these the only possible answers? Might researchers be missing
something important by limiting the responses to these five? The alternative
to closed questions is an open-ended survey question. Here’s the same
question asked in an open form:
“This next question is on the subject of work. People look for different
things in a job. What would you most prefer in a job?”
Although these two questions appear quite similar, a survey experiment by
Howard Schuman and Stanley Presser (1979) revealed that they can produce
very different results: nearly 60% of the responses to the open question are
not included in the five researcher-created responses (figure 3.9).

CHAPTER 3

Although open and closed questions can yield quite different information
and both were popular in the early days of survey research, closed questions
have come to dominate the field. This domination is not because closed
questions have been proven to provide better measurement, but rather
because they are much easier to use; the process of analyzing open-ended
questions is error-prone and expensive. The move away from open questions
is unfortunate because it is precisely the information that researchers did not
know ahead of time that can be the most valuable.
The transition from human-administered to computer-administered sur-
veys, however, suggests a new way out of this old problem. What if we could
now have survey questions that combine the best features of both open and
closed questions? That is, what if we could have a survey that both is open
to new information and produces easy-to-analyze responses? That’s exactly
what Karen Levy and I (2015) have tried to create.
In particular, Karen and I thought that websites that collect and curate
user-generated content might be able to inform the design of new types of
surveys. We were particularly inspired by Wikipedia—a wonderful example
of an open, dynamic system driven by user-generated content—so we called
our new survey a wiki survey. Just as Wikipedia evolves over time based on
the ideas of its participants, we imagined a survey that evolves over time
based on the ideas of its participants. Karen and I developed three properties
that wiki surveys should satisfy: they should be greedy, collaborative, and
adaptive. Then, with a team of web developers, we created a website that
could run wiki surveys: http://www.allourideas.org.
The data collection process in a wiki survey is illustrated by a project we
did with the New York City Mayor’s Office in order to integrate residents’
ideas into PlaNYC 2030, New York’s citywide sustainability plan. To begin
the process, the Mayor’s Office generated a list of 25 ideas based on their
previous outreach (e.g., “Require all big buildings to make certain energy
efficiency upgrades” and “Teach kids about green issues as part of school
curriculum”). Using these 25 ideas as seeds, the Mayor’s Office asked the
question “Which do you think is a better idea for creating a greener, greater
New York City?” Respondents were presented with a pair of ideas (e.g.,
“Open schoolyards across the city as public playgrounds” and “Increase
targeted tree plantings in neighborhoods with high asthma rates”) and were
asked to choose between them (figure 3.10). After choosing, respondents
were immediately presented with another randomly selected pair of ideas.

They were able to continue contributing information about their preferences
for as long as they wished either by voting or by choosing “I can’t decide.”
Crucially, at any point, respondents were able to contribute their own ideas,
which—pending approval by the Mayor’s Office—became part of the pool of
ideas to be presented to others. Thus, the questions that participants received
were both open and closed simultaneously.
The Mayor’s Office launched its wiki survey in October 2010 in con-
junction with a series of community meetings to obtain resident feedback.
Over about four months, 1,436 respondents contributed 31,893 responses
and 464 new ideas. Critically, 8 of the top 10 scoring ideas were uploaded by
participants rather than being part of the set of seed ideas from the Mayor’s
Office. And, as we describe in our paper, this same pattern, with uploaded
ideas scoring better than seed ideas, happens in many wiki surveys. In other
words, by being open to new information, researchers are able to learn things
that would have been missed using more closed approaches.
Beyond the results of these specific surveys, our wiki survey project also
illustrates how the cost structure of digital research means that researchers
can now engage with the world in somewhat different ways. Academic re-
searchers are now able to build real systems that can be used by many people:
we have hosted more than 10,000 wiki surveys and have collected more than
15 million responses. This ability to create something that can be used at scale
comes from the fact that once the website has been built, it costs basically
nothing to make it freely available to everyone in the world (of course,
this would not be true if we had human-administered interviews). Further,
this scale enables different kinds of research. For example, these 15 million
114
CHAPTER 3

responses, as well as our stream of participants, provide a valuable test-bed
for future methodological research. I’ll describe more about other research
opportunities that are created by digital-age cost structures—particularly
zero variable cost data—when I discuss experiments in Chapter 4.
3.5.3 Gamiﬁcation
Standard surveys are boring for participants; that can change, and it
must change.
So far, I’ve told you about new approaches to asking that are facilitated by
computer-administered interviews. However, one downside of computer-
administered interviews is that there is no human interviewer to help induce
and maintain participation. This is a problem because many surveys are both
time-consuming and boring. Therefore, in the future, survey designers are
going to have to design around their participants and make the process of
answering questions more enjoyable and game-like. This process is some-
times called gamification.
To illustrate what a fun survey might look like, let’s consider Friendsense,
a survey that was packaged as a game on Facebook. Sharad Goel, Winter
Mason, and Duncan Watts (2010) wanted to estimate how much people think
they are like their friends and how much they are actually like their friends.
This question about real and perceived attitude similarity gets directly at
people’s ability to accurately perceive their social environment and has
implications for political polarization and the dynamics of social change.
Conceptually, real and perceived attitude similarity is an easy thing to
measure. Researchers could ask lots of people about their opinions and then
ask their friends about their opinions (this allows for measurement of real
attitude agreement), and they could ask lots of people to guess their friends’
attitudes (this allows for measurement of perceived attitude agreement).
Unfortunately, it is logistically very difficult to interview both a respondent
and her friend. Therefore, Goel and colleagues turned their survey into a
Facebook app that was fun to play.
After a participant consented to be in a research study, the app selected a
friend from the respondent’s Facebook account and asked a question about
the attitude of that friend (figure 3.11). Intermixed with questions about
randomly selected friends, the respondent also answered questions about

herself. After answering a question about a friend, the respondent was told
whether her answer was correct or, if her friend had not answered, the
respondent was able to encourage her friend to participate. Thus, the survey
spread in part through viral recruitment.
The attitude questions were adapted from the General Social Survey.
For example, “Does [your friend] sympathize with the Israelis more than
the Palestinians in the Middle East situation?” and “Would [your friend]
pay higher taxes for the government to provide universal health care?” On
top of these serious questions, the researchers mixed in more lighthearted
questions: “Would [your friend] rather drink wine over beer?” and “Would
[your friend] rather have the power to read minds, instead of the power
to fly?” These lighthearted questions made the process more enjoyable to
participants and also enabled an interesting comparison: would attitude
agreement be similar for serious political questions and for lighthearted
questions about drinking and superpowers?
There were three main results from the study. First, friends were more
likely to give the same answer than strangers, but even close friends still
disagreed on about 30% of the questions. Second, respondents overestimated
their agreement with their friends. In other words, most of the diversity of
opinions that exists between friends is not noticed. Finally, participants were
as likely to be aware of disagreements with their friends on serious matters of
politics as with lighthearted issues about drinking and superpowers.
Although the app is unfortunately no longer available to play, it was a
nice example of how researchers can turn a standard attitude survey into
116
CHAPTER 3

something enjoyable. More generally, with some creativity and design work,
it is possible to improve user experience for survey participants. So, next time
you are designing a survey, take a moment to think about what you could
do to make the experience better for your participants. Some may fear that
these steps toward gamification could hurt data quality, but I think that bored
participants pose a far greater risk to data quality.
The work of Goel and colleagues also illustrates the theme of the next
section: linking surveys to big data sources. In this case, by linking their
survey with Facebook, the researchers automatically had access to a list of
the participants’ friends. In the next section, we will consider the linkages
between surveys and big data sources in greater detail.
3.6
Surveys linked to big data sources
Linking surveys to big data sources enables you to produce estimates
that would be impossible with either data source individually.
Most surveys are stand-alone, self-contained efforts. They don’t build on
each other, and they don’t take advantage of all of the other data that exist
in the world. This will change. There is just too much to be gained by linking
survey data to the big data sources discussed in chapter 2. By combining these
two types of data, it is often possible to do something that was impossible with
either one individually.
There are a couple of different ways in which survey data can be combined
with big data sources. In this section, I’ll describe two approaches that are
useful and distinct, and I’ll call them enriched asking and amplified asking
(figure 3.12). Although I’m going to illustrate each approach with a detailed
example, you should recognize that these are general recipes that could be
used with different types of survey data and different types of big data.
Further, you should notice that each of these examples could be viewed in
two different ways. Thinking back to the ideas in chapter 1, some people
will view these studies as examples of “custommade” survey data enhancing
“readymade” big data, and others will view them as examples of “readymade”
big data enhancing “custommade” survey data. You should be able to see
both views. Finally, you should notice how these examples clarify that surveys
and big data sources are complements and not substitutes.

Figure 3.12: Two main ways to combine big data sources and survey data. In enriched asking
(section 3.6.1), the big data source has a core measure of interest, and the survey data build the
necessary context around it. In amplified asking (section 3.6.2), the big data source does not
have a core measure of interest, but it is used to amplify the survey data.
3.6.1 Enriched asking
In enriched asking, survey data build context around a big data
source that contains some important measurements but lacks
others.
One way to combine survey data and big data sources is a process that I’ll
call enriched asking. In enriched asking, a big data source contains some
important measurements but lacks other measurements, so the researcher
collects these missing measurements in a survey and then links the two data
sources together. One example of enriched asking is the study by Burke and
Kraut (2014) about whether interacting on Facebook increases friendship
strength, which I described in section 3.2. In that case, Burke and Kraut
combined survey data with Facebook log data.
118
CHAPTER 3

The setting in which Burke and Kraut were working, however, meant
that they didn’t have to deal with two big problems that researchers doing
enriched asking typically face. First, actually linking together the individual-
level data sets, a process called record linkage, can be difficult if there
is no unique identifier in both data sources that can be use to ensure
that the correct record in one dataset is matched with the correct record
in the other dataset. The second main problem with enriched asking is
that the quality of the big data source will frequently be difficult for re-
searchers to assess because the process through which the data are created
may be proprietary and could be susceptible to many of the problems
described in chapter 2. In other words, enriched asking will frequently
involve error-prone linking of surveys to black-box data sources of un-
known quality. Despite these problems, however, enriched asking can be
used to conduct important research, as was demonstrated by Stephen
Ansolabehere and Eitan Hersh (2012) in their research on voting patterns in
the United States.
Voter turnout has been the subject of extensive research in political
science, and, in the past, researchers’ understanding of who votes and why
has generally been based on the analysis of survey data. Voting in the United
States, however, is an unusual behavior in that the government records
whether each citizen has voted (of course, the government does not record
who each citizen votes for). For many years, these governmental voting
records were available on paper forms, scattered in various local government
offices around the country. This made it very difficult, but not impossible, for
political scientists to have a complete picture of the electorate and to compare
what people say in surveys about voting with their actual voting behavior
(Ansolabehere and Hersh 2012).
But these voting records have now been digitized, and a number of private
companies have systematically collected and merged them to produce com-
prehensive master voting files that contain the voting behavior of all Amer-
icans. Ansolabehere and Hersh partnered with one of these companies—
Catalist LCC—in order to use their master voting file to help develop a better
picture of the electorate. Further, because their study relied on digital records
collected and curated by a company that had invested substantial resources
in data collection and harmonization, it offered a number of advantages over
previous efforts that had been done without the aid of companies and by
using analog records.
ASKING QUESTIONS
119

Like many of the big data sources in chapter 2, the Catalist master
file did not include much of the demographic, attitudinal, and behavioral
information that Ansolabehere and Hersh needed. In fact, they were par-
ticularly interested in comparing reported voting behavior in surveys with
validated voting behavior (i.e., the information in the Catalist database).
So Ansolabehere and Hersh collected the data that they wanted as part of
a large social survey, the CCES, mentioned earlier in this chapter. They
then gave their data to Catalist, and Catalist gave them back a merged
data file that included validated voting behavior (from Catalist), the self-
reported voting behavior (from CCES) and the demographics and attitudes
of respondents (from CCES) (figure 3.13). In other words, Ansolabehere
and Hersh combined the voting records data with survey data in order do
research that was not possible with either data source individually.
With their combined data file, Ansolabehere and Hersh came to three
important conclusions. First, over-reporting of voting is rampant: almost
half of the nonvoters reported voting, and if someone reported voting, there
is only an 80% chance that they actually voted. Second, over-reporting is
not random: over-reporting is more common among high-income, well-
educated, partisans who are engaged in public affairs. In other words, the
people who are most likely to vote are also most likely to lie about voting.
Third, and most critically, because of the systematic nature of over-reporting,
the actual differences between voters and nonvoters are smaller than they
appear just from surveys. For example, those with a bachelor’s degree are
about 22 percentage points more likely to report voting, but are only 10
percentage points more likely to actually vote. It turns out, perhaps not
surprisingly, that existing resource-based theories of voting are much better
at predicting who will report voting (which is the data that researchers have
used in the past) than they are at predicting who actually votes. Thus, the
empirical finding of Ansolabehere and Hersh (2012) call for new theories to
understand and predict voting.
But how much should we trust these results? Remember, these results
depend on error-prone linking to black-box data with unknown amounts
of error. More specifically, the results hinge on two key steps: (1) the ability
of Catalist to combine many disparate data sources to produce an accurate
master datafile and (2) the ability to link the survey data to their master
datafile. Each of these steps is quite difficult, and errors in either step could
lead researchers to the wrong conclusions. However, both data processing

datafile, Catalist combines and harmonizes information from many different sources. This
process of merging, no matter how careful, will propagate errors in the original data sources
and will introduce new errors. A second source of errors is the record linkage between
the survey data and the master datafile. If every person had a stable, unique identifier in
both data sources, then linkage would be trivial. But, Catalist had to do the linkage using
imperfect identifiers, in this case name, gender, birth year, and home address. Unfortunately,
for many cases, there could be incomplete or inaccurate information; a voter named Homer
Simpson might appear as Homer Jay Simpson, Homie J Simpson, or even Homer Sampsin.
Despite the potential for errors in the Catalist master datafile and errors in the record linkage,
Ansolabehere and Hersh were able to build confidence in their estimates through several
different types of checks.
and linking are critical to the continued existence of Catalist as a company,
so it can invest resources in solving these problems, often at a scale that
no academic researcher can match. In their paper, Ansolabehere and Hersh
go through a number of steps to check the results of these two steps—
even though some of them are proprietary—and these checks might be
helpful for other researchers wishing to link survey data to black-box big
data sources.

What are the general lessons researchers can draw from this study? First,
there is tremendous value both from enriching big data sources with survey
data and from enriching survey data with big data sources (you can see
this study either way). By combining these two data sources, the researchers
were able to do something that was impossible with either individually. The
second general lesson is that though aggregated, commercial data sources,
such as the data from Catalist, should not be considered “ground truth,” in
some cases, they can be useful. Skeptics sometimes compare these aggregated,
commercial data source with absolute Truth and point out that these data
sources fall short. However, in this case, the skeptics are making the wrong
comparison: all data that researchers use fall short of absolute Truth. Instead,
it is better to compare aggregated, commercial data sources with other
available data sources (e.g., self-reported voting behavior), which invariably
have errors as well. Finally, the third general lesson of Ansolabehere and
Hersh’s study is that in some situations, researchers can benefit from the
huge investments that many private companies are making in collecting and
harmonizing complex social data sets.
3.6.2 Ampliﬁed asking
Ampliﬁed asking using a predictive model to combine survey data
from a few people with a big data source from many people.
A different way to combine survey and big data sources is a process that
I’ll call amplified asking. In amplified asking, a researcher uses a predictive
model to combine a small amount of survey data with a big data source in
order to produce estimates at a scale or granularity that would not be possible
with either data source individually. An important example of amplified
asking comes from the work of Joshua Blumenstock, who wanted to collect
data that could help guide development in poor countries. In the past,
researchers collecting this kind of data generally had to take one of two
approaches: sample surveys or censuses. Sample surveys, where researchers
interview a small number of people, can be flexible, timely, and relatively
cheap. However, these surveys, because they are based on a sample, are
often limited in their resolution. With a sample survey, it is often hard to
make estimates about specific geographic regions or for specific demographic
groups. Censuses, on the other hand, attempt to interview everyone, and
122
CHAPTER 3

so they can be used to produce estimates for small geographic regions
or demographic groups. But censuses are generally expensive, narrow in
focus (they only include a small number of questions), and not timely (they
happen on a fixed schedule, such as every 10 years) (Kish 1979). Rather than
being stuck with sample surveys or censuses, imagine if researchers could
combine the best characteristics of both. Imagine if researchers could ask
every question to every person every day. Obviously, this ubiquitous, always-
on survey is a kind of social science fantasy. But it does appear that we
can begin to approximate this by combining survey questions from a small
number of people with digital traces from many people.
Blumenstock’s research began when he partnered with the largest mobile
phone provider in Rwanda, and the company provided anonymized transac-
tion records from about 1.5 million customers between 2005 and 2009. These
records contained information about each call and text message, such as the
start time, duration, and approximate geographic location of the caller and
receiver. Before I talk about the statistical issues, it is worth pointing out that
this first step may be one of the hardest for many researchers. As I described
in chapter 2, most big data sources are inaccessible to researchers. Telephone
metadata, in particular, are especially inaccessible because they are basically
impossible to anonymize and they almost certainly contain information that
participants would consider sensitive (Mayer, Mutchler, and Mitchell 2016;
Landau 2016). In this particular case, the researchers were careful to protect
the data, and their work was overseen by a third party (i.e., their IRB). I’ll
return to these ethical issues in more detail in chapter 6.
Blumenstock was interested in measuring wealth and well-being. But
these traits are not directly in the call records. In other words, these call
records are incomplete for this research — a common feature of big data
sources that was discussed in detail in chapter 2. However, it seems likely
that the call records probably have some information that could indirectly
provide information about wealth and well-being. Given this possibility,
Blumenstock asked whether it was possible to train a machine learning model
that could use call records to predict how someone would respond to a
survey. If this was possible, then Blumenstock could use this model to predict
the survey responses of all 1.5 million customers.
In order to build and train such a model, Blumenstock and research
assistants from Kigali Institute of Science and Technology called a random
sample of about a thousand customers. The researchers explained the goals

of the project to the participants, asked for their consent to link the survey
responses to the call records, and then asked them a series of questions to
measure their wealth and well-being, such as “Do you own a radio?” and “Do
you own a bicycle?” (see figure 3.14 for a partial list). All participants in the
survey were compensated financially.
Next, Blumenstock used a two-step procedure common in machine learn-
ing: feature engineering followed by supervised learning. First, in the feature
engineering step, for everyone that was interviewed, Blumenstock converted
the call records into a set of characteristics about each person; data scientists
might call these characteristics “features” and social scientists would call
them “variables.” For example, for each person, Blumenstock calculated the
total number of days with activity, the number of distinct people a person
has been in contact with, the amount of money spent on airtime, and so
on. Critically, good feature engineering requires knowledge of the research
setting. For example, if it is important to distinguish between domestic
and international calls (we might expect people who call internationally
to be wealthier), then this must be done at the feature engineering step.
A researcher with little understanding of Rwanda might not include this
feature, and then the predictive performance of the model would suffer.
Next, in the supervised learning step, Blumenstock built a model to predict
the survey response for each person based on their features. In this case,
Blumenstock used logistic regression, but he could have used a variety of
other statistical or machine learning approaches.
So how well did it work? Was Blumenstock able to predict answers to
survey questions like “Do you own a radio?” and “Do you own a bicy-
cle?” using features derived from call records? In order to evaluate the
performance of his predictive model, Blumenstock used cross-validation, a
technique commonly used in data science but rarely in social science. The
goal of cross-validation is to provide a fair assessment of a model’s predictive
performance by training it and testing it on different subsets of data. In
particular, Blumenstock split his data into 10 chunks of 100 people each.
Then, he used nine of the chunks to train his model, and the predictive
performance of the trained model was evaluated on the remaining chunk.
He repeated this procedure 10 times—with each chunk of data getting one
turn as the validation data—and averaged the results.
The accuracy of the predictions was high for some traits (figure 3.14); for
example, Blumenstock could predict with 97.6% accuracy if someone owned

a radio. This might sound impressive, but it is always important to compare a
complex prediction method against a simple alternative. In this case, a simple
alternative is to predict that everyone will give the most common answer. For
example, 97.3% of respondents reported owning a radio, so if Blumenstock
had predicted that everyone would report owning a radio, he would have
had an accuracy of 97.3%, which is surprisingly similar to the performance
of his more complex procedure (97.6% accuracy). In other words, all the
fancy data and modeling increased the accuracy of the prediction from 97.3%
to 97.6%. However, for other questions, such as “Do you own a bicycle?”,
the predictions improved from 54.4% to 67.6%. More generally, figure 3.15
shows that for some traits Blumenstock did not improve much beyond just
making the simple baseline prediction, but that for other traits there was
some improvement. Looking just at these results, however, you might not
think that this approach is particularly promising.
However, just one year later, Blumenstock and two colleagues—Gabriel
Cadamuro and Robert On—published a paper in Science with substan-
tially better results (Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On 2015). There were
two main technical reasons for this improvement: (1) they used more

sophisticated methods (i.e., a new approach to feature engineering and a
more sophisticated model to predict responses from features) and (2) rather
than attempting to infer responses to individual survey questions (e.g., “Do
you own a radio?”), they attempted to infer a composite wealth index. These
technical improvements meant that they could do a reasonable job of using
call records to predict wealth for the people in their sample.
Predicting the wealth of people in the sample, however, was not the
ultimate goal of their research. Remember that the ultimate goal was to
combine some of the best features of sample surveys and censuses to produce
accurate, high-resolution estimates of poverty in developing countries. To
assess their ability to achieve this goal, Blumenstock and colleagues used their
model and their data to predict the wealth of all 1.5 million people in the call
records. And they used the geospatial information embedded in the call data
(recall that the data included the location of the nearest cell tower for each
call) to estimate the approximate place of residence of each person (figure
3.16). Putting these two estimates together, Blumenstock and colleagues
produced an estimate of the geographic distribution of subscriber wealth

from the phone company were converted to a matrix with one row for each person and
one column for each feature (i.e., variable). Next, the researchers built a supervised learning
model to predict the survey responses from the person-by-feature matrix. Then, the supervised
learning model was used to impute the survey responses for all 1.5 million customers. Also,
the researchers estimated the approximate place of residence for all 1.5 million customers
based on the locations of their calls. When these two estimates—the estimated wealth and the
estimated place of residence—were combined, the results were similar to estimates from the

at extremely fine spatial granularity. For example, they could estimate the
average wealth in each of Rwanda’s 2,148 cells (the smallest administrative
unit in the country).
How well did these estimates match up to the actual level of poverty in
these regions? Before I answer that question, I want to emphasize the fact
that there are a lot of reasons to be skeptical. For example, the ability to make
predictions at the individual level was pretty noisy (figure 3.17). And, perhaps
more importantly, people with mobile phones might be systematically differ-
ent from people without mobile phones. Thus, Blumenstock and colleagues
might suffer from types of coverage errors similar to those that biased the
1936 Literary Digest survey that I described earlier.

Figure 3.17: Results from Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On (2015). At the individual level,
the researchers were able to do a reasonable job at predicting someone’s wealth from their
call records. The estimates of district-level wealth for Rwanda’s 30 districts—which were
based on individual-level estimates of wealth and place of residence—were similar to results
from the Demographic and Health Survey, a gold-standard traditional survey. Adapted from
Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On (2015), figures 1a and 3c.
To get a sense of the quality of their estimates, Blumenstock and colleagues
needed to compare them with something else. Fortunately, around the same
time as their study, another group of researchers was running a more
traditional social survey in Rwanda. This other survey—which was part
of the widely respected Demographic and Health Survey program—had
a large budget and used high-quality, traditional methods. Therefore, the
estimates from the Demographic and Health Survey could reasonably be
considered gold-standard estimates. When the two estimates were compared,
they were quite similar (figure 3.17). In other words, by combining a small
amount of survey data with the call records, Blumenstock and colleagues
were able to produce estimates comparable to those from gold-standard
approaches.
A skeptic might see these results as a disappointment. After all, one way
of viewing them is to say that by using big data and machine learning,
Blumenstock and colleagues were able to produce estimates that could be
made more reliably by already existing methods. But I don’t think that this is
the right way to think about this study, for two reasons. First, the estimates
from Blumenstock and colleagues were about 10 times faster and 50 times
128
CHAPTER 3

cheaper (when cost is measured in terms of variable costs). As I argued
earlier in this chapter, researchers ignore cost at their peril. In this case, for
example, the dramatic decrease in cost means that rather than being run
every few years—as is standard for Demographic and Health Surveys—this
kind of survey could be run every month, which would provide numerous
advantages for researchers and policy makers. The second reason not to take
the skeptic’s view is that this study provides a basic recipe that can be tailored
to many different research situations. This recipe has only two ingredients
and two steps. The ingredients are (1) a big data source that is wide but
thin (i.e., it has many people but not the information that you need about
each person) and (2) a survey that is narrow but thick (i.e., it has only a few
people, but it does have the information that you need about those people).
These ingredients are then combined in two steps. First, for the people in
both data sources, build a machine learning model that uses digital trace data
to predict survey answers. Next, use that model to infer the survey answers
of everyone in the big data source. Thus, if there is some question that you
want to ask lots of people, look for a big data source from those people that
might be used to predict their answer, even if you don’t care about that big
data source. That is, Blumenstock and colleagues didn’t inherently care about
call records; they only cared about call records because these could be used
to predict survey answers that they cared about. This characteristic—only
indirect interest in the big data source—makes amplified asking different
from embedded asking, which I described earlier.
In conclusion, Blumenstock’s amplified asking approach combined survey
data with call data to produce estimates comparable to those from a gold-
standard survey. This particular example also clarifies some of the trade-
offs between amplified asking and traditional survey methods. The amplified
asking estimates were more timely, substantially cheaper, and more granular.
But, on the other hand, there is not yet a strong theoretical basis for this kind
of amplified asking. This single example does not show when this approach
will work and when it won’t, and researchers using this approach need to be
especially concerned about possible biases caused by who is included—and
who is not included—in their big data source. Further, the amplified asking
approach does not yet have good ways to quantify uncertainty around its
estimates. Fortunately, amplified asking has deep connections to three large
areas in statistics—small area estimation (Rao and Molina 2015), imputation
(Rubin 2004), and model-based post-stratification (which itself is closely
ASKING QUESTIONS
129

related to Mr. P., the method I described earlier in the chapter) (Little 1993).
Because of these deep connections, I expect that many of the methodological
foundations of amplified asking will soon be improved.
Finally, comparing Blumenstock’s first and second attempts also illustrates
an important lesson about digital-age social research: the beginning is not
the end. That is, many times, the first approach will not be the best, but if
researchers continue working, things can get better. More generally, when
evaluating new approaches to social research in the digital age, it is important
to make two distinct evaluations: (1) How well does this work now? (2)
How well will this work in the future as the data landscape changes and as
researchers devote more attention to the problem? Although researchers are
trained to make the first kind of evaluation (about how good a particular
piece of research is), the second is often more important.
3.7
Conclusion
The transition from the analog age to the digital age is creating new
opportunities for survey researchers. In this chapter, I’ve argued that big
data sources will not replace surveys and that the abundance of big data
sources increases—not decreases—the value of surveys (section 3.2). Next,
I summarized the total survey error framework that was developed during
the first two eras of survey research, and that can help researchers develop
and evaluate third-era approaches (section 3.3). Three areas where I expect to
see exciting opportunities are (1) non-probability sampling (section 3.4), (2)
computer-administrated interviews (section 3.5), and (3) linking surveys and
big data sources (section 3.6). Survey research has always evolved, driven by
changes in technology and society. We should embrace that evolution, while
continuing to draw wisdom from earlier eras.
Mathematical notes
In this appendix, I will describe some of the ideas from the chapter in a
slightly more mathematical form. The goal here is to help you get comfortable
with the notation and mathematical framework used by survey researchers so
that you can transition to some of more technical material written on these
topics. I will start by introducing probability sampling, then move to proba-
bility sampling with nonresponse, and finally, non-probability sampling.
130
CHAPTER 3

Probability sampling
As a running example, let’s consider the goal of estimating the unemploy-
ment rate in the United States. Let U = {1, . . . , k, . . . , N} be the target pop-
ulation and let yk be the value of the outcome variable for the person
k. In this example, yk is whether person k is unemployed. Finally, let
F = {1, . . . , k, . . . , N} be the frame population, which for the sake of sim-
plicity is assumed to be the same as the target population.
A basic sampling design is simple random sampling without replacement.
In this case, each person is equally likely to be included in the sample
s = {1, . . . , i, . . . , n}. When the data are collected with this sampling design,
a researchers can estimate the population unemployment rate with the
sample mean:
ˆ¯y =

i∈s yi
n
(3.1)
where ¯y is the unemployment rate in the population and ˆ¯y is the estimate of
the unemployment rate (theˆis commonly used to indicate an estimator).
In reality, researchers rarely use simple random sampling without replace-
ment. For a variety of reasons (one of which I’ll describe in a moment),
researchers often create samples with unequal probabilities of inclusion. For
example, researchers might select people in Florida with higher probability
of inclusion than people in California. In this case, the sample mean (eq. 3.1)
might not be a good estimator. Instead, when there are unequal probabilities
of inclusion, researchers use
ˆ¯y = 1
N

i∈s
yi
πi
(3.2)
where ˆ¯y is the estimate of the unemployment rate and πi is person i’s
probability of inclusion. Following standard practice, I’ll call the estimator in
eq. 3.2 the Horvitz–Thompson estimator. The Horvitz–Thompson estimator
is extremely useful because it leads to unbiased estimates for any probabil-
ity sampling design (Horvitz and Thompson 1952). Because the Horvitz–
Thompson estimator comes up so frequently, it is helpful to notice that it can
be rewritten as
ˆ¯y = 1
N

i∈s
wi yi
(3.3)
ASKING QUESTIONS
131

where wi = 1/πi. As eq. 3.3 reveals, the Horvitz–Thompson estimator
is a weighted sample mean where the weights are inversely related to the
probability of selection. In other words, the less likely a person is to be
included in the sample, the more weight that person should get in the
estimate.
As described earlier, researchers often sample people with unequal prob-
abilities of inclusion. One example of a design that can lead to unequal
probabilities of inclusion is stratified sampling, which is important to un-
derstand because it is closely related to the estimation procedure called post-
stratification. In stratified sampling, a researcher splits the target population
into H mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups. These groups are called
strata and are indicated as U1, . . . , Uh, . . . , UH. In this example, the strata
are states. The sizes of the groups are indicated as N1, . . . , Nh, . . . , NH.
A researcher might want to use stratified sampling in order to make sure
that she has enough people in each state to make state-level estimates of
unemployment.
Once the population has been split up into strata, assume that the
researcher selects a simple random sample without replacement of size nh,
independently from each strata. Further, assume that everyone selected in the
sample becomes a respondent (I’ll handle nonresponse in the next section).
In this case, the probability of inclusion is
πi = nh
Nh
for all i ∈h
(3.4)
Because these probabilities can vary from person to person, when making
an estimate from this sampling design, researchers need to weight each
respondent by the inverse of their probability of inclusion using the Horvitz–
Thompson estimator (eq. 3.2).
Even though the Horvitz–Thompson estimator is unbiased, researchers
can produce more accurate (i.e., lower-variance) estimates by combining
the sample with auxiliary information. Some people find it surprising that
this is true even when there is perfectly executed probability sampling.
These techniques using auxiliary information are particularly important
because, as I will show later, auxiliary information is critical for making esti-
mates from probability samples with nonresponse and from non-probability
samples.
132
CHAPTER 3

One common technique for utilizing auxiliary information is post-
stratification. Imagine, for example, that a researcher knows the number of
men and women in each of the 50 states; we can denote these group sizes
as N1, N2, . . . , N100. To combine this auxiliary information with the sample,
the researcher can split the sample into H groups (in this case 100), make an
estimate for each group, and then create a weighted average of these group
means:
ˆ¯ypost =

h∈H
Nh
N
ˆ¯yh
(3.5)
Roughly, the estimator in eq. 3.5 is likely to be more accurate, because it
uses the known population information (the Nh) to correct estimates if an
unbalanced sample happens to be selected. One way to think about it is
that post-stratification is like approximating stratification after the data have
already been collected.
In conclusion, this section has described a few sampling designs: simple
random sampling without replacements, sampling with unequal probabil-
ity, and stratified sampling. It has also described two main ideas about
estimation: the Horvitz–Thompson estimator and post-stratification. For a
more formal definition of probability sampling designs, see chapter 2 of
Särndal, Swensson, and Wretman (2003). For a more formal and complete
treatment of stratified sampling, see section 3.7 of Särndal, Swensson, and
Wretman (2003). For a technical description of the properties of the Horvitz–
Thompson estimator, see Horvitz and Thompson (1952), Overton and
Stehman (1995), or section 2.8 of Särndal, Swensson, and Wretman (2003).
For a more formal treatment of post-stratification, see Holt and Smith
(1979), Smith (1991), Little (1993), or section 7.6 of Särndal, Swensson, and
Wretman (2003).
Probability sampling with nonresponse
Almost all real surveys have nonresponse; that is, not everyone in the sample
population answers every question. There are two main kinds of nonre-
sponse: item nonresponse and unit nonresponse. In item nonresponse, some
respondents don’t answer some items (e.g., sometimes respondents don’t
want to answer questions that they consider sensitive). In unit nonresponse,
ASKING QUESTIONS
133

some people that are selected into the sample population don’t respond to
the survey at all. The two most common reasons for unit nonresponse are
that the sampled person cannot be contacted and that the sample person
is contacted but refuses to participate. In this section, I will focus on unit
nonresponse; readers interested in item nonresponse should see Little and
Rubin (2002).
Researchers often think about surveys with unit nonresponse as a two-
stage sampling process. In the first stage, the researcher selects a sample s
such that each person has a probability of inclusion πi (where 0 < πi ≤1).
Then, in the second stage, people who are selected into the sample respond
with probability φi (where 0 < φi ≤1). This two-stage process results
in the final set of respondents r. An important difference between these
two stages is that researchers control the process of selecting the sample,
but they don’t control which of those sampled people become respondents.
Putting these two processes together, the probability that someone will be
a respondent is
pr(i ∈r) = πiφi
(3.6)
For the sake of simplicity, I’ll consider the case where the original sample
design is simple random sampling without replacement. If a researcher
selects a sample of size ns that yields nr respondents, and if the researcher
ignores nonresponse and uses the mean of the respondents, then the bias of
estimate will be
bias of sample mean = cor(φ, y)S(y)S(φ)
¯φ
(3.7)
where cor(φ, y) is the population correlation between the response propen-
sity and the outcome (e.g., unemployment status), S(y) is the population
standard deviation of the outcome (e.g., unemployment status), S(φ) is
the population standard deviation of the response propensity, and ¯φ is the
population mean response propensity (Bethlehem, Cobben, and Schouten
2011, section 2.2.4).
Equation 3.7 shows that nonresponse will not introduce bias if any of the
following conditions are met:
• There is no variation in unemployment status (S(y) = 0).
• There is no variation in response propensities (S(φ) = 0).
134
CHAPTER 3

• There is no correlation between response propensity and unemploy-
ment status (cor(φ, y) = 0).
Unfortunately, none of these conditions seems likely. It seems implausible
that there will be no variation in employment status or that there will be
no variation in response propensities. Thus, the key term in eq. 3.7 is the
correlation, cor(φ, y). For example, if people are who unemployed are more
likely to respond, then the estimated employment rate will be biased upward.
The trick to making estimates when there is nonresponse is to use
auxiliary information. For example, one way in which you can use auxiliary
information is post-stratification (recall eq. 3.5 from above). It turns out that
the bias of the post-stratification estimator is
bias(ˆ¯ypost) = 1
N
H

h=1
Nh cor(φ, y)(h)S(y)(h)S(φ)(h)

(3.8)
where cor(φ, y)(h), S(y)(h), S(φ)(h), and ¯φ(h) are defined as above but
restricted to people in group h (Bethlehem, Cobben, and Schouten 2011,
section 8.2.1). Thus, the overall bias will be small if the bias in each post-
stratification group is small. There are two ways that I like to think about
making the bias small in each post-stratification group. First, you want to
try to form homogeneous groups where there is little variation in response
propensity (S(φ)(h) ≈0) and the outcome (S(y)(h) ≈0). Second, you want
to form groups where the people that you see are like the people that you
don’t see (cor(φ, y)(h) ≈0). Comparing eqs. 3.7 and 3.8 helps clarify when
post-stratification can reduce the biased caused by nonresponse.
In conclusion, this section has provided a model for probability sampling
with nonresponse and has shown the bias that nonresponse can introduce
both without and with post-stratification adjustments. Bethlehem (1988) of-
fers a derivation of the bias caused by nonresponse for more general sampling
designs. For more on using post-stratification to adjust for nonresponse, see
Smith (1991) and Gelman and Carlin (2002). Post-stratification is part of a
more general family of techniques called calibration estimators, see Zhang
(2000) for an article-length treatment and Särndal and Lundström (2005)
for a book-length treatment. For more on other other weighting methods
for adjusting for nonresponse, see Kalton and Flores-Cervantes (2003), Brick
(2013), and Särndal and Lundström (2005).

Non-probability sampling
Non-probability sampling includes a huge variety of designs (Baker et al.
2013). Focusing specifically on the sample of Xbox users by Wang and
colleagues (Wang et al. 2015), you can think of that kind of sample as one
where the key part of the sampling design is not the πi (the researcher-
driven probability of inclusion) but the φi (the respondent-driven response
propensities). Naturally, this is not ideal because the φi are unknown. But,
as Wang and colleagues showed, this kind of opt-in sample—even from a
sampling frame with enormous coverage error—need not be catastrophic if
the researcher has good auxiliary information and a good statistical model to
account for these problems.
Bethlehem (2010) extends many of the above derivations about post-
stratification to include both nonresponse and coverage errors. In addition
to post-stratification, other techniques for working with non-probability
samples—and probability samples with coverage errors and nonresponse—
include sample matching (Ansolabehere and Rivers 2013; Bethlehem 2015),
propensity score weighting (Lee 2006; Schonlau et al. 2009), and calibration
(Lee and Valliant 2009). One common theme among these techniques is the
use of the auxiliary information.

Many of the themes in this chapter have also been echoed in recent presidential
addresses at the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR),
such as those by Dillman (2002), Newport (2011), Santos (2014), and Link
(2015).
For more on the differences between survey research and in-depth interviews,
see Small (2009). Related to in-depth interviews is a family of approaches called
ethnography. In ethnographic research, researchers generally spend much more
time with participants in their natural environment. For more on the differences
between ethnography and in-depth interviews, see Jerolmack and Khan (2014).
For more on digital ethnography, see Pink et al. (2015).
My description of the history of survey research is far too brief to include
many of the exciting developments that have taken place. For more historical
background, see Smith (1976), Converse (1987), and Igo (2008). For more on
the idea of three eras of survey research, see Groves (2011) and Dillman, Smyth,
and Christian (2008) (which breaks up the three eras slightly differently).

CHAPTER 3

Groves and Kahn (1979) offer a peek inside the transition from the first to
the second era in survey research by doing a detailed head-to-head comparison
between a face-to-face and telephone survey. Brick and Tucker (2007) look back
at the historical development of random-digit-dialing sampling methods.
For more on how survey research has changed in the past in response to
changes in society, see Tourangeau (2004), Mitofsky (1989), and Couper (2011).
• Asking versus observing (section 3.2)
The strengths and weaknesses of asking and observing have been debated
by psychologists (e.g., Baumeister, Vohs, and Funder 2007) and sociologists
(e.g., Jerolmack and Khan 2014; Maynard 2014; Cerulo 2014; Vaisey 2014).
The difference between asking and observing also arises in economics, where
researchers talk about stated and revealed preferences. For example, a researcher
could ask respondents whether they prefer eating ice cream or going to the gym
(stated preferences), or could observe how often people eat ice cream and go to
the gym (revealed preferences). There is deep skepticism about certain types of
stated preferences data in economics, as described in Hausman (2012).
A main theme from these debates is that reported behavior is not always
accurate. But, as was described in chapter 2, big data sources may not be accurate,
they may not be collected on a sample of interest, and they may not be accessible
to researchers. Thus, I think that, in some situations, reported behavior can be
useful. Further, a second main theme from these debates is that reports about
emotions, knowledge, expectations, and opinions are not always accurate. But,
if information about these internal states is needed by researchers—either to
help explain some behavior or as the thing to be explained—then asking may
be appropriate. Of course, learning about internal states by asking questions can
be problematic because sometimes the respondents themselves are not aware of
their internal states (Nisbett and Wilson 1977).
• Total survey error (section 3.3)
Chapter 1 of Groves (2004) does an excellent job reconciling the occasionally
inconsistent terminology used by survey researchers to describe the total survey
error framework. For a book-length treatment of the total survey error frame-
work, see Groves et al. (2009), and for a historical overview, see Groves and
Lyberg (2010).
The idea of decomposing errors into bias and variance also comes up
in machine learning; see, for example, section 7.3 of Hastie, Tibshirani, and
Friedman (2009). This often leads researchers to talk about a “bias–variance”
trade-off.
In terms of representation, a great introduction to the issues of nonresponse
and nonresponse bias is the National Research Council report Nonresponse in
Social Science Surveys: A Research Agenda (2013). Another useful overview is
ASKING QUESTIONS

provided by Groves (2006). Also, entire special issues of the Journal of Official
Statistics, Public Opinion Quarterly, and the Annals of the American Academy
of Political and Social Science have been published on the topic of nonresponse.
Finally, there are actually many different ways of calculating the response rate;
these approaches are described in detail in a report by the American Association
of Public Opinion Researchers (AAPOR) (2016).
For more on the 1936 Literary Digest poll, see Bryson (1976), Squire (1988),
Cahalan (1989), and Lusinchi (2012). For another discussion of this poll as a
parable warning against haphazard data collection, see Gayo-Avello (2011). In
1936, George Gallup used a more sophisticated form of sampling and was able to
produce more accurate estimates with a much smaller sample. Gallup’s success
over the Literary Digest was a milestone in the development of survey research,
as is described in chapter 3 of Converse (1987), chapter 4 of Ohmer (2006), and
chapter 3 of Igo (2008).
In terms of measurement, a great first resource for designing questionnaires
is Bradburn, Sudman, and Wansink (2004). For more advanced treatments, see
Schuman and Presser (1996), which is specifically focused on attitude questions,
and Saris and Gallhofer (2014), which is more general. A slightly different
approach to measurement is taken in psychometrics, as described in Rust and
Golombok (2009). More on pretesting is available in Presser and Blair (1994),
Presser et al. (2004), and chapter 8 of Groves et al. (2009). For more on survey
experiments, see Mutz (2011).
In terms of cost, the classic, book-length treatment of the trade-off between
survey costs and survey errors is Groves (2004).
• Who to ask (section 3.4)
Two classic book-length treatments of standard probability sampling and es-
timation are Lohr (2009) (more introductory) and Särndal, Swensson, and
Wretman (2003) (more advanced). A classic book-length treatment of post-
stratification and related methods is Särndal and Lundström (2005). In some
digital-age settings, researchers know quite a bit about nonrespondents, which
was not often true in the past. Different forms of nonresponse adjustment are
possible when researchers have information about nonrespondents, as described
by Kalton and Flores-Cervantes (2003) and Smith (2011).
The Xbox study by Wang et al. (2015) uses a technique called multilevel
regression and post-stratification (“Mr. P.”) that allows researchers to estimate
group means even when there are many, many groups. Although there is some
debate about the quality of the estimates from this technique, it seems like a
promising area to explore. The technique was first used in Park, Gelman, and
Bafumi (2004), and there has been subsequent use and debate (Gelman 2007;
Lax and Phillips 2009; Pacheco 2011; Buttice and Highton 2013; Toshkov 2015).
For more on the connection between individual weights and group weights, see
Gelman (2007).
138
CHAPTER 3

For other approaches to weighting web surveys, see Schonlau et al. (2009),
Bethlehem (2010), and Valliant and Dever (2011). Online panels can use either
probability sampling or non-probability sampling. For more on online panels,
see Callegaro et al. (2014).
Sometimes, researchers have found that probability samples and non-
probability samples yield estimates of similar quality (Ansolabehere and
Schaffner 2014), but other comparisons have found that non-probability samples
do worse (Malhotra and Krosnick 2007; Yeager et al. 2011). One possible
reason for these differences is that non-probability samples have improved
over time. For a more pessimistic view of non-probability sampling methods,
see the AAPOR Task Force on Non-Probability Sampling (Baker et al. 2013),
and I also recommend reading the commentary that follows the summary
report.
• How to ask (section 3.5)
Conrad and Schober (2008) is an edited volume titled Envisioning the Survey
Interview of the Future, and it offers a variety of viewpoints about the future of
asking questions. Couper (2011) addresses similar themes, and Schober et al.
(2015) offer a nice example of how data collection methods that are tailored to a
new setting can result in higher quality data. Schober and Conrad (2015) offer a
more general argument about continuing to adjust the process of survey research
to match changes in society.
Tourangeau and Yan (2007) review issues of social desirability bias in
sensitive questions, and Lind et al. (2013) offer some possible reasons why
people might disclose more sensitive information in a computer-administered
interview. For more on the role of human interviewers in increasing participa-
tion rates in surveys, see Maynard and Schaeffer (1997), Maynard, Freese, and
Schaeffer (2010), Conrad et al. (2013), and Schaeffer et al. (2013). For more on
mixed-mode surveys, see Dillman, Smyth, and Christian (2014).
Stone et al. (2007) offer a book-length treatment of ecological momentary
assessment and related methods.
For more advice on making surveys an enjoyable and valuable experience for
participants, see work on the Tailored Design Method (Dillman, Smyth, and
Christian 2014). For another interesting example of using Facebook apps for
social science surveys, see Bail (2015).
• Surveys linked to big data sources (section 3.6)
Judson (2007) describes the process of combining surveys and administrative
data as “information integration” and discusses some advantages of this ap-
proach, as well as offering some examples.
Regarding enriched asking, there have been many previous attempts to
validate voting. For an overview of that literature, see Belli et al. (1999),
ASKING QUESTIONS

Ansolabehere and Hersh (2012), Hanmer, Banks, and White (2014), and
Berent, Krosnick, and Lupia (2016). See Berent, Krosnick, and Lupia (2016)
for a more skeptical view of the results presented in Ansolabehere and Hersh
(2012).
It is important to note that although Ansolabehere and Hersh were en-
couraged by the quality of data from Catalist, other evaluations of commercial
vendors have been less enthusiastic. Pasek et al. (2014) found poor quality
when data from a survey were compared with a consumer file from Marketing
Systems Group (which itself merged together data from three providers: Acxiom,
Experian, and InfoUSA). That is, the datafile did not match survey responses
that researchers expected to be correct, the consumer file had missing data for
a large number of questions, and the missing data pattern was correlated with
the reported survey value (in other words, the missing data were systematic, not
random).
For more on record linkage between surveys and administrative data, see
Sakshaug and Kreuter (2012) and Schnell (2013). For more on record linkage in
general, see Dunn (1946) and Fellegi and Sunter (1969) (historical) and Larsen
and Winkler (2014) (modern). Similar approaches have also been developed
in computer science under names such as data deduplication, instance iden-
tification, name matching, duplicate detection, and duplicate record detection
(Elmagarmid, Ipeirotis, and Verykios 2007). There are also privacy-preserving
approaches to record linkage that do not require the transmission of personally
identifying information (Schnell 2013). Researchers at Facebook developed a
procedure to probabilistically link their records to voting behavior (Jones et al.
2013); this linkage was done to evaluate an experiment that I’ll tell you about in
chapter 4 (Bond et al. 2012). For more on obtaining consent for record linkage,
see Sakshaug et al. (2012).
Another example of linking a large-scale social survey to government admin-
istrative records comes from the Health and Retirement Survey and the Social
Security Administration. For more on that study, including information about
the consent procedure, see Olson (1996, 1999).
The process of combining many sources of administrative records into a
master datafile—the process that Catalist employs—is common in the statistical
offices of some national governments. Two researchers from Statistics Sweden
have written a detailed book on the topic (Wallgren and Wallgren 2007).
For an example of this approach in a single county in the United States
(Olmstead County, Minnesota, home of the Mayo Clinic), see Sauver et al.
(2011). For more on errors that can appear in administrative records, see Groen
(2012).
Another way in which researchers can use big data sources in survey research
is as a sampling frame for people with specific characteristics. Unfortunately,
this approach can raise questions related to privacy (Beskow, Sandler, and
Weinberger 2006).

CHAPTER 3

Regarding amplified asking, this approach is not as new as it might appear
from how I’ve described it. It has deep connections to three large areas in
statistics: model-based post-stratification (Little 1993), imputation (Rubin 2004),
and small area estimation (Rao and Molina 2015). It is also related to the use of
surrogate variables in medical research (Pepe 1992).
The cost and time estimates in Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On (2015) refer
more to variable cost—the cost of one additional survey—and do not include
fixed costs such as the cost of cleaning and processing the call data. In general,
amplified asking will probably have high fixed costs and low variable costs
similar to those of digital experiments (see chapter 4). For more on mobile
phone-based surveys in developing countries, see Dabalen et al. (2016).
For ideas about how to do amplified asking better, I’d recommend learning
more about multiple imputation (Rubin 2004). Also, if researchers doing ampli-
fied asking care about aggregate counts, rather than individual-level traits, then
the approaches in King and Lu (2008) and Hopkins and King (2010) may be
useful. Finally, for more about the machine learning approaches in Blumenstock,
Cadamuro, and On (2015), see James et al. (2013) (more introductory) or Hastie,
Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009) (more advanced).
One ethical issue regarding amplified asking is that it can be used to infer
sensitive traits that people might not choose to reveal in a survey, as described by
Kosinski, Stillwell, and Graepel (2013).

attitudinal questions drawn from the General Social Survey (GSS) and select
surveys by the Pew Research Center to a non-probability sample of respondents
drawn from Amazon Mechanical Turk. They then adjusted for the nonrepre-
sentativeness of data using model-based post-stratification, and compared the
adjusted estimates with those from the probability-based GSS and Pew surveys.

This is an interesting setting in which researchers can compare self-reported
behavior with logged behavior (see, e.g., Boase and Ling (2013)). Two common
behaviors to ask about are calling and texting, and two common time frames are
“yesterday” and “in the past week.”

• “How many text messages did you send yesterday?”

• “How many times did you use your mobile phone to send or receive text

d) Once this microsurvey has been completed, ask to check their usage data
as logged by their phone or service provider. How does self-report usage
compare to log data? Which is most accurate? Which is least accurate?
e) Now combine the data that you have collected with the data from other

] Schuman and Presser (1996) argue that question orders would
matter for two types of questions: part–part questions where two questions are
at the same level of specificity (e.g., ratings of two presidential candidates) and
part–whole questions where a general question follows a more specific question
(e.g., asking “How satisfied are you with your work?” followed by “How satisfied
are you with your life?”).
They further characterize two types of question order effect; consistency
effects occur when responses to a later question are brought closer (than they
would otherwise be) to those given to an earlier question; contrast effects occur
when there are greater differences between responses to two questions.
a) Create a pair of part-part questions that you think will have a large question
order effect; a pair of part–whole questions that you think will have a large
order effect; and a pair of questions whose order you think would not
matter. Run a survey experiment on MTurk to test your questions.
b) How large a part–part effect were you able to create? Was it a consistency
or contrast effect?

or contrast effect?

order would matter?

] Building on the work of Schuman and Presser, Moore (2002)
describes a separate dimension of question order effect: additive and subtractive
effects. While contrast and consistency effects are produced as a consequence of
respondents’ evaluations of the two items in relation to each other, additive and
subtractive effects are produced when respondents are made more sensitive to
the larger framework within which the questions are posed. Read Moore (2002),
then design and run a survey experiment on MTurk to demonstrate additive or
subtractive effects.

sources (these sources can be different from the four sources used in Antoun
et al. (2015)).

] In an effort to predict the results of the 2016 EU Referendum (i.e., Brexit),
YouGov—an Internet-based market research firm—conducted online polls of a
panel of about 800,000 respondents in the United Kingdom.
A detailed description of YouGov’s statistical model can be found
at https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/21/yougov-referendum-model/. Roughly
speaking, YouGov partitioned voters into types based on 2015 general election
vote choice, age, qualifications, gender, and date of interview, as well as the
constituency in which they lived. First, they used data collected from the YouGov
panelists to estimate, among those who voted, the proportion of people of each
voter type who intended to vote Leave. They estimated the turnout of each voter
type by using the 2015 British Election Study (BES), a post-election face-to-face
survey, which validated turnout from the electoral rolls. Finally, they estimated
how many people there were of each voter type in the electorate, based on the
latest Census and Annual Population Survey (with some additional information
from other data sources).
Three days before the vote, YouGov showed a two-point lead for Leave.
On the eve of voting, the poll indicated that the result was too close to call
(49/51 Remain). The final on-the-day study predicted 48/52 in favor of Remain

what could have gone wrong.
b) YouGov’s response after the election (https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/

part due to turnout—something that we have said all along would be
crucial to the outcome of such a finely balanced race. Our turnout
model was based, in part, on whether respondents had voted at the last
general election and a turnout level above that of general elections upset
the model, particularly in the North.” Does this change your answer

CHAPTER 4
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
4.1
Introduction
In the approaches covered so far in this book—observing behavior (chap-
ter 2) and asking questions (chapter 3)—researchers collect data without
intentionally and systematically changing the world. The approach covered
in this chapter—running experiments—is fundamentally different. When
researchers run experiments, they systematically intervene in the world to
create data that are ideally suited to answering questions about cause-and-
effect relationships.
Cause-and-effect questions are very common in social research, and
examples include questions such as: Does increasing teacher salaries increase
student learning? What is the effect of minimum wage on employment rates?
How does a job applicant’s race affect her chance of getting a job? In addition
to these explicitly causal questions, sometimes cause-and-effect questions are
implicit in more general questions about maximization of some performance
metric. For example, the question “What color should the donate button be
on an NGO’s website?” is really lots of questions about the effect of different
button colors on donations.
One way to answer cause-and-effect questions is to look for patterns in
existing data. For example, returning to the question about the effect of
teacher salaries on student learning, you might calculate that students learn
more in schools that offer high teacher salaries. But, does this correlation
show that higher salaries cause students to learn more? Of course not.
Schools where teachers earn more might be different in many ways. For
example, students in schools with high teacher salaries might come from
wealthier families. Thus, what looks like an effect of teachers could just come
from comparing different types of students. These unmeasured differences
between students are called confounders, and, in general, the possibility of
147

confounders wreaks havoc on researchers’ ability to answer cause-and-effect
questions by looking for patterns in existing data.
One solution to the problem of confounders is to try to make fair
comparisons by adjusting for observable differences between groups. For
example, you might be able to download property tax data from a number
of government websites. Then, you could compare student performance in
schools where home prices are similar but teacher salaries are different,
and you still might find that students learn more in schools with higher
teacher pay. But there are still many possible confounders. Maybe the parents
of these students differ in their level of education. Or maybe the schools
differ in their closeness to public libraries. Or maybe the schools with higher
teacher pay also have higher pay for principals, and principal pay, not teacher
pay, is really what is increasing student learning. You could try to measure
and adjust for these factors as well, but the list of possible confounders is
essentially endless. In many situations, you just cannot measure and adjust
for all the possible confounders. In response to this challenge, researchers
have developed a number of techniques for making causal estimates from
non-experimental data—I discussed some of them in chapter 2—but, for
certain kinds of questions, these techniques are limited, and experiments
offer a promising alternative.
Experiments enable researchers to move beyond the correlations in nat-
urally occurring data in order to reliably answer certain cause-and-effect
questions. In the analog age, experiments were often logistically difficult and
expensive. Now, in the digital age, logistical constraints are gradually fading
away. Not only is it easier to do experiments like those done in the past, it is
now possible to run new kinds of experiments.
In what I’ve written so far I’ve been a bit loose in my language, but it is
important to distinguish between two things: experiments and randomized
controlled experiments. In an experiment, a researcher intervenes in the
world and then measures an outcome. I’ve heard this approach described
as “perturb and observe.” In a randomized controlled experiment a researcher
intervenes for some people and not for others, and the researcher decides
which people receive the intervention by randomization (e.g., flipping a
coin). Randomized controlled experiments create fair comparisons between
two groups: one that has received the intervention and one that has not. In
other words, randomized controlled experiments are a solution to the prob-
lems of confounders. Perturb-and-observe experiments, however, involve
148
CHAPTER 4

only a single group that has received the intervention, and therefore the
results can lead researchers to the wrong conclusion (as I’ll show soon).
Despite the important differences between experiments and randomized
controlled experiments, social researchers often use these terms interchange-
ably. I’ll follow this convention, but, at certain points, I’ll break the con-
vention to emphasize the value of randomized controlled experiments over
experiments without randomization and a control group.
Randomized controlled experiments have proven to be a powerful way to
learn about the social world, and in this chapter, I’ll show you more about
how to use them in your research. In section 4.2, I’ll illustrate the basic
logic of experimentation with an example of an experiment on Wikipedia.
Then, in section 4.3, I’ll describe the difference between lab experiments
and field experiments and the differences between analog experiments and
digital experiments. Further, I’ll argue that digital field experiments can
offer the best features of analog lab experiments (tight control) and analog
field experiments (realism), all at a scale that was not possible previously.
Next, in section 4.4, I’ll describe three concepts—validity, heterogeneity
of treatment effects, and mechanisms in section 4.5—that are critical for
designing rich experiments. With that background, I’ll describe the trade-
offs involved in the two main strategies for conducting digital experiments:
doing it yourself or partnering with the powerful. Finally, I’ll conclude with
some design advice about how you can take advantage of the real power of
digital experiments (section 4.6.1) and describe some of the responsibility
that comes with that power (section 4.6.2).
4.2
What are experiments?
Randomized controlled experiments have four main ingredients:
recruitment of participants, randomization of treatment, delivery of
treatment, and measurement of outcomes.
Randomized controlled experiments have four main ingredients: recruit-
ment of participants, randomization of treatment, delivery of treatment, and
measurement of outcomes. The digital age does not change the fundamental
nature of experimentation, but it does make it easier logistically. For example,
in the past, it might have been difficult to measure the behavior of millions
of people, but that is now routinely happening in many digital systems.
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
149

Researchers who can figure out how to harness these new opportunities will
be able to run experiments that were impossible previously.
To make this all a bit more concrete—both what has stayed the same
and what has changed—let’s consider an experiment by Michael Restivo and
Arnout van de Rijt (2012). They wanted to understand the effect of informal
peer rewards on editorial contributions to Wikipedia. In particular, they
studied the effects of barnstars, an award that any Wikipedian can give to any
other Wikipedian to acknowledge hard work and due diligence. Restivo and
van de Rijt gave barnstars to 100 deserving Wikipedians. Then, they tracked
the recipients’ subsequent contributions to Wikipedia over the next 90 days.
Much to their surprise, the people to whom they awarded barnstars tended
to make fewer edits after receiving one. In other words, the barnstars seemed
to be discouraging rather than encouraging contribution.
Fortunately, Restivo and van de Rijt were not running a “perturb and
observe” experiment; they were running a randomized controlled experi-
ment. So, in addition to choosing 100 top contributors to receive a barnstar,
they also picked 100 top contributors to whom they did not give one. These
100 served as a control group. And, critically, who was in the treatment group
and who was in the control group was determined randomly.
When Restivo and van de Rijt looked at the behavior of people in the
control group, they found that their contributions were decreasing too.
Further, when Restivo and van de Rijt compared people in the treatment
group (i.e., received barnstars) to people in the control group, they found
that people in the treatment group contributed about 60% more. In other
words, the contributions of both groups were decreasing, but those of the
control group were doing so much faster.
As this study illustrates, the control group in experiments is critical in a
way that is somewhat paradoxical. In order to precisely measure the effect
of barnstars, Restivo and van de Rijt needed to observe people who did
not receive barnstars. Many times, researchers who are not familiar with
experiments fail to appreciate the incredible value of the control group.
If Restivo and van de Rijt had not had a control group, they would have
drawn exactly the wrong conclusion. Control groups are so important
that the CEO of a major casino company has said that there are only
three ways that employees can be fired from his company: for theft, for
sexual harassment, or for running an experiment without a control group
(Schrage 2011).

CHAPTER 4

Restivo and van de Rijt’s study illustrates the four main ingredients of
an experiment: recruitment, randomization, intervention, and outcomes.
Together, these four ingredients allow scientists to move beyond correlations
and measure the causal effect of treatments. Specifically, randomization
means that people in the treatment and control groups will be similar. This is
important because it means that any difference in outcomes between the two
groups can be attributed to the treatment and not a confounder.
In addition to being a nice illustration of the mechanics of experiments,
Restivo and van de Rijt’s study also shows that the logistics of digital
experiments can be completely different from those of analog experiments.
In Restivo and van de Rijt’s experiment, it was easy to give the barnstar to
anyone, and it was easy to track the outcome—number of edits—over an
extended period of time (because edit history is automatically recorded by
Wikipedia). This ability to deliver treatments and measure outcomes at no
cost is qualitatively unlike experiments in the past. Although this experiment
involved 200 people, it could have been run with 2,000 or even 20,000 people.
The main thing preventing the researchers from scaling up their experiment
by a factor of 100 was not cost; it was ethics. That is, Restivo and van de Rijt
didn’t want to give barnstars to undeserving editors, and they didn’t want
their experiment to disrupt the Wikipedia community (Restivo and Rijt 2012,
2014). I’ll return to some of the ethical considerations raised by experiments
later in this chapter and in chapter 6.
In conclusion, the experiment of Restivo and van de Rijt clearly shows
that while the basic logic of experimentation has not changed, the logistics of
digital-age experiments can be dramatically different. Next, in order to more
clearly isolate the opportunities created by these changes, I’ll compare the
experiments that researchers can do now with the kinds of experiments that
have been done in the past.

Two dimensions of experiments: lab–ﬁeld and
analog–digital
Lab experiments offer control, ﬁeld experiments offer realism, and
digital ﬁeld experiments combine control and realism at scale.
Experiments come in many different shapes and sizes. In the past,
researchers have found it helpful to organize experiments along a continuum

between lab experiments and field experiments. Now, however, researchers
should also organize experiments along a second continuum between analog
experiments and digital experiments. This two-dimensional design space will
help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches
and highlight the areas of greatest opportunity (figure 4.1).
One dimension along which experiments can be organized is the lab–
field dimension. Many experiments in the social sciences are lab experiments
where undergraduate students perform strange tasks in a lab for course
credit. This type of experiment dominates research in psychology because it
enables researchers to create highly controlled settings to precisely isolate and
test specific theories about social behavior. For certain problems, however,
something feels a bit strange about drawing strong conclusions about human
behavior from such unusual people performing such unusual tasks in such
an unusual setting. These concerns have led to a movement toward field
experiments. Field experiments combine the strong design of randomized
control experiments with more representative groups of participants per-
forming more common tasks in more natural settings.
Although some people think of lab and field experiments as competing
methods, it is best to think of them as complementary, with different
152
CHAPTER 4

strengths and weaknesses. For example, Correll, Benard, and Paik (2007)
used both a lab experiment and a field experiment in an attempt to find
the sources of the “motherhood penalty.” In the United States, mothers
earn less money than childless women, even when comparing women with
similar skills working in similar jobs. There are many possible explanations
for this pattern, one of which is that employers are biased against mothers.
(Interestingly, the opposite seems to be true for fathers: they tend to earn
more than comparable childless men.) In order to assess possible bias against
mothers, Correll and colleagues ran two experiments: one in the lab and one
in the field.
First, in a lab experiment, they told participants, who were college
undergraduates, that a company was conducting an employment search for
a person to lead its new East Coast marketing department. The students
were told that the company wanted their help in the hiring process, and
they were asked to review resumes of several potential candidates and to
rate the candidates on a number of dimensions, such as their intelligence,
warmth, and commitment to work. Further, the students were asked if they
would recommend hiring the applicant and what they would recommend
as a starting salary. Unbeknownst to the students, however, the resumes
were specifically constructed to be similar except for one thing: some of
them signaled motherhood (by listing involvement in a parent–teacher
association) and some did not. Correll and colleagues found that the students
were less likely to recommend hiring the mothers and that they offered them
a lower starting salary. Further, through a statistical analysis of both the
ratings and the hiring-related decisions, Correll and colleagues found that
mothers’ disadvantages were largely explained by the fact that they were rated
lower in terms of competence and commitment. Thus, this lab experiment
allowed Correll and colleagues to measure a causal effect and provide a
possible explanation for that effect.
Of course, one might be skeptical about drawing conclusions about the
entire US labor market based on the decisions of a few hundred under-
graduates who have probably never had a full-time job, let alone hired
someone. Therefore, Correll and colleagues also conducted a complementary
field experiment. They responded to hundreds of advertised job openings
with fake cover letters and resumes. Similar to the materials shown to the
undergraduates, some resumes signaled motherhood and some did not.
Correll and colleagues found that mothers were less likely to get called

back for interviews than equally qualified childless women. In other words,
real employers making consequential decisions in a natural setting behaved
much like the undergraduates. Did they make similar decisions for the same
reason? Unfortunately, we don’t know. The researchers were not able to ask
the employers to rate the candidates or explain their decisions.
This pair of experiments reveals a lot about lab and field experiments
in general. Lab experiments offer researchers near-total control of the en-
vironment in which participants are making decisions. So, for example, in
the lab experiment, Correll and colleagues were able to ensure that all the
resumes were read in a quiet setting; in the field experiment, some of the
resumes might not even have been read. Further, because participants in the
lab setting know that they are being studied, researchers are often able to
collect additional data that can help explain why participants are making
their decisions. For example, Correll and colleagues asked participants in
the lab experiment to rate the candidates on different dimensions. This kind
of process data could help researchers understand the mechanisms behind
differences in how participants treat the resumes.
On the other hand, these exact same characteristics that I have just
described as advantages are also sometimes considered disadvantages. Re-
searchers who prefer field experiments argue that participants in lab ex-
periments could act very differently because they know that they are being
studied. For example, in the lab experiment, participants might have guessed
the goal of the research and altered their behavior so as not to appear biased.
Further, researchers who prefer field experiments might argue that small
differences in resumes can only stand out in a very clean, sterile lab environ-
ment, and thus the lab experiment will overestimate the effect of motherhood
on real hiring decisions. Finally, many proponents of field experiments
criticize lab experiments’ reliance on WEIRD participants: mainly students
from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic countries
(Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010a). The experiments by Correll and
colleagues (2007) illustrate the two extremes on the lab–field continuum.
In between these two extremes, there are also a variety of hybrid designs,
including approaches such as bringing non-students into a lab or going into
the field but still having participants perform an unusual task.
In addition to the lab–field dimension that has existed in the past, the
digital age means that researchers now have a second major dimension
along which experiments can vary: analog–digital. Just as there are pure lab
154
CHAPTER 4

experiments, pure field experiments, and a variety of hybrids in between,
there are pure analog experiments, pure digital experiments, and a variety
of hybrids. It is tricky to offer a formal definition of this dimension, but a
useful working definition is that fully digital experiments are experiments
that make use of digital infrastructure to recruit participants, randomize,
deliver treatments, and measure outcomes. For example, Restivo and van de
Rijt’s (2012) study of barnstars and Wikipedia was a fully digital experiment,
because it used digital systems for all four of these steps. Likewise, fully
analog experiments do not make use of digital infrastructure for any of
these four steps. Many of the classic experiments in psychology are fully
analog experiments. In between these two extremes, there are partially digital
experiments that use a combination of analog and digital systems.
When some people think of digital experiments, they immediately think
of online experiments. This is unfortunate because the opportunities to
run digital experiments are not just online. Researchers can run partially
digital experiments by using digital devices in the physical world in order
to deliver treatments or measure outcomes. For example, researchers could
use smartphones to deliver treatments or sensors in the built environment
to measure outcomes. In fact, as we will see later in this chapter, researchers
have already used home power meters to measure outcomes in experiments
about energy consumption involving 8.5 million households (Allcott 2015).
As digital devices become increasingly integrated into people’s lives and sen-
sors become integrated into the built environment, these opportunities to run
partially digital experiments in the physical world will increase dramatically.
In other words, digital experiments are not just online experiments.
Digital systems create new possibilities for experiments everywhere along
the lab–field continuum. In pure lab experiments, for example, researchers
can use digital systems for finer measurement of participants’ behavior; one
example of this type of improved measurement is eye-tracking equipment
that provides precise and continuous measures of gaze location. The dig-
ital age also creates the possibility of running lab-like experiments online.
For example, researchers have rapidly adopted Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk) to recruit participants for online experiments (figure 4.2). MTurk
matches “employers” who have tasks that need to be completed with “work-
ers” who wish to complete those tasks for money. Unlike traditional labor
markets, however, the tasks involved usually require only a few minutes
to complete, and the entire interaction between employer and worker is

online. Because MTurk mimics aspects of traditional lab experiments—
paying people to complete tasks that they would not do for free—it is nat-
urally suited for certain types of experiments. Essentially, MTurk has created
the infrastructure for managing a pool of participants—recruiting and paying
people—and researchers have taken advantage of that infrastructure to tap
into an always available pool of participants.
Digital systems create even more possibilities for field-like experiments. In
particular, they enable researchers to combine the tight control and process
data that are associated with lab experiments with the more diverse partici-
pants and more natural settings that are associated with lab experiments. In
addition, digital field experiments also offer three opportunities that tend to
be difficult in analog experiments.
First, whereas most analog lab and field experiments have hundreds of
participants, digital field experiments can have millions of participants. This
change in scale is because some digital experiments can produce data at zero
variable cost. That is, once researchers have created an experimental infras-
tructure, increasing the number of participants typically does not increase
the cost. Increasing the number of participants by a factor of 100 or more is
not just a quantitative change; it is a qualitative change, because it enables
researchers to learn different things from experiments (e.g., heterogeneity
156
CHAPTER 4

of treatment effects) and to run entirely different experimental designs (e.g.,
large-group experiments). This point is so important, I’ll return to it toward
the end of the chapter when I offer advice about creating digital experiments.
Second, whereas most analog lab and field experiments treat partici-
pants as indistinguishable widgets, digital field experiments often use back-
ground information about participants in the design and analysis stages of
the research. This background information, which is called pre-treatment
information, is often available in digital experiments because they are run
on top of always-on measurement systems (see chapter 2). For example,
a researcher at Facebook has much more pre-treatment information about
people in her digital field experiment than a university researcher has about
the people in her analog field experiment. This pre-treatment enables more
efficient experimental designs—such as blocking (Higgins, Sävje, and Sekhon
2016) and targeted recruitment of participants (Eckles, Kizilcec, and Bakshy
2016)—and more insightful analysis—such as estimation of heterogeneity of
treatment effects (Athey and Imbens 2016a) and covariate adjustment for
improved precision (Bloniarz et al. 2016).
Third, whereas many analog lab and field experiments deliver treatments
and measure outcomes in a relatively compressed amount of time, some
digital field experiments happen over much longer timescales. For example,
Restivo and van de Rijt’s experiment had the outcome measured daily
for 90 days, and one of the experiments I’ll tell you about later in the
chapter (Ferraro, Miranda, and Price 2011) tracked outcomes over three
years at basically no cost. These three opportunities—size, pre-treatment
information, and longitudinal treatment and outcome data—arise most
commonly when experiments are run on top of always-on measurement
systems (see chapter 2 for more on always-on measurement systems).
While digital field experiments offer many possibilities, they also share
some weaknesses with both analog lab and analog field experiments. For
example, experiments cannot be used to study the past, and they can only
estimate the effects of treatments that can be manipulated. Also, although
experiments are undoubtedly useful to guide policy, the exact guidance they
can offer is somewhat limited because of complications such as environ-
mental dependence, compliance problems, and equilibrium effects (Banerjee
and Duflo 2009; Deaton 2010). Digital field experiments also magnify the
ethical concerns created by field experiments—a topic I’ll address later in
this chapter and in chapter 6.
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS

4.4
Moving beyond simple experiments
Let’s move beyond simple experiments. Three concepts are useful for
rich experiments: validity, heterogeneity of treatment effects, and
mechanisms.
Researchers who are new to experiments often focus on a very specific,
narrow question: Does this treatment “work”? For example, does a phone
call from a volunteer encourage someone to vote? Does changing a website
button from blue to green increase the click-through rate? Unfortunately,
loose phrasing about what “works” obscures the fact that narrowly focused
experiments don’t really tell you whether a treatment “works” in a general
sense. Rather, narrowly focused experiments answer a much more specific
question: What is the average effect of this specific treatment with this
specific implementation for this population of participants at this time? I’ll
call experiments that focus on this narrow question simple experiments.
Simple experiments can provide valuable information, but they fail to
answer many questions that are both important and interesting, such as
whether there are some people for whom the treatment had a larger or
smaller effect; whether there is another treatment that would be more
effective; and whether this experiment relates to broader social theories.
In order to show the value of moving beyond simple experiments, let’s
consider an analog field experiment by P. Wesley Schultz and colleagues
on the relationship between social norms and energy consumption (Schultz
et al. 2007). Schultz and colleagues hung doorhangers on 300 households in
San Marcos, California, and these doorhangers delivered different messages
designed to encourage energy conservation. Then, Schultz and colleagues
measured the effect of these messages on electricity consumption, both after
one week and after three weeks; see figure 4.3 for a more detailed description
of the experimental design.
The experiment had two conditions. In the first, households received
general energy-saving tips (e.g., use fans instead of air conditioners) and
information about their energy usage compared with the average energy
usage in their neighborhood. Schultz and colleagues called this the descriptive
normative condition because the information about the energy use in the
neighborhood provided information about typical behavior (i.e., a descrip-
tive norm). When Schultz and colleagues looked at the resulting energy usage

Figure 4.3: Schematic of the experimental design from Schultz et al. (2007). The field
experiment involved visiting about 300 households in San Marcos, California five times over
an eight-week period. On each visit, the researchers manually took a reading from the house’s
power meter. On two of the visits, they placed doorhangers on each house providing some
information about the household’s energy usage. The research question was how the content
of these messages would impact energy use.
in this group, the treatment appeared to have no effect, in either the short or
long term; in other words, the treatment didn’t seem to “work” (figure 4.4).
Fortunately, Schultz and colleagues did not settle for this simplistic
analysis. Before the experiment began, they reasoned that heavy users
of electricity—people above the mean—might reduce their consumption,
and that light users of electricity—people below the mean—might actually
increase their consumption. When they looked at the data, that’s exactly
what they found (figure 4.4). Thus, what looked like a treatment that was
having no effect was actually a treatment that had two offsetting effects.
This counterproductive increase among the light users is an example of a
boomerang effect, where a treatment can have the opposite effect from what
was intended.
Simultaneous to the first condition, Schultz and colleagues also ran
a second condition. The households in the second condition received
the exact same treatment—general energy-saving tips and information
about their household’s energy usage compared with the average for their
neighborhood—with one tiny addition: for people with below-average con-
sumption, the researchers added a :) and for people with above-average
consumption they added a :(. These emoticons were designed to trigger what
the researchers called injunctive norms. Injunctive norms refer to perceptions
of what is commonly approved (and disapproved), whereas descriptive

Figure 4.4: Results from Schultz et al. (2007). Panel (a) shows that the descriptive norm
treatment has an estimated zero average treatment effect. However, panel (b) shows that this
average treatment effect is actually composed of two offsetting effects. For heavy users, the
treatment decreased usage, but for light users, the treatment increased usage. Finally, panel (c)
shows that the second treatment, which used descriptive and injunctive norms, had roughly
the same effect on heavy users but mitigated the boomerang effect on light users. Adapted
from Schultz et al. (2007).
norms refer to perceptions of what is commonly done (Reno, Cialdini, and
Kallgren 1993).
By adding this one tiny emoticon, the researchers dramatically reduced
the boomerang effect (figure 4.4). Thus, by making this one simple change—
a change that was motivated by an abstract social psychological theory
(Cialdini, Kallgren, and Reno 1991)—the researchers were able to turn a
program that didn’t seem to work into one that worked, and, simultaneously,
they were able to contribute to the general understanding of how social
norms affect human behavior.
At this point, however, you might notice that something is a bit different
about this experiment. In particular, the experiment of Schultz and colleagues
doesn’t really have a control group in the same way that randomized
controlled experiments do. A comparison between this design and that
of Restivo and van de Rijt illustrates the differences between two major
experimental designs. In between-subjects designs, such as that of Restivo
and van de Rijt, there is a treatment group and a control group. In within-
subjects designs, on the other hand, the behavior of participants is compared
before and after the treatment (Greenwald 1976; Charness, Gneezy, and
Kuhn 2012). In a within-subjects experiment, it is as if each participant
acts as her own control group. The strength of between-subjects designs is
160
CHAPTER 4

that they provide protection against confounders (as I described earlier),
while the strength of within-subjects experiments is increased precision of
estimates. Finally, to foreshadow an idea that will come later when I offer
advice about designing digital experiments, a mixed design combines the
improved precision of within-subjects designs and the protection against
confounding of between-subjects designs (figure 4.5).
Overall, the design and results of the study by Schultz and colleagues
(2007) show the value of moving beyond simple experiments. Fortunately,
you don’t need to be a creative genius to design experiments like this. Social
scientists have developed three concepts that will guide you toward richer
experiments: (1) validity, (2) heterogeneity of treatment effects, and (3)
mechanisms. That is, if you keep these three ideas in mind while you are
designing your experiment, you will naturally create a more interesting and
useful experiment. In order to illustrate these three concepts in action, I’ll
describe a number of follow-up partially digital field experiments that built
on the elegant design and exciting results of Schultz and colleagues (2007).
As you will see, through more careful design, implementation, analysis, and
interpretation, you too can move beyond simple experiments.
4.4.1 Validity
Validity refers to how much the results of an experiment support a
more general conclusion.
No experiment is perfect, and researchers have developed an extensive
vocabulary to describe possible problems. Validity refers to the extent to
which the results of a particular experiment support some more general
conclusion. Social scientists have found it helpful to split validity into
four main types: statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct
validity, and external validity (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell 2001, chapter 2).
Mastering these concepts will provide you with a mental checklist for
critiquing and improving the design and analysis of an experiment, and it
will help you communicate with other researchers.
Statistical conclusion validity centers around whether the statistical anal-
ysis of the experiment was done correctly. In the context of Schultz et al.
(2007), such a question might center on whether they computed their
p-values correctly. The statistical principles need to design and analyze

Figure 4.5: Three experimental designs. Standard randomized controlled experiments use
between-subjects designs. An example of a between-subjects design is Restivo and van de Rijt’s
(2012) experiment on barnstars and contributions to Wikipedia: the researchers randomly
divided participants into treatment and control groups, gave participants in the treatment
group a barnstar, and compared outcomes for the two groups. The second type of design
is a within-subjects design. The two experiments in Schultz and colleagues’ (2007) study on
social norms and energy use illustrate a within-subjects design: the researchers compared
the electricity use of participants before and after receiving the treatment. Within-subjects
designs offer improved statistical precision, but they are open to possible confounders
(e.g., changes in weather between the pre-treatment and treatment periods) (Greenwald
1976; Charness, Gneezy, and Kuhn 2012). Within-subjects designs are also sometimes called
repeated measures designs. Finally, mixed designs combine the improved precision of within-
subjects designs and the protection against confounding of between-subjects designs. In a
mixed design, a researcher compares the change in outcomes for people in the treatment and
control groups. When researchers already have pre-treatment information, as is the case in
many digital experiments, mixed designs are generally preferable to between-subjects designs
because they result in improved precision of estimates.

experiments are beyond the scope of this book, but they have have not funda-
mentally changed in the digital age. What has changed, however, is that the
data environment in digital experiments has created new opportunities such
as using machine learning methods to estimate heterogeneity of treatment
effects (Imai and Ratkovic 2013).
Internal validity centers around whether the experimental procedures
were performed correctly. Returning to the experiment of Schultz et al.
(2007), questions about internal validity could center around randomization,
delivery of treatment, and measurement of outcomes. For example, you
might be concerned that the research assistants did not read the electric
meters reliably. In fact, Schultz and colleagues were worried about this
problem, and they had a sample of meters read twice; fortunately, the results
were essentially identical. In general, Schultz and colleagues’ experiment
appears to have high internal validity, but this is not always the case: complex
field and online experiments often run into problems actually delivering the
right treatment to the right people and measuring the outcomes for everyone.
Fortunately, the digital age can help reduce concerns about internal validity,
because it is now easier to ensure that the treatment is delivered to those who
are supposed to receive it and to measure outcomes for all participants.
Construct validity centers around the match between the data and the
theoretical constructs. As discussed in chapter 2, constructs are abstract
concepts that social scientists reason about. Unfortunately, these abstract
concepts don’t always have clear definitions and measurements. Return-
ing to Schultz et al. (2007), the claim that injunctive social norms can
lower electricity use requires researchers to design a treatment that would
manipulate “injunctive social norms” (e.g., an emoticon) and to measure
“electricity use”. In analog experiments, many researchers designed their own
treatments and measured their own outcomes. This approach ensures that,
as much as possible, the experiments match the abstract constructs being
studied. In digital experiments where researchers partner with companies
or governments to deliver treatments and use always-on data systems to
measure outcomes, the match between the experiment and the theoretical
constructs may be less tight. Thus, I expect that construct validity will tend
to be a bigger concern in digital experiments than in analog experiments.
Finally, external validity centers around whether the results of this
experiment can be generalized to other situations. Returning to Schultz
et al. (2007), one could ask whether this same idea—providing people with
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
163

information about their energy usage in relationship to their peers and a
signal of injunctive norms (e.g., an emoticon)—would reduce energy usage if
it were done in a different way in a different setting. For most well-designed
and well-run experiments, concerns about external validity are the hardest to
address. In the past, these debates about external validity frequently involved
nothing more than a group of people sitting in a room trying to imagine what
would have happened if the procedures had been done in a different way, or
in a different place, or with different participants. Fortunately, the digital age
enables researchers to move beyond these data-free speculations and assess
external validity empirically.
Because the results from Schultz et al. (2007) were so exciting, a company
named Opower partnered with utilities in the United States to deploy the
treatment more widely. Based on the design of Schultz et al. (2007), Opower
created customized Home Energy Reports that had two main modules: one
showing a household’s electricity usage relative to its neighbors with an
emoticon and one providing tips for lowering energy usage (figure 4.6).
Then, in partnership with researchers, Opower ran randomized controlled
experiments to assess the impact of these Home Energy Reports. Even though
the treatments in these experiments were typically delivered physically—
usually through old-fashioned snail mail—the outcome was measured using
digital devices in the physical world (e.g., power meters). Further, rather
than manually collecting this information by research assistants visiting each
house, the Opower experiments were all done in partnership with power
companies, enabling the researchers to access the power readings. Thus,
these partially digital field experiments were run at a massive scale at low
variable cost.
In a first set of experiments involving 600,000 households from 10 differ-
ent sites, Allcott (2011) found that the Home Energy Report lowered elec-
tricity consumption. In other words, the results from the much larger, more
geographically diverse study were qualitatively similar to the results from
Schultz et al. (2007). Further, in subsequent research involving eight million
additional households from 101 different sites, Allcott (2015) again found
that the Home Energy Report consistently lowered electricity consumption.
This much larger set of experiments also revealed an interesting new pattern
that would not be visible in any single experiment: the size of the effect
declined in the later experiments (figure 4.7). Allcott (2015) speculated that
this decline happened because, over time, the treatment was being applied to

appeared to decline. Thus, just as randomization in experiments ensures that

the treatment and control group are similar, randomization in research sites
ensures that the estimates can be generalized from one group of participants
to a more general population (think back to chapter 3 about sampling). If
research sites are not sampled randomly, then generalization—even from a
perfectly designed and conducted experiment—can be problematic.
Together, these 111 experiments—10 in Allcott (2011) and 101 in Allcott
(2015)—involved about 8.5 million households from all over the United
States. They consistently show that Home Energy Reports reduce average
electricity consumption, a result that supports the original findings of Schultz
and colleagues from 300 homes in California. Beyond just replicating these
original results, the follow-up experiments also show that the size of the effect
varies by location. This set of experiments also illustrates two more general
points about partially digital field experiments. First, researchers will be able
to empirically address concerns about external validity when the cost of
running experiments is low, and this can occur if the outcome is already
being measured by an always-on data system. Therefore, it suggests that
researchers should be on the lookout for other interesting and important
166
CHAPTER 4

behaviors that are already being recorded, and then design experiments on
top of this existing measuring infrastructure. Second, this set of experiments
reminds us that digital field experiments are not just online; increasingly,
I expect that they will be everywhere, with many outcomes measured by
sensors in the built environment.
The four types of validity—statistical conclusion validity, internal validity,
construct validity, and external validity—provide a mental checklist to help
researchers assess whether the results from a particular experiment support a
more general conclusion. Compared with analog-age experiments, in digital-
age experiments, it should be easier to address external validity empirically,
and it should also be easier to ensure internal validity. On the other hand,
issues of construct validity will probably be more challenging in digital-age
experiments, especially digital field experiments that involve partnerships
with companies.
4.4.2 Heterogeneity of treatment effects
Experiments normally measure the average effect, but the effect is
probably not the same for everyone.
The second key idea for moving beyond simple experiments is heterogeneity
of treatment effects. The experiment of Schultz et al. (2007) powerfully
illustrates how the same treatment can have a different effect on differ-
ent kinds of people (figure 4.4). In most analog experiments, however,
researchers focused on average treatment effects because there were a small
number of participants and little was known about them. In digital experi-
ments, however, there are often many more participants and more is known
about them. In this different data environment, researchers who continue
to estimate only average treatment effects will miss out the ways in which
estimates about the heterogeneity of treatment effects can provide clues
about how a treatment works, how it can be improved, and how it can be
targeted to those most likely to benefit.
Two examples of heterogeneity of treatment effects come from additional
research on the Home Energy Reports. First, Allcott (2011) used the large
sample size (600,000 households) to further split the sample and estimate the
effect of the Home Energy Report by decile of pre-treatment energy usage.
While Schultz et al. (2007) found differences between heavy and light users,

Figure 4.8: Heterogeneity of treatment effects in Allcott (2011). The decrease in energy use
was different for people in different deciles of baseline usage. Adapted from Allcott (2011),
figure 8.
Allcott (2011) found that there were also differences within the heavy- and
light-user groups. For example, the heaviest users (those in the top decile)
reduced their energy usage twice as much as someone in the middle of the
heavy-user group (figure 4.8). Further, estimating the effect by pre-treatment
behavior also revealed that there was no boomerang effect, even for the
lightest users (figure 4.8).
In a related study, Costa and Kahn (2013) speculated that the effec-
tiveness of the Home Energy Report could vary based on a participant’s
political ideology and that the treatment might actually cause people with
certain ideologies to increase their electricity use. In other words, they
speculated that the Home Energy Reports might be creating a boomerang
effect for some types of people. To assess this possibility, Costa and Kahn
merged the Opower data with data purchased from a third-party aggregator
that included information such as political party registration, donations
to environmental organizations, and household participation in renewable
energy programs. With this merged dataset, Costa and Kahn found that
the Home Energy Reports produced broadly similar effects for participants
with different ideologies; there was no evidence that any group exhibited
boomerang effects (figure 4.9).
As these two examples illustrate, in the digital age, we can move from esti-

information from the experiment with information about the households, Costa and Kahn
(2013) used a series of statistical models to estimate the treatment effect for very specific
groups of people. Two estimates are presented for each group because the estimates depend
on the covariates they included in their statistical models (see models 4 and 6 in tables 3 and
4 in Costa and Kahn (2013)). As this example illustrates, treatment effects can be different
for different people, and estimates of treatment effects that come from statistical models can
depend on the details of those models (Grimmer, Messing, and Westwood 2014). Adapted
from Costa and Kahn (2013), tables 3 and 4.
mating average treatment effects to estimating the heterogeneity of treatment
effects, because we can have many more participants and we know more
about those participants. Learning about heterogeneity of treatment effects
can enable targeting of a treatment where it is most effective, provide facts
that stimulate new theory development, and provide hints about possible
mechanisms, the topic to which I now turn.
4.4.3 Mechanisms
Experiments measure what happened. Mechanisms explain why and
how it happened.

The third key idea for moving beyond simple experiments is mechanisms.
Mechanisms tell us why or how a treatment caused an effect. The process of
searching for mechanisms is also sometimes called looking for intervening
variables or mediating variables. Although experiments are good for estimat-
ing causal effects, they are often not designed to reveal mechanisms. Digital
experiments can help us identify mechanisms in two ways: (1) they enable
us to collect more process data and (2) they enable us to test many related
treatments.
Because mechanisms are tricky to define formally (Hedström and Ylikoski
2010), I’m going to start with a simple example: limes and scurvy (Gerber
and Green 2012). In the eighteenth century, doctors had a pretty good
sense that when sailors ate limes, they did not get scurvy. Scurvy is a
terrible disease, so this was powerful information. But these doctors did
not know why limes prevented scurvy. It was not until 1932, almost 200
years later, that scientists could reliably show that vitamin C was the reason
that lime prevented scurvy (Carpenter 1988, p. 191). In this case, vitamin
C is the mechanism through which limes prevent scurvy (figure 4.10).
Of course, identifying the mechanism is very important scientifically—
lots of science is about understanding why things happen. Identifying
mechanisms is also very important practically. Once we understand why
a treatment works, we can potentially develop new treatments that work
even better.
Unfortunately, isolating mechanisms is very difficult. Unlike limes and
scurvy, in many social settings, treatments probably operate through many
interrelated pathways. However, in the case of social norms and energy use,
researchers have tried to isolate mechanisms by collecting process data and
testing related treatments.
170
CHAPTER 4

One way to test possible mechanisms is by collecting process data about
how the treatment impacted possible mechanisms. For example, recall that
Allcott (2011) showed that Home Energy Reports caused people to lower
their electricity usage. But how did these reports lower electricity usage?
What were the mechanisms? In a follow-up study, Allcott and Rogers (2014)
partnered with a power company that, through a rebate program, had
acquired information about which consumers upgraded their appliances to
more energy-efficient models. Allcott and Rogers (2014) found that slightly
more people receiving the Home Energy Reports upgraded their appliances.
But this difference was so small that it could account for only 2% of the
decrease in energy use in the treated households. In other words, appliance
upgrades were not the dominant mechanism through which the Home
Energy Report decreased electricity consumption.
A second way to study mechanisms is to run experiments with slightly
different versions of the treatment. For example, in the experiment of Schultz
et al. (2007) and all the subsequent Home Energy Report experiments,
participants were provided with a treatment that had two main parts (1)
tips about energy savings and (2) information about their energy use relative
to their peers (figure 4.6). Thus, it is possible that the energy-saving tips
were what caused the change, not the peer information. To assess the
possibility that the tips alone might have been sufficient, Ferraro, Miranda,
and Price (2011) partnered with a water company near Atlanta, Georgia,
and ran a related experiment on water conservation involving about 100,000
households. There were four conditions:
• a group that received tips on saving water
• a group that received tips on saving water plus a moral appeal to
save water
• a group that received tips on saving water plus a moral appeal to save
water plus information about their water use relative to their peers
• a control group
The researchers found that the tips-only treatment had no effect on
water usage in the short (one year), medium (two years), and long (three
years) term. The tips plus appeal treatment caused participants to decrease
water usage, but only in the short term. Finally, the tips plus appeal plus
peer information treatment caused decreased usage in the short, medium,

unbundling the treatment, the researchers hoped to develop a better sense of the mechanisms.
The tips-only treatment had essentially no effect in the short (one year), medium (two
years), and long (three years) term. The tips plus appeal treatment caused participants
to decrease water usage, but only in the short term. The advice plus appeal plus peer
information treatment caused participants to decrease water usage in the short, medium,
and long term. Vertical bars are estimated confidence intervals. See Bernedo, Ferraro,
and Price (2014) for actual study materials. Adapted from Ferraro, Miranda, and Price

and long term (figure 4.11). These kinds of experiments with unbundled
treatments are a good way to figure out which part of the treatment—
or which parts together—are the ones that are causing the effect (Gerber
and Green 2012, section 10.6). For example, the experiment of Ferraro and
colleagues shows us that water-saving tips alone are not enough to decrease
water usage.
Ideally, one would move beyond the layering of components (tips; tips
plus appeal; tips plus appeal plus peer information) to a full factorial design—
also sometimes called a 2k factorial design—where each possible combina-
tion of the three elements is tested (table 4.1). By testing every possible
combination of components, researchers can fully assess the effect of each
component in isolation and in combination. For example, the experiment

of Ferraro and colleagues does not reveal whether peer comparison alone
would have been sufficient to lead to long-term changes in behavior. In
the past, these full factorial designs have been difficult to run because they
require a large number of participants and they require researchers to be able
to precisely control and deliver a large number of treatments. But, in some
situations, the digital age removes these logistical constraints.
In summary, mechanisms—the pathways through which a treatment
has an effect—are incredibly important. Digital-age experiments can help
researchers learn about mechanisms by (1) collecting process data and
(2) enabling full factorial designs. The mechanisms suggested by these
approaches can then be tested directly by experiments specifically designed
to test mechanisms (Ludwig, Kling, and Mullainathan 2011; Imai, Tingley,
and Yamamoto 2013; Pirlott and MacKinnon 2016).
In total, these three concepts—validity, heterogeneity of treatment effects,
and mechanisms—provide a powerful set of ideas for designing and inter-
preting experiments. These concepts help researchers move beyond simple
experiments about what “works” to richer experiments that have tighter
links to theory, that reveal where and why treatments work, and that might
even help researchers design more effective treatments. Given this conceptual
background about experiments, I’ll now turn to how you can actually make
your experiments happen.

the ability to do what you want in terms of recruiting participants, randomization, delivering

environment matches those encountered in everyday life; note that high realism is not always
important for testing theories (Falk and Heckman 2009). By ethics I mean the ability of well-
intentioned researchers to manage ethical challenges that might arise.
4.5
Making it happen
Even if you don’t work at a big tech company you can run digital
experiments. You can either do it yourself or partner with someone
who can help you (and who you can help).
By this point, I hope that you are excited about the possibilities of doing
your own digital experiments. If you work at a big tech company, you might
already be doing these experiments all the time. But if you don’t work at
a tech company, you might think that you can’t run digital experiments.
Fortunately, that’s wrong: with a little creativity and hard work, everyone
can run a digital experiment.
As a first step, it is helpful to distinguish between two main approaches:
doing it yourself or partnering with the powerful. And there are even a few
different ways that you can do it yourself: you can experiment in existing
environments, build your own experiment, or build your own product for
repeated experimentation. As you’ll see from the examples below, none of
these approaches is best in all situations, and it’s best to think of them as
offering trade-offs along four main dimensions: cost, control, realism, and
ethics (figure 4.12).
174
CHAPTER 4

4.5.1 Use existing environments
You can run experiments inside existing environments, often without
any coding or partnership.
Logistically, the easiest way to do a digital experiment is to overlay your
experiment on top of an existing environment. Such experiments can be run
at a reasonably large scale and don’t require partnership with a company or
extensive software development.
For example, Jennifer Doleac and Luke Stein (2013) took advantage of an
online marketplace similar to Craigslist in order to run an experiment that
measured racial discrimination. They advertised thousands of iPods, and by
systematically varying the characteristics of the seller, they were able to study
the effect of race on economic transactions. Further, they used the scale of
their experiment to estimate when the effect was bigger (heterogeneity of
treatment effects) and to offer some ideas about why the effect might occur
(mechanisms).
Doleac and Stein’s iPod advertisements varied along three main dimen-
sions. First, the researchers varied the characteristics of the seller, which was
signaled by the hand photographed holding the iPod [white, black, white
with tattoo] (figure 4.13). Second, they varied the asking price [$90, $110,
$130]. Third, they varied the quality of the ad text [high-quality and low-
quality (e.g., cApitalization errors and spelin errors)]. Thus, the authors had
a 3 × 3 × 2 design, which was deployed across more than 300 local markets,
ranging from towns (e.g., Kokomo, Indiana and North Platte, Nebraska) to
mega-cities (e.g., New York and Los Angeles).
Averaged across all conditions, the outcomes were better for the white
sellers than the black sellers, with the tattooed sellers having intermediate
results. For example, the white sellers received more offers and had higher
final sale prices. Beyond these average effects, Doleac and Stein estimated the
heterogeneity of effects. For example, one prediction from earlier theory is
that discrimination would be less in markets where there is more competition
between buyers. Using the number of offers in that market as a measure of
the amount of buyer competition, the researchers found that black sellers
did indeed receive worse offers in markets with a low degree of competition.
Further, by comparing outcomes for the ads with high-quality and low-
quality text, Doleac and Stein found that ad quality did not impact the

disadvantage faced by black and tattooed sellers. Finally, taking advantage
of the fact that advertisements were placed in more than 300 markets,
the authors found that black sellers were more disadvantaged in cities with
high crime rates and high residential segregation. None of these results give
us a precise understanding of exactly why black sellers had worse outcomes,
but, when combined with the results of other studies, they can begin to
inform theories about the causes of racial discrimination in different types
of economic transactions.
Another example that shows the ability of researchers to conduct digital
field experiments in existing systems is the research by Arnout van de
Rijt and colleagues (2014) on the keys to success. In many aspects of
life, seemingly similar people end up with very different outcomes. One
possible explanation for this pattern is that small—and essentially random—
176
CHAPTER 4

advantages can lock in and grow over time, a process that researchers
call cumulative advantage. In order to determine whether small initial
successes lock in or fade away, van de Rijt and colleagues (2014) inter-
vened in four different systems bestowing success on randomly selected
participants and then measured the subsequent impacts of this arbitrary
success.
More specifically, van de Rijt and colleagues (1) pledged money to ran-
domly selected projects Kickstarter, a crowdfunding website; (2) positively
rated randomly selected reviews on Epinions, a product review website; (3)
gave awards to randomly chosen contributors to Wikipedia; and (4) signed
randomly selected petitions on change.org. They found very similar results
across all four systems: in each case, participants who were randomly given
some early success went on to have more subsequent success than their
otherwise completely indistinguishable peers (figure 4.14). The fact that the
same pattern appeared in many systems increases the external validity of
these results because it reduces the chance that this pattern is an artifact of
any particular system.
Together, these two examples show that researchers can conduct dig-
ital field experiments without the need to partner with companies or
to build complex digital systems. Further, table 4.2 provides even more
examples that show the range of what is possible when researchers use
the infrastructure of existing systems to deliver treatment and/or measure
outcomes. These experiments are relatively cheap for researchers, and they
offer a high degree of realism. But they offer researchers limited control
over the participants, treatments, and outcomes to be measured. Further,
for experiments taking place in only one system, researchers need to be
concerned that the effects could be driven by system-specific dynamics
(e.g., the way that Kickstarter ranks projects or the way that Change.org
ranks petitions; for more information, see the discussion about algorithmic
confounding in chapter 2). Finally, when researchers intervene in working
systems, tricky ethical questions emerge about possible harm to participants,
nonparticipants, and systems. We will consider these ethical question in
more detail in chapter 6, and there is an excellent discussion of them in
the appendix of van de Rijt et al. (2014). The trade-offs that come with
working in an existing system are not ideal for every project, and for
that reason some researchers build their own experimental system, as I’ll
illustrate next.

4.5.2 Build your own experiment
Building your own experiment might be costly, but it will enable you
to create the experiment that you want.
In addition to overlaying experiments on top of existing environments, you
can also build your own experiment. The main advantage of this approach is
control; if you are building the experiment, you can create the environment
and treatments that you want. These bespoke experimental environments
can create opportunities to test theories that are impossible to test in
naturally occurring environments. The main drawbacks of building your
own experiment are that it can be expensive and that the environment that
you are able to create might not have the realism of a naturally occurring
system. Researchers building their own experiment must also have a strategy

for recruiting participants. When working in existing systems, researchers
are essentially bringing the experiments to their participants. But, when
researchers build their own experiment, they need to bring participants to it.
Fortunately, services such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) can provide
researchers with a convenient way to bring participants to their experiments.
One example that illustrates the virtues of bespoke environments for
testing abstract theories is the digital lab experiment by Gregory Huber,
Seth Hill, and Gabriel Lenz (2012). This experiment explores a possible
practical limitation to the functioning of democratic governance. Earlier
non-experimental studies of actual elections suggested that voters are not
able to accurately assess the performance of incumbent politicians. In par-
ticular, voters appear to suffer from three biases: (1) they are focused on
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
179

recent rather than cumulative performance; (2) they can be manipulated by
rhetoric, framing, and marketing; and (3) they can be influenced by events
unrelated to incumbent performance, such as the success of local sports
teams and the weather. In these earlier studies, however, it was hard to
isolate any of these factors from all the other stuff that happens in real, messy
elections. Therefore, Huber and colleagues created a highly simplified voting
environment in order to isolate, and then experimentally study, each of these
three possible biases.
As I describe the experimental set-up below, it is going to sound very
artificial, but remember that realism is not a goal in lab-style experiments.
Rather, the goal is to clearly isolate the process that you are trying to study,
and this tight isolation is sometimes not possible in studies with more realism
(Falk and Heckman 2009). Further, in this particular case, the researchers
argued that if voters cannot effectively evaluate performance in this highly
simplified setting, then they are not going to be able to do it in a more
realistic, more complex setting.
Huber and colleagues used MTurk to recruit participants. Once a par-
ticipant provided informed consent and passed a short test, she was told
that she was participating in a 32-round game to earn tokens that could be
converted into real money. At the beginning of the game, each participant
was told that she had been assigned an “allocator” that would give her free
tokens each round and that some allocators were more generous than others.
Further, each participant was also told that she would have a chance to either
keep her allocator or be assigned a new one after 16 rounds of the game.
Given what you know about Huber and colleagues’ research goals, you can
see that the allocator represents a government and this choice represents an
election, but participants were not aware of the general goals of the research.
In total, Huber and colleagues recruited about 4,000 participants, who were
paid about $1.25 for a task that took about eight minutes.
Recall that one of the findings from earlier research was that voters reward
and punish incumbents for outcomes that are clearly beyond their control,
such as the success of local sports teams and the weather. To assess whether
participants voting decisions could be influenced by purely random events
in their setting, Huber and colleagues added a lottery to their experimental
system. At either the 8th round or the 16th round (i.e., right before the chance
to replace the allocator) participants were randomly placed in a lottery where
some won 5,000 points, some won 0 points, and some lost 5,000 points.

Figure 4.15: Results from Huber, Hill, and Lenz (2012). Participants who benefited from the
lottery were more likely to retain their allocator, and this effect was stronger when the lottery
happened in round 16—right before the replacement decision—than when it happened in
round 8. Adapted from Huber, Hill, and Lenz (2012), figure 5.
This lottery was intended to mimic good or bad news that is independent
of the performance of the politician. Even though participants were explicitly
told that the lottery was unrelated to the performance of their allocator, the
outcome of the lottery still impacted participants’ decisions. Participants who
benefited from the lottery were more likely to keep their allocator, and this
effect was stronger when the lottery happened in round 16—right before
the replacement decision—than when it happened in round 8 (figure 4.15).
These results, along with those of several other experiments in the paper, led
Huber and colleagues to conclude that even in a simplified setting, voters
have difficulty making wise decisions, a result that impacted future research
about voter decision making (Healy and Malhotra 2013). The experiment of
Huber and colleagues shows that MTurk can be used to recruit participants
for lab-style experiments in order to precisely test very specific theories. It
also shows the value of building your own experimental environment: it is
hard to imagine how these same processes could have been isolated so cleanly
in any other setting.
In addition to building lab-like experiments, researchers can also build
experiments that are more field-like. For example, Centola (2010) built a
digital field experiment to study the effect of social network structure on
the spread of behavior. His research question required him to observe the
same behavior spreading in populations that had different social network
structures but were otherwise indistinguishable. The only way to do this was
with a bespoke, custom-built experiment. In this case, Centola built a web-
based health community.
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
181

Centola recruited about 1,500 participants through advertising on health
websites. When participants arrived at the online community—which was
called the Healthy Lifestyle Network—they provided informed consent and
were then assigned “health buddies.” Because of the way Centola assigned
these health buddies, he was able to knit together different social network
structures in different groups. Some groups were built to have random net-
works (where everyone was equally likely to be connected), while others were
built to have clustered networks (where connections are more locally dense).
Then, Centola introduced a new behavior into each network: the chance
to register for a new website with additional health information. Whenever
anyone signed up for this new website, all of her health buddies received an
email announcing this behavior. Centola found that this behavior—signing
up for the new website—spread further and faster in the clustered network
than in the random network, a finding that was contrary to some existing
theories.
Overall, building your own experiment gives you much more control; it
enables you to construct the best possible environment to isolate what you
want to study. It is hard to imagine how the two experiments that I have just
described could have been performed in an already existing environment.
Further, building your own system decreases ethical concerns around experi-
menting in existing systems. When you build your own experiment, however,
you run into many of the problems that are encountered in lab experiments:
recruiting participants and concerns about realism. A final downside is that
building your own experiment can be costly and time-consuming, although,
as these examples show, the experiments can range from relatively simple
environments (such as the study of voting by Huber, Hill, and Lenz (2012))
to relatively complex environments (such as the study of networks and
contagion by Centola (2010)).
4.5.3 Build your own product
Building your own product is a high-risk, high-reward approach. But,
if it works, you can beneﬁt from a positive feedback loop that enables
distinctive research.
Taking the approach of building your own experiment one step further,
some researchers actually build their own products. These products attract
182
CHAPTER 4

users and then serve as platforms for experiments and other kinds of
research. For example, a group of researchers at the University of Minnesota
created MovieLens, which provides free, noncommercial personalized movie
recommendations. MovieLens has operated continuously since 1997, and
during this time 250,000 registered users have provided more than 20 million
ratings of more than 30,000 movies (Harper and Konstan 2015). MovieLens
has used the active community of users to conduct wonderful research
ranging from testing social science theories about contributions to public
goods (Beenen et al. 2004; Cosley et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2010; Ren et al. 2012)
to addressing algorithmic challenges in recommendation systems (Rashid
et al. 2002; Drenner et al. 2006; Harper, Sen, and Frankowski 2007; Ekstrand
et al. 2015); for a full review, see Harper and Konstan (2015). Many of
these experiments would not have been possible without researchers having
complete control over a real working product.
Unfortunately, building your own product is incredibly difficult, and
you should think of it like creating a start-up company: high-risk, high-
reward. If successful, this approach offers much of the control that comes
from building your own experiment with the realism and participants that
come from working in existing systems. Further, this approach is potentially
able to create a positive feedback loop where more research leads to a
better product, which leads to more users, which leads to more researchers,
and so on (figure 4.16). In other words, once a positive feedback loop
kicks in, research should get easier and easier. Even though this approach
is very difficult currently, my hope is that it will become more practical
as technology improves. Until then, however, if a researcher want to control
a product, the more direct strategy is to partner with a company, the topic I’ll
address next.
4.5.4 Partner with the powerful
Partnering can reduce costs and increase scale, but it can alter the
kinds of participants, treatments, and outcomes that you can use.
The alternative to doing it yourself is partnering with a powerful organization
such as a company, government, or NGO. The advantage of working with a
partner is that they can enable you to run experiments that you just can’t do
by yourself. For example, one of the experiments that I’ll tell you about below

Figure 4.16: If you can successfully build your own product, you can benefit from a positive
feedback loop: research leads to a better product, which leads to more users, which leads to
even more research. These kinds of positive feedback loops are incredibly difficult to create,
but they can enable research that would not be possible otherwise. MovieLens is an example
of a research project that has succeeded in creating a positive feedback loop (Harper and
Konstan 2015).
involved 61 million participants—no individual researcher could achieve that
scale. At the same time that partnering increases what you can do, it also
constrains you. For example, most companies will not allow you to run an
experiment that could harm their business or their reputation. Working with
partners also means that when it comes time to publish, you may come
under pressure to “re-frame” your results, and some partners might even
try to block the publication of your work if it makes them look bad. Finally,
partnering also comes with costs related to developing and maintaining these
collaborations.
The core challenge that has to be solved to make these partnerships
successful is finding a way to balance the interests of both parties, and a
helpful way to think about that balance is Pasteur’s Quadrant (Stokes 1997).
Many researchers think that if they are working on something practical—
something that might be of interest to a partner—then they cannot be doing
real science. This mindset will make it very difficult to create successful
partnerships, and it also happens to be completely wrong. The problem
with this way of thinking is wonderfully illustrated by the path-breaking
research of the biologist Louis Pasteur. While working on a commercial
fermentation project to convert beet juice into alcohol, Pasteur discovered
a new class of microorganism that eventually led to the germ theory of
disease. This discovery solved a very practical problem—it helped improve
the process of fermentation—and it led to a major scientific advance. Thus,
rather than thinking about research with practical applications as being in

Figure 4.17: Pasteur’s Quadrant (Stokes, 1997). Rather than thinking of research as either
“basic” or “applied,” it is better to think of it as motivated by use (or not) and seeking
fundamental understanding (or not). An example of research that both is motivated by use
and seeks fundamental understanding is Pasteur’s work on converting beet juice into alcohol
that lead to the germ theory of disease. This is the kind of work that is best suited for
partnerships with the powerful. Examples of work that is motivated by use but that does not
seek fundamental understanding come from Thomas Edison, and examples of work that is not
motivated by use but that seeks understanding come from Niels Bohr. See Stokes (1997) for
a more thorough discussion of this framework and each of these cases. Adapted from Stokes
(1997), figure 3.5.
conflict with true scientific research, it is better to think of these as two
separate dimensions. Research can be motivated by use (or not), and research
can seek fundamental understanding (or not). Critically, some research—like
Pasteur’s—can be motivated by use and seeking fundamental understand-
ing (figure 4.17). Research in Pasteur’s Quadrant—research that inherently
advances two goals—is ideal for collaborations between researchers and
partners. Given that background, I’ll describe two experimental studies with
partnerships: one with a company and one with an NGO.
Large companies, particularly tech companies, have developed incredibly
sophisticated infrastructure for running complex experiments. In the tech
industry, these experiments are often called A/B tests because they compare
the effectiveness of two treatments: A and B. Such experiments are frequently
run for things like increasing click-through rates on ads, but the same
experimental infrastructure can also be used for research that advances
scientific understanding. An example that illustrates the potential of this
kind of research is a study conducted by a partnership between researchers
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
185

at Facebook and the University of California, San Diego, on the effects of
different messages on voter turnout (Bond et al. 2012).
On November 2, 2010—the day of the US congressional elections—all 61
million Facebook users who lived in the United States and were 18 and older
took part in an experiment about voting. Upon visiting Facebook, users were
randomly assigned into one of three groups, which determined what banner
(if any) was placed at the top of their News Feed (figure 4.18):
• a control group
• an informational message about voting with a clickable “I Voted”
button and a counter (Info)
• an informational message about voting with a clickable “I Voted”
button and a counter plus names and pictures of their friends who had
already clicked the “I Voted” (Info + Social).
Bond and colleagues studied two main outcomes: reported voting behavior
and actual voting behavior. First, they found that people in the Info + Social
group were about two percentage points more likely than people in the
Info group to click “I Voted” (about 20% versus 18%). Further, after the
researchers merged their data with publicly available voting records for about
six million people, they found that people in the Info + Social group were
0.39 percentage points more likely to actually vote than those in the control
group and that people in the Info group were just as likely to vote as those in
the control group (figure 4.18).
The results of this experiment show that some online get-out-the-vote
messages are more effective than others and that a researcher’s estimate of
the effectiveness can depend on whether the outcome is reported voting
or actual voting. This experiment unfortunately does not offer any clues
about the mechanisms through which the social information—which some
researchers have playfully called a “face pile”—increased voting. It could be
that the social information increased the probability that someone noticed
the banner or that it increased the probability that someone who noticed the
banner actually voted or both. Thus, this experiment provides an interesting
finding that further researchers will likely explore (see, e.g., Bakshy, Eckles,
et al. (2012)).
In addition to advancing the goals of the researchers, this experiment also
advanced the goal of the partner organization (Facebook). If you change the

behavior studied from voting to buying soap, then you can see that the study
has the exact same structure as an experiment to measure the effect of online
ads (see, e.g., Lewis and Rao (2015)). These ad effectiveness studies frequently
measure the effect of exposure to online ads—the treatments in Bond et al.
(2012) are basically ads for voting—on offline behavior. Thus, this research
could advance Facebook’s ability to study the effectiveness of online ads and
could help Facebook convince potential advertisers that Facebook ads are
effective at changing behavior.
Even though the interests of the researchers and partners were mostly
aligned in this study, they were also partially in tension. In particular, the
allocation of participants to the three groups—control, Info, and Info +
Social—was tremendously imbalanced: 98% of the sample was assigned to
Info + Social. This imbalanced allocation is inefficient statistically, and a
much better allocation for the researchers would have had one-third of
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
187

the participants in each group. But the imbalanced allocation happened
because Facebook wanted everyone to receive the Info + Social treatment.
Fortunately, the researchers convinced them to hold back 1% for a related
treatment and 1% for a control group. Without the control group, it would
have been basically impossible to measure the effect of the Info + Social
treatment because it would have been a “perturb and observe" experiment
rather than a randomized controlled experiment. This example provides a
valuable practical lesson for working with partners: sometimes you create an
experiment by convincing someone to deliver a treatment and sometimes
you create an experiment by convincing someone not to deliver a treatment
(i.e., to create a control group).
Partnership does not always need to involve tech companies and A/B
tests with millions of participants. For example, Alexander Coppock, Andrew
Guess, and John Ternovski (2016) partnered with an environmental NGO—
the League of Conservation Voters—to run experiments testing different
strategies for promoting social mobilization. The researchers used the NGO’s
Twitter account to send out both public tweets and private direct messages
that attempted to prime different types of identities. They then measured
which of these messages were most effective for encouraging people to sign a
petition and retweet information about a petition.
Overall, partnering with the powerful enables to you operate at a scale
that is otherwise hard to do, and table 4.3 provides other examples of
partnerships between researchers and organizations. Partnering can be much
easier than building your own experiment. But these advantages come with
disadvantages: partnerships can limit the kinds of participants, treatments,
and outcomes that you can study. Further, these partnerships can lead to
ethical challenges. The best way to spot an opportunity for a partnership is
to notice a real problem that you can solve while you are doing interesting
science. If you are not used to this way of looking at the world, it can be
hard to spot problems in Pasteur’s Quadrant, but, with practice, you’ll start
to notice them more and more.

Whether you are doing things yourself or working with a partner, I’d like
to offer four pieces of advice that I’ve found particularly helpful in my own

work. The first two pieces of advice apply to any experiment, while the second
two are much more specific to digital-age experiments.
My first piece of advice for when you are doing an experiment is that you
should think as much as possible before any data have been collected. This
probably seems obvious to researchers accustomed to running experiments,
but it is very important for those accustomed to working with big data
sources (see chapter 2). With such sources, most of the work is done after
you have the data, but experiments are the opposite: most of the work should
be done before you collect data. One of the best ways to force yourself to think
carefully before you collect data is to create and register an pre-analysis plan
for your experiment in which you basically describe the analysis that you

189

will conduct (Schulz et al. 2010; Gerber et al. 2014; Simmons, Nelson, and
Simonsohn 2011; Lin and Green 2016).
My second piece of general advice is that no single experiment is going
to be perfect, and, because of that, you should consider designing a series
of experiments that reinforce each other. I’ve heard this described as the
armada strategy; rather than trying to build one massive battleship, you
should build lots of smaller ships with complementary strengths. These
kinds of multi-experiment studies are routine in psychology, but they are
rare elsewhere. Fortunately, the low cost of some digital experiments makes
multi-experiment studies easier.
Given that general background, I’d now like to offer two pieces of advice
that are more specific to designing digital age experiments: create zero vari-
able cost data (section 4.6.1) and build ethics into your design (section 4.6.2).
4.6.1 Create zero variable cost data
The key to running large experiments is to drive your variable cost to
zero. The best ways to do this are automation and designing
enjoyable experiments.
Digital experiments can have dramatically different cost structures, and this
enables researchers to run experiments that were impossible in the past.
One way to think about this difference is to note that experiments generally
have two types of costs: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are costs
that remain unchanged regardless of of the number of participants. For
example, in a lab experiment, fixed costs might be the costs of renting space
and buying furniture. Variable costs, on the other hand, change depending
on the number of participants. For example, in a lab experiment, variable
costs might come from paying staff and participants. In general, analog
experiments have low fixed costs and high variable costs, while digital
experiments have high fixed costs and low variable costs (figure 4.19).
Even though digital experiments have low variable costs, you can create
a lot of exciting opportunities when you drive the variable cost all the
way to zero.
There are two main elements of variable cost—payments to staff and
payments to participants—and each of these can be driven to zero using
different strategies. Payments to staff stem from the work that research

Figure 4.19: Schematic of cost structures in analog and digital experiments. In general,
analog experiments have low fixed costs and high variable costs, whereas digital experiments

assistants do recruiting participants, delivering treatments, and measuring
outcomes. For example, the analog field experiment of Schultz and colleagues
(2007) on electricity usage required research assistants to travel to each
home to deliver the treatment and read the electric meter (figure 4.3). All
of this effort by research assistants meant that adding a new household to
the study would have added to the cost. On the other hand, for the digital
field experiment of Restivo and van de Rijt (2012) on the effect of awards
on Wikipedia editors, researchers could add more participants at virtually no
cost. A general strategy for reducing variable administrative costs is to replace
human work (which is expensive) with computer work (which is cheap).
Roughly, you can ask yourself: Can this experiment run while everyone on
my research team is sleeping? If the answer is yes, you’ve done a great job of
automation.
The second main type of variable cost is payments to participants. Some
researchers have used Amazon Mechanical Turk and other online labor
markets to decrease the payments that are needed for participants. To drive
variable costs all the way to zero, however, a different approach is needed.
For a long time, researchers have designed experiments that are so boring
they have to pay people to participate. But what if you could create an
experiment that people want to be in? This may sound far-fetched, but
I’ll give you an example below from my own work, and there are more

examples in table 4.4. Note that this idea of designing enjoyable experiments
echoes some of the themes in chapter 3 regarding designing more enjoy-
able surveys and in chapter 5 regarding the design of mass collaboration.
Thus, I think that participant enjoyment—what might also be called user
experience—will be an increasingly important part of research design in the
digital age.
If you want to create experiments with zero variable costs, you’ll need
to ensure that everything is fully automated and that participants don’t
require any payment. In order to show how this is possible, I’ll describe my
dissertation research on the success and failure of cultural products.
My dissertation was motivated by the puzzling nature of success for
cultural products. Hit songs, best-selling books, and blockbuster movies are
much, much more successful than average. Because of this, the markets
for these products are often called “winner-take-all” markets. Yet, at the
same time, which particular song, book, or movie will become successful
is incredibly unpredictable. The screenwriter William Goldman (1989) ele-
gantly summed up lots of academic research by saying that, when it comes
to predicting success, “nobody knows anything.” The unpredictability of
winner-take-all markets made me wonder how much of success is a result
of quality and how much is just luck. Or, expressed slightly differently, if we
could create parallel worlds and have them all evolve independently, would
the same songs become popular in each world? And, if not, what might be a
mechanism that causes these differences?
In order to answer these questions, we—Peter Dodds, Duncan Watts (my
dissertation advisor), and I—ran a series of online field experiments. In

particular, we built a website called MusicLab where people could discover
new music, and we used it for a series of experiments. We recruited par-
ticipants by running banner ads on a teen-interest website (figure 4.20) and
through mentions in the media. Participants arriving at our website provided
informed consent, completed a short background questionnaire, and were
randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions—independent and
social influence. In the independent condition, participants made decisions
about which songs to listen to, given only the names of the bands and the
songs. While listening to a song, participants were asked to rate it after
which they had the opportunity (but not the obligation) to download the
song. In the social influence condition, participants had the same experience,
except they could also see how many times each song had been downloaded

for each participant. In experiment 2, participants in the social influence condition were

by previous participants. Furthermore, participants in the social influence
condition were randomly assigned to one of eight parallel worlds, each of
which evolved independently (figure 4.21). Using this design, we ran two
related experiments. In the first, we presented the songs in an unsorted grid,
which provided a weak signal of popularity. In the second experiment, we
presented the songs in a ranked list, which provided a much stronger signal
of popularity (figure 4.22).
We found that the popularity of the songs differed across the worlds,
suggesting that luck played an important role in success. For example, in
one world the song “Lockdown” by 52Metro came in 1st out of 48 songs,
while in another world it came in 40th. This was exactly the same song
competing against all the same other songs, but in one world it got lucky
and in the others it did not. Further, by comparing results across the two
experiments, we found that social influence increases the winner-take-all
nature of these markets, which perhaps suggests the importance of skill. But,
looking across the worlds (which can’t be done outside of this kind of parallel
worlds experiment), we found that social influence actually increased the
importance of luck. Further, surprisingly, it was the songs of highest appeal
where luck mattered most (figure 4.23).

y-axis is the market share of the same song in the eight social influence worlds, which serves

participants experienced—specifically, the change in layout from experiment 1 to experiment
2 (figure 4.22)—caused success to become more unpredictable, especially for the songs with
the highest appeal. Adapted from Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006), figure 3.
MusicLab was able to run at essentially zero variable cost because of the
way that it was designed. First, everything was fully automated so it was able
to run while I was sleeping. Second, the compensation was free music, so
there was no variable participant compensation cost. The use of music as
compensation also illustrates how there is sometimes a trade-off between
fixed and variable costs. Using music increased the fixed costs because I had
to spend time securing permission from the bands and preparing reports for
them about participants’ reaction to their music. But in this case, increasing
fixed costs in order to decrease variables costs was the right thing to do; that’s
what enabled us to run an experiment that was about 100 times larger than a
standard lab experiment.
Further, the MusicLab experiments show that zero variable cost does
not have to be an end in itself; rather, it can be a means to running a
new kind of experiment. Notice that we did not use all of our participants
to run a standard social influence lab experiment 100 times. Instead, we

did something different, which you could think of as switching from a
psychological experiment to a sociological one (Hedström 2006). Rather
than focusing on individual decision-making, we focused our experiment on
popularity, a collective outcome. This switch to a collective outcome meant
that we required about 700 participants to produce a single data point (there
were 700 people in each of the parallel worlds). That scale was only possible
because of the cost structure of the experiment. In general, if researchers
want to study how collective outcomes arise from individual decisions, group
experiments such as MusicLab are very exciting. In the past, they have been
logistically difficult, but those difficulties are fading because of the possibility
of zero variable cost data.
In addition to illustrating the benefits of zero variable cost data, the
MusicLab experiments also show a challenge with this approach: high fixed
costs. In my case, I was extremely lucky to be able to work with a talented
web developer named Peter Hausel for about six months to construct the
experiment. This was only possible because my advisor, Duncan Watts, had
received a number of grants to support this kind of research. Technology has
improved since we built MusicLab in 2004, so it would be much easier to
build an experiment like this now. But high fixed cost strategies are really
only possible for researchers who can somehow cover those costs.
In conclusion, digital experiments can have dramatically different cost
structures than analog experiments. If you want to run really large experi-
ments, you should try to decrease your variable cost as much as possible and
ideally all the way to zero. You can do this by automating the mechanics
of your experiment (e.g., replacing human time with computer time) and
designing experiments that people want to be in. Researchers who can design
experiments with these features will be able to run new kinds of experiments
that were not possible in the past. However, the ability to create zero variable
cost experiments can raise new ethical questions, the topic that I shall now
address.
4.6.2 Build ethics into your design: replace, reﬁne, and reduce
Make your experiment more humane by replacing experiments with
non-experimental studies, reﬁning the treatments, and reducing the
number of participants.

CHAPTER 4

The second piece of advice that I’d like to offer about designing digital
experiments concerns ethics. As the Restivo and van de Rijt experiment
on barnstars in Wikipedia shows, decreased cost means that ethics will
become an increasingly important part of research design. In addition to
the ethical frameworks guiding human subjects research that I’ll describe
in chapter 6, researchers designing digital experiments can also draw on
ethical ideas from a different source: the ethical principles developed to
guide experiments involving animals. In particular, in their landmark book
Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, Russell and Burch (1959)
proposed three principles that should guide animal research: replace, refine,
and reduce. I’d like to propose that these three R’s can also be used—in
a slightly modified form—to guide the design of human experiments. In
particular,
• Replace: Replace experiments with less invasive methods if possible.
• Refine: Refine the treatment to make it as harmless as possible.
• Reduce: Reduce the number of participants in your experiment as much
as possible.
In order to make these three R’s concrete and show how they can
potentially lead to better and more humane experimental design, I’ll describe
an online field experiment that generated ethical debate. Then, I’ll describe
how the three R’s suggest concrete and practical changes to the design of
the experiment.
One of the most ethically debated digital field experiments was conducted
by Adam Kramer, Jamie Guillory, and Jeffrey Hancock (2014) and has
come to be called “Emotional Contagion.” The experiment took place on
Facebook and was motivated by a mix of scientific and practical questions.
At the time, the dominant way that users interacted with Facebook was
the News Feed, an algorithmically curated set of Facebook status updates
from a user’s Facebook friends. Some critics of Facebook had suggested
that because the News Feed has mostly positive posts—friends showing off
their latest party—it could cause users to feel sad because their lives seemed
less exciting in comparison. On the other hand, maybe the effect is exactly
the opposite: maybe seeing your friend having a good time would make
you feel happy. In order to address these competing hypotheses—and to
advance our understanding of how a person’s emotions are impacted by

her friends’ emotions—Kramer and colleagues ran an experiment. They
placed about 700,000 users into four groups for one week: a “negativity-
reduced” group, for whom posts with negative words (e.g., “sad”) were
randomly blocked from appearing in the News Feed; a “positivity-reduced”
group, for whom posts with positive words (e.g., “happy”) were randomly
blocked; and two control groups. In the control group for the “negativity-
reduced” group, posts were randomly blocked at the same rate as those in
the “negativity-reduced” group, but without regard to the emotional content.
The control group for the “positivity-reduced” group was constructed in a
parallel fashion. The design of this experiment illustrates that the appropriate
control group is not always one with no changes. Rather, sometimes, the
198
CHAPTER 4

control group receives a treatment in order to create the precise comparison
that a research question requires. In all cases, the posts that were blocked
from the News Feed were still available to users through other parts of the
Facebook website.
Kramer and colleagues found that for participants in the positivity-
reduced condition, the percentage of positive words in their status updates
decreased and the percentage of negative words increased. On the other
hand, for participants in the negativity-reduced condition, the percentage of
positive words increased and that of negative words decreased (figure 4.24).
However, these effects were quite small: the difference in positive and
negative words between treatments and controls was about 1 in 1,000 words.
Before discussing the ethical issues raised by this experiment, I’d like to
describe three scientific issues using some of the ideas from earlier in the
chapter. First, it is not clear how the actual details of the experiment connect
to the theoretical claims; in other words, there are questions about construct
validity. It is not clear that the positive and negative word counts are actually
a good indicator of the emotional state of participants, because (1) it is not
clear that the words that people post are a good indicator of their emotions
and (2) it is not clear that the particular sentiment analysis technique that the
researchers used is able to reliably infer emotions (Beasley and Mason 2015;
Panger 2016). In other words, there might be a bad measure of a biased signal.
Second, the design and analysis of the experiment tells us nothing about who
was most impacted (i.e., there is no analysis of heterogeneity of treatment
effects) and what the mechanism might be. In this case, the researchers had
lots of information about the participants, but they were essentially treated
as widgets in the analysis. Third, the effect size in this experiment was very
small; the difference between the treatment and control conditions is about 1
in 1,000 words. In their paper, Kramer and colleagues make the case that an
effect of this size is important because hundreds of millions of people access
their News Feed each day. In other words, they argue that even if effects are
small for each person, they are big in aggregate. Even if you were to accept
this argument, it is still not clear if an effect of this size is important regarding
the more general scientific question about the spread of emotions (Prentice
and Miller 1992).
In addition to these scientific questions, just days after this paper was
published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, there was
an enormous outcry from both researchers and the press (I’ll describe the
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
199

arguments in this debate in more detail in chapter 6). The issues raised in this
debate caused the journal to publish a rare “editorial expression of concern”
about the ethics and the ethical review process for the research (Verma 2014).
Given that background about Emotional Contagion, I would now like
to show that the three R’s can suggest concrete, practical improvements
for real studies (whatever you might personally think about the ethics of
this particular experiment). The first R is replace: researchers should seek
to replace experiments with less invasive and risky techniques, if possible.
For example, rather than running a randomized controlled experiment,
the researchers could have exploited a natural experiment. As described in
chapter 2, natural experiments are situations where something happens in
the world that approximates the random assignment of treatments (e.g.,
a lottery to decide who will be drafted into the military). The ethical
advantage of a natural experiment is that the researcher does not have
to deliver treatments: the environment does that for you. For example,
almost concurrently with the Emotional Contagion experiment, Coviello
et al. (2014) were exploiting what could be called an Emotional Contagion
natural experiment. Coviello and colleagues discovered that people post
more negative words and fewer positive words on days where it is raining.
Therefore, by using random variation in the weather, they were able to study
the effect of changes in the News Feed without the need to intervene at all. It
was as if the weather was running their experiment for them. The details of
their procedure are a bit complicated, but the most important point for our
purposes here is that by using a natural experiment, Coviello and colleagues
were able to learn about the spread of emotions without the need to run their
own experiment.
The second of the three Rs is refine: researchers should seek to refine their
treatments to make them as harmless as possible. For example, rather than
blocking content that was either positive or negative, the researchers could
have boosted content that was positive or negative. This boosting design
would have changed the emotional content of participants’ News Feeds, but
it would have addressed one of the concerns that critics expressed: that the
experiments could have caused participants to miss important information in
their News Feed. With the design used by Kramer and colleagues, a message
that is important is as likely to be blocked as one that is not. However, with
a boosting design, the messages that would be displaced would be those that
are less important.
200
CHAPTER 4

Finally, the third R is reduce: researchers should seek to reduce the number
of participants in their experiment to the minimum needed to achieve
their scientific objective. In analog experiments, this happened naturally
because of the high variable costs of participants. But in digital experiments,
particularly those with zero variable cost, researchers don’t face a cost
constraint on the size of their experiment, and this has the potential to lead
to unnecessarily large experiments.
For example, Kramer and colleagues could have used pre-treatment infor-
mation about their participants—such as pre-treatment posting behavior—to
make their analysis more efficient. More specifically, rather than comparing
the proportion of positive words in the treatment and control conditions,
Kramer and colleagues could have compared the change in the proportion
of positive words between conditions; an approach that is sometimes called
a mixed design (figure 4.5) and sometimes called a difference-in-differences
estimator. That is, for each participant, the researchers could have created a
change score (post-treatment behavior—pre-treatment behavior) and then
compared the change scores of participants in the treatment and control
conditions. This difference-in-differences approach is more efficient sta-
tistically, which means that researchers can achieve the same statistical
confidence using much smaller samples.
Without having the raw data, it is difficult to know exactly how much
more efficient a difference-in-differences estimator would have been in this
case. But we can look at other related experiments for a rough idea. Deng
et al. (2013) reported that by using a form of the difference-in-differences
estimator, they were able to reduce the variance of their estimates by about
50% in three different online experiments; similar results have been reported
by Xie and Aurisset (2016). This 50% variance reduction means that the
Emotional Contagion researchers might have been able to cut their sample
in half if they had used a slightly different analysis method. In other words,
with a tiny change in the analysis, 350,000 people might have been spared
participation in the experiment.
At this point, you might be wondering why researchers should care
if 350,000 people were in Emotional Contagion unnecessarily. There are
two particular features of Emotional Contagion that make concern with
excessive size appropriate, and these features are shared by many digital field
experiments: (1) there is uncertainty about whether the experiment will cause
harm to at least some participants and (2) participation was not voluntary.
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
201

It seems reasonable to try to keep experiments that have these features as
small as possible.
To be clear, the desire to reduce the size of your experiments does not
mean that you should not run large, zero variable cost experiments. It just
means that your experiments should not be any larger than you need to
achieve your scientific objective. One important way to make sure that an
experiment is appropriately sized is to conduct a power analysis (Cohen
1988). In the the analog age, researchers generally did power analysis to make
sure that their study was not too small (i.e., under-powered). Now, however,
researchers should do power analysis to make sure that their study is not too
big (i.e., over-powered).
In conclusion, the three R’s—replace, refine, and reduce—provide prin-
ciples that can help researchers build ethics into their experimental designs.
Of course, each of these possible changes changes to Emotional Contagion
introduces trade-offs. For example, evidence from natural experiments is not
always as clean as that from randomized experiments, and boosting content
might have been logistically more difficult to implement than blocking
content. So, the purpose of suggesting these changes was not to second-guess
the decisions of other researchers. Rather, it was to illustrate how the three
R’s could be applied in a realistic situation. In fact, the issue of trade-offs
comes up all the time in research design, and in the digital-age, these these
trade-offs will increasingly involve ethical considerations. Later, in chapter
6, I’ll offer some principles and ethical frameworks that can help researchers
understand and discuss these trade-offs.
4.7
Conclusion
The digital age offers researchers the ability to run experiments that were
not possible previously. Not only can researchers run massive experiments,
they can also take advantage of the specific nature of digital experiments
to improve validity, estimate heterogeneity of treatment effects, and isolate
mechanisms. These experiments can be done in fully digital environments or
using digital devices in the physical world.
As this chapter has shown, these experiments can be done in partnership
with powerful companies, or they can be done entirely by the researcher; you
don’t need to work at a big tech company to run a digital experiment. If you
do design your own experiment, you can drive your variable cost to zero,
202
CHAPTER 4

and you can use the three R’s—replace, refine, and reduce—to build ethics
into your design. Researchers’ increasing power to intervene in the lives
of millions of people means that we should have a corresponding increase
in our attention to ethical research design. With great power comes great
responsibility.
Mathematical notes
I think the best way to understand experiments is the potential outcomes
framework (which I discussed in the mathematical notes in chapter 2).
The potential outcomes framework has a close relationships to the ideas
from design-based sampling that I described in chapter 3 (Aronow and
Middleton 2013; Imbens and Rubin (2015), chapter 6). This appendix has
been written in such a way as to emphasize that connection. This emphasis
is a bit non-traditional, but I think that the connection between sampling
and experiments is helpful: it means that if you know something about
sampling, then you know something about experiments, and vice versa.
As I’ll show in these notes, the potential outcomes framework reveals the
strength of randomized controlled experiments for estimating causal effects,
and it shows the limitations of what can be done with even perfectly executed
experiments.
In this appendix, I’ll describe the potential outcomes framework, duplicat-
ing some of the material from the mathematical notes in chapter 2 in order to
make these notes more self-contained. Then I’ll describe some helpful results
about the precision of estimates of the average treatment effects, including
a discussion of optimal allocation and difference-in-differences estimators.
This appendix draws heavily on Gerber and Green (2012).
Potential outcomes framework
In order to illustrate the potential outcomes framework, let’s return to
Restivo and van de Rijt’s experiment to estimate the the effect of receiving
a barnstar on future contributions to Wikipedia. The potential outcomes
framework has three main elements: units, treatments, and potential out-
comes. In the case of Restivo and van de Rijt, the units were deserving
editors—those in the top 1% of contributors—who had not yet received a
barnstar. We can index these editors by i = 1 . . . N. The treatments in their

experiment were “barnstar” or “no barnstar,” and I’ll write Wi = 1 if person
i is in the treatment condition and Wi = 0 otherwise. The third element
of the potential outcomes framework is the most important: the potential
outcomes. These are bit more conceptually difficult, because they involve
“potential” outcomes—things that could happen. For each Wikipedia editor,
one can imagine the number of edits that she would make in the treatment
condition (Yi(1)) and the number that she would make in the control
condition (Yi(0)).
Note that this choice of units, treatments, and outcomes defines what
can be learned from this experiment. For example, without any additional
assumptions, Restivo and van de Rijt cannot say anything about the effects
of barnstars on all Wikipedia editors or on outcomes such as edit quality.
In general, the choice of units, treatments, and outcomes must be based on
the goals of the study.
Given these potential outcomes—which are summarized in table 4.5—one
can define the causal effect of the treatment for person i as
τi = Yi(1) −Yi(0)
(4.1)
To me, this equation is the clearest way to define a causal effect, and.
although extremely simple, this framework turns out to generalizable in
many important and interesting ways (Imbens and Rubin 2015).
If we define causality in this way, however, we run into a problem. In
almost all cases, we don’t get to observe both potential outcomes. That is,
a specific Wikipedia editor either received a barnstar or not. Therefore, we
observe one of the potential outcomes—Yi(1) or Yi(0)—but not both. The
204
CHAPTER 4

inability to observe both potential outcomes is such a major problem that
Holland (1986) called it the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.
Fortunately, when we are doing research, we don’t just have one person,
we have many people, and this offers a way around the Fundamental Problem
of Causal Inference. Rather than attempting to estimate the individual-level
treatment effect, we can estimate the average treatment effect:
ATE = 1
N
N

i=1
τi
(4.2)
This is still expressed in terms of the τi, which are unobservable, but with
some algebra (eq. 2.8 of Gerber and Green (2012)), we get
ATE = 1
N
N

i=1
Yi(1) −1
N
N

i=1
Yi(0)
(4.3)
This shows that if we can estimate the population average outcome under
treatment (N−1 N
i=1 Yi(1)) and the population average outcome under
control (N−1 N
i=1 Yi(1)), then we can estimate the average treatment effect,
even without estimating the treatment effect for any particular person.
Now that I’ve defined our estimand—the thing we are trying to estimate—
I’ll turn to how we can actually estimate it with data. I like to think about this
estimation challenge as a sampling problem (think back to the mathematical
notes in chapter 3). Imagine that we randomly pick some people to observe
in the treatment condition, and we randomly pick some people to observe
in the control condition; then we can estimate the average outcome in each
condition:

ATE =
1

average edits, treatment

Nc

i:Wi=0
Yi(0)



average edits, control
(4.4)
where Nt and Nc are the numbers of people in the treatment and control
conditions. Equation 4.4 is a difference-of-means estimator. Because of the
sampling design, we know that the first term is an unbiased estimator for
the average outcome under treatment and the second term is an unbiased
estimator under control.
Another way to think about what randomization enables is that it ensures
that the comparison between treatment and control groups is fair because
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
205

randomization ensures that the two groups will resemble each other. This
resemblance holds for things we have measured (say the number of edits
in the 30 days before the experiment) and the things we have not mea-
sured (say gender). This ability to ensure balance on both observed and
unobserved factors is critical. To see the power of automatic balancing on
unobserved factors, let’s imagine that future research finds that men are
more responsive to awards than women. Would that invalidate the results
of Restivo and van de Rijt’s experiment? No. By randomizing, they ensured
that all unobservables would be balanced, in expectation. This protection
against the unknown is very powerful, and it is an important way that
experiments are different from the non-experimental techniques described
in chapter 2.
In addition to defining the treatment effect for an entire population, it is
possible to define a treatment effect for a subset of people. This is typically
called a conditional average treatment effect (CATE). For example, in the
study by Restivo and van de Rijt, let’s imagine that Xi is whether the editor
was above or below the median number of edits during the 90 days before
the experiment. One could calculate the treatment effect separately for these
light and heavy editors.
The potential outcomes framework is a powerful way to think about causal
inference and experiments. However, there are two additional complexities
that you should keep in mind. These two complexities are often lumped
together under the term Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA).
The first part of SUTVA is the assumption that the only thing that matters
for person i’s outcome is whether that person was in the treatment or control
condition. In other words, it is assumed that person i is not impacted by the
treatment given to other people. This is sometimes called “no interference”
or “no spillovers” and can be written as
Yi(Wi, W−i) = Yi(Wi)
∀W−i
(4.5)
where W−i is a vector of treatment statuses for everyone except person i. One
way that this can be violated is if the treatment from one person spills over
onto another person, either positively or negatively. Returning to Restivo
and van de Rijt’s experiment, imagine two friends i and j and that person
i receives a barnstar and j does not. If i receiving the barnstar causes j
to edit more (out of a sense of competition) or edit less (out of a sense of
206
CHAPTER 4

despair), then SUTVA has been violated. It can also be violated if the impact
of the treatment depends on the total number of other people receiving
the treatment. For example, if Restivo and van de Rijt had given out 1,000
or 10,000 barnstars instead of 100, this might have impacted the effect of
receiving a barnstar.
The second issue lumped into SUTVA is the assumption that the only
relevant treatment is the one that the researcher delivers; this assumption
is sometimes called no hidden treatments or excludibility. For example, in
Restivo and van de Rijt, it might have been the case that by giving a barnstar
the researchers caused editors to be featured on a popular editors page
and that it was being on the popular editors page—rather than receiving a
barnstar—that caused the change in editing behavior. If this is true, then
the effect of the barnstar is not distinguishable from the effect of being
on the popular editors page. Of course, it is not clear if, from a scientific
perspective, this should be considered attractive or unattractive. That is, you
could imagine a researcher saying that the effect of receiving a barnstar
includes all the subsequent treatments that the barnstar triggers. Or you
could imagine a situation where a research would want to isolate the effect
of barnstars from all these other things. One way to think about it is to
ask if there is anything that leads to what Gerber and Green (2012, p.
41) call a “breakdown in symmetry”? In other words, is there anything
other than the treatment that causes people in the treatment and control
conditions to be treated differently? Concerns about symmetry breaking
are what lead patients in control groups in medical trials to take a placebo
pill. That way, researchers can be sure that the only difference between
the two conditions is the actual medicine and not the experience of taking
the pill.
For more on SUTVA, see section 2.7 of Gerber and Green (2012), section
2.5 of Morgan and Winship (2014), and section 1.6 of Imbens and Rubin
(2015).
Precision
In the previous section, I’ve described how to estimate the average treatment
effect. In this section, I’ll provide some ideas about the variability of those
estimates.
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
207

If you think about estimating the average treatment effect as estimating
the difference between two sample means, then it is possible to show that
the standard error of the average treatment effect is (see Gerber and Green
(2012), eq. 3.4)

where m people were assigned to treatment and N −m to control. Thus,
when thinking about how many people to assign to treatment and how
many to control, you can see that if Var

, then you
want m ≈N/2, as long as the costs of treatment and control are the same.
Equation 4.6 clarifies why the design of Bond and colleagues’ (2012) ex-
periment about the effects of social information on voting (figure 4.18) was
inefficient statistically. Recall that it had 98% of participants in the treatment
condition. This meant that the mean behavior in the control condition was
not estimated as accurately as it could have been, which in turn meant that
the estimated difference between the treatment and control conditions was
not estimated as accurately as it could have been. For more on optimal
allocation of participants to conditions, including when costs differ between
conditions, see List, Sadoff, and Wagner (2011).
Finally, in the main text, I described how a difference-in-differences
estimator, which is typically used in a mixed design, can lead to smaller
variance than a difference-in-means estimator, which is typically used in a
between-subjects design. The quantity that we are trying to estimate with the
difference-in-differences approach is

Roughly, when Xi is very predictive of Yi(1) and Yi(0), then you can get
more precise estimates from a difference-of-differences approach than from
a difference-of-means one. One way to think about this in the context of
Restivo and van de Rijt’s experiment is that there is a lot of natural variation
in the amount that people edit, so this makes comparing the treatment and
control conditions difficult: it is hard to detect a relative small effect in noisy
outcome data. But if you difference-out this naturally occurring variabil-
ity, then there is much less variability, and that makes it easier to detect
a small effect.
See Frison and Pocock (1992) for a precise comparison of difference-
of-means, difference-of-differences, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
in the more general setting where there are multiple measurements pre-
treatment and post-treatment. In particular, they strongly recommend AN-
COVA, which I have not covered here. Further, see McKenzie (2012) for a
discussion of the importance of multiple post-treatment outcome measures.
What to read next
• Introduction (section 4.1)
Questions about causality in social research are often complex and intricate. For
a foundational approach to causality based on causal graphs, see Pearl (2009),
and for a foundational approach based on potential outcomes, see Imbens and
Rubin (2015). For a comparison between these two approaches, see Morgan
and Winship (2014). For a formal approach to defining a confounder, see
VanderWeele and Shpitser (2013).
In this chapter, I have created what seemed like a bright line between our
ability to make causal estimates from experimental and non-experimental data.
However, I think that, in reality, the distinction is more blurred. For example,
everyone accepts that smoking causes cancer, even though no randomized con-
trolled experiment that forces people to smoke has ever been done. For excellent
book-length treatments on making causal estimates from non-experimental
data, see Rosenbaum (2002), Rosenbaum (2010), Shadish, Cook, and Campbell
(2001), and Dunning (2012).
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
209

Chapters 1 and 2 of Freedman, Pisani, and Purves (2007) offer a clear
introduction to the differences between experiments, controlled experiments,
and randomized controlled experiments.
Manzi (2012) provides a fascinating and readable introduction to the philo-
sophical and statistical underpinnings of randomized controlled experiments. It
also provides interesting real-world examples of the power of experimentation
in business. Issenberg (2012) provides a fascinating introduction to the use of
experimentation in political campaigns.
• What are experiments? (section 4.2)
Box, Hunter, and Hunter (2005), Casella (2008), and Athey and Imbens (2016b)
provide good introductions to the statistical aspects of experimental design
and analysis. Further, there are excellent treatments of the use of experiments
in many different fields: economics (Bardsley et al. 2009), sociology (Willer
and Walker 2007; Jackson and Cox 2013), psychology (Aronson et al. 1989),
political science (Morton and Williams 2010), and social policy (Glennerster and
Takavarasha 2013).
The importance of participant recruitment (e.g., sampling) is often under-
appreciated in experimental research. However, if the effect of the treatment
is heterogeneous in the population, then sampling is critical. Longford (1999)
makes this point clearly when he advocates for researchers thinking of experi-
ments as a population survey with haphazard sampling.
• Two dimensions of experiments: lab–ﬁeld and analog–digital
(section 4.3)
I have suggested that there is a continuum between lab and field experiments,
and other researchers have proposed more detailed typologies, in particular ones
that separate the various forms of field experiments (Harrison and List 2004;
Charness, Gneezy, and Kuhn 2013).
A number of papers have compared lab and field experiments in the abstract
(Falk and Heckman 2009; Cialdini 2009) and in terms of outcomes of specific
experiments in political science (Coppock and Green 2015), economics (Levitt
and List 2007a, b; Camerer 2011; Al-Ubaydli and List 2013), and psychology
(Mitchell 2012). Jerit, Barabas, and Clifford (2013) offer a nice research design
for comparing results from lab and field experiments. Parigi et al. (2017) describe
how online field experiments can combine some of the characteristics of lab
and field experiments.
Concerns about participants changing their behavior because they know they
are being closely observed are sometimes called demand effects, and they have
been studied in psychology (Orne 1962) and economics (Zizzo 2010). Although
mostly associated with lab experiments, these same issues can cause problems
for field experiments as well. In fact, demand effects are also sometimes called
210
CHAPTER 4

Hawthorne effects, a term that derives from the famous illumination experiments
that began in 1924 at the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company
(Adair 1984; Levitt and List 2011). Both demand effects and Hawthorne effects
are closely related to the idea of reactive measurement discussed in chapter 2
(see also Webb et al. (1966)).
Field experiments have a long history in economics (Levitt and List 2009),
political science (Green and Gerber 2003; Druckman et al. 2006; Druckman
and Lupia 2012), psychology (Shadish 2002), and public policy (Shadish and
Cook 2009). One area of social science where field experiments quickly became
prominent is international development. For a positive review of that work
within economics, see Banerjee and Duflo (2009) and for a critical assessment,
see Deaton (2010). For a review of this work in political science, see Humphreys
and Weinstein (2009). Finally, the ethical challenges arising in field experiments
have been explored in the context of political science (Humphreys 2015; De-
sposato 2016b) and development economics (Baele 2013).
In this section, I suggested that pre-treatment information can be used to
improve the precision of estimated treatment effects, but there is some debate
about this approach; see Freedman (2008), Lin (2013), Berk et al. (2013), and
Bloniarz et al. (2016) for more information.
Finally, there are two other types of experiments performed by social scientists
that don’t fit neatly along the lab–field dimension: survey experiments and social
experiments. Survey experiments are experiments using the infrastructure of
existing surveys and compare responses to alternative versions of the same ques-
tions (some survey experiments are presented in chapter 3); for more on survey
experiments, see Mutz (2011). Social experiments are experiments where the
treatment is some social policy that can only be implemented by a government.
Social experiments are closely related to program evaluation. For more on policy
experiments, see Heckman and Smith (1995), Orr (1998), and Glennerster and
Takavarasha (2013).
• Moving beyond simple experiments (section 4.4)
I’ve chosen to focus on three concepts: validity, heterogeneity of treatment
effects, and mechanisms. These concepts have different names in different fields.
For example, psychologists tend to move beyond simple experiments by focusing
on mediators and moderators (Baron and Kenny 1986). The idea of mediators is
captured by what I call mechanisms, and the idea of moderators is captured by
what I call external validity (e.g., would the results of the experiment be different
if it were run in different situations) and heterogeneity of treatment effects (e.g.,
are the effects larger for some people than for others).
The experiment by Schultz et al. (2007) shows how social theories can be used
to design effective interventions. For a more general argument about the role of
theory in designing effective interventions, see Walton (2014).

• Validity (section 4.4.1)
The concepts of internal and external validity were first introduced by Campbell
(1957). See Shadish, Cook, and Campbell (2001) for a more detailed history and
a careful elaboration of statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct
validity, and external validity.
For an overview of issues related to statistical conclusion validity in
experiments, see Gerber and Green (2012) (from a social science perspective)
and Imbens and Rubin (2015) (from a statistical perspective). Some issues of
statistical conclusion validity that arise specifically in online field experiments
include issues such as computationally efficient methods for creating confidence
intervals with dependent data (Bakshy and Eckles 2013).
Internal validity can be difficult to ensure in complex field experiments. See,
for example, Gerber and Green (2000), Imai (2005), and Gerber and Green
(2005) for debate about the implementation of a complex field experiment about
voting. Kohavi et al. (2012, 2013) provide an introduction to the challenges of
interval validity in online field experiments.
One major threat to internal validity is the possibility of failed randomization.
One potential way to detect such problems is to compare the treatment and
control groups on observable traits. This kind of comparison is called a balance
check. See Hansen and Bowers (2008) for a statistical approach to balance checks
and Mutz and Pemantle (2015) for concerns about balance checks. For example,
using a balance check, Allcott (2011) found some evidence that randomization
was not implemented correctly in three of the Opower experiments (see table
2; sites 2, 6, and 8). For other approaches, see chapter 21 of Imbens and Rubin
(2015).
Other major concerns related to internal validity are (1) one-sided non-
compliance, where not everyone in the treatment group actually received the
treatment, (2) two sided noncompliance, where not everyone in the treatment
group receives the treatment and some people in the control group receive the
treatment, (3) attrition, where outcomes are not measured for some participants,
and (4) interference, where the treatment spills over from people in the treatment
condition to people in the control condition. See chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Gerber
and Green (2012) for more on each of these issues.
For more on construct validity, see Westen and Rosenthal (2003), and for
more on construct validity in big data sources, Lazer (2015) and chapter 2 of this
book.
One aspect of external validity is the setting in which an intervention is
tested. Allcott (2015) provides a careful theoretical and empirical treatment
of site selection bias. This issue is also discussed by Deaton (2010). Another
aspect of external validity is whether alternative operationalizations of the same
intervention will have similar effects. In this case, a comparison between Schultz
et al. (2007) and Allcott (2011) shows that the Opower experiments had a smaller
212
CHAPTER 4

estimated treated effect than the original experiments by Schultz and colleagues
(1.7% versus 5%). Allcott (2011) speculated that the follow-up experiments
had a smaller effect because of the ways in which the treatment differed: a
handwritten emoticon as part of a study sponsored by a university, compared
with a printed emoticon as part of a mass-produced report from a power
company.
• Heterogeneity of treatment effects (section 4.4.2)
For an excellent overview of heterogeneity of treatment effects in field ex-
periments, see chapter 12 of Gerber and Green (2012). For introductions to
heterogeneity of treatment effects in medical trials, see Kent and Hayward
(2007), Longford (1999), and Kravitz, Duan, and Braslow (2004). Considerations
of heterogeneity of treatment effects generally focus on differences based on
pre-treatment characteristics. If you are interested in heterogeneity based on
post-treatment outcomes, then more complex approaches are needed, such as
principal stratification (Frangakis and Rubin 2002); see Page et al. (2015) for a
review.
Many researchers estimate the heterogeneity of treatment effects using linear
regression, but newer methods rely on machine learning; see, for example, Green
and Kern (2012), Imai and Ratkovic (2013), Taddy et al. (2016), and Athey and
Imbens (2016a).
There is some skepticism about findings of heterogeneity of effects because
of multiple comparison problems and “fishing.” There are a variety of statistical
approaches that can help address concerns about multiple comparison (Fink,
McConnell, and Vollmer 2014; List, Shaikh, and Xu 2016). One approach to
concerns about “fishing” is pre-registration, which is becoming increasingly
common in psychology (Nosek and Lakens 2014), political science (Humphreys,
Sierra, and Windt 2013; Monogan 2013; Anderson 2013; Gelman 2013; Laitin
2013), and economics (Olken 2015).
In the study by Costa and Kahn (2013) only about half of the households
in the experiment could be linked to the demographic information. Readers
interested in these details should refer to the original paper.
• Mechanisms (section 4.4.3)
Mechanisms are incredibly important, but they turn out to be very difficult to
study. Research about mechanisms is closely related to the study of mediators in
psychology (but see also VanderWeele (2009) for a precise comparison between
the two ideas). Statistical approaches to finding mechanisms, such as the ap-
proach developed in Baron and Kenny (1986), are quite common. Unfortunately,
it turns out that those procedures depend on some strong assumptions (Bullock,
Green, and Ha 2010) and suffer when there are multiple mechanisms, as one
might expect in many situations (Imai and Yamamoto 2013; VanderWeele and
Vansteelandt 2014). Imai et al. (2011) and Imai and Yamamoto (2013) offer
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
213

some improved statistical methods. Further, VanderWeele (2015) offers a book-
length treatment with a number of important results, including a comprehensive
approach to sensitivity analysis.
A separate approach focuses on experiments that attempt to manipulate the
mechanism directly (e.g., giving sailors vitamin C). Unfortunately, in many
social science settings, there are often multiple mechanisms, and it is hard
to design treatments that change one without changing the others. Some ap-
proaches to experimentally altering mechanisms are described by Imai, Tingley,
and Yamamoto (2013), Ludwig, Kling, and Mullainathan (2011), and Pirlott and
MacKinnon (2016).
Researchers running fully factorial experiments will need to be concerned
about multiple hypothesis testing; see Fink, McConnell, and Vollmer (2014) and
List, Shaikh, and Xu (2016) for more information.
Finally, mechanisms also have a long history in the philosophy of science, as
described by Hedström and Ylikoski (2010).
• Using existing environments (section 4.5.1)
For more on the use of correspondence studies and audit studies to measure
discrimination, see Pager (2007).
• Build your own experiment (section 4.5.2)
The most common way to recruit participants to experiments that you build
is Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Because MTurk mimics aspects of tra-
ditional lab experiments—paying people to complete tasks that they would not
do for free—many researchers have already begun using Turkers (the workers
on MTurk) as experimental participants, resulting in faster and cheaper data
collection than can be achieved in traditional on-campus laboratory experiments
(Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis 2010; Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser 2011;
Mason and Suri 2012; Rand 2012; Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012).
Generally, the biggest advantages of using participants recruited from MTurk
are logistical. Whereas lab experiments can take weeks to run and field experi-
ments can take months to set up, experiments with participants recruited from
MTurk can be run in days. For example, Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz (2012) were
able to recruit 400 subjects in a single day to participate in an eight-minute
experiment. Further, these participants can be recruited for virtually any purpose
(including surveys and mass collaboration, as discussed in chapters 3 and 5).
This ease of recruitment means that researchers can run sequences of related
experiments in rapid succession.
Before recruiting participants from MTurk for your own experiments, there
are four important things that you need to know. First, many researchers have
a nonspecific skepticism of experiments involving Turkers. Because this skepti-
cism is not specific, it is hard to counter with evidence. However, after several
214
CHAPTER 4

years of studies using Turkers, we can now conclude that this skepticism is not
particularly justified. There have been many studies comparing the demograph-
ics of Turkers with those of other populations and many studies comparing the
results of experiments with Turkers with those from other populations. Given all
this work, I think that the best way for you to think about it is that Turkers are
a reasonable convenience sample, much like students but slightly more diverse
(Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012). Thus, just as students are a reasonable pop-
ulation for some, but not all, research, Turkers are a reasonable population for
some, but not all, research. If you are going to work with Turkers, then it makes
sense to read many of these comparative studies and understand their nuances.
Second, researchers have developed best practices for increasing the internal
validity of MTurk experiments, and you should learn about and follow these
best-practices (Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser 2011; Mason and Suri 2012). For
example, researchers using Turkers are encouraged to use screeners to remove
inattentive participants (Berinsky, Margolis, and Sances 2014, 2016) (but see
also D. J. Hauser and Schwarz (2015a, b)). If you don’t remove inattentive
participants, then any effect of the treatment can be washed out by the noise
that they introduce, and in practice the number of inattentive participants can
be substantial. In the experiment by Huber and colleagues (2012), about 30%
of participants failed basic attention screeners. Other problems that commonly
arise when Turkers are used are non-naive participants (Chandler et al. 2015)
and attrition (Zhou and Fishbach 2016).
Third, relative to some other forms of digital experiments, MTurk
experiments cannot scale; Stewart et al. (2015) estimate that at any given time
there are only about 7,000 people on MTurk.
Finally, you should know that MTurk is a community with its own rules and
norms (Mason and Suri 2012). In the same way that you would try to find out
about the culture of a country where you were going to run your experiments,
you should try to find out more about the culture and norms of Turkers (Salehi
et al. 2015). And you should know that the Turkers will be talking about your
experiment if you do something inappropriate or unethical (Gray et al. 2016).
MTurk is an incredibly convenient way to recruit participants to your
experiments, whether they are lab-like, such as that of Huber, Hill, and Lenz
(2012), or more field-like, such as those of Mason and Watts (2009), Goldstein,
McAfee, and Suri (2013), Goldstein et al. (2014), Horton and Zeckhauser (2016),
and Mao et al. (2016).
• Build your own product (section 4.5.3)
If you are thinking of trying to create your own product, I recommend that
you read the advice offered by the MovieLens group in Harper and Konstan
(2015). A key insight from their experience is that for each successful project
there are many, many failures. For example, the MovieLens group launched
other products, such as GopherAnswers, that were complete failures (Harper
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
215

and Konstan 2015). Another example of a researcher failing while attempting
to build a product is Edward Castronova’s attempt to build an online game
called Arden. Despite $250,000 in funding, the project was a flop (Baker 2008).
Projects like GopherAnswers and Arden are unfortunately much more common
than projects like MovieLens.
• Partner with the powerful (section 4.5.4)
I’ve heard the idea of Pasteur’s Quadrant discussed frequently at tech
companies, and it helps organize research efforts at Google (Spector, Norvig,
and Petrov 2012).
Bond and colleagues’ study (2012) also attempts to detect the effect of these
treatments on the friends of those who received them. Because of the design
of the experiment, these spillovers are difficult to detect cleanly; interested
readers should see Bond et al. (2012) for a more thorough discussion. Jones
and colleagues (2017) also conducted a very similar experiment during the
2012 election. These experiments are part of a long tradition of experiments in
political science on efforts to encourage voting (Green and Gerber 2015). These
get-out-the-vote experiments are common, in part because they are in Pasteur’s
Quadrant. That is, there are many people who are motivated to increase voting,
and voting can be an interesting behavior to test more general theories about
behavior change and social influence.
For advice about running field experiments with partner organizations
such as political parties, NGOs, and businesses, see Loewen, Rubenson, and
Wantchekon (2010), List (2011), and Gueron (2002). For thoughts about how
partnerships with organizations can impact research designs, see King et al.
(2007) and Green, Calfano, and Aronow (2014). Partnership can also lead to
ethical questions, as discussed by Humphreys (2015) and Nickerson and Hyde
(2016).
• Design advice (section 4.6)
If you are going create an analysis plan before running your experiment,
I suggest that you start by reading reporting guidelines. The CONSORT
(Consolidated Standard Reporting of Trials) guidelines were developed in
medicine (Schulz et al. 2010) and modified for social research (Mayo-Wilson
et al. 2013). A related set of guidelines has been developed by the editors of
the Journal of Experimental Political Science (Gerber et al. 2014) (see also Mutz
and Pemantle (2015) and Gerber et al. (2015)). Finally, reporting guidelines
have been developed in psychology (APA Working Group 2008), and see also
Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011).
If you create an analysis plan, you should consider pre-registering it because
pre-registration will increase the confidence that others have in your results.
Further, if you are working with a partner, it will limit your partner’s ability
to change the analysis after seeing the results. Pre-registration is becoming
216
CHAPTER 4

increasingly common in psychology (Nosek and Lakens 2014), political science
(Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt 2013; Monogan 2013; Anderson 2013; Gelman
2013; Laitin 2013), and economics (Olken 2015).
Design advice specifically for online field experiments is also presented in
Konstan and Chen (2007) and Chen and Konstan (2015).
What I’ve called the armada strategy is sometimes called programmatic
research; see Wilson, Aronson, and Carlsmith (2010).
• Create zero variable cost data (section 4.6.1)
For more on the MusicLab experiments, see Salganik, Dodds, and Watts
(2006), Salganik and Watts (2008, 2009a, b), and Salganik (2007). For more on
winner-take-all markets, see Frank and Cook (1996). For more on untangling
luck and skill more generally, see Mauboussin (2012), Watts (2012), and Frank
(2016).
There is another approach to eliminating participant payments that
researchers should use with caution: conscription. In many online field
experiments, participants are basically drafted into experiments and never
compensated. Examples of this approach include Restivo and van de Rijt’s
(2012) experiment on rewards in Wikipedia and Bond and colleague’s (2012)
experiment on encouraging people to vote. These experiments don’t really have
zero variable cost—rather, they have zero variable cost to researchers. In such
experiments, even if the cost to each participant is extremely small, the aggregate
cost can be quite large. Researchers running massive online experiments often
justify the importance of small estimated treatment effects by saying that these
small effects can become important when applied to many people. The exact
same thinking applies to costs that researchers impose on participants. If your
experiment causes one million people to waste one minute, the experiment is
not very harmful to any particular person, but in aggregate it has wasted almost
two years of time.
Another approach to creating zero variable cost payment to participants is
to use a lottery, an approach that has also been used in survey research (Halpern
et al. 2011). For more about designing enjoyable user experiences, see Toomim
et al. (2011). For more about using bots to create zero variable cost experiments,
see Krafft, Macy, and Pentland (2016).
• Replace, reﬁne, and reduce (section 4.6.2)
The three R’s as originally proposed by Russell and Burch (1959) are as follows:
“Replacement means the substitution for conscious living higher animals
of insentient material. Reduction means reduction in the numbers of
animals used to obtain information of a given amount and precision.
Refinement means any decrease in the incidence or severity of inhumane
procedures applied to those animals which still have to be used.”
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
217

The three R’s that I propose don’t override the ethical principles described
in chapter 6. Rather, they are a more elaborated version of one of those
principles—beneficence—specifically in the setting of human experiments.
In terms of the first R (“replacement”), comparing the emotional contagion
experiment (Kramer, Guillory, and Hancock 2014) and the emotional contagion
natural experiment (Coviello et al. 2014) offers some general lessons about the
trade-offs involved in moving from experiments to natural experiments (and
other approaches like matching that attempt to approximate experiments in
non-experimental data; see chapter 2). In addition to the ethical benefits, switch-
ing from experimental to non-experimental studies also enables researchers to
study treatments that they are logistically unable to deploy. These ethical and
logistical benefits come at a cost, however. With natural experiments, researchers
have less control over things like recruitment of participants, randomization, and
the nature of the treatment. For example, one limitation of rainfall as a treatment
is that it both increases positivity and decreases negativity. In the experimental
study, however, Kramer and colleagues were able to adjust positivity and
negativity independently. The particular approach used by Coviello et al. (2014)
was further elaborated by Coviello, Fowler, and Franceschetti (2014). For an
introduction to instrumental variables, which is the approach used by Coviello
et al. (2014), see Angrist and Pischke (2009) (less formal) or Angrist, Imbens,
and Rubin (1996) (more formal). For a skeptical appraisal of instrumental
variables, see Deaton (2010), and for an introduction to instrumental variables
with weak instruments (rain is a weak instrument), see Murray (2006). More
generally, a good introduction to natural experiments is given by Dunning
(2012), while Rosenbaum (2002), Rosenbaum (2010), and Shadish, Cook,
and Campbell (2001) offer good ideas about estimating causal effects without
experiments.
In terms of the second R (“refinement”), there are scientific and logistical
trade-offs when considering changing the design of Emotional Contagion
from blocking posts to boosting posts. For example, it may be the case that
the technical implementation of the News Feed makes it is substantially easier
to do an experiment in which posts are blocked rather than one in which
they are boosted (note that an experiment involving blocking of posts could
be implemented as a layer on top of the News Feed system without any
need for alterations of the underlying system). Scientifically, however, the
theory addressed by the experiment did not clearly suggest one design over
the other.
Unfortunately, I am not aware of substantial prior research about the relative
merits of blocking and boosting content in the News Feed. Also, I have not seen
much research about refining treatments to make them less harmful; one excep-
tion is Jones and Feamster (2015), which considers the case of measurement of
Internet censorship (a topic I discuss in chapter 6 in relationship to the Encore
study (Burnett and Feamster 2015; Narayanan and Zevenbergen 2015)).
218
CHAPTER 4

In terms of the third R (“reduction”), good introductions to traditional power
analysis are given by Cohen (1988) (book) and Cohen (1992) (article), while
Gelman and Carlin (2014) offer a slightly different perspective. Pre-treatment
covariates can be included in the design and analysis stages of experiments;
chapter 4 of Gerber and Green (2012) provides a good introduction to both
approaches, and Casella (2008) provides a more in-depth treatment. Techniques
that use this pre-treatment information in the randomization are typically called
either blocked experimental designs or stratified experimental designs (the
terminology is not used consistently across communities); these techniques are
closely related to the stratified sampling techniques discussed in chapter 3. See
Higgins, Sävje, and Sekhon (2016) for more on using these designs in massive
experiments. Pre-treatment covariates can also be included in the analysis
stage. McKenzie (2012) explores the difference-in-differences approach to
analyzing field experiments in greater detail. See Carneiro, Lee, and Wilhelm
(2016) for more on the trade-offs between different approaches to increase
precision in estimates of treatment effects. Finally, when deciding whether
to try to include pre-treatment covariates at the design or analysis stage (or
both), there are a few factors to consider. In a setting where researchers want
to show that they are not “fishing” (Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt 2013),
using pre-treatment covariates in the design stage can be helpful (Higgins,
Sävje, and Sekhon 2016). In situations where participants arrive sequentially,
especially online field experiments, using pre-treatment information in
the design stage may be difficult logistically; see, for example, Xie and
Aurisset (2016).
It is worth adding a bit of intuition about why a difference-in-differences
approach can be so much more effective than a difference-in-means one. Many
online outcomes have very high variance (see e.g., Lewis and Rao (2015) and
Lamb et al. (2015)) and are relatively stable over time. In this case, the change
score will have substantially smaller variance, increasing the power of the
statistical test. One reason this approach is not used more often is that prior
to the digital age, it was not common to have pre-treatment outcomes. A more
concrete way to think about this is to imagine an experiment to measure whether
a specific exercise routine causes weight loss. If you adopt a difference-in-means
approach, your estimate will have variability arising from the variability in
weights in the population. If you do a difference-in-differences approach,
however, that naturally occurring variation in weights is removed, and you can
more easily detect a difference caused by the treatment.
Finally, I considered adding a fourth R: “repurpose”. That is, if researchers
find themselves with more experimental data than they need to address their
original research question, they should repurpose the data to ask new questions.
For example, imagine that Kramer and colleagues had used a difference-in-
differences estimator and found themselves with more data than they needed
to address their research question. Rather than not using the data to the
RUNNING EXPERIMENTS
219

fullest extent, they could have studied the size of the effect as a function of
pre-treatment emotional expression. Just as Schultz et al. (2007) found that the
effect of the treatment was different for light and heavy users, perhaps the effects
of the News Feed were different for people who already tended to post happy
(or sad) messages. Repurposing could lead to “fishing” (Humphreys, Sierra, and
Windt 2013) and “p-hacking” (Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn 2011), but
these are largely addressable with a combination of honest reporting (Simmons,
Nelson, and Simonsohn 2011), pre-registration (Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt
2013), and machine learning methods that attempt to avoid over-fitting.

] The results of an experiment can depend on the participants. Create
an experiment and then run it on MTurk using two different recruitment
strategies. Try to pick the experiment and recruitment strategies so that the
results will be as different as possible. For example, your recruitment strategies
could be to recruit participants in the morning and the evening or to compensate
participants with high and low pay. These kinds of differences in recruitment
strategy could lead to different pools of participants and different experimental
outcomes. How different did your results turn out? What does that reveal about
running experiments on MTurk?

descriptive norms and personal responsibility. In Study 1, the light status
(i.e., on or off) was manipulated before someone entered an unoccu-
pied public bathroom, signaling the descriptive norm for that setting.
Participants were significantly more likely to turn the lights off if they
were off when they entered. In Study 2, an additional condition was
included in which the norm of turning off the light was demonstrated
by a confederate, but participants were not themselves responsible for
turning it on. Personal responsibility moderated the influence of social
norms on behavior; when participants were not responsible for turning
on the light, the influence of the norm was diminished. These results
indicate how descriptive norms and personal responsibility may regulate
the effectiveness of proenvironmental interventions.”

] Jim Manzi’s book Uncontrolled (2012) is a wonderful introduction to the
power of experimentation in business. In the book, he related the following story:
“I was once in a meeting with a true business genius, a self-made billionaire
who had a deep, intuitive understating of the power of experiments. His
company spent significant resources trying to create great store window
displays that would attract consumers and increases sales, as conventional
wisdom said they should. Experts carefully tested design after design, and
in individual test review sessions over a period of years kept showing
no significant causal effect of each new display design on sales. Senior
marketing and merchandising executives met with the CEO to review
these historical test results in toto. After presenting all of the experimental
data, they concluded that the conventional wisdom was wrong—that
window displays don’t drive sales. Their recommended action was to
reduce costs and effort in this area. This dramatically demonstrated the
222
CHAPTER 4

ability of experimentation to overturn conventional wisdom. The CEO’s
response was simple: ‘My conclusion is that your designers aren’t very
good.’ His solution was to increase effort in store display design, and to
get new people to do it.” (Manzi 2012, pp. 158–9)
Which type of validity is the concern of the CEO?
12. [
] Building on the previous question, imagine that you were at the meeting
where the results of the experiments were discussed. What are four questions
that you could ask—one for each type of validity (statistical, construct, internal,
and external)?

] Bernedo, Ferraro, and Price (2014) studied the seven-year effect of the
water-saving intervention described by Ferraro, Miranda, and Price (2011) (see
figure 4.11). In this paper, Bernedo and colleagues also sought to understand
the mechanism behind the effect by comparing the behavior of households
that have and have not moved after the treatment was delivered. That is,
roughly, they tried to see whether the treatment impacted the home or the
homeowner.
a) Read the paper, describe their design, and summarize their findings.
b) Do their findings impact how you should assess the cost-effectiveness of
similar interventions? If so, why? If not, why not?
14. [
] In a follow-up to Schultz et al. (2007), Schultz and colleagues performed a
series of three experiments on the effect of descriptive and injunctive norms on
a different environmental behavior (towel reuse) in two contexts (a hotel and a
timeshare condominium) (Schultz, Khazian, and Zaleski 2008).
a) Summarize the design and findings of these three experiments.
b) How, if at all, do they change your interpretation of Schultz et al. (2007)?
15. [
] In response to Schultz et al. (2007), Canfield, Bruine de Bruin, and Wong-
Parodi (2016) ran a series of lab-like experiments to study the design of electric
bills. Here’s how they describe it in the abstract:
“In a survey-based experiment, each participant saw a hypothetical elec-
tricity bill for a family with relatively high electricity use, covering in-
formation about (a) historical use, (b) comparisons to neighbors, and
(c) historical use with appliance breakdown. Participants saw all in-
formation types in one of three formats including (a) tables, (b) bar
graphs, and (c) icon graphs. We report on three main findings. First,

consumers understood each type of electricity-use information the most
when it was presented in a table, perhaps because tables facilitate sim-
ple point reading. Second, preferences and intentions to save electric-
ity were the strongest for the historical use information, independent
of format. Third, individuals with lower energy literacy understood all
information less.”
Unlike other follow-up studies, the main outcome of interest in Canfield, Bruine
de Bruin, and Wong-Parodi (2016) is reported behavior, not actual behavior.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of this type of study in a broader research
program promoting energy savings?

] Smith and Pell (2003) presented a satirical meta-analysis of studies
demonstrating the effectiveness of parachutes. They concluded:
“As with many interventions intended to prevent ill health, the effective-
ness of parachutes has not been subjected to rigorous evaluation by using
randomised controlled trials. Advocates of evidence based medicine have
criticised the adoption of interventions evaluated by using only obser-
vational data. We think that everyone might benefit if the most radical
protagonists of evidence based medicine organised and participated in
a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the
parachute.”

engineer in charge of A/B testing at a start-up social media company ex-
plaining the value of the difference-in-differences approach for running an

data about customer behavior. On top of this always-on measurement system,
the company began running experiments. For example, they might run an
experiment to evaluate the effect of a coupon for a free hotel night for customers
with a specific gambling pattern. Here’s how Loveman described the importance
of experimentation to Harrah’s everyday business practices:
“It’s like you don’t harass women, you don’t steal, and you’ve got to have
a control group. This is one of the things that you can lose your job for at
Harrah’s—not running a control group.” (Manzi 2012, p. 146)
Write an email to a new employee explaining why Loveman thinks it is so
important to have a control group. You should try to include an example—either
real or made up—to illustrate your point.

] A new experiment aims to estimate the effect of receiving text
message reminders on vaccination uptake. One hundred and fifty clinics, each
with 600 eligible patients, are willing to participate. There is a fixed cost of $100
for each clinic you want to work with, and it costs $1 for each text message that
you want to send. Further, any clinics that you are working with will measure
the outcome (whether someone received a vaccination) for free. Assume that
you have a budget of $1,000.
a) Under what conditions might it be better to focus your resources on a small
number of clinics and under what conditions might it be better to spread
them more widely?
b) What factors would determine the smallest effect size that you will be able
to reliably detect with your budget?
c) Write a memo explaining these trade-offs to a potential funder.

] A major problem with online courses is attrition: many students
who start courses end up dropping out. Imagine that you are working at an
online learning platform, and a designer at the platform has created a visual
progress bar that she thinks will help prevent students from dropping out of
the course. You want to test the effect of the progress bar on students in a
large computational social science course. After addressing any ethical issues
that might arise in the experiment, you and your colleagues get worried that
the course might not have enough students to reliably detect the effects of the
progress bar. In the following calculations, you can assume that half of the
students will receive the progress bar and half not. Further, you can assume that
there is no interference. In other words, you can assume that participants are
only affected by whether they received the treatment or control; they are not
effected by whether other people received the treatment or control (for a more

formal definition, see chapter 8 of Gerber and Green (2012)). Keep track of any
additional assumptions that you make.
a) Suppose the progress bar is expected to increase the proportion of students
who finish the class by 1 percentage point; what is the sample size needed
to reliably detect the effect?
b) Suppose the progress bar is expected to increase the proportion of students
who finish the class by 10 percentage points; what is the sample size needed
to reliably detect the effect?
c) Now imagine that you have run the experiment, and students who have
completed all the course materials have taken a final exam. When you
compare the final exam scores of students who received the progress bar
with the scores of those who didn’t, you find, much to your surprise, that
students who did not receive the progress bar actually scored higher. Does
this mean that the progress bar caused students to learn less? What can you
learn from these outcome data? (Hint: See chapter 7 of Gerber and Green
(2012).)

] Imagine that you are working as a data scientist at a tech
company. Someone from the marketing department asks for your help in eval-
uating an experiment that they are planning in order to measure the return on
investment (ROI) for a new online ad campaign. ROI is defined as the net profit
from the campaign divided by the cost of the campaign. For example, a campaign
that had no effect on sales would have an ROI of −100%; a campaign where
profits generated were equal to costs would have an ROI of 0; and a campaign
where profits generated were double the cost would have an ROI of 200%.
Before launching the experiment, the marketing department provides you
with the following information based on their earlier research (in fact, these val-
ues are typical of the real online ad campaigns reported in Lewis and Rao (2015)):
•
The mean sales per customer follows a log-normal distribution with a mean
of $7 and a standard deviation of $75.
•
The campaign is expected to increase sales by $0.35 per customer, which
corresponds to an increase in profit of $0.175 per customer.
•
The planned size of the experiment is 200,000 people: half in the treatment
group and half in the control group.
•
The cost of the campaign is $0.14 per participant.
•
The expected ROI for the campaign is 25% [(0.175 −0.14)/0.14]. In other
words, the marketing department believes that for each 100 dollars spent on
marketing, the company will earn an additional $25 in profit.
Write a memo evaluating this proposed experiment. Your memo should use
evidence from a simulation that you create, and it should address two major
226
CHAPTER 4

issues: (1) Would you recommend launching this experiment as planned? If so,
why? If not, why not? Be sure to be clear about the criteria that you are using
to make this decision. (2) What sample size would you recommend for this
experiment? Again please be sure to be clear about the criteria that you are using
to make this decision.
A good memo will address this specific case; a better memo will generalize
from this case in one way (e.g., show how the decision changes as a function
of the size of the effect of the campaign); and a great memo will present
a fully generalized result. Your memo should use graphs to help illustrate
your results.
Here are two hints. First, the marketing department might have provided you
with some unnecessary information, and they might have failed to provide you
with some necessary information. Second, if you are using R, be aware that the
rlnorm() function does not work the way that many people expect.
This activity will give you practice with power analysis, creating simulations,
and communicating your results with words and graphs. It should help you
conduct power analysis for any kind of experiment, not just experiments
designed to estimate ROI. This activity assumes that you have some experience
with statistical testing and power analysis. If you are not familiar with power
analysis, I recommend that you read “A Power Primer” by Cohen (1992).
This activity was inspired by a lovely paper by Lewis and Rao (2015),
which vividly illustrates a fundamental statistical limitation of even massive
experiments. Their paper—which originally had the provocative title “On the
Near-Impossibility of Measuring the Returns to Advertising”—shows how
difficult it is to measure the return on investment of online ads, even with digital
experiments involving millions of customers. More generally, Lewis and Rao
(2015) illustrate a fundamental statistical fact that is particularly important for
digital-age experiments: it is hard to estimate small treatment effects amidst
noisy outcome data.

] In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a new web-based
employment-assistance program, a university career services office conducted
a randomized control trial among 10,000 students entering their final year of
school. A free subscription with unique log-in information was sent through an
exclusive email invitation to 5,000 of the randomly selected students, while the
other 5,000 students were in the control group and did not have a subscription.
Twelve months later, a follow-up survey (with no nonresponse) showed that
in both the treatment and control groups, 70% of the students had secured
full-time employment in their chosen field (table 4.6). Thus, it seemed that the
web-based service had no effect.
However, a clever data scientist at the university looked at the data a bit
more closely and found that only 20% of the students in the treatment group
ever logged into the account after receiving the email. Further, and somewhat
surprisingly, among those who did log into the website, only 60% had secured
full-time employment in their chosen field, which was lower than the rate
for people who didn’t log in and lower than the rate for people in the control
condition (table 4.7).
a) Provide an explanation for what might have happened.
b) What are two different ways to calculate the effect of the treatment in this
experiment?
c) Given this result, should the university career service provide this service
to all students? Just to be clear, this is not a question with a simple answer.
d) What should they do next?
Hint: This question goes beyond the material covered in this chapter, but
addresses issues common in experiments. This type of experimental design is
sometimes called an encouragement design because participants are encouraged
to engage in the treatment. This problem is an example of what is called
one-sided noncompliance (see chapter 5 of Gerber and Green (2012)).

in the previous question was even more complicated. It turned out that 10% of

CREATING MASS
COLLABORATION
5.1
Introduction
Wikipedia is amazing. A mass collaboration of volunteers created a fantastic
encyclopedia that is available to everyone. The key to Wikipedia’s success
was not new knowledge; rather, it was a new form of collaboration. The
digital age, fortunately, enables many new forms of collaboration. Thus, we
should now ask: What massive scientific problems—problems that we could
not solve individually—can we now tackle together?
Collaboration in research is nothing new, of course. What is new, however,
is that the digital age enables collaboration with a much larger and more
diverse set of people: the billions of people around the world with Internet
access. I expect that these new mass collaborations will yield amazing results
not just because of the number of people involved but also because of their
diverse skills and perspectives. How can we incorporate everyone with an
Internet connection into our research process? What could you do with 100
research assistants? What about 100,000 skilled collaborators?
There are many forms of mass collaboration, and computer scientists
typically organize them into a large number of categories based on their
technical characteristics (Quinn and Bederson 2011). In this chapter, how-
ever, I’m going to categorize mass collaboration projects based on how they
can be used for social research. In particular, I think it is helpful to roughly
distinguish between three types of projects: human computation, open call,
and distributed data collection (figure 5.1).
I’ll describe each of these types in greater detail later in the chapter, but
for now let me describe each one briefly. Human computation projects are
ideally suited for easy-task–big-scale problems such as labeling a million

Mass collaboration
Figure 5.1: Mass collaboration schematic. This chapter is organized around three main
forms of mass collaboration: human computation, open call, and distributed data collection.
More generally, mass collaboration combines ideas from fields such as citizen science,
crowdsourcing, and collective intelligence.
images. These are projects that in the past might have been performed by
undergraduate research assistants. Contributions don’t require task-related
skills, and the final output is typically an average of all of the contributions.
A classic example of a human computation project is Galaxy Zoo, where a
hundred thousand volunteers helped astronomers classify a million galaxies.
Open call projects, on the other hand, are ideally suited for problems where
you are looking for novel and unexpected answers to clearly formulated
questions. These are projects that in the past might have involved asking
colleagues. Contributions come from people who have special task-related
skills, and the final output is usually the best of all of the contributions.
A classic example of an open call is the Netflix Prize, where thousands
of scientists and hackers worked to develop new algorithms to predict
customers’ ratings of movies. Finally, distributed data collection projects are
ideally suited for large-scale data collection. These are projects that in the
past might have been performed by undergraduate research assistants or
survey research companies. Contributions typically come from people who
have access to locations that researchers do not, and the final product is a
simple collection of the contributions. A classic example of a distributed data
collection is eBird, in which hundreds of thousands of volunteers contribute
reports about birds they see.
Mass collaboration has a long, rich history in fields such as astronomy
(Marshall, Lintott, and Fletcher 2015) and ecology (Dickinson, Zuckerberg,
and Bonter 2010), but it is not yet common in social research. However,
232
CHAPTER 5

by describing successful projects from other fields and providing a few key
organizing principles, I hope to convince you of two things. First, mass
collaboration can be harnessed for social research. And second, researchers
who use mass collaboration will be able to solve problems that had previously
seemed impossible. Although mass collaboration is often promoted as a way
to save money, it is much more than that. As I will show, mass collaboration
doesn’t just allow us to do research cheaper, it allows us to do research better.
In the previous chapters, you have seen what can be learned by engaging
with people in three different ways: observing their behavior (chapter 2),
asking them questions (chapter 3), and enrolling them in experiments
(chapter 4). In this chapter, I’ll show you what can be learned by engaging
people as research collaborators. For each of the three main forms of mass
collaboration, I will describe a prototypical example, illustrate important
additional points with further examples, and finally describe how this form
of mass collaboration might be used for social research. The chapter will
conclude with five principles that can help you design your own mass
collaboration project.
5.2
Human computation
Human computation projects take a big problem, break it into simple
pieces, send them to many workers, and then aggregate the results.
Human computation projects combine the efforts of many people working
on simple microtasks in order to solve problems that are impossibly big
for one person. You might have a research problem suitable for human
computation if you’ve ever thought: “I could solve this problem if I had a
thousand research assistants.”
The prototypical example of a human computation project is Galaxy Zoo.
In this project, more than one hundred thousand volunteers classified images
of about a million galaxies with similar accuracy to earlier—and substantially
smaller—efforts by professional astronomers. This increased scale provided
by mass collaboration led to new discoveries about how galaxies form, and it
turned up an entirely new class of galaxies called “Green Peas.”
Although Galaxy Zoo might seem far from social research, there are
actually many situations where social researchers want to code, classify, or
label images or texts. In some cases, this analysis can be done by computers,
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
233

but there are still certain forms of analysis that are hard for computers but
easy for people. It is these easy-for-people yet hard-for-computers microtasks
that we can turn over to human computation projects.
Not only is the microtask in Galaxy Zoo quite general, but the structure
of the project is general as well. Galaxy Zoo, and other human computation
projects, typically use a split–apply–combine strategy (Wickham 2011), and
once you understand this strategy you’ll be able to use it to solve lots of
problems. First, a big problem is split into lots of little problem chunks. Then,
human work is applied to each little problem chunk, independently of the
other chunks. Finally, the results of this work are combined to produce a
consensus solution. Given that background, let’s see how the split–apply–
combine strategy was used in Galaxy Zoo.
5.2.1 Galaxy Zoo
Galaxy Zoo combined the efforts of many non-expert volunteers to
classify a million galaxies.
Galaxy Zoo grew out of a problem faced by Kevin Schawinski, a graduate
student in Astronomy at the University of Oxford in 2007. Simplifying quite
a bit, Schawinski was interested in galaxies, and galaxies can be classified
by their morphology—elliptical or spiral—and by their color—blue or red.
At the time, the conventional wisdom among astronomers was that spiral
galaxies, like our Milky Way, were blue in color (indicating youth) and
elliptical galaxies were red (indicating old age). Schawinski doubted this
conventional wisdom. He suspected that while this pattern might be true
in general, there were probably a sizable number of exceptions, and that by
studying lots of these unusual galaxies—the ones that did not fit the expected
pattern—he could learn something about the process through which galaxies
formed.
Thus, what Schawinski needed in order to overturn conventional wisdom
was a large set of morphologically classified galaxies; that is, galaxies that had
been classified as either spiral or elliptical. The problem, however, was that
existing algorithmic methods for classification were not yet good enough to
be used for scientific research; in other words, classifying galaxies was, at that
time, a problem that was hard for computers. Therefore, what was needed
was a large number of human-classified galaxies. Schawinski undertook

Zoo project used more than 100,000 volunteers to categorize more than 900,000 images.

this classification problem with the enthusiasm of a graduate student. In
a marathon session of seven 12-hour days, he was able to classify 50,000
galaxies. While 50,000 galaxies may sound like a lot, it is actually only about
5% of the almost one million galaxies that had been photographed in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Schawinski realized that he needed a more scalable
approach.
Fortunately, it turns out that the task of classifying galaxies does not
require advanced training in astronomy; you can teach someone to do it
pretty quickly. In other words, even though classifying galaxies is a task that
was hard for computers, it was pretty easy for humans. So, while sitting in a
pub in Oxford, Schawinski and fellow astronomer Chris Lintott dreamed up
a website where volunteers would classify images of galaxies. A few months
later, Galaxy Zoo was born.
At the Galaxy Zoo website, volunteers would undergo a few minutes of
training; for example, learning the difference between a spiral and elliptical
galaxy (figure 5.2). After this training, each volunteer had to pass a relatively
easy quiz—correctly classifying 11 of 15 galaxies with known classifications—
and then would begin real classification of unknown galaxies through a
simple web-based interface (figure 5.3). The transition from volunteer to
astronomer would take place in less than 10 minutes and only required
passing the lowest of hurdles, a simple quiz.
Galaxy Zoo attracted its initial volunteers after the project was featured in
a news article, and in about six months the project grew to involve more than
100,000 citizen scientists, people who participated because they enjoyed the
task and they wanted to help advance astronomy. Together, these 100,000
volunteers contributed a total of more than 40 million classifications, with
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION

Collection.
the majority of the classifications coming from a relatively small core group
of participants (Lintott et al. 2008).
Researchers who have experience hiring undergraduate research assistants
might immediately be skeptical about data quality. While this skepticism
is reasonable, Galaxy Zoo shows that when volunteer contributions are
correctly cleaned, debiased, and aggregated, they can produce high-quality
results (Lintott et al. 2008). An important trick for getting the crowd to
create professional-quality data is redundancy, that is, having the same task
performed by many different people. In Galaxy Zoo, there were about 40
classifications per galaxy; researchers using undergraduate research assis-
tants could never afford this level of redundancy and therefore would need
to be much more concerned with the quality of each individual classi-
fication. What the volunteers lacked in training, they made up for with
redundancy.
Even with multiple classifications per galaxy, however, combining the
set of volunteer classifications to produce a consensus classification was
tricky. Because very similar challenges arise in most human computation
projects, it is helpful to briefly review the three steps that the Galaxy
Zoo researchers used to produce their consensus classifications. First, the
researchers “cleaned” the data by removing bogus classifications. For ex-
ample, people who repeatedly classified the same galaxy—something that
would happen if they were trying to manipulate the results—had all their
236
CHAPTER 5

classifications discarded. This and other similar cleaning removed about
4% of all classifications.
Second, after cleaning, the researchers needed to remove systematic biases
in classifications. Through a series of bias detection studies embedded within
the original project—for example, showing some volunteers the galaxy in
monochrome instead of color—the researchers discovered several systematic
biases, such as a systematic bias to classify faraway spiral galaxies as elliptical
galaxies (Bamford et al. 2009). Adjusting for these systematic biases is
extremely important because redundancy does not automatically remove
systematic bias; it only help removes random error.
Finally, after debiasing, the researchers needed a method to combine the
individual classifications to produce a consensus classification. The simplest
way to combine classifications for each galaxy would have been to choose the
most common classification. However, this approach would have given each
volunteer equal weight, and the researchers suspected that some volunteers
were better at classification than others. Therefore, the researchers developed
a more complex iterative weighting procedure that attempted to detect the
best classifiers and give them more weight.
Thus, after a three-step process—cleaning, debiasing, and weighting—the
Galaxy Zoo research team had converted 40 million volunteer classifications
into a set of consensus morphological classifications. When these Galaxy
Zoo classifications were compared with three previous smaller-scale attempts
by professional astronomers, including the classification by Schawinski that
helped to inspire Galaxy Zoo, there was strong agreement. Thus, the volun-
teers, in aggregate, were able to provide high-quality classifications and at
a scale that the researchers could not match (Lintott et al. 2008). In fact, by
having human classifications for such a large number of galaxies, Schawinski,
Lintott, and others were able to show that only about 80% of galaxies follow
the expected pattern—blue spirals and red ellipticals—and numerous papers
have been written about this discovery (Fortson et al. 2011).
Given this background, you can now see how Galaxy Zoo follows the
split–apply–combine recipe, the same recipe that is used for most human
computation projects. First, a big problem was split into chunks. In this
case, the problem of classifying a million galaxies is split into a million
problems of classifying one galaxy. Next, an operation is applied to each
chunk independently. In this case, volunteers classified each galaxy as either
spiral or elliptical. Finally, the results are combined to produce a consensus
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
237

result. In this case, the combine step included the cleaning, debiasing, and
weighting to produce a consensus classification for each galaxy. Even though
most projects use this general recipe, each step needs to be customized to the
specific problem being addressed. For example, in the human computation
project described below, the same recipe will be followed, but the apply and
combine steps will be quite different.
For the Galaxy Zoo team, this first project was just the beginning. Very
quickly, they realized that even though they were able to classify close to
a million galaxies, this scale is not enough to work with newer digital sky
surveys, which can produce images of about 10 billion galaxies (Kuminski
et al. 2014). To handle an increase from 1 million to 10 billion—a factor
of 10,000—Galaxy Zoo would need to recruit roughly 10,000 times more
participants. Even though the number of volunteers on the Internet is large,
it is not infinite. Therefore, the researchers realized that if they were going to
handle ever-growing amounts of data, a new, even more scalable, approach
was needed.
Therefore, Manda Banerji—working with Schawinski, Lintott, and other
members of the Galaxy Zoo team (2010)—started teaching computers to
classify galaxies. More specifically, using the human classifications created
by Galaxy Zoo, Banerji built a machine learning model that could predict the
human classification of a galaxy based on the characteristics of the image. If
this model could reproduce the human classifications with high accuracy,
then it could be used by Galaxy Zoo researchers to classify an essentially
infinite number of galaxies.
The core of Banerji and colleagues’ approach is actually pretty similar to
techniques commonly used in social research, although that similarity might
not be clear at first glance. First, Banerji and colleagues converted each image
into a set of numerical features that summarized its properties. For example,
for images of galaxies, there could be three features: the amount of blue in
the image, the variance in the brightness of the pixels, and the proportion of
nonwhite pixels. The selection of the correct features is an important part
of the problem, and it generally requires subject-area expertise. This first
step, commonly called feature engineering, results in a data matrix with one
row per image and three columns describing that image. Given the data
matrix and the desired output (e.g., whether the image was classified by a
human as an elliptical galaxy), the researcher creates a statistical or machine
learning model—for example, logistic regression—that predicts the human
238
CHAPTER 5

classification based on the features of the image. Finally, the researcher uses
the parameters in this statistical model to produce estimated classifications of
new galaxies (figure 5.4). In machine learning, this approach—using labeled
examples to create a model that can then label new data—is called supervised
learning.
The features in Banerji and colleagues’ machine learning model were more
complex than those in my toy example—for example, she used features like
“de Vaucouleurs fit axial ratio”—and her model was not logistic regression,
it was an artificial neural network. Using her features, her model, and the
consensus Galaxy Zoo classifications, she was able to create weights on
each feature and then use these weights to make predictions about the
classification of galaxies. For example, her analysis found that images with
low de Vaucouleurs fit axial ratio were more likely to be spiral galaxies. Given
these weights, she was able to predict the human classification of a galaxy
with reasonable accuracy.
The work of Banerji and colleagues turned Galaxy Zoo into what I
would call a computer-assisted human computation system. The best way
to think about these hybrid systems is that rather than having humans
solve a problem, they have humans build a dataset that can be used to
train a computer to solve the problem. Sometimes, training a computer
to solve the problem can require lots of examples, and the only way to
produce a sufficient number of examples is a mass collaboration. The
advantage of this computer-assisted approach is that it enables you to handle
essentially infinite amounts of data using only a finite amount of human
effort. For example, a researcher with a million human classified galaxies
can build a predictive model that can then be used to classify a billion or
even a trillion galaxies. If there are enormous numbers of galaxies, then
this kind of human–computer hybrid is really the only possible solution.
This infinite scalability is not free, however. Building a machine learning
model that can correctly reproduce the human classifications is itself a
hard problem, but fortunately there are already excellent books dedicated
to this topic (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009; Murphy 2012; James
et al. 2013).
Galaxy Zoo is a good illustration of how many human computation
projects evolve. First, a researcher attempts the project by herself or with
a small team of research assistants (e.g., Schawinski’s initial classification
effort). If this approach does not scale well, the researcher can move to

Figure 5.4: Simplified description of how Banerji et al. (2010) used the Galaxy Zoo classifica-
tions to train a machine learning model to do galaxy classification. Images of galaxies were
converted in a matrix of features. In this simplified example, there are three features (the
amount of blue in the image, the variance in the brightness of the pixels, and the proportion
of nonwhite pixels). Then, for a subset of the images, the Galaxy Zoo labels are used to
train a machine learning model. Finally, the machine learning model is used to estimate
classifications for the remaining galaxies. I call this a computer-assisted human computation
project because, rather than having humans solve a problem, it has humans build a dataset that
can be used to train a computer to solve the problem. The advantage of this computer-assisted
human computation system is that it enables you to handle essentially infinite amounts of data
using only a finite amount of human effort. Images of galaxies reproduced by permission from

a human computation project with many participants. But, for a certain
volume of data, pure human effort will not be enough. At that point,
researchers need to build a computer-assisted human computation system
in which human classifications are used to train a machine learning model
that can then be applied to virtually unlimited amounts of data.
5.2.2 Crowd-coding of political manifestos
Coding political manifestos, something typically done by experts, can
be performed by a human computation project resulting in greater
reproducibility and ﬂexibility.
Similar to Galaxy Zoo, there are many situations where social researchers
want to code, classify, or label an image or piece of text. An example of
this kind of research is the coding of political manifestos. During elections,
political parties produce manifestos describing their policy positions and
guiding philosophies. For example, here’s a piece of the manifesto of the
Labour Party in the United Kingdom from 2010:
“Millions of people working in our public services embody the best
values of Britain, helping empower people to make the most of their
own lives while protecting them from the risks they should not have
to bear on their own. Just as we need to be bolder about the role of
government in making markets work fairly, we also need to be bold
reformers of government.”
These manifestos contain valuable data for political scientists, particularly
those studying elections and the dynamics of policy debates. In order to
systematically extract information from these manifestos, researchers created
the Manifesto Project, which collected 4,000 manifestos from nearly 1,000
parties in 50 countries and then organized political scientists to systematically
code them. Each sentence in each manifesto was coded by an expert using
a 56-category scheme. The result of this collaborative effort was a massive
dataset summarizing the information embedded in these manifestos, and this
dataset has been used in more than 200 scientific papers.
Kenneth Benoit and colleagues (2016) decided to take the manifesto
coding task that had previously been performed by experts and turn it into a

human computation project. As a result, they created a coding process that
is more reproducible and more flexible, not to mention cheaper and faster.
Working with 18 manifestos generated during six recent elections in
the United Kingdom, Benoit and colleagues used the split–apply–combine
strategy with workers from a microtask labor market (Amazon Mechanical
Turk and CrowdFlower are examples of microtask labor markets; for more
on such markets, see chapter 4). The researchers took each manifesto
and split it into sentences. Next, a person applied the coding scheme to
each sentence. In particular, readers were asked to classify each sentence
as referring to economic policy (left or right), to social policy (liberal or
conservative), or to neither (figure 5.5). Each sentence was coded by about
five different people. Finally, these ratings were combined using a statistical
model that accounted for both individual-rater effects and difficulty-of-
sentence effects. In all, Benoit and colleagues collected 200,000 ratings from
about 1,500 people.
In order to assess the quality of the crowd coding, Benoit and colleagues
also had about 10 experts—professors and graduate students in political

Figure 5.6: Expert estimates (x-axis) and crowd estimates (y-axis) were in remarkable
agreement when coding 18 party manifestos from the United Kingdom (Benoit et al. 2016).
The manifestos coded were from three political parties (Conservative, Labour, and Liberal
Democrats) and six general elections (1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2010). Adapted from

science—rate the same manifestos using a similar procedure. Although the
ratings from members of the crowd were more variable than the ratings from
the experts, the consensus crowd rating had remarkable agreement with the
consensus expert rating (figure 5.6). This comparison shows that, as with
Galaxy Zoo, human computation projects can produce high-quality results.
Building on this result, Benoit and colleagues used their crowd-coding
system to do research that was impossible with the expert-run coding system
used by the Manifesto Project. For example, the Manifesto Project did not
code the manifestos on the topic of immigration, because that was not a
salient topic when the coding scheme was developed in the mid-1980s. And,
at this point, it is logistically infeasible for the Manifesto Project to go back
and recode their manifestos to capture this information. Therefore, it would
appear that researchers interested in studying the politics of immigration
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
243

are out of luck. However, Benoit and colleagues were able to use their
human computation system to do this coding—customized to their research
question—quickly and easily.
In order to study immigration policy, they coded the manifestos for eight
parties in the 2010 general election in the United Kingdom. Each sentence
in each manifesto was coded as to whether it related to immigration, and if
so, whether it was pro-immigration, neutral, or anti-immigration. Within 5
hours of launching their project, the results were in. They had collected more
than 22,000 responses at a total cost of $360. Further, the estimates from the
crowd showed remarkable agreement with an earlier survey of experts. Then,
as a final test, two months later, the researchers reproduced their crowd-
coding. Within a few hours, they had created a new crowd-coded dataset that
closely matched their original crowd-coded data set. In other words, human
computation enabled them to generate coding of political texts that agreed
with expert evaluations and was reproducible. Further, because the human
computation was quick and cheap, it was easy for them to customize their
data collection to their specific research question about immigration.
5.2.3 Conclusion
Human computation enables you to have a thousand research
assistants.
Human computation projects combine the work of many non-experts to
solve easy-task–big-scale problems that are not easily solved by computers.
They use the split–apply–combine strategy to break a big problem into lots
of simple microtasks that can be solved by people without specialized skills.
Computer-assisted human computation systems also use machine learning
in order to amplify the human effort.
In social research, human computation projects are most likely to be
used in situations where researchers want to classify, code, or label images,
video, or texts. These classifications are usually not the final product of the
research; instead, they are the raw material for analysis. For example, the
crowd-coding of political manifestos could be used as part of analysis about
the dynamics of political debate. These kinds of classification microtasks are
likely to work best when they do not require specialized training and when
there is broad agreement about the correct answer. If the classification task

is more subjective—such as “Is this news story biased?”—then it becomes
increasingly important to understand who is participating and what biases
they might bring. In the end, the quality of the output of human computation
projects rests on the quality of the inputs that the human participants
provide: garbage in, garbage out.
In order to further build your intuition, table 5.1 provides additional
examples of how human computation has been used in social research.
This table shows that, unlike Galaxy Zoo, many other human computation
projects use microtask labor markets (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) and
rely on paid workers rather than volunteers. I’ll return to this issue of
participant motivation when I provide advice about creating your own mass
collaboration project.
Finally, the examples in this section show that human computation can
have a democratizing impact on science. Recall that Schawinski and Lintott
were graduate students when they started Galaxy Zoo. Prior to the digital
age, a project to classify a million galaxy classification would have required
so much time and money that it would have only been practical for well-
funded and patient professors. That’s no longer true. Human computation
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
245

projects combine the work of many non-experts to solve easy-task–big-scale
problems. Next, I’ll show you that mass collaboration can also be applied
to problems that require expertise, expertise that even the researcher herself
might not have.
5.3
Open calls
Open calls solicit new ideas for a clearly speciﬁed goal. They work on
problems where a solution is easier to check than to create.
In the human computation problems described in the previous section, the
researchers knew how to solve the problems given sufficient time. That is,
Kevin Schawinski could have classified all million galaxies himself, if he had
unlimited time. Sometimes, however, researchers encounter problems where
the challenge comes not from the scale but from the inherent difficulty of the
task itself. In the past, a researcher facing one of these intellectually challeng-
ing tasks might have asked colleagues for advice. Now, these problems can
also be tackled by creating an open call project. You might have a research
problem suitable for an open call if you’ve ever thought: “I don’t know how
to solve this problem, but I’m sure that someone else does.”
In open call projects, the researcher poses a problem, solicits solutions
from lots of people, and then picks the best. It may seem strange to take
a problem that is challenging to you and turn it over to the crowd, but I
hope to convince you with three examples—one from computer science, one
from biology, and one from law—that this approach can work well. These
three examples show that a key to creating a successful open call project is
to formulate your question so that solutions are easy to check, even if they
are difficult to create. Then, at the end of the section, I’ll describe more about
how these ideas can be applied to social research.
5.3.1 Netﬂix Prize
The Netﬂix Prize uses an open call to predict which movies people
will like.
The most well known open call project is the Netflix Prize. Netflix is an online
movie rental company, and in 2000 it launched Cinematch, a service to
246
CHAPTER 5

recommend movies to customers. For example, Cinematch might notice that
you liked Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back and then recommend that
you watch Return of the Jedi. Initially, Cinematch worked poorly. But, over
the course of many years, it continued to improve its ability to predict what
movies customers would enjoy. By 2006, however, progress on Cinematch
had plateaued. The researchers at Netflix had tried pretty much everything
they could think of, but, at the same time, they suspected that there were
other ideas that might help them improve their system. Thus, they came up
with what was, at the time, a radical solution: an open call.
Critical to the eventual success of the Netflix Prize was how the open call
was designed, and this design has important lessons for how open calls can be
used for social research. Netflix did not just put out an unstructured request
for ideas, which is what many people imagine when they first consider an
open call. Rather, Netflix posed a clear problem with a simple evaluation
procedure: they challenged people to use a set of 100 million movie ratings
to predict 3 million held-out ratings (ratings that users had made but
that Netflix did not release). The first person to create an algorithm that
predicted the 3 million held-out ratings 10% better than Cinematch would
win a million dollars. This clear and easy to apply evaluation procedure—
comparing predicted ratings with held-out ratings—meant that the Netflix
Prize was framed in such a way that solutions were easier to check than
generate; it turned the challenge of improving Cinematch into a problem
suitable for an open call.
In October of 2006, Netflix released a dataset containing 100 million
movie ratings from about about 500,000 customers (we will consider the
privacy implications of this data release in chapter 6). The Netflix data can
be conceptualized as a huge matrix that is approximately 500,000 customers
by 20,000 movies. Within this matrix, there were about 100 million ratings
on a scale from one to five stars (table 5.2). The challenge was to use the
observed data in the matrix to predict the 3 million held-out ratings.
Researchers and hackers around the world were drawn to the challenge,
and by 2008 more than 30,000 people were working on it (Thompson 2008).
Over the course of the contest, Netflix received more than 40,000 proposed
solutions from more than 5,000 teams (Netflix 2009). Obviously, Netflix
could not read and understand all these proposed solutions. The whole thing
ran smoothly, however, because the solutions were easy to check. Netflix
could just have a computer compare the predicted ratings with the held-out

ratings using a prespecified metric (the particular metric they used was the
square root of the mean squared error). It was this ability to quickly evaluate
solutions that enabled Netflix to accept solutions from everyone, which
turned out to be important because good ideas came from some surprising
places. In fact, the winning solution was submitted by a team started by three
researchers who had no prior experience building movie recommendation
systems (Bell, Koren, and Volinsky 2010).
One beautiful aspect of the Netflix Prize is that it enabled all the proposed
solutions to be evaluated fairly. That is, when people uploaded their predicted
ratings, they did not need to upload their academic credentials, their age,
race, gender, sexual orientation, or anything about themselves. The predicted
ratings of a famous professor from Stanford were treated exactly the same
as those from a teenager in her bedroom. Unfortunately, this is not true
in most social research. That is, for most social research, evaluation is very
time-consuming and partially subjective. So, most research ideas are never
seriously evaluated, and when ideas are evaluated, it is hard to detach those
evaluations from the creator of the ideas. Open call projects, on the other
hand, have easy and fair evaluation, so they can discover ideas that would be
missed otherwise.
For example, at one point during the Netflix Prize, someone with the
screen name Simon Funk posted on his blog a proposed solution based
on a singular value decomposition, an approach from linear algebra that
had not been used previously by other participants. Funk’s blog post was
simultaneously technical and weirdly informal. Was this blog post describing
a good solution or was it a waste of time? Outside of an open call project, the
solution might never have received serious evaluation. After all, Simon Funk
was not a professor at MIT; he was a software developer who, at the time,
248
CHAPTER 5

was backpacking around New Zealand (Piatetsky 2007). If he had emailed
this idea to an engineer at Netflix, it almost certainly would not have been
read.
Fortunately, because the evaluation criteria were clear and easy to apply,
Funk’s predicted ratings were evaluated, and it was instantly clear that his
approach was very powerful: he rocketed to fourth place in the competition,
a tremendous result given that other teams had already been working for
months on the problem. In the end, parts of his approach were used by
virtually all serious competitors (Bell, Koren, and Volinsky 2010).
The fact that Simon Funk chose to write a blog post explaining
his approach, rather than trying to keep it secret, also illustrates that
many participants in the Netflix Prize were not exclusively motivated by
the million-dollar prize. Rather, many participants also seemed to enjoy
the intellectual challenge and the community that developed around the
problem (Thompson 2008), feelings that I expect many researchers can
understand.
The Netflix Prize is a classic example of an open call. Netflix posed
a question with a specific goal (predicting movie ratings) and solicited
solutions from many people. Netflix was able to evaluate all these solutions
because they were easier to check than to create, and ultimately Netflix picked
the best solution. Next, I’ll show you how this same approach can be used in
biology and law, and without a million-dollar prize.
5.3.2 Foldit
Foldit is a protein-folding game that enables non-experts to
participate in a way that is fun.
The Netflix Prize, while evocative and clear, does not illustrate the full range
of open call projects. For example, in the Netflix Prize, most of the serious
participants had years of training in statistics and machine learning. But open
call projects can also involve participants who have no formal training, as was
illustrated by Foldit, a protein-folding game.
Protein folding is the process through which a chain of amino acids
takes on its shape. With a better understanding of this process, bi-
ologists could design proteins with specific shapes that could be used
as medicines. Simplifying quite a bit, proteins tend to move to their
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
249

lowest-energy configuration, a configuration that balances the various
pushes and pulls within the protein (figure 5.7). So, if a researcher wants to
predict the shape into which a protein will fold, the solution sounds simple:
just try all possible configurations, calculate their energies, and predict that
the protein will fold into the lowest-energy configuration. Unfortunately,
trying all possible configurations is computationally impossible because there
are billions and billions of potential configurations. Even with the most
powerful computers available today—and in the foreseeable future—brute
force is just not going to work. Therefore, biologists have developed many
clever algorithms to efficiently search for the lowest-energy configuration.
But, despite massive amounts of scientific and computational effort, these
algorithms are still far from perfect.
David Baker and his research group at the University of Washington
were part of the community of scientists working to create computational
approaches to protein folding. In one project, Baker and colleagues de-
veloped a system that allowed volunteers to donate unused time on their
computers to help simulate protein folding. In return, the volunteers could
watch a screensaver showing the protein folding that was happening on their
computer. Several of these volunteers wrote to Baker and colleagues saying
that they thought that they could improve on the computer’s performance
if they could get involved in the calculation. And thus began Foldit (Hand
2010).
Foldit turns the process of protein folding into a game that can be played
by anyone. From the perspective of the player, Foldit appears to be a puzzle
(figure 5.8). Players are presented with a three-dimensional tangle of protein
structure and can perform operations—“tweak,” “wiggle,” “rebuild”—that

change its shape. By performing these operations, players change the shape
of the protein, which in turn increases or decreases their score. Critically,
the score is calculated based on the energy level of the current configuration;
lower-energy configurations result in higher scores. In other words, the score
helps guide the players as they search for low-energy configurations. This
game is only possible because—just like predicting movie ratings in the
Netflix Prize—protein folding is also a situation where it is easier to check
solutions than generate them.
Foldit’s elegant design enables players with little formal knowledge of
biochemistry to compete with the best algorithms designed by experts.
While most players are not particularly good at the task, there are a few
individual players and small teams of players who are exceptional. In fact,
in a head-to-head competition between Foldit players and state-of-the-art
algorithms, the players created better solutions for 5 out of 10 proteins
(Cooper et al. 2010).
Foldit and the Netflix prize are different in many ways, but they both
involve open calls for solutions that are easier to check than generate. Now,
we will see the same structure in yet another very different setting: patent law.
This final example of an open call problem shows that this approach can also
be used in settings that are not obviously amenable to quantification.
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
251

5.3.3 Peer-to-Patent
Peer-to-Patent is an open call that helps patent examiners ﬁnd prior
art; it shows that open calls can be used for problems that are not
amenable to quantiﬁcation.
Patent examiners have a hard job. They receive terse, lawyerly descriptions of
new inventions, and then must decide if the stated invention is “novel.” That
is, the examiner must decide if there is “prior art”—a previously described
version of this invention—that would render the proposed patent invalid. To
understand how this process works, let’s consider a patent examiner named
Albert, in honor of Albert Einstein, who got his start in the Swiss Patent
Office. Albert could receive an application like US Patent 20070118658 filed
by Hewlett Packard for a “User-selectable management alert format” and
described extensively in Beth Noveck’s book Wiki Government (2009). Here’s
the first claim from the application:
“A computer system, comprising: a processor; a basic input/output
system (BIOS) including logic instructions which, when executed by the
processor, configure the processor to: initiate power on self test (POST)
processing in the basic input/output system of a computing device;
present one or more management alert formats in a user interface;
receive a selection signal from the user interface identifying one of
the management alert formats presented in the user interface; and
configure a device coupled to the computing system with the identified
management alert format.”
Should Albert award 20-year monopoly rights to this patent or has there been
prior art? The stakes in many patent decisions are high, but unfortunately,
Albert will have to make this decision without much of the information that
he might need. Because of the huge backlog of patents, Albert is working
under intense time pressure and must make his decision based on only 20
hours of work. Further, because of the need to keep the proposed invention
secret, Albert is not allowed to consult with outside experts (Noveck 2006).
This situation struck law professor Beth Noveck as completely broken.
In July 2005, inspired in part by Wikipedia, she created a blog post titled
“Peer-to-Patent: A Modest Proposal” that called for an open peer-review

system for patents. After collaboration with the US Patent and Trademark
Office and leading technology companies such as IBM, Peer-to-Patent was
launched in June 2007. A nearly 200-year-old governmental bureaucracy and
a group of lawyers seems like an unlikely place to look for innovation, but
Peer-to-Patent does a lovely job of balancing everyone’s interest.
Here’s how it works (figure 5.9). After an inventor agrees to have her
application go through community review (more on why she might do that
in a moment), the application is posted to a website. Next, the application
is discussed by community reviewers (again, more on why they might
participate in a moment), and examples of possible prior art are located,
annotated, and uploaded to a website. This process of discussion, research,
and uploading continues, until, ultimately, the community of reviewers votes
to select the top 10 pieces of suspected prior art that are then sent to the
patent examiner for review. The patent examiner then conducts her own
research and in combination with the input from Peer-to-Patent renders
a judgment.
Let’s return to US Patent 20070118658 for a “User-selectable management
alert format.” This patent was uploaded to Peer-to-Patent in June 2007,
where it was read by Steve Pearson, a senior software engineer for IBM.
Pearson was familiar with this area of research and identified a piece of prior
art: a manual from Intel entitled “Active Management Technology: Quick
Reference Guide” that had been published two years earlier. Armed with this
document, as well as other prior art and the discussion from the Peer-to-
Patent community, a patent examiner began a thorough review of the case,
and ultimately threw out the patent application, in part because of the Intel
manual that was located by Pearson (Noveck 2009). Of the 66 cases that have
completed Peer-to-Patent, nearly 30% have been rejected primarily based on
prior art found through Peer-to-Patent (Bestor and Hamp 2010).
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
253

What makes the design of Peer-to-Patent especially elegant is the way that
it gets people with many conflicting interests to all dance together. Inventors
have an incentive to participate because the patent office reviews the Peer-to-
Patent applications more quickly than patents going through the traditional,
secret review process. Reviewers have an incentive to participate in order to
prevent bad patents, and many seem to find the process enjoyable. Finally,
the patent office and patent examiners have an incentive to participate be-
cause this approach can only improve their results. That is, if the community
review process finds 10 unhelpful pieces of prior art, these unhelpful pieces
can be ignored by the patent examiner. In other words, Peer-to-Patent and
a patent examiner working together should be as good as or better than a
patent examiner working in isolation. Thus, open calls do not always replace
experts; sometimes they help experts do their work better.
Although Peer-to-Patent may seem different than the Netflix Prize and
Foldit, it has a similar structure in that solutions are easier to check than
generate. Once someone has produced the manual “Active Management
Technology: Quick Reference Guide,” it is relatively easy—for a patent
examiner, at least—to verify that this document is prior art. However,
finding that manual is quite difficult. Peer-to-Patent also shows that open
call projects are possible even for problems that are not obviously amenable
to quantification.
5.3.4 Conclusion
Open calls enable you to ﬁnd solutions to problems that you can state
clearly but that you cannot solve yourself.
In all three open call projects described here—Netflix Prize, Foldit, Peer-to-
Patent—researchers posed questions of a specific form, solicited solutions,
and then picked the best solutions. The researchers didn’t even need to know
the best expert to ask, and sometimes the good ideas came from unexpected
places.
Now I can also highlight two important differences between open call
projects and human computation projects. First, in open call projects, the
researcher specifies a goal (e.g., predicting movie ratings), whereas in human
computation, the researcher specifies a microtask (e.g., classifying a galaxy).
Second, in open calls, the researchers want the best contribution—such as the
254
CHAPTER 5

best algorithm for predicting movie ratings, the lowest-energy configuration
of a protein, or the most relevant piece of prior art—not some sort of simple
combination of all of the contributions.
Given the general template for open calls and these three examples, what
kinds of problems in social research might be suitable for this approach? At
this point, I should acknowledge that there have not been many successful
examples yet (for reasons that I’ll explain in a moment). In terms of direct
analogs, one could imagine a Peer-to-Patent style open call being used by a
historical researcher searching for the earliest document to mention a specific
person or idea. An open call approach to this kind of problem could be
especially valuable when the potentially relevant documents are not in a
single archive but are widely distributed.
More generally, many governments and companies have problems that
might be amenable to open calls because open calls can generate algorithms
that can be used for predictions, and these predictions can be an important
guide for action (Provost and Fawcett 2013; Kleinberg et al. 2015). For
example, just as Netflix wanted to predict ratings on movies, governments
might want to predict outcomes such as which restaurants are most likely
to have health-code violations in order to allocate inspection resources more
efficiently. Motivated by this kind of problem, Edward Glaeser and colleagues
(2016) used an open call to help the City of Boston predict restaurant hygiene
and sanitation violations based on data from Yelp reviews and historical
inspection data. They estimated that the predictive model that won the open
call would improve the productivity of restaurant inspectors by about 50%.
Open calls can also potentially be used to compare and test theories.
For example, the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study has tracked
about 5,000 children since birth in 20 different US cities (Reichman et al.
2001). Researchers have collected data about these children, their families,
and their broader environment at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15.
Given all the information about these children, how well could researchers
predict outcomes such as who will graduate from college? Or, expressed in
a way that would be more interesting to some researchers, which data and
theories would be most effective in predicting these outcomes? Since none
of these children are currently old enough to go to college, this would be a
true forward-looking prediction, and there are many different strategies that
researchers might employ. A researcher who believes that neighborhoods
are critical in shaping life outcomes might take one approach, while a
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
255

researcher who focuses on families might do something completely different.
Which of these approaches would work better? We don’t know, and in the
process of finding out, we might learn something important about families,
neighborhoods, education, and social inequality. Further, these predictions
might be used to guide future data collection. Imagine that there were a
small number of college graduates who were not predicted to graduate by
any of the models; these people would be ideal candidates for follow-up
qualitative interviews and ethnographic observation. Thus, in this kind of
open call, the predictions are not the end; rather, they provide a new way to
compare, enrich, and combine different theoretical traditions. This kind of
open call is not specific to using data from the Fragile Families and Child
Wellbeing Study to predict who will go to college; it could be used to predict
any outcome that will eventually be collected in any longitudinal social
data set.
As I wrote earlier in this section, there have not been many examples of
social researchers using open calls. I think that this is because open calls are
not well suited to the way that social scientists typically ask their questions.
Returning to the Netflix Prize, social scientists wouldn’t usually ask about
predicting tastes; rather, they would ask about how and why cultural tastes
differ for people from different social classes (see, e.g., Bourdieu (1987)).
Such “how” and “why” questions do not lead to easily verifiable solutions,
and therefore seem poorly fit to open calls. Thus, it appears that open calls are
more appropriate for questions of prediction than questions of explanation.
Recent theorists, however, have called on social scientists to reconsider the
dichotomy between explanation and prediction (Watts 2014). As the line
between prediction and explanation blurs, I expect open calls to become
increasingly common in social research.
5.4
Distributed data collection
Mass collaboration can also help with data collection, but it is tricky
to ensure data quality and systematic approaches to sampling.
In addition to creating human computation projects and open calls, re-
searchers can also create distributed data collection projects. In fact, much of
quantitative social science already relies on distributed data collection using
paid staff. For example, to collect the data for the General Social Survey, a
256
CHAPTER 5

company hires interviewers to collect information from respondents. But
what if we could somehow enlist volunteers as data collectors?
As the examples below—from ornithology and computer science—show,
distributed data collection enables researchers to collect data more frequently
and in more places than were possible previously. Further, given appropriate
protocols, these data can be reliable enough to be used for scientific research.
In fact, for certain research questions, distributed data collection is better
than anything that would realistically be possible with paid data collectors.
5.4.1 eBird
eBird collects data on birds from birders; volunteers provide scale
that no research team can match.
Birds are everywhere, and ornithologists would like to know where every
bird is at every moment. Given such a perfect dataset, ornithologists could
address many fundamental questions in their field. Of course, collecting these
data is beyond the scope of any particular researcher. At the same time that
ornithologists desire richer and more complete data, “birders”—people who
go bird watching for fun—are constantly observing birds and documenting
what they see. These two communities have a long history of collaborating,
but now these collaborations have been transformed by the digital age. eBird
is a distributed data collection project that solicits information from birders
around the world, and it has already received over 260 million bird sightings
from 250,000 participants (Kelling, Fink, et al. 2015).
Prior to the launch of eBird, most of the data created by birders were
unavailable to researchers:
“In thousands of closets around the world today lie countless note-
books, index cards, annotated checklists, and diaries. Those of us
involved with birding institutions know well the frustration of hearing
over and over again about ‘my late-uncle’s bird records’ [sic] We know
how valuable they could be. Sadly, we also know we can’t use them.”
(Fitzpatrick et al. 2002)
Rather than having these valuable data sit unused, eBird enables birders
to upload them to a centralized, digital database. Data uploaded to eBird
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
257

contain six key fields: who, where, when, what species, how many, and
effort. For non-birding readers, “effort” refers to the methods used while
making observations. Data quality checks begin even before the data are
uploaded. Birders trying to submit unusual reports—such as reports of very
rare species, very high counts, or out-of-season reports—are flagged, and
the website automatically requests additional information, such as pho-
tographs. After collecting this additional information, the flagged reports are
sent to one of hundreds of volunteer regional experts for further review.
After investigation by the regional expert—including possible additional
correspondence with the birder—the flagged reports are either discarded
as unreliable or entered into the eBird database (Kelling et al. 2012). This
database of screened observations is then made available to anyone in the
world with an Internet connection, and, so far, almost 100 peer-reviewed
publications have used it (Bonney et al. 2014). eBird clearly shows that
volunteer birders are able to collect data that are useful for real ornithology
research.
One of the beauties of eBird is that it captures “work” that is already
happening—in this case, birding. This feature enables the project to collect
data at a tremendous scale. However, the “work” done by birders does not
exactly match the data needed by ornithologists. For example, in eBird,
data collection is determined by the location of birders, not the location of
the birds. This means that, for example, most observations tend to occur
close to roads (Kelling et al. 2012; Kelling, Fink, et al. 2015). In addition
to this unequal distribution of effort over space, the actual observations
made by birders are not always ideal. For example, some birders only
upload information about species that they consider interesting, rather than
information on all species that they observed.
eBird researchers have two main solutions to these data quality issues—
solutions that might be helpful in other distributed data collection projects
as well. First, eBird researchers are constantly trying to upgrade the quality
of the data submitted by birders. For example, eBird offers education to
participants, and it has created visualizations of each participant’s data that,
by their design, encourage birders to upload information about all species
that they observed, not just the most interesting (Wood et al. 2011; Wiggins
2011). Second, eBird researchers use statistical models that attempt to correct
for the noisy and heterogeneous nature of the raw data (Fink et al. 2010;
Hurlbert and Liang 2012). It is not yet clear if these statistical models fully
258
CHAPTER 5

remove biases from the data, but ornithologists are confident enough in the
quality of adjusted eBird data that, as had been mentioned earlier, these data
have been used in almost 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications.
Many non-ornithologists are initially extremely skeptical when they hear
about eBird for the first time. In my opinion, part of this skepticism comes
from thinking about eBird in the wrong way. Many people first think “Are the
eBird data perfect?”, and the answer is “absolutely not.” However, that’s not
the right question. The right question is “For certain research questions, are
the eBird data better than existing ornithology data?” For that question, the
answer is “definitely yes,” in part because, for many questions of interest—
such as questions about large-scale seasonal migration—there are no realistic
alternatives to distributed data collection.
The eBird project demonstrates that it is possible to involve volunteers
in the collection of important scientific data. However, eBird, and related
projects, indicate that challenges related to sampling and data quality are
concerns for distributed data collection projects. As we will see in the next
section, however, with clever design and technology, these concerns can be
minimized in some settings.
5.4.2 PhotoCity
PhotoCity solves the data quality and sampling problems in
distributed data collection.
Websites such as Flickr and Facebook enable people to share pictures with
their friends and family, and they also create huge repositories of photos
that can be used for other purposes. For example, Sameer Agarwal and
colleagues (2011) attempted to use these photos to “Build Rome in a Day” by
repurposing 150,000 pictures of Rome to create a 3D reconstruction of the
city. For some heavily photographed buildings—such as the Coliseum (fig-
ure 5.10)—the researchers were partially successful, but the reconstructions
suffered because most photos were taken from the same iconic perspectives,
leaving portions of the buildings unphotographed. Thus, the images from
photo repositories were not enough. But what if volunteers could be enlisted
to collect the necessary photos to enrich those already available? Thinking
back to the art analogy in chapter 1, what if the readymade images could be
enriched by custommade images?

In order to enable the targeted collection of large numbers of photos,
Kathleen Tuite and colleagues developed PhotoCity, a photo-uploading
game. PhotoCity turned the potentially laborious task of data collection—
uploading photos—into a game-like activity involving teams, castles, and
flags (figure 5.11), and it was first deployed to create a 3D reconstruction
of two universities: Cornell University and the University of Washing-
ton. Researchers started the process by uploading seed photos from some

buildings. Then, players on each campus inspected the current state of the
reconstruction and earned points by uploading images that improved the
reconstruction. For example, if the current reconstruction of Uris Library
(at Cornell) was very patchy, a player could earn points by uploading new
pictures of it. Two features of this uploading process are very important.
First, the number of points a player received was based on the amount that
their photo added to reconstruction. Second, the photos that were uploaded
had to overlap with existing reconstruction so that they could be validated.
In the end, the researchers were able to create high-resolution 3D models of
buildings on both campuses (figure 5.12).
The design of PhotoCity solved two problems that often arise in dis-
tributed data collection: data validation and sampling. First, photos were
validated by comparing them against previous photos, which were in turn
compared with previous photos all the way back to the seed photos that were
uploaded by researchers. In other words, because of this built-in redundancy,
it was very difficult for someone to upload a photo of the wrong building,
either accidentally or intentionally. This design feature meant that the system
protected itself against bad data. Second, the scoring system naturally trained
participants to collect the most valuable—not the most convenient—data. In
fact, here are some of the strategies that players described using in order
to earn more points, which is equivalent to collecting more valuable data
(Tuite et al. 2011):
• “[I tried to] approximate the time of day and the lighting that
some pictures were taken; this would help prevent rejection by the
game. With that said, cloudy days were the best by far when dealing
with corners because less contrast helped the game figure out the
geometry from my pictures.”
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
261

• “When it was sunny, I utilized my camera’s anti-shake features to
allow myself to take photos while walking around a particular zone.
This allowed me to take crisp photos while not having to stop my
stride. Also bonus: less people stared at me!”
• “Taking many pictures of one building with 5 megapixel camera,
then coming home to submit, sometimes up to 5 gigs on a weekend
shoot, was primary photo capture strategy. Organizing photos on
external hard drive folders by campus region, building, then face of
building provided good hierarchy to structure uploads.”
These statements show that when participants are provided with appropriate
feedback, they can become quite expert at collecting data of interest to
researchers.
Overall, the PhotoCity project shows that sampling and data quality are
not insurmountable problems in distributed data collection. Further, it shows
that distributed data collection projects are not limited to tasks that people
are already doing anyway, such as watching birds. With the right design,
volunteers can be encouraged to do other things too.
5.4.3 Conclusion
Distributed data collection is possible, and in the future it will likely
involve technology and passive participation.
As eBird demonstrates, distributed data collection can be used for scientific
research. Further, PhotoCity shows that problems related to sampling and
data quality are potentially solvable. How might distributed data collec-
tion work for social research? One example comes from the work of Su-
san Watkins and her colleagues on the Malawi Journals Project (Watkins
and Swidler 2009; Kaler, Watkins, and Angotti 2015). In this project, 22
local residents—called “journalists”—kept “conversational journals” that
recorded, in detail, the conversations they overheard about AIDS in the
daily lives of ordinary people (at the time the project began, about 15%
of adults in Malawi were infected with HIV (Bello, Chipeta, and Aberle-
Grasse 2006)). Because of their insider status, these journalists were able to
overhear conversations that might have been inaccessible to Watkins and

her Western research collaborators (I’ll discuss the ethics of this later in the
chapter when I offer advice about designing your own mass collaboration
project). The data from the Malawi Journals Project have led to a number of
important findings. For example, before the project started, many outsiders
believed that there was silence about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, but the
conversational journals demonstrated that this was clearly not the case: jour-
nalists overheard hundreds of discussions of the topic, in locations as diverse
as funerals, bars, and churches. Further, the nature of these conversations
helped researchers better understand some of the resistance to condom
use; the way that condom use was framed in public health messages was
inconsistent with the way that it was discussed in everyday life (Tavory and
Swidler 2009).
Of course, like the data from eBird, the data from the Malawi Journals
Project are not perfect, an issue discussed in detail by Watkins and colleagues.
For example, the recorded conversations are not a random sample of all
possible conversations. Rather, they are an incomplete census of conver-
sations about AIDS. In terms of data quality, the researchers believed that
their journalists were high-quality reporters, as evidenced by the consistency
within journals and across journals. That is, because enough journalists were
deployed in a small enough setting and focused on a specific topic, it was
possible to use redundancy to assess and ensure data quality. For example,
a sex worker named “Stella” showed up several times in the journals of four
different journalists (Watkins and Swidler 2009). In order to further build
your intuition, table 5.3 shows other examples of distributed data collection
for social research.
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
263

All of the examples described in this section have involved active participa-
tion: journalists transcribed conversations that they heard; birders uploaded
their birding checklists; or players uploaded their photos. But what if the
participation was automatic and did not require any specific skill or time
to submit? This is the promise offered by “participatory sensing” or “people-
centric sensing.” For example, the Pothole Patrol, a project by scientists at
MIT, mounted GPS-equipped accelerometers inside seven taxi cabs in the
Boston area (Eriksson et al. 2008). Because driving over a pothole leaves a
distinct accelerometer signal, these devices, when placed inside of moving
taxis, can create pothole maps of Boston. Of course, taxis don’t randomly
sample roads, but, given enough taxis, there may be sufficient coverage to
provide information about large portions of they city. A second benefit of
passive systems that rely on technology is that they de-skill the process of
contributing data: while it requires skill to contribute to eBird (because you
need to be able to reliably identify bird species), it requires no special skills to
contribute to Pothole Patrol.
Going forward, I suspect that many distributed data collection projects
will begin to make use of capabilities of the mobile phones that are already
carried by billions of people around the world. These phones already have a
large number of sensors important for measurement, such as microphones,
cameras, GPS devices, and clocks. Further, they support third-party apps
enabling researchers some control over the underlying data collection pro-
tocols. Finally, they have Internet-connectivity, making it possible for them
to off-load the data they collect. There are numerous technical challenges,
ranging from inaccurate sensors to limited battery life, but these problems
will likely diminish over time as technology develops. Issues related to
privacy and ethics, on the other hand, might get more complicated; I’ll return
to questions of ethics when I offer advice about designing your own mass
collaboration.
In distributed data collection projects, volunteers contribute data about
the world. This approach has already been used successfully, and future uses
will likely have to address sampling and data quality concerns. Fortunately,
existing projects such as PhotoCity and Pothole Patrol suggest solutions to
these problems. As more projects take advantage of technology that enables
de-skilled and passive participation, distributed data collection projects
should dramatically increase in scale, enabling researchers to collect data that
were simply off limits in the past.
264
CHAPTER 5

5.5
Designing your own
Five principles for designing a mass collaboration project: motivate
participants, leverage heterogeneity, focus attention, enable surprise,
and be ethical.
Now that you might be excited about the potential for mass collaboration
to solve your scientific problem, I’d like to offer you some advice on how
to actually do it. Although mass collaborations may be less familiar than the
techniques described in earlier chapters, such as surveys and experiments,
they are not inherently any more difficult. Because the technologies that you
will be able to harness are developing rapidly, the most helpful advice that
I can offer is expressed in terms of general principles, rather than step-by-
step instructions. More specifically, there are five general principles that I
think will help you design a mass collaboration project: motivate participants,
leverage heterogeneity, focus attention, enable surprise, and be ethical.
5.5.1 Motivate participants
The biggest challenge in designing a scientific mass collaboration is matching
a meaningful scientific problem to a group of people who are willing and
able to solve that problem. Sometimes, the problem comes first, as in Galaxy
Zoo: given the task of categorizing galaxies, the researchers found people who
could help. However, other times, the people come first and the problem
second. For example, eBird attempts to harness the “work” that people are
already doing to help scientific research.
The simplest way to motivate participants is money. For example, any
researcher creating a human computation project on a microtask labor mar-
ket (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) is going to motivate participants with
money. Financial motivation may be sufficient for some human computation
problems, but many of the examples of mass collaboration in this chapter did
not use money to motivate participation (Galaxy Zoo, Foldit, Peer-to-Patent,
eBird, and PhotoCity). Instead, many of the more complex projects rely on a
combination of personal value and collective value. Roughly, personal value
comes from things like fun and competition (Foldit and PhotoCity), and
collective value can come from knowing that your contribution is helping
a greater good (Foldit, Galaxy Zoo, eBird, and Peer-to-Patent) (table 5.4).

If you are building your own project, you should think what will motivate
people to participate and the ethical issues raised by those motivations (more
on ethics later in this section).
5.5.2 Leverage heterogeneity
Once you have motivated a lot of people to work on a real scientific problem,
you will discover that your participants will be heterogeneous in two main
ways: they will vary both in their skill and in their level of effort. The first
reaction of many social researchers is to fight against this heterogeneity by
trying to exclude low-quality participants and then attempting to collect a
fixed amount of information from everyone left. This is the wrong way to
design a mass collaboration project. Instead of fighting heterogeneity, you
should leverage it.
First, there is no reason to exclude low-skilled participants. In open calls,
low-skilled participants cause no problems; their contributions don’t hurt
anyone and they don’t require any time to evaluate. In human computation
and distributed data collection projects, moreover, the best form of quality
control comes through redundancy, not through a high bar for participation.
In fact, rather than excluding low-skilled participants, a better approach
is to help them make better contributions, much as the researchers at eBird
have done.
266
CHAPTER 5

Second, there is no reason to collect a fixed amount of information
from each participant. Participation in many mass collaboration projects is
incredibly unequal (Sauermann and Franzoni 2015), with a small number of
people contributing a lot—sometimes called the fat head—and a lot of people
contributing a little—sometimes called the long tail. If you don’t collect
information from the fat head and the long tail, you are leaving masses of
information uncollected. For example, if Wikipedia accepted 10 and only 10
edits per editor, it would lose about 95% of edits (Salganik and Levy 2015).
Thus, with mass collaboration projects, it is best to leverage heterogeneity
rather than try to eliminate it.
5.5.3 Focus attention
Given that you have found a way to motivate participation and you are able
to leverage participants with wide-ranging interests and skills, the next major
challenge you have as a designer is to focus participants’ attention where it
will be the most valuable, a point developed extensively in Michael Nielsen’s
book Reinventing Discovery (2012). In human computation projects, such as
Galaxy Zoo, where researchers have explicit control of the tasks, the focus of
attention is easiest to maintain. For example, in Galaxy Zoo, the researchers
could have shown each galaxy until there was agreement about its shape.
Further, in distributed data collection, a scoring system can also be used
to focus individuals on providing the most useful input, as was done in
PhotoCity.
5.5.4 Enable surprise
Now that you have heterogeneous people working together on a meaningful
scientific problem, and you have their attention focused on where it can be
most valuable, be sure to leave room for them to surprise you. It is pretty cool
that citizen scientists have labeled galaxies at Galaxy Zoo and folded proteins
at Foldit. But, of course, that is what these projects were designed to enable.
What is even more amazing, in my opinion, is that these communities have
produced scientific results that were unanticipated even by their creators.
For example, the Galaxy Zoo community has discovered a new class of
astronomical object that they called “Green Peas.”
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
267

Very early in the Galaxy Zoo project, a few people had noticed unusual
green objects, but interest in them crystallized when Hanny van Arkel,
a Dutch school teacher, started a thread in the Galaxy Zoo discussion
forum with the catchy title: “Give Peas a Chance.” The thread, which
began August 12, 2007, started with jokes: “Are you collecting them for
dinner?,” “Peas stop,” and so on. But pretty soon, other Zooites started
posting their own peas. Over time, the posts became more technical and
detailed, until posts like this started showing up: “The OIII line (the ‘pea’
line, at 5007 angstrom) that you are following shifts towards the red as z
increases and disappears into the infra-red at about z = 0.5, ie is invisible”
(Nielsen 2012).
Over time, the Zooites were gradually understanding and systematizing
their observations of the peas. Finally, on July 8, 2008—almost a full year
later—Carolin Cardamone, an astronomy graduate student at Yale and
member of the Galaxy Zoo team, joined the thread to help organize the
“Pea Hunt.” More enthusiastic work ensued, and by July 9, 2009, a paper
had been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
with the title “Galaxy Zoo Green Peas: Discovery of a Class of Compact
Extremely Star-Forming Galaxies” (Cardamone et al. 2009). But interest
in the peas didn’t end there. Subsequently, they have been the subject of
further research by astronomers around the world (Izotov, Guseva, and
Thuan 2011; Chakraborti et al. 2012; Hawley 2012; Amorín et al. 2012).
Then, in 2016, less than 10 years after the first post by a Zooite, a paper
published in Nature proposed Green Peas as a possible explanation for an
important and puzzling pattern in the ionization of the universe. None of this
was ever imagined when Kevin Schawinski and Chris Lintott first discussed
Galaxy Zoo in a pub in Oxford. Fortunately, Galaxy Zoo enabled these
kinds of unexpected surprises by allowing participants to communicate with
each other.
5.5.5 Be ethical
The exhortation to be ethical applies to all the research described in this book.
In addition to the more general issues of ethics—discussed in chapter 6—
some specific ethical issues arise in the case of mass collaboration projects,
and since mass collaboration is so new to social research, these problems
might not be fully apparent at first.
268
CHAPTER 5

In all mass collaboration projects, issues of compensation and credit are
complex. For example, some people consider it unethical that thousands
of people worked for years on the Netflix Prize and ultimately received no
compensation. Similarly, some people consider it unethical to pay workers on
microtask labor markets extremely small amounts of money. In addition to
these issues of compensation, there are related issues of credit. Should all par-
ticipants in a mass collaboration be authors of the eventual scientific papers?
Different projects take different approaches. Some projects give authorship
credit to all members of the mass collaboration; for example, the final author
of the first Foldit paper was “Foldit players” (Cooper et al. 2010). In the
Galaxy Zoo family of projects, extremely active and important contributors
are sometimes invited to be coauthors on papers. For example, Ivan Terentev
and Tim Matorny, two Radio Galaxy Zoo participants were coauthors on
one of the papers that arose from that project (Banfield et al. 2016; Galaxy
Zoo 2016). Sometimes projects merely acknowledge contributions without
coauthorship. Decisions about coauthorship will obviously vary from case
to case.
Open calls and distributed data collection can also raise complex questions
about consent and privacy. For example, Netflix released customers’ movie
ratings to everyone. Although movie ratings might not appear sensitive,
they can reveal information about customers’ political preferences or sexual
orientation, information that customers did not agree to make public. Netflix
attempted to anonymize the data so that the ratings could not be linked to
any specific individual, but just weeks after the release of the Netflix data,
it was partially re-identified by Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov
(2008) (see chapter 6). Further, in distributed data collection, researchers
could collect data about people without their consent. For example, in the
Malawi Journals Projects, conversations about a sensitive topic (AIDS) were
transcribed without the consent of the participants. None of these ethical
problems are insurmountable, but they should be considered in the design
phase of a project. Remember, your “crowd” is made up of people.
5.5.6 Final design advice
In addition to these five general design principles, I’d like to offer two other
pieces of advice. First, the immediate reaction that you might encounter
when you propose a mass collaboration project is “Nobody would partici-
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
269

pate.” Of course that might be true. In fact, lack of participation is the biggest
risk that mass collaboration projects face. However, this objection usually
arises from thinking about the situation in the wrong way. Many people start
with themselves and work out: “I’m busy; I wouldn’t do that. And I don’t
know anyone that would do that. So, nobody would do that.” Instead of
starting with yourself and working out, however, you should start with the
entire population of people connected to the Internet and work in. If only one
in a million of these people participate, then your project could be a success.
But, if only one in a billion participate, then your project will probably be
a failure. Since our intuition is not good at distinguishing between one in a
million and one in a billion, we have to acknowledge that it is very hard to
know if projects will generate sufficient participation.
To make this a bit more concrete, let’s return to Galaxy Zoo. Imagine
Kevin Schawinski and Chris Linton, two astronomers sitting in a pub in
Oxford thinking about Galaxy Zoo. They would never have guessed—and
never could have guessed—that Aida Berges, a stay-at-home mother of two
living in Puerto Rico, would end up classifying hundreds of galaxies a week
(Masters 2009). Or consider the case of David Baker, the biochemist working
in Seattle developing Foldit. He could never have anticipated that someone
from McKinney, Texas named Scott “Boots” Zaccanelli, who worked by day
as a buyer for a valve factory, would spend his evenings folding proteins,
eventually rising to a number-six ranking on Foldit, and that Zaccaenlli
would, through the game, submit a design for a more stable variant of
fibronectin that Baker and his group found so promising that they decided
to synthesize it in their lab (Hand 2010). Of course, Aida Berges and Scott
Zaccanelli are atypical, but that is the power of the Internet: with billions of
people, it is typical to find the atypical.
Second, given this difficulty with predicting participation, I’d like to
remind you that creating a mass collaboration project can be risky. You could
invest a lot of effort building a system that nobody will want to use. For
example, Edward Castronova—a leading researcher in the field of economics
of virtual worlds, armed with a grant of $250,000 from the MacArthur
Foundation, and supported by a team of developers—spent nearly two years
trying to build a virtual world within which he could conduct economic
experiments. In the end, the whole effort was a failure because nobody
wanted to play in Castonova’s virtual world; it just wasn’t very much fun
(Baker 2008).
270
CHAPTER 5

Given the uncertainty about participation, which is hard to eliminate,
I suggest that you try to use lean start-up techniques (Blank 2013): build
simple prototypes using off-the-shelf software and see if you can demonstrate
viability before investing in lots of custom software development. In other
words, when you start pilot testing, your project will not—and should not—
look as polished as Galaxy Zoo or eBird. These projects, as they are now, are
the results of years of effort by large teams. If your project is going to fail—
and that is a real possibility—then you want to fail fast.
5.6
Conclusion
Mass collaboration will enable researchers to solve scientiﬁc
problems that were impossible to solve before.
The digital age enables mass collaboration in scientific research. Rather than
just collaborating with a small number of colleagues or research assistants,
as in the past, we can now collaborate with everyone in the world who has
an Internet connection. As the examples in this chapter show, these new
forms of mass collaboration have already enabled real progress on important
problems. Some skeptics may doubt the applicability of mass collaboration
for social research, but I am optimistic. Quite simply, there are a lot of people
in the world, and if our talents and energies can be harnessed, we can do
amazing things together. In other words, in addition to learning from people
by observing their behavior (chapter 2), asking them questions (chapter 3),
or enrolling them in experiments (chapter 4), we can also learn from people
by making them research collaborators.
For the purposes of social research, I think it is helpful to divide mass
collaboration projects into three rough groups:
• In human computation projects, researchers combine the efforts of
many people working on simple microtasks in order to solve problems
that are impossibly big for one person.
• In open call projects, researchers pose a problem with an easy-to-check
solution, solicit solutions from many people, and then pick the best.
• In distributed data collection projects, researchers enable participants
to contribute new measurements of the world.
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
271

In addition to advancing social research, mass collaboration projects also
have democratizing potential. These projects broaden both the range of
people who can organize large-scale projects and the range of people who can
contribute to them. Just as Wikipedia changed what we thought was possible,
future mass collaboration projects will change what we think is possible in
scientific research.
What to read next
• Introduction (section 5.1)
Mass collaboration blends ideas from citizen science, crowdsourcing, and collec-
tive intelligence. Citizen science usually means involving “citizens” (i.e., nonsci-
entists) in the scientific process; for more, see Crain, Cooper, and Dickinson
(2014) and Bonney et al. (2014). Crowdsourcing usually means taking a problem
ordinarily solved within an organization and instead outsourcing it to a crowd;
for more, see Howe (2009). Collective intelligence usually means groups of
individuals acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent; for more, see Malone
and Bernstein (2015). Nielsen (2012) is a book-length introduction to the power
of mass collaboration for scientific research.
There are many types of mass collaboration that don’t fit neatly into the
three categories that I have proposed, and I think three of these deserve
special attention because they might be useful in social research. One example
is prediction markets, where participants buy and trade contracts that are
redeemable based on outcomes that occur in the world. Predicting markets are
often used by firms and governments for forecasting, and they have also been
used by social researchers to predict the replicability of published studies in
psychology (Dreber et al. 2015). For an overview of prediction markets, see
Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004) and Arrow et al. (2008).
A second example that does not fit well into my categorization scheme is
the PolyMath project, where researchers collaborated using blogs and wikis to
prove new math theorems. The PolyMath project is in some ways similar to
the Netflix Prize, but in this project participants more actively built on the
partial solutions of others. For more on the PolyMath project, see Gowers and
Nielsen (2009), Cranshaw and Kittur (2011), Nielsen (2012), and Kloumann
et al. (2016).
A third example that does not fit well into my categorization scheme is that of
time-dependent mobilizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) Network Challenge (i.e., the Red Balloon Challenge). For
more on these time-sensitive mobilizations see Pickard et al. (2011), Tang et al.
(2011), and Rutherford et al. (2013).
272
CHAPTER 5

• Human computation (section 5.2)
The term “human computation” comes out of work done by computer scientists,
and understanding the context behind this research will improve your ability
to pick out problems that might be suitable for it. For certain tasks, computers
are incredibly powerful, with capabilities far exceeding those of even expert
humans. For example, in chess, computers can beat even the best grandmasters.
But—and this is less well appreciated by social scientists—for other tasks,
computers are actually much worse than people. In other words, right now you
are better than even the most sophisticated computer at certain tasks involving
processing of images, video, audio, and text. Computer scientists working on
these hard-for-computers–easy-for-human tasks therefore realized that they
could include humans in their computational process. Here’s how Luis von
Ahn (2005) described human computation when he first coined the term in
his dissertation: “a paradigm for utilizing human processing power to solve
problems that computers cannot yet solve.” For a book-length treatment of
human computation, in the most general sense of the term, see Law and von
Ahn (2011).
According to the definition proposed in von Ahn (2005), Foldit—which I de-
scribed in the section on open calls—could be considered a human computation
project. However, I choose to categorize Foldit as an open call, because it requires
specialized skills (although not necessarily formal training) and it takes the best
solution contributed, rather than using a split–apply–combine strategy.
The term “split–apply–combine” was used by Wickham (2011) to describe a
strategy for statistical computing, but it perfectly captures the process of many
human computation projects. The split–apply–combine strategy is similar to
the MapReduce framework developed at Google; for more on MapReduce, see
Dean and Ghemawat (2004) and Dean and Ghemawat (2008). For more on other
distributed computing architectures, see Vo and Silvia (2016). Chapter 3 of Law
and von Ahn (2011) has a discussion of projects with more complex combine
steps than those in this chapter.
In the human computation projects that I have discussed in this chapter,
participants were aware of what was happening. Some other projects, however,
seek to capture “work” that is already happening (similar to eBird) and without
participant awareness. See, for example, the ESP Game (von Ahn and Dabbish
2004) and reCAPTCHA (von Ahn et al. 2008). However, both of these projects
also raise ethical questions because participants did not know how their data
were being used (Zittrain 2008; Lung 2012).
Inspired by the ESP Game, many researchers have attempted to develop
other “games with a purpose” (von Ahn and Dabbish 2008) (i.e., “human-based
computation games” (Pe-Than, Goh, and Lee 2015)) that can be used to solve a
variety of other problems. What these “games with a purpose” have in common
is that they try to make the tasks involved in human computation enjoyable.
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
273

Thus, while the ESP Game shares the same split–apply–combine structure as
Galaxy Zoo, it differs in how participants are motivated—fun versus desire to
help science. For more on games with a purpose, see von Ahn and Dabbish
(2008).
My description of Galaxy Zoo draws on Nielsen (2012), Adams (2012),
Clery (2011), and Hand (2010), and my presentation of the research goals of
Galaxy Zoo was simplified. For more on the history of galaxy classification in
astronomy and how Galaxy Zoo continues this tradition, see Masters (2012) and
Marshall, Lintott, and Fletcher (2015). Building on Galaxy Zoo, the researchers
completed Galaxy Zoo 2, which collected more than 60 million more complex
morphological classifications from volunteers (Masters et al. 2011). Further, they
branched out into problems outside of galaxy morphology, including exploring
the surface of the Moon, searching for planets, and transcribing old documents.
Currently, all their projects are collected at the Zooniverse website (Cox et al.
2015). One of the projects—Snapshot Serengeti—provides evidence that Galaxy
Zoo-type image classification projects can also be done for environmental
research (Swanson et al. 2016).
For researchers planning to use a microtask labor market (e.g., Amazon
Mechanical Turk) for a human computation project, Chandler, Paolacci, and
Mueller (2013) and Wang, Ipeirotis, and Provost (2015) offer good advice
on task design and other related issues. Porter, Verdery, and Gaddis (2016)
offer examples and advice focused specifically on uses of microtask labor
markets for what they call “data augmentation.” The line between data aug-
mentation and data collection is somewhat blurry. Finally, for more on col-
lecting and using labels for supervised learning for text, see Grimmer and
Stewart (2013).
Researchers interested in creating what I’ve called computer-assisted human
computation systems (e.g., systems that use human labels to train a machine
learning model) might be interested in Shamir et al. (2014) (for an example using
audio) and Cheng and Bernstein (2015). Also, the machine learning models in
these projects can be solicited with open calls, whereby researchers compete to
create machine learning models with the greatest predictive performance. For
example, the Galaxy Zoo team ran an open call and found a new approach that
outperformed the one developed in Banerji et al. (2010); see Dieleman, Willett,
and Dambre (2015) for details.
• Open calls (section 5.3)
Open calls are not new. In fact, one of the most well-known open calls dates back
to 1714 when Britain’s Parliament created The Longitude Prize for anyone that
could develop a way to determine the longitude of a ship at sea. The problem
stumped many of the greatest scientists of the days, including Isaac Newton, and
the winning solution was eventually submitted by John Harrison, a clockmaker
from the countryside who approached the problem differently from scientists
274
CHAPTER 5

who were focused on a solution that would somehow involve astronomy; for
more information, see Sobel (1996). As this example illustrates, one reason that
open calls are thought to work so well is that they provide access to people
with different perspectives and skills (Boudreau and Lakhani 2013). See Hong
and Page (2004) and Page (2008) for more on the value of diversity in problem
solving.
Each of the open call cases in the chapter requires a bit of further explanation
for why it belongs in this category. First, one way that I distinguish between
human computation and open call projects is whether the output is an average
of all the solutions (human computation) or the best solution (open call). The
Netflix Prize is somewhat tricky in this regard because the best solution turned
out to be a sophisticated average of individual solutions, an approach called
an ensemble solution (Bell, Koren, and Volinsky 2010; Feuerverger, He, and
Khatri 2012). From the perspective of Netflix, however, all they had to do was
pick the best solution. For more on the Netflix Prize, see Bennett and Lanning
(2007), Thompson (2008), Bell, Koren, and Volinsky (2010), and Feuerverger,
He, and Khatri (2012).
Second, by some definitions of human computation (e.g., von Ahn (2005)),
Foldit should be considered a human computation project. However, I choose
to categorize it as an open call because it requires specialized skills (although
not necessarily specialized training) and it takes the best solution, rather
than using a split–apply–combine strategy. For more on Foldit, see Cooper
et al. (2010), Khatib et al. (2011), and Andersen et al. (2012); my descrip-
tion of Foldit draws on descriptions in Bohannon (2009), Hand (2010), and
Nielsen (2012).
Finally, one could argue that Peer-to-Patent is an example of distributed data
collection. I choose to include it as an open call because it has a contest-like
structure and only the best contributions are used, whereas with distributed data
collection, the idea of good and bad contributions is less clear. For more on Peer-
to-Patent, see Noveck (2006), Ledford (2007), Noveck (2009), and Bestor and
Hamp (2010).
In terms of using open calls in social research, results similar to those of
Glaeser et al. (2016) are reported in chapter 10 of Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier
(2013), whereby New York City was able to use predictive modeling to produce
large gains in the productivity of housing inspectors. In New York City, these
predictive models were built by city employees, but in other cases, one could
imagine that they could be created or improved with open calls (e.g., Glaeser
et al. (2016)). However, one major concern with predictive models being used to
allocate resources is that these models have the potential to reinforce existing
biases. Many researchers already know “garbage in, garbage out,” and with
predictive models it can be “bias in, bias out.” See Barocas and Selbst (2016) and
O’Neil (2016) for more on the dangers of predictive models built with biased
training data.
CREATING MASS COLLABORATION
275

One problem that might prevent governments from using open contests is
that this requires data release, which could lead to privacy violations. For more
about privacy and data release in open calls, see Narayanan, Huey, and Felten
(2016) and the discussion in chapter 6.
For more on the differences and similarities between prediction and expla-
nation, see Breiman (2001), Shmueli (2010), Watts (2014), and Kleinberg et al.
(2015). For more on the role of prediction in social research, see Athey (2017),
Cederman and Weidmann (2017), Hofman et al. (2017), Subrahmaniian and
Kumar (2017), and Yarkoni and Westfall (2017).
For a review of open call projects in biology, including design advice, see
Saez-Rodriguez et al. (2016).
• Distributed data collection (section 5.4)
My description of eBird draws on descriptions in Bhattacharjee (2005), Robbins
(2013), and Sullivan et al. (2014). For more on how researchers use statistical
models to analyze eBird data, see Fink et al. (2010) and Hurlbert and Liang
(2012). For more on estimating the skill of eBird participants, see Kelling,
Johnston, et al. (2015). For more on the history of citizen science in ornithology,
see Greenwood (2007).
For more on the Malawi Journals Project, see Watkins and Swidler (2009)
and Kaler, Watkins, and Angotti (2015). For more on a related project in South
Africa, see Angotti and Sennott (2015). For more examples of research using
data from the Malawi Journals Project, see Kaler (2004) and Angotti et al.
(2014).
• Designing your own (section 5.5)
My approach to offering design advice was inductive, based on the examples of
successful and failed mass collaboration projects that I’ve heard about. There
has also been a stream of research attempts to apply more general social
psychological theories to designing online communities that is relevant to the
design of mass collaboration projects, see, for example, Kraut et al. (2012).
Regarding motivating participants, it is actually quite tricky to figure out
exactly why people participate in mass collaboration projects (Cooper et al. 2010;
Nov, Arazy, and Anderson 2011; Tuite et al. 2011; Raddick et al. 2013; and Preist,
Massung, and Coyle 2014). If you plan to motivate participants with payment on
a microtask labor market (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk), Kittur et al. (2013)
offers some advice.
Regarding enabling surprise, for more examples of unexpected discover-
ies coming out of Zooniverse projects, see Marshall, Lintott, and Fletcher
(2015).
Regarding being ethical, some good general introductions to the issues
involved are Gilbert (2015), Salehi et al. (2015), Schmidt (2013), Williamson
(2016), Resnik, Elliott, and Miller (2015), and Zittrain (2008). For issues specifi-
276
CHAPTER 5

cally related to legal issues with crowd employees, see Felstiner (2011). O’Connor
(2013) addresses questions about ethical oversight of research when the roles
of researchers and participants blur. For issues related to sharing data while
protecting participants in citizen science projects, see Bowser et al. (2014).
Both Purdam (2014) and Windt and Humphreys (2016) have some discussion
about the ethical issues in distributed data collection. Finally, most projects
acknowledge contributions, but do not give authorship credit to participants.
In Foldit, the players are often listed as an author (Cooper et al. 2010; Khatib
et al. 2011). In other open call projects, the winning contributor can often write
a paper describing their solutions (e.g., Bell, Koren, and Volinsky (2010) and
Dieleman, Willett, and Dambre (2015)).

CHAPTER 6
ETHICS
6.1
Introduction
The previous chapters have shown that the digital age creates new opportu-
nities for collecting and analyzing social data. The digital age has also created
new ethical challenges. The goal of this chapter is to give you the tools that
you need to handle these ethical challenges responsibly.
There is currently uncertainty about the appropriate conduct of some
digital-age social research. This uncertainty has led to two related problems,
one of which has received much more attention than the other. On the
one hand, some researchers have been accused of violating people’s privacy
or enrolling participants in unethical experiments. These cases—which I’ll
describe in this chapter—have been the subject of extensive debate and
discussion. On the other hand, the ethical uncertainty has also had a chilling
effect, preventing ethical and important research from happening, a fact
that I think is much less appreciated. For example, during the 2014 Ebola
outbreak, public health officials wanted information about the mobility of
people in the most heavily infected countries in order to help control the
outbreak. Mobile phone companies had detailed call records that could have
provided some of this information. Yet ethical and legal concerns bogged
down researchers’ attempts to analyze the data (Wesolowski et al. 2014;
McDonald 2016). If we, as a community, can develop ethical norms and
standards that are shared by both researchers and the public—and I think we
can do this—then we can harness the capabilities of the digital age in ways
that are responsible and beneficial to society.
One barrier to creating these shared standards is that social scientists and
data scientists tend to have different approaches to research ethics. For social
scientists, thinking about ethics is dominated by Institutional Review Boards
(IRBs) and the regulations that they are tasked with enforcing. After all,
281

the only way that most empirical social scientists experience ethical debate
is through the bureaucratic process of IRB review. Data scientists, on the
other hand, have little systematic experience with research ethics because it
is not commonly discussed in computer science and engineering. Neither of
these approaches—the rules-based approach of social scientists or the ad hoc
approach of data scientists—is well suited for social research in the digital age.
Instead, I believe that we, as a community, will make progress if we adopt a
principles-based approach. That is, researchers should evaluate their research
through existing rules—which I will take as given and assume should be
followed—and through more general ethical principles. This principles-
based approach helps researchers make reasonable decisions for cases where
rules have not yet been written, and it helps researchers communicate their
reasoning to each other and the public.
The principles-based approach that I am advocating is not new. It draws
on decades of previous thinking, much of which was crystallized in two
landmark reports: the Belmont Report and the Menlo Report. As you will
see, in some cases, the principles-based approach leads to clear, actionable
solutions. And when it does not lead to such solutions, it clarifies the
trade-offs involved, which is critical for striking an appropriate balance.
Further, the principles-based approach is sufficiently general that it will
be helpful no matter where you work (e.g., university, government, NGO,
or company).
This chapter has been designed to help a well-meaning individual re-
searcher. How should you think about the ethics of your own work? What
can you do to make your own work more ethical? In section 6.2, I’ll describe
three digital-age research projects that have generated ethical debate. Then,
in section 6.3, I’ll abstract from those specific examples to describe what I
think is the fundamental reason for ethical uncertainty: rapidly increasing
power for researchers to observe and experiment on people without their
consent or even awareness. These capabilities are changing faster than our
norms, rules, and laws. Next, in section 6.4, I’ll describe four existing princi-
ples that can guide your thinking: Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Justice,
and Respect for Law and Public Interest. Then, in section 6.5, I’ll summarize
two broad ethical frameworks—consequentialism and deontology—that can
help you with one of the deepest challenges that you might face: when is it
appropriate for you to use ethically questionable means in order to achieve
an ethically appropriate end. These principles and ethical frameworks—

Figure 6.1: The rules governing research are derived from principles that in turn are derived
from ethical frameworks. A main argument of this chapter is that researchers should evaluate
their research through existing rules—which I will take as given and assume should be
followed—and through more general ethical principles. The Common Rule is the set of
regulations currently governing most federally funded research in the United States (for
more information, see the historical appendix to this chapter). The four principles come
from two blue-ribbon panels that were created to provide ethical guidance to researchers: the
Belmont Report and the Menlo Report (for more information, see the historical appendix).
Finally, consequentialism and deontology are ethical frameworks that have been developed by
philosophers for hundreds of years. A quick and crude way to distinguish the two frameworks
is that deontologists focus on means and consequentialists focus on ends.
summarized in figure 6.1—will enable you to move beyond focusing on what
is permitted by existing regulations and increase your ability to communicate
your reasoning with other researchers and the public.
With that background, in section 6.6, I will discuss four areas that
are particularly challenging for digital age social researchers: informed
consent (section 6.6.1), understanding and managing informational risk
(section 6.6.2), privacy (section 6.6.3), and making ethical decisions in the
face of uncertainty (section 6.6.4). Finally, in section 6.7, I’ll offer three
practical tips for working in an area with unsettled ethics. The chapter con-
cludes with a historical appendix, where I briefly summarize the evolution
of research ethics oversight in the United States, including discussions of the
Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the Belmont Report, the Common Rule, and the
Menlo Report.
6.2
Three examples
Digital-age social research will involve situations where reasonable,
well-meaning people will disagree about ethics.
To keep things concrete, I’ll start with three examples of digital-age studies
that have generated ethical controversy. I’ve selected these particular studies
ETHICS
283

for two reasons. First, there are no easy answers about any of them. That is,
reasonable, well-meaning people disagree about whether these studies should
have happened and what changes might improve them. Second, these studies
embody many of the principles, frameworks, and areas of tension that will
follow later in the chapter.
6.2.1 Emotional Contagion
700,000 Facebook users were put into an experiment that may
have altered their emotions. The participants did not give consent,
and the study was not subject to meaningful third-party ethical
oversight.
For one week in January 2012, approximately 700,000 Facebook users were
placed in an experiment to study “emotional contagion,” the extent to which
a person’s emotions are impacted by the emotions of the people with whom
they interact. I’ve discussed this experiment in chapter 4, but I’ll review
it again now. Participants in the Emotional Contagion experiment were
put into four groups: a “negativity-reduced” group, for whom posts with
negative words (e.g., sad) were randomly blocked from appearing in the
News Feed; a “positivity-reduced” group, for whom posts with positive words
(e.g., happy) were randomly blocked; and two control groups, one for the
positivity-reduced group and one for the negativity-reduced group. The
researchers found that people in the positivity-reduced group used slightly
fewer positive words and slightly more negative words relative to the control
group. Likewise, they found that people in the negativity-reduced group used
slightly more positive words and slightly fewer negative words. Thus, the
researchers found evidence of emotional contagion (Kramer, Guillory, and
Hancock 2014); for a more complete discussion of the design and results of
the experiment, see chapter 4.
After this paper was published in Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, there was an enormous outcry from both researchers and the
press. Outrage around the paper focused on two main points: (1) participants
did not provide any consent beyond the standard Facebook terms of service
and (2) the study had not undergone meaningful third-party ethical review
(Grimmelmann 2015). The ethical questions raised in this debate caused the
journal to quickly publish a rare “editorial expression of concern” about
284
CHAPTER 6

the ethics and ethical review process for the research (Verma 2014). In
subsequent years, this experiment has continued to be a source of intense
debate and disagreement, and the criticism of this experiment may have
had the unintended effect of driving this kind of research into the shadows
(Meyer 2014). That is, some have argued that companies have not stopped
running these kinds of experiments—they have merely stopped talking about
them in public. This debate may have helped spur the creation of an ethical
review process for research at Facebook (Hernandez and Seetharaman 2016;
Jackman and Kanerva 2016).
6.2.2 Tastes, Ties, and Time
Researchers scraped students’ data from Facebook, merged it with
university records, used these merged data for research, and then
shared them with other researchers.
Beginning in 2006, each year, a team of professors and research assistants
scraped the Facebook profiles of members of the Class of 2009 at a “diverse
private college in the Northeastern U.S.” The researchers then merged these
data from Facebook, which included information about friendships and
cultural tastes, with data from the college, which included information
about academic majors and where the students lived on campus. These
merged data were a valuable resource, and they were used to create new
knowledge about topics such as how social networks form (Wimmer and
Lewis 2010) and how social networks and behavior co-evolve (Lewis, Gon-
zalez, and Kaufman 2012). In addition to using these data for their own
work, the Tastes, Ties, and Time researchers made them available to other
researchers, after taking some steps to protect the students’ privacy (Lewis
et al. 2008).
Unfortunately, just days after the data were made available, other re-
searchers deduced that the school in question was Harvard College (Zimmer
2010). The Tastes, Ties, and Time researchers were accused of a “failure to
adhere to ethical research standards” (Zimmer 2010), in part because the
students had not provided informed consent (all procedures were reviewed
and approved by Harvard’s IRB and Facebook). In addition to criticism from
academics, newspaper articles appeared with headlines such as “Harvard Re-
ETHICS
285

searchers Accused of Breaching Students’ Privacy” (Parry 2011). Ultimately,
the dataset was removed from the Internet, and it can no longer be used by
other researchers.
6.2.3 Encore
Researchers caused people’s computers to secretly visit websites
that were potentially blocked by repressive governments.
In March 2014, Sam Burnett and Nick Feamster launched Encore, a system
to provide real-time and global measurements of Internet censorship. To
do this, the researchers, who were at Georgia Tech, encouraged website
owners to install this small code snippet into the source files of their
web pages:
<iframe src="//encore.noise.gatech.edu/task.html"
width="0" height="0"
style="display: none"></iframe>
If you happen to visit a web page with this code snippet in it, your web
browser will try to contact a website that the researchers were monitoring for
possible censorship (e.g., the website of a banned political party). Then, your
web browser will report back to the researchers about whether it was able to
contact the potentially blocked website (figure 6.2). Further, all of this will
be invisible unless you check the HTML source file of the web page. Such
invisible third-party page requests are actually quite common on the web
(Narayanan and Zevenbergen 2015), but they rarely involve explicit attempts
to measure censorship.
This approach to measuring censorship has some very attractive tech-
nical properties. If a sufficient number of websites include this simple
code snippet, then Encore can provide a real-time, global-scale measure
of which websites are censored. Before launching the project, the re-
searchers conferred with their IRB, which declined to review the project
because it was not “human subjects research” under the Common Rule
(the set of regulations governing most federally funded research in the
United States; for more information, see the historical appendix to this
chapter).

such as a government, may then block your access to the measurement target (step 4). Finally,
your computer reports the results of this request to the researchers (not shown in the figure).

Soon after Encore was launched, however, Ben Zevenbergen, then a
graduate student, contacted to the researchers to raise questions about
the ethics of the project. In particular, Zevenbergen was concerned that
people in certain countries could be exposed to risk if their computer
attempted to visit certain sensitive websites, and these people did not con-
sent to participate in the study. Based on these conversations, the Encore
team modified the project to attempt to measure the censorship of only
Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, because third-party attempts to access
these sites are common during normal web browsing (Narayanan and
Zevenbergen 2015).
After collecting data using this modified design, a paper describing the
methodology and some results was submitted to SIGCOMM, a prestigious
computer science conference. The program committee appreciated the tech-
nical contribution of the paper, but expressed concern about the lack of
informed consent from participants. Ultimately, the program committee
decided to publish the paper, but with a signing statement expressing ethical
ETHICS
287

concerns (Burnett and Feamster 2015). Such a signing statement had never
been used before at SIGCOMM, and this case has led to additional debate
among computer scientists about the nature of ethics in their research
(Narayanan and Zevenbergen 2015; Jones and Feamster 2015).
6.3
Digital is different
Social research in the digital age has different characteristics and
therefore raises different ethical questions.
In the analog age, most social research had a relatively limited scale and
operated within a set of reasonably clear rules. Social research in the digital
age is different. Researchers—often in collaboration with companies and
governments—have more power over participants than in the past, and
the rules about how that power should be used are not yet clear. By
power, I mean simply the ability to do things to people without their
consent or even awareness. The kinds of things that researchers can do
to people include observing their behavior and enrolling them in experi-
ments. As the power of researchers to observe and perturb is increasing,
there has not been an equivalent increase in clarity about how that power
should be used. In fact, researchers must decide how to exercise their
power based on inconsistent and overlapping rules, laws, and norms. This
combination of powerful capabilities and vague guidelines creates difficult
situations.
One set of powers that researchers now have is the ability to observe
people’s behavior without their consent or awareness. Researchers could, of
course, do this in past, but in the digital age, the scale is completely different, a
fact that has been proclaimed repeatedly by many fans of big data sources. In
particular, if we move from the scale of an individual student or professor
and instead consider the scale of a company or government—institutions
with which researchers increasingly collaborate—the potential ethical issues
become complex. One metaphor that I think helps people visualize the idea of
mass surveillance is the panopticon. Originally proposed by Jeremy Bentham
as an architecture for prisons, the panopticon is a circular building with
cells built around a central watchtower (figure 6.3). Whoever occupies this
watchtower can observe the behavior of all the people in the rooms without
being seen herself. The person in the watchtower is thus an unseen seer
288
CHAPTER 6

center, there is an unseen seer who can observe the behavior of everyone but cannot
be observed. Drawing by Willey Reveley, 1791. (Source: The Works of Jeremy Bentham,
vol. 4/Wikimedia Commons).
(Foucault 1995). To some privacy advocates, the digital age has moved us
into a panoptic prison where tech companies and governments are constantly
watching and recoding our behavior.
To carry this metaphor a bit further, when many social researchers think
about the digital age, they imagine themselves inside of the watchtower,
observing behavior and creating a master database that could be used to do
all kinds of exciting and important research. But now, rather than imagining
ETHICS
289

yourself in the watchtower, imagine yourself in one of the cells. That master
database starts to look like what Paul Ohm (2010) has called a database of
ruin, which could be used in unethical ways.
Some readers of this book are lucky enough to live in countries where
they trust their unseen seers to use their data responsibly and to protect it
from adversaries. Other readers are not so lucky, and I’m sure that issues
raised by mass surveillance are very clear to them. But I believe that even
for the lucky readers there is still an important concern raised by mass
surveillance: unanticipated secondary use. That is, a database created for
one purpose—say targeting ads—might one day be used for a very differ-
ent purpose. A horrific example of unanticipated secondary use happened
during the Second World War, when government census data were used to
facilitate the genocide that was taking place against Jews, Roma, and others
(Seltzer and Anderson 2008). The statisticians who collected the data during
peaceful times almost certainly had good intentions, and many citizens
trusted them to use the data responsibly. But, when the world changed—
when the Nazis came to power—these data enabled a secondary use that
was never anticipated. Quite simply, once a master database exists, it is hard
to anticipate who may gain access to it and how it will be used. In fact,
William Seltzer and Margo Anderson (2008) have documented 18 cases in
which population data systems have been involved or potentially involved in
human rights abuses (table 6.1). Further, as Seltzer and Anderson point out,
this list is almost certainly an underestimate, because most abuses happen
in secret.
Ordinary social researchers are very, very far from anything like partici-
pating in human rights abuses through secondary use. I’ve chosen to discuss
it, however, because I think it will help you understand how some people
might react to your work. Let’s return to the Tastes, Ties, and Time project as
an example. By merging together complete and granular data from Facebook
with complete and granular data from Harvard, the researchers created an
amazingly rich view of the social and cultural life of the students (Lewis et al.
2008). To many social researchers, this seems like the master database, which
could be used for good. But to some others, it looks like the beginning of the
database of ruin, which could be used unethically. In fact, it is probably a bit
of both.
In addition to mass surveillance, researchers—again in collaboration with
companies and governments—can increasingly intervene in people’s lives in

order to create randomized controlled experiments. For example, in Emo-
tional Contagion, researchers enrolled 700,000 people in an experiment
without their consent or awareness. As I described in chapter 4, this kind of
secret conscription of participants into experiments is not uncommon, and
it does not require the cooperation of large companies. In fact, in chapter 4, I
taught you how to do it.
In the face of this increased power, researchers are subject to inconsistent
and overlapping rules, laws, and norms. One source of this inconsistency
is that the capabilities of the digital age are changing more quickly than
rules, laws, and norms. For example, the Common Rule (the set of regu-
lations governing most government-funded research in the United States)
has not changed much since 1981, and a recent effort to modernize it
took almost five and a half years to complete (Jaschik 2017). A second
source of inconsistency is that norms around abstract concepts such as
privacy are still being actively debated by researchers, policy makers, and
activists. If specialists in these areas cannot reach a uniform consensus, we
should not expect empirical researchers or participants to do so. A third
and final source of inconsistency is that digital-age research is increasingly
mixed into other contexts, which leads to potentially overlapping norms
and rules. For example, Emotional Contagion was a collaboration between
a data scientist at Facebook and a professor and graduate student at Cor-
nell. At that time, it was common at Facebook to run large experiments
without third-party oversight, as long as the experiments complied with
Facebook’s terms of service. At Cornell, the norms and rules are quite
different; virtually all experiments must be reviewed by the Cornell IRB.
So, which set of rules should govern Emotional Contagion—Facebook’s or
Cornell’s? When there are inconsistent and overlapping rules, laws, and
norms, even well-meaning researchers might have trouble doing the right
thing. In fact, because of the inconsistency, there might not even be a single
right thing.
Overall, these two features—increasing power and lack of agreement
about how that power should be used—mean that researchers working in
the digital age are going to be facing ethical challenges for the foreseeable
future. Fortunately, when dealing with these challenges, it is not necessary to
start from scratch. Instead, researchers can draw wisdom from previously
developed ethical principles and frameworks, the topics of the next two
sections.
ETHICS
293

6.4
Four principles
Four principles that can guide researchers facing ethical uncertainty
are: Respect for Persons, Beneﬁcence, Justice, and Respect for Law
and Public Interest.
The ethical challenges that researchers face in the digital age are somewhat
different than those in the past. However, researchers can address these
challenges by building on earlier ethical thinking. In particular, I believe
that the principles expressed in two reports—the Belmont Report (Belmont
Report 1979) and the Menlo Report (Dittrich, Kenneally, and others 2011)—
can help researchers reason about the ethical challenges that they face. As I
describe in more detail in the historical appendix to this chapter, both of these
reports were the results of many years of deliberation by panels of experts
with many opportunities for input from a variety of stakeholders.
First, in 1974, in response to ethical failures by researchers—such as the
notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Study in which almost 400 hundred African
American men were actively deceived by researchers and denied access
to safe and effective treatment for almost 40 years (see the historical
appendix)—the US Congress created a national commission to produce
ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects. After four years
of meeting at the Belmont Conference Center, the group produced the
Belmont Report, a slender but powerful document. The Belmont Report is
the intellectual basis for the Common Rule, the set of regulations governing
human subjects research that IRBs are tasked with enforcing (Porter and
Koski 2008).
Then, in 2010, in response to the ethical failures of computer security
researchers and the difficulty of applying the ideas in the Belmont Report
to digital-age research, the US Government—specifically the Department of
Homeland Security—created a blue-ribbon commission to produce a guiding
ethical framework for research involving information and communication
technologies (ICT). The result of this effort was the Menlo Report (Dittrich,
Kenneally, and others 2011).
Together, the Belmont Report and the Menlo Report offer four principles
that can guide ethical deliberations by researchers: Respect for Persons,
Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest. Applying these
four principles in practice is not always straightforward, and it can require
294
CHAPTER 6

difficult balancing. The principles, however, help clarify trade-offs, suggest
improvements to research designs, and enable researchers to explain their
reasoning to each other and the public.
6.4.1 Respect for Persons
Respect for Persons is about treating people as autonomous and
honoring their wishes.
The Belmont Report argues that the principle of Respect for Persons consists
of two distinct parts: (1) individuals should be treated as autonomous and
(2) individuals with diminished autonomy should be entitled to additional
protections. Autonomy roughly corresponds to letting people control their
own lives. In other words, Respect for Persons suggests that researchers
should not do things to people without their consent. Critically, this holds
even if the researcher thinks that the thing that is happening is harmless, or
even beneficial. Respect for Persons leads to the idea that participants—not
researchers—get to decide.
In practice, the principle of Respect for Persons has been interpreted to
mean that researchers should, if possible, receive informed consent from
participants. The basic idea with informed consent is that participants should
be presented with relevant information in a comprehensible format and then
should voluntarily agree to participate. Each of these terms has itself been the
subject of substantial additional debate and scholarship (Manson and O’Neill
2007), and I’ll devote section 6.6.1 to informed consent.
Applying the principle of Respect for Persons to the three examples from
the beginning of the chapter highlights areas of concern with each of them.
In each case, researchers did things to participants—used their data (Tastes,
Ties, or Time), used their computer to perform a measurement task (Encore),
or enrolled them in an experiment (Emotional Contagion)—without their
consent or awareness. The violation of the principle of Respect for Persons
does not automatically make these studies ethically impermissible; Respect
for Persons is one of four principles. But thinking about Respect for Persons
does suggest some ways in which the studies could be improved ethically.
For example, researchers could have obtained some form of consent from
participants before the study began or after it ended; I’ll return to these
options when I discuss informed consent in section 6.6.1.
ETHICS
295

6.4.2 Beneﬁcence
Beneﬁcence is about understanding and improving the risk/beneﬁt
proﬁle of your study, and then deciding if it strikes the right balance.
The Belmont Report argues that the principle of Beneficence is an obligation
that researchers have to participants, and that it involves two parts: (1) do
not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.
The Belmont Report traces the idea of “do not harm” to the Hippocratic
tradition in medical ethics, and it can be expressed in a strong form where
researchers “should not injure one person regardless of the benefits that
might come to others” (Belmont Report 1979). However, the Belmont Report
also acknowledges that learning what is beneficial may involve exposing
some people to risk. Therefore, the imperative of not doing harm can be
in conflict with the imperative to learn, leading researchers to occasionally
make difficult decisions about “when it is justifiable to seek certain benefits
despite the risks involved, and when the benefits should be foregone because
of the risks” (Belmont Report 1979).
In practice, the principle of Beneficence has been interpreted to mean that
researchers should undertake two separate processes: a risk/benefit analysis
and then a decision about whether the risks and benefits strike an appropriate
ethical balance. This first process is largely a technical matter requiring
substantive expertise, while the second is largely an ethical matter where
substantive expertise may be less valuable, or even detrimental.
A risk/benefit analysis involves both understanding and improving the
risks and benefits of a study. Analysis of risk should include two elements:
the probability of adverse events and the severity of those events. As the
result of a risk/benefit analysis, a researcher could adjust the study design to
reduce the probability of an adverse event (e.g., screen out participants who
are vulnerable) or reduce the severity of an adverse event if it occurs (e.g.,
make counseling available to participants who request it). Further, during
the risk/benefit analysis, researchers need to keep in mind the impact of
their work not just on participants, but also on nonparticipants and social
systems. For example, consider the experiment by Restivo and van de Rijt
(2012) on the effect of awards on Wikipedia editors (discussed in chapter
4). In this experiment, the researchers gave awards to a small number of
editors whom they considered deserving and then tracked their contributions
296
CHAPTER 6

to Wikipedia compared with a control group of equally deserving editors to
whom the researchers did not give an award. Imagine, if, instead of giving
a small number of awards, Restivo and van de Rijt flooded Wikipedia with
many, many awards. Although this design might not harm any individual
participant, it could disrupt the entire award ecosystem in Wikipedia. In
other words, when doing a risk/benefit analysis, you should think about
the impacts of your work not just on participants but on the world
more broadly.
Next, once the risks have been minimized and the benefits maximized,
researchers should assess whether the study strikes a favorable balance.
Ethicists do not recommend a simple summation of costs and benefits. In
particular, some risks render the research impermissible, no matter the ben-
efits (e.g., the Tuskegee Syphilis Study described in the historical appendix).
Unlike the risk/benefit analysis, which is largely technical, this second step is
deeply ethical and may in fact be enriched by people who do not have specific
subject-area expertise. In fact, because outsiders often notice different things
from insiders, IRBs in the United States are required to include at least
one nonresearcher. In my experience serving on an IRB, these outsiders
can be helpful for preventing group-think. So if you are having trouble
deciding whether your research project strikes an appropriate risk/benefit
analysis don’t just ask your colleagues, try asking some nonresearchers—
their answers might surprise you.
Applying the principle of Beneficence to the three examples that we are
considering suggests some changes that might improve their risk/benefit
balance. For example, in Emotional Contagion, the researchers could have
attempted to screen out people under 18 years old and people who might be
especially likely to react badly to the treatment. They could also have tried to
minimize the number of participants by using efficient statistical methods
(as described in detail in chapter 4). Further, they could have attempted
to monitor participants and offered assistance to anyone that appeared
to have been harmed. In Tastes, Ties, and Time, the researchers could
have put extra safeguards in place when they released the data (although
their procedures were approved by Harvard’s IRB, which suggests that they
were consistent with common practice at that time); I’ll offer some more
specific suggestions about data release later when I describe informational
risk (section 6.6.2). Finally, in Encore, the researchers could have attempted
to minimize the number of risky requests that were created in order to
ETHICS
297

achieve the measurement goals of the project, and they could have excluded
participants who are most in danger from repressive governments. Each of
these possible changes would introduce trade-offs into the design of these
projects, and my goal is not to suggest that these researchers should have
made these changes. Rather, it is to show the kinds of changes that the
principle of Beneficence can suggest.
Finally, although the digital age has generally made the weighing of risks
and benefits more complex, it has actually made it easier for researchers to
increase the benefits of their work. In particular, the tools of the digital age
greatly facilitate open and reproducible research, where researchers make
their research data and code available to other researchers and make their
papers available to the public through open access publishing. This change
to open and reproducible research, while by no means simple, offers a way
for researchers to increase the benefits of their research without exposing
participants to any additional risk (data sharing is an exception that will be
discussed in detail in section 6.6.2 on informational risk).
6.4.3 Justice
Justice is about ensuring that the risks and beneﬁts of research are
distributed fairly.
The Belmont Report argues that the principle of Justice addresses the
distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. That is, it should not
be the case that one group in society bears the costs of research while another
group reaps its benefits. For example, in the nineteenth and early twentieth
century, the burdens of serving as research subjects in medical trials fell
largely on the poor, while the benefits of improved medical care flowed
primarily to the rich.
In practice, the principle of Justice was initially interpreted to mean that
vulnerable people should be protected from researchers. In other words,
researchers should not be allowed to intentionally prey on the powerless.
It is a troubling pattern that, in the past, a large number of ethically
problematic studies involved extremely vulnerable participants, including
poorly educated and disenfranchised citizens (Jones 1993); prisoners (Spitz
2005); institutionalized, mentally disabled children (Robinson and Unruh
2008); and old and debilitated hospital patients (Arras 2008).
298
CHAPTER 6

Around 1990, however, views of Justice began to swing from protection
to access (Mastroianni and Kahn 2001). For example, activists argued that
children, women, and ethnic minorities needed to be explicitly included in
clinical trials so that these groups could benefit from the knowledge gained
from these trials (Epstein 2009).
In addition to questions about protection and access, the principle of
Justice is often interpreted to raise questions about appropriate compensa-
tion for participants—questions that are subject to intense debate in medical
ethics (Dickert and Grady 2008).
Applying the principle of Justice to our three examples offers yet another
way to view them. In none of the studies were participants compensated
financially. Encore raises the most complex questions about the principle of
Justice. While the principle of Beneficence might suggest excluding partic-
ipants from countries with repressive governments, the principle of Justice
could argue for allowing these people to participate in—and benefit from—
accurate measurements of Internet censorship. The case of Tastes, Ties, and
Time also raises questions because one group of students bore the burdens
of the research and only society as a whole benefited. Finally, in Emotional
Contagion, the participants who bore the burden of the research were a
random sample from the population most likely to benefit from the results
(namely, Facebook users). In this sense, the design of Emotional Contagion
was well aligned with the principle of Justice.
6.4.4 Respect for Law and Public Interest
Respect for Law and Public Interest extends the principle of
Beneﬁcence beyond speciﬁc research participants to include all
relevant stakeholders.
The fourth and final principle that can guide your thinking is Respect for Law
and Public Interest. This principle comes from the Menlo Report, and there-
fore may be less well known to social researchers. The Menlo Report argues
that the principle of Respect for Law and Public Interest is implicit in the
principle of Beneficence, but it also argues that the former deserves explicit
consideration. In particular, while Beneficence tends to focus on participants,
Respect for Law and Public Interest explicitly encourages researchers to take
a wider view and to include law in their considerations.
ETHICS
299

In the Menlo Report, Respect for Law and Public Interest has two distinct
components: (1) compliance and (2) transparency-based accountability.
Compliance means that researchers should attempt to identify and obey
relevant laws, contracts, and terms of service. For example, compliance
would mean that a researcher considering scraping the content of a website
should read and consider the terms-of-service agreement of that website.
There may, however, be situations where it is permissible to violate the
terms of service; remember, Respect for Law and Public Interest is just one
of four principles. For example, at one time, both Verizon and AT&T had
terms of service that prevented customers from criticizing them (Vaccaro
et al. 2015). I don’t think researchers should not be automatically bound
by such terms-of-service agreements. Ideally, if researchers violate terms-
of-service agreements, they should explain their decision openly (see, e.g.,
Soeller et al. (2016)), as suggested by transparency-based accountability. But
this openness may expose researchers to added legal risk; in the United States,
for example, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act may make it illegal to
violate terms-of-service agreements (Sandvig and Karahalios 2016; Krafft,
Macy, and Pentland 2016). At this brief discussion illustrates, including
compliance in ethical deliberations can raise complex questions.
In addition to compliance, Respect for Law and Public Interest also
encourages transparency-based accountability, which means that researchers
should be clear about their goals, methods, and results at all stages of their
research and take responsibility for their actions. Another way to think
about transparency-based accountability is that it is trying to prevent the
research community from doing things in secret. This transparency-based
accountability enables a broader role for the public in ethical debates, which
is important for both ethical and practical reasons.
Applying the principle of Respect for Law and Public Interest to the
three studies considered here illustrates some of the complexity researchers
face when it comes to law. For example, Grimmelmann (2015) has argued
that Emotional Contagion may have been illegal in the State of Maryland.
In particular, Maryland House Bill 917, passed in 2002, extends Common
Rule protections to all research conducted in Maryland, independent of
funding source (many experts believe that Emotional Contagion was not
subject to the Common Rule under Federal Law because it was conducted
at Facebook, an institution that does not receive research funds from the US
Government). However, some scholars believe that Maryland House Bill 917
300
CHAPTER 6

is itself unconstitutional (Grimmelmann 2015, pp. 237–38). Practicing social
researchers are not judges, and therefore are not equipped to understand and
assess the constitutionality of the laws of all 50 US states. These complexities
are compounded in international projects. Encore, for example, involved
participants from 170 countries, which makes legal compliance incredibly
difficult. In response to the ambiguous legal environment, researchers might
benefit from third-party review of their work, both as a source of advice
about legal requirements and as a personal protection in case their research
is unintentionally illegal.
On the other hand, all three studies published their results in academic
journals, enabling transparency-based accountability. In fact, Emotional
Contagion was published in open access form, so the research community
and the broader public were informed—after the fact—about the design and
results of the research. One quick and crude way to assess transparency-based
accountability is to ask yourself: would I be comfortable if my research pro-
cedures were written about on the front page of my home town newspaper?
If the answer is no, then that is a sign that your research design may need
changes.
In conclusion, the Belmont Report and Menlo Report propose four
principles that can be used to assess research: Respect for Persons, Benef-
icence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest. Applying these
four principles in practice is not always straightforward, and it can require
difficult balancing. For example, with regard to the decision whether to
debrief participants from Emotional Contagion, it might be considered that
Respect for Persons encourages debriefing, whereas Beneficence discourages
it (if the debriefing could itself do harm). There is no automatic way to
balance these competing principles, but the four principles help clarify trade-
offs, suggest changes to research designs, and enable researchers to explain
their reasoning to each other and the public.
6.5
Two ethical frameworks
Most debates about research ethics reduce to disagreements
between consequentialism and deontology.
These four ethical principles of Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Justice,
and Respect for Law and Public Interest are themselves largely derived from
ETHICS
301

two more abstract ethical frameworks: consequentialism and deontology.
Understanding these frameworks is helpful because it will enable you identify
and then reason about one of the most fundamental tensions in research
ethics: using potentially unethical means to achieve ethical ends.
Consequentialism, which has roots in the work of Jeremy Bentham and
John Stuart Mill, focuses on taking actions that lead to better states in
the world (Sinnott-Armstrong 2014). The principle of Beneficence, which
focuses on balancing risk and benefits, is deeply rooted in consequentialist
thinking. On the other hand, deontology, which has roots in the work of
Immanuel Kant, focuses on ethical duties, independent of their consequences
(Alexander and Moore 2015). The principle of Respect for Persons, which
focuses on the autonomy of participants, is deeply rooted in deontological
thinking. A quick and crude way to distinguish the two frameworks is that
deontologists focus on means and consequentialists focus on ends.
To see how these two frameworks operate, consider informed consent.
Both frameworks could be used to support informed consent, but for
different reasons. A consequentialist argument for informed consent is
that it helps to prevent harm to participants by prohibiting research that
does not properly balance risk and anticipated benefit. In other words,
consequentialist thinking would support informed consent because it helps
prevent bad outcomes for participants. However, a deontological argument
for informed consent focuses on a researcher’s duty to respect the autonomy
of her participants. Given these approaches, a pure consequentialist might
be willing to waive the requirement for informed consent in a setting where
there was no risk, whereas a pure deontologist might not.
Both consequentialism and deontology offer important ethical insight,
but each can be taken to absurd extremes. For consequentialism, one of
these extreme cases could be called Transplant. Imagine a doctor who has
five patients dying of organ failure and one healthy patient whose organs
can save all five. Under certain conditions, a consequentialist doctor will
be permitted—and even required—to kill the healthy patient to obtain
his organs. This complete focus on ends, without regard to means, is
flawed.
Likewise, deontology can also be taken to awkward extremes, such as in
the case that could be called Time Bomb. Imagine a police officer who has
captured a terrorist who knows the location of a ticking time bomb that will
kill millions of people. A deontological police officer would not lie in order to
302
CHAPTER 6

trick a terrorist into revealing the location of the bomb. This complete focus
on means, without regards to ends, also is flawed.
In practice, most social researchers implicitly embrace a blend of these
two ethical frameworks. Noticing this blending of ethical schools helps
clarify why many ethical debates—which tend to be between those who are
more consequentialist and those who are more deontological—don’t make
much progress. Consequentialists generally offer arguments about ends—
arguments that are not convincing to deontologists, who are worried about
means. Likewise, deontologists tend to offer arguments about means, which
are not convincing to consequentialists, who are focused on ends. Argu-
ments between consequentialists and deontologists are like two ships passing
in the night.
One solution to these debates would be for social researchers to develop
a consistent, morally solid, and easy-to-apply blend of consequentialism and
deontology. Unfortunately, that’s unlikely to happen; philosophers have been
struggling with these problems for a long time. However, researchers can
use these two ethical frameworks—and the four principles they imply—to
reason about ethical challenges, clarify trade-offs, and suggest improvements
to research designs.
6.6
Areas of difﬁculty
The four ethical principles—Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Justice, and
Respect for Law and Public Interest—and the two ethical frameworks—
consequentialism and deontology—should help you reason about any re-
search ethics problems that you are facing. However, based on the charac-
teristics of digital-age research described earlier in this chapter and based on
the ethical debates we have considered so far, I see four areas of particular
difficulty: informed consent, understanding and managing informational risk,
privacy, and making decisions in the face of uncertainty. In the next sections,
I will describe these four issues in more detail and offer advice about how to
handle them.
6.6.1 Informed consent
Researchers should, can, and do follow the rule: some form of
consent for most research.
ETHICS
303

Informed consent is a foundational idea—some might say a near obses-
sion (Emanuel, Wendler, and Grady 2000; Manson and O’Neill 2007)—
in research ethics. The simplest version of research ethics says: “informed
consent for everything.” This simple rule, however, is not consistent with
existing ethical principles, ethical regulation, or research practice. Instead,
researchers should, can, and do follow a more complex rule: “some form of
consent for most research.”
First, in order to move beyond overly simplistic ideas about informed
consent, I want to tell you more about field experiments to study discrim-
ination. In these studies, fake applicants who have different characteristics—
say, some men and some women—apply for different jobs. If one type
of applicant gets hired more often, then researchers can conclude that
there may be discrimination in the hiring process. For the purposes of
this chapter, the most important thing about these experiments is that the
participants in these experiments—the employers—never provide consent.
In fact, these participants are actively deceived. Yet field experiments to
study discrimination have 117 studies in 17 countries (Riach and Rich 2002;
Rich 2014).
Researchers who use field experiments to study discrimination have
identified four features of these studies that, collectively, make them ethically
permissible: (1) the limited harm to the employers; (2) the great social
benefit of having a reliable measure of discrimination; (3) the weakness of
other methods of measuring discrimination; and (4) the fact that deception
does not strongly violate the norms of that setting (Riach and Rich 2004).
Each of these conditions is critical, and if any of them are not satisfied,
the ethical case will be more challenging. Three of these features can be
derived from the ethical principles in the Belmont Report: limited harm
(Respect for Persons and Beneficence) and great benefit and weakness of
other methods (Beneficence and Justice). The final feature, nonviolation
of contextual norms, can be derived from the Menlo Report’s Respect
for Law and Public Interest. In other words, employment applications
are a setting where there is already some expectation of possible decep-
tion. Thus, these experiments do not pollute an already pristine ethical
landscape.
In addition to this principles-based argument, dozens of IRBs have also
concluded that the lack of consent in these studies is consistent with existing
rules, in particular Common Rule §46.116, part (d). Finally, US courts have
304
CHAPTER 6

also supported the lack of consent and use of deception in field experiments
to measure discrimination (No. 81-3029. United States Court of Appeals,
Seventh Circuit). Thus, the use of field experiments without consent is
consistent with existing ethical principles and existing rules (at least the rules
in the United States). This reasoning has been supported by the broad social
research community, dozens of IRBs, and by the US Court of Appeals. Thus,
we must reject the simple rule “informed consent for everything.” This is not
a rule that researchers follow, nor is it one that they should follow.
Moving beyond “informed consent for everything” leaves researchers with
a difficult question: What forms of consent are needed for what kinds of
research? Naturally, there has been substantial debate around this question,
although most of it is in the context of medical research in the analog age.
Summarizing that debate, Nir Eyal (2012) writes:
“The more risky the intervention, the more it is a high-impact or a
definitive ‘critical life choice,’ the more it is value-laden and contro-
versial, the more private the area of the body that the intervention
directly affects, the more conflicted and unsupervised the practitioner,
the higher the need for robust informed consent. On other occasions,
the need for very robust informed consent, and indeed, for consent of
any form, is lesser. On those occasions, high costs may easily override
that need.” [internal citations excluded]
An important insight from this debate is that informed consent is not all or
nothing: there are stronger and weaker forms of consent. In some situations,
robust informed consent seems necessary, but in others, weaker forms of
consent may be appropriate. Next, I’ll describe three reasons why researchers
might struggle to obtain informed consent, and I’ll describe a few options in
those cases.
First, sometimes asking participants to provide informed consent may
increase the risks that they face. For example, in Encore, asking people living
under repressive governments to provide consent to have their computer
used for measurement of Internet censorship might place those who agree at
increased risk. When consent leads to increased risk, researchers can ensure
that information about what they are doing is public and that it is possible
for participants to opt out. Also, they could seek consent from groups that
represent the participants (e.g., NGOs).
ETHICS
305

Second, sometimes having fully informed consent before the study be-
gins could compromise the scientific value of the study. For example, in
Emotional Contagion, if participants had known that researchers were doing
an experiment about emotions, this might have changed their behavior.
Withholding information from participants, and even deceiving them, is not
uncommon in social research, especially in lab experiments in psychology.
If informed consent is not possible before a study begins, researchers could
(and usually do) debrief participants after the study is over. Debriefing gen-
erally includes explaining what actually happened, remediating any harms,
and obtaining consent after the fact. There is some debate, however, about
whether debriefing in field experiments is appropriate, if the debriefing itself
might harm participants (Finn and Jakobsson 2007).
Third, sometimes it is logistically impractical to obtain informed consent
from everyone impacted by your study. For example, imagine a researcher
who wishes to study the Bitcoin blockchain (Bitcoin is a crypto-currency and
the blockchain is a public record of all Bitcoin transactions (Narayanan et al.
2016)). Unfortunately, it is impossible to obtain consent from everyone who
uses Bitcoin because many of these people are anonymous. In this case, the
researcher could try to contact a sample of Bitcoin users and ask for their
informed consent.
These three reasons why researchers might not be able to obtain in-
formed consent—increasing risk, compromising research goals, and logis-
tical limitations—are not the only reasons why researchers struggle to obtain
informed consent. And the solutions that I’ve suggested—informing the
public about the research, enabling an opt-out, seeking consent from third
parties, debriefing, and seeking consent from a sample of participants—may
not be possible in all cases. Further, even if these alternatives are possible,
they may not be sufficient for the given study. What these examples do show,
however, is that informed consent is not all or nothing, and that creative
solutions can improve the ethical balance of studies that cannot receive full
informed consent from all impacted parties.
To conclude, rather than “informed consent for everything,” researchers
should, can, and do follow a more complex rule: “some form of consent
for most things.” Expressed in terms of principles, informed consent is
neither necessary nor sufficient for the principles of Respect for Persons
(Humphreys 2015, p. 102). Further, Respect for Persons is just one of the
principles that need to be balanced when considering research ethics; it
306
CHAPTER 6

should not automatically overwhelm Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for
Law and Public Interest, a point made repeatedly by ethicists over the past 40
years (Gillon 2015, pp. 112–13). Expressed in terms of ethical frameworks,
informed consent for everything is an overly deontological position that falls
victim to situations such as Time Bomb (see section 6.5).
Finally, as a practical matter, if you are considering doing research without
any kind of consent, then you should know that you are in a gray area. Be
careful. Look back at the ethical argument that researchers have made in
order to conduct experimental studies of discrimination without consent. Is
your justification as strong? Because informed consent is central to many lay
ethical theories, you should know that you will likely be called on to defend
your decisions.
6.6.2 Understanding and managing informational risk
Informational risk is the most common risk in social research; it has
increased dramatically; and it is the hardest risk to understand.
The second ethical challenge for digital-age social research is informa-
tional risk, the potential for harm from the disclosure of information
(National Research Council 2014). Informational harms from the disclo-
sure of personal information could be economic (e.g., losing a job), social
(e.g., embarrassment), psychological (e.g., depression), or even criminal
(e.g., arrest for illegal behavior). Unfortunately, the digital age increases
informational risk dramatically—there is just so much more information
about our behavior. And informational risk has proven very difficult to
understand and manage compared with risks that were concerns in analog-
age social research, such as physical risk.
One
way
that

is
“anonymization” of data. “Anonymization” is the process of removing
obvious personal identifiers such as name, address, and telephone number
from the data. However, this approach is much less effective than many
people realize, and it is, in fact, deeply and fundamentally limited. For that
reason, whenever I describe “anonymization,” I’ll use quotation marks to
remind you that this process creates the appearance of anonymity but not
true anonymity.

“Anonymization”
Figure 6.4: “Anonymization” is the process of removing obviously identifying information.
For example, when releasing the medical insurance records of state employees, the Mas-
sachusetts Group Insurance Commission (GIC) removed names and addresses from the files.
I use the quotation marks around the word “anonymization” because the process provides the
appearance of anonymity but not actual anonymity.
A vivid example of the failure of “anonymization” comes from the late
1990s in Massachusetts (Sweeney 2002). The Group Insurance Commission
(GIC) was a government agency responsible for purchasing health insurance
for all state employees. Through this work, the GIC collected detailed health
records about thousands of state employees. In an effort to spur research,
the GIC decided to release these records to researchers. However, they
did not share all of their data; rather, they “anonymized” these data by
removing information such as names and addresses. However, they left
other information that they thought could be useful for researchers, such
as demographic information (zip code, birth date, ethnicity, and sex) and
medical information (visit data, diagnosis, and procedure) (figure 6.4) (Ohm
2010). Unfortunately, this “anonymization” was not sufficient to protect
the data.
To illustrate the shortcomings of the GIC “anonymization”, Latanya
Sweeney—then a graduate student at MIT—paid $20 to acquire the voting
records from the city of Cambridge, the hometown of Massachusetts gover-
nor William Weld. These voting records included information such as name,
address, zip code, birth date, and gender. The fact that the medical data file
and the voter file shared fields—zip code, birth date, and sex—meant that
Sweeney could link them. Sweeney knew that Weld’s birthday was July 31,
1945, and the voting records included only six people in Cambridge with
that birthday. Further, of those six people, only three were male. And, of

those three men, only one shared Weld’s zip code. Thus, the voting data
showed that anyone in the medical data with Weld’s combination of birth
date, gender, and zip code was William Weld. In essence, these three pieces
of information provided a unique fingerprint to him in the data. Using this
fact, Sweeney was able to locate Weld’s medical records, and, to inform him
of her feat, she mailed him a copy of his records (Ohm 2010).
Sweeney’s work illustrates the basic structure of re-identification
attacks—to adopt a term from the computer security community. In these
attacks, two datasets, neither of which by itself reveals sensitive infor-
mation, are linked, and, through this linkage, sensitive information is
exposed.
In response to Sweeney’s work, and other related work, researchers
now generally remove much more information—all so-called “personally
identifying information” (PII) (Narayanan and Shmatikov 2010)—during
the process of “anonymization.” Further, many researchers now realize that
certain data—such as medical records, financial records, answers to survey
questions about illegal behavior—are probably too sensitive to release even
after “anonymization.” However, the examples that I’m about to give suggest
that social researchers need to change their thinking. As a first step, it is wise
to assume that all data are potentially identifiable and all data are potentially
sensitive. In other words, rather than thinking that informational risk applies
to a small subset of projects, we should assume that it applies—to some
degree—to all projects.
ETHICS
309

Both aspects of this reorientation are illustrated by the Netflix Prize. As
described in chapter 5, Netflix released 100 million movie ratings provided
by almost 500,000 members, and had an open call where people from all
over the world submitted algorithms that could improve Netflix’s ability
to recommend movies. Before releasing the data, Netflix removed any
obvious personally identifying information, such as names. They also went
an extra step and introduced slight perturbations in some of the records
(e.g., changing some ratings from 4 stars to 3 stars). They soon discov-
ered, however, that, despite their efforts, the data were still by no means
anonymous.
Just two weeks after the data were released, Arvind Narayanan and
Vitaly Shmatikov (2008) showed that it was possible to learn about specific
people’s movie preferences. The trick to their re-identification attack was
similar to Sweeney’s: merge together two information sources, one with
potentially sensitive information and no obviously identifying information
and one that contains people’s identities. Each of these data sources may
be individually safe, but when they are combined, the merged dataset can
create informational risk. In the case of the Netflix data, here’s how it could
happen. Imagine that I choose to share my thoughts about action and comedy
movies with my co-workers, but that I prefer not to share my opinion about
religious and political movies. My co-workers could use the information that
I’ve shared with them to find my records in the Netflix data; the information
that I share could be a unique fingerprint just like William Weld’s birth date,
zip code, and sex. Then, if they found my unique fingerprint in the data,
they could learn my ratings about all movies, including movies that I choose
not to share. In addition to this kind of targeted attack focused on a single
person, Narayanan and Shmatikov also showed that it was possible to do a
broad attack—one involving many people—by merging the Netflix data with
personal and movie rating data that some people have chosen to post on the
Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Quite simply, any information that is a
unique fingerprint to a specific person—even their set of movie ratings—can
be used to identify them.
Even though the Netflix data can be re-identified in either a targeted or
broad attack, it still might appear to be low risk. After all, movie ratings
don’t seem very sensitive. While that might be true in general, for some of
the 500,000 people in the dataset, movie ratings might be quite sensitive. In
fact, in response to the re-identification, a closeted lesbian woman joined a
310
CHAPTER 6

class-action suit against Netflix. Here’s how the problem was expressed in
their lawsuit (Singel 2009):
“[M]ovie and rating data contains information of a ... highly personal
and sensitive nature. The member’s movie data exposes a Netflix mem-
ber’s personal interest and/or struggles with various highly personal is-
sues, including sexuality, mental illness, recovery from alcoholism, and
victimization from incest, physical abuse, domestic violence, adultery,
and rape.”
The re-identification of the Netflix Prize data illustrates both that all data
are potentially identifiable and that all data are potentially sensitive. At this
point, you might think that this only applies to data that purport to be
about people. Surprisingly, that is not the case. In response to a Freedom of
Information Law request, the New York City Government released records
of every taxi ride in New York in 2013, including the pickup and drop off
times, locations, and fare amounts (recall from chapter 2 that Farber 2015
used similar data to test important theories in labor economics). These data
about taxi trips might seem benign because they do not seem to provide
information about people, but Anthony Tockar realized that this taxi dataset
actually contained lots of potentially sensitive information about people. To
illustrate, he looked at all trips starting at the Hustler Club—a large strip
club in New York—between midnight and 6 a.m. and then found their drop-
off locations. This search revealed—in essence—a list of addresses of some
people who frequented the Hustler Club (Tockar 2014). It is hard to imagine
that the city government had this in mind when it released the data. In fact,
this same technique could be used to find the home addresses of people who
visit any place in the city—a medical clinic, a government building, or a
religious institution.
These two cases of the Netflix Prize and the New York City taxi data show
that relatively skilled people can fail to correctly estimate the informational
risk in the data that they release—and these cases are by no means unique
(Barbaro and Zeller 2006; Zimmer 2010; Narayanan, Huey, and Felten 2016).
Further, in many such cases, the problematic data are still freely available
online, indicating the difficulty of ever undoing a data release. Collectively,
these examples—as well as research in computer science about privacy—
lead to an important conclusion. Researchers should assume that all data are
potentially identifiable and all data are potentially sensitive.

Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to the facts that all data are
potentially identifiable and that all data are potentially sensitive. However,
one way to reduce informational risk while you are working with data is
to create and follow a data protection plan. This plan will decrease the
chance that your data will leak and will decrease the harm if a leak does
somehow occur. The specifics of data protection plans, such as which form of
encryption to use, will change over time, but the UK Data Services helpfully
organizes the elements of a data protection plan into five categories that they
call the five safes: safe projects, safe people, safe settings, safe data, and safe
outputs (table 6.2) (Desai, Ritchie, and Welpton 2016). None of the five safes
individually provide perfect protection. But together they form a powerful
set of factors that can decrease informational risk.
In addition to protecting your data while you are using them, one step
in the research process where informational risk is particularly salient is
data sharing with other researchers. Data sharing among scientists is a core
value of the scientific endeavor, and it greatly facilitates the advancement of
knowledge. Here’s how the UK House of Commons described the impor-
tance of data sharing (Molloy 2011):
“Access to data is fundamental if researchers are to reproduce, verify
and build on results that are reported in the literature. The presumption
must be that, unless there is a strong reason otherwise, data should be

Risk to participants
Beneﬁt to society
Release and forget
Walled garden
No data sharing
Figure 6.6: Data release strategies can fall along a continuum. Where you should be on this
continuum depends on the specific details of your data, and third-party review may help you
decide the appropriate balance of risk and benefit in your case. The exact shape of this curve
depends on the specifics of the data and research goals (Goroff 2015).
Yet, by sharing your data with another researcher, you may be increasing
informational risk to your participants. Thus, it may seem that data sharing
creates a fundamental tension between the obligation to share data with other
scientists and the obligation to minimize informational risk to participants.
Fortunately, this dilemma is not as severe as it appears. Rather, it is better
to think about data sharing as falling along a continuum, with each point on
that continuum providing a different mix of benefits to society and risk to
participants (figure 6.6).
At one extreme, you can share your data with no one, which minimizes
risk to participants but also minimizes gains to society. At the other extreme,
you can release and forget, where data are “anonymized” and posted for
everyone. Relative to not releasing data, release and forget offers both higher
benefits to society and higher risk to participants. In between these two
extreme cases are a range of hybrids, including what I’ll call a walled garden
approach. Under this approach, data are shared with people who meet certain
criteria and who agree to be bound by certain rules (e.g., oversight from an
IRB and a data protection plan). The walled garden approach provides many
of the benefits of release and forget with less risk. Of course, such an approach
creates many questions—who should have access, under what conditions and
for how long, who should pay to maintain and police the walled garden,
etc.—but these are not insurmountable. In fact, there are already working
ETHICS
313

walled gardens in place that researchers can use right now, such as the data
archive of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research
at the University of Michigan.
So, where should the data from your study be on the continuum of no
sharing, walled garden, and release and forget? This depend on the details of
your data: researchers must balance Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Justice,
and Respect for Law and Public Interest. Viewed from this perspective, data
sharing is not a distinctive ethical conundrum; it is just one of the many
aspects of research in which researchers have to find an appropriate ethical
balance.
Some critics are generally opposed to data sharing because, in my opinion,
they are focused on its risks—which are undoubtedly real—and are ignoring
its benefits. So, in order to encourage focus on both risks and benefits, I’d like
to offer an analogy. Every year, cars are responsible for thousands of deaths,
but we do not attempt to ban driving. In fact, a call to ban driving would be
absurd because driving enables many wonderful things. Rather, society places
restrictions on who can drive (e.g., the need to be a certain age and to have
passed certain tests) and how they can drive (e.g., under the speed limit).
Society also has people tasked with enforcing these rules (e.g., police), and
we punish people who are caught violating them. This same kind of balanced
thinking that society applies to regulating driving can also be applied to data
sharing. That is, rather than making absolutist arguments for or against data
sharing, I think we will make the most progress by focusing on how we can
decrease the risks and increase the benefits from data sharing.
To conclude, informational risk has increased dramatically, and it is very
hard to predict and quantify. Therefore, it is best to assume that all data are
potentially identifiable and potentially sensitive. To decrease informational
risk while doing research, researchers can create and follow a data protection
plan. Further, informational risk does not prevent researchers from sharing
data with other scientists.
6.6.3 Privacy
Privacy is a right to the appropriate ﬂow of information.
A third area where researchers may struggle is privacy. As Lowrance (2012)
put it quite succinctly: “privacy should be respected because people should be
314
CHAPTER 6

respected.” Privacy, however, is a notoriously messy concept (Nissenbaum
2010, chapter 4), and, as such, it is a difficult one to use when trying to make
specific decisions about research.
A common way to think about privacy is with a public/private dichotomy.
By this way of thinking, if information is publicly accessible, then it can
be used by researchers without concerns about violating people’s privacy.
But this approach can run into problems. For example, in November 2007,
Costas Panagopoulos sent letters about an upcoming election to everyone
in three towns. In two towns—Monticello, Iowa and Holland, Michigan—
Panagopoulos promised/threatened to publish a list of people who had
voted in the newspaper. In the other town—Ely, Iowa—Panagopoulos
promised/threatened to publish a list of people who had not voted in the
newspaper. These treatments were designed to induce pride and shame
(Panagopoulos 2010) because these emotions had been found to impact
turnout in earlier studies (Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008). Information
about who votes and who doesn’t is public in the United States; anyone can
access it. So, one could argue that because this voting information is already
public, there is no problem with a researcher publishing it in the newspaper.
On the other hand, something about that argument feels wrong to some
people.
As this example illustrates, the public/private dichotomy is too blunt (boyd
and Crawford 2012; Markham and Buchanan 2012). A better way to think
about privacy—one especially designed to handle issues raised by the digital
age—is the idea of contextual integrity (Nissenbaum 2010). Rather than
considering information as public or private, contextual integrity focuses on
the flow of information. According to Nissenbaum (2010), “a right to privacy
is neither a right to secrecy or a right to control but a right to appropriate flow
of personal information.”
The key concept underlying contextual integrity is context-relative in-
formational norms (Nissenbaum 2010). These are norms that govern the
flow of information in specific settings, and they are determined by three
parameters:
• actors (subject, sender, recipient)
• attributes (types of information)
• transmission principles (constraints under which information flows)
ETHICS
315

Thus, when you as a researcher are deciding whether to use data with-
out permission, it is helpful to ask, “Does this use violate context-relative
informational norms?” Returning to the case of Panagopoulos (2010), in this
case, having an outside researcher publish lists of voters or nonvoters in
the newspaper seems likely to violate informational norms. This is probably
not how people expect information to flow. In fact, Panagopoulos did not
follow through on his promise/threat, because local election officials traced
the letters to him and persuaded him that it was not a good idea (Issenberg
2012, p. 307).
The idea of context-relative informational norms can also help evaluate
the case I discussed at the beginning of the chapter regarding the use of
mobile phone call logs to track mobility during the Ebola outbreak in West
Africa in 2014 (Wesolowski et al. 2014). In this setting, one could imagine
two different situations:
• Situation 1: sending complete call log data [attributes]; to governments
of incomplete legitimacy [actors]; for any possible future use [transmis-
sion principles]
• Situation 2: sending partially anonymized records [attributes]; to re-
spected university researchers [actors]; for use in response to the Ebola
outbreak and subject to the oversight of university ethical boards
[transmission principles]
Even though in both of these situations, call data are flowing out of the
company, the informational norms concerning these two situations are
not the same because of differences between the actors, attributes, and
transmission principles. Focusing on only one of these parameters can lead
to overly simplistic decision-making. In fact, Nissenbaum (2015) emphasizes
that none of these three parameters can be reduced to the others, nor
can any one of them individually define informational norms. This three-
dimensional nature of informational norms explains why past efforts—which
have focused on either attributes or transmission principles—have been
ineffective at capturing common-sense notions of privacy.
One challenge with using the idea of context-relative informational norms
to guide decisions is that researchers might not know them ahead of time
and they are very hard to measure (Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein
2015). Further, even if some research would violate contextual-relative
316
CHAPTER 6

informational norms, that does not automatically mean that the research
should not happen. In fact, chapter 8 of Nissenbaum (2010) is entirely about
“Breaking Rules for Good.” Despite these complications, context-relative
informational norms are still a useful way to reason about questions related
to privacy.
Finally, privacy is an area where I’ve seen misunderstandings between
researchers who prioritize Respect for Persons and those who prioritize
Beneficence. Imagine the case of a public health researcher who, in an effort
to prevent the spread of a novel infectious disease, secretly watched people
taking showers. Researchers focusing on Beneficence would focus on the
benefits to society from this research and might argue that there was no harm
to participants if the researcher did her spying without detection. On the
other hand, researchers who prioritize Respect for Persons would focus on
the fact that the researcher was not treating people with respect and might
argue that harm was created by violating the privacy of participants, even
if the participants were not aware of the spying. In other words, to some,
violating people’s privacy is a harm in and of itself.
In conclusion, when reasoning about privacy, it is helpful to move beyond
the overly simplistic public/private dichotomy and to reason instead about
context-relative informational norms, which are made up of three elements:
actors (subject, sender, recipient), attributes (types of information), and
transmission principles (constraints under which information flows) (Nis-
senbaum 2010). Some researchers evaluate privacy in terms of the harm that
could result from its violation, whereas other researchers view the violation
of privacy as a harm in and of itself. Because notions of privacy in many
digital systems are changing over time, vary from person to person, and vary
from situation to situation (Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein 2015),
privacy is likely to be a source of difficult ethical decisions for researchers for
some time to come.
6.6.4 Making decisions in the face of uncertainty
Uncertainty need not lead to inaction.
The fourth and final area where I expect researchers to struggle is making
decisions in the face of uncertainty. That is, after all the philosophizing and
balancing, research ethics involves making decisions about what to do and
ETHICS
317

what not to do. Unfortunately, these decisions often must be made based on
incomplete information. For example, when designing Encore, researchers
might have wished to know the probability that it would cause someone to be
visited by the police. Or, when designing Emotional Contagion, researchers
might have wished to know the probability that it could trigger depression in
some participants. These probabilities were probably extremely low, but they
were unknown before the research takes place. And, because neither project
publicly tracked information about adverse events, these probabilities are still
not generally known.
Uncertainties are not unique to social research in the digital age. When the
Belmont Report described the systematic assessment of risks and benefits, it
explicitly acknowledged these would be difficult to quantify exactly. These
uncertainties, however, are more severe in the digital age, in part because
we have less experience with this type of research and in part because of the
characteristics of the research itself.
Given these uncertainties, some people seem to advocate for something
like “better safe than sorry,” which is a colloquial version of the Precautionary
Principle. While this approach appears reasonable—perhaps even wise—it
can actually cause harm; it is chilling to research; and it causes people to
take an excessively narrow view of the situation (Sunstein 2005). In order
to understand the problems with the Precautionary Principle, let’s consider
Emotional Contagion. The experiment was planned to involve about 700,000
people, and there was certainly some chance that people in the experiment
would suffer harm. But there was also some chance that the experiment could
yield knowledge that would be beneficial to Facebook users and to society.
Thus, while allowing the experiment was a risk (as has been amply discussed),
preventing the experiment would also have been a risk, because it could
have produced valuable knowledge. Of course, the choice was not between
doing the experiment as it occurred and not doing the experiment; there were
many possible modifications to the design that might have brought it into a
different ethical balance. However, at some point, researchers will have the
choice between doing a study and not doing it, and there are risks in both
action and inaction. It is inappropriate to focus only on the risks of action.
Quite simply, there is no risk-free approach.
Moving beyond the Precautionary Principle, one important way to think
about making decisions given uncertainty is the minimal risk standard.
This standard attempts to benchmark the risk of a particular study against
318
CHAPTER 6

the risks that participants undertake in their daily lives, such as playing
sports and driving cars (Wendler et al. 2005). This approach is valuable
because assessing whether something meets the minimal risk standard is
easier than assessing the actual level of risk. For example, in Emotional
Contagion, before the study began, the researchers could have compared
the emotional content of News Feeds in the experiment with that of other
News Feeds on Facebook. If they had been similar, then the researchers
could have concluded that the experiment met the minimal risk standard
(Meyer 2015). And they could have made this decision even if they didn’t
know the absolute level of risk. The same approach could have been applied
to Encore. Initially, Encore triggered requests to websites that were known
to be sensitive, such as those of banned political groups in countries with
repressive governments. As such, it was not minimal risk for participants
in certain countries. However, the revised version of Encore—which only
triggered requests to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube—was minimal risk
because requests to those sites are triggered during normal web browsing
(Narayanan and Zevenbergen 2015).
A second important idea when making decisions about studies with
unknown risk is power analysis, which allows researchers to calculate the
sample size they will need to reliably detect an effect of a given size (Cohen
1988). If your study might expose participants to risk—even minimal risk—
then the principle of Beneficence suggests that you should impose the
smallest amount of risk needed to achieve your research goals. (Think back
to the Reduce principle in chapter 4.) Even though some researchers have an
obsession with making their studies as big as possible, research ethics suggests
that researchers should make their studies as small as possible. Power analysis
is not new, of course, but there is an important difference between the way
that it was used in the analog age and how it should be used today. In the
analog age, researchers generally did power analysis to make sure that their
study was not too small (i.e., under-powered). Now, however, researchers
should do power analysis to make sure that their study is not too big (i.e.,
over-powered).
The minimal risk standard and power analysis help you reason about and
design studies, but they don’t provide you with any new information about
how participants might feel about your study and what risks they might
experience from participating in it. Another way to deal with uncertainty is
to collect additional information, which leads to ethical-response surveys and
ETHICS
319

staged trials.
In ethical-response surveys, researchers present a brief description of a
proposed research project and then ask two questions:
• (Q1) “If someone you cared about were a candidate participant for
this experiment, would you want that person to be included as a
participant?”: [Yes], [I have no preferences], [No]
• (Q2) “Do you believe that the researchers should be allowed to proceed
with this experiment?”: [Yes], [Yes, but with caution], [I’m not sure],
[No]
Following each question, respondents are provided a space in which they
can explain their answer. Finally, respondents—who could be potential par-
ticipants or people recruited from a microtask labor markets (e.g., Amazon
Mechanical Turk)—answer some basic demographic questions (Schechter
and Bravo-Lillo 2014).
Ethical-response surveys have three features that I find particularly attrac-
tive. First, they happen before a study has been conducted, and therefore they
can prevent problems before the research starts (as opposed to approaches
that monitor for adverse reactions). Second, the respondents in ethical-
response surveys are typically not researchers, and so this helps researchers
see their study from the perspective of the public. Finally, ethical-response
surveys enable researchers to pose multiple versions of a research project
in order to assess the perceived ethical balance of different versions of the
same project. One limitation, however, of ethical-response surveys is that
it is not clear how to decide between different research designs given the
survey results. But, despite these limitations, ethical-response surveys appear
to be helpful; in fact, Schechter and Bravo-Lillo (2014) report abandoning a
planned study in response to concerns raised by participants in an ethical-
response survey.
While ethical-response surveys can be helpful for assessing reactions
to proposed research, they cannot measure the probability or severity of
adverse events. One way that medical researchers deal with uncertainty in
high-risk settings is to perform staged trials—an approach that might be
helpful in some social research. When testing the effectiveness of a new
drug, researchers do not immediately jump to a large randomized clinical
trial. Rather, they run two types of studies first. Initially, in a phase I trial,
320
CHAPTER 6

researchers are particularly focused on finding a safe dose, and these studies
involve a small number of people. Once a safe dose has been determined,
phase II trials assess the efficacy of the drug, that is, its ability to work in
a best-case situation (Singal, Higgins, and Waljee 2014). Only after phase
I and II studies have been completed is a new drug allowed to be assessed
in a large randomized controlled trial. While the exact structure of staged
trials used in the development of new drugs may not be a good fit for social
research, when faced with uncertainty, researchers could run smaller studies
explicitly focused on safety and efficacy. For example, with Encore, you could
imagine the researchers starting with participants in countries with a strong
rule of law.
Together, these four approaches—the minimal risk standard, power anal-
ysis, ethical-response surveys, and staged trials—can help you proceed in
a sensible way, even in the face of uncertainty. Uncertainty need not lead
to inaction.
6.7
Practical tips
In addition to high-minded ethical principles, there are practical
issues in research ethics.
In addition to the ethical principles and frameworks described in this
chapter, I’d also like to offer three practical tips based on my personal
experience conducting, reviewing, and discussing social research in the
digital age: the IRB is a floor, not a ceiling; put yourself in everyone else’s shoes;
and think of research ethics as continuous, not discrete.
6.7.1 The IRB is a ﬂoor, not a ceiling
Many researchers seem to hold contradictory views of the IRB. On the one
hand, they consider it to be a bumbling bureaucracy. Yet, at the same time,
they also consider it to be the final arbitrator of ethical decisions. That
is, many researchers seem to believe that if the IRB approves it, then it
must be OK. If we acknowledge the very real limitations of IRBs as they
currently exist—and there are many of them (Schrag 2010, 2011; Hoonaard
2011; Klitzman 2015; King and Sands 2015; Schneider 2015)—then we as
researchers must take on additional responsibility for the ethics of our
ETHICS
321

research. The IRB is a floor not a ceiling, and this idea has two main
implications.
First, the IRB is a floor means that if you are working at an institution
that requires IRB review, then you should follow those rules. This may seem
obvious, but I’ve noticed that some people seem to want to avoid the IRB.
In fact, if you are working in ethically unsettled areas, the IRB can be a
powerful ally. If you follow their rules, they should stand behind you should
something go wrong with your research (King and Sands 2015). And if you
don’t follow their rules, you could end up out on your own in a very difficult
situation.
Second, the IRB is not a ceiling means that just filling out your forms and
following the rules is not enough. In many situations, you as the researcher
are the one who knows the most about how to act ethically. Ultimately, you
are the researcher, and the ethical responsibility lies with you; it is your name
on the paper.
One way to ensure that you treat the IRB as a floor and not a ceiling is
to include an ethical appendix in your papers. In fact, you could draft your
ethical appendix before your study even begins, in order to force yourself to
think about how you will explain your work to your peers and the public. If
you find yourself uncomfortable while writing your ethical appendix, then
your study might not strike the appropriate ethical balance. In addition to
helping you diagnose your own work, publishing your ethical appendices will
help the research community discuss ethical issues and establish appropriate
norms based on examples from real empirical research. Table 6.3 presents
empirical research papers that I think have good discussions of research
ethics. I don’t agree with every claim by the authors in these discussions, but
they are all examples of researchers acting with integrity in the sense defined
by Carter (1996): in each case, (1) the researchers decide what they think is
right and what is wrong; (2) they act based on what they have decided, even at
personal cost; and (3) they publicly show that they are acting based on their
ethical analysis of the situation.
6.7.2 Put yourself in everyone else’s shoes
Often researchers are so focused on the scientific aims of their work that they
see the world only through that lens. This myopia can lead to bad ethical
judgment. Therefore, when you are thinking about your study, try to imagine

how your participants, other relevant stakeholders, and even a journalist
might react to your study. This perspective taking is different than imaging
how you would feel in each of these positions. Rather, it is trying to imagine
how these other people will feel, a process that is likely to induce empathy
(Batson, Early, and Salvarani 1997). Thinking through your work from these
different perspectives can help you foresee problems and move your work
into better ethical balance.
Further, when imagining your work from the perspective of others, you
should expect that they are likely to fixate on vivid worst-case scenarios.
For example, in response to Emotional Contagion, some critics focused
on the possibility that it might have triggered suicide, a low-probability
but extremely vivid worst-case scenario. Once people’s emotions have been
activated and they focus on worst-case scenarios, they may completely lose
track of the probability of this worst-case event occurring (Sunstein 2002).
The fact that people might respond emotionally, however, does not mean
that you should dismiss them as uninformed, irrational, or stupid. We
ETHICS
323

should all be humble enough to realize that none of us have a perfect view
of ethics.
6.7.3 Think of research ethics as continuous, not discrete
Debate about the ethics of social research in the digital age frequently
happens in binary terms; for example, Emotional Contagion was either
ethical or it was not ethical. This binary thinking polarizes discussion,
hinders efforts to develop shared norms, promotes intellectual laziness,
and absolves researchers whose research is labeled “ethical” from their
responsibility to act more ethically. The most productive conversations that
I’ve seen involving research ethics move beyond this binary thinking to a
continuous notion about research ethics.
A major practical problem with a binary conception of research ethics is
that it polarizes discussion. Calling Emotional Contagion “unethical” lumps
it together with true atrocities in a way that is not helpful. Rather, it is more
helpful and appropriate to talk specifically about the aspects of the study that
you find problematic. Moving away from binary thinking and polarizing
language is not a call for us to use muddled language to hide unethical
behavior. Rather, a continuous notion of ethics will, I think, lead to more
careful and precise language. Further, a continuous notion of research ethics
clarifies that everyone—even researchers who are doing work that is already
considered “ethical”—should strive to create an even better ethical balance in
their work.
A final benefit of a move toward continuous thinking is that it encourages
intellectual humility, which is appropriate in the face of difficult ethical
challenges. The questions of research ethics in the digital age are difficult, and
no single person should be overly confident in her own ability to diagnose the
correct course of action.
6.8
Conclusion
Social research in the digital age raises new ethical issues. But these issues are
not insurmountable. If we, as a community, can develop shared ethical norms
and standards that are supported both by researchers and the public, then we
can harness the capabilities of the digital age in ways that are responsible and
beneficial to society. This chapter represents my attempt to move us in that
324
CHAPTER 6

direction, and I think the key will be for researchers to adopt principles-based
thinking, while continuing to follow appropriate rules.
In section 6.2, I described three digital-age research projects that have
generated ethical debate. Then, in section 6.3, I described what I think is
the fundamental reason for ethical uncertainty in digital-age social research:
rapidly increasing power for researchers to observe and experiment on peo-
ple without their consent or even awareness. These capabilities are changing
faster than our norms, rules, and laws. Next, in section 6.4, I described
four existing principles that can guide your thinking: Respect for Persons,
Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest. Then, in
section 6.5, I summarized two broad ethical frameworks—consequentialism
and deontology—that can help you with one of the deepest challenges that
you might face: when is it appropriate for you to take ethically questionable
means in order to achieve an ethically appropriate end. These principles
and ethical frameworks will enable you to move beyond focusing on what is
permitted by existing regulations and increase your ability to communicate
your reasoning with other researchers and the public.
With that background, in section 6.6, I discussed four areas that are par-
ticularly challenging for digital-age social researchers: informed consent (sec-
tion 6.6.1), understanding and managing informational risk (section 6.6.2),
privacy (section 6.6.3), and making ethical decisions in the face of uncertainty
(section 6.6.4). Finally, in section 6.7, I concluded with three practical tips for
working in an area with unsettled ethics.
In terms of scope, this chapter has focused on the perspective of an
individual researcher seeking generalizable knowledge. As such, it leaves out
important questions about improvements to the system of ethical oversight
of research; questions about regulation of the collection and use of data by
companies; and questions about mass surveillance by governments. These
other questions are obviously complex and difficult, but it is my hope that
some of the ideas from research ethics will be helpful in these other contexts.

the US Public Health Service (PHS) enrolled about 400 black men infected
with syphilis in a study to monitor the effects of the disease. These men were
recruited from the area around Tuskegee, Alabama. From the outset, the
study was nontherapeutic; it was designed to merely document the history of
the disease in black males. The participants were deceived about the nature of
the study—they were told that it was a study of “bad blood”—and they were
offered false and ineffective treatment, even though syphilis is a deadly dis-
ease. As the study progressed, safe and effective treatments for syphilis were
developed, but the researchers actively intervened to prevent the participants
from getting treatment elsewhere. For example, during World War II, the re-
search team secured draft deferments for all men in the study in order to pre-
vent the treatment the men would have received had they entered the Armed
326
CHAPTER 6

Forces. Researchers continued to deceive participants and deny them care
for 40 years.
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study took place against a backdrop of racism and
extreme inequality that was common in the southern part of the United
States at the time. But, over its 40-year history, the study involved dozens of
researchers, both black and white. And, in addition to researchers directly
involved, many more must have read one of the 15 reports of the study
published in the medical literature (Heller 1972). In the mid-1960s—about
30 years after the study began—a PHS employee named Robert Buxtun
began pushing within the PHS to end the study, which he considered
morally outrageous. In response to Buxtun, in 1969, the PHS convened
a panel to do a complete ethical review of the study. Shockingly, the
ethical review panel decided that researchers should continue to withhold
treatment from the infected men. During the deliberations, one member of
the panel even remarked: “You will never have another study like this; take
advantage of it” (Brandt 1978). The all-white panel, which was mostly made
up of doctors, did decide that some form of informed consent should be
obtained. But the panel judged the men themselves incapable of providing
informed consent because of their age and low level of education. The panel
recommended, therefore, that the researchers receive “surrogate informed
consent” from local medical officials. So, even after a full ethical review,
the withholding of care continued. Eventually, Buxtun took the story to a
journalist, and, in 1972, Jean Heller wrote a series of newspaper articles
that exposed the study to the world. It was only after widespread public
outrage that the study was finally ended and care was offered to the men who
had survived.
The victims of this study included not just the 399 men, but also their
families: at least 22 wives, 17 children, and 2 grandchildren with syphilis
may have contracted the disease as a result of the withholding of treatment
(Yoon 1997). Further, the harm caused by the study continued long after it
ended. The study—justifiably—decreased the trust that African Americans
had in the medical community, an erosion in trust that may have led African
Americans to avoid medical care to the detriment of their health (Alsan
and Wanamaker 2016). Further, the lack of trust hindered efforts to treat
HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 90s (Jones 1993, chapter 14).
Although it is hard to imagine research so horrific happening today, I
think there are three important lessons from the Tuskegee Syphilis Study
ETHICS
327

for people conducting social research in the digital age. First, it reminds us
that there are some studies that simply should not happen. Second, it shows
us that research can harm not just participants, but also their families and
entire communities long after the research has been completed. Finally, it
shows that researchers can make terrible ethical decisions. In fact, I think it
should induce some fear in researchers today that so many people involved
in this study made such awful decisions over such a long period of time. And,
unfortunately, Tuskegee is by no means unique; there were several other
examples of problematic social and medical research during this era (Katz,
Capron, and Glass 1972; Emanuel et al. 2008).
In 1974, in response to the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and these other ethical
failures by researchers, the US Congress created the National Commission
for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research
and tasked it to develop ethical guidelines for research involving human
subjects. After four years of meeting at the Belmont Conference Center, the
group produced the Belmont Report, a report that has had a tremendous
impact on both abstract debates in bioethics and the everyday practice of
research.
The Belmont Report has three sections. In the first—Boundaries Between
Practice and Research—the report sets out its purview. In particular, it argues
for a distinction between research, which seeks generalizable knowledge, and
practice, which includes everyday treatment and activities. Further, it argues
that the ethical principles of the Belmont Report apply only to research. It
has been argued that this distinction between research and practice is one
way that the Belmont Report is not well suited to social research in the digital
age (Metcalf and Crawford 2016; boyd 2016).
The second and third parts of the Belmont Report lay out three ethical
principles—Respect for Persons; Beneficence; and Justice—and describe how
these principles can be applied in research practice. These are the principles
that I described in more detail in the main text of this chapter.
The Belmont Report sets broad goals, but it is not a document that can
be easily used to oversee day-to-day activities. Therefore, the US Govern-
ment created a set of regulations that are colloquially called the Common
Rule (their official name is Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46,
Subparts A–D) (Porter and Koski 2008). These regulations describe the
process for reviewing, approving, and overseeing research, and they are
the regulations that Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are tasked with
328
CHAPTER 6

enforcing. To understand the difference between the Belmont Report and
the Common Rule, consider how each discusses informed consent: the
Belmont Report describes the philosophical reasons for informed consent
and broad characteristics that would represent true informed consent, while
the Common Rule lists the eight required and six optional elements of an
informed consent document. By law, the Common Rule governs almost all
research that receives funding from the US Government. Further, many
institutions that receive funding from the US Government typically apply
the Common Rule to all research happening at that institution, regard-
less of the funding source. But the Common Rule does not automati-
cally apply to companies that do not receive research funding from the
US Government.
I think that almost all researchers respect the broad goals of ethical
research as expressed in the Belmont Report, but there is widespread annoy-
ance with the Common Rule and the process of working with IRBs (Schrag
2010, 2011; Hoonaard 2011; Klitzman 2015; King and Sands 2015; Schneider
2015). To be clear, those critical of IRBs are not against ethics. Rather, they
believe that the current system does not strike an appropriate balance or that
it could better achieve its goals through other methods. I, however, will take
these IRBs as given. If you are required to follow the rules of an IRB, then you
should do so. However, I would encourage you to also take a principles-based
approach when considering the ethics of your research.
This background very briefly summarizes how we arrived at the rules-
based system of IRB review in the United States. When considering the
Belmont Report and the Common Rule today, we should remember that they
were created in a different era and were—quite sensibly—responding to the
problems of that era, in particular breaches in medical ethics during and after
World War II (Beauchamp 2011).
In addition to efforts by medical and behavioral scientists to create ethical
codes, there were also smaller and less well-known efforts by computer
scientists. In fact, the first researchers to run into the ethical challenges
created by digital-age research were not social scientists: they were com-
puter scientists, specifically researchers in computer security. During the
1990s and 2000s, computer security researchers conducted a number of
ethically questionable studies that involved things like taking over botnets
and hacking into thousands of computers with weak passwords (Bailey,
Dittrich, and Kenneally 2013; Dittrich, Carpenter, and Karir 2015). In
ETHICS
329

response to these studies, the US Government—specifically the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security—created a blue-ribbon commission to write
a guiding ethical framework for research involving information and com-
munication technologies (ICT). The result of this effort was the Menlo
Report (Dittrich, Kenneally, and others 2011). Although the concerns of
computer security researchers are not exactly the same as those of social
researchers, the Menlo Report provides three important lessons for social
researchers.
First, the Menlo Report reaffirms the three Belmont principles—Respect
for Persons, Beneficence, and Justice—and adds a fourth: Respect for
Law and Public Interest. I described this fourth principle and how it
should be applied to social research in the main text of this chapter
(section 6.4.4).
Second, the Menlo Report calls on researchers to move beyond the narrow
definition of “research involving human subjects” from the Belmont Report
to a more general notion of “research with human-harming potential.” The
limitations of the scope of the Belmont Report are well illustrated by Encore.
The IRBs at Princeton and Georgia Tech ruled that Encore was not “research
involving human subjects,” and therefore was not subject to review under
the Common Rule. However, Encore clearly has human-harming potential;
at its most extreme, Encore could potentially result in innocent people being
jailed by repressive governments. A principles-based approach means that
researchers should not hide behind a narrow, legal definition of “research
involving human subjects,” even if IRBs allow it. Rather, they should adopt a
more general notion of “research with human-harming potential,” and they
should subject all of their own research with human-harming potential to
ethical consideration.
Third, the Menlo Report calls on researchers to expand the stakeholders
that are considered when applying the Belmont principles. As research has
moved from a separate sphere of life to something that is more embedded in
day-to-day activities, ethical considerations must be expanded beyond just
specific research participants to include nonparticipants and the environ-
ment in which the research takes place. In other words, the Menlo Report
calls for researchers to broaden their ethical field of view beyond just their
participants.
This historical appendix has provided a very brief review of research ethics
in the social and medical sciences and in computer science. For a book-length

What to read next
• Introduction (section 6.1)
Research ethics has traditionally also included topics such as scientific fraud and
allocation of credit. These are discussed in greater detail in On Being a Scientist,
by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences and National
Academy of Engineering (2009).
This chapter is heavily influenced by the situation in the United States. For
more on the ethical review procedures in other countries, see chapters 6–9
of Desposato (2016b). For an argument that the biomedical ethical principles
that have influenced this chapter are excessively American, see Holm (1995).
For a further historical review of Institutional Review Boards in the United
States, see Stark (2012). The journal PS: Political Science and Politics held a
professional symposium on the relationship between political scientists and
IRBs; see Martinez-Ebers (2016) for a summary.
The Belmont Report and subsequent regulations in the United States tend to
make a distinction between research and practice. I have not made such a distinc-
tion in this chapter, because I think the ethical principles and frameworks apply
to both settings. For more on this distinction and the problems it introduces,
see Beauchamp and Saghai (2012), Meyer (2015), boyd (2016), and Metcalf and
Crawford (2016).
For more on research oversight at Facebook, see Jackman and Kanerva (2016).
For ideas about research oversight at companies and NGOs, see Calo (2013),
Polonetsky, Tene, and Jerome (2015), and Tene and Polonetsky (2016).
In relation to the use of mobile phone data to help address the 2014 Ebola
outbreak in West Africa (Wesolowski et al. 2014; McDonald 2016), for more
about the privacy risks of mobile phone data, see Mayer, Mutchler, and Mitchell
(2016). For examples of earlier crisis-related research using mobile phone data,
see Bengtsson et al. (2011) and Lu, Bengtsson, and Holme (2012), and for more
on the ethics of crisis-related research, see Crawford and Finn (2015).
• Three examples (section 6.2)
Many people have written about Emotional Contagion. The journal Research
Ethics devoted their entire issue in January 2016 to discussing the experiment;
see Hunter and Evans (2016) for an overview. The Proceedings of the National
Academics of Science published two pieces about the experiment: Kahn, Vayena,
and Mastroianni (2014) and Fiske and Hauser (2014). Other pieces about
the experiment include Puschmann and Bozdag (2014), Meyer (2014, 2015),
ETHICS
331

Grimmelmann (2015), Selinger and Hartzog (2015), Kleinsman and Buckley
(2015), Shaw (2015), and Flick (2015).
• Digital is different (section 6.3)
In terms of mass surveillance, broad overviews are provided in Mayer-
Schönberger (2009) and Marx (2016). For a concrete example of the changing
costs of surveillance, Bankston and Soltani (2013) estimate that tracking a
criminal suspect using mobile phones is about 50 times cheaper than using
physical surveillance. See also Ajunwa, Crawford, and Schultz (2016) for a
discussion of surveillance at work. Bell and Gemmell (2009) provide a more
optimistic perspective on self-surveillance.
In addition to being able to track observable behavior that is public or partially
public (e.g., Tastes, Ties, and Time), researchers can increasingly infer things
that many participants consider to be private. For example, Michal Kosinski
and colleagues (2013) showed that they could infer sensitive information about
people, such as sexual orientation and use of addictive substances, from seem-
ingly ordinary digital trace data (Facebook Likes). This might sound magical,
but the approach Kosinski and colleagues used—which combined digital traces,
surveys, and supervised learning—is actually something that I’ve already told
you about. Recall that in chapter 3, I told you how Joshua Blumenstock and
colleagues (2015) combined survey data with mobile phone data to estimate
poverty in Rwanda. This exact same approach, which can be used to efficiently
measure poverty in a developing country, can also be used for potentially
privacy-violating inferences.
For more on the possible unintended secondary uses of health data, see
O’Doherty et al. (2016). In addition to the potential for unintended secondary
uses, the creation of even an incomplete master database could have a chilling
effect on social and political life if people became unwilling to read certain
materials or discuss certain topics; see Schauer (1978) and Penney (2016).
In situations with overlapping rules, researcher sometimes engage in “regula-
tory shopping” (Grimmelmann 2015; Nickerson and Hyde 2016). In particular,
some researchers who wish to avoid IRB oversight can form partnerships
with researchers who are not covered by IRBs (e.g., people at companies or
NGOs), and have those colleagues collect and de-identify data. Then, the IRB-
covered researcher can analyze this de-identified data without IRB oversight
because the research is no longer considered “human subjects research,” at
least according to some interpretations of current rules. This kind of IRB
evasion is probably not consistent with a principles-based approach to research
ethics.
In 2011, an effort began to update the Common Rule, and this process was
finally completed in 2017 (Jashchik 2017). For more on these efforts to update
the Common Rule, see Evans (2013), National Research Council (2014), Hudson
and Collins (2015), and Metcalf (2016).
332
CHAPTER 6

• Four principles (section 6.4)
The classic principles-based approach to biomedical ethics is that of Beauchamp
and Childress (2012). They propose that four main principles should guide
biomedical ethics: Respect for Autonomy, Nonmaleficence, Beneficence, and
Justice. The principle of nonmaleficence urges one to abstain from causing harm
to other people. This concept is deeply connected to the Hippocratic idea of “Do
not harm.” In research ethics, this principle is often combined with the principle
of Beneficence, but see chapter 5 of Beauchamp and Childress (2012) for more
on the distinction between the two. For a criticism that these principles are overly
American, see Holm (1995). For more on balancing when the principles conflict,
see Gillon (2015).
The four principles in this chapter have also been proposed to guide ethical
oversight for research being done at companies and NGOs (Polonetsky, Tene,
and Jerome 2015) through bodies called “Consumer Subject Review Boards”
(CSRBs) (Calo 2013).
• Respect for Persons (section 6.4.1)
In addition to respecting autonomy, the Belmont Report also acknowledges that
not every human is capable of true self-determination. For example, children,
people suffering from illness, or people living in situations of severely restricted
liberty may not be able to act as fully autonomous individuals, and these people
are therefore subject to extra protection.
Applying the principle of Respect for Persons in the digital age can be
challenging. For example, in digital-age research, it can be difficult to provide
extra protections for people with diminished capability of self-determination
because researchers often know very little about their participants. Further,
informed consent in digital-age social research is a huge challenge. In some cases,
truly informed consent can suffer from the transparency paradox (Nissenbaum
2011), where information and comprehension are in conflict. Roughly, if re-
searchers provide full information about the nature of the data collection, data
analysis, and data security practices, it will be difficult for many participants to
comprehend. But if researchers provide comprehensible information, it may lack
important technical details. In medical research in the analog age—the dominate
setting considered by the Belmont Report—one could imagine a doctor talking
individually with each participant to help resolve the transparency paradox. In
online studies involving thousands or millions of people, such a face-to-face
approach is impossible. A second problem with consent in the digital age is
that in some studies, such as analyses of massive data repositories, it would be
impractical to obtain informed consent from all participants. I discuss these and
other questions about informed consent in more detail in section 6.6.1. Despite
these difficulties, however, we should remember that informed consent is neither
necessary nor sufficient for Respect for Persons.
ETHICS
333

For more on medical research before informed consent, see Miller (2014). For
a book-length treatment of informed consent, see Manson and O’Neill (2007).
See also the suggested readings about informed consent below.
• Beneﬁcence (section 6.4.2)
Harms to context are the harms that research can cause not to specific people but
to social settings. This concept is a bit abstract, but I’ll illustrate it with a classic
example: the Wichita Jury Study (Vaughan 1967; Katz, Capron, and Glass 1972,
chapter 2)—also sometimes called the Chicago Jury Project (Cornwell 2010).
In this study, researchers from the University of Chicago, as part of a larger
study of social aspects of the legal system, secretly recorded six jury deliberations
in Wichita, Kansas. The judges and lawyers in the cases had approved the
recordings, and there was strict oversight of the process. However, the jurors
were unaware that recordings were occurring. Once the study was discovered,
there was public outrage. The Justice Department began an investigation of
the study, and the researchers were called to testify in front of Congress.
Ultimately, Congress passed a new law that makes it illegal to secretly record
jury deliberation.
The concern of critics of the Wichita Jury Study was not the risk of harm
to the participants; rather, it was the risk of harms to the context of jury
deliberation. That is, people thought that if jury members did not believe that
they were having discussions in a safe and protected space, it would be harder
for jury deliberations to proceed in the future. In addition to jury deliberation,
there are other specific social contexts that society provides with extra protec-
tion, such as attorney–client relationships and psychological care (MacCarthy
2015).
The risk of harms to context and the disruption of social systems also arise in
some field experiments in political science (Desposato 2016b). For an example
of a more context-sensitive cost–benefit calculation for a field experiment in
political science, see Zimmerman (2016).
• Justice (section 6.4.3)
Compensation for participants has been discussed in a number of settings related
to digital-age research. Lanier (2014) proposes paying participants for digital
traces that they generate. Bederson and Quinn (2011) discuss payments in online
labor markets. Finally, Desposato (2016a) proposes paying participants in field
experiments. He points out that even if participants cannot be paid directly,
a donation could be made to a group working on their behalf. For example,
in Encore, the researchers could have made a donation to a group working to
support access to the Internet.
334
CHAPTER 6

• Respect for Law and Public Interest (section 6.4.4)
Terms-of-service agreements should have less weight than contracts negotiated
between equal parties and than laws created by legitimate governments. Situ-
ations where researchers have violated terms-of-service agreements in the past
have generally involved using automated queries to audit the behavior of com-
panies (much like field experiments to measure discrimination). For additional
discussions, see Vaccaro et al. (2015) and Bruckman (2016a, b). For an example
of empirical research that discusses terms of service, see Soeller et al. (2016).
For more on the possible legal problems researchers face if they violate terms
of service, see Sandvig and Karahalios (2016). Finally, for a slightly different
approach to the idea of transparency, see Neuhaus and Webmoor (2012).
• Two ethical frameworks (section 6.5)
Obviously, an enormous amount has been written about consequentialism and
deontology. For an example of how these ethical frameworks, and others, can
be used to reason about digital-age research, see Zevenbergen et al. (2015). For
an example of how they can be applied to field experiments in development
economics, see Baele (2013).
• Informed consent (section 6.6.1)
For more on audit studies of discrimination, see Pager (2007) and Riach and
Rich (2004). Not only do these studies not have informed consent, they also
involve deception without debriefing.
Both Desposato (2016a) and Humphreys (2015) offer advice about field
experiments without consent.
Sommers and Miller (2013) review many arguments in favor of not debriefing
participants after deception, and argue that researchers should forgo debriefing
“under a very narrow set of circumstances, namely, in field research in
which debriefing poses considerable practical barriers but researchers
would have no qualms about debriefing if they could. Researchers
should not be permitted to forgo debriefing in order to preserve a naive
participant pool, shield themselves from participant anger, or protect
participants from harm.”
Others argue that, in some situations, if debriefing causes more harm than good,
it should be avoided (Finn and Jakobsson 2007). Debriefing is a case where
some researchers prioritize Respect for Persons over Beneficence, whereas
some researchers do the opposite. One possible solution would be to find
ways to make debriefing a learning experience for the participants. That is,
rather than thinking of debriefing as something that can cause harm, perhaps
debriefing can also be something that benefits participants. For an example of
ETHICS
335

this kind of educational debriefing, see Jagatic et al. (2007). Psychologists have
developed techniques for debriefing (Holmes 1976a, b; Mills 1976; Baumrind
1985; Oczak and Nied´zwie´nska 2007), and some of these may be usefully
applied to digital-age research. Humphreys (2015) offers interesting thoughts
about deferred consent, which is closely related to the debriefing strategy that
I described.
The idea of asking a sample of participants for their consent is related to what
Humphreys (2015) calls inferred consent.
A further idea related to informed consent that has been proposed is to
build a panel of people who agree to be in online experiments (Crawford 2014).
Some have argued that this panel would be a nonrandom sample of people.
But chapter 3 shows that these problems are potentially addressable using
post-stratification. Also, consent to be on the panel could cover a variety of
experiments. In other words, participants might not need to consent to each
experiment individually, a concept called broad consent (Sheehan 2011). For
more on the differences between one-time consent and consent for each study,
as well as a possible hybrid, see Hutton and Henderson (2015).
• Understanding and managing informational risk (section 6.6.2)
Far from unique, the Netflix Prize illustrates an important technical property
of datasets that contain detailed information about people, and thus offers
important lessons about the possibility of “anonymization” of modern social
datasets. Files with many pieces of information about each person are likely to
be sparse, in the sense defined formally in Narayanan and Shmatikov (2008).
That is, for each record, there are no records that are the same, and in fact there
are no records that are very similar: each person is far away from their nearest
neighbor in the dataset. One can imagine that the Netflix data might be sparse
because, with about 20,000 movies on a five-star scale, there are about 620,000
possible values that each person could have (6 because, in addition to 1 to 5
stars, someone might have not rated the movie at all). This number is so large,
it is hard to even comprehend.
Sparsity has two main implications. First, it means that attempting to
“anonymize” the dataset based on random perturbation will likely fail. That is,
even if Netflix were to randomly adjust some of the ratings (which they did),
this would not be sufficient, because the perturbed record is still the closest
possible record to the information that the attacker has. Second, the sparsity
means that re-identification is possible even if the attacker has imperfect or
impartial knowledge. For example, in the Netflix data, let’s imagine the attacker
knows your ratings for two movies and the dates you made those ratings ± 3
days; just that information alone is sufficient to uniquely identify 68% of people
in the Netflix data. If the attacker knows eight movies that you have rated ± 14
days, then even if two of these known ratings are completely wrong, 99% of
records can be uniquely identified in the dataset. In other words, sparsity is
336
CHAPTER 6

a fundamental problem for efforts to “anonymize” data, which is unfortunate
because most modern social datasets are sparse. For more on “anonymization”
of sparse data, see Narayanan and Shmatikov (2008).
Telephone metadata also might appear to be “anonymous” and not sensitive,
but that is not the case. Telephone metadata are identifiable and sensitive
(Mayer, Mutchler, and Mitchell 2016; Landau 2016).
In figure 6.6, I sketched out a trade-off between risk to participants and
benefits to society from data release. For a comparison between restricted
access approaches (e.g., a walled garden) and restricted data approaches (e.g.,
some form of “anonymization”), see Reiter and Kinney (2011). For a proposed
categorization system of risk levels of data, see Sweeney, Crosas, and Bar-Sinai
(2015). For a more a general discussion of data sharing, see Yakowitz (2011).
For more detailed analysis of this trade-off between the risk and utility of
data, see Brickell and Shmatikov (2008), Ohm (2010), Reiter (2012), Wu (2013),
and Goroff (2015). To see this trade-off applied to real data from massively open
online courses (MOOCs), see Daries et al. (2014) and Angiuli, Blitzstein, and
Waldo (2015).
Differential privacy also offers an alternative approach that can combine both
low risk to participants and high benefit to society; see Dwork and Roth (2014)
and Narayanan, Huey, and Felten (2016).
For more on the concept of personally identifying information (PII), which is
central to many of the rules about research ethics, see Narayanan and Shmatikov
(2010) and Schwartz and Solove (2011). For more on all data being potentially
sensitive, see Ohm (2015).
In this section, I’ve portrayed the linkage of different datasets as something
that can lead to informational risk. However, it can also create new opportunities
for research, as argued in Currie (2013).
For more on the five safes, see Desai, Ritchie, and Welpton (2016). For an
example of how outputs can be identifying, see Brownstein, Cassa, and Mandl
(2006), which shows how maps of disease prevalence can be identifying. Dwork
et al. (2017) also consider attacks against aggregate data, such as statistics about
how many individuals have a certain disease.
Questions about data use and data release also raise questions about data
ownership. For more on data ownership, see Evans (2011) and Pentland (2012).
• Privacy (section 6.6.3)
Warren and Brandeis (1890) is a landmark legal article about privacy and is
most associated with the idea that privacy is a right to be left alone. Book-length
treatments of privacy that I would recommend include Solove (2010) and
Nissenbaum (2010).
For a review of empirical research on how people think about privacy, see
Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein (2015). Phelan, Lampe, and Resnick
(2016) propose a dual-system theory—that people sometimes focus on intuitive
ETHICS
337

concerns and sometimes focus on considered concerns—to explain how
people can make apparently contradictory statements about privacy. For more
on the idea of privacy in online settings such as Twitter, see Neuhaus and
Webmoor (2012).
The journal Science published a special section titled “The End of Privacy,”
which addresses the issues of privacy and informational risk from a variety
of different perspectives; for a summary, see Enserink and Chin (2015). Calo
(2011) offers a framework for thinking about the harms that come from privacy
violations. An early example of concerns about privacy at the very beginnings of
the digital age is Packard (1964).
• Making decisions under uncertainty (section 6.6.4)
One challenge when trying to apply the minimal risk standard is that it is not
clear whose daily life is to be used for benchmarking (National Research Council
2014). For example, homeless people have higher levels of discomfort in their
daily lives. But that does not imply that it is ethically permissible to expose
homeless people to higher-risk research. For this reason, there seems to be a
growing consensus that minimal risk should be benchmarked against a general-
population standard, not a specific-population standard. While I generally agree
with the idea of a general-population standard, I think that for large online
platforms such as Facebook, a specific-population standard is reasonable.
Thus, when considering Emotional Contagion, I think that it is reasonable to
benchmark against everyday risk on Facebook. A specific-population standard
in this case is much easier to evaluate and is unlikely to conflict with the
principle of Justice, which seeks to prevent the burdens of research failing
unfairly on disadvantaged groups (e.g., prisoners and orphans).
• Practical tips (section 6.7)
Other scholars have also called for more papers to include ethical appendices
(Schultze and Mason 2012; Kosinski et al. 2015; Partridge and Allman 2016).
King and Sands (2015) also offers practical tips. Zook and colleagues (2017)
offer “ten simple rules for responsible big data research.”

CHAPTER 6

1. [
] In arguing against the Emotional Contagion experiment, Kleinsman and
Buckley (2015) wrote:
“Even if it is true that the risks for the Facebook experiment were low
and even if, in hindsight, the results are judged to be useful, there is an
important principle at stake here that must be upheld. In the same way that
stealing is stealing no matter what amounts are involved, so we all have
a right not to be experimented on without our knowledge and consent,
whatever the nature of the research.”
a) Which of the two ethical frameworks discussed in this chapter—
consequentialism or deontology—is this argument most clearly associated
with?
b) Now, imagine that you wanted to argue against this position. How would
you argue the case to a reporter for the New York Times?
c) How, if at all, would your argument be different if you were discussing this
with a colleague?
2. [
] Maddock, Mason, and Starbird (2015) consider the question of whether
researchers should use tweets that have been deleted. Read their paper to learn
about the background.
a) Analyze this decision from deontological perspective.
b) Analyze the exact same decision from a consequentialist perspective.
c) Which do you find more convincing in this case?
3. [
] In an article on the ethics of field experiments, Humphreys (2015) pro-
posed the following hypothetical experiment to highlight the ethical challenges
of interventions that are done without consent of all impacted parties and that
harms some and helps others:
“Say a researcher is contacted by a set of community organizations that
want to figure out whether placing street lights in slums will reduce
violent crime. In this research the subjects are the criminals: seeking
informed consent of the criminals would likely compromise the research
and it would likely not be forthcoming anyhow (violation of respect for
persons); the criminals will likely bear the costs of the research without
benefiting (violation of justice); and there will be disagreement regarding
the benefits of the research—if it is effective, the criminals in particu-
lar will not value it (producing a difficulty for assessing benevolence).
ETHICS
339

...The special issues here are not just around the subjects however. Here
there are also risks that obtain to non-subjects, if for example criminals
retaliate against the organizations putting the lamps in place. The orga-
nization may be very aware of these risks but be willing to bear them
because they erroneously put faith in the ill-founded expectations of re-

to publish.”
a) Write an email to the community organization offering your ethical
assessment of the experiment as designed? Would you help them do the
experiment as proposed? What factors might impact your decision?
b) Are there some changes that might improve your assessment of the ethics
of this experimental design.

] In the 1970s, 60 men participated in a field experiment that took
place in the men’s bathroom at a university in the midwestern part of the
United States (the researchers don’t name the university) (Middlemist, Knowles,
and Matter 1976). The researchers were interested in how people respond to
violations of their personal space, which Sommer (1969) defined as the “area
with invisible boundaries surrounding a person’s body into which intruders
may not come.” More specifically, the researchers chose to study how a man’s
urination was impacted by the presence of others nearby. After conducting
a purely observational study, the researchers conducted a field experiment.
Participants were forced to use the left-most urinal in a three-urinal bathroom
(the researchers do not explain exactly how this was done). Next, participants
were assigned to one of three levels of interpersonal distance. For some men, a
confederate used a urinal right next to them; for some men, a confederate used a
urinal one space away from them; and for some men, no confederate entered the
bathroom. The researchers measured their outcome variables—delay time and
persistence—by stationing a research assistant inside the toilet stall adjacent to
the participant’s urinal. Here’s how the researchers described the measurement
procedure:
“An observer was stationed in the toilet stall immediately adjacent to the
subjects’ urinal. During pilot tests of these procedures it became clear
that auditory cues could not be used to signal the initiation and cessation
of [urination]. ...Instead, visual cues were used. The observer used a
periscopic prism imbedded in a stack of books lying on the floor of the
toilet stall. An 11-inch (28-cm) space between the floor and the wall of
the toilet stall provided a view, through the periscope, of the user’s lower
torso and made possible direct visual sightings of the stream of urine.
The observer, however, was unable to see a subject’s face. The observer

started two stop watches when a subject stepped up to the urinal, stopped
one when urination began, and stopped the other when urination was
terminated.”
The researchers found that decreased physical distance leads to increased delay
of onset and decreased persistence (figure 6.7).

] In August 2006, about 10 days prior to the primary election, 20,000
people living in Michigan received a mailing that showed their voting behavior
and the voting behavior of their neighbors (figure 6.8). (As discussed in this
chapter, in the United States, state governments keep records of who votes in
each election, and this information is available to the public.) One-piece mailings
typically increase voter turnout by about one percentage point, but this one
increased turnout by 8.1 percentage points, the largest effect seen up to that
point (Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008). The effect was so large that a political
operative named Hal Malchow offered Donald Green $100,000 not to publish
the result of the experiment (presumably so that Malchow could make use of this

Dear Registered Voter:
WHAT IF YOUR NEIGHBORS KNEW WHETHER YOU VOTED?
Why do so many people fail to vote? We’ve been talking about the problem for
years, but it only seems to get worse. This year, we’re taking a new approach. 
We’re sending this mail to you and your neighbors to publicize who does and 
does not vote. 
The chart shows the names of some of your neighbors, showing which have voted in 
the past. After the August 8 election, we intend to mail an updated chart. You and 
your neighbors will all know who voted and who did not. 
DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY — VOTE!

Science Review.
When you carefully inspect the mailer in figure 6.8 you may notice that
the researchers’ names do not appear on it. Rather, the return address is to
Practical Political Consulting. In the acknowledgment to the paper, the authors
explain: “Special thanks go to Mark Grebner of Practical Political Consulting,
who designed and administered the mail program studied here.”
a) Assess the use of this treatment in terms of the four ethical principles
described in this chapter.
b) Assess the treatment in terms of the idea of contextual integrity.
c) What changes, if any, would you recommend to this experiment?
d) Would it impact your answers to the questions above if Mark Grebner
was already sending similar mailings at this time? More generally, how
should researchers think about evaluating existing interventions created
by practitioners?
342
CHAPTER 6

e) Imagine that you decide to try to receive informed consent from people in
the treatment group but not those in the control group. What impact might
this decision have on your ability to understand the cause of a difference
in voting rates between the treatment and control groups?
f) Write an ethical appendix that could appear with this paper when it was
published.
6. [
] This builds on the previous question. Once the 20,000 mailers had been
sent (figure 6.8), as well as 60,000 other potentially less sensitive mailers, there
was a backlash from participants. In fact, Issenberg (2012) (p. 198) reports
that “Grebner [the director of Practical Political Consulting] was never able to
calculate how many people took the trouble to complain by phone, because his
office answering machine filled so quickly that new callers were unable to leave a
message.” In fact, Grebner noted that the backlash could have been even larger if
they had scaled up the treatment. He said to Alan Gerber, one of the researchers,
“Alan if we had spent five hundred thousand dollars and covered the whole state
you and I would be living with Salman Rushdie.” (Issenberg 2012, p. 200)
a) Does this information change your answers to the previous question?
b) What strategies for dealing with decision making in the face of uncertainty
would you recommend for similar studies in the future?
7. [
,
] In practice, most ethical debate occurs about studies where re-
searchers do not have true informed consent from participants (e.g., the three
case studies described in this chapter). However, ethical debate can also arise for
studies that have true informed consent. Design a hypothetical study where you
would have true informed consent from participants, but which you still think
would be unethical. (Hint: If you are struggling, you can try reading Emanuel,
Wendler, and Grady (2000).)
8. [
,
] Researchers often struggle to describe their ethical thinking to each
other and to the general public. After it was discovered that Tastes, Ties, and
Time was re-identified, Jason Kauffman, the leader of the research team, made
a few public comments about the ethics of the project. Read Zimmer (2010) and
then rewrite Kauffman’s comments using the principles and ethical frameworks
that are described in this chapter.

] Banksy is one of the most famous contemporary artists in the United
Kingdom and is known particularly for politically oriented street graffiti
(figure 6.9). His precise identity, however, is a mystery. Banksy has a personal
website, so he could make his identity public if he wanted, but he has chosen not
to. In 2008, the Daily Mail newspaper published an article claiming to identify
ETHICS
343

Banksy’s real name. Then, in 2016, Michelle Hauge, Mark Stevenson, D. Kim
Rossmo and Steven C. Le Comber (2016) attempted to verify this claim using
a Dirichlet process mixture model of geographic profiling. More specifically,
they collected the geographic locations of Banksy’s public graffiti in Bristol and
London. Next, by searching through old newspaper articles and public voting
records, they found past addresses of the named individual, his wife, and his
football (i.e., soccer) team. The author’s summarize the finding of their paper as
follows:
“With no other serious ‘suspects’ [sic] to investigate, it is difficult to
make conclusive statements about Banksy’s identity based on the analysis
presented here, other than saying the peaks of the geoprofiles in both
Bristol and London include addresses known to be associated with [name
redacted].”
Following Metcalf and Crawford (2016), I have decided not to include the name
of the individual when discussing this study.
a) Assess this study using the principles and ethical frameworks in this
chapter.
344
CHAPTER 6

b) Would you have done this study?
c) The authors justify this study in the abstract of their paper with the
following sentence: “More broadly, these results support previous
suggestions that the analysis of minor terrorism-related acts (e.g., graffiti)
could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents
occur, and provides a fascinating example of the application of the model
to a complex, real-world problem.” Does this change your opinion of the
paper? If so, how?
d) The authors included the following ethical note at the end of their
paper: “The authors are aware of, and respectful of, the privacy of
[name redacted] and his relatives and have thus only used data in the
public domain. We have deliberately omitted precise addresses.” Does
this change your opinion of the paper? If so, how? Do you think the
public/private dichotomy makes sense in this case?
10. [
] Metcalf (2016) makes the argument that “publicly available datasets
containing private data are among the most interesting to researchers and most
risky to subjects.”
a) What are two concrete examples that support this claim?
b) In this same article, Metcalf also claims that it is anachronistic to assume
that “any information harm has already been done by a public dataset.”
Give one example of where this could be the case.
11. [
,
] In this chapter, I have proposed a rule of thumb that all data
are potentially identifiable and all data are potentially sensitive. Table 6.5
provides a list of examples of data that have no obviously personally identifying
information but that can still be linked to specific people.
a) Pick two of these examples and describe how the re-identification attack
in both cases has a similar structure.
b) For each of the two examples in part (a), describe how the data could
reveal sensitive information about the people in the dataset.
c) Now pick a third dataset from the table. Write an email to someone
considering releasing it. Explain to them how this data could be potentially
identifiable and potentially sensitive.

] Putting yourself in everyone’s shoes includes your participants and the
general public, not just your peers. This distinction is illustrated in the case of

Dr. Chester M. Southam was a distinguished physician and researcher at the
Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research and an Associate Professor of
Medicine at the Cornell University Medical College. On July 16, 1963, Southam
and two colleagues injected live cancer cells into the bodies of 22 debilitated pa-
tients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in New York. These injections were
part of Southam’s research to understand the immune system of cancer patients.
In earlier research, Southam had found that healthy volunteers were able to
reject injected cancer cells in roughly four to six weeks, whereas it took patients
who already had cancer much longer. Southam wondered whether the delayed
response in the cancer patients was because they had cancer or because they were
elderly and already debilitated. To address these possibilities, Southam decided
to inject live cancer cells into a group of people who were elderly and debilitated
but who did not have cancer. When word of the study spread, triggered in part
by the resignation of three physicians who were asked to participate, some made
comparisons to Nazi concentration camp experiments, but others—based in
part on assurances by Southam—found the research unproblematic. Eventually,
the New York State Board of Regents reviewed the case in order to decide if
Southam should be able to continue to practice medicine. Southam argued in his
defense that he was acting in “the best tradition of responsible clinical practice.”
His defense was based on a number of claims, all of which were supported
by several distinguished experts who testified on his behalf: (1) his research
was of high scientific and social merit; (2) there were no appreciable risks to
participants; a claim based in part of Southam’s 10 years of prior experience with
more than 600 subjects; (3) the level of disclosure should be adjusted according
to the level of risk posed by the researcher; (4) the research was in conformity
with the standard of medical practice at that time. Ultimately, the Regent’s
board found Southam guilty of fraud, deceit, and unprofessional conduct, and
suspended his medical license for one year. Yet, just a few years later, Southam
346
CHAPTER 6

was elected president of the American Association of Cancer Researchers.
a) Assess Southam’s study using the four principles in this chapter.
b) It appears that Southam took the perspective of his colleagues and
correctly anticipated how they might respond to his work; in fact, many of
them testified on his behalf. But he was unable or unwilling to understand
how his research might be troubling to the public. What role do you think
public opinion—which could be distinct from the opinions of participants
or peers—should have in research ethics? What should happen if popular
opinion and peer opinion differ?

] In a paper titled “Crowdseeding in Eastern Congo: Using Cell Phones

uncertainty about possible harms to participants.
14. [
] In October 2014, three political scientists sent mailers to 102,780
registered voters in Montana—roughly 15% of registered voters in the state
(Willis 2014)—as part of an experiment to measure whether voters who are
given more information are more likely to vote. The mailers—which were
labeled “2014 Montana General Election Voter Information Guide”—placed
Montana Supreme Court Justice candidates, in what is a nonpartisan election,
on a scale from liberal to conservative, which included Barack Obama and Mitt
Romney as comparisons. The mailer also included a reproduction of the Great
Seal of the State of Montana (figure 6.10).
The mailers generated complaints from Montana voters, and they caused
Linda McCulloch, Montana’s Secretary of State, to file a formal complaint
with the Montana state government. The universities that employed the
researchers—Dartmouth and Stanford—sent a letter to everyone who had
received the mailer, apologizing for any potential confusion and making
clear that the mailer “was not affiliated with any political party, candidate
or organization, and was not intended to influence any race.” The letter also
clarified that the ranking “relied upon public information about who had
donated to each of the campaigns” (figure 6.11).
In May 2015, the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana,
Jonathan Motl, determined that the researchers had violated Montana law: “The
Commissioner determines that there are sufficient facts to show that Stanford,
Dartmouth and/or its researchers violated Montana campaign practice laws
requiring registration, reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures”
(Sufficient Finding Number 3 in Motl (2015)). The Commissioner also
recommended that the County Attorney investigate whether the unauthorized
use of the Great Seal of Montana violated Montana state law (Motl 2015).

Figure 6.10: Mailer sent by three political scientists to 102,780 registered voters in Montana

(Willis 2014). Reproduced from Motl (2015).
Stanford and Dartmouth disagreed
with Motl’s
ruling.
A Stanford
spokeswoman named Lisa Lapin said “Stanford ...does not believe any
election laws were violated” and that the mailing “did not contain any advocacy
supporting or opposing any candidate.” She pointed out that the mailer
explicitly stated that it “is nonpartisan and does not endorse any candidate or
party” (Richman 2015).
a) Assess this study using the four principles and two frameworks described
in this chapter.
b) Assuming that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters (but
more on this in a moment), under what conditions might this mailing
have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?
c) In fact, the mailers were not sent to a random sample of voters. According
to a report by Jeremy Johnson (a political scientists who assisted in
the investigation), mailers “were sent to 64,265 voters identified as
likely liberal to centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts and
39,515 voters identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning
precincts. The researchers justified the disparity between Democratic
and Republican numbers on grounds that they anticipated turnout to
be significantly lower among Democratic voters.” Does this change your
assessment of the research design? If so, how?

of the research? If so, how?

actual Montana study. The mailer used in Montana was never submitted
to the IRB. The study was never submitted to the Stanford IRB. Does this
change your assessment of the research? If so, how?
g) It also turned out that the researchers had sent similar election materials
to 143,000 voters in California and 66,000 in New Hampshire. As far as I
know, there were no formal complaints triggered by these approximately
200,000 additional mailers. Does this change your assessment of the
research? If so, how?
h) What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the
principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you
were interested in exploring whether additional information increases
voter turnout in nonpartisan races?

] On May 8, 2016, two researchers—Emil Kirkegaard and Julius
Bjerrekaer—scraped information from the online dating site OkCupid and
publicly released a dataset of about 70,000 users, including variables such as
username, age, gender, location, religion-related opinions, astrology-related
opinions, dating interests, number of photos, etc., as well as answers given to
the top 2,600 questions on the site. In a draft paper accompanying the released
350
CHAPTER 6

data, the authors stated that “Some may object to the ethics of gathering and
releasing this data. However, all the data found in the dataset are or were
already publicly available, so releasing this dataset merely presents it in a more
useful form.”
In response to the data release, one of the authors was asked on Twitter: “This
dataset is highly re-identifiable. Even includes usernames? Was any work at all
done to anonymize it?” His response was “No. Data is already public.” (Zimmer
2016; Resnick 2016)
a) Assess this data release using the principles and ethical frameworks dis-
cussed in this chapter.
b) Would you use these data for your own research?
c) What if you scraped them yourself?
16. [
] In 2010, an intelligence analyst with the US Army gave 250,000 classified
diplomatic cables to the organization WikiLeaks, and they were subsequently
posted online. Gill and Spirling (2015) argue that “the WikiLeaks disclosure
potentially represents a trove of data that might be tapped to test subtle theories
in international relations” and then statistically characterize the sample of
leaked documents. For example, the authors estimate that they represent about
5% of all diplomatic cables during that time period, but that this proportion
varies from embassy to embassy (see figure 1 of their paper).
a) Read the paper, and then write an ethical appendix to it.
b) The authors did not analyze the content of any of the leaked documents.
Is there any project using these cables that you would conduct? Is there
any project using these cables that you would not conduct?

] In order to study how companies respond to complaints, a researcher
sent fake complaint letters to 240 high-end restaurants in New York City. Here’s
an excerpt from the fictitious letter.
“I am writing this letter to you because I am outraged about a recent
experience I had at your restaurant. Not long ago, my wife and I celebrated
our first anniversary. ... The evening became soured when the symptoms
began to appear about four hours after eating. Extended nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and abdominal cramps all pointed to one thing: food poisoning.
It makes me furious just thinking that our special romantic evening
became reduced to my wife watching me curl up in a fetal position
on the tiled floor of our bathroom in between rounds of throwing up.
ETHICS
351

... Although it is not my intention to file any reports with the Better
Business Bureau or the Department of Health, I want you, [name of the
restaurateur], to understand what I went through in anticipation that you
will respond accordingly.”
a) Evaluate this study using the principles and ethical frameworks described
in this chapter. Given your assessment, would you do the study?
b) Here’s how the restaurants who received the letter reacted (Kifner 2001):
“It was culinary chaos as owners, managers and chefs searched
through computers for [name redacted] reservations or credit card
records, reviewed menus and produce deliveries for possibly spoiled
food, and questioned kitchen workers about possible lapses, all
spurred by what both the university and the professor now concede
was the business school study from hell.”
Does this information change how you assess the study?
c) As far as I know, this study was not reviewed by an IRB or any other third
party. Does that change how you assess the study? Why or why not?
18. [
] Building on the previous question, I’d like you to compare this study
with a completely different study that also involved restaurants. In this other
study, Neumark and colleagues (1996) sent two male and two female college
students with fabricated resumes to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses
at 65 restaurants in Philadelphia, in order to investigate sex discrimination in
restaurant hiring. The 130 applications led to 54 interviews and 39 job offers.
The study found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against
women in high-price restaurants.
a) Write an ethical appendix for this study.
b) Do you think this study is ethically different from the one described in the
previous question. If so, how?
19. [
,
] Some time around 2010, 6,548 professors in the United States
received emails similar to this one.
“Dear Professor Salganik,
I am writing you because I am a prospective Ph.D. student with
considerable interest in your research. My plan is to apply to
352
CHAPTER 6

Ph.D. programs this coming fall, and I am eager to learn as much
as I can about research opportunities in the meantime.
I will be on campus today, and although I know it is short notice,
I was wondering if you might have 10 minutes when you would be
willing to meet with me to briefly talk about your work and any possible
opportunities for me to get involved in your research. Any time that
would be convenient for you would be fine with me, as meeting with you
is my first priority during this campus visit.
Thank you in advance for your consideration.
Sincerely, Carlos Lopez”
These emails were fake; they were part of a field experiment to measure whether
professors were more likely to respond to the email depending on (1) the
time-frame (today versus next week) and (2) the name of the sender, which
was varied to signal ethnicity and gender (Carlos Lopez, Meredith Roberts,
Raj Singh, etc.). The researchers found that when the requests were to meet in
one week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members about 25%
more often than were women and minorities. But when the fictitious students
requested meetings that same day, these patterns were essentially eliminated
(Milkman, Akinola, and Chugh 2012).
a) Assess this experiment according to the principles and frameworks in this
chapter.
b) After the study was over, the researchers sent the following debriefing
email to all participants.
“Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10
minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of
the email appears below). We are emailing you today to debrief you
on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study.
We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and
we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced. Our hope is that this
letter will provide a sufficient explanation of the purpose and design
of our study to alleviate any concerns you may have about your
involvement. We want to thank you for your time and for reading
further if you are interested in understanding why you received
this message. We hope you will see the value of the knowledge we
anticipate producing with this large academic study.”
ETHICS
353

After explaining the purpose and design of the study, they further noted
that:
“As soon as the results of our research are available, we will post
them on our websites. Please rest assured that no identifiable data
will ever be reported from this study, and our between subject design
ensures that we will only be able to identify email responsiveness
patterns in aggregate—not at the individual level. No individual
or university will be identifiable in any of the research or data
we publish. Of course, any one individual email response is not
meaningful as there are multiple reasons why an individual faculty
member might accept or decline a meeting request. All data has
already been de-identified and the identifiable email responses
have already been deleted from our databases and related server.
In addition, during the time when the data was identifiable, it
was protected with strong and secure passwords. And as is always
the case when academics conduct research involving human
subjects, our research protocols were approved by our universities’
Institutional Review Boards (the Columbia University Morningside
IRB and the University of Pennsylvania IRB).
If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject,
you may contact the Columbia University Morningside Institutional
Review Board at [redacted] or by email at [redacted] and/or the
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board at [redacted].
Thank you again for your time and understanding of the work we

c) What are the arguments for debriefing in this case? What are the
arguments against? Do you think that the researchers should have
debriefed the participants in this case?
d) In the supporting online materials, the researchers have a section titled
“Human Subjects Protections.” Read this section. Is there anything that
you would add or remove?
e) What was the cost of this experiment to the researchers? What was the
cost of this experiment to participants? Andrew Gelman (2010) has argued
that participants in this study could have been compensated for their time
after the experiment was over. Do you agree? Try to make your argument
using the principles and ethical frameworks in this chapter.

CHAPTER 7
THE FUTURE
7.1
Looking forward
As I said in chapter 1, social researchers are in the process of making a
transition like that from photography to cinematography. In this book, we’ve
seen how researchers have started using the capabilities of the digital age
to observe behavior (chapter 2), ask questions (chapter 3), run experiments
(chapter 4), and collaborate (chapter 5) in ways that were simply impossible
in the recent past. Researchers who take advantage of these opportunities
will also have to confront difficult, ambiguous ethical decisions (chapter 6).
In this last chapter, I’d like to highlight three themes that run through these
chapters and that will be important for the future of social research.
7.2
Themes of the future
7.2.1 The blending of readymades and custommades
Neither a pure readymade strategy nor a pure custommade strategy
fully utilizes the capabilities of the digital age. In the future, we are
going to create hybrids.
In the introduction, I contrasted the readymade style of Marcel Duchamp
with the custommade style of Michelangelo. This contrast also captures a
difference between data scientists, who tend to work with readymades, and
social scientists, who tend to work with custommades. In the future, however,
I expect that we will see more hybrids because each of these pure approaches
is limited. Researchers who want to use only readymades are going to struggle
because there are not many beautiful readymades in the world. Researchers
who want to use only custommades, on the other hand, are going to sacrifice
355

scale. Hybrid approaches, however, can combine the scale that comes with
readymades with the tight fit between question and data that comes from
custommades.
We saw examples of these hybrids in each of the four empirical chapters.
In chapter 2, we saw how Google Flu Trends combined an always-on big data
system (search queries) with a probability-based traditional measurement
system (the CDC influenza surveillance system) to produce faster estimates
(Ginsberg et al. 2009). In chapter 3, we saw how Stephen Ansolabehere
and Eitan Hersh (2012) combined custom-made survey data with ready-
made government administrative data in order to learn more about the
characteristics of the people who actually vote. In chapter 4, we saw how
the Opower experiments combined the readymade electricity measurement
infrastructure with a custommade treatment to study the effects of social
norms on the behavior of millions of people (Allcott 2015). Finally, in chapter
5, we saw how Kenneth Benoit and colleagues (2016) applied a custommade
crowd-coding process to a readymade set of manifestos created by political
parties in order to create data that researchers can use to study the dynamics
of policy debates.
These four examples all show that a powerful strategy in the future will be
to enrich big data sources, which are not created for research, with additional
information that makes them more suitable for research (Groves 2011).
Whether it starts with the custommade or the readymade, this hybrid style
holds great promise for many research problems.
7.2.2 Participant-centered data collection
Data collection approaches of the past, which are researcher-
centered, are not going to work as well in the digital age. In the
future, we will take a participant-centered approach.
If you want to collect data in the digital age, you need to realize that you
are competing for people’s time and attention. The time and attention of
your participants is incredibly valuable to you; it is the raw material of your
research. Many social scientists are accustomed to designing research for
relatively captive populations, such as undergraduates in campus labs. In
these settings, the needs of the researcher dominate, and the enjoyment of
participants is not a high priority. In digital-age research, this approach is
356
CHAPTER 7

not sustainable. Participants are often physically distant from researchers,
and the interaction between the two is often mediated by a computer. This
setting means that researchers are competing for participants’ attention
and therefore must create a more enjoyable participant experience. That
is why in each chapter that involved interacting with participants, we
saw examples of studies that took a participant-centered approach to data
collection.
For example, in chapter 3, we saw how Sharad Goel, Winter Mason, and
Duncan Watts (2010) created a game called Friendsense that was actually
a clever frame around an attitude survey. In chapter 4, we saw how you
can create zero variable cost data by designing experiments that people
actually want to be in, such as the music downloading experiment that I
created with Peter Dodds and Duncan Watts (Salganik, Dodds, and Watts
2006). Finally, in chapter 5, we saw how Kevin Schawinski, Chris Lintott,
and the Galaxy Zoo team created a mass collaboration that motivated
more than 100,000 people to participate in an astronomical (in both senses
of the word) image labeling task (Lintott et al. 2011). In each of these
cases, researchers focused on creating a good experience for participants,
and in each case, this participant-centered approach enabled new kinds
of research.
I expect that in the future, researchers will continue to develop approaches
to data collection that strive to create a good user experience. Remember
that in the digital age, your participants are one click away from a video of a
skateboarding dog.
7.2.3 Ethics in research design
Ethics will move from a peripheral concern to a central concern and
therefore will become a topic of research.
In the digital age, ethics will become an increasingly central issue shaping
research. That is, in the future, we will struggle less with what can be done
and more with what should be done. As that happens, I expect that the
rules-based approach of social scientists and the ad hoc approach of data
scientists will evolve toward something like the principles-based approached
described in chapter 6. I also expect that as ethics becomes increasingly
central it will grow as a topic of methodological research. In much the same
THE FUTURE
357

way that social researchers now devote time and energy to developing new
methods that enable cheaper and more accurate estimates, I expect that
we will also work to develop methods that are more ethically responsible.
This change will happen not just because researchers care about ethics as
an end, but also because they care about ethics as a means to conducting
social research.
An example of this trend is the research on differential privacy (Dwork
2008). Imagine that, for example, a hospital has detailed health records and
that researchers want to understand the patterns in these data. Differentially
private algorithms enable researchers to learn about aggregate patterns (e.g.,
people who smoke are more likely to have cancer) while minimizing the risk
of learning anything about the characteristics of any particular individual.
The development of these privacy-preserving algorithms has become an
active area of research; see Dwork and Roth (2014) for a book-length
treatment. Differential privacy is an example of the research community
taking an ethical challenge, turning it into a research project, and then
making progress on it. This is a pattern that I think we will increasingly see
in other areas of social research.
As the power of researchers, often in collaboration with companies and
governments, continues to grow, it will become increasingly difficult to avoid
complex ethical issues. It has been my experience that many social scientists
and data scientists view these ethical issues as a swamp to be avoided. But I
think that avoidance will become increasingly untenable as a strategy. We, as
a community, can address these problems if we jump in and tackle them with
the creativity and effort that we apply to other research problems.
7.3
Back to the beginning
The future of social research will be a combination of social science
and data science.
At the end of our journey, let’s return to the study described on the very
first page of the first chapter of this book. Joshua Blumenstock, Gabriel
Cadamuro, and Robert On (2015) combined detailed phone call data from
about 1.5 million people with survey data from about 1,000 people in order
to estimate the geographic distribution of wealth in Rwanda. Their estimates
were similar to those from the Demographic and Health Survey, the gold
358
CHAPTER 7

standard of surveys in developing countries, but their method was about
10 times faster and 50 times cheaper. These dramatically faster and cheaper
estimates are not an end in themselves, they are a means to end, creating new
possibilities for researchers, governments, and companies. At the beginning
of the book, I described this study as a window into the future of social
research, and now I hope you see why.

Many students over the years have shaped the ideas in this book. I
would especially like to thank the students in Sociology 503 (Techniques and
Methods of Social Science) in Spring 2016 for reading an early version of
the manuscript, and the students in Sociology 596 (Computational Social
Science) in Fall 2017 for pilot testing a complete draft of this manuscript
in a classroom setting.
Another source of wonderful feedback was my book manuscript workshop
that was organized by Princeton’s Center for the Study of Democratic Poli-
tics. I would like to thank Marcus Prior and Michele Epstein for supporting
the workshop. And I would like to thank all of the participants who took
time from their busy lives to help me improve the book: Elizabeth Bruch,
Paul DiMaggio, Filiz Garip, Meagan Levinson, Karen Levy, Mor Naaman,
Sean Taylor, Markus Prior, Jess Metcalf, Brandon Stewart, Duncan Watts,
and Han Zhang. It really was a wonderful day—one of the most exciting and
362
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

rewarding of my entire career—and I hope that I’ve been able to channel
some of wisdom from that room into the final manuscript.
A few other people deserve special thanks. Duncan Watts was my disser-
tation adviser, and it was my dissertation that got me excited about social
research in the digital age; without the experience that I had in graduate
school this book would not exist. Paul DiMaggio was the first person to
encourage me to write this book. It all happened one afternoon while we were
both waiting for the coffee machine in Wallace Hall, and I still remember
that, up until that time, the idea of writing a book had never even crossed my
mind. I am deeply grateful to him for convincing me that I had something to
say. I’d also like to thank Karen Levy for reading nearly all of the chapters in
their earliest and messiest forms; she helped me see the big picture when I was
stuck in the weeds. I’d like to thank Arvind Narayanan for helping me focus
and refine the arguments in the book over many wonderful lunches. Brandon
Stewart was always happy to chat or look at chapters, and his insights and
encouragement kept me moving forward, even when I was starting to drift
sideways. And, finally, I would like to thank Marissa King for helping me
come up with the title to this book one sunny afternoon in New Haven.
While writing this book, I benefited from the support of three amazing
institutions: Princeton University, Microsoft Research, and Cornell Tech.
First, at Princeton University, I’m grateful to my colleagues and students
in the Department of Sociology for creating and maintaining a warm and
supportive culture. I would also like to thank the Center for Information
Technology Policy for providing me with a wonderful intellectual second
home where I could learn more about how computer scientists see the
world. Portions of this book were written while I was on sabbatical from
Princeton, and during those leaves I was lucky enough to spend time in
two fantastic intellectual communities. First, I would like to thank Microsoft
Research New York City for being my home in 2013–14. Jennifer Chayes,
David Pennock, and the entire computational social science group were
wonderful hosts and colleagues. Second, I would like to thank Cornell
Tech for being my home in 2015–16. Dan Huttenlocher, Mor Naaman,
and everyone in the Social Technologies Lab helped make Cornell Tech the
ideal environment for me to finish this book. In many ways, this book is
about combining ideas from data science and social science, and Microsoft
Research and Cornell Tech are models of this kind of intellectual cross-
pollination.

While writing this book, I had excellent research assistance. I am grateful
to Han Zhang, especially for his help making the graphs in this book. I am
also grateful to Yo-Yo Chen, especially for her help drafting the activities in
this book. Finally, I am grateful to Judie Miller and Kristen Matlofsky for
assistance of all kinds.
The web version of this book was created by Luke Baker, Paul Yuen, and
Alan Ritari of the Agathon Group. Working with them on this project was a
pleasure, as always. I would especially like to thank Luke for also developing
the build process for this book and helping me navigate the dark corners of
Git, pandoc, and Make.
I would like to thank the contributors to the following open source
projects that we used: Git, pandoc, pandoc-crossref, pandoc-citeproc,
pandoc-citeproc-preamble, Hypothesis, Middleman, Bootstrap, Nokogiri,
GNU Make, Vagrant, Ansible, LaTeX, and Zotero. All graphs in this book
were created in R (R Core Team, 2016) and used the following packages:
ggplot2 (Wickham 2009), dplyr (Wickham and Francois 2015), reshape2
(Wickham 2007), stringr (Wickham 2015), car (Fox and Weisberg 2011),
cowplot (Wilke 2016), png (Urbanek 2013), grid (R Core Team, 2016), and
ggrepel (Slowikowski 2016). I would also like to thank Kieran Healy for his
blog post that got me started with pandoc.
I would like to thank Arnout van de Rijt and David Rothschild for
providing data used to recreate some of the graphs from their papers and
Josh Blumenstock and Raj Chetty for making public replication files for their
paper.
At Princeton University Press, I would like to thank Eric Schwartz who
believed in this project at the beginning, and Meagan Levinson who helped
make it a reality. Meagan was the best editor that a writer could have; she
was always there to support this project, in good times and in bad times.
I’m particularly grateful for how her support has evolved as the project has
changed. Al Bertrand did a great job stepping in during Meagan’s leave, and
Samantha Nader and Kathleen Cioffi helped turn turn this manuscript into a
real book.
Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family. You have been
supportive of this project in so many ways, often in ways that you did not
even know. I would especially like to thank my parents, Laura and Bill, and
my parents-in-law, Jim and Cheryl, for their understanding while this project
went on and on and on. I would also like to thank my kids. Eli and Theo,

you have asked me so many times when my book will finally be finished.
Well, it is finally finished. And, most importantly, I want to thank my wife
Amanda. I’m sure that you too have wondered when this book would finally
be finished, but you never showed it. Over the years that I’ve worked on
this book, I’ve been absent too much, both physically and mentally. I am so
appreciative of your never-ending support and love.
