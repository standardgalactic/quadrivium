Split and Join
●
split() is a string method that having a delimiter or separator, which is by default a 
whitespace or a tab, returns a new list of the words in the string using the delimiter 
passed in as argument. We use split() to convert a string to a list. 
>>> languages = 'Python Go Java Ruby C++ PHP'
>>> languages.split()
['Python', 'Go', 'Java', 'Ruby', 'C++', 'PHP']
●
join() is another string method that concatenates the elements of a list that is passed in 
as argument into a string. It returns a new string.
The string that is used to call join() on, will be put in between every item in the list.
We use split() to convert a list to a string. 
>>> lang_list = ['Python', 'Go', 'Java', 'Ruby', 'C++', 'PHP']
>>> ':'.join(lang_list)
'Python:Go:Java:Ruby:C++:PHP'
