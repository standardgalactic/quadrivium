Preface
Preface
Hydrology is a branch of scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the occurrence, distribution, 
movement, and properties of the waters of the earth. A knowledge of hydrology is fundamental to water 
and environmental professionals (engineers, scientists and decision makers) in such tasks as the design 
and operation of water resources, wastewater treatment, irrigation, flood defence, navigation, pollution 
control, hydropower, ecosystem modelling, etc. This is an introductory book on hydrology and written 
for undergraduate students in civil and environmental engineering, environmental science and geography. 
The aim of this book is to provide a concise coverage of key contents in hydrology that is easy to access 
through the Internet.
The book covers the fundamental theories on hydrological cycle (water balance, atmospheric water, 
subsurface water, surface water), precipitation analysis, evaporation and evapotranspiration processes, 
infiltration, ground water movement, hydrograph analysis, rainfall runoff modelling (unit hydrograph), 
hydrological flow routing, measurements and data collection, hydrological statistics and hydrological 
design. The text has been written in a concise format that is integrated with the relevant graphics. There 
are many examples to further explain the theories introduced. The questions at the end of each chapter 
are accompanied by the corresponding answers and full solutions. A list of recommended reading 
resources is provided in the appendix for readers to further explore the interested hydrological topics.

Introduction
1	 Introduction
Hydrology is a branch of scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the occurrence, distribution, 
movement, and properties of the waters of the earth. Knowledge of hydrology is fundamental to water 
and environmental professionals (engineers, scientists and decision makers) in such tasks as the design 
and operation of water resources, wastewater treatment, irrigation, flood risk management, navigation, 
pollution control, hydropower, ecosystem modelling, etc.
This unit covers the fundamental theories on 1. Hydrological cycle and water balance, 2. Precipitation, 
3. Evaporation and transpiration, 4. Infiltration, 5. Groundwater, 6. Hydrograph, 7. Flow routing, 
8. Hydrological measurements, 9. Hydrological statistics, 10. Hydrological design.
1.1	
Hydrological Cycle
The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, 
above and below the earth surface. The sun, which drives the water cycle, radiates solar energy on 
the oceans and land. Water evaporates as vapor into the air. Ice and snow can sublimate directly into 
water vapor. Evapotranspiration is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. Rising 
air currents take the vapor up into the atmosphere where cooler temperatures cause it to condense into 
clouds. Air currents move clouds around the globe, cloud particles collide, grow, and fall out of the sky 
as precipitation. Some precipitation falls as snow and can accumulate as ice caps and glaciers, which can 
store frozen water for thousands of years. Snowpacks can thaw and melt, and the melted water flows over 
land as snowmelt. Most precipitation falls back into the oceans or onto land, where the precipitation 
flows over the ground as surface runoff. A portion of runoff enters rivers in valleys in the landscape, 
with streamflow moving water towards the oceans. Runoff and groundwater are stored as freshwater 
in lakes. Not all runoff flows into rivers. Much of it soaks into the ground as infiltration. Some water 
infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes aquifers, which store huge amounts of freshwater for 
long periods of time. Some infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface-
water bodies (and the ocean) as groundwater discharge. Some groundwater finds openings in the land 
surface and comes out as freshwater springs. Over time, the water returns to the ocean, where our main 
water cycle started (Wikipedia, 2009).
1.2	
Key Hydrological Processes
Precipitation: Condensed water vapor that falls to the earth surface. Most precipitation occurs as rain, 
but also includes snow, hail, fog drip, sleet, etc.
Runoff: The variety of ways by which water moves across the land. This includes both surface runoff 
and channel runoff. As it flows, the water may infiltrate into the ground, evaporate into the air, become 
stored in lakes or reservoirs, or be extracted for agricultural or other human uses.

Introduction
Infiltration: The flow of water from the ground surface into the ground. Once infiltrated, the water 
becomes soil moisture or groundwater.
Subsurface Flow: The flow of water underground, in the vadose zone and aquifers. Subsurface water 
may return to the surface (e.g. as a spring or by being pumped) or eventually seep into the oceans. 
Water returns to the land surface at lower elevation than where it infiltrated, under the force of gravity 
or gravity induced pressures. Groundwater tends to move slowly, and is replenished slowly, so it can 
remain in aquifers for thousands of years.
Evaporation and transpiration: The transformation of water from liquid to gas phases as it moves from 
the ground or bodies of water into the overlying atmosphere. The source of energy for evaporation is 
primarily solar radiation. Evaporation often implicitly includes transpiration from plants, though together 
they are specifically referred to as evapotranspiration.
1.3	
Common Units
Flow rate in stream and rivers are usually recorded as cubic metres per second (m3/s, i.e., cumecs) or 
cubic feet per second (cfs). Volumes are often measured as cubic metres, gallons, and litres. Precipitations 
are commonly recorded in inches or millimetres. Rainfall rates are usually represented in inches 
or centimetres per hour. Evaporation, transpiration and infiltration rate are measured as inches or 
millimetres per day or longer time periods.
Some common conversions:
1 inch = 0.254 metre = 25.4 mm
1 foot = 0.3048 metre
1 gallon = 0.003785 m3
1 m3 = 1000 litres
1 mile = 1.609 km
1.4	
Water Distribution in Space and Time
The estimates of the total amount of water on the earth and in various processes are presented in Table 1. 
It can be seen that most of the earth’s water is in the oceans (96.5%). Fresh water is only a small proportion 
of the total water (2.5%) and mainly stored in the ice.

Water Balance
The total amount of water available to the earth is finite and conserved. Although the total volume of 
water in the global hydrologic cycle remains constant, the distribution of this water is continually changing 
on continents, in regions and local catchments. The global annual water balance is presented in Table 3.

A catchment (also called drainage basin, river basin, watershed) is an extent of land where water from 
rain or snow melt drains downhill into a body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, 
sea or ocean. In hydrology, catchment is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water 
within the hydrological cycle, because the majority of water that discharges from the catchment outlet 
originated as precipitation falling on the catchment.

Practice
Practice 1
The volume of atmospheric water is 12,900 km3. The evapotranspiration from land is 72,000km3/year and 
that from ocean is 505,000km3/year. Estimate the residence time of water molecules in the atmosphere 
(in days).
Solution
The residence time can be derived by dividing the volume of water by the flow rate
Total flow rate = 505000+72000=577000 km3/s
The residence time = 12900/577000 = 0.0224 year = 8.2 days

Precipitation
2	 Precipitation
Precipitation is part of the atmosphere water and derived from water vapour. Atmospheric water mostly 
exists as vapour, but briefly and locally it becomes a liquid (rainfall and cloud water droplets) or a solid 
(snowfall, cloud ice crystal and hails).
2.1	
Atmosphere Water
The sun is the driving force for the hydrological cycle. Precipitation comes from water vapour generated 
by the solar radiation from land and ocean. Water is made of H2O hence water vapour is lighter than 
air (low air pressure is linked with high moisture, hence more likely to rain). The energy required to 
vaporise water is 2.5 ×106 J/kg (specific latent heat for water vaporisation).
Practice 1
A storm with 100mm depth fell over an area of 100 km2 within 2 hours. Estimate the energy and power 
release from this storm (in Joule and MW).

Precipitation Types
Precipitation is derived from atmospheric water. Atmospheric moisture is a necessary but not sufficient 
condition for precipitation. Other factors such as wind, temperature, atmospheric pressure and local 
landscape can influence precipitation. Two processes can produce precipitation: ice crystal process 
(aerosols act as freezing nuclei. Ice crystals grow in size and fall to ground. They tend to melt before 
hitting the ground surface) and coalescence process (small cloud droplets increase their sizes due to 
contact with other droplets through collision).
Vertical transport of air masses is a requirement for precipitation. There are three major categories of 
precipitation:
1.	 Convective precipitation: Heated air near the ground expands and absorbs more water 
moisture. The warm moisture-laden air moves up and gets condensed due to lower 
temperature, thus producing precipitation. Convective precipitation spans from light shows 
to thunderstorms with extremely high intensity.
2.	 Orographic precipitation: The uplifting of air is caused by natural barriers such as mountain 
ranges.
3.	 Cyclonic precipitation: The uneven heating of the earth’s surface by the sun results high 
and low pressure regions, and air masses move from high pressure regions to low pressure 
regions. If warm air replaces colder air, the front is called a warm front. If cold air displaces 
warm air, its front is called a cold front.
2.3	
Rain drop size and velocity
Rain drops may be considered as falling bodies that subject to gravitational, buoyancy and air resistance 
effects. Rain drop velocity at equilibrium (terminal velocity) is related to the square of rain drop diameter. 
Larger drops fall faster and are able to collect more water during the fall. However, if a drop is too large 
(about 6~7 mm in diameter), it tends to break into smaller droplets.
The force balance for a rain drop is

The tasks involved are a) to examine the consistency of Gauge X data; b) to find when a change in regime 
occurred; c) to discuss possible causes; d) to adjust the data and determine what difference this makes 
to the 36 year annual average precipitation at Gauge X.
Figure 4 Double mass curve
It can be seen that Gauge X data are not consistent. There is a change in regime around 1981. This change 
could be due to gauge re-siting, growing trees, etc. If the earlier period is correct,

Areal Rainfall
It is important to have accurate rainfall information in a catchment for hydrological assessment. However, 
rainfall varies in space and it is expensive to install and maintain a very dense rain gauge network to 
completely cover all the catchments. As a result, only a limited number of gauges are installed and there 
are large gaps between the gauges. For assessing rainfall in a catchment, we need to determine the average 
rainfall over the catchment so that the total amount of rainfall could be estimated.

Thiessen Polygon Method
The Thiessen Polygon method assumes that at any point in a catchment, the rainfall is the same as that 
at the nearest rain gauge so the depth recorded at a given gauge is applied out to a distance halfway to 
the next gauge in any direction.

The Thiessen Polygon method is the most popular method used in practical engineering problems. The 
polygons can be plotted by hand or with computer software (such as ARCView and Matlab). However, it 
does not consider the gradual change between the gauges and ignores the orographic influence on rainfall.
Practice 2
Draw Thiessen polygons on the catchment shown in Figure 6. If the rainfall depths recorded by Gauge 
A, B and C are 10mm, 8mm and 9mm and the corresponding polygon areas are 5.1km2, 3.2km2 and 
5.3km2, estimate the catchment average rainfall depth.

Isohyetal Method
This method uses isohyets constructed from the rain gauges by interpolating contour lines between 
adjacent gauges. Once the isohyetal map is constructed, the area between each pair of isohyets, within 
the catchment, is multiplied by the average rainfall depths of the two boundary isohyets. The average 
rainfall over the whole catchment can be estimated from the weight-averaged value.
The isohyetal method is flexible and knowledge of the storm pattern can help the drawing of isohyets, but 
a fairly dense network of gauges is needed to correctly construct the isohyetal map from a complex storm. 
They are useful for graphical display of rainfall distribution but less popular in engineering applications.

Geostatistics
The conventional methods cannot estimate the uncertainty with the result. Geostatistical methods can 
be used to compute best estimates as well as error bands that describe the potential magnitude of the 
estimation error. The uncertainty information is useful for decision making (e.g., to add extra rain gauges 
if the uncertainties are large at certain points). Kriging is a typical method in this category. Readers can 
explore this method further at Wikipedia ‘Kriging’.

4.	 Over a period of 30 years from 1971–2000, records of daily rainfall data have been collected. 
One site X was inspected in 1985 and a large Willow tree was found to be over-shadowing 
the gauge. This was cut down in the same year. The data from the gauge was found to be 
of great potential value in a subsequent reservoir study and a means for inspecting and 
adjusting the data was sought.
Use the double mass analysis technique to carry out the following operations using the data 
in the table:
a)	 determine the approximate date of the first significant evidence for over-shadowing of 
Gauge X;
b)	 does the felling of the tree appear to have solved the gauging problem?
c)	 evaluate a correction ratios that can be used to adjust incorrect values. (Hint: use graph

Evapotranspiration
Evaporation is the vaporisation of liquid water. Evaporation is an essential part of the water cycle. Solar 
energy drives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, moisture in the soil, and other sources of water. 
In hydrology, evaporation estimation is divided into two categories: evaporation from open water surface 
and evaporation from land.

 Net radiation
When radiation strikes a surface, it is partially reflected and partially absorbed. The reflected fraction 
is called albedo α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1). Deep water absorbs most of the incident radiation with α ≈ 0.06. Fresh 
snow’s albedo can reach 0.9. The net radiation flux Rn is the difference between the radiation absorbed

In addition to the energy, vapour transport is also important. The transport rate is governed by the

Evapotranspiration from Land
On land, evapotranspiration is a combination of evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from 
vegetation. In addition to energy and water transport, the availability of soil water is also important. 
When water availability is not a limiting factor, evapotranspiration reaches its full potential and is 
called potential evapotranspiration. In practice, a value for the potential evapotranspiration is calculated 
at a local climate station on a reference surface (short grass, see FAO 1998). This value is called the 
reference evapotranspiration, and can be converted to a potential evapotranspiration by multiplying 
with a surface coefficient. In agriculture, this is called a crop coefficient. As the soil dries out, the rate 
of evapotranspiration drops below the potential evapotranspiration rate.
The aforementioned combination method was further developed by many researchers and extended to 
vegetated surfaces by introducing resistance factors. The daily reference evapotranspiration recommended 
FAO (based on the Penman-Monteith Equation) is

Evaporation and Evapotranspiration
The FAO Penman-Monteith equation determines the evapotranspiration from the hypothetical grass 
reference surface and provides a standard to which evapotranspiration in different periods of the year 
or in other regions can be compared and to which the evapotranspiration from other vegetations can 
be related.
Actual evapotranspiration depends on the vegetation type and availability of soil water. If soil water is 
not a limiting factor, actual evapotranspiration for a vegetation cover (called crop in the FAO report) is

where ETc crop evapotranspiration (mm/day), Kc crop coefficient (dimensionless), ET0 reference crop 
evapotranspiration (mm/day). A list of KC values can be found in FAO 1998 (p127).
Most of the effects of the various weather conditions are incorporated into the ET0 estimate. Therefore, as 
ET0 represents an index of climatic demand, Kc varies predominately with the specific crop characteristics 
and only to a limited extent with climate. This enables the transfer of standard values for Kc between 
locations and between climates.

Pan
An evaporation pan is used to hold water during observations for the determination of the quantity of 
evaporation at a given location. Often the evaporation pans are automated with water level sensors and 
a small weather station is located nearby. Pan evaporation is used to estimate the evaporation from lakes 
and land. Evaporation from a natural body of water is usually at a lower rate because the body of water 
does not have metal sides that get hot with the sun.

3.4.2	
Lysimeter
A lysimeter is a measuring device which can be used to measure the amount of actual evapotranspiration 
which is released by plants, usually crops or trees. By recording the amount of precipitation that an 
area receives and the amount lost through the soil, the amount of water lost to evapotranspiration can 
be calculated. It does this by isolating the vegetation root zone from its environment and controlling 
the processes that are difficult to measure, the different terms in the soil water balance equation can 
be determined with greater accuracy. A requirement of lysimeters is that the vegetation both inside 
and immediately outside of the lysimeter be perfectly matched (same height and leaf area index). This 
requirement has historically not been closely adhered to in a majority of lysimeter studies and has 
resulted in severely erroneous and unrepresentative data. As lysimeters are difficult and expensive to 
construct and as their operation and maintenance require special care, their use is limited to specific 
research purposes (FAO, 1998).
3.4.3 	
Eddy covariance
This is a prime atmospheric flux measurement technique to measure and calculate vertical turbulent 
fluxes within atmospheric boundary layers. It is a statistical method that analyses high-frequency wind 
and scalar atmospheric data series, and yields values of evaporation or evapotranspiration. The technique 
is mathematically complex, and requires significant care in setting up and processing data (Wikipedia, 
2009).

Catchment/reservoir water balance
Evapotranspiration may be estimated by creating an equation of the water balance of a catchment. The 
equation balances the change in water stored within the basin (S) with precipitation P, surface runoff R,

Questions 3 Evaporation and Evapotranspiration
1.	 What weather variables are needed for calculating evaporation from open water surface with 
the combined method?
2.	 What are the factors that influence the actual evapotranspiration on land?
3.	 What are the potential evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration? Describe their 
relationship with the actual evapotranspiration.
4.	 Using the Hefner equation, find the daily evaporation rate (in mm/day) for a lake of area 
5 km2 given that the mean air temperature is 20oC and water surface temperature is 150C. 
The average wind speed is 15 km/h, and relative humidity is 20% (all the measures in air are 
at 2m height). If the same evaporation rate is maintained for a whole year, how much water 
is lost due to evaporation (m3)?
(Answer: 7.00 mm/day, 12.8 million m3)
5.	 With the same lake in Q4, if the net radiation is 210W/m2 and the lake is 1000m above sea 
level, estimate evaporation rate (in mm/day) using the combined method (assume water 
density is 1000kg/m3).
(Answer: 7.04 mm/day)
6.	 With the same weather conditions as Q4 and Q5 (replacing the lake with a land), estimate 
reference evapotranspiration using FAO Penman- Monteith equation.
(Answer: 5.90 mm/day)

Infiltration
4	 Infiltration
Infiltration is the process of water penetrating from the ground surface into the soil. The maximum rate 
at which water can enter the soil is called the infiltration capacity.
4.1	
Relevant Basic Terms
4.1.1	
Porosity
volume of voids
total volume
η =

(1)
The range for soil η is usually around 0.25 ~ 0.75.
4.1.2	
Soil moisture content
The voids in soil are occupied by liquid water and air. The soil moisture content describes the liquid 
water volume in the soil.
volume of liquid water
total volume
θ =

(2)
Hence 0 ≤ θ ≤ η. For dry soil, θ = 0 and saturated soil θ = η
4.1.3 	
Vadose zone (unsaturated zone)
It is between the land surface and the water table. Water in the vadose zone has a pressure head less than 
atmospheric pressure (called the suction head).
4.1.4 	
Field capacity
It is the amount of soil liquid moisture held in soil after excess water has drained away and serves as a 
measure of soil water-holding capacity. In practice, the field capacity is found after the saturated soil is 
drained for 2–3 days. The soils in England during the winter are around field capacity since precipitation 
exceeds evapotranspiration.
4.1.5 	
Soil moisture deficit (SMD)
This represents the amount of rainfall necessary to return the soil to ‘field capacity’.

The Darcy’s law is still applicable. The difference is that the hydraulic conductivity is not constant 
anymore and varies with soil moisture content (Figure 1). The drier the soil, the smaller the hydraulic 
conductivity. On the other hand, the soil suction head’s absolute value goes up with drier soil. z should 
be negative and measured from the ground surface.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Basic Terms
5.1.1	
Aquifer
An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, 
sand, silt, or clay) from which groundwater can be usefully extracted using a water well.
5.1.2	
Water table
The water table is the level at which the groundwater pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure.
5.1.3	
Aquitard
An aquitard is a zone within the earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another. 
Aquitards comprise layers of either clay or non-porous rock with low hydraulic conductivity.
5.1.4 	
Unconfined aquifer
It is an aquifer with the water table as its upper boundary. Because the aquifer is not under pressure the 
water level in a well is the same as the water table outside the well.
5.1.5 	
Confined aquifer
It is an aquifer found between two relatively impermeable layers.

Groundwater
5.1.6	
Artesian aquifer/well
It is a confined aquifer containing groundwater that will flow upward through a well, called an artesian 
well, without the need for pumping. Water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is 
high enough, in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well.
5.1.7	
Water well
A water well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, boring or drilling 
to access groundwater in underground aquifers.
5.1.8	
Borehole
It is a narrow shaft drilled in the ground as part of a groundwater site assessment.
5.1.9 	
Piezometric surface
The imaginary surface that everywhere coincides with the piezometric head of the water in the aquifer. 
In areas of artesian ground water, it is above the land surface.
5.1.10 	
Base flow
Base flow is the portion of stream flow that comes from groundwater. It sustains flows in a river during 
the dry periods between rainstorms.

Groundwater Recharge
The natural or intentional infiltration (percolation) of surface water into the groundwater system.
5.1.12 	
Fossil water
Fossil water is groundwater that has remained in an aquifer for thousands or even millions of years. 
When geologic changes seal the aquifer off from further recharging, the water becomes trapped inside.
5.2	
Characteristics of Confined/Unconfined Groundwater
Unconfined groundwater
1) Free water table
2) Hydraulics gradient can change rapidly
3) Greater fluctuations with seasons
4) Drill to water table
5) No flowing wells
6) Recharge area is around borehole
7) On pumping, aquifer dewatered
8) More complex mathematics
9) Must be below ground surface
Confined groundwater
1) No water table – piezometric surface
2) Hydraulic gradient more uniform
3) Smaller fluctuations with season
4) Drill to aquifer
5) May get flowing wells
6) Recharge area is away from borehole
7) On pumping, aquifer not dewatered – pressure  
decrease over large area
8) Simpler mathematics
9) May be above ground surface

where q is flux (not pore velocity), d is the mean soil grain diameter, μ is viscosity, ρ is water density
For Darcy’s law to be valid, Re should be less than 1 (i.e., slow flow and in laminar flow state). In most 
practical engineering problems, Re is less than one.
Practice
Water in an aquifer moves with a flux of 30cm/day. The average soil particle size is 1.5 mm. Find the 
Reynolds number and check whether Darcy’s law is applicable (water density is 1000kg/m3 and water 
viscosity is 1.137×10-3 Ns/m2).

MODFLOW
MODFLOW is the U.S. Geological Survey modular finite-difference flow model, which is a computer code 
that solves the groundwater flow equation. The program is used by engineers and scientist to simulate 
the flow of groundwater through aquifers. The code is free software, written primarily in Fortran, and 
can compile and run on DOS, Windows or Unix-like operating systems. Since its original development 
in the early 1980s, the USGS have released four major releases, and is now considered to be the de facto 
standard code for aquifer simulation.
The latest version is MODFLOW-2005 Version 1.7 released on 23 September 2009.

FEFLOW
FEFLOW (Finite Element subsurface FLOW system) is a commercial computer program for simulating 
groundwater flow, mass transfer and heat transfer in porous media. The program uses finite element 
analysis to solve the groundwater flow equation of both saturated and unsaturated conditions as well 
as mass and heat transport, including fluid density effects and chemical kinetics for multi-component 
reaction systems. It is owned by DHI Group (Danish Hydraulics Istitute). FEFLOW has a unique graphical 
user interface when compared to most other Microsoft Windows-based groundwater modelling software. 
This is attributed to the Motif widget toolkit used to develop the interface. The program is offered in both 
32-bit and 64-bit versions for Linux and for Microsoft Windows operating systems (using a proprietary 
X Window System, Hummingbird Exceed). Support for UNIX platforms ended with version 5.3; prior 
support was provided for IRIX, Tru64, and Solaris. The latest version is FEMFLOW 5.4.

MIKE SHE
MIKE SHE is a commercial computer program owned by DHI and is an integrated hydrological 
modelling system for building and simulating surface water flow and groundwater flow. MIKE SHE can 
simulate the entire land phase of the hydrologic cycle and allows components to be used independently 
and customized to local needs. MIKE SHE emerged from System Hydrologique European (SHE) as 
developed and extensively applied since 1977 onwards by a consortium of three European organizations: 
the Institute of Hydrology (the United Kingdom), SOGREAH (France) and DHI Water.Environment.
Health(Denmark). Then DHI has continuously put effort in development and research on MIKE SHE. 
MIKE SHE can be used for the analysis, planning and management of a wide range of water resources 
and environmental problems related to surface water and groundwater, especially surface water impact 
from groundwater withdrawal, conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water, wetland management 
and restoration, river basin management and planning, impact studies for changes in land use and climate. 
The program is offered in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Questions 5 Groundwater
a)	 What are the essential differences between unconfined and confined groundwater flow?
b)	 A well of 0.3m radius in a confined aquifer was pumped at a steady rate of 30litre/s from 
a fully penetrating well. When the well level remained constant at 85.5m above datum, 
the observation well (borehole) constructed at a distance of 10m recorded a water level of 
86.5m. The aquifer thickness is estimated at 20m.
1.	 What are the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of the aquifer around the well (in 
m/day and m2/day)?
(Answers: 72.3 m/day, 1452 m2/day )
2.	 If a small village is about 300m away from the new production well, estimate the impact 
of the well to the piezometric surface at the village if the piezometric surface prior to the 
pumping is about 90m AOD.
(Answer: level drop by 2.5 m)
You are required to work out the solution from Darcy’s law, instead of using Eq(4) directly.

6.1	
Basic Terms
6.1.1	
River Runoff
River runoff is surface water in rivers. When rain falls onto the earth, it starts to move according to the 
law of gravity. There are four ways that rainfall contributes to river runoff: 1) overland surface runoff; 
2) interflow (subsurface runoff), 3) base flow from groundwater; 4) rainfall onto river channel.
6.1.2	
Infiltration excess runoff
When rainfall intensity is greater than ground surface infiltration rate, surface runoff is generated. 
Infiltration excess flow usually occurs during high intensity rainfall events. If the subsoil infiltration rate 
is lower than the top soil infiltration rate, infiltration excess runoff can occur below the ground surface 
and this will result in interflow (i.e., subsurface runoff).
6.1.3	
Saturation excess runoff
When rainfall intensity is less than soil infiltration rate, prolonged rainfall will saturate the soil and no more 
water could be held. As a result, excess water is released from the soil into groundwater and river channels.
6.1.4 Direct runoff
Overland surface runoff and interflow travel much faster than groundwater, hence they are combined 
into a term ‘direct runoff’ in hydrology.

Flow Event Separation
In water balance calculations, it is necessary to separate individual rainfall runoff events as shown Figure 
3. The shaded area is the total flow volume, which is not easy to calculate since the recession curve of 
this event will reach infinity with time. In practice, a recession curve formula is used to estimate the 
water volume.
If the recession part is dominated by groundwater supply, the recession curve can normally be 
approximated as

Direct Runoff and Base Flow Separation
For each flow event derived from the above, we need to separate it into direct runoff and base flow. There is 
no standard means of differentiating between base flow and direct runoff. Generally, as time goes by from 
the peak of the flow, the dominance of surface and interflow will decrease and groundwater is gradually 
taking over. The N days in the diagram should be estimated from the actual catchment characteristics. For 
a rough guidance, an equation by Linsley (Linsley 1992, P45) could be used:

Figure 5 Direct runoff and base flow separation with an event hydrograph
The straight line A-C divides the flow into direct runoff and base flow.
In practice, it is also common that individual rainfall runoff events are not separated and base flow can 
be found by drawing a horizontal line (or a sloping line) along the event hydrographs (Figure 6).

Effective Rainfall (Net Rainfall)
Effective rainfall (or net rainfall) is the part of the total rainfall that contributes to direct runoff. The 
difference between the total rainfall and the effective rainfall is called ‘losses’. There are many ways to 
derive effective rainfall. The water balance equation is the foundation for these methods as shown below.
Total effective rainfall = Direct runoff volume

Soil moisture accounting scheme
Although the aforementioned simple schemes are easy to use, they are too much simplified for actual 
effective rainfall processes and cannot provide the proportions of the effective rainfall related to surface 
runoff, interflow and base flow. Nowadays, soil moisture accounting models are increasingly used in 
effective rainfall estimation. This type of models includes several soil layers with the upper layer for the 
vegetation interception. For further information, readers can refer to HEC-HMS user manual (HEC, 
2009). Other models such as Xinanjiang and PDM are also widely used.

Direct Runoff Modelling (Unit Hydrograph)
With the effective rainfall, a unit hydrograph model is usually used to model the direct runoff.
6.5.1	
Unit hydrograph definition
The unit hydrograph is the catchment flow response to a unit (1 cm) of effective rainfall occurring over 
a given duration (Figure 10). It is assumed that a) effective rainfall is uniformly distributed over the 
whole catchment and the duration; b) direct runoff process is linear in superposition and proportionality 
(i.e., if rainfall is doubled, the runoff is also doubled. Any runoff from a later time can be added to the 
previous runoff); c) the rainfall runoff process is stationary (no change with time).

Practice
A river catchment has a 2 hour unit hydrograph with the ordinates 0, 3, 11, 35, 55, 66, 63, 40, 22, 9 and 2 
m3/s. Assume that the base flow at time t=0 hour is 20 m3/s and linearly increases to 44 m3/s at t=24 hours.
a)	 Compute the hydrograph resulting from two successive 2 hour periods of effective rain of 
2.0cm and 1.5 cm respectively.
b)	 To prevent downstream flooding, the maximum flow to be released from the catchment is 
set at 180 m3/s. Calculate the space needed to store the excess water from this event (in m3).

The unit hydrograph estimated from rainfall runoff records of a specific catchment can only be applied

develop a unit hydrograph model. In such cases, a synthetic unit hydrograph can be estimated from a 
set of equations derived from the regression analysis of the gauged catchments. For example, a set of

Flow Routing
7	 Flow Routing
Flow routing is a procedure to estimate downstream hydrograph from upstream hydrograph (Figure 1). 
Since flow routing has been widely used in flood estimations, flow routing is usually called flood routing. 
The routed hydrograph is delayed by a time lag (translation) and is attenuated. Flow routing is divided 
into river flow routing and reservoir flow routing.

To estimate the downstream outflow, it is also necessary to get the storage function that links the input 
and output.
S = f (I, O)

The outflow equation
The storage function in a river reach is linked with6 both inflow and outflow.
S = K[XI +  (1 – X)O]
(4)
where K is the storage time constant for the reach, X is a weighing factor ( between 0~ 0.5, usually 
around 0.2).

It is important to check if  C0 + C1 + C2 = 1. If not, some adjustments to the parameters are needed. If 
there are rounding errors, adjust the largest C value first.
Since I1, I2 and O1 are known for every time step, O2 is solved for successive time steps using each O2 as 
O1 for the next time step. O1 is assumed the same as I1 at the beginning if not given.

Estimation of K and X
If there are no downstream records, the K value is estimated from the travel time in the reach (based 
on river bed slope and cross section). The X value is usually assumed as 0.2. If there are measured flow 
records downstream, more accurate X and K values can be derived from the procedures below.

From Figure 5, it is clear that X=0.25 curve has the narrowest loop, hence X=0.25 is chosen. The slope of 
the line is 6. Since the time interval is 6 hours, so K = 6 × 6hr = 36hr. The line’s intercept to the horizontal 
axis is not zero because the storage initial value is set as zero instead of 31. Since we are only interested 
in the slope, this is not a problem.

Reservoir Flow Routing
For a flood going through a reservoir, the water level in the reservoir is assumed as horizontal. The 
storage function would be linked with the reservoir water level.
S = f   (h)S
(6)
This function can be found from the topographic map. Since the storage below the spillway crest plays 
no role in the flow routing process, only the storage above the crest is considered.

A typical reservoir flow routing is illustrated in Figure 8. The outflow peak is attenuated by the reservoir, 
hence the downstrean flooding risk is reduced.

Questions 7 Flow Routing
1.	 The Muskingum method of flood routing has been chosen to forecast the movement 
of a flood wave from a point 30 km upstream of a centre of population. Engineers have 
previously estimated the Muskingum K and X parameters for this reach to be 10 hours and 
0.15 respectively.

If the upstream flood was measured every 6 hours starting at 0900 hours and the flows were 
recorded as 25, 35, 50, 80, 140, 130, 90, 80, 50, 30 and 25 m3 / s for the first 60 hours and 25 
m3 / s thereafter then estimate the peak flow at the town and the time at which the peak flow 
will occur.

2.	 A triangular-shaped inflow hydrograph is routed through a reservoir assuming it is 
completely full at the beginning of the storm. The spillway crest is 20 m wide and has 
a coefficient of 2.7. The reservoir area is 0.5 km2 and has vertical sides. What are the

Hydrological Measurements
8	 Hydrological Measurements
Hydrological measurements are used to obtain data on hydrological processes. Academic research and 
practical engineering projects all depend on the hydrological data to calibrate and validate the relevant 
models.
8.1	
Basic terms
Hydrological processes vary in time and space. Although they are continuous in time and space, they are 
usually measured at point samples. The following information is relevant to hydrological measurements.
8.1.1	
Time series
A time series is a sequence of data points, measured typically at successive times, spaced at (often uniform) 
time intervals. For example, the rainfall measured by a rain gauge at a specific location is a time series.
8.1.2 	
Time domain
Time domain refers to the analysis of hydrological time series with respect to time. A time domain 
graph shows how a hydrological process changes over time. It uses tools such as auto-correlation and 
cross-correlation analysis.
8.1.3 	
Frequency domain
A frequency domain graph shows how much of the time series lies within each given frequency band 
over a range of frequencies. The frequency tools include spectral analysis and wavelet analysis.
8.1.4 	
Spatial data
Spatial data have some form of spatial or geographical reference that enables them to be located in two 
or three dimensional space (such as remote sensed images). Spatial data are often accessed, manipulated 
or analyzed through Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
8.1.5 	
Spatial time series
It is a collection of time series with spatial or geographical references. For example, the data from a 
network of rain gauges are a typical spatial time series.

Hydrological Measurements
8.1.6	
Aliasing
It is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when 
sampled. In such a case, distortions will occur when the signal reconstructed from samples is different 
from the original continuous signal.
Figure 1 Signal aliasing (wikipedia ‘aliasing’)
8.1.7	
Nyquist frequency
A perfect reconstruction of a signal is possible when the sampling frequency is greater than twice the 
maximum frequency of the signal being sampled. For example, if a signal has an upper band limit of 
100 Hz, a sampling frequency greater than 200 Hz will avoid aliasing and allow theoretically perfect 
reconstruction. If a lower sampling rate has to be used, an anti-aliasing filter should be used to prevent 
aliasing.
8.2 	
Land based measurements
8.2.1 	
Rain gauge
Rainfall is recorded by two types of gauges: a nonrecording gauge is simply a container to store rain water. 
They are read manually at long time intervals (daily, weekly, etc.). In contrast, recording gauges automatically 
record the depth of rainfall with a high temporal resolution (available 15 minutes or hourly). A recording gauge 
has various ways of measuring rainfall intensity (tipping bucket, float, weighing, optical, etc.). The tipping 
bucket gauge is the most widely used rain gauge by the water industry due to its low cost and high reliability.
A rain gauge is more accurate than other rainfall measurement devices (e.g., weather radar and satellite), 
but it can only measure rainfall at a specific location, and its quality can be affected by wind, fallen tree 
leaves, etc.

Snow pillow
A snow pillow measures the water equivalent of the snow pack based on snow pressure on a plastic pillow.
8.2.3 	
Evaporation pan
An evaporation pan is used to hold water during observations for the determination of evaporation at 
a given location.
8.2.4 	
Lysimeter
A lysimeter is used to measure evapotranspiration and made with a tank of soil in which vegetation is 
planted to emulate the surrounding ground cover. The amount of evapotranspiration is measured by 
water weight balance from the water input and output of the tank.
8.2.5 	
River weir/flume
The discharge in a river (small to medium sizes) can be measured by a weir or flume (Figure 3). The 
water depth upstream of the weir/flume is measured and the discharge can be derived from the energy 
equation. For large rivers, water levels are measured and discharges are derived from the calibrated stage 
discharge rating curves.

Soil moisture sensors
Soil moisture sensors measure water content in soil. There are three commonly used soil moisture 
sensors: capacitance sensor, tensiometer and neutron probe. All the sensors need to be calibrated for 
different soil types.
a)	 A tensiometer provides a direct measure of the tension at which water is held in soil. This 
instrument comprises a water filled tube which is sealed at one end, with a porous ceramic 
filter at the other end. When buried in soil, it allows water to flow freely through it, but 
not air. The suction of the water within the tube provides a direct measure of the suction 
pressure in the surrounding soil. With the suction pressure and soil moisture content curve, 
soil moisture can then be derived.
b)	 A capacitance sensor uses capacitance to measure the soil water content. It is a simple 
sensor made from two plates and the capacitance between them is measured to derive the 
soil water content.
c)	 A neutron moisture meter consists of two main components, a probe and a gauge. The 
probe is inserted in a hole in the ground and it emits fast neutrons. The emitted neutrons 
are slowed down and reflected by the water molecules in the surrounding soil. The gauge 
monitors the flux of the slow neutrons scattered by the soil. The degree of reflection is 
proportional to the soil moisture content. The operator of a neutron probe needs nuclear 
safety training.
8.2.7 	
Infiltrometer
Infiltrometer is a device used to measure the rate of water infiltration into soil or other porous media. 
Commonly used infiltrometers are of single ring or double rings. It is easy to use, but the soil structure 
is usually disturbed.

Radiation sensors
Solar radiation is shortwave and the earth’s radiation is longwave (infrared) and they are measured by 
different devices.
Pyranometer (also called solarimeter) is used to measure solar radiation on a planar surface. The solar 
radiation is absorbed by a blackbody thermopile and the temperature difference between the metal in 
the radiation and the one under the shade represents the solar radiation intensity. A plastic dome is used 
to block longwave radiation so that only shortwave radiation is measured.
Pyrgeometer is a device that measures infrared radiation. Its working mechanism is similar to pyranometer 
except its plastic shield blocks shortwave radiation.
Net radiometer is used to measure net radiation at the earth’s surface (incoming radiation minus outgoing 
radiation). Two radiation sensors (one upward facing and one downward facing) are needed to derive net 
radiation. If both net radiations for shortwave and longwave are needed, four sensors will be required.
A sunshine recorder is originally made with a glass sphere filled with water and later on with a solid 
glass sphere. When the sphere burns, it records a trace on the recorder cards attached to it, the length 
of which shows the duration of bright sunshine.
8.2.9 	
Anemometer
Anemometer is a weather instrument that measures wind speed. The most widely used anemometer 
consists of three or four cups that spin according to the speed of the wind. Modern ultrasonic anemometers 
are able to measure wind speed in three dimensions.
8.2.10 	
Air Temperature
Thermometers placed in a Stevenson screen are used to measure the ordinary, maximum/minimum air 
temperatures.
8.2.11 	
Hygrometer
Hygrometers are used for measuring relative humidity. Old style hygrometers with wet and dry bulb 
thermometers are called psychrometer. Evaporation from the wet bulb lowers the temperature, so that 
the wet-bulb thermometer usually shows a lower temperature than that of the dry-bulb thermometer. 
The dryer the air, the larger the temperature difference will be. A psychrometer depends on the accuracy 
of its thermometers. If one or both of the thermometers is off, large errors will occur. Modern electronic 
hygrometers use the changes in electrical resistance due to temperature condensation, and changes in 
electrical capacitance to measure humidity changes. Electronic hygrometers are extremely accurate and 
can continuously and automatically record relative humidity.

Barometer
A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. There are various types based on 
air, water or mercury. Italian physicist Torricelli invented the first mercury barometer with a tube of 1m 
long filled with mercury. A more widely used barometer is called aneroid barometer which is made of a 
small, flexible alloy metal cell. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract 
so that the attached mechanical levers can amplify the tiny movements of the capsule for visual display.

In contrast to a rain gauge that is a ground based measurement, weather radar measures rainfall well 
above the ground (Figure 4). Weather radars send directional pulses of microwave radiation. Between 
each pulse, the radar serves as a receiver and listens for return signals from rainfall drops in the air. 
Return echoes, called reflectivity, are analysed for their intensities in order to establish the precipitation 
rate in the scanned volume. Weather radars can cover large areas and are able to observe precipitation 
over the sea. Several radars can be combined to provide a composite rainfall image (Figure 5). There are 
several error sources in weather radar measurements. Radar pulses spread out as they move away from 
the radar station, decreasing resolution at far distances. Radar beams may also suffer from attenuation, 
shielding, anomalous propagation, brightband, etc.

A radiosonde (Sonde is French for probe) is a unit for measuring various atmospheric parameters 
and transmits them to a fixed receiver. Modern radiosondes measure the following variables: pressure, 
temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction. A GPS with the radiosonde provides the 
location information (altitude, latitude/longitude). Worldwide there are more than 800 radiosonde 
launch sites. They are routinely launched at the same time twice a day (0000 and 1200 UTC) to provide 
an instantaneous snapshot of the atmosphere.

Aircraft
Aircrafts with various measuring devices are used to carry out a short period of intensive measurement over a 
study area. Lidar is a commonly used measuring device on an aircraft to derive high resolution digital terrain 
maps, especially during flood inundation events. Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) is an optical remote 
sensing device that measures the elevations of ground and water surfaces using laser light beams.

Space based measurements
Satellites are increasingly used to collect meteorological and environmental variables that can be used 
in hydrological investigations. Two types of satellites are usually of interest to hydrologists and they 
are weather satellite and earth observation satellite. A weather satellite is primarily used to monitor the 
weather and climate of the earth such as clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, hurricane 
movement, etc. An earth observation satellite gathers information about the earth’s physical, chemical 
and biological systems such as land use, natural disasters (floods, land slide, forest fire, …), vegetation 
cover, land surface elevation, etc.
8.4.1 	
Orbit
Satellites can be either polar orbiting, seeing the same swath of the earth every 12 hours, or geostationary, 
hovering over the same spot on the earth by orbiting over the equator while moving at the speed of the 
earth’s rotation.
A geostationary orbit (or Geostationary Earth Orbit – GEO) is a geosynchronous orbit directly above 
the earth’s equator (0° latitude). The satellite orbits in the direction of the earth’s rotation, at an altitude 
of 35,786 km above ground with an orbital period equal to the Earth’s period of rotation. Geostationary 
orbits are useful because they cause a satellite to appear stationary with respect to a fixed point on the 
rotating earth. As a result, an antenna can point in a fixed direction and more frequent measurements 
could be made (e.g., at a sampling interval of 15 minutes or 30 minutes).
Polar orbiting weather satellites circle the earth at a typical altitude of 800 km in a north to south (or 
vice versa) path, passing over the poles in their continuous flight. Polar satellites are usually in sun-
synchronous orbits, which means they are able to observe any place on the earth and will view every 
location twice each day with the same general lighting conditions due to the near-constant local solar 
time. Polar orbiting weather satellites offer a much better spatial resolution than their geostationary 
counterparts due to their closeness to the earth, but their temporal resolutions are much worse (a 
sampling interval of 1day or more).

Spectrum
The satellite remote sensing covers a wide range of electromagnetic spectrum. The most common are 
visible, infrared and microwave. Visible light can provide true colour images, but is only available during 
the day time. It is useful to spot clouds with visible light band (wavelength between 380 nm and 760 nm, 
i.e., 790–400 terahertz). Infrared images can be obtained during the daytime and night hence they are 
available around the clock, and they are useful in detecting object temperature values. Infrared covers a 
spectrum of 300 GHz (1 mm) to 400 THz (750 nm). Microwave covers as long as one meter to as short 
as one mm, or equivalently, with frequencies between 300MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz. Microwaves are 
absorbed by molecules that have a dipole moment in liquids. The commonly use microwave bands are 
L band from 1 to 2 GHz(15–20 cm), S – Band 2 to 4 GHz (7.5–15 cm), C-band 4 to 8 GHz (3.75–7.5 
cm), X band 8.0 to 12.0 GHz (2.5–3.75cm), Ku band 12 ~ 18 GHz (1.7–2.5 cm), K-band 18–27 GHz 
(1.1–1.7cm) and Ka band 26.5–40 GHz (0.75-1.1 cm). Short wavelength microwave is affected by more 
attenuation in the atmosphere and is usually used to measure atmospheric properties. Long wavelength 
microwave can penetrate the atmosphere with little attenuation and is used to measure ground surface 
properties such as soil moisture.

Passive and active microwave
There are two types of remote sensing devices. A passive device has receivers (called radiometer) that 
detect natural radiation emitted or reflected by the measured object. Reflected sunlight is the most 
common source of radiation measured by passive radiometers. An active device, on the other hand, 
has transmitters and receivers. A transmitter sends microwave beam to the target object and a receiver 
detects the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. Radar is an example of active 
remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured to find the distance 
between the target and the sensor.
8.4.4 	
Validation
It is not easy to validate satellite measurements due to the different footprints of the satellite (many sq 
km in size) and ground based measurement (e.g., rain gauge, a point measurement). Large number of 
ground based measurement points with long observation periods are needed for effective validations.
8.5 	
Transportable Weather Station
A weather station is a facility with instruments for observing weather related conditions. The 
measurements include air temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, solar 
radiation and precipitation. Wind measurements are taken as free of other obstructions as possible, 
while temperature and humidity measurements are kept free from direct solar radiation (housed in a 
Stephenson screen).
For some short term hydrological investigations, it is quite convenient to use a transportable weather 
station (TWS). The following instruments are commonly included in a TWS: 1) anemometer (wind 
speed m/s), 2) solarimeter (solar radiation kW/m2), 3) net radiometer (kW/m2), 4) psychrometer (wet 
and dry bulb temperatures oC), 5) precipitation detector (1 = wet; 0 = dry), 6) rain gauge (rainfall depth 
mm), 7) barometer (pressure in mb), 8) wind direction sensor (degrees)
A TWS is equipped with the following accessories: electricity supply (12V mains adapter or 12V 
rechargeable internal battery), a solar panel to charge internal battery (to face south in order to receive 
as much direct sunlight as possible), onboard data logger storing data on memory cards (1 min data 
resolution can be stored for up to 2 weeks unattended), PC serial connector for data download or 
transmission via a communication link.

Hydrological Statistics
9	 Hydrological Statistics
Hydrological processes are driven by physical, chemical and biological principles, the so called ‘Laws of 
Nature’. However, in real life, the hydrological setting is usually of such complexity that the underlying 
hydrological processes cannot be modelled on first principles. Therefore, statistical models may be needed 
to link the hydrological processes in a descriptive way instead of a cause-effect relationship. Probability 
is the foundation for statistics and some relevant probability concepts for flood risk management are 
introduced here.
9.1	
Basic Terms
9.1.1	
Probability
Probability is a measure of how likely that some event will occur.
If a random event occurs a large number of times n and the event has attribute A in na of these occurrences, 
then the probability of the occurrence of the event having attribute A is
( )

(1)
For this probability estimate (based on relative frequency) to be very accurate, n may have to be quite 
large. Since it is impossible to get an infinite number of observations, the actual probability in hydrology 
can only be approximated.
9.1.2 	
Return Period
Return period is the average time interval between occurrences of a hydrological event of a given or 
greater magnitude, usually expressed in years. For example, a 100-year flood will occur on average once 
in every 100 years. It is the inverse of the probability of an event. Therefore, a 100 year flood has 1% 
probability to occur in each year.
If a place has a 2% (0.02) probability of a flood striking in any given year, then that community would 
expect such a flood, on average, every 50 years (1/0.02).

of the 10-year event will not occur exactly 4 times. As a matter of fact, the probability that it will occur 
3 times is nearly identical to the probability it will occur 4 times (0.2003 vs 0.2059). The number of

Eq(11) is easy to apply, but biased (over-estimated) and it is impossible to plot the nth data point (i.e., 
100% probability) on most probability graph papers. For example, with a 100 year flood record, the 
largest flood is ranked 1, hence its exceedance P=1/100, i.e., 100 year return period. But the smallest 
one is ranked 100 and its exceedance P=100/100=1, which is unrealistic (it means any floods will be 
larger than this flood and no floods can be smaller). Eq(12) is able to overcome this problem and is 
the most popular formula among hydrologists despite it is only the best for uniform distributions. In 
FEH (Vol 3 pp. 143), the Gringorten formula is recommended for the flood distribution in the UK. For 
the problems in this unit, Eq(12) is recommended. For practical engineering problems, the relevant 
hydrological manuals should be consulted.

Statistical Rainfall Estimation
The rainfall frequency procedures have two purposes: the estimation of design rainfall depths, and the 
assessment of the rarity of observed rainfall events. Design rainfalls are required principally for river flood 
estimation, here they are an important component in the design for flood defences, bridges, culverts 
and reservoir spillways. Many flood estimates depend on good rainfall frequency information because 
rainfall records tend to be more plentiful and longer than river flow records. Other applications for design 
rainfalls can be found in agriculture and sewage design for built-up areas and drainage for buildings.
The rainfall statistics involve both rainfall depth (or intensity) and duration. It is a complex process to 
derive frequency curves from rainfall data. The useful diagram for rainfall statistics is called DDF (Depth 
Duration Frequency) or IDF (Intensity Duration Frequency). They can be converted from one to the 
other. An example DDF is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5 Depth-Duration-Frequency curves
The DDF diagram can be used to assess the rarity of observed rainfall events (Figure 6a) when the 
duration and rainfall depth information is known, or to estimate design rainfall with a predefined return 
period (Figure 6b).

Hydrological Design (reservoir and dam)
10	 Hydrological Design 
(reservoir and dam)
Hydrological design is used to choose key variables of water engineering systems, such as reservoir size, 
bridge span, dimension of spillway, etc. All projects are designed for the future and engineers are usually 
uncertain as to the precise conditions to which the works will be subjected. This is because that the exact 
sequence of stream flow for future years cannot be predicted and it is usually assumed that the future 
hydrological processes will follow the same patterns as their past ones. In this section, reservoir and dam 
design for water supply is used to illustrate the issues involved in hydrological design of water systems.
10.1	
Reservoir and dam
A reservoir is an artificial lake to store water. Reservoirs are often created by dams which are made of 
concrete, earth, rock, or a mixture across a river. Once the dam is completed, the river fills the reservoir.

Hydrological Design (reservoir and dam)
There are several types of reservoirs and three of them for water supply are: a) Direct supply reservoir: 
characterised by the impounding of a gravity inflow and the piping of outflow to supply; b) Pumped 
reservoir: reservoir inflow is from pumping. A pumped storage reservoir may be formed by damming 
a side valley to the main stream or by raising embankments to enclose a flat area in a river valley; 
c) Regulating reservoir: primarily impounding water for later release to a river when flows at some 
downstream abstract point would otherwise become too low. If the demand centre is downstream, there 
can be a large saving in aqueduct costs. The Bhatsai dam project for water supply to Bombay is such an 
example. In this section, we will further explore direct supply reservoir or regulating reservoir.
Figure 1 Reservoir types for water supply direct supply reservoir, b) pumped reservoir and c) regulating reservoir
10.2	
Basic design procedures
The procedures required to derive the reservoir storage and dam height for a water supply project 
can be carried out in the following steps. First, it is important to estimate the water demand based on 
the population and other factors. Second, a few potential dam sites are selected based on a contour 
map. It is important to check if enough river flow is available at the chosen sites to meet the demand. 
Depending on the catchment areas covering individual dam sites, different reservoir sizes are required 
and hence the corresponding dam heights. Three or four potential dam sites should be initially selected 
for hydrological analysis, and a final site will be decided on other factors (geological, economic and 
environment assessment, etc.).
10.2.1	
Water demand
Water demand is divided into
Domestic (In-house use, out-of-house use)

5.	 Small towns with little industrial demand

To calculate the water demand
Water demand = Safety factor × (Abstraction rate + Compensation flow)
where
Abstraction rate (water abstracted from the river) = population × water consumption
Population = the design population of the city to be supplied with water
Water consumption = water usage litres per capita per day
Compensation flow = minimum flow to be released from the reservoir. Compensation water is the flow 
that must be discharged below a direct supply reservoir to compensate the downstream water demand 
(people and ecosystems).
Safety factor = 1.1~1.2
10.2.2	
Catchment yield
To evaluate the hydrological feasibility of a potential dam site, a comparison between the water demand 
and catchment yield is necessary to check if sufficient water is available at the chosen site. A yield is the 
portion of the precipitation on a catchment that can be collected for use.
Figure 2 River hydrograph and Yield
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Concise Hydrology
113 
Hydrological Design (reservoir and dam)
Safe yield is the minimum yield recorded for a given past period. Abstraction is the intended or actual 
quantity of water withdrawn for use. Unless the minimum flow of stream is well above the minimum 
abstraction which must be satisfied in a water supply project, the minimum flow must be supplemented 
by water impounded in a reservoir. The firm yield is the mean annual rate of release of water through the 
reservoir that can be guaranteed. Naturally, the larger the reservoir storage, the greater is the firm yield, 
with the limit that the firm yield can never be greater than the mean inflow to the reservoir. Since the 
firm yield can never be determined with certainty, it is better to treat yield in probabilistic terms. If the 
flow were absolutely constant, no reservoir would be required; but, as variability of the flow increases, 
the required reservoir capacity increases. This is another way of saying that a reservoir does not make 
water but merely permits its redistribution with respect to time.
10.2.3	
Reservoir storage estimation
A reservoir is used to retain excess water from periods of high flow for use during periods of low 
flow. The impounding reservoirs have two functions: a) to impound water for beneficial use and b) to 
attenuate flood flows. An impounding reservoir presents a water surface for evaporation, and this loss 
should be considered for yield estimation. In addition, the possibility of large seepage losses should also 
be considered. People and ecosystem downstream may be entitled to have a certain amount of water 
that they may make their accustomed use of (compensation flow). Therefore, the water passed must be 
added to the abstraction or subtracted from the stream flow in calculating reservoir storage capacities.

Figure 3 Reservoir storage required
There are three approaches that could be used to estimate the required reservoir storage.
a)	 Mass curve method (Rippl Diagram)
This method was developed by an Australian engineer in the 1890s to provide an answer to 
the question “…how big a reservoir is required for a given demand given an historic inflow 
sequence?”
A mass curve of supply is a curve showing the total (cumulative) volume entering a reservoir 
site over a certain time period (usually years). Records are examined for critical dry periods 
and the mass curve may be constructed for multiple years. Flow data at monthly increments 
are usually sufficient.
i)	
tabulate and plot accumulated flow, 
Q
∑ with time.
ii)	
compute the mean flow Q
iii)	
add a demand line.
	
mass curve gradient > demand line gradient – reservoir filling
	
mass curve gradient > demand line gradient – reservoir emptying
iv)	
construct tangent to 
Q
∑ curve parallel to the demand line at all peaks and troughs (P 
and T). Ignore local maxima and minima. If the reservoir is full at P1, it would need a 
capacity C1 to survive the period of emptying.
v)	
find the maximum C.
vi)	
from intersection points such as F1, the reservoir will be spilling water over the spillway 
(assuming it was full at the previous P) until the next P point is reached.

This method is similar to the Mass Curve method that it is also based on the past flow records. 
Instead of using a graph to derive reservoir storage information, water balance is applied with 
a table to solve the reservoir storage and spillage problem. The following table is for illustration

c)	 Synthetic minimum flow method
This method is based on probability analysis and synthetic flow data instead of real flow data 
are used in the storage estimation. The procedure is formed as follows: 1) locate a long monthly 
flow record; 2) select the lowest monthly flows in each year; 3) rank the minimum monthly 
values starting with the driest; 4) convert flow in m3/s to m3 (i.e., flow rate into runoff volume); 
5) calculate the return period by T = (n+1)/m (In n year record, a record has been equal to or 
exceeded for m times); 6) the return periods should be plotted on a logarithmic paper; 7) draw 
a line that can best fit the data points; 8) read the value of 100 year return period from the 
fitted line (or any other specified return periods);

Hydrological Design (reservoir and dam)
The reservoir has to satisfy the water demand in a dry month with 100 year return period. In 
addition, the following month(s) might be very dry as well and the designers have to consider 
longer periods than just one dry month, so 2, or 3 or more months should be considered in 
the design (up to 11 months in this project). By repeating the procedures described above, it 
is possible to obtain a diagram as shown in Figure 6 and the flow values in 1, 2 , 3, 4, , …, 10, 
11 months.
Figure 6. 1, 2,3, …, 11 month droughts (the logarithmic plot)
A synthetic mass curve can then be constructed from the cumulative minimum runoff data as 
shown in Figure 7. Each point is read from the logarithmic plots. If water demand is known, 
strike a tangent line (with the slope of the water demand) to the curve and the required storage 
can be found on the negative ordinate.

Dam height
Since the primary function of a reservoir is to provide water storage, its most important physical 
characteristic is storage capacity which is linked to the dam height. The relationship between a dam 
height and its reservoir storage capacity is usually described by a curve (Elevation – Storage curve, as 
shown in Figure 8) based on topographic surveys.
Storage volume 
Elevation 
Required storage 
Dam height 
Figure 8 Elevation- Storage curve
The dam elevation for the required storage can be estimated from the Elevation- Storage curve. This 
elevation is referred to as the normal level that is the maximum elevation to which reservoir surface 
will rise during ordinary operating conditions (See Figure 9). For most reservoirs, their normal levels 
are determined by the elevations of spillway crests or tops of spillway gates. The minimum level is the 
lowest elevation to which a reservoir is to be drawn under normal conditions. This level may be fixed 
by the elevation of the lowest outlet in the dam. The storage volume between the minimum and normal 
level is called the useful storage. Water held below the minimum level is called the dead storage.

Reservoirs described above are referred to as direct supply reservoirs or “conventional” reservoirs, and 
majority of reservoirs for water supply are in this category. The reservoir is filled by natural inflow from 
its catchment and water is drawn off through an aqueduct.

constructing a concrete dam across a river valley. It was designed to meet a demand of 13.6 
cumecs and was completed and empty at the end of 1944. The average annual inflows for 
the ensuing 20 year period were 22, 24, 6, 9, 32, 40, 11, 10, 12, 24, 28, 6, 7, 9, 21, 16, 24, 
27, 19 and 34 cumecs respectively. Use the water balance method to solve the following 
questions.
a)	 When was the reservoir full for the first time?
b)	 Estimate the number of months that the reservoir spilled over this 20 year period?
c)	 Did the reservoir run dry during this period? If so, when and for how long?
d)	 If the inflow data had been available prior to the original reservoir design what capacity 
would you have recommended?

a)	 The reservoir at the end of 1945 is 8.4 with a shortfall of 15.5-8.4= 7.1. The net inflow 
is 10.4, so each month has net inflow of 10.4/12=0.87. The months needed to fill up 7.1 
deficit is 7.1/0.87=8.2 month, i.e., early September 1946
b)	 Number of months = 12 x spillage/inflow, therefore 
(3.3/10.4+6.2/18.4+1+2.6/10.4+1+4.7/10.4+1+1+1)×12= 76.3 months
c)	 Yes, 1958, 1.3/4.6*12=3.4 months, hence April, lasted for 12×3.3/4.6= 8.6 months
d)	 Add 3.3 amount, hence 15.5+3.3=18.8m3/s Tyear = 18.8×3.16×107 = 5.9×108 m3
e)	 The reservoir is full (15.5 m3/s Tyear) at the end 1955, but Year 1956, 1957 
and 1958 are very low (6+7+9)= 22 m3/s, hence the maximum water supply is
