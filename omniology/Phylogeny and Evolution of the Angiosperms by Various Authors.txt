Relationships of Angiosperms to 
Other Seed Plants 
Seed plants are of fundamental importance both evolution- 
arily and ecologically. They dominate terrestrial landscapes, 
and the seed has played a central role in agriculture and hu- 
man history. There are five extant lineages of seed plants: 
angiosperms, cycads, conifers, gnetophytes, and Ginkgo. 
These five groups have usually been treated as distinct 
phyla—Magnoliophyta 
(or Anthophyta), Cycadophyta, 
Coniferophyta, Gnetophyta, and Ginkgophyta, 
respec- 
tively. Cantino et al. (2007) used the following “rank-free” 
names 
(see Chapter 12): Angiospermae, Cycadophyta, 
Coniferae, Gnetophyta, and Ginkgo. Of these, the angio- 
sperms are by far the most diverse, with ~14,000 genera 
and perhaps as many as 350,000 (The Plant List 2010) to 
400,000 (Govaerts 2001) species. The conifers, with ap- 
proximately 70 genera and nearly 600 species, are the sec- 
ond largest group of living seed plants. Cycads comprise 
10 genera and approximately 300 species (Osborne et al. 
2012; Fragniére et al. 2015). Gnetales consist of three mor- 
phologically disparate genera, Gnetum, Ephedra, and Wel- 
witschia (~90 species total) that are so distinctive that each 
has been placed in its own family (Gnetaceae, Ephedraceae, 
and Welwitschiaceae). There is a single living species of 
Ginkgo, G. biloba. Each of these extant lineages has a rich 
fossil history (T. Taylor et al. 2009; Friis et al. 2011); we 
cover the fossil record of the angiosperms in more detail 
in Chapter 2 and also in those chapters focused on specific 
angiosperm clades (Chapters 4-10). 
There are also many extinct lineages of seed plants 
(Crane 1985; Decombeix et al. 2010; E. Taylor and T. Tay- 
lor 2009; T. Taylor et al. 2009). Although extant gymno- 
sperms appear to be monophyletic (below and Chapter 2), 
all gymnosperms 
(living and extinct) together are not 
monophyletic. Importantly, several fossil lineages, Cayto- 
niales, Bennettitales, Pentoxylales, and Glossopteridales 
(glossopterids), have been proposed as putative close rela- 
tives of the angiosperms based on phylogenetic analyses 
(e.g., Crane 1985; Rothwell and Serbet 1994; reviewed in 
Doyle 2006, 2008, 2012; Friis et al. 2011). These fossil lin- 
eages, sometimes referred to as the para-angiophytes, will 
therefore be covered in more detail later in this chapter. An- 
other fossil lineage, the corystosperms, has been proposed 
as a possible angiosperm ancestor as part of the “mostly 
male hypothesis” (Frohlich and Parker 2000), but as re- 
viewed here, corystosperms usually do not appear as close 
angiosperm relatives in phylogenetic trees. 
The seed plants represent an ancient radiation, with 
the first seeds appearing near the end of the Devonian 
(~370 million years ago; mya). By the Early to Middle Car- 
boniferous, a diversity of seed plant lineages already ex- 
isted (e.g., Cordaites and walchian conifers; Thomas 1955; 
Bhatnagar and Moitra 1996; Kenrick and Crane 1997; 
Davis and Kenrick 2004; T. Taylor et al. 2009). Hetero- 
spory, prerequisite to evolution of the seed, evolved in par- 
allel in different major clades, including lycophytes, water 
ferns (e.g., Marsilea), sphenophytes, and aneurophytes, and 
seed-like structures, with a retained endosporic megagame- 
tophyte nearly surrounded by an integument-like covering, 
occur in some lycophytes (e.g., Lepidocarpon). Lepidocar- 
pon is not considered a true seed, but is an example of con- 
vergence. Importantly, phylogenetic analyses that include 
the five clades of living seed plants show that they indeed 
form a clade, indicating that all have inherited seeds from 

2 Chapter 1 
a common ancestor—and that these seeds did not evolve in 
parallel. Phylogenetic analyses including extinct seed plants 
also place these groups in the same clade as extant seed 
plants (see below). Thus, analyses support the hypothesis 
that fossil and extant seed plants (Spermatophyta) had a 
single origin. 
The first seed-like structures, observed in the Late De- 
vonian to early Carboniferous, apparently ancestral to true 
seeds, had free integumentary lobes and lacked a micropyle; 
the pollen-receptive structure, lagenostome, was formed 
by the nucellus rather than the integument. The fusion of 
integumentary lobes, except for a micropylar channel, led 
to the formation of true seeds as in lyginopterid seed ferns. 
The fossil record of conifers dates to the Late Carbonif- 
erous and that of true cycads to the Early Permian. Avail- 
able data indicate that by the Permian (~299-251 mya), 
at least three (cycads, conifers, Ginkgo) of the five extant 
lineages of seed plants had probably diverged (Kenrick and 
Crane 1997; Donoghue and Doyle 2000). In contrast, the 
angiosperms are relatively young—their earliest unambigu- 
ous fossil evidence is from the Early Cretaceous (~130 mya) 
although molecular dating methods infer older dates for 
their origin (see Chapter 2). 
Relationships among the lineages of extant seed plants, 
as well as the relationships of living groups to fossil lin- 
eages, have been issues of longstanding interest and debate. 
A topic of particular intrigue has been the closest relatives 
of the angiosperms. Angiosperms are responsible either di- 
rectly or indirectly for the majority of human food and ac- 
count for a huge proportion of photosynthesis and carbon 
sequestration. They have diversified to include 350,000- 
400,000 species in perhaps 130-170 myr and now occur 
in nearly all habitable terrestrial environments and many 
aquatic habitats. Understanding how angiosperms accom- 
plished this is of fundamental evolutionary and ecological 
importance. 
At some point, nearly every living and fossil group of 
gymnosperms has been proposed as a possible ancestor of 
the angiosperms (e.g., Wieland 1918; Thomas 1934, 1936; 
Melville 1962, 1969; Stebbins 1974; Meeuse 1975; Long 
1977; Doyle 1978, 1998a,b; Retallack and Dilcher 1981; 
Crane 1985; Cronquist 1988; Crane et al. 1995; reviewed 
in Doyle 2006, 2008, 2012; Friis et al. 2011). Among ex- 
tant seed plants, the relationship between angiosperms and 
Gnetales has received considerable attention. 
Ascertaining the closest relatives of the angiosperms is 
not only of great systematic importance but also critical 
for assessing character evolution. For example, the out- 
come of investigations of character evolution among basal 
angiosperms, including studies focused on the origin and 
diversification of crucial angiosperm structures (e.g., floral 
organs, endosperm, vessel elements), may be influenced by 
those taxa considered their closest relatives. The effect of 
outgroup choice on the reconstruction of character evo- 
lution within angiosperms is readily seen via the wide- 
spread use of Gnetales as an outgroup for angiosperms. 
As reviewed below, for nearly two decades beginning in 
the 1980s, Gnetales were considered by many to represent 
the closest living relatives of the angiosperms. The use of 
Gnetales as an angiosperm outgroup profoundly influenced 
character-state reconstruction within the flowering plants 
(see “The Anthophyte Hypothesis” section). 
. 
Clarifying relationships among seed plants, both extant 
and fossil, has been extremely difficult. Factors that have 
contributed to the difficulties in phylogeny reconstruc- 
tion of seed plants (living and extinct) include the great 
age of these groups and the considerable morphological 
divergence among them, as well as the extinction of many 
lineages. The tremendous morphological gap among ex- 
tant and fossil seed plant lineages has complicated and ul- 
timately compromised efforts to reconstruct relationships 
with morphology because of homoplasy and uncertainty 
about the homology of structures (e.g., Doyle 1998a, 2006, 
2012; Donoghue and Doyle 2000; Soltis et al. 2005b, 
2008b; Friis et al. 2011). 
Although progress has been made in elucidating rela- 
tionships among extant seed plants using DNA sequence 
data, relationships remain problematic. Even with the ad- 
dition of more taxa and more genes representing all three 
plant genomes, issues remain. Resolution of relationships 
among extant seed plants with DNA sequence data has also 
been difficult because some lineages have relatively short 
branches (e.g., angiosperms or Pinaceae), whereas other 
clades (e.g., Gnetales) have long branches. This problem is 
further compounded by the presence in most analyses of 
long branches to the sister group of seed plants (monilo- 
phytes). In groups such as the angiosperms and conifers, 
more taxa can be added to break up long branches, but 
this is not possible across seed plants as a whole given the 
considerable extinction that has occurred. Another concern 
given the ancient divergences in seed plants is multiple sub- 
stitutions per site leading to saturation of base substitu- 
tions. Hence, whereas the use of morphological characters 
has been criticized in seed plant phylogeny (and in a global 
sense by Scotland et al. 2003), DNA has its own problems 
and certainly has not been a consistent solution to resolve 
relationships among extant seed plants (see Burleigh and 
Mathews 2004, 2007; Mathews 2009; Mathews et al. 
2010; Soltis et al. 2005b, 2008b). 
As stressed by other investigators, 
a complete under- 
standing of seed plant phylogeny is not possible with- 
out the integration of fossils. Many investigations have 

Ae 
attempted this integration (e.g., Crane 1985; Doyle and 
Donoghue 1986; Doyle 1996, 1998a,b, 2001, 2006, 
2008, 2012; Frohlich 1999; Donoghue and Doyle 2000; 
Hilton and Bateman 2006; Magallén 2010); we cover 
these analyses in more detail later in this chapter. Despite 
these efforts, the integration of fossils into studies of seed 
plant phylogeny remains an area where more research is 
needed. Seed plant relationships and the closest relatives 
of the angiosperms have been the focus of many reviews 
(e.g., Crane 1985; Doyle and Donoghue 1986; Doyle 
1996, 1998a, b, 2001, 2006, 2008, 2012; Frohlich 1999; 
Donoghue and Doyle 2000; Mathews 2009; Friis et al. 
2011) and continue to spawn new analyses (e.g., Hilton 
and Bateman 2006; Doyle 2008, 2012; Magallén 2010; 
Mathews et al. 2010). We will consider seed plant rela- 
tionships in general (living and extinct), but a major focus 
of this chapter is discussing the closest relative(s) of the 
angiosperms. 
PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES: 
EXTANT TAXA 
We first review the considerable effort devoted to recon- 
structing the phylogeny of living seed plants. Given the im- 
mense debate regarding the relationships of Gnetales, we 
also provide a brief history of the placement of Gnetales 
relative to the angiosperms. We then focus on cladistic 
analyses that include fossil as well as extant seed plants. 
Molecules and morphology have so far yielded different 
conclusions about the relationships of Gnetales and angio- 
sperms. Whereas analyses of morphology have consistently 
placed Gnetales sister to angiosperms (but see review by 
Rothwell et al. 2009), molecular data support alternative 
placements (see below). We are strong advocates for the use 
of morphology in phylogenetic analyses. However, based 
on the morphological characters so far used, the coding 
employed, and analyses now available, one could legiti- 
mately conclude that to this point seed plants represent an 
example in which cladistic analyses of morphological char- 
acters alone have failed to resolve major relationships in 
congruence with molecular-informed analyses. 
PLACEMENT OF GNETALES 
A close relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales was 
first proposed by Wettstein (1907) and by Arber and Par- 
kin (1908) based on several shared features: vessels, net- 
veined leaves (present in Gnetum as well as angiosperms), 
Relationships of Angiosperms

and “flower-like” reproductive organs (Fig. 1.1) (see also 
reviews by Doyle 1996; Frohlich 1999). However, the rea- 
soning that Wettstein (1907) and Arber and Parkin (1908) 
each used to explain the close relationship of Gnetales 
and angiosperms differed dramatically. Wettstein (1907) 
proposed that Gnetales were ancestral to the angiosperms 
based on the view that the formerly recognized angiosperm 
group Amentiferae, a group that included wind-pollinated 
taxa such as Juglandaceae, Betulaceae, and Casuarina- 
ceae, are the most “primitive” living angiosperms. We 
stress throughout that which extant group exhibits the 
most “primitive” morphological traits and which is sister 
to all others are not equivalent, but these statements are 
often confounded. We can infer ancestral character states 
via character-state reconstruction using the best estimate 
of phylogeny, as we have done throughout (Chapter 6). 
Wettstein maintained that the distinctive inflorescences 
(termed aments) of Amentiferae, consisting of simple, uni- 
sexual flowers, are homologous with the unisexual strobili 
of Gnetales. Arber and Parkin (1908) also proposed a close 
relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales, but, in contrast, 
argued that the reproductive structures of Gnetales are not 
primitively simple, but reduced, derived from ancestral lin- 
eages having more parts. 
By the mid-1900s, most authors no longer considered 
Gnetales and angiosperms closest relatives. Bailey (1944b, 
1953) noted that the vessels in the two groups are derived 
from different kinds of tracheids and hence are not homo- 
logous. In addition, Gnetales bear ovules directly on a 
stem tip, whereas in angiosperms, the ovules are produced 
within the carpel, the latter structure possibly represent- 
ing a modified leaf. Views on the earliest angiosperms also 
changed, with Magnoliaceae and other angiosperms with 
large, strobiloid flowers considered most ancient, whereas 
the simple flowers found in Amentiferae were consid- 
ered secondarily reduced rather than ancestrally simple 
(e.g., Arber and Parkin 1907; Cronquist 1968; Takhtajan 
1969). This new view disrupted the link between Gnetales 
and angiosperms (via a basal Amentiferae) envisioned by 
Wettstein. 
Issues became more complex when Eames (1952) pro- 
posed that the three lineages of Gnetales were not mono- 
phyletic. Eames considered Ephedra to be related to the 
fossil group Cordaites and conifers while Gnetum and 
Welwitschia were thought to be closer to another extinct 
lineage of seed plants, Bennettitales. Although morphology 
and DNA later confirmed the monophyly of Gnetales (be- 
low), the work of Eames (1952) shifted interest away from 
Gnetales as an angiosperm relative. Concomitantly, paleo- 
botanists focused attention on fossils such as Caytonia and 
Glossopteridales as the closest relatives of angiosperms

(Doyle 1996; Frohlich 1999; see below), further diverting 
attention from Gnetales as possible close relatives of the an- 
giosperms. Gnetales re-emerged, however, as putative close 
relatives of angiosperms when cladistic approaches were 
first used to investigate seed plant relationships (below). 
THE ANTHOPHYTE HYPOTHESIS 
Seed plant relationships were first assessed by cladistic 
methodology using morphological characters in thé 1980s. 
Several of these early studies included both extant and fossil 
taxa (e.g., Crane 1985; Doyle and Donoghue 1986). These 
studies revealed that the three morphologically disparate 
members of Gnetales (Ephedra, Gnetum, and Welwitschia) 
are monophyletic (illustrated in Fig. 1.1), a finding now 
well supported by both morphology and molecules. Only

Nixon et al. (1994) found Gnetales not to be monophyletic. 
However, Doyle’s (1996) subsequent reanalysis of the data 
used in Nixon et al. (1994) found a monophyletic Gnetales. 
Early phylogenetic studies relying on morphological 
characters (Parenti 1980; Hill and Crane 1982; Crane 
1985; Doyle and Donoghue 1986) recovered Gnetales as 
the closest living relatives of angiosperms (Fig. 1.2). Per- 
haps the best known is Crane (1985), which also included 
fossil seed plants. Crane (1985) recovered Gnetales as the 
sister group to angiosperms (Fig. 1.3). Subsequent phylo- 
genetic analyses of morphological characters (e.g., Loconte 
and Stevenson 1990; Doyle and Donoghue 1992; Doyle 
1994, 1996; Hilton and Bateman 2006), some of which 
also included fossils, continued to recover this Gnetales + 
angiosperm relationship (Fig. 1.2); as summarized by Roth- 
well et al. (2009; p. 296), “the anthophyte topology of the 
seed plant tree continues to be supported by morphological 
analyses of living and extinct taxa.” 
However, these same early cladistic studies often differed 
in the relationships suggested among extant seed plants 
(see Fig. 1.2). In morphological cladistic analyses, extant 
gymnosperms do not form a clade distinct from the an- 
giosperms, and the positions of some lineages were unsta- 
ble. Considering extant seed plant lineages, Crane (1985) 
found that cycads are sister to other extant seed plants and 
that conifers 
+ Ginkgo form a clade that is sister to an- 
giosperms + Gnetales (Fig. 1.2A). In contrast, the shortest 
trees of Doyle and Donoghue (1986) indicated that coni- 
fers + Ginkgo are sister to a clade in which cycads are the 
sister to angiosperms + Gnetales (Fig. 1.2B). Loconte and 
Stevenson (1990) found cycads followed by Ginkgo, then 

6 Chapter 1 
conifers, to be subsequent sisters to Gnetales + angiosperms 
(Fig. 1.2C). 
Crane (1985) conducted two cladistic analyses of extant 
and fossil seed plants and in one analysis recovered a clade 
of Bennettitales, Pentoxylon, and Gnetales + angiosperms; 
a second analysis recovered a clade of Glossopteridales, 
Caytonia, corystosperms, Bennettitales + Pentoxylon, and 
Gnetales + angiosperms (Fig. 1.3). Doyle and Donoghue 
(1986, 1992) similarly found shortest trees in which Gne- 
tales and angiosperms appeared in a clade with the fossil 
taxa Bennettitales and Pentoxylon. However, when fossil 
lineages were considered, Gnetales were not the immedi- 
ate sister group to angiosperms (Fig. 1.4). Angiosperms and 
then Pentoxylon and Bennettitales were subsequent sisters 
to Gnetales (Fig. 1.4). Doyle and Donoghue (1986) named 
this clade of angiosperms, Gnetales, Bennettitales, and 
Pentoxylon the “anthophytes” in reference to the flower- 
like reproductive structures shared by all members (see 
Fig. 1.1 for Gnetales and sections below for fossil groups). 
Rothwell and Serbet (1994) later recovered the same an- 
thophyte clade. The repeated recognition of this clade re- 
sulted in the formulation of the anthophyte hypothesis— 
that angiosperms are sister to Gnetales within a clade that 
also included Bennettitales and Pentoxylon. As reviewed 
below, the anthophyte hypothesis subsequently influenced 
interpretation of character evolution in seed plants and 
thus had a profound and long impact on studies of angio- 
sperm evolution. 
Doyle and Donoghue (1992) and Doyle (1996) recov- 
ered Glossopteridales and then Caytonia as subsequent sis- 
ters to their anthophyte clade (see Doyle 1996). However, 
Doyle (1996) did not expand the definition of the antho- 
phyte clade to include Caytonia or Glossopteridales. This

ultimately resulted in confusion given that in most subse- 
quent studies (reviewed below), phylogenetic analyses con- 
sistently recovered a revised or modified anthophyte clade 
that includes Glossopteridales, Caytonia, Pentoxylon, and 
Bennettitales as sister groups to the angiosperms, but with 
Gnetales more distantly related (e.g., Hilton and Bateman 
2006; Magall6én 2010; Doyle 2008, 2012). For clarity, we 
refer to this modified or revised anthophyte clade as the 
“para-angiophytes” (see Doyle 2012), encompassing Glos- 
sopteridales, Caytonia, Pentoxylon, Bennettitales, and an- 
giosperms, but not Gnetales (see below). Hilton and Bate- 
man (2006) refer to this same clade as the “glossophytes.” 
Earlier (pre-cladistic) investigations had also pointed to 
most of these same fossil groups as close relatives of an- 
giosperms. Arber and Parkin (1907) proposed that Ben- 
nettitales and angiosperms shared a common ancestor. 
Several early workers also suggested Caytonia as a close 
angiosperm relative (Thomas 1925; Harris 1941; Gaussen 
1946; see also Stebbins 1974; Doyle 1978). Stebbins (1974) 
and Retallack and Dilcher (1981) pointed to similarities 
between Glossopteridales and angiosperms. 
Although the anthophyte clade as originally defined by 
Doyle and Donoghue (1992) remained a focal point of 
study and controversy for about 15 years, the close rela- 
tionship inferred between Gnetales and angiosperms was 
not well supported in any morphological cladistic analy- 
sis. Doyle and Donoghue (1986, 1992), for example, found 
topological differences in trees that were only one or two 
steps longer than the shortest trees they obtained (i.e., sub- 
optimal trees). In some trees only one step longer than the 
shortest trees, angiosperms appeared as sister to Caytonia 
and Glossopteridales, rather than with Gnetales, Bennet- 
titales, and Pentoxylon. In other one-step-longer trees, the 
anthophyte clade was retained, but relationships among 
anthophyte taxa varied (Doyle and Donoghue 1992; re- 
viewed in Doyle 1996). In some studies, Gnetales appeared 
sister to the angiosperms even when data for fossils were 
included (e.g., Crane 1985), whereas in others (e.g., Doyle 
and Donoghue 1986) the sister relationship between Gne- 
tales and angiosperms emerged only when the fossils were 
removed. Another fossil group that may deserve more at- 
tention is Erdtmanithecales, a fossil group putatively closely 
related to Gnetales or Bennettitales (Friis et al. 2007, 2011), 
although the group is contentious (Rothwell et al. 2009). 
One limitation of early cladistic studies of morphol- 
ogy is that investigators often treated the angiosperms as a 
single terminal rather than employing multiple representa- 
tives. This approach required assumptions about the ances- 
tral states of the angiosperms. Criticism of this approach 
prompted additional analyses in which several different, 
putatively basal angiosperm lineages were represented 
(e.g., Doyle et al. 1994; Nixon et al. 1994; Doyle 1996, 

1998a). Although the sister relationship of Gnetales and 
angiosperms was again recovered in these analyses, strong 
bootstrap support for this relationship was still lacking, 
and suboptimal trees again included diverse topologies (the 
importance of suboptimal trees is noted in Chapter 3). 
Despite the lack of internal support and some concerns 
regarding character homology, the anthophyte hypothesis 
quickly became widely accepted. Concomitantly, accep- 
tance of the anthophyte hypothesis and a sister relation- 
ship between angiosperms and Gnetales had a profound 
and broad impact. This acceptance stimulated the reinter- 
pretation of character evolution in angiosperms (reviewed 
in Frohlich 1999; Donoghue and Doyle 2000; Soltis et al. 
2005b, 2008b; Doyle 2008, 2012), including the origin of 
the carpel, the angiosperm leaf (Doyle 1994, 1998a), and 
double fertilization (Friedman 1990, 1992, 1994). For 
example, the “double fertilization” process in Gnetales 
was considered a possible precursor to the double fertil- 
ization of angiosperms (Friedman 1990, 1992, 1994) and 
ultimately a putative synapomorphy for Gnetales + angio- 
sperms (Doyle 1996). 
DEMISE OF THE ANTHOPHYTE 
HYPOTHESIS 
Numerous studies (molecular and molecular + morpho- 
logical) have tried to resolve the relationships among liv- 
ing seed plants—cycads, Ginkgo, Gnetales, conifers, and 
angiosperms—with the caveat that some analyses were 
much broader in scope, focusing on all land plants or all 
green plants (e.g., Hamby and Zimmer 1992; Albert et al. 
1994; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Goremykin et al. 1996; Malek 
et al. 1996; Chaw et al. 1997, 2000; Qiu et al. 1999; Bowe 
et al. 2000; Nickrent et al. 2000; Magallon and Sanderson 
2002; D. Soltis et al. 2002b, 2005b; Burleigh and Mathews 
2004; Rydin et al. 2002; Rai et al. 2008; Hajibabaei et al. 
2006; Hilton and Bateman 2006; Wu et al. 2007; Zhong 
et al. 2010; Magallon 2010; Finet et al. 2010; Lee et al. 
2011; reviewed in Doyle 2008, 2012). Although consid- 
erable progress has been made in resolving relationships 
(reviewed below), these studies yielded a diversity of re- 
sults, which highlights the difficulties inherent in resolv- 
ing relationships among extant seed plants, as well as seed 
plants in general (reviewed in Burleigh and Mathews 2004; 
Mathews 2009; Soltis et al. 2005b, 2008b; Doyle 2008, 
2012). In this section, we summarize the many molecular 
phylogenetic analyses of seed plants and discuss the uncer- 
tain position of Gnetales, as well as our best current esti- 
mate of phylogeny among extant seed plants. 
Numerous molecular and morphological phylogenetic 
Relationships of Angiosperms

studies have provided strong support for the monophyly 
of Gnetales, despite the pronounced morphological dif- 
ferences among the three genera Ephedra, Gnetum, and 
Welwitschia (e.g., Hamby and Zimmer 1992; Hasebe et al. 
1992; Chase et al. 1993; Albert et al. 1994; Goremykin et al. 
1996; Chaw et al. 1997, 2000; Stefanovic¢ et al. 1998; Han- 
sen et al. 1999; Winter et al. 1999; Qiu et al. 1999; P. Soltis 
et al. 1999a,b; Bowe et al. 2000; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2007c, 
2011; Burleigh and Mathews 2004; Magallon 2010; Zhong 
et al. 2010). The fossil record has brought forth additional 
extinct genera, indicating a greater diversity of the Gnetales 
during the Mesozoic (Crane and Upchurch 1987; Friis et al. 
2011). However, ascertaining the relationships of Gnetales 
to other seed plants, as well as determining seed plant rela- 
tionships in general, has been more problematic. Nonethe- 
less, a close relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales has 
not been recovered by molecular studies. 
As single-gene phylogenetic trees began to appear, it be- 
came apparent that they did not support placement of Gne- 
tales as sister to the angiosperms, although the position of 
Gnetales among other seed plant lineages varied from study 
to study. Single-gene investigations of plastid (ITS, rpoC1), 
nuclear (18S rDNA), and mitochondrial (cox1) sequences 
indicated a sister-group relationship between Gnetales and 
conifers (Fig. 1.5). Some analyses of rbcL alone and some 
analyses of 18S and 26S rRNA sequences placed Gnetales 
as sister to all other seed plants, with angiosperms as sis- 
ter to the remaining gymnosperms (i.e., a clade of cycads, 
Ginkgo, and conifers; Hamby and Zimmer 1992; Albert 
et al. 1994; Fig. 1.5A). One parsimony analysis of rbcL 
placed angiosperms as sister to a clade of gymnosperms; 
within the latter clade, Gnetales were sister to cycads plus 
(Ginkgo + conifers) (Hasebe et al. 1992; Fig. 1.5B). Maxi- 
mum likelihood analysis of rbcL also placed angiosperms 
as sister to the monophyletic gymnosperms, but relation- 
ships among gymnosperms were different than in the par- 
simony topology (Hasebe et al. 1992; compare Figs. 1.5C 
and 1.5B). A study using partial 26S rDNA data (Stefanovié 
et al. 1998) did recover a topology with angiosperms sister 
to Gnetales, but subsequent analyses with more complete 
26S rDNA data did not recover this same topology (e.g., 
Soltis et al. 2011). 
Few of these single-gene studies provided strong internal 
support for relationships. As exceptions, two analyses of 
18S rDNA sequences provided some support for a Gne- 
tales + conifers sister-group relationship, with bootstrap 
percentages of 84 and 64, depending on size of the dataset 
(Fig. 1.5, E and F; Chaw et al. 1997; P. Soltis et al. 1999b). 
However, few other studies using single genes provided 
support > 60% for relationships (Fig. 1.5). Other early 
DNA sequence analyses provided additional evidence for 
the monophyly of the living gymnosperms and for a close

relationship of Gnetales and conifers. However, taxon sam- 
pling in early studies was often sparse (e.g., Hansen et al. 
1999; Winter et al. 1999; Frohlich and Parker 2000). For 
example, Hansen et al. (1999) obtained sequence data for 
a 9.5-kb portion of the plastid genome, but included only 
Pinus, Gnetum, and three angiosperms, and used Mar- 
chantia (a liverwort, distantly related to seed plants) as the 
outgroup. 
Despite limitations of single-gene studies, the antho- 
phyte hypothesis was not supported. However, because 
sample sizes were often small and internal support low, 
these analyses were considered equivocal (Doyle 1998a; 
Donoghue and Doyle 2000). Nonetheless, the results of 
these single-gene analyses posed a serious challenge to the 
widespread acceptance of the anthophyte hypothesis. 
The lack of support for Gnetales + angiosperms in- 
creased with the addition of taxa and the use of multiple 
genes (see reviews by Doyle 2008, 2012). Analyses in which 
multiple genes were combined (Fig. 1.6) have repeatedly in- 
dicated, with strong support, that Gnetales are not closely 
related to angiosperms (e.g., Qiu et al. 1999; P. Soltis et al. 
1999a; Bowe et al. 2000; Chaw et al. 2000; Graham and

Magallon 2010; Lee et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014). These 
molecular analyses resulted in the rapid demise of the an- 
thophyte hypothesis. However, the placement of Gnetales 
varied among these analyses. Also, gymnosperm taxon 
sampling was sparse in studies aimed at the angiosperms 
(e.g., Qiu et al. 1999; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; D. Soltis et al. 
2000, 2007c, 2011; Graham and Oimstead 2000) or vas- 
cular plants (Pryer et al. 2001), or all land plants (e.g., Qiu 
et al. 2007), or even all green plants (e.g., Wickett et al. 
2014; Ruhfel et al. 2014). 
To summarize, although many different topologies have 
now been obtained for extant seed plants, several features 
typically are recovered. Angiosperms are sister to extant 
gymnosperms; among gymnosperms, cycads or cycads plus 
Ginkgo are sister to the remainder. Placement of Gnetales 
remains problematic; four hypotheses typically emerge 
from multi-gene datasets (Fig. 1.6 A-D). Gnetales are 1) sis- 

ter to all other seed plants, as in some analyses of D. Soltis 
et al. (2002b), Burleigh and Mathews (2004), and Magal- 
lon and Sanderson (2002); 2) sister to all conifers (Gnet- 
ifer hypothesis), as in some analyses of Chaw et al. (2000), 
some analyses of D. Soltis et al. (2002b), Rydin et al. 
(2002), and S. A. Smithvet al. (2010); 3) within conifers, sis- 
ter to Pinaceae (Gne-pine hypothesis, which was first seen 
in single-gene trees, such as Chaw et al. 1997; P. Soltis et al. 
1999a), as in Qiu et al. (1999), Bowe et al. (2000), some 
analyses of D. Soltis et al. (2002b), some analyses of Bur- 
leigh and Mathews (2004), Chaw et al. (2000), Hajibabaei 
et al. (2006), Magallon (2010), some analyses of Zhong 
et al. (2010), and Wickett et al. (2014); and 4) within co- 
nifers, sister to cupressophytes or conifers other than Pina- 
ceae (the Gne-cup hypothesis), as in Nickrent et al. (2000), 
some analyses of Zhong et al. (2010), Doyle (2006), and 
Ruhfel et al. (2014). 
Other, more unusual, relationships based on DNA se- 
quence data have sometimes been recovered for extant gym- 
nosperms, such as cycads + angiosperms (Mathews et al. 
2010). The molecular-only analysis of Magallén (2010) 
recovered a Gne-pine tree. However, a cycad + angiosperm 
relationship was obtained in a maximum parsimony total

evidence analysis (DNA + morphology) of living and fossil 
seed plants, but only if fossils were subsequently removed 
from the tree (Magall6n 2010) (Fig. 1.7; the fossils Glos- 
sopteridales, Pentoxylon, Bennettitales, and Caytonia are 
immediate sisters to angiosperms, followed by cycads). Sev- 
eral studies of numerous nuclear genes suggested a place- 
ment of Gnetales as sister to all other living gymnosperms, 
with angiosperms still sister to all living gymnosperms (de 
la Torre-Barcena et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011). However, 
both analyses have important caveats (see below). 
Most molecular phylogenetic studies (and molecular + 
morphology) suggest that Gnetales were derived from 
within conifers and are sister to Pinaceae (Gne-pine). 
Analyses of 18S rDNA alone first recovered this topology 
with BS > 50% (Chaw et al. 1997; P. Soltis et al. 1999b). 
Multi-gene analyses subsequently recovered this topology 
(Fig. 1.6), including Qiu et al. (1999, 2007), Bowe et al. 
(2000), Chaw et al. (2000), Burleigh and Mathews (2004, 
2007), Magallén (2010), and Wickett et al. (2014). Bowe 
et al. (2000) analyzed a four-gene dataset (rbcL, 18S rDNA, 
and mitochondrial atpA and cox1) and found strong sup- 
port for Pinaceae + Gnetales. Analysis of combined se-

rDNA, and rbcL similarly provided strong internal support 
for Gnetales + Pinaceae (Chaw et al. 2000; Fig. 1.6). An 
eight-gene analysis (D. Soltis et al. 2002b), involving four 
plastid genes, three mtDNA genes, and one nuclear gene, 
also provided strong support for Gnetales + Pinaceae. Qiu 
et al. (2007) examined seven plastid genes, three mtDNA 
genes, and nuclear 18S rDNA from 192 land plants and 
found Gnetales sister to Pinaceae, but with low support 
(BS = 67%). Burleigh and Mathews (2004) examined a 13- 
gene dataset representing all three genomes using various 
partitioning schemes and methods of analysis (see below). 
ML analyses of the combined datasets and from each parti- 
tion recovered well-supported Gne-pine trees. Removal of 
rapidly evolving sites also favored Gne-pine trees. 
Although multiple analyses of plastid, mitochondrial, 
and nuclear genes support the Gne-pine hypothesis, most 
molecular studies of seed plants included few conifers. 
With a dataset that included 15 conifers and 13 loci, 
Burleigh and Mathews (2004) found strong support for 
Gnetales + Pinaceae. However, Rydin et al. (2002), using 
30 conifers and a four-gene dataset, found strong support 
for Gnetales as sister to conifers (Gnet-ifer hypothesis) (see 
Rydin and Korall 2009), suggesting that the Gne-pine hy- 
pothesis might be an artifact of inadequate taxon sampling. 
Furthermore, use of the parametric bootstrap in analyses of 
a dataset involving many base pairs but few taxa revealed 
that the placement of Gnetales as sister to conifers (rather 
than as sister to Pinaceae) could not be rejected (D. Soltis 
et al. 2002b). 
A structural mutation in the plastid genome (Raubeson 
and Jansen 1992) also indicates that a Gnetales-conifer 
sister-group relationship may be a more parsimonious ex- 
planation of the data than a placement of Gnetales within 
conifers. Most land plants, including Gnetales, have two 
copies of the ribosomal genes in the plastid genome (the 
inverted repeat region), but conifers have only a single ri- 
bosomal coding region. Placement of Gnetales within co- 
nifers (e.g., either Gne-pine or Gne-cup) would necessitate 
that the ribosomal genes were lost in the conifers and then 
subsequently regained in Gnetales, which is less parsimo- 
nious. However, Wu and Chaw (2014) recently proposed 
independent losses of the inverted repeat in Pinaceae and 
cupressophytes. 
Some fossil evidence also supports a close relationship 
of Gnetales and conifers (Wang 2004). However, most 
morphological and anatomical characters are so differ- 
ent between these groups that morphological data to this 
point have had little impact in resolving these relationships. 
Nonetheless, we stress that the Gne-pine hypothesis would . 
necessitate either that the cone evolved twice (once in Pina- 
ceae, and again in all other conifers) or that the cone was 
lost in Gnetales. The cone is a fairly complex morphologi- 
cal structure (with bracts associated with ovulate scales), 
and there is no indication that such a structure is present 
in the very different reproductive axes of Gnetales. Thus, in 
some ways morphology argues more strongly for the Gnet- 
ifer hypothesis. 
The Gne-cup topology (Fig. 1.6) was recovered by Nick- 
rent et al. (2000), Zhong et al. (2010), and Ruhfel et al. 
(2014). The last study employed nearly complete plastid 
genomes for 360 species of green plants, or Viridiplantae, 
including 311 seed plants. Ruhfel et al. (2014) found strong 
support for a placement of Gnetales with Cupressaceae 
(BS = 87%) and BS = 100% for a sister group of this Gne- 
cup clade with all remaining conifers. As a point of caution, 
however, Zhong et al. (2010) suggested in another analysis 
of plastid genomes (but with limited taxon sampling) that 
support for Gne-cup may be the result of long-branch at- 
traction; by removing rapidly evolving proteins, support 
for Gne-cup decreased (see also Yang and Rannala 2012). 
Furthermore, by removing what they considered parallel 
substitutions between lineages leading to Gnetales and to 
Cryptomeria (the sole cupressophyte in their analyses), a 
Gne-pine topology was recovered by Zhong et al. (2010). 

Trees based on large numbers of nuclear genes (de la 
Torre-Barcena et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011; Wickett et al. 
2014) merit more discussion. The first two of these stud- 
ies recovered Gnetales sister to all other living gymno- 
sperms—an unusual placement. However, de la Torre- 
Barcena et al. (2009) employed only 16 taxa. Using a large 
number of nuclear genes (22,833 sets of orthologs) from 
101 land plant genera, Lee et al. (2011) found strong sup- 
port for Gnetales sister to remaining all gymnosperms 
([cycads + Ginkgo] + conifers); this gymnosperm clade is 
then sister to angiosperms. In another independent analysis 
of hundreds of nuclear genes, Wickett et al. (2014) found 
strong support for the monophyly of extant gymnosperms 
and for the Gne-pine hypothesis. The Lee et al. (2011) data- 
set is characterized by extensive missing data, whereas in 
Wickett et al. (2014), more data cells are filled; this differ- 
ence could result in different topologies. 
Resolving seed plant relationships with DNA data is 
difficult because the signal in datasets may be complex. 
Sanderson et al. (2000), Magallon and Sanderson (2002), 
and Rydin et al. (2002) reported conflict between first and 
second versus third codon positions in plastid genes. Al- 
though third codon positions of plastid genes generally 
have most of the phylogenetic signal (e.g., Kallersj6 et al. 
1998; Olmstead et al. 1998), the third positions may be 
saturated in some instances (Rydin et al. 2002), depend- 
ing on taxon sampling. These results may also reflect short 
branches within the seed plant radiation, as well as high 
rates of molecular evolution in Gnetales and the outgroups 
(reviewed in Palmer et al. 2004). Adding to the complexity 
of the conflict between first plus second versus third posi- 
tions is the fact that transitions within each codon posi- 
tion conflict with transversions (Chaw et al. 2000; Rydin 
et al. 2002). Conflicting signal in the datasets could also 
be explained by differences in trees obtained with rapidly 
versus slowly evolving sites. Burleigh and Mathews (2004) 
found that trees in which Gnetales are sister to all other 
seed plants appear to be the result of signal in the most rap- 
idly evolving sites, whereas when these sites are excluded, 
Gne-pine trees are obtained. 
Given the diversity of studies, in both genes and taxa, as 
well as the diversity of results, can we make any firm state- 
ments regarding the position of Gnetales? In addition, what 
do most analyses suggest regarding extant seed plant rela- 
tionships in general? Most analyses now favor some type of 
a relationship of Gnetales with conifers—a close relation- 
ship with angiosperms can be ruled out. Many analyses, 
including those of numerous nuclear genes (e.g., Wickett 
et al. 2014), as well as studies involving particularly rig- 
orous examination of the underlying molecular data and 
signal (e.g., Burleigh and Mathews 2004), appear to favor 
Relationships of Angiosperms 
11 
Gne-pine. However, the largest plastid datasets so far em- 
ployed favor Gne-cup (e.g., Ruhfel et al. 2014), so different 
genomes may be telling different stories. 
Can we provide any firm summary regarding the over- 
all picture of relationships among extant seed plants (see 
Fig. 1.6)? It is clear that angiosperms appear sister to a 
clade of extant gymnosperms. Within living gymnosperms, 
cycads and Ginkgo are then sisters to conifers + Gnetales, 
but the exact placement of Gnetales to the conifers re- 
mains unclear. Similarly, the relationship between cycads 
and Ginkgo also remains uncertain. Some analyses indicate 
that cycads and Ginkgo are successive sisters to other living 
gymnosperms (e.g., Burleigh and Matthews 2004, 2007; 
Graham and Iles 2009; Nickrent et al. 2000; Qiu et al. 
2007; Ran et al. 2010), often with strong internal support. 
Other analyses indicate, however, that cycads and Ginkgo 
form a clade that is sister to other living gymnosperms. In- 
ternal support for the latter relationship is weak in some 
studies (e.g., Rydin and Ka4llersj6 2002; Qiu et al. 2006), 
but in other multigene analyses it is very strong (e.g., Wu 
et al. 2007: Finet et al. 2010; Zhong etal. 2010; Lee’et al. 
2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 2014). In still other 
studies, cycads and Ginkgo form a trichotomy with a clade 
of other living gymnosperms (Rydin and Korall 2009). 
Accordingly, we have depicted the relationship of cycads 
and Ginkgo as uncertain in a conservative summary tree 
(Fig. 1.6E). 
To summarize, a conservative phylogenetic tree for ex- 
tant seed plants (Fig. 1.6E) reveals major uncertainties. 
In fact, this overall summary tree is comparable to what 
was depicted more than a decade ago (Soltis et al. 2005Sb). 
Resolving seed plant relationships and the placement of 
Gnetales remains problematic, despite intensive study. As a 
caveat, although the number of base pairs included in seed 
plant analyses has steadily increased, taxon sampling has 
remained low in most of the analyses conducted to date, 
with a few noteworthy exceptions. This sparse sampling 
should be remedied in future studies. More problematic is 
the effect of taxa that cannot be sampled for DNA due to 
their extinction—a real problem in that most seed plant 
clades are extinct. 
Whereas living gymnosperms consistently appear mono- 
phyletic, gymnosperms as a whole (fossil and extant) are 
clearly paraphyletic (Figs. 1.6-1.9; Doyle 2006, 2012). 
Some extinct gymnosperm lineages attach along the branch 
to angiosperms, whereas others attach near the base of 
the seed plant tree. In recent analyses, an “acrogymno- 
sperm” clade (Acrogymnospermae; see Cantino et al. 2007) 
is recovered that includes some fossil gymnosperms as well 
as extant gymnosperms; 
a second subclade (sometimes 
called para-angiophytes) contains angiosperms and other

Figure 1.8. 
Revised views of the phylogeny of seed plants showing putative 
closest relatives of angiosperms obtained by using both the morphological ma- 
trix of Doyle (1996) and molecular data (reviewed in Soltis et al. 2005). A revised 
anthophyte clade—the para-angiophytes—is depicted. (A) Tree modified from 
Soltis et al. (2005), in which molecular data for seed plants are combined with 
the morphological matrix of Doyle (1996). (B). Tree modified from Doyle (2001), 
in which a molecular constraint was used, placing Gnetales with other extant 
gymnosperms. Redrawn from Soltis et al. (2008; Fig. 1). 
fossil gymnosperms 
(e.g., Caytoniales) 
(Figs. 
1.8-1.9). 
However, based on analyses conducted to date, fossil and 
seed plants as a whole (Spermatophyta) are monophyletic. 
MORPHOLOGY REVISITED 
Whereas cladistic analyses of morphological data have in- 
dicated that angiosperms and Gnetales are closest living 
relatives (albeit without strong support), most studies of 
DNA sequences and DNA plus morphology have placed 
Gnetales with conifers despite their obvious morphological 
differences. Doyle (1998a) initially attempted to reconcile 
this conflict, but as more molecular studies argued against a 
close relationship between Gnetales and angiosperms, such 
efforts diminished (Donoghue and Doyle 2000). 
It is instructive to reconsider those few characters that 
were thought to unite angiosperms and Gnetales in mor- 
phological cladistic analyses (Crane 1985; Doyle and 
Donoghue 1987, 1992; Loconte and Stevenson 
1990; 
Taylor and Hickey 1992; Nixon et al. 1994; Doyle 1996). 
Some of these features are actually shared by angiosperms, 
Gnetales, Bennettitales, Pentoxylon, and Caytoniales. As 
reviewed below, careful scrutiny leads to the conclusion 
that the homology of many of these shared characters is, 
in fact, dubious. 
Following Crane (1985), two key features unite angio- 
sperms, Gnetales, and Bennettitales and Pentoxylon: a dis- 
tinctively thin megaspore membrane and microsporophylls 
aggregated in a whorl, or pseudo-whorl, distinct from the 
helical arrangement in conifer and cycad pollen cones. 
Doyle and Donoghue evaluated the relationship between 
Gnetales and angiosperms in several papers (e.g., Doyle 
1978, 1994, 1996, 1998a,b; Doyle and Donoghue 1986, 
1992); we summarize here the non-DNA characters that 
support a sister group of Gnetales + angiosperms in Doyle’s 
(1996) analysis. Angiosperms and Gnetales share similar 
lignin chemistry (i.e., the presence of a Maule reaction, 
which is absent from other seed plants; McLean and Evans 
_. 
1934; Gibbs 1957), double fertilization, microsporangia 
fused at least basally, an embryo derived from a single uni- 
nucleate cell via cellular divisions, a thin megaspore wall 
(as in Crane 1985 and Loconte and Stevenson 1990), si- 
phonogamy, and a granular exine structure. Doyle (1996) 
also scored vessels in angiosperms and Gnetales as homol- 
ogous. Loconte and Stevenson (1990) analyzed only ex- 
tant taxa and provided three synapomorphies of Gnetales 
and angiosperms—thin megaspore wall (following Crane 
1985), short cambial initials, and lignin syringial groups 
(equivalent to the Maule reaction of Doyle 1996). 
Some putative synapomorphies for angiosperms and 
Gnetales from Crane (1985), Doyle (1996), and Loconte 
and Stevenson (1990) are more complex than initially sug- 
gested in these analyses and may in fact not be homolo- 
gous (see also Donoghue and Doyle 2000). For example, 
although the angiosperms and Gnetales were coded the 
same for the presence of a tunica layer in the vegetative 
shoot apex, the tunica is two cells thick in many angio- 
sperms and only one cell thick in Gnetales. Similarly, al- 
though angiosperms and Gnetales were coded as having 
the same state for the thickness of the megaspore wall, the 
megaspore wall is thin in Gnetales and absent in angio- 
sperms. The pollen exine character used in some studies is 
now known to be inappropriate because a granular exine 

is not ancestral in angiosperms, as once was hypothesized 
(e.g., Doyle and Endress 2000; Doyle 2001, 2009; see also 
Chapter 6). Furthermore, the homology of vessels in angio- 
sperms and Gnetales has long been doubted (Bailey 1944b, 
1953), and Carlquist (1996) concluded that they are not 
homologous. Angiosperms and Gnetales should therefore 
not be scored identically for these features of the tunica, 
megaspore, and vessel elements. The homology of double 
fertilization in angiosperms and Gnetales has also been 
questioned (see Friedman 1994, 1996; Doyle 1996, 2000), 
but this issue is complex. In most angiosperms, a second 
sperm nucleus fuses with two nuclei of the megagameto- 
phyte (producing triploid endosperm), whereas in Gnetales 
a second sperm fuses with only one nucleus of the mega- 
gametophyte, yielding a diploid nucleus. However, in the 
basal angiosperm clades Nymphaeales and Austrobailey- 
ales (but not Amborellaceae), a second sperm nucleus fuses 
with only a single megagametophyte nucleus (Chapter 4). 
Furthermore, double fertilization events that seem similar 
to those documented for Ephedra (Gnetales) have been re- 
ported for conifers, including Thuja and Abies (Friedman 
and Floyd 2001). In addition, developmental events in cy- 
cads and Ginkgo are consistent with double fertilization 
(reviewed in Friedman and Floyd 2001). Thus, double fer- 
tilization may be a synapomorphy for all extant seed plants 
(Friedman and Floyd 2001), although the formation of en- 
dosperm is an exclusively angiosperm feature. 
The anthophyte hypothesis continues to have an impact 
on interpretation of morphology. Friis et al. (2007) pro- 
posed a new synapomorphy for some of the traditional an- 
thophytes, namely Gnetales and Bennettitales. Using phase- 
contrast X-ray microtomography, they found a distinctive 
seed architecture shared by Gnetales and Bennettitales (as 
well as Erdtmanithecales, another putatively closely related 
fossil group). Friis et al. (2007) argued that this seed fea- 
ture “defines a clade containing these taxa.” Nearly all re- 
cent topologies indicate a distant relationship of Gnetales 
and Bennettitales (Figs. 1.8, 1.9) so in our view this seed 
feature may best be interpreted as homoplasious, having 
evolved independently in Gnetales and the Bennettitales 
(Ertmanithecales might, however, share a common origin 
of the feature with either of them). However, phylogenetic 
analysis using the seed plant matrix of Hilton and Bateman 
(2006) supports the grouping of Erdtmanithecales, Bennet- 
titales, and Gnetales (Friis et al. 2011, p. 104). 
INTEGRATING FOSSILS 
We now revisit the possible close relatives of the angio- 
sperms that are known from the fossil record. The im- 
Relationships of Angiosperms 
13 
portance of integrating fossils, and thus morphology, into 
datasets to understand the phylogeny of seed plants has 
long been noted and continues to be emphasized (e.g., 
Doyle 2006, 2008, 2012; Doyle and Donoghue 1987; Ken- 
rick and Crane 1997; Donoghue and Doyle 2000; Rydin 
et al. 2002; D. Soltis et al. 2002b, 2005b; Crane et al. 2004; 
Magallon 2010; Hilton and Bateman 2006; Mathews et al. 
2010). Even if DNA sequence data largely resolved rela- 
tionships among living seed plant groups (this is not the 
case; see above), a complete understanding of seed plant 
relationships and the origins of angiosperm structures 
such as floral organs still requires the integration of fossil 
taxa because the extinct taxa can affect the phylogenetic 
placement of extant taxa. Relationships among lineages 
of anthophytes have varied among studies depending on 
whether or not fossils were included. In some cases, Gne- 
tales were sister to the angiosperms even when fossils were 
included (e.g., Crane 1985); in other analyses, the sister 
relationship between Gnetales and angiosperms appeared 
only when fossils were removed from the matrix (e.g., 
Doyle and Donoghue 1986). 
Significantly, most phylogenetic analyses that include 
fossils (whether morphology or morphology 
+ DNA) 
reveal the same cast of characters as close, now extinct, 
relatives of the angiosperms: Glossopteridales, Pentoxy- 
lon, Bennettitales, and Caytoniales (D. Soltis et al. 2005b, 
2008b), referred to as the para-angiophytes (Doyle 2012; 
Fig. 1.8). Initial studies of morphology alone placed Ben- 
nettitales and Pentoxylon as subsequent sisters to angio- 
sperms + Gnetales (Crane 1985; Doyle and Donoghue 
1986, 1992; Rothwell and Serbet 1994). Doyle (1996) 
found Caytonia sister to Pentoxylon, followed by Glos- 
sopteridales as sister to Gnetales + angiosperms. However, 
other studies suggest that Caytoniales are the immediate 
sister to angiosperms, with Bennettitales sister to this clade. 
Doyle (2001, 2008) and Soltis et al. (2005b) constructed a 
molecular scaffold on the basis of molecular phylogenetic 
analyses, constraining Gnetales to be sister to the conifers, 
and then analyzed Doyle’s (1996) original morphological 
matrix. Both found a revised anthophyte clade of angio- 
sperms + Caytonia, Bennettitales, and Pentoxylon, with 
Glossopteridales sister to the remaining members of this 
expanded anthophyte clade (Fig. 1.8). Other studies using 
morphology (Hilton and Bateman 2006), and morphol- 
ogy + DNA (Magallon 2010) (Fig. 1.7), plus studies using 
a molecular backbone for the living taxa (fixing Gnetales 
in a Gne-pine position; Doyle 2008, 2012) (Fig. 1.9), also 
have recovered a para-angiophyte clade with Pentoxylon + 
Glossopteridales sister to Bennettitales, followed by Cay- 
toniales, with the last the immediate sister to angiosperms 
(Fig. 1.9).

PARA-ANGIOPHYTES: A NEW LOOK 
AT CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
The phylogenetic results reviewed above are crucial for re- 
constructing morphological evolution of the angiosperms. 
Topologies that recover the para-angiophyte clade are con- 
sistent with the hypothesis that the cupule of Glossopteri- 
dales and Caytonia is homologous with the outer integu- 
ment of the angiosperm bitegmic ovule (reviewed in Doyle 
2006, 2008, 2012) (Figs. 1.10, 1.11), a hypothesis that had 
been proposed much earlier (e.g., Gaussen 1946; Stebbins 
1974; Doyle 1978). To review, whereas angiosperm ovules 
generally have two protective layers (integuments), all gym- 
nosperm ovules have a single integument (Fig. 1.10). [Some 
angiosperms, such as asterids, have only a single integu- 
ment due either to loss of an integument or to fusion of 
the two integuments (Endress 2011a; see Chapters 11, 14).] 
Furthermore, the gymnosperm micropyle is located oppo- 
site the stalk bearing the ovule (except in Podocarpaceae),

Seed plant phylogenetic tree (from analysis of morphological data of Doyle 2008) with the relationships of living gymnosperms constrained to show a 
whereas in many angiosperms, the ovule is curved back on 
itself with the micropyle close to the stalk (i.e., anatropous 
rather than orthotropous; Fig. 1.10B). Angiosperm ovule 
types are reviewed in Chapter 4 (see Fig. 4.8). 
To address the origin of the outer integument of the 
angiosperm ovule, Doyle (2012) reconstructed the evo- 
lution of the ovule-bearing surface across a phylogenetic 
tree for fossil and extant seed plants (Fig. 1.9); we sum- 
marize his findings here. In Caytonia and Glossopteridales, 
the ovule-bearing surface is the adaxial or upper surface, 
whereas in those other seed plants that have been consid- 
ered angiosperm ancestors, such as peltasperms and corys- 
tosperms, ovules are borne on the abaxial surface (under- 
side) (Fig. 1.11). Other seed plants bear ovules in an apical 
or marginal position. Hence, the reconstruction of Doyle 
(2012) is consistent with the hypothesis that the second 
or outer integument of angiosperms is homologous with 
the cupule in Caytonia and Glossopteridales—with the cu- 
pule in these plants representing a leaf or leaf segment with 
ovules on the upper surface.

The cupule of Caytonia is similar to the bitegmic ovule of 
flowering plants (Stebbins 1974; Doyle 2012). The shape of 
the Caytonia cupule resembles an anatropous ovule in an- 
giosperms (compare Figs. 1.11, 1.12; see below). The Cay- 
tonia cupule contains multiple ovules, however, so ovule 
number would have been reduced to one with the origin of 
the angiosperms (see Stebbins 1974). Doyle (2012) further

noted that in Glossopteridales, the cupule is “most easily 
interpreted” as a fertile leaf “borne on an axillary branch 
that is adnate to the subtending leaf”; in contrast, cupules 
in Caytonia have been interpreted as leaflets borne along 
the rachis of a compound leaf (see Stebbins 1974; Doyle 
1978; Retallack and Dilcher 1981; Doyle 1978, 2012).

Putative reconstruction of ovule evolution using topology shown in Figure 1.9. Diagrams show ovulate structures in glossopeterids and Caytonia as 
well as an ascidiate angiosperm carpel. Abaxial surfaces are shown in black; ovules are borne on the adaxial surface in glossopterids, Caytonia, and angiosperms, 
but not in acrogymnosperms. Based on this reconstruction, the angiosperm bitegmic ovule and carpel may be derived from ovulate structures in glossopterids and 
Caytonia; see text (taken from Doyle 2012). 

16 Chapter 1 
reproductive structures of this group show no clear relation 
to structures in these other plants (see Doyle 2012 and sec- 
tion on Bennettitales below). 
Doyle (2008, 2012) also used these same phylogenetic 
results to attempt to infer the homology of the angiosperm 
stamen. Using the current “best” topology for angiosperms 
(chapter 3), which has Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and 
Austrobaileyales as basalmost branches, Endress and Doyle 
(2009) inferred that, in the earliest angiosperms, sporan- 
gia were originally located in a lateral or adaxial position. 
Doyle (2008, 2012) therefore hypothesized that the angio- 
sperm stamen may be “comparable with male structures in 
Glossopteridales, which had a sporangium-bearing branch 
on the adaxial side of a leaf, or with those in Bennettitales, 
which had synangia on the adaxial side of a sporophyll” 
(Doyle 2012, p. 316) (see also illustrations later in this 
chapter). 
FOSSILS: IN SEARCH OF THE SISTER 
GROUP OF ANGIOSPERMS 
We provide brief coverage of four fossil lineages that may 
be the closest relatives of angiosperms as inferred from 
cladistic analyses and/or noteworthy morphological simi- 
larities: Caytoniales, Bennettitales, Pentoxylales, and Glos- 
sopteridales. Traditionally, the search for fossil groups as 
possible angiosperm ancestors focused on features of the 
ovule and structures that may be homologous to the an- 
giosperm carpel, although many other characters, such as 
pollen morphology, stem anatomy, and leaf venation pat- 
terns, are also important in phylogenetic considerations. 
Several lines of evidence indicate that the outer integument 
of angiosperms has a different origin from the inner in- 
tegument. Developmental genetic studies indicate that the 
inner and outer integuments are under separate genetic 
control (see discussion of INO below and McAbee et al. 
2006). Other possible evidence for this distinct origin is the 
mismatch of the two integuments seen in many basal an- 
giosperms, producing a “zig-zag” micropyle (Davis 1967; 
Stebbins 1974). This feature is actually widely distributed 
in the angiosperms, occurring in diverse eudicots, including 
Bixaceae, various Brassicales, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Hama- 
melidaceae, and Dilleniaceae (Endress 2011a). Another dis- 
tinctive feature is that stomata are occasionally produced 
on the outer, but not the inner, integument (see Stebbins 
1974; Corner 1976). 
Developmental studies have shown that in many angio- 
sperms, the outer integument is hood-shaped, indicating 
an origin from a leaf (Yamada et al. 2001a,b). The gene 
INNER NO OUTER (INO) participates in the regula- 
tion of dorsoventrality of lateral organs and is expressed 
in the abaxial side of leaves, as well as in the outer epider- 
mis of the outer integument in Arabidopsis (e.g., Bowman 
2000). This same expression pattern has been observed in 
ovules of Nymphaea, supporting the hypothesis that the 
outer integument is homologous with a leaf and that ovules 
are located on the adaxial surface, away from the zone of 
expression (Yamada et al. 2003). This differential pattern 
of INO gene expression in inner and outer integuments is 
consistent with separate origins of the two integuments of 
angiosperms. 
Fossil groups such as Caytoniales, Glossopteridales, 
Pentoxylon, corystosperms, and Bennettitales have been 
proposed as possible close relatives of angiosperms be- 
cause the ovule is surrounded by a “cupule,” a structure 
that may be homologous to the outer integument of an- 
giosperms. In Caytoniales (and also corystosperms, which 
are not close angiosperm relatives in phylogenetic studies), 
the cupule plus ovule structure is curved, which has been 
considered a possible antecedent of the anatropous ovule 
of angiosperms. Corystosperms produced ovules on the 
abaxial surface of the megasporophyll and therefore prob- 
ably were not angiosperm ancestors. However, Caytonia, 
Petriellaea (a Mesozoic seed fern; Taylor et al. 1994), and 
Glossopteris (Taylor and Taylor 1992) produced ovules on 
- 
the adaxial surface of a megasporophyll and, on this ba- 
sis, could be angiosperm relatives (see Fig. 1.11). The seed- 
enclosing structures of Petriellaea and Glossopteris seem 
to have evolved via different structural modifications: in 
Petriellaea by transverse folding of the leaf and in some 
Glossopteridales by longitudinal enrolling of the leaf mar- 
gin (Taylor and Taylor 1992). The folding of the megaspo- 
rophyll in both fossils differs from the presumed origin of 
the angiosperm carpel via longitudinal folding of a mega- 
sporophyll (this assumes plicate carpel development—the 
situation may be different in ascidiate carpels; see Chap- 
ter 4). This leaves Caytonia as a possible ancestor or close 
relative of angiosperms. 
CAYTONIALES 
Before morphological cladistic analyses placed Gnetales as 
sister to the angiosperms (Crane 1985; Doyle and Dono- 
ghue 1986), Caytoniales had already received considerable 
attention as a possible angiosperm ancestor (e.g., Thomas 
1925; Gaussen 1946; Harris 1951; Stebbins 1974; Doyle 
1978, 1996). Although not initially considered an “antho- 
phyte” in early cladistic analyses (Crane 1985; Doyle and 
Donoghue 1986), Caytoniales emerged as part of a clade 

at 
(the para-angiophytes; see above and Figure 1.8) that in- 
cluded anthophytes in later analyses (Doyle and Donoghue 
1992), appearing in some analyses as sister to the angio- 
sperms (Doyle 1996). 
In Caytoniales, male and female reproductive structures 
do not appear to have been produced together; in fact, nei- 
ther has been found attached to stems (Fig. 1.12). Caytoni- 
ales were considered a possible ancestor of the angiosperms 
because of their cupules and ovules. The morphology of 
Caytoniales seemed to explain the origin of both the two in- 
teguments and the anatropous ovule characteristic of most 
angiosperms. In Caytoniales, each cupule contained several 
ovules, and the cupule enclosed these ovules, leaving only 
a small opening between the ovule and the stalk to the cu- 
pule. Within the cupule, numerous unitegmic ovules were 
present, each with a micropyle oriented toward the opening 
(or mouth) of the cupule (Fig. 1.12). It was argued that if 
the Caytonia cupule contained only a single ovule rather 
than multiple ovules, then the resultant structure would 
resemble a typical angiosperm ovule in being anatropous 
and possessing two integuments (Gaussen 1946; reviewed 
in Stebbins 1974; Doyle 1978; Frohlich and Parker 2000). 
One criticism of Caytoniales as a close angiosperm rela- 
tive or precursor is that no Caytoniales fossils have been re- 
ported that possess just one ovule per cupule. The counter 
argument is that only a simple reduction in ovule number 
(from several to one) is required. Furthermore, the origin 
of the angiosperm carpel from Caytoniales cannot easily be 
explained because the ovules of the latter were located on 
opposite sides of a narrow stalk, a structure that is difficult 
to envision as forming a carpel (Fig. 1.12B). The hypothesis 
put forward was that this Caytoniales stalk became wide 
and flat and eventually enclosed the ovules, forming the an- 
giosperm carpel (Gaussen 1946; Doyle 1978; Crane 1985). 
Another difficulty with Caytoniales as a possible angio- 
sperm ancestor is that the microsporophylls in Caytoniales 
were highly divided, differing greatly in morphology from 
angiosperm stamens, and bore bisaccate pollen, the only 
similarity being the occurrence of four microsporangia per 
structural unit (Fig. 1.12A). Leaves of Sagenopteris, the fo- 
liage of Caytonia, bore leaflets with venation resembling 
that of Glossopteris leaves, lacking the multiple orders 
of venation typical of angiosperms. Because of the large 
morphological gap between Caytoniales and angiosperms, 
the hypothesis that Caytoniales are closely related to 
angiosperms remains problematic; it is not known whether 
caytonialean plants produced vessels in their xylem, as do 
most angiosperms, or lacked them, as do Glossopteridales. 
However, presence of vessels in an angiosperm relative no 
longer seems crucial given the absence of vessels in some 
early-branching angiosperms (Chapter 4). Nevertheless,

this group consistently appears close to angiosperms in 
phylogenetic analyses. 
BENNETTITALES 
Bennettitales have long been considered close relatives of 
angiosperms. Arber and Parkin (1908) proposed a close 
relationship between angiosperms, Gnetales, and Bennet- 
titales. In Crane (1985), Bennettitales and Pentoxylon ap- 
peared as sister to Gnetales + angiosperms. The analyses 
of Doyle and Donoghue (1992) and Rothwell and Serbet 
(1994), as well as most subsequent analyses, similarly 
placed angiosperms, Pentoxylon, Bennettitales, and Gne-

tales together in one clade. Rothwell et al. (2009) reviewed 
the unusual reproductive structures of Bennettitales. 
Bennettitales possessed strobili that were unisexual in 
some representatives and bisexual in others. In bisexual 
(hermaphroditic) forms, the microsporangia and ovules 
were associated on lateral branches that arose among the 
leaf bases (Fig. 1.13). This strobiloid reproductive struc- 
ture was important in the formulation of the “anthostrobi- 
lus” theory for the origin of the angiosperm flower (Arber 
and Parkin 1907). The strobiloid reproductive structure of 
Bennettitales was considered similar to the strobiloid flow- 
ers of Magnoliaceae, and this similarity was the rationale 
for considering members of “Ranales” (Schisandraceae, 
Magnoliaceae, Ranunculaceae, and their relatives) as the 
most “primitive” extant angiosperms (e.g., Delpino 1890; 
Bessey 1915; reviewed in Endress 1993). Many Bennet- 
titales had flat microsporophylls with adaxial sporangia, 
containing monosulcate pollen; these structures could be 
considered suitable precursors to the angiosperm stamen. 
In other regards, Bennettitales are problematic as close 
relatives of the angiosperms. Ovules of Bennettitales had 
an orthotropous orientation rather than potentially anat- 
ropous as in Caytoniales, corystosperms, and most angio- 
sperms (see Crane 1985; with notable exceptions including 
Chloranthaceae, Ceratophyllum, and possibly Amborella: 
Endress and Doyle 2009). Discounting Bennettitales on 
the basis of ovule orientation assumes, however, that the 
anatropous ovule is ancestral for angiosperms (see Chap- 
ters 4 and 6). Furthermore, assessing ovule orientation is 
problematic when carpels are not present. Finally, Bennet- 
titales did not possess cupules (Rothwell and Stockey 2002; 
Rothwell et al. 2009). Rothwell et al. (2009) summarized 
features of Bennettitales—the seeds were produced termi- 
nally on sporophylls and were unique in having a nucellus 
with a solid apex, no pollen chamber, and a single integu- 
ment; the seeds were not enclosed by a cupule or any other 
specialized structures. As a result, Bennettitales differ sub- 
stantially from Gnetales, angiosperms, and Caytonia and 
have sometimes been considered part of a separate lineage, 
perhaps sharing a common glossopterid ancestor with the 
angiosperms (see “Glossopterids,” below), but not as close 
relatives of the angiosperms. However, morphological cla- 
distic analyses consistently place Bennettitales close to the 
angiosperms. 
PENTOXYLALES 
Before Crane’s (1985) phylogenetic analyses, Pentoxylon 
was considered an isolated gymnosperm of uncertain af- 
finity. As background, various detached organs have been 
inferred to be part of the “Pentoxylon” plant: Pentoxylon 
(stem), Nipaniophyllum (leaf), Sabnia (male flower), and 
Carnoconites (female cone) (Bose et al. 1985). Pentoxy- 
lon was first associated with anthophytes in Crane (1985) 
because of its flower-like arrangement of microsporo- 
phylls, aggregation of ovules into a head (as in Bennet- 
titales), and similarity of ovules to those of Bennettitales 
(Fig. 1.14). Pentoxylon was also placed in the anthophyte 
clade of Doyle and Donoghue (1992) and Rothwell and 
Serbet (1994). Bose et al. (1985) challenged some of the 
anthophyte-like anatomical features of Pentoxylon. How- 
ever, when Doyle (1996) rescored Pentoxylon with the data 
of Bose et al. (1985) and Rothwell and Serbet (1994), the 
genus continued to show a close relationship to Gnetales, 
angiosperms, Bennettitales, and Caytonia. 
In Carnoconites, the ovules were sessile and putatively 
helically arranged into compact heads. The ovulate heads 
were borne terminally on short shoots. One problem with 
Pentoxylales as a close relative of the angiosperms is that 
there is no clear carpel prototype in Pentoxylon. Further- 
more, like Bennettitales, the ovules of Carnoconites had 
an orthotropous, rather than anatropous, orientation. Re- 
searchers also debate the presence of a cupule in Carnoco- 
nites, which would ultimately form the outer (second) angio- 
sperm integument. Crane (1985) suggested that the ovules 
in Carnoconites were surrounded by a cupule, whereas oth- 
ers maintained that Carnoconites did not possess a cupule 
(Nixon et al. 1994; Rothwell and Serbet 1994). In addition, 
the megasporophylls of Carnoconites were not leaf-like in 

Figure 1.14.

appearance; rather, each ovulate head bore 10 to 20 spi- 
rally arranged (note that Crane 1985, Fig. 19, depicts these 
as whorled), stalked, unilocular megasporangia (Fig. 1.14; 
Crane 1985). As a result of these concerns, Pentoxylales, 
like Bennettitales, have been envisioned as part of a sepa- 
rate lineage, perhaps sharing a common glossopterid ances- 
tor with angiosperms (Fig. 1.14), but not as a close relative 
or direct ancestor of the angiosperms. 
GLOSSOPTERIDALES 
(GLOSSOPTERIDS) 
Plumstead (1956) and Melville (1962) suggested a close 
relationship of angiosperms and Glossopteridales partly 
on the basis of reticulate leaf venation, although the ve- 
nation of glossopterid leaves is much more like that of 
Caytonia leaflets than that of any angiosperms. Retallack 
and Dilcher (1981) revived interest in a Glossopteridales 
ancestry of angiosperms, suggesting that the ovule-bearing 
organs of Glossopteridales have structures that might 
be homologous with both the outer integument and the 
carpel of angiosperms (Fig. 1.15). They described the fos- 
sil glossopterid Denkania using terminology applied to 
angiosperms, stating that this fossil taxon had bitegmic, 
orthotropous ovules with the cupule homologous with 
the outer integument of angiosperms. These “bitegmic” 
ovules were arranged on a leaf surface but were not en- 
closed. The leaf surface was considered homologous with 
the angiosperm carpel (Fig. 1.15). This close relationship 
is questioned because the initial interpretations of glos- 
sopterid fructifications were found to be incorrect (see 
Doyle and Hickey 1976; Schopf 1976; Taylor and Tay- 
lor 1992), and the homologies inferred by Retallack and 
Figure 1.15.

20 Chapter 1 
Dilcher have been questioned (Taylor and Taylor 2009). 
Doyle (1996, 2006) also suggested a close relationship 
of glossopterids and angiosperms. He proposed not only 
that Glossopteridales might have been the ancestral group 
from which Gnetales arose via intermediate fossil forms 
such as Piroconites and Dechellyia, but also that the com- 
mon ancestor of Caytonia and the angiosperms might 
have had “glossopterid-like bract-sporophyll complexes” 
bearing several cupules per bract (leaf) that would cor- 
respond to the “anatropous cupules” of Caytonia, which 
have often been considered homologous to the bitegmic, 
anatropous ovules of angiosperms (Fig. 1.11). The under- 
lying bract would then only have to be folded lengthwise 
to produce a carpel or reduced to produce a Caytonia spo- 
rophyll. Doyle (1996) maintained that this scenario is per- 
haps more plausible than the origin of a carpel through 
the expansion and folding of the Caytonia rachis (Steb- 
bins 1974; Doyle 1978). In later analyses and reviews (see 
above and Doyle 2012), Gnetales were removed from this 
evolutionary scenario, but Glossopteridales remain close 
to angiosperms and hence the above hypothesis retains 
some credibility. The bisaccate pollen produced by Glos- 
sopteridales is comparable to that in other gymnosperm 
groups but is not found in any angiosperms. The motile 
sperm documented in well-preserved Glossopteris seeds 
(Nishida et al. 2004) is a feature shared with cycads and 
Ginkgo, distinguishing them from conifers, Gnetales, and 
angiosperms. 
Cladistic analyses have often indicated a more distant 
relationship between glossopterids and angiosperms than 
between Bennettitales, Pentoxylon, Caytoniales, and an- 
giosperms (Crane 1985; Rothwell and Serbet 1994; Doyle 
1996, 1998a,b; Soltis et al. 2005b). Glossopteridales were 
not, for example, considered part of the “anthophyte 
clade” as originally defined (Doyle and Donoghue 1992). 
However, in Doyle and Donoghue (1992), Caytoniales fol- 
lowed by glossopterids were the sister taxa to the antho- 
phyte clade as originally defined. In a later analysis, Doyle 
(1996) recovered what he termed a “glossophytes” clade in 
which glossopterids were sister to angiosperms, Gnetales, 
Bennettitales, and Caytonia. This topology is consistent 
with the hypothesis that both angiosperms (Retallack and 
Dilcher 1981) and Gnetales (Schopf 1976) were derived 
from glossopterids with a loss, in each case, of saccate pol- 
len and motile sperm. However, these hypotheses are now 
unsupported, with the molecular placement of Gnetales 
with conifers refuting the anthophyte hypothesis. Never- 
theless, it is possible that glossopterids are the immediate 
sister to a clade that includes angiosperms and their closest 
relatives and may, therefore, have played a crucial role in 
angiosperm origins. 
MOSTLY MALE 
The origin of the flower has long been problematic—as 
made famous by Darwin in his reference to the origin and 
early diversification of the angiosperms as “an abomina- 
ble mystery” (Darwin’s letter of July 22, 1879, to Joseph 
Hooker). Clearly, floral organs are derived from some or- 
gan in their gymnosperm precursors, but by what mecha- 
nism? Several hypotheses have been proposed and in some

cases bring fossil evidence from extinct gymnosperm lin- 
eages into the proposed evolutionary scenarios. We review 
leading hypotheses below. 
Frohlich and Parker’s (2000) mostly male hypothesis for 
the origin of the flower (Fig. 1.16) was based on their work 
with the homeotic gene Floricaula/LEAFY (FLO/LFY). 
Gymnosperms generally have two copies of the LFY gene 
(although Gnetum appears to have only a single copy; see 
Fig. 1.16A), referred to as the “needle” and “leaf” families. 
The function of the LFY genes of pine has been studied in 
detail. The “needle” (NEEDLY) paralogue is expressed only 
in early-developing female reproductive structures (hereaf- 
ter referred to as LFY,) (Mouradov et al. 1998). The “leaf” 
paralogue is expressed in male reproductive structures of 
gymnosperms (hereafter LFY, ). Frohlich and Meyerowitz 
(1997) speculated that these two gene families show such 
specialization because gymnosperms have had separate 
male and female reproductive structures since the Devo- 
nian. The LFY duplication in gymnosperms may have ac- 
companied or perhaps facilitated the specialization of sepa- 
rate male and female reproductive structures (Fig. 1.16B). 
Angiosperms have only one copy of LFY, which is most 
closely related to LFY,, having apparently lost the female- 
specifying “needle” paralogue (LFY,). These data prompted 
Frohlich and Parker (2000) to propose the mostly male 
hypothesis of floral origins (Fig. 1.16). Their hypothesis 
offers one developmental genetic mechanism by which a 
plant with separate male and female reproductive struc- 
tures, a feature of all extant gymnosperms, could produce 
a bisexual structure such as a flower. Frohlich and Parker 
(2000) suggested that developmental control of floral orga- 
nization derives more from systems operating in the male 
reproductive structures of the gymnosperm ancestor of an- 
giosperms than from the female reproductive structures— 
hence, “mostly male.” In the mostly male hypothesis, ovules 
Relationships of Angiosperms 
21 
are considered ectopic in origin on male reproductive struc- 
tures (i.e., stamens) in early flowers (Fig. 1.16). An ectopic 
origin of angiosperm ovule position was earlier hypoth- 
esized by Meyen (1988). 
Researchers have challenged the mostly male hypoth- 
esis on the basis of additional studies of FLO/LFY. Shindo 
et al. (2001) demonstrated that, although the FLO/LFY 
gene GpLFY from Gnetum is in the “leaf” clade (LFY,) of 
Frohlich and Parker (2000), GpLFY is expressed in female 
strobili of Gnetum. This does not agree with the Frohlich 
and Parker assumption that only gene members of the 
“needle” clade (i.e., LFY,) were expressed in gymnosperm 
female structures. These observations prompted Shindo 
et al. (2001) to conclude that the mostly male theory is not 
plausible. 
A scenario somewhat similar to the mostly male hypoth- 
esis was proposed by Theissen et al. (2002; Theissen and 
Melzer 2007), termed “out of male.” Following the “out- 
of-male” hypothesis, the bisexual flower of angiosperms 
originated from a male gymnosperm cone; reduction of the 
expression of B-class genes in the upper region of the male 
cone then resulted in the development of female, rather 
than male, reproductive units in this upper portion of the 
structure that became the flower. 
Albert et al. (2002) provided another alternative to the 
mostly male hypothesis. Their model assumes that pleio- 
tropic interactions between LFY,, and LFY, were critical 
for stabilizing the retention of these two genes in gymno- 
sperms and suggests that disruption of this delicate bal- 
ance between the two LFY genes occurred in an ancestor 
of modern angiosperms. This ancestral taxon might have 
had unisexual flowers together on the same plant, or might 
have been loosely bisexual. LFY, would then have been lost 
through selection for an integrated bisexual reproductive 
axis. 

The Age and Diversity of Early Angiosperms 
Integration of the Fossil Record and Molecular Dates 
INTRODUCTION 
Sedimentary rocks commonly contain fossil remains of 
plants and animals preserved at the time those rocks were 
deposited. These fossils provide a record of past biota that 
give insights into the morphology and anatomy of long- 
extinct organisms as well as representatives of plant and 
animal groups that are still living today. Fossil plant re- 
mains include various parts of the organism, including 
leaves, wood, flowers, fruits, seeds, and pollen. They may 
be preserved simply as imprints or molds in the sediment, 
retaining details of surface morphology and vein patterns, 
or with organic material remaining, which can provide de- 
tails of tissues and anatomy. The identification and system- 
atic placement of fossil plants rely on detailed morphologi- 
cal comparisons with other fossil and modern plants. 
Because of the tendency of plants to disaggregate, only 
rarely is a “whole plant” preserved; this limits the number 
of morphological characters available for study to those 
preserved in the organs that happen to be recovered from 
the fossil record. When rare specimens that bear both leaves 
and reproductive organs are found, the extinct plant can be 
reconstructed more completely, providing a greater number 
of characters useful in placing the fossil in relation to ex- 
tant species. In the absence of physically connected organs, 
plants may be hypothetically “reconstructed” from isolated 
fossil organs based on comparative work with extant rela- 
tives and co-occurrence data, but often the identification of 
early records of particular clades relies on isolated organs 
(Friis et al. 2011). 
Among the more commonly preserved isolated organs, 
pollen is particularly informative because it can be trans- 
ported long distances (especially those kinds adapted for 
wind rather than insect, pollination) and can record the 
presence of plants that might not be represented in the 
megafossil record. Most pollen grains have a resistant 
outer coating of sporopollenin that is highly resistant to 
decay and can therefore be preserved for millions of years. 
Palynomorphs are recovered by disaggregating and/or dis- 
solving sediments, such as siltstones, claystones, and coals, 
in acid treatments and/or by floating the organic residues 
in heavy liquids. Depending on the extent of natural oxi- 
dation during fossilization, the residues may require addi- 
tional maceration steps, comparable to those used in study- 
ing modern pollen grains (Traverse 1988). Fossil pollen 
grains can be studied and compared with modern grains by 
light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. 
Use of both light and electron microscopy provides the 
most information and is advisable for systematic investiga- 
tions (Ferguson et al. 2007), but most palynological studies 
routinely use light microscopy exclusively, as it can provide 
quicker results of economic value (e.g., recognition of po- 
tential oil-bearing strata and dating of sediments by certain 
indicator grains). 
Leaves are commonly preserved as fossils, but vary in 
the systematic resolution they can provide. Leaves of some 
families (e.g., Platanaceae and Altingiaceae) are readily rec- 
ognized and useful in tracing their fossil history, but others, 
such as those with entire margins and pinnate venation, oc- 
cur in many unrelated families and are of limited systematic 
value unless unique features of higher-order venation and/ 
or epidermal characters are preserved. Epidermal charac- 
ters, such as the arrangement of stomata, the configuration 
of cells surrounding the stomata, and trichomes, are com- 

tt 
monly retained in leaf cuticles, which are often preserved 
in leaf compression fossils (Dilcher 1974). Paleobotanists 
specializing in the investigation of extant and fossil angio- 
sperm leaves have adopted a standard terminology useful 
for the diagnosis and description of leaves and leaflets, em- 
phasizing patterns of venation and the kinds of marginal 
lobes, teeth, and glands (Ellis et al. 2009). Physiognomic 
features of the leaves in a fossil flora, such as leaf sizes, the 
proportions of serrate- vs. entire-margined leaves, and vein 
density, are useful for interpretations of paleoclimatic vari- 
ables such as mean annual temperature and precipitation. 
When permineralized (naturally infiltrated, e.g., with 
silica, calcium carbonate, or pyrite) or charcoalified, stems 
and other woody tissues can be preserved in excellent cel- 
lular detail. Stem anatomical characters (e.g., sizes and dis- 
tribution patterns of vessels, fibers, axial parenchyma and 
rays in the secondary xylem) permit confident recognition 
of some families and genera of angiosperms in the fossil 
record. As with pollen and leaves, there are many instances 
of convergent patterns of anatomy and morphology among 
angiosperms. Hence, considerable care and broad com- 
parative work must be conducted to justify assignment to 
particular clades. Fagales, Sapindales, and Malvales are 
examples of clades with distinctive wood anatomy readily 
recognized in the fossil record. Because of the commercial 
importance of wood identification in application to the

veloped for the distribution and nature of growth rings, 
vessels, fibers, and axial and ray parenchyma. These char- 
acters, typically observed in transverse, tangential, and ra- 
dial sections by transmitted light microscopy, reveal suites 
of traits often unique to particular clades. 
The age of fossils is determined by dating the rocks in 
which they are preserved (Fig. 2.1). Relative dating relies 
on the simple principle of superposition: those fossils at the 
bottom of a sequence of rock will be the oldest; those oc- 
curring higher in the sequence will have been laid down af- 
ter the lower layers. Geologists assign geologic formations 
of the Earth to particular stratigraphic stages based on cor- 
relation from one place to another. As dating methods and 
correlation techniques are refined, the consensus on numer- 
ical age assignments for the boundaries between successive 
periods has changed. Currently accepted million-year age 
boundaries (Gradstein et al. 2012) for successive geologic 
periods are indicated in Fig 2.1. 
The assignment of rocks to a particular period (e.g., Cre- 
taceous) and particular stages within the period (e.g., Maas- 
trichtian) is typically based on correlation to the type areas 
where those strata were originally recognized, often based 
on fossils (biostratigraphy). Certain marine fossils, such 
as ammonites, nannoplankton, and dinoflagellates, are 
particularly useful in these correlations because they were

widespread and evolved quickly, providing a useful “strati- 
graphic clock.” Among terrestrial fossils, mammals are use- 
ful in relative dating. Plants, particularly pollen and spores, 
have a long history of application in biostratigraphy, but 
to evaluate the evolution and timing of plant radiations, 
we should use dates obtained via independent criteria (e.g., 
animals, radiometric dating, and/or paleomagnetic dating). 
Radiometric dating is the primary basis for modern nu- 
merical age assignments. The familiar carbon-14 method 
is not useful for the study of fossil angiosperms because 
the half-life is so short that the decay products become im- 
measurably small after about 50,000 years. Other radio- 
metric methods, such as argon-argon, uranium-lead, and 
rubidium-strontium, use elements with longer half-lives 
and are suitable for dating Cretaceous and Cenozoic rocks. 
Generally, radiometric techniques apply to igneous rocks 
and can be used to infer the time that lava cooled and the 
crystals within it formed. However, the fossils themselves 
are usually limited to sedimentary rather than igneous 
rocks. Therefore, the geologic relationships of the dated ig- 
neous rocks and the fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks must 
be assessed. Ideally, the sedimentary rocks in question will 
be sandwiched between successive layers of dated volcanic 
rock, providing maximum and minimum ages. When this is 
not the case, biostratigraphic correlation is used to assess 
age based on sediments from other regions having better 
age control. 
BIOGEOGRAPHY 
The paleobotanical record contains important geographic 
information on former distribution patterns. As in the case 
of Ginkgo, now found only in central China but widely 
distributed around the world in the fossil record (Crane 
2013), there are numerous examples of angiosperms for 
which modern distributions are relictual. The hickories 
(Carya), which have no species native to Europe today, 
were diverse there 20 million years ago, with several species 
recognizable from fossil nuts in the Tertiary of Germany 
and adjacent countries (Manchester 1987). Symplocos 
(Ericales) exhibits the same pattern (Mai and Martinetto 
2006). Many angiosperm taxa are likewise now endemic 
to a particular region but were once widespread. Regional 
extirpations of formerly wide-ranging taxa have resulted 
in disjunct and endemic distributions. For example, many 
angiosperm genera now endemic to eastern Asia (e.g., Cer- 
cidiphyllum, Cyclocarya, Platycarya, Rehderodendron, and 
Tetracenton) have well-documented fossil records in North 
America and/or Europe (Manchester et al. 2009). The 
broader geographic ranges documented for many woody 
taxa in the Northern Hemisphere reflect the presence of 
former connections between northern continents during the 
late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic, particularly the North 
Atlantic Land Bridge linking North America and Europe 
via Greenland and the Bering Land Bridge linking North 
America and Asia during the late Cretaceous and early Ter- 
tiary (Tiffney 1985; Tiffney and Manchester 2001). 
Former land connections in the Southern Hemisphere 
also facilitated angiosperm dispersal. The tectonic separa- 
tion of Africa and South America occurred early in angio- 
sperm history, apparently predating most modern families. 
However, the spread of angiosperms between Australia and 
South America via Antarctica was apparently possible until 
the early Oligocene; when Antarctica and South America 
separated. Thus, Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) and Gymnos- 
toma (Casuarinaceae), now native to Australasia, have 
well-documented fossils in the Eocene of South America 
(Gandolfo et al. 2011; Zamaloa et al. 2006). Modern pat- 
terns of disjunction and endemism of particular clades pro- 
vide a single window (that of the present day) on plant 
distributions. In many cases, we can detect earlier patterns 
through observations of the fossil record. 
In some instances fossils help document morphological 
and biogeographic diversity within extant clades. Mod- 
ern Platanaceae contain the single living genus Platanus 
with simple unlobed (subg. Castaneophyllum Leroy) and 
palmately lobed (subg. Platanus) leaves (Nixon and Poole 
. 
2003; Feng et al. 2005). Although simple-leaved Platana- 
ceae have an excellent fossil record extending back to 
the early Cretaceous with a diversity of palmately lobed 
forms (see Fig. 8.4), several species with the extinct trait 
of compound leaves were present in the family during the 
late Cretaceous and early Tertiary—for example, Platanites 
(Fig. 8.4) and Dewalquea.

THE AGE OF THE ANGIOSPERMS: 
FOSSIL EVIDENCE 
Darwin referred to “the origin and early diversification of 
angiosperms” as “an abominable mystery” in a well-known 
quotation from a letter to the botanist J. D. Hooker (July 22, 
1879). This statement reflects Darwin’s frustration with the 
fossil record of flowering plants as a key to their origin; 
based on the record at that time, angiosperms appeared to 
have originated suddenly and then radiated rapidly dur- 
ing the mid-Cretaceous (for a review, see Friedman 2009). 
This view was due partly to the mis-assignment of many 
Cretaceous angiosperm leaves to modern genera without 
critical comparative work and to the lack of reproductive 
structures for more secure systematic assessment. Although 
the origin of the angiosperms remains a mystery, consider- 

able progress in understanding this longstanding problem 
has been made in the past 15-20 years due to combined 
contributions from paleobotany, molecular systematics, 
genomics, and developmental genetics (see Frohlich and 
Chase 2007; Soltis et al. 2008a,b; Chapters 1, 3, 14). Here 
we review the age of the angiosperms based on both fossil 
evidence and molecular clock estimates. 
In discussing the age of the angiosperms, it is important 
to review basic terms and concepts. As has been well re- 
viewed (e.g., Doyle and Donoghue 1993, 2012), the crown 
group is defined as the most recent common ancestor of a 
clade of living taxa (Fig. 2.2). Extinct taxa descended from 
the most recent common ancestor of living species are still 
considered part of a crown group. Molecular and morpho- 
logical phylogenetic analyses of extant taxa are therefore 
focused on the angiosperm crown group. The earliest di- 
verging angiosperms (e.g., Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales) 
are covered in Chapters 3 and 4. In this chapter, however, 
we are interested in pivotal now-extinct stem and crown 
group angiosperms (Fig. 2.2). Molecular and morphologi- 
cal phylogenetic analyses of extant taxa are therefore fo- 
cused on the angiosperm crown group, and the placement 
of some fossils, whether best placed as stem relative or as 
a member of the crown group, can be controversial due to 
missing characters that might be required to confirm the 
position. However, these interpretations are fundamental 
to the age-calibration of particular nodes in the phylogeny. 
In Chapter 1, we considered the closest living and extinct 
relatives of the angiosperms. 
The earliest evidence of angiosperms comes from the 
pollen fossil record (see Friis et al. 2011). The oldest unam- 
biguous angiosperm fossils are pollen grains (~131.8 mya) 
from the Hauterivian stage of the Early Cretaceous (Hughes 
1994) (Fig. 2.1). These fossil pollen grains have a reticulate- 
columellate wall structure also found in extant angio- 
sperms. Older pollen grains from the Valanginian are less 
secure in being of angiosperm origin (Brenner 1996). From

the Late Barremian and into the Albian, angiosperm pollen 
diversity increases extensively. The oldest flowers, fruits, 
and seeds of angiosperms are from the Barremian or Ap- 
tian (130-115 mya) (Doyle 1992; Hughes 1994; Brenner 
1996; Friis et al. 1999, 2011). Many molecular clock es- 
timates (see below) suggest that angiosperms arose before 
the Cretaceous, with many dates inferring a late Jurassic, 
or even Triassic (S. A. Smith et al. 2010), origin. However, 
no unambiguous fossil evidence supports a pre-Cretaceous 
origin of flowering plants. Reports of older angiosperm 
fossils (Sun et al. 1998; Wang 2010) have been considered 
problematic, due to problems with the age assessment of 
the strata bearing the fossils or with the interpretation that 
the fossils represent angiosperms. 
Sun et al. (1998) proposed that angiosperms originated 
in the late Jurassic based on the discovery of Archaefruc- 
tus liaoningensis (Fig. 2.3) (first estimated to be 144 mya). 
However, the age of Archaefructus was revised and given 
a younger estimate of 125 mya, indicating a Barremian— 
Aptian age and placing it in the Early Cretaceous (Swisher 
et al. 1999; Sun et al. 2002). Archaefructus is an herbaceous 
plant, and its phylogenetic placement has been contentious. 
Plants may have been aquatic as suggested by highly dis- 
sected leaves, flowers appear to lack a perianth, and the ar- 
rangement of the carpels is uncertain. Because the phyloge- 
netic placement of Archaefructus is uncertain, it is unclear 
whether flowers of Archaefructus represent an ancestral 
state for angiosperms or are modifications associated with 
a submerged aquatic habitat. The latter possibility must 
be strongly considered, given the major modifications ex- 
hibited by extant submerged aquatics (e.g., Hydrostachy- 
aceae); the relationships of these families could be ascer- 
tained only with DNA, and even then with some difficulty 
(D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; Burleigh et al. 2009). 
In a phylogenetic analysis involving extant angiosperms, 
using DNA data plus a small number of morphological 
characters, Sun et al. (2002) placed Archaefructus as sister

to extant flowering plants, raising the possibility that the 
first angiosperms were aquatic. However, the original inter- 
pretation of the reproductive axes of these fossils has been 
challenged, and the placement of Archaefructus as sister to 
all living angiosperms hotly debated. The reproductive axis 
of this plant was originally interpreted as an elongate floral 
axis. However, it has been reinterpreted to represent an in- 
florescence axis with simple, unisexual flowers (Friis et al. 
2003a). The absence of subtending bracts makes it difficult 
to confirm this, but features such as paired stamens makes 
this interpretation very likely. Friis et al. (2003a) concluded 
that Archaefructus was possibly related to Nymphaeales 
(water lilies), with its unusual floral features reflecting 
its aquatic habit. More recent analyses using DNA and 
morphological characters also place Archaefructus within 
Nymphaeales (Endress and Doyle 2009; Doyle 2012). 
Nonetheless, despite the problematic placement of Ar- 
chaefructus (Fig. 2.3), it represents one the most complete 
early angiosperm fossils (Sun et al. 2002). Two other spe- 
cies of Archaefructus have now been discovered. In addi- 
tion to A. liaoningensis (Sun et al. 1998), A. sinsenis (Sun 
et al. 2002) and A. eoflora (Ji et al. 2004) have also been 
described from the early Cretaceous (Early Aptian to early 
Late Aptian). 
Importantly, extinct members of several extant basal 
angiosperm clades (see Chapters 3 and Chapter 4), includ- 
ing Amborellaceae, 
Nymphaeaceae, 
Austrobaileyaceae, 
and Schisandraceae, were present in the Early Cretaceous. 
Hence, there is congruence between the general framework 
of angiosperm phylogeny based on analysis of extant spe- 
cies and the early fossil record. There is, in fact, some evi- 
dence for more diversity in some of these basal angiosperm 
groups (e.g., Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Austro- 
baileyales) in the fossil record than is exhibited by these 
same lineages today (Friis et al. 2000, 2001, 2011). Fos- 
sil leaves identified as Illiciaceae (now in Schisandraceae) 
and Austrobaileyaceae have been reported from the Early 
Cretaceous (latest Barremian or earliest Aptian; Upchurch 
1984; Friis et al. 2011). Stamens similar to those of Ambo- 
rella and Illicium have also been recovered from the Early 
Cretaceous (Friis et al. 2000, 2011). Pollen of Hauterivian 
age similar to that of Amborella has been identified (Doyle 
2001). Still another fossil consisting of densely aggregated, 
spirally arranged carpels shows similarity to Schisandra- 
ceae (Friis et al. 2000, 2011). 
; 
The discovery of a fossil flower of Nymphaeaceae 
(Fig. 2.3) from the Early Cretaceous (125-115 mya; Friis 
et al. 2001) adds to the overall correspondence between re- 
cent molecular phylogenetic results (see Chapters 3 and 4) 
and the paleobotanical record. Early Cretaceous floras also 
included fossils that are attributable to Chloranthaceae, in- 
cluding flowers that are similar to Hedyosmum and stamens 
similar to those of Ascarina (Friis et al. 1986, 1997, 1999; 
Eklund 1999). The early appearance of Chloranthaceae in 
the fossil record also agrees with molecular phylogenetic 
results in that Chloranthaceae diverge just a few nodes af- 
ter Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Austrobaileyales in 
DNA-based topologies (e.g., Soltis et al. 2008b, 2011). 
The monocots have been considered a possible excep- 
tion to the rough correspondence between early fossils and 
DNA-based topologies for extant taxa. That is, until re- 
cently, the Cretaceous fossil record of monocots had been 
considered poor, with some of the earliest monocot fossils 
not appearing until the Late Cretaceous (Gandolfo et al. 
1998c, 2000, 2004; Stockey 2006; Friis et al. 2011). How- 
ever, recent fossil discoveries of monocots from the Early 
Cretaceous now suggest that monocots are older and were 
more diverse than earlier appreciated (Friis et al. 2011; 
Chapter 7). For example, fossils of Araceae (a basal mono- 
cot lineage) date to the Early Cretaceous (Hesse and Zetter 
2007). Hence, the rough correspondence between fossils 

ae 
and DNA-based topologies for extant. taxa extends to 
the monocots as well. In addition, these Early Cretaceous 
monocot fossils agree with estimated ages of monocots, 
including an Early Cretaceous origin, based on molecular 
dating (K. Bremer 2000; Bell et al. 2010; see Chapter 7). 
We stress that although some fossils show similarities 
to extant basal lineages such as Amborellaceae, Nympha- 
eaceae, and Schisandraceae, few of these early fossils can 
be unambiguously assigned to any extant group. Significant 
extinction also characterizes early angiosperm lineages 
(Friis et al. 2011). These observations point to the diffi- 
culty of using extant basal lineages to infer characteristics 
of the earliest angiosperms. Although it is tempting to con- 
clude from these fossil data that the earliest angiosperms 
were morphologically similar to extant Amborellaceae, 
Nymphaeaceae, and Austrobaileyales, caution must be ex- 
ercised because many early angiosperm fossils cannot be 
unambiguously associated closely with any extant taxa. 
These difficulties are sometimes the result of a poor under- 
standing of the fossil but in many cases arise because the 
character combinations observed in the fossils differ from 
those of extant angiosperms. Thus, some early angiosperm 
fossils exhibit a mosaic of features associated with mul- 
tiple modern groups. Furthermore, very few fossils have 
actually been included in phylogenetic analyses with living 
taxa; hence, the placements of few fossils have been tested 
rigorously. 
Examination of fossil flowers has provided important 
generalizations about the structural organization and di- 
versity of early flowers (Friis et al. 2000, 2011). Many 
early fossil flowers and fruits are preserved as charcoal- 
ified materials (Friis et al. 2010, 2011). Flowers may be 
exceptionally well preserved by this mechanism; they are 
three-dimensional and may still retain all floral organs. 
Numerous charcoalified flowers have been reported from 
the Early Cretaceous, and these flowers are small (Fig. 2.4). 
Even allowing for some shrinkage during fossilization, 
these early fossil flowers are still small. Larger flowers, 
such as the Late Aptian Archaeanthus (Magnoliaceae) and 
“Rose Creek flower” (Chapter 10), were preserved in a 
different mode, as impression specimens rather than char- 
coalified. The methods for recovery of charcoalified flowers 
favor small flowers, whereas larger flowers would become 
fragmentary and difficult to recover by sieving. Thus, di- 
vergent perspectives on the size of early angiosperm fos- 
sils may result from variation in preservation and recovery 
of large versus small flowers. Regardless, complete recon- 
structions of floral organization are possible for fewer than 
10% of the angiosperm taxa present in Early Cretaceous 
floras, which suggests caution is needed and indicates that, 
for some characters, it is premature to offer many gener- 
alizations. Nonetheless, it is clear that many angiosperm

reproductive structures from the Early Cretaceous were 
small. For example, none of the fossil seeds or fruits in the 
famous Famalicao, Portugal, assemblage exceeds 3.9 mm 
in length (Eriksson et al. 2000; Friis et al. 2011). 
The small size of many Early Cretaceous flowers, and 
indeed some whole plants (Jud and Hickey 2013), generally 
agrees with the floral characteristics of the basalmost ex- 
tant angiosperm lineages, Amborellaceae, Austrobaileyales, 
and some Nymphaeales (Cabombaceae) in having small or 
moderate-sized flowers. Furthermore, if larger flowers were 
present in the Early Cretaceous, pieces would be expected, 
but these have not been detected. The fossil record there- 
fore argues against the older view that large, magnolia-like 
flowers represent the ancestral flower (Cronquist 1968; 
Takhtajan 1969). 
The fossil record is more ambiguous on the organization 
(spiral vs. whorled) of floral parts in Early Cretaceous flow- 
ers because this feature can be difficult to reconstruct even 
in well-preserved fossils (Friis et al. 2000). However, several 
other characteristics of Early Cretaceous flowers are clear. 
Both unisexual and bisexual flowers are present in Early 
Cretaceous floras (Friis et al. 2011). In addition, flowers 
with few floral parts predominate; flowers with many parts 
are uncommon. Differentiation into sepals and petals has 
not been observed in Early Cretaceous flowers. Stamens in 
Early Cretaceous fossils typically exhibit poor differentia- 
tion between filament and anther, and early fossils also ap- 
pear to lack a well-differentiated style. Both morphologi- 
cal features agree with characteristics seen in the flowers 
of living basalmost angiosperms (ANA grade: Amborella, 
Nymphaeales, Austrobaileyales) and magnoliids (see Chap- 
ter 4). It is often not possible to determine whether fossil 
carpels were ascidiate or plicate because ontogenetic data 
are usually needed to make this determination. However, it 
appears that both types were present in Early Cretaceous 
floras. 
Most early fossil fruits have a single seed, but a few 
have two to as many as eight seeds. These data suggest that 
the early carpel possessed a small number of ovules, again 
in agreement with the general framework of angiosperm 
phylogeny in that living basal lineages generally have few 
ovules per carpel (Chapter 4). Friis et al. (2000) inferred 
that both insect-pollinated and wind-pollinated taxa were 
present in Early Cretaceous floras and that pollen was 
probably the major reward for visiting insects. Ethereal oil 
cells, typical of some extant basal lineages and magnoli- 
ids (Chapter 4), have also been documented in early fossil 
flowers (e.g., Archaeanthus). 
Crepet (1996) concluded that there was a “dramatic mod- 
ernization” of the angiosperms by the Turonian (~90 mya), 
which appears to coincide with a much-improved fossil 
record of insects (Grimaldi 1999). Our understanding of

the timing of angiosperm diversification versus insect di- 
versification (and the timing of angiosperm-pollinator rela- 
tionships) has improved (see Misof et al. 2014); the pattern 
and timing of early angiosperm diversification is consistent 
with a similar pattern of radiation in anthophilous in- 
sects (Crepet 2000). Furthermore, there is “a compelling 
similarity between the rate of floral innovation per million 
years and the rate of angiosperm diversification during 
the Cenomanian-Turonian interval, which coincided with 
the first occurrences of many derived insect pollinators” 

(Crepet 2000). Significantly, a recent phylogenomic study 
of insects indicates that the major diversification of holo- 
metabolous insects, those insects characterized by complete 
metamorphosis [e.g., Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), 
Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees), 
Diptera (true flies)], occurred in the Early Cretaceous 
(Misof et al. 2014), a timeframe that corresponds to the 
rise and early diversification of the angiosperms. 
DIVERGENCE TIMES AND THE AGE 
OF THE ANGIOSPERMS 
Molecular estimates of the divergence time between an- 
giosperms and gymnosperms have varied dramatically, 
from 346 to more than 900 mya (see P. Soltis et al. 2002; 
D. Soltis 2005b; S. A. Smith et al. 2010). Clearly, the latter 
age estimates, which are much older than the oldest fossils 
of land plants, are too old. Most estimates for the age of 
seed plants range from 340 to 400 mya, a period that cor- 
responds to the Devonian and Early Carboniferous. These 
estimates also agree with the fossil record and the earliest 
records of gymnosperm seeds. However, the seeds and pol- 
len of these earliest gymnosperms (now extinct) do not cor- 
respond to those of crown group seed plants, strengthening 
the view that the extant seed plant clade is not as old as the 
oldest seed plants. 
Molecular results provide strong evidence for the mono- 
phyly of extant gymnosperms and for a sister-group re- 
lationship of angiosperms and extant gymnosperms (see 
Chapter 1). By the Late Carboniferous (~290-320 mya) 
or Permian, cycads, conifers, and Ginkgoales were repre- 
sented in the fossil record. The age of some of these older 
fossils representing extant gymnosperm lineages suggested 
to some that the angiosperms may be much older than the 
fossil record now indicates. Some researchers proposed, in 
fact, that angiosperms must be as old as their gymnosperm 
sister group (see Axsmith et al. 1998; Doyle 1998b). 
However, the fact that extant gymnosperms are mono- 
phyletic and may extend to the Carboniferous or Permian 
does not imply that the angiosperm clade similarly dates 
to the same time. Several now-extinct lineages of seed 
plants occur along the branch to the angiosperms, with 
Caytoniales, Bennettitales, glossopterids, and Pentoxylon 
consistently appearing on the branch to the angiosperms 
(Chapter 1). Therefore, the argument for a Carboniferous 
origin of the angiosperm stem lineage is unrealistic. This 
represents a misinterpretation of DNA-based support for 
the monophyly of extant gymnosperms as concomitantly 
providing support for the monophyly of all gymnosperms. 
Clearly, all gymnosperms (living and extinct) do not con-

29 
stitute a monophyletic group, but living gymnosperms (ac- 
rogymnosperms or Acrogymnospermae of Cantino et al. 
2007) are monophyletic in most analyses (Chapter 1). 
Given the numerous diverse angiosperm fossils reported 
from as early as 115-125 mya, the earliest angiosperms 
were almost certainly somewhat older than the oldest esti- 
mate based on the fossil record of approximately 132 mya. 
We review below attempts to estimate the age of the angio- 
sperms using molecular data and provide a useful compen- 
dium of estimates of ages for angiosperm subclades (orders 
and families) taken from Bell et al. (2010) and Magallon 
et al. (2015). 
Molecular dating approaches have seen much progress 
over the past 15 years and also have garnered controversy. 
Whereas the fossil record may provide underestimates of 
clade ages, molecular methods tend to overestimate ages 
(e.g., Rodriguez-Trelles et al. 2002; Bell et al. 2010). As a 
result, refinements of dating approaches have been devel- 
oped in an effort to compensate for this bias. As reviewed 
below, attempts to estimate the timing of angiosperm ori- 
gins have employed a variety of molecular datasets and es- 
timation procedures. 
We also review the many caveats and sources of error 
and bias that can affect both fossil-based and molecular 
estimates of divergence times (Sanderson and Doyle 2001; 
P. Soltis et al. 2002; Sanderson et al. 2004; Bell and Dono- 
ghue 2005a; Bell et al. 2005). The fossil record and the in- 
terpretation of that record are possible sources of error. In 
molecular dating studies, fossil dates should represent only 
minimum age calibrations for a clade because the possibil- 
ity of the very first member of a lineage to have been fossil- 
ized is very slim. Similarly, molecular clock estimates may 
be affected by several factors that also merit consideration. 
An incorrect topology will yield erroneous age estimates, 
and the magnitude of the error in those estimates will of 
course depend on the extent of the error in the underly- 
ing topology (Sanderson and Doyle 2001). Inaccurate fos- 
sil calibrations represent another source of error and may 
also introduce bias in the resulting age estimates. The fossil 
calibration age itself may be erroneous, or the fossil age 
may be affixed to the wrong part of the tree. As shown in 
Figure 2.2, does a fossil calibration represent a minimum 
age of the crown group or the stem group? Heterogeneous 
rates of evolution are well known among lineages (e.g., 
Clegg et al. 1994; Gaut et al. 1996; Li 1997; P. Soltis et al. 
2002) and are a major problem in age estimation. Incorrect 
assessment of gene orthology can also introduce error into 
inferences of both topology and age (e.g., Sanderson and 
Doyle 2001; Gaut et al. 1996). Inadequate taxon sampling 
not only is a problem in phylogeny reconstruction, but also 
can compound problems of age estimation. Finally, mo- 
lecular data are often extremely complex (Chapter 1); esti- 

30 Chapter 2 
mates of divergence times may vary among genes or other 
data partitions (e.g., among codon positions; Sanderson 
and Doyle 2001; Bell and Donoghue 2005a,b). 
Initial efforts to date the origin of angiosperms as well as 
divergences within angiosperms relied on a strict molecular 
clock (i.e., assuming rate constancy among nucleotide sites 
and among lineages). Those efforts yielded age estimates 
that not only vary dramatically, but also in some cases are 
highly inconsistent with the fossil record (see Magalléon 
2004; Bell et al. 2005; D. Soltis et al. 2008b; Doyle 2012). 
With a strict molecular clock, the age of the angiosperms 
has been estimated as 420-350 mya (Ramshaw et al. 
1972), 354-300 mya (Martin et al. 1989, 1993; Brandl 
et al. 1992), and 200 mya (Wolfe et al. 1989; Laroche et al. 
1995). All these dates suggest an origin of the angiosperms 
that predates the angiosperm fossil record (135-125 mya). 
In some cases the molecular clock estimates are older than 
the estimated ages of all seed plants (~390-350 mya), all 
extant seed plants (about 309 mya), and even all vascular 
plants (~415 mya), based on the fossil record. 
Because of the problems with strict molecular clock 
methods, most recent efforts to date the origin of the an- 
giosperms used improved dating methods that accommo- 
date rate heterogeneity. These approaches have converged 
on more reasonable estimates between 180—140 mya, 
predating the dates inferred from the fossil record by only 
48 to 8 myr (Sanderson and Doyle 2001; Wikstrom et al. 
2001; P. Soltis et al. 2002; Chaw et al. 2004; Schneider 
et al. 2004; Sanderson et al. 2004; Bell et al. 2005, 2010; 
Magallon et al. 2015; but see S. A. Smith et al. 2010; for 
reviews see Bell et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2005b, 2008; Ma- 
gallén 2010; S. A. Smith et al. 2010; Doyle 2012). 
Methods that relax.the assumption of a strict molecu- 
lar clock (Table 2.1) include nonparametric rate smooth- 
ing (NPRS; Sanderson 
1997), local clocks (Yoder and 
Yang 2000; Yang and Yoder 2003), penalized likelihood 
(PL; Sanderson 2002), Bayesian “relaxed clock” (BRC) ap- 
proaches (e.g., Thorne et al. 1998; Huelsenbeck et al. 2000; 
Aris-Brosou and Yang 2002; Thorne and Kishino 2002), 
which include the very popular program BEAST (Drum- 
mond and Rambaut 2007; Drummond et al. 2012; Ram- 
baut and Drummond 2007; see below and Table 2.1), the 
Li-Tanimura method (Li and Tanimura 1987), and “PATH,” 
a phylogenetic dating method with confidence intervals that 
employs mean path lengths (Britton et al. 2002). Smith and 
O’Meara (2012) have developed treePL, a method for es- 
timating divergence times using PL for large phylogenetic 
trees—it compares well to other methods, and the approach 
works well with over 10,000 taxa. Investigators who em- 
ployed alternatives to a strict molecular clock have gener- 
ally obtained more reasonable estimates of the age of the 
angiosperms that are closer to the age of the oldest fossils;

Uses a least squares smoothing approach that penalizes rates that change too quickly from one 
branch to neighboring branch. Implemented in r8s (loco.biosci.arizona.edu/r8s/). 
Employs maximum likelihood models of local molecular clocks within the overall phylogeny. 
A “semi-parametric” approach that combines maximurn likelihood approach with the penalty 
function noted above with NPRS. One can specify the relative weight of the penalty function 
and the ML component in which parameters are being fitted. The parametric model has a differ- 
ent substitution rate for each branch. Implemented in r8s (loco.biosci.arizona.edu/r8s/). 
Accurate placement of fossil calibrations is a crucial part of dating, but entails uncertainty. 
Bayesian methods provide a mechanism of accommodating the degree to which fossil evidence 
approximates the date or time of divergence that they constrain. Commonly used programs 
include the Bayesian dating method implemented in Multidivtime (Thorne et al. 1998) and the 
very popular program BEAST (beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page; Drummond and Rambaut 2007). 
The branch lengths of the input tree are interpreted as (mean) numbers of substitutions. The 
mean path lengths (MPL) method estimates the age of a node with the mean of the distances 
from this node to all tips descending from it. Under the assumption of a molecular clock, 
standard-errors of the estimates node ages can be computed (Britton et al. 2002). 

the estimates generally range from 250-125 mya (Sander- 
son and Doyle 2001; Wikstrom et al. 2001; P. Soltis et al. 
2002; Chaw et al. 2004; Schneider et al. 2004; Bell et al. 
2005, 2010; but see S. A. Smith et al. 2010, Magallon 2010). 
In one of the first rigorous studies to estimate the age of 
the angiosperms, Sanderson and Doyle (2001) used rbcL 
and 18S rDNA sequences and employed an ML approach; 
rather than assuming equal rates across sites, they used a 
gamma distribution of rates to correct for site-to-site varia- 
tion. They found younger estimates than strict molecular 
clock approaches; their estimates of the age of crown group 
angiosperms ranged from 68 to 281 mya, depending on 
data, tree, and assumptions, with most estimates ranging 
from 190-140 mya. 
Wikstrom et al. (2001) used NPRS to estimate the age 
of the angiosperms and divergence times for major angio- 
sperm clades. They used rbcL, atpB, and 18S rDNA se- 
quences from 560 angiosperms—the dataset and shortest 
tree from D. Soltis et al. (2000). Wikstrém et al. (2001), us- 
ing a single calibration point, fixed the split between Faga- 
les and Cucurbitales at 84 mya based on two fossils, Proto- 
fagacea (Herendeen et al. 1994) and Antiquacupula (Sims 
et al. 1998) and estimated an age for the angiosperms of 
179-158 mya. The estimates provided by Wikstrém et al. 
(2001) across angiosperms were of great utility to diverse 
investigators (e.g., molecular biologists and ecologists) and 
were widely used for nearly a decade. A comparable com- 
prehensive analysis that employed newer approaches was 
later provided by Bell et al. (2010; below). 
Sanderson (2003) used 27 proteins and PL, as noted 
above, another method that relaxes the assumption of a 
strict molecular clock. The major focus was to estimate 
the origin of land plants (embryophytes); however, the 
study also estimated the age of crown group angiosperms 
to be ~200 mya. Aoki et al. (2004), using sequences from 
MADS-box genes and two other methods, a linearized 
trees (Takezaki et al. 1995) estimation procedure and lo- 
cal clocks (Yoder and Yang 2000), estimated the age of the 
most recent common ancestor of all extant angiosperms as 
210-140 mya, depending on the tree used and assumptions 
regarding rates of molecular evolution. 
Chaw et al. (2004) used the Li-Tanimura unequal rate 
method to date the divergence of monocots from other an- 
giosperms, such as core eudicots (see Chapter 3 for over- 
view of angiosperm phylogeny), 61 plastid genes from 
12 completely sequenced plastid genomes of land plants, 
and three calibration points and concluded that monocots 
diverged from other angiosperms 150-140 mya. Their es- 
timate for this early split among major lineages within an- 
giosperms is in agreement with slightly older estimates for 
the origin of angiosperms. 
Bell et al. (2005) used a BRC method to date the ori- 
The Age and Diversity of Early Angiosperms 
31 
gin of the angiosperms. The BRC approach allows rates 
to evolve among lineages along the tree and has the ad- 
vantages of taking into consideration the variation in mo- 
lecular evolution among genes and allowing the researcher 
to incorporate fossil evidence as either maximum or mini- 
mum age constraints at several nodes on the topology. Bell 
et al. (2005) tested for the effects of different genes, differ- 
ent methods, different calibrations/constraints, and differ- 
ent prior distributions of parameters on the resulting age 
estimates. A topology based on analysis of genes from all 
three plant genomes for 71 taxa was used as a backbone. 
With BRC, dates for the age of the angiosperms varied 
across datasets, from 144.5 to 202.6 mya depending on 
the dataset and the fossil constraint. Bell et al. (2005) com- 
pared these results with those obtained from PL using the 
same dataset and multiple fossil constraints. Estimates of 
the age of the angiosperms varied among genes and con- 
straint treatments (150.20-275.71 mya) and were gener- 
ally older than ages inferred using the BRC method. The 
results of Bell et al. (2005) indicate that very different age 
estimates can be obtained when different methods (198- 
139 mya) and different sources of data (275-122 mya) 
are employed; results also varied with the use of temporal 
constraints on the trees. Most estimates from this study, 
however, are between 180-140 mya, suggesting a Middle 
Jurassic-Early Cretaceous origin of flowering plants. These 
estimates predate the oldest unequivocal fossil angiosperms 
by about 48-8 million years. 
More recent Bayesian analyses also provide a wide range 
of dates for the angiosperm crown group. Bell et al. (2010) 
used BEAST (Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Drummond 
et al. 2012) to estimate the phylogeny and divergence times 
of angiosperms simultaneously using 36 calibration points 
for 567 taxa. They performed two analyses: in one, they 
estimated rates and ages from the DNA sequences, model- 
ing fossils as exponential priors, and in a second analysis, 
they set fossil priors to fit a lognormal distribution. Based 
on the analysis with lognormal priors, the estimated age of 
the angiosperms was 199-167 mya (Early to Late Juras- 
sic), and the following age estimates for major angiosperm 
clades were Mesangiospermae (140-128 mya), Eudicoty- 
ledoneae (143-116), Gunneridae (124-111 mya), Rosidae 
(117-107 mya), and Asteridae (119-101 mya). With the 
exception of the age of the angiosperms themselves (which 
is older than the oldest fossils), these age estimates are 
generally younger than other recent molecular estimates 
and very close to dates inferred from the fossil record. The 
chronogram from Bell et al. (2010) and its accompanying 
table of age estimates have been useful references for re- 
searchers (Fig. 2.5). 
As a resource, we provide a list of ages for clades rec- 
ognized as families and orders as well as comparison with

recent estimates from Magallon et al. (2015) (Supplemen- 
tary Table 2.1; we also provide accompanying tree figures 
from Bell et al. 2010: Appendices. 2.$.1-2.$.12; available 
on book website at press.uchicago.edu/sites/soltis/). 
S. A. Smith et al. (2010) and Magall6on (2010) provided 
much older estimates for the age of the angiosperm crown 
group than do the above-mentioned studies. Estimates of 
S. A. Smith et al. (2010) ranged from 228-217 mya (Late 
Triassic), and those of Magallon (2010) ranged from 
275 mya (Early Permian) to 221.5 mya (Late Triassic). Both 
studies used interesting approaches. Magallén (2010) used 
fossils to break the angiosperm stem branch (see Fig. 2.2). 
In phylogenetic trees, the branch to the angiosperms in 
phylogenetic trees is very long and consequently may ham- 
per divergence time estimation. As reviewed in Magallon 
(2010), the typical approach to break a long branch is to 
increase taxonomic sampling, so that the added taxa may 
break up the long branch into a series of shorter branches. 
However, the species that can break the long stem branch 
to angiosperms are now extinct. Therefore, to break the 
long branch to angiosperms, Magallon (2010) simulated 
sequences for angiosperm stem relatives. S. A. Smith et al. 
(2010) did not follow the widely used approach of accept- 
ing the age of the oldest known tricolpate pollen (125 mya) 
as a maximum age for the eudicots; instead they dated 
crown eudicots as 153 mya (Late Jurassic) using molecular 
estimates, which may be problematic (see below). 
Doyle (2012) reviewed how the estimates of S. A. Smith 
et al. (2010) and Magallon (2010) compare to the fossil 
record; we revisit that comparison. S. A. Smith et al. (2010) 
indicated that angiosperms arose in the Triassic and called 
into question the longstanding use of the age of the oldest 
known tricolpate pollen (125 mya) as a maximum age for 
the eudicot crown clade. S. A. Smith et al. (2010) dated that 
node as 153 mya (Late Jurassic) and also indicated that 
the eudicots (Eudicotyledoneae) began to diversify in the 
earliest part of the Cretaceous (the Barremian). In Magal- 
l6n (2010), the eudicot crown node was given a uniform 
distribution bounded between 122 and 128 Ma, so the ap- 
proach of breaking up the angiosperm stem considerably 
pushed back the estimated age of origin of the angiosperms 
to the Triassic or even Permian. Doyle (2012) noted that 
tricolpate pollen, which characterizes the eudicots, is per- 
haps the best fossil synapomorphy for any angiosperm 
subclade, as it is conspicuous and has a dense fossil his- 
tory. If there were already basal eudicots in the Late Juras- 
sic and eudicots in the Barremian, as the molecular dating 
estimates of S. A. Smith et al. (2010) indicate, “the tem- 
poral sequence of monosulcate, tricolpate, and tricolpor- 
ate pollen and its congruence with the evolutionary series 
inferred from molecular phylogenies would be a mystery” 
(Doyle 2012, p. 314). “It is also difficult to imagine why 
The Age and Diversity of Early Angiosperms 
33 
angiosperms would remain hidden for so long if they had 
already diversified into clades that rose so rapidly in the 
mid-Cretaceous” (Doyle 2012, p. 314). 
THE EARLIEST ANGIOSPERMS: 
HABIT AND HABITAT 
Two different views have been expressed on the general 
habit and habitat of the earliest angiosperms: woody and 
terrestrial or herbaceous and aquatic (reviewed in Soltis 
et al. 2005b, 2008; see Chapter 6). The longstanding hy- 
pothesis that the earliest angiosperms were woody is sup- 
ported by the fact that most extant basal angiosperms are 
woody (although the second-branching clade, Nympha- 
eales, are herbaceous), and all gymnosperms are woody, as 
are the fossil lineages that are considered most closely re- 
lated to angiosperms (see Chapter 1). Amborella, the sister 
to all other living angiosperms (see Chapter 3), is woody, 
as are Austrobaileyales, another early-branching extant 
lineage. However, the strictly aquatic water lily lineage 
(Nymphaeales) follows Amborella as the subsequent sister 
to all other flowering plants (see Chapter 3). As a result of 
the placement of Nymphaeales, the habit of the first angio- 
sperms is reconstructed as equivocal (see Chapter 3). 
A recent variant on the hypothesis that the first angio- 
sperms were woody/terrestrial employs physiological fea- 
tures. Anatomical and physiological features of the woody 
Amborella and Austrobaileyales are noteworthy. Ambo- 
rella lacks vessel elements, and Austrobaileyales have ves- 
sel elements with features intermediate between tracheids 
and typical vessel elements (Carlquist and Schneider 2001, 
2002). These anatomical characters and associated physi- 
ological features led to the hypothesis that the earliest an- 
giosperms were understory shrubs, perhaps lacking vessel 
elements and having lower transpiration and stem water 
movement than found in most living angiosperms (Feild 
et al. 2000a,b, 2003a,b, 2004). These plants were found 
in habitats referred to as “dark and disturbed.” The first 
angiosperms may therefore have been understory shrubs 
living in partially shaded habitats and depending on dis- 
turbance to open up the canopy, providing new sites for 
colonization. 
The alternative hypothesis is that the earliest angio- 
sperms were aquatic. An aquatic origin of angiosperms is 
supported by the fact that several of the earliest known fos- 
sil angiosperms were aquatic. Archaefructus represents one 
of the oldest, most complete angiosperm fossils (Sun et al. 
2002; see above). On the basis of morphology, it clearly 
was aquatic. The phylogenetic placement of Archaefruc- 
tus as either sister to all extant angiosperms (Sun et al. 

34 Chapter 2 
2002) or within Nymphaeaceae (Friis et al. 2003a), plus 
the phylogenetic position of extant Nymphaeales (water lil- 
ies, below) as an early-diverging branch, lends support to 
the view that the aquatic habit arose early in angiosperm 
history and that perhaps the earliest angiosperms were 
aquatic. The discovery that Hydatellaceae are part of the 
water lily clade (Saarela et al. 2007) greatly increased the 
extant morphological diversity encompassed by the Nym- 
phaeales and also raised questions concerning the extent of 
diversity in extinct members of the clade, as well as other 
basal angiosperm lineages. Such findings raise the possibil- 
ity that Nymphaeales were once much more diverse and 
could have encompassed Archaefructus as well as other 
now-extinct lineages (Doyle and Endress 2010; see Chap- 
ters 3 and 4). Archaefructus represents well the difficulty 
in placing fossil lineages that are morphologically distinct 
with no clear synapomorphies with extant taxa. It is pru- 
dent to keep an open mind regarding the placement of 
Archaefructus and other fossils. Nonetheless, the early ap- 
pearance of Nymphaeales (Friis et al. 2001), together with 
the discovery that some of the oldest angiosperm fossils 
are aquatic, reinforced the hypothesis that the earliest an- 
giosperms may have been aquatic—that is, “wet and wild” 
(D. Dilcher pers. comm.; see Coiffard et al. 2007). 

Phylogeny of Angiosperms 
An Overview 
INTRODUCTION 
Enormous interest and effort have been invested since the 
1990s in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships of the 
angiosperms. The importance of using a phylogenetic ap- 
proach to evaluate evolutionary hypotheses has long been 
recognized, and many comparisons are best made in light of 
a firm understanding of angiosperm relationships. A robust 
phylogenetic underpinning for flowering plants is of value 
not only to systematists but also to scientists in diverse dis- 
ciplines, including evolutionary biologists, physiologists, 
ecologists, molecular biologists, and genomicists (see “Im- 
plications for the Study of Model Organisms,” below). 
Here we review efforts to reconstruct angiosperm phy- 
logeny using morphology, RNA (in early studies) and par- 
ticularly DNA sequence data, as well as combined mor- 
phology and DNA datasets. Historically, some of the largest 
phylogenetic analyses conducted to date for any group of 
organisms have involved the angiosperms. This was true 
in the early stages of molecular phylogenetics (e.g., Chase 
et al. 1993; KaAllersj6 et al. 1998; D. Soltis et al. 2000) 
and continues today with large supertree and supermatrix 
analyses (e.g., Davies et al. 2004; S. A. Smith et al. 2009, 
2011). As a result, valuable lessons in data analysis have 
also been learned, and these have general implications that 
we also briefly review. In addition, we review the best esti- 
mate of phylogeny now available for the angiosperms and 
compare these relationships with traditional, morphology- 
based classifications from the late 1900s. The molecular 
estimates of phylogeny provided the stimulus for a revised 
classification of angiosperms (see Chapter 12). The broad 
DNA-based topologies also provide evidence for multiple 
episodes of rapid radiation in the flowering plants and have 
facilitated estimation of the ages of major diversification 
events.

MORPHOLOGY AND “MODERN” 
CLASSIFICATIONS 
Many intuitive reconstructions of angiosperm evolution 
and relationships 
(e.g., Bessey 1915; Cronquist 1968, 
1981; Takhtajan 1969, 1980, 1987, 1997; Stebbins 1974; 
Thorne 1976) appeared during the past century. These 
classifications were based on the broad plant knowledge 
of the investigator and his “gut feelings” as to the big pic- 
ture of angiosperm relationships based on the characters 
he emphasized. It was not until the late 1980s that explicit 
analyses of angiosperm phylogeny were initiated. These pi- 
oneering investigations relied solely on evidence from mor- 
phology (e.g., Donoghue and Doyle 1989a,b; Loconte and 
Stevenson 1991) and set the stage for large phylogenetic 
analyses based on DNA sequences, as well as DNA plus 
morphology. These studies provided important initial in- 
sights, indicating, for example, that dicotyledonous angio- 
sperms (traditionally referred to as dicots) were not mono- 
phyletic. Instead, the monocots were nested among clades 
of what were referred to as “primitive dicots.” Although di- 
cots as a whole were not monophyletic, most dicots formed 
a well-marked clade that was named the eudicots (Doyle

and Hotton 1991) or tricolpates (Donoghue and Doyle 
1989a,b; Judd and Olmstead 2004). 
Initial phylogenetic studies using morphology provided 
conflicting results regarding the root of the angiosperm tree, 
focusing attention on several possible groups. The analysis 
of Donoghue and Doyle (1989b), which used 62 binary 
characters for 20 placeholders, placed a Magnoliales clade 
as sister to all other angiosperms, followed by other woody 
magnoliids such as Laurales and a winteroid group (see 
also Doyle and Donoghue 1993) (Fig. 3.1). However, the 
composition of these clades did not agree with DNA-based 
circumscriptions that soon followed (see below and Chap- 
ter 5). Donoghue and Doyle (1989a) also focused atten- 
tion on a group they referred to as paleoherbs that included 
Piperaceae, Saururaceae, Aristolochiaceae, Nymphaeales 
(sensu APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), and also monocots. 
But again, DNA results that soon followed did not support 
such a grouping (although Piperaceae, Saururaceae, and 
Aristolochiaceae are a clade). 
In contrast, the phylogenetic analysis of morphological 
data conducted by Loconte and Stevenson (1991) placed 
Calycanthaceae as sister to all other angiosperms (this fam- 
ily was later shown to a member of Laurales; see Chap- 
ter 5). Analysis of a larger morphological dataset for basal 
angiosperms (108 morphological characters for 52 taxa; 
Doyle and Endress 2000).found trees that were more simi- 
lar to those obtained with DNA sequence data. Analysis 
of a large non-DNA dataset, consisting of morphological, 
anatomical, and chemical data for 151 angiosperms (Nandi 
et al. 1998), recovered a topology that was similar to trees 
obtained with molecular datasets. For example, a grade of 
angiosperms was recovered that included basal lineages as 
well as the monocots; the eudicots formed a clade. Thus, 
there appears to be considerable phylogenetic signal in 
these non-DNA datasets that in many instances agrees with 
topologies derived from sequence data alone (Chase et al. 
2000b; also discussed below in “Single-Gene Studies” and 
“Combining DNA Datasets”). 
SINGLE-GENE, STUDIES: 
A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
Initial efforts to reconstruct angiosperm phylogeny on a 
broad scale with sequence data actually employed RNA 
sequences. Hamby and Zimmer (1992) constructed a data- 
- 
set of partial 18S and 26S rRNA sequences for 60 taxa. 
Although small by present standards, this analysis was a 
huge undertaking at that time. Hamby and Zimmer (1992) 
identified Nymphaeales as sister to all other angiosperms 
(Amborella was not sampled), showed monocots to be 
nested within a grade of early-branching “dicots,” and re- 
covered a eudicot clade. 
The phylogenetic analysis of rbcL sequence data for 
499 species of seed plants (Chase et al. 1993) is a land- 
mark study for several reasons. First, it was a huge dataset 
for that time period and for many years remained one of 
the largest analyses conducted for any group of organisms. 
Chase et al. (1993) ushered in a new era of investigation in 
which numerous representatives were used to reconstruct 
phylogeny for large, enigmatic groups. From a historical 
standpoint, this study was significant in that the prevail- 
ing view at that time was that large datasets could not be 
analyzed phylogenetically (e.g., Graur et al. 1996). Instead, 
it was recommended that they be broken into smaller data- 
sets or pruned to include only a few exemplars. However, it 
was evident to many angiosperm systematists that smaller 
matrices did not produce the same topologies obtained 
with more exhaustive sampling (reviewed in Chase and 
Albert 1998; D. Soltis et al. 1998), so they went against 
the prevailing view of the time and constructed increasingly 
larger datasets, combining genes for more taxa. 

The study by Chase et al. (1993) also stretched the limits 
of analytical capabilities available at that time (reviewed in 
Chase and Albert 1998). Initial efforts to analyze the large 
rbcL data matrix actually failed because versions of the 
phylogenetic program PAUP (Swofford 1991) then avail- 
able could not handle the number of terminals (500 se- 
quences). Thus, coincident with the compilation of this 
large matrix was the development of software and search 
strategies that were appropriate for such large datasets. Of 
course, rapid developments in analytical capabilities have 
occurred since that time—but the Chase et al. (1993) analy- 
sis served as a stimulus to the community. As reviewed in 
“Lessons Learned” below, incredible advances in data anal- 
ysis have continued, and at this point numerous tools and 
programs are available, permitting the analysis of genome- 
scale data (e.g., ASTRAL; Mirarab et al. 2014). Neverthe- 
less, this movement was spurred, in part, by the large data- 
sets assembled early on by angiosperm systematists. Finally, 
Chase et al. (1993) represented a massive collaboration of 
42 investigators, most of whom contributed unpublished 
sequences to the effort because they appreciated the cen- 
tral importance of such an endeavor to angiosperm system- 
atics. This spirit of collaboration among botanists in the 
early stages of the molecular era has continued and enabled 
plant systematists to rapidly achieve a tremendous under- 
standing of angiosperm, as well as green plant, phylogeny. 
This collaborative approach emerged as a model for 
other large-scale botanical projects, including the Deep 
Green, Deep Time, and Deep Gene initiatives, as well as 
the Grass Phylogeny Working Group (2000, 2012), the Le- 
gume Phylogeny Working Group (2013), Ericaceae Work- 
ing Group (Kron et al. 2002), the Compositae Alliance 
(Funk et al. 2012), and multiple tree of life efforts (e.g., 
Angiosperm Tree of Life; Monocot Tree of Life). The im- 
pact of Chase et al. (1993) and subsequent multi-authored 
collaborations on the angiosperms (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 
1997a,b, 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b) was also much 
broader than angiosperm phylogeny, in that these efforts 
ushered in a cultural change, demonstrating that big phy- 
logeny was also big science and providing a framework for 
similar efforts in diverse groups of organisms and a model 
for the National Science Foundation’s Assembling the Tree 
of Life Program. 
In the trees of Chase et al. (1993), Ceratophyllum was 
sister to all other angiosperms (Fig. 3.2A). However, this 
placement was soon shown to be an artifact (see Chap- 
ter 4). The remaining noneudicot angiosperms—several 
clades of traditional dicots (e.g., clades referred to then 
as Laurales, Magnoliales, paleoherbs) 
as well as the 
monocots—formed a clade sister to the eudicots. Within 
the eudicots, several large clades were recovered, including 
the asterid, rosid, and caryophyllid clades. Large subclades

2000a). (Modified from Chase and Albert 1998.) (A) Comparison of rbcl and

were also suggested within these major clades (e.g., rosid I, 
rosid II, asterid I, asterid II). Much of the basic topology 
from this initial broad analysis of rbcL sequences has 
been further supported and refined by additional analyses 
(reviewed in “Combining DNA Datasets” and “Lessons 
Learned” sections). 

38 Chapter 3 
The success of Chase et al. (1993) prompted the ques- 
tion of what topologies would be recovered by other genes, 
especially nuclear genes. Although partial sequences of 
18S rRNA had been used to infer angiosperm relationships 
(Hamby and Zimmer 1992), doubts persisted about the 
usefulness of 18S rDNA sequences for phylogeny recon- 
struction (reviewed in Nickrent and Soltis 1995; D. Soltis 
et al. 1997a,b). Analysis of 232 entire 18S rDNA sequences 
(D. Soltis et al. 1997a) revealed that, although 18S rDNA 
provided lower resolution than rbcL, the 18S rDNA and 
rbcL topologies were highly concordant (Fig. 3.2). Differ- 
ences were minor, and none of these received bootstrap 
support above 50%. Over a decade later, similar topolo- 
gies have now been recovered with very large datasets of 
nearly complete 18S + 26S rDNA sequences (e.g., Soltis 
et al. 2011; Maia et al. 2014). 
Sequences for atpB, a second plastid gene similar in rate 
of evolution to rbcL (Ritland and Clegg 1987; Hoot et al. 
1995a), revealed relationships highly similar to those re- 
covered with 18S rDNA and rbcL alone (Savolainen et al. 
2000a) (Fig. 3.2). Use of the partition homogeneity test re- 
vealed that the greatest incongruence among the datasets 
actually involved the two plastid genes (atpB and rbcL), 
datasets that many would argue could be combined a priori 
(see D. Soltis et al. 1998). 
Criticisms of Chase et al. (1993) had less to do with 
the topology itself than with issues of data analysis. Some 
maintained that the analysis was flawed in that the short- 
est trees had not been obtained. In fact, Chase et al. (1993) 
knew that shorter trees could be obtained but did not feel 
that lengthier searches for shorter trees would significantly 
alter the outcome (Chase and Albert 1998). Rice et al. 
(1997) conducted a lengthy reanalysis of the Chase et al. 
(1993) rbcL data matrix. Although they did find shorter 
trees than those reported in 1993, these did not signifi- 
cantly alter the big picture of angiosperm phylogeny and 
essentially reinforced the conclusions of Chase et al. (1993). 
Subsequent studies indicated that lengthy searches of ma- 
trices with many taxa and an insufficient number of char- 
acters are ineffective (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 1997a,b, 1998; 
Chase and Cox 1998; Nei et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 
2000a; Takahashi and Nei 2000; see “Lessons Learned,” 
below). 
FARLY EFFORTS IN COMBINING 
DNA DATASETS 
Combining DNA datasets is now common, but this process 
represented a profound change in mindset 20 years ago. 
Although the single-gene trees (rbcL, atpB, 18S rDNA) for 
angiosperms were highly similar (Fig. 3.2), internal support 
for many major clades and the spine of the tree was lack- 
ing (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 1997a,b, 1998; Chase and Albert 
1998). Thus, an immediate interest in combining datasets 
emerged. Because of the cooperation that existed among 
many angiosperm systematists, the sequences for rbcL, 
atpB, and 18S rDNA were often from the same species or 
genus and in many cases from the same DNA extraction, 
facilitating direct combination of multiple molecular data- 
sets. This phase of angiosperm phylogenetics started with 
the combination of data for these few genes and continues 
today with the assembly of ever-larger datasets involving 
numerous genes (e.g., the complete plastid genome or hun- 
dreds of nuclear genes) for hundreds (and in some cases 
thousands) of exemplars. 
Initial combinations of large DNA datasets were con- 
ducted primarily as experiments to assess the effect of ad- 
ditional data on the phylogenetic analysis of large datasets 
(D. Soltis et al. 1997a, 1998; Chase and Cox 1998) and 
provided the impetus for two projects that combined DNA 
datasets on a large scale across the angiosperms. One com- 
bined rbcL and atpB sequences for 357 taxa (Savolainen 
et al. 2000a); the second combined rbcL, atpB, and 
18S rDNA sequences for 567 taxa (P. Soltis et al. 1999a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000). These analyses provided topologies 
with greater resolution and support than obtained in the 
single-gene trees. 
Combined datasets continued to grow in terms of num- 
bers of genes. 
A 17-gene angiosperm phylogenetic frame- 
work was assembled for 640 species (Soltis et al. 2011), 
the major features of which are discussed in “The Angio- 
sperm Phylogenetic Framework: An Overview,” below. 
Other studies have compiled supermatrices for thousands 
of angiosperms (see below), while still others have com- 
bined multiple molecular datasets for large clades of inter- 
est, such as monocots, rosids, and asterids, and these efforts 
are discussed in later chapters. Large datasets of complete 
plastid genomes and large numbers of nuclear genes (see 
below) have also been compiled, but generally for smaller 
numbers of taxa than in the 17-gene framework, although 
a recent analysis of over 1000 complete (or nearly so) plas- 
tid genomes and a comparable dataset of nuclear genes 
(Gitzendanner, Wickett, and Leebens-Mack et al. in prep.) 
represent a dramatic up-scaling in “big data” and certainly 
represent the norm for the future. 
Molecular and morphological datasets for angiosperms 
have also been combined (e.g., morphology and partial 18S 
and 26S rRNA sequences, Doyle et al. 1994; non-DNA 
characters and rbcL, Nandi et al. 1998; morphology and 
rbcL, atpB, and 18S rDNA sequences, Doyle and Endress 
2000); several analyses have used rbcL, atpB, 18S rDNA, 
and morphology and added fossils (e.g., Doyle and Endress 
2010; Endress and Doyle 2009). 

LESSONS LEARNED 
THE ANALYSIS OF 
LARGE DATASETS 
Phylogeny reconstruction of angiosperms prompted the de- 
velopment of methods for analyzing large datasets. Only 
two decades ago, analyses of datasets of 500 or more termi- 
nals were considered impossible (e.g., Patterson et al. 1993; 
Hillis et al. 1994; Hillis 1995). Simulation studies (Hillis 
et al. 1994) indicated that in some instances correct phylog- 
eny reconstruction for only four taxa would require more 
than 10,000 bp of DNA sequence data, implying much 
greater difficulty with large datasets and stimulating the 
suggestion that phylogenetic problems be broken into a se- 
ries of smaller problems, one extreme being a large number 
of four-taxon questions (Graur et al. 1996). Large datasets 
also pose problems because of the large number of possible 
trees that arise with increasing numbers of taxa (Felsen- 
stein 1978a) and a consequent lack of confidence that an 
analysis has found the optimal tree or trees. For example, 
for 228 taxa (the number of species analyzed by D. Soltis 
et al. 1997a), the number of possible trees is 1.2 x 10°”, 
which is more than the number of atoms in the universe 
(Hillis 1996). Despite these dire predictions, angiosperm 
systematists continued to conduct analyses involving hun- 
dreds of species, with promising results (reviewed below). 
The systematics community as a whole continues to 
learn valuable lessons from analyses conducted on angio- 
sperms that now involve thousands of taxa. Now, two de- 
cades after the first large trees were produced, systematists 
are routinely building trees with many hundreds to thou- 
sands of taxa, including comprehensive trees for all green 
plants, and even the Tree of Life for all organisms (below). 
MORE IS BETTER (USUALLY) 
Initial combinations of large DNA datasets for two and 
three genes revealed that one solution to the computational 
problems posed by large datasets was simply to add both 
taxa and characters (D. Soltis et al. 1997a, 1998; Chase and 
Cox 1998). This approach resulted in much faster compu- 
tational run times, which have the advantage that more 
thorough analyses of tree space can be conducted in a given 
time. In addition, internal support for clades is much higher 
in trees from combined datasets than in trees from separate 
datasets (Fig. 3.3; D. Soltis et al. 1998). In analyses of rbcL, 
atpB, and 18S rDNA, some clades received internal support 
above 50% in the combined trees, but not in trees from 
the separate datasets. Thus, through combining datasets for 
two or three genes, strong jackknife or bootstrap support

More is better—the importance of adding characters. The number 
of angiosperm clades (y-axis) having bootstrap support above 50% in phyloge- 
netic analysis of separate and combined DNA sequence datasets increases as 
genes are added. (Modified from D. Soltis et al. 1998.) 
was evident for the first time for most of the major clades 
of flowering plants. The greater signal present in the com- 
bined dataset relative to individual datasets (see Chase and 
Cox 1998; D. Soltis et al. 1998; Bremer et al. 1999) pro- 
duced starting trees much closer to the best trees ultimately 
obtained, thereby speeding up analyses and allowing for 
more thorough exploration of tree space. Furthermore, the 
combined signal from multiple genes clarifies historical 
patterns relative to noise in the dataset. These empirical re- 
sults for large datasets complement the simulation studies 
of Hillis (1996) and Graybeal (1998). 
Appropriate taxon sampling is crucial for successful 
phylogeny reconstruction (e.g., Pollock et al. 2002; Zwickl 
and Hillis 2002; Hillis et al. 2003; D. Soltis et al. 2004; 
but see Rosenberg and Kumar 2001). However, this ap- 
pears to be a lesson that has to be learned repeatedly. 
Early analyses of angiosperm phylogeny with single genes 
sometimes employed only a few taxa and yielded spuri- 
ous results. Similarly, early analyses of whole plastid ge- 
nomes (e.g., Goremykin et al. 2003, 2004) relied on a large 
number of characters, but for a small number of taxa. The 
Goremykin et al. analyses yielded trees that were clearly 
at odds with phylogenetic trees based on more taxa but 
fewer genes. The Goremykin et al. (2003, 2004) topologies 

40 Chapter 3 
were shown to be attributable to limited taxon sampling 
(D. Soltis and Soltis 2004b; D. Soltis et al. 2004; Leebens- 
Mack et al. 2005). More recent efforts using complete 
plastid genomes and broader taxon sampling (Jansen et al. 
2007; Moore et al. 2007, 2010; Ruhfel et al. 2014) have 
produced nearly identical topologies to those realized with 
fewer genes but broad sampling. However, complete plastid 
genome sequencing has yielded greatly improved bootstrap 
support. Similarly, some large datasets of nuclear genes 
suffered from poor taxon sampling in some parts of the 
tree. However, as taxon sampling has improved, topolo- 
gies derived from nuclear, plastid, as well as mitochon- 
drial genes have largely converged, as reviewed below. But 
there are important areas of disagreement (e.g., the COM 
clade; Mesangiospermae; see below and Chapter 10), and 
these are foci for future study. These recent studies of large 
nuclear vs. plastid datasets also raise cautionary notes re- 
garding the a priori combination of datasets from multiple 
subcellular genomes. 
THE FUTURE OF PARSIMONY 
ANALYSLS 
Most of the phylogenetic results described in the preceding 
sections were obtained via parsimony analysis, the method 
of choice in the 1990s to early 2000s for large datasets, 
for both philosophical and practical reasons. Although 
maximal likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods now of- 
fer feasible alternatives, the lessons learned through par- 
simony analyses of angiosperms remain relevant, and we 
here provide a historical perspective on the development of 
phylogenetic methods for large datasets. Programs for find- 
ing most parsimonious (i.e., shortest) trees, such as Hen- 
nig86 (Farris 1988), NONA (Goloboff 1993), and PAUP 
(Swofford 1993), were developed for use on what would 
now be considered small datasets. The numerous improve- 
ments available in PAUP* 4.0, such as the faster speed at 
which heuristic parsimony searches are conducted, were a 
great asset to those interested in analyzing large datasets 
with parsimony. An important development in the analysis 
of large datasets via parsimony was the RATCHET, which 
greatly facilitates the ability to find shorter trees (Nixon 
1999; implemented in Winclada, Nixon 2000; and with 
NONA, Goloboff 1993; www.cladistics.com). When ap- 
plied to the 567-taxon matrix of three genes for angio- 
sperms, the RATCHET quickly found trees shorter than 
those found using PAUP* 4.0 (Swofford 1999; see D. Soltis 
et al. 2000). The useful TNT program has been widely used 
in parsimony analyses (Goloboff et al. 2008) and is very 
effective in the analysis of large datasets, including a study 
of over 73,000 taxa (Goloboff et al. 2009). 
A significant problem with the analysis of large datasets 
had long been the difficulty in assessing internal support 
for clades. Large datasets are not amenable to standard 
bootstrapping (Felsenstein 1985) and Bremer support (de- 
cay) analysis (Bremer 1988). The large angiosperm datasets 
were therefore also a stimulus for the adoption of com- 
putational approaches, such as “fast” or “quick” search 
techniques using bootstrapping (Swofford 1999) or jack- 
knifing (Farris et al. 1996). The rationale for quick searches 
is that they sample trees from many starting points at the 
expense of extensive swapping on trees from a single start- 
ing point. Only those clades above some minimal threshold 
of internal support (e.g., a bootstrap or jackknife value of 
50%) appear in the consensus of trees from these repli- 
cate searches. The well-supported clades appear relatively 
quickly in the analysis of big datasets—continued branch- 
swapping involving poorly supported branches can never 
result in strongly supported clades. Simulation studies (Nei 
et al. 1998; Takahashi and Nei 2000), as well as analyses 
of the large angiosperm datasets (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 1998, 
2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a), provided support for the 
premise that lengthy parsimony analyses of large datasets 
may be unnecessary. The parsimony jackknife method (Far- 
ris 1996; Farris et al. 1996), for example, was well suited 
for the quick analysis of large datasets. Mort et al. (2000) 
found that the fast and standard methods are highly com- 
. 
parable, particularly at higher levels of support (85% and 
higher). However, as support for clades decreases, percent- 
ages from the fast methods tended to be lower than val- 
ues obtained from the standard bootstrap. For a further 
comparison of fast and standard methods on empirical and 
simulated datasets, see Mort et al. (2000), DeBry and Olm- 
stead (2000), and Salamin et al. (2003). 
Although parsimony continues to be used in phyloge- 
netic analyses (particularly with morphological data), both 
Bayesian and ML methods, with their model-based foun- 
dations, are now more commonly used than parsimony in 
molecular phylogenetics. 
As ML approaches, in particular, 
improve (see below), an intriguing question arises: is parsi- 
mony analysis headed for extinction in phylogenetic analy- 
sis? In the following sections, we review Bayesian and ML 
methods and their contributions to our understanding of 
angiosperm phylogeny. 
BAYESIAN INFERENCE 
Bayesian approaches to phylogeny reconstruction were first 
implemented by Huelsenbeck et al. (2001, 2002) with the 
popular program MrBayes. This approach affords the op- 
portunity to analyze relatively large datasets and obtain a 
measure of confidence (posterior probability values, PP), 

although the MrBayes program has large computer mem- 
ory requirements. Using MrBayes and an atpB dataset for 
more than 300 angiosperms (from Savolainen et al. 2000a), 
Huelsenbeck et al. (2001, 2002) obtained a topology with 
atpB alone that was well supported and highly similar to 
that obtained using three genes (D. Soltis et al. 2000). How- 
ever, the PP for clades obtained in Bayesian analyses are gen- 
erally higher than corresponding bootstrap or jackknife per- 
centages (e.g., Huelsenbeck et al. 2001; Miller et al. 2002; 
Wilcox et al. 2002), perhaps providing misleading estimates 
of clade support (Suzuki et al. 2002; Erixon et al. 2003). 
Soltis et al. (2007c) conducted a Bayesian reanalysis of 
the 3-gene, 567-taxon dataset for angiosperms (P. Soltis 
et al. 1999a; D. Soltis et al. 2000), revealing the analyti- 
cal challenges posed by such large datasets with MrBayes. 
For example, determining stationarity in Markov chains in 
analyses of large datasets is difficult. Significantly, Bayes- 
ian analyses recovered a topology highly similar to that 
found previously with parsimony (compare D. Soltis et al. 
2000 with Soltis et al. 2007c). However, a few topological 
differences were found between the Bayesian and shortest 
parsimony trees obtained for the same dataset, the most 
noteworthy of which is that a clade (PP = 0.99) of Ambo- 
rellaceae 
+ Nymphaeales is sister to all other extant an- 
giosperms (PP = 1.0) in the Bayesian tree, whereas Ambo- 
rellaceae alone are sister to all other extant angiosperms 
with parsimony. The relationship of Amborellaceae and 
Nymphaeales is discussed below in more detail. Addition- 
ally, the Bayesian analysis indicated that magnoliids and 
Chloranthaceae (as part of an unresolved trichotomy) are 
sister to a major clade of Ceratophyllum + eudicots. In 
contrast, magnoliids and Chloranthaceae were sister to the 
monocots in the original parsimony analyses. Many clades 
that received moderate to low jackknife support in parsi- 
mony analyses received PP values of 1.0. Recovery of high 
PP values relative to bootstrap values has been a common 
feature of Bayesian vs. parsimony comparisons. 
BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees; 
Drummond and Rambaut 2007) is an alternative Bayesian 
analysis package that simultaneously reconstructs phylog- 
eny and estimates divergence times. Application of BEAST 
to the 567-taxon angiosperm dataset for rbcL, atpB, and 
18S rDNA obtained divergence times for major clades close 
to those inferred from the fossil record (Bell et al. 2010). 
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN 
ML INFERENCE 
Ten years ago, both parsimony and Bayesian methods were 
useful means of analyzing very large datasets. In fact, until 
recently, parsimony and Bayesian approaches were the only 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview 
41 
means of analyzing large datasets; most datasets were sim- 
ply too large for ML, which was once limited to investiga- 
tions of 50 or fewer taxa. However, with recent advances 
in ML approaches, it is now possible to conduct analyses of 
thousands of taxa in a timely fashion (e.g., GARLI, Zwickl 
2006; RAxML, Stamatakis 2014). A fast bootstrapping 
option can also be employed, even in large ML analyses 
(Stamatakis et al. 2008). For example, S. A. Smith et al. 
(2011) conducted an ML analysis of over 55,000 seed 
plants. As a result, ML has now emerged as the phyloge- 
netic method of choice over Bayesian approaches, which 
typically take much longer. 
GENE TREE PARSIMONY 
The current capability to construct massive alignments of 
genome-scale data provides opportunities as well as chal- 
lenges. Phylogenetic analyses using genome-scale datasets 
must somehow deal with incongruence among gene trees; 
this can be particularly challenging when many nuclear 
gene trees are constructed, especially in plants, due to the 
high frequency of gene duplications and losses (many due 
to polyploidy) (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2009; Jiao et al. 2011, 
2012). As a result, genes may have complex evolutionary 
histories. One method for reconstructing species trees from 
nuclear genes is to identify the species tree that implies the 
minimum number of events that cause conflict among the 
underlying gene trees (e.g., Goodman et al. 1979; Maddi- 
son 1997). An approach called Gene Tree Parsimony (GTP) 
uses a collection of gene trees and then attempts to find a 
species tree that contains all of the taxa present in the gene 
trees and that also contains the fewest gene duplications or 
duplications and losses across the tree. 
Long computer run times initially limited the use of 
the GTP approach on large-scale datasets (Burleigh et al. 
2011). However, using new software that incorporates re- 
cent algorithmic advances, Burleigh et al. (2011) tested the 
performance of GTP on a vascular plant dataset (focused 
mainly on seed plant relationships, angiosperms in particu- 
lar) of 18,896 gene trees and 510,922 protein sequences 
from 136 vascular plant taxa, with a resulting combined 
alignment length of >2.9 million characters. Significantly, 
the inferred relationships from the GTP analysis were 
highly similar to previous large-scale studies, with the phy- 
logenetic framework essentially the same as in Soltis et al. 
(2011) and Moore et al. (2007). 
COALESCENCE METHODS 
For the past decade or more, systematists have been rou- 
tinely combining multiple molecular datasets via concat- 

42 Chapter 3 
enation. Coalescence methods, which stress the distinction 
between gene trees and species trees, have recently emerged 
as an intriguing alternative approach to simple concatena- 
tion (e.g., Liu et al. 2009, 2010; Mirarab et al. 2014). These 
methods therefore attempt to take into account and accom- 
modate heterogeneity among individual gene trees. 
Coalescence methods have recently been applied to green 
plant phylogeny, and we will undoubtedly see many more 
applications in the near future. Zhong et al. (2013) applied 
the multispecies coalescent to examine the sister group to 
land plants, stating that concatenation methods that had 
been conducted to address this problem were basically 
flawed due to conflicting underlying gene trees (reviewed in 
Springer and Gatesy 2014), and inferred that Zygnematales 
are sister to land plants. Springer and Gatesy (2014) criti- 
cized several aspects of the Zhong et al. (2013) analysis, 
including missing sequences, and suggested that coalescent 
approaches may not be reliable for such deep questions of 
phylogenetic inference (but see Zhong et al. 2014). In their 
own coalescent analyses, Springer and Gatesy (2014) re- 
covered Zygnematales + Coleochaetales as sister to land 
plants. Interestingly, recent large-scale concatenation anal- 
yses of complete plastid genome sequences (Ruhfel et al. 
2014) and large nuclear gene datasets (Wickett et al. 2014) 
have both recovered Zygnematales as sister to land plants, 
suggesting that in this case the two methods have largely 
converged on the same answer. Whereas Wickett et al. 
(2014) employed both concatenation and coalescent meth- 
ods in their examination of land plant relationships and 
found comparable results, especially for angiosperms, Xi 
et al. (2014), in their coalescent analysis to address the root 
of the angiosperms, found Amborella + Nuphar as sister to 
the rest of the angiosperms rather than Amborella alone, 
as supported in the coalescent analyses of Wickett et al. 
(2014); see Chapter 4 for further discussion of the applica- 
tion of coalescent methods to deep divergences. 
MEGATREES AND SUPERTREES 
Large phylogenetic trees have seen increasing use in re- 
cent years and have become fundamental for addressing 
broad evolutionary and ecological questions (see below). 
Two basic methods have been used to build very large trees: 
supertrees and supermatrices, with pros and cons to both 
approaches. 
Megatrees (or grafted supertrees) should not be con- 
fused with supertrees (e.g., Sanderson et al. 1998; Liu et al. 
2001; Salamin et al. 2002). With the megatree approach, 
a backbone topology is used, and other topologies repre- 
senting subsets of the group under investigation are simply 
grafted to that backbone. An example of a megatree that is 
a valuable resource is that for the Asteraceae (Funk et al. 
2009a,b). 
As an alternative to megatrees, previously reconstructed 
topologies (source trees) that share some but not necessarily 
all component taxa can be combined using one of several 
available algorithms to create a supertree. Although large 
multigene (supermatrix) analyses are often favored and the 
best methods of supertree construction are still debated, 
combinable data are not always available, and megatrees 
and supertrees thus offer possible solutions. 
Salamin et al. (2002) showed that supertrees offer a 
valuable approach for a large number of taxa. Their su- 
pertrees for grasses‘closely matched the combined “total 
evidence” phylogenetic tree provided by the Grass Phy- 
logeny Working Group (GPWG 2001, 2012). A supertree 
for angiosperms (Davies et al. 2004) using 27 source trees 
represented the first attempt to assemble a comprehensive 
tree for angiosperms (Davies et al. 2004) and has been a 
useful tool for comparative studies. Using rbcL sequence 
data and fossil calibrations, Davies et al. (2004) estimated 
the relative timing of branching events. Although diversifi- 
cation rates are highly constant across time windows, there 
is evidence for an apparent increase in diversification rates 
within more recent timeframes. The top 10 major shifts in 
diversification rates cannot easily be attributed to the ac- 
tion of a few key innovations but instead are likely attrib- 
. 
uted to a more complex process of diversification, reflect- 
ing the interaction of biological traits and the environment. 
These diversification results are largely in agreement with 
other, more recent efforts to examine diversification in an- 
giosperms (e.g., Smith et al. 2011; Tank et al. 2015; see 
below). 
Although megatrees and supertrees both have impor- 
tant possible roles as exploratory tools for developing 
new hypotheses, current efforts seem to be primarily fo- 
cused on supermatrices. However, the largest supertree yet 
constructed—the Open Tree of Life—includes all named 
species of angiosperms and provides a new resource for an- 
giosperm phylogenetics and comparative analyses (htttp:// 
tree.opentreeoflife.org). 
SUPERMATRICES AND 
MEGAPHYLOGENY 
One important advantage of a supermatrix approach com- 
pared to supertree approaches is that with the former the 
resulting trees are based on the underlying data and as 
a result have branch lengths, which are fundamental for 
many downstream analyses (e.g., diversification rates). We 
note it is possible to add branch lengths to supertrees (e.g., 
Torices 2010; Brinkmeyer et al. 2011), but a supermatrix 

gt 
is nonetheless preferred if branch lengths are desired. But 
how best to construct these supermatrices? The standard 
supermatrix approach infers trees from large matrices of 
concatenated alignments of genes with partial taxonomic 
overlap (de Queiroz and Gatesy 2007). S. A. Smith et al. 
(2009) describe what they refer to as a “modified superma- 
trix method” that they have termed megaphylogeny. The 
megaphylogeny approach uses sequences from databases 
in conjunction with taxonomic hierarchies—in this way, 
S. A. Smith et al. (2009) made very large phylogenetic trees 
with denser matrices than might be present in standard su- 
permatrices using an algorithm that greatly reduced the run 
time of phylogeny construction. This approach assuines 
that the sample of species in GenBank is at least roughly 
proportional to the actual species diversity of different lin- 
eages—so this may be a possible weakness. Despite poten- 
tial problems in tree inference at massive scales, the mega- 
phylogeny approach has been very useful (e.g., Smith and 
Donoghue 2008; Smith and Beaulieu 2009; Edwards and 
Smith 2010; Goldberg et al. 2010; see examples below in 
the Big Trees section). 
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MISSING 
DATA CAN BE TOLERATED 
In the early years of molecular phylogenetics, every effort 
was made to ensure that all cells of a data matrix were 
complete, with every gene sequence obtained for every 
taxon investigated (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000). But as data- 
sets grew to include more and more taxa and genes, and 
as supermatrices were constructed from data taken from 
GenBank (see Supermatrices and Megaphylogeny section), 
this approach became impractical. Whether missing data 
are problematic in phylogenetic inference is therefore an 
important issue. Importantly, both simulation and empiri- 
cal studies generally agree that surprisingly large amounts 
of missing data have little (if any) negative effect (reviewed 
in Wiens and Morrill 2011), with implications for inclu- 
sion of both incompletely known fossils and samples for 
which molecular and/or morphological characters are miss- 
ing. As examples, in Saxifragales a supermatrix was con- 
structed with 950 species and a length of 48,465 charac- 
ters. The supermatrix contains 2,379,996 nucleotides and 
has 94.83% missing data. The resulting topology was in 
close agreement with studies using far fewer taxa but many 
more nucleotides per species (Soltis et al. 2013). Similarly, 
in a supermatrix analysis of legumes having 228 terminals, 
95% of the data were missing (McMahon and Sanderson 
2006), yet a reasonable topology was obtained. Similar re- 
sults were obtained for all green plants, with a matrix with 
~84% missing data (Driskell et al. 2004). 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview 
43 
MOLECULAR EVOLUTION 
Large DNA datasets, for plastid, mtDNA, and nuclear 
genes, have provided a wealth of data for studies of mo- 
lecular evolution, a large topic for which we provide only 
a short overview with appropriate references (see Palmer 
1987; D. Soltis and Soltis 1998 for general overview; see 
also Bousquet et al. 1992; Albert et al. 1994; Hoot et al. 
1995a; Kellogg and Juliano 1997; Laroche et al. 1997; 
Chase and Albert 1998; Chase and Cox 1998; Olmstead 
et al. 1998; P. Soltis and Soltis 1998; Savolainen et al. 
2000a,b; Cho et al. 2004; Lancaster 2010). 
Rates of molecular evolution vary considerably between 
closely related lineages and between genes and genomes. 
For example, mitochondrial substitution 
rates 
are 
ex- 
traordinarily elevated and variable in the flowering plant 
genus Plantago (Plantaginaceae), with the fastest rates 
~4000 times faster than those reported in most other seed 
plants and an order of magnitude faster than the fastest- 
evolving animal mitochondrial genome (Cho et al. 2004). 
Enormous variation in rates of mitochondrial evolution 
has also been detected in Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) (Par- 
kinson et al. 2005), in which fast rates were detected in 
some lineages but reversed in others. Further, evolution- 
ary rates of mtDNA were decoupled from rates of plastid 
and nuclear gene evolution, both of which were essentially 
“normal” (comparable to most plants). 
Fundamental differences in molecular evolution, per- 
haps related to functional constraints, may exist between 
the plastid genome of angiosperms and the mitochondrial 
genome of some animals, such as vertebrates (Savolainen 
et al. 2002). The large datasets of plastid gene sequences 
for angiosperms have made it possible to conduct rigor- 
ous comparisons of plant and animal organellar gene 
evolution. Whereas some have suggested that functional 
requirements, including chemical properties, charge, and 
hydrophobicity, in the mtDNA genome of animals have se- 
riously compromised estimation of relationships (Naylor 
and Brown 1997), such is not the case with the plastid ge- 
nome (Savolainen et al. 2002). Thus, much of the success in 
phylogeny reconstruction at deep levels in flowering plants 
may be due to properties of the plastid genome itself. 
Large-scale analyses of angiosperm datasets have also 
prompted a reassessment of the utility of third codon posi- 
tions for phylogeny reconstruction. Rapidly evolving nucle- 
otide sites have often been considered less informative than 
those that evolve more slowly, particularly in the analysis 
of deep branches and especially in studies using animal 
mtDNA. However, several studies have shown that third 
codon positions of plastid genes possess the most phylo- 
genetic information in angiosperms (KaAllersj6 et al. 1998; 
Olmstead et al. 1998); in the animal mtDNA genes, in con- 

44 Chapter 3 
trast, third positions performed most poorly (Savolainen 
et al. 2002). Kallersj6 et al. (1998, 1999) demonstrated the 
utility of third positions on a broad scale in their analysis of 
2538 rbcL sequences across photosynthetic life. Although 
rapidly evolving and prone to homoplasy, third positions 
contained most of the phylogenetically informative sites 
and performed well. With broad sampling, homoplasy is 
dispersed across the tree, allowing the historical signal car- 
ried in third positions to emerge. 
Some life-history strategies appear to be associated with 
changes in rate of molecular evolution. Long-lived organ- 
isms (perennials) have slower rates than do annuals (see 
section “Big Trees” below; Smith and Donoghue 2008). 
Rates of molecular evolution in parasitic plants may be 
faster than those in non-parasitic lineages (e.g., Nickrent 
and Starr 1994; de Pamphilis et al. 1997; Young and de 
Pamphilis 2005). In addition, carnivorous lineages with 
morphologically complex traps have higher relative rates 
of gene substitutions than do those with simple sticky 
“fly-paper” traps (Ellison and Gotelli 2009). Miiller et al. 
(2004) reported that Genlisea and Utricularia, both with 
specialized traps, have relative rates of nucleotide substitu- 
tions in some plastid genes that are 63% higher than in the 
related Pinguicula, with sticky traps (see also Jobson and 
Albert 2002).

Unusual Features of the mtDNA Genome 
Put simply, the plant mitochondrial genome is a very “dif- 
ferent beast” from the plastid genome, and its structure 
and dynamics are very different from those of the other 
two plant genomes (Palmer 1985, 1990, 1992) and from 
the mtDNA of animals and fungi. The noteworthy features 
of the plant mitochondrial genome have been well sum- 
marized elsewhere, but two key points of caution should 
be considered when using mtDNA genes in reconstructing 
phylogeny: 1) many non-mitochondrial DNA sequences, 
both plastid and nuclear, may be present in plant mtDNA; 
and 2) the plant mitochondrial genome often houses many 
foreign copies of mitochondrial genes that were acquired 
via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from other species. Ex- 
amples of these issues are noted below. 
Amborella, the extant sister group to all other living 
angiosperms (below), has a very large, complex mitochon- 
drial genome (Rice et al. 2013), with many foreign copies 
of mitochondrial genes that were acquired via HGT from 
a diverse array of donors, including other angiosperms as 
well as mosses (Bergthorsson et al. 2003, 2004; Rice et al. 
2014). Other studies indicate that HGT events involving 
mitochondrial genes have been widespread, at least in flow- 
ering plants (Fig. 3.4) (Bergthorsson et al. 2003; Davis and

Fe cal 
Wurdack 2004). In addition, 
Won and Renner (2003) docu- 
mented HGT of mitochondrial genes from flowering plants 
to the gymnosperm Guetum. Mitochondrial genomes fre- 
quently contain integrated plastid DNA, which accounts 
for an additional 25,281 bp (4.44%) of the mitochondrial 
DNA of maize (Clifton et al. 2004). The topic of HGT is 
covered in more detail in Chapter 15. 
The plant mitochondrial genome is also dynamic at the 
gene level with gene loss common in angiosperms. Adams 
et al. (2000) also showed repeated loss and transfer of the 
mitochondrial gene rps10 to the nucleus and subsequently 
(Adams et al. 2002) demonstrated that, whereas basal lin- 
eages of angiosperms have the same set of mitochondrial 
genes as found in their algal ancestors, more derived lin- 
eages of flowering plants exhibit losses of many mitochon- 
drial genes, again apparently the result of transfer of genes 
to the nucleus. 
THE ANGIOSPERM PHYLOGENETIC 
FRAMEWORK: AN OVERVIEW 
We provide a brief overview of angiosperm relationships 
that relies primarily on the 640-taxon, 17-gene topology 
based on genes from all three plant genomes (i.e., 11 plas- 
tid genes, 4 mitochondrial genes, 2 nuclear genes) (Soltis 
et al. 2011; see Fig. 3.5). Because of its more extensive 
taxon sampling, the Soltis et al. (2011) study remains the 
most useful published analysis of angiosperm phylogeny, 
but we also highlight analyses employing entire or nearly 
entire plastid genome sequences (Jansen et al. 2007; Moore 
et al. 2007, 2010; Ruhfel et al. 2014), including a recent 
noteworthy analysis of over 1000 nearly complete plastid 
genomes for green plants (Gitzendanner et al. in prep.), 
mitochondrial gene datasets for angiosperms (Qiu et al. 
2010), and recent nuclear phylogenomic studies (Lee et al. 
2011; Zeng et al. 2014, see Fig. 3.6; Wickett et al. 2014). 
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENIES 
COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL 
CLASSIFICATIONS 
Here we also compare the current best estimate of phy- 
logeny with the major features of the most prominent 
morphology-based 
classification systems from the late 
1900s—Dahlgren 
(1980), Cronquist (1981), Takhtajan 
(1987, 1997), and Thorne (1992a,b, 2001, 2007) (see also 
Dahlgren et al. 1985; Dahlgren and Bremer 1985; Dahlgren 
1989) (Figs. 3.7, 3.8). In many ways, these four systems 
were highly similar; each recognized a basic split between 
monocotyledons and dicotyledons (recognized as separate 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview 
45 
classes; Magnoliopsida and Liliopsida of Cronquist 1981), 
except for Thorne (2007), which was influenced by molec- 
ular analyses. We now know, however, that dicots are non- 
monophyletic (see below) so that group is no longer recog- 
nized. The monocots and dicots were, in turn, divided into 
a series of subclasses or superorders. Relationships among 
these subclasses were often depicted in terms of phyloge- 
netic shrubs or “bubble” diagrams that represented each 
author’s intuition of evolutionary relationships (see also 
Stebbins 1974). The six subclasses of dicots recognized by 
Cronquist (1981) and their interrelationship are depicted 
in Figure 3.7A; ordinal interrelationships were expressed in 
a similar fashion (Fig. 3.7A and B). Numerical analyses of 
the content of orders and the overall structure of these four 
traditional classifications have indicated that they are not 
significantly different (Cuerrier et al. 1997), despite some 
noteworthy variation among them. Dahlgren et al. (1985) 
and Dahlgren and Bremer (1985), for example, represent 
the only angiosperm classifications to emphasize chemi- 
cal characters, as well as to incorporate cladistic principles 
(Fig. 3.8). 
There are both striking similarities and differences be- 
tween the long-used morphology-based classifications (e.g., 
Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1987; Thorne 1992a,b) and 
DNA-based phylogenetic hypotheses. At this point, these 
older classifications have been superseded by a series of 
classifications based on molecular phylogenies. The reclas- 
sification of angiosperms is discussed in more detail below 
in “A Reclassification Based on Sequence Data.” A useful 
source of phylogenetic trees and other information for an- 
giosperms is provided by Stevens (2001 onwards; www 
-mobot.org/MOBOT/ research/APweb/). 
Throughout this discussion, we generally refrain from 
using phrases such as “basal group” or “early-diverging 
group” because a node marks the divergence of two lin- 
eages, neither of which is basal to the other or diverges ear- 
lier than the other. It is more appropriate to refer to clades 
as sister to other clades or groups of clades. However, some 
lineages clearly diverged before others, such as the origins 
of Nymphaeaceae and Austrobaileyales before the origins 
of any of the eudicot lineages. Thus, nodes or branches can 
be “early-diverging” relative to other clades, even though 
the extant groups, which are terminals in the tree, are not. 
As reviewed below (and Chapters 4 and 7), a graded series 
of three clades (Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, Austrobai- 
leyales; the ANA grade) is sister to all other angiosperms 
(Mesangiospermae) and for convenience we will refer to 
this grade as the “basal angiosperms” or “basalmost angio- 
sperms.” Similarly, within the eudicot clade, a graded series 
of clades appears as successive sisters to the core eudicots. 
For convenience, we will sometimes refer to this grade as 
the “early-diverging” (or “basal”) eudicots.

GENERAL COMMENTS 
The overall framework of angiosperm phylogeny is now 
largely well-supported, with only a few problematic issues 
remaining at deep levels (below). Recent analyses (e.g., 
Moore et al. 2007; Jansen et al. 2007; Jian et al. 2008; 
Soltis et al. 2011) demonstrate that with enough sequence 
data (20,000 or more base pairs), most problematic, deep- 
level problems in the flowering plants could be resolved. 
Especially helpful have been analyses involving complete 
sequencing of the plastid genome (e.g., Jansen et al. 2007; 
Moore et al. 2007, 2010; Ruhfel et al. 2014), as well as

highly conserved low-copy genes have also been informa- 
tive (e.g., N. Zhang et al. 2012; Zeng et al. 2014). This 
enormous progress on the backbone does not imply that 
angiosperm phylogenetic knowledge

A diagram illustrating the circumscrip- 
tion and putative phylogenetic relationships among 
orders of monocotyledons as circumscribed by 
Dahlgren et al. (1985; Fig. 26); names and groupings 
are superimposed on the three-dimensional diagram 
of phylogenetic relationships (Dahlgren et al. 1985; 
Fig. 25). The diagram is envisioned as the transection 
of a phylogenetic shrub. The transected branches are 
positioned according to degree of similarity and have 
a size roughly approximating the number of species. 
We have combined figures from Dahlgren et al. 
(1985; Figs. 25 and 26) to make this novel figure 
depicting their view of relationships. 
Dioscoreales 
Instead, as noted below, unresolved problems with the 
backbone remain. In some cases, differences exist between 
nuclear- and plastid-based trees, and it remains unclear 
whether this is actual conflict between these different ge- 
nomic compartments. Furthermore, our understanding of 
relationships within many major subclades (recognized as 
families and orders) is often very limited, and at the ge- 

ee 
neric and species levels, the angiosperms remain poorly 
understood. 
As noted above, a conspicuous feature of DNA-based 
topologies is the absence of a major split between mono- 
cots and dicots (Figs. 3.5, 3.6; see also Figs. 3.1 and 3.2). 
Instead, essentially all trees indicate that, whereas the 
monocots (~22% of all angiosperm species) are monophy- 
letic, the dicots are not. The monocots are derived from 
within a basal grade of taxa that are all traditional dicots 
corresponding largely to Magnoliidae of Cronquist (1981) 
(Fig. 3.7). The remaining traditionally recognized dicots, 
now known as the eudicots, which include about 75% 
of angiosperm species (Drinnan et al. 1994), form a well- 
supported clade (Figs. 3.5, 3.6). 
Most combinations of plastid, nuclear (18S + 26S 
rDNA), and mtDNA genes, as well as large datasets of only 
plastid genes, recover a grade of Amborellaceae, Nympha- 
eales, and Austrobaileyales, followed by a magnoliid clade 
(Magnoliidae sensu Cantino et al. 2007) plus Chloranthales 
as subsequent sisters to two large clades: 1) Ceratophylla- 
ceae + eudicots and 2) monocots. However, several recent 
trees based on low-copy nuclear genes suggest alterna- 
tive topologies. In N. Zhang et al. (2012), Amborellaceae, 
Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales are subsequent sisters 
to a large clade comprising two major subclades: 1) eudi- 
cots and 2) monocots, magnoliids, Ceratophyllaceae, and 
Chloranthaceae. In Lee et al. (2011), the ANA grade is also 
followed by two large clades: 1) eudicots + magnoliids and 
2) monocots (Fig. 3.5). Both of these nuclear gene analyses 
suffer from limited taxon sampling in crucial areas of the 
tree (e.g., no Chloranthaceae or Ceratophyllaceae in Lee 
et al. 2011). Analyses of a large nuclear dataset (1KP data; 
1000 plant transcriptomes; www.onekp.com), but with 
limited taxon sampling, also reveals instability at this point 
in some of these same relationships (Wickett et al. 2014), 
with some analyses placing magnoliids + Chloranthaceae 
as sister to eudicots and others placing magnoliids followed 
by Chloranthaceae + eudicots. 
In a much larger sampling of angiosperm taxa (but 
many fewer genes) than analyzed by Lee et al. (2011), Zeng 
et al. (2014) used 59 carefully selected nuclear genes and 
analyzed 61 taxa (60 angiosperms plus Ginkgo as an out- 
group). With this sampling (Fig. 3.6), the nuclear frame- 
work is very similar to that obtained with datasets largely 
based on plastid genes. However, the Zeng et al. (2014) tree 
places magnoliids sister to ([{Ceratophyllaceae + Chloran- 
thaceae] + eudicots), a clade they refer to as mesodicots. 
Clearly, deeper taxon sampling is needed for the picture of 
relationships based on nuclear genes to stabilize. 
Most of the non-eudicot angiosperms are character- 
ized by uniaperturate pollen, although there is consider- 
able variation in pollen morphology among these taxa (see 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview 
49 
Sampson 2000). In contrast, the eudicots are characterized 
by triaperturate or triaperturate-derived pollen (Doyle and 
Hotton 1991), which some authors have suggested might 
have been a crucial factor for eudicot success (e.g., Furness 
and Rudall 2004). Other morphological features are shared 
by a major subset of the eudicots, called the core eudicots 
or Gunneridae sensu Cantino et al. (2007; see below) (re- 
viewed in Nandi et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 2000a; and 
Chapters 7 and 8); these features include ellagic acid (ap- 
parently replaced in the euasterids by iridoids and other 
compounds), non-laminar/marginal placentation, and dif- 
ferentiation of the calyx and corolla (Albert et al. 1998; 
Nandi et al. 1998). 
In the 17-gene summary tree (Fig. 3.5), Ceratophyllum 
is sister to the large clade of eudicots; this clade of Cera- 
tophyllum + eudicots is sister to the monocots. Those an- 
giosperms that are not part of the eudicot and monocot 
clades form a grade, not a clade, and for convenience in 
coverage we simply refer to them here as the non-eudicot 
and non-monocot angiosperms—that is, everything other 
than the monocots and eudicots. This same basic topology 
has been recovered in analyses of complete plastid genome 
sequences (Leebens-Mack et al. 2005; Jansen et al. 2007; 
Moore et al. 2007, 2010). Several noteworthy non-eudicot, 
non-monocot groups are only briefly highlighted below as 
they are discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters: 
the basalmost angiosperm lineages, the magnoliid clade, 
and Chloranthales. 
BASALMOST ANGIOSPERMS 
The basalmost angiosperms (Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, 
Austrobaileyales) typically form a grade, even in most early 
analyses (Mathews and Donoghue 1999; Parkinson et al. 
1999; Renner 1999; Qiu et al. 1999, 2000; P. Soltis et al. 
1999a; Barkman et al. 2000; Doyle and Endress 2000; Gra- 
ham and Olmstead 2000; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 
2002, 2003; Leebens-Mack et al. 2005; Jansen et al. 2007; 
Moore et al. 2007; Burleigh et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011; 
Soltis et al. 2011; Drew et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 2014). 
Generally, Amborellaceae are sister to all other angiosperms 
(see Chapter 4), followed in succession by Nymphaeales 
(the water lilies), and then Austrobaileyales (Austrobaileya- 
ceae, Trimeniaceae, and Schisandraceae, which now include 
Illiciaceae; APG IV 2016 and earlier). The grade itself was 
initially referred to as the “ANITA” grade (Qiu et al. 1999), 
named for Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, Illiciaceae, Trime- 
niaceae, and Austrobaileyaceae, but has also been referred 
to as the ANA grade, for Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, 
and Austrobaileyales (see Soltis et al. 2005b)—the latter is 
more appropriate, given the revised classification of Aus- 

50 Chapter 3 
trobaileyales. The term “basalmost angiosperms” has been 
more widely used for this grade in recent years, and we will 
follow that here (see also Chapter 4). 
Early analyses involving single genes, as well as initial 
analyses of combined datasets (Qiu et al. 1999; Bark- 
man et al. 2000; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2002, 
2003), usually recovered these basal nodes with internal 
support above 50%. As datasets increased in size (more 
taxa and particularly more data), strength for these ba- 
salmost branches increased. One debate has involved the 
relationship of Amborellaceae and Nymphaeales. In some 
early analyses, they appeared as sister taxa—that is, to- 
gether they are sister to all other angiosperms; this topol- 
ogy has also been seen in analyses with mtDNA data. We 
review this debate in more detail in Chapter 4, but stress 
that nearly all recent analyses, including large datasets of 
nuclear genes, support Amborellaceae alone as sister to all 
other angiosperms (reviewed in Drew et al. 2014; see also 
Wickett et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2014). 
MAGNOLIIDS/CHLORANTHALES 
There is generally strong support for a magnoliid clade 
(Magnoliidae sensu Cantino et al. 2007) of Magnoliales, 
Laurales, Canellales (Winterales of some recent publica- 
tions), and Piperales. Within this clade, Canellales and 
Piperales are well supported as sister taxa, as are Laurales 
and Magnoliales. Also well supported is Chloranthales, a 
clade consisting of four genera in one family (Chlorantha- 
ceae; see Chapter 5). 
In early analyses based on one or a few genes, the place- 
ments of the magnoliids and Chloranthales were unclear 
because the spine of the angiosperm tree was uncertain 
(e.g. Chaseet al, 1993; P Soltis et ale 19994; D, Soltis etal. 
2000). But with the addition of more genes, the relation- 
ships of these two lineages became better resolved and sup- 
ported (e.g., Zanis et al. 2002; Jansen et al. 2007; Moore 
et al. 2007, 2010; Soltis et al. 2007c, 2011; Burleigh et al. 
2009). In most trees based on many plastid genes, Chloran- 
thaceae are sister to magnoliids, and this clade is then sis- 
ter to the remaining angiosperms; with 17 genes and com- 
plete plastid genome sequences, these relationships receive 
strong internal support (e.g., Zanis et al. 2002; Jansen et al. 
2007; Moore et al. 2007, 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
However, recent nuclear gene trees suggest alternative 
relationships. For example, Zeng et al. (2014) place Cera- 
tophyllaceae sister to Chloranthaceae with strong support, 
with magnoliids and Ceratophyllaceae + Chloranthaceae 
sister to the eudicots (Fig. 3.7). That is, magnoliids and 
Chloranthaceae are not sisters in this analysis. It will be 
crucial to examine these relationships with nuclear gene 
datasets with larger taxon sampling. 
MONOCOTS 
(MONOCOTYLEDONEAE) 
Phylogenetic analyses of monocots (Chase et al. 2000c, 
2006; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Chase 2004; Givnish et al. 
2006, 2010; Graham et al. 2006; Janssen and Bremer 
2004; Soltis et al. 2011) have indicated some relationships 
and circumscriptions that differ substantially from most 
morphology-based ¢classification systems. The classifica- 
tion of Dahlgren et al. (1985) most closely resembles the 
topologies obtained; those of other prominent authors 
sometimes disagree substantially with molecular results 
(Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1987, 2009; Thorne 1992a,b). 
One conspicuous difference between DNA topologies and 
morphology-based classifications involves the enigmatic 
genus Acorus. Traditionally, Acorus was placed in Araceae. 
However, Acorus appears with strong support as sister to 
all other monocots, a result that was apparent with just a 
few genes (see Chapter 7). Following Acorus (Acoraceae), 
a clade of Alismatales is sister to all other monocots. The 
Alismatales corresponds largely to Aranae and Alismata- 
nae of Dahlgren et al. (1985). Following Alismatales, there 
- 
are several well-supported clades of monocots (commeli- 
nids, Asparagales, Liliales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales), the 
interrelationships of which were unresolved even in earlier 
multi-gene analysis (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000). But the ad- 
dition of more genes has resolved most deep-level monocot 
relationships, nearly all with high bootstrap support (e.g., 
Chase et al. 2006; Givnish et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011; 
see Chapter 7). 
Although Lilianae of Dahlgren et al. (1985) are para- 
phyletic in phylogenetic analyses, they include groups that 
correspond well to the clades retrieved in molecular phylo- 
genetic analyses (Dioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagales). 
The phylogenetic placements of only a few families and 
genera in recent phylogenies do not agree with the cir- 
cumscriptions of these orders by Dahlgren et al. (1985). 
For example, Iridaceae and Orchidaceae were placed in 
Liliales by Dahlgren et al. (1985), but appear in Aspar- 
agales in DNA-based trees. Although Dahlgren et al. also 
recognized the presence of a commelinid group, some of 
their ordinal circumscriptions differ from those inferred 
from molecular analyses. Within the commelinid clade of 
molecular-based trees are several well-supported subclades: 
Arecales, Zingiberales, Poales, and Commelinales. Areca- 
les and Zingiberales correspond well to the Arecanae and 
Zingiberanae of Dahlgren et al. (1985), whereas their Bro- 

oe 
melianae and Commelinanae are both polyphyletic. Chap- 
ter 7 covers the monocots in more detail. 
EUDICOTS (EUDICOTYLEDONEAE) 
The monophyly of eudicots, recognized first based on 
morphology, was apparent in molecular analyses of single 
genes, but typically without strong support (e.g., Chase 
et al. 1993; Chase and Albert 1998; D. Soltis et al. 1997b; 
Savolainen et al. 2000a,b). With only three genes, the 
monophyly of the eudicot clade was recovered with a high 
degree of confidence (100%; Fig. 3.6; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000; see also D. Soltis et al. 1998 and Hoot 
et al. 1999). Large datasets of many genes have now con- 
sistently recovered the eudicot clade with strong support 
(e.g., Jansen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2011; 
Soltis et al. 2011). 
Within the eudicots, there is a basal grade of ancient 
(based on the fossil record) lineages (Fig. 3.6): Ranun- 
culales, Proteales, Sabiaceae (now included in Proteales; 
Chapter 12), Trochodendraceae (including Tetracentron), 
and Buxaceae 
(including Didymeles) 
(see Chapter 
8). 
With the exception of Ranunculales and Proteales, most 
of these clades consist of relatively few genera and species. 
Ranunculales are well supported and sister to the remain- 
ing eudicots. The relationships among the remaining basal 
eudicots have been much more difficult to resolve and were 
unclear with three genes (Chapter 8), but large datasets of 
numerous genes have resolved most of these problematic 
relationships. Proteales (including Sabiaceae) follow Ra- 
nunculales as sisters to the remaining eudicots. In some 
analyses Proteales sensu APG III (Proteaceae, Platanaceae, 
Nelumbonaceae) and then Sabiaceae appear as subsequent 
sisters to all other angiosperms. However, recent analyses 
involving 17 genes (Soltis et al. 2011) and complete plas- 
tid genome sequences (Moore et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2013) 
recovered a weakly supported Proteales (sensu APG III) 
+ Sabiaceae clade that is sister to all remaining eudicots, 
which are strongly supported as monophyletic (see Chap- 
ter 8) (Fig. 3.6). Bootstrap support for Sabiaceae + Pro- 
teales (sensu APG III) is > 90 % in a recent analysis of 
complete plastid genome sequences (Sun et al. 2016). This 
prompted inclusion of Sabiaceae in an expanded Proteales 
(APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12). Trochodendraceae and 
Buxaceae then typically appear in recent large datasets as 
successive sister groups to a well-supported clade of core 
eudicots (Chapters 8, 9). 
Within the core eudicots (Gunneridae sensu Cantino 
et al. 2007), Gunnerales (Myrothamnaceae and Gunnera- 
ceae) are sister to the remainder of the clade (Pentapetalae 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview 
51 
sensu Cantino et al. 2007) (Fig. 3.6; see Chapter 9). With 
three, four, or five genes, relationships within the core eu- 
dicots were unclear, but with larger datasets (17 genes and 
complete plastid genomes; Soltis et al. 2011; Moore et al. 
2010), resolution and support were obtained for major 
clades. The core eudicot clade represents a rapid radiation 
(see below). Complete plastid genome sequence data indi- 
cate that soon after its origin, Pentapetalae diverged into 
two major clades: (i) a “superrosid” clade (Superrosidae 
sensu Soltis et al. 2011) consisting of rosids (Rosidae sensu 
Cantino et al. 2007) and Saxifragales; and (ii) a “super- 
asterid” clade (Superasteridae sensu Soltis et al. 2011) com- 
prising Berberidopsidales, Santalales, Caryophyllales, and 
asterids (Asteridae sensu Cantino et al. 2007). The exact 
position of Dilleniaceae remains unclear (see remaining 
deep-level problems, below). Molecular dating analyses 
suggest that the major lineages of both superrosids and su- 
perasterids arose in as few as 5 million years—clearly a 
rapid radiation (Moore et al. 2010). 
The rosid, asterid, and Caryophyllales clades identified 
with DNA sequence data correspond roughly to Rosidae, 
Asteridae, and Caryophyllidae, respectively, of traditional 
morphology-based classifications of Cronquist, Takhtajan, 
and Thorne (see above). However, the DNA-based ver- 
sions are all significantly larger than their counterparts in 
these classifications. For example, in addition to Rosidae 
of morphology-based classifications, the rosid clade also 
contains many families of Dilleniidae and Hamamelidae 
(neither group is monophyletic nor currently recognized; 
see below). A few families typically placed in Rosidae in 
morphology-based classifications actually occur outside 
of the rosid clade, such as some members of Saxifragales 
(e.g., Crassulaceae, Haloragaceae, and Saxifragaceae), as 
well as the small clades of Gunnerales and Berberidopsida- 
les. Santalales, placed in Rosidae by Cronquist and others 
(Fig. 3.7), form a distinct clade as part of the superasterids 
in DNA analyses. The asterid clade is also larger than Aste- 
ridae of morphology-based classifications due to the inclu- 
sion of several groups of Dilleniidae, such as Ericales, and 
also some Rosidae, such as Cornales and Apiales (Fig. 3.6; 
see Chapter 12). 
Caryophyllales are also an expanded version of Caryo- 
phyllidae of traditional classifications. In addition to core 
families of the old Caryophyllidae (e.g., Caryophyllaceae, 
Aizoaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Cactaceae, and close relatives, 
plus Plumbaginaceae and Polygonaceae), the DNA-based 
Caryophyllales clade also includes the carnivorous plant 
families Nepenthaceae and Droseraceae, as well as several 
other former families of Dilleniidae such as Tamaricaceae 
and Frankeniaceae. Subclasses Hamamelidae and Dilleni- 
idae of modern classifications are both grossly polyphy- 

52 Chapter 3 
letic. Families of Hamamelidae are scattered across the 
topology, with some occurring as early-diverging eudicots 
(e.g., Platanaceae and Trochodendraceae; see Chapter 8), 
another (Eucommiaceae) as part of the asterid clade (see 
Chapter 11), and several families as part of Saxifragales 
(e.g., Cercidiphyllaceae, Hamamelidaceae, and Daphni- 
phyllaceae; see Chapter 10). However, most families as- 
signed previously to Hamamelidae are found in the rosid 
clade (e.g., Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Fagaceae, Juglanda- 
ceae, Ulmaceae, and Urticaceae; see Chapter 10), but even 
these families of Hamamelidae do not form a monophyletic 
group. Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Fagaceae, and Juglanda- 
ceae are in Fagales, whereas Ulmaceae and Urticaceae are 
in Rosales. Families of Dilleniidae also appear in several 
different places in the eudicots, occurring in the asterid, ro- 
sid, and Caryophyllales clades. Paeoniaceae, treated as a 
dilleniid by Cronquist, are placed in Saxifragales. 
REMAINING DEEP-LEVEL 
PROBLEMS 
Although the framework of angiosperm phylogeny has 
largely been resolved with strong support, several problem- 
atic areas remain. We briefly mention prominent examples 
here; others are discussed in more detail in the specific 
chapters dealing with those taxa. Despite some contention 
on the placement of Amborella, large datasets with appro- 
priate taxon sampling consistently place it alone as sister to 
all other angiosperms (Chapter 4). One vexing problem is 
the position of Dilleniaceae, a family variously placed with 
the superrosids or superasterids. Complete plastid genome 
sequencing did not resolve its placement (Moore et al. 
2010). Maximum-likelihood analyses support Dilleniaceae 
as sister to superrosids, but topology tests did not reject 
alternative positions of Dilleniaceae as sister to Asteridae 
or all remaining Pentapetalae (see Moore et al. 2010; Soltis 
et al. 2011). Relationships within several major subclades 
have also been difficult to resolve, even with numerous taxa 
and genes. Prominent examples include Malpighiales and 
Lamiales, each of which is covered in more detail in Chap- 
ters 10 and 11, respectively. 
As molecular datasets continue to grow, it is also be- 
coming apparent that different genomes may tell differ- 
ent stories at deep levels, just as they do near the tips of 
the tree (e.g., Rieseberg and Soltis 1991). The COM clade 
(Celastrales, Oxalidales, and Malpighiales) is an excellent 
example of this problem. Plastid data place the COM clade 
with the fabid subclade of rosids, whereas large nuclear 
datasets, mtDNA, and morphology favor a placement with 
the malvid subclade of rosids (Sun et al. 2015; see Chap- 
ter 10). Likewise, conflict between nuclear and plastid data- 
sets is evident for Mesangiospermae (see Zeng et al. 2014), 
as noted above. 
CIRCUMSCRIPTIONS OF 
FAMILIES 
AND :ORDERS 
BASED ON MOLECULAR DATA 
DNA sequence data provide strong support for the mono- 
phyly of most flowering plant families recognized in tra- 
ditional morphology-based classifications. However, some 
long-recognized 
families 
are clearly not monophyletic 
based on broad molecular phylogenetic analyses. More fo- 
cused molecular and morphological analyses, using higher 
taxon density, often provide additional crucial informa- 
tion regarding familial composition. In a few cases, well- 
known families have been shown to be highly polyphyletic. 
Both Scrophulariaceae and Liliaceae as long recognized 
are polyphyletic, consisting of several distantly related 
lineages. In other instances, phylogenetic analyses have 
indicated broader circumscriptions of traditional fami- 
lies (e.g., Apocynaceae, Lamiaceae, and Malvaceae; Judd 
et al. 1994; Judd and Manchester 1997; Bayer et al. 1999). 
Asclepiadaceae are nested within Apocynaceae (Judd et al. 
1994). Lamiaceae are monophyletic only with the inclu- 
sion of some genera of Verbenaceae, such as Callicarpa 
_ 
and Clerodendrum (Wagstaff and Olmstead 1997). The 
distinction of Malvaceae from Bombacaceae, Tiliaceae, 
and Sterculiaceae is not supported by phylogenetic analy- 
ses (e.g., Judd and Manchester 1997; Bayer et al. 1999), 
which indicate instead that a single broadly defined fam- 
ily, Malvaceae, should be recognized. Other angiosperm 
families as traditionally recognized are also now known to 
be non-monophyletic; these include Sapindaceae, Flacour- 
tiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Ericaceae, and 
Saxifragaceae (discussed in Chase et al. 2000b; D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; see also reclassifi- 
cation of angiosperms below by the Angiosperm Phylog- 
eny Group, APG 1998 and APG II 2003; APG III 2009; 
APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12). 
Whereas many families of angiosperms have received 
strong support in DNA-based analyses, most tradition- 
ally recognized orders have not. Well-supported clades of 
families often show little agreement with orders recognized 
in morphology-based classification systems (e.g., Dahlgren 
1980; Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1987, 1997; Thorne 
1992a,b, 2001). For example, Saxifragales as delineated by 
DNA sequence analyses are a highly eclectic assemblage 
of taxa previously placed in three subclasses (sensu Cron- 
quist 1981). The Ericales clade recovered in phylogenetic 
analyses contains families that were placed in several or- 
ders of subclasses Dilleniidae and Rosidae. Rosales of mo- 

lecular analyses bear only slight similarity to Rosales of 
morphology-based classifications. In addition to Rosaceae, 
the Rosales clade also contains several families of Cron- 
quist’s (1981) Hamamelidae (e.g., Ulmaceae, Moraceae), 
as well as additional families of Rosidae (sensu Cronquist 
1981) previously placed in other orders (e.g., Elaeagnaceae 
were once placed in Proteales). However, some noteworthy 
instances in which ordinal circumscriptions in the tradi- 
tional classifications largely agree with those derived from 
DNA-based topologies include Myrtales, Sapindales, and 
Zingiberales. 
A RECLASSIFICATION BASED ON 
SEQUENCE DATA 
The high degree of resolution and internal support obtained 
for the angiosperms through molecular investigations indi- 
cated the need for a revised higher-level classification. As 
molecular phylogenetic studies continued at a rapid pace, 
different names were used by different laboratories for the 
same groups of angiosperms. The rapidly growing need 
for a standardized system of names that corresponded to 
the DNA-based clades prompted the Angiosperm Phylog- 
eny Group (APG), a group of angiosperm systematists, to 
provide a revised higher-level (family and above) system of 
classification for flowering plants (APG 1998). The enor- 
mous progress that angiosperm systematists have contin- 
ued to make since the APG (1998) classification has, as an- 
ticipated, prompted updating of that classification (APG II 
2003; APG II 2009; APG IV 2016); a recent update is 
discussed in Chapter 12. A classification based on phylo- 
genetic nomenclature treats major groups of angiosperms, 
as well as other tracheophytes (Cantino et al. 2007) (see 
Chapter 12). 
The angiosperms are the first major group of organisms 
to have been classified solely on the basis of DNA sequence 
data. As with most large molecular phylogenetic analyses, 
this classification was constructed collaboratively by many 
systematists, some of whom were molecular systematists 
and others who were classically trained. This collaborative 
approach is a major departure from both typical classifi- 
cations in which one or a few “experts” provided system- 
atic treatments of large groups such as the angiosperms. 
In contrast, higher-level classification of the angiosperms 
now involves large collaborative networks of systematists, 
and this trend (at least at higher levels) will continue. This 
approach may, in fact, serve as a useful model for inves- 
tigators of other large problematic groups of organisms. 
For example, a revised classification of the ferns has been 
developed in a manner similar to the APG format used for 
angiosperms (Smith et al. 2006). 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview 
53 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STUDY 
OF MODEL ORGANISMS 
Examples of the importance of a phylogenetic underpinning 
to diverse areas of research abound. One obvious example 
is the value of placing model organisms in the appropriate 
phylogenetic context to obtain a better understanding of 
both patterns and processes of evolution. For example, most 
model plants represent highly nested angiosperm lineages 
when viewed in the context of the angiosperm phylogenetic 
tree (Fig. 3.9). For example, Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae) is 
a derived lineage within a derived family (Brassicaceae) of 
Brassicales, and Fragaria (strawberry) represents a derived 
lineage within Rosales; both models are deeply embedded 
within the rosid clade. Similarly, Oryza and Zea (rice and 
corn) are derived members of Poaceae, a family deeply em- 
bedded within the monocot clade. 
The importance of phylogenetic inference can be seen at 
multiple scales with model systems. The fact that tomato, 
long known as Lycopersicon esculentum, is actually em- 
bedded within a well-marked subclade within Solanum 
(and therefore is now appropriately referred to as Sola- 
num lycopersicum) is a powerful statement (Spooner et al. 
1993). This phylogenetic result is important to geneticists, 
molecular biologists, and plant breeders in that it points 
to a few close relatives of Solanum lycopersicum (out of 
a genus of ~1500 species) as focal points for comparative 
research. 
A phylogenetic perspective also provides unique oppor- 
tunities for comparative genomics (e.g., D. Soltis and Soltis 
2000, 2003; Walbot 2000; Kellogg 2001; A. Hall et al. 
2002; Mitchell-Olds and Clauss 2002; Pryer et al. 2002; 
Doyle and Luckow 2003; Wojciechowski et al. 2004; Al- 
bert et al. 2005; Lavin et al. 2005; Bowman et al. 2007). 
Considering Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae), Brassicaceae are 
part of a well-supported clade, Brassicales (also referred to 
as the glucosinolate clade), that also contains Akaniaceae, 
Bataceae, Caricaceae, Limnanthaceae, Tropaeolaceae, and 
several other families. This knowledge of phylogenetic rela- 
tionships should be used in efforts to extend the knowledge 
garnered from detailed genomic and developmental analy- 
ses of Arabidopsis to close relatives in Brassicaceae, as well 
as other Brassicales (cf. A. Hall et al. 2002; Mitchell-Olds 
and Clauss 2002; Bailey et al. 2006; Schranz et al. 2006). 
Excellent opportunities for comparative genomics are 
also afforded by other families that are home to model or- 
ganisms, such as Plantaginaceae (Antirrhinum; Reeves and 
Olmstead 1998), Fabaceae (legumes; Doyle and Luckow 
2003; Cronk et al. 2006; Cannon 2008), and Poaceae (Zea, 
Oryza, Sorghum, others; Grass Phylogeny Working Group 
2001, 2012), and Rosaceae (Shulaev et al. 2008). Impor- 
tantly, the most fruitful phylogenomic comparisons will be

those made in light of the best tree, and our phylogenetic 
understanding of groups containing model organisms has 
improved dramatically over the past decade. 
The snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus, represents one of 
the best model systems for the study of floral developmen- 
tal genetics (e.g., Whibley et al. 2006); researchers can ex- 
trapolate from what is known about the genetics of floral 
development in Antirrhinum to other asterids (Donoghue 
et al. 1998; Reeves and Olmstead 1998). Although Antir- 
rhinum was long placed in Scrophulariaceae, the fam- 
ily is now known to be polyphyletic, comprising perhaps 
four distinct lineages (Olmstead and Reeves 1995; Young 
et al. 1999; Olmstead et al. 2001; Tank et al. 2006; Soltis 
et al. 2011; Chapter 11). One clade (now Orobanchaceae; 
APG II 2003; APG II 2009; APG IV 2016) contains the 
parasitic members of the family (Pedicularis, Castilleja and 
Orobanchaceae s.s.), and a second clade (now Scrophulari- 
aceae) contains Scrophularia and Verbascum (and now in- 
cludes groups such as Buddleja and Myoporum, previously 
placed in Buddlejaceae and Myoporaceae, respectively). 
A third clade (now Plantaginaceae) contains many well- 
known “scrophs,” such as the model system Antirrhinum, 
as well as Digitalis, Veronica, and genera usually placed 
in their own 
families (Plantago, 
Callitriche, and Hip- 
puris). Mimulus, another model system and another former 
“scroph,” is best placed in Phrymaceae, although bootstrap 
support for this relationship is low (Beardsley et al. 2001; 
Beardsley and Olmstead 2002; Tank et al. 2006; Schafer- 
hoff et al. 2010; Chapter 11): 
Both broad and focused phylogenetic analyses also have 
implications for the study of close relatives of crops that 
have become the focus of considerable genetic research, 
such as cotton (Gossypium), now known to be part of an 
expanded Malvaceae (see Chapter 10). The closest relatives 
of Poaceae, the grass family, have been identified (Flagel- 
lariaceae, Joinvilleaceae, and Ecdeiocoleaceae), and phylo- 
genetic relationships within Poaceae are now generally well 
resolved (Grass Phylogeny Working Group 2001, 2012; see 
Chapter 7). Numerous legumes are of economic impor- 
tance, and genome structure and evolution have been stud- 
ied intensively in several species (e.g., Cannon et al. 2006, 
2010). The closest relatives of Fabaceae have long been 
debated; however, phylogenetic analyses point to a clade 
of Quillajaceae, Polygalaceae, and Surianaceae as sister to 
Fabaceae (Soltis et al. 2011; see Chapter 10). Additional 
examples of phylogenetic studies encompassing model or- 
ganisms include Solanaceae (Schlueter et al. 2004) and As- 
teraceae (Soltis and Soltis 2003; Kane et al. 2011). 
A phylogenetic framework also is crucial for the inves- 
tigation of genome evolution across the angiosperms (e.g., 
Soltis and Soltis 2013b; see Chapters 15 and 16). The ori- 
gin and evolution of the angiosperms is one of the greatest

terrestrial radiations. Flowering plants are responsible for 
most of our food and also account for much of the land- 
based photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. Angio- 
sperms have also diversified to occupy nearly every terres- 
trial environment, and many aquatic ones. Understanding 
how angiosperms have accomplished this over such a short 
evolutionary timeframe may clarify many of the key pro- 
cesses underlying the assembly of many plant/animal as- 
sociations and entire ecosystems. As noted, the angiosperm 
nuclear genomes that were initially sequenced not only 
are highly derived lineages, but also represent just a few 
branches within the angiosperm Tree of Life and as a re- 
sult provide limited insights into features of the most recent 
common ancestor of all angiosperms. Key angiosperm in- 
novations, including the origin of the flower and fruit, pol- 
lination systems and double fertilization, vessel elements, 
diverse biochemical pathways, and many of the specific 
genes that regulate key growth and developmental pro- 
cesses, appeared first among the basal angiosperm lineages. 
A thorough understanding of processes shaping genes and 
genomic features, and of the many similarities and differ- 
ences between model monocot and eudicot plants, requires 
a perspective based on phylogeny. Such perspectives can be 
obtained only through analysis of an appropriately broad 
sampling of genomes, including lineages branching from 
the most basal node on the angiosperm tree (see Soltis et al. 
2008a,b). This background was the basis for the sequenc- 
ing of the nuclear genome of Amborella (Amborella Ge- 
nome Project 2013), which offers the unique opportunity to 
“root” the analyses of diverse angiosperm features, includ- 
ing gene families and genome structure, as well as physiol- 
ogy and morphology (Soltis et al. 2008a) (Fig. 3.10). In the 
same way, the duck-billed platypus was chosen for nuclear 
genome sequencing in mammals (Warren et al. 2008) be- 
cause it represents the same crucial phylogenetic position 
as sister to all other mammals. 
SEQUENCE VARIATION: GENERAL 
PATTERNS, RAPID RADIATIONS, 
AND DIVERSIFICATION 
The oldest angiosperm fossils date from the early Creta- 
ceous, 130-136 mya, although molecular estimates for the 
age of the clade are typically somewhat older (see Chap- 
ter 2), followed by a rise to ecological dominance in many 
habitats before the end of the Cretaceous. The origin and 
early diversification of the angiosperms (Darwin’s “abomi- 
nable mystery”) represent one of several key radiations in 
angiosperm evolution. Through contributions from paleo- 
botany, phylogenetics, classical developmental biology, and

tion of Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms. Modified from Soltis et al. 
(2008). Flowers of Amborella are shown in Fig. 4.7. 
modern developmental genetics (evo—devo), tremendous 
progress has recently been made in resolving both early and 
more recent radiations. As reviewed below (see also Soltis 
et al. 2005b, 2008b), it is clear that there was not one radi- 
ation of the angiosperms, but layer upon layer of radiation. 
A striking aspect of angiosperm phylogenies—both 
early and recent (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; D. Soltis et al. 
1997a,b, 2000, 2011; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen 
et al. 2000a,b)—is the highly uneven pattern of branch 
lengths (reviewed in Chase et al. 2000b; D. Soltis et al. 
2000; Soltis et al. 2008b, 2011). Groups that are highly 
divergent for plastid genes are typically highly divergent for 
nuclear genes, although this is not always the case, as some 
lineages have experienced an acceleration in one genome 
but not another (see below). Nonetheless, this pattern pro- 
vides the impression that both morphological and molecu- 
lar evolution sometimes experience parallel alterations of 
evolutionary rates. 
In contrast to clades exhibiting pronounced bursts of 
molecular evolution, other taxa display a marked slow- 
down in rates. Such taxa have been termed “molecular liv- 
ing fossils,” and examples have been provided in vascular 
plants (e.g., tree ferns; P. Soltis et al. 2002), basal angio- 
sperms including Winteraceae (Suh et al. 1993), and the 
early-diverging eudicots Platanus and Nelumbo (Sanderson 
and Doyle 2001). Long-lived perennials may have shorter 
branches than do closely related annuals (Smith and Dono- 
ghue 2008; see below). In addition to rate accelerations and 
decelerations, there is evidence that in some taxa, change at 
some loci is nearly clock-like or “quasi-ultrametric” (first 
noted by Albert et al. 1994). Hence, there is a mixture of 
long and short branches when one takes a global view of 
the angiosperm tree and focuses on the major groups. The 
combination of a long branch to a given clade and a star- 
burst of short branches therein, with a repeated nesting of 
this general pattern, provides evidence for several episodes 
of rapid radiation in the flowering plants. 
One major angiosperm radiation occurred soon after 
the divergence of the basalmost lineages. The root of the 
angiosperms is now clear, with the initial lineages well sup- 
ported: Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales 
(Fig. 3.6). In contrast, relationships among the lineages of 
Mesangiospermae (monocots, Chloranthaceae, magnoliids, 
Ceratophyllaceae, eudicots) have been much more difficult 
to tease apart. The Mesangiospermae appear to represent 
the “big bang” of angiosperm evolution, having diversified 
rapidly, yielding the major branches of angiosperms and 
97% of all angiosperm species within less than 5 million 
years (Moore et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2008b). Putting this in 
perspective, 5 million years represents a timeframe compa- 
rable to the rapid radiation of the Hawaiian silversword al- 
liance (Asteraceae—Madiinae), which putatively arose from 
a North American ancestor 5 mya (Baldwin and Sanderson 
1998; Barrier et al. 1999). The fact that the first branches 
of the angiosperm topology (Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, 
Austrobaileyales) are well supported and not species-rich | 
and are followed by several species-rich clades indicates 
that the initial explosive radiation of the angiosperms did 
not coincide directly with the origin of flowering plants, 
but likely occurred later (cf. Mathews and Donoghue 1999; 
P. Soltis et al. 1999a, 2000). 
Subsequent radiations within the clades of Mesangio- 
spermae include, for example, the monocots, which also 
exemplify a mixture of long and short branches and ap- 
pear to represent another rapid radiation (see Chapter 7). 
This same basic pattern is repeated in the eudicots, indicat- 
ing another major deep-level radiation of flowering plants 
(Fig. 3.6). The grade of early-diverging eudicots,- with 
some relationships still unresolved, is followed by the well- 
supported core eudicots, which include most (~70%) of 
the angiosperms. The core eudicot clade consists of several 
well-supported major lineages, including the rosids, aster- 
ids, Santalales, Caryophyllales, and Saxifragales. Although 
the monophyly of each subclade of core eudicots is strongly 
supported, relationships among these lineages were poorly 
resolved and weakly supported until recently (Moore et al. 
2007, 2010; Lee et al. 2011; Soltis et al. 2011). This hy- 
pothesized radiation is in general agreement with the fossil 
record: the oldest eudicot fossils represent basal lineages 
(Platanaceae and Buxaceae). The fossil record also suggests 
an uneven distribution of species diversity across the ma- 
jor clades of eudicots (Davies et al. 2004), with the most 

species-rich groups known only from relatively young fos- 
sils, suggesting that a large proportion of eudicot diversity 
is the result of recent radiations (Magallon et al. 1999). 
Simple inspection of phylogenetic trees reveals that this 
trend is common within major eudicot clades (P. Soltis et al. 
1999a, 2000, 2005b; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011). For exam- 
ple, the Saxifragales and rosid clades also diversified over 
narrow time spans of several million years (Jian et al. 2008; 
H. Wang et al. 2009). The rapid diversification within the 
rosids (originated 110 [+6] to 93 [+ 6] Ma, followed by 
rapid diversification into the malvid and fabid subclades 
around 108 [+6] to 91[+6] Ma and 107 [+6] to 83 [+ 7] 
Ma, respectively) (H. Wang et al. 2009) may be of particu- 
lar importance in that the inferred bursts of diversification 
correspond in timing with the rapid rise of angiosperm- 
dominated forests, as suggested by the fossil record (Crane 
1987; Upchurch and Wolfe 1993; see Chapter 10). The 
rosid diversification also corresponds to the diversification 
of several other lineages that apparently evolved in par- 
allel with the diversification of angiosperm forests (Chap- 
ter 10). Woody species in clades other than the rosids (e.g., 
Cornales, Bremer et al. 2004; J. Xiang pers. comm.; Saxi- 
fragales (e.g., Altingiaceae), Jian et al. 2008) seem to have 
diversified during the same window in time, probably in- 
dicative of the rapid rise of angiosperm-dominated forests 
on a worldwide basis. 
The mixture of long and short branches noted for both 
basal angiosperms and eudicots continues for those clades 
Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview

typically recognized at the level of orders and families 
(Chase et al. 2000b; D. Soltis et al. 2000). For example, 
Malpighiales remain “one of the most recalcitrant clades 
in the angiosperm tree of life” (Wurdack and Davis 2009; 
p. 1551). It was early noted that the branch to Malpighiales 
is long, and within this clade there are also well-supported 
lineages (most recognized as families), but relationships 
among these lineages and within this clade have been ex- 
tremely difficult to resolve. In early studies, the topology 
for the clade (when considering clades with support > 50%) 
was essentially a huge polytomy (D. Soltis et al. 2000). The 
same pattern can also be seen in Lamiales (Tank et al. 2006; 
Schaferhoff et al. 2010), Ericales (Schonenberger et al. 2005; 
Soltis et al. 2011), and Saxifragales (Jian et al. 2008) and 
is also observed within some large clades corresponding 
to families: Asteraceae (Jansen and Kim 1996; Panero and 
Funk 2002; Funk et al. 2009a,b), Orchidaceae (Cameron 
et al. 1999), Crassulaceae (Mort et al. 2000), Rhamnaceae 
(Richardson et al. 2000), and Fabaceae (Lavin et al. 2005). 
Diversification in the angiosperms has been revisited 
in a rigorous statistical framework with bigger and bigger 
trees. Smith et al. (2011) used a large phylogenetic tree of 
over 50,000 terminals to examine shifts in diversification, 
and the results complement those noted above. Many ma- 
jor named clades are associated with shifts or bursts in di-

Rate shifts in diversification. The trees represent the phylogenetic relationships among the eight clades that were analyzed using large-scale phylo- 
genetic approaches (Smith et al. 2011). Results of analyses of a backbone or summary tree approach are not shown. Black bars denote the locations of rate shifts 
in diversification. Note that shifts are not associated with the origin of flowering plants or the origin of several highly diverse, named groups nested within them. 
Instead, significant rate shifts are usually nested somewhat within each named group. (From Smith et al. 2011.) 

58 Chapter 3 
summarize, “this may support a generality about angio- 
sperm evolution: major shifts in diversification may not 
be directly associated with major named clades, but rather 
with clades that are nested not far within these groups” 
(p. 404). A similar hypothesis has been posed for bursts of 
diversification following polyploidy—there often seems to 
be a lag between the genome doubling event and the actual 
increase in species diversification (see Chapter 16). Alterna- 
tively, there has been an increase in extinction rates in the 
early-diverging lineages within these major clades. Using 
the Soltis et al. (2011) framework and then building a larger 
tree, Tank et al. (2015) found evidence for repeated nested 
shifts of diversification in angiosperms, in agreement with 
inferences of nested radiations based on visual inspection. 
The general phylogenetic pattern that occurs repeatedly in 
the flowering plants is suggestive of episodic radiations (re- 
sulting in short branches) that produce lineages that exist 
for long periods (creating the long branches), followed by 
another phyletic burst, and so on. A key innovation in a 
nested subclade may be most likely to spur on another ra- 
diation, and so on. Based on Tank et al. (2015), polyploidy 
may be one such key innovation. 
But how do these nested rapid radiations in angio- 
sperms compare to what is observed in other major clades? 
Do other major clades of terrestrial life show evidence of a 
similar “big bang” of major lineages (Mesangiospermae)? 
If so, when did they occur relative to those in angiosperms? 
Also, do these occur in a similar short time frame of a few 
million years? It appears that some lineages have tracked 
the angiosperm diversification events—or diversified “in 
the shadow of the angiosperms” (see Schneider et al. 2004). 
In fact, the timing of the inferred rapid radiation of the 
large rosid clade and the rise of angiosperm-dominated 
forests [108 to 91 million years ago (mya)] corresponds to 
the concomitant diversification of other clades that inhabit 
these forests, including amphibians, ants, placental mam- 
mals, and ferns (reviewed in H. Wang et al. 2009; see also 
Chapter 10). 
Mammals may have similarly had bursts and slow- 
downs in diversification. Fossil evidence has suggested an 
explosive Tertiary radiation of placental mammals (Archi- 
bald and Deutschuman 2001; Bininda-Emonds et al. 2007; 
Bloch et al. 2007; Wible et al. 2007; Meredith et al. 2011). 
Several broad DNA-based phylogenetic analyses of mam- 
mals have been conducted, one using a supertree approach 
(Bininda-Emonds et al. 2007) and a more recent study using 
a supermatrix approach (Meredith et al. 2011). These two 
analyses have some similar conclusions, as well as striking 
differences. The Meredith et al. (2011) analysis agrees with 
the “long-fuse model” for the diversification of mammals, 
in which interordinal diversification occurred during the 
Cretaceous, with subsequent diversification within orders 
occurring in the Cenozoic (last 65 myr). In this scenario, 
many mammal lineages appear to have diversified follow- 
ing the major diversifications reviewed above for the an- 
giosperms. In addition, within some subclades of placental 
mammals, the data also suggest that rapid radiations oc- 
curred in a similar, short window (~5 myr) to several ma- 
jor radiations in angiosperms (e.g., Klaus and Miyamoto 
1991; Allard et al. 1992; Meredith et al. 2011). 
Phylogenetic analyses of birds also indicate rapid radia- 
tion, but with some debate on the timing of these events. 
Although birds originated perhaps 160 mya, based on the 
fossil record, the clade showed a strong increase in diversi- 
fication starting only 50 million years ago and continuing 
to about 5 million years ago (Hackett et al. 2008; Jetz et al. 
2012; Jarvis et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014). This overall 
increase in diversification is more recent than most major 
angiosperm radiations, but as in angiosperms, radiations 
in birds are also the result of a number of significant rate 
increases within multiple lineages (e.g., within songbirds, 
waterfowl, gulls, and woodpeckers). Mayr (2013) sug- 
gested that, while there is debate, crown group passerine 
birds (songbirds) may not have diverged until the Ceno- 
zoic. The fossil record provides evidence for an early Ter- 
tiary (~65 mya) explosion of modern bird orders that may 
have occurred over a timeframe of just 5-10 myr (Feduccia 
2003). This “big bang for birds” is more recent than that 
of angiosperms, but is comparable in terms of duration (a 
few million years) to that for the major deep radiations 
estimated for angiosperms (e.g., the diversification of Me- 
sangiospermae and rosids). 
In contrast to reports for mammals and birds, molecular 
and fossil data have generally been in close agreement for 
both the origin and early diversification of flowering plants 
(Chapter 2), although molecular dates for the origin of the 
angiosperms are generally older than the oldest fossils. Fur- 
thermore, the speed (often ~5 myr) and magnitude (ulti- 
mately ~ 350,000-400,000 extant species) of the explosive 
major radiations of flowering plants may be unique. 
The data for angiosperms may be similar to many other 
groups of eukaryotes, but seem to contrast with the red al- 
gae (Freshwater et al. 1994), in which the pattern of change 
in rbcL across all branches gives the appearance of slow 
and clock-like lineage production without the periodic 
“starbursts” present in the angiosperm tree—or visible in 
trees for other organisms. However, phylogenetic analyses 
based on 18S rDNA sequence data suggest more of a mix 
of long branches subtending clades, with subsequent short 
branches within those clades (Ragan et al. 1994), although 
18S rDNA sequences are highly divergent in red algae; Ra- 
gan et al. (1994, p. 7278) reported that “Rhodophyta are 
more divergent among themselves than are fungi, green al- 
gae and green plants considered together.” 

BIG TREES 
Only a decade ago, phylogenetic trees of a few hundred 
taxa were considered large. However, with current next- 
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and analytical 
capabilities, phylogenetic trees based on hundreds of genes 
and thousands of species are readily feasible. The work- 
horse of plant systematics has long been the plastid ge- 
nome, and following the advent of 454 (Moore et al. 2006) 
and Illumina (Cronn et al. 2008; Parks et al. 2009) tech- 
nologies, sequencing complete plastid genomes has become 
commonplace. With various means of enriching for plastid 
genes, sequencing entire genomes at a low price is now pos- 
sible, even from samples with limited DNA or from her- 
barium specimens (Stull et al. 2013). The number of taxa in 
complete plastid genome sets has grown dramatically as a 
result of the application of NGS approaches. For example,

Angiosperm Phylogeny: An Overview

only a few years ago, Moore et al. (2010) analyzed com- 
plete plastid genomes for 86 seed plants; recently, Ruhfel 
et al. (2014) examined 360 complete plastid genomes for 
green plants, and a dataset of over 1000 nearly complete 
plastomes is being assembled and analyzed as of this writ- 
ing as a result of 1kp data (see below). 
As the pace of sequencing continues to increase via tech- 
nological advances, investigators are not only adding more 
and more genes to clarify relationships in problematic parts 
of the tree, but also obtaining data for numerous taxa in a 
short period of time, accelerating efforts to build trees for 
thousands of species. A series of recent studies has demon- 
strated the value of such enormous trees. Trees with thou- 
sands of terminals have now been constructed with diverse 
foci, not just resolving relationships per se. Big trees have 
been used to conduct analyses of molecular evolution in 
relationship to angiosperm life history (Smith and Dono- 
ghue 2008), patterns of biodiversity and conservation (For-

2008; Thuiller et al. 2011), rates of diversification (Smith 
et al. 2011), and analyses of character evolution on a very 
large scale (Edwards and Smith 2010; Soltis et al. 2013). 
We review a few examples here briefly to illustrate the util- 
ity of such trees. 
Using large trees, Smith and Donoghue (2008) further 
substantiated the association between life history and rates 
of molecular evolution (see Gaut et al. 1992). Large phy- 
logenies for five major angiosperm clades, each with woody 
and herbaceous members (see Fig. 3.12), clearly demon- 
strated that rates of molecular evolution are consistently 
low in trees and shrubs (with relatively long generation 
times), compared to the rates found in related herbaceous 
plants from the same major clades (generally with shorter 
generation times). 
An exciting recent use of big trees is in the study of phy- 
logenetic diversity (PD) and conservation. PD is a biodi- 
versity index that considers the length of the evolutionary 
branches on a tree that connect a given set of species. Forest

A phylogenetic tree of 429 angiosperm species from the Concord flora showing changes in plant abundance from 1900 to 2007. Change in 
abundance ranges from —5 to +4 and was calculated as the difference in abundance for each taxon in 1900 and 2007 based on 7 abundance categories (0 to 6). 
Branch color indicates parsimony character-state reconstruction of change in abundance: red (major decline, —5 to -3), pink (moderate decline, —2), gray (little to no 
change, —1 to +1), and blue (increase, +2 to +4). Average decline in abundance was calculated for all internal nodes as the mean change in abundance of descen- 
dant nodes weighted with branch length information ascertained from divergence time estimates. An average decline of 2.5 or greater corresponds to a decline in 
abundance of 50% or greater, based on conservative scoring using 6 abundance categories (0 to 5). Clades exhibiting these major declines are indicated with black 
dots. Each of the most inclusive clades exhibiting these declines is indicated in pink and referenced numerically to their clade name. Subclades in major decline that 
are nested within more widely recognized clades are labeled with the more familiar name followed by pro parte (p.p.). These clades include diverse New England 
wildflower species, including members of the following clades: Ranunculaceae, various Asterales, Rubiaceae, Lentibulariaceae, Cornaceae, Liliales, Orobanchaceae 
Lamiaceae, Orchidaceae, Rosaceae, Saxifragales), and Ericales. (Figure taken from Willis et al. 2008: legend modified from Willis et al. 2008.)

ter rainfall, has approximately twice the number of plant 
species compared to the eastern region (with year-round 
rainfall). Forest et al. (2007) found a marked east-west 
regional difference in the distribution of PD that roughly 
corresponds to climatic zones, with PD being higher in the 
eastern region than in the western area. Hence, species rich-

ness was decoupled from PD. That is, the region with higher 
species richness had lower PD, with major implications for 
conservation efforts and clearly revealing the value of con- 
structing large trees for a geographic area rather than a 
specific clade.

flora for that area span the past 150 years with valuable 
information on changes in species abundance and flower- 
ing time. Willis et al. (2008) analyzed these data in a phy- 
logenetic context and noted that change in abundance over 
that time period is strongly correlated with flowering-time 
response. Species that do not respond to temperature have 
greatly decreased in abundance; these include members 
of Ranunculaceae (anemones and buttercups), Cornaceae 
(dogwoods), Lamiaceae (mints), Saxifragaceae, and some 
Liliales. Because flowering-time response traits are shared 
among closely related species, this study suggests that “cli- 
mate change has affected and will likely continue to shape 
the phylogenetically biased pattern of species loss in Tho- 
reau’s woods” (Willis et al. 2008, p. 17029). The use of 
large phylogenetic trees to examine patterns of climate 
change in a phylogenetic as well as an ecological context 
continues to be an exciting area of research (e.g., Edwards 
et al. 2007; Thuiller et al. 2011; Beaulieu et al. 2012). 
Edwards and Smith (2010) used a large phylogenetic 
tree in a study of the evolution of C,/C, grasses relative 
to habitat features (Fig. 3.14). As background, C, grasses 
dominate tropical and subtropical grasslands and savan- 
nas, whereas C, grasses typify cooler temperate grassland 
regions. The evolution of the C, pathway has long been 
thought to have enabled C, grasses to persist in warmer 
environments. Edwards and Smith (2010) tested this hy- 
pothesis using a 1,230-taxon tree of grasses with accom- 
panying climate data and found that grasses are ances- 
trally a warm-adapted clade and that C, evolution was 
not correlated with shifts between temperate and tropical 
biomes. This result can be seen by comparing the ancestral- 
state reconstructions of C, and mean annual temperature 
(Fig. 3.14); 18 of 20 inferred C, origins were correlated 
with marked reductions, rather than increases, in mean an- 
nual precipitation. 
These examples illustrate well the rapid changes that 
are occurring in plant systematics. Because phylogenetic 
trees have become foundational in studies of ecology and 
climate change, increasing efforts are focusing on building 
large phylogenetic trees for all of the plants of large geo- 
graphical regions, a marked departure from the traditional 
systematics goal of generating a tree for a specific clade. 
These advances set the stage for rapid progress in filling 
in major gaps in the green plant branch of the tree of life, 
as well as the entire tree of all life. The Open Tree of Life 
(http://opentreeoflife.org/) initiative seeks to provide an ini- 
tial first-pass tree of life, as well as the infrastructure and 
computational tools to facilitate updating and annotating 
the tree. In addition, efforts will be made to engage the sys- 
tematics community on a broad scale, given that the long- 
term success of the project hinges on community buy-in 
and involvement, which require and lead to the deposition 
of data and alignments. At this point, the botanical com- 
munity, as well as systematists in general, have done a very 
poor job of submitting DNA alignments and trees to public 
repositories such as Dryad—this should not be confused 
with submitting the gene sequence data to GenBank, which 
is often mandatory. However, only about 17% of trees and 
alignments generated by systematists are actually retriev- 
able; that is, over 80% of our underlying datasets and trees 
are essentially lost (Drew et al. 2013). 
In summary, this is an exciting time in systematics. 
The systematics community is now in position to take a 
true “moon shot,” that is, using cutting-edge tools to as- 
semble and analyze enormous datasets of all the named 
~500,000 species or more of green plants. In fact, the first 
draft of the Tree of Life (http://tree.opentreeoflife.org) rep- 
resents an important milestone—a starting point for biodi- 
versity science comparable to the first draft of the human 
genome sequence. This enterprise will not only facilitate a 
better understanding of the diversification of green plants, 
but will also permit the building of a cyberinfrastructure 
toolkit to navigate and employ big trees. 

The ANA Grade 
INTRODUCTION 
A longstanding goai has been to determine which extant 
taxa are sister to all other taxa in the angiosperm tree of 
life and concomitantly to use that information to infer an- 
cestral morphological, chemical, pollination (and now ge- 
nomic) attributes of the earliest angiosperms. Before mod- 
ern phylogenetics, prominent authors (e.g., Takhtajan, and 
Cronquist) frequently wrote in terms of the “most primitive 
living angiosperms.” We avoid such terminology today be- 
cause, as we note throughout, taxa attached to basal nodes 
may exhibit an array of both ancestral (“primitive”) as well 
as derived (“advanced”) traits. 
Because studies using combined datasets of multiple 
genes have indicated that the basalmost angiosperms form 
a grade rather than a clade (reviewed below), no formal 
name should be applied to these taxa. For convenience, 
we refer to these early-branching lineages (Amborellaceae, 
Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales) as the “basalmost” or 
“basal angiosperms,” or simply as the ANA grade (Am- 
borellaceae, Nymphaeales, Austrobaileyales) (Soltis et al. 
2005b; or ANITA; Qiu et al. 1999, in which Austrobailey- 
ales was replaced by its component families, Illiciaceae [now 
Schisandraceae], Trimeniaceae, and Austrobaileyaceae). 
Much of the interest in determining the basalmost 
branches of angiosperms has involved attempts to use that 
information on branching order to reconstruct the hypo- 
thetical ancestral angiosperm. We do not mean to imply, 
however, that these (or any) extant species are at the base 
of the angiosperm tree (i.e., that others were derived from 
them). There has been enormous interest however in ex- 
amining key angiosperm attributes, such as the origin and 
diversification of the flower, in light of these basal lineages. 
Studies of floral diversity in basal angiosperms have, in 
turn, influenced a broad range of disciplines, including 
plant systematics, ecology, pollination biology, and devel- 
opmental biology. 
Most morphology-based classifications of the twenti- 
eth century (e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 
1997; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001) placed most of the taxa now 
recognized as basal (based on phylogenetic analyses of mo- 
lecular data), in what was termed subclass Magnoliidae 
(not to be confused with the clade now recognized as Mag- 
noliidae, Cantino et al. 2007; Chapter 3). This Magnoliidae 
of traditional classifications also contained Ranunculales, 
now recognized to be basal eudicots (Chapter 8). Endress 
(1986b) proposed three potential groups of basalmost an- 
giosperms: (1) Degeneriaceae, Himantandraceae, Eupoma- 
tiaceae, Austrobaileyaceae; (2) Chloranthaceae, Trimenia- 
ceae, Amborellaceae; (3) Winteraceae. 
The basalmost angiosperm lineages are now clear, based 
on numerous molecular studies, with support from molecu- 
lar + morphological analyses: the ANA grade. Our over- 
view is historical, beginning with morphological cladistic 
analyses, followed by early use of DNA data, then larger 
and larger DNA datasets, and DNA + morphology. 
EARLY ANALYSES OF MORPHOLOGY 
In early phylogenetic analyses of morphology, angiosperms 
were scored as a single entity rather than as several exem- 
plars (Chapters 1, 3). Doyle and Donoghue (1986, 1992) 
scored angiosperms as a composite of Magnoliales and 

64 Chapter 4 
Winteraceae, both of which were considered “primitive” 
at that time. Donoghue and Doyle (1989b) considered a 
composite Magnoliales clade (scored on the basis of sev- 
eral families, including Degeneriaceae, Magnoliaceae, My- 
risticaceae, Eupomatiaceae, and Annonaceae). To correct 
this shortcoming, Doyle et al. (1994) and Doyle (1996) 
included several angiosperms considered “primitive” (e.g., 
Nymphaeales, Piperaceae, Saururaceae, Aristolochiaceae, 
Winteraceae, Magnoliales, Calycanthaceae, Chlorantha- 
ceae, and Laurales). Although these were improvements, 
the small number of families involved in early analyses 
illustrates one limitation of these morphological cladistic 
studies—not all potentially basal angiosperm families were 
sampled. In contrast, in many molecular phylogenetic stud- 
ies (see below), angiosperms were broadly sampled, and as 
a result, representatives of all or most basal families were 
included; for the larger families, several genera were often 
included. Another limitation of these early morphological 
analyses is that many families that we now consider criti- 
cal, such as Amborellaceae and Schisandraceae (including 
Illiciaceae; APG III 2009 and APG IV 2016; covered later 
in this chapter), either were not included or were included 
in orders with taxa to which they are now known not to be 
closely related. 
With these caveats, early studies using morphology 
recovered an array of putatively basalmost extant angio- 
sperms. Donoghue and Doyle (1989b) placed a compos- 
ite Magnoliales clade as sister to all other angiosperms 
(Fig. 3.1). This result was consistent with views at that 
time regarding the most primitive angiosperms based on 
evolutionary taxonomy, represented as “bubble diagrams” 
(Fig. 3.7) (e.g., Cronquist 1968, 1981; Takhtajan 1969, 
1991). Magnoliales of Donoghue and Doyle (1989b) were 
followed by two other clades of woody magnoliids: a com- 
posite Laurales that also included Chloranthaceae and a 
winteroid group (Illiciaceae/Schisandraceae, Winteraceae). 
However, the taxonomic makeup of these “composite” 
clades does not agree with modern DNA-based circum- 
scriptions (Chapters 3 and 5). The remaining major clades 
of angiosperms identified in Donoghue and Doyle (1989a,b) 
were “dicots” with triaperturate pollen (now eudicots; la- 
beled as such in Figure 3.1; Doyle and Hotton 1991) and 
a “paleoherb” group (now known to be polyphyletic) con- 
sisting largely of herbaceous magnoliids (Aristolochiaceae, 
Lactoridaceae), Nymphaeaceae, and monocots. Donoghue 
and Doyle (1989a) stressed that their results were not ro- 
bust; in trees one step longer, paleoherbs were sister to all 
other angiosperms. 
Other early phylogenetic analyses of morphology (Lo- 
conte and Stevenson 1991; Loconte 1996) placed Calycan- 
thaceae as sister to all remaining angiosperms, followed by 
a grade of Magnoliales, Laurales, and Illiciaceae + Schisan- 
draceae. Most of these lineages are now in the DNA- 
based Magnoliidae (Cantino et al. 2007); only Illiciaceae 
+ Schisandraceae represent a basalmost lineage. Taylor and 
Hickey (1990, 1992, 1996a,b) recovered Chloranthaceae, 
an herbaceous family, as sister to all other extant angio- 
sperms. As a result, attention was focused on herbaceous 
taxa as possible basalmost angiosperms. Not only are her- 
baceous taxa found early in the fossil record (Taylor 1990; 
Taylor and Hickey 1992), but these morphological analyses 
(e.g., Taylor and Hickey 1992) also placed Chloranthaceae, 
followed by Piperaceae (another herbaceous lineage), as 
sister to all other angiosperms (Hickey and Taylor 1996). 
Doyle et al. (1994) analyzed morphological data (and 
also combined rRNA sequence data plus morphology; see 
below). Analyses of morphological data alone again in- 
dicated that herbaceous taxa were early-diverging, with 
monocots + Nymphaeaceae sister to all other flowering 
plants, followed by Piperaceae + Saururaceae and then 
Aristolochiaceae as subsequent sisters to the remaining an- 
giosperms. However, in trees just one step longer, a very dif- 
ferent topology was recovered, with Magnoliales sister to 
all other taxa, followed by Laurales, then Calycanthaceae 
(all woody magnoliids; Chapter 5). 
Nixon et al. (1994) also provided evidence that herba- 
ceous lineages might be basalmost. Their cladistic analyses 
of morphological data included extant and fossil seed plants. 
When fossils were included, a large polytomy was obtained. 
_ 
When fossils were excluded, Chloranthus (Chloranthaceae) 
appeared as sister to the remaining angiosperms, followed 
by the herbaceous lineage, Ceratophyllum. 
Nandi et al. (1998) conducted a large morphological 
cladistic analysis of 162 living angiosperms—and com- 
bined these data with rbcL sequences (below). This study 
remains the most comprehensive morphological cladistic 
analysis for angiosperms. Their topology shows strong 
similarities to DNA-based trees. With morphology alone, 
Nandi et al. (1998) recovered Ceratophyllaceae, followed 
by Chloranthaceae, Amborellaceae, Winterales, and Aus- 
trobaileyales + Illiciales as subsequent sisters to all other 
living angiosperms. Thus, there is strong signal in morphol- 
ogy alone for the basal (or nearly so) placement of Ambo- 
rellaceae and Austrobaileyales. 
EARLY DNA ANALYSES 
In contrast to morphology-based analyses, DNA-based 
studies were much more comprehensive in coverage, often 
including all families placed in Cronquist’s Magnoliidae 
and multiple exemplars of families. Individual analyses of 
the plastid genes rbcL and atpB and nuclear 18S rDNA 
(e.g., Hamby and Zimmer 1992; Chase et al. 1993; Qiu 

a 
et al. 1993; Soltis et al. 1997b; Savolainen et al. 2000a) all 
agreed in recognizing the same suite of basal angiosperms 
as either a clade (rbcL) or a grade (atpB; 18S rDNA). 
The rbcL studies of Chase et al. (1993) and Qiu et al. 
(1993) placed Ceratophyllum (Chapter 8).as sister to all 
other extant flowering plants and indicated that all other 
angiosperms sometimes regarded as “basal” or “primitive” 
formed a clade sister to the eudicots. Amborella and water 
lilies (Nymphaeaceae) were part of a clade referred to as 
“paleoherb 1” (although Amborella is woody; Figs. 4.7 and 
6.1). 18S rDNA showed that basal angiosperms formed a 
grade rather than a clade and was the first gene to place Am- 
borella near the base of the angiosperm phylogeny (Soltis 
et al. 1997b). That study revealed a clade of Austrobailey- 
ales (Chapter 3), followed by Amborella as successive sister 
taxa to all other angiosperms. However, internal support 
was low in 18S and rbcL trees. AtpB sequences (Savolainen 
et al. 2000a) provided results similar to 18S rDNA, indicat- 
ing that basal angiosperms formed a grade, with Amborel- 
laceae, followed by Nymphaeaceae, and then Austrobai- 
leyales as successive sisters to all other angiosperms. With 
atpB, Ceratophyllum plus the monocot Acorus were sister 
to all other monocots. 
Using only 1000 bp of matK sequence data, Hilu et al. 
(2003) reconstructed a phylogenetic tree for angiosperms 
similar to that obtained using rbcL, atpB, and 18S rDNA 
(P. Soltis et al. 1999a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000). matK placed 
Amborellaceae, followed by Nymphaeaceae and Austrobai- 
leyales, as successive sisters to all other angiosperms with 
moderate bootstrap support. Similarly, phylogenetic analy- 
sis of trnL-F, a plastid intron and spacer region, yielded 
Amborella, followed by Nymphaeaceae and then Austro- 
baileyales, as subsequent sisters to all other angiosperms 
(Borsch et al. 2003). 
COMBINED DNA DATASETS 
Single-gene studies were rapidly superseded by combined 
datasets; the sequence of nodes at the base of extant an- 
giosperms is now known with high confidence (Fig. 4.1; 
see Chapter 3): Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, Austrobai- 
leyales. This is remarkable in that some investigators had 
suggested that elucidating the root of extant angiosperms 
might not be possible because of rapid radiation and ex- 
tinction. Several groups of investigators independently 
and simultaneously arrived at the same conclusion regard- 
ing these nodes using different datasets and approaches 
(Mathews and Donoghue 1999; Parkinson et al. 1999; Qiu 
et al. 1999; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Gra- 
ham and Olmstead 2000; Graham et al. 2000). Mathews 
and Donoghue (1999, 2000) identified these same basal

nodes by analyzing duplicated phytochrome genes using 
a reciprocal rooting strategy. Simultaneous analysis of se- 
quences from a gene pair that results from a duplication 
event in the lineage leading to extant angiosperms should 
yield two identical or similar gene trees; the angiosperm to- 
pology could therefore be rooted without outgroups on the 
branch connecting the duplicated genes. In addition to the 
many studies reviewed above, the placement of Amborella 
alone as sister to all other flowering plants is supported by 
analyses of structural features of B-class genes (Kim et al. 
2004a). 
The high level of sequence divergence between angio- 
sperms and their gymnosperm outgroups also raised the 
question of whether the rooting with Amborella sister to 
other extant angiosperms was affected by long-branch at- 
traction. Qiu et al. (2001) addressed this question using 
several types of artificial (random and nonrandom) se- 
quences, as well as sequences of a lycopod and a bryophyte 
as outgroups. They concluded that the Amborella rooting 
was based on historical signal rather than an artifact of 
long branches. 
Datasets have become increasingly larger in terms of 

66 Chapter 4 
the numbers of genes sequenced and taxa included. In the 
span of just a few years, the number of genes combined 
and brought to bear on the question of basal angiosperm 
relationships (often as part of broader surveys—Chapter 3) 
quickly increased from two (e.g., Mathews and Donoghue 
1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a), three (P. Soltis et al. 1999a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000), 11 (Zanis et al. 2002), 17 (Graham 
and Olmstead 2000; Graham et al. 2000; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Fig. 3.6), to surveys of complete plastid genomes (e.g., Jan- 
sen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2007, 2010; Drew et al. 2014; 
Ruhfel et al. 2014) to datasets of numerous nuclear genes 
(Lee et al. 2011; N. Zhang et al. 2012; Wickett et al. 2014; 
Zeng et al. 2014). 
There are important differences among these studies in 
the genes used, as well as in taxon sampling and methods of 
phylogenetic analysis. Genes representing the nuclear, mito- 
chondrial, and plastid genomes were sometimes combined, 
whereas in other cases, the genomic compartments were 
kept separate. In some cases, few taxa were used, whereas 
other studies sampled all families of basal angiosperms and 
many representatives of larger families. Diverse phylogenetic 
approaches have also been used. In addition to parsimony 
(used in early studies), investigators have applied maximum 
likelihood (e.g., Parkinson et al. 1999; Barkman et al. 2000; 
Qiu et al. 2000; P. Soltis et al. 2000; Stefanovié et al. 2004; 
Zanis et al. 2002, 2003; Leebens-Mack et al. 2005; Lee 
et al. 2011; Soltis et al. 2011; N. Zhang et al. 2012; Ruh- 
fel et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2014) and 
Bayesian methods (Zanis et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2007c; 
Wickett et al. 2014). 
Nearly all large-scale molecular studies (Qiu et al. 1993, 
1999, 2005; Parkinson et al. 1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a; 
P. Soltis et al. 1999; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2007c, 2011; Zanis 
et al. 2002; Borsch et al. 2003; Hilu et al. 2003; Leebens- 
Mack et al. 2005; Jansen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2007, 
2011; Lee et al. 2011; N. Zhang et al. 2012) from the past 
20 years, including recent studies involving dense sampling 
of genes and taxa (e.g., Ruhfel et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 
2014; Zeng et al. 2014) have reached the same conclusion, 
that Amborella alone is sister to all other angiosperms. This 
result is bolstered by analyses of complete plastid genomes 
(Ruhfel et al. 2014) and large datasets of nuclear genes 
(Wickett et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2014). 
However, internal support for this placement of Ambo- 
rella varies considerably among studies. With three genes, 
the support for the monophyly of all angiosperms except 
Amborella received 65% jackknife support (P. Soltis et al. 
2000); with 17 genes, BS support was 83% (Soltis et al. 
2011). With complete plastid genomes and large datasets of 
nuclear genes, support typically is > 95% BS (e.g., Moore 
et al. 2007; Drew et al. 2014; Ruhfel et al. 2014; Wickett 
et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2014). 
Several analyses support Amborella 
+ Nymphaeales as 
sister to all other living angiosperms (e.g., Barkman et al. 
2000; P. Soltis et al. 2000; Goremykin et al. 2009, 2013; 
Finet et al. 2010; Qiu et al. 2010; D. Soltis et al. 2007c; Wu 
et al. 2007). Some of these results may reflect the choice 
of genes or genomes used. Plastid analyses, especially 
complete plastid genome’ (Leebens-Mack et al. 2005; Cai 
et al. 2006; Jansen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2007; Ruh- 
fel et al. 2014), have generally provided strong support for 
Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms, followed by 
Nymphaeales and then Austrobaileyales (Savolainen et al. 
2000a; Borsch et al. 2003; Hilu et al. 2003; Moore et al. 
2011; Soltis et al. 2011). 
The nuclear genome also supports Amborella alone as 
sister to all other living angiosperms. Primarily due to the 
difficulty in confidently assessing orthology across a diverse 
clade such as seed plants, nuclear gene sequence data, with 
the exception of 18S and 26S rDNA, have not been widely 
used in large-scale phylogenetic studies of angiosperms un- 
til quite recently. Early analyses of 18S rDNA (see above) 
were the first to show the ANA grade to be subsequent sis- 
ter taxa to all other living angiosperms (Soltis et al. 1997b). 
Subsequent analyses of 18S and 18S + 26S rDNA contin- 
ued to point to the ANA grade as basalmost lineages, but 
support for relationships was low (Qiu et al. 1999; Bark- 
man et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2002; Qiu et al. 2005; Soltis 
et al. 2011), which is not surprising given the low signal in © 
these regions (P. Soltis and Soltis 1998). Nonetheless, a re- 
cent large analysis of numerous complete 18S + 26S rDNA 
sequences found Amborella alone (but with bootstrap sup- 
port of only 56%) as sister to all other angiosperms (Maia 
et al. 2014). Two phytochrome genes were also employed 
and also suggested Amborella sister to other angiosperms 
(Mathews and Donoghue 1999). 
Recent phylogenetic studies have used low-copy nuclear 
genes to investigate angiosperm relationships, as well as 
the root of the angiosperms (Finet et al. 2010; Lee et al. 
2011; Morton 2011; N. Zhang et al. 2012; Wickett et al. 
2014; Leebens-Mack et al. in prep.). Most of these stud- 
ies have supported Amborella alone as sister to all other 
angiosperms with varying degrees of internal support 
(Lee et al. 2011, >65% Maximum Likelihood (ML) BS; 
N. Zhang et al. 2012, ML BS = 83%, Posterior Probability 
(PP) in Bayesian analysis = 0.99; Wickett et al. 2014, ML 
BS >90%). In contrast, Finet et al. (2010) recovered Am- 
borella 
+ Nymphaeales as sister to other angiosperms but 
without BS support above 50% (ML BS = 49%); however, 
they also employed low taxon density. 
The mitochondrial genome provides the best support for 
the Amborella + Nymphaeales relationship, but that evi- 
dence is not strong. Typically mtDNA sequence data have 
been used in combination with sequences from other com- 

partments, and the combined data have typically recovered 
Amborella alone as sister to all other angiosperms, proba- 
bly due to the strength of the plastid signal (Qiu et al. 1999, 
2005; Zanis et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2011). Qiu et al. (2010) 
included sequence data from four mtDNA genes and broad 
taxonomic sampling and in an unpartitioned analysis found 
that Amborella plus Nymphaeales form a clade (ML BS = 
79%) that is sister to all other angiosperms. However, the 
mtDNA data may be more complex than initially thought. 
An analysis of third codon positions from the mtDNA data 
of Qiu et al. (2010) actually supports Amborella alone as 
sister to other angiosperms (ML BS = 66%; Drew et al. 
2014). The Amborella mitochondrial genome is also an ex- 
cellent example of horizontal gene transfer (Chapter 15). 
Method of phylogenetic analysis may also play a role in 
which topology is recovered at the base of the angiosperms. 
For example, parsimony analysis of the three-gene dataset 
(P. Soltis et al. 2000) recovered Amborella alone as sister 
to other angiosperms, whereas a Bayesian analysis of the 
same dataset recovered Amborella 
+ Nymphaeales (Soltis 
et al. 2007c). Analysis of a large five-gene dataset with par- 
simony provided strong support for Amborella alone as 
sister (BS = 83%), whereas ML analysis of the same dataset 
recovered a weakly supported (BS = 65%) clade of Ambo- 
rella + Nymphaeales (Burleigh et al. 2009). 
Reducing highly variable sites (“noise”; below) in data- 
sets has also recovered Amborella + Nymphaeales. One 
application of coalescent methods recovered Amborella 
+ Nymphaeales (Xi et al. 2014), but taxon sampling was 
sparse and other issues problematic (Simmons and Gatesy 
2015). In contrast, 
a coalescence-based 
analysis with 
greater taxon sampling yielded Amborella as sister to all 
remaining extant angiosperms (Wickett et al. 2014). 
NOISE-REDUCED DNA DATASETS 
As reviewed, studies using broad taxon sampling have typi- 
cally recovered Amborella as sister to other living angio- 
sperms, whereas noise-reduced datasets (highly variable 
sites are removed) often yield Amborella 
+ Nymphaeales. 
Barkman et al. (2000) employed the noise-reducing pro- 
gram RASA (Relative Apparent Synapomorphy Analy- 
sis; Lyons-Weiler et al. 1996) and recovered Amborella + 
Nymphaeales as sister to other angiosperms. However, the 
results of Barkman et al. (2000) varied depending on the 
method of analysis (e.g., parsimony vs. likelihood). 
More recently, Goremykin et al. (2013) investigated 
the effects of iteratively reducing “noise” in plastid data 
through removal of highly variable sites (per Goremykin 
et al. 2009) and concluded that Amborella + Nymphaeales 
formed a clade sister to all remaining angiosperms (with 
The ANA Grade 
67 
94% bootstrap support in one analysis). However, Graham 
and Iles (2009) investigated noise-reduction effects on the 
angiosperm rooting; their results suggesting the premise of 
this approach is problematic. Drew et al. (2014) carefully 
reexamined the analyses and findings of Goremykin et al. 
(2013). Significantly, analysis of the discarded characters 
from the noise-reduced alignments of Goremykin et al. 
(2012) produced a well-resolved tree with all major angio- 
sperm subgroups. The tree built on “noise” correctly recov- 
ered the accepted topology for angiosperms (e.g., Stevens 
2001 onwards; APG III 2009, APG IV 2016; Soltis et al. 
2011), confirming that these variable sites were, in general, 
not noise. Notably, Amborella appeared as sister to all other 
angiosperms. Analysis of larger plastid datasets with greater 
taxon sampling than used by Goremykin et al. (2012) pro- 
vides further support for Amborella alone as sister to all 
other angiosperms (Drew et al. 2014; Ruhfel et al. 2014). 
MORPHOLOGY + DNA DATA 
Nandi et al. (1998) conducted a morphological cladis- 
tic analysis of 162 extant angiosperms (Chapter 3)—and 
also combined these data with rbcL sequences. Although 
these analyses provided a framework tree for all major 
groups of angiosperms (Chapter 3), we review here only 
the results for the basalmost lineages. The non-molecular 
analyses revealed some relationships similar to those re- 
covered with DNA sequences, such as an early-branching 
clade of Austrobaileyaceae and Schisandraceae (including 
Illictum), whereas other relationships are clearly spurious, 
such as the placement of the eudicot Eupteleaceae as an 
early-branching angiosperm and the recovery of a clade 
dominated by magnoliids, but that also contains eudicots 
(e.g., Berberidopsidaceae, Nelumbonaceae). The combined 
morphology + rbcL tree placed Ceratophyllaceae, followed 
by a clade of Winterales, Austrobaileyales, Amborellaceae, 
and Nymphaeaceae, as sisters to all other extant angio- 
sperms. Hence, this combined tree shows many similarities 
to more widely accepted DNA-based trees. 
Doyle et al. (1994) combined a morphological data- 
set with a dataset of partial 18S and 26S rRNA sequences 
from Hamby and Zimmer (1992). However, the Hamby 
and Zimmer dataset did not contain sequences for several 
important taxa (e.g., Amborella). Doyle et al. (1994) de- 
leted some of the taxa for which sequence data were avail- 
able, but morphological data were lacking, to produce a 
molecular + morphological dataset that matched in taxon 
composition. As a result, some critical taxa were deleted 
from the molecular matrix (e.g., Illicium; see Hamby and 
Zimmer 1992). Analysis of the combined dataset yielded a 
topology in which Nymphaeales appeared as sister to all 

68 Chapter 4 
other angiosperms (Doyle et al. 1994), followed by mono- 
cots, a clade of Piperaceae + Saururaceae, and then Aris- 
tolochiaceae as subsequent sisters to the rest of the angio- 
sperms (the latter three families are covered in Chapter 5). 
Thus, the Doyle et al. (1994) analysis again placed herba- 
ceous taxa as sisters to all other extant angiosperms. 
Doyle and Endress (2000) conducted an extensive cla- 
distic analysis of angiosperms (including basal angio- 
sperms) using morphological and molecular data. Com- 
pared to the earlier study of Donoghue and Doyle (1989b), 
Doyle and Endress (2000) increased the number of taxa 
from 27 to 52 and the number of morphological characters 
from 54 to 108. The shortest trees based on morphology 
revealed what they termed as “shifts toward molecular re- 
sults,” due in some cases directly to the addition of new 
characters, such as carpel form. With morphology alone, 
Amborella, followed by Chloranthaceae, and then Trime- 
niaceae (Austrobaileyales) were subsequent sisters to all 
other angiosperms. However, in some instances the non- 
DNA characters resulted in important differences in the 
placement of taxa compared to DNA-based trees. A signifi- 
cant conclusion of Doyle and Endress (2000) and earlier 
analyses of DNA + morphology is that morphology may be 
more consistent with molecular data than was previously 
thought (Nandi et al. 1998; Chase et al. 2000b). 
Doyle and Endress (2000) also combined morphology 
with sequences for three genes (18S rDNA, rbcL, atpB), 
Amborellaceae 
Nymphaeaceae 
resulting 
in shortest 
trees 
with Amborella, Nympha- 
eales, and Austrobaileyales as subsequent sisters to other 
angiosperms—identical to the DNA-based topology; the 
remainder of their tree also matched results from DNA- 
based trees (Fig. 4.2). That this matrix with ~100 morpho- 
logical characters and ~4700 nucleotides should produce a 
topology similar to that based on DNA sequences alone is 
not surprising. 
Doyle and Endress continued to refine the morphologi- 
cal matrix (Endress and Doyle 2009; Doyle and Endress 
2010, 2014; Doyle 2012), for example, adding Hydatel- 
laceae and Ceratophyllum. However, they used the Doyle 
and Endress (2000) combined morphology + DNA tree 
as a constraint and not surprisingly recovered Amborella, 
Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales as subsequent sisters 
to other angiosperms. They noted that there were continu- 
ing problems with the overall topology when a DNA con- 
straint was not used. 
An important use of the Endress and Doyle (2009) 
combined matrix and tree of basal angiosperm relation- 
ships was the placement of fossil taxa (Endress and Doyle 
2009; Doyle and Endress 2010, 2014; Doyle 2012). For 
example, Doyle and Endress (2010) attempted to place the 
herbaceous fossil Archaefructus (Chapter 3). Importantly, 
in their analyses Archaefructus appears either as sister 
to Hydatellaceae (Nymphaeales) (Fig. 4.3) or as sister to 
Ceratophyllum—not as sister to all other angiosperms.

THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING THE 
ANGIOSPERM ROOT 
Angiosperms represent one of the great terrestrial radia- 
tions with an enormous global economic and ecological 
impact. How did angiosperms accomplish this over a rela- 
tively short span of evolutionary time—from an origin in 
the late Jurassic/Cretaceous to present? Understanding the 
root of the angiosperms is critical to clarifying not only 
the diversification of angiosperms, but also the evolution of 
diverse morphological and chemical features, and aspects 
of angiosperm genome evolution. In addition, this knowl- 
edge will help elucidate many key processes whereby plant/ 
animal associations and entire ecosystems assembled. 
It was clear in early DNA investigations that under- 
standing the structure and evolution of flowering plant 
genomes (as well as seed plant genomes in general) would 
contribute to agriculture and forestry. However, until re- 
cently, the angiosperm genomes that have been sequenced 
represent phylogenetically derived clades of the angio- 
sperm tree (Fig. 3.9). As a result, these genomes provide 
few, if any, insights into the characteristics of the “ancestral 
angiosperm” (Soltis et al. 2008a; Amborella Genome Proj- 
ect 2013). For example, a complete understanding of any 
gene or genomic feature requires a phylogenetic perspective 
based on evolutionary relationships. 
The analyses (summarized here) showing Amborella 
as sister to other flowering plants, focused attention on 
Amborella, as well as on Nymphaeaceae and Austrobai- 
leyales, as sisters to all other angiosperms. The realization 
that Amborella is the sister to all other living angiosperms 
offers the unique ability to “root” analyses of all angio- 
sperm features, from gene families to genome structure to 
morphology, chemistry, pollination, and more. For exam- 
ple, floral morphology, physiological ecology, and wood 
anatomy of Amborella have been carefully investigated 
multiple times (Endress and Igersheim 2000a,b; Feild 
et al. 2000a; Carlquist and Schneider 2001; Posluszny 
and Tomlinson 2003; Soltis et al. 2008a). Floral morphol- 
ogy and endosperm development have been compared in 
Amborella and Nymphaeales (Floyd and Friedman 2000; 
Endress 2001a; Williams and Friedman 2002; Buzgo et al. 
2004b; Friedman 2006, 2008), and both lineages have 
also become the focus of analyses of floral organ identity 
genes (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2002b; Kim et al. 2004a; Stellari 
et al. 2004; Chanderbali et al. 2010; Amborella Genome 
Project 2013). 
Here we use this newly gained phylogenetic perspective 
to discuss the evolution of key morphological and genomic 
features of angiosperms. 
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE 
BASALMOST ANGIOSPERMS 
As it became clear that Amborella, Nymphaeales, and 
Austrobaileyales represent the basalmost angiosperm lin- 
eages, researchers began’to examine morphological and 
other non-DNA features to corroborate these placements 
(e.g., Doyle and Endress 2000; Feild et al. 2000a; Soltis 
et al. 2005b). Importantly, Amborella possesses vesselless 
wood—the plants have only tracheids for water conduction 
(Bailey and Swamy 1948; Doyle and Endress 2000), and 
in that way are similar to most gymnosperms (Figs. 4.4). 
This feature therefore supports Amborella as sister to other 
angiosperms. More detailed investigations (Herendeen and 
Miller 2000; Carlquist and Schneider 2001, 2002) revealed 
that wood anatomy is complex and not a simple binary 
character, but rather as a suite of characters (Table 4.1). 
Carlquist (2012) more recently reviewed wood anatomy, 
inferring what early angiosperm wood may have been like 
and stressing that cell types other than vessel elements may 
make important contributions to conductive efficiency. 
Nonetheless, wood anatomy is consistent with the posi- 
tion of Amborella branching near the base of the angio- 
sperm tree, although not necessarily as the sole basal lin- 
eage (Carlquist and Schneider 2001, 2002) (Fig. 4.4). The 
aquatic habit of Nymphaeales makes comparisons of wood 
— 
anatomy among basal angiosperms more complicated in 
that these plants lack vessels in stem tissue, although vessels 
are found in their roots. Are vesselless stems the ancestral 
state for Nymphaeales, or could this represent a secondary 
loss due to the aquatic habit? This is unclear. Members of 
Austrobaileyales have water-conducting cells that are in- 
termediate between tracheids and vessels. Hence, in stem 
tissue, members of the ANA grade have either no vessels, or 
cells that are intermediate between those of tracheids and 
vessels, arguing that the earliest angiosperms stems may 
have lacked vessels. 
Several other morphological features also support a 
basal branching position for Amborella (as well as Nym- 
phaeales and Austrobaileyales). Briefly, there are two ex- 
tremes of carpel form (Doyle and Endress 2000), plicate 
and ascidiate. Ascidiate carpels are formed via invagination 
to form a pitcher-like, hollow structure with ovules inside. 
The plicate carpel resembles a folded leaf and is formed 
by one-sided elongation of the terminal part of the ascidi- 
ate carpel. Ascidiate carpels characterize Amborella, most 
Nymphaeaceae, Austrobaileyaceae, most Schisandraceae, 
and Trimeniaceae (Endress and Igersheim 2000b) (Fig. 4.5). 
Intermediate carpel forms are present in Barclaya (Nym- 
phaeaceae) and also in IIlicium (Schisandraceae). Follow- 
ing Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Austrobaileyales,

The ANA Grade

Figure 4.4. 
Changes proposed to have occurred during evolu- 
tion of vessel elements from tracheids in vesselless angiosperms 
(modified from Carlquist and Schneider 2002). (A) Vesselless 
angiosperm; tracheids similar to those present in Amborella. 
(B) Vessel-bearing-angiosperm. The vessel (on the left) and the 
tracheid (on the right) are similar to those found in Iilicium in 
which the vessels exhibit “tracheid” features (see text). The six 
changes between tracheids and vessels are illustrated: (1) Pit 
membranes of end walls of tracheids typically are nonporose 
(not shown), but in some taxa the pit membranes become po- 
rose (C). As vessels originate, varying degrees of pit membrane 
remnants are visible in perforations (D). In contrast, pit mem- 
branes of the lateral walls of vessels remain intact and nonpo- 
rose, just as they are on lateral walls of tracheids (E). (2) Conduc- 
tive area of the end wall of the wider tracheid in A is larger than 
the conductive area of pits of the tracheid lateral walls because 
the pits are larger on the end walls. This is interpreted as an 
incipient form of vessel-like structure in Amborella. As vessels 
originate, the differences in size of perforations become more 
pronounced. (3) There are proposed changes in the morphol- 
ogy of perforations of end walls compared to lateral walls when 
vessels originate. One difference is the narrower borders on the 
perforations of the vessel compared to borders of lateral pit walls 
(shown); other differences in morphology of lateral wall pits also 
occur (see Table 4.1). (4) Vessel elements become wider than the 
tracheids that they accompany. The vessel element in B is wider 
than the associated tracheid. (5) Vessel elements are shorter 
than the tracheids that they accompany. Whereas tracheids are 
all the same length in wood that lacks vessels (A), vessel-bearing 
wood has vessel elements shorter than the tracheary elements 
they accompany (B). (6). Tracheids in vesselless wood (A) are 
longer than both the vessel elements and the tracheids of vessel- 
bearing wood (B). That is, the origin of vessels results in shorter 
vessel elements and also shorter tracheid elements. (Legend 
modified from Carlquist and Schneider 2002.) (Fig. 3.10 from 
Soltis et al. 2005). 
phaeaceae, and Austrobaileyales have carpels that are not 
sealed by postgenital fusion but by secretion—that is, the 
carpel is essentially glued shut (Fig. 4.6); in contrast, most 
Mesangiospermae have carpels that are postgenitally fused 
(Fig. 4.6). Amborella and Austrobaileya (see below) have 
distinctly laminar (leaf-like) stamens as do some Nympha- 
eaceae (Fig. 4.7; see also Fig. 4.10, below). 
We review some of the general features of ANA grade 
members 
below. We 
also 
have conducted 
extensive 
character-state reconstructions across the angiosperms in 
an effort to infer the ancestral states for a suite of morpho- 
logical and other features. These are discussed in a separate 
chapter (Chapter 6). 
AMBORELLACEAE 
We describe here some of the general features of Amborella 
trichopoda (the sole species of Amborella). Because of the 
enormous interest in this taxon we dedicate more space to 
our coverage of Amborella trichopoda than other species. 
Amborella is an understory shrub to small tree found 

72 Chapter 4 
only in New Caledonia, where fewer than 20 populations 
are known. The alternate, simple, pinnately veined leaves 
of Amborella possess chloranthoid teeth, the function of 
which is unknown, but from evidence in ferns (Sperry 1983) 
may function as release valves for root pressure (Feild et al. 
2003a, 2004). Chloranthoid teeth are present in several ba- 
salmost angiosperm lineages, including not only Amborella 
(Bailey and Swamy 1948) but also Kadsura and Schisandra 
(Schisandraceae; Hickey and Wolfe 1975) and species of 
Trimenia (Trimeniaceae; Rodenburg 1971; Endress 1987c). 
Doyle and Endress (2000) suggested that chloranthoid leaf 
teeth are ancestral in the angiosperms although reconstruc- 
tions remain equivocal (Soltis et al. 2005b; Chapter 6). 
As noted earlier, Amborella possesses vesselless wood (see 
above; Table 4.1). 
The inflorescences of Amborella are produced in the 
axil of foliage leaves and are monotelic and considered 
botryoids or poorly ramified panicles (Endress and Iger- 
sheim 2000). Amborella is dioecious but the carpellate 
flowers have sterile stamens (= staminodes or staminodia) 
(Fig. 4.7), suggesting that the ancestral condition in an- 
giosperms is bisexual (perfect) flowers (Endress and Iger- 
sheim 2000b; Buzgo et al. 2004b). The flowers are small 
(3-5 mm in diameter) and appear to have many features 
of the small flowers that appear early in the fossil record 
(see chapter 2 and Friis et al. 2011). The flowers possess an 
undifferentiated, spirally arranged perianth, subtended by 
spirally arranged bracts (Fig. 4.7). The staminate flowers 
have 9-11 tepals and possess 12-21 laminar stamens. The 
inner stamens are gradually smaller than the outer ones. 
Williams (2009) found that the in vivo pollen tube 
growth rate of Amborella is similar to that of many other 
early-diverging angiosperms, but much faster than that 
of any gymnosperm. However, the rate of pollen tube

from Endress1994a.) 
growth in Amborella is among the slowest in angiosperms, 
prompting Williams (2009) to propose that the earliest an- 
giosperms had very slow pollen tube growth rates. 
The carpellate flowers possess 7-8 tepals. One to sev- 
eral staminodia are present, followed by 4-6 carpels, each 
with a single ovule. Each carpel develops into a small drupe 
(resulting, potentially, in an aggregate of drupes). Ascidiate 
carpels characterize Amborella (as well as most Nympha- 
_ 
eaceae, Austrobaileyaceae, most Schisandraceae, and Tri- 
meniaceae; Endress and Igersheim 2000b). As with most 
ascidiate carpels in the ANA grade, the carpels of Ambo- 
rella are sealed by secretion rather than by postgenital fu- 
sion (Fig. 4.6; Endress and Igersheim 2000b). The ovules in 
Amborella have been variously described as orthotropous, 
anatropous, or intermediate (Tobe et al. 2000), but are 
here considered orthotropous (see Endress and Igersheim 
2000b; Endress 201 1a; Fig. 4.8). 
The embryo sac (female gametophyte) of Amborella 
is distinctive (Tobe et al. 2000; Friedman 2006; Rudall 
2006). Friedman (2006) reported a seven-celled and eight- 
nucleate stage in young Amborella flowers with three cells 
at each pole of the embryo sac as well as a large central 
cell with two nuclei—comparable to what is observed in 
most angiosperms. However, this is not the final stage in 
development of the Amborella embryo sac. A mitotic cell 
division at the micropylar end of the embryo sac produces 
a ninth nucleus and an eighth cell (Friedman 2006). The 
end result is that Amborella possesses an embryo sac with 
eight cells and nine nuclei. This contrasts with (but is most 
similar to) the seven-celled and eight-nucleate embryo sac 
typical of most angiosperms. Interestingly, however, Nym- 
phaeales and Austrobaileyales are both characterized by 
a four-nucleate embryo sac (see below; reviewed in Fried- 
man and Ryerson 2009). There is also strong evidence that

double fertilization occurs in Amborella, resulting in trip- 
loid endosperm, whereas diploid endosperm is present in 
Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales (reviewed in Williams 
2009). Taken together, these studies reveal considerable 
developmental lability in the embryology of basal angio- 
sperms (Friedman 2006; Rudall 2006; Williams 2009). 
There has been considerable interest in the pollination 
biology of basal angiosperms (e.g., Thien et al. 2000, 2003, 
2009). Thien et al. (2003, 2008) showed that flowers of 
Amborella are both wind- and insect-pollinated. Amborella 
flowers appear to offer only pollen as the resource for visit- 
ing insects—neither floral odor nor heat (another insect at- 
tractor) was detected (Endress and Igersheim 2000a; Thien 
et al. 2003). However, Collett (1999) noted that scent 
was produced at night, with visits by numerous moths in 
greenhouse-grown plants (reviewed in Thien et al. 2008). 
However, no insects were observed at night on the flowers 
of A. trichopoda in nature (Thien et al. 2003)—all the in- 
sects observed as visitors (Coleoptera, Homoptera, Hemip- 
tera, Microlepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera) were 
captured during the day (Thien et al. 2008). 
THE AMBORELLA NUCLEAR GENOME 
The recently sequenced Amborella genome has provided 
crucial new insights into the earliest angiosperm genomes 
while serving as an evolutionary reference for compari- 
sons with other angiosperms (Amborella Genome Project 
2013). To briefly summarize here, the complete genome of 
Amborella facilitated comparative genomic analyses that 
confirmed that an ancient genome duplication predated all 
living angiosperms (see Jiao et al. 2011). However, unlike 
all other sequenced angiosperm genomes, the Amborella 
genome shows no evidence of more recent, lineage-specific 
genome duplications. This feature of the Amborella ge- 
nome makes Amborella well suited as a reference genome 
for the interpretation of genomic changes after polyploidy 
in other angiosperms. Via comparison to the Amborella ge- 
nome, an ancient hexaploidy event (i.e., two polyploidiza- 
tions in close succession) was confirmed in the eudicots. 
Furthermore, synteny is highly conserved in Amborella 
and the genomes of other angiosperms (see Chapter 15). 
This conserved synteny between the genomes of Amborella 
and other angiosperms has enabled reconstruction of an- 
cestral gene order in eudicots. Annotation of the Ambo- 
rella genome and comparative analysis across sequenced 
plant genomes has enabled reconstruction of the ancestral 
angiosperm gene set of at least 14,000 genes. Analysis of 
the Amborella genome revealed that over 1200 gene lin- 
eages were gained in the ancestral angiosperm relative to 
other seed plants, with many of the genes gained including 
those important in flowering. The Amborella genome has 
retained ancient transposons, but, significantly, the genome 
lacks evidence for any recent transposon insertions (Chap- 
ternal). 
“Resequencing” of the Amborella genome from 12 
plants representing most known natural populations has 
also been informative. These 12 individuals harbor levels 
of genetic diversity similar to those reported for species of 
Populus, which are also outcrossing perennials. Genetic 
variation among Amborella populations is significantly 
structured into three geographic clusters of populations on 
New Caledonia (Fig. 4.9), corresponding roughly to popu- 
lations in (1) the northern and eastern part of the range, 
(2) the southern and western part of the range, and (3) a 
single disjunct location at the southern end of the distribu- 
tion. These results generally support those obtained through 
analysis of 10 microsatellite loci (Poncet et al. 2012, 2013). 
Conservation efforts in New Caledonia should focus on 
conserving and managing the genetic diversity found in the 
geographic clusters of this relictual angiosperm species. 
The mitochondrial genome of Amborella is unusually 
large and contains genes of several other diverse lineages of 
land plants, including mosses and other angiosperms (Berg- 
thorsson et al. 2004).

tracted interest as a putatively ancient lineage of angio- 
sperms, given various flower features considered “primitive” 
by earlier generations of researchers. Some investigators 
once suggested that Nymphaeaceae might be closely al- 
lied with monocots; some even suggested that monocots 
might be derived from Nymphaeaceae or a now-extinct 
Nymphaeaceae-like lineage of ancient angiosperms (Hallier 
1905; Eber 1934; Arber 1920; Cronquist 1968; Takhtajan 
1969, 1991; Burger 1977). Interest in Nymphaeaceae in- 
creased after the earliest cladistic analyses based on mor- 
phology (e.g., Donoghue and Doyle 1989a,b) and mol- 
ecules (Hamby and Zimmer 1988) indicated that these 
plants might be sister to all other angiosperms. As reviewed 
above, a series of phylogenetic studies using both non-DNA 
and extensive DNA characters have only strengthened sup- 
port for Nymphaeaceae as one of the basalmost lineages 
of extant angiosperms. The clade also appears early in the 
fossil record. Friis et al. (2001, 2009) provided the earliest 
unequivocal fossil evidence of Nymphaeaceae, extending 
the history of the group into the Early Cretaceous (125- 
115 mya) and into the oldest fossil assemblages that contain 
stamens and carpels. 
Traditional treatments of the water lilies have varied 
considerably (reviewed in Les et al. 1991, 1999). Cronquist 
(1981, 1988) recognized several families (e.g., Nympha- 
eaceae, Cabombaceae, and Barclayaceae), while also con- 
sidering Ceratophyllaceae closely related to these families; 
he also included the eudicot family Nelumbonaceae within 
Nymphaeales. Takhtajan (1997) recognized six families of 
water lilies as part of his subclass Nymphaeidae. 
As now recognized (APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), 
Nymphaeales include Nymphaeaceae, Cabombaceae, and 
the small aquatic family Hydatellaceae, which was previ- 
ously placed in Poales. As reviewed elsewhere, Hydatella- 
ceae were traditionally considered to be monocots, based 
on a morphological similarity to the monocot family Cen- 
trolepidaceae. However, sequence data and a combined 
morphological and DNA analysis revealed that Trithuria 
is sister to Nymphaeaceae (Saarela et al. 2007). Previous 
analyses that had placed the family in Poales appear to be 
the result of sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-recombinant. Hydatellaceae include only the genus 
Trithuria (~12 species), which has been recently redefined 
to include the genus Hydatella (Sokoloff et al. 2008) (see 
Fig. 4.10). 
Plants of Hydatellaceae are small, simple in overall form, 
and aquatic or semi-aquatic annuals (Figs. 4.10, 4.11); they 
occur in Australasia and India. The linear leaves are clus- 
tered at the base of a short stem. Species are monoecious 
or dioecious and pollination has been hypothesized to be 
by wind, water, or selfing, but analyses of the reproductive 
ecology of T: submersa reveal selfing as well as outcrossing 
by wind, but not by water or insects (Taylor et al. 2010). 
Although plants of Trithuria are highly modified in mor- 
phology, they nonetheless exhibit embryological features of 
Nymphaeales including a very small biparental endosperm 
and embryo (Friedman et al. 2012). Despite some debate 
in terms of the number of cotyledons (Tillich et al. 2007), 
careful investigation reveals that the embryo initiates two 
cotyledons (Friedman et al. 2012; Sokoloff et al. 2013a). 
The floral/inflorescence morphology of Hydatellaceae is 
unusual (Fig. 4.11). The reproductive units of the family 
consist of perianth-like bracts that enclose several carpels

and/or stamens. Hamann (1975) and Rudall et al. (2007, 
2009) suggest that one interpretation of these structures is 
that each reproductive unit represents an aggregation of re- 
duced, unisexual, perianthless flowers—thus, each unit may 
represent a pseudanthium (an inflorescence that appears to 
be a single flower). The floral/inflorescence morphology of 
Hydatellaceae is therefore very different from other Nym- 
phaeales and indicates that the clade may have been once 
far more diverse than today (Fig. 4.3). In this regard, it is 
noteworthy that some analyses have potentially placed the 

fossil genus Archaefructus within Nymphaeales, perhaps 
as sister to Hydatellaceae (Endress and Doyle 2009; Doyle 
and Endress 2010; see Chapter 3). Chromosomal studies 
of Trithuria submersa reveal an unusual meiotic behavior 
(Kynast et al. 2014); the authors speculate that this could 
provide new insights into the ancestral microsporogenesis 
of angiosperms, but acknowledge that this could simply be 
a derived feature. 
Many phylogenetic analyses (focused studies as well as 
broad analyses of angiosperms) have found strong sup- 
port for a split of Brasenia and Cabomba (Cabombaceae) 
from Nymphaeaceae (in the strict sense) (e.g., Les et al. 
1999; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; Yoo et al. 2005; Lohne 
et al. 2007). We follow the suggested treatment of APG III 
(2009) and APG IV (2016) and use the family name Nym- 
phaeaceae to designate a narrowly defined family and use 
Cabombaceae for Cabomba and Brasenia (see Les et al. 
1999). Nymphaeaceae in the strict sense consist of six 
genera: Barclaya, Euryale, Nuphar, Nymphaea, Ondinea, 
and Victoria (Fig. 4.1). The two families are recognized as 
two subfamilies (Nymphaeoideae and Cabomboideae) by 
others; see Les et al. 1999; Judd et al. 2008. A number of 
features readily distinguish the two families (or subfami- 
lies). In some molecular phylogenetic analyses, Victoria, 
Euryale, and Ondinea are derived from within Nymphaea 
s.l. (Lo6hne et al. 2007, 2008, 2009; Borsch et al. 2008). 
There has been debate as to when the major split be- 
tween Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae occurred. Lohne 
et al. (2008) proposed a divergence time of ~56.4 (with a 
range of 75-38) mya. In contrast, Yoo et al. (2005) deter- 
mined a somewhat younger timeframe for this split, esti- 
mating that extant Nymphaeales diversified into two major 
clades corresponding to Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae 
during the Eocene (44.6 + 7.9 mya); extant genera of Nym- 
phaeaceae date to 41.1 + 7.7 mya, and extant Cabomba- 
ceae diversified during the Miocene (19.9 + 5.6 mya). Im- 
portantly, both of these estimates (Yoo et al. 2005; Lohne 
et al. 2008) suggest that whereas the stem lineage of Nym- 
phaeales is old based on fossil evidence (125-115 mya), ex- 
tant Nymphaeales may have diversified relatively recently 
(but see Iles et al. 2014). Similar results have been reported 
for other “old” basal lineages, such as Chloranthaceae (see 
Chapter 5) and IlIlicium (Schisandraceae). 
The flowers of Cabombaceae have few parts. Cabomba 
flowers usually have two whorls of three petaloid tepals, 
3 or 6 whorled stamens, and 3 to 18 whorled carpels 
(Fig. 4.10). Flowers of Nymphaeaceae are diverse, with a 
large range in the number and appearance of floral parts. 
The perianth is composed of 4 to many tepals (typically 
petal-like) that may intergrade with the staminodia and 
stamens (e.g., Nymphaea) (Fig. 4.12); in fact, many of 
these petal-like structures are not true tepals but instead 
The ANA Grade 
79 
are petaloid staminodia. In Nuphar, the outer perianth or- 
gans are large and green and yellow (petal-like in appear- 
ance) whereas the inner perianth organs are petal-like and 
small (Fig. 4.10e) (Hiepko 1965b; Endress 2008). Stamens 
are numerous, the innermost sometimes represented by sta- 
minodia (Fig. 4.10e). Stamens vary from laminar to hav- 
ing a well-differentiated filament and anther. The carpels 
are many (ovaries semi-inferior to inferior) and connate, in 
contrast to the separate carpels of Cabombaceae. 
The floral phyllotaxis in Nymphaeaceae has been de- 
bated. Ronse De Craene et al. (2003) considered Brasenia 
and Cabomba to have whorled phyllotaxis and the phyl- 
lotaxis of other genera (Nymphaea, Victoria, Nuphar) to 
be polymorphic, with early organs appearing in a whorled 
arrangement and later ones in a spiral. Zanis et al. (2003), 
in contrast, scored Nymphaea, Victoria, and Nuphar as 
spiral. In what represents the best assessment of these 
flowers, Endress (2001a) indicated that the phyllotaxis of 
Nymphaea, Victoria, and Nuphar is whorled and then may 
become irregular in development, but not spiral. 
On the basis of longstanding views of angiosperm flo- 
ral evolution, flowers such as Nymphaea and Victoria 
with numerous floral parts were considered “primitive” 
(see Bessey 1915; Cronquist 1968, 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 
1969, 1987, 1991, 1997; Stebbins 1974). However, using 
the well-resolved tree available for Nymphaeaceae and esti- 
mates for stamen number from Les et al. (1999), our simple 
character reconstructions (Fig. 4.13) indicate instead that 
numerous floral parts are derived, rather than ancestral, in 
Nymphaeaceae. This result contrasts with the traditional 
view (see Stebbins 1974) that secondary increases in num- 
ber could occur in some floral organs, such as stamens, but 
that such increases were likely rare. The greatest number of 
petals, stamens, and carpels occurs in Nymphaea and Vic- 
toria, which represent derived genera within the family (we 
illustrate only stamen number; Fig. 4.13). These character 
reconstructions support Schneider (1979), who earlier sug- 
gested that numerous floral parts within the family were of 
secondary origin. 
The number of floral parts present in genera of Nym- 
phaeaceae may be associated with pollination (Gottsberger 
1977, 1988; Les etal. 1999; Lippok et al.2000). Large flowers 
with numerous parts, such as Nymphaea and Victoria, may 
represent an evolutionary response to herbivory by beetles, 
which are major pollinators. Genera with lower numbers of 
floral organs have different pollinators or pollination sys- 
tems. The smaller number of floral parts in Euryale, another 
derived genus (Fig. 4.1), appears to represent a decrease 
associated with cleistogamy and self-pollination. Also, the 
increase in number of stamens in Brasenia versus Cabomba 
may relate to the shift from insect to wind pollination (see 
Williamson and Schneider 1993a; Les et al. 1999).

“AO 
Or 
Embryo sac development in Nymphaeales is notewor- 
thy (Fig. 4.14). Whereas most angiosperms have an eight- 
nucleate and seven-cell embryo sac (including Amborella), 
Nymphaeales (including Hydatellaceae) and some Aus- 
trobaileyales have a 4-nucleate and 4-celled embryo sac 
(Winter et al. 1991; Tobe et al. 2007; see also Friedman 
2006, 2008; Rudall et al. 2008). In addition, Nymphaeales 
produce diploid endosperm, which is also characteristic of 
Austrobaileyales (see Tobe et al. 2007; Williams and Fried- 
man 2002), but not Amborellaceae. Although it is tempting 
to speculate that early angiosperms therefore had diploid 
endosperm, the reconstructions are equivocal (because of 
triploid endosperm in Amborella; see Williams and Fried- 
man 2002). In Nymphaeales, the endosperm is poorly de- 
veloped, with perisperm (a nutritive tissue derived from 
nucellus) playing a major nutritive role (Friedman 2008). 
Nymphaeales have also been of interest in terms of flo- 
ral organ identity and developmental genetics. Yoo et al. 
(2010) investigated the expression patterns of floral organ 
identity genes in Cabomba, Nuphar, and Nymphaea. They 
focused on gene expression associated with (1) perianth dif- 
ferentiation in Nymphaeales, (2) the transition of petaloid 
staminodia to stamens, and (3) patterns of expression of 
organ identity genes in Nymphaeaceae and Cabombaceae. 
In Cabomba, the expression patterns of B-class gene ho- 
mologues fit the “sliding boundaries” model, with B-class 
gene expression in sepals and petals (see Chapter 14). In 
contrast, Nuphar and Nymphaea exhibit broad B-class 
gene expression that extends across all floral organs (i.e., 
“fading borders” model). This broad pattern of MADS- 
box gene expression suggests that the innermost petals of

AUSTROBAILEYALES 
Bootstrap support for Austrobaileyales is consistently very 
high (95-100%)—even 
in early analyses of combined 
DNA datasets (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2002, 
2003). The clade comprises Schisandraceae (including II- 
licium, which is often placed in Illiciaceae) as well as two 
small families from Australasia, Austrobaileyaceae and 
Trimeniaceae. However, Trimeniaceae and Austrobaileya- 
ceae were not considered closely related to Schisandraceae 
in any morphology-based classifications (e.g., Cronquist 
1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1997). Trimeniaceae were usually 
placed in Laurales, separate from Schisandraceae (Cron- 
quist 1981; Takhtajan 1997). A cladistic analysis of non- 
DNA characters (Doyle and Endress 2000) did not recover 
an Austrobaileyales clade. However, the cladistic analysis 
of non-DNA characters by Nandi et al. (1998) did recon- 
struct a clade of Austrobaileyaceae and Schisandraceae. 
However, non-DNA synapomorphies uniting Trimeniaceae 
with other members of this clade are still unclear, except 
for caducousness of tepals (see Endress 2008). Although 
Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae s.s. have been placed in Il- 
liciales, the oldest ordinal name for the clade comprising 
Austrobaileyaceae, Trimeniaceae, and Schisandraceae 
is 
Austrobaileyales. 
Within Austrobaileyales, relationships are strongly sup- 
ported, with Austrobaileyaceae (with a single genus, Aus-

trobaileya) sister to the rest of the clade (e.g., Qiu et al. 
liciaceae (which itself comprises only Illicium). Even in 
1999; Renner 1999; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen et al. 
morphology-based classifications that recognized IIliciaceae 
2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000). Trimeniaceae (compris- 
and Schisandraceae, the two families exhibit many morpho- 
ing the single genus, Trimenia) are then sister to a well- 
logical similarities and were considered very closely related 
supported Schisandraceae (Schisandra and Kadsura), which 
and placed in Illiciales (Cronquist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 
as noted above also includes the formerly recognized Il- 
1997). Both Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae have pollen 

similar to the triaperturate pollen of eudicots—a feature 
not found elsewhere among basal angiosperms (Cronquist 
1981; Sampson 2000). However, this is a convergence; the 
configuration of apertures in the tetrad of Schisandraceae 
differs from eudicots. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that 
Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae s.s. are sister taxa, and be- 
cause of their morphological similarity, they have been con- 
sidered a single family, Schisandraceae (see APG II 2003; 
APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
As in Nymphaeales, the embryo sac in Austrobaileyales 
is four-celled and four-nucleate, as shown for Schisandra 
(Swamy 1964), Illictum (Williams and Friedman 2004), 
Austrobaileya (Tobe et al. 2007), and Trimenia (Friedman 
and Bachelier 2013) (Fig. 4.14). Although it is tempting to 
speculate that the four-celled and four-nucleate condition 
is ancestral for angiosperms, Amborella possesses an eight- 
celled, nine-nucleate embryo sac that is, in some ways, more 
typical of most angiosperms—that is, it possesses antipo- 
dals and two polar nuclei. As a result, ancestral-state recon- 
structions for the angiosperms are equivocal (Chapter 6). 
The endosperm in those Austrobaileyales analyzed is 
diploid (Williams and Friedman 2004), as in Nymphaeales 
(see above), and is also well developed (with the exception 
of Trimenia), and no perisperm is produced. In this regard, 
Austrobaileyales are more like Amborella; Nymphaeales, 
in contrast, produce little endosperm and do produce peri- 
sperm (see above; Floyd and Friedman 2001; Friedman 
2008). 
Pollination has been examined in several Austrobai- 
leyales (Endress 2010b). Diptera (flies and especially gall- 
midges) and Coleoptera (beetles) have been reported as 
pollinators (Endress 1980b; Yuan et al. 2007); flowers 
produce odor with pollen as the floral reward. In Trime- 
nia, wind, flies, and bees have been reported, again with 
odor production and pollen as the reward. Schisandraceae 
primarily are pollinated by flies, as well as beetles, with 
both pollen and nectar feeding reported (Thien et al. 2009). 
Flowers of Schisandraceae are also noteworthy in that 
The ANA Grade 
83 
floral heat is used as a mechanism to attract pollinators (re- 
viewed in Thien et al. 2009). Austrobaileya is fly pollinated 
(Endress 1980b). 
Austrobaileya comprises one species of woody vines that 
produces ethereal oils. The flowers are large with a spirally 
arranged perianth of numerous parts (the outer more sepal- 
like and the inner more petal-like). Stamens are also numer- 
ous, spirally arranged, laminar, petaloid, and not differenti- 
ated into filament and anther; carpels are also numerous 
and spirally arranged (Fig. 4.15); developing into berries. 
Based on these floral features, the family was often consid- 
ered “primitive” in traditional treatments (e.g., Cronquist 
1981; Takhtajan 1987). 
Trimeniaceae comprise shrubs and vines with ethereal 
oils. The flowers are small, hypogynous, and either perfect 
or unisexual. Tepals are numerous, spirally arranged, with 
a gradual transition of bracts subtending them, and early 
caducous (Fig. 4.15). The stamens are also numerous and 
spirally arranged, and the typically single carpel develops 
into a drupe. 
Schisandraceae consist of vines (Schisandra and Kad- 
sura) and trees and shrubs (Illicium) that produce ethereal 
oils. Flowers are bisexual or unisexual, actinomorphic with 
numerous, spirally arranged tepals, the outer more sepal- 
like (Fig. 4.15). The gradual transition from outer bracts 
to outer tepals and then inner tepals in some members is 
similar to the bracts and tepals of Amborella (Fig. 4.15). 
The stamens are numerous, spirally arranged, poorly dif- 
ferentiated into filament and anther (laminar-like), and 
distinct (in Illicium) to variably connate. The carpels are 
7 to numerous, distinct, and in a single series, which is not 
a whorl in the morphological sense because phyllotaxis is 
spiral (the carpels having a distinctive appearance in fruit 
in Illicium), to spirally arranged (in Schisandra and Kad- 
sura); the ovary is superior. Fruit is an aggregate of follicles 
(with explosive seed release) or berries, borne on a short to 
elongate receptacle. 

, Magnoliids and Chloranthales 
INTRODUCTION 
The magnoliids (Magnoliidae of Cantino et al. 2007) consist 
of Magnoliales, Laurales, Piperales, and Canellales; some 
analyses indicate they are sister to Chloranthales. Magno- 
liids + Chloranthales occupy a pivotal position—they may 
be sister to the eudicots + Ceratophyllaceae plus monocots 
(Chapter 3). In early phylogenetic analyses (e.g., D. Soltis 
et al. 2000), a more broadly defined magnoliid clade (then 
called the eumagnoliids) included not only Magnoliales, 
Laurales, Piperales, and Canellales, but also Chlorantha- 
ceae and monocots. However, analyses of additional genes 
have indicated that this broader circumscription is inap- 
propriate (e.g., Qiu et al. 1999, 2000; Zanis et al. 2002, 
2003; Soltis et al. 2007c, 2011; Li et al. 2011; Chapter 3). 
In early studies, the clade of Magnoliales, Laurales, 
Piperales, and Canellales did not receive jackknife support 
above 50% in three-gene analyses (P. Soltis et al. 1999a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000), but with the addition of more genes, 
bootstrap support for this clade increased to 67% (Qiu 
et al. 1999; 5 genes) and to 100% in a compartmentalized 
analysis of six genes (Zanis et al. 2003). With a 104-taxon 
dataset of 5 to as many as 11 genes (up to 15,000 bp of 
sequence data per taxon), support for the magnoliid clade 
was 78% (Zanis et al. 2002). With larger datasets (rang- 
ing from 17 genes to phylogenomic datasets of nuclear and 
plastid genes), maximal support has been obtained for this 
clade (Soltis et al. 2011; Moore et al. 2010; Li et al. 2011; 
Ruhfel et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 2014). Thus, the term 
“magnoliids” (Magnoliidae of Cantino et al. 2007) is cur- 
rently restricted to denote the clade of Magnoliales, Laura- 
les, Canellales, and Piperales (Fig. 5.1). 
After the monocots, the magnoliids contain the largest 
number of non-eudicot genera and species. Some of the fam- 
ilies of magnoliids are large, such as Annonaceae (120 gen- 
era, 2,000 species), Lauraceae (32 genera, 2,500 species), 
Piperaceae (5 genera, 2,000 species), and Myristicaceae 
(16 genera, 380 species). The well-known Magnoliaceae 
comprise over 200 species. 
There are several possible non-DNA synapomorphies 
for the magnoliids (Nandi et al. 1998; Judd et al. 2002, 
2008), although more survey work is needed to establish the 
full extent of the occurrence of these characters. Likely syn- 
apomorphies of the magnoliids include the phenylpropane 
compound asarone, the lignans galbacin and veraguensin, 
and the neolignan licarin (Hegnauer 1962-1994). In addi- 
tion, sieve-tube plastids of the P-type are present in most of 
these families (Behnke 1988a), and all but Piperales share 
stratified phloem with wedge-shaped phloem rays (Nandi 
et al. 1998). 
The magnoliids comprise two well-supported 
sister 
groups, Magnoliales + Laurales and Canellales + Piperales. 
Although some cladistic analyses of morphological char- 
acters (e.g., Doyle and Endress 2000) recovered the same 
Magnoliales, Laurales, Canellales, and Piperales clades, 
that study resulted in different relationships among these 
four clades. Doyle and Endress (2000) found that Magnoli- 
ales + Canellales were sister to Laurales, and Piperales were 
more distantly related, falling in a large polytomy with 
monocots, Nymphaeaceae, and several clades of eudicots; 
none of these non-DNA relationships received bootstrap 
support above 50%. However, later analyses that incor- 
porated DNA data along with morphology (Endress and 
Doyle 2009; Doyle and Endress 2010) recovered the topol-

Non-DNA synapomorphies for the two subclades of

magnoliids, Magnoliales + Laurales and Canellales + Pipe- 
morphology-based classifications. Winteraceae were con- 
rales, respectively, are still unclear, although the presence of

aporphine alkaloids may be synapomorphic for the latter

cussed below. Representatives of the families of these four 
orders are depicted in Figures 5.2 and 5.3. 
MAGNOLIALES 
Magnoliales comprise Myristicaceae, Degeneriaceae, Hi- 
mantandraceae, Magnoliaceae, Eupomatiaceae, and An- 
nonaceae (Figs. 5.1, 5.2), and the same Magnoliales clade 
was indicated in a phylogenetic analysis of non-DNA char- 
acters (Doyle and Endress 2000). Many of these families 
have generally been considered closely related (e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1997). Cronquist’s 
(1981) Magnoliales represented a diverse assemblage, con- 
sisting of these six families, plus Winteraceae, Canellaceae, 
and Lactoridaceae. Winteraceae and Canellaceae are now 
placed in Canellales (see below), and Lactoridaceae are in 
Piperales; the remaining families constitute Magnoliales 
as currently recognized (APG 1998; APG II 2003; APG III 
2009; APG IV 2016). Takhtajan placed only Degeneria- 
ceae, Himantandraceae, and Magnoliaceae in his concept 
of Magnoliales. On the basis of morphological attributes, 
some families of Magnoliales (e.g., Magnoliaceae, Dege- 
neriaceae, and Himantandraceae) had been considered 
to be “among the most archaic living angiosperms” (e.g., 
Cronquist 1968, 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1969, 1991, 1997). 
However, recent topologies have revealed that these fami- 
lies are nested higher within the angiosperm tree (Fig. 5.1). 
Members of Magnoliales are united by a few non- 
DNA putative synapomorphies—that is, stratified phloem, 
2-ranked leaves, and ruminate endosperm. Other notewor- 
thy characters include reduced fiber pit borders, an adaxial 
plate of vascular tissue in the petiole, palisade parenchyma, 
asterosclereids in the leaf mesophyll, and continuous tec- 
tum in the pollen (Doyle and Endress 2000). 
DNA-based topologies with extensive sampling placed 
Mpyristicaceae as sister to the remaining members of Mag- 
noliales (Sauquet et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2006). This posi- 
tion of Myristicaceae is also moderately supported by sev- 
eral non-DNA characters (Doyle and Endress 2000). Other 
DNA-based analyses have recovered alternative placements 
of Myristicaceae, although generally with lower support 
(e.g., Hilu et al. 2003; Qiu et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Both sister groups (Annonaceae + Eupomatiaceae) and 
(Degeneriaceae + Himantandraceae) are well supported 
(D. Soltis et al. 2000; P. Soltis et al. 2000; Doyle and En- 
dress 2000; see also Sauquet et al. 2003; Miiller et al. 2006; 
Massoni et al. 2014), but the phylogenetic placement of 
Magnoliaceae remains somewhat unclear (Massoni et al. 
2014). Alternative moderately supported relationships of 
Magnoliaceae within Magnoliales have been proposed in 
various analyses, all with good taxon sampling (e.g., Hilu 
et al. 2003; Qiu et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Magnoliaceae, Annonaceae, and Myristicaceae have also 
been the focus of more detailed phylogenetic analyses (e.g., 
Doyle and Le Thomas 1997; J. A. Doyle et al. 2000, 2004; 
Kim et al. 2001; Sauquet et al. 2003; Mols et al. 2004; 
Richardson et al. 2004). See also Kim and Suh (2013) for a 
recent update for Magnoliaceae, and Chatrou et al. (2012) 
and Pirie and Doyle (2012) for Annonaceae. 
The fossil record of Magnoliales includes members of 
Magnoliaceae, Myristicaceae, and Annonaceae 
(Supple- 
mentary Table 5.1, at press.uchicago.edu/sites/soltis/). The 
Liriophyllum-Archaeanthus plant (Dilcher and Crane 1984) 
from the late Albian of Kansas was reconstructed from sev- 
eral different isolated organs that were found together at 
the same localities and are dotted with resin dots believed 
to represent the hardened contents of ethereal oil cells. The 
Liriophyllum leaves have a prominent distal notch similar 
to the leaves of extant Liriodendron, but are distinguished 
in the primary venation pattern. Archaeanthus flowers show 
an arrangement of floral parts similar to Magnoliales, but 
the carpels bore multiple rather than single ovules. Seeds 
and multifollicles clearly corresponding to extant Magnolia 
are known by the middle Eocene (Manchester 1994b). The 
fossil record of Annonaceae extends back to the late Creta- 
ceous based on a flower from the Coniacian of Japan (Taka- 
. 
hashi et al. 2008), and a seed cast showing the distinctive 
pattern of ruminate endosperm is known from the Maas- 
trichtian of Nigeria (Chesters 1955). Seeds preserved in this 
way, usually placed in the highly inclusive genus Anona- 
spermum, are common in the Paleogene (Friis et al. 2011). 
LAURALES 
Laurales (Figs. 5.1, 5.3) consist of Calycanthaceae (includ- 
ing Idiospermaceae), Monimiaceae, Gomortegaceae, Athe- 
rospermataceae, Lauraceae, Siparunaceae, and Hernandia- 
ceae. Circumscription of Laurales has varied greatly among 
recent morphology-based classifications 
(e.g., Cronquist 
1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1997; reviewed in Renner 
2001). Cronquist (1981, 1988) placed Amborellaceae and 
Trimeniaceae in his Laurales together with Monimiaceae, 
Gomortegaceae, Calycanthaceae, Idiospermaceae, Laura- 
ceae, and Hernandiaceae. Amborella and Trimenia were 
placed in Monimiaceae 
in earlier works 
(e.g., Perkins 
1925). Others have placed Chloranthaceae in Laurales 
(e.g., Thorne 1974; Takhtajan 1987, 1997). 
The best putative synapomorphy for the seven families 
of Laurales is a perigynous flower—that is, with a concave 
to cup-shaped or urn-shaped receptacle (hypanthium) in

ane 
which the gynoecium is usually deeply embedded (En- 
dress and Igersheim 1997; Renner 1999). This receptacle 
sometimes becomes woody in fruit (e.g., Calycanthaceae). 
Other putative synapomorphies are the unilacunar nodes 
and opposite and decussate leaves. Several other non-DNA 
characters that unite the clade are the presence of inner 
staminodia, ascendant ovules, tracheidal endotesta (Doyle 
and Endress 2000), and a carpel that is intermediate be- 
tween ascidiate and plicate. Additionally, most members of 
Laurales (i.e., all but Calycanthaceae) are united by the ad- 
ditional apomorphies of anthers opening by 1, 2, or 4 flaps, 
and associated with a pair of glands (of staminodial origin, 
producing nectar or odor); inaperturate, often spinulose 
pollen, with a more-or-less reduced exine; and carpels with 
only a single median ovule. Other morphological charac- 
ters (e.g., uniaperturate pollen) that were considered to 
typify Laurales as previously circumscribed not only vary 
within Laurales as considered here but are also found in 
other basal angiosperm lineages. 
Phylogenetic analyses of Laurales were provided by 
Renner (1999) and Chanderbali et al. (2001), who used se- 
quences from multiple DNA regions. Within Laurales, the 
deepest split is between Calycanthaceae and the remaining 
six families, which in turn form two clades (Fig. 5.1): (1) Si- 
parunaceae, which are sister to Atherospermataceae + Go- 
mortegaceae; and (2) Hernandiaceae sister to Monimiaceae 
+ Lauraceae. Resolution within the Monimiaceae, Laura- 
ceae, Hernandiaceae clade has been difficult using DNA. 
Based on morphology there is actually support for Her- 
nandiaceae + Lauraceae. For example, these two families 
share reduction to a single carpel whereas Monimiaceae 
have retained the ancestral condition of numerous separate 
carpels. We have depicted the accepted molecular topology 
in Figure 5.1. 
Monimiaceae 
as traditionally recognized are clearly 
polyphyletic. Phylogenetic studies indicate that Atherosper- 
mataceae and Siparunaceae (then considered subfamilies 
within Monimiaceae, but see Schodde 1970) must be recog- 
nized as distinct families. Several morphological character- 
state changes are congruent with the molecular tree (Renner 
1999). Calycanthaceae have disulculate tectate-columellate 
pollen, whereas their sister clade has inaperturate, thin- 
exined pollen (with the exception of Atherospermataceae, 
which have columellate, but meridianosulcate or disulcate 
pollen). Calycanthaceae also have two ovules, whereas the 
remaining Laurales have a solitary ovule in each carpel. 
Monimiaceae, Lauraceae, and Hernandiaceae have apical 
ovules, whereas the ancestor of the clade of Siparunaceae 
and Atherospermataceae + Gomortegaceae is inferred to 
have had basal ovules, a condition lost in Gomortega, the 
only lauralean genus with a syncarpous ovary. Lauraceae 
and Hernandiaceae share flowers with a single carpel. 
Magnoliids and Chloranthales 
89 
Depending on the correct placement of Calycanthaceae- 
like fossil flowers, tetrasporangiate anthers with valvate 
dehiscence (with the valves laterally hinged) may be ances- 
tral in Laurales and lost in most modern Calycanthaceae 
(but present in Sinocalycanthus, Staedler et al. 2007) and 
most Monimiaceae (but present in Peumus; Endress and 
Hufford 1989). 
Recent updates on the phylogeny of Laurales include 
Soltis et al. (2011) and Massoni et al. (2014). Recent phy- 
logenetic trees for the families of the order have been pub- 
lished by Li et al. (2004) (Calycanthaceae) and Rohwer and 
Rudolph (2005) (Hernandiaceae). See also Renner (2004, 
2010), Doyle and Endress (2010), and Massoni et al. 
(2014). 
Fossils of Laurales include numerous examples of Lau- 
raceae plus a few of Calycanthaceae and Hernandiaceae. 
Lauraceae have a particularly rich record recognized by 
their flowers, leaves, fruits, and wood, but their pollen is 
rarely preserved (Supplementary Table 5.1). 
PIPERALES 
Piperales consist of Aristolochiaceae, Lactoridaceae, Piper- 
aceae, Saururaceae, and Hydnoraceae 
(Figs. 5.1, 5.3). 
Molecular analyses have provided strong support for the 
monophyly of Piperales (e.g., Qiu et al. 1999; P. Soltis 
et al. 1999a; Barkman et al. 2000; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 
2011; Zanis et al. 2002, 2003). Molecular analyses also 
place Hydnoraceae, a family of parasitic plants (see Chap- 
ter 11), within Piperales, apparently close to Aristolochia- 
ceae (Nickrent and Duff 1996; Nickrent et al. 1998, 2002). 
Phylogenetic analyses of morphological characters likewise 
recognized a clade of Piperaceae, Saururaceae, Aristolochi- 
aceae, and Lactoridaceae (Doyle and Endress 2000); Hyd- 
noraceae were not included in that analysis. 
The circumscription of Piperales has varied. Saururaceae 
and Piperaceae have consistently been considered closely 
related (Cronquist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1997). 
However, the relationships of Aristolochiaceae, Lactorida- 
ceae, and Hydnoraceae have been problematic. Cronquist 
(1981, 1988) placed Lactoridaceae in Magnoliales close to 
Magnoliaceae (see also Lammers et al. 1986) and put Aris- 
tolochiaceae in their own order; he also added Chloran- 
thaceae to Piperales. Some have suggested a close relation- 
ship of Lactoridaceae and Piperaceae (Weberling 1970; 
Carlquist 1990) and of Aristolochiaceae to Annonaceae 
(e.g., Dahlgren 1980; Thorne 1992a,b; Takhtajan 1997). 
Whereas Takhtajan (1987, 1997) considered Hydnoraceae 
to be closely related to Aristolochiaceae, others (e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981; Heywood 1998) placed Hydnoraceae in their 
Rosidae. 

90 Chapter 5 
The monophyly of Piperales is supported by leaves that 
are often cordate, with palmate to pinnate venation and 
widely spaced vascular bundles, in one, two, or several con- 
centric rings, to + scattered, or at least wood with broad 
rays. Other possible synapomorphies include sympodial 
growth, distichous phyllotaxis, and possibly a single pro- 
phyll. Piperaceae and Saururaceae form a well-supported 
clade (Fig. 5.1). Lactoris is closely related to Aristolochia- 
ceae. In early DNA analyses, Lactoris appeared within Aris- 
tolochiaceae, as sister to Aristolochia + Thottea (Qiu et al. 
1999; Zanis et al. 2003) or Aristolochia alone (D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Thottea was not included), but support for a 
placement of Lactoris within Aristolochiaceae was weak in 
those studies, even with five genes. 
The close relationship of Lactoridaceae to Aristolochia- 
ceae is often considered a “surprise” result of molecular 
phylogenetics, given what appear to be major gross mor- 
phological differences between the two families. However, 
morphological similarities between Aristolochiaceae and 
Lactoris include strongly extrorse anthers with broad con- 
nective, almost sessile anthers, and stamens basally fused 
with the gynoecium (Endress 1994c). Gonzalez and Rudall 
(2001) examined branching pattern, inflorescence mor- 
phology, and stipule development in Lactoris and other 
Piperales. They determined that whereas sympodial growth 
and a sheathing leaf base are present in all Piperales, the 
presence of stipules is confined to Lactoris, Saururaceae, 
and some Piperaceae. These characters are consistent with 
the placement of Lactoris within Piperales. In morphology- 
based cladistic analyses, Lactoris appears with Piperaceae 
+ Saururaceae in some most-parsimonious trees and with 
Aristolochiaceae in others (Doyle and Endress 2000). 
Given the uncertain position of Lactoris in both mo- 
lecular and morphological trees, APG (1998) and APG II 
(2003) recommended that Lactoridaceae be retained un- 
til more convincing evidence of its placement is obtained. 
More recently, however, Jaramillo et al. (2004), Wanke et al. 
(2007), and Massoni et al. (2014) increased the sampling of 
both genes and taxa and provided improved resolution of 
phylogenetic relationships within Magnoliidae in general 
and Piperales in particular. Their analyses place Lactoris 
as sister to Aristolochioideae and also show Hydnoraceae 
nested within Aristolochiaceae. Based on these results, both 
Lactoridaceae and Hydnoraceae are no longer treated as 
distinct families but are included in Aristolochiaceae (see 
APG IV 2016 and Chapter 12). 
The most recent phylogenetic updates of Aristolochia- 
ceae are those of Kelly and Gonzalez (2003) and Neinhuis 
et al. (2005); see also Jaramillo et al. (2004), Wanke et al. 
(2007), and Massoni et al. (2014) for recent phylogenetic 
analyses of Piperales. 
CANELLALES 
A sister-group relationship of Canellaceae + Winteraceae 
received bootstrap or jackknife support of 99 or 100% 
in all multigene analyses (e.g., Qiu et al. 1999; P. Soltis 
et al. 1999a; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2002, 2003) 
(Figs. 5.1, 5.3); Doyle and Endress’s (2000) morphologi- 
cal analysis also found this sister group (bootstrap support 
<50%). However, morphology-based classifications gener- 
ally considered Winteraceae closely related to Magnolia- 
ceae (e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; Heywood 1993). Canel- 
laceae, in contrast, were often placed near Myristicaceae 
(e.g., Wilson 1966; Cronquist 1981, 1988). Takhtajan 
(1997) placed Canellaceae and Winteraceae in separate or- 
ders, noting similarities of Canellaceae to both Winteraceae 
and Illiciaceae. Canellaceae + Winteraceae was initially re- 
ferred to as Winterales (e.g., Qiu et al. 1999; Doyle and En- 
dress 2000; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2002). How- 
ever, the name “Canellales” is older than “Winterales,” and 
the former name has been used in APG III (2009) and APG 
IV (2016; see Chapter 12). 
The phylogenetic position of Winteraceae within the 
magnoliid clade, well removed from the base of the angio- 
sperms, is noteworthy in that some classifications have con- 
sidered the family to be perhaps the “most archaic” living 
| 
family of angiosperms (Cronquist 1981; see also Endress 
1986b). Winteraceae have also been of interest because of 
their vesselless xylem and (in some taxa) plicate carpels. 
The phylogenetic position of Winteraceae indicates, how- 
ever, that these features are apparently secondarily derived 
(Young 1981; Doyle 2000). 
Putative synapomorphies of Canellales include branched 
sclereids, a nearly glabrous surface, a well-differentiated 
perianth of calyx and corolla (unusual in non-eudicots), 
well-differentiated pollen tube transmitting tissue, an outer 
integument with only two to four cell layers, and seeds with 
a palisade exotesta (Doyle and Endress 2000). Winteraceae 
and Canellaceae share a similar irregular, “first-rank” leaf 
venation (Hickey and Wolfe 1975; see also Doyle 2000) 
and similar stelar and nodal anatomies (Keating 2000). 
Vascularization of the seeds in Winteraceae also indicates 
a close relationship to Canellaceae (Deroin 2000). Phylo- 
genetic studies using morphology (Vink 1988, 1993) indi- 
cated that Takhtajania, a genus until recently thought to 
be extinct in nature, was sister to all other Winteraceae. 
With the rediscovery of Takhtajania (Schatz 2000), mate- 
rial became available for molecular phylogenetic and other 
analyses, and the placement of Takhtajania as sister to 
other Winteraceae was confirmed by DNA sequence data 
(Karol et al. 2000). An issue of the Annals of the Missouri 

7 
Botanical Garden (2000;87[3]:297-432) was dedicated 
to an overview of Takhtajania, including discussion of its 
rediscovery and relationships. The issue contained papers 
discussing the morphology, anatomy, palynology, cytol- 
ogy, and ecology of both Canellaceae and Winteraceae 
(Carlquist 2000a; Doust 2000; Doyle 2000; Endress et al. 
2000b; Feild et al. 2000b; Karol et al. 2000; Sampson 
2000; Tobe and Sampson 2000). 
Recent phylogenetic analyses of Canellales include Mar- 
quinez et al. (2009), Salazar and Nixon (2008), Massoni 
et al. (2014), and Miiller et al. (2015). Miiller et al. (2015) 
suggest that both vicariance and long-distance dispersal 
from the Old to New World have played important roles 
in the evolutionary history of this clade. Although fossil 
occurrences of Canellales are rare, the group can be traced 
to the Early Cretaceous (Late Barremian—Early Aptian) 
based on pollen tetrads distinctive for Winteraceae from 
the Gabon and Israel (Doyle et al. 1990). 
Magnoliids and Chloranthales 
91 
CHLORANTHALES 
Chloranthales comprise Chloranthaceae, with four genera: 
Ascarina, Chloranthus, Hedyosmum, and Sarcandra. The 
position of Chloranthaceae (Fig. 5.4) has long been prob- 
lematic. Takhtajan (1987, 1997) placed the family in its 
own order and suggested a close relationship with Trime- 
niaceae and Piperales. Others have also suggested a close 
relationship of Chloranthaceae and Trimeniaceae (Endress 
1986b, 1987c; Thorne 2001). Cronquist (1981) placed 
Chloranthaceae in his Piperales. Taylor and Hickey (1992, 
1996b), Doyle et al. (1994), and Hickey and Taylor (1996) 
focused attention on Chloranthaceae as the possible sister 
group to all other extant angiosperms. 
Even with recent multigene analyses, the placement of 
Chloranthaceae remains uncertain (e.g., Moore et al. 2011; 
Soltis et al. 2011; N. Zhang et al. 2012; Ruhfel et al. 2014; 
Figure 5.4.

with young infructescence (fruits immature) on the right side and male inflorescences on the left side (one anthetic and two preanthetic). 

92 Chapter 5 
Wickett et al. 2014). Large plastid datasets and datasets 
dominated by plastid genes favor a sister-group relationship 
of Chloranthaceae with magnoliids with strong bootstrap 
support (Soltis et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014). However, a 
recent analysis of conserved nuclear genes places Chloran- 
thaceae sister to Ceratophyllaceae (Chapter 3); this clade 
is then sister to eudicots (N. Zeng et al. 2014) (Fig. 3.6). 
More large datasets of nuclear genes having broad taxon 
coverage are needed to evaluate this placement further. 
Phylogenetic analyses of non-DNA characters indicated 
that Chloranthaceae occupy an isolated position as an 
early-diverging lineage (e.g., Nixon et al. 1994; Nandi et al. 
1998; Doyle and Endress 2000). Phylogenetic analysis of 
non-DNA plus DNA characters (Doyle and Endress 2000) 
placed Chloranthaceae “above” Austrobaileyales as sister 
to all remaining angiosperms. 
Burger (1977) proposed that Chloranthaceae may be 
closely involved in the origin of the monocots. Based on 
topologies recovered in recent years (see Fig. 5.1), how- 
ever, this scenario would seem unlikely. In addition, several 
morphological features are shared by Chloranthaceae and 
Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Austrobaileyales, in- 
cluding ascidiate carpels, unilacunar nodal anatomy, and 
chloranthoid leaf teeth, many of which likely represent 
symplesiomorphies in these groups. 
Some of the earliest known fossil angiosperm material 
is similar to modern Chloranthaceae, including mesofossils 
as well as dispersed pollen (e.g., Doyle 1969; Walker and 
Walker 1984; Friis et al. 1986, 1994b, 2011; Crane et al. 
1995; Brenner 1996), in agreement with phylogenetic infer- 
ences that point to the antiquity of the lineage. 
DNA analyses have clarified relationships among the 
four extant genera of Chloranthaceae (Zhang and Renner 
2003; Eklund et al. 2004). Kong et al. (2002a) studied re- 
lationships and character evolution in Chloranthus. Oth- 
ers have examined floral evolution and integrated fossils of 
Chloranthaceae into datasets and topologies of extant taxa 
(Doyle et al. 2003; Eklund et al. 2004). Available data indi- 
cate that whereas Chloranthaceae represent an old lineage, 
the extant taxa represent a much more recent diversifica- 
tion, a theme that has been observed in other “old” lin- 
eages, including cycads (see Chapter 1) and Nymphaeaceae 
(Yoo et al. 2005; see Chapter 3). 
Stamen morphology is highly variable within Chloran- 
thaceae. Sarcandra and Ascarina have “normal” stamens 
with two pairs of microsporangia (Fig. 5.5), but most spe- 
cies of Chloranthus have stamens that are three-lobed with 
four thecae (Fig. 5.5). It has been controversial whether the 
stamens of Chloranthus represent a single stamen with four 
pairs of sporangia or three independent stamens that have 
become fused at the base (reviewed in Kong et al. 2002a; 
Doyle et al. 2003). On the basis of fossil evidence, most 
researchers have favored the latter hypothesis (e.g., Crane 
et al. 1989; Herendeen et al. 1993; Eklund et al. 1997); 
but Endress (1987c) considered the structure to repre- 
_ 
sent a single tripartite stamen. Phylogenetic studies of ex- 
tant Chloranthus (Kong et al. 2002a), as well as analysis 
of floral organogenesis of extant Chloranthus sessilifolius 
Figure 5.5. 
Hypothesis of Endress (1987c) for the origin of the unusual tripartite androecium present in Chloranthus (Chloranthaceae). Molecular and developmen- 
tal data support this hypothesis (see text). 

(Kong et al. 2002b), a species with a tripartite androecium, 
have provided support for Endress’s (1987c) hypothesis 
(Fig. 5.5). 
Q. Zhang et al. (2011) and Doyle and Endress (2014) 
provide recent phylogenetic analyses of Chloranthaceae. 
Doyle and Endress (2014) examined Cretaceous fossils of 
Chloranthaceae and confirmed the early diversity of the 
Magnoliids and Chloranthales 
93 
family in a phylogenetic analysis of living and fossil taxa. 
Furthermore, their examination of the fossil record eluci- 
dated floral evolution indicating that a shift to unisexual 
flowers preceded the loss of the perianth in this clade (note 
that some extant Chloranthaceae still have a perianth—the 
carpellate flowers of Hedyosmum). 

Character Evolution 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
INTRODUCTION 
The well-supported framework of angiosperm relation- 
ships now available affords the opportunity to reconstruct 
ancestral character states for extant angiosperms and to in- 
vestigate character evolution throughout the angiosperms 
as a whole. In this chapter, having just reviewed current 
hypotheses of phylogeny for the ANA grade and magnoli- 
ids, we focus on character evolution across these lineages 
to elucidate the morphological and anatomical features of 
early angiosperms. Our reconstructions include monocots 
and eudicots, but patterns of evolutionary change in these 
clades will be described in later chapters that focus on these 
groups. 
Attempts to examine character evolution across the an- 
giosperms for key features (e.g., merism = merosity, sym- 
metry, and other floral characters; genome size) appeared 
soon after the first multi-gene analyses solidified the angio- 
sperm backbone tree (e.g., Ronse De Craene et al. 2003; 
Soltis et al. 2005b; Doyle 2009). Since those reconstruc- 
tions were published, the framework tree has been further 
resolved (see Chapter 3); we base our primary reconstruc- 
tions on these recent trees (e.g., Moore et al. 2010; Soltis 
et al. 2011) with the caveat that some recent analyses have 
recovered slightly different topologies (Chapter 3). 
There are several important caveats in these ancestral 
state reconstructions. The sister group of the angiosperms 
is unknown (other than “all extant gymnosperms” in 
molecular-based trees; when fossils are considered this is 
even more of a problem), which compromises efforts to 
infer ancestral angiosperm states. Furthermore, many char- 
acters of interest are confined to the angiosperms and can- 
not be scored in the outgroup. For example, extant gymno- 
sperms lack a perianth. If the outgroup of the angiosperms 
is coded as having an indeterminate number of perianth 
parts, then an indeterminate number is also ancestral for 
the angiosperms. Alternatively, if the outgroup for the an- 
giosperms is considered to lack a perianth, then it is equally 
parsimonious for the ancestral state of the angiosperms to 
be either trimerous or indeterminate in perianth merism 
(see Zanis et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005b). 
Alternative methods of character-state reconstruction 
that do not rely on outgroup coding, such as maximum like- 
lihood (ML) (e.g., Pagel 1998, 1999), may be more useful 
for inferring patterns of character evolution in the earliest 
angiosperm lineages. In contrast to our earlier reconstruc- 
tions and those of others (e.g., Doyle and Endress 2000; 
Endress and Doyle 2009), which relied solely on maximum 
parsimony (MP), we have employed maximum likelihood 
(ML) methods here. In the reconstructions for this book, 
we used Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison 2011, 2015), 
for both MP analyses with all most parsimonious states 
and ML optimizations. In figures depicting reconstructions, 
MP = maximum parsimony reconstruction; ML = maxi- 
mum likelihood reconstruction. For maximum likelihood 
reconstructions, the Mk model was employed. 
There are other limitations to reconstructing patterns of 
character evolution. Extant basal angiosperms (e.g., Ambo- 
rella and Nymphaeales) are almost certainly not the earliest 
angiosperm lineages and may not even represent or resem- 
ble the products of the earliest diversification events. The 
likelihood of extinction of many basal angiosperm lineages 
(e.g., Friis et al. 2000, 2011), with some intercalated among 
the extant crown, also compromises the accuracy of any 

tl 
character-state optimizations, as does the paucity of well- 
placed fossils of early angiosperms. We are reconstructing 
the character states of the common ancestor of all extant 
angiosperms, not necessarily those of the first angiosperms. 
We therefore often state that our reconstructions suggest 
that “early angiosperms” possessed a certain feature based 
on Our reconstructions. 
With these limitations, we focus primarily on charac- 
ters that are among those often discussed as critical for 
understanding the morphology and anatomy of the earli- 
est angiosperms and their subsequent diversification. These 
include habit, the presence of vessel elements, and diverse 
aspects of floral morphology, including perianth and sta- 
men phyllotaxis, perianth merism, perianth differentiation, 
stamen form, carpel form and sealing, and endosperm char- 
acters. We have updated the character matrix from Soltis 
et al. (2005b) when new data were available. As noted, 
the tree topology has been updated to correspond to Soltis 
et al. (2011) (Fig. 3.6; 6.1). In addition, Trithuria (Hydatel- 
laceae) has been added. 
Many authors have reconstructed the evolution of di- 
verse floral characters or reviewed patterns of character 
evolution (e.g., Albert et al. 1998; Doyle and Endress 2000, 
2010; Ronse De Craene et al. 2003; Zanis et al. 2003; 
Ronse De Craene 2007, 2008, 2013; Doyle 2008, 2012; 
Endress and Doyle 2009; Soltis et al. 2005b). However, the 
topologies used in earlier studies varied, and many of the 
trees used deviated significantly from what the commu- 
nity now accepts as the framework of angiosperm phylog- 
eny (e.g., Stevens 2001 onwards; http://www.mobot.org/ 
MOBOT/research/APweb/; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; 
Soltis et al. 2011). Albert et al. (1998) used a topology 
with Ceratophyllum sister to all other angiosperms, reflect- 
ing the understanding of relationships at that time. Doyle 
and Endress (2000) standardly used a combined morphol- 
ogy plus three-gene dataset (D. Soltis et al. 2000). How- 
ever, critical taxa (e.g., Ceratophyllum) were omitted from 
Doyle and Endress (2000). Importantly, the topology they 
used differs substantially from our current understanding 
of relationships. Albert et al. (1998) and Doyle and Endress 
(2000) used families as terminals, either exclusively, or in 
large part, rather than individual genera or species, making 
it difficult to assess patterns of variation for characters that 
are polymorphic within a family. In subsequent analyses 
(e.g., Endress and Doyle 2009), crucial taxa (e.g., Trithu- 
ria and Ceratophyllum) were added, families were replaced 
by exemplar species and genera, and the topology used 
was updated to reflect the currently accepted backbone 
tree. However, as in most studies, only MP was used for 
ancestral-state reconstruction. Nonetheless, Endress and 
Doyle (2009) remains an excellent overview of floral char- 
acter evolution, and we refer to those results here. 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
95 
Character-state reconstructions have benefited greatly 
from the recent clarifications of angiosperm relationships 
(see Chapter 3). Phylogenetic studies focused attention on 
Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales (the 
ANA grade) as subsequent sisters to the remaining extant 
angiosperms. As a result, a wealth of new data was ob- 
tained for these taxa, including important information on 
floral development (e.g., Endress and Igersheim 2000a,b; 
Endress 2001a; Posluszny and Tomlinson 2003; Buzgo 
et al. 2004a; Endress and Doyle 2007). To reflect these 
new data, authors have used different codings for several 
characters (e.g., merism, phyllotaxis) from those used ear- 
lier (e.g., Albert et al. 1998; P. Soltis et al. 2000; Ronse 
De Craene et al. 2003; Zanis et al. 2003). 
For our optimizations, we used either a 64-taxon or 
53-taxon tree and two alternative topologies. One topol- 
ogy follows recent summary trees for angiosperms (e.g., 
Moore et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011) (Fig. 3.6), in which 
after the ANA grade, Chloranthaceae + magnoliids are sis- 
ter to all other angiosperms (i.e., monocots plus [eudicots 
+ Ceratophyllum]). This is the topology we present here 
(for both 64-taxon and 53-taxon analyses). However, be- 
cause the sister group of Chloranthaceae + magnoliids has 
only moderate support (see Chapter 3), a second topology 
was used in which after the ANA grade, Chloranthaceae 
and then magnoliids are sister to all other angiosperms (re- 
constructions not shown). In addition, we conducted other 
analyses, with Amborella 
+ Nymphaeales as sister to all 
other angiosperms, although data strongly support Ambo- 
rella alone as sister to all other angiosperms (Chapter 3) 
(reconstructions not shown). Generally (as discussed be- 
low), these changes in topology had little impact on the 
major themes of character evolution discussed here. In 
another set of analyses, we added the fossil Archaefructus 
as sister to all other angiosperms, although some analyses 
have suggested that this is better placed in Nymphaeales 
(see Chapters 3 and 4). 
We typically used genera as terminals. For the 53-taxon 
analysis, families were sometimes used as terminals because 
few data were available for some characters. A list of ge- 
neric terminals, as well as the familial and ordinal designa- 
tions for each genus (sensu APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), is 
provided in Table 6.1. 
We used a reduced version of the underlying matrix as- 
sembled by Ronse De Craene et al. (2003) for the study 
of floral evolution, with the addition of taxa (e.g., Tri- 
thuria). Additional data are from Endress (2001a), Ru- 
dall et al. (2007), Endress and Doyle (2009), and the pri- 
mary sources cited therein. We present only some of our 
reconstructions here, but describe the robustness of the 
analyses to differences in topology or optimization (MP 
or ML).

HABIT 
The hypothesized habit (woody vs. herbaceous) of the 
earliest angiosperms has long been debated. Cronquist 
(1968, 1988), Takhtajan (1969), Stebbins (1974), Thorne 
(1976), and Loconte (1996) maintained that the ancestral 
angiosperms were likely woody. The logic for this hypoth- 
esis was sound—all gymnosperms are woody, so the first 
angiosperms were likely woody as well. Furthermore, the 
woody habit is prevalent in the extant angiosperms these 
workers considered to be archaic (e.g., Magnoliales as 
traditionally defined). In contrast, as reviewed earlier (see 
Chapters 2, 3, and 4), some phylogenetic studies and fossil 
data focused attention on a few herbaceous families (e.g., 
Chloranthaceae, Piperaceae, Nymphaeaceae) or the aquatic 
fossil Archaefructus, as possible sister groups to all other 
extant angiosperms; these results indicated the possibility 
of a herbaceous origin of angiosperms (e.g., Taylor and 
Hickey 1992, 1996a,b; Doyle et al. 1994; Sun et al. 2002; 
Goremykin et al. 2013; reviewed in Soltis et al. 2008b). 
Once phylogenetic trees became available for basal (and 
other) angiosperms, efforts were made to reconstruct the 
ancestral habit for angiosperms. As reviewed below, these 
efforts typically yield an unsatisfying conclusion—the an- 
cestral habit is difficult to infer unequivocally. 
Doyle and Endress (2000) reconstructed the evolution of 
habit using a summary tree then available and recognizing 
two states: (1) tree or shrub (woody) or (2) rhizomatous, 
scandent, or acaulescent (herbaceous). In their reconstruc- 
tions, the ancestral habit for angiosperms is equivocal, with 
the herbaceous habit established as ancestral for all angio- 
sperms except Amborella; the woody habit was derived in- 
dependently in magnoliids and eudicots. Doyle and Endress 
(2000) scored Chloranthus and Ascarina (Chloranthaceae) 
as herbaceous and Hedyosmum as polymorphic because 
the young stages of Hedyosmum have been considered rhi- 
zomatous and the mature plants woody (Blanc 1986; see 
also discussion in Endress and Doyle 2015). 
As in Soltis et al. (2005b), we found that the coding of 
Chloranthaceae for habit has a large effect on character- 
state reconstruction. If Hedyosmum is scored as poly- 
morphic for woody and herbaceous forms, or if all three 
representatives of Chloranthaceae (Chloranthus, Ascarina, 
Hedyosmum) are scored as polymorphic, then the ances- 
tral habit is equivocal with both MP and ML optimiza- 
tion (Fig. 6.1). However, if Hedyosmum is scored as woody, 
then the woody habit is reconstructed as ancestral for ex- 
tant angiosperms with MP and the woody condition is fa- 
vored as ancestral with ML (Fig. 6.2). This is also the case if 
a topology is used in which Nymphaeales are treated as sis- 
ter to Amborella (not shown). The sensitivity of our results 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
97 
to single changes in the data matrix is further illustrated by 
adding the fossil Archaefructus as sister to all extant angio- 
sperms. The ancestral state for angiosperms is then recon- 
structed as herbaceous with both MP and ML (not shown). 
Thus, it is possible to obtain either a woody or herbaceous 
ancestral state for angiosperms. However, if gymnosperm 
outgroups are added (all are woody) the ancestral state for 
angiosperms is woody with MP and ML. 
CHLORANTHOID LEAF TEETH 
Chloranthoid teeth (Fig. 6.3; Chapter 4) are present in 
Amborella (Bailey and Swamy 1948) and most Austro- 
baileyales (Kadsura, Schisandra, and Illicium [Schisand- 
raceae; Hickey and Wolfe 1975]; Trimenia [Trimeniaceae; 
Rodenburg 1971; Endress 1987c]). Both Trimenia and II- 
lictum were scored as polymorphic for presence/absence 
of chloranthoid teeth. Chloranthoid teeth are also present 
in Chloranthaceae, but are not found in Austrobaileya or 
Nymphaeales. 
Among basal eudicots, a similar tooth type is found in 
Trochodendraceae, Buxaceae, and some Ranunculales (Ber- 
beridaceae, Papaveraceae, Ranunculaceae, and Lardizabal- 
aceae). Doyle and Endress (2000) and Soltis et al. (2005b) 
scored the leaf teeth of these eudicots as homologous to the 
chloranthoid type; we followed that approach here (but see 
below). 
Doyle and Endress (2000) suggested that chloranthoid 
leaf teeth are ancestral in the angiosperms. However, our 
analyses indicate that the ancestral condition of extant an- 
giosperms is equivocal with both MP and ML (although 
ML favors the absence of chloranthoid teeth) (Fig. 6.4). 
This is the case even though Amborella has chloranthoid 
teeth as do some Austrobaileyales (see above). The ances- 
tor of Austrobaileyales is also reconstructed as ambiguous, 
regardless of whether I/licium and Trimenia are scored as 
polymorphic for this feature or as possessing chloranthoid 
teeth. After Amborella, the ancestral state for all other an- 
giosperms is the absence of chloranthoid leaf teeth (with 
both MP and ML). If a topology is used in which Ambo- 
rella and Nymphaeales are sisters, then the ancestral state 
for extant angiosperms is the absence of chloranthoid 
teeth. Regardless of topology, Chloranthaceae represent a 
separate origin of this tooth type. As noted, if chloranthoid 
teeth function to release root pressure (Feild et al. 2003a, 
2004), they would not be needed in aquatics and may have 
been lost. 
The reconstructions indicate multiple origins of chlo- 
ranthoid teeth (Fig. 6.4), although the exact number is un- 
clear. In addition to their presence in Amborella, Austro- 
baileyales, and Chloranthaceae, they appear to have arisen

100 Chapter 6 
multiple times in the eudicots: in the common ancestor 
of Papaveraceae, the ancestor of Berberidaceae and Ra- 
nunculaceae, and the ancestors of Trochodendraceae and 
Buxaceae. Given the apparent independent derivation of 
chloranthoid teeth in the eudicots, this character does not 
appear to be homologous to the chloranthoid teeth in Am- 
borellaceae, Austrobaileyales, and Chloranthaceae 
(and 
they may not be homologous in these latter groups either). 
Studies are needed to assess the homology of chloranthoid 
teeth in basal angiosperms and eudicots. 
ETHEREAL OILS 
Ethereal oils (Chapter 4) are prevalent in all Austrobailey- 
ales and all magnoliids and are present in Acorus, the sister 
to all other monocots (see Chapter 7). However, ethereal 
oil cells are not present in Amborella (Bailey and Swamy 
1948), Nymphaeales, 
or Ceratophyllaceae. Thus, even 
though early workers suggested that early angiosperms 
would have produced these oils (e.g., Cronquist 1988), pre- 
Figure 6.3. 
Chloranthoid teeth. Amborella, leaf 
photograph, showing leaf margin with chloranthoid 
teeth. Insert: drawing showing one chloranthoid 
gland (from Soltis et al. 2005). 
sumably as a defensive compound, the ancestral condition 
for angiosperms is reconstructed as the absence of ethereal 
oils with both MP and ML (Fig. 6.5). 
The ancestral states for mesangiosperms and mesan- 
giosperms + Austrobaileyales are equivocal. The absence 
of these oils in Nymphaeales and Ceratophyllaceae could 
easily be due to losses associated with the aquatic habit. 
Oil cells are reconstructed as ancestral for the ancestor 
of Chloranthaceae + magnoliids with both MP and ML 
(Fig. 6.5), and this feature represents a possible synapo- 
morphy for this clade. 
Oil cells also appear to have been present early in the 
fossil record; they are abundant, for example, on carpels, 
petals, and leaves of Archaeanthus (Dilcher and Crane 
1984), as expected for a member of Magnoliaceae. The 
ancestral state for the monocots is unclear because of the 
presence of these compounds in Acoraceae, while the com- 
pounds are absent in other early-branching monocots (but 
occur in Zingiberales; see Chapter 7). Regardless of opti- 
mization or topology, the ancestral state for eudicots is the 
absence of ethereal oils.

NODAL ANATOMY 
The nodal anatomy of angiosperms has long been of re- 
search interest (e.g., Canright 1955; Bailey 1956; Benzing 
1967; Cronquist 1968), although the adaptive significance 
of changes in nodal anatomy is uncertain. Branch systems 
in the stele in ferns, gymnosperms, and many angiosperms 
usually have two traces from a single gap. The most com- 
mon nodal types are one-trace unilacunar, two-trace unila- 
cunar, trilacunar, and multilacunar (Fig. 6.6). Bailey (1956) 
proposed that unilacunar nodes with two traces are ances- 
tral in the angiosperms. Cronquist (1968, 1988) suggested 
that either unilacunar nodes with two traces or perhaps 
trilacunar nodes were ancestral. In their reconstructions of 
nodal anatomy, Doyle and Endress (2000) provided sup- 
port for the former hypothesis—unilacunar nodes with two 
traces are ancestral. 
Analyses conducted for this book generally agree with 
those of Doyle and Endress (2000), but because of the dif- 
ferent topologies used, there are also differences. Further- 
more, Doyle and Endress (2000) scored Amborellaceae as 
having unilacunar nodes with two traces, following Bailey 
(1956). However, Carlquist and Schneider (2001) indicated 
that Amborella has unilacunar nodes with one trace— 
Amborella may have both states. We therefore used mul- 
tiple scorings of Amborella. In one optimization, we scored 
Amborella as polymorphic, having unilacunar nodes with 
both one trace and two traces. We also compared alterna- 
tive reconstructions in which Amborella was coded as hav- 
ing unilacunar nodes with one trace vs. unilacunar nodes 
with two traces. 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the distinction 
between unilacunar nodes with one versus two traces, we 
conducted two reconstructions. In the first, we followed 
Doyle and Endress (2000) and recognized four states: uni- 
lacunar with one trace, unilacunar with two traces, trilacu- 
nar, and multilacunar. In the second, we combined one- and 
two-trace types into a single category, unilacunar (see also 
Dickison and Endress 1983), and considered three basic 
states: unilacunar, trilacunar, and multilacunar.

The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
103 
into a single character state (unilacunar) gives a much 
clearer picture of nodal anatomy evolution, unambigu- 
ously reconstructing the ancestral state of the angiosperms 
through the ANA grade as unilacunar (Fig. 6.7). The ances- 
tral state of the mesangiosperms is ambiguous; the ancestral 
state for Chloranthaceae is unilacunar. There are multiple 
origins of trilacunar nodal anatomy: ancestor of Canellales 
+ Piperales, some Magnoliales (independently in Myristica- 
ceae and Himantandraceae), Proteales, and Ranunculales, 
with other scattered origins (Fig. 6.7). These results con- 
trast with Doyle and Endress (2000), who used a topology 
that did not place Canellales (their Winterales) with Pipe- 
rales or Laurales with Magnoliales. Multilacunar nodal 
anatomy also evolved multiple times, including within the 
monocots and the ancestor of Piperaceae/Saururaceae. 
When two types of unilacunar nodes are considered, the 
ancestral state for angiosperms is less clear, as is the ances- 
tral condition for most major subclades (not shown). Uni- 
lacunar nodes with two traces are reconstructed as ances- 
tral when MP is used (but not ML), but only if Amborella is 
coded as polymorphic, possessing both one and two traces, 
or as having two traces. However, if Amborella is coded 
as having only nodes that are unilacunar with one trace, 
the ancestral state for the angiosperms becomes ambiguous 
(not shown). 
If Amborella is coded as polymorphic, possessing both 
one and two traces, or as having two traces, the ancestral 
state of all angiosperms except Amborella as well as all 
angiosperms except Amborella and Nymphaeales is also 
reconstructed with MP (but not ML) as unilacunar with 
two traces. Unilacunar nodes with two traces are present in 
some Nymphaeaceae (other members of the family have tri- 
lacunar nodes) and in Trimenia (Austrobaileyales; Marsden 
and Bailey 1955); other Austrobaileyales (Schisandra and II- 
licium) have unilacunar nodes with one trace; Austrobaileya 
is intermediate (see above) (Dickison and Endress 1983). 
Both sets of reconstructions indicate that nodal anat- 
omy may provide synapomorphies for some clades. Unila- 
cunar nodes unite Laurales when unilacunar one-trace and 
two-trace nodes (Fig. 6.7) are combined. When one- and 
two-trace nodes are scored separately, the ancestor of Lau- 
rales is reconstructed as having unilacunar nodes with two

VESSEL ELEMENTS 
We covered vessels in Chapter 4 (Fig. 4.4) and here provide 
a broader phylogenetic perspective. Several families lack 
vessels; Cronquist (1968, 1988), and Takhtajan (1969) sug- 
gested that some families lacking vessels (e.g., Winteraceae) 
might be primitively vesselless. However, a morphological 
cladistic analysis (Young 1981) showed that it was more 
parsimonious to have vessels present in the common ances- 
tor of the angiosperms and then lost several times in diverse 
taxa, including Amborella, Winteraceae, and Sarcandra 
(Chloranthaceae). Donoghue and Doyle (1989a) provided 
additional support for Young’s hypothesis of many losses 
of vessels. 
The discovery that Amborella, a vesselless angiosperm 
(see Chapters 3 and 4), is sister to all other extant angio- 
sperms has renewed interest about whether the angio- 
sperms were ancestrally vesselless. Adding to the intrigue is 
the discovery in some basal angiosperms of tracheary ele- 
ments that are intermediate between true vessels and tra- 
cheids (see Schneider et al. 1995; Schneider and Carlquist 
1996). A perforation plate (Fig. 4.4) is a feature of a vessel; 
it is considered to be one, or a series, of modified “pits” or 
perforations in the end wall of a water-conducting cell. Pit 
membranes are lacking in the perforations of a true ves- 
sel, but some taxa, such as Nymphaeaceae, have porose pit 
membranes in the end walls. Adding to the complexity is 
a combination of porose and nonporose pit membranes in 
Bubbia of Winteraceae (Carlquist 1983) and Amborella 
(Feild et al. 2000b; Carlquist and Schneider 2001). Due 
to this complexity, Doyle and Endress (2000) recognized 
an “intermediate” condition between true vessels and tra- 
cheids. They found that the vesselless condition is ancestral 
in angiosperms, with both Amborella and Nymphaeaceae 
lacking vessels in stems; vessels were also lost in Wintera- 
ceae. Vessels were previously thought to have been lost in 
Trochodendraceae, but recent studies reveal that vessels are 
present in this lineage (Chapter 8) (Li et al. 2011). 
Carlquist and Schneider (2002) proposed that defini- 
tions of vessels are overly simplistic. When all sources of 
data are considered, these authors found that changes in 
not one, but at least four and perhaps as many as six, char- 
acters can occur in the evolution of a vessel from a tracheid 
(see Table 4.1 and Fig 4.4). For four of these characters, 
delimiting the differences in character states is straightfor- 
ward. Two other differences between tracheids and vessels 
are relative and therefore cannot be easily coded. In vessel- 
bearing woods that also contain tracheids, vessel elements 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
105 
are shorter than the tracheids in any given sample, whereas 
in vesselless wood, lengths of the water-conducting ele- 
ments (tracheids only) in any given sample follow a uni- 
modal distribution. In addition, tracheids of vesselless 
woods are much longer than both the tracheids and vessel 
elements of vessel-bearing woods. 
Hence, “vessel” should not be treated as a single charac- 
ter with two states, presence or absence (some other char- 
acters may be similarly complex). Furthermore, adding a 
third state, intermediate, does not capture the complexity 
of the transition from tracheid to vessel. Unfortunately, ad- 
equate data are not available to map any of the characters 
that Carlquist and Schneider (2002) recognized as distin- 
guishing “vessels” from “tracheids.” Porosity, for example, 
can be measured only by SEM examination, and the num- 
ber of taxa examined for this feature is still small. 
Ecophysiological insights into the function of water- 
conducting cells in basal angiosperms also bear on the 
evolution of vessel elements. It is possible, perhaps prob- 
able, that the early angiosperms lacked vessels, because 
Amborella and Nymphaeaceae lack vessels and other early- 
diverging lineages such as Schisandraceae and Austrobai- 
leyaceae have what are regarded as “primitive” vessel types 
with tracheid-like features (Carlquist and Schneider 2002). 
In Austrobaileya, the vessels have gradually tapered end 
walls and numerous scalariform perforation plates and are 
generally small in diameter (Bailey and Swamy 1948; Carl- 
quist 2001a). Illicium and Kadsura have vessel elements 
with long, oblique perforation plates that partially retain 
pit membranes and hence are tracheid-like (Carlquist 1983; 
Carlquist and Schneider 2002). 
In summary, although it is difficult to define a “vessel” 
and it should not be treated as a single character with sev- 
eral states, basic analyses suggest that simple vessels are 
present in the common ancestor of Austrobaileyales + me- 
sangiosperms and that “typical” vessels originated in the 
common ancestor of mesangiosperms. This is one of sev- 
eral key features associated with the origin of mesangio- 
sperms (Chapter 3). 
PERIANTH PHYLLOTAXIS 
To explore the evolution of perianth phyllotaxis (Endress 
and Doyle 2007; Staedler and Endress 2009), we used 
both multistate and binary character codings. With bi- 
nary coding, we scored the perianth as spiral or whorled. 
With multistate coding, phyllotaxis was scored as absent 
(no perianth), a single whorl, two whorls, multiple whorls 
(more than two), and spiral. We also used a second multi- 
state coding in which we reduced the number of forms of 
whorled phyllotaxis (i.e., single whorl, two whorls, mul- 

106 Chapter 6 
tiple whorls) to a single character state—whorled. In this 
second multistate coding, phyllotaxis was scored as absent, 
spiral, or whorled. 
Amborella has spiral phyllotaxis, as do members of Aus- 
trobaileyales (Chapter 4; Endress and Igersheim 2000a). In 
some clades, phyllotaxis is complex and does not fit cleanly 
into any of the states specified for either multistate or bi- 
nary coding. For example, in Nymphaeaceae, phyllotaxis 
has often been considered to be spiral, but it now appears 
to be primarily whorled or in some cases irregular (Endress 
2001a). In Winteraceae, phyllotaxis is primarily whorled 
but occasionally spiral (Doust 2000). In Drimys wintert, 
flowers within one tree vary between spiral and whorled 
phyllotaxis (Doust 2001). In Hydatellaceae, inflorescence/ 
floral morphology has been hard to interpret (Rudall et al. 
2007), but as each flower has only a single organ (either a 
stamen or a carpel), phyllotaxis is not present. For other 
taxa, phyllotaxis has not been carefully examined, and crit- 
ical studies are still needed. In addition, the distinction be- 
tween spiral and whorled is not always clear. Ontogenetic 
studies have revealed that in some cases floral organs that 
appear to be whorled in mature flowers actually result from 
spiral initiation of primordia and the rhythmic occurrence 
of a long plastochron (the time interval between the initia- 
tion of two consecutive organs) after several short plasto- 
chrons (e.g., Tucker 1960; Huber 1980; Leins and Erbar 
1985; Endress 1994a). Thus, both spiral and whorled phyl- 
lotaxis might ultimately have organs developing in a spiral 
sequence (Endress 1987a,b). Illicium has spiral phyllotaxis 
of all floral organs; in mature flowers the carpels form a 
single series and thus simulate a whorl, but they still have 
spiral phyllotaxis (Fig. 4.17). 
We scored Ceratophyllum as lacking a perianth (Endress 
1994b, 2001a), although the whorl of scales that precedes 
the reproductive organs has been variously interpreted as 
perianth or bracts (Aboy 1936; Les 1988, 1993; Les et al. 
1991; Endress 1994b, 2001a; Albert et al. 1998). Most 
Chloranthaceae lack a perianth; however, the pistillate 
flowers of Hedyosmum have three structures variously in- 
terpreted as a perianth or as staminodes (Endress 1987c). 
We scored Hedyosmum as having an undifferentiated peri- 
anth. We interpreted Hydatellaceae flowers to be in com- 
pact aggregations (pseudanthia) that comprise unisexual 
flowers with no perianth, with each male flower consisting 
of a single stamen and each female flower a single carpel 
(Hamann 1975; Rudall et al. 2007). As noted, the inter- 
pretation of perianth phyllotaxis in Nymphaeaceae has 
been debated. Ronse De Craene et al. (2003) considered 
Brasenia and Cabomba to have whorled phyllotaxis and 
scored Nymphaea, Victoria, and Nuphar as polymorphic, 
with early organs appearing in a whorled arrangement. 
Zanis et al. (2003), in contrast, scored Nymphaea, Victo- 
ria, and Nupbhar as spiral. We followed Endress (2001a), 
who suggested that the phyllotaxis of Nymphaea, Victoria, 
and Nuphar is whorled and then becomes irregular, but not 
spiral. 
Spiral phyllotaxis is present in the ANA grade, includ- 
ing Amborella, Trimenia, Austrobaileya, and all Schisand- 
raceae (see Chapter 4). However, because of the whorled 
phyllotaxis 
of Nymphaeaceae 
and Cabombaceae, 
the 
ancestral reconstruction for perianth phyllotaxis for the 
angiosperms 
is not straightforward. Reconstruction of 
phyllotaxis with more than one whorled state (e.g., single 
whorl, two whorls, multiple whorls) often results in am- 
biguous character-state optimizations, and evolutionary 
inference is difficult. Most of our discussion below focuses 
on the results of reconstructions that involve three states— 
spiral, whorled, and absent (Fig. 6.8); for more detail on 
multistate reconstructions, see Albert et al. (1998), Ronse 
De Craene et al. (2003), Zanis et al. (2003), and Endress 
and Doyle (2009, 2015). 
In our analyses, the ancestral phyllotaxis for the angio- 
sperms is generally reconstructed as equivocal. For binary 
coding (not shown), the phyllotaxis of extant angiosperms 
was reconstructed as equivocal with both MP and ML (see 
also Ronse De Craene et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005b; En- 
dress and Doyle 2007, 2009; Doyle and Endress 2011). 
This is also the case using three states (spiral, whorled, and 
absent) with both ML and MP. Reconstructions with mul- 
tiple whorls coded (one, two, or three) again suggests an 
ambiguous ancestral state with MP, although ML favors 
a spiral perianth in the ancestor of extant angiosperms 
(Fig. 6.8). 
Using parsimony, Endress and Doyle (2009) also recon- 
structed the ancestral state as ambiguous. In P. Soltis et al. 
(2000) the ancestral condition for angiosperms was recon- 
structed as spiral because different codings for Nympha- 
eaceae were used. If Victoria, Nymphaea, and Nuphar were 
scored as having a spiral perianth, then a spiral perianth 
is reconstructed as ancestral throughout the ANA grade 
(e.g., P. Soltis et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2003). However, if 
the perianth phyllotaxis of these genera is considered to be 
primarily whorled (see Ronse De Craene and Smets 1993; 
Endress 2001a,b), which developmental data indicate is 
the case, then a whorled perianth is present throughout the 
family, and the ancestral phyllotaxis for angiosperms is re- 
constructed as equivocal (Fig. 6.8). The same ambiguous 
reconstruction for angiosperms is obtained if the perianth 
phyllotaxis of Nymphaeaceae is considered polymorphic 
rather than whorled. In summary, the ancestral state for 
phyllotaxis in the angiosperms is best considered equivocal 
(see also Endress and Doyle 2007). 
Following the ANA grade, whorled perianth phyllo- 
taxis is reconstructed as ancestral for the mesangiosperms

108 Chapter 6 
(see also Endress and Doyle 2009). This is the case with 
ML when binary coding is used and also with simple cod- 
ing (spiral, whorled, and absent) with both MP and ML 
(Fig. 6.8). Following the origin of a whorled perianth in me- 
sangiosperms, there are multiple shifts to a spiral perianth 
in various magnoliids, such as Calycanthaceae (Staedler 
et al. 2007), some Atherospermataceae (e.g., Daphnandra; 
not all members of the Atherospermataceae have a spiral 
perianth—Dryadodaphne has whorled phyllotaxis), Go- 
mortegaceae, some Monimiaceae (e.g., Hortonia; Endress 
1980a,b), Degeneriaceae (Degeneria), and Magnoliaceae 
(some species of Magnolia; Fig. 6.8). 
Another possible transformation from whorled to spi- 
ral phyllotaxis may have occurred in Drimys and Pseudo- 
wintera (Winteraceae), which have a labile phyllotaxis 
involving spirals and multiple whorls (Doust 2000, 2001; 
Endress et al. 2000b). Thus, perianth phyllotaxis is highly 
labile in the ANA grade and magnoliids, as has long been 
suggested (Endress 1987a,b, 1994a,c; Albert et al. 1998; 
Zanis et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005b; Endress and Doyle 
2009). In fact, studies of floral development indicate that 
some basal angiosperms are not fully committed to either 
spiral or whorled phyllotaxis (Buzgo et al. 2004). 
A perianth has also been lost frequently in non-eudicot 
and non-monocot angiosperms (Fig. 6.8). Reconstruction 
of phyllotaxis with more than one whorled state (e.g., sin- 
gle whorl, two whorls, multiple whorls) is noteworthy in 
showing that a perianth of a single whorl has likely evolved 
multiple times: in the ancestors of Aristolochiaceae, My- 
risticaceae, and Hernandiaceae, respectively, and in several 
basal eudicot lineages (e.g., Platanaceae + Proteaceae and 
Circaeasteraceae) (the eudicots are covered in more detail 
in Chapters 8 and 9). 
PERIANTH MERISM (MEROSITY) 
We coded perianth merism as dimerous, trimerous, tetram- 
erous, pentamerous, or indeterminate, the latter referring 
to a variable and typically large number of perianth parts. 
Data for merism were taken from Endress (2001a), Ronse 
De Craene et al. (2003), Zanis et al. (2003), and Rudall 
et al. (2007). The flowers of many basal angiosperms have 
multiple parts, whereas those of other clades are clearly 
trimerous in their basic floral plan. However, the coding of 
merism is sometimes problematic. In some Nymphaeaceae 
(e.g., Victoria and Nymphaea), many perianth parts are 
present, but the basic plan for these genera is trimerous or 
tetramerous (Endress 2001a). Other families are complex. 
In some Winteraceae, the outermost floral organs are in 
dimerous whorls in some genera, whereas others possess 
tetramerous, and even pentamerous, whorls (Endress et al. 
2000b). In Magnoliaceae, the perianth of some species of 
Magnolia is indeterminate, whereas that of Liriodendron 
and other Magnolias is in three trimerous whorls; Magno- 
liaceae may represent a transition from whorled to spiral 
phyllotaxis (Tucker 1960; Erbar and Leins 1981, 1983). 
More data are also needed. Only one species of Siparuna- 
ceae has been investigated (Siparuna nicaraguensis, now 
called S. thecaphora; Endress 1980a; Staedler and Endress 
2009). Staminate flowers have an undifferentiated perianth 
of four (or five) tepals and could be interpreted as dimerous. 
However, pistillate flowers have five or six tepals, and mer- 
ism is unclear. We did not include Siparunaceae in Fig. 6.9; 
however, Zanis et al. (2003) attempted reconstructions with 
Siparunaceae scored as either dimerous or uncertain. 
Amborella exhibits indeterminate merism (see Chap- 
ter 4). Other early-branching lineages also have indeter- 
minate merism, with Austrobaileyales uniformly indeter- 
minate. Trithuria (Hydatellaceae; Nymphaeales) has but a 
single stamen or carpel per flower (Hamann 1975; Rudall 
et al. 2007) and lacks a perianth. Within Nymphaeaceae 
and Cabombaceae, Cabomba, Brasenia, and Nuphar are 
trimerous; other genera (e.g., Victoria, Nymphaea) also ap- 
pear trimerous or tetramerous (see Chapter 4; Fig. 4.11; see 
Endress 2001a). Hence, trimery appears to be ancestral for 
Nymphaeaceae + Cabombaceae. Importantly, these results 
also illustrate that trimery arose early in angiosperm evolu- 
tion, and multiple times (see below). 
In our reconstructions, binary coding (indefinite vs. 
whorled or fixed) results in a reconstruction of indefinite 
merism for the ancestral state of angiosperms with both 
MP and ML. In addition, ML reconstructs the ancestor 
of mesangiosperms as having a fixed perianth merism, al- 
though this is equivocal with MP (not shown). 
With multistate coding, the ancestral state of the angio- 
sperms is equivocal with both MP and ML. Above the ANA 
grade, both MP and ML give highly similar results with 
the ancestral character state for the mesangiosperms being 
a trimerous perianth (Fig. 6.9; see also Ronse De Craene 
et al. 2003; Zanis et al. 2003). This is the case regardless of 
whether Amborella and Nymphaeales are treated as a clade 
or as successive sisters to all other angiosperms and also re- 
gardless of whether Chloranthales follow ANA as sister to 
all other angiosperms or if Chloranthales + magnoliids are 
sister to other remaining angiosperms. Thus, although the 
trimerous condition is typically associated with monocots, 
our results further demonstrate that trimery has played a 
major role in the early evolution and diversification of the 
flower (see also Kubitzki 1987; Ronse De Craene and Smets 
1994; Soltis et al. 2005b, 2008b; Endress and Doyle 2009). 
Endress and Doyle (2007, 2009) and Doyle and Endress 
(2011) reconstructed the ancestral state of the angiosperms 
as trimerous, but only if taxa with spiral phyllotaxis were

110 Chapter 6 
scored as “unknown.” Our reconstructions also indicate 
that trimery arose independently in Nymphaeales and the 
ancestor of mesangiosperms (Fig. 6.9). 
Following the origin of a trimerous perianth, there was 
a return to an indeterminate perianth in several magnoliid 
lineages, including Calycanthaceae, the clade of Atherosper- 
mataceae (represented by Daphnandra) and Gomortega- 
ceae (Gomortega), Himantandraceae (Galbulimima), some 
Monimiaceae 
(e.g., Hortonia), and some Magnoliaceae 
(Magnolia). A perianth has also been lost several times 
(e.g., Eupomatiaceae, Piperaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, and 
most Chloranthaceae; Fig. 6.9). 
Our reconstructions indicate that perianth merism is 
labile in non-eudicot and non-monocot angiosperms (see 
also Endress 1987a,b, 1994a,c; Albert et al. 1998; Zanis 
et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005b). This labile condition then 
continues through the basal nodes of the eudicots, where 
trimery as well as dimery predominate (Fig. 6.9). In fact, 
the evolution of dimery immediately precedes the appear- 
ance of pentamery in core eudicots (see Chapter 8). This 
lability in basal eudicots contrasts with the condition of 
core eudicots and monocots (this is discussed further in 
Chapters 7 and 8). 
PERIANTH DIFFERENTIATION 
A differentiated or bipartite perianth has an outer whorl 
of sepals clearly differentiated from the inner whorl(s) 
of petals. In contrast, an undifferentiated perianth lacks 
clear distinction between the outer and inner whorls, or 
the perianth may consist of undifferentiated spirally ar- 
ranged parts; these undifferentiated perianth organs have 
traditionally been referred to as tepals. The term “tepal” 
was coined by de Candolle (1827) to describe a calyx and 
corolla that are not differentiated; thus, the entire perianth 
may be petaloid. Takhtajan (1969, 1987, 1997), in con- 
trast, used the term tepal in a phylogenetic sense such that 
all monocots have tepals, as derived from magnoliid tepals 
or bracts (Endress 1994c). Takhtajan’s definition of tepal 
limits the application of this term to specific groups of an- 
giosperms and requires different terms for an undifferenti- 
ated perianth in other groups. We use tepal as defined by de 
Candolle—an undifferentiated calyx and corolla. 
Distinguishing sepals from petals is not always straight- 
forward (Endress 1994c; Albert et al. 1998). Whereas sepals 
and petals are readily distinguished in most eudicots, this 
is not the case in basal angiosperms (Endress 2008), many 
of which have numerous spirally arranged, undifferentiated 
perianth parts, a condition long considered ancestral (e.g., 
Bessey 1915; Cronquist 1968, 1988; Takhtajan 1969). Peri- 
anth differentiation has also been of interest with regard to 
the origin of the sepal and petal (e.g., Eames 1931; Hiepko 
1965b; Kosuge 1994; Albert et al. 1998; Kramer and Irish 
1999, 2000; Zanis et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2004a; P. Soltis 
et al. 2009; Irish 2009). It has been suggested that petals 
evolved first and that sepals evolved later (e.g., Albert et al. 
1998) and that petals have evolved multiple times from dif- 
ferent floral organs in different groups (e.g., Eames 1961; 
Takhtajan 1969; Kosuge 1994; Albert et al. 1998; Zanis 
et al. 2003; Ronse De Craene and Brockington 2013). The 
petals present in some lineages, such as Magnoliales and 
Laurales, are proposed to have evolved from an undifferen- 
tiated perianth, whereas in other groups (Ranunculales and 
other eudicots) petals.are similar to stamens in morphology 
and ontogeny and may, in fact, be derived from stamens. 
Takhtajan (1969, 1987) suggested two types of petal ori- 
gins, one from stamens (e.g., Ranunculales) and one from 
bracts (e.g., Magnoliales). Hiepko (1965b) and Endress 
(2008) recommend use of “tepals” for basal angiosperms 
(ANA grade and magnoliids), and “sepals” and “petals” for 
eudicots; monocots are more difficult, however. 
Support for an independent origin of petals in eudicots 
has come from morphological studies showing that “pet- 
als” of various angiosperms exhibit major differences (En- 
dress 1994c; Kramer and Irish 2000; Brockington et al. 
2010, 2012; Ronse De Craene and Brockington 2013) and 
can be grouped into two basic classes. In one group are pet- 
als that resemble stamens. The characters shared by these 
petals and stamens include the following: the petals are de- 
velopmentally delayed relative to the stamens; young petals 
are similar in appearance to stamen primordia at inception; 
petals are supplied by a single vascular trace; and, in some 
cases, petals possess nectaries (Endress 1994c). These pet- 
als have sometimes been termed “andropetals.” The second 
type of petaloid organ is found in undifferentiated peri- 
anths (standardly termed tepals; Cronquist 1981) and is 
more leaf-like in general characteristics—that is, “bracteo- 
petals.” These structures mature much earlier than the sta- 
mens, often have three vascular traces, and are generally 
more leaf-like in appearance than other petals (Smith 1928; 
Tucker 1960; Takhtajan 1969). 
According to Albert et al. (1998), two or more whorls 
of perianth parts must be present for an unambiguous in- 
terpretation of sepals and petals. If only a single perianth 
whorl is present, it may be difficult to score as “sepals” 
or “petals” (Endress 1994a,c, and Chapter 14). Is a single 
whorl an undifferentiated perianth of neither sepals nor 
petals? Or, is the single whorl either sepals or petals with 
the other perianth whorl absent? A single-whorled perianth 
has traditionally been referred to as composed of “sepals” 
(e.g., Cronquist 1968). Although the number of vascular 
traces (one vs. three) has sometimes been considered an 
important distinguishing feature, studies in rosids showed 

that this distinction between one- and three-traced organs 
may not be of deep phylogenetic significance (e.g., Endress 
et al. 2013), but this needs further study. 
Families of basal angiosperms with a single whorled 
perianth include nearly all Aristolochiaceae (except Sa- 
ruma), all Myristicaceae, and Chloranthaceae (Hedyos- 
mum). Sometimes the nature of a single-whorled perianth 
can be determined through comparison with the perianths 
of closely related taxa. 
In Aristolochiaceae, most taxa have a single-whorled 
perianth that has been considered a calyx (Cronquist 1968, 
1981; Takhtajan 1991; Tucker and Douglas 1996). This 
determination is supported by observations for one genus 
(Saruma), which has two perianth whorls differentiated 
into sepals and petals. Furthermore, in some species of Asa- 
rum, petals begin to develop, but the only traces are small 
threadlike structures (Leins and Erbar 1985). Topologies 
place Asarum and Saruma as sister to the rest of the fam- 
ily (see Chapter 5); hence, the ancestral condition for the 
family is a differentiated perianth, with the single-whorled 
perianth derived through the loss of petals. 
We scored the single whorls of Myristicaceae and Hedyo- 
smum (Chloranthaceae) as representing an undifferentiated 
perianth, although others have considered these to be se- 
pals for the reasons discussed above (e.g., Cronquist 1981; 
Zanis et al. 2003). The perianths of some taxa are difficult 
to characterize. In Himantandraceae (comprising only Gal- 
bulimima), Cronquist (1981) described the perianth as con- 
sisting of both sepals and petals. Others have considered the 
outer structures bracts, rather than sepals, meaning that the 
remaining petaloid structures represent an undifferentiated 
perianth or staminodes (e.g., Endress 1977). We have ten- 
tatively interpreted these structures as an undifferentiated 
perianth. Adding to the complexity is the recent observation 
that even in the “undifferentiated” perianth of Amborella, 
there is some morphological differentiation between inner 
and outer members of the perianth (Endress and Igersheim 
2000a; Endress 2001a; Buzgo et al. 2004b). 
We conducted two sets of analyses. In one, perianth 
was coded as either undifferentiated or sepals + petals. In a 
second, the perianth was coded as either undifferentiated, 
sepals + petals, or absent; only this latter reconstruction is 
shown here. 
In all of our MP and ML reconstructions (Fig. 6.10) the 
ancestral state for the angiosperms is an undifferentiated 
perianth. This is the case regardless of the number of states 
employed (above), whether Amborella and Nymphaeaceae 
are treated as sister taxa or as successive sister groups to all 
remaining angiosperms, or the placement of Chloranthales. 
Amborella and Austrobaileyales have an undifferenti- 
ated perianth. Trithuria (Hydatellaceae) lacks a perianth. 
In this reconstruction, the ancestral state for Nymphaeales, 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
111 
as well as Nymphaeaceae + Cabombaceae, is determined to 
be ambiguous in most analyses. Although the ancestor of 
Nymphaeaceae + Cabombaceae is reconstructed as having 
a differentiated perianth with ML with binary states, a dif- 
ferentiated perianth for the clade is strongly favored with 
ML when multiple states are employed. Cabombaceae (e.g., 
Cabomba, Brasenia) and Nuphar have sometimes been 
considered to have an undifferentiated perianth, whereas 
more derived Nymphaeaceae (Victoria, Nymphaea) have 
been considered to have more of a differentiated perianth. 
However, as noted in Chapter 4, some authors consider all 
Nymphaeales to have a differentiated perianth. 
Following the ANA grade, an undifferentiated perianth 
is ancestral for the remaining angiosperms (mesangio- 
sperms) in all reconstructions (Fig. 6.10); a differentiated 
perianth subsequently evolved many times. Separate ori- 
gins of a differentiated perianth occurred in the monocots, 
some Magnoliaceae, Annonaceae, Canellales, and some 
Aristolochiaceae with additional origins in early-diverging 
eudicots and core eudicots (see Chapter 8, 9). The data in- 
dicate that “sepals” and “petals” in these lineages are not 
homologous, a point long stressed (see Ronse De Craene 
and Brockington 2013). 
Our coding of a single-whorled, trimerous perianth as 
undifferentiated in Hedyosmum (Chloranthaceae) and My- 
risticaceae is a conservative approach. Many basal angio- 
sperms such as Canellaceae, Magnoliaceae, and Nympha- 
eaceae have a trimerous outer whorl and an inner whorl 
or whorls that are variable in merism (Zanis et al. 2003). 
Thus, the trimerous outer whorl in basal angiosperms may 
be homologous to the trimerous perianth found in taxa 
having a single-whorled perianth. Assuming that the single- 
whorled perianth is in all cases sepaloid, the ancestral state 
above Austrobaileyales changes to a differentiated perianth 
(not shown). 
STAMEN PHYLLOTAXIS 
Reconstructions of the evolution of stamen phyllotaxis (not 
shown) mirror the differentiation of perianth phyllotaxis 
discussed above (see also Ronse De Craene et al. 2003). We 
reconstructed stamen phyllotaxis as both a binary charac- 
ter (spiral [including chaotic] or whorled) and a multistate 
character (spiral, polycyclic, tetracyclic, tricyclic, dicyclic, 
monocyclic, and chaotic). However, Endress and Doyle 
(2007) found the phyllotaxis of perianth and androecium 
somewhat decoupled in Magnoliales. 
With binary coding, the interpretation is straightfor- 
ward compared to multistate coding. The ancestral state 
for angiosperms is ambiguous with MP and ML using 
binary states (Fig. 6.11); with multiple states, the ancestor

is spiral with MP; spiral is favored with ML. With binary 
states, the ancestor of the mesangiosperms is unambigu- 
ously whorled with both MP and ML (Fig. 6.11); in the 
multistate analyses, the mesangiosperm ancestral state is 
ambiguous (not shown), probably because of the number 
and complexity of the states (a problem seen with peri- 
anth phyllotaxis). The multistate analysis is constructive 
in showing that polycycly has arisen multiple times (e.g., 
Winteraceae, Annonaceae, within Nymphaeaceae), as has 
monocycly (Hernandiaceae, Chloranthaceae, as well as 
some basal eudicots—see Chapter 8). 
STAMEN MERISM 
As with perianth merism, stamen merism was also coded as 
binary (indefinite in number and fixed in number) and mul- 
tistate (indefinite, dimerous, trimerous, and pentamerous). 
With binary states, MP reconstructions are ambiguous for 
the ancestral state of angiosperms, but ML favors indefinite 
(not shown). Multistate reconstructions (both MP and ML) 
indicate that the ancestor of angiosperms had an indefinite 
number of stamens (not shown). 
Reconstruction of ancestral stamen merism for mesan- 
giosperms varies greatly depending on the states assigned 
and analysis and therefore remains unclear. What is clear 
from multistate analyses is that the trimerous condition 
has evolved multiple times: Cabombaceae, Piperales + Aris- 
tolochiales, Lauraceae, monocots, and Ranunculales (see 
Chapter 8). These results parallel those (above) for peri- 
anth merism and again illustrate that trimery has played 
a major role in the early evolution and diversification of 
the flower. Multistate coding also illustrates the lability of 
stamen merism, a result also stressed above with perianth 
merism. 
STAMEN FORM 
The stamens of many non-eudicot and non-monocot an- 
giosperms are distinctive because of their large size, exten- 
sive quantity of sterile tissue surrounding the pollen sacs, 
and the lack of differentiation between filament and an- 
ther (Endress and Hufford 1989). The leaf-like, or laminar, 
stamens present in many of the non-eudicot/non-monocot 
taxa have long been of interest (Fig. 6.12). Authors have 
long proposed that the earliest angiosperms possessed lam- 
inar stamens (e.g., Canright 1952; Eames 1961; Cronquist 
1968; Takhtajan 1969) (see also Chapter 4). From this pu- 
tatively ancestral type of stamen, a gradual modification in 
size and shape was proposed, resulting in the typical sta- 
men present in most angiosperms, a stamen composed of a 
well-defined anther and filament (Fig. 6.12). 
Hufford (1996a) reconstructed stamen evolution across 
basal angiosperms using topologies from Donoghue and 
Doyle (1989a,b) with either Magnoliales or Nympha- 
eaceae and monocots as sister to other angiosperms; two 
basic states were used, laminar and non-laminar. With the 
first topology, Hufford reconstructed laminar stamens as 
ancestral; with the second topology, as not ancestral. 
We did not reconstruct the evolution of stamen form in 
basal angiosperms because of the numerous intermediates 
between laminar stamens and those with well-defined an- 
ther and filament regions (Fig. 6.12; Endress and Hufford 
1989; Endress 1994c). Appropriate assessments of charac- 
ters and character states require additional developmental 
studies. Until those data are available, character-state re- 
constructions have to be viewed with caution. We review 
the diversity of stamen form in basal angiosperms. 
Among basal angiosperms, Amborella, Austrobaileya, 
and some Nymphaeaceae have laminar stamens (Chap- 
ter 4; Fig. 6.12). Stamen form in Nymphaeaceae is diverse, 
with laminar stamens in Nuphar and Victoria (Endress and 
Hufford 1989; Hufford 1996a) and stamens with well- 
defined anther and filament regions present in Cabomba 
and Brasenia (Cronquist 1988); laminar stamens and sta- 
mens intermediate between laminar and and non-laminar 
occur in Nymphaea (Chapter 4; Hufford 1996a). In Trime- 
niaceae, the stamens have well-defined anther and filament 
regions. The stamens of Schisandraceae (including I/licium) 
are “relatively undifferentiated,” with the filament often 
broader than the “anther” region (Endress and Hufford 
1989). Hence, within Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and 
Austrobaileyales, laminar, linear, and intermediate stamens 
are found. 
Extreme examples of laminar stamens are present in 
Degeneriaceae, Himantandraceae, and Eupomatiaceae (all 
Magnoliales). In Winteraceae, the stamens are only slightly 
differentiated into anther and filament (Fig. 6.12). Many 
magnoliid families have stamens with well-differentiated 
filament and anther: Monimiaceae, Myristicaceae, Laura- 
ceae, Piperaceae, Saururaceae, Aristolochiaceae, and Lacto- 
ridaceae (Fig. 6.12). The stamens of Ceratophyllum lack a 
filament region, but basal monocots possess stamens with 
well-differentiated anther and filament regions (Fig. 6.12). 
Laminar stamens have originated multiple times, with 
independent origins in at least the ANA grade, Wintera- 
ceae, and Magnoliales (Fig. 6.12; see also, e.g., Endress and 
Hufford 1989; Hufford 1996a; Endress and Doyle 2009); 
therefore, not all laminar stamens are homologous (En- 
dress and Hufford 1989; Hufford 1996a). For example, 
the laminar stamens of Galbulimima and Degeneria dif-

fer substantially from those in Austrobaileya (Fig. 6.12) in 
radial thickness, sporangial dehiscence, location of pollen 
sacs, and the manner in which the sporangia are embedded 
within the microsporophyll (Endress 1994c). 
The prevalence of laminar and intermediate stamen 
morphologies in the basalmost angiosperms agrees with the 
fossil record. Angiosperm stamens in Early Cretaceous fos- 
sil floras typically exhibit little differentiation between an- 
ther and filament (e.g., Friis et al. 2000, 2011). It is tempt- 
ing to speculate that laminar stamens are ancestral in the 
angiosperms. However, there is room for caution, given the 
diversity of forms present within just the ANA grade. Fur- 
thermore, Cabomba and Brasenia, the sister group to other 
Nymphaeaceae, both have stamens with well-differentiated 
anther and filament regions, and it appears that laminar 
stamens are derived within Nymphaeaceae in association 
with beetle pollination (Gottsberger 1988). 
POLLEN 
Early angiosperms likely had uniaperturate (one area of 
weakness) pollen, which is typical of most basal angio- 
sperms, magnoliids, and Chloranthales and is also present 
in early angiosperm fossils (Friis et al. 2011). Triaperturate 
pollen is a synapomorphy for the eudicots. Schisandraceae 
also have triaperturate pollen, but of a unique type distinct 
from the pollen typical of eudicots (Huynh 1976). 
There has been considerable speculation as to the fine- 
scale features of the pollen (pollen infratectum) in the ances- 
tral angiosperms. Cronquist (1988) considered pollen with 
granular exine to be ancestral in the angiosperms because 
of its prevalence in his Magnoliales. Furthermore, granular 
pollen was one of the putative synapomorphies of Gnetales 
and angiosperms (Crane 1985; Doyle and Donoghue 1986; 

116 Chapter 6 
Doyle 1996) and a feature that placed Magnoliales as sister 
to other angiosperms in earlier investigations (Donoghue 
and Doyle 1989a,b). However, Doyle (2005, 2009) found 
granular pollen to be derived. 
Doyle and Endress (2000) examined the evolution of in- 
fratectal pollen wall structure. In addition to the granular 
and columellar states recognized in an earlier study (Dono- 
ghue and Doyle 1989a), they recognized an intermediate 
condition characterized by irregular radial (columellar) 
elements mixed with apparent granules. It is not entirely 
clear whether this “intermediate” condition is an appropri- 
ate independent state; additional developmental studies are 
needed to evaluate this state more critically. 
Our reconstructions generally agree with Doyle and 
Endress (2000) although our ML reconstructions provide 
a new perspective. The intermediate condition is found in 
Amborella and some Nymphaeaceae, indicating that this 
could be the ancestral state for angiosperms and is recon- 
structed as such with MP. However, with ML the ancestral 
state for angiosperms is unclear (Fig. 6.13). Significantly, 
above the node to Nymphaeales, the ancestral state for all 
remaining angiosperms is columellar with both MP and 
ML. Most of the transitions to granular and intermedi- 
ate forms occur within Laurales 
+ Magnoliales; Piperales 
+ Canellales share columellar pollen. These results were 
not evident, however, in Doyle and Endress (2000) because 
they used a tree in which neither Laurales 
+ Magnoliales 
nor Canellales + Piperales appeared as sister groups. 
Our reconstructions, as in Doyle (2005, 2009), indi- 
cate that a granular infratectum is not ancestral in the 
angiosperms but likely arose independently within some 
Nymphaeaceae (e.g., Nuphar and Nymphaea), Laurales 
(e.g., Lauraceae and Hernandiaceae), and Magnoliales 
(Annonaceae, Eupomatiaceae, Degeneriaceae, Himantan- 
draceae). 
CARPEL FORM 
We discuss carpel form briefly in Chapter 4 (basal angio- 
sperms). Here we focus on our reconstructions of this fea- 
ture. There are two extremes (Doyle and Endress 2000), 
plicate and ascidiate (Fig. 6.14; see Fig. 4.5). The plicate 
carpel form can be compared to a leaf folded down the 
middle with ovules on the folded (plicate) zone or area 
(Fig. 4.5). The plicate condition was considered ancestral 
for angiosperms by Bailey and Swamy (1951) and Eames 
(1961). In the ascidiate form, in contrast, the carpel grows 
like a tube; this form was considered ancestral by Leinfell- 
ner (1969) and van Heel (1981, 1983). Doyle and Endress 
(2000) noted that intermediate carpel conditions also ex- 
ist and are found in several basal angiosperms, including 
Barclaya (Nymphaeaceae), Illicium (Schisandraceae, sensu 
APG IV 2016), and Acorus (Acoraceae). We follow Doyle 
and Endress (2000) and Endress and Doyle (2009) in rec- 
ognizing an intermediate state, but it is not clear whether 
this is an appropriate, independent state; additional devel- 
opmental studies are encouraged. 
Reconstructions indicate that ascidiate carpels are an- 
cestral in the angiosperms (Fig. 6.14; Doyle and Endress 
2000); they characterize Amborella, most Nymphaeaceae, 
Austrobaileyaceae, most Schisandraceae, and Trimeniaceae 
(Figure 3.16; Endress and Igersheim 2000b). Intermediate 
carpel forms are present in Barclaya (Nymphaeaceae) and 
also in Illicium (Schisandraceae). Above ANA, Ceratophyl- 
lum and Chloranthaceae also have ascidiate carpels. The 
first derivation of plicate carpels occurs in the monocots. 
Our reconstruction also agrees with the prevalence of pu- 
tative ascidiate carpels in fossils from the Early Cretaceous 
(Crane et al. 1995; Friis et al. 2011). 
The ancestral state for mesangiosperms is uncertain 
(Fig. 6.14). The plicate form is reconstructed as ancestral 
for the magnoliids and for eudicots; these derivations ap- 
pear to be independent origins. Several reversals to the 
ascidiate form are also apparent in magnoltids (Monimi- 
aceae), monocots (Araceae), and early-diverging eudicots 
(Berberidaceae and Nelumbo). 
An intermediate carpel type characterizes much of 
Laurales and represents a possible morphological synapo- 
morphy of that clade. Intermediate carpel form has also 
evolved independently in Acorus, Myristicaceae, and the 
eudicot Euptelea (Ranunculales). It would be of interest to 
characterize these intermediate types in more detail. 
CARPEL SEALING 
Carpel sealing was initially discussed in chapter 4—here we 
provide additional detail, including ancestral-state recon- 
struction. In most taxa having ascidiate carpels, the carpels 
are sealed by secretion rather than by postgenital fusion 
(see Fig. 4.5; Endress and Igersheim 2000b). Carpel form 
and carpel sealing are therefore closely associated. Endress 
and Igersheim (2000b) recognized four types of carpel seal- 
ing: (1) a complete lack of postgenital fusion but occlusion 
of the inner space by secretion; (2) a combination of post- 
genital fusion at the periphery and no fusion but occlusion 
by secretion in the center with a complete unfused canal up 
to the stigma; (3) a combination of postgenital fusion en- 
compassing the entire periphery and an unfused secretory 
canal that is not complete but ends below the stigma; and 
(4) complete postgenital fusion of the inner space between 
the ovary and the stigma. Amborella exhibits the first of 
these (Fig. 4.5), as do most Austrobaileyales (however,

MP and ML reconstruction of the evolution of carpel form in the ANA grade, magnoliids, monocots, and basal eudicots. The topology follows Soltis 
et al. (2011). See Fig. 6.1. for placement of Lactoris. Data are from Doyle and Endress (2000), Endress and Doyle (2009), and Rudall et al. (2007) with modifications 
(see text). 

Illicium has type 2) and Cabomba (Nymphaeaceae). Other 
Nymphaeaceae (Barclaya and Nymphaea) have type 3. 
Most eudicots have type 4. 
We followed Endress and Doyle (2009) and scored post- 
genital sealing as follows: none, partial, complete (combin- 
ing 2 and 3 above). Our MP reconstructions (Fig. 6.15) 
are comparable to those of Endress and Doyle (2009) and 
indicate that carpels sealed by secretion (no postgenital fu- 
sion) represent the ancestral condition for angiosperms. 
ML reconstructions are less clear, however, with some 
probability of partial fusion or even complete fusion. This 
is likely due to the presence of some derived members of 
Nymphaeaceae having complete postgenital fusion. None- 
theless, the fact that Amborellaceae, some Nymphaeaceae, 
and most Austrobaileyales have carpels that are not post- 
genitally sealed but are fused by secretion has important 
evolutionary implications, suggesting that this is ancestral. 
The ancestral state for mesangiosperms is ambiguous— 
complete postgenital fusion may have evolved multiple 
times 
(Fig. 6.15). These data imply that angiospermy 
evolved first in early flowering plants and that postgenital 
fusion of the carpel evolved later (Endress and Igersheim 
2000b). 
APOCARPY VERSUS SYNCARPY 
It has long been suggested that the hypothetical ancestral 
angiosperms had numerous free carpels (apocarpy; Cron- 
quist 1968; Takhtajan 1969; Stebbins 1974). Our recon- 
structions unambiguously reconstruct the ancestral state of 
the angiosperms, as well as that of mesangiosperms and 
early-diverging eudicots, as apocarpous (Fig. 6.16). We fol- 
lowed Doyle and Endress (2000; see Endress and Doyle 
2009), who recognized three states: apocarpous, in which 
the carpels are free (distinct), parasyncarpous (a gynoecium 
in which the carpels are united and a unilocular ovary is 
present, i.e., no fusion in the center, no septa or only partial 
septa), and eusyncarpous (a gynoecium with a plurilocular 
ovary in which the septa meet in the center and are fused). 
Amborella, Cabomba, and Brasenia (Nymphaeales) have 
free carpels, although other Nymphaeales have united car- 
pels. Austrobaileyales, Laurales, Magnoliales, and most Ra- 
nunculales are characterized by apocarpy. The reconstruc- 
tions indicate that syncarpy is derived in Nymphaeales; the 
monocots may be ancestrally syncarpous (Acorus and Ara- 
ceae are both syncarpous), with a reversal to apocarpy in 
Tofieldia, Alismataceae, and Butomus. Parasyncarpy may 
also be ancestral for Piperaceae and Canellales as well as 
Papaveraceae (cf. Doyle and Endress 2000). Eusyncarpy 
has arisen separately within the monocots and eudicots. 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
119 
OVULE NUMBER 
Doyle and Endress (2000) (see also Endress and Doyle 
2009) reconstructed the evolution of ovule number and 
scored character states as one, mostly two, and more than 
two ovules. With these states and their topology, the ances- 
tral state for the angiosperms is equivocal. This equivocal- 
ity appears to be due more to variability in this character 
and the character-state coding used than to the topology. 
Many non-eudicot angiosperms have a small number 
of ovules per carpel. Amborella and Trimeniaceae have a 
single ovule per carpel; Schisandraceae have one or two. 
Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllum also have one ovule 
per carpel. However, the basal angiosperm Austrobaileya 
has 8 to 15 ovules per carpel; ovule number per carpel in 
Acorus (sister to other monocots) is 2 to 6; the number in 
Nymphaeales ranges from 1 to 300, but in Cabomba and 
Brasenia the number is low, typically 1 to 3, and in Hyda- 
tellaceae it is 1. Scoring these critical taxa as “more than 
two” ovules per carpel hinders attempts to reconstruct the 
number of ovules per carpel in early angiosperms by ob- 
scuring diversity; this single large category (more than two) 
includes a low to moderate number of ovules per carpel as 
well as a very high number of ovules per carpel. The fact 
that some basal angiosperms have a low number of ovules 
(5-20) is lost by lumping all taxa together that have more 
than two ovules per carpel. In addition, some families have 
substantial variation in ovule number (e.g., Nymphaeaceae, 
families of Canellales and Piperales, and the basal eudicot 
family Ranunculaceae). 
In our reconstruction, we added additional states: 1, 
mostly 2 (but including 3 or 4), 5 to 20, and more than 
20 ovules per carpel. We coded taxa of Nymphaeaceae 
following information in Endress (2001a) and coded the 
polymorphism evident in some families, which was not 
captured by Doyle and Endress (2000). 
In our reconstruction (Fig. 6.17), a single ovule is ances- 
tral not only for the angiosperms but also for mesangio- 
sperms. The ancestral state for mesangiosperms was ambig- 
uous in Endress and Doyle (2009). In our reconstructions 
the ancestral state for eudicots may be two (this is favored 
by ML, but not MP), but is best considered equivocal. 
OVULE CURVATURE 
Most angiosperms have anatropous ovules; however, some, 
including several early-branching lineages, have orthotro- 
pous ovules. Gymnosperms also have orthotropous ovules 
(Fig. 1.10). Other types of ovules (see Chapter 4; Fig. 4.8)

tt 
are also found in various angiosperm lineages (e.g., cam- 
pylotropous, Caryophyllales). Because of the prevalence 
of anatropous ovules across all of the angiosperms, this 
state typically has been considered the ancestral condition 
(Cronquist 1968; Takhtajan 1969; Stebbins 1974). How- 
ever, Amborella and several other non-eudicots, includ- 
ing Chloranthaceae, some Nymphaeaceae (i.e., Barclaya), 
Ceratophyllum, and Acorus (sister to all other monocots), 
possess ovules considered orthotropous (discussion in En- 
dress 2011). 
We followed Doyle and Endress (2000) and Endress and 
Doyle (2009) in scoring ovules as anatropous or orthotro- 
pous (including hemitropous in this category). If Amborella 
is scored as orthotropous (Endress and Igersheim 2000b; 
Yamada et al. 2001b), the ancestral condition for the an- 
giosperms with both MP and ML is equivocal, although 
ML favors anatropous (Fig. 6.18). Following Amborella, 
the anatropous ovule is consistently reconstructed as ances- 
tral for the remaining angiosperm nodes (mesangiosperms, 
magnoliids, monocots, eudicots) (Fig. 6.18). Doyle and En- 
dress (2009) obtained similar results. 
Developmental data have indicated that the interpreta- 
tion of ovule evolution is more complex than our recon- 
structions indicate. In many non-eudicots, the outer integu- 
ment is not cup-shaped, but rather markedly asymmetric 
and hood-shaped. Yamada et al. (2001b) found that the 
outer integument of both Amborella and Chloranthus is 
asymmetrical and concluded that the developmental pat- 
tern of the outer integument and the ovule developmental 
pattern seen in both Amborella and Chloranthus are not 
equivalent to those of the orthotropous ovules of eudicots. 
Developmental data indicate that the orthotropous ovules 
found in ascidiate carpels (as in Amborella and Chloran- 
thus, see above) are derived (see Endress 1986b, 1994c, 
2011a; Yamada et al. 2001b). Further support for the an- 
tiquity of ascidiate carpels with anatropous ovules is pro- 
vided by the fossil record, including the fossil Couperites 
(Chloranthaceae) with an anatropous ovule (Pedersen et al. 
1994) and fruits with anatropous ovules from the Barre- 
mian of Portugal (one of the oldest strata bearing angio- 
sperm fossils; Friis et al. 1999, 2000, 2011). 
ENDOSPERM 
Until a decade ago any review of angiosperm evolution 
would have indicated that the ancestral state for angio- 
sperms was double fertilization, with the second fertiliza- 
tion event forming triploid endosperm (the latter formed 
via fusion of a sperm and two polar nuclei frorn the female 
gametophyte). However, recent papers demonstrated that 
diploid endosperm is formed in Nuphar (Nymphaeaceae) 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
123 
as well as Austrobaileyales (Williams and Friedman 2002; 
Friedman 2006, 2009; Tobe et al. 2007; Rudall et al. 2008; 
Friedman and Ryerson 2009; Williams 2009; Bachelier and 
Friedman 2011). 
Rather than possessing a female gametophyte of eight 
nuclei and seven cells, which is typical of angiosperms, 
ANA lineages other than Amborella have four nuclei in 
four cells (see Figs. 4.15 and 6.19; e.g., Yoshida 1962, for 
Schisandra; Winter and Shamrov 1991, for Nuphar). The 
second fertilization involves a sperm nucleus and just one 
nucleus of the female gametophyte, resulting in diploid 
rather than triploid endosperm. Previous studies provide 
indirect developmental data consistent with a four-celled 
female gametophyte in representatives of the ANA grade: 
Nymphaea, Cabomba, Schisandra, and Illicium (see Wil- 
liams and Friedman 2002). Other analyses indicated that a 
four-celled female gametophyte is present in Austrobaileya, 
Illicium, and Trimenia (Tobe et al. 2000, 2007; Friedman 
and Ryerson 2009; Williams 2009; Bachelier and Friedman 
2011). Many of these taxa also produce diploid endosperm 
(in some taxa analyzed embryologically such as Trimenia, 
the nature of the endosperm [diploid vs. triploid] is un- 
clear). However, Amborella has a female gametophyte of 
nine nuclei and eight cells and triploid endosperm (Fried- 
man 2006; Williams 2009). 
Because some basal angiosperms have four-celled female 
gametophytes, and others seven-celled, MP reconstructions 
indicate that the ancestral state for the female gametophyte 
(four-celled vs, seven-celled) and endosperm (diploid vs, 
triploid) in the angiosperms is equivocal (see Williams and 
Friedman 2002; Soltis et al. 2005b). In our analyses, MP 
reconstructions similarly indicate that the ancestral state 
of angiosperms is equivocal. With ML reconstructions, the 
results vary. When relative branch lengths are employed 
(based on the Soltis et al. 2011 topology; Fig. 6.19), a 
four-celled female gametophyte and diploid endosperm 
are slightly favored as ancestral; in contrast, when equal 
branch lengths are used, the ancestral state is more likely to 
be eight nuclei and seven cells and triploid endosperm. The 
results are best summarized as indicating that the ancestral 
condition for angiosperms is equivocal. 
Following the ANA grade, however, the ancestral state 
for the remaining angiosperms is clear: a female gameto- 
phyte of eight nuclei and seven cells and triploid endo- 
sperm. These states are characteristic of lineages of mes- 
angiosperms, including Chloranthaceae and Magnoliidae. 
In addition to the discovery of diploid endosperm, sub- 
sequent patterns of early endosperm development are more 
complex than described in the traditionally used categories 
of cellular, free nuclear, and helobial (Floyd and Friedman 
2000). Floyd and Friedman (2000) suggested that basal 
angiosperms have retained plesiomorphic features. Most

basal angiosperms exhibit extensive endosperm develop- 
ment (but not Nymphaeales), as well as differential devel- 
opmental fates of the chalazal and micropylar regions of 
the endosperm (bipolar endosperm development). In most 
basal angiosperms, endosperm development in both do- 
mains is cellular (cell walls are formed), an ontogeny re- 
ferred to as “bipolar cellular.” Furthermore, endosperm de- 
velopment appears to be highly conserved throughout the 
radiation of basal angiosperms, with a few exceptions (e.g., 
Cabomba, Saururus, and Lauraceae). The diversification of 
endosperm development coincided with the radiations of 
monocots and eudicots (Floyd and Friedman 2000). 
RECONSTRUCTING THE 
EARLIEST ANGIOSPERMS 
HMISTORICAE VIEWS 
There have been frequent attempts to reconstruct the floral 
morphology, habit, ecology, and other characteristics of the 
earliest angiosperms (e.g., Arber and Parkin 1907; Axelrod 
1952; Cronquist 1968, 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1969; Steb- 
bins 1974; Doyle and Hickey 1976; Doyle 1978; Retallack 
and Dilcher 1981; Taylor and Hickey 1996b; Soltis et al. 
2005b, 2008b; Endress and Doyle 2007, 2009). Cronquist 
(1968, 1988), Takhtajan (1969), and Stebbins (1974) at- 
tempted to reconstruct a hypothetical ancestral angiosperm 
based on their views of extant “primitive” angiosperms. 
They considered extant members of their Magnoliales to 
be the most archaic living angiosperms, with each species 
retaining some ancestral features. They suggested that the 
earliest angiosperms had simple, entire leaves, were ever- 
green, woody plants, but “not necessarily trees,” of moist 
tropical habitats with an equable climate. Cronquist main- 
tained that the nodes were unilacunar with two leaf traces 
or perhaps trilacunar with three traces. The wood lacked 
vessels, but possessed long, slender tracheids, with long, 
tapering ends, and numerous scalariform bordered pits. 
The flowers were large, bisexual, and strobiloid, with nu- 
merous spirally arranged parts (e.g., Magnolia-like). The 
perianth was not differentiated into sepals and petals, but 
consisted of spirally arranged tepals. The stamens were 
large and laminar with no differentiation into filament and 
anther. The pollen had a single long sulcus; the exine had a 
raised-reticulate surface ornamentation and internally was 
either solid or, more probably, tectate-granular. No nectar 
or nectaries were present. The flowers contained several to 
many carpels, each of which was folded along the midrib 
(plicate) and unsealed, with the margins loosely appressed 
rather than “anatomically joined,” effectively closed by “a 
tangle of hairs.” The embryo was small; double fertilization 
occurred, and the endosperm was triploid. The endosperm 
was probably copious and of the nuclear type (i.e., it had a 
free-nuclear stage early in ontogeny). 
Stebbins (1974) had a different view of the ancestral an- 
giosperm, reflecting his belief that novelty evolved in mar- 
ginal habitats. Nonetheless, he also maintained that these 
first angiosperms were similar in many respects to modern 
Magnoliales. He suggested that the first angiosperms were 
shrubs that grew in semi-arid or seasonally dry tropical or 
subtropical habitats, with leaves strongly reduced in size 
in association with this dry habitat. A seasonal climate fa- 
vored compression of the reproductive cycle into a rela- 
tively short period. The distinctive characteristics of an- 
giosperms arose in response to seasonal drought (Axelrod 
1970, 1972; see also Hickey and Doyle 1977), including 
closure of the carpel, reduction in the size of gametophytes, 
evolution of double fertilization, and a shift from wind to 
insect pollination. 
Retallack and Dilcher (1981) maintained that a “xe- 
romorphic bottleneck” (Hickey and Doyle 1977) played 
a major role in angiosperm origins; early evolution was 
induced by near-marine environments rather than by arid 
environments. Building on their “herbaceous origin” hy- 
pothesis, Taylor and Hickey (1996b) suggested that angio- 
sperms evolved in a fluvial regime, in sites characterized 
by high disturbance and moderate amounts of alluviation. 
These areas would have had high nutrient levels and fre- 
quent loss of plant cover due to periodic disturbance. 
Whereas Cronquist, Takhtajan, and Stebbins focused on 
Magnoliales and Taylor and Hickey (1996b) focused on 
Piperales for inferring ancestral characteristics of the an- 
giosperms, molecular phylogenetic studies conducted over 
the past 20 years convincingly point to the ANA grade as 
the basalmost extant angiosperms. Endress (1986b) was 
perhaps the only investigator to suggest, from morphol- 
ogy, that some of these groups were among the earliest- 
diverging extant angiosperms. He indicated that Amborel- 
laceae, Austrobaileyaceae, Trimeniaceae, and Winteraceae 
(which is not part of the ANA grade, but a magnoliid) were 
potential candidates as some of the earliest angiosperm 
families. 
A SUMMARY HYPOTHETICAL 
RECONSTRUCTION OF 
EARLY ANGIOSPERMS 
Based on the overview provided above and information in 
Chapters 3 and 4, what can we say about the ancestor of 
living angiosperms? We attempt an overall summary. With 
improved understanding of angiosperm phylogeny, it is 
now possible to make more informed reconstructions of 

al 
the morphology and ecology of the ancestors of extant an- 
giosperms, as well as subsequent evolutionary patterns. Of 
course, extant basal angiosperms may not be representative 
of the earliest, now extinct, lineages and may not even rep- 
resent the earliest diversification of the angiosperms. Fur- 
thermore, some Early Cretaceous fossils cannot be clearly 
assigned to any extant families (Friis et al. 2000); Archae- 
fructus is one example (Sun et al. 2002; Friis et al. 2003a, 
2011). 
Although we have made great advances in our under- 
standing of many aspects of angiosperm phylogeny, mor- 
phology, floral genetics, and paleobiology, in many respects 
the origin of the angiosperms remains unclear. We and 
others have gone to great lengths to reconstruct various 
features of early angiosperms, yet it is not at all clear that 
these reconstructions are representative of the earliest an- 
giosperms. Because gymnosperms lack many characters of 
interest in early angiosperms, our reconstructions are am- 
biguous regarding the ancestral state for angiosperms. Fur- 
thermore, reconstructions based on extant taxa do not take 
into account the diversity of fossils. Archaefructus further 
reveals the enormous diversity in morphology and form 
present in early angiosperms. 
With these important caveats, we offer a reconstruction 
of early angiosperms that is based on the features of ex- 
tant species with input from the fossil record. Perhaps the 
best we can hope to do is to reconstruct early angiosperm 
motifs. 
Whether the first angiosperms were forest shrubs (dark- 
and-disturbed hypothesis) or aquatic herbs (wet-and-wild 
hypothesis) remains unclear (Feild et al. 2004; Coiffard 
et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2008b). The phylogenetic position of 
Nymphaeales (water lilies) indicates that the aquatic habit 
arose early (Endress and Doyle 2009). As a result of the 
near-basal placement of Nymphaeales, the habit of the first 
flowering plants is reconstructed as equivocal in many anal- 
yses (Soltis et al. 2005b and here). However, it takes only 
minor changes in character coding to yield a woody ances- 
tral angiosperm. In addition, there may be more reasons to 
favor a woody ancestral state—that is, because all gymno- 
sperms are woody. Prominent authors favored a terrestrial 
origin for this reason (Cronquist 1968; Takhtajan 1969; 
Stebbins 1974), and thought that the first angiosperms were 
shrubs or small trees, which agrees with early-diverging ex- 
tant taxa such as Amborella and members of Austrobailey- 
ales. As noted, reconstructions with gymnosperm outgroups 
added result in a woody ancestral state for angiosperms. 
However, others proposed that angiosperms were ances- 
trally herbaceous (e.g., Taylor and Hickey 1992, 1996a,b; 
Doyle et al. 1994). Nymphaeales, which follow Amborella 
as sister to all remaining angiosperms, are aquatic herbs. 
The early angiosperm Archaefructus was also herbaceous 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
127 
and aquatic. The aquatic habit clearly appeared very early 
in the diversification of flowering plants. Some of our re- 
constructions suggest that angiosperms were ancestrally 
woody; only if Chloranthaceae are coded as herbaceous 
is the ancestral state for angiosperms ambiguous. Ambo- 
rella and Austrobaileyales are small trees, shrubs, or woody 
vines; all are shade tolerant and exhibit morphological and 
physiological traits that enhance the capture of light in a 
forest understory (Feild et al. 2000a, 2003a,b). Based on 
characteristics 
of Amborellaceae and Austrobaileyales, 
Feild et al. (2004) proposed that angiosperms arose in 
“dark and disturbed” understory habitats. 
Character-state reconstructions indicate that early an- 
giosperms also possessed unilacunar (one- or two-trace) 
nodal anatomy, although the evolutionary significance of 
this anatomical characteristic is unknown. It remains un- 
clear whether the ancestor of extant angiosperms possessed 
leaves with chloranthoid teeth, although ML analyses favor 
that reconstruction. The early angiosperms did not produce 
ethereal oils—those appeared slightly later in angiosperm 
evolution. 
The earliest angiosperms may have lacked vessels in the 
xylem. Vessels are considered more efficient in conducting 
water than tracheids and provide water to leaves at an in- 
creased rate (Carlquist 1975; Takhtajan 1969). The xylem 
features of Amborella, Austrobaileya (Austrobaileyaceae), 
Illicium, and Kadsura (Schisandraceae) suggest that early 
angiosperms either lacked vessels or instead possessed 
“primitive” vessel elements with tracheid features. How- 
ever, if many early angiosperms lived in wet understory 
conditions as hypothesized, a low water-transport capacity 
of the stems would not have been problematic with xylem 
of this nature (Feild et al. 2000a, 2003a,b, 2004). For exam- 
ple, Amborella lacks vessels, and thus the water-conducting 
capacity of the stems is low, but the plants grow in areas 
of low evaporative demand and high rainfall. Vessels are 
present in Austrobaileya, but have tracheid-like features 
such as gradually tapered end walls, frequent scalariform 
perforation plates, and small diameters (Bailey and Swamy 
1948; Carlquist 1996; Carlquist and Schneider 2002). Al- 
though the hydraulic capacity of the xylem in Austrobai- 
leya is higher than that of Amborella, the values are still 
lower than in other climbing angiosperms (Tyree and Ew- 
ers 1991, 1996). The stem xylem water-transport capacities 
of Illicium and Kadsura are also much lower than values 
for most vessel-bearing shrubs and deciduous angiosperm 
trees and lianas, respectively (Tyree and Ewers 1991, 1996; 
Sperry et al. 1994; see Feild et al. 2000a, 2003a,b, 2004). 
The low water-conducting values in I/licium and Kadsura 
are probably the result of the unspecialized vessels, which 
are short, with long, oblique scalariform perforation plates 
that partially retain pit membranes (Carlquist 1982).

Early terrestrial angiosperms may have been successful 
because they exploited wet, understory forest environments 
more effectively than ferns and other seed plants, such as 
Bennettitales, Caytoniales, cycads, and Gnetales, present 
in understory environments at that time. Furthermore, 
these early angiosperms may have been successful because 
they had more developmental flexibility than these other 
lineages. Production of different types of leaves in varying 
light environments may have enabled early angiosperms to 
compete more effectively across a wider range of light re- 
gimes than other groups with more limited morphological 
plasticity (Feild et al. 2004). 
In contrast to Amborella and Austrobaileyales, Nym- 
phaeales possess ecological and physiological traits as- 
sociated with sunny to shady aquatic habitats, but some 
authors have proposed that their ecology and morphology 
may not be representative of the earliest angiosperms (e.g., 
Schneider and Williamson 1993). Nymphaeaceae are often 
believed to represent a separate and distinct evolutionary 
experiment that does not represent the ecology associated 
with the origin of the angiosperms (Feild et al. 2004). How- 
ever, as we have stressed, Amborella and Austrobaileyales 
may also not be representative of the earliest angiosperms. 
Fossils such as Archaefructus (Sun et al. 2002) and those 
attributable to Nymphaeaceae (Friis et al. 2001, 2009) in- 
dicate that the aquatic habit appeared early in angiosperm 
evolution. 
Several lines of evidence indicate that flowers of the hy- 
pothetical early angiosperms were likely small. The floral 
features of Amborella, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales 
suggest that the flowers of early angiosperms were not the 
large strobiloid structures envisioned by Cronquist (1968, 
1981) and Takhtajan (1969), but more likely were small to 
moderate in size. Further support for this view comes from 
the fossil record. The angiosperm reproductive structures 
(flowers, fruits, seeds) from the Early Cretaceous are also 
small (Friis et al. 2000, 2011; see Chapter 3). 
Our reconstructions of ancestral angiosperm floral phyl- 
lotaxis were equivocal—spiral vs. whorled. Amborella and 
Austrobaileyales have spiral phyllotaxis, but Nymphaeales 
have whorled. However, different flowers on the same plant 
of Drimys winteri may have spiral or whorled phyllotaxis 
(Doust 2001). Ontogenetic studies have revealed that, in 
some cases, floral organs that appear in a series in mature 
flowers actually result from spiral phyllotaxis; both spiral 
and whorled phyllotaxis may result from spiral organ de- 
velopment. Phyllotaxis is equivocal in some early angio- 
sperm fossil flowers (Friis et al. 2000, 2009, 2011). 
The perianth of early angiosperms was likely undiffer- 
entiated (a perianth of tepals), a view supported by our 
reconstructions and early fossils (Friis et al. 2011). Based 
on the flowers of Amborella and Schisandraceae, bracts 
preceding the flower may have been scarcely differentiated 
from the tepals. Alternatively, early angiosperms did not 
possess a perianth—this was added later. 
Cronquist 
(1968), Takhtajan 
(1969), and Stebbins 
(1974) envisioned early angiosperms with numerous (in- 
determinate) perianth parts, but in most of our reconstruc- 
tions the ancestral perianth merism is equivocal. Although 
Amborella and Austrobaileyales have an indeterminate 
number of perianth parts, this is not generally the case in 
non-eudicots. Importantly, our reconstructions point to an 
early and significant role of trimery in angiosperms. The 
ancestral condition for Nymphaeales is a trimerous peri- 
anth, as is the ancestral state for mesangiosperms. 
The multiple carpels in early angiosperms, as well as 
other floral organs, would have been free (not fused). 
Stamens likely were undifferentiated into anther and 
filament regions—that is, they were leaf-like (laminar) and 
similar to the inner tepals. The gradual transition from 
bracts to tepals to stamens and ultimately carpels is cur- 
rently reflected in the similarity and overlap in gene ex- 
pression patterns among these organs in living basal angio- 
sperms—in contrast, in eudicots and monocots the patterns 
of gene expression are highly canalized and differ between 
floral organs (Chanderbali et al. 2010; see Chapter 14). 
Pollen was likely uniaperturate in early angiosperms 
and exhibited a reticulate or “intermediate“ morphology 
(Doyle 2005, 2009) characterized by irregular radial (colu- 
mellar) elements mixed with granules. 
The early carpel was ascidiate and sealed by secretion 
(Endress and Igersheim 2000b). The actual number of 
ovules per carpel was low, perhaps one. The ancestral ovule 
curvature is unclear (orthotropous vs. anatropous). 
The ancestral state for the female gametophyte (four- 
celled vs. seven-celled) and endosperm (diploid vs. triploid) 
remains equivocal; triploid and diploid endosperm are 
equally parsimonious alternatives (Williams and Friedman 
2002). Endosperm formation was likely “bipolar cellular” 
(Floyd and Friedman 2000); seeds were likely few in num- 
ber and small, with copious endosperm produced. 
Major changes accompanied the evolution of the me- 
sangiosperms. Well-developed vessel elements were appar- 
ent. Perianth phyllotaxis was whorled, and our reconstruc- 
tions favor a trimerous ancestral state for mesangiosperms. 
Carpels became more or less plicate in several groups. Pat- 
terns of morphological and anatomical evolution within 
monocots and eudicots are covered in more detail in later 
chapters. 
Ancestral-state reconstructions are needed over trees 
that are more densely sampled than provided here. In ad- 
dition, these reconstructions may need to be repeated as 

the nuclear-based phylogeny of angiosperms becomes clear. 
Initial studies of numerous nuclear genes suggest possible 
differences in the placement of major clades (e.g., Chloran- 
thales) compared to the topologies based on plastid genes 
(see Chapter 3). Furthermore, more studies of anatomy and 
The Ancestral Angiosperm and General Trends 
129 
morphology are needed so that we have a clearer under- 
standing of these features as well as data for more than just 
a few exemplars per clade. In addition, the underlying de- 
velopmental genetics of many of these characters remains 
unknown and ripe for investigation. 

Monocots 
INTRODUCTION 
Several studies have examined phylogenetic placement of 
the monocotyledons (often shortened to monocots) relative 
to Ceratophyllaceae, eudicots, magnoliids, and Chloran- 
thaceae and found well-supported results (see also Chap- 
ter 3), but there still is no consensus about the exact place- 
ment of monocots relative to these other clades. Soltis et al. 
(2011) and recent analyses of plastid genomes (Gitzendan- 
ner pers. comm.) placed the monocots sister to Ceratophyl- 
laceae/eudicots. However, recent phylogenomic analyses 
of nuclear genes place monocots after the ANA grade as 
sister to all other angiosperms (Zeng et al. 2014; Leebens- 
Mack pers. comm.; see Chapter 3). Given that there are at 
least incongruent placements of monocots, more research 
is clearly needed before we can say with confidence where 
the monocots fit into the bigger picture of angiosperm re- 
lationships. It is possible to rule out some of the previous 
hypotheses (i.e., to Nymphaeales, see below, or Piperales, 
Burger 1977). 
Regardless of which of the above-noted hypotheses is 
correct, the monocots certainly represent one of the oldest 
lineages of angiosperms. The origin of the monocot clade 
must have occurred no later than the origin of the eudicot 
clade (see Chapters 3 and 8). Hence, given that eudicot pol- 
len dates to at least 125 million years ago (mya), the mono- 
cot lineage must also be that old, and molecular-based age 
estimates have supported this inference. Using varied data- 
sets and approaches, estimates range from 134 mya (Bremer 
2000, 2002), 127-141 mya (Sanderson 1997; Wikstrom 
et al. 2001; Sanderson et al. 2004), to 123-138 mya (Bell 
et al. 2010). Zeng et al. (2014) estimated the crown group 
age of the monocots to be in the Jurassic at 150 mya, and 
Hertweck et al. (2015), using the dataset of Chase et al. 
(2006) plus the low-copy nuclear gene PHYC, found the 
crown node to be 131 mya. These studies reach relatively 
consistent results, given the different datasets and methods 
employed. 
There are about 52,000 species of monocots (Mabber- 
ley 1993), representing 22% of all angiosperms (assum- 
ing only ~240,000 species of angiosperms, although many 
estimates are much higher). Half of the monocots can be 
found in the two largest families, Orchidaceae and Poaceae, 
which include 34% and 17%, respectively, of all monocots. 
These two families are also among the largest families of 
angiosperms, and Poaceae are dominant members of many 
plant communities. Although monocots are largely herba- 
ceous, some, particularly agaves, palms, pandans, and bam- 
boos, can reach great heights, lengths, and masses. Mono- 
cots provide most of the world’s staple foods (e.g., grains 
and starchy root crops), abundant building materials, and 
a great number of medicines. 
The single cotyledon is one of several putative synapo- 
morphies for the monocots. Phylogenetic studies of non- 
molecular data (Donoghue and Doyle 1989a,b; Loconte 
and Stevenson 1991; Doyle and Donoghue 1992) have 
identified many putative synapomorphies for the monocots 
(Table 7.1), including a single cotyledon, parallel-veined 
leaves, sieve-cell plastids with several cuneate protein crys- 
tals, scattered vascular bundles in the stem, and an adventi- 
tious root system. 
Recognition of the monocots as a distinct group dates 
from Ray (1703) and was based largely on their having a 
single cotyledon instead of the two cotyledons typical of

(Acoraceae) is not sister to the rest of the monocots. Acorus, for example, lacks 
steroidal saponins and has dicotyledonous anther formation, so if Acorus is 
sister to the rest of the monocots, then these are not synapomorphies for the 
monocots as a whole. 
the dicotyledons or “dicots.” (As reviewed in Chapter 3, 
the dicot grouping is now known to be a non-monophyletic 
group that is not a relevant point of comparison.) Monocot 
seedlings display a great diversity of form (Tillich 1995), 
however, and not all possess an obvious single cotyledon. 
In the grasses, for example, the single cotyledon has be- 
come an absorptive organ (for the food stored in the endo- 
sperm) within the seed. 
Another distinctive monocot trait is their vascular sys- 
tem, characterized by vascular bundles that are scattered 
throughout the medulla and cortex and closed (i.e., they 
do not contain an active cambium). In contrast, most basal 
angiosperms (e.g., members of the magnoliid clade, Am- 
borellaceae, Austrobaileyales) and eudicots possess vas- 
cular bundles in an open ring. Tomlinson (1995) argued 
that the vascular system of monocots is unique among 
the seed plants and so different that there is “no homol- 
ogy of organization between the primary vascular system 
of monocotyledons and dicotyledons.” However, scattered 
vascular bundles occur outside of the monocots (e.g., Nym- 
phaeaceae and some Piperaceae). Tomlinson’s statement 
emphasizes the distinctiveness of the monocot habit and 
vegetative organization and implies a fundamental devel- 
opmental reorganization. However, the floral features of 
monocots are similar to many other basal angiosperms, 
particularly members of the magnoliid clade such as Aris- 
tolochiaceae and Annonaceae. It is easy to see how one gets 
from a gymnosperm vascular system to that of a typical 
Monocots 
131 
(non-monocot) angiosperm but not from this type to that 
of a monocot. This also indicates the need to use genomic 
tools to better understand how the standard angiosperm 
habit became so reorganized that understanding of its ho- 
mology is unclear. 
The fact that the vascular bundles of monocots are 
scattered rather than arranged in a ring as in the woody 
basal angiosperms and eudicots means that orderly, bifacial 
growth of the vascular cambium is not possible. That is, 
secondary growth does not occur: in monocots as it does 
in eudicots and magnoliids. As a result, many arbores- 
cent monocots achieve their stature by primary gigantism. 
Palm “trees” (Arecaceae) and grass trees (Kingia, members 
of Dasypogonaceae) are overgrown herbs with primary 
“woody” stems; once laid down, the stems cannot increase 
in diameter through secondary accretion. Stems of palms 
and others such as the pandans (Pandanaceae) do become 
stiffer with age by means of increased cell-wall thickness 
and lignin deposits, but this is an entirely different process 
from that occurring in plants with a bifacial cambium. 
However, primary gigantism is not the only method by 
which monocots can achieve tree status. Other arborescent 
monocots, which are almost all members of Asparagales 
(see below), such as Agave, Cordyline, Dracaena (all As- 
paragaceae), and Aloe (Asphodelaceae), achieve their large 
stature by means of an “anomalous” secondary growth 
produced by an etagen or tiered cambium. This growth 
is unidirectional and therefore still not like that of other 
angiosperms. Outside of Asparagales, an etagen cambium 
is reported only in Dioscorea (Dioscoreales). The inability 
to produce a well-organized bifacial cambium has limited 
the evolution of growth form in the monocots, but they 
nevertheless exhibit considerable habit diversity. How this 
radical reorganization of the monocot stem occurred and 
from what sort of ancestral state it evolved are major un- 
answered problems in angiosperm evolution. 
Another widely cited monocot character is their particu- 
lar form of sieve cell plastids (Behnke 1969), which are tri- 
angular and have cuneate proteinaceous inclusions. Similar 
sieve cell plastids are found in Aristolochiaceae (Piperales; 
Dahlgren et al. 1985). We now infer that this similarity 
between monocots and Aristolochiaceae represents con- 
vergence, not shared ancestry, because DNA phylogenetic 
studies have demonstrated a strongly supported relation- 
ship of Aristolochiaceae to other Piperales within the mag- 
noliid clade to the exclusion of monocots (Chapter 3). 
Trimerous flowers have long been considered a uniting 
characteristic of the monocots, but it is not an exclusive 
feature because many other basal angiosperms, includ- 
ing Nymphaeaceae and magnoliids, also exhibit trimery. 
Character-state 
that 
trimery 
arose early in the angiosperms; it may be ancestral for 
reconstructions 
indicate 

132 Chapter 7 
angiosperms branching above Amborella (see Chapter 6). 
Trimery appears therefore to be a symplesiomorphic fea- 
ture in monocots and other angiosperms and is not there- 
fore a “monocot character.” Given the number of mono- 
cots, most with trimerous floral organization, and the 
relatively small number of trimerous non-monocots, this 
character still works most of the time for identification, 
but it should always be used in combination with the other 
traits discussed here. 
An often-overlooked synapomorphy for monocots is 
their sympodial growth. There are other sympodial an- 
giosperms, but monocots are nearly exclusively so. Even 
branched, arborescent genera, such as Aloe (Asphodela- 
ceae), are sympodial; new sympodia arise near the apex of 
the previous one and “displace” the terminal inflorescence 
into a lateral position, but these plants are nonetheless 
sympodial. Branching in arborescent monocots is achieved 
by production of more than one terminal sympodium, but 
such branching is limited by the demands it makes on the 
vascular system of older sympodia, which cannot expand 
to meet increased requirements (see Tomlinson 1995). 
PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES 
USING MORPHOLOGY 
Analysis of morphological characters to estimate relation- 
ships within monocots has been limited to those of Steven- 
son and Loconte (1995; 101 characters) and Chase et al. 
(1995b; 103 characters, compiled collectively by the par- 
ticipants of the 1993 Monocot Symposium at the Royal 
Botanic Gardens, Kew). These analyses reached similar 
conclusions about higher-level relationships in the mono- 
cotyledons, based on similar information. Both analyses 
used the same outgroups (Nymphaeales, Piperales, Lactori- 
dales, Aristolochiales, sensu Takhtajan), but arranged them 
in different ways. Stevenson and Loconte (1995) specified 
Lactoris (as Lactoridales at that time) as the ultimate out- 
group; Chase et al. (1995b) used a polytomy. As a result of 
this difference in rooting, Aristolochiales alone appeared as 
the sister group of the monocots in Stevenson and Loconte 
(1995). Stevenson and Loconte (1995) then claimed that 
their analysis demonstrated that Aristolochiales were the 
sister group of the monocots, but this conclusion was not a 
result of their analysis but a product of assumptions made 
before the analysis about how to arrange the outgroups. 
Chase et al.’s (1995b) results could have been arranged in 
the same way. 
The alismatids have commonly been considered as the 
most “primitive” monocots (Hallier 1905; Arber 1925; 
Hutchinson 1934; Cronquist 1968, 1981; Takhtajan 1969, 
1991; Stebbins 1974; Thorne 1976). Net-veined groups, 
such as Dioscoreales (Dahlgren et al. 1985) and Melan- 
thiales (Thorne 1992a,b), have also been considered most 
“primitive” among the monocots. As we stress throughout 
this book, it is pointless to refer to living taxa as “primi- 
tive” because all are mosaics of primitive and derived char- 
acters. The issues of which extant group exhibits the most 
“primitive” morphological traits and which is the sister 
of all others are not equivalent, although these statements 
have often been confounded. We can infer ancestral char- 
acter states via character-state reconstruction using the best 
estimate of phylogeny, as we have done throughout. 
Characters ancestral for monocots could be present in 
some derived groups via secondary derivation. Concomi- 
tantly, basal taxa can exhibit many morphological auta- 
pomorphies (derived traits; see Chapters 3, 4, and 6). Al- 
though Acorus has now been shown to be sister to all other 
monocots (e.g., Chase et al. 1993, 1995a,b, 2000a, 2006; 
Duvall et al. 1993a,b; Davis et al. 1998; Fuse and Tamura 
2000; Tamura et al. 2004; Givnish et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 
2011; Zeng et al. 2014), this does not imply that Acorus is 
“the most primitive monocot” in morphological terms. In 
fact, character-state reconstructions indicate that Acorus in 
general is highly derived in most morphological characters, 
but many of these are autapomorphies. 
A major effect of using a few basal angiosperms such 
as Aristolochiaceae as outgroups in strictly morphological 
analyses is a rooting among the monocots with net-veined 
leaves. The net-veined monocots were lumped in taxo- 
nomic treatments from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s (e.g., 
Cronquist 1981), and were largely referable to Dioscorea- 
les sensu Dahlgren et al. (1985). The net-veined monocots 
include members of Dioscoreaceae, Smilacaceae, Stemo- 
naceae, and Melanthiaceae (especially tribe Paridae, often 
treated as family Trilliaceae), as well as several smaller fami- 
lies. Any other rooting would have been difficult to imagine 
because most of the other major groups of monocots, in- 
cluding Acorus and the alismatids, have no counterpart in 
any other group of angiosperms; their habits are unique to 
monocots, a feature that is likely to polarize characters in 
such a manner as to make these groups occupy a derived 
place in cladograms based solely on morphology. Thus, it 
should have been no surprise to see Acorus and the alis- 
matids occupy relatively derived positions in the trees pro- 
duced by Chase et al. (1995b) and Stevenson and Loconte 
(h99S)s 
One advantage of using characters totally divorced from 
morphology in phylogenetic studies is that this approach 
can lead to new perspectives on old problems. Such is the 
case for the hypotheses that the alismatids are “primitive” 
monocots and that monocots were ancestrally aquatic 
(Henslow 1893; Hallier 1905; Arber 1925; Hutchinson 

1934; Cronquist 1968, 1981; Takhtajan 1969, 1991; Steb- 
bins 1974; Thorne 1976). The position occupied by alis- 
matids in the DNA analyses (see below) is consistent with 
them exhibiting a preponderance of traits that are ancestral 
among monocots and with the hypothesis that monocots 
had an aquatic origin, but neither of these ideas is one that 
could be reached by outgroup comparison. Ideas of these 
earlier authors were influenced by the morphological simi- 
larities of alismatid taxa such as Sagittaria and Butomus, 
which have magnoliid-type flowers with follicular fruits. 
Plesiomorphic characters in both Chase et al. (1995b) 
and Stevenson and Loconte (1995) included stem vessels 
present, leaf petiole of the Dioscoreales type, primary vena- 
tion palmate, secondary venation reticulate, and a eustele. 
These are all traits associated with plants occurring in for- 
est understory, and their occurrence is due to convergence 
(Givnish et al. 2006). Although not used in these analy- 
ses, a vining habit could be added to this list; Dioscoreales 
sensu Dahlgren et al. (1985) are mostly understory vines. 
Reproductive traits were also highly influenced in these 
analyses by the choice of outgroups (i.e., Nymphaeales, 
Piperales, Lactoridales, Aristolochiales sensu Takhtajan), 
and the following traits were plesiomorphic: differentiated 
perianth, stamen connectives protruding, lack of septal nec- 
taries, parietal placentation, and septicidal capsules (i.e., a 
syncarpous fruit). These are not characters that would be 
considered ancestral within monocots and are either ab- 
sent in, or not applicable to, the alismatids. Stevenson and 
Loconte (1995) posited Stemonaceae and Trilliaceae (now 
a synonym of Melanthiaceae) as the most early-diverging 
monocots. Taccaceae (now considered a synonym of Dio- 
scoreaceae; APG IV 2016 and Chapter 12) exhibited more 
ancestral states in Chase et al. (1995b). 
Both morphological analyses then followed with either 
a grade (Chase et al. 1995b) or clade (Stevenson and Lo- 
conte 1995) of the lilioid monocots (treated as Asparagales 
and Liliales below, and including Zingiberales in the trees 
of Stevenson and Loconte 1995) sister to a clade of alisma- 
tids and commelinids. Characters for the lilioid clade were 
not specified, but the short branch shown in Stevenson and 
Loconte (1995) indicates that there were probably only 
two synapomorphies. In the clade sister to the lilioids of 
Stevenson and Loconte (1995) was a grade of taxa associ- 
ated with either Velloziaceae or Bromeliaceae followed by 
clades composed of alismatids, including Araceae, and com- 
melinids (see below), except for Zingiberales, but including 
Acorus as sister to Typha and Sparganium (Typhaceae). In 
the Chase et al. (1995b) results, the lilioid grade was fol- 
lowed by a clade of Bromeliaceae/Velloziaceae, Zingibera- 
les, and alismatids and commelinids; Araceae were again 
associated with alismatids and Acorus with Sparganiaceae 
and Typhaceae. These associations of Alismatales (includ- 
Monocots 
133 
ing Araceae) and Acorus with Typhaceae and commelinids 
were mostly due to concerted convergence on traits adap- 
tive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats (several Commeli- 
nales, in particular, exhibit similar aquatic adaptations; 
e.g., Philydraceae and Pontederiaceae). 
Neither the Chase et al. (1995b) nor Stevenson and Lo- 
conte (1995) morphological analysis surmounted the issues 
of how to address the unique characters of the monocots, 
particularly those of Acorus and Alismatales, and the prob- 
lems this posed for determining the root by outgroup com- 
parison. The many earlier authors who supported the hy- 
pothesis of the “primitiveness” of the alismatids did not use 
an outgroup approach to arrive at this conclusion. Tomlin- 
son (1995) likewise had problems with the use of an extant 
“dicot” as a model starting point for addressing the issue of 
monocot vegetative architecture. 
MOLECULAR ANALYSES 
Due 
to intensive 
molecular 
study and frequent 
col- 
laboration, the monocots emerged early on as the best- 
characterized major clade of angiosperms (Chase 2004; 
Chase et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006). The earliest well- 
sampled DNA analyses of monocots were the rbcL analy- 
ses of Duvall et al. (1993a,b) and Chase et al. (1993). These 
analyses concluded that Acorus was sister to the rest of the 
monocots, but several critical taxa were still missing (e.g., 
Triuridaceae) or under- represented (e.g., only three alisma- 
tids were included). Duvall et al. (1993a,b) and Chase et al. 
(1993) did include at least some representatives of each of 
the three main contenders for “the most primitive mono- 
cot”: alismatids, Veratrum (Melanthiaceae), and Diosco- 
reales. Bharathan and Zimmer (1995) found that Acorus 
did not fall with the other monocots in their study of par- 
tial 18S rDNA sequences, but they did not sample many 
monocots (only 24). A large-scale sampling of 18S rDNA 
sequences for monocots did not emerge until the studies of 
D. Soltis et al. (2000) and Chase et al. (2000a); the latter 
used 159 species of monocots. 
In contrast to the morphological analyses of angiosperm 
relationships (Donoghue and Doyle 1989a,b; Loconte and 
Stevenson 1991; Doyle and Donoghue 1992), the rbcL 
analyses produced radically different ideas about the rela- 
tionships of monocots. Morphological analyses alternated 
between two positions for the monocots (e.g., Donoghue 
and Doyle 1989a,b): sister to either Nymphaeaceae or Aris- 
tolochiaceae. These studies coded monocots as a single ter- 
minal (as was generally done in morphological studies at 
that time to reduce the number of terminal taxa; see Chap- 
ter 3) and so presumed ideas of what constituted ancestral 
monocot traits undoubtedly played a major role in where 

134 Chapter 7 
the monocots were positioned. For the reasons stated above, 
these studies have a degree of circularity that is difficult to 
avoid, but certainly such problems are exacerbated by the 
use of single, synthetic terminals coded with putatively an- 
cestral monocot traits. Use of rbcL avoided such circularity 
and arrived at novel conclusions, not only for the position 
of monocots, but also for relationships within the mono- 
cots. In Chase et al. (1993), the monocots were positioned 
with some relationship to the magnoliids: Laurales, Mag- 
noliales, and Piperales (at that time termed the “paleoherb I 
clade”), but none of these relationships received bootstrap 
support above 50% (Chase and Albert 1998). 
Since the Chase et al. (1993) analysis, several studies of 
single, as well as combined, gene datasets have been ana- 
lyzed (D. Soltis et al. 1998, 2000, 2011; Qiu et al. 1999; 
P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen et al. 2000a; Zanis et al. 
2002, 2003; Hilu et al. 2003; Duvall et al. 2006; Zeng et al. 
2014), and only the last two of these studies plus Soltis 
et al. (2011) provided clear evidence for monocot relation- 
ships (see also Chapter 3). What is clear is that an exclusive 
relationship to either Nymphaeaceae or Aristolochiaceae is 
excluded. 
RELATIONSHIPS AND CHARACTER 
EVOLUTION WITHIN MONOCOTS 
Monocot phylogenetics have made immense strides over 
the past 20 years due primarily to the foci provided by the 
international monocot symposia held in 1993, 1998, 2003, 
2008, and 2013 
(at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Rudall 
et al. 1995; the Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney, Wilson and 
Morrison 2000; Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden, Co- 
lumbus et al. 2006; Natural History Museum of Denmark, 
Seberg et al. 2010; and the New York Botanical Garden, re- 
spectively). These meetings have focused attention both on 
what was known and, more importantly, on which groups 
needed additional research. As a result, we now know more 
about monocots than about any other major group of an- 
giosperms, a remarkable achievement given the paucity of 
information available in 1985 (Dahlgren et al. 1985). 
The overview presented here (Fig. 7.1) is based in large 
part on the three-gene analyses of Chase et al. (2000a) and 
D. Soltis et al. (2000), the seven-gene analysis of Chase 
et al. (2006), a large plastid DNA dataset of Graham et al. 
(2006), and a three-genome analysis of Hertweck et al. 
(2015, which used the seven genes of Chase et al. 2006, 
plus low-copy nuclear gene PHYC). The two most recent 
broad analyses of angiosperms, Soltis et al. (2011) and 
Zeng et al. (2014), have included enough monocots to con- 
firm the general patterns observed in the monocot-focused 
earlier studies. Givnish et al. (2010) used 81 plastid genes 
for 83 taxa, focusing on the commelinid order Poales. Kim 
et al. (2013) focused on Liliales and Seberg et al. (2012) 
and S. Chen et al. (2013) on Asparagales. Chase et al. 
(2006) included plastid rbcL, atpB, matK, and ndhF, mi- 
tochondrial atpA, 18S rDNA, and partial 26S rDNA. The 
patterns obtained in Chase et al. (2006) are like those in the 
other analyses, but the sampling was the most complete, 
except for the narrower work focusing on Poales (Givnish 
et al. 2010), Alismatales (Iles et al. 2013; Les and Tippery 
2013), Liliales (Kim et al. 2013), and Asparagales (Seberg 
et al. 2012; S. Chen et al. 2013). Davis et al. (2013) assem- 
bled a large matrix of taxa but had reasonably complete 
sampling for only rbcL and matK and a set of 60 plastid 
genes for about one-third of the taxa. Their interests were 
in examining contrasting patterns of support among these 
datasets rather than examining relationships of monocots 
per se. However, their overall results do not alter our ideas 
about relationships, and so this paper will not be discussed 
further. Below, we mention newer results only when they 
offer different relationships or stronger support than the 
earlier well-sampled (taxonomically) studies. 
All but two DNA analyses of monocots have placed 
Acorus alone as sister to all other monocots (Fig. 7.1). The 
first exception was the18S rDNA analysis of Bharathan 
and Zimmer (1995), in which Acorus was placed outside 
of the monocots, a result that must be considered spurious. 
Combining the 18S rDNA sequence data with sequences 
from rbcL and atpB (Chase et al. 2000a; D. Soltis et al. 
2000) resulted in strong support for the monophyly of 
monocots, as well as strong support for the monophyly of 
all monocots excluding Acorus. A re-analysis of rbcL and 
atpA (Davis et al. 2004) recovered an alismatid clade that 
contained Acorus. This deviating result is perplexing be- 
cause neither rbcL (Chase et al. 1993, 1999; Duvall et al. 
1993a,b) nor atpA (Davis et al. 1998) analyzed alone pro- 
duced such a position for Acorus. In contrast, studies that 
have used more genes have consistently found Acorus sister 
to the remaining monocots (e.g., Qiu et al. 1999, 2000; 
Zanis et al. 2002, 2003; Soltis et al. 2011; Iles et al. 2013; 
Zeng et al. 2014). 
The placement of Acorus as sister to all other mono- 
cots (Fig. 7.1; see also Fuse and Tamura 2000) strongly 
contradicts the morphological analyses of Chase et al. 
(199Sb) and Stevenson and Loconte (1995), but is consis- 
tent with the combined morphology/rbcL analysis of Chase 
et al. (1995b). Chase et al. (1995b) noted that the ingroup 
networks of the morphological and molecular trees were 
highly similar and that they differed most significantly in 
the point at which they were rooted by the outgroups. The 
potentially misleading effects of outgroup rooting from 
morphology-based data are discussed above. Chase et al.

*The position of Dasypogonales as shown here is based on the results of Hert- 
weck et al. (2015), which is contradicted by those of Givnish et al. (2010), but in 
the latter study the position of Dasypogonales was weakly supported. 
(1995b) also pointed out that the aquatic alismatids and 
the largely aquatic (helophytic) aroids and Acorus were 
nested in the morphological trees among other aquatic or 
semiaquatic taxa such as Pontederiaceae, Philydraceae, and 
Typhaceae. Discounting these two differences, all other 
patterns of relationship were similar. 
Following Acorus, monophyly of the remaining mono- 
cots is again strongly supported. Alismatales are sister 
to the remaining monocots (Fig. 7.1), and the remaining 
monocots form a well-supported clade. Within this remain- 
ing large clade are several component subclades: commeli- 
nids (including Arecales [now including Dasypogonaceae; 
see Chapter 12], Commelinales, Poales, and Zingiberales), 
Dioscoreales, Petrosaviales, Pandanales, Liliales, and As- 
paragales. All these groups now receive maximum support 
(in MP, ML, and Bayesian studies), and in general their in- 
terrelationships also receive strong support (Fig. 7.1), with 
the exception of Dasypogonaceae and Arecales, which even 
with the 81 plastid genes (Givnish et al. 2010) received only 
Monocots 
135 
57% and 56% bootstrap support as sister to Commelinales/ 
Zingiberales and Poales, respectively. The branching order 
above Alismatales 
is Dioscoreales/Pandanales, 
Liliales, 
and Asparagales/commelinids. The large low-copy nuclear 
dataset of Zeng et al. (2014) placed Liliales and Asparag- 
ales as sister taxa, but although support was high, taxon 
sampling was low. Soltis et al. (2011) recorded only moder- 
ate bootstrap support (86%) for the position of Liliales, but 
Asparagales as sister to the commelinids received bootstrap 
support of 94%. Within the commelinids, relationships of 
Arecales (including Dasypogonaceae, which was placed in 
Dasypogonales) relative to Commelinales/Zingiberales and 
Poales must still be considered unresolved. Only the eight- 
gene matrix of Hertweck et al. (2015) resolved the base 
of the commelinids with a relevant level of support; they 
placed Dasypogonaceae as sister to Arecaceae with 81% 
bootstrap support and this pair of families sister to the rest 
of the commelinids with 92% bootstrap support. 
ACORALES 
Acorales consist of the single family Acoraceae and one ge- 
nus Acorus. Prior to the molecular era, Acorus was typically 
considered an aberrant member of the aroid family, Araceae 
(Grayum 1987). On the basis of its highly divergent seedling 
morphology, Tillich (1985) stated that Acorus should be 
excluded from Araceae (Acoraceae was proposed by Mar- 
tynov in 1820; see APG II 2003). The treatment followed 
here, placing Acorus in its own family and monofamilial 
order, Acorales, has now been widely accepted (see Chapter 
12). Acorus has many atypical morphological features for a 
basal monocot, but it also has some that might be expected: 
dicotyledonous anther wall formation and ethereal oils, 
both of which are unique to Acorus among monocots at the 
basal nodes. Its habit with unifacial, ensiform leaves, inflo- 
rescence structure (a spadix-like structure of flowers with 
an undifferentiated perianth), syncarpous ovary, and berry- 
like fruits are not what would be expected for a “primitive” 
monocot based on traditional views (Fig. 7.2a). 
ALISMATALES 
Alismatales include Alismataceae, Aponogetonaceae, Ara- 
ceae, 
Butomaceae, 
Cymodoceaceae, 
Hydrocharitaceae, 
Juncaginaceae, Maundiaceae, Posidoniaceae, Potamogeto- 
naceae, Ruppiaceae, Scheuchzeriaceae, Tofieldiaceae, and 
Zosteraceae (several of these are illustrated in Fig. 7.2, and 
their relationships are depicted in Fig. 7.3). The mono- 
phyly of the order is well supported by molecular analyses 
(e.g., Chase et al. 1993, 1995a, 2000c; Duvall et al. 1993a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000; Iles et al. 2013; Les and Tippery 2013).

This circumscription of Alismatales includes those fami- 
lies that most authors have previously placed in the order 
(e.g., Cronquist 1981; Thorne 1992a,b; Takhtajan 1997) 
plus Araceae and Tofieldiaceae. At least some authors on 
morphological grounds referred Araceae to their own or- 
der with a possible close relationship to Arecales (e.g., 
Cronquist 1981); hence, the results of all molecular studies 
that placed Araceae with Alismatales were unanticipated 
(Fig. 7.1). The placement of Tofieldiaceae in this clade was 
also unexpected; these genera had been considered a sub- 
family or tribe of Melanthiaceae. 
Families of Alismatales share scales or glandular hairs at 
the nodes within the sheathing leaf bases, and the embryos 
are uniquely green. Araceae (Fig. 7.21) and Tofieldiaceae 
(3 genera, 27 species; North and South America, as well as 
Eurasia) are otherwise different from the remaining fami- 
lies in their inflorescence, floral structure, and habit (they 
are not aquatic and lack lacunae in their sterns). Flowers of 
Tofieldiaceae are nondescript and typical of monocots, ex- 
cept that some species have up to 12 stamens and a septici- 
dal capsule. A “calyculus” (a calyx-like structure composed 
of bracts or bractlets) underneath the flowers is present in 
most species. 
Araceae are by far the largest family of the order (106 
genera, 4,025 species; cosmopolitan); they are particularly 
diverse in the wet tropics, but some temperate genera (e.g., 
Arisaema) are also species-rich. Typically, Araceae are herbs 
with a distinct petiole and expanded lamina; their most dis- 
tinctive feature is their inflorescence, which has an often 
petaloid spathe and spadix of sessile flowers with an ex- 
panded sterile terminal portion that emits odors (Fig. 7.21). 
Many genera have separate male and female zones on the 
spadix. The duckweeds, five genera formerly placed in Lem- 
naceae (Les et al. 1997b; Rothwell et al. 2003), are embed- 
ded in Araceae and included there; these are the smallest of 
all angiosperms. Even in Soltis et al. (2011) and Iles et al. 
(2013), the position of Tofieldiaceae relative to Araceae and 
the core alismatids continued to be unresolved. 
The remaining Alismatales have often been termed 
“core Alismatales” and are well supported by DNA se- 
quence data as well as non-DNA characters (Fig. 7.3). All 
these families have seeds that lack endosperm and root hair 
cells that are shorter than other epidermal cells (Judd et al. 
2002). Members of this large subclade occur in wetland or 
aquatic habitats, and Judd et al. (2002, 2008) referred to 
these families as the aquatic clade; Les and Tippery (2013) 
referred to them as Alismatidae and the subclades within 
as orders. The aquatic clade is divided into two subclades. 
The first subclade, the petaloid clade, is smaller and com- 
prises Alismataceae (Fig. 7.2c,d), Butomaceae (Fig. 7.2e), 
and Hydrocharitaceae (Fig. 7.2j); these have a scapose in- 
florescence, a differentiated calyx and corolla (in most), 
Monocots 
137 
and exotestal seeds. Alismataceae (12 genera; 88 species, 
including Limnocharitaceae; Soros and Les 2002; Iles et al. 
2013; Les and Tippery 2013) are emergent aquatics and are 
linked by having latex, leaves with a pseudopetiole with a 
midvein and cross veins, spinose-pantoporate pollen, and a 
follicular fruit. Hydrocharitaceae are the largest family of 
this subclade (18 genera; 116 species) and are submersed 
aquatics, some of which are marine (e.g., Halophila, Enha- 
lus, and Thalassia), with petiolate, usually undifferentiated 
leaves, an inflorescence with two bracts underneath, and an 
inferior ovary (the rest of this subclade has superior ova- 
ries). Pollination biology of this family is particularly di- 
verse (Tanaka et al. 2013). Butomaceae (monospecific) are 
monopodial with two-ranked, three-angled leaves and an 
umbel-like inflorescence. As in Araceae and Alismataceae, 
members of Butomaceae have a differentiated perianth and 
a follicular fruit. 
The second subclade, the tepaloid clade, consists of Apo- 
nogetonaceae, Cymodoceaceae (Fig. 7.2k), Juncaginaceae 
(Fig. 7.2f), Maundiaceae, Posidoniaceae, Potamogetona- 
ceae (Fig. 7.2h,i), Ruppiaceae (Fig. 7.2g), Scheuchzeriaceae, 
and Zosteraceae (Fig. 7.3). Scheuchzeriaceae are highly

apomorphic and not clearly linked by morphological char- 
acters to the rest of this subclade. The family is monospe- 
cific and has two-ranked, auriculate leaves, and a racemose 
inflorescence with several bracts; as in the other subclade, 
the fruit is a follicle. The rest of the subclade shares more or 
less linear leaves and (except for Aponogetonaceae) united 
carpels and an unusual condition in which the perianth ap- 
pears to be an “outgrowth” of the stamens. Aponogetona- 
ceae are monogeneric (43 species) and typically have peti- 
olate leaves, parallel venation and cross veins, and small 
spicate flowers with tepals. Juncaginaceae (3 genera; 14 spe- 
cies) and Maundiaceae (1 species) are emergent aquatic to 
terrestrial plants (but still of wet sites) and have imperfect 
flowers often lacking a perianth or with the perianth inter- 
nal to the stamens. Maundiaceae were only recently recog- 
nized as a distinct family (von Mering and Kadereit 2010; 
Iles et al. 2013); formerly included in Juncaginaceae, they 
fall as sister to the clade of Cymodoceaceae, Posidoniaceae, 
Potamogetonaceae, Ruppiaceae, and Zosteraceae, and we 
have thus recognized them here. The rest of the families are 
all rhizomatous, water-pollinated aquatics, with ascidiate 
carpels. Posidoniaceae (monogeneric; 5 species), Ruppia- 
ceae (perhaps monospecific), and Cymodoceaceae (5 gen- 
era; 16 species) are largely marine with two-ranked leaves 
and filiform pollen. Ruppiaceae (Fig. 7.2g) might better be 
included in Posidoniaceae; these families are highly similar 
in most respects. Zosteraceae (2 genera; 14 species) and 
Potamogetonaceae (7 genera; 122 species; Fig. 7.2h,i) share 
a leaf with an apical pore (i.e., their sheaths are closed), 
although the former is marine and the latter in freshwater. 
Zosteraceae are seagrasses with linear leaves, leaf-opposed 
branches, and spadix-like inflorescences enclosed 
in a 
spathe (see analysis by Les et al. 2002). Potamogetonaceae 
have petiolate leaves with a midvein and a spicate inflores- 
cence densely packed with flowers in which there is a tepal 
opposing each stamen. Pollination is commonly by wind, 
on the water surface, or in the water. 
Some have suggested that the “flowers” of Alismatales, 
except for Araceae and Tofieldiaceae, are modified inflo- 
rescences (Buzgo 2001; Rudall 2003), which could explain 
the wide variety of floral types in these families. For a small 
clade, floral diversity is exceptionally high in Alismatales, 
and their pollination mechanisms are among the most bi- 
zarre in the angiosperms (Cox and Humphries 1993). 
Alismatales contain several families adapted to marine 
habitats. This feature has apparently evolved independently 
several times in the order, once in Hydrocharitaceae, and 
perhaps several additional times in the seagrass families 
Zosteraceae, Cymodoceaceae, Ruppiaceae, and Posidonia- 
ceae (Les et al. 1997a). Marine angiosperms are confined 
to this order. 
PETROSAVIALES 
Relationships of Petrosaviaceae (Petrosavia, 3 species, and 
Japonolirion, one species, Fig. 7.2b) were uncertain until 
Chase et al. (2006). They are strongly supported as the sis- 
ter group of all monocots except Acorales and Alismatales 
(Fig. 7.1; Chase et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006), which 
necessitates their elevation to an order. Until DNA placed 
the two genera together (Chase et al. 2000a), Petrosavia 
and Japonolirion had not been considered closely related. 
Dahlgren et al. (1985) placed Petrosavia in Melanthia- 
les, but did not list Japonolirion at all. Takhtajan (1997) 
placed Petrosaviaceae in their own order in Triurididae 
and Japonoliriaceae in Melanthiales of Liliidae. Cameron 
et al. (2003) reviewed the morphology of Petrosavia and 
Japonolirion and found several similarities, including a 
lack of completely fused carpels. Japonolirion is photosyn- 
thetic, whereas Petrosavia is achlorophyllous and mycotro- 
phic. Both are rhizomatous herbs with spirally arranged 
leaves or bracts on racemes; microsporogenesis is simul- 
taneous. 
PANDANALES 
In Chase et al. (2006), Dioscoreales + Pandanales was 
found to be sister to all remaining monocots (Figs. 7.1, 
7.4). A close relationship of Pandanales to Dioscoreales 
was not observed until Chase et al. (2006), in which this 
pair of orders received 92% bootstrap support; it has been 
well supported in all subsequent analyses. However, non- 
DNA characters linking these two orders are unknown. 
Pandanales comprise Cyclanthaceae (12 genera, 225 
species; tropical America; Figs. 7.4, 7.5j), Pandanaceae 
(3 genera, 805 species; West Africa to the Pacific; Fig. 7.5h), 
Stemonaceae (3 genera, 25 species; tropical East Asia to 
Australia with a disjunct genus in eastern North America; 
Fig. 7.51), Triuridaceae (8 genera, 48 species; pantropical), 
and Velloziaceae (9 genera, 240 species; nearly pantropical; 
Fig. 7.5g). Within Pandanales, Cyclanthaceae and Pandan- 
aceae form a well-supported clade to which Stemonaceae 
are sister. The closest relatives of Triuridaceae and Vellozia- 
ceae within Pandanales remain unclear (see below). 
A close relationship of Cyclanthaceae (Fig. 7.5j) and 
Pandanaceae (Fig. 7.5h) had long been hypothesized (e.g., 
Dahlgren et al. 1985); the two families are sisters in the 
morphological analyses of Chase et al. (1995b) and Steven- 
son and Loconte (1995). Cyclanthaceae and Pandanaceae 
share compound bundles in their stems, imperfect flowers, 
an indehiscent syncarpous fruit, and a nonphotosynthetic 
cotyledon. These two families have several instances of

gigantism and can be either long vines (Cyclanthaceae and 
Pandanaceae) or large tree-like herbs (Pandanaceae). 
Stemonaceae, a small family of mostly vines, have previ- 
ously been associated with Dioscoreaceae (e.g., Cronquist 
1981; Dahlgren et al. 1985); their association with Cyclan- 
thaceae and Pandanaceae in molecular analyses was unex- 
pected. In Chase et al. (2000a) and D. Soltis et al. (2000), 
Pandanales received very strong (99% bootstrap or jack- 
knife) support. Cyclanthaceae and Pandanaceae share te- 
tramerous (or at least not trimerous) flowers and parietal 
placentation; they differ in having broad leaves with a peti- 
ole and net venation and a dehiscent fruit. Velloziaceae had 
been frequently placed with Bromeliaceae, as in Dahlgren 
et al. (1985). In D. Soltis et al. (2000), Velloziaceae are sis- 
ter to Stemonaceae, a relationship that received low (75% 
jackknife) support, but in Chase et al. (2006), the former 
is well supported (100% bootstrap) as sister to all other 
Pandanales if Triuridaceae (represented only by 18S rDNA 
sequence data; see next paragraph) were excluded from 
the analysis. Graham et al. (2006) also had Velloziaceae 
well supported as sister to the rest of Pandanales. Char- 
acters supporting the position of Velloziaceae in Pandana- 
les are unknown; all Pandanales have small embryos and 
a nucellar cap. Velloziaceae can become woody, but they 
achieve this as in Pandanaceae, by being giant herbs with 
toughened stems. Flowers of Velloziaceae (Fig. 7.5g) are 
the most plesiomorphic in Pandanales (Sajo et al. 2013), 
which explains why they were difficult to place, given that 
many of their characteristics are also plesiomorphic across 
monocots. Some (e.g., Behnke et al. 2000) have considered 
Acanthochlamys (one species, from China) too different 
from the rest of Velloziaceae to be included in the family 
(and treated it as Acanthochlamydaceae), but its position 
as sister to Velloziaceae s.s. is well supported, so it seems 
better to keep it as a divergent genus in the family (Mello- 
Silva et al. 2011). 
The position of Triuridaceae is mostly based on 18S 
rDNA sequence data (Chase et al. 2000a, 2006), and this 
relationship was also unsuspected; most authors consid- 
ered Triuridaceae to be related to Alismatales because they 
shared several characters with those families (and were 
placed there in the morphological analyses of Chase et al. 
1995b, but not in Stevenson and Loconte 1995). The posi- 
tion of the anthers inside the carpel whorl in Lacandonia 
and the complexity and diversity of flowers in Triuridaceae 
have led some authors to speculate that, like several other 
families of Pandanales (e.g., Cyclanthaceae and Pandana- 
ceae), the “flowers” of Triuridaceae are really inflorescences 
(Rudall 2003). In Mennes et al. (2013) and Hertweck et al. 
(2015), Sciaphila (Triuridaceae) is sister to the rest of Pan- 
danales except for Velloziaceae (Fig. 7.4).

DIOSCOREALES 
Dioscoreales have a long history of recognition, but not 
in the circumscription used in APG (APG 1998; APG II 
2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). In APG III (2009) and 
APG IV (2016), the order included only Burmanniaceae, 
Dioscoreaceae, and Nartheciaceae. Some may want to in- 
clude Burmanniaceae in Dioscoreaceae because Merckx 
et al. (2006) demonstrated a more complex set of relation- 
ships than had previously been shown by Caddick et al. 
(2002a). Most previous circumscriptions (e.g., Dahlgren 
et al. 1985) included in Dioscoreales nearly all lilioid mono- 
cots with net-veined leaves, and thus they comprised a set 
of families now known to be unrelated, such as Smilaca- 
ceae, Stemonaceae, and Trilliaceae. Nartheciaceae were not 
included in Dioscoreales by Chase et al. (1993, 1995a,b), 
but other analyses have consistently placed them as sister 
to Dioscoreaceae (Chase et al. 2000c, 2006; Caddick et al. 
2002a), although not with bootstrap support above 70% 
until the seven-gene analysis of Chase et al. (2006) put 
them there with 99% bootstrap support. Nartheciaceae are 
a small family (four or five genera; Fig. 7.5f) that deviates 
in morphology from the general patterns found in the other 
family of the order, Dioscoreaceae, but they do share with 
Dioscoreaceae a perianth persistent on the fruit, as well as 
micromorphological characters (e.g., a tanniferous exoteg- 
men and a short embryo). Like Tofieldiaceae (see above), 
Nartheciaceae are relatively poorly studied. 
Dioscoreaceae in the broad sense (17 genera; 926 spe- 
cies; Fig. 7.5c,d) could include Burmanniaceae (13 genera; 
126 species). Dioscoreaceae s.s. and Burmanniaceae share 
reflexed stamens, inferior, winged ovaries (although some 
genera of each family lack this feature), and simultane- 
ous microsporogenesis (the last trait rare in monocots); 
the groups are otherwise dissimilar, but this would not be 
unexpected given their different life-history strategies. Bur- 
manniaceae are rhizomatous mycoparasites, but some of 
them are green and have small leaves (Fig. 7.5a), whereas 
Dioscoreaceae s.s. are free-living and often vines (Fig. 7.5c), 
some with large underground storage organs. On the basis 
of characters that are convergent due to the mycoparasitic 
syndrome, many authors had suggested that Burmannia- 
ceae were related to the orchids (e.g., Cronquist 1981), but 
this is now completely discredited. 
Many authors have separated out several additional fam- 
ilies from Dioscoreaceae (e.g., Taccaceae, Trichopodaceae, 
Thismiaceae), but they do have shared characters (Caddick 
et al. 2002a,b). Taccaceae (Fig. 7.5d) were included in Dio- 
scoreaceae (Caddick et al. 2002a,b; APG II 2003; APG III 
2009). Likewise, several authors (e.g., Dahlgren et al. 1985) 
separated Thismiaceae from Burmanniaceae, but because 
they fell together in Caddick et al. (2002a,b) and share 
Monocots 
141 
most of their characters (Thismia, Fig. 7.5e, and its rela- 
tives, such as Afrothismia, Triscyphus, and Geomitra, being 
only somewhat more reduced vegetatively than many Bur- 
manniaceae s.s.), APG (APG II 2003; APG III 2009) placed 
these two families together in Burmanniaceae. Merckx 
et al. (2006) showed that Thismia and relatives fell with 
Tacca, the pair then sister to Dioscorea, and to this clade 
Burmannia and its relatives were sister. Given that recog- 
nition of Thismiaceae would then require resurrection of 
Taccaceae, it seems more practical to some investigators to 
lump them all into Dioscoreaceae, based on their readily 
observable shared characteristics (reflexed stamens and in- 
ferior, winged ovaries, although these features may not be 
consistently present). Based on the lack of resolution of this 
issue, APG IV (2016) has retained Burmanniaceae, Diosco- 
reaceae, and Nartheciaceae in Dioscoreales and noted that 
more data are needed before changes can be intelligently 
made (see Chapter 12). 
In addition, Merckx et al. (2006) did not include the 
other genera of Dioscoreaceae, which raises the issue of 
having to resurrect them as families (e.g., Trichopodaceae), 
leading to many narrowly defined families in this order. 
In Hertweck et al. (2015), Thismia/Burmannia are sister 
to Tacca + Trichopus and Dioscorea. These differing re- 
sults could be due to the different taxon sampling or the 
genes/regions used, but given the problems with circum- 
scribing families when the phylogenetic trees are different, 
one option is to recognize Dioscoreaceae s.l. and let spe- 
cialists sort out these problematic relationships. However, 
others have already recognized the separate families (but 
not so far Trichopodaceae), and clearly more research is 
needed. In Chapter 12 we provide the option of recogniz- 
ing Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae s.s., Nartheciaceae, and 
Taccaceae. The evidence that they are related is clear, but 
in exactly which way is disputed. There are other families 
with mycoparastic as well as photosynthetic genera, and 
a transition from forest-adapted, broad-leaved herbs such 
as Tacca, Avetra, and some species of Dioscorea to dark 
forest-dwelling mycoparasitic herbs is similar to that ob- 
served in orchids. 
LILIALES 
Liliales sensu APG appear to be sister to Asparagales plus 
the large commelinid clade (Figs. 7.1, 7.4), although as 
mentioned above, this is not as strongly supported as other 
parts of the monocot tree; Zeng et al. (2014) with mini- 
mal sampling of taxa showed Liliales and Asparagales to 
be sister clades. Liliales comprise 10 families and about 
1,300 species. The concept of Liliales as distinct from other 
lilioid taxa such as Asparagales and Dioscoreales originated 

142 Chapter 7 
with Huber (1969, 1977), whose ideas were then adopted 
by Dahlgren et al. (1985). Nearly all of these taxa were 
considered to be closely related, perhaps even members of a 
single family, Liliaceae. Cronquist (1981) lumped these and 
other families such as Velloziaceae and Pontederiaceae into 
his subclass Liliidae, but if they were not arborescent or did 
not have net-veined leaves, then he dumped them in Lilia- 
ceae. The broad concepts of Liliidae and Liliaceae were for- 
mulated because the patterns of characters did not indicate 
clear-cut groupings, and those authors who did segregate 
some genera into other families never did so consistently. 
For example, Cronquist (1981) segregated Aloe and some 
of its close relatives into Aloaceae, largely because Aloe 
had some arborescent species and the other genera were 
highly succulent (e.g., Haworthia and its relatives), but re- 
tained the closely related Bulbine in Liliaceae because it 
was strictly herbaceous. However, Kniphofia is herbaceous 
and not succulent but was retained in Aloaceae because its 
flowers and inflorescences were “aloeoid.” Dahlgren et al. 
(1985) kept both Bulbine and Kniphofia in Asphodelaceae, 
whereas he placed the others in Aloaceae because of their 
shared strongly bimodal and nearly identical karyotypes 
(both families were in Asparagales due to their phytomela- 
nous seeds; see below). 
Chase et al. (1993) and Duvall et al. (1993a) identified 
a Liliales clade containing Alstroemeriaceae, Colchicaceae, 
Liliaceae, Melanthiaceae, and Smilacaceae. Huber (1977) 
and Dahlgren et al. (1985) also recognized Liliales, but they 
included Iridaceae and Orchidaceae, whereas in the DNA 
studies these two families appeared as part of Asparagales 
(see below). Huber (1977) and Dahlgren et al. (1985) ex- 
cluded Melanthiaceae and Campynemataceae (as Melan- 
thiales), which the DNA studies have consistently indicated 
to be members of Liliales. Chase et al. (1995a) added Lu- 
zuriagaceae, Philesiaceae, Smilacaceae, and Rhipogonaceae 
to the order, but they also placed here genera that previ- 
ously had been referred to Calochortaceae (now in Lilia- 
ceae), Trilliaceae (now in Melanthiaceae), and Uvulariaceae 
(genera now in Colchicaceae or Liliaceae). Recently, Kim 
et al. (2013) produced a better-supported analysis of this 
order based on four plastid DNA regions, but relationships 
and family circumscriptions remain as they were in APG III 
(2009) and APG IV (2016). 
Liliales sensu APG (APG 1998; APG II 2003; APG III 
2009; APG IV 2016) are mostly geophytes bearing ellipti- 
cal leaves with fine reticulate venation; their flowers have 
various forms of tepalar nectaries, extrorsely dehiscent an- 
thers, and, often, spotted tepals. The morphological anal- 
yses of Chase et al. (1995b) and Stevenson and Loconte 
(1995) variously placed Alstroemeriaceae, Colchicaceae, 
Liliaceae, and Melanthiaceae in a clade, but the other fami- 
lies of Liliales sensu APG fell elsewhere; Iridaceae were also 
included in Liliales in morphological studies. Relationships 
of the families within this clade are discussed in Rudall 
et al. (2000), Vinnersten and Bremer (2001), and Kim et al. 
(2013). Alstroemeriaceae (5 genera, 170 species; tropical 
and temperate Central and South America and Australia/ 
New Zealand; Fig. 7.6k) include Luzuriagaceae (formerly 
2 genera; 5 species); they share vegetative features such as 
being vines with the leaves twisted such that the develop- 
mentally upper surface is lowermost at maturity, although 
the ovary is superior in Luzuriaga and Drymophila. Sis- 
ter to these is Colchicaceae (18 genera, 224 species; Fig. 
7.6a,c), which are native principally to the Old World, the 
only exception being. Uvularia (north temperate; Fig. 7.6b). 
Colchicaceae have been studied in more detail in Chacon 
et al. (2014). Some genera of Colchicaceae exhibit the 
twisted leaves of Alstroemeriaceae. Colchicine alkaloids 
(which are used to inhibit spindle formation and cause 
nondisjunction at meiosis, leading to polyploid offspring) 
are found in all members of the family. Petermannia was in- 
cluded in Colchicaceae in APG (APG 1998; APG II 2003), 
but it is now known that the DNA used came from a plant 
of Tripladenia cunninghamii (Colchicaceae) that had been 
misidentified as Petermannia (Kim et al. 2013). Real mate- 
rial of Petermannia is sister to Melanthiaceae (Kim et al. 
2013), so Petermanniaceae (Fig. 7.4) has been reinstated 
(APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
; 
Melanthiaceae (Fig. 7.6f,g; 16 genera; 170 species) were 
studied by Zomlefer et al. (2001), Pellicer et al. (2013), 
and Kim et al. (2016); the family now includes the mem- 
bers of former Trilliaceae (APG II 2003; APG IV 2016; see 
Chapter 12). All genera have a north temperate distribu- 
tion; a single genus, Schoenocaulon, occurs as far south as 
Peru, but it may have been taken there by humans (they 
are medicinal plants). The family contains potent alkaloids 
that provide some of their common names (e.g., fly poison, 
death camas). Xerophyllum (two species in North America) 
is sister to the genera of the former Trilliaceae (Chase et al. 
1995a,b; Rudall et al. 2000; Pellicer et al. 2013; Kim et al. in 
press). Species of Xerophyllum are xerophytically adapted 
(narrow, grass-like leaves and tufted rosette habit), which 
contrasts sharply with Trillium and its relatives, which are 
adapted to forest understories and have net-veined leaves. 
Paris japonica holds the record for the largest plant genome 
(Pellicer et al. 2010), and other members of the former Tril- 
liaceae are similarly large, although not Xerophyllum, their 
sister genus. Some authors (Thorne 1992a,b) considered 
Veratrum (Melanthiaceae) to be one of the most “primi- 
tive” monocots because of its plicate, net-veined leaves and 
mostly unfused carpels, but it is deeply embedded within 
Liliales and not at all close to the root of the monocots, 
meaning that it is unlikely to have retained these as primary 
ancestral features.

144 Chapter 7 
Liliaceae sensu APG (see Chapter 10) are composed 
of many fewer genera than in most previous circumscrip- 
tions (e.g., Cronquist 1981). However, the APG concept is 
broader than that of others who would limit the family to 
just the core genera related to Lilium (Fig. 7.6d; Tamura 
1998) by excluding Calochortus, Prosartes, Tricyrtis (Fig. 
7.6e), and others, and placing these in Calochortaceae and/ 
or Tricyrtidaceae. Liliaceae are exclusively north temper- 
ate and composed of geophytes with spotted flowers, ex- 
trorsely dehiscing anthers, and a superior ovary. Related 
to Liliaceae 
are Smilacaceae 
(Fig. 7.61,j; monogeneric, 
315 species; nearly cosmopolitan), Philesiaceae (2 mono- 
specific genera; southern South America; Fig. 7.6h), and 
Rhipogonaceae 
(monogeneric, 
6 species; 
Australasia), 
but non-DNA characters that reflect this pattern are un- 
known. Smilacaceae, Philesiaceae, and Rhipogonaceae all 
have unique spiny pollen (Rudall et al. 2000), but in most 
analyses they have not formed a clade. In Kim et al. (2013), 
they do form a clade but with poor support; Rhipogonum 
is recovered as sister to Philesia/Lapageria, so it could be 
combined with them, but Smilax has generally been found 
to be sister to Liliaceae (but never with good support). If 
the Kim et al. (2013) topology is supported by subsequent 
studies with greater amounts of data, then these three could 
be combined, given their shared characters. 
Melanthiaceae, Campynemataceae (2 genera, 4 species; 
Australasia), and Corsiaceae (3 genera, 30 species; China, 
South America, and Australasia) have had an unclear 
pattern of relationships to the other members of Liliales 
(Fig. 7.4), but in Kim et al. (2013), without including Corsi- 
aceae, the result is Campynemataceae sister to the rest, fol- 
lowed by Colchicaceae, Pertermanniaceae/Melanthiaceae, 
and the rest of Liliales. Mennes et al. (2015) demonstrated 
that Corsiaceae (represented by Corsia and Arachnitis) are 
monophyletic and sister to Campynemataceae using nu- 
clear, mitochondrial, and plastid sequence data. 
Campynemataceae were previously considered to be 
related to Melanthiaceae (Dahlgren et al. 1985) because 
of their mostly unfused carpels, whereas Corsiaceae were 
considered to be related to Burmanniaceae because of 
their shared mycoparasitic 
life history. However, both 
suites of characters are unreliable; unfused (free) carpels 
are potentially a symplesiomorphy, whereas the syndrome 
of traits associated with mycoheterotrophy is convergent 
even between eudicots and monocots with this life history. 
Campynemataceae and Corsiaceae generally fit the pat- 
tern of characters observed among the families of Liliales, 
and Hertweck et al. (2015) found Arachnitis to be sister to 
Campynemataceae (Fig. 7.4). 
ASPARAGALES 
Asparagales had originally been suggested by Huber 
(1977) and later adopted by Dahlgren et al. (1985). As- 
paragales are sister to the commelinid clade (Figs. 7.1, 7.4) 
in most analyses, except for Zeng et al. (2014), which has 
sparse taxonomic sampling, and in which they are sister 
to Liliales. Asparagales comprise 14 families: Amarylli- 
daceae (including Agapanthaceae and Alliaceae; 60 gen- 
era, 1,605 species; nearly cosmopolitan), Asparagaceae 
(including Agavaceae, Aphyllanthaceae, Hyacinthaceae, 
Laxmanniaceae, Ruscaceae, and Themidaceae; 120 genera, 
2,640 species; nearly cosmopolitan, but rare in the wet trop- 
ics), Asteliaceae (4 genera, 36 species; mostly Australasia), 
Blandfordiaceae (monogeneric with 4 species; southeast- 
ern Australia), Boryaceae (2 genera, 12 species; Australia), 
Doryanthaceae (monogeneric with 2 species; southeastern 
Australia), as well as the closely related Ixioliriaceae and 
Tecophilaeaceae (9 genera, 24 species; Central Asia, Af- 
rica, Madagascar, Chile, and California), Hypoxidaceae 
(7 genera, 200 species; nearly cosmopolitan but not in Eu- 
rope), Iridaceae (67 genera, perhaps more, 1,800 species; 
cosmopolitan), Lanariaceae (monospecific; South Africa), 
Orchidaceae (736 genera, 27,135 species; cosmopolitan, 
but particularly diverse in the cool wet tropics), Asphodela- 
ceae (including Xanthorrhoeaceae and Hemerocallidaceae; 
35 genera, 900 species; mostly Old World, particularly 
— 
Australia, mostly temperate), and Xeronemataceae (mono- 
generic with 2 species; an island off New Zealand and New 
Caledonia). Another option preferred by some is to main- 
tain many of the families subsumed above—see Chapter 12 
(compare Fig. 7.4 with Supplementary Fig. 7.1 at press 
.uchicago.edu/sites/soltis/). 
The preeminent characters 
uniting Re 
are 
their phytomelanous (a dark, non-cellular material) seed 
coat and collapsed/obliterated outer epidermis. Many As- 
paragales with superior ovaries have septal nectaries, and 
geophytes are common, although in this case their leaves 
are mostly linear without reticulate fine-scale venation. 
Anomalous secondary growth with a tiered (etagen) meri- 
stem is nearly confined to the genera of this clade (outside 
this clade, it is known only in Dioscorea). Some species 
of Agave, Aloe, Cordyline, Dracaena, Nolina, and Yucca 
become massive, short trees (rarely more than five meters 
tall), generally, but not always, with limited branching (e.g., 
Aloe, Dracaena, and Yucca). Other genera (e.g., Aphyl- 
lanthes and Lomandra) have this same type of secondary 
growth confined to their underground stems. In the mor- 
phological analyses of Chase et al. (1995b) and Stevenson 
and Loconte (1995), at least some of these genera of Aspar- 
agales formed clades, although members of Liliales (Chase 
et al. 199Sb) and Zingiberales and Pandanales (Stevenson 

and Loconte 1995) also fell among cheer Seed anatomy 
would appear to be the best set of characters for the order, 
the members of which are otherwise heterogeneous, par- 
ticularly considering that Orchidaceae are members of this 
clade (see below). 
Orchidaceae (Fig. 7.7g) are one of the two largest fami- 
lies of angiosperms (the other is Asteraceae), and their 
infrafamilial relationships are clearly resolved and well 
supported (e.g., Dressler 1983, 1993; Chase 1986, 1988; 
Chase and Hills 1992; Chase and Palmer 1992; Cameron 
et al. 1999; Kores et al. 2000; Whitten et al. 2000; Sala- 
zar et al. 2003; Cameron 2004, 2006; Gorniak et al. 2010; 
Chase et al. 2015). Some (e.g., Dahlgren et al. 1985) rec- 
ognized three families of orchids on the basis of anther 
morphology: Apostasiaceae (2 genera; 2 or 3 anthers only 
partially fused to the gynoecium), Cypripediaceae (5 gen- 
era; 2 anthers fused to the gynoecium), and Orchidaceae 
(the rest, all with a single anther fused to the gynoecium). 
All molecular evidence (summarized in Chase et al. 2003) 
shows that this three-family view (Dahlgren et al. 1985) 
is non-monophyletic. Analyses indicate instead a broadly 
defined Orchidaceae; within this family, five subfamilies are 
now recognized with the following relationships: Apostasi- 
oideae (Vanilloideae (Cypripedioideae (Orchidoideae, Epi- 
dendroideae))). Thus, reduction to one anther occurred at 
least twice in the evolution of the orchids. A new phyloge- 
netic classification of Orchidaceae was published by Chase 
et al. (2003, with an update in 2015). 
Orchidaceae are sister to the rest of Asparagales (Fig. 
7.4); Chase et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006; Pires et al. 
2006; S. Chen et al. 2013; Hertweck et al. 2015), and it is 
clear that no single family of Asparagales is closely related 
to orchids. In spite of being a member of the same clade as 
the rest of Asparagales, orchids lack most of the non-DNA 
synapomorphies of the order. Seeds of Orchidaceae lack 
phytomelan due to their dust-like nature (like most groups 
of mycoparasites), and their nectaries are only rarely sep- 
tal. Orchids do have simultaneous microsporogenesis and 
inferior ovaries, characters that are typical of the clades at 
the basal nodes of Asparagales (Fig. 7.4; the “lower Aspar- 
agales” of Rudall 1997), but it is not clear whether these 
characters can be considered strict synapomorphies of the 
entire order. The only apparent synapomorphy for Orchi- 
daceae is their protocorm (the structure produced by the 
growth of their undifferentiated embryos before roots and 
shoots develop), although bilaterally symmetrical flowers 
and the reduction to three or fewer stamens are also likely 
synapomorphic. The hallmark of orchids is the fusion of 
androecium and gynoecium, but this feature is present only 
to varying degrees in members of subfamily Apostasioideae. 
Dust seeds distributed by the wind occur in most subfami- 
lies of Orchidaceae, but there are crustose seeds in some 
Monocots 145 
members of subfamilies Cypripedioideae and Vanilloideae 
(probably an association with seed dispersal, which in these 
cases is due to their fleshy fruit fermenting in situ and re- 
leasing fragrant compounds attractive to birds and mam- 
mals, i.e., vanillin). The effect of particular characters that 
have been considered to be important (key characters) for 
Orchidaceae has recently been studied (Freudenstein and 
Chase (2015). They concluded that a shift to epiphytism in 
the largest subfamily by far, Epidendroideae, is the charac- 
ter most strongly associated with species richness, followed 
by expansion into the New World and then a number of 
anther characters involved with pollinator specificity. All 
these characters show significant association with specia- 
tion in Epidendroideae, suggesting that no single character 
accounts for the success of this group and instead a num- 
ber of key features contributed to diversification, often in 
parallel. 
Asteliaceae (Fig. 7.8d), Blandfordiaceae, Boryaceae (Fig. 
7.8h), Hypoxidaceae (Fig. 7.7d), and Lanariaceae form a 
well-supported clade (Fig. 7.4) in molecular phylogenetic 
analyses. Blandfordiaceae are sister to a well-supported 
clade of Asteliaceae, Hypoxidaceae, and Lanariaceae. Mor- 
phology provides some support for these relationships. As- 
teliaceae and Hypoxidaceae are rosette-forming, covered 
with branched, multicellular hairs, and have root canals 
filled with mucilage; the former is also true for Lanaria 
(Lanariaceae), but Blandfordia (Blandfordiaceae) does not 
share these traits. A potential synapomorphy for these four 
families is ovule structure: these families all have a chalazal 
constriction and a nucellar cap. In S. Chen et al. (2013), 
this clade, including Blandfordia, received maximal sup- 
port, so one could merge the four families in Hypoxidaceae 
(which is the only conserved name). Lanaria (Lanariaceae) 
has in the past been considered to be a member of Haemo- 
doraceae (Hutchinson 1967) or Tecophilaeaceae (Dahlgren 
et al. 1985); 
Boryaceae (two genera, Borya and Alania, 12 species) 
are sister to the rest of the hypoxid clade (above) with good 
support in Pires et al. (2006) and S. Chen et al. (2013). 
Borya (Fig. 7.8h) is typically a “resurrection plant” found 
on rocky slopes; during the dry season, they fall to a frac- 
tion of their normal water content and turn rusty-orange, 
but they quickly become green and active again once it 
rains. Boryaceae are known to be mycorrhizal, but this is 
of the standard vesicular-arbuscular (VA) type and not like 
that of the orchids (their own unique type, endomycorrhi- 
zal). Boryaceae were previously thought to be members of 
Anthericaceae (Dahlgren et al. 1985), a family shown to be 
grossly polyphyletic (Chase et al. 1996).

is maximally supported (Chase et al. 2006; S. Chen et al. 
2013), but there are no known non-DNA synapomorphies 
for this clade. Within this large subclade, some analyses 
have found that Ixioliriaceae are sister to the rest (Chase 
et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006; Pires et al. 2006). Ixioliria- 
ceae (Fig. 7.8f) share corms, a leafy inflorescence, and, of- 
ten, a nearly capitate inflorescence. However, relationships 
of Doryanthaceae to Ixioliriaceae and Tecophilaeaceae re- 
main unclear. Although they form a clade in Hertwick et al. 
(2015), support is weak; their relationship to Iridaceae is 
also unclear from both morphological and molecular analy- 
ses. After Ixioliriaceae, Graham et al. (2006) found the next 
diverging clade is Doryanthaceae, followed by Iridaceae, 
with 92% and 97% BS support, respectively. However, 
Chase et al. (2006) and S. Chen et al. (2013) recovered other 
relationships, but none with high support. All these families 
are excluded from the next node in Asparagales (Fay et al. 
2000b; Chase et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006; Pires et al. 
2006; S. Chen et al. 2013). The two species of Doryanthes 
are enormous, rosette-forming herbs (Fig. 7.8f); they are a 
conspicuous floristic element around Sydney, Australia, and 
their flowering is difficult to miss. Iridaceae (Fig. 7.6f) are 
one of the largest and best-studied families of Asparagales 
(e.g., Goldblatt 1990, 1991; Goldblatt et al. 1998, 2002; 
Reeves et al. 2001). Iridaceae consist of three subfamilies, 
Crocoideae (including Nivenioideae), Iridoideae, and Iso- 
physidoideae, with the last sister to the other two. Iridaceae 
are distinctive among Asparagales because of their unique 
inflorescence structure (a rhipidium) and their combination 
of inferior ovaries and three stamens (Fig. 7.6f); unifacial 
leaves are also common in the family, whereas bifacial 
leaves are the norm in other Asparagales (an obvious ex- 
ception is Xeronema, Xeronemataceae). 
_ Character Evolution in Asparagales 
It was long known that Allium (Amaryllidaceae subf. Alli- 
oideae) lacked the standard plant telomeric repeats, termed 
the Arabidopsis-type, that cap the ends of chromosomes. 
Then, it was discovered (Adams et al. 2001) that Aloe (As- 
phodelaceae) also lacked this standard repeat type. Com- 
paring the position of these two genera on the plastid DNA 
tree of Fay et al. (2000b) led to the hypothesis that the 
intervening genera of Asparagales should also lack these 
standard sequences. Representatives of all Asparagales 
families were then examined by a combination of fluores- 
cent in situ hybridization (FISH) and slot blot Southern 
hybridization, and it was found that all but a single genus, 
Ornithogalum (Asparagaceae subf. Scilloideae), of those 
predicted to lack the Arabidopsis-type repeats, did indeed 
lack them. Sykorova et al. (2003) discovered that Ornitho- 
galum and several other related genera had replaced the 
standard plant repeat with a human-type repeat and, with 
more sensitive probing, that nearly all genera of Asparag- 
ales have at least some copies of the human-type repeat as 
well as a variety of others located at their chromosome tips. 
Thus, Asparagales represent a dynamic situation in which a 
variety of telomeric cap motifs are maintained in low copy, 
in spite of the presence of the dominant Arabidopsis-type 
repeat. However, in some cases, one of the low-copy types 
is amplified and replaces the standard type. The presence 
and composition of the various repeat types provide a great 
deal of phylogenetic structure within Asparagales. 
Character Evolution in Iridaceae 
Asparagales offer many examples of the elucidation of 
character evolution in a phylogenetic context. Orchida- 
ceae and pollination are discussed in Chapter 14; Irida- 
ceae have been well studied (Goldblatt and coworkers). 
Goldblatt et al. (2002) dated the radiation of Moraea 
(Iridaceae; nearly 200 species in Africa and Eurasia, but 
particularly diverse in the Cape area of South Africa), and 
evaluated patterns of pollination and chromosomal evolu- 
tion. Moraea and its sister genus Ferraria split from each 
other about 25 mya, and the early radiation of Moraea 
took place against a background of increasing aridification 
and the spread of desert, shrublands, and fynbos (a diverse, 
shrubby community found in South Africa). An Iris-type 
— 
flower (Fig. 7.7f, one with three separate pollination units) 
is ancestral in Moraea. This type of flower is pollinated by 
long-tongued bees foraging for nectar; pollen deposition is 
passive. In multiple, unrelated lineages, this flower type has 
been replaced by open, Homeria-type flowers (Fig. 7.7f in- 
sert), in which pollen is actively sought by short-tongued 
bees; pollen is taken to their nests and fed to the devel- 
oping larval bees. In addition, some lineages have become 
adapted to nectar-seeking flies or scarab beetles, the latter 
using the flowers as sites for mate selection and mating. 
Chromosome number change in Moraea occurred late 
in the evolution of the genus; most nodes near the base of 
the genus were 
= 8. Some clades experienced increases 
and others decreases around the same time, so that lineage 
diversification over a short period fixed these differences in 
separate clades, after which little further change took place. 
Species-rich clades, mostly containing taxa endemic to the 
Cape, also contain species with ranges outside southern 
Africa. Some species managed to reach Europe and west- 
ern Asia, but this occurred late in the evolution of Moraea. 
Species-level analyses, such as that of Goldblatt et al. 
(2002), demonstrate how a much-improved understanding 
of evolutionary patterns and processes, as well as molecu- 
lar clock dating, can be established, which in turn can pro- 
vide insights into geographic patterns of species diversity. 

The next node of Asparagales, a clade “aft 
Xeronema- 
taceae, Asphodelaceae (including Xanthorrhoeaceae and 
Hemerocallidaceae), Amaryllidaceae (including Agapantha- 
ceae and Alliaceae), and Asparagaceae (including Agava- 
ceae, Anthericaceae, Anemarrhenaceae, Aphyllanthaceae, 
Behniaceae, Herreriaceae, Hyacinthaceae, Laxmanniaceae, 
Ruscaceae, and Themidaceae) is also well supported (e.g., 
Fay et al. 2000b; Chase et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006; 
S. Chen et al. 2013). If an inferior ovary is a synapomorphy 
of Asparagales (Fig. 7.9; Chase et al. 1995b), then this node 
would mark the transition to a superior ovary (although 
there are inferior ovaries in Amaryllidoideae of Amarylli-

daceae and Yucca in Agavoideae of Asparagaceae, but these 
are obviously embedded clades). Xeronema (Xeronemata- 
ceae; Fig. 7.8e) was previously considered a close relative 
of Phormium (usually Phormiaceae; Dahlgren et al. 1985; 
in APG, Phormium is in Hemerocallidoideae of Asphodela- 
ceae), but although there are superficial similarities (e.g., 
unifacial leaves), they are not identical in detail. Chase et al. 
(2000a) described the family Xeronemataceae, and it falls 
within the general patterns of variation within Asparagales. 
The clades at this node all have infralocular septal nec- 
taries, which Rudall (2000) interpreted to be the result of 
these ovaries being secondarily superior (see Chapter 10).

One possible recon-

in monocots. 

150 Chapter 7 
Since nearly all early-diverging nodes in Asparagales are 
characterized by inferior ovaries, this seems a reasonable 
interpretation and demonstrates the reversibility of this 
trait that has often been emphasized in monocot systemat- 
ics (Fig. 7.9; Cronquist 1981; Dahlgren et al. 1985). 
Asphodelaceae (Figs. 7.7b,i, 7.10h,j) are characterized 
by anthraquinones. The value of this chemical character is 
seen in Asphodeloideae, a subfamily now considered part 
of a broadly defined Asphodelaceae (and including both 
Hemerocallidaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae), but histori- 
cally placed with Anthericaceae (a polyphyletic concept, 
most genera now in Asparagaceae). Because of the presence 
of anthraquinones, Asphodelaceae s.s. were kept separate 
from Anthericaceae by Dahlgren et al. (1985; in addition, 
Asphodelaceae 
have 
microsporogenesis, 
whereas Anthericaceae have successive). Within Aspho- 
delaceae, secondary growth occurs in Aloe, Phormium, 
and Xanthorrhoea (Fig. 7.7i); some species of Aloe (Fig. 
7.10h,j) can attain enormous size. Included in Xanthor- 
rhoeaceae s.s. in the past have been several other arbores- 
cent taxa such as Kingia and Cordyline (Fig. 7.7e), but the 
former does not have secondary growth and is now placed 
in Dasypogonaceae (now placed in Arecales; see below) 
and the latter is only distantly related (Lomandroideae of 
Asparagaceae, which = Laxmanniaceae). 
If recognized, Hemerocallidaceae (included in Xanthor- 
rhoeaceae sensu APG III 2009 and Asphodelaceae in APG 
IV 2016—Xanthorrhoeaceae s.l. is a synonym of Aspho- 
delaceae s.l.) have often included only Hemerocallis (Dahl- 
gren et al. 1985), but even in the APG (1998) circum- 
scription, Hemerocallidaceae included a larger number of 
genera, such as Dianella (Fig. 7.7b), Johnsonia, and Phor- 
mium. All these genera share trichotomosulcate pollen, a 
rare condition in monocots, and early DNA studies (Chase 
et al. 1995a) were critical in determining whether this was 
an important character for these genera (Rudall et al. 1997). 
Asphodelaceae have many genera with distinctive bimodal 
karyotypes (Chase et al. 2000a; Pires et al. 2006), and this 
trait has been argued as the basis for separating some gen- 
era as Aloaceae from the rest (Dahlgren et al. 1985). Mo- 
lecular studies have played an important role in identifying 
the members of this clade and changing its circumscription. 
Bimodal karyotypes of different fundamental number have 
been recorded from several of the families and subfami- 
lies of Asparagales (Pires et al. 2006), and these have been 
studied in more detail using next-generation transcriptomic 
methods and found (McKain et al. 2012) to possibly be the 
result of a paleopolyploid event. These bimodal karyotypes 
may be the result of hybridization between taxa with two 
radically differently sized chromosomes and subsequent 
polyploidy (polyploidy is discussed in Chapter 16). The 
mystery is why the differently sized chromosomes have 
simultaneous 
been so faithfully maintained in these taxa following this 
event (Chase et al. 2000a). 
The remaining Asparagales (broadly defined Amarylli- 
daceae and Asparagaceae, sensu APG IV 2016; see Chap- 
ter 12) are characterized by successive microsporogenesis 
(the “higher asparagoids”; Rudall et al. 1997), but steroi- 
dal saponins are also a potential synapomorphy. These two 
families can be distinguished by umbelloid inflorescences 
with generally two large enclosing bracts in Amaryllida- 
ceae versus racemes in Asparagaceae (although subfamily 
Brodiaeoideae have umbelloid inflorescences, they have in 
this case a bract associated with each flower, which is taken 
to indicate that they are condensed racemes). Papers deal- 
ing with phylogenetic relationships within these expanded 
Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, and Asphodelaceae include 
Meerow et al. (1999), Chase et al. (2000c), Yamashita and 
Tamura (2000), Reeves et al. (2001), Pires and Sytsma 
(2002), Kim et al. (2010), and S. Chen et al. (2013). 
COMMELINID MONOCOTS 
The existence of a commelinid clade (Figs. 7.1, 7.11) had 
long been suspected (Dahlgren et al. 1985) because several 
characters occur exclusively in these taxa: cell walls with 
ultraviolet-fluorescent ferulic (Fig. 7.12) and coumaric ac- 
ids, silicon dioxide bodies in leaves, and epicuticular waxes 
of the Strelitzia type. Many authors confused the mono- 
phyly of this group relative to these characters because of 
the gross morphological similarity of Pandanaceae/Cyclan- 
thaceae (Pandanales) to the clearly commelinid Arecaceae 
(Arecales). These three families share an arborescent or 
vining herbaceous habit and inflorescences with a spathe, 
so it is not surprising that many people saw them as form- 
ing a natural group. Some authors (e.g., Cronquist 1981) 
also linked the aroids to Pandanaceae/Cyclanthaceae be- 
cause of their shared inflorescence morphology (presence 
of a subtending spathe), but this character occurs in unre- 
lated monocots (e.g., some alismatid families, aroids, cy- 
clanths, pandans, palms). On the basis of their commelinid 
characters, Dasypogonaceae also were placed here (Ru- 
dall and Chase 1996), whereas earlier authors (Dahlgren 
et al. 1985) had associated them with other groups, such 
as Xanthorrhoeaceae-now Asphodelaceae (Asparagales) 
because of similarities in gross habit, although Dasypogo- 
naceae do not exhibit secondary growth. 
The orders of commelinids (Fig. 7.11) have typically 
been associated in various ways by previous authors. Cron- 
quist (1981) associated his Commelinidae (which approxi- 
mates Poales sensu APG, but without Bromeliaceae, which 
he placed in Zingiberidae) with Zingiberidae and then Li- 
liidae. According to Cronquist (1981), Arecidae included

(see above) and Hanguanaceae, 
Philydraceae, Pontederiaceae, and Haemodoraceae, the last 
three of which he considered to be members of Liliidae be- 
cause they have large tepals and look like “lilies.” 
Arecales 
Arecales as considered in APG III (2009) and earlier con- 
sist only of Arecaceae (or Palmae; 190 genera, 2,000 spe- 
cies), a family well supported as monophyletic (Chase et al. 
1995a,b; Asmussen and Chase 2001). Recent DNA evi- 
dence, however, provides strong support for Dasypogona- 
ceae (below) as sister to Arecales (Barrett et al. 2015), and 
the former have been treated as part of Arecales in APG IV 
(2016; see Chapter 12). 
Arecaceae (Fig. 7.13a) are easily recognized as trees, 
shrubs, or lianas with unbranched or rarely branched 
trunks with the stem apex consisting of a large apical meri- 
stem. It remains unclear how Arecales (including Dasy- 
pogonaceae), Commelinales/Zingiberales, and Poales are 
interrelated, but the best-supported estimate (Hertweck 
et al. 2015) places Arecales and Dasypogonaceae (former 
Dasypogonales) as sisters, and this pair sister to Poales 
and Commelinales/Zingiberales. Givnish et al. (2010) used 
81 plastid genes but did not obtain >60% bootstrap sup- 
port for any of these interrelationships; their results also 
differ from Hertweck et al. (2015). 
Flowers are trimerous in Arecaceae with three sepals, 
usually three petals, and three or six to numerous stamens; 
carpels are typically three, but sometimes there are as many 
as ten. The pseudomonomerous condition occasionally oc- 
curs (Fig. 7.13d). The family is also well known from the 
fossil record (Iles et al. 2015), with fossils from Europe and 
North America dating to the Late Cretaceous (90 mya). 
These fossils have provided important calibration points 
in many studies attempting to date the crown node of the 
monocots (e.g., Zeng et al. 2014; Hertweck et al. 2015) 
(Suppl. Table 7.1). 
Relationships within Arecaceae have also been inves- 
tigated (e.g., Asmussen et al. 2000; Asmussen and Chase

154 Chapter 7 
2001; Hahn 2002), but some other published studies have 
used non-coding plastid DNA regions that cannot be 
aligned well against the outgroup taxa, so a robust evalu- 
ation of where the root should be placed within the family 
has been lacking. Nypa (Fig. 7.13f) had been arranged as 
sister to the rest of Arecaceae because the genus had been 
used that way by Uhl et al. (1995) on the basis of plastid 
DNA restriction site studies. Plastid DNA has been shown 
to evolve slowly in the palms (Wilson et al. 1990), such that 
most researchers gave up using conserved regions, such as 
rbcL, early in the history of the use of this gene in angio- 
sperm systematics. Asmussen and Chase (2001) found that 
Calamoideae (Fig. 7.13e) were sister to the rest of Areca- 
ceae, but without bootstrap support above 50%. Following 
Calamoideae, Nypa (the sole member of Nypoideae) was 
then sister to the remaining taxa (71% bootstrap), which 
include two large clades—Coryphoideae (with indupli- 
cately plicate, and usually palmate or costapalmate leaves, 
and flowers not in triads; Fig. 7.13c,d) and the Arecoideae 
(with reduplicately plicate and pinnate leaves, and flowers 
usually in triads or lines; Fig. 7.13a,b), along with a small 
one, Ceroxyloideae (Fig. 7.13g). In a combined analysis of 
three DNA regions, resolution and bootstrap support for 
large portions of the rest of the topology were poor, so little 
can be said with confidence regarding other relationships 
within Arecaceae. 
Baker and Couvreur (2013a) used ancestral area recon- 
struction and a dated phylogenetic tree to hypothesize that 
palm dispersals began in the Late Cretaceous, in agreement 
with the first palm fossils and rain forests at that time in 
South America and Africa. Contrary to what had been as- 
sumed, palms in Africa did not have higher extinction rates 
than other regions; the paucity of taxa in that continent is 
due to much higher rates of in situ diversification in Asia, 
the Americas, and the Pacific and Indian Oceans. These 
conclusions may have implications for other organisms 
exhibiting a similar paucity of taxa in Africa. Studies that 
attempt to integrate phylogenetic, biogeographic, macro- 
ecological, and diversification studies across many tropical 
rain forest lineages present us with the possibility of under- 
standing global evolution and ecology of the tropical rain 
forest biome (Couveur and Baker 2013). 
Dasypogonaceae (4 genera, 16 species) are a family of 
short trees (less than five meters), stout shrubs, and herbs, 
restricted to Australia (mostly Western Australia). They 
were previously linked to other, similar-looking groups, 
such as Xanthorrhoeaceae s.s. (now in an expanded Aspho- 
deleaceae) and Lomandraceae (the latter Laxmanniaceae in 
APG 1998; Rudall and Chase 1996; and Asparagaceae s. |. 
in APG III 2009 and APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12), fami- 
lies now known to be in Asparagales (see above). The genus 
Kingia (Fig. 7.13h) is a small tree, but this growth form is 
achieved through just primary growth, whereas the other 
three genera (Baxteria, Dasypogon, and Calectasia) are 
rhizomatous herbs or tough shrub-like herbs. Floral char- 
acters of the family are like those of the lilioid monocots, 
with which they have always been placed previously, but 
Dasypogonaceae were found to have the diagnostic char- 
acters of the commelinids, which were reviewed above (Ru- 
dall and Chase 1996). Given that large datasets (Givnish 
et al. 2010; Barrett et al. 2013; Hertweck et al. 2015) were 
unable to find a well-supported placement of Dasypogona- 
ceae (and recognized Dasypogonales) but recent data (Bar- 
rett et al. 2015) suggest the family is sister to Arecaceae, 
APG IV (2016) expanded Arecales to include Dasypogona- 
ceae (Chapter 12). 
Commelinales 
Commelinales consists of five families (Figs. 7.11, 7.131-m): 
Commelinaceae (38 genera, 640 species; worldwide ex- 
cept for Europe), Haemodoraceae (14 genera, 116 spe- 
cies; pantropical to warm temperate regions), Hanguana- 
ceae (monogeneric, 6 species; Southeast Asia and northern 
Australia), Philydraceae (4 genera, 5 species; Australia to 
Southeast Asia), and Pontederiaceae (9 genera, 33 spe- 
cies; nearly cosmopolitan). Monophyly of Commelinales 
has been well supported in DNA studies (e.g., Kellogg and_ 
Linder 1995; Chase et al. 2000a, 2006; D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Graham et al. 2006; Hertweck et al. 2015). However, non- 
DNA synapomorphies for Commelinales are cryptic and 
thus far confined to chemistry (phenylphenalenones) and 
seed characters (e.g., abundant endosperm formed helobi- 
ally). The families also share tannin cells in the perianth 
and sclereids in the placentae (Judd et al. 2002, 2008). 
This association of families of Commelinales was an- 
other unpredicted phylogenetic result of early molecular 
studies. Dahlgren et al. (1985) allied not only Haemodora- 
ceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae but also Bromelia- 
ceae, Typhaceae, and Velloziaceae (families of Poales and, 
the last, Pandanales). Within their concept of Bromeliiflo- 
rae, Dahlgren et al. placed each of the last three of these 
families in a monofamilial order, signifying the degree to 
which they thought these families were isolated from each 
other. Cronquist (1981) and others considered the tepalar 
perianth of Haemodoraceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederia- 
ceae to indicate a relationship to Liliidae. Dahlgren et al. 
(1985) placed Commelinaceae in Commeliniflorae together 
with Eriocaulaceae, Mayacaceae, Rapateaceae, and Xyri- 
daceae, which are members of Poales (sensu APG). Han- 
guanaceae were considered part of Asparagales by Dahl- 
gren et al. (1985) and Cronquist (1981) thought them to 
be related to Lomandra (Lomandroideae of Asparagaceae 
sensu APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 

Commelinaceae and Hanguanaceae are sisters (BS = 
74% in Chase et al. 2006; BS = 100% in Saarela et al. 
2008), but synapomorphies are thus far unknown. Com- 
melinaceae (Fig. 7.13i,j) are generally soft and fleshy herbs, 
some with a degree of succulence, and their inflorescences 
have cymose units; flowers have a differentiated perianth 
(Fig. 7.131) and are typically fugacious (short lived); their 
hairy anthers are well known. Hanguana is an often mas- 
sive, coarse herb with petiolate leaves and many parallel 
secondary veins; its inflorescence is a panicle with sessile, 
nondescript flowers; its most distinctive trait is that the 
fruits are berries with a single, bowl-shaped seed. In many 
characters, Hanguana is a better match for Zingiberales 
(Rudall et al. 1999) than Commelinales, but molecular re- 
sults are clear about its position in Commelinales. 
Haemodoraceae, Philydraceae, and Pontederiaceae share 
a few characters, such as styloids and tanniniferous tepals 
that are typically persistent in fruit. These three families 
are relatively unusual in the commelinids due to their te- 
palar perianth. Philydraceae (Fig. 7.13k) are sister to the 
other two and characterized by distichous phyllotaxis (ex- 
cept in Philydrella), pilose inflorescences, and monosym- 
metric flowers with a single stamen. The outer perianth 
whorl is petaloid, but much smaller than the inner whorl. 
In Haemodoraceae and Pontederiaceae, the outer whorl is 
nearly the same as the inner. Haemodoraceae (Fig. 7.131,m) 
grow typically in dry sites and have two-ranked, unifacial 
leaves and cymes; most genera have mostly inferior ova- 
ries. Roots of Haemodoraceae have an orange to red color 
(Fig. 7.13m) that is the basis for the family name. Pon- 
tederiaceae are emergent aquatics or wetland plants with 
sheathing leaf bases and a distinct petiole and blade; flow- 
ers exhibit tristyly, enantiostyly, and monosymmetry. 
Zingiberales 
Zingiberales are a well-defined clade of eight families (Figs. 
7.11, 7.14): Cannaceae (monogeneric with 19 species), 
Costaceae (4 genera, 110 species), Heliconiaceae (mono- 
generic with 100 to 200 species), Lowiaceae (monogene- 
ric with 15 species), Marantaceae (31 genera, 550 species), 
Musaceae (3 genera, 35 species), Strelitziaceae (3 genera, 
7 species), and Zingiberaceae (50 genera, 1,300 species). 
A close relationship among these eight families has long 
been recognized from their morphology (Tomlinson 1962; 
Dahlgren and Rasmussen 1983; Kress 1990; Stevenson and 
Loconte 1995). Molecular phylogenetic studies involving 
single genes recovered a Zingiberales clade (Chase et al. 
1993, 1995a; Duvall et al. 1993a; D. Soltis et al. 1997b), 
and combined molecular datasets provided strong support 
for this clade (Chase et al. 2000c; D. Soltis et al. 2000). 
These families are well known for their androecial modi- 
Monocots 
155 
fications, such that what appears to be the perianth is of- 
ten petaloid stamens (Fig. 7.14h,j). The flowers are thus 
difficult to interpret and are infamous among taxonomy 
students for not being what they appear to be. 
Non-DNA synapomorphies for Zingiberales include 
presence of silica cells in the bundle sheath; leaves well differ- 
entiated into a petiole and blade (Fig. 7.14b,e; with a rever- 
sal in Costus, Fig. 7.141); leaf blade with pinnate venation, 
often tearing between the secondary veins (Fig. 7.14b,e); 
leaf blade in bud rolled into a tube (Fig. 7.141); petiole with 
enlarged air canals; flowers often with bilateral symmetry 
(Fig. 7.14d,f,j); ovary inferior (Fig. 7.14a,d,h); and arillate 
seeds with endosperm (Fig. 7.14c; Judd et al. 2002, 2008). 
These plants are mostly herbs, although some achieve large 
size, such as Musa, Ravenala, and Strelitzia (Fig. 7.14e), 
which are monstrous herbs. 
Relationships within Zingiberales have been partially 
resolved in molecular studies (Chase et al. 2000c; D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Kress et al. 2001; Barrett et al. 2013). Even 
with a complete plastid gene analysis, Barrett et al. (2013) 
could not sort out the basal nodes. A tetrachotomy is pres- 
ent of Lowiaceae sister to Strelitziaceae, Musaceae, Helico- 
niaceae, and a clade with Cannaceae sister to Marantaceae 
and Costaceae sister to Zingiberaceae (Fig. 7.11). The clade 
of Cannaceae, Marantaceae, Costaceae, and Zingiberaceae 
is supported by several putative synapomorphies, includ- 
ing androecium of a single functional stamen (Fig. 7.14), 
showy staminodes, seeds with more perisperm than endo- 
sperm, and absence of raphides in vegetative tissue (Tomlin- 
son 1962, 1969; Kress et al. 2001; Judd et al. 2002, 2008). 
Musaceae (Fig. 7.14b-d) are often large herbs with spi- 
rally arranged leaves in which the secondary veins are at 
right angles to the midvein; their inflorescences have large, 
deciduous bracts that subtend fascicles of flowers with five 
fused tepals and six stamens. Their stamen number is higher 
than other Zingiberales and responsible for the family be- 
ing viewed as “primitive” within the order. Heliconiaceae 
(Fig. 7.14a) are similar to Musaceae, except that the former 
have distichously arranged leaves and different fruit types. 
Like Musaceae, Heliconiaceae have large bracts subtending 
fascicles of flowers, but in Heliconiaceae the bracts persist 
and are highly colored. In both families, floral parts are in 
fives with the androecium basally fused to the tepals. 
Strelitziaceae (Fig. 7.14e-g) and Lowiaceae are sisters 
and share a petiole with air canals, a floral column that is 
formed from the sterile apex of the ovary, and a capsular 
fruit. Strelitziaceae have two-ranked, long-petiolate leaves, 
inflorescences that are fibrous and boat-shaped, and flow- 
ers in which the lateral petals are connate. Lowiaceae have 
shorter-petiolate leaves with prominent veins and flowers 
with the median sepal uppermost and the median petal 
lowermost, forming a lip.

ht 
Cannaceae and Marantaceae share flowers that lack any 
plane of symmetry (asymmetrical flowers; Fig. 7.14h); the 
single fertile stamen is modified with half of the structure 
expanded and staminodial. Cannaceae differ from the rest 
in their flattened style and muricate ovary (Fig. 7.14h). 
Marantaceae differ in having clearly petiolate leaves with a 
pulvinus (which facilitates their closing at night) and flow- 
ers in mirrored pairs. Several morphological characters 
unite Zingiberaceae and Costaceae: connate sepals, fused 
staminodes, reduction of two of the three stigmas, and a 
ligule at the apex of the leaf sheath. In addition, in.Costa- 
ceae and Zingiberaceae the single functional stamen grasps 
the style. Costaceae differ from Zingiberaceae in having 
spiromonostichous leaves (Fig. 7.14i), whereas Zingibera- 
ceae have more or less distichously arranged leaves and 
often a branched inflorescence. Costaceae have been stud- 
ied in detail by Specht (2006), Marantaceae by Prince and 
Kress (2006a,b), Zingiberaceae by Harris et al. (2006), and 
Lowiaceae by Johansen (2005). 
Poales 
Poales (sensu APG) comprise 14 families (Figs. 7.11, 7.15): 
Bromeliaceae (57 genera, 1,400 species; Neotropical, but 
1 species in West Africa), Cyperaceae (98 genera, 4,350 spe- 
cies; cosmopolitan), Ecdeiocoleaceae (2 genera, 2 species; 
Western Australia), Eriocaulaceae (10 genera, 1,160 spe- 
cies; pantropical to temperate), Flagellariaceae (monoge- 
neric, 4 species; Paleotropics), Joinvilleaceae (monogeneric, 
2 species; Malay Peninsula to the Pacific), Juncaceae (7 gen- 
era, 430 species; cosmopolitan), Mayacaceae (monogeneric, 
about 4 species; Neotropics, but 1 species in southeastern 
North America and 1 in West Africa), Poaceae (650 gen- 
era, 9,700 species; cosmopolitan), Rapateaceae (16 genera, 
94 species; Neotropical with 1 genus in West Africa), Res- 
tionaceae (64 genera, 660 species; East Asia, Indomalay- 
sia to Australia and New Zealand, but 2 genera in South 
America; including Anarthriaceae and Centrolepidaceae), 
Thurniaceae (bigeneric, 4 species; South Africa and eastern 
South America), Typhaceae (2 genera, 65 species—Typha 
could be split into two genera based on some analyses; 
nearly cosmopolitan; including Sparganiaceae), and Xyri- 
daceae (5 genera, 260 species; pantropical with a few spe- 
cies in the temperate zone). Hydatellaceae (monogeneric, 
12 species; India to New Zealand) were considered to be 
members of the order, but they are not even monocots and 
belong instead to Nymphaeales (Saarela et al. 2007; Chap- 
ters 3 and 4). 
A broadly defined Poales is well supported by DNA 
analyses (e.g., Chase et al. 2000c; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 
2011; Givnish et al. 2010; Hertweck et al. 2015). Several 
non-DNA characters support this broad circumscription of 
Monocots 
157 
Poales, including silica bodies in the epidermis and strongly 
branched styles. Poales are also united by the loss of raphide 
crystals and sepalar nectaries. Some authors have objected 
to the inclusion of so many families in Poales (Judd et al. 
1999, but not Judd et al. 2002, 2008). Chase et al. (2006) 
and Givnish et al. (2010) found support for two subclades 
that Judd et al. (1999) recognized as orders: Juncales with 
Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and Thurniaceae and Poales with 
Flagellariaceae, Joinvilleaceae, Ecdeiocoleaceae, Poaceae, 
and Restionaceae. However, the presence in Judd et al. 
(1999) of several monofamilial orders (e.g., Bromeliales, 
Typhales) argues in favor of the broader circumscription. 
The argument that the order is too large and diverse does 
not hold up against the comparable levels of diversity and 
numbers in Asparagales and even the much smaller Com- 
melinales (sensu APG). Poales s.l. also compare well with 
other recognized monocot orders if one considers naming 
clades of equal ages (Bremer 2002). 
Within Poales sensu APG (Fig. 7.11), there are two well- 
supported and competing topologies for the relationship 
for Bromeliaceae and Typhaceae. One (Givnish et al. 2010) 
is that Bromeliaceae are sister to the rest, followed by Ty- 
phaceae (including Sparganium, which has sometimes been 
placed in its own family, Sparganiaceae), and the other 
(Soltis et al. 2011) is that these two are sister families; both 
topologies are well supported in their respective analyses. 
Here we illustrate this conflict by showing the base of Poales 
as unresolved (Fig. 7.11). Following the divergence of Bro- 
meliaceae and Typhaceae (in either of the two above incon- 
gruent topologies), Rapateaceae are sister to the remaining 
Poales. Bromeliaceae have long been viewed as an isolated 
family of unclear relationships (Dahlgren et al. 1985), with 
possible links to the lilioids (through Velloziaceae), Com- 
melinales (through Haemodoraceae and Pontederiaceae), 
and Poales (through Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae). It is 
clear that Bromeliaceae are isolated morphologically and 
could share characters with these groups (those shared 
with the lilioid orders, Asparagales and Liliales, and Com- 
melinales most likely being symplesiomorphies). 
Typhaceae (Fig. 7.15a) include two small genera, both of 
which are rhizomatous, floating or emergent, marsh-loving 
herbs with two-ranked leaves and small, chaffy flowers ar- 
ranged in complex inflorescences with the female flowers 
below the zone of male flowers. Bromeliaceae (Fig. 7.15b) 
are mostly rosette-forming, usually epiphytic herbs with 
lepidote hairs and a bracteate inflorescence. That Bromelia- 
ceae may be related exclusively to Typhaceae is reflected in 
that both lack the mitochondrial gene sdh4 (Adams et al. 
2002) and possess helobial endosperm formation and an 
amoeboid tapetum; they differ principally in that Typha- 
ceae are wind-pollinated as opposed to the primarily ento- 
mophilous Bromeliaceae.

Bromeliaceae have been the focus of several recent stud- 
ies that have included large numbers of (usually) plastid 
DNA regions. Givnish et al. (2014) assembled the largest 
dataset so far, 9341 aligned nucleotide positions (from 
eight loci) and 90 species of Bromeliaceae to look at 
correlations between species numbers and ten hypotheses 
that have sought to explain species diversity in this mostly 
epiphytic family. They found that all of these anticipated 
patterns were significantly correlated with increases in net 
diversification. These were tied to life in fertile, moist, large 
mountain ranges, with additional ones connected to epi- 
phytism, avian pollination, and possession of tanks. They 
detected six large adaptive radiations, and the highest rates 
of net diversification were observed in the tank clade (sub- 
family Bromelioideae) in the mountain ranges of coastal 
Brazil (Mata Atlantica) and the core tillandsioids (subfam- 
ily Tillansioideae), which occur principally in the Andes 
and mountains of Central America. Carnivory has been 
documented in Brocchinia and may have evolved more 
than once (Chapter 13). 
Rapateaceae are rosette-forming herbs that can reach 
large sizes; their flowers are arranged in scapose inflores- 
cences and are large with distinct perianth whorls and six 
poricidally dehiscing anthers. Many authors have com- 
pared them to Xyridaceae (Cronquist 1981; Dahlgren et al. 
1985), but their position as sister to a large clade contain- 
ing Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Xyridaceae, and related families 
is clear, indicating that the similarities are parallelisms. 
The peculiar distribution of Rapateaceae in isolated areas 
of South America and West Tropical Africa compares well 
with that of Bromeliaceae and especially Xyridaceae. 
Following these early-branching Poales, a large clade of 
Juncaceae, Cyperaceae, Thurniaceae, Eriocaulaceae, Xy- 
ridaceae, Flagellariaceae, Restionaceae, Ecdeiocoleaceae, 
Joinvilleaceae, and Poaceae is supported by DNA data 
(Fig. 7.11). Non-DNA characters uniting this large clade 
are unclear, however. Within this large clade, several clear 
subclades are apparent. 
Xyridaceae and Eriocaulaceae are strongly supported 
(Chase et al. 2006, but not in Graham et al. 2006 or Giv- 
nish et al. 2010). A relationship of Xyridaceae to Erio- 
caulaceae has been widely accepted (Dahlgren et al. 1985). 
The two families 
(Fig. 7.15c-e) share a similar habit 
(rosette-forming herbs), strictly basal leaves with paracytic 
stomata, capitate inflorescences with dimerous flowers 
in which the anthers are adnate to the corolla, a tepalar 
perianth (calyx and corolla indistinguishable), ovules with 
thin-walled megasporangia, and spinulate/echinate pollen. 
However, the relationship of this pair to Mayacaceae is un- 
clear. Bremer (2002) had difficulties obtaining sequences 
from Mayacaceae, and Chase et al. (2006) and Graham 
et al. (2006) had them placed outside this clade but still 
Monocots 
159 
in Poales. Givnish et al. (2010) placed Mayacaceae in a 
novel but well-supported position as sister to Eriocaula- 
ceae, to which Xyridaceae were a weakly supported sister 
taxon. Clearly, the relationships of Mayacaceae are still to 
be resolved. Mayacaceae (Fig. 7.15f) are morphologically 
unusual, looking much like a clubmoss, except that the 
plants are aquatic. Members of Mayacaceae have spirally 
arranged leaves with apical teeth and axillary flowers with 
clearly distinct calyx and corolla and three stamens. Here 
we show these three families as a trichotomy (Fig. 7.11). 
Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and Thurniaceae form a well- 
supported clade in multi-gene analyses (Figs. 7.11, 7.15g-i). 
Prionium had been placed in Juncaceae, but molecular re- 
sults have indicated that it should be a member of Thur- 
niaceae. Thurniaceae are sister to Juncaceae and Cypera- 
ceae (Plunkett et al. 1995; Munro and Linder 1997; Chase 
et al. 2006; Graham et al. 2006; Givnish et al. 2010). Non- 
DNA features also unite the three families: solid stems 
with three-ranked leaves and pollen in tetrads. The fami- 
lies share an unusual feature of chromosomes with diffuse 
centromeres (Plunkett et al. 1995; Simpson 1995; Munro 
and Linder 1998). Juncaceae were found in two studies not 
to be monophyletic. Oxychloe (Juncaceae) was embedded 
in or sister to Cyperaceae (Plunkett et al. 1995; Muasya 
- 
et al. 1998). The former study may have used a mixed leaf 
collection of Oxychloe and a sedge and almost certainly 
sequenced the sedge; the latter was based on a contami- 
nated sample. True Oxychloe has now been sequenced, and 
it goes with other genera of Juncaceae, so both families are 
monophyletic (Jones et al. 2007) and should be retained. 
Core Poales consist of Restionaceae (see below) as sis- 
ter to Flagellariaceae, Joinvilleaceae, Ecdeiocoleaceae, and 
Poaceae (Fig. 7.11). The monophyly of core Poales is well 
supported by DNA analyses (e.g., Chase et al. 2000c, 2006; 
Graham et al. 2006; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; Givnish 
et al. 2010). However, a close relationship among these 
families had long been recognized (e.g., Dahlgren and Ras- 
mussen 1983; Dahlgren et al. 1985). 
Most families of core Poales are herbaceous plants na- 
tive to the Southern Hemisphere and are small in terms 
of number of genera and species. The two largest families 
are Restionaceae and Poaceae. Non-DNA synapomorphies 
of core Poales include two-ranked leaves with an open 
sheath around the stem, stomata with dumbbell-shaped 
guard cells, a single apical orthotropous ovule per carpel, 
monoporate pollen with a rim around the pore, a complex 
(pinnately branched) stigma, and nuclear endosperm devel- 
opment (Endress 199Sa; Kellogg and Linder 1995; Soreng 
and Davis 1998). 
Restionaceae (Fig. 7.15j-m) as treated here include An- 
arthriaceae (Fig. 7.15j) and Centrolepidaceae, which share 
dioecy, peg cells in their chlorenchyma, and dorsifixed 

160 Chapter 7 
anthers. Linder et al. (2000) suggested that these should be 
considered members of one family, Restionaceae because 
they have the distinctive culm anatomy of that family. Cen- 
trolepidaceae, which are mostly small plants, could well be 
just paedomorphic Restionaceae (Linder et al. 2000). Re- 
lationships among the sometimes-recognized families An- 
arthriaceae, Centrolepidaceae, and Restionaceae s.s. have 
been problematic and varied depending on which methods 
and loci were used (Briggs et al. 2010, 2014). Given this 
uncertainty, one option is to recognize the broader circum- 
scription of Restionaceae, which do have some obvious sy- 
napomorphies (Chapter 12). 
Restionaceae 
(including Anarthriaceae 
and Centro- 
lepidaceae) are sister to the remainder of core Poales, 
which includes Flagellariaceae (Fig. 7.15n), Joinvilleaceae 
(Fig. 7.15p), and Ecdeiocoleaceae (Fig. 7.150) as succes- 
sive sister groups to Poaceae (Fig. 7.11; Chase et al. 2006; 
Givnish et al. 2010). Poaceae (Gramineae; Fig. 7.15q-s) are 
one of the largest and most important angiosperm fami- 
lies. A clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships has 
emerged for Poaceae from the combination and analy- 
sis of molecular datasets by a consortium of research- 
ers, the Grass Phylogeny Working Group (GPWG 2000, 
2012; 
www.virtualherbarium.org/grass/gpwg/; 
see 
also 
Chapter 13). 
The origin of Poaceae can be constrained in part by the 
appearance of grass pollen, which is distinctive, in the fossil 
record, with the earliest accepted records from the Paleo- 
cene of South America and Africa (60-55 mya; Thomasson 
1987). The oldest known grass fossils are provided by sil- 
icified cuticles with diagnostic grass phytoliths in dinosaur 
coprolites from the latest Cretaceous (Late Maastrichtian, 
ca. 66 mya) of India (Prasad et al. 2005, 2011) (Suppl. 
Table 7.1). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN POACEAE 
Because Poaceae have enormous ecological and economic 
significance, it is important to consider their origin and 
evolution; Kellogg (2000) and Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 
(2014) provided excellent overviews. Using the GPWG 
phylogeny and by comparing grasses with their closest rel- 
atives, Kellogg (2000) reconstructed the types of changes 
that likely occurred in the early evolution of Poaceae. A 
major change occurred in the timing of embryo develop- 
ment. Most monocotyledons have undifferentiated em- 
bryos; seed maturation begins after the embryo has formed 
a shoot apical meristem, but the differentiation of cotyle- 
don, leaves, root meristem, and vasculature largely occurs 
after the seed is shed from the parent plant. In the grasses, 
however, embryo development is accelerated relative to 
seed maturation (Kellogg 2000). 
The immediate ancestors of the grasses had ovaries of 
three united carpels; each carpel possessed one locule with 
one ovule (Kellogg and Linder 1995). In the grasses, only 
one locule and one ovule form. As the ovule develops, the 
outer integument fuses with the inner ovary wall to form 
the distinctive fruit of the grasses, known as the grain or 
caryopsis. The structure is unique among flowering plants. 
Perhaps the most striking characteristic of grasses to- 
day is their floral and inflorescence structure. Grass flowers 
are generally arranged in spikelets; each spikelet consists 
of one or more flowers (termed florets in Poaceae) and as- 
sociated bracts (Fig. 7.151,s). Phylogenetic trees reveal that 
the spikelet must have originated in several steps (GPWG 
2000, 2012). The earliest grasses had three stigmas, a relic 
of the three fused carpels they inherited from their ances- 
tors; this number was reduced to two after the divergence 
of Pharus. The earliest species also had, like their non-grass 
ancestors, six stamens. It is unclear precisely when the shift 
from six to three stamens occurred, but it must have been 
after the divergence of the Guaduella/Puelia group. Poa- 
ceae also provide a model for the evolution of C, photosyn- 
thesis (covered in Chapter 13; Fig. 13.13). 
FOSSIL HISTORY 
Some putative monocot fossils have been found in strata 
as old as the eudicots (Herendeen et al. 1995 and Iles et al. 
2015; Supplementary Table 7.1 at press.uchicago.edu/sites/ 
soltis/), and what we know of the angiosperm tree (Chap- 
ter 3) indicates that monocots should be among the oldest 
lineages of angiosperms. Iles et al. (2015) reviewed mono- 
cot fossils that are well determined in terms of ages and 
taxonomic identity; they recommend the use of 34 fossils 
from 19 families and eight orders as constraints in molecu- 
lar dating analyses. Conran et al. (2015) also documented 
a number of well-identified fossils from Australia and New 
Zealand that are suitable for calibration points. We provide 
here a critically reviewed set of monocot fossils, follow- 
ing Friis et al. (2011), suitable to use as calibration points 
(Supplementary Table 7.1). 
Wikstrom et al. (2001) produced dates ranging from 
158 to 141 mya for the stem node of the monocots and 
from 141 to 127 mya for the crown group (the split of 
Acorus and the rest of the monocots). Bremer (2000) put 
the crown group node of the monocots at 134 mya, which 
indicates that the stem lineage of the monocots goes back 
to ~200 mya. Bell et al. (2010) found estimates from 130- 
146 mya (Chapter 2; Supplementary Table 7.1). Zeng 
et al. (2014) put the crown group node at 150 mya. These 
dates agree well with the estimates of Magall6én (2010; 

140 mya for the monocot crown node) and eee al. (2015; 
156-164 mya). 
Fossils of the palms were once thought to be the old- 
est reliable monocots; they first appeared around 90 mya. 
However, Iles et al. (2015) cited the 113-125 mya pollen of 
Liliacidites (Doyle and Hickey 1976) as a valid constraint 
for the stem node of monocots. Recently, the fossil record 
of Araceae has been extended well into the early Creta- 
ceous. Distinctive inaperturate striate fossil pollen and in- 
fructescence fragments attributable to Araceae have been 
recognized from the early Cretaceous (Barremian-Aptian) 
of Portugal (ca. 125 mya; Friis et al. 2004, 2010, 2011). The 
identify of fossil flowers initially attributed to Triuridaceae 
(Pandanales) from the Upper Cretaceous of New Jersey, ca. 
90 mya (Gandolfo et al. 2002), has been questioned due to 
Monocots 
161 
differences in pollen morphology and the lack of informa- 
tion on pistillate flowers (Rudall 2003); Friis et al. (2011) 
have noted that some of the distinctive features of these fos- 
sils also occur in magnoliids. Older dates for many individ- 
ual families have been reported, such as 100-110 mya for 
a fossil proposed to be a bambusoid grass (Poinar 2004), 
but it had none of the clearly distinctive features of a grass 
(S. Y. Smith et al. 2010); the earliest well-documented grass 
occurrence, mentioned above, is that from the latest Cre- 
taceous (Late Maastrichtian, ca. 66 mya) of India (Prasad 
et al. 2005, 2011). Our earliest records for many important 
monocot clades are Cenozoic (Supplemenary Table 7.1), in- 
dicating the need for intensified investigation of Cretaceous 
strata that may reveal older representatives. 

Eudicots (+ Ceratophyllaceae) 
Introduction and Early-Diverging Lineages 
INTRODUCTION 
Eudicots (Eudicotyledoneae sensu Cantino et al. 2007) 
represent ~75% of all angiosperm species (Drinnan et al. 
1994). Analyses of three or more genes provided strong 
support for their monophyly (see Chapter 3), within which 
multiple datasets have identified a basal grade of eudicots, 
followed by a clade of core eudicots, as well as several ma- 
jor subclades of core eudicots (Fig. 8.1). 
Eudicots are one of the few major angiosperm clades 
to have a clear unambiguous synapomorphy, triapertu- 
rate pollen (Doyle and Hotton 1991) (Fig. 8.2). The lines 
of weakness (apertures) represent areas for pollen tube 
growth. Possession of three apertures is hypothesized to be 
advantageous and may represent a key factor in the success 
of eudicots (Furness and Rudall 2004). Although triapertu- 
rate pollen is a synapomorphy for eudicots, not all eudicots 
have three-grooved pollen grains. Some other types (e.g., 
inaperturate, polyporate, and polycolporate) also occur 
due to subsequent evolution of pollen structure. 
Because triaperturate pollen is so distinctive, the esti- 
mated age of crown eudicots is perhaps the firmest date in 
the paleobotanical record. Fossilized pollen documents the 
presence of the eudicots at the Early Cretaceous (Barremian- 
Aptian boundary, 125 mya; Crane et al. 1995; Magallén 
et al. 1999). The fossil record indicates an uneven distribu- 
tion of species diversity across the major clades of eudicots, 
with the most species-rich groups known only from the 
relatively recent fossil record, suggesting that most eudicot 
species diversity is the result of relatively recent radiations 
(e.g., 50-70 mya; Magallon et al. 1999; Bell et al. 2005, 
2010). 
We focus here on the basal branches of the eudicot 
clade. Several lineages consistently emerge as a grade, sister 
to the core eudicots (Gunneridae): Ranunculales, Proteales 
(including Sabiaceae; APG IV 2016), Trochodendrales, and 
Buxales (depicted in Figs. 8.3-8.5). Gunnerales and Dille- 
niaceae are introduced in Chapter 9; major clades of eudi- 
cots (superrosids, superasterids) are discussed in Chapters 
10 and 11 (Judd and Olmstead 2004; Stevens 2004; En- 
dress 2010a). 
The early-diverging eudicots (Figs. 8.1, 8.3-8.5) de- 
serve special attention because of their critical phylogenetic 
position and morphological diversity. The term “early- 
diverging eudicots” has been used to refer to this basal 
grade (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2005b), and we use this 
term here. However, others may prefer “basal eudicots” for 
consistency with use of the terminology “basal angiosperm 
grade” in Chapter 4. We do not advocate applying names 
to grades and do so here only as a convenient way to con- 
sider these lineages for discussion. 
THE ENIGMATIC CERATOPHYLLACEAE 
Ceratophyllaceae consist of the single genus Ceratophyllum 
(~30 species of aquatics), which is highly distinctive mor- 
phologically (Fig. 8.5). Traditionally, the genus was associ- 
ated with water lilies (Nymphaeaceae and segregate fami- 
lies; e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1997). Initial 
analyses of rbcL sequences indicated the family might be 
sister to all other angiosperms (e.g., Les et al. 1991; Chase 
et al. 1993; Qiu et al. 1993). This position received added 
attention because fossils with distinctive horned fruits simi-

early-diverging eudicots, based on analyses of 17 genes (Soltis et al. 2011) and 
complete plastid genomes (based on Moore et al. 2010). 
lar to those of Ceratophyllum are among early fossil angio- 
sperms (e.g., Dilcher 1989; Dilcher and Wang 2009) (Sup- 
plementary Table 8.1 at press.uchicago.edu/sites/soltis/). 
The earliest unequivocal Ceratophyllum fruits are from 
the Late Cretaceous (Late Campanian) Horseshoe Canyon 
Formation of Alberta (Aulenback 2009); it is particularly 
common in Eocene lake deposits of the Green River For- 
mation in southwestern Wyoming (Fig. 8.5g,h). 
However, subsequent analyses of other genes revealed 
long-branch issues (Felsenstein 1978b) with the initial 
placement of Ceratophyllum and suggested alternative 
placements. A sister-group relationship between monocots 
and Ceratophyllaceae was tentatively suggested by several 
early studies using nuclear, mitochondrial, and piastid gene 
sequences (Soltis et al. 1997b; Qiu et al. 1999; Savolainen 
et al. 2000a). P. Soltis et al. (2000) obtained low sup- 
Early-Diverging Eudicots 
163 
port (BS = 71%) for this sister-group relationship. Using 
17 plastid genes, Graham and Olmstead (2000) also found 
low BS support (54%) for monocots + Ceratophyllaceae, 
as did Zanis et al. (2002) using 11 genes (BS = 57%). The 
strongest support (>90%) for Ceratophyllaceae + mono- 
cots was provided by Zanis et al. (2003). Most studies em- 
ployed parsimony, but some maximum likelihood analyses 
also indicated that monocots and Ceratophyllum are sister 
taxa (Graham and Olmstead 2000; Qiu et al. 2000; P. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Zanis et al. 2002, 2003),.as did a Bayesian anal- 
ysis (Zanis et al. 2002). Because taxon sampling was often 
sparse and internal support for this relationship was gener- 
ally low, the result was considered tenuous. 
In contrast, matK alone (using broad sampling) placed 
Ceratophyllaceae sister to eudicots (parsimony jackknife 
67-71%; Hilu et al. 2003). Other multigene studies with 
broader taxon sampling also placed Ceratophyllaceae sis- 
ter to eudicots. In D. Soltis et al. (2000), Ceratophyllaceae 
were sister to the eudicots with low jackknife support 
(53%, parsimony; 0.91 Bayesian, Soltis et al. 2007c). With 
five genes, ML BS support for Ceratophyllaceae + eudicots 
was 65% (Burleigh et al. 2009); with 17 genes, a placement 
of Ceratophyllaceae with eudicots remained weakly sup- 
ported (BS = 68%; Soltis et al. 2011). With complete (or 
nearly so) plastid genome sequences, a clade of Ceratophyl- 
laceae + eudicots was again weakly supported (BS = 64%; 
Moore et al. 2007). Moore et al. (2007) analyzed the un- 
derlying signal in complete plastid genomes and found that 
the placement of Ceratophyllaceae varied with parsimony 
depending on codon position and also whether rapidly or 
slowly evolving genes were used. ML, in contrast, consis- 
tently placed Ceratophyllaceae sister to eudicots. Recent 
analyses of four mitochondrial genes placed Ceratophyl- 
laceae sister to Chloranthaceae with weak support (ML BS 
= 63%; Qiu et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). Morphological 
analyses of Endress and Doyle (2009) suggested that Cera- 
tophyllum may be related to Chloranthaceae. 
A large dataset of complete nuclear 18S + 26S rDNA se- 
quences variously placed Ceratophyllaceae sister to mono- 
cots + eudicots or within monocots (Maia et al. 2014). Lee 
et al. (2011) and Wickett et al. (2014) did not include Cera- 
tophyllaceae in their analysis of numerous nuclear genes. 
The analysis of many nuclear genes by Zeng et al. (2014) 
placed Ceratophyllum sister to Chloranthaceae; this clade 
is then sister to the monocots. A recent analysis of numer- 
ous nuclear genes for over 1000 species of Viridiplantae 
placed Ceratophyllum sister to monocots (Leebens-Mack 
et al. pers. comm.), whereas datasets of nearly complete 
plastid genomes for thousands of taxa place Ceratophyllum 
sister to eudicots (Gitzendanner et al. unpubl.). 
In summary, although some recent molecular analyses 
place Ceratophyllaceae sister to eudicots, this placement 

164 Chapter 8 
depicted in APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016), internal 
support for relationships is not strong, and that inference 
is largely based on plastid data. Hence, the placement of 
Ceratophyllaceae remains somewhat uncertain. Although 
the prevailing view is to place Ceratophyllaceae with eudi- 
cots (followed here), we urge caution. Furthermore, non- 
DNA synapomorphies for the placement of Ceratophyl- 
laceae with eudicots are unknown; as submerged water 
plants, Ceratophyllaceae have lost many structural features 
(e.g., roots). 
EARLY-DIVERGING EUDICOTS 
The early-diverging eudicots are Ranunculales, Proteales 
(incl. Sabiaceae), Buxales (including Didymelaceae; APG III 
2009; APG IV 2016), and Trochodendrales (including Tet- 
racentraceae). (See Figs. 8.3-8.5 for photos of extant and 
fossil early-diverging eudicots.) Most of these lineages are 
small; only Ranunculales, Buxaceae, and Proteaceae con- 
tain more than a few genera and species. 
These lineages generally have a rich fossil history (Sup- 
plementary Table 8.1). The oldest fossils of early-diverging 
Figure 8.2.

pollen. Rumex (Chenopodiaceae = Amarantha- 
ceae, APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
eudicots are the extinct Leefructus (ca. 122.6 to 125.8 mya; 
Sun et al. 2011) and well-preserved apocarpous fruits 
called Ranunculaecarpus samylina from the early Middle 
Albian of Siberia. Floral remains of both Platanaceae (Pro- 
teales) and Buxaceae have been reported from the Albian 
(108 mya; Magallon et al. 1999), and fossils of Proteaceae 
are known from the mid-Cretaceous (97 mya). Fossils of 
Ranunculales and Sabiaceae are considerably younger than 
those of other early-diverging eudicots; both have been re- 
ported from the Maastrichtian (69.5 mya; see Fig. 2.1 for 
time scale; reviewed in Magallén et al. 1999). 
Some early-diverging eudicots have figured prominently 
in older discussions of the evolution of the angiosperms 
(e.g., Bessey 1915; Cronquist 1968, 1981, 1988; Takhta- 
jan 1969, 1991). Ranunculales were typically placed in 
Magnoliidae in morphology-based classifications because 
they were thought to possess ancestral floral features (e.g., 
Stebbins 1974; Cronquist 1981, 1988; Thorne 1992a,b, 
2001; Heywood 1993, 1998). Takhtajan (1997) recognized 
a distinct subclass, Ranunculidae, closely related to his 
Magnoliidae. 
Ranunculaceae 
and relatives 
(e.g., Menispermaceae, 
Berberidaceae, and Papaveraceae) were central members of

Bessey’s (1915) Ranalean complex, which contained those 
angiosperms he considered most “primitive.” Ranunculales 
include taxa with numerous stamens and carpels, which 
are often spirally arranged, consistent with interpretations 
of “primitive” angiosperm traits. Cronquist (1968, 1981, 
1988), for example, considered members of Ranunculales to 
represent the herbaceous equivalent of his woody Magno- 
liales. Cronquist (1968, 1981) and Takhtajan (1987, 1991) 
suggested that Ranunculales originated from Magnoliales 
via Illiciales or some close relative of the latter. There has 
been renewed interest in Ranunculales (see below) in light 
of their phylogenetic placement as sister to all other eudi- 
cots. Trochodendron and Tetracentron have also attracted 
special attention because they possess several “magnoliid” 
features (e.g., the production of ethereal oil cells, chloran- 
thoid leaf teeth, and valvate anther dehiscence) long con- 
sidered “primitive” or plesiomorphic. These features were 
once thought to have been retained from magnoliid ances- 
tors (Cronquist 1981; Endress 1986a; Crane 1989). 
Because of their pivotal phylogenetic position, early- 
diverging eudicots now figure prominently in investigation 
of floral developmental genetics and angiosperm genome 
evolution. Aspects of floral structure, such as merism, are 
labile in these early-branching eudicots; this lability is com- 
parable to that observed in basal angiosperms and magno- 
liids (see below and Chapters 4, 6, and 14). Similarly, flower 
symmetry is of interest in understanding angiosperm diver- 
sification. Phylogenetic analysis of a particular (CYC/TB1) 
clade of TCP transcription factors important in specifying 
dorsal identity in bilateral flowers reveals the occurrence of 
gene duplications just prior to the origin of core eudicots 
(Howarth and Donoghue 2006) (Chapter 14). In addition, 
the evolution of basal eudicots seems to have preceded two 
closely coinciding ancient whole-genome duplications (a 
so-called “paleohexaploidy” event) that characterize core 
eudicots (Jiao et al. 2012). The exact phylogenetic place- 
ment of this key event remains uncertain (Chapter 16). 
Molecular 
as well as morphological 
(e.g., Hufford 
1992) phylogenetic studies have consistently identified 
the same families as successive sisters to all other eudicots 
(see Chapter 3). Ranunculales have consistently appeared 
as sister to all other eudicots in DNA analyses. Molecu- 
lar studies consistently recover Proteales (incl. Sabiaceae), 
Buxaceae, and Trochodendraceae as the remaining lineages 
of early-diverging eudicots. These results were apparent 
even with early analyses of one or a few genes (e.g., Chase 
ef al. 1993: D=Soltis’et al. 1997a;b, 2000, 2003c: Hoot 
et al. 1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; Hilu et al. 2003; 
Kim et al. 2004b; Worberg et al. 2007) and have been re- 
inforced with larger datasets (e.g., P. Soltis et al. 1999a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2007c, 2011; Burleigh et al. 2009; 
Moore et al. 2010; Qiu et al. 2010; Maia et al. 2014; Ruh- 
fel et al. 2014; Wickett et al. 2014). Datasets from all three 
genomes also support this result, including recent analysis 
of numerous nuclear and plastid genes with good taxon 
sampling (Leebens-Mack et al. pers. comm.; Gitzendanner 
et al. unpubl.). 
Placement of Ranunculales as sister to all other eudicots 
receives maximal bootstrap support in analyses of com- 
bined genes (e.g., Soltis et al. 2011; Moore et al. 2010). 
However, following Ranunculales, relationships among 
Proteales, Buxaceae, Trochodendraceae, and the core eu- 
dicots have been more difficult to resolve. The best current 
estimates of phylogeny are those based on 17 genes and 
complete plastid genomes (Moore et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 
2011); both recovered Proteales + Sabiaceae following 
Ranunculales as sister to all other eudicots (which receive 
BS = 100%). In Moore et al. (2010), Proteales + Sabiaceae 
received BS = 70-80%; in Soltis et al. (2011), BS = 59%. 
Ruhfel et al. (2014) also recovered Proteales + Sabiaceae 
(BS = 63%). Bootstrap support for Proteales + Sabiaceae 
was therefore weak to moderate in several studies; how- 
ever, support for this clade was >90% in a recent analysis 
of complete plastid genome sequences (Sun et al. 2016), 
suggesting that Proteales should be expanded to include Sa- 
biaceae, as adopted by APG IV (2016; see Chapter 12). In 
analyses with fewer genes, Proteales and Sabiaceae some- 
times formed a grade (Proteales followed by Sabiaceae), 
as in P, Soltis et al. (1999a), D. Soltis et al. (2000), and 
Burleigh et al. (2009). Conflicting results were obtained 
in these earlier studies based on one or a few genes (e.g., 
Chase et al. 1993; Dx Soltis et al. 1997a,b, 2000, 2007c; 
Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; Kim et al. 2004b). 
Following Proteales (sensu APG IV 2016), there is 
strong support (BS = 98-100%) in multigene datasets for 
Trochodendraceae (which includes Tetracentron) and then 
Buxaceae as subsequent sisters to all other eudicots (e.g., 
Moore et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014). 
This relationship was not clear in early analyses with fewer 
genes (e.g., Hoot et al. 1999; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Kim et al. 2004b). Conflicting results (albeit 
without strong support) were obtained in analyses that 
used individual genes (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; Soltis et al. 
1997a,b; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b). Following Buxaceae 
and Trochodendraceae, there has long been strong support 
(BS = 100%) for the monophyly of the core eudicots (Gun- 
neridae sensu Cantino et al. 2007)—this was apparent even 
in early studies of one or a few genes (e.g., Hoot et al. 1999; 
P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen et al. 2000a; Soltis et al. 
2000, 2003c; Hilu et al. 2003). 
Early-diverging eudicots share putatively plesiomor- 
phic features with basal angiosperms (Chapters 4 and 6). 
Ellagic acid and gallic acid (Fig. 8.6) are absent from the 
early-diverging eudicots, as they are from most basal an-

giosperms, but these acids appear to be prevalent through- 
out core eudicots (see Fig. 8.7) (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; 
Savolainen et al. 2000a; D. Soltis et al. 2000). Using data 
from Nandi et al. (1998), we reexamined the phylogenetic 
distribution of these compounds. Ellagic acid is absent 
from basal angiosperms, with the exception of Nympha- 
eaceae, and from all early-diverging eudicots, but is com- 
mon throughout core eudicots. With MP, ellagic acid is re- 
constructed as a putative synapomorphy for core eudicots, 
although this is equivocal with ML (Fig. 8.7A). The subse- 
quent diversification of ellagic acid production is complex 
and beyond the scope of our analyses, but several putative 
losses and secondary gains have clearly occurred in core 
eudicots (Fig. 8.7A). In fact, the absence of ellagic acid is 
reconstructed as ancestral for the large asterid clade. Our 
reconstructions indicate that the evolution of ellagic acid 
production in some large clades (e.g., Malpighiales and Eri- 
cales) is particularly dynamic. 
Production of gallic acid displays a similarly complex 
pattern of evolutionary diversification (Fig. 8.7B). We also 
reexamined this character—with MP and ML, gallic acid 
is also reconstructed as a putative synapomorphy for core 
eudicots (Gunneridae) (Fig. 8.7B). 
Early-Diverging Eudicots 
169 
RANUNCULALES 
Ranunculales are strongly supported as sister to all other 
eudicots. Ranunculales consist of seven families represent- 
ing ~1.6% of eudicot diversity (Fig. 8.1)—Berberidaceae, 
Circaeasteraceae (including Kingdonia, placed in Kingdo- 
niaceae by Takhtajan 1997), Eupteleaceae, Lardizabalaceae 
(including Sargentodoxa), Menispermaceae, Papaveraceae, 
and Ranunculaceae. Papaveraceae are broadly defined to 
include Fumariaceae, Hypecoum (treated as a distinct fam- 
ily, Hypecoaceae, in Takhtajan 1997), and the monotypic 
Pteridophyllum (placed in its own family, Pteridophylla- 
ceae, in Takhtajan 1997). Ranunculaceae are also broadly 
defined to include Hydrastis and Glaucidium, monotypic 
genera sometimes placed in their own families, Hydrasti- 
daceae and Glaucidiaceae (Takhtajan 1997). Ranunculales 
have been the focus of several phylogenetic investigations, 
both morphological and molecular (e.g., Drinnan et al. 
1994; Hoot and Crane 1995; Loconte et al. 1995). 
With the exception of Eupteleaceae, most families now 
placed in Ranunculales were considered closely related in 
morphology-based classifications 
(e.g., Cronquist 1981; 
Takhtajan 1987, 1997). Families of Ranunculales share the 
presence of benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids of the berberine 
and morphine type (Fig. 8.6; Jensen 1995), primarily her- 
baceous habit, hypogynous flowers, unusually large and 
homogeneous S-type sieve element plastids (Behnke 1995), 
epicuticular wax tubules (also found in some families out- 
side of Ranunculales, such as Nelumbonaceae; Barthlott 
and Theissen 1995), and seeds with small embryos and 
copious endosperm (see Hoot et al. 1999). Eupteleaceae, 
which are sister to the rest of the order, have scalariform 
perforation plates, whereas the rest of Ranunculales pos- 
sess simple perforation plates. The epicuticular wax in 
tubules is also not in Eupteleaceae, but otherwise would 
be synapomorphic for the order. As a result, no obvious 
synapomorphies are indicated for Ranunculales by flo- 
ral morphology or other characters (Endress 1995b), al- 
though there are synapomorphies for Ranunculales minus 
Eupteleaceae. 
As noted, Eupteleaceae represent an unexpected addi- 
tion to Ranunculales. Because its anemophilous (i.e., wind- 
pollinated) 
or partly entomophilous 
(insect-pollinated) 
flowers lack a perianth (Fig. 8.3), Euptelea (the single ge- 
nus in the family) had traditionally been placed in the old 
Hamamelidae, close to Trochodendraceae, Cercidiphyl- 
laceae, and Platanaceae (Cronquist 1981, 1988; Endress 
1986a, 1993; Takhtajan 1987, 1997). However, molecular 
studies clearly place Euptelea in Ranunculales (e.g., Chase 
etal. 1993; Qiu ‘etal. 1993; Hoot'et al. 1999; D. Soltis 
et al. 2000, 2011), with Trochodendraceae, Platanaceae, 
and Cercidiphyllaceae representing more distantly related

Reconstruction of the diversification of ellagic acid (A) and gallic acid (B) in the angiosperms with a focus on early-diverging eudicots. Data taken from 
Nandi et al. (1998), but using the general topology of Soltis et al. (2011). Some terminals used in Nandi et al. (1998) have been renamed to reflect the APG III (2009) 
and APG IV (2015) nomenclature and circumscription; other terminals have been excluded from reconstruction. 
lineages 
(see below, Trochodendraceae; 
Proteales; and 
Chapter 6). 
Molecular studies have also confirmed that Sargento- 
doxa (Lardizabalaceae) belongs to Ranunculales as sister 
to all other Lardizabalaceae (Hoot et al. 1995b; D. Soltis 
et al. 1997b, 2000). Sargentodoxa had typically been 
placed in its own family close to Lardizabalaceae in some 
morphology-based classifications (Cronquist 1981, 1988; 
Takhtajan 1987, 1997). 
The age of Ranunculales is controversial. Using molec- 
ular approaches, Anderson et al. (2005) dated the crown 
group of Ranunculales as 114-121 mya. Magallén and 
Castillo (2009) obtained a similar molecular estimate for 
the crown group (~113.2 mya) as did Bell et al. (2010):

the method used. However, the well-preserved fossil, Lee- 
fructus (Sun et al. 2011) is dated at 122.6 mya and was 
placed in stem Ranunculaceae, although the fossil may 
have affinities elsewhere in Ranunculales. Importantly, this 
fossil suggests that the age of Ranunculales may be older 
than previously suggested.

considerable interest in the floral developmental genetics of 
Ranunculales, as well as basal eudicots in general. Within 
Ranunculales, attention has focused on Ranunculaceae 
(e.g., Kramer and Irish 1999; Kramer et al. 2003; Kramer 
and Zimmer 2006; Rasmussen et al. 2009; Galimba et al. 
2012; see also discussion of Aquilegia and Thalictrum, 
below). 
Most relationships within Ranunculales are well sup- 
ported in trees inferred from multiple genes (e.g., Hoot 

172 Chapter 8 
et al. 1999; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; Kim et al. 2004b; 
Wang et al. 2009). Eupteleaceae are sister to all remain- 
ing Ranunculales (shown in Fig. 8.3). After Eupteleaceae, 
Papaveraceae (comprising three subclades) are sister to the 
remaining members of the clade (shown in Fig. 8.3). Fol- 
lowing Papaveraceae and Eupteleaceae, the remaining Ra- 
nunculales form a well-supported clade of Berberidaceae, 
Circaeasteraceae, Lardizabalaceae, Menispermaceae, and 
Ranunculaceae (Fig. 8.1). Nectaries on staminodes occur 
at least partially in all five families and may represent a 
synapomorphy of this clade (Endress 2010a). Within this 
clade, Lardizabalaceae + Circaeasteraceae are sister to a 
clade in which Menispermaceae are sister to Ranuncula- 
ceae + Berberidaceae (Fig. 8.1). 
Phylogenetic analyses have also been conducted for the 
larger families of Ranunculales. Papaveraceae (44 genera 
and ~760 species), as well as several genera within the family 
(e.g., Papaver and Meconopsis—neither is monophyletic as 
traditionally circumscribed), have been the subject of phy- 
logenetic analyses using morphology and DNA characters 
(e.g., Kadereit and Sytsma 1992; Kadereit 1993; Kadereit 
et al. 1994, 1995, 1997, 2011; Loconte et al. 1995; Hoot 
et al. 1997; Carolan et al. 2006; Kadereit and Erbar 2011). 
Papaveraceae comprise three subclades: Pteridophylloideae 
are likely sister to Papaveroideae + Fumarioideae. 
Several phylogenetic studies have focused on Ranun- 
culaceae (Hoot 1991, 1995; Johansson and Jansen 1993; 
Tamura 1993; Hoot and Crane 1995; Jensen et al. 1995; 
Johansson 1995; Wang et al. 2005). Analyses support the 
placement of the morphologically similar Hydrastis and 
Glaucidium as a clade sister to the remainder of the fam- 
ily. Other studies have focused on large genera, such as 
Anemone and relatives (e.g., Hoot et al. 1994; Schuettpelz 
et al. 2002; Meyer et al. 2010), Clematis (Miikeda et al. 
2006), Delphinium s.1., Aconitum, and relatives (Delphin- 
ieae) (Jabbour and Renner 2011, 2012a), and Ranunculus 
and relatives (e.g., Horandl et al. 2005; Paun et al. 2005; 
Hoot et al. 2008; Gehrke and Linder 2009; Emadzade 
et al. 2010, 2011; Hoffmann et al. 2010; Horandl and 
Emadzade 2011, 2012). Aconitum appears to be derived 
from within Delphinium, with implications for floral evo- 
lution (Jabbour and Renner 2012b). The largely arctic 
and temperate genus Ranunculus has dispersed into the 
subtropics and tropics multiple times followed by subse- 
quent radiation (Emadzade et al. 2010, 2011; Horand] and 
Emadzade 2011). 
Phylogenetic relationships and rapid diversification have 
been analyzed within Aquilegia (columbine; Ranuncula- 
ceae, Hodges and Arnold 1995; Whittall et al. 2006). The 
genus has become a model for investigation of adaptive 
radiation and floral developmental genetics (e.g., Kramer 
et al. 2007; Kramer and Hodges 2010; Hodges and Derieg 
2009; Kramer 2009). Hodges and Arnold (1995) demon- 
strated, for example, that the evolution of nectar spurs in 
Aquilegia represents a key innovation that was a stimulus 
for diversification in the genus (Fig. 8.8). The genome of 
A. formosa has been sequenced; given the phylogenetic po- 
sition of Ranunculales as sister to all other eudicots, this 
genome sequence is a valuable resource. Thalictrum is a 
model for investigation of dioecy (Di Stilio et al. 2005; Soza 
et al. 2012). Because Ranunculaceae are large (50 genera, 
1,800 species), 
a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of 
the family is still needed. 
Berberidaceae (14 genera and ~700 species) have also 
been the focus of phylogenetic study (Loconte and Estes 
1989; Y. Kim and Jansen 1995, 1998) (shown in Fig. 8.3). 
The fossil record of this family is limited but includes com- 
pound leaves corresponding to Berberis in the late Eocene 
to Miocene of western North America (MacGinitie 1953) 
and the Oligocene to Miocene of central and eastern Eu- 
rope (Kvaéek et al. 2011; Giiner and Denk 2012). Three 
subclades are supported, but the relationships among them 
are unclear (Kim and Jansen 1996, 1998; Kim et al. 2004b; 
W. Wang et al. 2007a, 2009). Phylogenetic relationships in 
Lardizabalaceae have been analyzed, indicating that Sar- 
gentodoxa is sister to the rest of the family (Kofuji et al. 
1994; Hoot et al. 1995a,b). 
Menispermaceae (70 genera and ~440 species) have 
been the focus of several recent analyses that provided 
evidence for two subclades (Tinosporoideae and Meni- 
spermoideae) and several additional subclades within these 
(Ortiz et al. 2007; W. Wang et al. 2007b, 2012; Hoot et al. 
2009; Wefferling et al. 2013). Fruit characters appear to be 
good synapomorphies for the major clades and subclades 
(Wefferling et al. 2013) (Fig. 8.3). W. Wang et al. (2012) 
hypothesized that the diversification of Menispermaceae 
coincided with the emergence of modern tropical rainfor- 
ests near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. This family 
is represented by a diversity of extant and extinct genera by 
the Eocene in western North America and Europe (Jacques 
2009), but has not been traced with confidence to the Cre- 
taceous. Currently the oldest accepted records are from 
the Paleocene of Colombia, Wyoming, and North Dakota 
(Crane et al. 1990; Herrera et al. 2011). 
PROTEALES 
Proteales comprise four families (Proteaceae, Platanaceae, 
Nelumbonaceae, and the recently included 
Sabiaceae) 
(Figs. 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5) that traditionally were considered 
distantly related based on morphology. Although the com- 
position of Proteales has to be one of the major surprises

of molecular phylogenetics, given the diverse habits and 
morphologies of its members, analyses of numerous DNA 
datasets provide strong support for the Proteaceae + Plat- 
anaceae + Nelumbonaceae clade (e.g., Hoot et al. 1999; 
Savolainen et al. 2000a; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; D. Soltis et al. 
2000, 2011; Burleigh et al. 2009; see Chapter 3). Nelum- 
bonaceae are sister to the strongly supported (BS = 100% 
in Soltis et al. 2011) clade of Platanaceae and Proteaceae. 
Bell et al. (2010) estimated 110-116 (101-131) mya for 
the age of crown group Proteales. Magallon and Castillo 
(2009) had a comparable crown group estimate (116.4 and 
117.4 mya) and ca. 122.8 and 123.6 mya for the stem 
group. 
Although the Proteaceae + Platanaceae + Nelumbona- 
ceae clade (i.e., Proteales s.s.) is an eclectic assemblage, 
there are possible non-DNA synapomorphies: rod- or tube-

Reconstruction of the origin of nectar spurs in Aquilegia (Ranunculaceae). Photographs of individual flowers for three species are shown to illustrate 
shaped epicuticular waxes, seeds with scanty or no endo- 
sperm, one or two ovules per carpel, and alternate vessel 
pitting (Nandi et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 2000a). Rod- 
or tube-shaped epicuticular waxes are also widespread in 
Ranunculales—so this feature may be a plesiomorphy at 
this level (if lost in Eupteleaceae), but it could be synapo- 
morphic if the waxes evolved independently in these two 
clades. This feature is therefore somewhat equivocal and 
needs further study. 
Proteaceae and Platanaceae also share carpel closure by 
complete postgenital fusion and orthotropous ovules (En- 
dress and Igersheim 1999); Nelumbonaceae have anatro- 
pous ovules. Proteaceae and Platanaceae share epidermal 
leaf characters, including compound trichome bases con- 
sisting of an annular surface scar associated with more 
than one underlying epidermal cell (Carpenter et al. 2005).

Platanaceae are among the most common fossils in 
mid-Cretaceous floras (see Fig. 8.4), and there was greater 
morphological diversity of foliage types than observed 
in extant Platanaceae. In addition to simple, trilobed, to 
palmately lobed leaves similar to those of extant Platanus 
(Fig. 8.4a,b), the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic diver- 
sity included genera with compound leaves (e.g., Fig. 8.4c). 
Associated inflorescences were heads similar to those of ex- 
tant Platanus (e.g., Fig. 8.4d,e), but in most Cretaceous and 
early Cenozoic representatives, the individual fruits were 
glabrous, lacking the dispersal hairs found in all extant spe- 
cies of Platanus (cf. Fig. 8.4g,h). 
Proteaceae may be a Southern Hemisphere variant of 
Platanaceae that diverged early in angiosperm evolution 
(Drinnan et al. 1994); this close relationship could explain 
the platanoid aspect of many leaf taxa in very Late Cre- 
taceous floras from the Southern Hemisphere (attributed 
by Drinnan et al. 1994 to Kirk Johnson, pers. comm.) and 
highlights the need for more studies of morphology (Drin- 
nan et al. 1994). 
Given the pivotal phylogenetic position of Proteales 
s.s., there is considerable interest in the floral developmen- 
tal biology and genome structure of its members. Most 
Cretaceous fossils attributed to Platanaceae, and some of 
those from the Paleocene and Eocene, have flowers with 
relatively conspicuous perianth parts. Although most are 
pentamerous, at least one representative was tetramerous 
(Magallon-Puebla et al. 1997). Extant Platanus species 
are more variable within individuals, mostly ranging from 
5 to 9 carpels per floret and 3-5 stamens each (Boothroyd 
1930; von Balthazar and Schonenberger 2009). The fixed 
tetramerous organization (4 stamens per staminate flower 
and 8 carpels per carpellate floret) seen in OQuadriplatanus 
from the Late Cretaceous (Coniacean-Santonian) of Geor- 
gia, USA (Magallon et al. 1997) could provide another link 
with Proteaceae, although, as reviewed in “Merism,” below, 
developmental studies indicate that Proteaceae are dimer- 
ous rather than tetramerous (Douglas and Tucker 1996a,b; 
von Balthazar and Schénenberger 2009). The merism of 
Nelumbo has sometimes been considered indeterminate, 
but Hayes et al. (2000) noted that Nelumbo has only two 
sepals (see Yoo et al. 2010), suggesting that Proteales may 
therefore have ancestrally dimerous flowers (see below). 
Yoo et al. (2010) showed that despite the phylogenetic 
distance between Nymphaea and Nelumbo, floral gene ex- 
pression patterns are nearly identical; Nelumbo, like Nym- 
phaea, exhibits broad B-class gene expression that extends 
across all floral organs (i.e., “fading borders” model). The 
complete nuclear genome of Nelumbo nucifera was se- 
quenced (Ming et al. 2013). Importantly, the “paleohexa- 
ploid” event that has been observed in the genomes of di- 
verse core eudicot species is not present in Nelumbo and 
must have occurred after the divergence of Proteales from 
other extant eudicots (Chapter 16). 
Xue et al. (2012) estimated the divergence time between 
Nelumbonaceae and Platanaceae to be 109 mya, in agree- 
ment with the fossil record. The earliest records of Nelum- 
bites (an extinct Nelumbo relative) are from the Early Cre- 
taceous (Hickey and Doyle 1977; Upchurch et al. 1994). 
Grimm and Denk (2008) found evidence in Platanus for 
recent as well as ancient hybridization. 
The affinities of Proteaceae (80 genera and ~1600 spe- 
cies) were long considered problematic given their distinc- 
tive floral morphology (see Fig. 8.3). Cronquist (1981) 
placed Proteaceae in his Rosidae close to Elaeagnaceae. 
Proteaceae have a rich fossil history (Hill et al. 1995; Leng 
et al. 2005; Weston 2007; Carpenter 2012) and are well 
known for modern and fossil lineages on all southern conti- 
nents. Traditionally, the modern distribution of Proteaceae 
was explained by vicariance resulting from the break-up 
of Gondwana. Barker et al. (2007), based on molecular 
phylogenetic/dating analyses, concluded that some of the 
disjunctions in Proteaceae result from Gondwanan vicari- 
ance but that transoceanic dispersal also played an impor- 
tant role. Molecular analyses also suggest rapid radiations 
within Proteaceae at multiple levels, including Grevilleoi- 
deae (Hoot and Douglas 1998), Banksia (Crisp and Cook 
2007), Hakea (Mast et al. 2012), and Protea (Barraclough 
and Reeves 2005; Schnitzler et al. 2011). 
Sabiaceae are a small tropical and subtropical family 
of three genera (Meliosma, Ophiocaryon, and Sabia) (see 
Fig. 8.5). Meliosma and Sabia have been included in broad 
phylogenetic studies (e.g., Soltis et al. 2011). Takhtajan 
(1997) recognized two separate families, Meliosmaceae 
and Sabiaceae, within his Sabiales. The monophyly of Sa- 
biaceae is strongly supported in DNA phylogenetic studies 
(e.g., Savolainen et al. 2000b; Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; Bur- 
leigh et al. 2009). 
The inferred relationships of Sabiaceae varied greatly 
in morphology-based classifications. Heimsch (1942) and 
Heywood (1993, 1998) placed the family in Sapindales (sub- 
class Rosidae), whereas Takhtajan (1997) placed the family 
in its own order within Rosidae. Cronquist (1981, 1988), 
however, considered Sabiaceae a member of Ranunculales. 
Sabiaceae often appear sister to Proteales s.s. (Fig. 8.1), 
but in some early analyses, Sabiaceae followed Proteales 
as sister to all other eudicots (e.g., Savolainen et al. 2000a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000; see above). However, in other analyses, 
Sabiaceae and Proteales s.s. form a moderately supported 
clade (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; Savolainen et al. 2000b; Kim 
et al. 2004b). Recent multigene analyses (Soltis et al. 2011; 
Moore et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2016) suggest that Sabiaceae 

ae 
are sister to Proteales s.s. with BS = 59%, 80%, and >90%, 
respectively, and thus the family recently (APG IV 2016) 
has been included within Proteales. It is therefore note- 
worthy that Sabiaceae and Proteaceae both possess wedge- 
shaped phloem rays (Metcalfe and Chalk 1950; see Nandi 
et al. 1998) and also share a nectar disk (Haber 1966; 
Beusekom 1971; Nandi et al. 1998), a rare feature among 
early eudicot lineages. These features are not apparent in 
Nelumbonaceae and Platanaceae, so it is unclear if these 
characters represent potential synapomorphies of Proteales 
(including Sabiaceae) that were lost in some Proteales or if 
they simply evolved in paralle! in Proteaceae and Sabiaceae. 
However, a nectar disk would not be expected in a wind- 
pollinated group such as Platanaceae. 
Estimates for the age of stem group Sabiaceae range from 
118 to 122 mya (Anderson et al. 2005) and ~123.2 mya 
(Magallon and Castillo 2009). Bell et al. (2010) provided 
mean estimates for crown group Sabiaceae of 87-89 mya 
(57-126); Anderson et al. (2005) suggest 91-119 mya. 
Meliosma endocarps from Europe and North America 
have been reported from the Paleocene and Eocene, with 
rare occurrences in the latest Cretaceous of Europe (Kno- 
bloch and Mai 1986) and Colorado (Crane et al. 1990). 
Other fossils identified as Sabiaceae include Sabia and the 
extinct Insitiocarpus from the latest Cretaceous (Maast- 
richtian) of Europe (Knobloch and Mai 1986; reviewed in 
Friis et al. 2011). 
TROCHODENDRALES 
Trochodendron and Tetracentron (historically placed in 
Trochodendraceae and Tetracentraceae) have long been 
considered to occupy a pivotal position in angiosperm 
evolution (Fig. 8.5). Both genera are monotypic and today 
confined to Southeast Asia and possess features long con- 
sidered ancestral, such as ethereal oil cells and chloranthoid 
leaf teeth. However, although the idioblasts in Tetracentron 
look like oil cells, they have not been studied in detail (En- 
dress 1986a) and may not be homologous with those of 
certain basal angiosperms; our reconstructions (Chapter 6) 
support this hypothesis. 
Cronquist (1981, 1988) considered the two genera to 
be basal in his Hamamelidae and connecting links between 
Magnoliidae and the rest of his Hamamelidae. The two 
genera have long been considered to lack vessels. However, 
vessel elements with scalariform to scalariform-reticulate 
perforation plates have now been reported from both Tet- 
racentron and Trochodendron (Hacke et al. 2007; Ren 
et al. 2007a; Li et al. 2011) (see Chapter 6). 
Phylogenetic analyses based on non-DNA characters 
Early-Diverging Eudicots 
175 
provided support for Trochodendron and Tetracentron as 
sister taxa (Crane 1989; Hufford and Crane 1989); Crane 
(1989) placed the families together in one family, Trocho- 
dendraceae (see also Endress 1986a, based on floral and 
pollen structure). These same studies also indicated that 
Trochodendraceae are sister to all other eudicots (Crane 
1989; Hufford and Crane 1989). Molecular data strongly 
supported a sister-group relationship between Trochoden- 
dron and Tetracentron (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; Drinnan 
et al. 1994; D. Soltis et al. 1997b, 2000, 2011; Hoot et al. 
1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b), and the single family Tro- 
chodendraceae has been recognized (APG 1998; APG II 
2003; APG III 2009; APGIV 2016). Recent molecular stud- 
ies placed Trochodendraceae as part of the early-diverging 
eudicot grade, sister to Buxales + the core eudicots. Tro- 
chodendraceae have a rich fossil history that includes both 
extant genera as early as the Eocene and an extinct genus, 
Nordenskioldia, from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) to 
the Miocene of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., Crane et al. 
1991; Manchester and Chen 2006; Pigg et al. 2007; Grims- 
son et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009). 
BUXALES 
Recent analyses place Buxales (~80 species, comprising 
Buxaceae [including Haptanthus] and Didymelaceae; see 
Chapter 12) as the sole sister to the core eudicots (Figs. 8.1, 
8.5). The enigmatic Haptanthus (recently rediscovered) has 
been placed within Buxaceae as sister to Buxus (Doust and 
Stevens 2005; Shipunov and Shipunova 2011). 
Molecular phylogenetic studies have consistently indi- 
cated a well-supported sister-group relationship between 
Buxaceae as traditionally recognized and Didymelaceae 
(Hoot et al. 1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a; Soltis et al. 
2000, 2011; von Balthazar et al. 2000; Hilu et al. 2003; 
Worberg et al. 2007). As a result, it has been proposed that 
the two families be combined into a single family, Buxaceae 
(APG II 2003; APG III 2009) that also includes Haptantha- 
ceae (APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12). 
Buxaceae in the narrow sense have been variously 
placed. Cronquist (1981, 1988) and Heywood (1993, 
1998) placed the family in Euphorbiales, whereas Takhta- 
jan (1987, 1997) placed Buxaceae with the hamamelids 
close to Myrothamnaceae, the latter family now known to 
be sister to Gunneraceae (core eudicots). Flowers of Buxa- 
ceae exhibit considerable variability in organ number and 
differentiation (von Balthazar and Endress 2002a,b). Flow- 
ers are unisexual with a perianth of small, inconspicuous 
tepals. Most staminate Buxaceae are dimerous with two 
stamen whorls, although pistillate flowers are either trim- 

176 Chapter 8 
erous or dimerous. The weakly differentiated perianth is 
spiral in pistillate flowers, whereas two whorls are present 
in staminate flowers (von Balthazar and Endress 2002a,b). 
Didymeles, with two species from Madagascar, was 
long considered taxonomically isolated and placed in a 
separate family, Didymelaceae. The plants are dioecious, 
and the staminate flowers lack a perianth; pistillate flowers 
sometimes have one to four minute scales, although it is 
unclear whether these scales represent perianth parts (von 
Balthazar et al. 2003). Cronquist (1981) placed Didymela- 
ceae in its own order in Hamamelidae. Stebbins (1974) also 
placed it in Hamamelidae, near Hamamelidaceae. Thorne 
(1976) considered it part of Euphorbiales, whereas Takhta- 
jan (1997) placed it in its own order, together with Buxales 
and Simmondsiales, in his superorder Buxanae. 
Buxaceae and Didymelaceae are united by distinctive 
steroid alkaloids, similar wood and leaf anatomy (Sutton 
1989; Takhtajan 1997), and a simple bract-like perianth or 
lack of a perianth (Nandi et al. 1998; Hoot et al. 1999; von 
Balthazar and Endress 2002a,b; von Balthazar et al. 2003). 
Both families also have encyclocytic stomata, a rare feature 
in the angiosperms (see Metcalfe and Chalk 1988/1989) 
that also unites Aextoxicaceae and Berberidopsidaceae (see 
Chapters 6, 11). 
Bell et al. (2010) estimated the age of crown group Bux- 
aceae as 98 (97-100) mya and 99 (97-103) mya; Magal- 
lon and Castillo (2009) suggested ~111.5 mya. Buxaceae 
are well represented in the fossil record; fossils from the 
Cretaceous include Lusicarpus, Silucarpus, Valecarpus, and 
Spanomera (Drinnan et al. 1991; Crepet et al. 2004; Peder- 
sen et al. 2007; reviewed in Friis et al. 2011). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
Families now recognized as early-diverging eudicots were 
long considered to represent some of the most “primitive” 
angiosperms (e.g., Cronquist 1968, 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 
1969; Stebbins 1974; Dahlgren 1980; Thorne 1992a,b). 
Trends in floral evolution observed in these plants were con- 
sidered important in linking floral characters in basal an- 
giosperms (Magnoliidae of those authors) with those of the 
remaining subclasses of “dicots” (Cronquist 1981, 1988). 
As in basal angiosperms and magnoliids, floral organi- 
zation and development in basal eudicots are considered 
“open” and highly labile (e.g., Endress 1987a,b, 1990a,b, 
1994a,c; see Chapter 4). In contrast, in most core eudicots, 
numbers of floral parts are low (i.e., 4 or 5) and fixed, with 
floral organs arranged in whorls, indicating that the basic 
floral bauplan became canalized during the early diversifica- 
tion of the eudicots (Zanis et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005a,b; 
Endress and Doyle 2009). The early-diverging eudicots have 
also been considered labile in their basic floral development 
and more similar to basal angiosperms than to core eudicots 
in their arrangement and number of floral parts (Endress 
1987a,b, 1994a,c). Dimerous, trimerous, tetramerous, and 
pentamerous floral organizations are all found in the early- 
diverging eudicots, as are both spiral and whorled phyllo- 
taxis (see Merism, below; see also Chapters 4 and 12). 
In contrast to intensive efforts to infer angiosperm phy- 
logeny, surprisingly little recent effort has been made to 
use DNA-based topologies to examine floral evolution in 
an explicitly phylogenetic context. This is especially true 
of early-diverging lineages of angiosperms, which might be 
expected to yield critical insights into the significance of 
the early radiation and success of flowering plants (but see 
Albert et al. 1998; Doyle and Endress 2000; Zanis et al. 
2003). Several authors addressed character evolution in the 
context of phylogeny (e.g., Drinnan et al. 1994; Hoot et al. 
1999) but did not conduct explicit character mapping. 
Drinnan et al. (1994) suggested that (1) there was plastic- 
ity in floral form in the early-diverging eudicots, with fre- 
quent transitions between dimerous and trimerous forms; 
(2) a cyclic (whorled) floral plan not only is common in 
the early-diverging eudicots but also represents the basic 
formula for the eudicots as a whole; and (3) the helical (spi- 
ral) arrangement observed in some early-diverging eudicots 
(e.g., some Ranunculaceae) is secondary. 
Early mapping of floral traits (Albert et al. 1998; Zanis 
et al. 2003) provided some support for the hypothesized 
floral lability of early-diverging eudicots, but these studies 
focused primarily on basal angiosperms. Other studies of 
character evolution provided additional insights into the 
early diversification of the eudicots (e.g., Drinnan et al. 
1994; Hoot et al. 1999; Soltis et al. 2005b; Endress and 
Doyle 2009; Doyle and Endress 2011). For our analyses, 
we mapped floral characters onto a phylogenetic tree for 
eudicots. We focused on perianth, androecial, and gynoecial 
phyllotaxis and merism, and perianth differentiation in an 
effort to provide more explicit hypotheses regarding floral 
evolution in these plants. We constructed phylogenetic trees 
using the 17-gene topology (Soltis et al. 2011) as the frame- 
work, with additional representatives of Ranunculaceae, 
Papaveraceae, Lardizabalaceae, and other Ranunculales 
included to reflect greater diversity within these subclades. 
The genera used as placeholders, as well as the family 
and order (if placed to order) designations (sensu APG III 
2009 and APG IV 2016), are provided in Table 8.1. We 
obtained floral data from Drinnan et al. (1994), Zanis et al. 
(2003), Ronse De Craene et al. (2003), and primary refer- 
ences therein and reconstructed evolutionary history under 
both maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood

PERIANTH -PHYLLOTAXIS 
We considered this feature across all angiosperms in Chap- 
ter 4. Most earliest-branching lineages (Amborellaceae and 
Austrobaileyales, but not Nymphaeales; see Chapter 4) ex- 
hibit a spiral perianth (although the ancestral state for all 
angiosperms is equivocal). The whorled perianth is recon- 
structed as ancestral for mesangiosperms (Chapter 4) with 
multiple changes to a spiral perianth in magnoliids. 
A whorled perianth is also reconstructed as ancestral 
for the eudicots (Fig. 8.9), which agrees with Endress and 
Doyle (2009) but who analyzed far fewer basal eudicots. 
Our results indicate a reversal to a spiral perianth in Ne- 
lumbo (Williamson and Schneider 1993b; Hayes et al. 
2000) and in some Ranunculales, including Kingdonia and 
several Ranunculaceae (e.g., Caltha and Coptis; Endress 
1995b; Fig. 8.9). Several early-diverging eudicots have 
lost a perianth, including Trochodendron, Euptelea, and 
Didymeles. However, in Trochodendron very young flow- 
ers have, in addition to two lateral prophylls, minute rudi- 
ments of organs outside of the androecium in apparently 
irregular arrangement; these organs may represent perianth 
remnants (Endress 1986a). 
We also conducted multistate codings of perianth phyl- 
lotaxis (e.g., one whorl = monocycly, two whorls = dicycy- 
cly, three whorls = tricycly, multiple whorls = polycycly), 
and these reconstructions (not shown) similarly show a 
dynamic picture of perianth evolution in early-diverging 
eudicots comparable to that seen in basal angiosperms 
and magnoliids (see Chapter 4). For example, polycycly 
characterizes much of Papaveraceae, as well as Hydrastis 
+ Glaucidium. Tetracycly has arisen multiple times (e.g., 
in Lardizabalaceae, in the ancestor of Menispermaceae, 
Berberidaceae, and Ranunculaceae), and dicycly has arisen 
multiple times as well (Buxaceae and Tetracentron). ML 
reconstructions indicate with a high probability that a 
dicyclic perianth is ancestral in the common ancestor of 
Proteales and all other angiosperms, and this is also recon- 
structed as ancestral with MP as well as ML in the ances- 
tor of Buxales and all other angiosperms (not shown). This 
result agrees with Endress and Doyle (2009). 
ANDROECIAL AND GYNOECIAL 
PHYLLOTAXIS

state characters. Stamen phyllotaxis can bé complex and 
difficult to interpret (see also Chapters 4 and 14). In Ra- 
nunculaceae and Trochodendron, stamen phyllotaxis may 
be both spiral and whorled within the same genus or even 
species (see Chapter 14; Endress 1987a,b, 1990b, 1995b; 
Ren et al. 2010). We will focus therefore on binary coding. 
A whorled androecium (Fig. 8.10) and whorled gynoe- 
cium are ancestral for the mesangiosperms (Chapter 4), as 
well as the eudicots (see Endress and Doyle 2009). Recon- 
struction of gynoecial evolution (not shown) mirrors that 
provided for androecial diversification. Almost all Ranun- 
culales have a whorled androecium and gynoecium, and in 
binary character-state reconstructions, the ancestral state 
throughout Ranunculales is also whorled. Our mapping 
studies indicate (Fig. 8.10) that spirally arranged stamens 
and carpels have been derived independently within the 
early-diverging eudicots: Ranunculaceae, Kingdonia (Cir- 
caeasteraceae), Nelumbonaceae, and Trochodendraceae. 
Our codings for Kingdonia follow Ren et al. (2004; see 
also Kosuge and Tamara 1989; Drinnan et al. 1994). The 
Menispermaceae included here have whorled phyllotaxis, 
but some members (e.g., Hypserpa) have spiral androecial 
phyllotaxis (Endress 1995b) and would thus represent an- 
other independent origin of spiral phyllotaxis. 
Flowers in Ranunculaceae exhibit great variety in form 
(Chapter 14). Numerous spirally arranged parts were tra- 
ditionally considered to be ancestral for the family (Tamura 
1965; see also Cronquist 1981, 1988), but our reconstruc- 
tions based on a few exemplars suggest a whorled ancestor 
with later derivation of a spiral phyllotaxis. Hydrastis and 
Glaucidium are sisters to the remainder of Ranunculaceae, 
and both have whorled phyllotaxis (see Doyle and Endress 
2011). Flowers of Glaucidium have numerous stamens 
that are sometimes misinterpreted as spirally arranged, al- 
though early development was not studied. Hence, whorled 
phyllotaxis could be ancestral for the family (see Drinnan 
et al. 1994). There may be multiple derivations of spiral an- 
droecial and gynoecial phyllotaxis just within Ranuncula- 
ceae, but more detailed phylogenetic analyses of the family 
are required (Endress 1987a,b, 1995b). 
Ranunculales were long considered to represent an early 
angiosperm lineage with features of Magnoliales, such as 
numerous stamens and carpels (Cronquist 1968, 1988; 
Takhtajan 1969, 1991, 1997; see Chapter 4). Coding an- 
droecial merism as a multistate character (not shown) al- 
lows us to evaluate whether numerous stamens in these 
taxa are ancestral or derived. Following the definitions of 
monocycly and polycycly provided by Ronse De Craene 
and Smets (1998a,b), our reconstructions indicate that 
polycyclic androecia are derived, not ancestral, in the early- 
diverging eudicots. The ancestral androecium is recon- 
Early-Diverging Eudicots 
179 
structed as ambiguous for all eudicots, given the extensive 
variation in Ranunculales (see below). 
Within Ranunculales, a polycyclic androecium has been 
derived several times, at least once each within Ranuncula- 
ceae and Papaveraceae. The derivation of a polycyclic an- 
droecium from a dicyclic ancestor within Papaveraceae is 
more clearly seen by adding representatives according to 
the topology of Hoot et al. (1997; tree not shown). The 
polymerous androecia and gynoecia of Papaveraceae re- 
flect secondary multiplication (Drinnan et al. 1994; Kade- 
reit et al. 1995; Hoot et al. 1997). Within Ranunculaceae, a 
polycyclic androecium, rather than spiral phyllotaxis, may 
be the ancestral state, although more representatives of the 
family are needed to evaluate this hypothesis. Furthermore, 
stamen phyllotaxis is so labile that it may be extremely 
difficult to tease apart “spiral” versus “whorled” within 
Ranunculaceae. For example, in Actaea alba, stamen phyl- 
lotaxis is normally whorled but sometimes is spiral; both 
spiral and whorled stamen phyllotaxis are also present 
within Anemone (Schoffel 1932; Ren et al. 2010). 
MERISM (MEROSITY) 
Our reconstructions indicate that merism is highly labile in 
early-diverging eudicots (Fig. 8.11), a finding similar to that 
reconstructed for basal and magnoliid angiosperms (see 
Chapter 4). As noted in Chapter 4, a trimerous perianth 
may be ancestral for mesangiosperms (Fig. 8.11). Trimery 
has also played a prominent role in Ranunculales and is 
reconstructed as ancestral for all members of the clade fol- 
lowing Papaveraceae. A dimerous perianth has also been 
important in floral evolution within the early-diverging eu- 
dicots (Fig. 8.11; Soltis et al. 2003a, 2005a,b). The extent 
of the role of dimery depends in large part on the coding 
of Proteaceae (below) (Fig. 8.11) and the influence of fos- 
sils. A dimerous perianth is also prevalent in Ranunculales 
and is reconstructed as ancestral with MP (but not ML) 
for Papaveraceae, with an apparent transition to trimery 
in Platystemon. Reconstruction of the ancestral state of 
Ranunculaceae is equivocal with MP and ML, but the an- 
cestor of Hydrastis + Glaucidium was dimerous. Both Hy- 
drastis and Glaucidium are dimerous genera that are sister 
to the remainder of the family, which in our analyses is 
a clade (Coptis, Xanthorhiza, Caltha, and Ranunculus) of 
predominantly pentamerous taxa. Bear in mind, however, 
that many other genera of the family (after Glaucidium and 
Hydrastis) are not pentamerous. Nonetheless, this same re- 
sult is obtained in other mapping studies (not shown) that 
use additional genera of Ranunculaceae. 
The perianth of Proteaceae has been interpreted as

Reconstruction of the diversification of perianth merism (multistate coding) with a focus on early-diverging eudicots. 

182 Chapter 8 
tetramerous by some (Drinnan et al. 1994), but phyllotacti- 
cally the four tepals “could represent two dimerous whorls 
of successive primordia” (Douglas and Tucker 1996a,b; see 
Endress 2010a). The patterns of perianth phyllotaxis in the 
family appear similar to those observed in Buxaceae and 
Papaveraceae, which have dimerous (opposite/decussate) 
arrangements of organs (Douglas and Tucker 1996a,b); we 
therefore scored Proteaceae as dimerous (Endress and Doyle 
2009). However, we also conducted reconstructions coding 
Proteaceae as tetramerous (not shown). If Proteaceae are 
tetramerous, then they represent one of the few instances in 
which this arrangement has evolved in the early-diverging 
eudicots (in addition to some Ranunculaceae). Platanaceae, 
sister to Proteaceae, may also be tetramerous (von Baltha- 
zar and Sch6nenberger 2009). Early fossils of Platanaceae 
are tetramerous, whereas other reports have indicated pen- 
tamery (Manchester 1986; Friis et al. 1988; Crane et al. 
1993; Magall6n-Puebla et al. 1997); we used both condi- 
tions in various reconstructions. 
If Proteaceae are scored as tetramerous, then the an- 
cestral condition with MP and ML for all eudicots after 
Ranunculales (i.e., Proteales + all other eudicots) is equivo- 
cal. Interpreting the merism of Proteaceae as dimerous 
(Fig. 8.12B; Douglas and Tucker 1996a,b) has a major im- 
pact; the ancestral state of the branch to all eudicots except 
Ranunculales is then reconstructed as dimerous using MP, 
as is the ancestor of all subsequent nodes preceding the core 
eudicots, although this interpretation is uncertain at each 
node with ML (Fig. 8.11). However, these reconstructions 
are hampered by equivocal interpretations of “perianth” in 
some lineages, such as Buxaceae, Trochodendraceae, and 
Myrothamnaceae. It is unclear whether the apparent peri- 
anth in these groups is actually a perianth or an assemblage 
of bracts, and the relationship between bracts and tepals 
is uncertain (see von Balthazar and Endress 2002a for dis- 
cussion of Buxaceae). Tetracentron possesses a dimerous 
perianth (Fig. 8.12C), and a perianth appears to be absent 
from its sister group, Trochodendron. However, rudiments 
of what may be a perianth are present in young flowers of 
Trochodendron, and these structures are in a dimerous con- 
dition (Fig. 8.12D), although it is still unclear if these struc- 
tures represent perianth parts (Endress 1986a). A dimerous 
perianth may also be ancestral for Buxaceae (Fig. 8.11). 
Reconstruction of the ancestral state for Buxaceae is con- 
founded by the uncertain perianth condition in Didymeles 
(see above) (von Balthazar et al. 2003) and female flowers 
in some Buxaceae, which are not dimerous (von Balthazar 
and Endress 2002a,b). We scored the merism of Didymeles 
as uncertain; in our reconstruction the ancestral condition 
for the entire Buxaceae is dimerous with MP; this is also 
favored by ML. 
Regardless of the coding of Proteaceae, our reconstruc-

tions indicate that a dimerous perianth may be the immedi- 
ate precursor to the pentamerous condition characteristic of 
core eudicots following Gunnerales (see Soltis et al. 2003a, 
2005b). Significantly, a dimerous perianth is also found in 
Gunneraceae and perhaps Myrothamnaceae (Gunnerales), 
a clade sister to all other core eudicots. The canalization of 
merism that yielded the pentamerous perianth typical of 
core eudicots occurred just after the node to Gunnerales 
(the branch to Pentapetalae). 
Our reconstructions indicate that a trimerous perianth 
is likely ancestral for Ranunculales (Fig. 8.11). ML recon- 
struction provides the strongest support for this ancestral 
state. The likelihood of this ancestral state increases after 
the node to Eupteleaceae. Furthermore, the ancestral state 
of a trimerous perianth is very strong in the ancestor of the 
clade containing Lardizabalaceae, Circaeasteraceae, Meni- 

spermaceae, Berberidaceae, and Ranunculdceae. Trimery 
characterizes all of these families (Fig. 8.12E,F) except 
Ranunculaceae and Circaeasteraceae. Ranunculaceae are 
highly variable in merism, and trimerous, pentamerous, and 
dimerous flowers are common and occur in different gen- 
era (Salisbury 1919; Sch6ffel 1932; Endress 1987b, 1995b; 
Ronse De Craene and Smets 1993, 1995; Drinnan et al. 
1994). Following the evolution of trimery in this clade, a 
transition to a dimerous or pentamerous perianth subse- 
quently occurred in the ancestor of Ranunculaceae. Some 
Ranunculaceae (e.g., Anemone and Clematis) are trimer- 
ous, but this trimery appears to be derived rather than an- 
cestral within the family (see also Endress 1995b). An addi- 
tional modification of the perianth occurred in Kingdonia 
(Circaeasteraceae), which has a variable number of tepals 
and indeterminate merism. Endress and Doyle (2009) also 
reconstructed trimery as ancestral for much of Ranuncula- 
les. Ronse De Craene et al. (2015) recently proposed that 
Sabiaceae may also be ancestrally trimerous (modern flow- 
ers appear pentamerous). 
Our reconstructions support earlier suggestions that 
plasticity in floral form was prevalent in the early-diverging 
eudicots (e.g., Drinnan et al. 1994; Soltis et al. 2005b; 
Doyle and Endress 2011). Drinnan et al. (1994) suggested 
that dimerous (opposite/decussate) and trimerous (ternate) 
arrangements are widespread in early eudicots and “likely 
primitive” and that the transition from one to the other 
may have occurred multiple times. Results bolstering this 
claim were apparent in early reconstructions (but using 
only MP; Soltis et al. 2005b; Endress and Doyle 2009). 
The pentamerous perianth is sometimes considered a 
synapomorphy for core eudicots—although it has actu- 
ally arisen one node after the origin of the clade (after the 
branch to Gunnerales) and hence is best considered a syn- 
apomorphy for Pentapetalae. Furthermore, pentamery has 
arisen at least four times within the eudicots: once in Sa- 
biaceae, once in the ancestor of Pentapetalae, at least twice 
within Ranunculaceae (S. B. Hoot pers. comm.), and pos- 
sibly in Platanaceae. It is noteworthy that the origin of pen- 
tamery in both the core eudicots and Ranunculaceae ap- 
pears to have involved dimerous ancestors (Fig. 8.11); the 
origin of pentamery in Sabiaceae is unclear. These results 
provide some support for Kubitzki’s (1987) hypothesis that 
the origin of the pentamerous condition from the trimerous 
condition was unlikely. Ronse De Craene and Smets (1994) 
advocated that tetramery is derived from pentamery. Al- 
though the interpretation of merism (tetramerous vs. dim- 
erous) in Proteaceae and Platanaceae has been debated, our 
results provide some support for this suggestion in that 
tetramerous families of Proteales potentially have as their 
sister Sabiaceae, which are pentamerous. 
These examples of character reconstructions again il- 
Early-Diverging Eudicots

lustrate the importance of detailed ontogenetic data in the 
study of angiosperm evolution and diversification (see also 
Chapter 4 and the section on Saxifragales in Chapter 9). 
Such data are critical for differentiating among dimer- 
ous, trimerous, and pentamerous flowers that may have 
arisen in different ways (Drinnan et al. 1994). For example, 
whereas Buxaceae may superficially appear tetramerous, 
developmental studies demonstrate that the flowers con- 
sist of two dimerous whorls of tepals with the position of 
the stamens (opposite the tepals) arising via the subsequent 
production of two decussate pairs of stamens (Drinnan 
et al. 1994; von Balthazar and Endress 2002a). Proteaceae, 
in contrast, are more difficult to interpret. Drinnan et al. 
(1994) suggested that Proteaceae may be truly tetramer- 
ous and only superficially similar to Buxaceae. However, 
rigorous developmental studies indicate that flowers of 
members of Proteaceae may also consist of two dimer- 
ous whorls of tepals (Douglas and Tucker 1996a,b); we 
have followed this dimerous interpretation (Fig. 8.11 and 
8.12A). Similarly, trimery may arise in several ways (Ronse 
De Craene and Smets 1994). 
Developmental data also provide insights into the poly- 
merous androecia and gynoecia of some Papaveraceae and 
Ranunculaceae, suggesting secondary multiplication (e.g., 
Endress 1987a,b; Ronse De Craene and Smets 1993). High 
petal numbers also appear to be secondarily derived. 
in 
these families. In Sanguinaria (Papaveraceae), for exam- 
ple, polypetaly appears to be a specialized condition that 
has arisen through the modification of stamen primordia 
(Lehman and Sattler 1993). The basic developmental plan 
for this genus is one of dimery, and we coded it as such 
(Fig. 8.11). 
PERIANTH DIFFERENTIATION 
Within Ranunculales, our reconstructions indicate that the 
evolution of the perianth is highly dynamic. It is unclear 
whether the ancestor of Ranunculales possessed a differen- 
tiated or undifferentiated perianth—the reconstruction is 
ambiguous with MP, although ML favors an undifferenti- 
ated perianth in the ancestral eudicot (Fig. 8.13). Earlier 
reconstructions suggested that ancestral eudicots may have 
lacked differentiated perianth whorls (e.g., Albert et al. 
1998; Zanis et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005b; Endress and 
Doyle 2009). We still have much to learn about the ances- 
tral eudicot and eudicot perianth evolution. 
Within Ranunculales, the ancestral state for Papavera- 
ceae is a differentiated perianth, which is also the case for 
the ancestor of the clade of Menispermaceae + (Berberida- 
ceae + Ranunculaceae). There are clear transitions between 
the two states within Ranunculales, with Papaveraceae,

entiated perianth apparently occurred even within Lardiza- 
balaceae. It is unclear whether the ancestor of Lardizabala- 
ceae possessed a differentiated or undifferentiated perianth, 
although ML favors a differentiated perianth. This family 

186 Chapter 8 
may be of particular interest for more detailed analyses of 
perianth diversification/evolution. 
The common ancestor of Proteales, Sabiaceae, Trocho- 
dendraceae, Buxaceae, and the core eudicots lacked a dif- 
ferentiated perianth with both MP and ML (Fig. 8.13). 
Our reconstructions indicate that a differentiated perianth 
evolved independently in Sabiaceae, Platanaceae, and the 
core eudicots. 
Our reconstructions again illustrate that within the 
early-diverging eudicots, the evolution of a differentiated 
perianth was highly dynamic (see Soltis et al. 2005b; En- 
dress and Doyle 2009), comparable to that seen in basal 
angiosperms and magnoliids (Chapter 4). These results are 
not surprising in light of the fact that petals of angiosperms 
almost certainly reflect different developmental origins 
and are likely not homologous in all cases (e.g., Brocking- 
ton et al. 2012). In Ranunculaceae, petals are extremely 
similar to stamens in morphology and ontogeny (Hiepko 
1965b; Erbar et al. 1999; Endress 2010a), and petals may 
be derived from stamens in these cases. In other instances, 
petals may have evolved from undifferentiated tepals or 
from sepals (see Chapters 4, 6; Endress 1994a,c; Takhtajan 
1997; Albert et al. 1998; Kramer and Irish 2000; Ronse De 
Craene et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 2005a,b; Endress and Doyle 
2009; P. Soltis et al. 2009; Brockington et al. 2010, 2012; 
Ronse De Craene and Brockington 2013). 
HABIT 
Some reconstructions of habit, when coded as woody 
versus herbaceous, indicate that the woody habit may be 
ancestral for eudicots (e.g., Kim et al. 2004b; Soltis et al. 
2005b). However, this is highly dependent on topology 
and method of optimization. Kim et al. (2004b) and Soltis 
et al. (2005b) used a topology with magnoliids as sister to 
the eudicots. With the revised topology now employed for 
angiosperms in which monocots are sister to Ceratophyl- 
laceae + eudicots, the ancestral state for habit in the eudi- 
cots is equivocal with both MP and ML (Fig. 8.14; see also 
Chapter 6). But these reconstructions are based on extant 
lineages. Importantly, early eudicot megafossils are herba- 
ceous rather than woody and suggest that the herbaceous 
habit may be ancestral for eudicots and typified their early 
radiation (Jud 2015). 
Ranunculales in the traditional sense were considered to 
be derived from Magnoliales and “primitively herbaceous” 
(Cronquist 1968, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1991). However, 
the ancestral state for habit for Ranunculales is equivo- 
cal. The woody Eupteleaceae are sister to the remainder 
of Ranunculales, and in some earlier reconstructions, the 
ancestral state for the clade was reconstructed as woody 
(Kim et al. 2004b). After Eupteleaceae, the ancestor of the 
remainder of Ranunculales is reconstructed as herbaceous 
(Fig. 8.14). 
Following Ranunculales, the ancestral state for the re- 
maining eudicots may be woody. When Sabiaceae are sister 
to Proteales (the preferred topology—Fig. 8.1), the ances- 
tor of all eudicots after Ranunculales is woody. However, 
when a topology is used in which Proteales are followed by 
Sabiaceae as sister to all other eudicots, the ancestral state 
to all eudicots other than Ranunculales is equivocal with” 
MP, but ML reconstructions continue to favor the woody 
habit as ancestral—the ambiguity is due to the placement 
of the herbaceous Nelumbonaceae as sister to the remain- 
ing Proteales (Fig. 8.14). Regardless, following Proteales or 
Proteales + Sabiaceae, the ancestral state of all remaining 
eudicots is woody, and the ancestral state of the core eudi- 
cots is also woody.

INTRODUCTION 
Within eudicots (Eudicotyledoneae), Ranunculales, Prote- 
ales, Trochodendraceae, and Buxaceae are successive sisters 
to a strongly supported core eudicot clade (Gunneridae, see 
Cantino et al. 2007; Figs. 8.1, 9.1). Diagnosis of the core 
eudicot clade is not based on any morphological or other 
non-molecular character, but on the strong internal sup- 
port obtained for this clade in analyses of DNA datasets. In 
fact, strong support for Gunneridae was apparent in early 
multigene analyses of just two or three genes (e.g., Hoot 
et al. 1999; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen et al. 2000a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000); maximal support has been recovered 
repeatedly for core eudicots in later multigene analyses em- 
ploying larger numbers of genes. Within Gunneridae, re- 
lationships are now largely clarified: Gunnerales are sister 
to the remainder, a large clade referred to as Pentapetalae 
(Cantino et al. 2007). 
Several key events seem to correspond fairly closely to 
the origin of the core eudicots, including synthesis of ellagic 
and gallic acids, and perhaps duplication of several floral 
organ identity genes (Chapter 12), but the precise place- 
ment of these events is unclear. Evolution of a highly synor- 
ganized flower does not correspond with the origin of core 
eudicots, but with Pentapetalae (see below). Clearly, more 
research is needed to assess non-DNA synapomorphies for 
this major clade. 
Pentapetalae comprise all core eudicots except Gunne- 
rales (Fig. 9.1) and include ~70% of angiosperm species. 
Clear synapomorphies for this clade are a differentiated 
perianth with calyx and corolla in two whorls and usu- 
ally five petals (hence the name of the clade). A corolla of 
four petals in members of Pentapetalae is clearly derived, 
and this modification has occurred multiple times indepen- 
dently from an ancestral state of five petals. 
Until relatively recently, with the use of numerous genes, 
circumscription and relationships among the major lineages 
of Pentapetalae remained at least partially unresolved. Phy- 
logenetic analyses of 83 protein-coding and rRNA genes 
from the plastid genome for 86 species of seed plants indi- 
cated that soon after its origin, Pentapetalae diverged into 
several clades (Moore et al. 2010): (i) a “superrosid” clade 
consisting of Rosidae sensu Cantino et al. (2007), Vitales, 
and Saxifragales; (ii) a “superasterid” clade consisting of 
Berberidopsidales, Santalales, Caryophyllales, and Asteri- 
dae sensu Cantino et al. (2007); and (iii) Dilleniaceae, the 
placement of which remains somewhat uncertain (see be- 
low; Fig. 9.1). 
Within the superrosid clade (Superrosidae, Soltis et al. 
2011), several different topologies have been recovered. 
With 17 genes (Soltis et al. 2011), Saxifragales are sister 
to Vitales + Rosidae, but other studies have recovered Vi- 
tales sister to Saxifragales (Moore et al. 2010; Ruhfel et al. 
2014). Both the 17-gene and complete plastid genome stud- 
ies have only moderate bootstrap support for these alterna- 
tive placements, so the precise branching pattern of Saxi- 
fragales, Vitales, and Rosidae remains unclear. 
Within the superasterids (Superasteridae; Soltis et al. 
2011), Santalales are followed by a clade of Berberidop- 
sidales + Caryophyllales as subsequent sisters to Asteridae 
(Soltis et al. 2011). However, the sister-group relationship 
of Berberidopsidales + Caryophyllales was weakly sup- 
ported (BS = 75%). With more genes, but fewer samples, 
Moore et al. (2010) recovered Santalales, Berberidopsida-

les, and then Caryophyllales as subsequent sisters to Asteri- 
dae. A larger plastid phylogenomic study with many more 
angiosperms recovered this same topology with high boot- 
strap support (Ruhfel et al. 2014). 
RAPID RADIATIONS 
Darwin referred to the origin and early diversification of 
the angiosperms as an “abominable mystery,” in reference 
to a rapid radiation that took place early in angiosperm 
history. However, it is now clear that angiosperm evolu- 
tion has involved repeated cycles of radiations and stasis 
(P. Soltis et al. 2004; Tank et al. 2015). Extant angiosperm 
diversity is therefore the result of multiple radiations within 
several major clades. Independent radiations within clades 
of core eudicots occurred in a narrow window of 10 mil- 
lion years or less. For example, molecular clock analyses 
(Bell et al. 2010) suggested that Pentapetalae arose 113- 
123 mya, with derivative major clades originating within a 
few million years: Superasteridae (104-117 mya) and Su- 
perrosidae (97-105 mya). Similarly, major lineages within 
both Superrosidae and Superasteridae arose in windows of 
perhaps 4-10 million years (see Chapters 10, 11). 
GUNNERALES 
— 
Gunnera (Gunneraceae) and Myrothamnus (Myrothamna- 
ceae) form a clade, a result that first received support (al- 
beit weak) in analyses of rbcL and rbcL + atpB sequences 
(Savolainen et al. 2000a,b). Stronger support was achieved 
as additional genes were added to analyses: 75% jackknife 
with three genes (D. Soltis et al. 2000) and 85% bootstrap 
with four genes and >200 eudicot species (D. Soltis et al. 
2003c). Analysis of a large matK dataset also provided 
strong (100%) bootstrap support for Gunneraceae + My- 
rothamnaceae (Hilu et al. 2003), and more recent studies 
continue to provide strong support for this clade (e.g., Soltis 
et al. 2011). This Gunneraceae + Myrothamnaceae pair 
was also strongly excluded from all other eudicot clades, 
providing support for its isolated status (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 
2000, 2011). As a result, it seemed most appropriate to 
treat these two families as an order, Gunnerales (APG II 
2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12). 
Although molecular data indicate a close relationship 
between Gunneraceae and Myrothamnaceae, the two fami- 
lies exhibit different morphologies and were not, until re- 
cently, considered closely related, and have been retained 
as distinct families by APG. In fact, all recent classifications 
considered the two families to be distantly related (e.g., 
Dahlgren 1980; Cronquist 1981; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001; 
Takhtajan 1997). Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997) 
both placed Myrothamnaceae in Hamamelidae and Gun- 
neraceae in Rosidae, although their respective placements 
of Gunneraceae within the rosids differed. Phylogenetic 
analysis of non-DNA characters (Nandi et al. 1998) did 
not indicate a close relationship between the two families, 
but instead placed Myrothamnaceae with early-diverging 
eudicots (i.e., Buxaceae, Proteaceae, and Platanaceae) and 
Gunneraceae as part of Asteridae. 
The two species of Myrothamnus are small xerophytic 
shrubs (Kubitzki 1993). The flowers of Myrothamnus are 
unisexual and apetalous, with up to four scales interpreted 
variously as sepals or tepals or bracts (Jager-Ziirn 1966; 
Cronquist 1981; Drinnan et al. 1994; Takhtajan 1997). 
Detailed study suggests that these structures may be bracts 
(Jager-Zurn 1966; von Balthazar and Endress 2002a). Sta- 
minate flowers have three to eight stamens, and pistillate 
flowers have a gynoecium of three or four united carpels. 
Gunnera (40 species) consists of herbs with short, upright

stems (illustrated in Fig. 9.2). In Gunnera, the flowers are 
often unisexual. Typically, the basal flowers of the inflores- 
cence are pistillate, the upper flowers staminate, and the 
middle flowers bisexual, although all flowers of an inflores- 
cence may be either unisexual or bisexual. Floral parts are 
in twos, with two sepals, two petals, one or two stamens, 
and two carpels. Gunnera is also of interest in that plants 
host nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts in vegetative 
parts. Gunnera therefore represents an independent evo- 
lution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the angiosperms 
(see Chapter 10). Relationships within Gunnera have been 
resolved using gene sequence data (Wanntorp et al. 2002; 
Wanntorp 2006). 
The position of Gunnerales as sister to all other eudi- 
cots has important implications for floral evolution. As 
reviewed in Chapter 5, a dimerous or trimerous perianth 
is frequently encountered in early-diverging eudicots. In 
contrast, the pentamerous condition predominates in core 
eudicots. However, a dimerous perianth is also present in 
Gunnera, and it appears that Myrothamnus actually does 

190 Chapter 9 
not possess a perianth (von Balthazar and Endress 2002a). 
All reconstructions indicate that the canalization of merism 
that yielded the pentamerous perianth typical of core eudi- 
cots occurred following the divergence of Gunnerales from 
the remaining core eudicots (D. Soltis et al. 2003c; P. Soltis 
et al. 2004; Chapter 6). 
DILLENIALES 
Dilleniales (consisting only of Dilleniaceae) are well de- 
fined, and the clade can be diagnosed by the leaves with 
pinnate venation, the secondary veins running straight to 
the teeth, the showy flowers with petals crumpled in bud 
(and thus + wrinkled at maturity), the absence of a nectary, 
a gynoecium of several separate carpels, and arillate seeds. 
Several members are illustrated in Figure 9.2. However, 
relationships of Dilleniaceae to other eudicots have long 
been problematic, and the phylogenetic placement of the 
family remains one of the last major mysteries in the an- 
giosperms. Cronquist (1981) considered Dilleniaceae, to- 
gether with Paeoniaceae, to occupy a basal position within 
subclass Dilleniidae, whereas Takhtajan (1997) viewed Dil- 
leniaceae alone as the “most archaic family in Dilleniidae.” 
These treatments were based on some noteworthy features 
of the family, such as often five or more spirally imbricate 
sepals and petals, often numerous stamens, and 1-20 dis- 
tinct carpels. These characteristics reminded authors such 
as Cronquist and Takhtajan of features of Magnoliidae, 
and hence they considered Dilleniaceae as a “morphologi- 
cal connection” between Magnoliidae and Dilleniidae (see 
Endress 1997a). 
Early DNA studies were unclear about the placement 
of Dilleniaceae, although with three genes, placement 
with Caryophyllales was recovered, albeit without strong 
bootstrap support (D. Soltis et al. 2000). With the addi- 
tion of more genes, the placement of Dilleniaceae within 
the core eudicots remained somewhat unclear. Use of 
17 genes and over 600 taxa suggested a placement of 
Dilleniaceae as sister to all other superasterids with high 
bootstrap support (97%). However, because of the vary- 
ing position of Dilleniaceae in several studies employing 
many genes, its position remains unclear. Maximum- 
likelihood analyses support the position of Dilleniaceae 
as sister to Superrosidae, but topology tests did not reject 
alternative positions of Dilleniaceae as sister to Superaste- 
ridae or as sister to all remaining Pentapetalae. Hence, 
we show the placement of Dilleniaceae as unresolved 
(Fig. 9.1). Relationships within Dilleniaceae have been 
examined by Horn (2009). 

Superrosids 
INTRODUCTION 
The use of many genes revealed the presence of a maximally 
supported clade of Saxifragales, core rosids (eurosids), and 
Vitales. Eurosids plus Vitales have been referred to as rosids 
(APG III 2009; APG IV 2016) or Rosidae (sensu Moore 
et al. 2010; Judd et al. 2013b; Soltis et al. 2013) or su- 
perorder Rosanae (Chase and Reveal 2009). Rosidae plus 
Saxifragales have been named Superrosidae (Moore et al. 
2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Within Superrosidae, interrelationships among Saxifra- 
gales, Vitales, and remaining rosids (eurosids) have varied 
across. Our summary (Fig. 10.1) shows Saxifragales sister 
to eurosids + Vitales. Strongest support for Saxifragales + 
(Vitales + eurosids) comes from the analysis of 17 genes (BS 
support for the placement of Saxifragales = 85%; Vitales + 
eurosids has BS = 100%). However, with complete plastid 
genome sequences, Vitis is sister to Saxifragales (BS = 82%) 
with this clade sister to remaining rosids (eurosids) (Moore 
et al. 2010). Ruhfel et al. (2014) found the same topol- 
ogy with nearly complete plastid genome sequences with 
increased sampling of angiosperms (BS support for Saxifra- 
gales + Vitis 
= 75%). However, in both analyses of plastid 
genomes, taxon sampling of Saxifragales and Vitales was 
low, so this topology could reflect poor taxon density. 
In studies of numerous nuclear genes, neither Lee et al. 
(2011) nor Wickett et al. (2014) included representatives 
of Saxifragales. Hence, support for Superrosidae is strong 
(BS = 100% in Moore et al. 2010 and Soltis et al. 2011) 
and a topology of Saxifragales + (Vitales + eurosids) is 
favored; but the position of Vitales is unclear. Because of 
this uncertainty, Judd et al. (2013b) indicated that Rosidae 
may or may not include Vitales (Fig. 10.1). Also uncertain 
is the placement of Dilleniaceae. Complete plastid genome 
sequences place Dilleniaceae sister to Superrosidae (BS = 
95%, Ruhfel et al. 2014), but Soltis et al. (2011) placed 
Dilleniaceae as sister to Superasteridae (BS = 97%). Be- 
cause of the uncertain position of the family it is covered 
in Chapter 9. 
SAXIFRAGALES 
INTRODUCTION 
The composition of Saxifragales is one of the major sur- 
prises of DNA phylogenetic analyses because this group of 
families had never before been associated with one another 
(Chase et al. 1993; Morgan and Soltis 1993; D. Soltis and 
Soltis 1997; D. Soltis et al. 1997b, 2000; Qiu et al. 1998; 
Hoot et al. 1999; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen et al. 
2000a,b). Saxifragales include Altingiaceae, Cercidiphyl- 
laceae, Crassulaceae, Daphniphyllaceae, Grossulariaceae, 
Haloragaceae, 
Hamamelidaceae, 
Iteaceae, Paeoniaceae, 
Peridiscaceae, Pterostemonaceae (the last included in Ite- 
aceae; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), Saxi- 
fragaceae, with recent data confirming an earlier suggestion 
that Cynmoriaceae are also part of the clade (Fig. 10.2; 
APG IV 2016). 
This unexpected assemblage (representatives are illus- 
trated in Fig. 10.3) consists of taxa placed in three subclasses 
in previous morphology-based classifications. The DNA 
circumscription of Saxifragales therefore departs markedly 
from morphology-based 
classifications 
(e.g., Cronquist 
1981; reviewed in Morgan and Soltis 1993; Takhtajan

phyllaceae, and Daphniphyllaceae were previously placed 
in subclass Hamamelidae; Saxifragaceae, Iteaceae, Pteroste- 
monaceae, Peridiscaceae, Grossulariaceae, Crassulaceae,

gales received strong support with three genes (Hoot et al. 
1999; D. Soltis et al. 2000). 
Molecular age estimates (Jian et al. 2008) indicate that 
Saxifragales originated ~112 (+ 9.7) to 120 (+ 10.2) mya 
and diversified rapidly. A similar window (100 to 120 mya) 
is common for the diversification of other major clades of 
angiosperms, including some rosids (e.g., Malpighiales; 
Davis et al. 200Sb), several major asterid lineages, includ- 
ing Ericales, Cornales, Campanulids (Bremer et al. 2004; 
Sytsma et al. 2006), and Dipsacales (Bell and Donoghue

2005a; Beaulieu et al. 2013); and most major clades of 
monocots (Bremer 2000; see Bell et al. 2010). Molecular 
estimates for Saxifragales are somewhat older than the 
fossil record estimates in that fossils attributed to Saxifra- 
gales are present in Turonian-Campanian strata (89.5 mya) 
(Hermsen et al. 2006; Friis et al. 2011); the molecular es- 
timate is comparable in age to the oldest fossils of core 
eudicots (Magallén et al. 1999). 
Some Saxifragales were considered closely related in 
some 
morphology-based 
classifications. 
Saxifragaceae, 
Grossulariaceae, 
Iteaceae, Pterostemonaceae, 
Penthora- 
ceae, and Tetracarpaeaceae were considered part of a much 
more broadly defined Saxifragaceae s.l. (Engler 1930) that 
also included families now placed among the asterids. A 
close relationship of these core families of Saxifragaceae 
s.l. to Crassulaceae had also been proposed (e.g., Cronquist 
1981; Takhtajan 1987, 1997). Hamamelidaceae, Altingia- 
ceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, and Daphniphyllaceae were also 
considered closely related in these classifications (e.g., the 
“lower hamamelids” sensu Walker and Doyle 1975). How- 
ever, Saxifragales also include Haloragaceae, Paeoniaceae, 
and Peridiscaceae, families that have never been placed 
with any other members of Saxifragales in previous clas- 
sifications. Haloragaceae have been placed in or near the 
rosid order Myrtales (Cronquist 1981), whereas Paeonia- 
ceae were variously considered closely related to Magno- 
liaceae (e.g., Worsdell 1908; Sawada 1971), Ranunculaceae 
(e.g., Takhtajan 1997), or Dilleniaceae (e.g., Corner 1946; 
Melchior 1964; Keefe and Moseley 1978; Cronquist 1981). 
Treatment of the three genera of Peridiscaceae (Peridis- 
cus, Soyauxia, and Whittonia from tropical South America 
and West Africa) is complex (Davis and Chase 2004; Soltis 
et al. 2007b). Members have been placed in various ro- 
sid families (e.g., Passifloraceae, Flacourtiaceae, Medusan- 
draceae). Inclusion of Aphanopetalum (previously placed 
in the rosid family Cunoniaceae) in Saxifragales initially 
seemed surprising but had been suggested based on ana- 
tomical data (Dickison et al. 1994). The inability of classical 
systematics to reveal close relationships among members 
of Saxifragales reflects the great morphological diversity 
encompassed by this small clade. Although including far 
fewer species than asterids, rosids, and Caryophyllales, Sa- 
xifragales exhibit similar levels of diversity in vegetative 
and reproductive morphology. Saxifragales include trees, 
shrubs, lianas, annual and perennial herbs, succulents, and 
aquatics. Flowers vary considerably in arrangement, mer- 
ism, degree of perianth fusion, stamen and carpel number, 
ovary position, and degree of syncarpy (Cronquist 1981; 
Takhtajan 1997; Soltis et al. 2013). 
Synapomorphies for Saxifragales are only now becom- 
ing clear (Carlsward et al. 2011). One putative synapomor- 
phy is a basifixed anther (Fig. 10.4), sometimes with the 
Figure 10.4. 
Basifixed anthers are a possible synapomorphy for Saxifragales, 
an unusual feature that many members possess. Tetracarpaea tasmanica, scale = 
300 tum; see Carlsward et al. (2011); photograph courtesy of B. Carlsward. 
filament attached at a basal pit (Endress and Stumpf 1991; 
Carlsward et al. 2011) although basifixed anthers also oc- 
cur in many other eudicots; reversals from a basifixed an- 
ther to the dorsifixed position have occurred in the clade. A 
basifixed anther is a synapomorphy of Saxifragales, but not 
the pit itself, which occurs only in several subgroups (Apha- 
nopetalum, Saxifragaceae, and Crassulaceae). In addition, 
all but Peridiscus (Peridiscaceae) are united by latrorse an- 
ther dehiscence and follicular fruits, the latter a feature that 
— 
correlates with the ovaries being at least distally unfused. 
The woody clade (Altingiaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Daph- 
niphyllaceae, and Hamamelidaceae) is diagnosed by adaxi- 
ally flattened petioles, polytelic inflorescences, sessile flow- 
ers, and the loss of floral nectaries. The woody members are 
also similar in wood anatomy: solitary vessels, scalariform 
perforations, opposite to scalariform intervessel pits, non- 
septate fibers with distinctly bordered pits, and apotracheal 
parenchyma (Baas et al. 2000). Core Saxifragales (all mem- 
bers of the clade except Peridiscaceae, Paeoniaceae, and the 
woody clade) are united by the presence of a hypanthium 
(except for Crassulaceae). 
RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN 
SAXIFRAGALES 
Relationships within Saxifragales were difficult to resolve 
due to a rapid radiation (Fishbein et al. 2001; Fishbein 
and Soltis 2004; Jian et al. 2008). Using numerous genes 
Jian et al. (2008) and Soltis et al. (2011) resolved relation- 
ships (Fig. 10.2). Peridiscaceae are sister to all remaining 
Saxifragales; Paeoniaceae are sister to a well-supported 
woody clade (Cercidiphyllaceae, Daphniphyllaceae, Altin- 
giaceae, and Hamamelidaceae). This Paeoniaceae + woody 

clade is, in turn, sister to a well-supported core Saxifraga- 
les. Core Saxifragales comprise two subclades: Crassula- 
ceae + Haloragaceae s.l. (i.e., Aphanopetalaceae, Tetracar- 
paeaceae, Penthoraceae, and Haloragaceae s.s.—families 
maintained as distinct in APG III 2009 and APG IV 2016) 
and the Saxifragaceae alliance. Within the Saxifragaceae 
alliance, Saxifragaceae + Grossulariaceae are sister to Ite- 
aceae + Pterostemonaceae. 
Strong support was found for Grossulariaceae (see Sen- 
ters and Soltis 2002 and Weigend et al. 2002 for phyloge- 
netic analyses of Ribes) as sister to Saxifragaceae (Soltis 
et al. 2001a), which, in turn, is sister to a clade of Ite- 
aceae + Pterostemonaceae. Crassulaceae (Mort et al. 2001) 
are well-supported as sister to a clade of Tetracarpaeaceae, 
Penthoraceae, Haloragaceae s.s., and Aphanopetalaceae. 
Tetracarpaea, Penthorum, and Aphanopetalum 
are 
all 
small genera that could be included within an expanded 
Haloragaceae (APG II 2003), but were retained as distinct 
families in APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016). 
Monophyly of Paeoniaceae, consisting solely of Paeonia, 
is strongly supported (e.g., Sang et al. 1997; Fishbein et al. 
2001; Jian et al. 2008). In recent analyses the family is sister 
to the woody clade, but support for this placement remains 
low (Jian et al. 2008). The relationships of Paeoniaceae 
have long been problematic and the family is morphologi- 
cally distinct compared to other Saxifragales. The family is 
polystemonous (i.e., having many stamens), a feature also 
found in some woody clade members: Hamamelidaceae and 
Cercidiphyllaceae have 1 to 24 stamens, although in Cerci- 
diphyllaceae delimitation of flowers is difficult (Fothergilla, 
Hamamelidaceae, has up to 24 stamens; in Cercidiphyllum 
there are no more than 7; Endress 1989a). Paeoniaceae also 
possess an apocarpous gynoecium of more than two car- 
pels, a feature shared only with Crassulaceae and Tetracar- 
paea of the Crassulaceae + Haloragaceae clade. 
Sequence data provided strong support for Altingiaceae 
(Liquidambar s.|. = Altingia + Liquidambar; Liquidambar 
as long defined is not monophyletic; Ickert-Bond and Wen 
2013) and also supported removal of Altingiaceae from 
Hamamelidaceae (Hoot et al. 1999; D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Fishbein et al. 2001), as proposed in studies of morphol- 
ogy, anatomy, cytology, and chemistry (Doweld 1998). 
Sequence data also supported the inclusion in Hamameli- 
daceae of Exbucklandia and Rhodoleia, two genera some- 
times excluded from Hamamelidaceae (Doweld 1998). 
Within Hamamelidaceae support has emerged for four 
clades corresponding to the four subfamilies, Exbucklandi- 
oideae, Mytilarioideae, Disanthoideae, and Hamamelidoi- 
deae (e.g., Li et al. 1999a,b; Li and Bogle 2001; Li 2008). 
The relationships of Cercidiphyllaceae and Daphniphyl- 
laceae were long contentious (reviewed in Cronquist 1981; 
Takhtajan 1997; Fishbein et al. 2001). Cercidiphyllum was 
Superrosids 
195 
considered closely related to Myrothamnus (now in Gun- 
nerales) (Hufford and Crane 1989; Hufford 1992) or to the 
early-diverging eudicot family Trochodendraceae (see Chap- 
ters 8 and 9). It was historically viewed as a derivative of the 
magnoliids, either distinct from hamamelids (Swamy and 
Bailey 1949) or transitional between magnoliids and hama- 
melids (Cronquist 1981). Daphniphyllum was variously 
considered closely related to Euphorbiaceae (Scholz 1964), 
Cercidiphyllum (Croizat 1941), and Hamamelidaceae (Bhat- 
nagar and Garg 1977; Cronquist 1981; Zavada and Dilcher 
1986; Sutton 1989; Takhtajan 1997). Gene sequence data 
indicate that Cercidiphyllaceae and Daphniphyllaceae to- 
gether are sister to Hamamelidaceae (Fig. 10.2). 
Cercidiphyllum can be traced back about 34 million 
years (Early Oligocene) based on its distinctive leaves and 
fruits (Fig. 10.5 e-g). Leaves and infructescences of extinct, 
likely stem-group relatives, of Cercidiphyllum, are com- 
mon in the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene of the Northern 
Hemisphere (Crane 1984; Crane and Stockey 1986) known 
as Trochodendroides (leaves, Fig. 10.5h), and Nyssidium 
(infructescences, Fig. 10.51). Inflorescences of Hamamelida- 
ceae are known from well-preserved flowers of Allonia and 
Androdecidua from the Late Cretaceous (Late Santonian) 
Allon site in Georgia, USA (Magallon et al. 1996, 2001), 
and the family is well represented in the Cenozoic based on 
fruits and seeds (fig. 10.5d). Altingiaceae are represented by 
Liquidambar leaves in the Eocene (MacGinitie 1941) and 
younger occurrences of both leaves and fruits (Pigg et al. 
2004). Well-preserved fruiting heads of the extinct Altin- 
giaceous genus, Steinhaurera, are common in the Eocene 
of Europe (Mai 1968; Collinson et al. 2012) (Fig. 10.5c). 
Placement of the parasite Cynomorium (Cynomoria- 
ceae) has been problematic. Some analysis placed Cynomo- 
rium coccineum (Cynomoriaceae) in Saxifragales (Nick- 
rent et al. 2005), albeit with low support, whereas others 
(Jian et al. 2008) placed Cynomoriaceae in Santalales, in 
agreement with some classifications (e.g., Cronquist 1981); 
sequences from the plastid inverted repeat placed the genus 
in Rosales close to Rosaceae (Zhang et al. 2009; Moore 
et al. 2011). Recent studies now place the genus in Saxifra- 
gales with strong support, although the closeset relatives of 
Cynomorium within Saxifragales are unclear (Renner pers. 
comm.; APG IV 2016). We show the family unplaced in 
Saxifragales (Fig. 10.2). Obviously, more study of Cyno- 
moriaceae is required. 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
IN SAXIFRAGALES 
Saxifragales are an important clade in which to examine 
floral evolution not only because they appear to be sister

to either the rosids alone or the rosids + Vitaceae, but in 
addition, although possessing only a few species, Saxifra- 
gales exhibit levels of diversity in floral morphology com- 
parable to the major eudicot clades. Thus, understanding 
floral diversification in Saxifragales may elucidate general 
evolutionary processes that operated early in eudicot diver- 
sification. We spend more time on character evolution in 
this clade than many others. 
The evolution of several floral characters has been ex- 
amined in Saxifragales using summary trees as well as a 
large tree with 909 species (Soltis et al. 2013): perianth 
merism, stamen number, anther dehiscence, and several gy- 
noecial features (carpel union, carpel number, and ovary 
position). Character reconstructions provided support for 
some longheld ideas about evolutionary trends in angio- 
sperms, but in other cases suggested opposing trends or 
labile evolution. 
Life history—Beginning from a perennial ancestor, there 
have been multiple shifts to the annual habit in Saxifraga- 
les (Soltis et al. 2013). Diversification analyses indicate that 
transitions from perenniality to the annual habit are rare, 
but that annual lineages diversify at a greater rate, mostly 
due to the higher propensity of extinction of perennial lin- 
eages. This results in few, but species-rich annual groups 
among extant taxa, in some cases with a seemingly long 
history of annuality (e.g., Crassula). The reverse transition 
(from annual to perennial) is more frequent, but leaves a 
weaker signal because perennial lineages tend to go extinct 
at a higher rate than annuals. Therefore, transitions to an- 
nuality tend to lead to the radiation of annual lineages that 
only rarely produce perennial descendants. In Aichryson 
(Crassulaceae), from an ancestor that was perennial there 
has been a shift to the annual habit and then only in a few 
cases a return to the perennial habit. 
Both woodiness and perenniality are associated with 
lower net diversification rates, although through different 
mechanisms. Woody lineages appear to have lower specia- 
tion rates than herbaceous taxa, which results in lower net 
diversification in spite of also having lower extinction rates 
compared to herbaceous taxa. Conversely, perenniality re- 
sults in higher speciation rates, but this habit is also associ- 
ated with higher rates of extinction. Annual species appear 
to have a significantly lower extinction rate, which leads to 
higher net diversification (Soltis et al. 2013). 
Perianth—A longstanding view of angiosperm floral 
evolution is a trend toward reduction in the number of 
perianth parts (Bessey 1915; Stebbins 1974; Cronquist 
1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1997). In agreement with 
these proposals, analyses of Saxifragales revealed a reduc- 
tion in number of perianth parts. In addition, the complete 
loss of perianth appears irreversible in this clade (perianth 
loss, not shown, has occurred independently in Altingia- 
Superrosids 
197 
ceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, and some Hamamelidaceae; for 
the latter see Endress 1978). 
From an ancestral state of pentamery, most transitions 
within Saxifragales (trees not shown) are putative reduc- 
tions in merism (e.g., to tetramerous in some Crassulaceae 
and Haloragaceae) or a loss of stability in merism (Paeoni- 
aceae, Hamamelidaceae, staminate Cercidiphyllum) (Soltis 
et al. 2013). Three transitions in petal number are equally 
common in Saxifragales (all other transition types rare or 
absent): 5 to 0; 5 to 4; 5 to 6-10 (Fig. 10.6). An increase 
in petal number above the typical number of five is seen in 
Paeoniaceae and also in multiple cases in Crassulaceae. In 
fact, the same Crassulaceae showing an increase in stamen 
number exhibit an increase in petal number (see below; 
Soltis et al. 2013). A transition from five to four petals oc- 
curred multiple times, with major shifts to four exempli- 
fied by Haloragaceae s.s. and the large genus Kalanchoe 
(Crassulaceae). These shifts are also accompanied by a 
change in carpel number to four, revealing again that some 
traits appear coupled. The complete loss of petals also is 
uniform in some clades (e.g., Cercidiphyllum + Dapniphyl- 
lum, Chrysosplenium, and Liquidambar). 
Androecium—Another longstanding view is that an- 
giosperms were ancestrally polystemonous (numerous sta- 
mens) with a trend toward reduction in the number of sta- 
mens (Bessey 1915; Sprague 1925; Cronquist 1988; Leins 
and Erbar 1991, 1994; Takhtajan 1991; Ronse De Craene 
and Smets 1993). Others proposed that both increases and 
decreases in stamen number have occurred (Stebbins 1974; 
Takhtajan 1991; Ronse De Craene and Smets 1992), al- 
though both Stebbins (1974) and Cronquist (1988) sug- 
gested that reductions have been much more common than 
increases. 
In Saxifragales, however, polystemony in Paeonia is 
clearly derived from an ancestral state of diplostemony 
(10 stamens). Two additional independent origins of polys- 
temony from diplostemony have occurred within Hamame- 
lidaceae, in which Fothergilla and Matudaea both exhibit 
polystemony (reconstruction not shown), but with both 
centrifugal and centripetal development (Endress 1976). 
Endress assumed that polystemony evolved separately in 
these two genera, a hypothesis supported by molecular 
studies because they are not sister taxa (Li et al. 1999a). 
Anther dehiscence—Despite the wide occurrence 
of 
valvate anther dehiscence among basal angiosperms and 
early-diverging eudicots, as well as the presence of this pat- 
tern in the earliest well-preserved fossil stamens (Crane and 
Blackmore 1989; Crane et al. 1995), this condition is not 
necessarily a plesiomorphic feature for the angiosperms. 
Possibly, only the predisposition for easy development of 
valvate dehiscence was present in the earliest angiosperms, 
which may have possessed anthers that dehisced via simple

longitudinal slits. This predisposition would have been lost 
in more derived angiosperms (Endress 1986a,b, 1989a; En- 
dress and Hufford 1989; Hufford and Endress 1989). 
Our reconstructions place longitudinal anther dehis- 
cence as ancestral for Saxifragales with at least one shift 
to valvate dehiscence occurring in members of the woody 
clade. The number of times the trait of valvate dehiscence 
arose in the woody clade is not clear, but it may have arisen 
in the ancestor of the clade. Valvate anther dehiscence in 
Saxifragales does not appear to be homologous with that 
found in basal angiosperms or early-diverging eudicots 
(e.g., Trochodendraceae, Platanaceae). The presence of 
longitudinal dehiscence in Disanthus (Hamamelidaceae) 
is noteworthy in that, because of its derived phylogenetic 
position within Hamamelidaceae, Disanthus clearly rep- 
resents a reversal within the family from valvate back to 
longitudinal dehiscence. Thus, anther dehiscence within Sa- 
xifragales may be more labile than previously envisioned. 
Carpel number and union—Reductions in number of 
carpels and increasing syncarpy have been widely accepted 
as major trends in the angiosperms, with reversals con- 
sidered unlikely (e.g., Bessey 1915; Sprague 1925; Grant 
1950; Cronquist 1968, 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1969, 1987, 
1991; Stebbins 1974). It has been proposed that syncarpy 
offers a selective advantage over apocarpy due to increased 
pollination efficiency (Carr and Carr 1961; Stebbins 1974; 
Endress 1982; Takhtajan 1991) and centralized selection 
of male gametophytes (Endress 1982); it is also a precon- 
dition for fruit diversification (Endress 1982; Takhtajan 
1991). Intermediate stages have also been proposed for the 
evolution of syncarpy. Cronquist (1988), for example, sug- 
gested that partial syncarpy, in which the apical portion of 
the gynoecium remains free (as in many Saxifragales), is 
an intermediate between apocarpy and complete syncarpy. 
Character mapping provided evidence against the long- 
standing view that there has been a reduction in carpel 
number (not shown) in Saxifragaceae and other Saxifraga- 
les. Saxifragales were inferred to be ancestrally bicarpellate 

with at least two (perhaps more—results not shown) inde- 
pendent increases in carpel number. 
Analyses of carpel union in Saxifragales also argued 
against the widely accepted trend of increased syncarpy. 
The ancestral condition for Saxifragales is carpels that are 
free apically; the extensive variation in the degree of carpel 
union in Saxifragales is shown (Fig. 10.7). Several indepen- 
dent derivations of free carpels (apocarpy) have occurred 
in Saxifragales: in Paeoniaceae, Tetracarpaea, and some 
Crassulaceae. Other putative cases of apocarpy derived 
from syncarpous ancestors include Apocynaceae, Malva- 
ceae, Rutaceae, and Simaroubaceae (Endress et al. 1983; 
Fallen 1986; Sennblad and Bremer 1996). Other instances 
of secondary apocarpy 
or perhaps secondary 
partial 
apocarpy were later shown in Crossosomatales (Matthews 
and Endress 2005b) and some genera of Sapindales (Bache-

lier and Endress 2008, 2009). There are several independent 
transitions to completely fused carpels (Aphanopetalum, 
Pterosteomon, Ribes) from carpels partially fused (free api- 
cally), but no direct transitions from apocarpy to complete 
syncarpy were reconstructed within Saxifragales, although 
this transformation was the traditionally accepted pattern 
of evolution. 
The ancestral carpel number in Saxifragales is recon- 
structed as two (Soltis et al. 2013), which also character- 
izes Vitaceae (outgroup), as well as the woody clade, and 
is maintained in major subclades such as Saxifragaceae 
and Grossulariaceae. Several prominent increases in carpel 
number occur, and these often characterize major clades 
and can serve as potential synapomorphies in some cases. 
There are variable numbers of carpels in Paeoniaceae 
and four carpels in the clade of Haloragaceae s.s., Apha-

an increase to four carpels in Peridiscaceae and five in all 
Crassulaceae, in which there is a decrease to four and con- 
stituting a synapomorphy for the large genus Kalanchoe. 
A further amplification in carpel number occurs in other 
Crassulaceae. For more than five carpels in general, see also 
Endress (2014). 
Ovary position—The position of the ovary (gynoecium) 
(Fig. 10.8) has a major impact on floral architecture, con- 
comitantly influencing various interactions with animals, 
such as predation, pollination, and seed dispersal (e.g., 
Grant 1950; Stebbins 1974; Thompson 1994; Thompson 
et al. 2013). In general, ovary positions have been treated 
as either superior or inferior according to the point of at- 
tachment of the perianth and androecium relative to the 
ovary in an anthetic (i.e., open or mature) flower. 
A superior ovary is one that is situated above the point 
of attachment of the perianth and androecium to form 
a hypogynous flower; an inferior ovary has the perianth 
and androecium attached above the ovary to form an 
epigynous flower (Fig. 10.8). Flowers in which the outer 
floral appendages are basally fused to form a floral cup, 
or hypanthium, that surrounds the ovary are often called 
perigynous. 
Ovary position has long been considered a key descrip- 
tive and stable feature (Grant 1950; Stebbins 1974) that is 
sometimes used to distinguish related families. 
A common 
view is that ovary position has evolved in a unidirectional 
manner from superior to greater inferiority, generally via 
congenital fusion of the outer floral appendages to the 
ovary wall (e.g., Langdon 1939; Douglas 1944; Gauthier 
1950; Eames 1961); reversals were considered rare or im- 
possible (Bessey 1915; Grant 1950; Cronquist 1968, 1988; 
Takhtajan 1969, 1991; Stebbins 1974). The putative selec- 
tive advantage of epigyny is protection of ovules (Grant 
1950; Stebbins 1974; Takhtajan 1991). Epigyny also brings 
the perianth whorl into additional contact with the androe- 
cium, permitting more interactions between these whorls 
in synorganized flowers. Reversals to superior ovaries were 
thought to be constrained by the complex alterations of de- 
velopmental pathways presumed to be associated with the 
formation of inferior ovaries (Grant 1950; Stebbins 1974). 
Families and orders that display extensive variation in 
ovary position have long been of evolutionary interest (e.g., 
Klopfer 1973; Stebbins 1974; Cronquist 1988; Gustafsson 
and Albert 1999). Ovary position is highly variable in the 
small family Saxifragaceae, ranging from inferior to what 
has been termed superior with a complete range of interme- 
diate positions (Figs. 10.7, 10.8). In fact, this entire range of 
Ovary positions is present within single genera (e.g., Litho-

phragma, Saxifraga s.s., Micranthes, and Chrysosplenium; 
Hitchcock et al. 1961; Taylor 1965; Elvander 1984; Webb 
and Gornall 1989; Soltis et al. 1993; Soltis and Hufford 
2002). Even at this level, unidirectional ovary evolution 
from superior to increasing inferiority was invoked to ex- 
plain the remarkable range of ovary positions (e.g., Taylor 
1965; Stebbins 1974). 
Reconstructions reveal that many families of Saxifraga- 
les are stable in ovary position (superior for many clades). 
However, both Saxifragaceae and Hamamelidaceae are 
labile with frequent transitions among the three positions 
scored (inferior, subinferior [also called semi-inferior], su- 
perior) (Fig. 10.9). Attesting to this dynamic pattern, nearly 
all ovary position transitions occur at an equal frequency 

(that is, from inferior to subinferior and the reverses from 
superior to subinferior and the reverse; and inferior directly 
to superior) (Soltis et al. 2013), with only direct transitions 
from superior to inferior half as frequent as the above. 
Ovary position evolution is thus particularly dynamic in 
Saxifragaceae, even within genera (Kuzoff et al. 1998, 
1999, 2001; Mort and Soltis 1999; Soltis et al. 2001b). 
For example, ovary position evolution in Lithophragma 
has gone toward greater superiority in some lineages and 
greater inferiority in others, contrary to the longstanding

view of a unidirectional trend in ovary position evolution 
(Kuzoff et al. 2001; reviewed in Soltis et al. 2003a). The 
Heuchera group had a subinferior ancestor with multiple 
transitions to a superior and inferior ovary. In contrast, Mz- 
cranthes had a superior ovary as the ancestral state, with 
transitions to both subinferior and completely inferior ova- 
ries. Similar evolutionary shifts from inferior to superior 
ovaries have occurred in other groups (Endress 2011b,c).

sification (Kuzoff et al. 2001; Soltis et al. 2003a). Typically, 
ovary positions have been described and decisions concern- 
ing structural homology made exclusively on the basis of 
anthetic (i.e., mature) floral structure. As reviewed, supe- 
rior and inferior ovaries typically are distinguished by the 
point of attachment of other floral organs relative to the 
ovary in anthetic flowers (Fig. 10.8). Early floral develop- 
ment serves as an additional line of evidence to distinguish 
between flowers that are hypogynous versus epigynous 
(Kuzoff et al. 2001; Soltis and Hufford 2002). Boke (1963, 
1964) and Kaplan (1967) demonstrated that hypogynous 
and epigynous flowers actually differ from the time of or- 
ganogenesis, but the significance of their research has often 
been overlooked. There are two basic ground plans of flo- 
ral development, hypogynous and appendicular epigynous 
(reviewed in Fig. 10.10).

Studies of floral development in Saxifragaceae have indi- 
cated that species with putatively superior ovaries actually 
have an appendicular epigynous ground plan (Figs. 10.10, 
10.11; e.g., Kuzoff et al. 2001; Soltis and Hufford 2002; 
Soltis et al. 2003a). Thus, these ovaries are not truly supe- 
rior but represent “superior mimics” or “pseudosuperior” 
ovaries. Pseudosuperior ‘ovaries should not be considered 
homologous to truly superior ovaries derived from an hy- 
pogynous ground plan. Importantly, in Saxifragaceae the 
ovary position at anthesis is a consequence of the amount 
of vertical extension of the inferior versus superior region 
of the ovary. Differences in ovary position are a direct 
result of allometric shifts in the growth proportions of 
the superior versus inferior regions (Kuzoff et al. 2001), 
as observed for Lithophragma (Fig. 10.11). The relative 
ease with which allometric shifts can occur in the course

Patterns of ovary development in angiosperms. The early floral conformation of most hypogynous flowers represents what is termed a hypogynous 
ground plan (A). Hypogynous flowers generally exhibit a convex floral apex throughout organogenesis (e.g., Endress 1994c). This ground plan is common in the 
angiosperms and likely accounts for many flowers with ovaries described as “superior” based on the examination of anthetic flowers. An hypogynous ground plan 
characterizes many basal angiosperm lineages, such as Piperaceae and Alismataceae, as well as some early-branching eudicots, such as members of Ranunculaceae 
and Papaveraceae (Sattler 1973). Most inferior ovaries are the result of an appendicular epigynous pattern of floral development (B). Appendicular epigyny also be- 
gins with a convex floral apex, but during or just after perianth initiation the floral apex becomes concave (Boke 1964, 1966; Kaplan 1967; Leins 1972: Magin 1977; 
reviewed in D. Soltis et al. 2003c).

of evolution explains the wide range of ovary positions in 
Saxifragaceae, as well as the numerous reversals that have 
occurred. Thompson et al. (2013) have shown that insect 
pollinator interactions with Lithophragma can drive ovary 
position to be more superior or more inferior. These data 
also indicate that gynoecial evolution may be more rapid 
than generally maintained, an important result in light of 
studies in Saxifragaceae that suggest ovary position affects 
pollinator preferences (e.g., Thompson and Pellmyr 1992; 
Thompson 1994; Segraves and Thompson 1999). 
Data for Saxifragales have broader implications for flo- 
ral evolution. The same processes described for gynoecia 
in Saxifragales are likely operating throughout the rosids

Gynoecial 
development in Lithophragma 
(Saxifragaceae). Ontogenetic studies 
have indicated that all species of 
Lithophragma and relatives have an 
appendicular epigynous develop- 
mental ground plan (see text). Early 
floral ontogeny (A, B, and C) is 
identical in species of Lithophragma 
having very different ovary posi- 
tions at anthesis (D, E, and F) (see 
Fig. 10.9). The right-hand arrow 
on the flower section indicates the 
point of attachment of the hypan- 
thium to the ovary (note superior, S, 
end inferior, |, portions of the ovary); 
k = calyx, c = corolla, st = stamen. In 
Lithophragma, the ovary position at 
anthesis (D, E, and F) is the result of 
the amount of vertical extension of 
the inferior versus superior region of 
the ovary. Differences in ovary posi- 
tion are the direct result of allometric 
shifts in the growth proportions of 
the superior versus inferior regions. 
(Modified from Kuzoff et al. 2001 
and Soltis et al. 2005.) 
(Soltis and Hufford 2002). Truly inferior ovaries derived 
from an epigynous ground plan may actually be the ple- 
siomorphic state for many rosids. Data for the rosid fam- 
ily Vochysiaceae suggested that floral development is the 
same as in Saxifragaceae (Litt 1999; Litt and Stevenson 
2003). Richardson et al. (2000) similarly proposed that the 
Saxifragaceae model of ovary position diversification also 
occurs in Rhamnaceae. Similar allometric shifts in develop- 
ment may explain the transition to a superficially superior 
ovary in Gaertnera (Rubiaceae; Igersheim et al. 1994). De- 
velopmental complexities are present in Rosaceae, however, 
in which species of Physocarpus and Oemlera have flowers 
that exhibit a concave floral apex before gynoecial initia- 

204 Chapter 10 
tion, yet have clearly superior ovaries at maturity (Evans 
and Dickinson 1999a,b). In contrast to the lability noted 
in Saxifragales and these other examples, ovary position is 
strongly fixed in many groups. More studies of gynoecial 
development and development genetics are clearly needed. 
ROSIDS 
OVERVIEW 
Initial DNA analyses (Chase et al. 1993; Savolainen et al. 
2000a; 18S rDNA, Soltis et al. 1997b) recovered a rosid 
clade that included more families than belonged to rosid 
groups (e.g., Rosidae, Rosanae) in morphology-based clas- 
sifications (Cronquist 1981, 1988; Dahlgren 1983; Takhta- 
jan 1987, 1997; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001). Analysis of non- 
DNA characters by Hufford (1992) and Nandi et al. (1998) 
also recovered a large rosid clade, broader than tradition- 
ally recognized. However, the taxon sampling of Hufford 
(1992) was small and there were odd placements (e.g., the 
clade also included Caryophyllales). None of these non- 
DNA analyses provided internal support (e.g., bootstrap or 
jackknife) above 50% for this expanded rosid clade. 
As DNA datasets were combined, strong support ulti- 
mately emerged for the monophyly of a rosid clade, ex- 
cluding Vitaceae (= eurosids). As reviewed, the interrela- 
tionships among Saxifragales, Vitales, and remaining rosids 
(eurosids) have varied across analyses. Here, we follow the 
17-gene results (see APG III 2009 and APG IV 2016) and 
consider Vitales + eurosids to constitute the rosid clade. 
The rosid clade 
as delineated 
via DNA 
is enor- 
mous, encompassing 
approximately 
140 
families 
and 
70,000 species—over one-fourth of all angiosperm spe- 
cies and roughly 39% of eudicot species diversity (Magal- 
lon et al. 1999). The clade includes most lineages of ex- 
tant temperate and tropical forest trees. The oldest fossils 
representing the clade are impression and compression 
specimens of the informally named “Rose Creek flower,” 
from the late Albian of the Dakota Formation in Nebraska 
(ca. 102 mya) (Fig. 10.5a,b; Basinger and Dilcher 1984). 
A younger, well-preserved charcoalified flower known as 
Paleoclusia from the late Santonian to Turonian (about 84— 
89.5 mya; Crepet and Nixon 1998; Magallon et al. 1999) 
appears, as indicated in initial morphological cladistic anal- 
yses, to be related to Clusiaceae (Crepet and Nixon 1998) 
(see Supplementary Table 10.1 for selected rosid fossils; at 
press.uchicago.edu/sites/soltis/) and may be either a stem of 
the family or perhaps derived from within the crown group 
based on combined morphological and molecular analyses 
(Ruhfel et al. 2013). 
In addition to most of those families previously placed 
in the traditional Rosidae, many families of former Dille- 
niidae and Hamamelidae (see Chapter 3) are also placed 
in the rosid clade by DNA data. Casuarinaceae, Fagaceae, 
Juglandaceae, Moraceae, Myricaceae, Ulmaceae, and Urti- 
caceae are all members of the former Hamamelidae now 
placed in the rosid clade. Similarly, Brassicaceae, Carica- 
ceae, Datiscaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Malvaceae, Ochna- 
ceae, Passifloraceae, and Violaceae are some of the fami- 
lies of Dilleniidae now part of the rosid clade. Even a few 
families formerly placed in Magnoliidae (e.g., Coriariaceae, 
Corynocarpaceae) are now considered rosids. Conversely, 
a few families of Rosidae of morphology-based classifica- 
tions have been shown to be asterids (e.g., Apiaceae, Aralia- 
ceae, Cornaceae, Hydrangeaceae, and Pittosporaceae; see 
Chapter 11). Although great progress has been made in de- 
fining clades and resolving relationships within the rosids, 
some relationships remain poorly understood (see Endress 
et al. 2013). 
Non-DNA synapomorphies are still unclear for the 
rosid clade, as well as for most subclades (orders) within 
the rosids. Although several morphological and anatomi- 
cal features are shared by many rosids, none of these traits 
represent a clear synapomorphy. Noteworthy shared non- 
DNA features of rosids include nuclear endosperm develop- 
ment, reticulate pollen exine, generally simple perforations 
of vessel end-walls, alternate intervessel pitting, mucilagi- 
nous leaf epidermis, ellagic acid (see Chapter 8), flowers 
with separate petals, and often two (diplostemony) or more’ 
whorls of stamens (Hufford 1992; Nandi et al. 1998). 
One factor contributing to the complexity of the rosids is 
the sheer size of the group. However, aspects other than size 
contribute to the poor understanding of rosid relationships. 
The asterid clade, which is of comparable size, is much bet- 
ter understood in terms of relationships, possible non-DNA 
synapomorphies, and character evolution (see Chapter 11). 
Similarly, enormous advances have been made in elucidat- 
ing monocot relationships (see Chapter 7). Another reason 
the rosid clade has been so problematic is that, as noted, 
it contains many morphologically disparate families that 
were long considered so distinctive they were placed in four 
different subclasses. These morphologically diverse fami- 
lies are now interdigitated within the rosid clade. Hence 
in many cases, families now considered closely related in 
the rosid clade were not considered closely related in the 
past; as a result, the uniting morphological, chemical, and 
other non-DNA characters have been little studied, making 
them difficult to ascertain. The floral structure of a number 
of newly recognized suprafamilial clades in molecular phy- 
logenetic studies have been studied and thus also morpho- 
logically characterized by reproductive structures since the 
first edition of this book: Celastrales (Matthews and En- 
dress 2005a), some subclades of Malpighiales (Matthews 
and Endress 2008, 2011, 2013; Matthews et al. 2012; 

Endress et al. 2013), and Sapindales (Bachelier 4nd Endress 
2007, 2008, 2009; Bachelier et al. 2011). 
Further complicating the problem, many non-DNA 
characters of interest have not been surveyed throughout 
the rosids. There are so many gaps in taxonomic coverage 
of non-DNA characters that the potential utility of many 
traits cannot be meaningfully assessed until more basic sur- 
vey work is conducted. In contrast, although the asterid 
clade is larger than the Asteridae of recent classifications, 
most of the additions (e.g., Cornales, Ericales) have been 
placed at the basalmost nodes. The core asterids remain 
highly similar to the Asteridae recognized long before 
DNA-based phylogenetic analyses. 
Early phylogenetic 
studies revealed two large sub- 
clades within the rosids, but neither obtained bootstrap 
or jackknife support above 50% (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; 
Savolainen et al. 2000a,b). These large clades were initially 
termed rosid I and II (see Chase et al. 1993) or eurosid 
I and II (Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000). 
Analyses of combined molecular datasets provided the first 
internal support for these two large subclades of rosids 
(Fig. 10.1). Multi-gene studies of 3 to 5 genes provided in- 
creased resolution and support of rosids and a large sub- 
clade of fabids or Fabidae, as defined below (e.g., P. Soltis 
et al. 1999a; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Burleigh et al. 2009), but 
the exact circumscription of these two large subclades as 
well as relationships within the subclades remained unclear 
following these large analyses. 
Recent analyses with broad taxonomic sampling and 
large numbers of plastid genes (Wang et al. 2009; Moore 
et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011) have provided a greatly im- 
proved understanding of rosid phylogeny, which form the 
two large clades noted above, each with maximal bootstrap 
support: (i) eurosids I (Fabidae) include Cucurbitales, Fa- 
bales, Fagales, Rosales (the nitrogen-fixing clade), Zygo- 
phyllales, and Celastrales, Malpighiales, and Oxalidales 
(the COM clade of Endress and Matthews 2006), these last 
three based just on plastid DNA; and (ii) eurosids II (Malvi- 
dae) include Huerteales, Brassicales, Malvales, Sapindales, 
Geraniales, Myrtales, Crossosomatales, and Picramniales. 
As reviewed below, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data 
favor a placement of the COM clade with the malvids. 
RAPID DIVERSIFICATION 
The rosid clade (70,000 species) not only is enormous, 
but also includes most lineages of extant temperate and 
tropical forest trees. Sequence data indicate that the rosid 
clade diversified rapidly into the major lineages (fabids and 
malvids) over a period of <15 million years, and perhaps in 
as little as 4 to 5 million years (Fig. 10.1). The timing of the 
Superrosids 
205 
inferred rapid radiation of rosids (108 to 91 million years 
ago [mya] and 107-83 mya for Fabidae and Malvidae, re- 
spectively) corresponds with the rapid rise of angiosperm- 
dominated forests and the concomitant diversification of 
other clades that inhabit these forests. Ants (Moreau et al. 
2006), beetles, and hemipterans (Farrell 1998; Wilf et al. 
2000), amphibians (Roelants et al. 2007), ferns (Schneider 
et al. 2004), and some mammals (e.g., primates, Bininda- 
Emonds et al. 2007)—appear to have closely tracked the 
rise of rosid-dominated forests (H. Wang et al. 2009) and 
diversified “in the shadow of the angiosperms” (Schneider 
et al. 2004— original quote as applied to ferns). 
VITALES 
In morphology-based classifications, Vitaceae have been 
placed within Rosidae, typically within Rhamnales (Cron- 
quist 1981). However, as reviewed, the DNA placement of 
Vitaceae, which include Leea (alternately recognized in a 
separate family, Leeaceae; see Ingrouille et al. 2002), is with 
rosids and Saxifragales, although the position of Vitales 
differs among DNA phylogenetic analyses. In earlier phy- 
logenetic studies (e.g., Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Hilu et al. 2003), as well as some recent ones 
(e.g., Worberg et al. 2009), the circumscription of “euro- 
sids” and “rosids” tended to exclude Vitaceae. However, 
there has been a trend towards inclusion of Vitaceae in ro- 
sids (e.g., APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; Wang 
et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011) (Fig. 10.1). As reviewed, more 
analyses are needed to evaluate this placement further. 
Inclusion of Leea (Leeaceae) (illustrated in Fig. 10.3i) in 
Vitaceae has a long history. Bentham and Hooker (1862- 
1883) recognized only three genera in Vitaceae: Leea, Vitis, 
and Pterisanthes. Thorne (1992a,b) also placed Leea in Vi- 
taceae as a distinct subfamily. Most modern classifications, 
however, have followed Planchon (1887) in placing Leea 
in its own family, Leeaceae, and recognizing 10 genera in 
Vitaceae. If treated as a distinct family in classifications, 
Leeaceae, the author(s) also recognized that it had a close 
relationship to Vitaceae (e.g., Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 
1997; Judd et al. 2002, 2008). DNA data early indicated 
that Leea (Leeoideae) is sister to the remainder of the fam- 
ily (Vitoideae) (Ingrouille et al. 2002). Subsequent analyses 
have also revealed a number of subclades within Vitoideae 
(Wen et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2011; Ren et al. 2011; Trias- 
Blasi et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013). For example, Ren et al. 
(2011) recovered subclades in the Vitoideae subclade that 
correspond with floral morphology (4-merous flowers vs. 
5-merous flowers). 
Putative synapomorphies of Vitaceae (including Leea) 
include raphide sacs, specialized stalked, gland-headed 

206 Chapter 10 
hairs, diminutive calyx, valvate corolla, stamens opposite 
the petals, and berries with distinctive seeds. The seeds have 
a cordlike raphe on the adaxial surface, extending from the 
hilum to the seed apex and onto the convex abaxial side, 
where it joins a round to linear depressed to somewhat el- 
evated chalazal knot. The seeds also have a pair of deep 
grooves flanking the raphe. The endosperm is thus three- 
lobed (Judd et al. 2008). 
The fossil record of Vitaceae is anomalously young rela- 
tive to the deep phylogenetic split from other rosids that 
are represented in the fossil record back to the Cenomanian 
(Supplementary Table 10.1). Despite a rich paleobotanical 
record of distinctive vitaceous seeds in the Cenozoic, the 
seeds are missing from the Cretaceous charcoalified fossil 
assemblages of Europe and North America that have yielded 
other early Rosid representatives. The oldest known record 
for the Vitaceae is fruits with intact seeds from the upper- 
most Cretaceous of India (Late Maastrichtian, ca. 66 mya; 
Fig. 10.5j,k). India, at that time, was a tectonically isolated 
island rafting northward from the Southern Hemisphere. 
This suggests that the grape family originated in the South- 
ern Hemisphere. The paucity of well-studied Cretaceous 
floras in the Southern Hemisphere may explain the missing 
early record of this family (Manchester et al. 2013). The 
complicated biogeographic history of this family is under- 
scored by the presence of Leea (Fig. 10.3i), which is now 
confined to the Asian-Malesian tropics, in the Oligocene 
of South America (Fig. 10.51, m; Manchester et al. 2012). 
FABIDS AND MALVIDS 
Due to their rapid radiation, resolving relationships within 
Rosidae has been difficult (Hilu et al. 2003; Soltis et al. 
2005b, 2007c, 2011; Jansen et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2007; 
Wang et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Qiu et al. 2010; 
Lee et al. 2011), but multi-gene studies recover two major 
subclades—Fabidae (eurosid I, fabids) and Malvidae (euro- 
sid II, malvids) (Jansen et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2007c, 2011; 
Burleigh et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2010, 
2011; Qiu et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2012). However, Celas- 
trales, Oxalidales, and Malpighiales (the COM clade) have 
sometimes been placed in the malvid clade with nuclear 
or mtDNA gene sequences, a placement also supported by 
floral structure (Endress and Matthews 2006). We address 
this incongruence in more detail below. 
Fabids 
We follow the circumscription of fabids given in APG III 
(2009) and APG IV (2016) (Fig. 10.12), but stress that re- 
cent evidence indicates that the COM clade may be of an- 
cient reticulate origin (see below)—if this is indeed the case 
the COM clade could be treated as part of both the malvids 
and the fabids. 
ZYGOPHYLLALES 
The morphologically 
distinct Krameria (Krameriaceae) 
and Zygophyllaceae s.s. have formed a strongly supported 
(100%) clade in DNA analyses (e.g., Savolainen et al. 
2000a; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2007c, 2011; H. Wang et al. 
2009; Fig 10.12; representatives shown in Fig. 10.13h,i). 
However, a close relationship between these two families 
had not been suggested in any previous non-DNA based 
classifications. Krameria had been variously placed in Fa- 
baceae (Caesalpinioideae; reviewed in Cronquist 1981), 
Polygalales (Cronquist 1981), or Vochysiales (Heywood 
1993; Takhtajan 1997). Zygophyllaceae, a heterogeneous 
assemblage of 25 genera, have been variously placed in five 
different orders, but have most frequently been classified in 
Sapindales or Geraniales (e.g., Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 
1997): 
Synapomorphies for Zygophyllales remain unclear. Kra- 
meria shares few features with Zygophyllaceae (Sheahan 
and Chase 2000). Hence, it seems justified to maintain Zy- 
gophyllaceae and Krameriaceae as distinct families (as in 
APG III 2009 and APG IV 2016) rather than combining 
them into a single broadly defined Zygophyllaceae (as in” 
APG II 2003). Relationships within Zygophyllaceae are 
discussed in detail by Sheahan and Chase (1996, 2000). 
Zygophyllaceae and Krameriaceae also share few non- 
DNA traits with any other rosid lineage. Anthraquinones 
are present in Zygophyllaceae, and these are also common 
in the nitrogen-fixing clade (Nandi et al. 1998), but rare 
elsewhere, so this could be a synapomorphy (Sheahan and 
Chase 2000). However, there is no evidence from DNA 
analyses to support a close relationship with the nitrogen- 
fixing clade (Soltis et al. 2011). In fact, with large datasets 
Zygophyllaes appear with strong support as sister to rest of 
the fabid clade (e.g., Soltis et al. 2011; Fig. 10.12). 
NITROGEN-FIXING CLADE 
DNA analyses strongly support a clade of Rosales, Fabales, 
Cucurbitales, and Fagales (APG 1998; APG II 2003; APG 
III 2009; APGIV 2016; Figs. 10.1, 10.12). Fabales, followed 
by Rosales, are subsequent sisters to Fagales + Cucurbitales. 
As reviewed below, these orders share a genetic predisposi- 
tion for nitrogen fixation via root nodules; this condition 
represents a possible synapomorphy for this group of four 
orders. Only 10 of the approximately 400 families (APG 
Ill 2009; APG IV 2016) of angiosperms form symbiotic 
associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria involving root

distantly related. Cronquist (1981, 1988), for example, 
distributed these families among four of his six subclasses 
of dicots. Thus, the presence of these 10 families in one 
well-defined clade is a remarkable result. The monophyly 
of those angiosperms forming such symbiotic associations 
was initially indicated by rbcL sequences alone (Soltis et al. 
1995). The clade containing these 10 families has been re- 
ferred to since that time as the nitrogen-fixing clade. Maxi- 
mal BS support has ultimately emerged for this clade (see 
Soltis et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2009), reinforcing the hy- 
pothesis of a single origin of the predisposition of nitrogen- 
fixing symbiosis (Soltis et al. 1995; see Werner et al. 2014). 
Some of the nitrogen-fixing families (Betulaceae, Casu- 
arinaceae, Fabaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Myricaceae, and Ulma- 
ceae) also share the ability to produce nodular hemoglobin 
(Landsmann et al. 1986), also known as leghemoglobin, 
which has clear similarities to hemoglobin (and is also red in 
color). However, many of the tamilies in the nitrogen-fixing 
clade do not form symbiotic associations with nitrogen- 
fixing bacteria; furthermore, many of the genera and spe- 
cies within the 10 nitrogen-fixing families also lack this 
symbiosis (Table 10.1). The process of nitrogen-fixation in 
members of the nitrogen-fixing clade has been the subject 
of multiple reviews (e.g., Sprent 2005; Kneip et al. 2007; 
Santi et al. 2013) and also many subsequent analyses. Ex- 
amining the bacteria, Clawson et al. (2004) detected three

major Frankia clades and determined that these diverged 
early during the emergence of eudicots in the Cretaceous. 
The morphologically diverse mix of families present in 
the nitrogen-fixing clade illustrates well the problem of di- 
agnosing DNA-based clades within the rosids with non- 
DNA characters. Families of Fagales (Betulaceae, Casuari- 
naceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, and Myricaceae) represent 
former higher Hamamelidae. Other former hamamelids 
are found in Rosales, including Cannabaceae, Ulmaceae, 
Moraceae, and Urticaceae; Rosales also include mem- 
bers of the formerly recognized subclass Rosidae, such 
as Elaeagnaceae, Fabaceae, Rhamnaceae, and Rosaceae. 
Many Cucurbitales were placed in Dilleniidae (e.g., Bego- 
niaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and Datiscaceae), with one family 
in the order, Coriariaceae, placed in Magnoliidae as part of 
Ranunculales. 
Within the nitrogen-fixing clade, the monophyly of each 
of the four subclades (Rosales, Cucurbitales, Fagales, and 
Fabales) is also well supported (e.g., H. Wang et al. 2009; 
Soltis et al. 2011); Fabales and then Rosales are sister to 
Fagales + Cucurbitales (Fig. 10.12). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
NITROGEN-FIXING SYMBIOSIS 
Root nodules are induced and inhabited by one of two 
groups of distantly related bacteria. Species of Rhizobia- 
Superrosids 
209 
ceae (gram-negative motile rods) nodulate the legumes and 
Parasponia (Cannabaceae; formerly of Celtidaceae; Trinick 
and Galbraith 1980). In the legumes, the symbiont is Rhi- 
zobium, Bradyrhizobium, or Azorhizobium; only Brady- 
rhizobium is symbiotic with Parasponia. Actinomycetes of 
the genus Frankia (gram-positive, non—endospore-forming, 
mycelial bacteria) nodulate hosts in the remaining families 
(Table 10.1); these plants are referred to as actinorhizal 
(Akkermans and van Dijk 1981). Gunneraceae, a fam- 
ily that hosts nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts in 
shoots (rather than in root nodules), were not found to be a 
member of the nitrogen-fixing clade, but instead appeared 
(with Myrothamnaceae) as sister to all other core eudicots. 
Gunneraceae therefore represent an independent evolution 
of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in angiosperms. 
Putative gains and losses of nitrogen-fixing symbioses 
within the nitrogen-fixing clade have been discussed by 
Soltis et al. (1995), Swensen (1996), Swensen and Benson 
(2008), Doyle (2011), and Werner et al. (2014). The hy- 
pothesized predisposition that enabled the evolution of 
nodulation appeared approximately 100 million years ago 
(mya) and was retained in the four major lineages (Rosales, 
Cucurbitales, Fagales, Fabales) that then radiated rapidly 
after the origin of the nitrogen-fixing clade. The most de- 
tailed reconstruction of the evolution of nitrogen-fixing 
symbiosis is the recent study of Werner et al. (2014), who 
employed over 3400 species and assembled the largest 
database of nodulating plant species. Their analyses con- 
firmed a single origin of the predisposition of N, fixation 
(Soltis et al. 1995) in what they term a “cryptic evolution- 
ary innovation driving symbiotic N,-fixation evolution” 
(p. 1, Soltis et al. 1995). This innovation was followed by 
~8 subsequent actual origins of N, fixation with ~10 losses. 
To illustrate the complexity of nitrogen-fixation symbio- 
sis across the entire clade, we reconstructed the pattern of 
gain and loss of symbiosis on a simple summary phylo- 
genetic tree that represents the best estimate of phylogeny 
(Fig. 10.14). Our goals are to illustrate in a simple fashion 
the transitions proposed by Werner et al. (2014) based on 
their extensive taxon sampling and to highlight the com- 
plexities of the evoluation of this feature in the nitrogen- 
fixing clade. 
Because the bacterial symbionts involved (Rhizobiaceae 
vs. Frankia) are different, those taxa involving Rhizobia- 
ceae, Fabaceae, and Parasponia (Cannabacae) may rep- 
resent separate origins from those using the genus Fran- 
kia. Furthermore, Fabaceae and Parasponia are distantly 
related, implying a minimum of two separate origins of 
nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobiaceae. 
There is also evidence for multiple origins of nodulation 
involving Rhizobiaceae within just Fabaceae (J. J. Doyle 
1994; Sprent 1994; Doyle et al. 1997; Doyle and Luckow

2003; Sprent et al. 2013; Werner et al. 2014) (Fig. 10.14). 
Nodulation of legumes appears to have evolved 55-60 mya 
(Doyle 2011; Sprent et al. 2013). Most members of sub- 
families Mimosoideae (92% of those examined) and Papil- 
ionoideae (97% of the taxa investigated) nodulate. Those 
Papilionoideae that do not nodulate mostly represent early- 
branching lineages within the subfamily. Caesalpinioideae 
are paraphyletic to the remainder of the family, and few 
genera nodulate (approximately 5%), making it clear that 
nodulation arose only after the major lineages of Fabaceae 
had diverged (Doyle and Luckow 2003). Caesalpinioids 
confirmed as nodulating are either sister to mimosoids or 
belong to the more distantly related genus Chamaecrista. 
There may be at least three origins of nitrogen-fixing sym- 
biosis just in the legumes: (1) the papilionoids; (2) the clade 
consisting of some caesalpinioids (e.g., the Sclerolobium 
and Dimorphandra groups of the highly polyphyletic tribe 
Caesalpinieae) and Mimosoideae; and (3) Chamaecrista 
(Doyle et al. 1997; Doyle and Luckow 2003) (Fig. 10.14). 
Our simple analysis indicates several possible gains of ac- 
tinorhizal symbiosis (Fig. 10.17). Evolution of this symbiosis 
apparently occurred in: (1) Elaeagnaceae; (2) some Rhamna- 
ceae; (3) some Rosaceae; (4) some Betulaceae; (5) Casuari- 
naceae; (6) Myricaceae; (7) Coriaria; and (8) Datisca. How- 
ever, our studies actually indicate that the ancestral state for 
the subclade (within Fagales) of Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, 
and Myricaceae is ambiguous. If actinorhizal symbiosis is 
ancestral for this subclade, then two losses occurred, once 
in Ticodendron and again in Betulaceae. Alternatively, Ca- 
suarinaceae (Casuarina, Gymnostoma, and Allocasuarina), 
Alnus, and Myricaceae (Myrica and Comptonia) could rep- 
resent separate gains of actinorhizal symbiosis. 
Swensen (1996) argued that comparative morphological 
data provided additional evidence for multiple origins of 
this symbiotic relationship within the actinorhizal lineages. 
For example, only host plants in the Fagales clade (Betula- 
ceae, Casuarinaceae, and Myricaceae) are infected via root 
hairs (all others are infected by intercellular penetration) 
and possess nodules with a specialized oxygen diffusion— 
limiting cell layer; these same taxa also have higher levels 
of hemoglobin than hosts in other clades (reviewed in Sw- 
ensen 1996), which could be interpreted as evidence for 
a separate origin of actinorhizal nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. 
Alnus also differs from other members of this clade in sev- 
eral respects involving nodulation, making the number of 
transitions a complex subject. 
Coriaria (Coriariaceae) and Datisca (Datiscaceae; both 
Cucurbitales) share several anatomical nodule features. 
The infected cells are multinucleate, and the arrangement 
of vesicles within the cells is unique (reviewed in Swensen 
1996). Thus, although our reconstructions and those of 
others indicate two independent gains, one each in Coriaria 
Superrosids 
211 
and Datisca, an alternative explanation that may better ex- 
plain the shared morphology is one gain, followed by two 
losses (one in Corynocarpus and another in the clade of 
Begonia, Hillebrandia, Octomeles, and Tetrameles). 
WIND POLLINATION AND FRUIT TYPE 
Wind pollination (anemophily) occurs in ~18% of flow- 
ering plant families and has evolved many times (Linder 
1998; Ackerman 2000; Culley et al. 2002), most likely in 
response to pollinator limitation and environmental varia- 
tion. Wind pollination could be facilitated by movement of 
individuals into a geographic area with a distinct dry season 
in which conditions are unfavorable for insect pollination 
(Whitehead 1969, 1983; Weller et al. 1998; Culley et al. 
2002). A phylogenetic analysis focused on the nitrogen- 
fixing clade indicated that wind pollination is more likely 
to evolve in those groups that have small, simple flowers 
and dry pollen (Culley et al. 2002). Fagaceae illustrate well 
this evolutionary tendency. Fagaceae are characterized by 
small flowers (see below), and ancestral members were 
apparently insect-pollinated. Molecular analyses indicate 
multiple derivations of wind pollination within this single 
family (see Fagales, below). 
Similarly, whereas a cupule (derived from a modified in- 
florescence branch system) associated with one to several 
nuts evolved only once, and is in fact a synapomorphy of 
the entire Fagaceae, analyses by Oh and Manos (2008) in- 
dicate that the scaly cupule that encloses just a single fruit 
(acorn) evolved multiple times in the family (see below). 
EFABALES 
Fabales comprise Fabaceae, Polygalaceae, Quillajaceae, and 
Surianaceae (Fig. 10.12). The DNA-based composition of 
Fabales is significant in that the closest relatives of Fabaceae 
have long been debated and were extremely important to 
identify given the great economic importance of Fabaceae 
(see J. J. Doyle 1994; Doyle and Luckow 2003). Non-DNA 
synapomorphies for Fabales are not clear, but may include 
clawed petals and more or less distinct carpels. Fabales rep- 
resent another unexpected result of molecular phylogenetic 
analyses—the four constituent families (Fabaceae, Suriana- 
ceae, Polygalaceae, and Quillajaceae) have not been placed 
together in any morphology-based classifications. 
Cronquist (1981, 1988) and Takhtajan (1997) both 
considered Fabaceae to be close to Connaraceae (see also 
Dickison 1981), the latter sister to Oxalidaceae (Oxalida- 
les; discussed below). Polygalaceae have also been vari- 
ously placed in morphology-based classifications because 
of their unusual, bilaterally symmetric flowers (Fig. 10.15).

Fabaceae were often associated with Malpighiaceae and 
Krameriaceae, two other families exhibiting bilateral floral 
symmetry (Cronquist 1981). Takhtajan (1997) considered 
Polygalaceae to be closely related to Xanthophyllaceae, Vo- 
chysiaceae, and Emblingiaceae, but only the first of these 
families is now known to be closely related to Polygalaceae, 
in which it has been included (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; 
APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12). 
Quillaja had typically been placed in Rosaceae with 
Kageneckia, sometimes as a separate subfamily (Takhtajan 
1987, 1997; Thorne 1992a,b) on the basis of several shared 
features including follicular fruits with numerous pleuro- 
tropic ovules that mature into winged seeds. Other features, 
however, distinguish Quillaja from Rosaceae, such as its 
base chromosome number of x = 14, which is not found in 
Rosaceae. Furthermore, cytological studies indicated that 
x = 14 in Quillaja does not represent a tetraploid derivative 
of x = 7,a common number in Rosaceae (Goldblatt 1976). 
Bate-Smith (1965) noted chemical characters of Ouillaja 
that are discordant with Rosaceae, including the presence 
of saponins and trihydroxy-substituted flavonoids. 
The placement within Fabales of Surianaceae, a small, 
enigmatic family of five genera from Australia and Mexico, 
was also unexpected. The family had often been placed 
with Simaroubaceae and Rutaceae in Sapindales (Takhta- 
jan 1997); Cronquist (1981) placed it in Rosales. 
Soltis et al. (2011) recovered Quillajaceae + Polygala- 
ceae as sister to Surianaceae + Fabaceae, but BS support 
was low. Qiu et al. (2010) found weak support for Quil- 
lajaceae sister to Fabaceae + (Surianaceae + Polygala- 
ceae). Use of a 12-gene dataset recovered Quillajaceae, 
Surianaceae, and Polygalaceae as subsequent sisters to 
Fabaceae (H. Wang et al. 2009) (Fig. 10.12), but again 
with weak support. Bello et al. (2012) found weak sup- 
port for Fabaceae and Polygalaceae as successive sisters 
to Surianaceae + Quillajaceae. Hence, relationships within 
Fabales still require attention (representatives are shown 
in Fig. 10.15). 
Fabaceae have been the focus of many phylogenetic 
analyses (see Doyle et al. 2000; Bruneau et al. 2008; Lavin 
et al. 2004, 2005; Wojciechowski et al. 2004; Cardoso 
et al. 2012b, 2013a,b; Legume Phylogeny Working Group 
2013a,b). 
Both Mimosoideae 
and Papilionoideae 
are 
monophyletic; Caesalpinioideae are paraphyletic to these 
(see Doyle et al. 1997; Doyle and Luckow 2003; Legume 
Phylogeny Working Group 2013a,b). Progress has been 
made in clarifying relationships across Fabaceae and also 
within subclades (see Stevens 2012; Angiosperm Phyogeny 
Website). Nonetheless, considering that Fabaceae are the 
third largest angiosperm family (~19,500 species), relation- 
ships within the family may not be as clearly understood as 
Superrosids 
213 
are those of the two largest angiosperm families, Orchida- 
ceae and Asteraceae. 
There are no confirmed Cretaceous records of Fabales, 
but the legumes are confirmed from pods and leaflets in 
the Paleocene of Colombia and the UK (Wing et al. 2009) 
and were abundant and widespread by the Eocene (Lavin 
et al. 2005). 
Several complete nuclear genomes have been sequenced 
in Fabaceae (e.g., soybean, Glycine max; barrel medic, 
Medicago truncatula, and birdsfoot trefoil, Lotus japoni- 
cas; pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan; chickpea, Cicer arietinum; 
common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris; Cannon et al. 2009; 
Varshney et al. 2012, 2013), with more on the way, provid- 
ing excellent genomic resources for systematic/evolution- 
ary analyses. 
ROSALES 
Rosales are strongly supported and consist of (Fig. 10.12) 
Barbeyaceae, Cannabaceae (including Celtidaceae), Dirach- 
maceae, Elaeagnaceae, Moraceae, Rhamnaceae, Rosaceae, 
Ulmaceae, and Urticaceae (including Cecropiaceae). Ro- 
sales are one of several examples of an order consisting of 
families of the former subclasses Hamamelidae (e.g., Ulma- 
ceae, Urticaceae, Moraceae) and Rosidae (e.g., Rosaceae, 
Rhamnaceae, and Elaeagnaceae; some members are shown 
in Fig. 10.15). Judd et al. (2002, 2008) suggested that a re- 
duction (or lack) of endosperm and a variously shaped hy- 
panthium (a character lost in some wind-pollinated mem- 
bers, however) may be synapomorphies; other potential 
synapomorphies include valvate sepals and + clawed petals. 
Craspedodromous leaf venation and anthraquinones are 
also potential uniting features. As with other rosid clades, 
critical analyses are needed to evaluate these and other po- 
tential synapomorphies. 
Within Rosales relationships are now generally clear 
(Fig. 10.12) (Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 
2011; Sytsma et al. 2002; H. Wang et al. 2009; S. Zhang 
et al. 2011). Rosaceae are sister to the remainder of the 
order, which comprises several subgroups: 1) Barbeya- 
ceae sister to Rhamnaceae + Elaeagnaceae + Dirachma- 
ceae (see Thulin et al. 1998); and 2) Ulmaceae and Can- 
nabaceae as subsequent sisters to Moraceae + Urticaceae 
(e.g., Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; 
H. Wang et al. 2009). 
Celtidaceae have been subsumed within Cannabaceae 
(APG Il 2009; APG IV 2016), a result supported by ultra- 
structure and chromosome number (Sytsma et al. 2002). 
Additional DNA evidence for the recognition of Canna- 
baceae and Ulmaceae as distinct families was provided by 

214 Chapter 10 
Wiegrefe et al. (1998); morphological data supporting this 
distinction were presented by Grudzinskaja (1967). The 
monophyly of Rhamnaceae and relationships within the 
family were discussed by Richardson et al. (2000). 
Studies have clarified relationships within Rosaceae, 
drastically revising previous views (e.g., Morgan et al. 
1994; Lee and Wen 2001; Potter et al. 2002, 2007). Four 
subfamilies were traditionally recognized with fruit type 
the major character used in distinguishing these. Amygda- 
loideae (Prunoideae) possessed drupes (e.g., Prunus), and 
Maloideae pomes (e.g., Malus), whereas Rosoideae have 
achenes or druplets (e.g., Fragaria and Rubus) and Spirae- 
oideae (e.g., Spiraea) follicles or capsules. 
DNA results prompted a dramatic redefining of subfam- 
ilies. Campbell et al. (2007) recognized three subfamilies. 
Rosoideae are more narrowly defined (and characterized 
by numerous free carpels); a new subfamily, Dryadoideae, 
is recognized (which contains all four genera that have 
nitrogen-fixing symbiosis); and Amygdaloideae (Spiraeoi- 
deae of some recent publications) are expanded to include 
both Maloideae and Amygdaloideae (see Campbell et al. 
2007). The clades recovered in molecular analyses do not 
agree with either fruit type or chromosome number (see 
below). We also stress the features with which the sub- 
clades (subfamilies) detected within Rosaceae do agree. 
Amygdaloideae are diagnosed by the presence of sorbitol 
in significant amounts (vs. absent or only in trace amounts 
in the other two subfamilies), and also many have a base 
chromosome number of 17 vs. 9 in Dryadoideae and 7 in 
Rosoideae (see below). 
Ouillaja, 
a genus placed in Rosaceae in most mor- 
phology-based classifications, is a member of Fabales (dis- 
cussed above). Chrysobalanaceae (now in Malpighiales) 
had often been included in Rosaceae in the past. They are 
superficially similar to Rosaceae, in having a hypanthium, 
alternate stipulate leaves, 5-merous flowers with showy 
petals and numerous stamens, but the style is gynobasic, 
the gynoecium is pseudomonomerous, and they lack cya- 
nogenic compounds. 
Multiple Rosaceae crops, including strawberry, Fragaria 
vesca (Shulaev et al. 2011), peach, Prunus persica (Inter- 
national Peach Genome Initiative 2013) as well as other 
species of Prunus, and apple, Malus domestica (Velasco 
et al. 2010), have been the focus of complete nuclear ge- 
nome sequencing, providing excellent genomic resources 
for systematic/evolutionary analyses. Using these resources, 
researchers are using gene capture methods to isolate and 
sequence numerous nuclear genes (Cronn et al. 2012). 
Ulmaceae are recognizable from dispersed pollen and 
leaves in the Paleocene, and crown group representatives 
(synapomorphies include the following: fruit a pseudo- 
monomerous samara or nutlet, with a flat seed; the leaf 
having pinnate venation with the secondary veins extending 
into marginal teeth and terminating medially or submedi- 
ally to the tooth apecies; and pollen is 4- to 6-porate) allow 
recognition of Ulmus by the early Eocene (see Fig. 10.5 for 
fossil Ulmus). Rosaceae are confirmed by anatomically pre- 
served fruits of Prunus in the Eocene (Cevallos-Ferriz and 
Stockey 1991; Manchester 1994b), by foliage of several 
modern genera in the Eocene (DeVore and Pigg 2007), and 
by fruits and foliage of Rosa in the early Oligocene (Meyer 
and Manchester 1997). Cannabaceae are confirmed in the 
Paleocene by endocarps and leaves of Celtis (Manchester 
et al. 2002). Rhamnaceae are recognizable by their distinc- 
tive flowers with petal-opposed stamens by the Eocene 
(Millan and Crepet 2014) and by fruits of Paliurus (Burge 
and Manchester 2008) and Berchemia (Collinson et al. 
2012) (Supplementary Table 10.1). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN ROSALES 
Using the new assessments of relationships for Rosaceae, 
new insights have been obtained into the evolution of fruit 
types and chromosome number (Fig. 10.16). Rosaceae rep- 
resent one of several examples in which base chromosome 
number agrees well with clades recovered in phylogenetic 
analyses, indicating that base chromosome number may be 
~ 
a good predictor of relationships in many groups. Other 
examples include Crassulaceae (Mort et al. 2001), Ru- 
taceae (Chase et al. 1999), and Onagraceae (Sytsma and 
Smith 1988; Levin et al. 2003). 
Our reconstructions indicate that x = 7 is ancestral for 
Rosaceae (Fig. 10.16a). Rosoideae consist primarily of taxa 
with x = 7 and some with changes to x = 8 (e.g., Alchemi- 
Ila). The remaining Rosaceae (Dryadoideae + Amygdaloi- 
deae) have x = 9 as the ancestral state. Within the large 
Amygdaloideae there have been multiple derivations of 
x = 8 (Prunus; a clade of Prinsepia, Oemleria, and Exo- 
chorda). One subclade within Amygdaloideae evolved high 
base chromosome numbers (x = 15, 17), the former Maloi- 
deae (e.g., Pyrus, Malus, and their close relatives), discussed 
below, now treated as subtribe Malinae (some have called 
this subtribe Pyrinae; Potter et al. 2007). 
Our reconstructions of fruit type are similar to those 
of Potter et al. (2007), although we use fewer character 
states (Fig. 10.16b). The ancestral fruit type for Rosaceae 
is reconstructed as equivocal. However, Rosoideae as now 
defined and Purshiodeae both have achenes (or aggregates 
of achenes) and the achene appears to be ancestral for 
these clades. It is unclear if this represents a single or two 
separate origins. The achene also appears to have evolved 
independently in some Amygdaloideae (e.g., Adenostoma,

for Amygdaloideae as now defined is also uncertain; the

this large clade (Fig. 10.16b).

Ancestral state reconstruction (with both maximum

(A) chromosome number and (B) fruit type in Rosaceae. Updated and 
modified from Soltis et al. (2005). (C). Proposed evolution of the pome

ily Maloideae had traditonally been defined by fruit type 
(a fleshy fruit, the pome; e.g., apple or pear). Sequence 
analyses indicated a well-defined core maloid group, all in 
Malineae (e.g., represented here by Amelanchier, Cratae- 
gus, Eriobotrya, Photinia, and Sorbus) and also placed sev- 
eral traditionally problematic genera (Vauquelinia, Lind- 
leya, and Kageneckia) with capsules and follicles as sister 

216 Chapter 10 
to these core maloids—together these comprise a clade, the 
tribe Maleae. Interestingly, these three genera possess high 
chromosome numbers (x = 15, 17) that agree with those 
in the traditionally recognized Maloideae (x = 17); these 
high numbers are the result of an ancient polyploid event 
that occurred in the ancestor of the maloid clade (e.g., Steb- 
bins 1976b; Evans and Campbell 2002). These results also 
indicated that the distinctive pome fruit was likely derived 
from dry follicular or capsular fruits (Fig. 10.16c). More 
clues to the origin of the apple are provided by Harris et al. 
(2002). 
CUCURBITALES 
Cucurbitales consist of (APG III 2009) Anisophylleaceae, 
Begoniaceae, Coriariaceae, Corynocarpaceae, Cucurbita- 
ceae, Datiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae (Fig. 10.12). To this 
APG IV (2016) has added the holoparasitic Apodanthaceae 
(see below). Attesting to the morphological complexity of 
the rosids, these families represent three subclasses in some 
traditional classifications. Cucurbitaceae, Begoniaceae, Tet- 
ramelaceae, and Datiscaceae were placed in Dilleniidae; 
Coriariaceae and Corynocarpaceae were variously placed 
within Rosidae or Magnoliidae; Apodanthaceae (as part 
of Rafflesiaceae) and Anisophylleaceae were often placed 
in Rosidae (Cronquist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1997; 
some members are shown in Fig. 10.17). 
A close relationship of Cucurbitaceae, Begoniaceae, 
Tetramelaceae, and Datiscaceae had long been recognized 
(e.g., Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997). However, Takhta- 
jan (1997) considered Cucurbitaceae to be more closely re- 
lated to Passifloraceae and Achariaceae (now in Malpighia- 
les) than to Begoniaceae, Tetramelaceae, or Datiscaceae. 
Corynocarpaceae, Coriariaceae, and Anisophylleaceae are 
all small, problematic families for which affinities were 
long considered uncertain, and a diverse array of place- 
ments had been proposed (e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; 
Takhtajan 1987, 1997; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001). 
An enigmatic parasitic family that appears in Cucur- 
bitales in recent DNA studies is Apodanthaceae (APG IV 
2016). DNA analyses now support this placement although 
the position within the order remains unclear (Nickrent 
et al. 2004; Barkman et al. 2007; Filipowicz and Renner 
2010; Schaefer and Renner 2011). We have tentatively 
placed the family sister to the rest of Cucurbitales (Schaefer 
and Renner 2011) (Fig. 10.12). 
Non-DNA synapomorphies for Cucurbitales are un- 
clear, although possibly include wood with broad multi- 
seriate rays or stems with separate vascular bundles, and 
leaves with more or less palmate venation. Cucurbitaceae, 
Begoniaceae, Tetramelaceae, and Datiscaceae share some 
distinctive features, including an inferior ovary, imperfect 
flowers, strongly protruding placentae, a distinctive cucur- 
bitoid tooth, and the presence of curcurbitacins (Nandi 
et al. 1998; Judd et al. 2008). Comparisons of floral struc- 
ture (Matthews and Endress 2004) indicate a close rela- 
tionship between Coriariaceae and Corynocarpaceae, as 
well as between Tetramelaceae and Datiscaceae; these same 
comparisons also support a relationship of Tetramelaceae 
and Datiscaceae to Begoniaceae. 
Although the clade is well-supported, most interfamilial 
relationships within Cucurbitales are not (see also Swensen 
et al. 1994, 1998; Soltis et al. 2011; H. Wang et al. 2009; 
Filipowicz and Renner 2010; Schaefer and Renner 2011). 
After Apodanthaceae, Anisophylleaceae followed by Co- 
riariaceae + Corynocarpaceae are sisters to the rest of the 
order; the remainder form a clade in which Cucurbitaceae, 
then Tetramelaceae are sister to a well-supported Datisca- 
ceae + Begoniaceae (Fig. 10.12). 
The well-supported sister-group relationship of Coriari- 
aceae and Corynocarpaceae is noteworthy in that the re- 
lationships of both families have long been uncertain. Co- 
rynocarpaceae, a family of one genus and perhaps seven 
species, have been placed in diverse orders, including Ra- 
nunculales, Sapindales, and Celastrales (Cronquist 1981, 
1988; Takhtajan 1997). Coriariaceae are also monogene- 
ric, comprising five species; the placement of the family 
has been extremely controversial (Sharma 1968; Takhtajan 
° 
1997). Whereas some authors proposed relationships with 
Sapindales (Takhtajan 1997), Cronquist (1981) placed the 
family in Ranunculales. Coriariaceae and Corynocarpaceae 
share several features: fibers with simple pits, vasicentric 
axial parenchyma, small flowers with + separate carpels, 
scanty or no endosperm, and bitter chemical compounds 
(identified as sesquiterpenoids in Coriaria). 
Schwarzbach and Ricklefs (2000) first showed that Ani- 
sophylleaceae, an enigmatic tropical family of four genera, 
were part of Cucurbitales. The family appears as sister to 
the rest of Cucurbitales (after Apodanthaceae) in analyses 
of multiple genes (Filipowicz and Renner 2010; Soltis et al. 
2011; Schaefer and Renner 2011). Anisophylleaceae have 
often been considered either closely related to, or part of, 
Rhizophoraceae (Schwarzbach and Ricklefs 2000; see also 
“Malpighiales,” below). However, molecular data indi- 
cated that Anisophylleaceae are distantly related to Rhi- 
zophoraceae. Matthews et al. (2001) and Schonenberger 
et al. (2001a) showed striking similarities in floral structure 
of Anisophylleaceae with the distantly related Cunoniaceae 
(Oxalidales) and a Cretaceous fossil exhibiting features of 
both families. 
Schaefer et al. (2009) proposed an Asian origin of Cu- 
curbitaceae followed by numerous subsequent, oversea 
dispersal events. Recent studies have clarified relationships

at multiple levels within the family and provided insights 
into character evolution and evolutionary processes—for 
example, long-distance dispersal has played a major role at 
multiple levels within the family (e.g., Renner et al. 2002, 
2007; Kocyan et al. 2007; Schaefer and Renner 2008, 
2010, 2011a,b; Schaefer et al. 2008a,b, 2009; Duchen 
and Renner 2010). The family is also of interest in that 
the mitochondrial genomes of some members are large and 
variable (Cucumis; 379,000-2,900,000 bp; Alverson et al. 
2010). 
FAGALES 
Fagales consist of seven woody families formerly considered 
part of subclass Hamamelidae (Fig. 10.12): Betulaceae, Ca- 
suarinaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae (Rhoipteleaceae now 
included within Juglandaceae as in APG III [2009] and IV 
[2016]), Myricaceae, Nothofagaceae, and Ticodendraceae 
(Ticodendron, Ticodendraceae were described by GOmez- 
Laurito and Gémez 1989). Rhoipteleaceae were bracketed 
in APG II (2003) and included in Juglandaceae in APG III 
(2009), but in recent treatments they have been retained as 
distinct (APG IV 2016; several families are illustrated in 
Fig. 10.17). Molecular as well as nonmolecular analyses 
have demonstrated, however, that Fagales are rosids and 
not closely related to other former Hamamelidae such as 
Platanaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, and Daphniphyllaceae (see 
also Hufford 1992; Nandi et al. 1998). 
Members of Fagales share ectomycorrhizal roots, an 
indumentum of gland-headed and/or stellate hairs, an in- 
ferior ovary (except Rhoipteleaceae), one or two ovules 
per locule, unisexual flowers with tepals reduced or ab- 
sent, nectaries lacking, delayed ovule development and a 
pollen tube that enters the immature ovule via the chalaza 
(chalazogamy), and indehiscent fruits with only one seed 
(by abortion of additional ovules; Hufford 1992; Loconte 
1996; Manos and Steele 1997; Judd et al. 1999, 2008; Sogo 
and Tobe 2008; Endress 2011a). 
Relationships witin Fagales are now well resolved (Fig. 
10.12). Nothofagaceae, followed by Fagaceae, are succes- 
sive sisters to the remainder of the clade. The rest of Fagales 
consists of two subclades: (1) Myricaceae + (Rhoipteleaceae 
+ Juglandaceae); and (2) Casuarinaceae + (Ticodendraceae 
+ Betulaceae). The distribution of the three types of pollen 
in the order (colporate, porate, stephanoporate) is in gen- 
eral agreement with these four clades of families (Manos 
and Steele 1997). 
The position of Myricaceae has varied; in some analyses 
the family has appeared with Casuarinaceae, Ticodendra- 
ceae, and Betulaceae (Manos and Steele 1997; Liet al. 2004; 
Herbert et al. 2006; H. Wang et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Sauquet et al. 2012). However, Myricaceae share morpho- 
logical features with Rhoipteleaceae and Juglandaceae, in- 
cluding aromatic glandular hairs and a gynoecium with a 
single, orthotropous ovule. The sister-group relationship of 
Ticodendraceae and Betulaceae (Fig. 10.12; see also Conti 
et al. 1996) is also supported by similarities in floral mor- 
phology (Tobe 1991), wood and bark anatomy (Carlquist 
1991), sieve element plastids (Behnke 1991), pollen (Feuer 
1991), and leaf architecture (Hickey and Taylor 1991). 
Molecular data also provided strong support for Jug- 
landaceae + Rhoipteleaceae (Fig. 10.12; Manos and Steele 
1997; Chen et al. 1998; Li et al. 2004). Rhoipteleaceae are 
an enigmatic monogeneric family that could be included in 
Juglandaceae (APG II 2009), with several features that are 
unusual in Fagales (e.g., perfect flowers, a superior ovary). 
However, Juglandaceae (including Rhoipteleaceae) are dis- 
tinctive in Fagales in possessing compound leaves; a close 
relationship is also suggested by stem anatomy, floral mor- 
phology (Manning 1938, 1940; Withner 1941), and chro- 
mosomal data (Oginuma et al. 1995). Rhoipteleaceae are 
included in Juglandaceae in APG IV (2016). 
Fagales are well represented in the fossil record (e.g., 
Jones 1986; Crepet and Nixon 1989; Herendeen et al. 
1995) (Supplementary Table 10.1), and the position of 
Nothofagaceae as sister to the remainder of the order is 
in agreement with the relatively early appearance of this 
family in the fossil record (see Manos and Steele 1997 and 
~ 
Knapp et al. 2005 for phylogenetic relationships and bio- 
geographic patterns within Nothofagus). Extinct fagalean 
taxa 
likely ancestral 
to Juglandaceae, Betulaceae, and 
Fagaceae are represented by several genera of charcoal- 
ified flowers and fruits from the late Cretaceous of Europe 
and North America (Sims et al. 1998; Schonenberger et al. 
2001b; Friis et al. 2003b) (see Fig. 10.5 for fossils of Betu- 
laceae and Juglandaceae). Crown group representatives 
of Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Myricaceae, Casuarinaceae, and 
Juglandaceae are well represented in the fossil record by 
the late Paleocene and early Eocene. These include species 
representing extinct genera (e.g., Polyptera and Cruciptera 
of the Juglandaceae; Cranea and Palaeocarpinus of Betu- 
laceae) along with those corresponding to modern genera 
(e.g., Juglans, Cyclocarya, Alnus, Betula, Gymnostoma, 
Comptonia, Castanea, Fagus, Quercus). 
The Hardwood Genomics Project (hardwoodgenomics 
.org) provides useful genomic resources for a number of 
Fagaceae (e.g., Castanea, Fagus, Quercus). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN FAGALES

namic picture of diversification (Manos and Stone 2001).

Ancestral state reconstruction showing evolution of fruit types in Juglandaceae using living and fossil members of the family; the placement of the

1997). (Top) Twig with infructescence. (Bottom right) Staminate catkins. Updated from Soltis et al. (2005). 
the family, four independent origins of wings from a com- 
bination of floral and accessory structures are suggested 
(Fig. 10.18): (1) Engelhardia and Oreomunnea have wings 
formed from a tri-lobed bract; (2) Platycarya has two small 
wings that result from the fusion of bracteoles and lateral 
sepals; (3) Platycarya has wings derived from bracteoles; 
and (4) Cyclocarya has a distinctive circular wing that is 
the result of fusion of bracts and bracteoles. Our recon- 
struction indicated that animal dispersal evolved indepen- 
dently three times, resulting in nuts formed uniquely by 
the fusion of different organs: (1) fusion of four sepals in 
Alfaroa; (2) fusion of bract, bracteoles, and sepals in Jug- 
lans; and (3) fusion of the bract and bracteoles in Carya 
and Annamocarya. In general, wind-dispersed seeds have 
epigeal germination, and those that are animal-dispersed 
are hypogeal. Oreomunnea and Cyclocarya are exceptions 
in their respective clades in having wind-dispersed seeds 
with hypogeal germination. 
Juglandaceae have been well-investigated using DNA 
data (Manos and Stone 2001; Sauquet et al. 2012) and 
have an excellent fossil record, and these fossils have been 
carefully investigated (e.g., Manchester and Dilcher 1997). 
Hence, the family affords the opportunity to integrate fos- 
sils into the excellent phylogenetic framework for extant 
taxa. Manos et al. (2007) found that despite large and vari- 
able amounts of missing data for the fossils, most methods 
provided reasonable placement of both fossils and simu- 
lated “artificial fossils” in the phylogenetic tree previously 
inferred only from extant taxa. Their results show that the 
amount of missing data in any given taxon is not by itself 
an operational guideline for excluding fossils from analysis. 
In fact, three fossil taxa (Cruciptera simsonii, Paleoplaty- 
carya wingii, and Platycarya americana) were placed within 
crown clades containing living taxa for which relation- 
ships previously had been suggested based on morphology, 
whereas Polyptera manningii, a mosaic taxon of equivocal 
affinities, was placed firmly as sister to two modern crown 
clades (Fig. 10.18). 
Fagaceae (~1000 species), the largest family within Fa- 
gales, have also been the focus of phylogenetic analyses 

220 Chapter 10 
(Manos and Steele 
1997; Manos and Stanford 2001; Manos 
et al. 2001; Oh and Manos 2008). Assuming that ancestral 
Fagaceae were insect-pollinated, as indicated by the fossil 
record (Herendeen et al. 1995; Sims et al. 1998), then the 
DNA-based reconstructions support at least three origins 
of wind pollination in the family. There was also at least 
one reversion to insect pollination (Juglandaceae: Platy- 
carya; Endress 1986c; Fukuhara and Tokumaru 2014). 
COM CLADE 
The COM clade (Celastrales, Oxalidales, and Malpighia- 
les) (Figs. 10.1, 10.2; representatives are shown in Figs. 
10.13, 10.20, and 10.21) was recovered using three genes 
(D. Soltis et al. 2000) but with low support. The clade ul- 
timately received strong support in large multi-gene stud- 
ies (H. Wang et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011). Morphologi- 
cal characters also united the three orders and indicated a 
placement closer to malvids than fabids (Endress and Mat- 
thews 2006; Endress et al. 2013). 
The COM clade contains approximately one-third of all 
Rosidae, 870 genera and ~19,000 species (APG III 2009; 
APG IV 2016); their placement is one of the most problem- 
atic deep-level issues remaining in the angiosperms. Plastid 
genes indicated a placement in Fabidae whereas mitochon- 
drial and nuclear genes suggested placement of the COM 
clade with Malvidae (Zhu et al. 2007; Duarte et al. 2010; 
Finet et al. 2010; Qiu et al. 2010; Burleigh et al. 2011; 
Lee et al. 2011; Morton 2011; Shulaev et al. 2011; Zhang 
et al. 2012). Morphologically, several floral characters also 
linked the COM clade with Malvidae. COM species and 
Malvidae share a type of ovule with a thicker inner integu- 
ment than the outer one, which is otherwise nearly absent 
in Fabidae and rare in eudicots. Contorted petals and a ten-

dency towards polystemony and polycarpy also suggest a 
placement of COM members with Malvidae (Endress and 
Matthews 2006; Endress et al. 2013). 
To unravel the evolutionary history of the COM clade 
Sun et al. (2014) assembled taxonomically comparable ma- 
trices representing each plant genome; they used extensive 
tests and analyses (e.g.; RY coding, and rapidly evolving 
sites removed) to explore the underlying causes of incongru- 
ence. They found that the two conflicting topologies inferred 
from the three genomes are accurate; the disagreement is not 
due to systematic biases or sampling errors, but represents 
some form of biological incongruence. Their analyses also 
reveal that two conflicting phylogenetic signals exist in both 
single-copy and multi-copy nuclear genes and the pattern of 
gene duplications in multi-copy gene trees also strongly sup- 
ports placement of the COM clade with Malvidae. 
The analyses of Sun et al. (2015) suggested a complex 
evolutionary history in which either ancient lineage sorting, 
or more likely reticulation/introgressive hybridization and 
subsequent chloroplast capture occurred during the early 
and rapid radiation of Rosidae. This ancient event resulted 
in conflict between plastid and mitochondrial gene trees, 
as well as a mixture of underlying signal in the nuclear ge- 
nome representing both Malvidae and Fabidae. Sun et al. 
(2015) provided one hypothetical ancient hybridization 
scenario for the origin of COM from the ancestral Fabidae 
and Malvidae lineages (Fig. 10.19). Although lineage sort- 
ing and reticulation have been long recognized as impor- 
tant (and complex) evolutionary forces at shallow phyloge- 
netic levels, these results reveal their impact at deep levels 
in the angiosperms. These results also suggest that perhaps 
the COM clade be placed with both the Fabidae and Malvi- 
dae in classifications—although we continue to follow the 
APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016) treatment here.

Hypothetical reticulation scenario for the origin of COM from the ancestral Fabidae and Malvidae lineages. Large circles reflect the plant lineages; 
the small circles represent their nuclear DNA types (the red circle represents the Fabidae nuclear DNA and the blue one the Malvidae nuclear DNA), the ovals repre- 
sent the chloroplast (the green ovals represent the Fabidae plastid, and the gray oval represents the chloroplast from the Malvidae ancestor), and the diamonds rep- 
resent the mitochondria (the gray diamond represents the Fabidae mitochondrion and the orange diamond the Malvidae mitochondrion); dashed arrows represent 
multiple generations of backcrossing. During hybridization, the mitochondrion is maternally inherited from the Malvidae ancestor, and the chloroplast is paternally 
inherited from the Fabidae ancestor. After subsequent F, backcrosses to the Malvidae, the resulting generations contain chloroplasts from Fabidae, mitochondria 
from Malvidae, and a majority of the nuclear genes from Malvidae, with a smaller number from Fabidae (roughly 25%). The reticulate phylogeny at the bottom 
illustrates this hypothetical introgressive hybridization scenario and shows the phylogenetic incongruence among the three genomes with respect to COM.

MALPIGHIALES 
Malpighiales are one of the largest angiosperm orders, 
comprising ~16,000 species (~7.8% of eudicots); they are 
extremely diverse morphologically. Molecular phylogenetic 
analyses provided strong support for a Malpighiales clade 
of 29 families not recognized in any morphology-based 
classification 
(Fig. 
10.12): 
Achariaceae, 
Balanopaceae, 
Bonnetiaceae, Calophyllaceae, Caryocaraceae, Centropla- 
caceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Clusiaceae, Ctenolophonaceae, 
Dichapetalaceae, Elatinaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Euphronia- 
ceae, Humiriaceae, Hypericaceae, Irvingiaceae, Ixonantha- 
ceae, Lacistemataceae, Linaceae (including Hugoniaceae), 
Lophopyxidaceae, Malpighiaceae, Ochnaceae (including 
Medusagynaceae, Quiinaceae), Pandaceae, Passifloraceae 
(expanded to include Malesherbiaceae, Medusandraceae, 
and Turneraceae; see below), Picrodendraceae, Podostema- 
ceae (including Tristichaceae), Peraceae (recognized here 
but whether the family should be segregated depends on 
the position of Rafflesiaceae, see below), Putranjivaceae, 
Rafflesiaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Erythroxylaceae, and an 
expanded Salicaceae (nomenclaturally, Salicaceae includes 
the type Flacourtia, so technically Flacourtiaceae is now 
a synonym of Salicaceae) and Scyphostegiaceae, Trigo- 
niaceae, and Violaceae (see Chapter 12; several families 
are illustrated in Fig. 10.20 with several fossils shown in 
Fie 10221): 
Because the order is so heterogeneous, non-DNA char- 
acters uniting the taxa remain poorly understood, although 
when the leaves have teeth, each tooth usually has a distally 
expanded vein, with the tooth-apex thus congested (Judd 
et al. 2008). Many families of the order were previously 
placed in Violales (subclass Dilleniidae of Cronquist 1981): 
Flacourtiaceae, Lacistemataceae, Passifloraceae, Malesher- 
biaceae and Turneraceae (both now included in Passiflora- 
ceae; APG III 2009), and Violaceae. Ochnaceae represent 
another family formerly placed in Dillenitdae in recent clas- 
sifications (Dilleniales). Malpighiales also include families 
previously attributed to a diverse array of orders in the tra- 
ditionally recognized Rosidae, such as Linales (Humiria- 
ceae, Linaceae, and Erythroxylaceae), Polygalales (Malpi- 
ghiaceae, Trigoniaceae, and Euphroniaceae), Euphorbiales 
(Euphorbiaceae), and Rosales (Chrysobalanaceae). 
The fossil record of Malphigiales includes well-preserved 
examples of Salicaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Humiriaceae, and 
Malphighiaceae. Most of these are first seen in the Eocene, 
but the extinct flower, Paleoclusia, mentioned earlier, is 
known from the Turonian, and distinctive polycolpate pol- 
len of Ctenolophonaceae occurs in the Campanian of Africa 
(van der Ham 1989). Eocene representatives of Salicaceae 
include the modern genus Populus (Fig. 10.21b), and the 
extinct genus, Pseudosalix (Fig. 10.21a). Pseudosalix had 
Superrosids 
223 
leaves resembling Salix, and capsular fruits with comose 
seeds like those of Populus and Salix, but was distinguished 
from the modern genera by having branched rather than rac- 
emose inflorescence and well-developed perianth (Boucher 
et al. 2003; Manchester et al. 2006b). The distinctive explo- 
sively dehiscent trilocular fruits of Euphorbiaceae are first 
known from the Early and Middle Eocene (Fig. 10.21c; 
Collinson et al. 2012), but may have actually originated 
earlier indicated by the occurrence of fruits conforming to 
Phyllanthaceae in the late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian of In- 
dia, Fig. 10.21d). Malpighiaceae are first known based on 
flowers from the middle Eocene (Taylor and Crepet 1987), 
and distinctive fruits and wood of Humiriaceae are traced 
to the late Eocene (Herrera et al. 2014). 
Monophyly of Malpighiales first received strong support 
(99%) in early DNA analyses (D. Soltis et al. 2000), but 
the topology at that time within the clade was essentially 
a polytomy. Ten years ago Malpighiales were one of the 
clades of angiosperms most in need of extensive study, but 
the use of broad sampling and numerous genes has greatly 
resolved relationships and provided novel evolutionary in- 
sights (e.g., C. Davis et al. 2002, 2004, 2005b, 2007; Wur- 
dack and Davis 2009; Davis and Anderson 2010; Xi et al. 
2012b). Malpighiales represent an excellent example of a 
rapid radiation (Wikstrom et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2005b; 
H. Wang et al. 2009; Bell et al. 2010). Davis et al. (2005b) 
suggested 114-101 mya for the explosive radiation of this 
clade of ~16,000 species. Xi et al. (2012b) discussed the 
rapid rise of the clade and provided evidence for multiple 
bursts in diversification, as well as several slowdowns. 
Malpighiales also illustrate the value of broad phyloge- 
netic analyses in placing enigmatic taxa. These include Ba- 
lanopaceae, Bonnetiaceae, Ctenolophonaceae, and Caryo- 
Goupiaceae, 
Irvingiaceae, 
Lophopyxidaceae, 
Pandaceae, Podostemaceae, Rafflesiaceae (Xi et al. 2012b). 
To give one example, the relationship of Medusagyne op- 
positifolia (formerly the sole species of Medusagynaceae) 
was unclear, but molecular studies not only placed the spe- 
cies firmly within Malpighiales but also indicated a posi- 
tion within Ochnaceae (Melville 1971; Fay et al. 1997b; 
Schneider et al. 2014). In fact, Ochnaceae, Medusagyn- 
aceae, and Quiinaceae form a distinctive clade (Nandi et al. 
1998; Savolainen et al. 2000a; Xi et al. 2012b) in which 
leaves have well-defined secondary and tertiary venation 
(for floral features, see, Matthews et al. 2012). It seems 
appropriate to combine all of these into a single family, 
Ochnaceae (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; 
Schneider et al. 2014; see Chapter 12). 
There are three major clades in Malpighiales (see Xi et al. 
2012b): the Rhizophoraceae-Clusiaceae, Malpighiaceae- 
Chrysobalanaceae, and Salicaceae-Euphorbiaceae clades. 
We briefly cover each below. 
Caraceae, 

224 Chapter 10 
Rhizophoraceae-Clusiaceae—This subclade consists of 
Ctenolophonaceae, Erythroxylaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Ir- 
vingiaceae, Pandaceae, Ochnaceae (expanded to include 
Medusagynaceae and Quiinaceae, Fay et al. 1997b; Nandi 
et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 2000a; Chase et al. 2002; Ko- 
rotkova et al. 2009; Xi et al. 2012b); Bonnetiaceae, Clu- 
siaceae, Calophyllaceae, Hypericaceae, and Podostemaceae 
form one large clade. 
Ctenolophonaceae, 
Erythroxylaceae, Rhizophoraceae 
form one subclade (Wurdack and Davis 2009), well sup- 
ported by floral morphology (Matthews and Endress 
2011). A close relationship between Erythroxylaceae and 
Rhizophoraceae has long been noted (Schwarzbach and 
Ricklefs 2000). Phylogenetic analysis of non-DNA charac- 
ters first recovered Rhizophoraceae + Erythroxylaceae s.s. 
(Hufford 1992), and their close relationship is supported 
by embryological features, the presence of the alkaloid 
hygroline, and a unique sieve-tube plastid type (Behnke 
1988b; Nandi et al. 1998; reviewed in Schwarzbach and 
Ricklefs 2000). The many features shared by these families 
was recognized by Dahlgren (1988), but he did not con- 
sider them closely related. The mangrove habit associated 
with Rhizophoraceae is restricted to only a few members 
(Cronquist 1988). Relationships and character evolution 
within Rhizophoraceae have been analyzed (Schwarzbach 
and Ricklefs 2000). In addition, the poorly known African 
genus Aneulophus (Erythroxylaceae) 
is morphologically 
similar to some Rhizophoraceae. 
A well-supported clusioid clade was recovered, which 
comprises Bonnetiaceae, Calophyllaceae, Clusiaceae s.s., 
Hypericaceae, as well as the aquatic family Podostema- 
ceae. Species of this subclade are important components of 
tropical forests (Ruhfel et al. 2011). Bonnetiaceae, a small 
enigmatic family segregated from Theaceae (Chapter 11), 
was found to be sister to Clusiaceae s.s. (Savolainen et al. 
2000b; Ruhfel et al. 2011, 2013). Bonnetiaceae + Clusia- 
ceae are sister to Calophyllaceae + (Hypericaceae + Po- 
dostemonaceae). Ochnaceae are then sister to all of these 
families (Fig. 10.12). There are non-DNA synapomorphies 
for some of these relationships. Members of the entire Bon- 
netiaceae through Podostemaceae clade share distinctive 
xanthones; tenuinucellate ovules are known from Clusia- 
ceae and Podostemaceae (e.g., Contreras et al. 1993; Jager- 
Zurn 1997; Endress et al. 2013). Relationships within 
Clusiaceae s.s. have been investigated by Gustafsson et al. 
(2002), Sweeney (2008), and Ruhfel et al. (2011, 2013). 
DNA studies provided support for an expanded Ochnaceae 
that includes Quiinaceae and Medusagynaceae (Fay et al. 
1997a,b). Based on morphology, there is no clear reason 
for separating these families (Fay et al. 1997a,b; Nandi 
et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 2014). 
Also well-supported 
is Calophyllaceae 
+ (Hyperica- 
ceae, Podostemaceae). The placement of Podostemaceae 
with these families is one of several examples of enigmatic 
aquatics being successfully placed with DNA data. Podoste- 
maceae are highly modified submerged aquatics variously 
associated with Piperaceae, Nepenthaceae, Polygonaceae, 
Caryophyllaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Rosaceae, Crassula- 
ceae, or Saxifragaceae in previous classifications (see Ueda 
et al. 1997; D. Soltis et al. 1999; Gustafsson et al. 2002; Xi 
et al. 2012b). Molecular phylogenetic analyses placed Po- 
dostemaceae in Malpighiales with strong support as sister 
to Hypericaceae with Calophyllaceae their immediate sister 
(see Ruhfel et al. 2011). Podostemaceae have been well in- 
vestigated phylogenetically with three subclades recognized 
(see Koi et al. 2012): 
A close relationship between Irvingiaceae and Panda- 
ceae is strongly supported, but relationships of these two 
families to other Malpighiales is unclear. 
Malpighiaceae-Chrysobalanaceae—This subclade com- 
prises Lophopyxidaceae, Putranjivaceae, Caryocaraceae, 
Centroplacaceae, Elatinaceae, Malpighiaceae, Balanopa- 
ceae, Trigoniaceae, Dichapetalaceae, and Chrysobalana- 
ceae. There are few well-supported relationships within this 
subclade, although relationships among Centroplacaceae + 
(Elatinaceae + Malpighiaceae) and Balanopaceae, Chryso- 
balanaceae, Trigoniaceae, Dichapetalaceae, and Euphro- 
niaceae receive good support (Fig. 10.12). This illustrates 
well a problem encountered throughout Malpighiales—it 
. 
contains families not considered closely related in any tra- 
ditional classifications. According to Cronquist (1981) the 
monogeneric Balanopaceae belonged in Hamamelidae, 
with the remaining families placed in different orders of his 
Rosidae (Dichapetalaceae in Sapindales; Chrysobalanaceae 
in Rosales; Trigoniaceae and Euphroniaceae in Polygala- 
les). Trigoniaceae, 
Dichapetalaceae, 
Chrysobalanaceae, 
and Euphroniaceae, as well as several other Malpighiales, 
all have incompletely tenuinucellate ovules, a feature rare 
outside of asterids (Endress 2003b, 2011a; Matthews and 
Endress 2008; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; Chapter 12). 
However, Balanops, which is sister to this clade, has crassi- 
nucellate ovules (Merino Sutter and Endress 2003). 
Salicaceae-Euphorbiaceae—This 
third large subclade 
consists of Humiriaceae, Achariaceae, Goupiaceae, Viola- 
ceae, Passifloraceae, Lacistemataceae, Salicaceae, Peraceae, 
Euphorbiaceae, Rafflesiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Picodendra- 
ceae, Linaceae, and Ixonanthaceae. Several subclades within 
this clade are well supported: 1) Humiriaceae, Achariaceae, 
Goupiaceae, Violaceae, 
Passifloraceae, Lacistemataceae, 
Salicaceae; 2) Peraceae, Rafflesiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Phyl- 
lanthaceae, Picodendraceae, Linaceae, and Ixonanthaceae. 
Peraceae are sister to Rafflesiaceae + Euphorbiaceae. Within 
the second subclade, two small subclades are recovered, but 
other relationships remain less clear: Phyllanthaceae + Pic- 

rodendraceae and Linaceae + Ixonanthaceae;_inethe second 
there is a tendency to form secondary septa, in addition to 
the normal septa, in the ovary (Endress et al. 2013). 
One Salicaceae-Euphorbiaceae subclade receiving sup- 
port (subclade 1 above) includes families traditionally 
considered closely related based on sharing: parietal pla- 
centation: Salicaceae, Achariaceae and Violaceae, Flacour- 
tiaceae, Passifloraceae, Malesherbiaceae and Turneraceae 
(part of the Dilleniidae of Cronquist 1981). Of these, Passi- 
floraceae s.s. are sister to Malesherbiaceae + Turneraceae. A 
close relationship among these three families has long been 
recognized (e.g., Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997); they 
produce structurally related cyanogenic glycosides with 
a cyclopentenoid ring system (see also Achariaceae) and 
similar hydrolytic enzymes (Spencer and Seigler 1985a,b; 
Takhtajan 1997). Turneraceae and Passifloraceae possess 
foliar glands; both have biparental or paternal transmis- 
sion of plastids (Malesherbiaceae have not been examined); 
in most angiosperms plastids are maternally inherited (e.g., 
Shore et al. 1994). Malesherbiaceae, some Turneraceae, 
and Passifloraceae also possess an extrastaminal corona, 
and possess a hypanthium-like structure that does not bear 
the stamens and a corona, lost in most Turneraceae. 
In Chase et al. (2002), Turneraceae plus Malesherbia- 
ceae were sister to Passifloraceae. Historically (e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981), Passifloraceae were considered to differ from 
Turneraceae on being vining versus herbs, shrubs, or trees, 
but this is highly artificial; few characters differentiate 
these families as narrowly circumscribed. Furthermore, un- 
published data (M. W. Chase and L. W. Chatrou) had sug- 
gested that Passifloraceae were paraphyletic and included 
both Turneraceae and Malesherbiaceae, which impacted 
APG classifications (APG II 2003; APG III 2009). Recent 
studies indicate that Passsifloraceae s.1 are monophyletic 
but also support Turneraceae as sister to Passifloraceae s.s. 
(Korotkova et al. 2009; Tokuoka 2012) with monogeneric 
Malesherbiaceae then sister to the rest. Easily recognized 
characters (above) could be considered synapomorphies 
for Passifloraceae s.l. 
Phylogenetic analyses indicated that major changes 
needed to be made in the delimitation of Euphorbiacae. 
Studies have revealed a narrowly defined Euphorbiaceae 
and recovered several other well-separated clades of former 
euphorbs (e.g., Drypetes and Putranjiva; genera of Panda- 
ceae; Phyllanthaceae) that have closest relatives elsewhere 
in Malpighiales. In APG III (2009) and IV (2016), Euphor- 
biaceae in the traditional sense were divided into four fami- 
lies: Euphorbiaceae s.s., Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae, 
and Putranjivaceae. Furthermore, DNA studies indicated 
that groups within Euphorbiaceae s.s also needed reconsid- 
eration (Wurdack and Chase 2002; Wurdack et al. 2005; 
Tokuoka 2007). Euphorbiaceae s.s. consist of the uniovu- 
Superrosids 
225 
late Euphorbioideae, Crotonoideae, and Acalyphoideae. 
Phyllanthaceae 
include 
the biovulate 
Phyllanthoideae, 
whereas Picrodendraceae include the biovulate Oldfieldioi- 
deae. Furthermore, parasitic Rafflesiaceae need to be acco- 
modated (below). Peraceae are recognized to deal with Raf- 
flesiaceae, but whether they should be segregated depends 
on the position of Rafflesiaceae—more work is needed. 
Multiple complete nuclear genome sequences are avail- 
able, useful resources in evolutionary studies: rubber, He- 
vea brasilensis, manihot, Manihot esculenta, and castor 
bean, Ricinus communis. 
Drypetes and Putranjiva (Putranjivaceae) represent a 
distinct clade of former euphorbs (Rodman et al. 1998; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000). Evidence is available from seed-coat 
morphology (structure of the exotegmen; seeds exotegmic 
vs. endotestal) to support some of these groups (Corner 
1976; Tokuoka and Tobe 2001), but additional investi- 
gations are needed. Genera of Pandaceae have also been 
placed within Euphorbiaceae (Thorne 1992a,b) or close 
to the family in Euphorbiales (Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 
1997). However, sequence data reveal that Pandaceae, a 
family of three genera, may be sister to Lophopyxidaceae 
(a family of one genus placed in or near Celastraceae by 
Cronquist 1981), or Lophopyxidaceae are sister to Putran- 
jivaceae (Xi et al. 2012b) (for floral structure, see Matthews 
and Endress 2013). Euphorbiaceae, in the narrow sense, 
have been investigated phylogenetically (Wurdack et al. 
2004, 2005). Phyllanthaceae comprise two major clades 
(Wurdack et al. 2004; Kathriarachchi et al. 2005; Samuel 
et al. 2005; Hoffmann et al. 2006). 
Linaceae now include Hugoniaceae; a close relationship 
of the two was long suggested (Takhtajan 1997) and their 
separation was largely geographical. Whereas Linaceae s.s. 
are widely distributed, especially in temperate areas and the 
subtropics, Hugoniaceae are largely found in the tropics of 
the Southern Hemisphere. 
The Flacourtiaceae problem—Flacourtiaceae, as previ- 
ously defined (see Gilg 1925; Sleumer 1954, 1980; Lemke 
1988; Judd 1997), were shown to be polyphyletic in DNA 
studies (Chase et al. 2002). The former, broadly defined 
family is composed of two major subclades that are more 
closely related to other families in Malpighiales than to 
each other. Thus, Chase et al. (2002) recognized two fami- 
lies: a broadly defined Salicaceae (which include Salicaceae, 
some Flacourtiaceae, the tribe Abatieae of Passifloraceae 
and the monogeneric Scyphostegiaceae; Bernhard 1999) 
and the expanded family Achariaceae (which include other 
former Flacourtiaceae, such as Kiggelaria, as well as Acha- 
ria and Guthriea of Achariaceae). The name Achariaceae 
was used because members of this poorly known family 
with three highly modified genera appeared as sister to 
Kiggelaria plus related genera (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Chase 

226 Chapter 10 
et al. 2002), and so the name of the family becomes the 
older conserved name, Achariaceae (not Kiggelariaceae as 
in several papers). 
Salicaceae are now broadly defined (APG III 2009; APG 
IV 2016) to include taxa (but some split Salicaceae into 
Salicaceae and Samydaceae), formerly placed in Flacourtia- 
ceae, that possess salicoid teeth (Nandi et al. 1998), have 
centrifugal stamen initiation (Bernhard and Endress 1999), 
lack cyanogenic glycosides of the gynocardin type, usually 
have small globose anthers, and possess generally small 
flowers in which the sepals and petals, if both are pres- 
ent, are equal in number or, as in many Salicaceae s.l. (e.g., 
Azara, Idesia), petals are frequently absent. The situation is 
reversed in Achariaceae; most lack salicoid teeth, have cen- 
tripetal or simultaneous stamen initiation (Bernhard and 
Endress 1999), produce cyclopentenoid cyanogenic glyco- 
sides, usually have elongate anthers, and have large flow- 
ers typically with sepals and petals not equal in number 
but with petals always present. In addition, members of the 
lepidopteran genus Cupha feed only on species of the ex- 
panded Salicaceae (Nandi et al. 1998). Chase et al. (2002) 
provided an assessment of subclades within the family. Al- 
though the expansion of Salicaceae to include the largely 
tropical tribes of Flacourtiaceae appears to challenge the 
concept of the family as one of cool, north-temperate re- 
gions, the diversity of Populus (Salicaceae s.s.) actually 
reaches its peak in warm temperate to subtropical latitudes, 
and temperate members occur in China and Chile. Further- 
more, those species of Populus most resembling former 
Flacourtiaceae in morphology are tropical (Eckenwalder 
1996; Chase et al. 2002). Also, whereas Salix is most di- 
verse in the Northern Hemisphere, its distribution includes 
Africa, Malaysia, and Central and South America (Argus 
1997). The large genus Salix has also been the focus of phy- 
logenetic study (Azuma et al. 2000; Hardig et al. 2010). 
Although Lacistemataceae had been placed in Flacour- 
tiaceae by some (e.g., Sleamer 1980), Cronquist (1981) and 
Takhtajan (1997) recognized Lacistemataceae as a distinct 
family consisting of Lacistema and Lozania, two small 
woody genera from Central and South America. In initial 
DNA analyses, the placement of Lacistemataceae within 
Malpighiales was unclear (D. Soltis et al. 2000), although 
Chase et al. (2002) suggested a close relationship to the 
expanded Salicaceae; this relationship was later confirmed 
(Soltis et al. 2011; Xi et al. 2012b). 
The extent of the taxonomic confusion surrounding the 
former broadly defined Flacourtiaceae is further illustrated 
by the placements of several other genera formerly placed 
in the family by some authors (e.g., Aphloia, Asteropeia, 
Berberidopsis, Gerrardinia, Muntingia, and Plagiopteron, 
as well as genera of Peridiscaceae; for the last see Saxifra- 
gales, above). Molecular analyses indicated that these and 
other genera must be excluded not only from Flacourtia- 
ceae but also from Malpighiales. For example, Berberidop- 
sis (Berberidopsidaceae) is sister to Aextoxicon (Aextoxi- 
caceae) (see “Berberidopsidales” in Chapter 11). Aphloia 
(Aphloiaceae), formerly placed in Flacourtiaceae, is in the 
rosid order Crossosomatales in its own family Aphloiaceae 
(discussed below). Another former Flacourtiaceae, Plagiop- 
teron (sometimes recognized as a distinct family, Plagiop- 
teridaceae; Airy Shaw 1964; Takhtajan 1997), is embedded 
in a broadly defined Celastraceae (discussed below). Le- 
thedon was referred to Flacourtiaceae because it possesses 
cyanogenic glycosides (Spencer and Seigler 1985b), but the 
genus is well supported as part of Thymelaeaceae in Mal- 
vales (Savolainen et‘al. 2000b; van der Bank et al. 2002; see 
below). Alzateaceae were included by Hutchinson (1967) 
in Flacourtiaceae, but the family is a member of Myrtales 
(Graham 1984; Conti et al. 1996). Gerrardinia has been 
shown to belong to Huerteales and is now considered a 
monogeneric family (Woberg et al. 2009; Christenhusz 
et al. 2010). Both Asteropeia and Dioncophyllum have been 
placed in Flacourtiaceae (e.g., Hutchinson 1967). In con- 
trast, Schmid (1964) proposed that Dioncophyllum was re- 
lated to Droseraceae; both Asteropeia and Dioncophyllum 
(with Droseraceae) appeared as members of Caryophylla- 
les in DNA analyses (see Chapter 11). Muntingia (included 
in Flacourtiaceae only by Cronquist 1981), together with 
Dicraspidia, were placed in Malvales as a distinct family, . 
Muntingiaceae (Bayer et al. 1998) (see Malvids, below). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN MALPIGHIALES 
Euphorbiaceae, with diverse growth forms and habit, have 
been the focus of multiple studies of character evolution. 
Euphorbia (with ~2000 species it is one of the largest gen- 
era of angiosperms) has been of particular interest. Horn 
et al. (2012) revealed that the xeric habit has evolved at 
least 14 times in this large genus. 
Phyllanthaceae provide an excellent example of co- 
speciation involving plant host and pollinators. Phyloge- 
netic analyses of species of the genus Glochidion (Phyllan- 
thaceae) and their coevolving pollinating floral parasitic 
moths (genus Epicephala) have been conducted (Kawakita 
et al. 2004). Comparisons of the phylogenetic trees of host 
and pollinator reveal that they match closely (Fig. 10.22). 
Glochidion species and species of Epicephala show an 
overall pattern of co-speciation, but there are also occa- 
sional shifts of the moths onto more distantly related plants 
(Kawakita et al. 2004; Thompson 2013). 
Phylogenetic studies have also provided insights into 
biogeography, as well as fruit and pollen diversification 
within Malpighiaceae (Cameron et al. 2001; Davis et al. 
2001, 2002). Davis et al. (2002, 2005b) showed that the

family was once distributed to the north and then mi- 
grated south into the tropics, supporting a boreal tropical 
hypothesis as applying to Malpighiaceae. The rapid radia- 
tion of Malpighiales also has broader implications, sup- 
porting a mid-Cretaceous origin of modern tropical rain 
forests. 
Species of Rafflesiaceae possess the largest flowers (up 
to 1 meter in diameter). Traditionally, the relationships 
of the family were highly debated. Placement of the para- 
sitic Rafflesiaceae with Euphorbiaceae represents a break- 
through in our understanding of the evolution of parasitic 
plants (Fig. 10.23). Most Euphorbiaceae have small flow- 
ers, so the results suggest that the large flowers of Raffle- 
siaceae evolved from ancestors with small flowers—a dra- 
matic example of size evolution (Davis et al. 2007; Nikolov 
et al. 2013, 2014). In fact, the large flowers of Rafflesia 
may be 200x the size of a flower of some Euphorbiaceae 
(Figs. 10.23 and 10.20d,e; flowers not to same scale). 
Davis and Wurdack (2004) documented movement of 
mitochondrial genes into Rafflesiaceae; these apparently 
were acquired via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from 
their obligate hosts in the grape family, Tetrastigma. The 
results suggested that in some instances HGT events are 
facilitated by the intimate association between the parasite 
and the host (see Chapter 15 for discussion of HGT). 
OXALIDALES 
— 
Phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Savolainen 
et al. 2000a,b; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000) indicated that Oxalidales consist 
of seven families (Fig. 10.12) that had not all previously 
Superrosids 227

Figure 10.22. 
Co-speciation in plants of the genus 
Glochidion (Phyllanthaceae) and their coevolv- 
ing pollinating floral parasitic moths in the genus 
Epicephala. When perfect co-speciation occurs, each 
speciation event in the plants or the moths would be 
matched by a speciation event in the other lineage. 
In this system, Glochidion species and Epicephala 
show an overall pattern of co-speciation; but there 
are also some occasional shifts of the moths onto 
more distantly related plants. (Modified from Thomp- 
son 2012, p. 339, based on Kawakita et al. 2004.) 
been considered closely related: Huaceae, Brunelliaceae, 
the carnivorous Cephalotaceae, as well as Connaraceae, 
Cunoniaceae (including Eucryphiaceae and Davidsonia- 
ceae), Elaeocarpaceae 
(including Tremandraceae), 
and 
Oxalidaceae (several are illustrated in Fig. 10.13). Brunel- 
liaceae, a monogeneric family from tropical America, were 
included in Cunoniaceae in APG (1998; see also Hufford 
and Dickison 1992), but their position in recent analyses 
as sister to the subclade of Elaeocarpaceae—Cunoniaceae— 
Cephalotaceae, rather than as part of Cunoniaceae, justi- 
fies continued familial status (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; 
APG IV 2016). 
Oxalidales represent another rosid clade composed 
of families previously placed in several different orders 
in morphology-based classifications. Most families were 
placed in the traditionally recognized Rosidae, with Cepha- 
lotaceae, Brunelliaceae, and Cunoniaceae all considered 
part of Rosales (sensu Cronquist 1981); Oxalidaceae were 
placed in Geraniales; Connaraceae were considered part of 
Sapindales, and Tremandraceae were placed in Polygalales. 
Elaeocarpaceae were placed in Malvales of subclass Dil- 
leniidae. The affinities of Huaceae have long been obscure. 
The two genera (Hua and Afrostyrax) have been placed in 
or near Styracaceae (Heywood 1993; a family in Ericales), 
placed in Violales (Cronquist 1981), or considered closely 
related to Sterculiaceae in Malvales (Takhtajan 1997). 
Thus, this small clade again illustrates a pattern seen 
throughout the rosids—clades now recognized as orders 
(sensu APG 1998; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 
2016) are composed of taxa previously considered dis- 
tantly related in traditional classifications. As with other 
orders of rosids, non-DNA synapomorphies for Oxalidales

Phylogeny of Euphorbiaceae, including members of Rafflesiaceae (in bold). This tree is based on a temporally calibrated ML tree. ML bootstrap and 
Bayesian Posterior Probability values, respectively, are provided above nodes. Support values < 50%/0.50 are designated with asterisks. Flower size diameters (in mm) 
are provided (right), and ancestral flower size estimates are indicated at the stem and crown nodes of Rafflesiaceae. Reconstructions indicate a 79-fold increase in 
floral diameter for stem lineage Rafflesiaceae (with a 95% confidence interval of 74- to 83-fold). For additional ancestral size estimates see SOM text. Color images 
with scale bars illustrate the approximate sizes of flowers representative of the three genera of Rafflesiaceae (Rafflesia arnoldii, Rhizanthes lowii, and Sapria hima- 
layana), plus a representative of Euphorbiaceae (Ditaxis neomexicana), the latter being similar in size to the inferred ancestral flowers at the stem node of Rafflesia- 
ceae. (Modified from Davis et al. 2007.) 

are unclear, but see Matthews and Endress (2@02) for po- 
tential synapomorphies in floral structure (below). 
In early DNA analyses the problematic Huaceae ap- 
peared as sister to the strongly supported Celastrales clade, 
but with weak support (e.g., Savolainen et al. 2000a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000). With large multi-gene datasets, Hua- 
ceae are sister to the remainder of Oxalidales with strong 
support (BS = 82% in Soltis et al. 2011;'BS = 100% in 
H. Wang et al. 2009). Thus, Oxalidales comprise Huaceae 
as sister to the remaining families, which comprise two sub- 
clades: Connaraceae + Oxalidaceae and Cunoniaceae as 
sister to (Brunelliaceae + Cephalotaceae) + Elaeocarpaceae 
(Fig. 10.12). 
Phylogenetic studies indicated that Cunoniaceae be 
broadly defined to include both Bauera and Davidsonia 
(but not Brunellia, which had sometimes also been in- 
cluded), genera sometimes placed in Baueraceae and Da- 
vidsoniaceae, respectively (see also Hufford and Dickison 
1992). However, Aphanopetalum, previously placed in Cu- 
noniaceae, has been shown to belong in Saxifragales (Fish- 
bein et al. 2001; see above). 
The close relationship between Elaeocarpaceae and Tre- 
mandraceae (the former now including the latter) was un- 
expected. Elaeocarpaceae had been placed in Malvales in 
recent classifications, but they lack many of the non-DNA 
synapomorphies for the latter group (see “Malvales,” be- 
low). Tremandraceae had been placed in Polygalales (sub- 
class Rosidae) in recent classifications and therefore were 
not considered a close relative of Elaeocarpaceae (Cron- 
quist 1981), but they share most of their characters with 
some Elaeocarpaceae, especially their capsular fruit, and 
differ only in having a definite number of stamens rather 
than indefinite numbers as in Elaeocarpaceae. 
The clade of Oxalidaceae + Connaraceae is morpho- 
logically well separated from the remainder of the order, 
possessing tristyly, postgenital union of petals into a basal 
tube, congenitally united stamens, hemianatropous to al- 
most orthotropous ovules, and a special type of sieve tube 
plastids (Matthews and Endress 2002). Elaeocarpaceae (in- 
cluding the genera of former Tremandraceae) are also well 
supported, characterized by buzz-pollination and a syn- 
drome of structural features functionally connected with 
it. In addition, flowers have involute petals that are longer 
than the sepals in advanced buds, three vascular traces, and 
stamens partly wrapped by adjacent petals; ovules have a 
chalazal appendage and a thick inner integument. 
Cephalotaceae, an Australian carnivorous family with 
pitcher-trap leaves comprising one species (C. follicularis; 
see Fig. 10.13e), are morphologically isolated. The family 
also exemplifies one of several independent origins of car- 
nivory and the pitcher-type trap (see Chapter 13). Cepha- 
lotus (Cephalotaceae) and Cunoniaceae had been placed in 
Superrosids 
229 
Rosales in recent classifications (e.g., Cronquist 1981) and 
share several floral features. 
CELASTRALES 
Celastrales were recognized in Judd et al. (1999). Addi- 
tional phylogenetic analyses supported recognition of Lepi- 
dobotryaceae, Parnassiaceae 
(including Lepuropetalon), 
and an expanded Celastraceae (discussed below) as an or- 
der, Celastrales (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; 
Fig. 10.12; several families are illustrated in Fig. 10.13). 
This circumscription of Celastrales differs substantially 
from those in morphology-based classifications (e.g., Cron- 
quist and Takhtajan). The delimitation of the order based 
on morphology has been highly variable, with several fami- 
lies, including Rhamnaceae, Salvadoraceae, Vitaceae, Aqui- 
foliaceae, and Icacinaceae, placed in Celastrales in various 
classifications (Hutchinson 1973; Cronquist 1981, 1988; 
Takhtajan 1987, 1997; Heywood 1993; see Savolainen 
et al. 1994). However, molecular analyses demonstrated 
that most families previously placed in Celastrales should 
be assigned to other orders (see Savolainen et al. 1994, 
1997; Simmons et al. 2001). 
As with many rosid clades now recognized as orders 
based on DNA data, nonmolecular synapomorphies for 
Celastrales are unclear (for floral features, see Matthews 
and Endress 2005a). Celastrales comprise an expanded 
Celastraceae sister to Lepidobotryaceae. Lepidobotryaceae 
consist of two disjunct genera, Rutiliocarpon and Lepido- 
botrys, in Central America and tropical Africa, respectively. 
Cronquist (1981) placed these genera 
in Oxalidaceae, 
whereas Takhtajan (1997) considered Lepidobotryaceae 
and Oxalidaceae closely related. However, Oxalidaceae are 
placed in a distinct clade (Oxalidales, see above). 
Based on molecular analyses, Celastraceae were greatly 
expanded to include the small families Brexiaceae, Hip- 
pocrateaceae, Stackhousiaceae, Plagiopteridaceae, Parnas- 
siaceae, and Canotiaceae (Savolainen et al. 1994, 1997, 
2000b; Simmons et al. 2001; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
Parnassiaceae are morphologically distinctive (e.g., they do 
not have fiaments inserted at the outer border of a nectar 
disk). 
Four morphological synapomorphies, all of which show 
reversals, support a broadly defined Celastraceae (Simmons 
et al. 2001): stamen and staminode number each equal 
petal number; filaments are inserted at the outer border 
of, or within, the conspicuous nectar disk; styles are con- 
nate; and two to four ovules per locule are present. Other 
possible synapomorphies include the presence of crystals 
in leaf epidermis (Baas et al. 1979) and an integumentary 
tapetum (Johri et al. 1992; Tang 1994; Nandi et al. 1998; 

230 Chapter 10 
Matthews and Endress 2005a). Members of a broadly cir- 
cumscribed Celastraceae also share completely syncarpous 
gynoecia with commissural stigmatic lobes, only weakly 
crassinucellar or incompletely tenuinucellar ovules, partly 
fringed sepals and petals, protandry in bisexual flowers 
combined with herkogamy by the movement of stamens 
and anther abscission from filaments, and stamens fused 
with the ovary (Matthews and Endress 2005a). 
Questions about the distinctiveness of Celastraceae and 
Hippocrateaceae have existed since the two families were 
first described, so it is not surprising that the latter were 
‘found to be nested within Celastraceae. Similarly, although 
Brexia was variously placed (e.g., Saxifragaceae s.l., Es- 
calloniaceae, Grossulariaceae, and Brexiaceae, reviewed 
in Morgan and Soltis 1993), a close relationship between 
Brexia and Celastraceae had also been proposed based 
on morphology (Perrier de la Bathie 1933; see Takhtajan 
1991, 1997). Plagiopteron had been placed in Tiliaceae 
and Flacourtiaceae, and sometimes recognized as a distinct 
family, Plagiopteridaceae (Airy Shaw 1965; Hutchinson 
1967). However, Plagiopteron also fits well in a broadly de- 
fined Celastraceae based on leaf and wood anatomy (Baas 
et al. 1979) and embryology (Tang 1994). The molecular 
placement of Stackhousiaceae within Celastraceae also was 
not surprising based on morphological similarities. Cano- 
tia had been variously placed in Rutaceae, Koeberliniaceae, 
Canotiaceae, and Celastraceae, but both molecular and em- 
bryological data (Tobe and Raven 1993) indicated a close 
relationship of Canotia to Acanthothamnus within Celas- 
traceae (Simmons et al. 2001). Parnassiaceae are not recog- 
nized in APG IV (2016) or here (see Chapter 12), and this 
clade, which may be sister to remaining members of Celas- 
traceae, comprises Parnassia and the monotypic Lepuro- 
petalon, the smallest terrestrial angiosperm (often placed 
in its own family; see Spongberg 1972; Gastony and Soltis 
1977). Cronquist (1981) placed Parnassiaceae with Saxi- 
fragaceae, but Takhtajan (1991, 1997) included the family 
in Celastrales. 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN CELASTRALES 
Simmons et al. (2001) showed the complex nature of fruit 
and aril diversification within Celastraceae, with multiple 
origins of most fruit and aril forms. There have been many 
transitions from dehiscent to indehiscent fruit types. Nuts, 
drupes, samaras, and berries have arisen many times inde- 
pendently, most often from capsules; similarly, arils (fleshy 
covering surrounding seed) apparently arose once or twice 
in the family and have been lost in five or six lineages (Sim- 
mons et al. 2001). Other studies have similarly indicated 
the lability of fruit evolution within families (e.g., Manos 
and Stone 2001—see “Fagales,” above; Richardson et al. 
2000; Davis et al. 2001). 
Malvids 
Three genes provided strong support for a core clade 
(eurosid Il; now malvids or Malvidae) that included the 
well-supported groups Brassicales, Malvales, Sapindales, 
and Huerteales (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000). It was initially 
unclear, however, if other orders may also be part of eu- 
rosid II. In the three-gene analysis, for example, Myrtales 
appeared as sister in all shortest trees to the eurosid I clade, 
but Geraniales and Crossosomatales were related to the 
well-supported eurosid II clade. With larger datasets a well- 
supported malvid clade ultimately emerged consisting of 
Geraniales, Crossosomatales, Sapindales, Huerteales, Mal- 
vales, Picramniaceae, and Brassicales (Fig. 10.24). Myrtales 
+ Geraniales are sister to a large clade of the remaining 
members. Within that clade Crossosomatales and then Pic- 
ramniaceae are subsequent sisters to the remaining mem- 
bers of the clade: Sapindales and a clade of Huertelaes + 
(Brassicales + Malvales) (H. Wang et al. 2009; Worberg 
et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011). (Members are shown in 
Figs/10:25, 10.26:) 
MYRTALES 
Myrtales consist of 13 families (Fig. 10.24): Alzateaceae, 
Combretaceae, Crypteroniaceae, Heteropyxidaceae, Ly- 
thraceae (including Sonneratiaceae, Punicaceae, and Tra- 
paceae), 
Melastomataceae 
(including 
Memecylaceae— 
which should be named Olisbeoideae; or these two can be 
treated as sister families), Myrtaceae, Oliniaceae, Onagra- 
ceae, Penaeaceae, Psiloxylaceae, Vochysiaceae, and Rhyn- 
chocalycaceae (several are illustrated in Fig. 10.25). DNA 
data have provided a well-resolved phylogenetic tree for 
Mpyrtales (Fig. 10.24; Conti et al. 1993, 1996, 1997, 2002; 
Sytsma et al. 2004; Savolainen et al. 2000b; D. Soltis et al. 
2000, 2011; Clausing and Renner 2001). 
Comparable age estimates have been obtained for Myr- 
tales: H. Wang et al. (2009) 89-85 mya; Bell et al. (2010) 
99-89 mya; Thornhill et al. (2012) 98-86 mya. 
Myrtales have been well investigated. An entire issue 
of the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (1984; 
vol. 71, no. 3) was dedicated to the order, summarizing 
morphology, chemistry, anatomy, palynology, and embry- 
ology (e.g., Behnke 1984; Cronquist 1984; Dahlgren and 
Thorne 1984; Johnson and Briggs 1984; Patel et al. 1984; 
Tobe and Raven 1984; van Vliet and Baas 1984). Nonethe- 
less, disagreement persisted regarding the composition of, 
and relationships within, the order (Dahlgren and Thorne

lies were sometimes placed in Myrtales: Thymelaeaceae, 
Lecythidaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Haloragaceae, and Gun- 
neraceae (e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; Heywood 1993).

as well as relationships within the order 
(e.g., Conti 
et al. 1993, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2002; Sytsma et al. 2004; 
Savolainen et al. 2000b; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; Claus- 
ing and Renner 2001; Schonenberger and Conti 2003; 
Fig. 10.24: APG III 2009). The DNA-based circumscrip- 
tion of Myrtales agreed closely with that of Dahlgren and 
Thorne (1984), except that molecular studies indicated that 
Vochysiaceae also belong in Myrtales, a noteworthy result 
in that this family had never been associated with the order, 
but was placed in Polygalales (e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; 
Heywood 1993) or close to Polygalales (Takhtajan 1997). 
The unique floral morphology of Vochysiaceae (strongly 
asymmetric flowers, one fertile stamen, and the number 
of petals reduced to three, one, or none; Cronquist 1981) 
had made it difficult to place the family using morphology. 
Other families sometimes placed in Myrtales (e.g., Thyme- 
laeaceae, Lecythidaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Haloragaceae, 
and Gunneraceae) were clearly excluded from the order 
(Conti et al. 1993; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 
2000). 
Mpyrtales are characterized by two distinctive features of 
wood anatomy, presence of bicollateral vascular bundles in 
the primary stem and vestures in bordered pits of secondary 
xylem. Significantly, this combination is found in Vochysia- 
ceae. The occurrence of both features outside of Myrtales 
(e.g., Apocynaceae, Thymelaeaceae) is rare. Myrtales also 
possess methylated ellagic acids and intraxylary phloem 
(Nandi et al. 1998). Other synapomorphies include sta- 
mens incurved in bud and a single style (carpels completely 
connate), hypanthium (often with inner surface nectarifer- 
ous), and opposite leaves (Judd et al. 2008). Still other fea- 
tures are present in most Myrtales (Tobe and Raven 1983, 
1984): glandular anther tapetum, an inner integument with 
two layers, micropyle formed by both integuments, ephem- 
eral antipodal cells, and exalbuminous seeds. 
Combretaceae are sister to the remaining members of 
Mpyrtales (Fig. 10.23), followed by a strongly supported 
sister group of Lythraceae (broadly defined to include 
Trapa and Punica) + Onagraceae. The remaining families 
form two major subclades. In one of these subclades, an 
expanded Myrtaceae 
(including Heteropyxidaceae and 
Psiloxylaceae) are sister to Vochysiaceae. The second sub- 
clade consists of Melastomataceae (including Memecyla- 
ceae) as sister to a strongly supported clade consisting of 
Crypteroniaceae, Alzateaceae, and Penaeaceae (the latter

now includes Rhynchocalycaceae and Olinia@eae) (Conti 
et al. 1996; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; Clausing and Renner 
2001; Sytsma et al. 2004). 
Johnson and Briggs (1984) provided a cladistics analy- 
sis of interfamilial relationships within Myrtales based on 
morphological characters, using the circuniscription pro- 
posed by Dahlgren and Thorne (1984). Some of their re- 
sults compare favorably with the DNA-based topology; 
they recovered a clade of Myrtaceae, Heteropyxidaceae, 
and Psiloxylaceae (they did not include Vochysiaceae in 
their non-DNA analysis) as sister to Penaeaceae and Oli- 
niaceae (Schonenberger and Conti 2003). Analyses have 
also focused on phylogenetic relationships within families 
of Myrtales. Onagraceae, for example, are one of the best- 
studied angiosperm families (e.g., Raven 1979; Sytsma 
et al. 1990; Conti et al. 1993; Levin et al. 2003; Wagner 
et al. 2007). Other families of the order also have been the 
focus of phylogenetic analyses, including Myrtaceae (Briggs 
and Johnson 1979; Wilson et al. 2001, 2005; Wilson 
2011), Vochysiaceae (Litt 1999; Litt and Stevenson 2003), 
and Melastomataceae (Clausing et al. 2000; Clausing and 
Renner 2001; Renner and Meyer 2001; Renner et al. 2001; 
Michelangeli et al. 2004; Goldenberg et al. 2008, 2010; 
see also www.flmnh.ufl.edu/natsci/herbarium/melastomes/ 
default.htm), and Lythraceae (Graham et al. 1993) and Pe- 
naeaceae (Schonenberger and Conti 2003). 
The rich fossil record of Lythraceae (including Tra- 
paceae) has been carefully reviewed (Graham 2013), in- 
cluding numerous records from the Tertiary, as well as 
credible Campanian pollen records of Lythrum and Peplis 
from Wyoming (Grimsson et al. 2011). Myrtaceae are rep- 
resented by well-preserved guava-like fruits of Paleomyr- 
tinaea from the Paleocene of North Dakota and Eucalyp- 
tus fruits and foliage from Eocene of Argentina (Pigg et al. 
1993; Gandolfo et al. 2011). Pollen of Onagraceae is read- 
ily recognizable with occurrences of their distinctive pollen 
back to the Campanian (reviewed by Martin 2003) and 
Fuschia in the Oligocene of Australia (Berry et al. 1990). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN MYRTALES 
Fruit characters have been evolutionarily labile in Myrtales; 
this lability is seen throughout the angiosperms (see above, 
Fagales, Celastrales). In Myrtaceae, the plesiomorphic state 
is a dehiscent fruit; indehiscent fruits have evolved in four 
lineages, with three origins of fleshy fruits (Wilson et al. 
2001), but Biffin et al. (2010) showed that fleshy fruits have 
evolved independently twice in Myrtaceae; both shifts in 
fruit type has been accompanied by exceptional diversifica- 
tion rate shifts. Biffin et al. (2010) suggested that the evolu- 
tion of fleshy fruits is a key innovation for clades of Myrta- 
Superrosids 
233 
ceae inhabiting rainforest habitats. In Melastomataceae, 
berries evolved from capsules at least four times (Clausing 
and Renner 2001). Sytsma et al. (2004), in a broader analy- 
sis of Myrtales, also found that fleshy fruits had evolved 
multiple times. 
Renner et al. (2001) examined the historical biogeog- 
raphy of Melastomataceae in light of phylogenetic hy- 
potheses. The family has a pantropical distribution and, in 
contrast to earlier hypotheses, the results of Renner et al. 
indicated that the current distribution of Melastomataceae 
is the result of long-distance dispersal during the Neogene, 
rather than fragmentation of Gondwana. Similarly, Sytsma 
et al. (2004) showed that long-distance dispersal was im- 
portant in other Myrtales. They found that the African 
lineage of Vochysiaceae is nested within a South American 
clade and probably arose via long-distance dispersal dur- 
ing the Oligocene. Long-distance dispersal has been shown 
to be important in establishing the broad distributions of 
other families of flowering plants, including another rosid 
family, Simaroubaceae (Clayton et al. 2009; see above). 
Goldenberg et al. (2008) examined the complex rela- 
tionships between anther morphology and pollinators in 
the genus Miconia and relatives (Melastomataceae) and 
provided evidence for multiple independent derivations of 
several floral traits, including parallel derivation of stamen 
features (e.g., elongate to short anthers, minute to broader 
anther pores); some of these changes may be due to pol- 
linator shifts, especially from buzz pollination to standard, 
nonvibrational pollination. The loss of a nectary is a sy- 
napomorphy of Melastomataceae, but nectar glands have 
been re-acquired multiple times (Varassin et al. 2008). 
GERANIALES 
Geraniales comprise Geraniaceae (including Hypseochari- 
taceae), as sister to a broadly defined Francoaceae (includ- 
ing Bersamaceae, Greyiaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Meliantha- 
ceae, Rhyncothecaceae, and Francoaceae s.s.) (Fig. 10.24; 
APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12). In APG III (2009) Meli- 
anthaceae included Francoaceae and Greyiaceae. The old 
APG delimitation is based on results from studies that of- 
ten differed in taxonomic sampling (e.g., Savolainen et al. 
2000a; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011). The topology depicted 
here (Fig. 10.24) and the broad circumscription of Fran- 
coaceae follows APG IV (2016) and is based on the to- 
pology of Palazzesi et al. (2012) and Sytsma et al. (2014). 
The alternative would be three families: Melanthiaceae, 
Francoaceae, and Ledocarpaceae. Several representatives 
of Geraniales are illustrated in Fig. 10.25; Francoaceae s. |. 
comprise relatively few species while Geraniaceae contain 
~850 species. 
This circumscription of Geraniales represents another 

234 Chapter 10 
unexpected result of DNA studies (Price and Palmer 1993). 
Geraniaceae, Hypseocharitaceae (now part of Gerania- 
ceae), and Vivianiaceae were considered closely related in 
some treatments (e.g., Takhtajan 1997); Cronquist (1981) 
also placed them together in his Geraniaceae. They share 
vessels with simple perforations, fibers with simple pores, 
extrastaminal nectar glands, two ovules per locule, and five 
connate, more or less lobed carpels (usually). However, Ge- 
raniaceae have often been associated with Oxalidaceae, a 
family now part of Oxalidales. Furthermore, the remaining 
members of the molecular-based Geraniales clade (i.e., Me- 
lianthaceae, Francoaceae, and Greyiaceae) have not been 
closely associated with Geraniaceae in morphology-based 
classifications. For example, Francoaceae and Greyiaceae 
represent former members of Saxifragaceae s.l. (Morgan 
and Soltis 1993), whereas Melianthaceae were placed in 
Sapindales (Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997). 
The more or less lobed carpels and extrastaminal nec- 
taries are likely synapomorphies for Geraniales. Mor- 
phological evidence indicates that some of these families 
(Melianthaceae, Greyiaceae, and Francoaceae) are closely 
related (Danilova 1996; Ronse De Craene and Smets 1999; 
Savolainen et al. 2000b). As a result, in APG II (2003), 
Greyiaceae were merged with Melianthaceae, together 
with Francoaceae (comprising Francoa and Tetilla). How- 
ever, Francoa and Tetilla are both from Chile and the only 
members of Melianthaceae s.l. outside eastern and south- 
ern Africa; both are both herbaceous perennials and other- 
wise dissimilar to the other woody taxa of this group. The 
relationships of the small family Ledocarpaceae (consist- 
ing of Balbisia and Wendtia) were long obscure. Wendtia 
(Balbisia has not been included in most analyses) has been 
sister to Viviania in several studies and is now included in 
Vivianiaceae. Wendtia was not included in the analyses of 
D. Soltis et al. (2000, 2011). Ledocarpaceae are now in- 
cluded in Vivianiaceae. 
Pelargonium is noted for unusual plastid genome evolu- 
tion (e.g., inverted repeat expansion) (Guisinger et al. 2008, 
2011) as well as accelerated rates of sequence evolution 
for both mitochondrial and plastid genes (Cho et al. 2004; 
Parkinson et al. 2005; Bakker et al. 2006; Guisinger et al. 
2008). In fact, there have been multiple major increases 
as well as decreases in substitution rates in mtDNA genes 
in the family, particularly Pelargonium (Parkinson et al. 
2005). 
The plastid genomes of Geraniaceae have undergone 
extensive genomic changes compared to other plastid ge- 
nomes. The plastome genomes of Erodium texanum, Ge- 
ranium palmatum, and Monsonia speciosa, and Pelargo- 
nium hortorum have all been characterized (Palmer et al. 
1987; Guisinger et al. 2011). Geraniaceae plastomes are 
highly variable in size, gene content and order, repetitive 
DNA, and codon usage. For example, the plastid genome 
sequence of Monsonia speciosa is very small (128,787 bp; 
only nonphotosynthetic plants and lineages that have lost 
one copy of the inverted repeat are smaller); Pelargonium 
hortorum, in contrast, has the largest known plastid ge- 
nome (217,942 bp) (Guisinger et al. 2011). 
Analysis show highly accelerated plastid nucleotide 
substitution rates, both synonymous and nonsynonymous, 
throughout Geraniaceae (Guisinger et al. 2008). To explain 
these unusual substitution patterns in the highly rearranged 
Geraniaceae plastid genomes, Guisinger et al. (2008) sug- 
gested that aberrant DNA repair together with altered gene 
expression are possible factors. 
CROSSOSOMATALES 
Phylogenetic analyses indicated the presence of a previ- 
ously unrecognized assemblage of closely related taxa first 
designated Crossosomatales in APG II (2003). Circum- 
scription of this order was conservative in APG II (2003), 
consisting of only Crossosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, and 
Staphyleaceae (Figs. 10.24, 10.25). Early analyses of rbcL 
sequences alone indicated the presence of this Crossoso- 
matales clade (Savolainen et al. 2000b), as did analysis of 
three genes (D. Soltis et al. 2000). Early molecular studies 
indicated, albeit with weak support, that several other fam- 
ilies were related to Crossosomatales: Ixerbaceae, Aphloia- 
. 
ceae, Geissolomataceae, and Strasburgeriaceae (Savolainen 
et al. 2000b; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2007c; Sosa and Chase 
2003). With the sampling of additional genes and taxa, 
strengthened support for a close relationship of these other 
families to core Crossosomatales emerged, and the order 
was expanded (APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). In addition, 
Guamatela was found to be related and placed in its own 
family (Oh and Potter 2006). The order comprises two sub- 
clades: 1) Staphyleaceae 
+ Guamatelaceae subsequent sis- 
ters to Stachyuraceae + Crossosomataceae; 2) Aphloiaceae 
and Geissolomataceae as subsequent sisters to Strasburge- 
riaceae + Ixerbaceae (Sosa and Chase 2003; Oh and Potter 
2006; Oh 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Crossosomatales represent another unexpected assem- 
blage revealed by DNA analyses. Crossosomataceae and 
Stachyuraceae were placed by Heywood (1993) in Dil- 
leniidae, Dilleniales and Theales, respectively. However, 
other authors placed Crossosomataceae in or near Rosales 
(Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997). Staphyleaceae have 
been placed in Sapindales (Rosidae of most authors; Cron- 
quist 1981; Heywood 1993, 1998; Takhtajan 1997). Geis- 
solomataceae and Stachyuraceae have been placed together 
in Celastrales (Heywood 1993), but in other treatments 
have been variously placed. Ixerba has been placed in its 
own family, whereas Brexia and Roussea were in Brexi- 

aceae, or the three genera have each been pla@ed in sepa- 
rate families within Brexiales (Takhtajan 1997). However, 
based on DNA data these three genera are only distantly 
related (Koontz and Soltis 1999; Soltis et al. 2011). The 
monotypic Aphloia (Aphloiaceae) has been treated as a 
member of Flacourtiaceae, but the problems with Flacour- 
tiaceae were reviewed above (see Malpighiales, above). 
Takhtajan (1997) considered the monotypic Strasburgeria 
to represent “a New Caledonian relict” with “primitive 
characters”; he placed Strasburgeriaceae close to Ochna- 
ceae in his Ochnales, whereas Cronquist (1981) considered 
Strasburgeria to be a member of Ochnaceae. Guamatela 
was included in Rosaceae (see Oh and Potter 2006). 
Crossosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, and Staphyleaceae 
appear to share a seed type in which the cell walls of the 
many-layered testa are all, or mostly, lignified, and this may 
be synapomorphic for the order. It is unclear whether this 
feature occurs also in Guamatelaceae. This same seed mor- 
phology also occurs in Geissoloma, Ixerba, Strasburgeria, 
and Aphloia, strengthening support for a close relation- 
ship of these taxa to Crossosomatales and the broad cir- 
cumscription of the order. This further demonstrates that 
seed anatomy may be a valuable source of systematic in- 
formation; seed characters often appear highly congruent 
with phylogenetic relationships inferred from analyses of 
molecular data (see Nandi et al. 1998). The presence of a 
hypanthium with a nectiferous inner surface may also be 
synapomorphic. 
Despite diverse taxonomic placements, most Crossoso- 
matales are similar in floral morphology, possessing four or 
five sepals and petals, four or five stamens (numerous sta- 
mens in Aphloiaceae and some Crossosomataceae), four or 
five carpels, and a superior ovary, but these characters are, of 
course, widespread in the eudicots. A comparative study of 
floral characters in all seven families considered here (Cros- 
sosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, Staphyleaceae; Ixerbaceae, 
Aphloiaceae, Geissolomataceae, and Strasburgeriaceae) re- 
vealed potential synapomorphies for subclades recovered 
with molecular data within this extended Crossosomatales 
(Matthews and Endress 2005b). Floral structure supports a 
close relationship among the core Crossosomatales (Cros- 
sosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, and Staphyleaceae). In addi- 
tion, floral data support a particularly close relationship of 
Ixerbaceae and Strasburgeriaceae, as well as a close rela- 
tionship of Aphloiaceae and Geissolomataceae to these two 
families (Matthews and Endress 2005b). Crossosomatales 
are in need of additional investigation. 
PICRAMNIALES 
Alvaradoa and Picramnia (Picramniaceae) are two poorly 
understood genera from Central and tropical America, 
Superrosids 
235 
placed by Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997) in Sima- 
roubaceae. Alvaradoa has also been placed in its own fam- 
ily. The two genera appeared as sisters with strong support 
in early analyses (Savolainen et al. 2000a,b), but were not 
included in D. Soltis et al. (2000). Recent analyses (H. Wang 
et al. 2010; Soltis et al. 2011) have placed the Picramnia- 
ceae with strong support as sister to a clade of Sapindales, 
Huerteales, Brassicales, and Malvales. Hence, the family is 
not closely related to Simaroubaceae as traditionally main- 
tained. In addition, the recently described genus Nothotali- 
sia has been included in the family (Thomas 2011) (shown 
in Fig 10.25). 
SAPINDALES 
DNA investigations recovered a well-supported Sapindales 
comprising (Fig. 10.24) Anacardiaceae, Biebersteiniaceae, 
Burseraceae, Kirkiaceae, Meliaceae, Nitrariaceae (includ- 
ing Peganaceae and Tetradiclidaceae), Rutaceae, Simarou- 
baceae, and Sapindaceae (broadly defined to include Ace- 
raceae and Hippocastanaceae; APG 1998; D. Soltis et al. 
2000, 2011; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; 
several families are illustrated in Fig. 10.25 with fossils 
of Acer and Aesculus shown in Fig. 10.5). This composi- 
tion corresponds closely to Cronquist’s (1968, 1981, 1988) 
broad view of the order, although he included families in 
Sapindales now considered only distantly related to the 
group (e.g., Akaniaceae, including Bretschneideraceae, of 
Brassicales). In contrast, other authors divided the fami- 
lies of Sapindales between Rutales and Sapindales s.s. 
(e.g., Scholz 1964; Takhtajan 1987, 1997; Dahlgren 1989; 
Thorne 1992a,b). 
Although Sapindales were well supported in early DNA 
analyses (Gadek et al. 1996; Savolainen 
et al. 2000a; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000), non-DNA synapomorphies for the 
clade are less clear. Several characters are widespread in 
Sapindales: woodiness, exstipulate and pinnately com- 
pound leaves (sometimes becoming palmately compound, 
trifoliate, or unifoliate), generally small, tetra- or pentamer- 
ous flowers with a distinct nectar disc and imbricate peri- 
anth parts, and a tendency to apocarpy (but with postgeni- 
tally connected carpel tips) (Endress et al. 1983; Bachelier 
and Endress 2009; Ottra et al. 2013). The pinnately com- 
pound leaves and distinct, usually intrastaminal nectar disk 
(or ring of glands) are likely synapomorphic (Judd et al. 
2008). Early studies (Gadek et al. 1996; Savolainen et al. 
2000b) indicated several major subclades in Sapindales and 
these have generally been supported (Fig. 10.24). 
Biebersteiniaceae, followed by Nitrariaceae, appear as 
successive sisters to the remainder of Sapindales. Bieber- 
steinia comprises about five species previously placed in 
Geraniaceae (Heywood 1993). Takhtajan (1997), however, 

236 Chapter 10 
placed the genus in its own family and order close to Gera- 
niales. Biebersteiniaceae appeared as sister to the remaining 
members of Sapindales in Savolainen et al. (2000b). DNA 
analyses also provided support for a broadly defined Nitra- 
riaceae that also included Peganaceae and Tetradiclidaceae 
(APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). In molecular 
analyses, Nitrariaceae (consisting of the single genus Ni- 
traria) emerged as sister to Peganaceae (a family first recog- 
nized by Takhtajan 1969; see also Dahlgren 1980), which 
also included Tetradiclis (Tetradiclidaceae). Both Nitraria 
and Tetradiclis had previously been included in Zygophyl- 
laceae (Sheahan and Chase 1996). 
Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae, and Rutaceae form a well- 
supported subclade. Rutaceae include Cneorum (Cneora- 
ceae) and Ptaeroxylon (Ptaeroxylaceae) (Gadek et al. 1996; 
Chase et al. 1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b). Although 
some analyses recovered Meliaceae sister to Rutaceae + 
Simaroubaceae (Soltis et al. 2011), others find Rutaceae 
sister to Meliaceae + Simaroubaceae (H. Wang et al. 2009). 
This clade of three families is united by biosynthetically 
related triterpenoid derivatives, limonoids and quassinoids 
(Hegnauer 1962-1994). Cronquist (1988) also considered 
the families closely related because of the absence of resin 
ducts in the bark, rays, and veins. Relationships, biogeogra- 
phy, and evolution within Rutaceae have been examined in 
several studies (e.g., Chase et al. 1999; Groppo et al. 2008; 
Appelhans et al. 2011, 2012); relationships within Melia- 
ceae were analyzed by Muellner et al. (2003, 2006). 
Generic relationships within Simaroubaceae have been 
largely resolved (Clayton et al. 2007); those analyses (see 
character evolution below) also provided insights into 
long-distance dispersal events. 
Molecular data also indicated 
a strongly supported 
clade of Kirkiaceae (consisting of one genus) sister to Ana- 
cardiaceae and Burseraceae (D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; 
H. Wang et al. 2009). This close relationship is not evi- 
dent based on non-DNA characters (but see Bachelier and 
Endress 2008). Takhtajan (1987, 1997) recognized Kirki- 
aceae as a distinct family of two genera, Kirkia and Pleio- 
kirkia (the latter has not been included in phylogenetic 
analyses), from Africa and Madagascar, respectively. Mo- 
lecular evidence confirmed that the enigmatic Kirkiaceae 
represent a distinct family within Sapindales (Gadek et al. 
1996; Savolainen et al. 2000b). Cronquist (1983) placed 
Kirkiaceae in Simaroubaceae and Takhtajan (1997) placed 
the family near Simaroubaceae; Kirkia lacks the distinc- 
tive secondary compounds found throughout Sapindales 
(see Mulholland et al. 2003). Anacardiaceae and Bursera- 
ceae do display noteworthy non-DNA similarities, includ- 
ing the presence of vertical intercellular secretory canals in 
the primary and secondary phloem (Gadek et al. 1996); 
they also possess resin canals in the leaves and are the only 
two families of Sapindales from which biflavones are re- 
ported (Wannan et al. 1985). Anacardiaceae as defined here 
and by APG (1998), APG II (2003), APG III (2009), and 
APG IV (2016) also include Podoaceae, Julianiaceae, and 
Blepharocaryaceae; these families were typically included 
within Anacardiaceae in classifications (for floral structure, 
see Bachelier and Endress 2007, 2009). 
DNA data provided strong support for a broadly de- 
fined Sapindaceae that include Hippocastanaceae and Ace- 
raceae, a definition similar to Thorne (1992a,b). Cronquist 
(1981) and Takhtajan (1987, 1997) considered Aceraceae 
and Hippocastanaceae to be closely related to Sapindaceae. 
Judd et al. (1994, 1999, 2002, 2008) similarly provided 
morphological support for a broadly defined Sapinda- 
ceae. Non-DNA characters uniting Aceraceae and Hip- 
pocastanaceae with Sapindaceae include the production 
of triterpenoid saponins in secretory cells, cyclopropane 
amino acids, usually eight stamens, pubescent or papillose 
filaments, ovules that lack a funiculus and are broadly at- 
tached to a protruding portion of the placenta (the obtura- 
tor), the presence of a nectar disc, and an embryo with the 
radicle separated from the rest of the embryo by a deep 
fold or pocket in the seed coat. Hypoglycin, an unusual 
amino acid, may be another synapomorphy for the clade 
(Gadek et al. 1996). Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae are 
temperate specializations within Sapindaceae, a family 
with temperate and tropical members. Phylogenetic rela- - 
tionships within a broadly defined Sapindaceae have also 
been investigated, and Xanthoceras is sister to the rest of 
the family and is diagnosed by its large petals, nectar disk 
with five horn-like appendages, and seven or eight ovules 
per locule (Savolainen et al. 2000a; Harrington et al. 2005; 
Harrington and Gadek 2009, 2010). 
Picramnia and Alvaradoa were usually included within 
Simaroubaceae, but phylogenetic studies indicated a place- 
ment of these two genera well removed from Sapindales 
(Savolainen et al. 2000b; Soltis et al. 2011). These taxa are 
now known to constitute a distinct lineage (Picramniaceae; 
Picramniales; see above). Savolainen et al. (2000b) initially 
reported that Lissocarpa (Lissocarpaceae) falls within Ru- 
taceae. However, the sequence was obtained from degraded 
herbarium DNA; further study indicated that Lissocarpa is 
sister to Diospyros (Ebenaceae), as expected based on mor- 
phology (Berry et al. 2001). APG II (2003), APG III (2009), 
and APG IV (2016) included Lissocarpa in Ebenaceae. 
Sapindales may have began to diversify in the latest 
Cretaceous as suggested by the occurrence of samaras that 
conform to Acer from North Dakota (Fig. 10.21e), but the 
record is better documented for representatives of most 
families in the early Cenozoic. Crown group Sapindalean 
families are commonly represented in the Early Eocene, 
including members of Anacardiaceae (e.g., Rhus, Anacar- 

dium, Choerospondias), Burseraceae, Sapindfceae 
(e.g., 
Aesculus, Acer, Dipteronia, Koelreuteria), Meliaceae, Sima- 
roubaceae (e.g., Ailanthus, Chaneya) (summarized in Friis 
et al. 2011) (see Fig. 10.21e,f for fossils of Sapindaceae). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
IN SAPINDALES 
Several studies have provided new insights into the bioge- 
ography of families of Sapindales. Simaroubaceae are pan- 
tropical with taxa distributed in each of the Neotropics, 
tropical Africa and tropical Asia and Australia. 
A number 
of families have a similar distribution (e.g., Melastomata- 
ceae, Malpighiaceae, Meliaceae, Burseraceae, Moraceae), 
but detailed studies of such families to explore hypotheses 
of intercontinental migration are few. Clayton et al. (2009) 
reconstructed a North American origin for Simaroubaceae, 
with migration via Beringia by ancestral taxa. In contrast 
to traditional views, long-distance dispersal events were 
found to be common in the family, particularly in the Late 
Oligocene and later. Notable dispersals are inferred to have 
occurred across the Atlantic Ocean in both directions, as 
well as between Africa and Asia, and around the Indian 
Ocean basin and Pacific islands (Clayton et al. 2009). 
HUERTEALES 
Huerteales comprise four little known families: Gerrar- 
dinaceae + Petenaeaceae are sister to Tapisciaceae + Di- 
pentodontaceae. D. Soltis et al. (2000) first placed Tapiscia 
(Tapisciaceae) in eurosid II (malvids) with strong support, 
but Tapiscia was the only representative included of what 
would ultimately be named Huerteales. In Soltis et al. 
(2011) Dipentodon (Dipentodontaceae) appeared as sis- 
ter to Tapiscia. The growing support for a clade of three 
families (Dipentodontaceae, Tapisciaceae, Gerrardinaceae) 
in multigene analyses led to the recognition of Huerteales 
(APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). More recently, Petenaea 
was found to be related to Gerrardina (Christenhusz et al. 
2010). Worberg et al. (2009) and Christenhusz et al. (2010) 
recovered, albeit with weak support, the topology shown 
here (Fig. 10.24) of Gerrardinaceae + Petenaeaceae as sister 
to Tapisciaceae + Dipentodontaceae. 
These are all small, little-known genera, sometimes pre- 
viously recognized as families that had not been consid- 
ered closely related. Dipentodontaceae comprises two gen- 
era and 16 species. Tapisciaceae consists of Tapiscia and 
Huertea and five species. Gerrardinaceae comprises one 
genus and two species. Peteneaceae consists of one species, 
Petenaea cordata. Perrottetia (Dipentodontaceae) had been 
placed in Celaastraceae; Dipentodon was placed in Santala- 
Superrosids 
237 
les (Cronquist 1981); Gerrardina was previously placed in 
the problematic Flacourtiaceae (see discussion in Malpighi- 
ales). Petenaea cordata was first described in Eleocarpaceae 
and later placed in Tiliaceae. Tapiscia and Huertea were 
traditionally placed in or near Staphyleaceae. Cronquist 
(1981) considered them to represent a distinct subfamily 
within Staphyleaceae, following Pax (1893). Spongberg 
(1971) suggested the separation of these two genera into 
their own family, Tapisciaceae. Takhtajan (1980, 1997) 
similarly recognized Tapisciaceae, considering it closely al- 
lied to Staphyleaceae. Thus, the placement of Tapisciaceae 
and Huerteaceae with Brassicales, Sapindales, and Mal- 
vales, rather than near Staphyleaceae in Crossosomatales, 
is another unexpected result of phylogenetic analyses, as 
would the close relationship suggested by DNA results for 
all four families of Huerteales. 
Athough Tapiscia is limited to two species in China 
today, it was present in the Eocene of Oregon, England, 
and Germany, 
as determined by its distinctive 
seeds 
(Fig. 10.21h; Manchester 1988; Collinson et al. 2012). 
BRASSICALES 
Molecular studies revealed a strongly supported Bras- 
sicales of 17 families (Fig. 10.24): Akaniaceae (includ- 
ing Bretschneideraceae), Batidaceae (= Bataceae), Bras- 
sicaceae, Capparaceae, Caricaceae, Cleomaceae (APG II 
2003 included both Capparaceae and Cleomaceae in Bras- 
sicaceae; this was changed in APG III 2009 and APG IV 
2016) Emblingiaceae, Gyrostemonaceae, Koeberliniaceae, 
Limnanthaceae, Moringaceae, Pentadiplandraceae, Rese- 
_daceae, 
Salvadoraceae, 
Setchellanthaceae, 
Tovariaceae, 
and Tropaeolaceae (some of these families are illustrated 
in Fig. 10.26). Borthwickiaceae (one species, B. trifoliata, 
from China) were recently described and added to Bras- 
sicales (H. Su et al. 2012), although APG IV (2016) include 
in Resedaceae (see below). 
Brassicales include all families that produce mustard-oil 
glucosides (also called glucosinolates), except for Putran- 
jivaceae of Malpighiales (Rodman 1991a,b; Gadek et al. 
1992; Rodman et al. 1993, 1998). Thus, glucosinolate 
production represents a non-DNA synapomorphy for the 
Brassicales clade (as is the indeterminate inflorescence) and 
is a feature that evolved only twice in the angiosperms (see 
below). Morphology-based classifications placed mem- 
bers of Brassicales in many different orders (e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981, 1988; Takhtajan 1987, 1997; Thorne 1992a,b, 
2001). However, Dahlgren (1975, 1977) challenged tradi- 
tional approaches to the classification of these taxa and 
placed in his Capparales nearly all plant families producing 
glucosinolates. He later backed off from this “radical” clas- 
sification (Dahlgren 1980, 1983) and, like other authors,

emphasized the striking morphological differefices among 
these families. 
The concept 
of a broadly defined “glucosinolate” 
clade (sensu Dahlgren 1975) reemerged after Rodman’s 
(1991a,b) phenetic and cladistic analyses of morphologi- 
cal and phytochemical characters. A similar glucosinolate- 
producing clade (now termed Brassicales rather than Cap- 
parales) was recovered in early DNA analyses (Gadek et al. 
1992; Chase et al. 1993; Rodman et al. 1993, 1994; Soltis 
et al. 1997a,b). Strong support ultimately emerged for this 
clade and for relationships within it (Rodman et al. 1998; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000). Drypetes (Putranjivaceae), another 
glucosinolate-producing taxon, is not part of Brassicales, 
but instead is part of the well-supported Malpighiales. 
The framework detected within Brassicales by Rodman 
et al. (1998) has been largely supported with several modi- 
fications and the inclusion of additional taxa (e.g., Emblin- 
gia, Ronse De Craene and Haston 2006): (1) Tropaeolaceae 
+ Akaniaceae (including Bretschneideraceae) are sister to 
the remainder of the family; (2) Moringaceae + Caricaceae 
are then sister to the rest of the order; (3) following a grade 
of Setchellanthaceae and then Limnanthaceae, a clade of 
(Koeberliniaceae + (Batidaceae + Salvadoraceae)), followed 
by Emblingiaceae emerged as subsequent sisters to the re- 
mainder of the order. Relationships among the remaining 
taxa are problematic. Resedaceae + Gyrostemonaceae form 
a clade, as do Capparidaceae + (Cleomaceae + Brassica- 
ceae); the placement of Pentadiplandraceae and Tovaria- 
ceae is uncertain (Fig. 10.24). Adding to the complexity is 
the recent suggestion of a new family, Borthwickiaceae, re- 
lated to Resedaceae (see below). 
The taxonomic history of the single species of Emblingia 
(E. calceoliflora), endemic to Australia, has been complex. It 
was originally placed in Capparaceae based on the presence 
of an androgynophore, a structure also seen in Brassicaceae, 
Capparacaeae, Cleomaceae, and Resedaceae. However, pol- 
len morphology and floral features suggested a relationship 
with either Polygalaceae or Sapindaceae, respectively. Leaf 
and stem anatomy supported a relationship to the aste- 
rid family Goodeniaceae (Erdtman et al. 1969; reviewed 
in Chandler and Bayer 2000). Based on rbcL sequences 
Chandler and Bayer (2000) suggested that Emblingia 
(Emblingiaceae) belonged in Brassicales near Resedaceae. 
The rbcL sequence obtained for Emblingia by Savolainen 
et al. (2000b), using different material, resulted in a place- 
ment within Gentianales (asterid clade)—this sequence is 
problematic. Ronse De Craene and Haston (2006), using 
DNA + morphology, also placed Emblingia within Brassi- 
cales. Glucosinolates have now been confirmed in Emblin- 
gia (Mithen et al. 2010); the genus has other Brassicales 
features including curved embryos, scanty endosperm, and 
some floral whorls that are tetramerous, whereas others are 
Superrosids 
239 
pentamerous (it has two petals and four stamens, but five 
sepals) (Takhtajan 1997; Chandler and Bayer 2000). 
H. Su et al. (2012) found that Borthwickia as well as 
Stixis, Tirania, and Forchhammeria, genera typically placed 
in Cleomeaceae, did not appear in that family in their 
analyses. Borthwickia appeared as sister to Resedaceae, 
Stixis, Tirania, and Forchhammeria. H. Su et al. (2012) 
placed Borthwickia in a new family (Borthwickiaceae), 
but one could also argue that it, as well as Stixis, Tirania, 
and Forchhammeria, could all be included in an expanded 
Resedaceae, as done in APG IV (2016; see Chapter 12). 
Olson (2002a,b) analyzed relationships among the 
13 species of Moringa, the only genus in Moringaceae. 
Brassicaceae were expanded to include Capparaceae in the 
initial APG (1998) and APG II (2003) classifications be- 
cause Capparaceae, long considered the closest relative of 
Brassicaceae, appeared paraphyletic relative to Brassicaceae 
(Judd et al. 1994). A broadly defined Brassicaceae includ- 
ing Capparaceae are also indicated by non-DNA characters 
such as a long gynophore, vacuolar or utricular cisternae of 
the endoplasmic reticulum, a similar method of glucosino- 
late production involving synthesis from methionine via 
long chain-extensions, and the presence of sinapine (Rod- 
man 1991a,b; Judd et al. 1994, 1999). However, J. Hall 
et al. (2002) found evidence for three well-supported, pri- 
mary clades within Brassicaceae s.|.: (1) Capparaceae sub- 
family Capparoideae; (2) Capparaceae subfamily Cleomoi- 
deae; and (3) Brassicaceae s.s. These authors suggested that 
three families be recognized corresponding to each of these 
clades: Capparaceae, Cleomaceae, and Brassicaceae. Cap- 
paraceae typically have fleshy fruits whereas the fruits of 
Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae are typically dry. Cleomaceae 
possess bracteate inflorescences as a synapomorphy; Bras- 
sicaceae have a false-septum and six stamens (4 long and 
2 short) (J. Hall et al. 2002) (six stamens also are present 
in many Cleomaceae). Capparaceae are sister to Cleoma- 
ceae + Brassicaceae (see Fay and Christenhusz 2010; H. Su 
et al. 2012). 
It now appears that Cleomaceae consist of just Cleome, 
which some authors have divided into two to several genera 
(Hall 2008; Inda et al. 2008; Riser et al. 2013). Enormous 
progress has been made in understanding relationships in 
the large family Brassicaceae (e.g., Koch et al. 2001, 2003; 
Al-Shehbaz et al. 2006; Bailey et al. 2006; Beilstein et al. 
2006, 2008; Franzke et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2010; Al- 
Shehbaz 2012). 
Numerous complete nuclear genome sequences 
are 
available for Brassicaceae (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana, A. 
lyrata, Brassica rapa, Capsella rubella, Eutrema oparvu- 
lum, Sisymbrium irio) given the economic importance of 
the family, as well as the importance of some members 
as genetic models (e.g., species of Arabidopsis and Bras- 

240 Chapter 10 
sica; e.g., Wang et al. 2006; Gaeta et al. 2009; Ng et al. 
2012). The importance of understanding the phylogenetic 
relationships of these organisms has been repeatedly em- 
phasized (see Chapter 3; see also D. Soltis and Soltis 2000, 
2003; Franzke et al. 2009). Recent studies have attempted 
to date the origin of Arabidopsis thaliana (Beilstein et al. 
2010) and provide other age estimates in Brassicaceae 
(Franzke et al. 2009). Phylogenetic inferences for Brassi- 
caceae and relatives allow the Arabidopsis model of floral 
development and genomics to be extended to encompass 
more diversity in Brassicales as well as other angiosperms 
(e.g., Mitchell-Olds and Clauss 2002; Schranz et al. 2007; 
see chapters in D. Soltis et al. 2006). Within Brassicaceae, 
phylogenetic studies have provided a general framework 
of generic relationships and elucidated the closest rela- 
tives of Arabidopsis (e.g., Koch et al. 1999, 2001, 2003; 
Koch 2003; O’Kane and Al-Shehbaz 2003; Franzke et al. 
2009). 
The fossil record of Brassicales is poor, but winged fruits 
of Thlaspi from the Oligocene of Montana have been use- 
ful for inferring the age of Arabidopsis (Beilstein et al. 
2010). The well-preserved bicarpellate flower, Dressiantha, 
from the Late Cretaceous (Turonian) of New Jersey, USA 
provides a suite of features compatible with a placement 
as sister group to all Brassicales except Gyrostemonaceae 
(Gandolfo et al. 1998a), but this placement has been ques- 
tioned in view of a subsequent analysis placing it within 
Sapindales (Ronse De Craene and Haston 2006). 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
IN BRASSICALES 
Core Brassicales (e.g., Koeberliniaceae, Batidaceae, Salva- 
doraceae, Pentadiplandraceae, Tovariaceae, Emblingiaceae, 
Gyrostemonaceae, Resedaceae, and Brassicaceae) 
share 
several features typically associated with Brassicaceae, such 
as tetramerous flowers (Table 10.2), seeds with curved or 
folded embryos and campylotropous ovules, endosperm 
lacking or nearly absent, vessels with vestured pits, and 
protein-rich, vascular or utricular cisternae of the endo- 
plasmic reticulum (see Rodman 1991a,b; Judd et al. 1999, 
2008). There are important exceptions, however. Pentadip- 
landraceae and Emblingiaceae have perianth parts in five 
(the latter having two petals and five sepals); Resedaceae 
and Tovariaceae have six- to eight-merous flowers; Salva- 
doraceae have a straight rather than curved embryo; both 
Gyrostemonaceae and Pentadiplandraceae also have non- 
vestured pits. Other families illustrate the difficulty of some 
character codings; in Batidaceae, the embryo is reported to 
be “slightly curved,” not fitting neatly into the categories of 
“straight” or “curved.”

Character states generally follow Cronquist (1981) and Takhtajan (1997). 
’Reports for the number of sepals and petals vary. Some reports indicate that 
there are five sepals and two petals (reviewed in Chandler and Bayer 2000). 
“Variously considered 4- or 6-merous. 
To examine character evolution in Brassicales, we up- 
dated our dataset (Soltis et al. 2005b) and conducted new 
character-state reconstructions using Mesquite (Maddison 
and Maddison 2011) and the characters and character 
states of Rodman (1991b), with modifications (sensu Cron- 
quist 1981; Takhtajan 1997) for some characters, such as 
sepal and petal merism and embryo curvature used in Soltis 
et al. (2005b). The topology we used is based on Soltis et al. 
(2011) and Stevens (2014). 
We found that some features associated with Brassi- 
caceae, such as embryo morphology, actually evolved in 
the common ancestor of Brassicaceae and its close rela- 
tives. A curved embryo apparently evolved twice in Bras- 
sicales (Fig. 10.27A), once in Bretschneidera (Akaniaceae) 
and again in the common ancestor of Setchellanthaceae, 
Koeberliniaceae, Batidaceae, Salvadoraceae, Pentadipland- 
raceae, 
Tovariaceae, 
Emblingiaceae, 
Gyrostemonaceae, 
Resedaceae, Capparidaceae, Cleomeaceae, and Brassica- 
ceae; this feature was lost in Salvadoraceae. 
Perianth evolution in Brassicales is similar to the pattern 
of embryo diversification. A pentamerous perianth appears

ancestral in Brassicales with a tetramerous perianth evolv- 
ing in the common ancestor of Setchellanthaceae, Koeber- 
liniaceae, Batidaceae, Salvadoraceae, and other taxa above 
these nodes (Fig. 10.27B). A reversal to a pentamerous 
perianth occurred in Pentadiplandraceae and Emblingia- 
ceae. However, the coding of perianth merism is not always 
straightforward. Emblingia has five sepals and two petals. 
Similarly, although Resedaceae were scored here as tetram- 
erous, the number of sepals and petals each range from 
four to eight; the family has been considered hexamerous 
by some (e.g., Cronquist 1981). This part of the topology 
is further complicated by the recent placements of Borth- 
wickia, Stixis, Tirania, and Forchbammeria (H. Su et al. 
2012), which we did not consider. 
Mustard-oil glucosides (Ettlinger and Kjaer 1968) are 
oxime-derived 
sulfur-containing compounds 
for which 
breakdown products include the familiar pungent prin- 
ciples of mustard, radish, and capers. The compounds are 
usually accompanied in the plant by a hydrolytic enzyme, 
myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase, E.C. 3.2.3.1), 
which may be compartmentalized in special myrosin cells 
(reviewed in Rodman et al. 1998). This “mustard oil bomb” 
may deter herbivores and pathogens (Liithy and Matile 
1984). These compounds are costly to produce, perhaps 
increasing photosynthesis requirements by 15% (Bekaert 
et al. 2012). 
The 
phytochemical 
system 
of glucosinolates 
with 
myrosinase enzyme, the latter in special myrosin cells, 
evolved twice, once in the ancestor of Brassicales and 
again, independently, in Drypetes (Putranjivaceae; Malpi- 
ghiales; Fig. 10.27c). Drypetes is a large pantropical ge- 
nus (~150 species); the few species screened for mustard- 
oil glucosides have yielded positive results (Ettlinger and 
Kjaer 1968). Additional species of Drypetes, as well as the 
related genus Putranjiva, should be analyzed for glucosino- 
lates. Ultrastructural studies of Drypetes revealed protein- 
accumulating phloem cells similar to developing myrosin 
cells, although tests for ascorbate-activated myrosinase en- 
zymes proved negative (reviewed in Rodman et al. 1998). 
However, no studies have been reported on the enzymology 
of mustard-oil glucoside biosynthesis in Drypetes; in con- 
trast, several members of the Brassicales have been ana- 
lyzed in detail (Du et al. 1995). The available data indicate 
that glucosinolate biosynthesis and myrosin cell formation 
in Drypetes are remarkably similar to those in Brassicales. 
Within Brassicales, 14 families are known to produce 
glucosinolates; only Koeberlinia does not produce these 
compounds (Mithen et al. 2010). The deeply embedded 
position of Koeberlinia within Brassicales indicates that it 
has lost critical gene functions or otherwise repressed the 
capacity to synthesize glucosinolates (Fig. 10.27C). Signifi- 
cantly, Koeberlinia possesses myrosin cells (Gibson 1979), 
which is consistent with this hypothesis of glucosinolate 
loss or repression (Rodman et al. 1993, 1998). Also, Koe- 
berlinia is thorny, with small, deciduous leaves, so physical 
means of protection may have been associated with the loss 
of glucosinolate production. 
Two evolutionary origins of glucosinolate production 
poses an intriguing question. What biochemical pathway 
was modified for glucosinolate production and is it the 
same pathway in both Drypetes and Brassicales? Kjaer 
(1973) and Harborne (1982) stressed the similarities in bio- 
synthesis between mustard-oil glucosides and cyanogenic 
glycosides. The latter are cyanide-releasing compounds 
widespread in the angiosperms. Kjaer (1973) suggested 
that glucosinolate biosynthesis evolved via the recruitment 
and modification of cyanogen biosynthesis. Both gluco- 
sinolates and cyanogenic glucosides are groups of natural 
plant products derived from amino acids and have oximes 
as intermediates. It is noteworthy that Brassicales are in 
a clade with both Malvales and Sapindales, lineages with 
cyanogenic taxa. Similarly, Drypetes is part of Malpighia- 
les, which also contain cyanogenic taxa (e.g., Euphorbia, 
Passiflora, and Violaceae). 
Hansen 
et al. (2001a,b) showed 
that cytochromes 
P450 (belonging to the CYP79 family) are involved in ox- 
ime formation in the biosynthetic pathway of both cya- 
nogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. This is consistent 
with the hypothesis that glucosinolate production evolved 
| 
from the cyanogenic glucoside pathway and indicates that 
the oxime-metabolizing enzyme is a possible branch point 
between the cyanogenic glucoside and glucosinolate path- 
way (Hansen et al. 2001a,b). Progress has been made in 
elucidating the biosynthetic pathway of glucosinolates (re- 
viewed in Mithen et al. 2010; see Halkier and Gershen- 
zon 2006). Mithen et al. (2010, p. 2074) reported on the 
possible evolutionary origin of glucosinolate biosynthesis 
in Brassicales from cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis, not- 
ing that glucosinolate biosynthesis “is associated with di- 
version of the aldoxime away from cyanogenic glycosides 
biosynthesis through the activity of a mutated CYP83-like 
enzyme. This is followed by subsequent detoxification of 
the reactive product through sulphation and glycosylation 
to produce glucosinolates.” 
MALVALES 
Malvales consist of (Fig. 10.24) Bixaceae (including Co- 
chlospermaceae 
and Diegodendraceae), 
Cistaceae, 
the 
parasitic Cytinaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Malvaceae (includ- 
ing Bombacaceae, Tiliaceae, and Sterculiaceae), Muntin- 
giaceae, Neuradaceae, Sarcolaenaceae, Sphaerosepalaceae, 
and Thymelaeaceae 
(several families are illustrated 
in 
Fig. 10.26). Thymelaeaceae were expanded (APG II 2003) 

to include the enigmatic Tepuianthus, a genuséof five spe- 
cies from Venezuela and Colombia that had been placed 
in Celastraceae, but transferred to its own family (Cron- 
quist 1981). Takhtajan (1997) considered Tepuianthaceae 
closely related to Simaroubaceae. However, DNA studies 
revealed that Tepuianthus was the well-supported sister to 
other Thymelaeaceae (Savolainen et al. 2000b; Wurdack 
and Horn 2001). Several phylogenetic studies have focused 
on Malvales, and the topology shown here is in agreement 
with the results of Alverson et al. (1998), Bayer et al. (1998, 
1999), Dayanandan et al. (1999), and van der Bank et al. 
(2002). 
Cronquist (1981) restricted Malvales to Bombacaceae, 
Tiliaceae, Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae. 
However, others included additional families such as Bix- 
aceae, 
Cistaceae, 
Cochlospermaceae, 
Diegodendraceae, 
Dipterocarpaceae, Dirachmaceae, Huaceae, Peridiscaceae, 
Plagiopteridaceae, Sarcolaenaceae, Sphaerosepalaceae, and 
Thymelaeaceae (Dahlgren 1983; Thorne 1992a,b; Huber 
1993; Takhtajan 1997). 
A suite of morphological and other nonmolecular char- 
acters unites the Malvales clade, although in most cases, 
only one or a few representatives of a family have been 
examined for these characters, so it is not known if excep- 
tions to the occurrence of these features exist. With this 
caveat, potential synapomorphies for Malvales include the 
presence of cyclopropenoid fatty acids in the seeds, com- 
plex chalazal anatomy, mucilage (slime) canals, vestured 
pits, dilated phloem rays, and simple perforations in the 
secondary xylem (Metcalfe and Chalk 1950; Nandi et al. 
1998). Mucilage cells or mucilage cavities (Metcalfe and 
Chalk 1950; Cronquist 1981) appears to be another syn- 
apomorphy. All taxa for which the character is known (all 
but Sarcolaenaceae and Sphaerosepalaceae) are also char- 
acterized by centrifugal polyandry, or rarely, as in Thyme- 
laeaceae, lateral polyandry (e.g., Cronquist 1981, 1988; 
Ronse De Craene and Smets 1992; Nandi 1998b; Nandi 
et al. 1998; von Balthazar et al. 2004). Malvales have the 
exotegmen differentiated as a palisade layer (Corner 1976; 
Nandi 1998a); this seed feature occurs only rarely outside 
of Malvales (e.g., in Trochodendraceae, Huaceae, and some 
Euphorbiaceae; Nandi et al. 1998). Most Malvales (except 
Thymelaeaceae) possess a stratified phloem (Metcalfe and 
Chalk 1950), another feature that is uncommon outside 
of the order (Nandi et al. 1998). Other characters com- 
mon in Malvales, but also found outside the clade, include 
stellate hairs, peltate scales, strong phloem fibers, valvate 
sepals, and an epicalyx (see Alverson et al. 1998; Nandi 
et al. 1998). 
Of those families previously placed in Malvales but now 
excluded by phylogenetic evidence, Elaeocarpaceae (now 
placed in Oxalidales) are the most notable because they 
Superrosids 
243 
were frequently associated with families now considered to 
be the single family Malvaceae (see Cronquist 1981). How- 
ever, Elaeocarpaceae lack most of the putative nonmolecu- 
lar synapomorphies of Malvales as now circumscribed. For 
example, Elaeocarpaceae lack fatty acids, stellate hairs, pel- 
tate trichomes, and mucilage cavities; they have unstratified 
phloem, opposite lateral pitting of the vessels, and a fibrous 
exotegmen (Takhtajan 1997). Soltis et al. (2011) provided 
strong support for some subclades but some families of 
Malvales were not sampled (Muntingiaceae, Cytinaceae, 
Sphaerosepalaceae). Stevens (2013) represents much of the 
“backbone” as a polytomy, which may be the best, most 
conservative assessment. 
Neuradaceae typically emerge as sister to the remainder 
of the clade followed by Thymelaeaceae (Alverson et al. 
1998; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; H. Wang et al. 2009). 
These placements had maximal support in H. Wang et al. 
(2009), but overall sampling of Malvales was modest. Neu- 
radaceae were often included in or considered a close rela- 
tive of Rosaceae in previous treatments (Cronquist 1981). 
However, the family shares two potential synapomorphies 
with the expanded Malvales, an exotegmic seed coat with 
a palisade layer and cyclopropenoid fatty acids (Huber 
1993). Neuradaceae also possess valvate sepals, lysigenous 
mucilage canals, stellate hairs, and an epicalyx. 
Following Neuradaceae and Thymelaeaceae, relation- 
ships become problematic in Malvales—it remains one of 
the more poorly understood rosid subclades. Several early 
analyses supported a clade of Bixaceae, Diegodendraceae, 
and Cochlospermaceae (Alverson et al. 1998; Bayer et al. 
1998; Fay et al. 1998a); the last two families have now 
been included in Bixaceae (see APG II 2003, APG III 2009; 
APG IV 2016). 
Muntingiaceae may be sister to the parasitic Cytinaceae 
(Nickrent 2007). Cytinaceae comprise two genera, Cytinus 
and Bdallophytum, that were formerly placed in the family 
Rafflesiaceae (now Malpighiales), but molecular data in- 
dicated a placement in Malvales. Neotropical Muntingia- 
ceae are poorly known. Muntingia is noteworthy in that 
the genus had historically been placed in Elaeocarpaceae, 
Tiliaceae, or Flacourtiaceae (see Cronquist 1981; Takhta- 
jan 1997), but molecular results clearly indicate that it, 
and the related genus Dicraspidia, form a distinct lineage 
of Malvales (Bayer et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 2000b). 
Bayer et al. (1998) recognized these two genera as a new 
family, Muntingiaceae (stating that it may also include 
Neotessmannia). 
Although some early studies suggested that Diptero- 
carpaceae are not monophyletic (Dayanandan et al. 1999; 
Savolainen et al. 2000b), Cistaceae and then Sarcolaenaceae 
are subsequent (and well-supported) sisters to a monophy- 
letic Dipterocarpaceae (Soltis et al. 2011), although inclu-

sion of Monotes and Pakaraimaea (representatives of the 
other two subfamilies of Dipterocarpaceae) may change 
this result. 
A broadly defined Malvaceae received strong support 
in molecular analyses (Alverson et al. 1998, 1999; Bayer 
et al. 1999; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 
2011). In addition to the traditionally recognized Malva- 
ceae, Malvaceae now include former members of Bomba- 
caceae, Sterculiaceae, and Tiliaceae (Judd and Manchester 
1997; Bayer et al. 1999). A close relationship among these 
four families has been recognized since Linnaeus, although 
relationships among them have long been problematic. 
Analyses of DNA sequences and non-DNA characters 
demonstrated the polyphyly of both Sterculiaceae and Tili- 
aceae, as well as the paraphyly of Bombacaceae, and indi- 
cated that these four families should be merged into one 
family: Malvaceae (Judd and Manchester 1997; Bayer et al. 
1999; see also Judd et al. 1999, 2002, 2008). Theobroma of 
Sterculiaceae received strong support as sister to Grewia of 
Tiliaceae, and Durio and its close relatives in Bombacaceae 
were found to be more closely related to some members of 
Sterculiaceae than to other Bombacaceae. Several genera 
treated as Bombacaceae and other genera treated as Ster- 
culiaceae emerged as sister to traditional Malvaceae. These 
interdigitating relationships among genera assigned to dif- 
ferent families in traditional classifications (all recognizing 
(C) 
(D) 
four families) indicated that a broadly defined Malvaceae is 
required (Judd and Manchester 1997; Alverson et al. 1999; 
_ 
Bayer et al. 1999). 
Likely synapomorphies for a broad Malvaceae include 
distinctive nectaries composed of tightly packed, multicel- 
lular hairs, normally found on the adaxial surface of the se- 
pals (Judd and Manchester 1997; Vogel 2000) and the dis- 
tinctive upright “tile” cells in wood rays (Manchester and 
Miller 1978; Fig. 10.28). In addition, the inflorescences of 
all members of a broadly defined Malvaceae are composed 
of special modules called “bicolor units” (Fig. 10.28B—D; 
Bayer and Kubitzki 1996). In contrast, there are no clear 
synapomorphies for Malvaceae s.s. 
Malvaceae are readily identified in the late Cretaceous 
and younger fossil record. Distinctive bombacoid pollen 
and tilioid/sterculioid wood can be traced to the Maast- 
richtian of the late Cretaceous (Wolfe 1975; Wheeler et al. 
1994). Malvaceous flowers, fruits, seeds and pollen are 
common from Cenozoic deposits (e.g., the extinct flower 
known as Florissantia from the Eocene of western North 
America and eastern Asia (Fig. 10.21j-l; Manchester 1992, 
1999). Craigia, a genus closely related to Tilia, that survives 
only in southern China today, is known from Eocene and 
younger deposits of North America, and Asia, and from 
Oligocene and younger deposits in Europe (Kvaéek et al. 
2005). Tilia itself is recognizable on the basis of distinctive

Evolution of non-dithecate (monothecate and non-thecal) anthers in Malvaceae. The topology shown is modified from the strict consensus of short- 
est trees of Alverson et al. (1998). To make the topology easier to visualize, some genera have been removed without altering the genera! pattern of relationships. 
Additional genera were added to tribe Durioneae, which contains Neesia, Coelostegia, Kostermansia, Cullenia, Boschia, and Durio; the relationships depicted among 
members of Durioneae (genera are indicated in bold) follow Nyffeler and Baum (2000). The phylogeny indicates that non-dithecate anthers evolved twice: once in 
a clade of several genera of Durioneae (see E, F, D) and again in a clade that largely corresponds to Malvaceae in the traditional or narrow sense (G). Floral structure 
and pollinators are indicated for members of Durioneae. Within this tribe, the molecular phylogeny suggests that beetle pollination was ancestral in the tribe, with 
subsequent evolution of bat and bird pollination. Furthermore, the transition to bat and bird pollination was accompanied by extensive changes in the androecium. 
The early-branching genera Neesia, Coelostegia, and Kostermansia all have dithecate, tetrasporangiate anthers. However, in Cullenia, Boschia, and Durio, the anthers 
are highly modified (D, E, F). Flowers and stamens of Durioneae (A-F; modified from Nyffeler and Baum 2000). (A) Neesia glabra: (a) flower at anthesis; (b) longitu-

CHARACTER EVOLUTION IN MALVALES 
Malvaceae have experienced many gains and losses of di- 
verse characters, including staminal tubes, palmately com- 
pound leaves, spiny pollen, winged seeds or fruits, and non- 
dithecate anthers. Considering the last feature, it has long 
been assumed that monothecate anthers (sometimes non- 
thecate or “half-anthers”) were a derived character uniting 
Malvaceae and Bombacaceae (Cronquist 1981, 1988; Judd 
et al. 1994; Judd and Manchester 1997). However, DNA- 
based trees indicated instead that monothecate anthers 
have been derived at least twice independently (Fig. 10.29): 
once in core Malvaceae (“Malvoideae” of Alverson et al. 
1999) and again in members of tribe Durioneae of former 
Bombacaceae (“Helicteroideae” of Alverson et al. 1999). 
Furthermore, in Helicteroideae, modifications in the an- 
droecium may be related to pollinator syndromes. Helicter- 
oideae contain Neesia, Coelostegia, Kostermansia, Culle- 
nia, Boschia, and Durio (the durians). Molecular results 
indicate that beetle pollination is ancestral in the tribe, with 
subsequent evolution of bat and bird pollination. Further- 
more, the transition to bat and bird pollination was accom- 
panied by extensive changes in the androecium. The genera 
attached to the basalmost nodes, Neesia, Coelostegia, and 
Kostermansia, all have dithecate, tetrasporangiate anthers, 
the typical condition in angiosperms, and their flowers are 
beetle-pollinated. However, in Cullenia, Boschia, and Du- 
rio, the anthers are non-dithecate, and the flowers are pol- 
linated primarily by birds and bats (Alverson et al. 1999; 
Nyffeler and Baum 2000). 
A molecular study provided similar insights regarding 
floral evolution and pollinators in the famous baobabs 
(Adansonia) (Baum et al. 1998). In Adansonia, character- 
state mapping using a molecular tree indicated that hawk- 
moth pollination is ancestral in the genus and that there 
were two independent switches to pollination by fruit bats 
(Baum et al. 1998). Flowers in the two clades with bat pol- 
lination differ greatly in morphology. 
PARASITISM IN ROSIDS 
Recent phylogenetic analyses have now revealed the place- 
ment of many parasitic plants that initially were prob- 
lematic. The reasons for these difficulties are several, but 
generally involve the fact that these plants have degenerate 
plastid genomes. As a result, plastid genes, which have been 
so widely used to infer angiosperm phylogeny, are absent 
or have accelerated evolutionary rates (e.g., Nickrent et al. 
1998; www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/). However, these para- 
sitic taxa can be placed using nuclear genes, or mitochon- 
drial DNA sequences. Sequence data have indicated that 
several groups of parasitic plants are nested within the as- 
terids (e.g., Mitrastemonaceae, Orobanchaceae, Cuscuta; 
see Chapter 11). As reviewed here, several other lineages of 
parasitic plants that have been particularly difficult to place 
using morphological data now appear to be nested within 
the rosids. Barkman et al. (2004) found evidence for the 
placement of Rafflesia and Rhizanthes (Rafflesiaceae) with 
Malpighiales, most likely close to or derived from within 
Euphorbiaceae (Davis et al. 2007). These genera of Raffle- 
siaceae lack leaves, stems, and roots and rely entirely on the 
host plants for nutrients (see Chapter 13); the genus Raffle- 
sia also contains the world’s largest flowers (R. arnoldii; see 
Figs. 10.20d; 10.23). 
Barkman et al. (2004) showed that Mitrastema, another 
genus sometimes placed in Rafflesiaceae, is distantly related 
. 
to Rafflesia and Rhizanthes, exhibiting a close relationship 
to Ericales in the asterid clade (see Chapter 11). Additional 
analyses suggested that Cytinaceae are embedded within 
Malvales (Barkman et al. 2007) as sister to Muntingiaceae 
(Nickrent 2007). Apodanthaceae appear to be part of Cu- 
curbitales (see Filipowicz and Renner 2010) despite earlier 
suggestions that it might be a member of Malvales (e.g., 
Nickrent 2002; Blarer et al. 2004). One caveat of these mo- 
lecular analyses is that branch lengths to the parasitic taxa 
are often long; hence, spurious attraction could be occur- 
ring. Recent molecular analyses now suggest a placement 
of Cynomoriaceae within Saxifragales, although the closest 
relatives of the family are unclear. Many of these parasitic 
lineages are discussed in more detail in Chapter 13. 

Superasterids 
INTRODUCTION 
Superasteridae (1.e., superasterids) have only recently been 
recognized based on multi-gene phylogenetic and phyloge- 
nomic analyses (Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Ruhfel et al. 2014; Fig. 11.1) and were also described for- 
mally using PhyloCode definitions (Soltis et al. 2011). This 
clade comprises Santalales, Caryophyllales, Berberidop- 
sidales, Asteridae (lamiids and campanulids), and possibly 
Dilleniaceae (see Chapters 9, 10). Higher-level relationships 
of Santalales and Caryophyllales were unresolved in previ- 
ous phylogenetic analyses (see Chapter 3). However, these 
clades were shown to be well-supported subsequent sisters 
to Berberidopsidales + asterids in Moore et al. (2008, 2011) 
using large amounts of plastid gene sequence data. Soltis 
et al. (2011), using plastid, nuclear, and mitochondrial 
data, reconstructed Santalales as sister to a (Berberidopsi- 
dales + Caryophyllales) + Asteridae clade (Fig. 11.1); Ruh- 
fel et al. (2014) found the same topology in their analysis 
of 360 plastid genomes. As reviewed in Chapters 3 and 9, 
Dilleniaceae have been variously recovered as sister to Su- 
perasteridae (Moore et al. 2011; Soltis et al. 2011), as well 
as sister to Superrosidae (Moore et al. 2010; Ruhfel et al. 
2014) and sister to a clade composed of Superrosidae and 
Superasteridae (Moore et al. 2011). The placement of Dil- 
leniaceae as sister to Superasteridae is the best supported 
(Soltis et al. 2011) but is still unstable (Ruhfel et al. 2014), 
which led Soltis et al. (2011) to only provisionally place 
Dilleniaceae within Superasteridae. Here Dilleniaceae are 
treated separately in Chapter 9. 
SANTALALES 
The composition of Santalales has differed among recent 
morphology-based classifications (Cronquist 1981; Thorne 
1992a,b, 2001; Takhtajan 1997). The order has included 
Santalaceae, Eremolepidaceae, Loranthaceae, Opiliaceae, 
Olacaceae, Misodendraceae, and Viscaceae, as well as 
Balanophoraceae, Medusandraceae, and in some cases Di- 
pentodontaceae (see Cronquist 1981). The monophyly of 
Santalales was well supported even in initial broad analyses 
of rbcL and 18S rDNA alone (Chase et al. 1993; Nick- 
rent and Soltis 1995; Soltis et al. 1997b; Chase and Albert 
1998) with 100% support in analyses of combined datasets 
(e.g., Nickrent et al. 1998; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen 
et al. 2000a; D. Soltis et al. 2000). Molecular evidence also 
indicates that families sometimes included in Santalales 
(such as Medusandraceae and Dipentodontaceae) should 
be excluded from the order (Nickrent et al. 1998; APG II 
2003). The holoparasitic Balanophoraceae were shown to 
be sister to Santalales (Nickrent et al. 2005) and nested 
within Santalales by Su and Hu (2012), albeit with limited 
taxon sampling. Balanophoraceae were subsequently in- 
cluded in Santalales by APG III (2009); however, Nickrent 
et al. (2010) did not include Balanophoraceae in their recir- 
cumscription of the order. Recent research provides new in- 
sights, with one study suggesting that Balanophoraceae s.I. 
comprise two distinct clades, which are sister groups (Su 
et al. 2015). However, a more recent analysis indicates that 
Balanophoraceae are monophyletic and perhaps nested 
within Santalaceae s.l. (Byng unpubl. data).

Phylogenetic relationships of Superasterids. 
A major contribution of early molecular phylogenetic 
studies was to circumscribe Santalales as a small order that 
consists of Santalaceae s.]. (including Eremolepidaceae and 
Viscaceae), Loranthaceae, 
Opiliaceae, “Olacaceae,” 
and 
Misodendraceae (Nickrent et al. 1998; Nickrent and Malé- 
cot 2001; APG II 2003). The APG II (2003) and APG III 
(2009) classifications included Viscaceae within Santalaceae 
to avoid recognition of paraphyletic groups. However, Nick-

rent et al. (2010) proposed a revised classification of Santala- 
les, wherein several other smaller families were recognized to 
maintain monophyletic groups, as well as to recognize tra- 
ditional and easily diagnosable families. Thus, in Nickrent 
et al. (2010), Santalaceae s.s. is recognized, as well as Vis- 
caceae and Amphorogynaceae, which maintains the mono- 
phyly of Santalaceae s.s. This work also separated the tra- 
ditional (and paraphyletic) Olacaceae into several families 
(Fig. 11.2). However, most of the backbone of the Nickrent 
et al. (2010) tree is poorly supported. As a result, APG IV 
(2016) did not make changes to the families recognized from 
what is given in APG III (2009). Santalales were inferred to 
have diverged 108-101 mya (Anderson et al. 2005). 
Santalales 
are fairly easily characterized, possessing 
several putative non-DNA synapomorphies: plants lack- 
ing root hairs, flowers with sepals reduced to a cup-like 
rim, open aestivation, and petals valvate, the stamens of- 
ten opposite the petals, ovules pendulous, fruit a drupe (or 
modified and berry-like), and seeds with small embryo. 
Most Santalales are hemiparasites (Nickrent et al. 2010; 
defined in Nickrent et al. 1998 as plants that photosynthe- 

size during part of their life cycle and obtain’fhainly water 
and dissolved minerals from their hosts), although certain 
members are holoparasites (i.e., Balanophoraceae, certain 
members of Viscaceae; see Ashworth 2000); holoparasites 
are defined as nonphotosynthetic (some holoparasites are 
discussed in the chapters on superrosids and parallel evolu- 
tion; see Chapters 10 and 13). 
Ascertaining the relationships of many parasitic plants 
has long been problematic, because evolutionary modifica- 
tions associated with the parasitic habit, such as the loss 
of leaves, perianth parts, integuments, and chlorophyll, 
may result in extreme morphologies that may be subject to 
convergence (see Nickrent et al. 1998). The relationships 
of many holoparasites remain particularly problematic, 
because the plants are nonphotosynthetic, and the plastid 
genomes of these plants are highly modified with many 
genes absent or with accelerated rates of molecular evolu- 
tion (Nickrent et al. 1998; Su and Hu 2012; see Chapters 
10 and 13). Likewise, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from 
the hosts has been shown to occur in certain parasitic taxa, 
especially of mitochondrial but also of nuclear genes (Da- 
vis and Wurdack 2004; Mower et al. 2004; Yoshida et al. 
2010) (see Chapters 3 and 16), which could lead to errone- 
ously inferred relationships in phylogenetic analyses. Nick- 
rent et al. (2005) showed that aerial hemiparasitism has 
evolved at least five times in Santalales (see Chapter 13). 
Thus, a highly specialized character is highly homoplasious 
in the clade. See also Harbaugh and Baldwin (2007) and 
Der and Nickrent (2008) for additional phylogenetic anal- 
yses in Santalales. See Fig. 11.3 for various members of the 
Santalales. 
The fossil record of this order is known mainly from 
pollen of Loranthaceae; loranthaceous pollen has distinc- 
tive triangular oblate grains that are typically concave sided 
and syncolpate, with distinctive variation in ornamentation 
and aperture configuration among genera (e.g., Feuer and 
Kuijt 1980, 1985). Investigations of dispersed fossil grains 
demonstrate that the family was widespread by the middle 
Eocene, including the early Eocene of Australia (Macphail 
et al. 2012) and middle Eocene of the Northern Hemisphere 
including West Greenland and central Europe (Zetter et al. 
2014; Manchester et al. 2015). 
BERBERIDOPSIDALES 
Berberidopsidales consist of two small families, Berberidop- 
sidaceae and Aextoxicaceae, considered distantly related in 
non-DNA classifications, but strongly supported as sister 
taxa in molecular phylogenetic investigations (Savolainen 
et al. 2000a; D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2003c; Moore et al. 2011; 
Soltis et al. 2011). Berberidopsidales was not recognized 
Superasterids 
249 
in APG II (2003) pending additional investigation but was 
recognized by APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016). Non- 
molecular synapomorphies are few, but include cyclocytic 
stomata and characteristically short filaments. 
The precise placement of Berberidopsidales within Su- 
perasteridae is unclear. Moore et al. (2011) recovered Ber- 
beridopsidales as sister to the asterid clade; Moore et al. 
(2010) and Ruhfel et al. (2014) place the order as sister to 
Caryophyllales + asterids. Soltis et al. (2011) recovered the 
order as forming a clade with Caryophyllales that was then 
sister to the asterids (Fig. 11.1). The stem age for Berberi- 
dopsidales has been dated to 113.1-112.5 mya (Magallon 
and Castillo 2009). 
Ronse De Craene (2004) suggested that the flowers of 
Berberidopsis (with 12 tepals, 8 stamens, and 3 carpels) fit 
the mold for a typical, core eudicot perianth in that the 
more typical biseriate perianth is thought to have been de- 
rived from spirally arranged tepals that subsequently dif- 
ferentiated into two whorls of perianth parts (Ronse De 
Craene 2007; Ronse De Craene and Stuppy 2010). Aex- 
toxicon, however, has well-differentiated sepals and petals 
and is more representative of a biseriate perianth (Ronse 
De Craene and Brockington 2013). Members of Berberi- 
dopsidales are shown in Fig. 11.4. 
CARYOPHYLLALES 
Since the 1980s, the name “Caryophyllales” has been ap- 
plied to an increasingly broad, and correspondingly diverse, 
set of families. Before that, the concept of Caryophyllales 
generally corresponded to that of Centrospermae (Harms 
1934), a group of families long recognized as closely re- 
lated (e.g., Braun 1864; Eichler 1875-1878). Morphologi- 
cal and embryological characters unite the core families of 
Centrospermae, but Centrospermae gained attention as one 
of the earliest groups for which circumscription was modi- 
fied based on chemical characters. The discovery that all 
but two families of Centrospermae—Caryophyllaceae and 
Molluginaceae—produce betalain pigments instead of the 
anthocyanin pigments produced in other angiosperms sup- 
ported a close relationship among the core group of fami- 
lies. Furthermore, Cactaceae and Didiereaceae, not previ- 
ously considered closely related to Centrospermae, were 
also discovered to produce betalains. Revised non-DNA- 
based classifications (e.g., Dahlgren 1975, 1980; Takhtajan 
1980; Cronquist 1981; Thorne 1983, 1992a,b), applying 
the name Caryophyllales and incorporating chemical, mor- 
phological, embryological, and anatomical characters, in- 
cluded 12 families. 
Recent phylogenetic analyses have further clarified re- 
lationships (Applequist and Wallace 2001; Cuénoud et al.

Rhabdodendraceae, Simmondsiaceae 
(Fig. 11.4), As- 
teropeiaceae, and Physenaceae are successive sisters to the 
core Caryophyllales (Fig. 11.5), and the entire clade includ- 
ing core Caryophyllales is often referred to as Caryophyl- 
lineae. Successive cambia, plastids of sieve elements with a 
peripheral ring of proteinaceous filaments, linear stigmas, 
often extending most of the length of the style or style- 
branches, ovules campylotropous, nectar produced by 
glandular adaxial staminal bases, and seeds with a curved 
embryo and starchy perisperm are synapomorphies for 
core Caryophyllales, and acetogenic naphthaquinones are 
probably a synapomorphy of Polygonineae. Many core 
Caryophyllales are also herbaceous and most have beta- 
. 
lains (see also Brockington et al. 2011, 2015). 
Applequist and Wallace (2001) showed that Portulaca- 
ceae as previously circumscribed were highly polyphyletic 
and that to recognize the enigmatic Cactaceae and Didie- 
reaceae would mean splitting the portulacaceous cohort, 
as they called it, into a number of segregate families. Sub- 
sequently, Portulacaceae have been split into numerous 
families (i.e., Anacampserotaceae, Montiaceae, Portulaca- 
ceae s.s., Talinaceae), and the portulacaceous cohort was 
recognized as suborder Portulacineae by Nyffeler and Eggli 
(2010). 
Cuénoud et al. (2002) and Brockington et al. (2009) 
showed 
that the traditional 
circumscription 
of Mol- 
luginaceae and Phytolaccaceae 
also represented 
non- 
monophyletic groups, wherein Limeum of Mollugina- 
ceae s.l. was not closely related to Mollugo, and Rivina 
of Phytolaccaceae was putatively more closely related to 
Nyctaginaceae and is therefore more appropriately treated 
within Petiveriaceae. Yang et al. (2015) have further clari- 
fied relationships within the phytolaccoid clade (i.e., Sar- 
cobataceae, Phytolaccaceae, Petiveriaceae, and Nyctagina- 
ceae), resolving Phytolaccaceae as sister to Sarcobataceae, 
and corroborating the sister relationship of Petiveriaceae 
and Nyctaginaceae. Caryophyllales have been dated to 
115-63 mya (Wikstrém et al. 2001; Anderson et al. 2005;

Numerous families and intrafamilial groups in Caryo- 
phyllales have been the subject of recent phylogenetic 
investigations. New insights into Cactaceae have been 
obtained with work done on Pereskia s.|. (Edwards et al. 
2005), as well as Cactoideae (Butterworth and Wallace 
2004; Arias et al. 2005; Harpke and Peterson 2006; Cal- 
vente et al. 2011; Albesiano and Terrazas 2012; Schlump- 
berger and Renner 2012; Frank et al. 2013; Sanchez et al. 
2014), Opuntioideae (Griffith 2004; Griffith and Porter 
2009; Helsen et al. 2009a,b; Majure et al. 2012b, 2013a,b; 
Ritz et al. 2013; Majure and Puente 2014; Barcenas 2015), 
and Cactaceae in general (Nyffeler 2007; Arakaki et al. 
2011; Barcenas et al. 2011; Hernandez-Hernandez et al. 
2011, 2014). Cytogenetic and population genetic work in 
the group also has been greatly enhanced (Arakaki et al. 
2007; Negr6n-Ortiz 2007; Segura et al. 2007; Baker et al. 
2009; Helsen et al. 2009a,b; las Pefias et al. 2009, 2014; 
Majure and Ribbens 2012; Majure et al. 2012a,c), as has 
anatomical work (Mauseth 2004, 2006); barcoding cacti 
has been attempted (Yesson et al. 2011). Sanderson et al. 
(2015) showed marked reduction in the chloroplast ge- 
nome of saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britton & 
Rose, and Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2015) recently sequenced 
the transcriptome of peyote, Lophophora williamsii (Salm- 
Dyck) J.M. Coult., which allowed them to discover puta- 
tive genes involved in alkaloid production. Arakaki et al. 
(2011) proposed a date of ~35 mya for the origin of the 
cacti with major diversification events in the family tak- 
ing place around 5-10 mya; the age of cacti recovered by 
Arakaki et al. (2011) is in line with previous dates for their 
origin suggested by Hershkovitz and Zimmer (1997). The 
closest relatives of cacti had long been debated (Hersh- 
kovitz and Zimmer 1997; Applequist and Wallace 2001; 
Nyffeler 2007; Griffith 2008). Most recent analyses sup- 
port Portulacaceae s.s. as sister to the family (Brockington 
et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Other groups within “Portulacaceae 
s.l.” have been 
studied phylogenetically (Montieae, Montiaceae, O’Quinn 
and Hufford 2005; Hectorella, Montiaceae, Applequist 
et al. 2006; Portulaca, Portulacaceae 
s.s., Ocampo and 
Columbus 2012; Didiereaceae, Bruyns et al. 2014) further 
increasing our understanding of evolutionary relationships 
in Portulacineae. Likewise, other studies have focused on 
Amaranthaceae (Applequist and Pratt 2005; Miller and 
Borsch 2005; Ogundipe and Chase 2009), Caryophyllaceae 
(Fior et al. 2006; Greenberg and Donoghue 2011), Polygo- 
naceae (Kim and Donoghue 2008; Sanchez and Kron 2008; 
Galasso et al. 2009; Sanchez et al. 2009; Burke et al. 2010), 
Droseraceae (Rivadavia et al. 2003), Nepenthaceae (Nepen- 
thes, Meimberg and Heubl 2006), Aizoaceae (Hassan et al. 
2005; Klak et al. 2007; Thiede et al. 2007), and Nyctagina- 
ceae (Douglas and Manos 2007). Sloan et al. (2014) ana- 
lyzed the enigmatic occurrence of increased rates of plastid 
genome evolution in Silene (Caryophyllaceae), and Yashina 
et al. (2012) reportedly revived 30,000-year-old seeds of 
Silene stenophylla Ledeb. from Pleistocene permafrost. 
Yang et al. (2015) have recently reconstructed the phylog- 
eny of Caryophyllales using transcriptome data. Selected 
members of Caryophyllales are illustrated in Figs. 11.4 and 
11.6-11.7. 
CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
IN CARYOPHYLLALES 
Chemical Evolution: Anthocyanins 
versus Betalains 
Anthocyanin and betalain production are mutually exclu- 
sive chemical pathways. In all core Caryophyllales exam- 
ined, except Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae s.I. (i.e., 
including Kewaceae), anthocyanin pigments have been re- 
placed by betalains, which have taken on the functions of 
anthocyanins in both reproductive and vegetative tissues. 
From phylogenetic analyses, it is clear that betalain pig- 
ments probably evolved once and were lost three times in 
the group, although many taxa still have yet to be screened 
for pigment type (Brockington et al. 2011, 2015). Several 
. 
hypotheses have been posited for the evolution of beta- 
lain pigments in Caryophyllales, but no clear evidence has 
strongly supported those ideas. Both anthocyanins and be- 
talains are apparently regulated in a similar, if not identi- 
cal, manner (e.g., Stafford 1994; Clement and Mabry 1996; 
Shimada et al. 2007), but the production of anthocyanin 
pigments appears to be modified during transcription in 
betalain producers (Shimada et al. 2004, 2005). The bio- 
chemical and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for 
the complete replacement of anthocyanins by betalains in 
this clade remain unresolved. Anthocyanin production oc- 
curs via the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, but although 
anthocyanins are absent from betalain-producing plants, 
the precursors of anthocyanins (proanthocyanidins) are 
present, especially in seedlings, which often contain both 
dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFS) that converts dihydro- 
flavonols into leucocyanidins and anthocyanidin synthase 
(ANS) that converts leucocyanidins to anthocyanidins (Shi- 
mada et al. 2005), although they both are downregulated 
(reviewed in Brockington et al. 2011). Transcriptome data 
suggest that duplications of DODA and CYP76AD1 (those 
genes that in tandem are responsible for producing red be- 
tanidin pigments) in the core Caryophyllales resulted in the 
neofunctionalization of those duplicates to produce beta- 
lains. This is inferred to have happened only once, while the

downregulation of those same genes within the betalain- 
producing clade led to a reversal to anthocyanin produc- 
tion on three separate occasions, in Caryophyllaceae, Ke- 
waceae, and Molluginaceae s.s. (Brockington et al. 2015). 
Using maximum parsimony, Brockington et al. (2011) 
showed that betalains may have evolved once (under ACC- 
TRAN optimization) in the most recent common ances- 
tor of the Microteaceae + Cactaceae clade or twice (under 
DELTRAN optimization; once in Amaranthaceae and once 
in the Stegnospermataceae + Cactaceae clade). Using sto- 
chastic character mapping, they revealed mostly the same 
pattern. Considering the scenario where betalains evolved 
twice in Caryophyllales, there would have been two re- 
versals back to the production of anthocyanin pigments 
versus three reversals under the scenario where betalains 
evolved only once. However, Brockington et al. (2011) 
stressed that we still know little about pigment expression 
within core Caryophyllales. Only dubious reports for pig- 
ment type are available for a number of taxa, and pigment 
data are completely unknown for others, rendering char- 
acter reconstruction of pigment type in the group prelimi- 
nary at best. 
Here we provide the results from character mapping of 
pigment type using both maximum parsimony (MP) and 
maximum likelihood (ML) analyses (Fig. 11.8). For MP 
under DELTRAN optimization, betalain pigments were ac- 
quired independently, once in Amaranthaceae, and again 
in the most recent common ancestor of the rest of the 
betalain-producing members of core Caryophyllales with 
two reversals to anthocyanin pigments. Under ACCTRAN 
optimization, the acquisition of betalain pigments is equiv- 
ocal but may have evolved only once with the most recent 
common ancestor of Microtea + Cactaceae, which would 
suggest three reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation, as do 
most recent analyses of transcriptome data (Brockington 
et al. 2015). Using ML, the origin of betalain pigments also 
is equivocal, although it is most likely that the common 
ancestor of the Stegnosperma + Cactaceae clade produced 
betalain pigments with two subsequent reversals in Hyper- 
telis and Molluginaceae (Fig. 11.8). 
Pollen 
No single pollen type characterizes all members of Caryo- 
phyllales. However, all core Caryophyllales examined pos- 
sess pollen with a spinulose and tubuliferous/punctate ek- 
texine and a spinulose aperture membrane or operculum 
(Nowicke 1975). Within core Caryophyllales, most fami- 
lies exhibit multiple pollen morphologies, indicating that 
pollen structure is labile (Fig. 11.9). Three basic types of 
pollen have been observed in core Caryophyllales: tricol- 
pate, pantoporate, and pantocolpate, all with a spinulose 
and tubuliferous/punctate ektexine (Nowicke 1975). Tri- 
colpate pollen of similar morphology (type I) is found in 
Aizoaceae and some Cactaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Mollugi- 
naceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phytolaccaceae, and Portulacaceae. 
Pantoporate pollen (type II) occurs in Amaranthaceae (in- 
cluding Chenopodiaceae) and some genera of Caryophyl- 
laceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phytolaccaceae, and Portulacaceae. 
The pantocolpate pollen (type III) of core Caryophyllales 
typically has 12 to 15 colpi and is found in Basellaceae and 
some genera of Cactaceae, Molluginaceae, Nyctaginaceae, 
Phytolaccaceae, and Portulacaceae. 
Two narrowly distributed pollen types have been re- 
ported for core Caryophyllaceae (Nowicke 1975): tricol- 
pate with a reticulate ektexine (type IV) in Nyctaginaceae 
and pantoporate with a reticulate ektexine (type V) in 
Caryophyllaceae. A divergent form of pantoporate grains 
with reticulate ektexine is found in some Amaranthaceae 
and Cactaceae. For example, having pantoporate pol- 
len grains with reticulate ektexine is a synapomorphy for 
Opuntia s.s., the prickly pear cacti, although the reticulate 
surface has been lost in certain hummingbird-pollinated 
species of the Nopalea clade (Majure and Puente 2014). 
Certain aspects of structural characteristics of the pollen 
(e.g., partially fused columellae) unite some members of 
Basellaceae, Didiereaceae, Portulacaceae, and Cactaceae 
(Nowicke 1994, 1996; see also Erdtman 1966) in Cron- 
quist and Thorne’s (1994) suborder Portulacineae. How- 
. 
ever, at least some of the exine characteristics that unite 
these groups are also found elsewhere in core Caryophyl- 
lales (Nowicke 1975, 1996). Despite their small size (fewer 
than 20 species in 4 genera), Basellaceae are highly poly- 
morphic in pollen morphology (Nowicke 1994, 1996). All 
pollen of Didiereaceae is 5—7-zonocolpate, a pollen type 
that is apparently unique in core Caryophyllales, with a spi- 
nulose and annular perforate or punctate tectum (Nowicke 
1996). Cactaceae and Portulacaceae are polymorphic, with 
pollen types I and III and types II and III, respectively (e.g., 
Nowicke 1975, 1994). 
The pantoporate pollen type with exine ornamentation 
of scattered spinulae, typical of Amaranthaceae, is well rep- 
resented in the fossil record of dispersed pollen. Usually 
given the fossil-genus name Chenopodipollis, these fossils 
provide our only evidence for Amaranthaceae in the late 
Cretaceous (Maastrichtian; Nichols 2002) and Paleocene 
(Zetter et al. 2011). Numerous younger occurrences have 
been recorded (Muller 1981), but the assignment to indi- 
vidual extant genera is not possible, because they overlap 
in morphology. Caryophylloflora paleogenica, an inflores- 
cence containing periporate pollen in situ, was documented 
from the Eocene of northeastern Tasmania (Jordan and 
Macphail 2003). In general, however, the megafossil record 
of Caryophyllales remains poorly documented.

Figure 11.8. 
Reconstruction of anthocyanin vs. betalain production in Caryophyllales using both MP and ML. Diagrams of both betalain and anthocyanin mol- 
ecules are given to the left. Under MP, the evolution of betalain pigments is equivocal. It is clear that betalain pigments were present in the most recent common 
ancestors of Amaranthaceae, as well as the Stegnospermataceae + Cactaceae clade, although with reversals in Molluginaceae and Hypertelidaceae. 
Pollen of Achatocarpaceae (Achatocarpus and Phaulo- 
thamnus) differs from that of all core Caryophyllales in 
being hexaporate with a scabrate ektexine (Bortenschlager 
et al. 1972; Nowicke 1975; Nowicke and Skvarla 1977, 
1979; Skvarla and Nowicke 1976, 1982). Pollen of Sim- 
mondsia is triporate with an irregularly scabrate tectum 
(Nowicke and Skvarla 1984), distinct from that of all core 
Caryophyllales and from Buxaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and 
Pandaceae with which it had previously been placed (e.g., 
Hutchinson 1959; Scholz 1964; Takhtajan 1969; Cron- 
quist 1981). A comprehensive comparative analysis of pol- 
len in noncore Caryophyllales has not yet been conducted.

Given the many gaps in pollen data across Ca#yophyllales, 
reconstruction of pollen evolution is premature. 
Wood Anatomy 
Some features of stem anatomy appear to be synapomor- 
phies for clades within Caryophyllales. Successive cambia 
are widespread in core Caryophyllales (Metcalfe and Chalk 
1950; Horak 1981; Carlquist 1999a, 2010) and have also 
been reported from Simmondsia, Rhabdodendron, Franke- 
niaceae (Carlquist 2001b, 2010), and at least one genus 
each of Plumbaginaceae (Carlquist and Boggs 1996) and 
Polygonaceae (see Carlquist 2001b). Successive cambia 
are absent in Achatocarpaceae, Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, 
Microteaceae, Portulacaceae, and some Petiveriaceae (Hil- 
leria, Ledenbergia, Schindleria, Trichostigma; Carlquist 
2000b, 2010 and refs. therein). 
Carlquist (2001b) suggested that the genetic mechanisms 
for the production of successive cambia may have arisen at 
the base of the core Caryophyllales and were then lost in 
those families that lack successive cambia. However, it may 
be that initiation of subsequent cambial layers is delayed, as 
in Stegnosperma (Horak 1981), rather than absent. Succes- 
sive cambia have not been reported in the woody members 
of the carnivorous clade, but their presence in Polygona- 
ceae and Plumbaginaceae indicates that the origin of this 
feature may predate the entire Caryophyllales, with mul- 
tiple losses of the trait. However, this is not the most parsi- 
monious interpretation of the evolution of the character in 
Caryophyllales. It appears most likely that the lack of suc- 
cessive cambia is plesiomorphic and that successive cambia 
has arisen independently throughout Caryophyllales. 
Several wood features could be synapomorphies for the 
entire Caryophyllales and may have been lost in all or most 
of the core Caryophyllales (depending on the placement of 
Rhabdodendron). Alternatively, these wood features could 
represent cases of parallel evolution or possibly synapo- 
morphies of Polygonineae. The vestured pits in vessels and 
tracheids of Rhabdodendron also occur in Polygonaceae 
(Ter Welle 1976; Carlquist 2001b). Rhabdodendraceae, 
Polygonaceae, 
Plumbaginaceae, 
Ancistrocladaceae, 
and 
Dioncophyllaceae all have silica bodies (Gottwald and 
Parameswaran 
1968; Ter Welle 1976; Carlquist 1988, 
2001b; Carlquist and Boggs 1996). Non-bordered perfo- 
ration plates are also present in Rhabdodendraceae and 
are common in much of Caryophyllales (Carlquist 1999b, 
2000b, 2001b). Many wood characters, such as simple per- 
foration plates, small pits on lateral vessel walls, libriform 
fibers, paratracheal axial parenchyma, storying, silica bod- 
ies, and dark-staining amorphous deposits, also indicate a 
close relationship between Polygonaceae and Plumbagina- 
ceae (Carlquist and Boggs 1996). 
Superasterids 
259 
The carnivorous clade of Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae, 
Drosophyllaceae, Dioncophyllaceae, and Ancistrocladaceae 
is also apparently supported by wood anatomical features. 
Although secondary growth is limited in members of this 
clade, vessel elements with simple perforation plates, fibri- 
form vessel elements, tracheids with large, fully bordered 
pits, diffuse (and variously grouped) axial parenchyma, 
and paedomorphic rays (sensu Carlquist 1988) one to two 
cells wide are shared by those members of this clade that 
have been analyzed to date (Gottwald and Parameswaran 
1968; Carlquist 1981; Carlquist and Wilson 1995). Some 
features, such as simple perforation plates, are also com- 
mon to other members of Caryophyllales and may not be 
synapomorphies for the carnivorous clade. 
Despite the many investigations of various aspects of 
wood anatomy for members of Caryophyllales, gaps re- 
main for most characters. Even a character such as succes- 
sive cambia, the presence of which has been investigated in 
many taxa (see also Carlquist 2007), has not been scored 
in several other groups, leaving potentially significant gaps 
in our knowledge. Furthermore, scoring of successive cam- 
bia as “present or absent” may introduce additional prob- 
lems, because evidence of successive cambia may arise at 
different stages of development and in different tissues in 
different taxa. Thus, further analysis of the evolution of 
wood characters requires additional comparative data be- 
fore optimization of the observed variation across a phylo- 
genetic tree should be attempted. 
Extreme Environments 
Many members of Caryophyllales are adapted structurally 
or physiologically to extreme environments such as deserts, 
high-alkaline soils, high-saline substrates, and nutrient- 
poor soils. They have conquered these habitats through 
a variety of adaptations such as unusual photosynthetic 
pathways (crassulacean acid metabolism, CAM, and C, as 
opposed to C, photosynthesis), unusual morphologies (e.g., 
succulence, spine production), secretion of excessive salt by 
special glands, and unusual methods of nutrient uptake 
(e.g., carnivory). Given the distributions of these adapta- 
tions across Caryophyllales, it appears that most of these 
adaptations have arisen many times (see Chapter 13). The 
fact that many Caryophyllales are adapted to extreme en- 
vironments may account for the paucity of megafossils of 
the clade. 
Photosynthetic Pathways 
C, photosynthesis has apparently evolved independently in 
several lineages of Caryophyllales (see Chapter 13). How- 
ever, the predisposition to evolve this suite of traits may 

260 Chapter 11 
have arisen in an ancestor common to those lineages that 
eventually developed this adaptation to high-light, high- 
temperature environments. The lability of photosynthetic 
pathways is clear in members of Salsola and relatives (for- 
merly in tribe Salsoleae of Chenopodiaceae, but now part 
of Amaranthaceae). This group exhibits in microcosm the 
patterns of photosynthetic variation present in the family 
as a whole. A highly resolved phylogenetic tree of Salsola 
largely agrees with the photosynthetic type and anatomy of 
leaves and cotyledons and provides strong support for the 
origin and evolution of two main lineages of plants in “tribe 
Salsoleae”—the NAD-ME and NADP-ME types of C, pho- 
tosynthesis, respectively (Pyankov et al. 2001). Reconstruc- 
tion of photosynthetic characters on the ITS phylogenetic 
tree demonstrates a single origin of C, photosynthesis, with 
subsequent divergence into the NAD-ME and NADP-ME 
lineages and two reversions to C, photosynthesis. Sage 
et al. (2007) showed that C, photosynthesis has evolved at 
least five times in Amaranthaceae s.s. Ocampo et al. (2013) 
showed that the ancestral photosynthetic pathway was 
C, in Portulaca, and three different types of C, Kranz anat- 
omy were revealed in their study. The Cryptopetala clade of 
Portulaca showed a shift to C,-C, intermediate photosyn- 
thetic types. Likewise, Christin et al. (2011) showed that 
C,-C, intermediate types evolved at least twice, if not three 
times, in Molluginaceae s.]. and that C, photosynthesis was 
derived twice in that group. 
The topology for core Caryophyllales indicates that 
CAM has also arisen multiple times within this clade, in- 
cluding in Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, Anacampserotaceae, 
and Aizoaceae. The similar selection pressures exerted by 
the arid habitats occupied by members of these clades have 
resulted in a spectacular convergence in morphology and 
photosynthetic pathway. Winter et al. (2011) showed that 
Opuntia elatior Mill. (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae) is facul- 
tatively CAM, wherein seedlings, before the production of 
the typical flattened stem segments (cladodes) of the group, 
undergo C, photosynthesis. Those authors correlated the 
initiation of CAM in O. elatior with plant maturity and 
drought stress; however, more mature plants of the same 
species under amply watered conditions also displayed 
C, photosynthesis (Winter et al. 2011). This study contrasts 
with other studies that have shown cacti to be strictly CAM 
(Gerwick and Williams 1978; Osmond et al. 1979, 2008; 
Nobel 1988). Winter et al. (2011) suggested that constantly 
monitoring CO, uptake, as well as titratable acidity, from 
germination through the production of more mature stem 
segments may reveal that photosynthetic pathways are 
more labile (i.e., faculatively CAM; see also Winter et al. 
2015) than generally presumed in Cactaceae. Hernandez- 
Gonzalez and Villareal (2007) analyzed members of the 
subfamily Cactoideae, Neobuxbaumia, Pachycereus, Steno- 
cereus, Escontria, Myrtillocactus, and Ferocactus, which all 
exhibited CAM photosynthesis, even during the seedling 
stage. Likewise, most studies monitoring photosynthetic 
rates in Cactaceae also have focused on the larger subfam- 
ily Cactoideae. Thus, there likely are different photosyn- 
thetic strategies in the clade, with some taxa more flexible 
in their photosynthetic pathways than others. Guralnick 
et al. (2008) also showed that Grahamia (Anacampsero- 
taceae) was facultatively CAM, which was induced through 
water stress. Ocampo and Columbus (2010) reported fac- 
ultatively CAM species in Anacampserotaceae, Cactaceae 
(Opuntioideae), and Didiereaceae. 
Carnivory 
Multiple mechanisms of carnivory have evolved in Caryo- 
phyllales (see Chapter 13). Insects are ensnared by pitfall 
traps in Nepenthaceae, flypaper traps in Drosera, Droso- 
phyllum, and Triphyophyllum, and snap-traps in Dionaea 
and Aldrovanda. Although previous classifications con- 
sidered only Drosera and Dionaea to be closely related to 
each other (e.g., Cronquist 1981) and none of these groups 
to be close to Caryophyllales, all phylogenetic analyses 
have indicated both their relationship to each other and to 
Caryophyllidae sensu Cronquist (1981) (e.g., Albert et al. 
1992; Chase et al. 1993; Williams et al. 1994; D. Soltis 
_ 
et al. 1997b, 2000; Meimberg et al. 2001; Cuénoud et al. 
2002; Brockington et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2010; Soltis 
et al. 2011). Although relationships among these carnivo- 
rous genera have varied with taxon sampling and gene(s) 
analyzed (e.g., Albert et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1994; Fay 
et al. 1997; Lledo et al. 1998; Meimberg et al. 2001; Cam- 
eron et al. 2002; Cuénoud et al. 2002; Brockington 
et al. 
2009; Moore et al. 2011; Soltis et al. 2011), their phyloge- 
netic relationships are clear: Droseraceae form a clade with 
Nepenthaceae, which is sister to Drosophyllaceae + (Ancis- 
trocladaceae + Dioncophyllaceae) (Brockington et al. 2009; 
Soltis et al. 2011). This topology implies that “carnivory” 
was gained a single time in Caryophyllales and lost in An- 
cistrocladaceae and some Dioncophyllaceae (see Meimberg 
et al. 2001; see Chapter 13, Figs 1376), 
Carnivory was achieved through several different mech- 
anisms (pitchers, flypaper traps, snap-traps), involving 
extreme modifications of leaves and glands (see Williams 
1976; Juniper et al. 1989; Albert et al. 1992; Chapter 13, 
Fig. 13.6); each method may have evolved only once in 
this clade (Cameron et al. 2002 for snap-traps, and infer- 
ences from trees of Meimberg et al. 2001 and Cameron 
et al. 2002 for pitchers and flypaper traps; see Chapter 13), 
although Renner and Specht (2011) using stochastic char- 

acter mapping provided strong evidence,.ewat flypaper 
traps—that is, stalked and vascularized, with both xylem 
and phloem, gland-headed hairs, evolved three times in 
the clade. The absence of carnivory in Ancistrocladaceae 
and some Dioncophyllaceae results from the loss of the fly- 
paper trap (i.e., the absence of stalked, vascularized, gland- 
headed hairs; Renner and Specht 2011). 
Floral Development 
The perianth of Caryophyllales is highly variable, often 
monocyclic and sepaloid or sepal-derived, but in’ other 
cases dicyclic with both sepaloid and petaloid whorls. 
However, the nature of the petals in Caryophyllales has 
long been debated: are they true petals, or staminodes, 
or appendages of stamens (Ronse De Craene and Smets 
1998a,b)? Inferences of perianth evolution require analyses 
of the androecium as well; stamen number in Caryophyl- 
lales ranges from one to more than 4000 (Ronse De Craene 
2013). Analyses of floral development in Caryophyllaceae 
and other families may indicate that the apparent “diplo- 
stemonous” condition of Caryophyllales (i.e., five sepals, 
five petals, ten stamens, five-carpellate gynoecium) differs 
developmentally from diplostemony in other core eudicots 
(Ronse De Craéne and Smets 1993, 1995; Vanvinckenroye 
and Smets 1996; Ronse De Craene et al. 1997, 1998). The 
five “petals” were interpreted as being derived from a hex- 
amerous whorl of three stamen pairs, followed by loss of a 
stamen. A similar process was suggested to account for the 
outer (antesepalous) stamens, which likely correspond to 
one whorl of three stamens and a second whorl of two; loss 
of one stamen from a hexamerous whorl (or two whorls of 
three stamens) resulted in five inner (antepetalous) stamens. 
The result of these modifications is an apparently diplo- 
stemonous flower; however, this final form would not be 
homologous to that of other core eudicots, because it was 
achieved independently via a different mechanism (as inter- 
preted by Ronse De Craene and Smets 1993). 
Developmental genetic work has confirmed that some 
core Caryophyllales exhibit a perianth that is unique 
(among eudicots) wherein petaloid organs (i.e., stamino- 
dial petaloids) are derived from stamens (Brockington et al. 
2013), while still other members of Caryophyllales clearly 
exhibit petaloid structures derived from sepals (Brocking- 
ton et al. 2012) (see Chapter 14). The origin of petaloid 
structures in Caryophyllales is highly variable, and even 
within Aizoaceae, certain members exhibit sepal-derived 
petaloid structures (Sesuvioideae and Aizooideae), while 
others are derived from stamens (i.e., the clade composed 
of Mesembryanthemoideae + Ruschoideae; Brockington 
et al. 2012; Ronse De Craene and Brockington 2013). 
Superasterids 
261 
ASTERIDS 
Recognition of a group of angiosperms that corresponds 
in large part to Asteridae (asterids) traces to de Jussieu’s 
(1789) Monopetalae, those angiosperms with fused pet- 
als. Subsequently referred to as Sympetalae (Reichenbach 
1827-1829), this group was divided into Pentacyclicae and 
Tetracyclicae by Warming (1879). Tetracyclicae, with a sin- 
gle series of stamens, formed the core of modern treatments 
of subclass Asteridae (e.g., Takhtajan 1969, 1980, 1997; 
Cronquist 1981). Asteridae sensu Takhtajan and Cronquist 
have been the focus of phylogenetic analysis for more than 
25 years, with data from morphology (e.g., Hufford 1992), 
restriction site analysis of the plastid genome (e.g., Jansen 
and Palmer 1987, 1988; Downie and Palmer 1992), gene 
sequences (e.g., Olmstead et al. 1992, 1993, 2000; D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Jansen 
et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Ruhfel et al. 2014), as well as molecular data plus mor- 
phology (Bremer et al. 2001), used to improve understand- 
ing of relationships within Asteridae and between Asteri- 
dae and other groups. A significant result of these analyses 
is that Asteridae sensu Takhtajan and Cronquist are not 
monophyletic; instead, they form the core of a larger aste- 
rid clade that also includes members of Cronquist’s (1981) 
Hamamelidae (Eucommiales), Dilleniidae (most Theales, 
Lecythidales, Ericales, Ebenales, Diapensiales, Primulales, 
Sarraceniaceae, Fouquieriaceae, Loasaceae), and Rosidae 
(Hydrangeaceae, Cornales, Pittosporaceae, Apiales, Bybli- 
daceae, Columelliaceae, Alseuosmiaceae, Aquifoliaceae, 
Icacinaceae, Balsaminaceae, Escallonia and Montinia from 
Grossulariaceae, and Eremosyne and Vahlia from Saxifra- 
gaceae; Olmstead et al. 1992, 1993; Chase et al. 1993). 
The asterids sensu APG (1998), APG II (2003), APG III 
(2009), and APG IV (2016) include approximately one- 
third of all angiosperm species, with almost 80,000 spe- 
cies in nearly 4,700 genera and approximately 111 families 
(Thorne 1992a,b; Albach et al. 2001c; APG IV 2016). In 
contrast to the large rosid clade, for which no unifying non- 
DNA characters are known (see Chapter 10), several fea- 
tures unite all, or most, asterids. The asterid clade includes 
nearly all species of angiosperms that produce iridoids (Jen- 
sen 1992) and tropane alkaloids (Romeike 1978) and most 
angiosperms that produce caffeic acid (Molgaard 1985; 
Grayer et al. 1999). Dahlgren (1975) noted that the occur- 
rence of iridoids is strongly correlated with sympetalous 
flowers and embryological characters such as unitegmic- 
tenuinucellate ovules and cellular endosperm development. 
However, although several non-DNA characters are preva- 
lent throughout the asterids, circumscription of the clade 

262 Chapter 11 
based on morphological data alone has been difficult be- 
cause of extensive parallelisms (Hufford 1992) and losses 
of characters (Olmstead et al. 1992; Albach et al. 2001b). 
Patterns of character evolution are discussed in more detail 
later in this chapter. 
The circumscription of and relationships within asterids 
sensu APG have been clarified through both broad analy- 
ses of the angiosperms (e.g., Chase et al. 1993; D. Soltis 
et al. 1997a,b, 2000; P. Soltis et al. 1999a; Savolainen et al. 
2000a,b; Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Soltis et al. 2011; Ruh- 
fel et al. 2014) and more focused analyses of specific clades. 
The most comprehensive recent molecular analyses of the 
asterids themselves (Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 
2002) have built on the earlier work of Olmstead et al. 
(19927 1993;2000): 
Most asterids fall into one of four major clades— 
Cornales, Ericales, lamiids (euasterid I or Garryidae; Can- 
tino et al. 2007), and campanulids (euasterid II or Campan- 
ulidae; Cantino et al. 2007) (Fig. 11.10). With combined 
datasets of two (Savolainen et al. 2000a), three (D. Soltis 
et al. 2000), four (Albach et al. 2001c), six (Bremer et al. 
2002), and 17 genes (Soltis et al. 2011), internal support is 
generally high (bootstrap values >95%) for these clades, as 
well as for the relationships among them. In earlier analy- 
ses, lamiids received only weak support (56% jackknife) 
with three genes (D. Soltis et al. 2000) but very strong sup- 
port (99% jackknife) with six DNA regions (Bremer et al. 
2002). More recent analyses also found strong support for 
that clade (Jansen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2011; Soltis 
et al. 2011). 
We discuss phylogenetic relationships of Asteridae fol- 
lowing D. Soltis et al. (2011). Cornales, followed by Erica- 
les, are sister to lamiids + campanulids (Gentianidae sensu 
Cantino et al. 2007) (Fig. 11.10). The composition and in- 
ternal phylogenetic structure of these clades are discussed 
in more detail below. Fossil elements known for this group 
are given in Supplementary Table 11.1 (at press.uchicago 
.edu/sites/soltis/). 
GORNALES 
Cornales consist of six (sensu APG III 2009), seven (sensu 
Stevens 2001 onwards; APG II 2003; APG IV 2016; 
Fig. 11.10), or ten families (Xiang et al. 2011) (see Chap- 
ter 12): Cornaceae (including Alangium, sometimes recog- 
nized as Alangiaceae; Xiang et al. 2011), Nyssaceae (in- 
cluding Mastixiaceae and Davidiaceae; Xiang et al. 2011), 
Loasaceae, 
Hydrangeaceae, 
Grubbiaceae, 
Curtisiaceae, 
and Hydrostachyaceae (several families are illustrated in 
Figs. 11.11, 11.12). This circumscription expands Cron- 
quist’s (1981) Cornales with the addition of Hydrange-

(Cronquist’s Rosidae-Rosales), Hydrostachyaceae 
(Asteridae-Callitrichales), Loasaceae (Dilleniidae-Violales), 
and Grubbia (Dilleniidae-Ericales). 
Molecular data have also indicated that three families 
should be excluded from Cornales sensu Cronquist: Garry- 
aceae, Aucubaceae (now included in Garryaceae), and Hel- 
wingiaceae. These three taxa have affinities elsewhere in 
the asterids (see “Garryales” and “Aquifoliales,” below). 
The DNA-based circumscription of Cornales resembles 
more closely the Cornales of Takhtajan (1997), although 
he placed Hydrostachyaceae and Loasaceae in Lamiidae 
and Grubbiaceae in Bruniales of his Dilleniidae. Thorne’s 
(1992a,b) Cornineae resembled Cronquist’s Cornales, but 
also included Eucommiaceae and Icacinaceae, both of 

Superasterids

which are now known to have relationships elsewhere in 
the asterids, Garryales and Icacinales (i.e., basal lamiids). 
Non-DNA synapomorphies include the sepals obsolete or 
represented by small teeth, pollen grains sometimes with 
H-shaped thin-regions (endoapertures), an inferior or half- 
inferior ovary, nectary a more or less epigynous disk, and 
drupaceous fruits. 
Cladistic analyses using restriction sites (Downie and 
Palmer 1992), morphological and chemical data (Hufford 
1992), rbcL or matK sequences (Olmstead et al. 1992, 

264 Chapter 11 
1993; Chase et al. 1993; Xiang et al. 1993), and combined 
DNA datasets involving multiple genes (e.g., Albach et al. 
2001a,c; Xiang et al. 2002; Xiang et al. 2011) have re- 
vealed a similar Cornales clade. Cornales include 51 genera 
and approximately 590 species (Stevens 2001 onwards). 
Cornales comprised two subclades based on plastid 
data: Curtisiaceae 
+ Grubbiaceae and Cornaceae (includ- 
ing Alangiaceae); and Nyssaceae (including Mastixiaceae 
and Davidiaceae), Hydrostachyaceae, Loasaceae, and Hy- 
drangeaceae (Xiang et al. 2011). Curtisiaceae and Grub- 
biaceae formed a clade sister to Cornaceae (including 
Alangiaceae), and the clade composed of Mastixiaceae + 
(Nyssaceae + Davidiaceae) was sister to a clade composed 
of Hydrostachyaceae + (Loaceae + Nyssaceae). However, 
based on nuclear ribosomal data (Xiang et al. 2011), Grub- 
biaceae + Curtisiaceae were recovered as sister to Loasa- 
ceae, Nyssaceae and Davidiaceae formed a clade with un- 
resolved sister relationships, Mastixiaceae formed a clade 
also with unresolved sister relationships, Hydrostachya- 
ceae formed a clade with Alangiaceae that was sister to 
Cornaceae s.s., and Hydrangeaceae formed a clade sister 
to the rest of Cornales. Combined analyses of both plastid 
and nuclear data resolved the same clades as in the plastid 
analysis, although sister relationships of Nyssaceae (includ- 
ing Davidiaceae and Mastixiaceae) were unresolved. 
Cornales 
are well represented 
in the fossil record. 
Among the oldest examples is the fruit Hironoia from the 
Late Cretaceous (Coniacian) of Japan (Takahashi et al. 
2002). The fruit was thick-walled, and composed mainly of 
fibers, with three or four locules each containing one pen- 
dulous seed and opening by a single dorsal valve; the fruit 
also showed preserved persistent, epigynous tepals, and a 
single, narrow style. Absence of an axial vascular strand 
is a distinctive feature that it shares with most extant Cor- 
naceae and Nyssaceae. The presence of fibers, rather than 
isodiametric sclereids, is a feature distinguishing this from 
Cornus and Alangium and indicating similarity with Nys- 
saceae (Takahashi et al. 2002). 
Cornus and Alangium are recognizable by the early Ce- 
nozoic. Cornus is confirmed in the Paleocene on the basis 
of leaves with compass-needle trichomes (Fig. 11.12d,e), 
and well-preserved fruits (Fig. 11.12g). Alangium is rec- 
ognizable from fruits from the early Eocene London Clay 
(Reid and Chandler 1933) and middle Eocene of Oregon 
(Manchester 1994b), as well as by fossil-dispersed pollen 
(Morley 1982; Martin et al. 1996). 
The fossil record of Nyssaceae includes many oc- 
currences representing both extinct and extant genera 
(Supplementary Table 11.1). Fruits conforming morpho- 
logically and anatomically to extant Nyssa have been iden- 
tified from the Campanian of Alberta, Canada. They are 
trilocular with single-seeded locules that are c-shaped in 
cross-section, having dorsal, apically positioned germina- 
tion valves (Fig. 11.12j; Manchester et al. 2015). Davidia 
also is first known from the late Campanian of Alberta, 
Canada, based on permineralized 
fruits 
(Fig. 11.12h; 
Manchester et al. 2015). These fossil fruits conform to 
the modern genus in having multiple, radially arranged, 
single-seeded locules, fibrous endocarp construction, and 
elongate dorsal germination valves. They closely resemble 
the modern genus morphologically and anatomically, but 
differ from the modern species of Davidia by their smaller 
size and fewer locules (5-6 vs 6-9). By the Paleocene, Da- 
vidia is recognizable on the basis of well-preserved fruits, 
and the infructescence axis, bearing scars of showy bracts, 
and cordate, serrate leaves fitting well to the modern genus 
(Manchester 2002). Extinct members of Nyssaceae include 
the Paleocene plants Amersinia in North America and Asia 
(Manchester et al. 1999) and Browniea in North America 
(Manchester and Hickey 2007). These plants bore heads of 
trilocular fruits similar to those of extant Camptotheca and 
had dorsal germination valves conforming with Nyssaceae, 
but they are distinguished by differences in fruit wall and 
septum, thickness, perianth development, and the associ- 
ated foliage and pollen types. 
Although Mastixioideae contain only two Old World 
tropical genera today, Mastixia and Diplopanax, this sub- 
family was diverse and widespread in the Northern Hemi- 
sphere based on fossil fruits (Mai 1993; Stockey et al.. 
1998) (Supplementary Table 11.1). The earliest examples 
are from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Germany 
(Knobloch and Mai 1986). These fossils show full-length 
dorsal germination valves, one of the diagnostic features 
of Mastixioideae and Cornaceae, distinguishing them from 
the Nyssaceae, which have germination valves confined 
to the apical half of the fruit. Cenozoic mastixioid fruits 
include the two modern genera (e.g., Fig. 11.12), as well 
as several extinct genera with novel combinations of fruit 
characters (Mai 1993). 
Cornales 
appear 
to have 
originated 
in the mid- 
Cretaceous, according to divergence time estimates based 
on numerous fossil calibrations (stem age = ~115 mya, 
crown age = ~96 mya; Xiang et al. 2011). Others have re- 
covered similar ages for the clade, between 123-89 mya 
(Wikstrom et al. 2001; Bremer et al. 2004; Anderson et al. 
2005; Janssens et al. 2009; Lemaire et al. 20114). Possible 
non-DNA synapomorphies for Cornales include an ovary 
that is at least partially inferior, an epigynous nectar disk, 
small sepals, and drupaceous fruits (Fig. 11.11); however, 
there are deviations from these features, particularly in the 
highly modified aquatic Hydrostachys (see Albach et al. 
2001a; Hufford et al. 2001). See Fig. 11.12 for representa- 
tives of fossil members of Cornales. 
The southern African genus Curtisia was included in

266 Chapter 11 
Cornaceae by Cronquist (1981) and APG I (1998), but 
based on more recent analyses, Curtisiaceae were reinstated 
as distinct in APG II (2003), and that treatment has been 
maintained. Fossil fruits of Curtisia from the early Eocene 
of England indicate that its modern distribution is relictual 
(Manchester et al. 2007b). The relationships of Grubbia, 
a genus of three species from southern Africa, have long 
been problematic using morphology. It has variously been 
referred to Santalales, Ericales, and Rosales (reviewed 
in Cronquist 1981; see also Carlquist 1978; Xiang et al. 
2002). 
Cornaceae (including Alangium) form a strongly sup- 
ported subclade. Cornus and Alangium resemble each other 
in floral morphology and embryology but differ in biochem- 
istry and some morphological features (Eyde 1988). Nyssa- 
ceae sensu lato, including Camptotheca, Davidia, Mastixia, 
and Diplopanax, also form a well-supported clade. Some 
analyses have suggested that Nyssaceae and Cornaceae are 
sisters; however, bootstrap support for this sister group re- 
lationship was less than 50% (Xiang et al. 2002), and more 
recent analyses do not support that placement (Xiang et al. 
2011). Although it had been proposed that Nyssaceae be 
included in Cornaceae (APG II 2003), that circumscription 
was shown to be premature using either plastid or nuclear 
data (Xiang et al. 2011), and Nyssaceae have now been 
reinstated as a distinct family (APG IV 2016; Chapter 12). 
However, it should be noted that Cornaceae and Nyssa- 
ceae share a number of features such as dorsal germination 
valves in their fruits, a base chromosome number of 11, 
and trans-septal vascular bundles to the ovules. Cornaceae 
and most Nyssaceae also share the presence of ellagitan- 
nins (Bate-Smith et al. 1975). 
Loasaceae and Hydrangeaceae appear as well-supported 
sisters in molecular analyses (e.g., Hempel et al. 1995; 
D. Soltis et al. 1995, 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; Huf- 
ford et al. 2001; Xiang et al. 2002; Xiang et al. 2011), a rela- 
tionship not recognized before Hufford’s (1992) analysis of 
morphological and chemical data. Both families have rare 
iridoids (deutzioside and derivatives, C,,-decarboxylated 
iridoids; see “Patterns of Character Evolution,” below; 
El-Naggar and Beal 1980) and share tuberculate trichomes 
with basal cell pedestals (Hufford 1992). Fendlera (Hy- 
drangeaceae) and Loasaceae share similar vessel elements 
(Quibell 1972). The relationship between Hydrangeaceae 
and Loasaceae is also supported by floral morphology 
(Roehls et al. 1997; Albach et al. 2001c). Relationships 
within Hydrangeaceae and Loasaceae have been the subject 
of several morphological and molecular analyses (D. Soltis 
et al. 1995; Hufford et al. 2001; Moody et al. 2001; Xiang 
et al. 2011). 
Hydrangeaceae can be traced to the Late Cretaceous 
based on charcoalified flowers of Tylerianthus crossmanen- 
sis Gandolfo from the Turonian of New Jersey (Gandolfo 
et al. 1998). The extant genus Hydrangea is readily recog- 
nized by the Eocene based on compressed, showy, sterile 
flowers and fruits (Fig. 11.12a; Mustoe 2002). Permineral- 
ized Eocene Hydrangea fruits from the middle Eocene of 
Oregon show intruded parietal placentation (Fig. 11.12b; 
Manchester 1994b). 
The enigmatic submerged aquatic Hydrostachys (ca. 
22 species; Xiang et al. 2002; Fan and Xiang 2003), the 
only member of Hydrostachyaceae, 
is well supported 
as a member of Cornales and was recovered as sister to 
Hydrangeaceae-Loasaceae using plastid data. However, the 
position of Hydrostachys within Cornales remains uncer- 
tain, as nuclear and plastid data suggest different relation- 
ships (Xiang et al. 2011). The placement of Hydrostachys 
may be difficult to resolve given the long branch to this 
taxon in most analyses. 
ERICALES 
Ericales consist of 22 families (Fig. 11.10): Actinidiaceae, 
Balsaminaceae, 
Clethraceae, 
Cyrillaceae, Diapensiaceae, 
Ebenaceae (including Lissocarpaceae), Ericaceae, Fouqui- 
eriaceae, Lecythidaceae (including Scytopetalaceae), Marc- 
graviaceae, Pentaphylacaceae 
(including Ternstroemiac- 
eae), Sladeniaceae, Polemoniaceae, Primulaceae (including . 
Maesaceae, Myrsinaceae, Theophrastaceae), Roridulaceae, 
Sapotaceae, Sarraceniaceae, Styracaceae (including Hale- 
siaceae), Symplocaceae, Tetrameristaceae (including Pell- 
icieraceae), Theaceae and possibly the parasitic Mitraste- 
monaceae (several members of Ericales are illustrated in 
Figs. 11.13 and 11.14 and fossils in 11.17) (Chase et al. 
1993; Kron and Chase 1993; Olmstead et al. 1993; John- 
son and Soltis 1995; Johnson et al. 1996, 1999; Kron 1996, 
1997; Morton et al. 1996; D. Soltis et al. 1997b, 2000; An- 
derberg et al. 1998, 2002; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; Bremer 
et al. 2002; Schonenberger et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2011). 
However, the exact placement of the genus Mitrastema 
(Mitrastemonaceae) within Ericales remains unclear (Bark- 
man et al. 2004). 
Ericales consist mainly of taxa previously placed in Dil- 
leniidae (sensu Cronquist 1981); the clade includes many 
former members of the dilleniid orders Theales, Lecythi- 
dales, Ericales, Diapensiales, Ebenales, and Primulales, 
and families Fouquieriaceae and Sarraceniaceae, as well as 
Polemoniaceae (Asteridae) and Balsaminaceae (Rosidae). 
The monophyly of the clade is strongly supported in multi- 
gene analyses (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c; 
Bremer et al. 2002; Schonenberger et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 
2011); weak support is also apparent with rbcL alone (e.g., 
Kallersj6 et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 2000b).

268 Chapter 11 
The age of Ericales has been estimated at 126-80 mya 
(Wikstroém et al. 2001; Anderson 
et al. 2005; Sytsma 
et al. 2006; Soltis et al. 2008b; Janssens et al. 2009; Ma- 
gallon and Castillo 2009; Bell et al. 2010; Lemaire et al. 
2011a). Several extinct genera, based on well-preserved 
fossil flowers—for example, Palaeoenkianthus (Nixon and 
Crepet 1993), and Raritaniflora (Crepet et al. 2013) from 
New Jersey, extend the Ericales back to the Late Cretaceous 
(Turonian; ~92 mya) (Martinez-Millan 2010; Friis et al. 
2011; see also Schénenberger et al. 2005) (Supplementary 
Tabledich): 
Ericales differ from most other asterids in the common 
occurrence of ellagic acid, a compound frequently found 
outside the clade (see Chapter 8, Fig. 8.7a) and stamens 
usually twice the number of petals (to numerous; vs. sta- 
men number equaling or fewer than the number of petals 
in the euasterids). A possible synapomorphy for the clade is 
the presence of protruding, diffuse placentae (Nandi et al. 
1998). Another uniting character is the theoid tooth type in 
which a single vein enters the tooth and ends in an opaque 
deciduous cap or gland (Hickey and Wolfe 1975; Judd 
et al. 2002, 2008). 
In Schénenberger et al. (2005) and D. Soltis et al. (2011), 
a well-supported clade (100% BS in Soltis et al. 2011) com- 
posed of Marcgraviaceae + (Tetrameristaceae + Balsamina- 
ceae) is sister to the rest of Ericales (BS = 95%), although 
interrelationships within the latter are mostly poorly sup- 
ported or unresolved. Well-supported subclades in the rest 
of Ericales are Lecythidaceae, Fouquieriaceae + Polemo- 
niaceae, Sapotaceae + (Ebenaceae + Primulaceae s.1.) (well- 
supported in Schonenberger et al. 2005, but not in Soltis 
et al. 2011), Pentaphylacaceae, Theaceae, Symplocaceae, 
Styracaceae, Diapensiaceae, and Sarraceniaceae + (Roridu- 
laceae +Actinidiaceae), which is sister to a clade composed 
of Clethraceae + (Cyrillaceae + Ericaceae). In D. Soltis et al. 
(2011) Lecythidaceae form the second diverging clade that 
is poorly supported (BS = 67%) as sister to the rest, al- 
though this is unresolved in Schénenberger et al. (2005). 
Fouquieriaceae and Polemoniaceae form a well-supported 
clade that is sister to the remaining members, although this 
also is very poorly supported (BS = 53%) and unresolved 
in Schénenberger et al. (2005). The only other resolved 
relationship is the clade ((Sarraceniaceae + (Roridulaceae 
+Actinidiaceae) + Clethraceae + (Cyrillaceae + Ericaceae)). 
Descriptions of these subclades within Ericales follow. 
With three, four, six, 11, or 17 genes combined, the 
backbone of the tree for Ericales is mostly unresolved 
(Fig. 11.10), with few interfamilial relationships receiv- 
ing strong support. However, as noted, the clade of Tet- 
rameristaceae (including Pellicieraceae), Marcgraviaceae, 
and Balsaminaceae is strongly supported (Morton et al. 
1996; Savolainen et al. 2000b; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Al- 
bach et al. 2001c; Anderberg et al. 2002; Bremer et al. 
2002) and occupies a pivotal position as sister to the rest 
of Ericales. Marcgraviaceae are sister to Balsaminaceae + 
Tetrameristaceae (including Pellicieraceae). A close rela- 
tionship among Tetrameristaceae (including Pellicieraceae), 
Marcgraviaceae, and Balsaminaceae (Fig. 11.10) had never 
been proposed. These families differ in habit, varying from 
herbaceous (Balsaminaceae) to woody climbers and shrubs 
(Marcgraviaceae). However, they share specialized nec- 
taries or glands on leaves, sepals, or petals (Morton et al. 
1996), mostly simple perforation plates in vessels, and hy- 
pogynous flowers (Albach et al. 2001c). Von Balthazar and 
Schonenberger (2013) found additional shared features: 
broad and dorsiventrally flattened filaments, thread-like 
structures lining the stomia of dehisced anthers, secretory 
inner primary morphological surfaces of the gynoecium, 
ovules intermediate between uni- and bitegmic, incom- 
pletely tenuinucellar ovules, fruits with persistent style and 
stigma, and seeds lacking endosperm. Oxalate druses are 
absent; members of the clade instead form oxalate raphides 
(Nandi et al. 1998). 
Balsaminaceae and Tetrameristaceae share a caducous 
calyx, postgenital coherence of filaments and ovary, la- 
trorse anther dehiscence, commissural carpel lobes and 
ovules with a thickened funiculus and a constricted chala- 
zal region (von Balthazar and Sch6nenberger 2013). Marc- 
graviaceae and Tetrameristaceae also exhibit several wood 
features, such as vasicentric axial parenchyma and high and 
wide multiseriate rays with heterocellular body ray cells in 
Marcgraviaceae, and apotracheal and paratracheal axial 
parenchyma in Tetrameristaceae. Both Marcgraviaceae and 
Tetrameristaceae have raphides (Lens et al. 2007). 
Fossil Ericaceae are recognized by the distinctive perma- 
nent tetrads known from the Paleocene (Fig. 11.17c) and 
younger strata and by dispersed winged seeds from the Pa- 
leocene of England (Collinson and Crane 1978) and late 
Eocene of California (Wang and Tiffney 2001). 
Pollen of Sapotaceae is sufficiently distinctive to be rec- 
ognized as dispersed fossil grains. Examples are known 
from the Paleocene up to the Miocene worldwide (e.g., 
Muller 1981; Manchester et al. 2015). Ebenaceae pollen 
have a distinctive micro-ornamentation of organized mi- 
crorugulate sculpture. Such pollen has been identified as 
dispersed grains from the late Eocene of Florissant, Colo- 
rado (Manchester 2015), and from Eocene flowers named 
Austrodiospyros cryptostoma with in situ pollen from 
late Eocene of Anglesea, Victoria, Australia (Basinger and 
Christophel 1985). 
Polemoniaceae and Fouquieriaceae form another small 
clade within Ericales (Fig. 11.10) (Anderberg et al. 2002; 

Figure 11.14.

270 Chapter 11 
Bremer et al. 2002; Schénenberger et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 
2011). A sister-group relationship of Polemoniaceae and 
Fouquieriaceae is consistent with the morphological simi- 
larity observed between Fouquieria (Fouquieriaceae) and 
Acanthogilia, one of the basalmost nodes within Polemo- 
niaceae (Nash 1903; Henrickson 1967; Hufford 1992; 
Johnson et al. 1996), and biochemistry (Scogin 1977, 
1978). Schonenberger et al. (2010) found more similarities 
between the two families: cochlear and quincuncial corolla 
aestivation, connective protrusions, ventrifixed anthers, 
and nectariferous tissue at the base of the ovary. The fossil 
record has yielded little information for this clade, with the 
exception of a single relatively complete fossil Gilisenium 
hueberi, based on a single specimen showing a plant with 
the roots, leaves, and fruits assignable to Polemoniaceae 
from the middle Eocene of Utah (Lott et al. 1998). 
The relationships of Fouquieriaceae and Polemoniaceae 
to the primuloid clade (Primulaceae s.1.; discussed below) 
remain unresolved. Polemoniaceae are sister to the primu- 
loid clade in both D. Soltis et al. (2000) and Albach et al. 
(2001c); this relationship appears in the strict consensus 
tree of the former study and received weak (BS = 61%) sup- 
port in the latter analysis. However, in both studies, Fou- 
quieriaceae appear elsewhere in Ericales. Non-DNA char- 
acters also indicate a close relationship of Polemoniaceae 
to the primuloid group. Primuloids and Polemoniaceae 
share nuclear endosperm and simple perforation plates in 
vessels (see Albach et al. 2001c). Neither character is re- 
stricted to these two groups within Ericales, but they occur 
in combination elsewhere only in Sapotaceae. 
Another character shared by at least some members of 
the primuloid clade and Polemoniaceae is the occurrence 
of separate sepals in Cobaea, Polemonium, and some gen- 
era of Primulaceae s.1. (Theophrastaceae and Myrsinaceae), 
generally a rare condition among sympetalous plants (Steb- 
bins 1974). Additionally, Primulaceae and Polemoniaceae 
both initiate stamens earlier than petal primordia (Nishino 
1978, 1983), but this needs more study. Polemoniaceae and 
Primulaceae share many biochemical characters, such as 
the presence of cucurbitacins, and plants in both families 
excrete methylated 6- or 8-oxygenated flavonols from glan- 
dular hairs (Hegnauer 1962-1994). 
The polyphyly of Theaceae was noted earlier with the 
placement of Asteropeia (now Asteropeiaceae) 
within 
Caryophyllales (this Chapter) and the placement of sub- 
family Bonnetioideae (now Bonnetiaceae) within Mal- 
pighiales (Chapter 10; Savolainen et al. 2000b). The two 
remaining former subfamilies of Theaceae (Theoideae, 
Ternstroemioideae) have not formed a clade in any mo- 
lecular analyses (e.g., Morton et al. 1996; Savolainen et al. 
2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer 
et al. 2002; Schénenberger et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2011), 
supporting the recognition of two separate families (APG 
1998), Theaceae and Ternstroemiaceae (the latter included 
in Pentaphylacaceae; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 
2016). 
Theaceae and Pentaphylacaceae differ in embryological 
characters (curved rather than straight embryo in the lat- 
ter; Tsou 1995) and floral characters, including fruit and 
stamen morphology. The phylogenetic positions of the two 
families within Ericales are not clear, but they repeatedly 
appear as part of different clades. Savolainen et al. (2000b) 
first showed that the monogeneric Sladeniaceae should be 
added to Ericales, as 
a member of Ternstroemiaceae (now 
Pentaphylacaceae); however, APG III (2009) and Stevens 
(2012) recognized Sladenia in its own family, separate from 
Pentaphylacaceae (see also APG IV 2016). The DNA-based 
position of Sladenia in Ericales is in general agreement 
with the treatments of Dahlgren (1980) and Cronquist 
(1981), who placed Sladeniaceae in Theales/Theaceae, the 
component members of which are found in Ericales as cir- 
cumscribed here. In a more recent study, Anderberg et al. 
(2002) found Sladenia and Ficalhoa (Theaceae) to be a 
weakly supported (51%) sister group to a well-supported 
(96%) clade of Pentaphylacaceae 
+ Ternstroemiaceae. 
Bremer et al. (2002) found stronger support (72%) for a 
clade of Sladenia as sister to Pentaphylacaceae + Ternstroe- 
miaceae, but they did not include Ficalhoa in their analy- 
. 
sis. In Bremer et al. (2001), Ternstroemiaceae appear with 
Sladeniaceae and Pentaphylacaceae in a weakly supported 
(72% jackknife) clade now referred to as a broadly defined 
Pentaphylacaceae (sensu APG II 2003). In D. Soltis et al. 
(2000), Albach et al. (2001c), and Bremer et al. (2002), the 
narrowly defined Theaceae are sister to the clade of Symp- 
locaceae (Diapensiaceae + Styracaceae), but this relation- 
ship received support above 50% (52% jackknife) only in 
Bremer et al. (2001) and has not been supported in subse- 
quent multigene analyses (Sch6nenberger et al. 2005; Soltis 
et al. 2011) where the relationship of Theaceae and other 
clades was unresolved. 
Diospyros (Ebenaceae) and Lissocarpa (Lissocarpaceae) 
are strongly supported sisters (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Berry 
et al. 2001; Anderberg et al. 2002; Schonenberger et al. 
2005) or sister to a Diospyros + (Euclea + Royena) clade in 
Duangjai et al. (2006, 2009). Savolainen et al. (2000b) sug- 
gested that Lissocarpa might be a member of Sapindales, 
but this placement was based on an rbcL sequence obtained 
from degraded DNA. The placement of Lissocarpaceae as 
a close relative of Ebenaceae agrees with morphological 
data; the two families share similar floral morphology and 
wood anatomy, differing chiefly in that Lissocarpa has an 
inferior ovary (Cronquist 1981; Berry et al. 2001; Ander- 

berg et al. 2002). On the basis of molecular‘’and morpho- 
logical evidence, Lissocarpaceae have been included within 
Ebenaceae (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
Recent studies have illuminated considerable phylogenetic 
structure within Ebenaceae, especially in the widespread 
genus Diospyros (Duangjai et al. 2009). 
Molecular analyses revealed a well-supported primuloid 
clade of Primulaceae, Myrsinaceae, and Theophrastaceae, 
and Maesaceae, a family consisting only of Maesa (formerly 
of Myrsinaceae; Anderberg et al. 2000, 2002; Kallersjo 
et al. 2000), all four of which have been recircumscribed as 
part of Primulaceae s.]. (APG If 2009; APG IV 2016). This 
primuloid clade corresponds to Cronquist’s (1981) Primu- 
lales and is strongly supported by both molecular (D. Soltis 
et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c) and morphological (Cron- 
quist 1981; Anderberg and Stahl 1995) data. This clade is 
united by free central placentation and stamens equal in 
number and opposite the corolla lobes (Fig. 11.13j); free 
central placentation is an unusual feature, occurring also 
in Santalales and Lentibulariaceae (as reviewed in this 
Chapter, some Caryophyllales have secondarily free central 
placentation). Maesaceae are sister to the remainder of the 
primuloid clade, followed by Theophrastaceae as sister to 
Myrsinaceae + Primulaceae (Anderberg et al. 2002; Bremer 
et al. 2002; Schonenberger et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2011), 
all of which now constitute a broadly defined Primulaceae 
(APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
Diapensiaceae and Styracaceae (including Halesiaceae) 
form a clade with low to moderate (D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2011) 
or high support (Schonenberger et al. 2005). Strongest sup- 
port is provided by the six-gene analysis of Bremer et al. 
(2002) and the 11-locus analysis of Schénenberger et al. 
(2005). In contrast to previous analyses based on rbcL 
(Morton et al. 1996) that showed Halesia and other genera 
of Styracaceae to be only distantly related to Styrax, mul- 
tigene analyses of Bremer et al. (2002) and Schonenberger 
et al. (2005) found Styracaceae (including Halesia) to form 
a well-supported clade with 100% bootstrap support and 
1.0 posterior probability, respectively (see also Kron 1996). 
Characters that unite Styracaceae and Diapensiaceae in- 
clude calcium oxalate crystals, unitegmic ovules (but not 
in all Styracaceae), unilacunar nodes, cellular endosperm, 
and binucleate pollen (Albach et al. 2001c; see also Morton 
et al. 1996). The two families also share the Chenopodium 
variant of polygonad type embryo formation (Yamazaki 
1974). These characters (except polygonad embryo forma- 
tion) are also present in Symplocaceae. Symplocaceae ap- 
pear as sister to Styracaceae + Diapensiaceae in the six-gene 
analysis (Bremer et al. 2002) and the 11-locus analysis of 
Schonenberger et al. (2005). The fossil record of this clade 
Superasterids 
271 
includes reports of Styracaceae, such as Rehderodendron 
fruits from the Eocene to Miocene of Europe (Mai 1970; 
Vaudois-Miéja 1983; Manchester et al. 2009), seeds of Sty- 
rax from the European Miocene (Kirchheimer 1957), and 
of Symplocaceae with an excellent fossil record of endo- 
carps, reviewed by Mai and Martinetto (2006). The oldest 
known occurrences of Symplocos fruits are from the early 
Eocene of London Clay (Reid and Chandler 1933; Fritsch 
et al. 2014). 
Both molecular and morphological studies have pro- 
vided compelling evidence for a broadly defined Erica- 
ceae that includes Pyrolaceae, Monotropaceae, Epacrida- 
ceae, and Empetraceae (Anderberg 1993; Judd and Kron 
1993; Kron and Chase 1993; Kron 1996; Kron et al. 2002; 
Kron and Luteyn 2005; Schonenberger et al. 2005; Brauk- 
mann and Stefanovié 2012). Ericaceae are part of a larger 
clade (sometimes referred to as the core Ericales; see Judd 
et al. 2002, 2008) that also includes Actinidiaceae, Sar- 
raceniaceae, Roridulaceae, Cyrillaceae, and Clethraceae 
(Fig. 11.10; Albach et al. 2000c; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000; Bremer et al. 2002; Schonenberger 
et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Within the core Ericales, Sarraceniaceae, Actinidiaceae, 
and Roridulaceae form one subclade (Bremer et al. 2002; 
Sch6nenberger et al. 2005), with the second subclade con- 
sisting of Clethraceae as sister to a clade of Cyrillaceae and 
a broadly defined Ericaceae. Core Ericales is characterized 
by inverted anthers, a usually hollow style that emerges 
from an apical depression in the ovary, and endosperm 
with haustoria at both ends (Anderberg 1992, 1993; Judd 
and Kron 1993; Kron and Chase 1993; Kron 1996); this 
group also contains all of the iridoid-producing genera of 
Ericales except Fouquieria and Symplocos (Albach et al. 
2001c). 
Sarraceniaceae and Roridulaceae are carnivorous (see 
Chapter 13). Sarraceniaceae produce water-filled, pitcher- 
like leaves trapping insects or other small animals that are 
then digested; Roridulaceae trap insects with glandular 
hairs on the leaves; the insects are then consumed by species 
of the insect hemipteran genus Pameridea (Miridae). The 
waste products of the consumed insects are then taken up 
by the plants in these nutrient-poor environments (Givnish 
2014; Sadowski et al. 2014). Eocene fossils of Roridula- 
ceae have recently been found in Baltic amber (Sadowski 
et al. 2014), which coincide with molecular dates for the 
Actinidiaceae + Roridulaceae (Ellison et al. 2012), and 
suggest that the plant family was much more widespread 
in the past and currently exhibits a relictual distribution 
(Sadowski et al. 2014). Actinidia has also been recognized 
back to the Eocene based on seeds (Fig. 11.17a,b; Man- 
chester 1994), and Actinidiaceae have been traced to the 

272 Chapter 11 
late Cretaceous (late Santonian) based on flowers and fruits 
of Parasaurauia allonensis (Keller et al. 1996) and Glandu- 
localyx (Schonenberger et al. 2012). Sarraceniaceae, a New 
World family, also apparently were much more widespread 
in the Eocene of the Americas but now occupy vastly re- 
duced distributions (Ellison et al. 2012). 
Numerous families within Ericales are aluminum accu- 
mulators (Jansen et al. 2004), although there does not seem 
to be any phylogenetic signal to this character. Sch6nen- 
berger et al. (2005) found that sympetaly likely evolved 
either two or three times in the clade. The two-whorled an- 
droecium of certain clades evolved either once or twice, and 
the single-integumented ovary evolved four times. Cellular 
endosperm formation is plesiomorphic, and nuclear endo- 
sperm formation derived in the clade; however, a reversal 
to cellular endosperm formation happened 1-3 times. The 
study of morphological evolution in Ericales is still prema- 
ture, however, until more robust phylogenetic relationships 
among major clades can be established (Schénenberger 
et al. 2005). 
Several families of Ericales have been the focus of more 
detailed phylogenetic studies, including Ericaceae s.]. (Kron 
and Chase 1993; Kron 1996, 1997; Kron et al. 2002; Kron 
and Luteyn 2005; Braukmann and Stefanovié 2012), Pri- 
mulaceae and related families (Anderberg et al. 1998, 2002; 
Mast et al. 2001; Trift et al. 2002; Martins et al. 2003), Po- 
lemoniaceae (Johnson and Soltis 1995; Johnson et al. 1996, 
1999; Johnson et al. 2008), Diapensiaceae (ROnblom and 
Anderberg 2002), Actinidiaceae (Li et al. 2002), Styraca- 
ceae (Fritsch 2001), and Ebenaceae and related families 
(Morton et al. 1996; Duangjai et al. 2006, 2009; Turner 
et al. 2013). Also, numerous members of Ericales show very 
interesting patterns of neo- and paleopolyploidy and have 
been studied in some detail (e.g., Actinidia, Actinidiaceae; 
Chat et al. 2004; Shi et al. 2010). 
EUASTERIDS (LAMIIDS 
AND CAMPANULIDS) 
Euasterid families (Fig. 11.10) have flowers with epipetal- 
ous stamens that equal the corolla lobes in number and a 
gynoecium of usually two fused carpels. Molecular analy- 
ses have provided strong support for this clade and also 
indicated the presence of two subclades of euasterids— 
lamiids (Garryidae; euasterid I) and campanulids (Cam- 
panulidae; euasterid I; Olmstead et al. 1993; D. Soltis et al. 
2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Jansen et al. 
2007; Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Soltis et al. 2011; Ruhfel 
et al. 2014). Euasterid I and II were used in the APG II 
(2003) classification. Several recent publications (Moore 
et al. 2011; Soltis et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014) have 
referred to these groups as Lamiidae and Campanulidae 
(sensu Cantino et al. 2007). We will use the names lamiids 
(asterids I) and campanulids (asterids II) (per Bremer et al. 
2002), as done in APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016) and 
in Chapter 12. 
An analysis by Bremer, et al. (2001) of 142 genera us- 
ing 143 morphological; anatomical, embryological, paly- 
nological, chemical, and RFLP (restriction fragment length 
polymorphisms) characters recovered some groups (mostly 
families and small groups of families) supported by DNA 
sequence data and recognized by APG (1998), but the anal- 
ysis identified only one order, Dipsacales, of the eight APG 
orders of euasterids. Furthermore, lamiids and campanulids 
were not distinguished until rbcL and ndhF sequences were 
added to the analysis (Bremer et al. 2001). Thus, although 
morphological and other nonmolecular data contain phy- 
logenetic signal, it is not sufficiently strong to discern all of 
the groups identified by molecular data. 
Lamiids are generally characterized by opposite leaves, 
entire leaf margins, hypogynous flowers, “early sympetaly” 
with a ring-shaped corolla primordium, fusion of stamen 
filaments with the corolla tube, and capsular fruits (Bremer 
et al. 2001). Taxa appearing in campanulids typically have 
alternate leaves, serrate-dentate leaf margins, epigynous 
flowers, free stamen filaments, indehiscent fruits, and “late 
sympetaly” with distinct petal primordia (Bremer et al. 
2001). Although these morphological features are useful as 
general descriptors, it is unclear which are synapomorphies 
and which are symplesiomorphies, and both reversals and 
parallelisms have generated many exceptions to these gen- 
eral patterns. 
Lamiids 
The lamiid clade (asterid I sensu Chase et al. 1993; lamiids 
sensu Bremer et al. 2002; euasterid I sensu APG II 2003) re- 
ceived only weak (56% bootstrap) support with three genes 
(D. Soltis et al. 2000), but support has increased greatly 
(86%) in four gene (Albach et al. 2001c), six gene (100% 
jackknife support; Bremer et al. 2002), 10 gene (96%; 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014) and 17 gene anal- 
yses (100% bootstrap support; Soltis et al. 2011). Within 
the lamiid clade, Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) 
found that Icacinaceae s.s. (including only Icacina and 
Cassinopsis) formed a clade sister to a Metteniusaceae- 
Oncothecaceae clade, which was sister to Garryales plus 
the rest of the lamiids. However, Icacinaceae s.]. are known 
to be non-monophyletic (Karehed 2001; Bremer et al. 
2002; Lens et al. 2008; Byng et al. 2014), so additional 
taxon sampling in future studies will be needed to resolve

the placement of all members traditionally placed in that 
family. For example, some traditional members of Icaci- 
naceae are now placed in Stemonuraceae of Aquifoliales 
(campanulids, see below) and several other members of tra- 
ditional Icacinaceae have been shown to be actually part of 
Metteniusaceae (Stull et al. 2015; Byng et al. 2014). Most 
recent analyses based on plastome data find that Icacina- 
ceae + Oncothecaceae form a well-supported clade sister 
to Metteniusaceae and Garryales + the rest of the lamiids 
(Stull-et al. 2015; Fig. 11.15). 
The remaining lamiids are strongly supported as mono- 
phyletic and consist of Gentianales, Solanales, Boraginales, 

274 Chapter 11 
Lamiales, as well as Vahlia (Vahliaceae) (Fig. 11.15; repre- 
sentatives are illustrated in Fig. 11.16-11.19; Soltis et al.

previous studies provided poor resolution for relation- 
ships among these major clades, especially considering the 
problematic placement of Boraginaceae, both the broad 
angiosperm phylogeny of D. Soltis et al. (2011) and the 
lamiid-focused phylogeny of Refulio-Rodriguez and Olm- 
stead (2014) recovered Boraginaceae as sister to Lamiales. 
Boraginaceae + Lamiales is sister to Solanales + Vahliaceae 
in Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) and sister to 
a Solanales + Gentianales in Soltis et al. (2011). Refulio- 
Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) recover Gentianales as 
sister to the Solanales, Vahliaceae, Boraginaceae + Lamiales 
clade. Vahliaceae were recovered as sister to Solanales in 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) and sister to a So- 
lanales, Gentianales, Boraginaceae, Lamiales clade in Soltis 
et al. (2011). 
Although APG recognizes a broadly circumscribed Bo- 
raginaceae s.|., including Hydrophyllaceae and the para- 
sitic Lennoaceae, others split the group into numerous (ca. 
eight to eleven) families (Gottschling and Hilger 2001; 
Gottschling et al. 2001, 2005; Hilger and Diane 2003; Wei- 
gend and Hilger 2010; Cohen 2013; Weigend et al. 2013; 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014; Luebert 
et al. 
2016). However, topological problems (i.e., incongruence) 
in resultant phylogenies based on either plastid or nuclear 
loci (e.g., Hydrophyllaceae 
s.l. are monophyletic using 
nuclear ribosomal loci but non-monophyletic using plas- 
tid data), make the split into numerous families premature 
(Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014). 
ICACINALES AND METTENIUSALES 
The relationships of Oncothecaceae, Metteniusaceae, and 
Icacinaceae to each other and other lamiid families have 
long been problematic, although they, with Garryales (be- 
low), consistently appear as the basalmost lineages of the 
clade (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Bremer et al. 2002; Gonzales 
et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olm- 
stead 2014). In some analyses, Icacinaceae appeared (with 
weak support) as sister to Garryales (D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Gonzalez et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2011). In the strict con- 
sensus of shortest trees obtained in B. Bremer et al. (2002), 
Oncothecaceae and Icacinaceae form a clade that is sister 
to the remainder of lamiids, although neither relationship 
received bootstrap support above 50%. Metteniusaceae 
are poorly known and only recently have been shown to 
belong here (Gonzalez et al. 2007). Gonzalez et al. (2007) 
found Oncothecaceae and Metteniusaceae to be the sub- 
sequent sisters to all lamiids excluding a clade of Garry- 
ales + Icacinaceae, which they found to be sister to the rest 
of lamiids, including Oncothecaceae and Metteniusaceae. 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) recovered a clade 
composed of Icacinaceae + (Oncothecaceae + Metteniusa- 
ceae), which was supported (96 % bootstrap) as sister to 
the rest of the lamiids (including Garryales). Most recent 
analyses, which included numerous members of traditional 
Icacinaceae s.1., recovered Icacinaceae s.s. 
+ Oncothecaceae 
as sister to a clade of Metteniusaceae (Garryales + core 
lamiids) (Stull et al. 2015). These are recognized as Icaci- 
nales (Icacinaceae + Oncothecaceae) and Metteniusales 
(including only Metteniusaceae) in APG IV (2016) and 
Chapter 12. 
Icacinaceae as previously circumscribed are polyphy- 
letic (see also Aquifoliales below, Stemonuraceae). Icacina 
and related genera such as Cassinopsis and Pyrenacantha 
(Icacinaceae s.s.) form a well-supported clade and are part 
of lamiids (Fig. 11.15); several studies pointed to a close re- 
lationship of these genera to Garryales, but without strong 
bootstrap support (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Karehed 2002; 
Gonzalez et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 2011; Byng et al. 2014). 
Several other genera previously attributed to Icacinaceae 
are part of either Cardiopteridaceae or a new family, Ste- 
monuraceae, both placed in Aquifoliales of the campanu- 
lid clade (Karehed 2002; APG III 2009; Soltis et al. 2011; 
APG IV 2016; see Aquifoliales below). Also, as mentioned 
above, numerous genera attributed to Icacinaceae s.]. be- 
- 
long in Metteniusaceae (Stull et al. 2015; see nomencla- 
ture section below). Members of Icacinaceae have been the 
subjects of systematic and phylogenetic work (Angulo et al. 
2013; Byng et al. 2014). 
Among the genera retained in Icacinaceae sensu stricto, 
fruits often have very distinctive endocarp morphology 
with reticulate external ribbing and/or tubercles that pro- 
trude into the locule (Figs. 11.16d, 11.17i). These features 
facilitate the recognition of fossil representatives includ- 
ing both extinct and extant genera common in the Eocene 
(Fig. 11.17 h,j-l) and extending back at least to the mid- 
Paleocene (Stull et al. 2012) (Supplementary Table 11.1). 
Oncothecaceae consist of two species (evergreen trees or 
shrubs) native to New Caledonia. Cronquist (1981) placed 
the family in his Theales (Dilleniidae), noting that it was 
poorly studied and distinctive in morphology. Takhtajan 
(1997) considered Metteniusaceae closely related to Icaci- 
nales. Metteniusaceae and Oncothecaceae share pentala- 
cunar nodes and five-carpellate gynoecia (Gonzalez and 
Rudall 2010). Also, Emmotum (Icacinaceae s.s.) is five 
carpellate (Endress and Rapini 2014). Additional data will 
be required to determine how these characters evolved in 
these basal lamiids. However, considering recent topologies 
(Fig. 11.15), it is likely that those morphological characters

GARRYALES 
Garryales consist of Eucommiaceae and Garryaceae (in- 
cluding Aucuba) (Figs. 11.15 and 11.16, 11.17). In APG 
(1998), the order also included Oncothecaceae, but that 
placement was premature; it did not receive support above 
50% in D. Soltis et al. (2000) and has been unsupported 
in subsequent analyses (Gonzalez et al. 2007; Soltis et al. 
2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014; Stull et al. 
2015). Eucommiaceae and Garryaceae were not considered 
closely related in morphology-based classifications, but this 
clade was recovered in analyses of rbcL alone (Olmstead 
et al. 1993; Xiang et al. 1993; Savolainen et al. 2000b), as 
well as in combined analyses (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000; Al- 
bach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Gonz4lez et al. 2007; 
Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014; 
Stull et al. 2015). Most recent analyses suggest a sister rela- 
tionship of Garryales to the core lamiids (Stull et al. 2015). 
Possible 
morphological 
synapomorphies 
for Garry- 
ales are unisexual flowers (with dioecious plants), infe- 
rior ovaries, the gynoecium with a single short style and 
apical placentation, as well as the presence of gutta and 
valvate perianth parts (Stevens 2001 onwards), although 
there are parallelisms in Aquifoliales and Apiales of the 
campanulids (Bremer et al. 2001). Eucommiaceae, which 
have a wide fossil distribution in the Northern Hemisphere 
(e.g., Fig. 11.17f; Manchester et al. 2009), today consist 
of a single species from China that was placed in Hama- 
melidae in morphology-based classifications because of the 
simple nature of the flowers (Cronquist 1981). A close re- 
lationship of the family to Garryaceae is another example 
of an unexpected result of molecular systematic studies. 
Garryaceae are now broadly defined to include Aucuba, 
as well as Garrya (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 
2016; see Soltis et al. 2011; see also Chapter 12). Although 
the sister-group relationship between Garrya and Aucuba 
received strong support in molecular phylogenetic studies 
(e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; Al- 
bach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014), the two were not considered closely 
related in morphology-based classifications 
(e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981). However, a close relationship between Garrya 
and Aucuba was first proposed by Baillon (1866-1895), 
and this relationship is supported by several non-DNA 
characters, including palynological data (Ferguson 1977), 
the presence of petroselinic acid in seed oils (Breuer et al. 
1987), two-seeded fruits lacking a septum, and a similar 
gynoecial vasculature (Eyde 1964). In addition, both Gar- 
Superasterids 
277 
rya and Aucuba are dioecious, evergreen shrubs or small 
trees with tetramerous flowers and opposite leaves. Non- 
DNA characters also unite Eucommiaceae with Garrya and 
Aucuba. All three are dioecious and woody, and contain 
similar iridoid compounds; aucubin has been detected in 
all three genera (Jensen et al. 1975), and eucommioside has 
been found in Eucommia and Aucuba (Boros and Stermitz 
1991). Garryales have been dated to between 96-31 mya 
(Wikstrom et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2010; Lemaire et al. 
2011a; Naumann et al. 2013). Extant Eucommia and Gar- 
rya are illustrated in Fig. 
11.16a-c. 
GENTIANALES 
Gentianales constitute a well-supported clade of Apocy- 
naceae (including Asclepiadaceae), Gelsemiaceae, Genti- 
anaceae, Loganiaceae, and Rubiaceae (Fig. 11.15; several 
are illustrated in Fig. 11.16). Gentianales comprise about 
1,100 genera and nearly 20,000 species. Although Emblin- 
gia (Emblingiaceae: Brassicales) was placed in Gentianales 
by Savolainen et al. (2000b), this appears to be the result of 
a DNA mix-up (see Chapter 10). Dialypetalanthaceae, con- 
sisting of one species in eastern Brazil, should be included 
in Rubiaceae (Fay et al. 2000a; Savolainen et al. 2000b). 
A close relationship among these families of Gentianales 
had long been proposed in classifications based solely on 
morphology. Cronquist (1981), for example, had a similar 
Gentianales but also recognized Retziaceae (= Stilbaceae, 
now included in Lamiales); like most authors at that time, 
Cronquist also included Asclepiadaceae as a family distinct 
from Apocynaceae. 
Synapomorphies for Gentianales include vestured pits, 
stems with a nodal line, opposite and decussate leaves, 
and stipules with thick glandular hairs 
(i.e., colleters, 
Fig. 11.16m; these were lost in most Gentianaceae; Back- 
lund et al. 2000), corollas convolute in bud (Bremer and 
Struwe 1992), and possibly some types of complex indole 
alkaloids (Bremer et al. 2001; Judd et al. 2002, 2008). Ru- 
biaceae are sister to the remainder of the clade using DNA 
sequence data (Downie and Palmer 1992; Chase et al. 
1993; Olmstead et al. 1993; Bremer et al. 1994; Backlund 
et al. 2000; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Refulio-Rodriguez et al. 2014). However, a morphological 
cladistic analysis (Struwe et al. 1994) placed Rubiaceae sis- 
ter to Gelsemiaceae and Loganiaceae s.s. as sister to the 
remaining Gentianales. Phylogenetic relationships within 
Rubiaceae have been analyzed using morphology (e.g., 
Bremer and Struwe 1992), DNA characters (e.g., Manen 
et al. 1994; Bremer et al. 1995, 1999; Andersson and Rova 
1999; Andersson and Antonelli 2005; Maurin et al. 2007; 

278 Chapter 11 
Bremer and Eriksson 2009; Groeninckx et al. 2009; Le- 
maire et al. 2011b), and combined morphology and DNA 
datasets (Andreasen and Bremer 2000). 
The fossil record of Rubiaceae includes dispersed pol- 
len and occasional megafossil occurrences (Graham 2008). 
A relatively early, secure megafossil record of Rubiaceae is 
that of permineralized fruiting capsules with intact winged 
seeds attributed to the Condamineeae genus Emmenop- 
terys from the middle Eocene of Oregon (Fig. 11.17n-p; 
Manchester 1994). 
Following Rubiaceae, a clade of the remaining families 
(Apocynaceae, Gelsemiaceae, Gentianaceae, Loganiaceae) 
received moderate to strong support in analyses based 
on three or four genes (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 
2001c) and strong support in Bremer et al. (2002), Soltis 
et al. (2011), and Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014). 
This clade of four families also shares a feature of wood 
anatomy; all Gentianales except Rubiaceae are character- 
ized by intraxylary phloem (Carlquist 1992). Relationships 
among these four families, however, are not completely re- 
solved. There is weak bootstrap support (<65%) for Loga- 
niaceae as sister to Gentianaceae and for Apocynaceae as 
sister to Gelsemiaceae in D. Soltis et al. (2000). In contrast, 
in Bremer et al. (2002), Apocynaceae are sister to Gentiana- 
ceae (95% jackknife support), and Gelsemiaceae are sister 
to Loganiaceae (85% support), relationships also found 
by Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014), although not 
well-supported. Soltis et al. (2011) recovered Loganiaceae 
and Gelsemiaceae as subsequent sisters to a moderately 
(86%) well-supported Gentianaceae + Apocynaceae clade. 
Adding to the uncertainty in relationships is the poly- 
phyly or paraphyly of Loganiaceae as previously defined 
(e.g., Chase et al. 1993; Olmstead et al. 1993; Bremer et al. 
1994; Struwe et al. 1994; Backlund et al. 2000). Fagraea 
and Potalia (traditionally placed in Loganiaceae) should be 
placed in Gentianaceae; Gelsemium and Mostuea are well 
separated from other Loganiaceae and have been treated 
as a separate family, Gelsemiaceae (reviewed in Judd et al. 
2002, 2008; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). 
Phylogenetic analyses of both molecular and non-DNA 
characters indicated that Asclepiadaceae and Apocyna- 
ceae should be combined to form a single family, Apocyna- 
ceae (Judd et al. 1994; Endress and Bruyns 2000). Apocy- 
naceae in this broad sense are united by several non-DNA 
characters, including tissues with laticifers and usually 
milky sap, carpels postgenitally united by styles and/or stig- 
mas with ovaries usually distinct, and the apical portion of 
the style expanded and modified to form a secretory head 
(Fig. 11.16; Judd et al. 1994). Relationships within Apocy- 
naceae have been the subject of numerous phylogenetic 
analyses (Judd et al. 1994; Endress et al. 1996; Sennblad 
and Bremer 1996; Civeyrel et al. 1998; Endress and Stevens 
2001; Potgieter and Albert 2001; Fishbein et al. 2011), and 
Straub et al. (2014) recently resolved the backbone phylog- 
eny of the family using complete plastome sequence data. 
Studies have enhanced our knowledge of the ecological and 
herbivore defense strategies often employed by members 
of Asclepias, formerly Asclepiadaceae, as well as morpho- 
logical evolution in the group (Fishbein 2001; Agrawal and 
Fishbein 2006, 2008; Agrawal et al. 2008, 2009a-c). The 
family exhibits a stepwise series of morphological modifi- 
cations to the androecium and gynoecium that appear to 
be associated with increased specialization and efficiency 
of pollination (Schick 1980, 1982; Judd et al. 1994, 2002, 
2008; M. Endress 2001). Crown group ages of Gentianales 
range from 104.7-57 mya (Wikstrom et al. 2001; Bremer 
et al. 2004; Bremer and Eriksson 2009; Janssens et al. 
2009; Bell et al. 2010; Lemaire et al. 2011a). 
VAHLIACEAE 
Vahliaceae contain five species in the genus Vahlia (= Bi- 
stella) from tropical and southern Africa to northwestern 
India. Vahlia usually has been considered close to Saxi- 
fragaceae because of their free sepals and petals, alterna- 
tively included there (Cronquist 1981) or treated as a sepa- 
rate related family (e.g., Dahlgren 1980; Thorne 1992a,b; 
Takhtajan 1997). However, the DNA placement of Vahlia 
in the asterids is supported by the presence of iridoids (Al- - 
Shammary 1991) and tenuinucellate ovules. Nonetheless, 
Vahlia differs from most lamiids in having bitegmic rather 
than unitegmic ovules; bitegmic ovules also occur in Em- 
motum (Icacinaceae s.s.; Endress and Rapini 2014). 
The position of Vahliaceae in the lamiid clade remains 
uncertain. Based on rbcL sequence data, Morgan and Soltis 
(1993) first suggested that Vahlia occupies an isolated posi- 
tion as sister to Lamiales, a position it also occupies in other 
analyses of rbcL alone (e.g., Savolainen et al. 2000a) and in 
some multigene analyses (D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 
2001c). However, even in three- and four-gene analyses, 
this placement did not receive internal support above 50%. 
In Bremer et al. (2002), Vahlia is weakly supported (69%) 
as sister to Boraginaceae. Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 
(2014) recovered Vahliaceae as sister to Solanales (with BS 
< 50%), while Soltis et al. (2011) recovered Vahliaceae as 
sister to a Solanales, Gentianales, Boraginaceae, Lamiales 
clade (i.e., core Lamiidae) with BS = 100%. We illustrate 
the former placement of Vahliaceae (Fig. 11.15). Vahliaceae 
remain unplaced within the core lamiids (APG IV 2016). 
SOLANALES 
Solanales consist of (APG 1998; APG II 2003; APG III 
2009; APG IV 2016; Fig. 11.15) Convolvulaceae, Hydrole- 

aceae, Montiniaceae, Solanaceae (including Duékeodendra- 
ceae, Goetzeaceae, and Nolanaceae sensu Cronquist 198.4), 
and Sphenocleaceae (several are illustrated in Fig. 11.18). 
Solanales include about 165 genera and 4080 species. This 
molecular-based circumscription of Solanales differs from 
concepts of the order in morphology-based Classifications. 
Cronquist (1981) also included Polemoniaceae, Hy- 
drophyllaceae, and Menyanthaceae in his Solanales, but 
he did not include Montiniaceae. Montiniaceae comprise 
three genera (Montinia, Kaliphora, and Grevea), and the 
relationships of the family have long been problematic. 
Some included the family in a broadly defined Saxifraga- 
ceae (reviewed in Morgan and Soltis 1993). Montiniaceae 
are characterized by unisexual flowers, an unusual feature 
in asterids, but found also in Garryales and Aquifoliales. 
Molecular studies also clearly placed Hydrolea in Sola- 
nales. The split of Hydrophyllaceae, with Hydrolea assigned 
to Solanales and Hydrophyllum and Phacelia to Boragina- 
ceae, was first proposed by de Jussieu (1789). However, this 
inference was not accepted by Gray (1875), and modern 
morphology-based 
classifications 
included Hydrolea 
in 
Hydrophyllaceae (e.g., Cronquist 1981). Characters sepa- 
rating Hydrolea from other Hydrophyllaceae include a bi- 
locular capsule and axile placentation in the former. 
Few non-DNA characters have been identified as pos- 
sible synapomorphies for Solanales. The families of Solana- 
les have radially symmetric flowers (likely plesiomorphic) 
and a plicate, sympetalous corolla (a likely synapomorphy; 
Fig. 11.18), and the number of stamens equals the num- 
ber of petals; the pollen sacs exhibit placentoids, another 
likely, albeit non-unique, synapomorphy (i.e., pollen sac 
placentoids also occur in Lamiales). Pollen sac placentoids 
could be plesiomorphic in Solanales, if Solanales are sister 
to the Boraginales + Lamiales clade, as found in Refulio- 
Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014; see below) and would 
then be synapomorphic for Solanales + (Lamiales + Bora- 
ginales). Solanales lack iridoids (discussed below; Albach 
et al. 2001b; Bremer et al. 2001; Judd et al. 2002, 2008). 
Alternate leaves may also be a synapomorphy; however, a 
reversal to opposite leaves has occurred in Grevea (Mon- 
tiniaceae). Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae are united by 
similar alkaloids and wood with inter- and intraxylary 
phloem. 
The position of Solanales within lamiids is still unre- 
solved. Soltis et al. (2011) recovered a clade of Solanales 
and Gentianales, which was sister to a clade composed of 
Boraginaceae and Lamiales, while in Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead (2014) Solanales formed a clade with Vahli- 
aceae, which was sister to the Boraginales + Lamiales clade. 
Neither topology was well supported, however. 
Within Solanales are two major clades (Fig. 11.15): 
Montiniaceae as sister to Sphenocleaceae + Hydroleaceae: 
Superasterids 
279 
Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae (D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Bremer et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014). Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae are 
chemically distinct from other members of lamiids in the 
replacement of iridoids by tropane alkaloids (Jensen et al. 
1975; Romeike 1978). Circumscription of the major lin- 
eages within Convolvulaceae is provided by Stefanovic 
et al. (2002), and a molecular phylogenetic framework and 
provisional reclassification are available for Solanaceae 
(Olmstead et al. 1999; Olmstead and Bohs 2006). Solana- 
ceae have been shown to include Duckeodendraceae (Fay 
et al. 1998b; APG II 2003). Solanales have been dated to 
93-62 mya (Wikstrom et al. 2001; Bremer et al. 2004; Ma- 
gallon and Castillo 2009; Bell et al. 2010; Lemaire et al. 
201 1a). 
Numerous analyses have been conducted within Sola- 
naceae (e.g., Spooner et al. 1993; Olmstead and Sweere 
1994; Olmstead et al. 1999; Bohs 2005, 2007; Martins 
and Barkman 2005; Whitson and Manos 2005; Levin et al. 
2006; Smith and Baum 2006; Wees and Bohs 2007; Olm- 
stead et al. 2008; Tu et al. 2008; Knapp 2010; Sarkinen 
et al. 2013). Tomato (formerly Lycopersicon) is clearly em- 
bedded within the now megadiverse genus Solanum (e.g., 
Spooner et al. 1993; Bohs and Olmstead 1997) that con- 
tains between 1250-1700 species. Numerous studies of 
specific clades within Solanum have also been conducted 
(e.g., Bohs 2001; Knapp 2002; Spooner et al. 2004; Bennett 
2008; Peralta et al. 2008; Knapp et al. 2013). Nicotiana has 
been used as a system for the study of polyploidy (Clarkson 
et al. 2005; Leitch et al. 2008) and chromosomal evolution 
(Wu and Tanksley 2010). The non-monophyletic genus Io- 
chroma has been the subject of numerous investigations 
of pollinator shifts with concomitant floral morphologi- 
cal diversity (S. Smith et al. 2008a,b; Fenster et al. 2009; 
Smith 2010; Smith and Rausher 2011; see also Chapter 14, 
Fig. 14.1). For a discussion on the biogeography of Solana- 
ceae, see Olmstead (2013). 
BORAGINALES 
The position of Boraginales (i.e., Boraginaceae s.l. includ- 
ing Hydrophyllaceae and several other families as men- 
tioned above; see Gottschling and Hilger 2001; Gottschling 
et al. 2001, 2005; Hilger and Diane 2003; Weigend and 
Hilger 2010; Cohen 2013; Weigend et al. 2013; Refulio- 
Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014; Weigend et al. 2014; 
Luebert et al. 2016 for alternatives regarding familial cir- 
cumscription in this group) as sister to Lamiales is well sup- 
ported (Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 
2014; Fig. 11.15). Boraginaceae have usually been placed 
in or close to Solanales in morphology-based classifica- 
tions (Dahlgren 1980; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001; Takhtajan

1997) and in some molecular-based trees (eg, Chase et al. 
1993; Olmstead et al. 2000), but previous molecular analy- 
ses indicated that Boraginaceae are an isolated family with 
no clear or close relatives. With ndhF sequences, Boragi- 
naceae were recovered as sister to Solanales, but without 
support above 50% (Olmstead et al. 2000). In other stud- 
ies, Boraginaceae were sister to Lamiales (rbcL; Olmstead 
et al. 1992) or to Vahliaceae + Lamiales (multigene analy- 
ses; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c). However, 
this close relationship of Boraginaceae to Lamiales did not 
receive support above 50%. In Bremer et al. (2002), Bora- 
ginaceae + Vahliaceae are sister to Solanales + Lamiales, 
but again without support above 50%. Most recent phy- 
logenetic analyses further support the placement of Bo- 
raginaceae s.l. (Boraginales sensu Refulio-Rodriguez and 
Olmstead 2014) as sister to Lamiales (Soltis et al. 2011; 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014). Development of 
the endosperm may provide synapomorphies for Boragina- 
ceae and Lamiales; Boraginaceae and all Lamiales (except 
Oleaceae) share terminal endosperm haustoria. Estimated 
ages for Boraginaceae s.l. range from 88.4-39 mya (Wik- 
strom et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2010; Naumann et al. 2013; 
Nazaire et al. 2014). 
Boraginaceae are currently broadly circumscribed to 
include Hydrophyllaceae (excluding Hydrolea, which is 
in Solanales; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), 
although several authors have advocated for breaking Bo- 
raginaceae into numerous families (see Stevens 2001 on- 
wards; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014). Cronquist 
(1981, 1988) did not consider Boraginaceae and Hydro- 
phyllaceae to be closely related. He placed Hydrophylla- 
ceae in Solanales and Boraginaceae in Lamiales on the basis 
of similarities between tropical, woody Boraginaceae and 
tropical, woody Verbenaceae. 
A morphological character 
uniting Boraginaceae as now broadly circumscribed (APG 
II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016) is a distinctive inflo- 
rescence, usually composed of helicoid or scorpioid cymes, 
which straighten as the flowers mature (see also Judd et al. 
2002, 2008; Fig. 11.18). 
Boraginaceae offer the opportunity to examine facets 
of mating system evolution. Although there are obvious 
genetic benefits to outcrossing, many (20%) angiosperms 
have evolved predominant 
selfing (autogamy; 
Barrett 
2002). Multiple origins of small-flowered predominantly 
autogamous species from outcrossing species is a com- 
mon feature of herbaceous flowering plant families (Bar- 
rett 2002). An excellent example is provided by Amsinckia 
(Boraginaceae). 
Phylogenetic analysis and character-state mapping indi- 
cated that predominant selfing has evolved from outcross- 
ing at least four times in the genus (Schoen et al. 1997). 
The outcrossing species are distylous with large flowers; 
Superasterids 
281 
the selfing species are homostylous and have small flow- 
ers. In addition, the repeated occurrence of short branches 
separating selfers from related outcrossers indicates that 
selfing may be of recent origin (Schoen et al. 1997). 
LAMIALES 
Lamiales, with almost 18,000 species in about 1,100 gen- 
era, are among the most taxonomically difficult clades of 
asterids, as well as all angiosperms. Lamiales include the 
former orders Lamiales, Scrophulariales, Callitrichales, and 
Plantaginales of Cronquist (1981). Lamiales are strongly 
supported, comprising 25 families in APG III (2009); with 
a slight modification in APG IV (2016) to 24 families— 
Orobanchaceae was expanded to include Lindenbergia- 
ceae and Rehmanniaceae (Fig. 11.15). Sanango was moved 
to Gesneriaceae; however, Peltanthera is still unplaced to 
family. The 24 families in APG IV (2016) are Acanthaceae 
(including Avicenniaceae), Bignoniaceae, Byblidaceae, Cal- 
ceolariaceae, Carlemanniaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lamiaceae, 
Lentibulariaceae, Linderniaceae, Martyniaceae, Mazaceae, 
Oleaceae, Orobanchaceae (including Nesogenaceae), Pau- 
lowniaceae, 
Pedaliaceae, 
Phrymaceae, 
Plantaginaceae, 
Plocospermataceae, Schlegeliaceae, Scrophulariaceae (in- 
cluding Buddlejaceae and Myoporaceae), Stilbaceae, Tetra- 
chondraceae, Thomandersiaceae, and Verbenaceae (several 
are illustrated in Fig. 11.19). 
Most Lamiales share characters that are extremely rare 
outside of this clade: verbascoside; anthraquinones derived 
from the shikimic acid pathway; C11-decarboxylated iri- 
doids (Jensen 1991, 1992); oligosaccharides; 6-oxygenated 
flavones; protein inclusions in nuclei of mesophyll cells; 
often diacytic stomates; hairs with a stalk of one or more 
uniseriate cells and a head of two or more vertical cells; 
young anthers with pollen sac placentoids (also found in 
the sister clade Boraginaceae s.l.); and fewer than five fer- 
tile stamens (Rahn 1996). Much of the taxonomic com- 
plexity of Lamiales involves compelling DNA evidence for 
the polyphyly of Scrophulariaceae in the traditional sense 
(see paragraphs below; reviewed in Olmstead et al. 2001; 
and Tank et al. 2006). 
The polyphyly of Scrophulariaceae and other recent 
phylogenetic results resulted in several newly named fami- 
lies in Lamiales. Families added (see APG II 2003; APG III 
2009; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014) include Cal- 
ceolariaceae, Carlemanniaceae, Linderniaceae, Mazaceae, 
Plocospermataceae, 
Rehmanniaceae, 
Tetrachondraceae, 
and Thomandersiaceae. However, 
in APG IV (2016), 
Rehmanniaceae have been included in Orobanchaceae 
(Fig. 11.15). Other families have been redefined. For ex- 
ample, phylogenetic studies dictate that Buddlejaceae and 
Myoporaceae be included in Scrophulariaceae (Olmstead

et al. 1992, 1999, 2001; Oxelman et al. 1999} Avicennia 
(Avicenniaceae) appears in Acanthaceae and has been in- 
cluded in that family (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 
2016). Orobanchaceae have been expanded to contain 
parasitic Scrophulariaceae (plus the non-parasitic Linden- 
bergia formerly of Scrophulariaceae and sometimes treated 
as Lindenbergiaceae; see Chapter 13 for evolution of para- 
sitism). Orobanchaceae also include core genera of the 
former Cyclocheilaceae. Bremer et al. (2002) found Cyclo- 
cheilon to be embedded within Orobanchaceae with strong 
support; Asepalum is also nested within Orobanchaceae 
(Tank et al. 2006). Some also include Rehmanniaceae in 
Orobanchaceae (see APG IV 2016; Stevens 2001 onwards; 
Rehmannieae). Holoparasitism has evolved three times in 
Orobanchaceae (McNeal et al. 2013). Tank and Olmstead 
(2008, 2009) and Tank et al. (2009) reconstructed phyloge- 
netic relationships within the large subtribe Castillejinae of 
Orobanchaceae, including Castilleja and relatives. 
Confusion has been introduced in the naming of clades 
in this disintegrated Scrophulariaceae. The name Veroni- 
caceae has been resurrected for one clade of the former, 
broadly defined (and polyphyletic) Scrophulariaceae (Olm- 
stead and Reeves 1995; Olmstead et al. 1999, 2001), but 
the name with priority is Plantaginaceae (APG II 2003; 
APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), because it has been con- 
served over Veronicaceae. The newly recognized Calceola- 
riaceae (slipper flowers) are distinct from Scrophulariaceae 
s.s. in having four calyx lobes, and the bilateral corolla has 
also been shown by developmental studies (Mayr and We- 
ber 2006) to be based upon four petals (they also exhibit 
oil-producing hairs) and include Calceolaria (250 species 
from South America), Jovellana (six species from New Zea- 
land and Chile), and Porodittia (= Stemotria) from Peru 
(Olmstead et al. 1999, 2001). 
The relationships of some genera formerly placed in 
Scrophulariaceae (e.g., Mimulus) remain uncertain. It ap- 
pears, however, that Mimulus should be placed in Phryma- 
ceae (Beardsley et al. 2001; Beardsley and Olmstead 2002; 
Beardsley et al. 2004; Barker et al. 2012; Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014) rather than Plantaginaceae. Sensitive, 
foliaceous style branches in Mimulus versus non-sensitive, 
papillose stigmatic lobes in Plantaginaceae separate the 
two morphologically. 
Carlemanniaceae consist of five species and two gen- 
era (Carlemannia and Silvianthus) from Southeast Asia to 
Sumatra; they were formerly included in Caprifoliaceae/ 
Dipsacales by Cronquist (1981), but their connivent an- 
thers are consistent with their placement in Lamiales. 
Martyniaceae consist of four genera from tropical and sub- 
tropical America; they were included in Pedaliaceae in APG 
(1998), although multigene analyses (Olmstead et al. 1999, 
2001; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002) indicated 
Superasterids 
283 
that their familial status should be maintained. Recent 
analyses of Lamiales by Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 
(2014) suggest that Martyniaceae form a clade with Acan- 
thaceae, which is sister to Pedaliaceae, but this topology 
is not well supported (see Fig. 11.15). Both Acanthaceae 
and Pedaliaceae contain amyloid, an oligosaccharide not 
found in other Lamiales (Hegnauer 1962-1994), and share 
pollen morphology (Erdtman 1952), so a clade containing 
Acanthaceae and Pedaliaceae is supported by chemical and 
morphological characters as well. 
Plocospermataceae are a monogeneric family compris- 
ing three species from Central America; they were included 
in Loganiaceae by Cronquist (1981) and not assigned to 
order in APG (1998). Tetrachondraceae are a new family 
comprising Tetrachondra from Patagonia and New Zea- 
land and Polypremum procumbens from warm temperate 
and tropical America (Oxelman et al. 1999; Bremer et al. 
2002). 
Within Lamiales, relationships among families were 
relatively well-supported in most recent analyses (Refulio- 
Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014) (Fig. 11.15). Plocosperma- 
taceae appear to be sister to the rest of Lamiales (Bremer 
et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olm- 
stead 2014) followed by a well-supported clade formed by 
Carlemanniaceae and Oleaceae (Refulio-Rodriguez and 
Olmstead 2014). Lamiales are inferred to have diverged ca. 
97 mya (Bremer et al. 2004). 
In contrast to molecular results placing Oleaceae in 
Lamiales, Oleaceae were often considered closely related 
to Gentianales in morphology-based classifications (e.g., 
Dahlgren et al. 1980). Cronquist (1981) placed the family 
in his Scrophulariales. Oleaceae are distinct from the re- 
maining Lamiales in their embryogeny, which is of the po- 
lygonad type, in contrast to the onagrad type found in the 
remainder of the order. Phylogenetic relationships within 
Oleaceae have recently been studied (e.g., Wallander and 
Albert 2000; Heuertz et al. 2006; Wallander 2008; Besnard 
et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2011; Kim and Kim 2011). Fossil 
records of the family include fruits of Fraxinus from the 
Eocene (Fig. 11.17g), and dispersed pollen assignable to the 
family from the late Cretaceous (Campanian) (Manchester 
et al. 2015). 
Following Oleaceae, Tetrachondraceae, both with actin- 
omorphic and tetramerous flowers, are sister to the remain- 
ing Lamiales (Fig. 
11.15), a placement receiving strong sup- 
port in Bremer et al. (2002), as well as other studies (Soltis 
et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014). Fol- 
lowing Tetrachondraceae, the remaining members of Lami- 
ales form a well-supported clade (Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio- 
Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014) that is also supported by 
two non-DNA characters: (1) flowers having bilateral sym- 
metry (a two plus three pattern); and (2) four stamens in 

284 Chapter 11 
a two-long and two-short configuration (e.g., Judd et al. 
2002, 2008). Within this latter clade, Calceolariaceae + 
Gesneriaceae and Plantaginaceae, are subsequent sisters to 
the rest of Lamiales (Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014). Soltis et al. (2011) recovered a poorly 
supported clade of Plantaginaceae + Scrophulariaceae and 
Stilbaceae; 
however, 
Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 
(2014) recovered a well-supported topology where Scro- 
phulariaceae and Stilbaceae were subsequent sisters to the 
rest of Lamiales, after Plantaginaceae (Fig. 11.15). 
The South American genus Peltanthera, unplaced to 
family, is strongly supported as sister to the Gesneriaceae 
+ Calceolariaceae (Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014; Fig. 11.15); APG IV (2016) has in- 
cluded Sanango in Gesneriaceae. Gesneriaceae are distinct 
from most other Lamiales in their parietal placentation (al- 
though this also has evolved in Orobanchaceae) and lack 
of iridoids. Relationships within Gesneriaceae have been 
the subject of several phylogenetic and systematic investi- 
gations (e.g., Smith and Carroll 1997; Smith and Atkinson 
1998; Smith 2000a,b; Zimmer et al. 2002; Mayer et al. 
2003; Clark 2005, 2009; Clark et al. 2006, 2011, 2012; 
Perret et al. 2013; Smith and Clark 2013). 
Plantaginaceae are morphologically diverse; they in- 
clude the wind-pollinated Plantago, as well as Callitri- 
chaceae and Hippuridaceae, two groups of aquatic herbs. 
Aragoa, a genus of Andean trees, is sister to Plantago, and 
although insect-pollinated, Aragoa shares a similar floral 
morphology with Plantago (Bello et al. 2002). Antirrhinum 
(snapdragon), a model organism for the study of floral de- 
velopmental genetics, is also a member of Plantaginaceae 
(see “Floral Symmetry,” below). 
Within the remaining Lamiales, relationships remain 
poorly understood other than a large clade formed by La- 
miaceae as sister to a well-supported clade formed by Oro- 
banchaceae, Rehmanniaceae, Paulowniaceae, Phrymaceae, 
and Mazaceae (Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014; 
Fig. 11.15). Verbenaceae form a well-supported clade sis- 
ter to Thomandersiaceae, which may be sister to a clade 
composed of Lentibulariaceae + Schlegeliaceae (Refulio- 
Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014), although the last clade 
was not well supported. Bignoniaceae also form a well- 
supported clade that is likely sister to a clade formed by the 
aforementioned families (Fig. 11.15); see Olmstead (2013) 
for a discussion on the biogeographic history of the group. 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) also found high 
support for a clade composed of Bignoniaceae and the rest 
of Lamiales, as well as Acanthaceae, Pedaliaceae, and Mar- 
tyniaceae, a clade that was moderately supported by Olm- 
stead et al. (2001). Among these families, Bignoniaceae have 
the most informative fossil record, based on biwinged seeds 
extending back to the Paleocene (Fig. 11.17q). Scrophu- 
lariaceae s.s., including Buddleja (formerly Buddlejaceae, 
a genus with actinomorphic flowers with four petals) and 
Myoporum (formerly Myoporaceae, a clade with pellucid- 
dotted leaves), form a well-supported clade (Olmstead and 
Reeves 1995; Oxelman et al. 1999; Albach et al. 2001c; 
Olmstead et al. 2001; Bremer et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014), and they are char- 
acterized by the usually confluent pollen sacs. A close rela- 
tionship between Scrophulariaceae and Buddlejaceae was 
first noted by Dahlgren (1983). The genus Androya, previ- 
ously placed in Loganiaceae, is also part of the Myoporum 
clade of Scrophulariaceae s.s. (Bremer et al. 2002). Mem- 
bers of this redefined Scrophulariaceae are characterized by 
acylated rhamnosyl:iridoids (Jensen et al. 1998). 
Phylogenetic relationships 
within Acanthaceae 
have 
been examined by several investigators (e.g., Scotland et al. 
1995; McDade et al. 2000). Schwarzbach and McDade 
(2002) provided molecular evidence for the close relation- 
ship of the mangrove genus Avicennia (formerly Avicennia- 
ceae) to subfamily Thunbergioideae of Acanthaceae. In the 
analysis by Bremer et al. (2002), Acanthaceae and Pedalia- 
ceae are part of a clade with Stilbaceae and Schlegeliaceae. 
However, with the greater taxon sampling of Olmstead 
et al. (2001), Soltis et al. (2011) and Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead (2014), Stilbaceae and Schlegeliaceae ap- 
peared in different positions. Schlegeliaceae, a small fam- 
ily of shrubs or vines with simple leaves, nectar glands on. 
the outside of the calyx, and berry fruits, that sometimes 
is placed in Bignoniaceae (e.g., Cronquist 1981), may be 
sister to Lentibulariaceae but do not appear closely related 
to Bignoniaceae. 
Lamiaceae include those taxa traditionally placed in 
Lamiaceae, as well as many taxa previously placed in Ver- 
benaceae (e.g., Callicarpa, Clerodendrum, Tectona, Vitex; 
Olmstead and Reeves 1995; Wagstaff and Olmstead 1997; 
Wagstaff et al. 1998; Cantino 1992a). Previously, Verbena- 
ceae were circumscribed much more broadly (e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981), but phylogenetic analyses revealed this broadly 
defined family to be paraphyletic. The family now includes 
only the former subfamily Verbenoideae (with the exclu- 
sion of tribe Monochileae) (Cantino 1992a,b; Chadwell 
et al. 1992; Judd et al. 1994; Wagstaff and Olmstead 1997). 
To make Lamiaceae monophyletic, roughly two-thirds of 
the genera of the former, broadly defined Verbenaceae were 
transferred to Lamiaceae. In most studies, the now nar- 
rowly defined Verbenaceae and broadly defined Lamiaceae 
clades appear distantly related within Lamiales (Olmstead 
and Reeves 1995; Wagstaff and Olmstead 1997; Wagstaff 
et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000; 
Albach et al. 2001c; Soltis et al. 2011; Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014). 
Verbenaceae in the narrow sense differ from Lamiaceae 

(as redefined) in accumulation of 4-carboxy irtdoids in the 
former versus C,-decarboxylated iridoids in the latter (von 
Poser et al. 1997). Verbenaceae can also be distinguished 
from Lamiaceae by the presence in the former of indetermi- 
nate racemes, spikes, or heads (vs. inflorescences with an in- 
determinate main axis and cymosely branched lateral axes), 
simple style with conspicuous two-lobed stigma (vs. apically 
forked style with inconspicuous stigmatic region), margin- 
ally attached (vs. laterally attached) ovules, pollen exine 
thickened near apertures (vs. not thickened), and nonglan- 
dular hairs exclusively unicellular (vs. multicellular, uniseri- 
ate) (Judd et al. 2002, 2008). See Olmstead (2013) for a 
discussion on the biogeographic history of Verbenaceae and 
Marx et al. (2010) for a detailed phylogeny of the clade. 
The relationships of the carnivorous families, Byblida- 
ceae, Martyniaceae, and Lentibulariaceae, remain unclear 
(see Chapter 13). In Bremer et al. (2002) they formed a 
clade with weak support, but Byblidaceae and Lentibulari- 
aceae were not included in Olmstead et al. (2001). Some 
molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated a close relation- 
ship between Byblidaceae and Martyniaceae, although 
support for this sister group was not apparent in analyses 
of three genes (D. Soltis et al. 2000). Byblis was generally 
considered related to Pittosporaceae (e.g., Dahlgren 1980; 
Cronquist 1981; Dahlgren et al. 1981), whereas Martyni- 
aceae were placed near Pedaliaceae and Bignoniaceae, and 
sometimes even included in Pedaliaceae (Cronquist 1981). 
More recently, Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead (2014) 
found weak support for a clade of Byblis (Byblidaceae) and 
Linderniaceae (a clade with bilobed, but sensitive stigma 
and ruminant endosperm, traditionally included within 
Scrophulariaceae s.l.), while Lentibulariaceae were weakly 
supported as sister to Schlegeliaceae and Martyniaceae 
were sister to Acanthaceae. Thus, it appears that the evo- 
lution of carnivory in these different groups has evolved 
several times, although these results are tentative and need 
further clarification. 
Campanulids 
The campanulid clade (asterid II sensu Chase et al. 1993; 
campanulids of B. Bremer et al. 2002; euasterids II sensu 
APG II 2003) comprises seven major subclades (Fig. 11.20): 
Asterales, Escalloniales, Aquifoliales, Dipsacales, Paracry- 
phiales, Apiales, and Bruniales (several of these families are 
illustrated in Figs. 11.21-11.23). Although the composi- 
tions of Dipsacales, Asterales (Asteranae sensu Thorne), 
and Apiales correspond well to the orders described by 
Cronquist (1981) and Thorne (1992a,b), the campanulid 
clade does not agree with any group of orders suggested in 
morphology-based classifications.

Phylogenetic relationships of Campanulids. 
Asteridae with several groups of Rosidae (e.g., Aquifolia- 
les, Apiales, Escalloniaceae, Icacinaceae; sensu Cronquist 
1981, 1988). Monophyly of the campanulid clade was in- 
dicated by analyses of single genes, such as rbcL (Chase 
et al. 1993; Olmstead et al. 1993; Cosner et al. 1994; Back- 
lund and Bremer 1997), atpB (Savolainen et al. 2000a), and 
18S rDNA (Soltis et al. 1997b), and subsequent multigene 
analyses have provided further support for the clade (Jan- 
sen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Tank and Dono- 

286 Chapter 11 
ghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014). The clade 
is also supported by several non-DNA characters, includ- 
ing floral ontogeny (Erbar and Leins 1996, 2011; Roehls 
and Smets 1996). In addition, campanulids mostly have 
alternate leaves (with exceptions mainly in Dipsacales) and 
includes many taxa characterized by either secoiridoids or 
the apparent loss of iridoid production (the latter in Cam- 
panulaceae, Aquifoliaceae, and Apiales except Griselinia 
and Melanophylla; Albach et al. 2001b). Carbocyclic iri- 
doids have been found in only four genera of campanulids: 
three genera of Stemonuraceae (Cantleya and Lasianthera, 
formerly Icacinaceae, Kaplan et al. 1991), Stylidium (Styli- 
diaceae), and Escallonia (Plouvier and Favre-Bonvin 1971). 
Iridoids and polyacetylenes seem to be complementary in 
distribution among campanulid members; they compete for 
acetyl-CoA and mevalonic acid as biosynthetic precursors 
(Stuhlfauth et al. 1985; reviewed in Albach et al. 2001b). 
Aquifoliales are strongly supported as sister to the other 
campanulids (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000; Bremer et al. 2002; 
Moore et al. 2010, 2011; Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis 
et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014). The rest of the orders form 
a well-supported clade (BS = 100%, Soltis et al. 2011), but 
subclade relationships are still unclear. Soltis et al. (2011) 
suggest that the Asterales and Escalloniales may be sister to 
a clade formed by Dipsacales, Paracryphiales, Apiales, and 
Bruniales, but those relationships are not well supported. 
Tank and Donoghue (2010) found a similar topology, al- 
though Asterales did not form a clade with Escalloniales, 
but rather was sister to a clade composed of Escalloniales, 
Bruniales, Apiales, Paracryphiales, and Dipsacales. That to- 
pology also was not well supported (BS = 61%). Tank and 
Donoghue (2010) also found that Apiales + (Dipsacales + 
Paracryphiales) formed a well-supported clade (BS = 98%), 
but this was not well supported in Soltis et al. (2011). 
AQUIFOLIALES 
Aquifoliales consist of (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; Soltis 
et al. 2011; APG IV 2016; Fig. 11.20) Aquifoliaceae, 
Helwingiaceae, Phyllonomaceae, Cardiopteridaceae, and 
Stemonuraceae (several of these are illustrated in Figs. 
11.21 and 11.23). The placement of these families together 
in the asterid clade was not anticipated from their treat- 
ments 
in morphology-based 
classifications. 
Cronquist 
(1981) placed Aquifoliaceae and Cardiopteridaceae 
in 
Celastrales, Helwingiaceae within Cornaceae, and Phyl- 
lonomaceae within Grossulariaceae. Morphological syn- 
apomorphies for Aquifoliales are stipules (which are rare 
in asterids), unisexual flowers, and fleshy, drupaceous 
fruits, which evolved in parallel in other orders (Bremer 
et al. 2001). They also have apical or apical-axile placenta- 
tion and 1-2 ovules per locule. Karehed (2001) indicated 
that Icacinaceae are polyphyletic. Some are part of lami- 
ids (Icacinaceae s.s. or likely within Garryales; see Stevens 
2001 onwards), with the remaining members part of Aqui- 
foliales. Some taxa constitute a new family, Stemonura- 
ceae (sensu Karehed 2001), with other genera part of an 
enlarged Cardiopteridaceae. 
Stemonuraceae and Cardiopteridaceae form a clade that 
is sister to the remaining families. The second subclade of 
Aquifoliales consists of Aquifoliaceae as sister to Helwin- 
giaceae + Phyllonomaceae. These familial relationships are 
strongly supported (bootstrap above 97%) in Soltis et al. 
(2011). Helwingiaceae and Aquifoliaceae were weakly sup- 
ported sisters in D. Soltis et al. (2000). However, other anal- 
yses have indicated with strong support that Aquifoliaceae 
are sister to Phyllonomaceae + Helwingiaceae (Savolainen 
et al. 2000b; Albach et al. 2001c; Soltis et al. 2011). The 
association of Helwingia and Phyllonoma is interesting, 
given that they share the rare character of flowers borne 
directly on the leaf blades (Fig. 11.21b; Dickinson and Sat- 
tler 1974; Morgan and Soltis 1993; Tobe 2013), as well as 
inferior ovaries and epigynous disc nectaries (Tobe 2013). 
Phyllonomaceae also exhibit numerous autapomorphies 
(Tobe 2013). Stemonuraceae and Cardiopteridaceae ex- 
hibit two synapomorphies: 1) two carpels in median posi- 
tion and 2) a pseudomonomerous gynoecium (Tobe 2013). 
Aquifoliales were inferred to have originated 113-85 mya 
(Bremer et al. 2004; Bell et al. 2010). Ilex (Aquifoliaceae) 
. 
has been the focus of phylogenetic study (Cuénoud et al. 
2000; Manen et al. 2010). This large genus provides the 
best insight into the fossil history of this group, due to 
the easily recognized, tricolporate pollen, which is orna- 
mented with distinctive clavae (Fig. 11.23a-c). This pollen 
type is common in Eocene and younger deposits through 
the world. There are also reports from the Cretaceous, but 
these remain to be documented with SEM (Martin 1977). 
ASTERALES 
Asterales are strongly supported and consist of 11 fami- 
lies (Fig. 11.20): Alseuosmiaceae, Argophyllaceae, Astera- 
ceae, Calyceraceae, Campanulaceae (including Lobeliaceae), 
Goodeniaceae, Menyanthaceae, Pentaphragmataceae, Phel- 
linaceae, Rousseaceae (including Carpodetus), and Stylidia- 
ceae (including Donatiaceae; several of these families are 
illustrated in Fig. 11.21; see Backlund and Bremer 1997; 
Gustafsson and Bremer 1997; Karehed et al. 1999; Soltis 
et al. 2011). The option of retaining Lobeliaceae as a family 
distinct from Campanulaceae has been noted (see also Lun- 
dberg and Bremer 2003; APG II 2003) but remains included 
within Campanulaceae in most recent treatments (Stevens 
2001 onwards; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016), although 
see Haberle et al. (2009). Donatiaceae and Stylidiaceae

are sister taxa (Lundberg and Bremer 2003; Soltis et al. 
2011); in APG III (2009) the former is placed in synonymy 
under the latter. Asterales in this circumscription include 
1,743 genera and 26,870 species, dominated by Asteraceae. 
This circumscription differs from that of Lammers (1992) 
in the addition of Stylidiaceae s.l. and the inclusion of Al- 
seuosmia (Alseuosmiaceae) and Corokia (Argophyllaceae), 
which Lammers did not consider. Lammers (1992) did not 
include Stylidiaceae because of the presence of carbocyclic 
iridoids in this family (it is absent from the other families 
of this order). However, the production of carbocyclic iri- 
doids also occurs in Cornales and early-diverging members 
of campanulids (Stemonuraceae, Aquifoliales), as well as 
lamiids (Apodytes of Icacinaceae s..; Kaplan et al. 1991); 
the presence of carbocyclic iridoids in Stylidiaceae likely 
represents a separate origin from these lineages. 
Possible non-molecular synapomorphies for Asterales 
are a base chromosome number of x = 9, the production of 
the oligosaccharide inulin as a storage compound (reported 
from Asteraceae, Calyceraceae, Goodeniaceae, Campanu- 
laceae, and Stylidiaceae), valvate corolla aestivation (with 
a reversal to imbricate aestivation in Stylidiaceae s.l. and 
parallel derivation of valvate aestivation in other euaster- 
ids), an inferior or partly inferior ovary, and perhaps also 
secondary pollen presentation (Bremer et al. 2001), some- 
times referred to as “plunger pollination” (Judd et al. 2002, 
2008), although the last could have developed in parallel 
within the order. As this is a pollen presentation mecha- 
nism rather than a means of pollination per se, “plunger 
pollen presentation” may be more appropriate (for the 
diversity of this mechanism, see Erbar and Leins 1995b). 
Campanulaceae and Stylidiaceae share the character of a 
filamentous suspensor of the proembryo (Tobe and Mo- 
rin 1996), although most recent and well-sampled analyses 
do not support a sister relationship of these two taxa, as 
was found previously (Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 
2002). Petal venation (Gustafsson 1995) and loss of mi- 
cropylar endosperm haustoria (Cosner et al. 1994) are sy- 
napomorphies for the well-supported clade of Asteraceae, 
Calyceraceae, Goodeniaceae, and Menyanthaceae. Other 
characters shared by these four families are multinucleate 
tapetal cells and the production of secoiridoids (Lammers 
1992), although in Asteraceae the production of secoiri- 
doids is mostly replaced by the production of sesquiterpene 
lactones (but see Wang and Yu 1997). 
There have been several comprehensive phylogenetic 
analyses of Asterales (e.g., Cosner et al. 1994; Gustafsson 
et al. 1996; Backlund and Bremer 1997; Gustafsson and 
Bremer 1997; Karehed et al. 1999; Olmstead et al. 2000; 
Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Lundberg and 
Bremer 2003; Winkworth et al. 2008a; Tank and Dono- 
ghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). Despite differences in taxon 
sampling, these studies reported many congruent relation- 
ships, but certain interrelationships among families of Aste- 
rales remain poorly understood. For example, the basal re- 
lationships are not well supported, even in large multigene 
analyses (Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Soltis 
et al. 2011). 
Within Asterales, Rousseaceae are strongly supported as 
sister to Campanulaceae (Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis 
et al. 2011). Roussea, which contains a single species, Rous- 
sea simplex, was recognized as part of the Asterales clade 
by Soltis et al. (1997a,b) and Koontz and Soltis (1999). 
The genus had often been placed with Brexia and Ixerba in 
Saxifragaceae s.l., Grossulariaceae, or Brexiaceae, all Rosi- 
dae. Carpodetus comprises 10 species and was formerly 
included in Escalloniaceae. Roussea, Carpodetus, Abro- 
phyllum, and Cuttsia have been included in an expanded 
Rousseaceae (see Stevens 2001 onwards; Soltis et al. 2011). 
The sister group to Campanulaceae + Rousseaceae is un- 
resolved; Soltis et al. (2011) supported a sister relationship 
with all of Asterales except Pentaphragmataceae (which 
was sister to all Asterales in their maximum likelihood tree), 
whereas the topology of Winkworth et al. (2008a,b) and 
Tank and Donoghue (2010) placed the clade as sister to the 
rest of Asterales + Pentaphragmataceae, and the latter clade 
is supported by the putative synapomorphy of petal wings. 
Soltis et al. (2011) found that a clade composed of Phel- 
linaceae, Argophyllaceae, and Alseuosmiaceae was sister. 
to Stylidiaceae, Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, Calycera- 
ceae and Asteraceae. However, Tank and Donoghue (2010) 
found that the clade of Phellinaceae, Argophyllaceae, and 
Alseuosmiaceae was sister to Stylidiaceae, which was sis- 
ter to a clade composed of Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, 
Calyceraceae, and Asteraceae (as in previous analyses by 
Savolainen et al. 2000b; Albach et al. 2001b; Bremer et al. 
2002). 
Donatia + Stylidium (i.e., Stylidiaceae s.l.) has been 
recovered in several analyses (D. Soltis et al. 2000, 2011; 
Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; Tank and Donoghue 2010), 
which led to the inclusion of both genera in Stylidiaceae 
(APG III 2009), but the placement of that clade is problem- 
atic (as discussed above). There is strong support in some 
multigene analyses for a clade of Argophyllaceae, Alseuos- 
miaceae, and Phellinaceae (Bremer et al. 2002; Winkworth 
et al. 2008a,b; Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011), 
with Phellinaceae as sister to an Alseuosmiaceae + Argophyl- 
laceae clade (Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011) 
or Alseuosmiaceae sister to a Phellinaceae + Argophyllaceae 
clade (Fig. 11.20), a putative clade that is supported by the 
possible synapomorphies of a base chromosome number of 
eight and glandular-toothed leaves; additionally, these taxa 
do not show plunger pollen presentation. 
Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, Calyceraceae, and As- 

teraceae form a well-supported clade (Savolainen et al. 
2000a,b; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer 
et al. 2002; Lundberg and Bremer 2003; Winkworth et al. 
2008a,b; Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
This clade is supported by the herbaceous habit, stems 
with separate vascular bundles, details of corolla venation, 
and the antiraphal vascular bundle proceeding to the mi- 
cropyle; at least the last may be synapomorphic (Stevens 
2001 onwards). Menyanthaceae are well supported as sis- 
ter to the remaining three families (Fig. 11.20)—that is, 
Goodeniaceae + Calyceraceae + Asteraceae, which are sup- 
ported by the presence of acetylenes, fused or connivent 
anthers, pollen exine with bifurcating columellae; addition- 
ally they all show secondary pollen presentation (plunger 
pollen presentation). 
The sister group of Asteraceae is either Calyceraceae 
(Gustafsson and Bremer 1995; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer 
et al. 2002; Lundberg and Bremer 2003; Winkworth et al. 
2008a,b; Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011) or 
Calyceraceae + Goodeniaceae (Cosner et al. 1994; Gus- 
tafsson et al. 1996; Savolainen et al. 2000a; D. Soltis et al. 
2000; Albach et al. 2001c). The conflict among these analy- 
ses is of interest. Bremer et al. (2002) obtained strong sup- 
port (88%), as did Tank and Donoghue (2010; >80%) and 
Soltis et al. (2011; 100%) for Calyceraceae alone as sis- 
ter to Asteraceae; morphology plus DNA sequences also 
supported this relationship (Lundberg and Bremer 2003). 
However, D. Soltis et al. (2000) found strong support (88%) 
for Calyceraceae + Goodeniaceae. Characters supporting 
the sister-group relationship of Calyceraceae and Astera- 
ceae are pollen morphology (Skvarla et al. 1977), petal ve- 
nation (i.e., connate, commissural veins), and morphology 
of the receptacles and receptacle bracts (Hansen 1992), and 
a persistent calyx that is modified for dispersal of the fruit 
(Stevens 2001 onwards). However, biochemical evidence 
seems to support a relationship between Goodeniaceae and 
Calyceraceae: both produce bis-secoiridoids of the sylves- 
troside type (Jensen et al. 1979; Capasso et al. 1996; Al- 
bach et al. 2001b). In light of the most recent results for 
this group, perhaps the biochemical properties shared by 
Goodeniaceae and Calyceraceae represent symplesiomor- 
phies that have been lost in Asteraceae. Ages of Asterales 
have been estimated from 101-77 mya (Wikstrom et al. 
2001; Bremer et al. 2004; Janssens et al. 2009; Magallon 
and Castillo 2009; Beaulieu et al. 2013). See Fig. 11.21 for 
selected members of Asterales. 
The large family Asteraceae (approximately 23,000 spe- 
cies) has been the focus of numerous phylogenetic analyses 
(K. Bremer 1987, 1994, 1996; Jansen et al. 1991, 1992; 
Kim et al. 1992; K. Kim and Jansen 1995; Watson et al. 
2002; Ford et al. 2006; Keeley et al. 2007; Panero and 
Funk 2008; Funk et al. 2009a,b, 2014; Gruenstaeud et al. 
Superasterids 
289 
2009; Mavrodiev et al. 2012). Barnadesioideae, a small 
South American group comprising mostly trees and shrubs, 
are sister to the remainder of the family (Jansen and Palmer 
1987; Panero and Funk 2008). Funk et al. (2009a,b) cov- 
ers the phylogenetics, systematics, and biogeography of As- 
teraceae, including coverage of all major clades. 
The fossil record of Asteraceae includes dispersed pol- 
len and a few megafossil examples (Supplementary Ta- 
ble 11.1). The earliest convincing records are pollen grains 
documented by both scanning electron and light micros- 
copy attributed to Tubulifloridites lilliei from the Late Cre- 
taceous (Campanian/Maastrichtian) of Antarctica, suggest- 
ing a Southern Hemisphere origin (Barreda et al. 2015). 
The oldest known macro remains are the impression of 
a fossil capitulum, Raiguenrayun cura, with multiseriate- 
imbricate involucral bracts and pappus-like hairs from the 
Eocene of Argentina (Barreda et al. 2012). Dispersed pollen 
reports provide additional convincing records for the fam- 
ily in various geographic regions, and in some cases can be 
assigned to specific clades based on distinctive ornamenta- 
tion types that have been distinguished as Ambrosia type, 
Liguliflorae type, Lactuceae-Veronieae type, and Mutisia 
type (Graham 1996). Early pollen records include exam- 
ples of Asteraceae pollen from the Eocene Princeton Chert 
of British Columbia (Manchester et al. 2015). Pollen grains 
characteristic of tribe Mutiseae have been recognized from 
the late Paleocene-Eocene of South Africa, treated under 
the name, Tubulifloridites antipodica (Zavada and de Vil- 
liers 2000), and from the early Oligocene of northwestern 
Tasmania, named Mutisiapollis patersonii (Macphail and 
Hill 1994). Pollen from these and other Southern Hemi- 
sphere sites allow for recognition of the Barnadesioideae, 
Nassauvieae, and Mutisieae (Barreda et al. 2010). 
Campanulaceae also have been studied phylogenetically 
by numerous researchers (Cosner et al. 2004; Antonelli 
2008, 2009; Roquet et al. 2008, 2009; Cellinese et al. 2009; 
Givnish et al. 2009; Haberle et al. 2009; Prebble et al. 
2011, 2012a,b; Wendling et al. 2011; Oleson et al. 2012; 
Zhou et al. 2013; Crowl et al. 2014; Lagomarsino et al. 
2014). Four primary clades are recovered in most analyses, 
the lobelioid, platycodonoid, wahlenbergioid, and campan- 
uloid clades (see Haberle et al. 2009). It is clear that the 
large genera Lobelia and Campanula are highly polyphy- 
letic and have given rise to highly specialized taxa with a 
large variety of growth forms, floral modifications for bird 
pollination, and fleshy fruit for animal dispersal instead of 
the typical capsular fruit, which are more common in the 
group (Antonelli 2008; Givnish et al. 2009; Haberle et al. 
2009). 
Of considerable interest is the radiation of Hawaiian lo- 
beliads (including the Hawaiian silverswords), which have 
been the focus of several recent studies (Givnish et al. 2004, 

290 Chapter 11 
2009; Montgomery and Givnish 2008). This group consists 
of roughly 126 species and had been placed in six genera. 
Growth forms in these species range from rosette species 
to trees up to 18 m tall, and fruits range from dry capsules 
to fleshy berries; most of these taxa are bird-pollinated and 
occur in the understory of broad-leaved tropical forests 
(Givnish et al. 2009). Historically this group was considered 
to have arisen via 4-5 original colonizations to the islands, 
considering their disparate morphological characters, life 
history traits, and ecological niches; however, phylogenetic 
analyses revealed that the group likely originated from one 
dispersal event to the islands and subsequently formed one 
of the largest island radiations of plants known (Givnish 
et al. 2009). Givnish et al. (2009) also demonstrated that 
ecological preference, fruit type, inflorescence position, 
habit, and pollination mode were labile characters, hav- 
ing evolved multiple times within the lobelioids in general. 
Givnish et al. (2004) and Montgomery and Givnish (2008) 
further showed that the Hawaiian lobeliads—notably Cya- 
nea and Clermontia—demonstrated functionally different 
physiological adaptations for light capture and photosyn- 
thesis, allowing them to occur in different ecological niches 
with specific light regimes, suggesting a possible mecha- 
nism for such a large adaptive radiation of the group in the 
Hawaiian Islands. 
ESCALLONIALES 
Bremer et al. (2002) first suggested that Polyosmaceae, as 
well as Tribelaceae, were members of a clade with Eremo- 
synaceae + Escalloniaceae. In most recent analyses, Escal- 
loniaceae, Polyosmaceae, Tribelaceae, and Eremosynaceae 
form a well-supported clade (Fig. 11.20) that is sister to 
Asterales (Soltis et al. 2011) or to a clade formed by Dipsa- 
cales, Apiales, and Bruniales (Tank and Donoghue 2010). A 
sister relationship of Eremosynaceae (Eremosyne) and Es- 
calloniaceae had been supported in most multigene analy- 
ses (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c), although 
with the inclusion of more taxa in analyses, it appears 
that Valdivia and Forgesia could be more closely related 
to Escalloniaceae s.s. (Soltis et al. 2011; Sede et al. 2013). 
The close relationship of Escalloniaceae and Eremosyna- 
ceae was somewhat unexpected, although both had been 
placed in Saxifragaceae s.l. by Engler (1930; see Morgan 
and Soltis 1993). 
Treatments of these four families have been diverse. 
Cronquist (1981), for example, included Escalloniaceae in 
his Grossulariaceae and Eremosynaceae within Saxifraga- 
ceae (both Rosales, Rosidae). Takhtajan (1997), in contrast, 
placed Escalloniaceae in Cornidae, while similarly consid- 
ering Eremosyne (as Eremosynaceae) close to Saxifraga- 
ceae in Saxifragales (Rosidae). Polyosmaceae consisting of 
one genus, Polyosma, and ca. 60 species, has been included 
in Escalloniaceae by some authors (Takhtajan 1987). Cron- 
quist (1981) placed Polyosma in Grossulariaceae with other 
putative woody relatives of Saxifragaceae, including Mon- 
tiniaceae, Tribelaceae, and Phyllonomaceae, families now 
known to be part of the asterid clade. Cronquist (1981) 
placed Tribelaceae in Grossulariaceae with other putative 
woody relatives of Saxifragaceae. Takhtajan (1997) placed 
the family close to Escalloniaceae (Hydrangeales, Corni- 
dae). Eremosynaceae, Polyosmaceae, and Tribelaceae are 
now recognized under a broader Escalloniaceae consider- 
ing the most recent phylogenetic findings (Fig. 11.20). 
Escalloniaceae as previously circumscribed are polyphy- 
letic; those traditional members have diverse relationships 
within the campanulids. Other genera formerly placed in 
the family with relationships elsewhere in campanulids 
include Columellia and Desfontainia 
(included within 
Columelliaceae; Bruniales), Phelline (Asterales), and Sphe- 
nostemon and Quintinia (Paracryphiales) (Backlund and 
Bremer 1997; APG III 2009; Tank and Donoghue 2010; 
Soltis et al. 2011). Trichomes with radially arranged apical 
cells in the glandular head are shared by Escallonia and 
Eremosyne (Al-Shammary and Gornall 1994). Synapomor- 
phies for Escalloniaceae s.l. are opposite leaves, tetram- 
erous flowers, valvate corollas (see Fig. 11.22), triporate 
pollen, starchy endosperm, and one-seeded drupes (Stevens 
2001 onwards). Several recent phylogenetic analyses have 
© 
focused on Escalloniaceae s.s. (i.e., Escallonia; Sede et al. 
2013; Zapata 2013). 
DIPSACALES 
Dipsacales consist of Adoxaceae (including Sambucus and 
Viburnum, genera formerly placed in Caprifoliaceae) and 
a broadly circumscribed Caprifoliaceae (Fig. 11.20; Judd 
et al. 2002, 2008; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 
2016; several representatives are illustrated in Figs. 11.22, 
11.23). The order comprises about 46 genera and around 
1090 species. Rather than recognizing a broadly defined 
Caprifoliaceae, some systematists prefer subdividing Capri- 
foliaceae into several families: Caprifoliaceae s.s., Diervil- 
laceae, Dipsacaceae, Linnaeaceae, Morinaceae, and Valeri- 
anaceae, a treatment that was also provided as an option 
in the APG II (2003) classification (see Backlund and Pyck 
1998; Bremer et al. 2002). Savolainen et al. (2000a,b) sug- 
gested that Desfontainiaceae (now included in Columel- 
liaceae), Polyosmaceae, Paracryphiaceae, and Sphenoste- 
monaceae might also be part of Dipsacales, but bootstrap 
support for this placement was lacking; other multigene 
analyses placed these families outside of Dipsacales (Soltis 
et al. 2011). Bremer et al. (2002) found weak support 
(SS%) for a sister-group relationship of Paracryphiaceae

and Dipsacales (Fig. 11.20), and this placement has been 
further supported by more recent analyses (Tank and 
Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Dipsacales (Fig. 11.20) correspond closely to the Dipsa- 
cales of Cronquist (1981) and Thorne (1992a,b) and Dipsa- 
canae sensu Takhtajan (1997). Dahlgren’s (1980) treatment 
of Dipsacales differed in that he also included Calyceraceae 
in the order, a family firmly placed in Asterales (see above). 
Takhtajan (1997) placed several genera of Dipsacales (i.e., 
Sambucus, Viburnum, Triplostegia, and Morina) in mono- 
generic families. Morphological synapomorphies for Dip- 
sacales include pericyclic cork and a gynoecium of three 
or more carpels (with some reversals to two; Bremer et al. 
2001), along with opposite and decussate leaves and seeds 
with a vascularized testa. 
The relationships of Dipsacales remain unclear. Analyses 
based on three (D. Soltis et al. 2000), four (Albach et al. 
2001c), and 12 (Tank and Donoghue 2010) loci indicated 
that Dipsacales and Apiales form a clade with Bruniaceae 
and Escalloniaceae, although this clade did not receive sup- 
port above 61% and relationships among these groups were 
either not highly supported or unclear. Soltis et al. (2011) 
placed Escalloniaceae as sister to Asterales instead of the 
former placement with Apiales and Dipsacales, and again, 
relationships among Dipsacales, Apiales, Bruniales, and 
Paracryphiales were not well supported. A possible close 
relationship between Apiales and Dipsacales is supported 
by the shedding of trinucleate pollen (Albach et al. 2001c). 
Dipsacales have been the subject of a series of molecu- 
lar phylogenetic investigations (e.g., Donoghue et al. 1992, 
2001; Backlund and Bremer 1997; Bell and Donoghue 
2005a; Clement and Donoghue 2007; Smith and Donoghue 
2008; Theis et al. 2008; Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; Carlson 
et al. 2009), as well as evolutionary developmental stud- 
ies (Howarth and Donoghue 2005, 2009). Within Dipsa- 
cales, Adoxaceae are sister to the remainder (D. Soltis et al. 
2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Donoghue et al. 2001; Bremer 
et al. 2002; Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; Tank and Donoghue 
2010; Soltis et al. 2011). Caprifoliaceae s.l. are easily sepa- 
rated from Adoxaceae by bilateral floral symmetry in the 
former versus radial in the latter; flowers with an elongate 
versus short style, capitate versus lobed stigma, spiny ver- 
sus reticulate pollen exine, and differences in the structure 
of the nectary (Judd et al. 2002, 2008; for the nectary, see 
also Wagenitz and Laing 1984). A series of morphological 
and molecular phylogenetic analyses has focused on Cap- 
rifoliaceae s.l., some as part of more comprehensive analy- 
ses (e.g., Donoghue et al. 1992, 2001; Downie and Palmer 
1992; Judd et al. 1994; Backlund and Bremer 1998; Back- 
lund and Pyck 1998; Kallersjé et al. 1998; Savolainen et al. 
2000b; D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer 
et al. 2001; Bremer et al. 2002; Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; 
Theis et al. 2008; Jacobs et al. 2009). The multigene analy- 
sis of Bremer et al. (2002) strongly supported relationships 
among the component families of Caprifoliaceae s.]. found 
in a cladistic analysis of non-DNA characters (Judd et al. 
1994). Donoghue et al. (2001) provided a comprehensive 
overview of the order. 
Within Caprifoliaceae s.l., Diervillaceae are sister to the 
rest of the clade. Caprifoliaceae s.s. are sister to the Lin- 
naeaceae, Morinaceae, Dipsacaceae + Valerianaceae clade 
(Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; Jacobs et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 
2011). Caprifoliaceae s.s. are united by 4-5 carpels and an 
indeterminate inflorescence (Judd et al. 1994, 2002). The 
clade of Diervillaceae, Linnaeaceae, Valerianaceae, and 
Dipsacaceae (Backlund and Pyck 1998; Albach et al. 2001c; 
Bremer et al. 2002) exhibits an achene fruit (rather than a 
berry or drupe), a base chromosome number of x = 8, and 
abortion of two or three carpels leaving a single-ovuled car- 
pel occupying half of the ovary (Judd et al. 1994). They also 
produce bis-secoiridoids, such as sylvestroside and related 
compounds (Jensen et al. 1979; Plouvier 1992; Capasso 
et al. 1996). Jacobs et al. (2009) showed the fleshy fruits of 
the Lonicera clade to be derived within the order and sug- 
gested that the ancestral state may have been achene fruits. 
Removal of Abelia and tribe Linnaea from Caprifolia- 
ceae s.s. was proposed based on morphology (Donoghue 
1983), including a putative reduction in the number of 
seeds, stamens, and fertile locules in the ovary in the former. . 
Morphological and molecular evidence ultimately resulted 
in the description of the family Linnaeaceae (Backlund and 
Pyck 1998). However, Linnaeaceae now are recognized 
within Caprifoliaceae s.l. Strong support for a sister-group 
relationship between the Dipsacaceae and Valerianaceae 
clades has been provided in several molecular analyses 
(e.g., Albach et al. 2001c; Bremer et al. 2002; Winkworth 
et al. 2008a,b; Jacobs et al. 2009; Soltis et al. 2011). The 
two clades are united by reduced or absence of endosperm 
and a modified calyx. 
The fossil record of Dipsacales is incomplete, but there 
are notable examples representing both Adoxaceae and 
Caprifoliaceae s.l. Pollen of Viburnum can be distinctive 
when studied by both SEM and LM. Viburnum pollen has 
been documented from the middle Eocene Princeton Chert 
of British Columbia (Manchester et al. 2015), showing the 
high reticulum with numerous free-standing columellae in 
the luminae, typical of the Solenotinus and Tinus clades 
and in Viburnum clemensiae (e.g., Donoghue 1985, pers. 
comm.). Caprifoliaceae are represented by winged fruits of 
Linnaeoideae (Caprifoliaceae) from the late Eocene includ- 
ing representing the extant genus Dipelta in the late Eocene 
of Southern England (Reid and Chandler 1926) and Missis- 
sippi (Fig. 11.23f; Manchester et al. 2009) and the extinct 
genus Diplodipelta (Manchester and Donoghue 1995)

Several pollen types present among extant Dipsacales are 
distinctive (Donoghue 1985) and readily recognizable in 
the paleobotanical record. Examples of the distinctive echi- 
nate pollen of Linnaeoideae are known from the Eocene of 
Greenland (Fig. 11.23d,e), Germany, and North America 
(Manchester et al. 2015). 
PARACRYPHIALES 
Paracryphiales consist of the woody species, Paracryphia 
alticola (Paracryphiaceae s.s.), native to New Caledonia, 
as well as Sphenostemon (previously Sphenostemonaceae) 
and Quintinia (previously Quintiniaceae), all now placed 
within one family, Paracryphiaceae 
(Stevens 2001 
on- 
wards; see Chapter 12). Several phylogenetic analyses 
have supported this clade as a member of the campanu- 
lids (Savolainen et al. 2000b; Bremer et al. 2002; Tank 
and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011) likely as sister to 
Dipsacales (Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011), 
although support for this placement has been weak; this 
placement should be considered tentative 
(Fig. 11.20). 
Ouintinia was resolved as sister to Paracryphia + Spheno- 
stemon (Fig. 11.20). 
The relationships of Paracryphia had long been de- 
bated. Cronquist (1981) placed the genus in Theales (Dil- 
leniidae). Takhtajan (1997) and Thorne (1992a,b 2000) 
also considered the species 
a member of Theales (see also 
Schmid 1978). Paracryphia exhibits an unusual combina- 
tion of characters (Dickison and Baas 1977). In vegetative 
anatomy, the species is unspecialized, whereas in some as- 
pects of floral morphology, it appears highly specialized 
(Takhtajan 1997). Likewise, Sphenostemon, comprising 
seven species, is another enigmatic genus. Cronquist (1981) 
placed the genus in his Aquifoliaceae, as did Takhtajan 
(1997; his Icacinales + Aquifoliales). Quintinia was often 
included within Hydrangeaceae or Saxifragaceae (Stevens 
2001 onwards). Stevens (2001 onwards) includes tetram- 
erous flowers and septicidal capsules as synapomorphies 
for Paracryphiales, although Ouintinia often deviates from 
this morphology. More study of morphological characters 
would greatly enhance our knowledge of this group. 
APIALES 
Apiales, with approximately 494 genera and 5489 spe- 
cies, consist of 7 families following APG III and APG IV 
(2009, 2016; Fig. 11.20): Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Griselini- 
aceae, Myodocarpaceae, 
Pennantiaceae, 
Pittosporaceae, 
and Torricelliaceae (several are illustrated in Fig. 11.22; see 
also Plunkett et al. 1997a,b, 2001, 2004a; Plunkett 2001; 
Plunkett and Lowry 2001; Lowry et al. 2001; Chandler 
and Plunkett 2004; Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; Tank and 
Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). In recent classifica- 
tions (e.g., Cronquist 1981), Apiales have been included 
in Rosidae; their placement within asterids, as evident in 
all molecular phylogenetic studies, was not anticipated. 
In morphology-based classifications, the order was often 
limited to Apiaceae and Araliaceae. Griseliniaceae and 
Torricelliaceae (including Aralidiaceae and Melanophyl- 
laceae) were often included in Cornaceae (Rosidae); Pit- 
tosporaceae were also considered part of Rosidae, and Pen- 
nantia was placed in Icacinaceae. Mackinlaya (Apiaceae) 
and Myodocarpus (Myodocarpaceae) were both formerly 
placed in Araliaceae. 
Apiales consist of taxa with mostly choripetalous flow- 
ers, whereas most euasterids are characterized by sympet- 
aly. However, Erbar and Leins (1996) showed that mem- 
bers of Apiales exhibit early sympetaly. Thus, choripetaly 
(or at least sympetalous flowers with well-developed lobes) 
is a synapomorphy for Apiales (assuming that sympetaly 
is a synapomorphy for all asterids), together with sheath- 
ing petioles (Bremer et al. 2001). Additional putative syn- 
apomorphies may include the presence of polyacetylenes 
(but some taxa have not been sampled), small flowers with 
sepals that are reduced in size or even obsolete, a reduc- 
tion to only two ovules in each locule (but often even more 
reduced), and a drupe with 1-5 pits (but variously modified 
in some groups). 
: 
The fossil record of Apiales is meager. Pollen of Aralia- 
ceae, characterized by thick exine, elongate endoapertures, 
extine thickening adjacent to apertures, and microreticu- 
late to reticulate or rugulate (perforate, fossulate) orna- 
mentation visible by SEM, has been recognized from the 
Late Cretaceous (early Campanian) and Eocene of western 
North America, and the Paleocene and Eocene of Greenland 
and Eocene of British Columbia (Manchester et al. 2015). 
Pollen assignable to Aralia, distinguished by its thickened 
exine in polar areas in combination with other general fea- 
tures of Araliaceae, is recognized from the Eocene Prince- 
ton Chert of British Colombia (Manchester et al. 2015). 
Late Cretaceous fruits of Apiaceae include Carpites ulmi- 
formis Dorf from the Maastrichtian of Montana and Wyo- 
ming based on winged fruits with a persistent epigynous 
calyx (Fig. 11.23g; Manchester and O’Leary 2010). Schizo- 
carpic apiaceous fruits preserving stylopodium, persistent 
epigynous perianth and recurved style arms, have been re- 
covered from the Eocene Green River Formation of Utah 
(Fig. 11.23h,i). Fossil fruits named Paleopanax represent 
the schizocarpic fruit type and persistent epigynous peri- 
anth characteristic of Araliaceae s.l. from the Eocene of Or- 
egon (Manchester 1994b). Distinctive trilocular fruits with 
a pair of sterile locules surrounding a central fertile locule, 
diagnostic of the extant genus Torricellia, are known from 

the middle Eocene of Oregon (Fig. 11.23j;Manchester 
1999) and Middle Eocene to Miocene of Germany (Meller 
2006; Collinson et al. 2012). 
The oldest potential Apiales fossil, and indeed the old- 
est potential superasterid, is the fruit called Araliaecar- 
pum Samylina from the early Cretaceous (Albian) Buor- 
Kemiusskaja locality near the Zyrianka River in eastern 
Siberia (Fig. 11.23k-l; Samylina 1960) (Supplementary 
Table 11.1). The flattened, syncarpous fruit, 6 mm long, 
consists of two carpels borne on a thin pedicel. It is possible 
that the fruits were schizocarpic as suggested by transverse 
section (Fig. 11.23m,n). An important question is whether 
the fruits developed from epigynous or from hypogynous 
flowers. If hypogynous, then some malvid families—for 
example, Brassicaceae, Sapindaceae—might come 
into 
consideration. There is no obvious swelling at the junc- 
tion of the fruit and pedicel that would be interpreted as 
the position of hypogynous perianth. On the other hand, 
there is no obvious perianth bulge or scar at the apical side 
of the fruit. More detailed comparative work is needed to 
assess whether the resemblance to Apiaceae is more than 
superficial. 
The relationships of Apiales within Campanulids are 
unclear. Most analyses suggest a sister relationship with 
Dipsacales + Paracryphiales with Bruniales sister to the en- 
tire clade (Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011; 
Fig. 11.20), although this topology is poorly supported. 
Tank and Donoghue (2010) found Escalloniaceae to be sis- 
ter to the Bruniales, Apiales, Paracryphiales + Dipsacales 
clade, although this position 
is also not highly supported 
(see Soltis et al. 2011, and above, for alternate position of 
Escalloniaceae). Pittosporaceae, Araliaceae, and Torricellia 
share a base chromosome number of x = 12 with Escal- 
lonia. Griselinia has x = 9, a number found in some Apia- 
ceae and common in campanulids (e.g., many Asterales and 
Adoxaceae). Pennantia (Pennantiaceae), previously placed 
in Icacinaceae, has been resolved as sister to the remain- 
der of the order (Karehed 2002; Winkworth et al. 2008a,b; 
Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011; Fig. 11.20). 
Torricelliaceae 
(including Melanophyllaceae and Arali- 
diaceae), Griseliniaceae, and Pittosporaceae are well sup- 
ported as subsequent sisters to a well-supported clade of 
Araliaceae and Apiaceae + Myodocarpaceae (Tank and 
Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011), in line with earlier to- 
pologies (Bremer et al. 2002). 
Araliaceae + Apiaceae + Myodocarpaceae is well sup- 
ported: these plants have petroselenic acid in the seeds, 
umbelliferose, inflorescences that are variously umbellate 
(Fig. 11.22), flowers with an open calyx, a valvate corolla, 
and a stylopodium, and flattened, schizocarpic fruits, all 
likely synapomorphic. Winkworth et al. (2008a,b) resolved 
Myodocarpaceae as sister to Araliaceae, but this placement 
Superasterids 
295 
was poorly supported. Plunkett et al. (2004b) first clarified 
the positions of several “ancient araliads” and enigmatic 
hydrocotyloids of Apiaceae, resulting in the recognition 
of Myodocarpaceae. Myodocarpaceae contain Myodocar- 
pus, Delarbrea, and Pseudosciadium (Plunkett and Lowry 
2001; Plunkett et al. 2004a), and Lui et al. (2010) provided 
further morphological characters for recognizing the fam- 
ily. Mackinlayaceae have been included within Apiaceae 
in most recent treatments (APG III 2009; see also Stevens 
2001 onwards; Nicolas and Plunkett 2009; Soltis et al. 
2011). Additional phylogenetic and phylogenomic analy- 
ses of Apiales, Apiaceae, and Araliaceae include Plunkett 
et al. (1996a,b, 2004a,b), Downie et al. (1998, 2000a,b), 
Plunkett and Downie (1999), Henwood and Hart (2001), 
Chandler and Plunkett (2004), Chandler et al. (2007), 
Smith and Donoghue (2008), Winkworth et al. (2008a,b), 
Nicolas and Plunkett (2009), Downie et al. (2010), and 
R. Li et al. (2013). Several members of Apiales are illus- 
itatedn Figs. 12201123. 
BRUNIALES 
Although resolving the position of Bruniaceae has been 
problematic (Olmstead et al. 1993; Savolainen et al. 2000b; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c), multigene analy- 
ses have shown that Bruniaceae and Columelliaceae are 
sisters and are now placed in Bruniales (Bremer et al. 2002; 
Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011; Fig. 11.20). 
Bruniaceae are considered a well-defined family of 12 gen- 
era native to southern Africa. The family has at times been 
associated with Hamamelidaceae. However, most modern 
classifications have placed the family among what were 
considered the woody relatives of Saxifragaceae in Rosales 
(e.g., Greyiaceae, Escalloniaceae, Columelliaceae, Grossu- 
lariaceae of Cronquist 1981). However, Takhtajan (1997) 
placed the family with Grubbiaceae (now in Cornales) in 
Bruniales in Dilleniidae. Two genera, Berzelia (sometimes 
considered a separate family, Berzeliaceae) and Brunia, 
have standardly been sampled in molecular analyses, with 
one or the other genus used as a placeholder for Bruni- 
aceae; both Tank and Donoghue (2010) and Soltis et al. 
(2011) found them to be sister taxa. Brunia is illustrated 
in bigs de22. 
Columelliaceae as previously circumscribed consist of 
the genus Columellia with four species native to the Andes. 
Cronquist (1981) considered the family taxonomically iso- 
lated, but placed them in Rosales with several other genera 
and families now recognized as part of the asterid clade. 
Takhtajan (1997) envisioned a relationship of Columellia 
to some of the same “escallonioid” taxa, but placed these 
families in his Hydrangeales (Cornidae). There was strong 
molecular support for a sister relationship of Columellia 

296 Chapter 11 
and Desfontainia 
(formerly 
Desfontainiaceae) 
(Bremer 
et al. 2002; Tank and Donoghue 2010; Soltis et al. 2011). 
Desfontainia is another enigmatic genus, usually included in 
Loganiaceae (Gentianales) (see Cronquist 1981). However, 
Takhtajan (1997) placed Desfontainiaceae in its own order 
near Hydrangeales and noted a possible close relationship 
between Desfontainiaceae and Columelliaceae, supported 
by similarities in wood anatomy (Mennega 1980). Given 
the close relationship between Columellia and Desfontai- 
nia, the two have been combined to form a single family, 
Columelliaceae (Bremer et al. 2002; APG II 2003; APG III 
2009); that circumscription is followed here (see Chapter 
12). The relationship of Bruniales to other asterids is still 
unclear. Most recent analyses have recovered Bruniales as 
sister to an Apiales, Paracryphiales, Dipsacales clade, but 
with low bootstrap support (62% in Tank and Donoghue 
2010; <50% in Soltis et al. 2011). 
PATTERNS OF CHARACTER EVOLUTION 
The asterid clade affords an excellent opportunity to exam- 
ine the evolution of several key morphological! and chemi- 
cal characters, including sympetaly, integument number, 
nucellar condition, floral symmetry, and iridoid produc- 
tion. Many of these non-DNA characters were examined 
in a phylogenetic context by Albach et al. (2001b) using 
the four-gene topology for this large clade (Albach et al. 
2001c), and the evolution of floral symmetry was addressed 
by Donoghue et al. (1998), and Howarth and Donoghue 
(2005, 2009). However, because phylogenetic relationships 
within the asterid clade are now better understood (e.g., 
Olmstead et al. 2001; Bremer et al. 2002; Karehed 2002; 
Xiang et al. 2002; Lundberg and Bremer 2003; Plunkett 
et al. 2004a; Jansen et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2007, 2010, 
2011; Soltis et al. 2011; Ruhfel et al. 2014), we evaluate 
the evolution of several key features. We used a topology 
that closely reflects that in Soltis et al. (2011), but with 
specific subclades modified by increased taxon sampling 
to reflect recent phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Ericales, Kron 
et al. 2002, Schonenberger et al. 2005; Apiales, Plunkett 
and Lowry 2001, Karehed 2002, and Plunkett et al. 2004a; 
Cornales, Xiang et al. 2002, 2011; Asterales, Lundberg and 
Bremer 2003, Lundberg 2009; Tank and Donoghue 2010; 
Lamiales, Olmstead et al. 2001, Refulio-Rodriguez and 
Olmstead 2014). 
Sympetaly characterizes most asterids, and the core of 
this clade has been recognized as a natural group in clas- 
sifications for more than 200 years on this basis (e.g., de 
Jussieu 1789; de Candolle 1813; Reichenbach 1827-1829). 
A suite of embryological and chemical characters also ap- 
pears to be highly but not perfectly correlated with sym- 
petaly: unitegmy (Warming 1879), tenuinucellate ovules 
(cf. Warming 1879; Philipson 1974), cellular endosperm 
formation (Sporne 1954; Dahlgren 1975), terminal endo- 
sperm haustoria (Dahlgren 1977), pollen grains released at 
the tricellular stage (Dahlgren 1975), and iridoids (Dahl- 
gren et al. 1981). 
Nearly all eudicots. with sympetalous corollas are aste- 
rids. Notable exceptions are Plumbaginaceae (Caryophyl- 
lales), Caricaceae (Brassicales: rosids), and Cucurbitaceae 
(Cucurbitales: rosids), in which sympetalous corollas un- 
doubtedly evolved independently. Even within asterids, 
homology of sympetaly is not certain because sympetalous 
corollas may arise through different ontogenetic pathways 
(Erbar 1991) and have been derived many times (at least 
four or more; Olmstead et al. 1992; Albach 1998). Conse- 
quently, additional information, particularly on the devel- 
opment of sympetalous corollas, is needed for many groups 
before the evolutionary history of sympetaly can be clarified. 
Instead of examining the evolution of sympetaly itself, 
we therefore present hypotheses of the evolution of those 
characters typically associated with sympetaly in asterids: 
unitegmy, tenuinucellate ovules, cellular endosperm for- 
mation, trinucleate pollen, and iridoids. The evolution of 
these characters was studied by Albach et al. (2001b). Us- 
ing Albach et al.’s (2001c) phylogenetic tree (see above), we 
provide an abbreviated discussion of these patterns in the. 
following sections. 
UNITEGMY 
Unitegmy, although typically associated with sympetaly 
(cf. Warming 1879; Olmstead et al. 1993), also occurs fre- 
quently outside asterids (certain magnoliids, some members 
of rosids, Ceratophyllaceae; Philipson 1974; Corner 1976; 
Endress 2011a-c). Multiple transitions to unitegmic ovules 
are supported by the discovery of multiple ontogenetic 
pathways to unitegmy (Bouman and Calis 1977; Bouman 
1984), although a general lack of information on ovule 
ontogeny hinders attempts to relate the distribution of 
unitegmy to specific mechanisms of unitegmic ovule forma- 
tion. Our assignment of unitegmic versus bitegmic ovules 
is based on Philipson (1974), Corner (1976), Cronquist 
(1981), and Takhtajan (1997). The ancestral condition of 
asterids appears to be unitegmy based on the reconstruc- 
tion presented here (Fig. 11.24). Most angiosperms outside 
the asterid clade have bitegmic ovules, except for Santala- 
les, which are either unitegmic or totally lack integuments, 
along with drastically reduced ovules, in some members 
(Brown et al. 2010; see Endress 2011c). Both Caryophyl-

Ovule type 
lales and Berberidopsidales exhibit bitegmic ovules and are 
sister to asterids (Fig. 11.20). 
Cornales are sister to all other asterids, and have uni- 
tegmic ovules. Likewise, the most recent common ancestor 
of campanulids and lamiids was clearly unitegmic, most 
likely a plesiomorphic state, although there were two shifts 
to bitegmy, one in Vahliaceae and one in Icacinaceae s.s. 
(Emmotum; Endress and Rapini 2014; not included here) 
(Fig. 11.24). However, the situation is more complex in Eri- 
cales, the immediate sister to the lamiid + campanulid clade. 
Bitegmy occurs frequently in Ericales (cf. Endress 2003b) 
and is reconstructed as the most probable ancestral state 
for this clade using both MP and ML (Fig. 11.24). Within 
Ericales, independent shifts to unitegmy have occurred on 
many occasions (perhaps six times using MP or ML) in 
(1) some Balsaminaceae (reported to have both bitegmy 
and unitegmy; Boesewinkel and Bouman 1991; Albach 
et al. 2001b; McAbee et al. 2005; Colombo et al. 2008;

have been further shifts to unitegmy; the entire

unitegmic. Vahliaceae is interesting, being the

Cyrillaceae, Actinidiaceae, Roridulaceae, Sarraceniaceae), 
(4) Polemoniaceae, (5) Sapotaceae, and (6) Diapensiaceae— 
Styracaceae-Symplocaceae. The last clade is of interest be- 
cause there may have been a reversal to bitegmy in Halesia 
(Styracaceae) (Fig. 11.24). 
Four possible pathways from bitegmy to unitegmy have 
been proposed (Bouman and Calis 1977; Boesewinkel and 
Bouman 1991): (1) reduction of one integument, (2) fusion 
of two integument primordia, (3) shift of the inner integu- 
ment along a subdermal outer integument, and (4) shift of a 
dermal outer integument along the inner integument. How- 
ever, the developmental sequence for unitegmy has rarely 
been studied. Asterids, in general, appear to have lost one 
integument by integumentary shifting (pathway 3 or 4; 
Bouman and Schier 1979; Boesewinkel and Bouman 1991; 
see review by Albach et al. 2001b, for pathways in other 
angiosperms). Genes that cause loss or deformation of one 
integument have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana 
(e.g., Robinson-Beers et al. 1992; Leon-Kloosterziel et al. 

298 Chapter 11 
1994; Gaiser et al. 1995; Baker et al. 1997) and provide 
possible mechanisms for the transition from bitegmy to 
unitegmy. However, given the number of genes involved 
in ovule development, it seems likely that integument for- 
mation and transition to unitegmy may require changes in 
several genes (Leon-Kloosterziel et al. 1994; Baker et al. 
1997). Hence, there may be several genetic mechanisms by 
which these transitions can be achieved. 
Endress (2011c) suggested that pathway 2 may be more 
likely in asterids, where both integuments are present but 
not morphologically distinguishable. This is further cor- 
roborated by Impatiens (Balsaminaceae: 
Ericales) that 
shows both uni- and bitegmy (McAbee et al. 2005; Co- 
lombo et al. 2008; Kelley and Gasser 2009). Coriaria (Co- 
riariaceae: Cucurbitales, rosids) also exhibits both uni- and 
bitegmy (Matthews and Endress 2006). It remains uncer- 
tain whether unitegmic ovules in asterids are developmen- 
tally and genetically homologous.

TENUINUCELLATE OVULES 
Tenuinucellate ovules are defined by the absence of parietal 
tissue between the megaspore mother cell and the nucellar 
epidermis (Bouman 1984, and references therein). As with 
sympetaly and integument number, interpretation of tenui- 
nucellate, or further reduced ovules versus crassinucellate 
ovules is not always clear because different processes may 
lead to similar nucellar structures (Endress 2003b); there- 
fore some researchers have revised terminology to depict 
those differences in nucellar structure (see Endress 2011c). 
However, although information on nucellar development is 
critical for determining ontogenetic homology of nucellar 
structure, this information is lacking for most angiosperms, 
and our analysis relies on reports of tenuinucellate versus 
crassinucellate ovules taken from Philipson (1974), Corner 
(1976), Cronquist (1981), and Takhtajan (1997). 
Tenuinucellate ovules occur throughout asterids, with 
only a few exceptions (i.e., some Cornales, many Apiales,

sals to crassinucellate ovules based on MP. 

Viburnum, Garryales, and Icacinales [Emmotwm, Endress 
and Rapini 2014]; Fig. 11.25); the ancestral state recon- 
structed here for asterids is tenuinucellate. Santalales, sister 
to the rest of the superasterids, also have mostly tenuinu- 
cellate ovules (Endress 2011c); our reconstruction suggests 
that the ancestral state for superasterids is- also tenuinu- 
cellate (Fig. 11.22). However, angiosperms outside of as- 
terids, including the immediate sister clade to the asterids, 
Caryophyllales + Berberidopsidales, have crassinucellate 
ovules (Endress 2011c; Fig. 11.25). Although tenuinucel- 
late ovules characterize asterids in general and some clades 
are exclusively tenuinucellate (Lamiales, Solanales, Gentia- 
nales, Asterales, Escalloniales, and Ericales), crassinucellate 
ovules have evolved at least seven times considering our re- 
construction (Fig. 11.25); they occur in at least some Cor- 
nales, Apiales, Dipsacales, Aquifoliales, Bruniales, and Gar- 
ryales. Thus, multiple transitions between tenuinucellate 
and crassinucellate ovules are apparent (Fig. 11.25), and 
both types have been reported within single species of Vi- 
burnum (Philipson 1974). Transitions from tenuinucellate 
to crassinucellate ovules have occurred in Berzelia (Bru- 
niaceae), Griselinia and Araliaceae (Apiales), Viburnum 
(Adoxaceae), and Garryales. Nyssa (Nyssaceae), Alangium, 
and Cornus (Cornaceae) in Cornales represent additional 
transitions to crassinucellate ovules. A single loss of pari- 
etal tissue leading to production of tenuinucellate ovules 
has been inferred for the Ericales-lamiids-campanulid clade 
(i.e., all asterids other than Cornales). A different onto- 
genetic pathway may, however, be responsible for tenui- 
nucellate ovules in Cornales:and some rosid families (see 
Philipson 1974). Our assessment of evolutionary patterns 
in ovule structure will be improved through additional in- 
formation on ovule development (Albach et al. 2001b). 
ENDOSPERM FORMATION 
Patterns of endosperm formation may be related to nucellus 
development, because a nucellus without protection from 
parietal tissue may favor a cellular endosperm, whereas a 
well-developed nucellus may experience a delay in cell wall 
formation, resulting in free nuclear endosperm (e.g., Wun- 
derlich 1959; Dahlgren 1975). Thus, cellular endosperm 
formation is expected in asterids in which tenuinucellate 
ovules predominate. However, cellular endosperm forma- 
tion is also common in Magnoliales, Laurales, and Pipera- 
les and is proposed to be ancestral in the angiosperms (e.g., 
Coulter and Chamberlain 1903; Schirhoff 1926; Glisic 
1928; Swamy and Ganapathy 1957; Wunderlich 1959; 
Friedman 1992, 1994). Therefore, cellular endosperm for- 
mation in the asterids may represent either the retention of 
Superasterids 
299 
the ancestral cellular endosperm or a reversal (e.g., Sporne 
1954; Swamy and Ganapathy 1957; Dahlgren 1991). Re- 
cent studies of endosperm development reveal that tradi- 
tional categories of endosperm formation—that is, cellular, 
nuclear, helobial—do not capture the diversity of develop- 
mental pathways, and patterns considered “nuclear,” for 
example, in many species may not be ontogenetically ho- 
mologous (Floyd et al. 1999; Floyd and Friedman 2000). 
Because developmental data are available for relatively 
few species, here we report analyses of the asterids that are 
based on the traditional designations of endosperm forma- 
tion as cellular versus nuclear, from Rao (1972), Corner 
(1976), Cronquist (1981), Kamelina 
(1984), Dahlgren 
(1991), and Takhtajan (1997), but we recognize that at 
least some such designations may require reevaluation. Cel- 
lular endosperm is reconstructed as ancestral for the aste- 
rids (see Albach et al. 2001b). Although rosids and Caryo- 
phyllales have nuclear endosperm, cellular endosperm is 
present in Santalales. Furthermore, cellular endosperm is 
widespread in Cornales and Ericales and is reconstructed 
as ancestral for both of these clades. The reconstructions of 
Albach et al. (2001b), as well as our reconstructions (not 
shown) based on more recent topologies, indicated many 
independent derivations of nuclear endosperm formation: 
once in Cornales (in Alangium), perhaps twice in Ericales, 
and multiple times in lamiids and campanulids. In lamiids, 
there were derivations of nuclear endosperm in Gentianales 
(see Wagenitz 1959), Garrya, Convolvulaceae, and Bora- 
ginaceae; in campanulids, nuclear endosperm is present in 
Irvingbaileya and most Apiales. Several of these derivations 
match reversals to crassinucellate ovules, supporting Wun- 
derlich’s (1959) hypothesis of a close association between 
nucellar structure and patterns of endosperm development. 
Multiple derivations of nuclear endosperm development 
from cellular have also been observed across the angio- 
sperms as a whole (Floyd et al. 1999). Despite multiple 
transitions from cellular to nuclear endosperm in the as- 
terids, no reversals were identified, indicating that perhaps 
transformations from nuclear to cellular are not possible 
in asterids. An evaluation of this hypothesis requires addi- 
tional information on patterns and processes of endosperm 
development throughout the angiosperms. 
TRICELLULAR POLLEN 
In most angiosperms, pollen grains are shed when the mi- 
crogametophyte reaches the bicellular stage. In some, how- 
ever, including many asterids, pollen grains are shed at the 
tricellular stage. Release of pollen at the tricellular stage 
has been considered a selective advantage under certain 

300 Chapter 11 
circumstances (Stebbins 
1974). However, this character 
is generally uniform within large clades recognized as or- 
ders or families. Data on bicellular versus tricellular pollen 
grains were obtained from Brewbaker (1967), Kamelina 
(1984), Eyde (1988), Takhtajan (1997), and Albach et al. 
(2001b). Pollen shed in a tricellular state occurs mostly in 
asterids, Caryophyllales, some rosid families (e.g., Brassica- 
ceae), Alismatales, and Poaceae. The ancestral state for as- 
terids appears to be bicellular pollen (Albach et al. 2001b); 
tricellular pollen has not been reported in Cornales, and it

dependently in Irvingbaileya (Cardiopteridaceae), Astera-

and Dipsacales (reconstruction not shown). The pattern of 
pollen evolution is more complex in lamiids, in which both 
bicellular and tricellular pollen are present in members of 
several large clades (i.e., Lamiales, Boraginaceae, and Gen- 
tianales) and occasionally even within a single genus (Plan-

Reconstruction of the evolution of iridoids in Asterids. The evolution of iridoids in the asterids is mostly ambiguous in this reconstruction. However 
the occurrence of iridoids in Cornales, as well as the Campanulid + Lamiid clade (Gentianidae), is ancestral in both of those clades according to our reconstructions. 
The situation in Ericales is less clear, where the ancestral state is equivocal for iridoid production. However, the entire Ebenaceae + Primulaceae clade is reconstructed 
as having lost iridoids. 

apparent reversions from tricellular to bicellulat pollen (see 
Albach et al. 2001b), supporting Brewbaker’s (1967) sug- 
gestion of a unidirectional shift. Tricellular pollen appears 
to be associated with efficient cross-pollination (Stebbins 
1974) and sporophytic self-incompatibility, shorter stor- 
age longevity, and an aquatic habit with submersed flowers 
(Brewbaker 1957, 1967). 
IRIDOIDS 
Iridoids are monoterpenes characterized by a cyclopentan- 
opyran ring system with a double bond between C, and 
C, (Fig. 11.26). Iridoids may have several functions in 
plants, such as anti-herbivory (e.g., Bernays and De Luca 
1981; Bowers and Puttick 1988) or inhibition of seed ger- 
mination (Pardo et al. 1998). The occurrence of iridoids 
is highly correlated with sympetaly (Jensen et al. 1975), 
with only a few occurrences of iridoids outside asterids, 
in Stigmaphyllon (Malpighiaceae; Davioud et al. 1985), 
Homalium (Salicaceae; Ekabo et al. 1993), Bhesa (Centro- 
placaceae; Ohashi et al. 1993), Ailanthus (Simaroubaceae; 
Kosuge et al. 1994), Liquidambar (Altingiaceae; Plouvier 
1964; Jiang and Zhou 1992), Daphniphyllum (Daphni- 
phyllaceae; Inouye et al. 1966), and Paeonia (Paeoniaceae; 
Kolpalova and Popov 1994). Several clades within asterids 
do not produce iridoids, such as Solanales, some Apiales, 
Asteraceae (but see Wang and Yu 1998), and several fami- 
lies of Ericales (reviewed in Albach et al. 2001b). 
Iridoids have been classified by their chemical proper- 
ties, such as functional features or oxidation level (Kaplan 
and Gottlieb 1982), biosynthetic pathway (Jensen 1991), 
or a combination of the two (Jensen et al. 1975). However, 
the pathway followed in any given species is typically not 
known, and there may be several pathways to the same 
compound (Jensen 1991). Thus, an extensive classifica- 
tion based on biosynthetic pathway, although desirable, 
is not currently possible. However, two main, presumably 
mutually exclusive, pathways have been identified (Jensen 
1991): one leading to secoiridoids and a second to iridoids 
decarboxylated at the C, position. We report analyses of 
the presence or absence of (1) iridoids generally and (2) se- 
coiridoids; additional information on the distribution of 
iridoids can be found in Albach et al. (2001b). Data on the 
distribution of iridoids are from Kostecka-Madalska and 
Rymkiewick (1971), Jensen et al. (1975), Degut and Fursa 
(1980), El-Naggar and Beal (1980), Lammel and Rimpler 
(1981), Makboul (1986), Boros and Stermitz (1990, 1991), 
Jensen (1991, 1992), Nicoletti et al. (1991), Drewes et al. 
(1996), and von Poser et al. (1997). 
Iridoids are widespread in asterids (Fig. 11.23); the evo- 
lution and diversification of iridoids and related alkaloids 
Superasterids 
301 
are complex. Nevertheless, some patterns are evident. The 
presence of iridoids is reconstructed as ancestral using MP 
in at least three of the four subclades of asterids (Cornales, 
campanulids, lamiids). However, whether iridoid produc- 
tion is the ancestral state for all asterids, as suggested by 
Olmstead et al. (1993), is equivocal using either MP or ML 
(Fig. 11.26). Most of the transitions in asterids involve the 
loss of iridoids (Fig. 11.26), as in Hydrostachys and Phila- 
delphus of Cornales, at least two clades in lamiids, and five 
clades of campanulids (with perhaps a subsequent deriva- 
tion in Aster; Wang and Yu 1998). In Ericales, the ancestral 
state is also equivocal using either MP or ML; however, 
iridoid evolution is clearly dynamic within this clade also, 
with numerous transitions between iridoid production and 
lack of iridoid production. 
Secoiridoids, characterized by a ring fission between 
C, and C, and alkaloids derived from them, are mostly de- 
rived via loganin and secologanin (Cordell 1974) or their 
corresponding acids, but variants of this pathway have 
been recently reported (see Albach et al. 2001b). Secoiri- 
doids and related alkaloids occur in Oleaceae, Gentianales, 
most Cornales, and many campanulids (Fig. 11.26) and 
have been reported for Lamium album, although these are 
formed via a different biosynthetic pathway (Damtoft et al. 
1992). Aucubin and other iridoid compounds decarbox- 
ylated at C, seem also to have evolved independently in 
Lamiales, Garryales, and some Ericaceae (see Albach et al. 
2001b). Thus, presence of aucubin alone is not characteris- 
tic of any particular clade. 
FLORAL SYMMETRY 
Most asterids have zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric, 
monosymmetric) flowers. However, actinomorphic (radi- 
ally symmetric, polysymmetric) flowers are found in many 
lineages, including some or most of Apocynaceae, Astera- 
ceae, Boraginaceae 
s.l., Calyceraceae, Campanulaceae, 
Menyanthaceae, Oleaceae, Plocospermataceae, Rubiaceae, 
Tetrachondraceae, Apiales, Cornales, Dipsacales, Ericales, 
and Solanales. Given the wealth of floral developmental ge- 
netic data available for Antirrhinum (Plantaginaceae), as- 
terids present ideal opportunities for investigations of evo- 
lutionary changes in floral symmetry (e.g., Endress 1992a, 
1999; Donoghue et al. 1998; Reeves and Olmstead 1998). 
Donoghue et al. (1998) examined the evolution of floral 
symmetry in the asterids by grafting subclades of major 
subgroups of asterids onto a backbone tree based on rbcL 
sequences (Olmstead et al. 1993) and mapping character 
states using MacClade (Maddison and Maddison 1992). 
According to their analysis, the ancestral condition for as- 
terids was an actinomorphic flower. Zygomorphic flowers 

302 Chapter 11 
originated independently at least eight times in asterids, in 
Asterales, Dipsacales, Solanales, Ericales, Lamiales, and a 
few Gentianales. 
There are clear reversals from zygomorphy to actino- 
morphy within asterids. The greatest number of such shifts 
occurs in Lamiales, providing a model clade for more 
detailed examination of these reversals. Donoghue et al. 
(1998) therefore examined floral symmetry in more detail 
in Lamiales. Their most parsimonious reconstruction of an- 
cestral states (with equal costs of going from zygomorphy 
to actinomorphy and vice-versa) indicated at least seven 
reversals from zygomorphy to actinomorphy. 
We reanalyzed floral symmetry in Lamiales in light of 
more recent phylogenetic hypotheses (e.g., D. Soltis et al. 
2000; Olmstead et al. 2001; Bremer et al. 2002; Soltis et al. 
2011; Refulio-Rodriguez and Olmstead 2014), including

The plesiomorphic condition in Lamiales appears to be 
actinomorphic (basalmost taxa have actinomorphic corol- 
las; Plocospermataceae, Oleaceae, Tetrachondraceae), as 
shown in Zhong and Kellogg (2015) with a shift to zygo- 
morphy in the most recent common ancestor of the core 
Lamiales (i.e., the clade sister to Polypremum in our analy- 
sis) (Fig. 11.27), and Carlemanniaceae (not shown here; 
see Zhong and Kellogg 2015). Within the core Lamiales 
clade, there have been at least 14 reversals to actinomor- 
phy (Fig. 11.27). Actinomorphic flowers occur in other 
Gesneriaceae (see Clark et al. 2011) as well, and more de- 
tailed character-state mappings of that family are needed 
to elucidate further transitions between zygomorphy and 
actinomorphy. An additional reversal to near actinomor- 
phy may have occurred in Byblis (Fig. 11.27).

Reconstruction of floral symmetry in Lamiales using MP and ML. Lamiales are reconstructed as derived from ancestors with actinomorphic corollas. 
Bilaterally symmetric corollas first evolved with the common ancestor of Calceolariaceae + Acanthaceae according to MP. There have been at least 14 reversals to 
actinomorphic corollas in Lamiales according to the reconstruction shown here. 

Donoghue et al. (1998) explored possible-explanations 
for these reversals to actinomorphy. Plantago is an excel- 
lent organism in which to examine these shifts because it 
is well nested within a zygomorphic clade. This and other 
reversals to actinomorphy often co-occur with shifts from 
pentamery to tetramery and reduction in flower size. Other 
examples include reversals to actinomorphy in Buddleja, 
Callicarpa, and Petitia. A likely explanation is that actino- 
morphy arises in these taxa by union of the adaxial petals, 
accompanied by a shift in the orientation of the two lateral 
petals. Some derived actinomorphic flowers resemble mu- 
tants caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes such 
as CYCLOIDEA (CYC) (see Chapter 14), a gene that is 
Superasterids 
303 
needed for normal development of zygomorphic flowers 
(Carpenter and Coen 1990). Actinomorphic flowers in 
several genera of Gesneriaceae (e.g., Ramonda) and Sib- 
thorpia (Plantaginaceae) may have arisen via this mecha- 
nism. More recent studies have suggested that the origin of 
zygomorphy from actinomorphy, for instance in Lamiales, 
occurs through the asymmetrical expression of CYC2-like 
genes (Zhong and Kellogg 2015) (see Chapter 14); multiple 
paralogous copies of CYC genes have arisen throughout 
Lamiales (Zhong and Kellogg 2015). Zhong and Kellogg 
(2015) showed that the origin of zygomorphy in Lamiales 
was strongly correlated with the evolution and subsequent 
diversification of bumblebees and euglossine bees. 

Angiosperm Classification 
INTRODUCTION 
Until the late 1990s, most investigators, systematists and 
non-systematists alike, consulted one of a few classifica- 
tions of angiosperms (e.g., Dahlgren 1980; Cronquist 1981; 
Takhtajan 1980, 1987, 1997; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001). Dahl- 
gren et al.’s (1985) classification of monocots remained the 
system of choice for more than a decade. Although the sys- 
tems are generally similar, they differed in several respects. 
For example, Takhtajan established many small families 
and orders not recognized by other authors (e.g., Cron- 
quist 1981; Thorne 1992a,b, 2001; Heywood 1993). All of 
these classifications were based chiefly on morphological 
characters. Only Dahlgren (1980) used chemical data to a 
significant extent, and Thorne’s (1992a,b, 2001) updates 
incorporated information from molecular phylogenetics. In 
addition, only Dahlgren tried to think about classification 
in a formal phylogenetic sense (Dahlgren and Rasmussen 
1983; Dahlgren et al. 1985; see Chapter 3). 
Relationships among major groups of taxa (recognized, 
for example, as orders, subclasses) were often depicted in 
terms of phylogenetic shrubs or “bubble” diagrams that 
represented an author’s intuitive ideas of evolutionary re- 
lationships (see Chapter 3 and Fig. 3.7; Judd et al. 2002). 
In this sense, these classifications, and those tracing back to 
Bessey (1915), are semi-phylogenetic. However, the infer- 
ences of phylogeny were not based on topologies derived 
from the explicit phylogenetic analysis of either DNA or 
non-DNA 
characters. 
Irreconcilable 
differences among 
these classifications reflected subjective weights of charac- 
ters imposed by the authors. Nonetheless, the classifications 
of the last 25 years of the twentieth century represented tre- 
mendous improvements over earlier classifications in many 
ways. They contained more information on obscure taxa, 
and more characters were described. For these reasons, 
the classifications of Cronquist (1981), Takhtajan (1997), 
Thorne (1992a,b, 2001), and Heywood (1993, 1998) con- 
tinue to receive use. 
The past two decades have seen major advances in re-. 
construction of angiosperm phylogenetic relationships at 
all taxonomic levels, from species to higher levels (reviewed 
in Chapter 3); in this chapter, we focus primarily on de- 
velopments at the family level and above. As reviewed in 
Chapter 3, broad molecular phylogenetic analyses pro- 
vided the general framework of angiosperm relationships, 
and major suprafamilial clades of angiosperm families 
were also identified. 
THE ANGIOSPERM PHYLOGENY GROUP 
(APG) CLASSIFICATIONS 
It became clear that no previous “traditional” classifica- 
tion system adequately reflected the relationships of angio- 
sperms as reconstructed by molecular phylogenetics and 
that a dramatic change was needed. The molecular trees 
became the stimulus for a new classification proposed by 
a consortium of angiosperm systematists, the Angiosperm 
Phylogeny Group (APG). As a result of the APG’s efforts, 
angiosperms became the first large clade of organisms to be 
reclassified on the basis of explicit phylogenetic analysis of 
DNA sequence data. Furthermore, the first APG classifica- 
tion developed by 29 systematists (APG 1998) represented 

a landmark in the history of angiosperm systematics be- 
cause for the first time a classification was provided not by 
one or a few individuals, as had been the case for several 
hundred years, but by a broad representation of the system- 
atics community. 
The first APG system recognized 462 families placed in 
40 putatively monophyletic orders and a few monophyletic 
higher groups. The general strategy of the APG authors, as 
discussed in APG (1998), was to focus on orders and, to 
a lesser extent, on families. In general, orders were quite 
widely circumscribed, especially in comparison with those 
of Takhtajan (1997). Several formal clades above the level 
of order were also recognized, using informal names rather 
than Linnaean ranks: monocots, eudicots, core eudicots, 
rosids, and asterids, as well as two major subclades of the 
rosid clade (eurosids I and eurosids II, or fabids and malvids 
in APG Ill [2009] and APG IV [2016]; see Chapter 10) and 
the asterid clade (euasterids I and euasterids II or lamiids 
and campanulids in APG III [2009] and APG IV [2016]; see 
Chapter 11). The APG authors conservatively recognized 
only those clades that received moderate to strong sup- 
port in either phylogenetic analysis of rbcL gene sequences 
(Kallersjo et al. 1998; Chase and Albert 1998) or an initial 
analysis of a three-gene dataset (D. Soltis et al. 1998). 
In APG (1998), many families were not placed in an or- 
der because their positions were unknown or not strongly 
supported. When possible, these families of uncertain posi- 
tion were simply placed in the larger clade in which they 
appeared (e.g., asterids, rosids). For example, Adoxaceae, 
Bruniaceae, Icacinaceae, and several other families were 
placed within the euasterid II clade, but the positions of 
these families within euasterid II were unclear. 
Some families could not be reliably placed in any supra- 
ordinal group and were therefore placed at the end of the 
classification in a list of eudicot families of “uncertain posi- 
tion.” In APG (1998), 25 families could not be placed with 
confidence within any major clade. Other families could 
be placed within major clades, but not within any of the 
orders within that clade. 
Many monophyletic groups were recognized at the 
family level in APG (1998). In many cases, family circum- 
scriptions were unchanged or modified only slightly from 
longstanding concepts. In other cases, however, dramatic 
restructuring of familial boundaries was required. The APG 
(1998) authors also recognized the limitations of molecu- 
lar analyses available at that time. Reclassification of some 
families required further molecular phylogenetic study that 
used additional taxon sampling; still other families awaited 
phylogenetic analysis. 
APG (1998) provided names for previously unrecog- 
nized clades and much-needed nomenclatural 
stability. 
With the explosion of molecular systematic endeavors, 
Angiosperm Classification 
305 
different authors were using different names for the same 
clade. For example, the DNA-based asterid clade was vari- 
ously referred to as Asteridae, Asteridae s.]., asterids, and 
euasterids. 
The APG (1998) authors recognized that changes in fa- 
milial circumscription and recognition of new orders would 
ultimately be needed, requiring a revised APG classification. 
What was surprising, however, was how quickly an up- 
dated APG classification was needed. After publication of 
APG (1998), rapid advances in angiosperm phylogenetics 
continued (see Chapter 3). Completion of multigene analy- 
ses for all major groups of angiosperms (e.g., Savolainen 
et al. 2000a; P. Soltis et al. 1999b; D. Soltis et al. 2000), as 
well as more focused studies of monocots (e.g., Chase et al. 
2000a, 2004), asterids (Albach et al. 2001a; B. Bremer et al. 
2002), and many orders and families (see other chapters 
of this book), necessitated an update of the APG (1998) 
classification, resulting in APG II (2003). APG II involved 
fewer authors (seven) than the initial APG (1998). With the 
changes provided in APG II, the number of angiosperm or- 
ders increased from 40 to 44, and the number of families 
decreased from 462 to 397, if all suggestions to combine 
families are followed. In many instances, APG II suggested 
that sister families be combined; for example, Platanaceae 
and Proteaceae (Proteaceae), Nymphaeaceae and Cabom- 
baceae (Nymphaeaceae), and Illiciaceae and Schisandra- 
ceae (Schisandraceae). In these cases, investigators were 
given the choice in APG II to follow these broader circum- 
scriptions or not follow them, providing flexibility of the 
system, and many investigators have chosen not to use the 
broader circumscriptions. 
Note that in APG II, some families still remained un- 
placed. For example, Aphloiaceae, Ixerbaceae, Geissolo- 
mataceae, Picramniaceae, Strasburgeriaceae, and Vitaceae 
were unplaced to order in the rosids, and Bruniaceae, 
Columelliaceae, and Eremosynaceae were three of several 
families unplaced to order in euasterids II. In APG II, the 
placement of some taxa was considered uncertain across 
the angiosperms as a whole (e.g., Balanophoraceae, Raf- 
flesiaceae, Cytinus). However, the molecular phylogenetic 
analysis of Barkman et al. (2004) placed Rafflesiaceae in 
Malpighiales in the rosid clade. 
Further improvements in our understanding of evolu- 
tionary relationships across the angiosperms resulted in the 
revised APG III (2009) classification. In APG III (2009), 
the number of angiosperm orders was 57, and the num- 
ber of families was 413. However, some families remained 
unplaced in APG III, and detailed investigations of major 
problematic clades (e.g., Malpighiales, Lamiales, Santala- 
les) provided additional new insights into relationships, 
ultimately necessitating an updated classification. P. F. Ste- 
vens (Angiosperm Phylogeny Website; www.mobot.org/ 

306 Chapter 12 
MOBOT/research/APweb/) has continued to provide regu- 
lar updates and changes to the overall angiosperm classifi- 
cation. Many of these proposed changes, as well as others, 
have been incorporated in APG IV (2016). APG IV differs 
only slightly from APG III, and only where new phylogenetic 
information or nomenclatural issues necessitated changes. 
In the classification we present here (APG IV 2016), there 
are 64 orders of angiosperms and 416 families. 
RANKED VERSUS RANK-FREE 
CLASSIFICATION 
For more than 250 years, the Linnaean hierarchy (e.g., 
kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species), 
published in 1753, has been the foundation of taxonomy. 
However, the Linnaean hierarchy was established a century 
before publication of Darwin’s (1859) Origin of Species, 
which introduced the principle of descent with modifica- 
tion. During the past two decades, use of the Linnaean hi- 
erarchy has been challenged by investigators who seek to 
apply the principle of descent to the field of nomenclature. 
In fact, some have suggested that the Linnaean hierarchy 
be abandoned. 
De Queiroz (1997) made a distinction between taxo- 
nomic and nomenclatural systems. A Linnaean system, 
whether of taxonomy or nomenclature, is based on the Lin- 
naean hierarchy, whereas a phylogenetic system is based on 
the principle of descent (de Queiroz and Gauthier 1992; de 
Queiroz 1997). Phylogenetic classification is the represen- 
tation of phylogenetic relationships, and its aim is to pro- 
duce classifications that reflect phylogenetic relationships 
accurately and efficiently. A phylogenetic system of nomen- 
clature is a body of principles and rules (nomenclatural 
conventions) governing taxonomic practice, “the compo- 
nents of which are unified by their relation to the central 
tenet of evolutionary descent” (de Queiroz and Gauthier 
1992). 
Hennig, well known for introducing principles of phy- 
logeny reconstruction (Hennig 1950, 1965, 1966), also 
initiated the development of a phylogenetic system of clas- 
sification (Hennig 1969, 1981, 1983), and many other au- 
thors subsequently contributed its development. In a series 
of papers, de Queiroz and Gauthier (1990, 1992, 1994) 
attempted to formulate nomenclatural conventions based 
on the principle of descent, and specific rules and recom- 
mendations of phylogenetic nomenclature are still being 
developed (e.g., de Queiroz and Gauthier 1990, 1992, 
1994; Bryant 1994, 1996; Sundberg and Pleijel 1994; de 
Queiroz 1996; Lee 1996; Cantino et al. 1997; www.ohio 
.edu/phylocode/). 
Until recently, most phylogenetic systems of classifica- 
tion have attempted to use the basic conventions of the Lin- 
naean hierarchy. As several authors have noted, the familiar 
set of nested categories offered by the Linnaean system of 
classification (kingdom, phylum, class, order, etc.) can be 
used in phylogenetic classification to provide information 
on rank (that is, the relative nested positions of clades). 
However, Linnaean categories are not needed to provide 
this information to the reader and may, in fact, be a hin- 
drance to faithful communication of phylogenetic related- 
ness. Linnaean categories do not contain any information 
about ancestry that is not already present in a branching 
diagram or in an indented list of names. Furthermore, as- 
signment of taxa to categories is, alone, insufficient infor- 
mation to specify relationships. That is, knowing that one 
taxon is a family and another an order does not indicate 
that the family in question is nested within that given order. 
Although Linnaean categories can be used in such a way 
that they are consistent with phylogenetic classification, 
several problems have been cited (reviewed in de Queiroz 
and Gauthier 1992). One problem is that of “mandatory 
categories.” That is, certain categories (i.e., kingdom, phy- 
lum, class, order, family, and genus) are mandatory in the 
Linnaean system. Every named species must be assigned 
to a taxon at every one of these taxonomic levels, caus- 
ing a proliferation of names in the case of monotypic taxa 
(see below). Furthermore, ancestors cannot be assigned to 
monophyletic taxa less inclusive than those originating 
with them. These ancestors are not part of clades that are 
less inclusive than the one stemming from that ancestral 
node or population. For example, the stem species of the 
angiosperms would be included in Magnoliophyta, but not 
in any of the subgroups of Magnoliophyta (Chapter 2). 
The proliferation of categories that occurs asa di- 
rect result of the attempt to reflect fine levels of system- 
atic resolution is easily illustrated. As an example, if we 
consider the current summary topology for angiosperms 
(Fig. 12.1), Amborella appears as sister to all other angio- 
sperms. Hence, if angiosperms are treated as a phylum 
(Magnoliophyta), Amborella would belong to class Ambo- 
rellopsida, and all remaining angiosperms, which are the 
sister to Amborella, would be part of a second class (here 
labeled Euangiopsida). Within the class Euangiopsida, 
Nymphaeaceae are sister to all other angiosperms. Nym- 
phaeaceae would be placed in the order Nymphaeales, and 
their sister group (all remaining angiosperms) would be a 
separate order, here named Austrobaileyales. As illustrated 
in Figure 12.1, because the early-branching angiosperms 
form a graded series, the problem of proliferation of cat- 
egories would continue. In a short time, we would exhaust 
the taxonomic categories afforded by the Linnaean system 
and would need to introduce many additional taxonomic

An example of the proliferation of categories that results from an attempt to reflect fine levels of phylogenetic resolution. The topology used is one 
possible tree based on a summary of the three-gene analysis of angiosperms (Soltis et al. 2000). Names in lower case letters (i.e., eudicots, rosids, asterids) are com- 
mon names given to clades. Names in bold (e.g., Illiciaceae) represent an attempt to place the topology in a Linnaean-based hierarchical classification. We exhaust 
the taxonomic categories afforded by the Linnaean system very quickly and would need to introduce many more taxonomic categories (from Soltis et al. 2005). 

308 Chapter 12 
categories. Crane and Kenrick (1997a) similarly noted this 
problem of proliferation of hierarchical levels in their at- 
tempt to translate recent topologies for green plants into a 
classification that follows Linnaean ranks. 
Several modifications of the Linnaean system have been 
proposed to deal with this problem, but none is totally sat- 
isfactory. The addition of new taxonomic categories has 
been proposed (e.g., McKenna 1975; Farris 1976; Gaffney 
and Meylan 1988). Farris (1976), for example, proposed a 
method for producing new taxonomic categories that used 
rank-modifying prefixes. This method, although not widely 
used, could generate many taxonomic categories through 
the application of single-prefix as well as multi-prefix cat- 
egories (reviewed in Kron 1997). Other investigators at- 
tempted to avoid the proliferation of names and categories 
by introducing systems that conveyed information regard- 
ing phylogenetic relationships without using Linnaean cat- 
egories. Nelson (1972, 1973) noted that the sequence of 
taxon names in a list could be used to convey information 
about phylogenetic relationships. This method, which be- 
came known as the “sequencing convention,” greatly re- 
duced the number of taxa and categories, but it also left 
many clades unnamed (reviewed in de Queiroz 1997). 
Because of these and other problems associated with the 
use of Linnaean ranks, and because categories themselves 
are not needed for conveying phylogenetic relationships, 
some authors have proposed that the best way to imple- 
ment a phylogenetic classification is to abandon Linnaean 
categories. Phylogenetic nomenclature differs fundamen- 
tally from the Linnaean system (as governed by Interna- 
tional Codes of Nomenclature) in that it does not require 
ranks above the level of species (hence, it is often referred 
to as “rank-free”). The idea of a phylogenetic system as an 
alternative to the traditional Linnaean system is not new. 
Hennig (1969, 1981, 1983), for example, used numerical 
prefixes rather than Linnaean categories in his taxonomies 
of insects and chordates. Other investigators subsequently 
contributed to development of the concept and application 
of a rank-free classification (Griffiths 1973, 1976; Farris 
1976; Lovtrup 1977; Stevens 1984; Ax 1987; Ereshefsky 
1994). More recently, de Queiroz and Gauthier (1990, 
1992, 1994) further developed a phylogenetic system of 
nomenclature by discussing specific rules and principles. 
Their papers subsequently stimulated extensive discussion 
and debate (e.g., Bryant 1994, 1996; Wyss and Meng 1996; 
Cantino et al. 1997; de Queiroz 1997; Kron 1997; Can- 
tino 1998, 2000; Hibbett and Donoghue 1998). There have 
also been strong counter-arguments against phylogenetic 
nomenclature (e.g., Liden and Oxelman 1996; Brummitt 
1997; Stuessy 2000). Some authors stress, for example, that 
the problems noted with the Linnaean system can be ad- 
dressed without abandoning the Linnaean hierarchy. Thus, 
many systematists who readily embrace phylogenetic prin- 
ciples continue to use the Linnaean hierarchy (see Wiley 
1979, 1981; Wiley and Lieberman 2011; Eldredge and Cra- 
craft 1980). 
Phylogenetic nomenclature does not mandate that taxa 
be assigned to ranked categories such as genus, family, or 
order. Names such as Lamiaceae, Rosales, or Caryophyl- 
lales can be used, following phylogenetic nomenclature, 
without implying any taxonomic category; they are simply 
names of clades that do not have to correspond to ranks 
within a taxonomic hierarchy. Elimination of Linnaean 
ranks is not as dramatic a change as it might seem. For 
example, the APG classification of angiosperms is, in part, 
rank-free; above the.category of order, the Linnaean hierar- 
chy is not followed. The intent of the APG editors was not 
to use a rank-free system, but rather to name formally these 
higher levels only when their inter-relationships are clear. 
An advantage of phylogenetic nomenclature is that newly 
discovered clades can be named without changing the 
names of other taxa. A major problem with the Linnaean 
system is that ranks of taxa, and as a result names given 
to taxa, depend on their relative position to other groups 
of taxa. Thus, naming a new clade can require a cascading 
series of name changes (Kron 1997; Cantino 1998; Hibbett 
and Donoghue 1998; Cantino et al. 2007). A code of phy- 
logenetic nomenclature, referred to as the PhyloCode, has 
been developed (www.ohiou.edu/phylocode/). 
Other authors have proposed a compromise method 
of classification that includes elements of both Linnaean 
and phylogenetic nomenclature. For example, Sennblad 
and Bremer (2002) proposed a nomenclatural system for 
Apocynaceae that includes “standard” Linnaean tribal 
names, but, above that level, uses a variant of the defini- 
tions from the PhyloCode (Fig. 12.2) for an infrafamilial 
classification. Four rankless taxa are recognized, each end- 
ing in “ina” and each progressively more inclusive (Asclepi- 
adoidina, Asclepiadacina, Euapocynoidina, Apocynoidina). 
All APG classifications specifically assigned familial and 
ordinal names and hence are clearly Linnaean in intent. 
However, “families” and “orders” directly correspond to 
monophyletic groups and therefore could be incorporated 
into a rank-free system of classification (the PhyloCode 
Companion Volume, when published, will be a useful refer- 
ence for these clades). Above the level of order, a rank-free 
system of classification has quietly slipped into wide usage 
in the angiosperms, even among ardent advocates of Lin- 
naean classification. 
Thus, plant systematists readily use terms such as mono- 
cots, eudicots, core eudicots, rosids, asterids, and others 
(fabids, malvids, lamiids, campanulids), all of which ap- 
pear in the APG classifications and represent informal, 
yet highly meaningful, names for well-defined and well-

A “compromise” reclassification of Apocynaceae. Standard tribal names (Asclepiadeae, etc.) are given following the Linnaean system. However, four 
nonstandard taxa, Apocynoidina, Euapocynoidina, Asclepiadacina, and Asclepiadoidina, are also indicated (see text). (A) Nonstandard names superimposed on phylo- 
genetic tree of Apocynaceae. (B) Phylogenetic treatment in table form. (Modified from Sennblad and Bremer 2002; from Soltis et al. 2005.) 
supported clades. Forcing a Linnaean system of ranks 
and names onto the existing phylogenetic framework for 
angiosperms above the level of order would not help but 
hinder angiosperm systematics. That is, following the Lin- 
naean system of classifying and naming the asterid and ro- 
sid clades as subclasses (for example) Asteridae and Rosi- 
dae, respectively, would force a cascade of name changes 
throughout the angiosperms, as well as establishment of 
new ranks to accommodate sister groups. Furthermore, 
many clade names, such as the term “eudicots,” have be- 
come widely used, even among nonspecialists. What benefit 
would accrue, for example, from naming the eudicots as a 
class, and what implications would this change have for the 
nomenclature of the remaining angiosperms that form a 
grade sister to the eudicots? Thus, angiosperm systematics 
following the APG system (see also Stevens 2001 onwards, 
www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/) currently has 
a hybrid system with orders, families, genera, and species 
following the Linnaean system of classification, but a rank- 
free system above the level of order. 
Some investigators have been strong proponents of a 
rank-free system (e.g., Mishler 1999; Platnick 2009, 2012, 
2013; see also de Queiroz and Donoghue 2011, 2013, and 
de Queiroz 2013; Cellinese et al. 2012), but acceptance of 

310 Chapter 12 
such a system will take time. The formal classification of 
tracheophytes (Cantino et al. 2007) treats large, inclusive 
clades of angiosperms, and ongoing efforts to provide phy- 
logenetic definitions of clades corresponding to orders and 
families recognized by the APG classification are underway 
(de Queiroz et al. in prep.). However, it seems unlikely that 
a rank-free system will be widely used by angiosperm sys- 
tematists at levels corresponding to that of genus and be- 
low in the near future. Researchers who make use of ranks 
and who currently recognize clades at the ranks of genus, 
subgenus, section, and series will continue to do so into 
the forseeable future. In contrast, clades that are currently 
recognized above the ordinal rank (or that are given only 
informal names) will likely soon be widely recognized us- 
ing unranked formal names (either using the PhyloCode, or 
as yet unwritten new provisions to the existing ICN, which 
would allow such unranked formal names). Although the 
Linnaean system seems entrenched at the levels of order 
and below, rankless taxon names continue to be proposed 
and will likely continue to be used more and more fre- 
quently by plant systematists. Extension of the principles 
of rank-free phylogenetic classification to the species level, 
although logically consistent with the treatment of larger 
clades, is especially controversial and is unlikely to be re- 
solved in the foreseeable future (see Cellinese et al. 2012).

Parallel and Convergent Evolution 
INTRODUCTION 
Clarification of phylogenetic relationships at all levels 
across the angiosperm tree of life has had broad implica- 
tions, facilitating, for example, a more accurate assessment 
of character evolution. These topologies have provided in- 
sights into the evolution of key characters. Several morpho- 
logical and chemical features long thought to have evolved 
many times following traditional classifications are now 
established as having arisen once or only a few times. As 
reviewed earlier, glucosinolate production, a chemical de- 
fense long thought to have evolved recurrently (Cronquist 
1981; but see Dahlgren 1975), was shown to have evolved 
only twice (in Brassicales and again in Putranjivaceae; 
Chapter 10). Similarly, symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bac- 
teria was thought to have evolved many times, but molecu- 
lar analyses revealed instead that some set of predisposing 
traits for this character evolved only once, in the ancestor 
of the nitrogen-fixing clade (Chapter 10). However, within 
this one relatively small clade, nitrogen-fixing symbiosis 
may have evolved and/or been lost several times (see Chap- 
ter 10). 
Here we overview three features that are highly prone 
to parallel or convergent evolution: parasitism, carnivory, 
and C, photosynthesis. Molecular phylogenetic investiga- 
tions have helped to clarify the extent of parallelism or con- 
vergence of these traits and also have provided additional 
evolutionary insights. The possible parallel or convergent 
evolution of other features, including chemical characters 
(e.g., ellagic acid, iridoids), is examined in other chapters 
(Chapters 6 and 11). 
PARASITISM IN ANGIOSPERMS 
Although most angiosperms produce their own carbo- 
hydrates via photosynthesis (i.e., are autotrophic), some 
are heterotrophic. The latter comprise two types: myco- 
heterotrophs and haustorial parasites (see Nickrent et al. 
1998; Selosse and Cameron 2010). However, the terms 
are confusing—the two types are sometimes treated as a 
single category, “parasites” (Nickrent et al. 1998), some- 
times considered separately (Selosse and Cameron 2010), 
and sometimes viewed as part of a “mutualism—parasitism 
continuum” (Johnson et al. 1997; Merckx and Freuden- 
stein 2010). We provide a summary of terms (Table 13.1; 
taken from Nickrent et al. 1998, and Selosse and Cameron 
2010) and follow their strict definition in which a parasite 
is considered “a symbiotic association in which an organ- 
ism obtains at least some of its nutrition directly from an- 
other organism.” A restrictive definition in plants includes 
only parasites with haustorial connections to other plants, 
not mycoheterotrophs. The term parasite therefore in- 
cludes hemiparasites, holoparasites, facultative parasites, 
and obligate parasites, but some would exclude mycohet- 
erotrophs (see below and Parasitic Plant Connection, www 
.parasiticplants.siu.edu/). 
Mycoheterotrophs derive nutrients indirectly from the 
host plant through a symbiotic relationship with mycor- 
rhizae. In contrast, haustorial parasites directly penetrate 
host tissues via an haustorium (often a modified root). Cat- 
egorizing mycoheterotrophs is problematic. Some do not 
consider these plants to be parasites. However, fully achlo- 
rophylous mycoheterotrophs would seem to fit the defini- 

320 Chapter 13 
Table 13.1. 
Terminology associated with heterotrophs (modified from Nickrent 
1998 and Selosse and Roy 2009) 
Autotroph: an organism that is able to use atmospheric CO, as its sole carbon 
source, for example by way of photosynthesis. 
Heterotroph: a plant that obtains carbon via a mechanism other than photo- 
synthesis. Two major categories: mycoheterotrophs and haustorial parasites. 
Haustorial parasite: plant that obtains minerals and carbon directly from the 
host plant using haustorium. 
Hemiparasite: a plant that, although capable of performing photosynthesis, 
lives parasitically on other plants, from which it obtains mineral nutrients and 
water. 
Holoparasite: a nonphotosynthetic plant that obtains all its water and nutrients 
from the host using a haustorium. 
Mycoheterotroph (mycophyte, mycotroph, myco-heterotroph, saprophytic 
plant): a non-photosynthetic, non-chlorophyllous plant that obtains not only 
minerals but also carbon from its mycorrhizal fungus that is growing on the host 
plant. 
Mixotroph (hemi-autotroph, partial mycoheterotroph): an autotrophic organ- 
ism that combines its photosynthesis and a partial heterotrophy as carbon 
sources. 
tion of parasite as well as holoparasites do (i.e., nutrients 
exclusively obtained from other organisms, no evidence of 
mutualism). Full mycoheterotrophs are completely depen- 
dent on fungi for carbon metabolites (Merckx and Freud- 
enstein 2010; Selosse and Cameron 2010), but some appar- 
ently photosynthetic plants also obtain some carbohydrates 
from their fungal symbiont. This may depend upon the life 
stage of the plant (e.g., orchids where fungal association 
is critical early in the life cycle, but less so as the plant de- 
velops). Some Ericaceae (e.g., Pyrola and Chimaphila) are 
strongly mycorrhizal, but are green and photosynthetic, 
whereas others (e.g., Monotropa) lack chlorophyll and 
obtain all carbohydrates from a mycorrhizal fungus. The 
degree of nutritional dependence on the host varies among 
haustorial parasites (Nickrent et al. 1998). Hemiparasites 
photosynthesize during part of their life cycle and obtain 
mainly water and dissolved minerals from their hosts; ho- 
loparasites are non-photosynthetic. Both holoparasites and 
hemiparasites are briefly discussed in the chapters on rosids 
and asterids (Chapters 10 and 11). 
Following these definitions, there are facultative hemi- 
parasites—those that can survive without connection to 
a host during part of their life cycle (e.g., Castilleja, Oro- 
banchaceae)—and obligate hemiparasites—those that can- 
not survive unless connected to their host (e.g., Viscum, 
Santalaceae of APG III [2009]; APG IV [2016]; Viscaceae 
of Nickrent et al. 2010). This use of hemiparasite is not 
completely satisfactory because it combines two different 
phenomena, but it is an improvement in that previous defi- 
nitions were difficult to apply. 
Following APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016), ~4,000 
species in 265 genera and perhaps 17 families are consid- 
ered to be haustorial parasites (see Parasitic Plant Connec- 
tion, /www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/). Our estimate of the 
number of parasitic families (Table 13.2) differs from other 
recent estimates because of changes in classification in the 
angiosperms (APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; see Chapter 12), 
as well as recent changes to the classification of Santala- 
les (Nickrent et al. 2010; below and Chapter 12). Some 
of these diverse parasites are illustrated in Fig. 13.1. Most 
are holoparasites; members of Santalales, Krameriaceae, 
and one genus of Lauraceae are hemiparasites, although 
single genera in Santalaceae and Loranthaceae appear to 
be holoparasites (below, Santalales parasites; Chapter 11). 
Orobanchaceae (sensu APG IV 2016; Chapter 12) include 
both hemi- and holoparasites. 
Ascertaining the relationships of many parasitic plants 
has been problematic because morphological features asso- 
ciated with the parasitic habit are often extensively modi- 
fied (e.g., Nickrent et al. 1998). Modifications include loss 
of diverse organs, including leaves, perianth parts, and in- 
teguments, as well as the loss of chlorophyll. Some mor- 
phological modifications are subject to parallelism and 
convergence; similar features have evolved in distantly 
related groups. Perhaps surprising, the parasitic habit was_ 
used by some (e.g., Cronquist 1981) to link Balanophora- 
ceae, Hydnoraceae, and Rafflesiaceae with Santalales (only 
the former family is now known to be part of Santalales; 
Chapters 11, 12). 
Initially, molecular systematics did not resolve the re- 
lationships of most holoparasites because the first wave 
of molecular analyses relied primarily on plastid genes 
(Chapter 3). One consequence of the evolution of holo- 
parasitism is relaxation of the evolutionary constraints 
associated with photosynthetic function—these plants are 
non-photosynthetic and often have highly modified plastid 
genomes that lack many genes or have accelerated rates 
of molecular evolution, including, within genes, nucleo- 
tide deletions that are not in triplets (e.g., dePamphilis and 
Palmer 1990; Nickrent et al. 1998; Bungard 2004; Nick- 
rent and Garcia 2009). Parasitic plants also exhibit exten- 
sive horizontal transfer of mtDNA (Won and Renner 2003; 
Bergthorsson et al. 2003, 2004; Sanchez-Puerta et al. 2008; 
Mower et al. 2010; Renner and Bellot 2012; Xi et al. 2013; 
Chapter 15). 
As a result of modifications to the plastid genome, plas- 
tid genes that have been widely used to infer angiosperm 
phylogeny have been of limited value in placing holopara- 
sites. There are exceptions; sequences of several plastid

genes were used to resolve the relationships of Orobancha- 
ceae, parasitic Lamiales (Olmstead et al. 2001), and the 
variably mycoparasitic monocot family Burmanniaceae 
(Caddick et al. 2002a). Holomycoparastic genera and spe- 
cies in otherwise photosynthetic families/genera have also 
typically been easily placed, presumably because their plas- 
tid genomes are largely intact due to the recent transition 
(e.g., Geosiris, Iridaceae and many orchid genera or spe- 
cies). Although parasitic taxa generally can be placed with 
nuclear (initially 18S and 26S rDNA were used) and mito- 
chondrial DNA sequences, the placement of many para- 
sitic plants has remained obscure until recently, despite the 
enormous success of molecular phylogenetics in clarifying 
relationships of other taxonomically troublesome plants. 
We have plotted the occurrence of parasitism in the 
eudicots on the current estimate of angiosperm phylog- 
eny. Parasitism has arisen independently many times in 
the angiosperms (Fig. 13.2a,b, with the following clades, 
or members thereof, each representing a putative separate 
origin: 
Convolvulaceae, 
Boraginaceae, 
Orobanchaceae, 
Cynomoriaceae, Cytinaceae, Balanophoraceae, Apodan- 
thaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, 
Rafflesiaceae, Hydnoraceae 
(now considered part of Aristolochiaceae; APG IV 2016; 
Chapter 12), Lauraceae, Krameriaceae, and Santalales, a 
clade with parasitic members in several families (Nickrent 
et al. 1998, 2010; Smith et al. 2001; Barkman et al. 2004; 
see the Parasitic Plant Connection). 
MYCOHETEROTROPHY IN 
ANGIOSPERMS 
The terminology associated with mycoheterotrophs 
is 
problematic, as noted above (Table 13.1). Mycohetero- 
trophs should not be confused with mixotrophs (synonyms 
are hemi-autotrophs or partial mycoheterotrophs); mixo-_ 
trophs are defined as autotrophic organisms that combine 
photosynthesis and partial heterotrophy as carbon sources 
(Table 13.1; Selosse and Roy 2009). Selosse and Roy (2009) 
further noted that a continuum from autotrophic to fully 
heterotrophic organisms exists. Among angiosperms, true 
mixotrophy is known only from some Ericaceae (pyrolids) 
and some Orchidaceae (Tedersoo et al. 2007; Selosse and 
Roy 2009). Mixotrophy is usually given as a clear example 
of a homoplastic trait (Tedersoo et al. 2007; Selosse and 
Roy 2009). Reversals from mixotrophy to autotrophy also 
occur (Selosse and Roy 2009). 
A summary of mycoheterotrophs is given in Table 13.3. 
Morphological reduction and extensive secondary loss/re- 
arrangements of multiple plastid loci have often hindered 
resolution of phylogenetic relationships of mycoheterotro- 
phic plants (e.g., Merckx et al. 2009; Merckx and Freuden- 
stein 2010; Benny et al. 2011; Braukmann and Stefanovi¢é 
2012), but several recent publications have used com- 
plete plastomes with success (e.g., Logacheva et al. 2014; 
Mennes et al. 2015). Due to the strong rate heterogene- 
ity of nuclear and mitochondrial genes of mycoheterotro- 
phic plants (Merckx et al. 2009; Merckx and Freudenstein 
2010; Benny et al. 2011; Lemarie et al. 2011a; Bromhan 
et al. 2013), this problem cannot be resolved via inclu- 
sion of additional types of markers (Merckx et al. 2009;

Merckx and Freudenstein 2010). Hence, the phylogenetic 
relationships of some mycoheterotrophic plants remain 
poorly known. Many mycoheterotrophic genera have not 
yet been included in phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Chei- 
lotheca |Ericaceae], Corsiopsis [Corsiaceae], Epirixanthes 
[Polygalaceae], Miersiella and Marthella [Burmanniaceael], 
Kihansia, Peltophyllum, Seychellaria, Soridium, and Triuri- 
dopsis [Triuridaceae], and several genera of Orchidaceae) 
(Merckx and Freudenstein 2010). 
Following Merckx and Freudenstein (2010), outside of 
monocots there are at least seven independent origins of 
mycoheterotrophy: one in Polygalaceae, two or three in 
Ericaceae (Braukmann and Stefanovié 2012), and four in 
Gentianaceae, for a total of 46 species. The remaining an- 
giosperm mycoheterotrophs are all monocots (Merckx and 
Freudenstein 2010), in which mycoheterotrophy is present 
in all major clades except Acorales, Alismatales, and com- 
melinids (Fig. 13.2b). The habit is found in Petrosaviales, 
Pandanales, Dioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagales. Thus, 
mycoheterotrophy appeared early (there are fossil Triuri- 
daceae at 90 mya) and often in monocot evolution. Within 
monocots, at least 411 species in 43 lineages evolved full 
mycoheterotrophy (Merckx and Freudenstein 2010). Or- 
chidaceae contain the largest number of fully mycohet- 
erotrophic species (~210), which represent over 30 inde- 
Parallel and Convergent Evolution 
323 
pendent occurrences (Merckx and Freudenstein 2010). 
Mycoheterotrophy may evolve from either autotrophic or 
mixotrophic ancestors, based on recent analyses (Selosse 
and Roy 2009) (Fig. 13.2). 
PARASITES IN THE MAGNOLIIDS 
Unlike many parasites, Hydnoraceae were easily placed 
with DNA data in early analyses (Nickrent et al. 2002; 
Fig. 13.2). Molecular analyses supported monophyly of 
Hydnoraceae and association of the family with Aris- 
tolochiaceae (Nickrent et al. 2002) as part of Piperales 
(Chapter 5). Phylogenetic analysis permitted the general 
placement of Hydnoraceae, but the precise relationship 
of Hydnoraceae within Piperales, until recently, remained 
unclear. Recent analyses (Naumann et al. 2013; Massoni 
et al. 2014) have continued to place haustorial Hydnora- 
ceae within Piperales and nested within Aristolochiaceae, 
prompting a recircumscription of Aristolochiaceae to in- 
clude Hydnoraceae (APG IV 2016; Chapter 12). 
In contrast to morphology-based classifications, molec- 
ular analyses clearly do not suggest a close relationship be- 
tween parasitic Aristolochiaceae (i.e., the former Hydnora- 
ceae) and Rafflesiaceae (e.g., Cronquist 1981). Molecular 
analyses indicate, instead, that Rafflesiaceae in the tradi- 
tional sense represent a polyphyletic assemblage with con- 
stituent members associated with various asterid and rosid 
families (see below). Thus, several floral morphological 
features shared by Rafflesiaceae and taxa formerly placed 
in Hydnoraceae must represent independent acquisitions. 
These features include flowers or inflorescences arising 
from the host, fleshy flowers, a perianth of a single series 
(three to five tepals), and a highly modified androecium. 
Cassytha (Lauraceae) represents another independent 
origin of the parasitic habit among magnoliids (Fig. 13.2a). 
The genus of ~20 species of hemiparasites is distinctive be- 
cause of its twining, herbaceous habit, whereas other Lau- 
raceae are trees or shrubs. Although sometimes formerly 
placed in its own family, Cassythaceae, most treatments 
included Cassytha in Lauraceae 
(e.g., Cronquist 1981; 
Takhtajan 1987, 1997; see APG IV 2016; Chapter 12). 
Phylogenetic analyses (Rohwer and Rudolph 2005) indi- 
cated that Cassytha is nested among Lauraceae. Cassytha is 
typical of Lauraceae in features other than habit, including 
floral and fruit morphology, pollen structure, and alkaloid 
chemistry (Rohwer 1993). Thus, it has long been apparent 
that Cassytha is allied with Lauraceae. This genus there- 
fore differs from many other parasitic lineages that are so 
highly modified morphologically that their relationships 
have been difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain from 
morphology alone. 

324 Chapter 13 
ROSID PARASITES 
Several lineages of parasitic plants that have been par- 
ticularly difficult to place using morphology appear to be 
nested within rosids (Chapter 10; Fig. 13.2). As reviewed 
below, these rosid parasites include some of the best known 
of the parasitic plants, such as Rafflesia and other genera 
once placed in a broadly defined Rafflesiaceae (illustrated 
in Chapter 10). 
The rosid parasite that has proved to be one of the easi- 
est to place in molecular analyses is Krameria (Krameria- 
ceae). Krameria comprises ~15 species of hemiparasitic 
shrubs and perennial herbs. Because of superficial floral 
similarities, some authors allied the genus with Polygala- 
ceae and others with the caesalpinioid legumes (Cronquist 
1981; Takhtajan 1997). In contrast to most parasites, plas- 
tid sequences were easily obtained for Krameria, and early 
molecular investigations indicated, with strong support, 
that Krameria (shown in Chapter 10) is sister to Zygophyl- 
laceae (together comprising Zygophyllales). The relation- 
ship of Krameriaceae + Zygophyllaceae to other rosids was 
more difficult to disentangle and has only recently become 
clear with larger datasets (see Chapter 10)—Zygophyllales 
are sister to other fabids. 
The affinities of Rafflesia have long been of special in- 
terest because Rafflesia arnoldii from Sumatra is renowned 
for having the largest flower in the world (Fig. 13.2a). As 
traditionally recognized, Rafflesiaceae were a large, mor- 
phologically diverse assemblage; historically there was 
considerable debate regarding the actual limits of the fam- 
ily. Cytinus has also been placed in Rafflesiaceae (e.g., 
Cronquist 1981). Cronquist (1981) also placed Mitraste- 
monaceae with Rafflesiaceae in his Rafflesiales, close to 
Santalales. 
All these rosid parasites lack chlorophyll and are endo- 
parasitic on the roots, or less often on the shoots, of other 
plants. Only the flowers or the short flowering shoot of the 
parasite emerge from the host plant (Fig. 13.1). The vegeta- 
tive body of the plant is largely filamentous and resembles 
a fungal mycelium. For these reasons, these taxa have been 
extremely difficult to place. These parasites have modi- 
fied plastid genomes, and it has been either impossible or 
problematic to place them with plastid genes. Molina et al. 
(2014) discussed the possible loss of the plastid genome in 
Rafflesia lagascae. However, recent studies using mtDNA 
and nuclear genes have now placed these taxa within the 
angiosperm framework tree; we review these results here. 
The broadly circumscribed Rafflesiaceae formerly rec- 
ognized based on morphology are clearly polyphyletic. 
Rafflesiaceae are now narrowly defined and limited to 
Sapria, Rhizanthes, and Rafflesia (Davis et al. 2007). Bark- 
man et al. (2004), using mtDNA sequence data, placed Rhi- 
zanthes and Rafflesia within the rosid order Malpighiales, 
a finding reinforced by others (Davis and Wurdack 2004; 
Davis et al. 2007; Bendiksby et al. 2010) (Fig. 13.2a). 
Within this narrowly defined Rafflesiaceae, Sapria is sister 
to Rhizanthes + Rafflesia (Davis et al. 2007). This place- 
ment of Rafflesiaceae within Malpighiales was not sug- 
gested in previous classifications, although floral similari- 
ties between Rafflesia and Passifloraceae of Malpighiales 
had been noted (Barkman et al. 2004). Rafflesia flowers 
share morphological features with Passifloraceae, including 
a central column (termed an androgynophore in Passiflora- 
ceae) and a corona, characteristics that are unusual. 
There is considerable interest in the evolutionary ori- 
gin of the large flowers of Rafflesia (Fig. 13.1). There was 
an enormous (79-fold) and rapid increase in flower size 
in stem Rafflesiaceae that may reflect a switch to fly pol- 
lination (Davis et al. 2007, 2008). Barkman et al. (2008) 
suggested that there were considerable changes in flower 
size just within crown group Rafflesia, with both repeated 
increases and decreases. 
Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence 
data has also placed Cytinus (Cytinaceae), another parasite 
once considered closely related to or part of Rafflesiaceae 
(Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997). Cytinus usually is a 
parasite on Cistus and Halimium (Cistaceae) (Thorogood 
and Hiscock 2007). However, rather than a placement 
close to Rafflesiaceae or Malpighiales (see above), molecu- 
lar results suggest, instead, that Cytinus is embedded within 
Malvales and sister to Muntingiaceae (Nickrent et al. 2004; 
Nickrent 2007). 
The relationships of Apodanthaceae have been more dif- 
ficult to ascertain than the parasites noted above. Apodan- 
thaceae were considered part of either Rafflesiaceae (e.g., 
Cronquist 1981) or Rafflesiales 
(e.g., Takhtajan 1997). 
However, morphological studies indicated that Apodan- 
thaceae (Pilostyles and Apodanthes) share with Malvales 
several noteworthy floral structures, including an androe- 
cial tube and a trend from normal stamens to synandria 
without thecal organization (Blarer et al. 2004). Using se- 
quence data, Nickrent et al. (2004) suggested a relationship 
of Apodanthaceae with Malvales. A later DNA analysis 
(Barkman et al. 2007), in contrast, provided weak support 
for a position in Cucurbitales; more recent DNA studies 
provide additional and stronger support for this latter 
placement (see Chapter 10) (Filipowicz and Renner 2010). 
Some morphological features support this placement as 
well, including dioecy, extrose anthers, inferior ovary, and 
parietal placentation, all features common in Cucurbitales 
(Filipowicz and Renner 2010). 
The syntheses of Barkman et al. (2004, 2007), Davis 
et al. (2007), and Nickrent et al. (2004), as well as other 
recent DNA-based analyses, represent major contributions 

to our understanding of the relationships of parasitic ros- 
ids. The placement of some of these families with various 
rosid lineages was totally unexpected; morphology-based 
taxonomic treatments did not suggest the placement of 
parasites with orders of rosids. One caveat, however, is that 
branch lengths to these parasitic taxa are often long and 
are typically based on a few mitochondrial genes. Addi- 
tional nuclear-based analyses remain important for testing 
these hypotheses.

THE ENIGMATIC CYNOMORIACEAE 
Cynomoriaceae comprise one genus (Cynomorium) with 
two species, both non-photosynthetic. The family was 
often included in, or considered closely related to, Bala- 
nophoraceae (e.g., Cronquist 1968; Takhtajan 1997), with 
the latter often associated with Santalales. Despite several 
DNA-based studies, the phylogenetic relationships of Cy- 
nomoriaceae remain uncertain. Initial analysis of 18S and

26S rDNA and mitochondrial matR sequence data placed 
Cynomorium coccineum in Saxifragales (Nickrent et al. 
2005). However, bootstrap support for this relationship 
was less than 50%, and some broad analyses placed Cyno- 
moriaceae in Santalales (Jian et al. 2008), in agreement with 
traditional classifications (e.g., Cronquist 1981). However, 
other analyses using what remains of the inverted repeat of 
the plastid genome have suggested that the genus belongs 
in Rosales (Zhang et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2010); recent 
analyses of phytochrome genes indicate a placement some- 
where with the rosids (Gitzendanner et al. unpubl.). Given 
the uncertain placement of Cynomorium, it was unplaced 
in earlier APG classifications, but recent evidence (Bellot 
et al. 2016) strengthens support for a placement in Saxi- 
fragales (Fig. 13.2; see APG IV 2016; see also Chapter 12). 
SANTALALEAN PARASITES 
Santalales 
(Chapter 
11; parasitic plants illustrated 
in 
Fig. 13.1) provide an excellent model for studying the 
evolution of parasitism. The order contains non-parasites, 
hemiparasites, and holoparasites (Hiirlimann and Stauffer 
1957; Kraus et al. 1995; Nickrent and Malécot 2001). 
Much of Santalales was included in a paraphyletic Olaca- 
ceae (a basal grade) and a large Santalaceae. Nickrent et al. 
(2010) provide a revised classification of Santalales, di- 
viding both Olacaceae and Santalaceae into a number of 
Dioscoreales (Burmanniaceae, Thismiaceae) 
Petrosaviales (Peterosaviaceae) 
Figure 13.2. 
(continued) 
separate families, and we present that treatment here for 
comparison with APG III (2009) and APG IV (2016) (see 
Chapter 12). Balanophoraceae are also considered part of 
Santalales (see below). 
Following the current summary tree for Santalales, the 
basal lineages are nonparasitic: Erythropalaceae, Strom- 
bosiaceae, and Coulaceae. Parasitism then arose once in 
the ancestor of the remaining Santalales (Fig. 13.3). Many 
of the parasitic taxa in Santalales are terrestrial (i.e., root 
parasites). Root parasitism appears to be the ancestral 
parasitic state in Santalales—it is found in Ximeniaceae 
and a narrowly defined Olacaceae, which are sisters to 
most remaining Santalales. Two other poorly understood 
early-diverging families are assumed to be root parasites 
(Octoknemaceae and Aptandraceae), but this remains un- 
known (Nickrent et al. 2010). Root parasites are also found 
in many other Santalales: Schoepfiaceae, Opiliaceae, Thesi- 
aceae, Cervantesiaceae, and Nanodeaceae, as well as some 
Loranthaceae, Santalaceae, and Amphorogynaceae. Aerial 
parasitism (confined to trees) appears to have arisen five 
times in Santalales (e.g., Loranthaceae, Santalaceae, Miso- 
dendraceae, Amphorogynaceae, and Viscaceae; Fig. 13.3) 
(Nickrent et al. 2010). Based on dating analyses, the oldest 
example of this appears to be in Misodendraceae, ~80 mya 
(Vidal-Russell and Nickrent 2008). 
Another parasitic member of Santalales is Balanophora- 
ceae, previously placed in Rafflesiaceae in some classifica- 
tions (e.g., Cronquist 1981). Several analyses have placed

Balanophoraceae in Santalales (e.g., H. Su et al. 2012; Su 
and Hu 2012), but the exact position of the family within 
the order has remained unclear. As a result, Nickrent et al. 
(2010) did not consider the family in their classification of 
Santalales. A recent analysis, however, suggests a relation- 
ship of the family to a narrowly defined Santalaceae (Nick- 
rent et al. pers. comm.; Chapter 11). 
AS TERID PARASITES 
Several genera and families of parasites are clearly aster- 
ids (Fig. 13.2a)—Cuscuta (previously of Cuscutaceae, now 
placed in Convolvulaceae; Solanales), Orobanchaceae (La- 
miales), and Lennoa (two species now included in Boragi- 
naceae of APG III [2009] and APG IV [2016], Lennoaceae 
of Luebert et al. [2016], or Ehretiaceae of the Angiosperm 
Phylogeny Website, Stevens [2001 onwards]; see Chap- 
ter 12). These parasites have long been associated with as- 
terids (Chapter 11) based on non-DNA evidence (i.e., ob- 
vious morphological synapomorphies derived from floral 
characters), but molecular results have provided additional 
important insights, below. 
Cuscuta, comprising more than 100 species of hemi- 
parasites and holoparasites, has long been considered re- 
lated to, or derived from within, Convolvulaceae (Nick- 
rent et al. 1998). Holoparasitic members lack thylakoids, 
chlorophyll, and RUBISCO, but retain the gene rbcL. Mo- 
lecular results placed Cuscuta with Convolvulaceae (e.g., 
Soltis et al. 1997b, 2011; Nickrent et al. 1998; Stefanovié 
et al. 2002, 2004), and the genus has now been included 
within Convolvulaceae (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG 
IV 2016; Chapter 12) as a separate subfamily, Cuscutoi- 
deae. Despite intensive research, the position of Cuscutoi- 
deae within the family has remained problematic (Stefa- 
novié et al. 2002; Stefanovié and Olmstead 2004); Wright 
et al. (2011) indicated that, based on gynoecial characters, 
Cuscuta is closely related to the “bifid” clade (Dicranosty- 
loideae). In Cuscuta, most changes in the plastid genome 
previously attributed to its parasitic mode of life can be 
explained as either a plesiomorphic condition within Con- 
volvulaceae or as autapomorphies of particular species of 
Cuscuta (Stefanovié et al. 2002). 
Lennoa and Pholisma (former Lennoaceae) represent 
another 
lineage of parasites long considered 
asterids. 
Based on morphology, these genera have been associated 
either with Boraginaceae or Hydrophyllaceae (Cronquist 
1981; Takhtajan 1987, 1997; Thorne 1992a,b; the lat- 
ter included in the former in APG III 2009 and APG IV 
2016). Cronquist (1981) placed Lennoaceae in Lamiales 
with Boraginaceae, Verbenaceae, and Lamiaceae because 
of similarities in the structure of the gynoecium. Phyloge- 
netic analysis of mtDNA sequence data place Lennoa with 
Boraginaceae (Barkman et al. 2007): the genus is now in- 
cluded in that family by APG (APG II 2003; APG III 2009; 
APG IV 2016), but recent treatments have recognized eight 
or 11 segregate families from Boraginaceae. Luebert et al. 
(2016) again recognized Lennoaceae (see Chapters 115.12). 
Stevens (2001 onwards, http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/ 
research/APweb/welcome.html) places Lennoa in Ehretia- 
ceae (Boraginales), another segregate of a broadly defined 
Boraginaceae. 
Many genera of parasitic plants have been associated 
with the former, broadly recognized Scrophulariaceae and 
Orobanchaceae. In fact, these parasites exhibit the great- 
est range in degree of specialization and were considered 
to represent an evolutionary series beginning with fully 
photosynthetic taxa and culminating with holoparasitism. 
Lathraea, Harveya, and Hyobanche were viewed as links 
or transitional taxa between parasites placed in Scrophula- 
riaceae and the holoparasitic Orobanchaceae (Young et al. 
Ooo): 
Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the former broadly 
defined Scrophulariaceae have revealed 
a single well- 
supported clade that contains all of the parasites (Young 
et al. 1999; Olmstead et al. 2001; Refulio-Rodriguez and 
Olmstead 2014). This clade, containing taxa tradition- 
ally placed in either Scrophulariaceae or Orobanchaceae, 
is now 
considered 
a broadly defined 
Orobanchaceae. 
(APG III 2009; APG IV 2016; see also Olmstead et al. 
2001 and the current narrowly defined Scrophulariaceae; 
Chapters 145-12); 
All members of this broadly defined Orobanchaceae 
are parasitic except the genus Lindenbergia, which is non- 
parasitic and sister to the remainder of the family (Young 
et al. 1999; Olmstead et al. 2001). This is true unless Reh- 
mannia is also included in Orobanchaceae—as some sug- 
gest (see Chapter 12). Molecular results indicate that hemi- 
parasitism has evolved only once (McNeal et al. 2013); 
holoparasites have evolved independently from hemipara- 
sites multiple times, with recent estimates indicating three 
times (dePamphilis et al. 1997; Nickrent et al. 1998; Young 
et al. 1999; Schneeweiss et al. 2004; Bennett and Mathews 
2006; McNeal et al. 2013). However, multiple workers 
have stressed that the distinction between holoparasite and 
hemiparasite is not clear in this clade (see McNeal et al. 
2013). There has long been interest in taxa considered tran- 
sitional between hemi- and holoparasitic, and there may be 
different pathways by which holoparasitism evolves. Tran- 
scriptome evidence suggested that this may involve the re- 
tention and regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis (Wickett 
et al. 2011) and that transitions to holoparasitism have oc- 
curred in at least three separate lineages of Orobanchaceae. 
Interestingly, host specificity has evolved in Orobanche, 

with races that are specific to particular hosts (Fhorogood 
and Hiscock 2010). 
The plastid genome of the holoparasite Epifagus virgin- 
iana (Orobanchaceae) has been investigated in detail; the 
species has become a model for the evolution of a reduced 
plastome in a non-photosynthetic angiosperm. Although 
the plant lacks chlorophyll, the cells retain plastids with 
DNA (dePamphilis and Palmer 1990). The plastid genome 
of Epifagus virginiana is much smaller than that of other 
angiosperms (71 kb vs. 156 kb for the asterid Nicotiana [to- 
bacco; Solanaceae], which is typical of most angiosperms) 
and contains only 42 intact genes (dePamphilis and Palmer 
1990; Wolfe et al. 1992). However, the greatly reduced 
plastid genome of Epifagus is nearly collinear with that 
of Nicotiana (dePamphilis and Palmer 1990). The plastid 
genome of another Orobanchaceae, Cistanche deserticola, 
is also greatly reduced in size (102,657 bp compared to a 
typical plastid genome of ~150 kb) and gene content; all 
genes required for photosynthesis except one have either 
been lost or become pseudogenized (X. Li et al. 2013). The 
plastid genome of C. deserticola differs from those of other 
holoparasitic plants in that it retains nearly a complete set 
of tRNA genes (X. Li et al. 2013). Several studies have pro- 
vided evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) involv- 
ing plastid genes and the host plant of members of Oro- 
banchaceae, including Orobanche and Phelipanche (Park 
et al. 2007) and Cistanche (X. Li et al. 2013). Wicke et al. 
(2013) provided complete plastomes for 10 photosynthetic 
and non-photosynthetic parasites and their non-parasitic 
sister from Orobanchaceae and reconstructed a history of 
convergent gene losses and genome reconfigurations. 
Using mitochondrial DNA sequence data, Barkman 
et al. (2004) demonstrated that Mitrastema (Mitrastemo- 
naceae), an enigmatic holoparasite sometimes placed in 
Rafflesiaceae (see “Rosid Parasites,” above), is placed in the 
asterid order Ericales. A close relationship of Mitrastema 
to asterids had not been suggested previously. However, 
the genus exhibits a sympetalous corolla, which supports 
a placement with asterids (Chapter 11). In addition, a re- 
lationship of Mitrastema with Ericales is also supported 
by shared morphological features, including opposite and 
decussate leaves, parietal placentation, and circumscissile 
fruit dehiscence (Barkman et al. 2004). The exact place- 
ment of the family is unclear, but it is likely related to 
Theaceae, Symplocaceae, Styracaceae, and Diapensiaceae. 
CARNIVORY 
Carnivory in angiosperms is a highly integrated system 
that involves morphological modifications to attract, trap, 
kill, and ultimately digest (and absorb nutrients from) ani- 
Parallel and Convergent Evolution 
329 
mal prey (Juniper et al. 1989; Barthlott et al. 2007). All 
carnivorous plants rely on photosynthesis; the main nutri- 
ents recovered from prey are not fixed carbon, but other 
elements (primarily nitrogen). Several highly divergent trap 
types have evolved, all relying on modified leaves. The most 
familiar traps are the pitcher, flypaper, and snap or steel 
trap (Fig. 13.4; Table 13.4). The pitcher trap is found in 
the well-known families Sarraceniaceae (Fig. 13.4) and 
Nepenthaceae, the New and Old World pitcher plants, re- 
spectively, as well as the less-well-known Australian pitcher 
plant family, Cephalotaceae (Figure 13.4). 
Flypaper traps are present in several families, including 
Droseraceae (Drosera; Fig. 13.4), Drosophyllaceae (Droso- 
phyllum), Dioncophyllaceae (Triphyophyllum; Fig. 13.4),

Lentibulariaceae (Pinguicula), Byblidaceae (Byblis), and 
Martyniaceae (Proboscidea; Fig. 13.4). Snap traps are found 
in Dionaea and the little-known Aldrovanda (Droseraceae; 
Fig. 13.4). Philcoxia (Plantaginaceae) from Brazil is also 
carnivorous (Fritsch et al. 2007; Pereira et al. 2012). 
Less well known are the intricate bladder traps found in 
Utricularia (Lentibulariaceae) and the “lobster pot” traps 
of Genlisea (Fig. 13.4; also of Lentibulariaceae). The trap 
of Utricularia is highly sophisticated and involves negative 
pressure or suction within the “bladder,” which is a thin- 
walled sac with an intricately constructed doorway that 
opens inwardly. The lobster pot traps of Genlisea consist 
of a swollen utricle or bulb (thought to serve as a diges- 
tive cavity). A tubular channel (5-20 mm long) leads to 
this bulb area, below which is a tubular channel with two 
helical arms (10-50 mm long). A slit, which extends into 
both arms, forms a long and narrow mouth through which 
protozoa enter the trap by chemotaxis. The trapping mech- 
anism and habitat for Philcoxia (Plantaginaceae) are like 
those of Genlisea, and phosphatases digest nematodes (for 
overviews, see Juniper et al. 1989 and Barthlott et al. 1998). 
Another type of carnivory (termed “protocarnivory”) 
has also been observed in some groups (e.g., Stylidiaceae, 
Darnowski et al. 2006; and Roridulaceae). These plants 
trap prey but depend on assistance for digestion; they blur 
the distinction between carnivory and complete reliance on 
photosynthesis. Roridula (Roridulaceae, Ericales) is consid- 
ered by many to be carnivorous, but it depends on a capsid 
bug, Pomeridea, to eat the insects it catches on its flypaper 
traps; the bug lives its entire life on the plant and defecates 
around its base, providing the plant with additional nitro- 
gen. Many plants (e.g., various Solanaceae) have glandu- 
lar hairs over their stems and leaves and could similarly 
be trapping insects that then decay once they fall to the 
ground around these plants, thereby providing additional 
nitrogen (Chase et al. 2009). Many plants may benefit from 
these “protocarnivorous” processes; they certainly warrant 
more study to determine whether animal proteins or their 
components are incorporated in plant tissues. 
A mechanism approaching carnivory has also evolved in 
some monocots. Tank-forming Bromeliaceae (e.g., Brocchi- 
nia and Catopsis; Fig. 13.4) have absorptive trichomes that 
acquire nutrients from trapped animals or degrading plant 
debris (Givnish et al. 1984; Benzing et al. 1985). However, 
there is debate as to whether tank bromeliads are true car- 
nivores; the plants lack special leaf zones for attracting prey 
and do not actively digest prey. Krol et al. (2012) used the 
term “passive traps” for Brocchinia, in much the same way 
that pitcher traps are considered passive. Krol et al. (2012) 
considered three bromeliads to be true carnivores, stating 
(p. 3) “Although among Bromeliaceae 
. 
. 
. only Brocchinia 
reducta has been shown to secrete phosphatase 
. 
. 
. and 
Parallel and Convergent Evolution 
331 
neither B. hechtioides nor Catopsis berteroniana produces 
proteases, these three species are established plant carni- 
vores. Depending on a food-web to acquire nutrients, these 
plants provide habitats for frogs, insects (e.g., ants), other 
carnivorous plants (e.g., Utricularia humboldtii) and bacte- 
ria (including nitrogen-fixing bacteria), themselves exploit- 
ing whatever is left over: feces, animal or vegetable debris.” 
In contrast, Renner and Specht (2013; p. 438) considered 
Brocchinia to be evolving towards carnivory, but not truly 
carnivorous, indicating that “although the tank trichomes 
of Brocchinia (Bromeliaceae) have been demonstrated to 
absorb water and nutrients, they do not produce enzymes. 
Such taxa may be examples of plants that are currently us- 
ing certain morphologies derived for defense in a way that 
is evolving toward plant carnivory.” Perhaps carnivory in 
such taxa would be better termed “passive” rather than 
“protocarnivorous,” which implies a directionality to the 
phenomenon; passive carnivory could be a final evolution- 
ary stage, a completely successful ecological strategy that 
is not on its way to another. Some pitcher plants (e.g., He- 
liamphora; Sarraceniaceae), also do not produce digestive 
enzymes and only absorb nutrients first broken down by 
bacteria in their watery traps. If production of digestive en- 
zymes is essential to a species being defined as a carnivore, 
then species of Heliamphora and Roridula are not truly 
carnivorous. Like Chase et al. (2009), we view carnivory as 
a continuum in which every intermediate condition exists 
and strict, potentially misleading definitions (e.g., “proto- 
carnivorous”) should be avoided because they imply some- 
thing that we do not know. 
Carnivory in angiosperms has long been considered as 
having several independent origins (e.g., Darwin 1875). 
Modern taxonomic treatments also indicate multiple ori- 
gins of carnivory, but both the actual extent to which mul- 
tiple origins had occurred, as well as the relationships of 
carnivorous plants to other angiosperms, were much de- 
bated (e.g., Takhtajan 1980, 1987, 1997; Cronquist 1981; 
Thorne 1992a,b). Cronquist (1981) placed three morpho- 
logically divergent, carnivorous families—Nepenthaceae, 
Sarraceniaceae, and Droseraceae—in his Nepenthales. He 
based this treatment not only on the shared carnivorous 
habit, but also on the fact that some data suggested that 
the insect-catching leaves of all three families were homol- 
ogous (Markgraf 1955). He also noted that Droseraceae 
and Nepenthaceae have similar pollen. Takhtajan (1997) 
also considered these three families of carnivorous plants 
to be closely related. Molecular phylogenetic results have 
confirmed a close relationship between Droseraceae and 
Nepenthaceae (both in Caryophyllales; Chapter 11), but 
Sarraceniaceae (Ericales, asterids; Chapter 9) are distantly 
related to these two families but close to Roridulaceae, 
which may be considered carnivorous. 

332 Chapter 13 
Albert et al. (1992) first addressed the number of ori- 
gins of carnivory using a tree based on rbcL sequences. The 
number was subsequently reanalyzed (Soltis et al. 2005b) 
using a better tree; we have reconsidered the number of 
origins again here using recent results. Multiple analyses 
(below) now suggest at least six origins of carnivory among 
eudicots (see Fig. 13.5): (1) Cephalotus (Cephalotaceae); 
(2) a single origin for the predisposition for carnivory in 
Caryophyllales (see below); (3) one origin in Ericales (Rori- 
dula of Roridulaceae and Sarraceniaceae); and three origins 
in Lamiales: (4) Proboscidea (Martyniaceae); (5) Byblis 
(Byblidaceae), and (6) Lentibulariaceae. As noted, several 
monocots may represent additional origins (Fig. 13.5). 
Multigene topologies for asterids (Chapter 11) are cru- 
cial for determining the likely number of origins of car- 
nivory. Also of importance are multigene analyses of car- 
nivorous plants in Caryophyllales (Chapter 11). Although 
the results provide clear evidence for multiple origins of car- 
nivory, there are also clades that are evolutionary hotspots 
for the carnivorous habit (Fig. 13.5). Caryophyllales (sensu 
APG IV 2016), for example, contain a large proportion 
of the carnivorous taxa (five genera in four families: Dro- 
seraceae, Drosophyllaceae, Nepenthaceae, and Dionco- 
phyllaceae). The asterid order Lamiales represents another 
hotspot of carnivory with six genera in four families: Plan- 
taginaceae, Martyniaceae, Lentibulariaceae, and Byblida- 
ceae (Table 13.4). Two families of Ericales (Roridulaceae 
and Sarraceniaceae) are also potentially carnivorous; these 
appear to represent one origin (below). Only one species of 
the large rosid clade is carnivorous, Cephalotus follicularis 
(Cephalotaceae; Oxalidales). Carnivory is not present in 
any basal eudicot lineages or in basal angiosperm lineages, 
magnoliids, or Chloranthaceae—it is an innovation limited 
to core eudicots and perhaps monocots (which remains 
controversial, as noted). 
Cameron et al. (2002) provided strong evidence for a 
single origin of carnivory within Caryophyllales (Fig. 13.6; 
see also Meimberg et al. 2000; Cuénoud et al. 2002). 
Within this carnivorous clade, two subclades are apparent. 
One subclade contains Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) as sister 
to Drosophyllum (Drosophyllaceae) + (Dioncophyllaceae 
+ Ancistrocladaceae). Dioncophyllaceae contain the car- 
nivorous Triphyophyllum and two non-carnivorous gen- 
era; Ancistrocladus (Ancistrocladaceae) is not carnivorous 
(Fig. 13.6). The second subclade contains the carnivorous 
taxa Dionaea + Aldrovanda as sister to Drosera (Drosera- 
ceae). These results indicate a single origin of carnivory, fol- 
lowed by a loss of carnivory in Ancistrocladus and some 
members of Dioncophyllaceae. There are several different 
trap types within the carnivorous clade of Caryophyllales: 
pitcher (Nepenthes), flypaper (Drosophyllum, Triphyophyl- 
lum, Drosera), and snap trap (Aldrovanda and Dionaea). 
Although Roridula and Sarraceniaceae are both in Eri- 
cales, it was initially thought likely that they represented 
separate origins of carnivory because the two lineages did 
not appear closely related in early molecular analyses (e.g., 
Albert et al. 1992; Chase et al. 1993; D. Soltis et al. 2000). 
Even with large datasets involving many taxa and multiple 
genes, relationships within Ericales have been difficult to 
resolve (see Chapter 11). However, analyses of asterids us- 
ing four (Albach et al. 2001c), five (Anderberg et al. 2002), 
six (Bremer et al. 2002), or more genes (Soltis et al. 2011) 
all placed Sarracenia as sister to a clade of Roridula and 
the non-carnivorous Actinidia (Fig. 13.7). Support for this 
clade was weak in some studies (e.g., Albach et al. 2001c; 
Bremer et al. 2002). Anderberg et al. (2002) found strong 
support (BS = 100%) for Actinidia + Roridula and (BS = 
89%) for Sarracenia + (Actinidia + Roridula). Soltis et al. 
(2011) further supported these relationships, indicating a 
single origin of carnivory in Ericales, followed by a loss in 
Actinidiaceae (Fig. 13.7). The trap types of Roridula and 
Sarraceniaceae differ, representing the flypaper and pitcher 
types, respectively. The presence of multiple trap types in 
one clade also occurs in Droseraceae and Lentibulariaceae. 
Several carnivorous lineages are members of Lamiales: 
Proboscidea (Martyniaceae), Byblis (Byblidaceae), Phil- 
coxia (Plantaginaceae), and genera of Lentibulariaceae. 
However, relationships within Lamiales have been difficult 
to resolve due to their low levels of divergence, which ap- 
parently is due to a recent and rapid radiation (Chapter 11). 
In early molecular analyses, these three families did not ap- 
pear together as close relatives within Lamiales (e.g., Albert 
et al. 1992; Chase et al. 1993; Savolainen et al. 2000a,b; 
D. Soltis et al. 2000), reinforcing a view of separate origins. 
However, relationships among these three lineages were 
poorly supported, even with three- and four-gene analyses 
(D. Soltis et al. 2000; Albach et al. 2001c; Olmstead et al. 
2001; Bremer et al. 2002). Based on more recent studies, 
however, Byblidaceae, Pedaliaceae, and Lentibulariaceae 
are each part of distinct subclades (e.g., Refulio-Rodriguez 
and Olmstead 2014; see Fig. 13.8), strongly suggesting that 
each represents a separate origin of carnivory. Again, dif- 
ferent trap types are present in these carnivorous Lamiales. 
Proboscidea and Byblis have flypaper traps; Philcoxia has 
a lobster pot trap; and Lentibulariaceae have multiple trap 
types: flypaper (Lentibularia), bladder (Utricularia), and 
lobster pot (Genlisea) (Fig. 13.4). 
Phylogeny reconstruction has provided important in- 
sights into the patterns of structural evolution associated 
with carnivory (Albert et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1994; 
Cameron et al. 2002). Byblis (Lamiales) and Drosophyllum 
(Caryophyllales), although distantly related (Fig. 13.5), 
have similar flypaper traps. The two genera share several 
characters, including woody habit (but only some species

of Byblis) and dimorphic stalked and sessile glands. In both 
genera, the stalked glands secrete mucilage that coats prey, 
whereas the sessile glands secrete digestive enzymes. How- 
ever, Byblis differs from Drosophyllum in that its mucilage- 
secreting glands have unicellular stalks that protrude from 
reservoir cells of the epidermis, whereas the mucilage- 
secreting cells of Drosophyllum are multicellular and vas- 
cularized with tracheids and phloem (Fig. 13.9); glands 
of Drosophyllum are similar to those of Triphyophyllum 
(Dioncophyllaceae), to which it is closely related (Figs. 
13.6, 13.9). The mucilage-secreting glands of both Droso- 
phyllum and Triphyophyllum are also similar to those of 
Drosera (Droseraceae), also in Caryophyllales (Figs. 13.6, 
13.9). There are other differences between the mucilage- 
secreting glands of these members of Caryophyllales and 
those of Byblis. The sessile digestive glands of Byblis are 
simple with four to eight head cells, whereas those of 
Drosophyllum, Triphyophyllum, and Drosera have multi-

cellular stalks (Fig. 13.9). Glands of Byblis are more simi- 
lar, structurally, to those of Pinguicula (Lentibulariaceae; 
Fig. 13.9). Therefore, the flypaper trapping mechanism dif- 
fers across the angiosperms, reflecting its phylogenetically 
independent origins, despite remarkable functional simi- 
larities (Albert et al. 1992). 
In the carnivore subclade of Caryophyllales (Figs. 13.4, 
13.6), the flypaper trap may be the ancestral type (Fig. 13.6; 
see also Cameron et al. 2002). It is also noteworthy that 
Ancistrocladus has retained leaf glands similar to those of 
the related carnivorous families Droseraceae and Dionco- 
phyllaceae, despite having lost the carnivorous condition. 
Cameron et al. (2002) provided strong support for a clade 
of Aldrovanda and Dionaea. Aldrovanda (Fig. 13.6), a 
little-known carnivore from several continents, is a root- 
less, submerged aquatic herb. Each leaf resembles a leaf 
of Dionaea (Fig. 13.4), having two lobes, with each lobe 
possessing roughly 20 trigger hairs. Darwin (1875), in fact,

first noted the similarity of the leaves of Aldrovanda and 
Dionaea. Aldrovanda was later shown to have a rapidly 
closing snap trap mechanism, somewhat similar to that of 
Dionaea. Cameron et al.’s (2002) results indicated a single 
origin of this snap trap mechanism. 
Topologies for the carnivorous clade of Caryophyl- 
lales (Cuénoud et al. 2000; Meimberg et al. 2000; Cam- 
eron et al. 2002; Drysdale et al. 2007; Brockington et al. 
2009) placed Nepenthes as sister to a clade of Drosophyl- 
lum + (Dioncophyllaceae + Ancistrocladus). Reconstruc- 
tions (Fig. 13.6) indicate that the pitcher trap of Nepen- 
thes was derived from the flypaper trap type in this clade. 
The pitcher traps of Nepenthes are produced at the tips 
of tendrils; this contrasts with the pitcher traps of other 
families (e.g., Sarraceniaceae, Cephalotaceae) in which the 
pitcher trap is an entire leaf (Fig. 13.4). Tendril formation 
is present throughout the subclade of carnivores to which 
Nepenthes belongs, with the possible exception of Droso- 
phyllum, which has linear leaves. Triphyophyllum, which 
has a flypaper trap mechanism, has tendrils similar to those 
of Nepenthes, as does the non-carnivorous Ancistrocladus 
(Fig. 13.4). Hence, tendril formation may have been an an- 
cestral trait for this subclade of carnivores. 
Within Lentibulariaceae, three trap types have evolved. 
Pinguicula (butterworts; a flypaper trap) is sister to Genli- 
sea (lobster pot) + Utricularia (bladder) (Jobson and Albert 
2002; Jobson et al. 2003). Using the best current estimates 
of relationships and ML reconstruction, it is not clear that 
the flypaper trap is ancestral in Lentibulariaceae (Fig. 13.8); 
both the lobster pot and bladder traps are clearly derived, 
but their immediate ancestral state, as well as that of the 
family, is ambiguous. The fact that Utricularia contains sev- 
eral types of bladders adds to the structural and evolution- 
ary complexity of Lentibulariaceae. 
Jobson and Albert (2002) argued that the clade of 
Utricularia and Genlisea is substantially more species- 
rich and morphologically divergent than Pinguicula. They 
suggest that bladderworts have a flexible vegetative devel- 
opment that could be viewed as a key innovation (sensu 
Sanderson and Donoghue 1994; Givnish 1997; Hodges 
1997a) that permits these plants to invade a broad range 
of nutrient-poor niches, ranging from water-saturated 
terrestrial to epiphytic and suspended aquatic. Jobson 
and Albert (2002) also found that bladderwort genomes 
evolve significantly faster across seven genes than do non- 
bladderwort genomes and proposed that increased clado- 
genesis in this instance is related to increased nucleotide 
substitution (see below and Ibarra-Laclette et al. 2013 for 
molecular evolution of the Utricularia gibba genome). 
Molecular investigations of Lentibulariaceae have also 
provided insights into character evolution, including habit 
(Jobson et al. 2004). The terrestrial habit is the most com- 
mon for all three genera, whereas other species exhibit 
other habits, including affixed aquatic, suspended aquatic, 
and epiphytic. Jobson et al. (2004) found that the epi-_ 
phytic habit evolved independently at least three times in 
the family (Fig. 13.4). 
Some members of Lentibulariaceae have small genomes, 
and recently the complete genome of Utricularia gibba 
(only 82 megabases in size) was reported (Ibarra-Laclette 
et al. 2013). Despite its very small size, the genome of 
U. gibba has a gene number typical for an angiosperm, but 
differs from other plant genomes in having a drastic re- 
duction in non-genic DNA. Although the genome is small, 
at least three rounds of whole-genome duplication (poly- 
ploidy; see Chapter 16) have occurred in U. gibba since its 
common ancestry with tomato (Solanum) and grape ( 
Vitis). 
The architecture of the U. gibba genome indicates that only 
small amounts of intergenic DNA, and few or no active ret- 
rotransposons, are necessary in the genome of these plants 
for normal development and function. 
C, PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
Some chemical pathways seem to be restricted to only one 
or a few lineages and must therefore have originated only 
a few times. Betalain production, for example, is limited 
to the core Caryophyllales clade (Chapter 11). Similarly, 
glucosinolate production has evolved only twice, once in 

the Brassicales and again in Putranjivaceae (Malpighiales) 
(Chapter 10). Symbiosis with nodule-forming nitrogen- 
fixing bacteria appears to have evolved many times, but 
all within a single well-defined clade—the nitrogen-fixing 
clade of rosids—leading to the suggestion that the predis- 
position for nitrogen-fixing symbiosis evolved only once 
in the angiosperms (Soltis et al. 1995; see Chapter 10). In 
contrast, C, photosynthesis has evolved repeatedly in the 
angiosperms in distantly related groups, but often within 
a small number of species in a given group (Kellogg 1999; 
Sage et al. 1999, 2011). This is remarkable given that 
C, photosynthesis is a complex trait (see Hibberd and 
Covshoff 2010; Sage et al. 2011) that necessitates changes 
to several genes involved in multiple traits and processes, 
including stem and leaf anatomy as well as the transfer of 
metabolites and regulation by many enzymes. 
The C, pathway is an adaptation to high light intensities, 
high temperatures, and a dry climate. The optimal tempera- 
ture range for C, photosynthesis is much higher than that 
for C, photosynthesis. The C, photosynthetic pathway is 
well understood and developmentally and genetically com- 
plex (Edwards and Walker 1983; Sage et al. 2011). Typi- 
cally, C, plants have a characteristic leaf anatomy (Kranz 
anatomy; Fig. 13.10) in which the leaves have an orderly 
arrangement of mesophyll cells around a layer of large 
bundle-sheath cells; together, these two cell types form two 
concentric layers or rings around the vascular bundle. Add- 
Parallel and Convergent Evolution 
337 
ing to the complexity are multiple types of Kranz anatomy 
(below). 
Early attempts to explain the broad distribution of 
C, photosynthesis among the angiosperms involved hy- 
potheses of repeated loss and lateral transfer. However, the 
most likely explanation is repeated evolution. Using the 
topologies for angiosperms available at that time, Kellogg 
(1999) made the first attempt to address the phylogenetic 
distribution of C, photosynthesis across the angiosperms 
and within particular clades, including asterids and Poa- 
ceae, in which many C, species occur. A reanalysis was then 
conducted by Soltis et al. (2005b) using better-supported 
topologies available at that time. More recently, Sage et al. 
(2011) have reconsidered the evolution of C,, and we rely 
largely on those results here. 
Whereas Kellogg’s (1999) analyses indicated at least 
31 origins of C, photosynthesis, including multiple origins 
within some large clades (monocots and asterids), Sage 
et al. (2011) reported 62 lineages of C, photosynthesis and 
stressed that with so many independent origins, C, should 
be considered “one of the most convergent of the com- 
plex evolutionary phenomena” (p. 1). Of these 62 origins, 
36 (60%) are in eudicot lineages, and the other 26 (40%) 
are in monocots. However, there are no reports from basal 
angiosperm lineages, the magnoliids, or Chloranthales—as 
with carnivory (above), C, was clearly a later innovation in 
angiosperms, limited to monocots and eudicots.

C, has arisen 
in all major subclades 
of eudicots 
(Fig. 13.11). In the superrosid clade, it occurs in multiple 
rosid 
lineages 
(Brassicales-Cleomaceae; 
Malpighiales- 
Euphorbiaceae; Zygophyllales-Zygophyllaceae), 
but not 
within Saxifragales. Within superasterids, C, occurs in as- 
terids (Boraginales-Boraginaceae; Lamiales-Acanthaceae, 
Scrophulariaceae; Asterales-Asteraceae), as well as Caryo- 
phyllales (Amaranthaceae 
including 
the formerly 
rec- 
ognized 
Chenopodiaceae, 
Gisekiaceae, 
Molluginaceae, 
Nyctaginaceae, Polygonaceae, Portulacaceae; see below), 
Fagales 
but not in Santalales. In monocots, C, is limited to Alis- 
matales (Hydrocharitaceae) and Poales (Cyperaceae, Poa- 
ceae). Thus, despite wide evolutionary occurrence, there 
are clear C, hotspots. Although C, is scattered across eu- 
dicots (Fig. 13.11), one clear eudicot evolutionary hot spot 
is Caryophyllales. 
In addition to the many origins of C, photosynthesis on 
a broad scale, Kellogg (1999) and more recently Sage et al. 
(2011) also showed that multiple origins were frequent 
within several families, such as Asteraceae (four origins),

Zygophyllaceae (two), Cleomaceae (three), Paaceae (18), 
and Cyperaceae (six). Hydrocharitaceae are noteworthy in 
that C, in both Hydrilla and Egeria clearly differs from that 
of all other C, lineages because in these two aquatic genera, 
rather than above-ground photosynthetic leaves and stems, 
leaves are submersed. These two genera also exhibit cellu- 
lar differences from all other C, plants (Bowes 2011; Sage 
et al. 2011). 
CARYOPHYLLALES 
There is widespread variation in photosynthetic systems 
in Caryophyllales, and the pattern of origins and losses 
of C, photosynthesis in Caryophyllales has long been rec- 
ognized as complex and highly labile (e.g., Pyankov et al. 
2001). Sage et al. (2007, 2011) estimated 23 origins in this

clade. Origins occur in multiple families: Aizoaceae, Caryo- 
phyllaceae, Amaranthaceae, Gisekiaceae, Molluginaceae, 
Nyctaginaceae, Polygonaceae, and Portulacaceae. In some 
of these families, there have been multiple origins. Ama- 
ranthaceae (including the former Chenopodiaceae) are par- 
ticularly complex (represented here in Fig. 13.12). 
POACEAE 
Several possible origins of C, photosynthesis are indi- 
cated for Poaceae. The Grass Phylogeny Working Group II 
(GPWG II 2012) has provided not only a robust frame- 
work phylogenetic tree for Poaceae but also reassessed 
the number of origins of C, photosynthesis (see also Sage 
et al. 2011). Our review is a summary of the findings of 
GPWG II (2012) and Sage et al. (2011). The number of

340 Chapter 13 
C, grasses is huge (~4600), but all examples occur in the 
PACMAD clade (see Chapter 7). GPWG II (2012) inferred 
22-24 origins of the C, pathway and only one potential 
reversal—the different estimates were a result of the use 
of different underlying trees. The origins reported by the 
GPWG II (2012) conform to those identified in earlier 
analyses (e.g., Christin et al. 2009). As the GPWG II (2012) 
noted, these results indicate that the relationships of most 
C, grass clades are now well understood. These origins are 
shown in Fig. 13.13 and listed in Table 13.5. 
Uncertainties in relationships and evolution of C, in 
grasses based on GPWG II (2012) are focused on two 
places. The first is in Boivinellinae (Panicoideae), which in- 
cludes two C, genera, Alloteropsis and Echinochloa. These 
are not sisters, so they are likely distinct origins, but their 
closest C, relatives are unclear. A potential reversal from 
C, to C, occurs in this part of the tree, in Alloteropsis. The 
second area of uncertainty involves the Arthropogoninae 
clade (Panicoideae). These uncertainties result in the num- 
ber of inferred origins in each group ranging from two to 
five (GPWG II 2012). 
These groups also illustrate how it can be difficult to 
determine an unambiguous number of origins of C, photo- 
synthesis in some lineages. In fact, attempts to do so may 
be misleading in that even a well-resolved phylogenetic tree 
does not overcome the problem of taking into account past 
photosynthetic transitions (GPWG II 2012). An important 
point stressed by GPWG II (2012) is that some of the in- 
ferred separate “origins” may not actually be independent. 
Certain key “precursor traits” likely evolved early in some 
grass lineage (or lineages), which in turn increased the pos- 
sibility of evolving the C, phenotype. That is, various ele- 
ments of the C, phenotype in some “independent” lineages 
were probably inherited from their common ancestor. This 
pattern of extended, parallel evolution of the C, pathway 
has been demonstrated in several eudicot groups (e.g., 
McKown et al. 2005; Christin et al. 2011) and is similar to 
the evolution of the capacity for symbiosis with nitrogen- 
fixing bacteria in rosids (Chapter 10). 
Important insights into C, evolution have recently been 
obtained via the use of a densely sampled, large phyloge- 
netic tree. Edwards and Smith (2010) used independent 
contrasts in a study of C,/C, grasses and habitat features 
(also noted in Chapter 3; see Fig. 3.14). C, grasses dominate 
tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas, whereas 
C, grasses typify cooler temperate grassland regions. This 
pattern has been attributed to C, physiology, and it has 
long been maintained that the evolution of the pathway 
enabled C, grasses to persist in warmer environments. Ed- 
wards and Smith (2010) found, however, that grasses are 
ancestrally a warm-adapted clade and that C, evolution

and tropical biomes (Fig. 3.14). Instead, based on an inde- 
pendent contrast analysis, 18 of 20 inferred C, origins were 
correlated with marked reductions in mean annual precipi- 
tation. Hence, precipitation may be the crucial underlying 
causal factor involved in the evolution of C,.

(Hatch et al. 1975; Sage et al. 2011), using NAD-malic 
enzyme (NAD-ME), NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), 
or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) as the pri- 
mary decarboxylase. NADP-ME is used by 43 of 62 clades, 
and NAD-ME is used by 20 (mostly eudicots); only grasses 
use PCK. 
Kellogg (1999) and coworkers (Sinha and Kellogg 1996; 
Giussani et al. 2001) used Poaceae as an example of the 
variability in the C, pathway within a single clade. The 
NAD-malic enzyme (ME) type is present in Centropodia 
and Chloridoideae. Eriachne exhibits the NADP-ME sub- 
type. Considering the Panicoideae, both the PCK and NAD- 
ME subtypes of C, photosynthesis have each evolved only 
once; the other origins of C, photosynthesis are NADP-ME 
(Giussani et al. 2001). 
As another example of chemical variability, the enzymes 
involved in the evolution of C, photosynthesis within 
Caryophyllales are complex. Phylogenetic analysis of tribe 
Salsoleae (Amaranthaceae) revealed the complexities of 
this family. The molecular results provide strong support 
for the origin and evolution of two main groups, one hav- 
ing NAD-ME and the other NADP-ME C, photosynthesis 
(Pyankov et al. 2001). These NAD-ME and NADP-ME 
clades have not only different photosynthetic types but 
also different structural and photosynthetic characteristics 
in cotyledons. The topology also reveals two independent 
reversions to C, photosynthesis and loss of Kranz anatomy 
(Pyankov et al. 2001; see also Kadereit et al. 2003). 
ANATOMY 
The characteristic Kranz anatomy mostly associated with 
C, photosynthesis displays various patterns, as might be 
expected by its diverse phylogenetic occurrences. Sage 
et al. (2011) found extreme variability, including 22 Kranz 
anatomy cell types with additional variation in some of 
these cell types. Among eudicots, the most common type 
is termed atriplicoid, present in at least 20 of the 36 eudi- 
cot lineages that have C,. There is also extensive variation 
in anatomy within monocots. In Cyperaceae and Poaceae, 
most clades have evolved a unique type of Kranz anatomy; 
the classic type that is often depicted represents seven lin- 
eages of grasses. 
Thus, the C, pathway is not a single pathway, but sev- 
eral pathways that share phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyl- 
ase (PEP carboxylase or PEPC) as a carbon acceptor. The 
use of PEPC as a carbon acceptor is common, and the ac- 
tivation of a PEPC pathway for C, photosynthesis may be 
relatively easy. The required anatomical changes may be 
more difficult to achieve, and this may be more of a limiting 
factor, and ultimately the causal agent, in the scattered and 
sporadic distribution of C, photosynthesis among flower- 
ing plants (Kellogg 1999). The absence of Kranz anatomy 
in some members of Caryophyllales (Pyankov et al. 2001; 
Voznesenskaya et al. 2001) demonstrates, however, that 
biochemical and anatomical components of C, photosyn- 
thesis can be decoupled (Kadereit et al. 2014). 
INTERMEDIATES 
Some angiosperms have features that are considered inter- 
mediate between the traits of C, and C, species, but these 
types may in fact be evolutionarily stable, final stages, not 
evolutionary intermediates between C, and C,, as previ- 
ously suggested (Monson et al. 1984; reviewed in Sage 
et al. 2011). At this point, however, the term C,-C, inter- 
mediate is mainly used to refer to those plants possessing a 
photorespiratory CO,-concentrating mechanism, in which 
expression of the photorespiratory enzyme glycine decar- 
boxylase (GDC) is localized to bundle sheath cells (BSCs) 
(Monson 1999; Bauwe 2011; Sage et al. 2011). This lo- 
calization of the enzyme GDC to the bundle sheath forces 
all glycine produced by photorespiration to move into the 
BSCs to complete the photorespiratory cycle, and the end 
result is enhanced photosynthetic efficiency (see Sage et al. 
2011 for a review). In addition, C,—C, intermediate species 
have evolved C,-like traits, including close vein spacing and 
enlarged BSCs (Sage 2004). These evolutionary changes 
may indeed increase the chances of subsequent C, evolu- 
tion (Bauwe 2011), but recent authors stress that they are 
also advantageous on their own. Many C,—C, lineages are 
distinct from C, clades. In fact, numerous separate (21) ori- 
gins of C,—C, intermediate photosynthesis have now been 
reported (Sage et al. 2011). The first C,—C, intermediate de- 
scribed was Mollugo verticillata, followed by the report of 
intermediate species in diverse eudicots and monocots (re- 
viewed in Sage et al. 2011). Most intermediates are in gen- 
era that also include C, plants. However, roughly 25% of 
all intermediates occur in taxa that are not closely related 
to a C, lineage. For example, there are two occurrences of 
C.-C, intermediates in Brassicaceae, in which no C, plants 
are known. 
Flaveria is one of several genera that contains some spe- 
cies that are C, and others that are C » as well as several 
species that are considered C,—C, intermediates. Based on 
phylogenetic results coupled with other evidence, Kopriva 
et al. (1996) favored a single origin of C.-C, intermediate 
photosynthesis, with a subsequent origin of C,, but subse- 
quent work has changed this view. Flaveria has nine Cc 
C, species. Using a phylogenetic approach, McKown et al.

(2005) showed there are two subclades (A and B) and that 
C.-C, intermediacy has evolved twice in the genus (once in 
each subclade) and is evolutionarily intermediate between 
C, and C, in clade A, but not in clade B. C,-like photosyn- 
thesis is also derived once independently in each of these 
subclades from C, ancestors with high vein density (Mc- 
Kown and Dengler 2007). These examples show the dif- 
ficultly in pinpointing the true “origin” of these pathways 
because several distinct lineages have independently built 
upon a shared ancestral set of what are considered key fa- 
cilitating traits. 
CENTERS OF ORIGIN 
Sage et al. (2011) also estimated the geographic center of 
origin for 47 lineages of C, plants. The centers of origin for 
eudicot lineages were clustered in arid and semi-arid re- 
gions of southwestern North America, south-central South 
America, Central Asia, northeastern and southern Africa, 
and interior Australia (Fig. 13.14). However, the ancestral 
distributions of the monocot taxa with C, photosynthesis 
are more problematic to reconstruct. Nonetheless, the re- 
sults suggested South America was a major center for ori- 
gins of C, photosynthesis in monocots. 

Floral Diversification 
INTRODUCTION 
In the past ten years, research on flower morphology and 
development, and the genes underlying floral structures, has 
progressed on a broad front. Comparative morphological 
studies of large clades have been carried out, in some cases 
in close parallel with phylogenetic studies that led to finer 
resolution of relationships, enabling new studies of flower 
evolution, a process of reciprocal illumination. Examples 
are analyses of Malpighiales (e.g., Matthews and Endress 
2008, 2011, 2013; Matthews et al. 2012; Xi et al. 2012b; 
Endress et al. 2013), Ericales (Schonenberger et al. 2005, 
2010; Sch6nenberger 2009; von Balthazar and Schénen- 
berger 2013), and Fabales (Prenner 2004a; Bello et al. 
2007, 2009, 2010). Prominent structural features, such as 
ovules (Endress 2011a), floral monosymmetry and asym- 
metry (Endress 2012), and multicarpellate gynoecia (En- 
dress 2014), have been studied across all angiosperms, and 
insight has been gained into structural interrelationships 
of these traits. Moreover, evo-devo studies have been con- 
ducted on clades that are only distantly related to model 
species (e.g., Boyden et al. 2012; Yockteng et al. 2013). Fos- 
sil and extant flowers have been internally reconstructed 
with new techniques, especially new variants of tomogra- 
phy (Schonenberger 2005; Friis et al. 2009, 2011, 2013, 
2014; Gamisch et al. 2013; Staedler et al. 2013; Nikolov 
et al. 2014), allowing greater insight into fossils of flowers 
that were previously known only from surface views (e.g., 
the Early Cretaceous water lily Monetianthus, Friis et al. 
2009) and into large-flowered extant plants that cannot be 
studied in toto with microtome series (e.g., Rafflesiaceae, 
Nikolov et al. 2014). Evolutionary changes in flowers of 
closely related species and in the context of pollinator shifts 
have also received recent attention (e.g., Barrett 2008, 
2013; Crane et al. 2010). 
Flowers are exclusive to angiosperms. Although the flow- 
ers of all angiosperms are homologous in a general sense, 
floral organization exhibits different traits when the basal 
angiosperms (ANA grade and magnoliids; see Chapters 4 
and 5) are compared with highly apomorphic groups, such 
as orchids or some asterids. These differences are not single 
characters, but entire sets of traits make up the evolution- 
ary “behavior” of flowers. Such major evolutionary steps 
are often referred to as “key innovations” (e.g., Muller and 
Wagner 1991; Endress 2001b; Wagner 2001; Donoghue 
2005; Ree 2005; Moore and Donoghue 2009; Vamosi and 
Vamosi 2010). Such innovations have been hypothesized 
to enable new radiations; consequently, the presence of an 
enhanced number of new forms is more likely to produce 
additional key innovations, which, in turn, can be seen as 
enhanced evolvability. Here we provide an overview of 
some of the “key innovations” in floral diversification. 
In ANA grade and magnoliid angiosperms, flowers are 
flexible in organ number and organ phyllotaxis, and thus 
a wide range of organ numbers is possible, from one to 
thousands, in flowers with spiral or whorled or irregular 
organ position. In the course of angiosperm evolution, key 
innovations have involved the following changes: (1) syn- 
organization (fusion or otherwise close association) of 
organs of the same kind and (2) synorganization between 
organs of different kinds (Endress 1990a, 1994a, 2001b). 
Preconditions for or consequences of this synorganization 

were restrictions to whorled phyllotaxis andeto fixed and 
low numbers of organs. Examples of synorganization are 
syncarpy, sympetaly, and adnation of petals and stamens 
and of stamens and carpels. The most complex flowers, 
such as in Orchidaceae and Apocynaceae, are characterized 
by many and highly elaborated kinds of synorganization 
and by a uniform number of organs. Other key innovations 
include the differentiation of sepals and petals and the tran- 
sition from crassinucellar (and bitegmic) to tenuinucellar 
(and unitegmic) ovules. 
Tepals (or sepals and petals), stamens, and carpels are 
the structural elements, or modular structures, that com- 
pose a flower. Their number and arrangement can vary 
widely. However, if a flower is bisexual, a gynoecium is 
always in the center of the flower surrounded by an an- 
droecium. Thus, this sequence is part of the fixed floral 
organization (see next paragraph). Only one exception is 
known in which an androecium is regularly surrounded 
by a gynoecium in bisexual flowers: Lacandonia (Triurida- 
ceae) (Marquez-Guzman et al. 1989). However, the carpel 
whorl is so distorted in Lacandonia that it becomes dif- 
ficult to determine what is morphologically (not simply to- 
pographically) inside versus outside (Endress 2014). Flow- 
ers with a whorl each of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels 
have been used: as the basis for the ABC model of flower 
development in molecular developmental genetics (Coen 
and Meyerowitz 1991; see below). In unisexual flowers, 
the stamens or the carpels are reduced to various degrees; 
they are either suppressed (initiated but not differentiated) 
or lost (not noticeably initiated) (cf. Tucker 1988; Diggle 
et al. 2011). 
The crown group of angiosperms has existed for at least 
135 million years (see Chapters 1-3). Flowers similar in 
structure to those of the basalmost extant clades have ex- 
isted at least since that time. Since then, many evolution- 
ary changes and radiations have taken place. Some floral 
traits have undergone many changes, whereas others have 
remained nearly static. 
Thus, it is practical to distinguish different levels of 
structure, such as organization (bauplan), construction (ar- 
chitecture), and mode (style), if used in a general way (cf. 
Vogel 1954, 2012; Endress 1994a). Organization (bauplan) 
refers to features that are conservative (e.g., presence and 
pattern of disposition of floral organs: sepals, petals, sta- 
mens, carpels); construction (architecture) refers to shape 
of flowers (e.g., bowl-shaped flowers, tubular flowers, sal- 
verform flowers, lip flowers, revolver flowers); mode (style) 
refers to adaptation of flowers to specific pollinators (e.g., 
bird-pollinated flowers, moth-pollinated flowers, wind- 
pollinated flowers; colors and scents are also attributes 
of “mode”). The levels of organization, construction, and 
Floral Diversification 
345 
mode are in general increasingly unstable in evolutionary 
terms—that is, mode varies at shallower phylogenetic levels 
than organization. 
That these concepts should be applied only in a loose 
way is shown by the fact that, for instance, a feature cor- 
responding to organization may suddenly become labile in 
a group, as expected for an evolving group of organisms. 
An example is found in Brassicaceae, which consistently 
have flowers with four petals and six stamens. However, in 
Lepidium this combination has become unstable, and re- 
ductions to flowers with four or two stamens and without 
petals have occurred several times (Endress 1992a; Bow- 
man et al. 1999; Karoly and Conner 2000; Mummenhoff 
et al. 2001). 
PATHWAYS OF MORPHOLOGICAL 
EVOLUTIONARY INNOVATIONS 
Innovations in floral evolution may be achieved through 
several pathways: 
(1) Use of existing structures for new functions. An exam- 
ple is the odd staminode in flowers of Lamiales. Con- 
comitant with the evolution of monosymmetry, the up- 
per median stamen has been reduced to a staminode 
or has been lost. In a few genera, such as Penstemon 
(Plantaginaceae) and Jacaranda (Bignoniaceae), this 
staminode became secondarily enlarged and functions 
as a nectar guide for pollinating bees (Endress 1994a; 
Walker-Larsen and Harder 2000, 2001), and in Jaca- 
randa, in addition, the staminode has secretory hairs 
that produce scent (Guimaraes et al. 2008). This kind 
of evolutionary innovation was called “diverted devel- 
opment” by Crane and Kenrick (1997a). 
(2) Synorganization of organs of the same kind and/or or- 
gans of different kinds. An example is the formation of 
pollinia with transport organs (translators) in Orchi- 
daceae and Apocynaceae, a precondition of which was 
the synorganization of androecium and gynoecium by 
congenital fusion in orchids (gynostemium, or column) 
or postgenital fusion in Apocynaceae (gynostegium) 
(Vogel 1959, 1969; Endress 1990a, 1994a, 1997b, 
2011c, 2016; Rudall and Bateman 2002). 
(3) Ectopic gene expression. A putative example is the 
proposed evolutionary origin of carpels by ectopic de- 
velopment of ovules on microsporophylls in a Meso- 
zoic group of gymnosperms, as proposed by Frohlich 
and Parker (2000) (see Chapter 1). Another example is 
the expression of floral genes in the bracts of Cornus 
(Zhang et al. 2008). 

346 Chapter 14 
EVOLUTIONARY RADIATIONS AND 
PARALLEL EVOLUTION 
Adaptive radiations are spectacular evolutionary events. 
Within angiosperms, many examples of adaptive floral ra- 
diations were triggered by different groups of pollinators, 
which have been studied in some detail (review in van der 
Niet and Johnson 2012). Two classic examples are reported 
by Vogel (1954, 2012) on various angiosperm genera in 
South Africa (e.g., Bauhinia, Clerodendrum, Erica, Pelar- 
gonium) and by Grant and Grant (1965) on Polemonia- 
ceae, both on floral adaptation to different pollinators and 
accompanying structural, visual, and olfactorial diversifica- 
tion. Bees, butterflies, sphingids, flies, birds, and bats are 
involved in the rich diversification of many of these genera. 
More recently, it has become possible to base such stud- 
ies on a phylogenetic framework, derived from molecular 
studies and allowing more rigorous reconstruction of evo- 
lutionary changes. A basic general work on this subject is 
the book by Givnish and Sytsma (1997), in which Givnish 
(1997) provided a general introduction to the field, and a 
number of authors discuss case studies, among them sev- 
eral on flowers. 
The general lesson for flower evolution derived from 
such studies is that many structural (and other) changes are 
apparently simple whereas others are more complex. Such 
features may greatly differ in detail from group to group. 
However, some previously overlooked patterns may later 
emerge from a comparative survey of many groups. 
In the past ten years, new studies combined with more 
detailed phylogenetic analyses and improved phylogenetic 
resolution have greatly refined this general insight. Iochro- 
minae, a subtribe of Solanaceae with a high diversity of flo- 
ral forms (Cocucci 1999) and pollination systems (encom- 
passing hummingbirds, hymenopterans, lepidopterans and 
dipterans; Smith et al. 2008a,b), traditionally contained 
six genera (Acnistus, Dunalia, Eriolarynx, lochroma, Sara- 
cha, and Vassobia) (Fig. 14.1). In a phylogenetic study us- 
ing three nuclear loci, Smith and Baum (2006) found that 
only Vassobia is monophyletic. The other five genera were 
earlier mistaken as clades because of parallel evolution 
in floral forms. In the exceptionally diverse genus Ruellia 
(Acanthaceae), Tripp and Manos (2008), studying the de- 
gree of evolutionary transitions between different pollina- 
tion systems (hummingbird-, bat-, bee-, and moth-adapted 
flowers) (Fig. 14.2), showed that evolutionary transitions 
occurred between all four pollination systems and in both 
directions, but in different frequencies. The directions hum- 
mingbird to bee, bee to moth, hummingbird to moth, and 
bee to bat are more common than all other directions. The 
transition from bat-pollinated flowers to any other flowers 
is the most unlikely direction in Ruellia. Bee flowers de- 
rived from hummingbird flowers are slightly different from 
plesiomorphous bee flowers in Ruellia (Tripp and Manos 
2008). In contrast, in Penstemon and Keckiella (Plantag- 
inaceae), which contain bee- and hummingbird-pollinated 
flowers, the common evolutionary direction is bee to hum- 
mingbird, and this transition may have occurred separately 
21 times (Wilson et al. 2007). 
A prominent insight from many studies in the past 
ten years is that the great flexibility of flower evolution 
is ever more clearly demonstrated by more detailed and 
better-resolved phylogenetic analyses (reviews in Endress 
2011b,c). Multiple parallel evolution and “reversible” evo- 
lution have been demonstrated for floral features in almost 
all evolutionary studies of many clades (e.g., Onagraceae- 
Fuchsia, Berry et al. 2004; Solanaceae-Iochrominae, Smith 
and Baum 2006; Smith et al. 2008a,b; Acanthaceae-Ruellia, 
Tripp and Manos 2008; Euphorbiaceae-Dalechampia, 
Armbruster et al. 2009; Phyllanthaceae-Phyllantheae, Ka- 
wakita and Kato 2009; Bignoniaceae-Bignonieae, Alcan- 
tara and Lohmann 2010; oil flowers, Renner and Schae- 
fer 2010 (Fig. 14.3); Malpighiaceae, Zhang et al. 2012; 
Orchidaceae-Orchideae, Inda et al. 2012; Orchidaceae- 
Oncidiinae, Neubig et al. 2012; Papadopoulos et al. 2013; 
Orchidaceae-Disa, Johnson et al. 2013; review of various 
angiosperms, van der Niet and Johnson 2012). The notion 
of “Brownian motion”-like evolution (Simpson 1944; En- 
dress 1994a; Losos 2011) is thus more appropriate than 
ever, and a big open question is which evolutionary direc- 
tions are less likely to occur than others (Barrett 2010a,b, 
2013), which again differs among groups (e.g., Wilson 
et al. 2007; Tripp and Manos 2008). 
A topic of special interest is the evolution of deceptive 
flowers that do not offer a reward to their pollinators, a 
phenomenon especially common in orchids, in which both 
sexual and food deception are widespread (Schiestl 2005; 
Gaskett 2011; Schiestl and Johnson 2013). Food deception 
appears to be ancestral in Orchideae (Cozzolino and Wid- 
mer 2005; Inda et al. 2012). The primarily olfactorial role 
of sexually deceptive orchids (Peakall et al. 2010; Schliiter 
et al. 2011; van der Niet et al. 2011), but also optical (New- 
man et al. 2012) and tactile aspects, have received recent 
attention (Francisco and Ascensao 2013). The role of scent 
in pollination was also analyzed in other families, such as 
in beetle-pollinated Araceae (Schiestl and Dotterl 2012).

color, scent, secretions) of the floral organs themselves as 
well as the collective behavior of the organs, such as floral 
phyllotaxis, floral symmetry, and synorganization of floral 
organs. Here we review patterns of variation in floral form. 
Floral Phyllotaxis 
Floral phyllotaxis may be whorled (Fig. 14.4a-c), spiral 
(Fig. 14.4d-f), or unordered (Endress 1987a; Doust 2001). 
In spiral phyllotaxis, all subsequent organs are initiated 
with the same divergence angle (i.e., the angle of the two 
lines drawn from the floral center to the center of each 
of two subsequent organs). In whorled phyllotaxis, com- 
monly a fixed number of organs is arranged in a whorl, 
and subsequent whorls alternate with each other. Thus, the 
divergence angle is constant within a whorl but different at 
the transition to the subsequent whorl. In complex whorls, 
the number of organs may be doubled (or multiplied) or 
halved from one whorl to the subsequent whorl (Staedler 
and Endress 2009; Endress 2011c). Unordered phyllotaxis 
often occurs when the number of organs is greatly in- 
creased and the ratio of the size of the floral apex to the size

of individual organs is increased or when the floral apex 
has an irregular shape. 
A simple way to determine whether a pattern is whorled 
or spiral is to examine a young floral bud when all organs 
have been initiated but are still short. The organs are regu- 
larly disposed in sets of spiral lines (parastichies) going to 
the right and to the left. In whorled patterns, the steep- 
ness (inclination) of corresponding right and left paras- 
tichies is the same (Fig. 14.4a,b), but in spiral patterns 
the steepness is different (Fig. 14.4d,e). In addition, in 
whorled flowers the organs are at the same time disposed 
on straight radial lines (orthostichies) (Fig. 14.4c), but 
such orthostichies are absent in spiral flowers. In flowers 
with irregular phyllotaxis, there are neither orthostichies 
nor parastichies (Endress 2006; Endress and Doyle 2007). 
In the literature, the presence of parastichies has often 
been mistaken for spiral phyllotaxis. However, it should 
be clear that parastichies are characteristic of all regular 
phyllotaxis patterns, spiral and whorled. The spiral phyl- 
lotaxis pattern gets its name from the (onto)genetic spiral, 
which is a single line and encompasses all floral organs 
in the sequence of their initiation (sequence numbered in 
Fig. 14.4f). 
These phyllotactic patterns may not be exclusive in an 
individual flower. Flowers of core eudicots are known to 
have whorled phyllotaxis; however, even in such flowers, 
phyllotaxis commonly begins spirally in the calyx and be- 
comes whorled only in the corolla. Alternatively, flowers 
with an unordered phyllotaxis in the polymerous androe- 
cium or gynoecium often have an ordered phyllotaxis in 

the perianth. Another complication is that everiin flowers 
with a completely whorled phyllotaxis, the organs may be 
initiated in a spiral sequence (Erbar and Leins 1985, 1997; 
Endress 1987a). However, the plastochrons (i.e., the time 
lapse between the initiation of two subsequent organs) 
seem then to be much shorter than in spiral phyllotaxis. 
If a perianth is lacking, the phyllotaxis of the remaining 
organs is often irregular (Endress 1989b, 1990a; see also 
Tucker 1991; Doust 2001). This observation suggests that 
the perianth sets the boundary conditions for phyllotaxic 
regularity of the organs of the inner floral region—that is, 
androecium and gynoecium. 
In spiral phyllotaxis of flowers, the divergence angle— 
that is, the angle between two subsequently formed organs 
with the floral center, commonly approaches the value 
of 137.5 ...° (Fibonacci pattern). Developmentally, an 
activator-inhibitor mechanism exists in the floral apex, in 
Floral Diversification 
349 
which the inhibitor exponentially decays and produces this 
pattern (Meinhardt 1982). Auxin has been found to play a 
central role in phyllotaxis formation in vegetative shoots by 
acting as an activator of organ initiation (review in Traas 
2013). Ecologically, the spiral pattern ensures that no two 
organs fall exactly in the same radius and is common when 
many organs are arranged on a short axis, e.g., the showy 
perianth organs in a flower (or the leaves in a vegetative 
rosette). In contrast, a whor!ed position is only favorable 
(e.g., for visual impact or absorption of radiation) for a 
small number of organs that can be displayed in one or 
two series in a rosette. Thus, it is not surprising that in 
core eudicots and monocots, in which the number of petals 
(or tepals) is generally low, the whorled pattern is almost 
exclusively present, whereas in the ANA grade, magnoliids, 
and some families of basal eudicots (e.g., Ranunculales), in 
which there is a large range of numbers of perianth mem-

bers, both phyllotaxis patterns occur (Endress 1987a). In 
some magnoliids, in extreme cases, both spiral and whorled 
patterns may even occur in the same species (e.g., Drimys, 
Winteraceae, Doust 2001). 
The situation is more complicated in flowers than in veg- 
etative shoots because, in contrast to vegetative shoots, in 
flowers there are repeated switches from one kind of organ 
to another. In whorled flowers these switches are abrupt. 
Because the width of different kinds of organs within a 
flower may differ considerably, there may also be a change 
in organ number from one whorl to the next. For instance, 
double positions may occur after the transition from the 
perianth to the androecium, such that instead of one organ 
in an expected position, there are two side by side (Endress 
1994a; e.g., Nymphaeaceae, Aristolochiaceae, Butomaceae, 
Velloziaceae, 
Papaveraceae, 
Rosaceae, 
Zygophyllaceae, 
Phytolaccaceae). In most eudicots, toward the floral center 
the reverse takes place: the gynoecium generally has fewer 
organs than the inner whorl of the androecium (Endress 
1987a). 
Due to synorganization, the extension of “phyllotaxis 
theories” (Lacroix and Sattler 1988) to flowers is limited. 
For example, the association of different organs of two dif- 
ferent whorls may be so intimate that the two types of or- 
gans always occur together, even if this arrangement is not 
expected in a normal phyllotactic situation. An example is 
the pentamerous terminal flowers of Berberis vulgaris, in 
which the five petals and five stamens are exactly in the 
same sector, although they are in spiral phyllotaxis (Endress 
1987a). The petal-stamen complex forms a functional ap- 
paratus, in which the nectaries (on petal base) are close to 
the sensitive stamen base, where stamen movement is trig- 
gered by touch. Flower organization has changed during 
evolution. Flowers became more “closed” (in their genetic 
makeup and evolutionary behavior) and the organs more 
integrated (Endress 1987a, 1990a). 
Floral Merism 
Floral merism (mery, merosity) describes the number of 
organs in a whorl (in whorled flowers) or a series (in spi- 
ral flowers) (Eichler 1875-1878; Endress 1987a, 1994a; 
Ronse De Craene and Smets 1994; Endress and Doyle 
2007; Staedler et al. 2007). This number is related to flo- 
ral phyllotaxis and is dependent also on the ratio of organ 
primordium size (width) to the floral apex size (diameter) 

at the time the organs are formed. The smalleg-the ratio, 
the more organs are formed in a whorl or series. In ANA 
grade and magnoliid taxa and some early-diverging eudi- 
cots (especially Ranunculaceae, e.g., Schdffel 1932), floral 
merism may be highly variable within a species or variable 
even within an individual. In contrast, in nested clades of 
monocots and asterids, floral merism may be constant even 
(almost) for entire families (e.g., Apocynaceae) or orders 
(Lamiales); the genetic canalization of floral organ number 
(e.g., Huether 1969) allows increased synorganization of 
organs (Endress 1990a, 2006). Thus, in more nested clades 
of angiosperms, diversity is less in organ number than in 
organ plasticity and evolution of various precision mecha- 
nisms and specialization for a wide variety of pollinators 
(Stebbins 1970, 1974; Endress 1994a). However, merism 
may change within a flower, especially at the transition 
from perianth to androecium and from androecium to gy- 
noecium, independent of phylogenetic position and other 
aspects of variability. (Diversity in floral merism is dis- 
cussed in more detail in the chapters on basal angiosperms 
and early-diverging eudicots, Chapters 4-6, 8.) 
Floral Symmetry 
Most flowers are polysymmetric (actinomorphic, with sev- 
eral symmetry planes) (Fig. 14. 5a) or monosymmetric (zy- 
gomorphic, with one plane of symmetry) (Fig. 14.5b). In 
monosymmetric flowers, the plane of symmetry is usually 
vertical, and this position is commonly present from the 
beginning of development. Only in a few taxa is the plane 
of symmetry horizontal or oblique at the beginning and 
secondarily vertical only at anthesis by some bending or 
Floral Diversification 
351 
rotation of the flower. The flowers of ANA grade and mag- 
noliid taxa are polysymmetric. Floral monosymmetry has 
evolved many times from polysymmetry (Endress 1999, 
2012, Sargent 2004; Jabbour et al. 2009a,b; Citerne et al. 
2010; Hileman 2014a,b) and has led to conspicuous evo- 
lutionary radiations (Sargent 2004) (Fig. 14.6). A general 
trend is that in more synorganized flowers, monosymmetry 
appears more as a key innovation than in groups with less 
synorganized flowers. Species-rich groups with exclusively 
or predominantly monosymmetric flowers are Fabaceae, 
Lamiales, Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, and Zingiberales (En- 
dress 1999, 2001a, 2012; Ree and Donoghue 2000; Rudall 
and Bateman 2002); Asteraceae and Orchidaceae are the 
two most species-rich families of angiosperms. 
Evolutionary reversals from monosymmetry to poly- 
symmetry have occurred more often than previously be- 
lieved. In the only slightly monosymmetric Malpighiaceae, 
such reversals occurred several times (W. Zhang et al. 2012, 
2013), but even in Lamiales and Fabaceae with their pro- 
nouncedly monosymmetric flowers, 
a number of evolu- 
tionary reversals are known. These reversals have occurred 
primarily in phylogenetically relatively basal groups within 
these clades, such as Detarieae of Fabaceae (Cardoso et al. 
2012a), Gesneriaceae of Lamiales (Endress 1998; Zhou 
et al. 2008; Clark et al. 2011), and Prostantheroideae of 
Lamiaceae (G. Godden et al. unpubl.). It may be assumed 
that in such basal clades monosymmetry is structurally and 
genetically less deeply rooted than in more derived clades 
so that reversals are more likely to occur. In some cases, ap- 
proximate secondary polysymmetry evolved from mono- 
symmetry by a transition from pentamerous to tetramerous

Floral symmetry. Increased species number in 
clades with monosymmetric flowers compared to their poly- 
symmetric sisters (phylogeny adapted from Soltis et al. 2000). 
Brackets indicate the 19 sister group comparisons conducted 
by Sargent (2004). The number opposite each bracket indi- 
cates the difference in species number between the two sister 
groups (monosymmetric species minus polysymmetric species); 
a dagger indicates a monosymmetric family; an asterisk 
indicates a polysymmetric family. (Figure and legend modified 
from Sargent 2004, p. 605). 

(Donoghue et al. 1998; Endress 1999; Preston, et al. 2011) 
or Melianthaceae (Ronse De Craene et al. 2001). 
Asymmetric flowers (without a symmetry plane) have 
evolved from monosymmetric flowers in a few clades, such 
as Fabaceae, Orobanchaceae, Orchidaceae, and Zingibera- 
les (Endress 2012) (Fig. 14.5c), in some cases many times 
(Fabaceae, Prenner 2004b; Marazzi et al. 2006, 2007). 
Whereas the evolution of monosymmetry from polysym- 
metry has been studied in numerous molecular develop- 
mental studies, because one of the classical model organ- 
isms, Antirrhinum, is monosymmetric (e.g., Hileman et al. 
2003; Preston and Hileman 2009), the transition from 
monosymmetry to asymmetry is almost untackled (Bartlett 
and Specht 2011; Hileman 2014a,b). Unfortunately, mo- 
lecular developmental biologists often use the term “asym- 
metric” for monosymmetric and thus probably overlook 
the fact that there are truly asymmetric flowers. 
The establishment of floral symmetry is to a great ex- 
tent independent of floral phyllotaxis (Endress 1999). 
Monosymmetric flowers do not occur in basal angiosperms 
(except for monosymmetry by organ reduction, e.g., uni- 
staminate flowers in Chloranthaceae or unilaterally bistam- 
inate flowers in Piperaceae). Especially noteworthy and 
unusual are relatively highly elaborated monosymmetric 
flowers in basal eudicots (Ranunculaceae: Aconitum, Del- 
phinium), which are based on spiral phyllotaxis (Schoffel 
1932; Hiepko 1965b; Jabbour et al. 2009a). Probably all 
other elaborate monosymmetric flowers have whorled 
phyllotaxis. Unelaborated monosymmetric flowers occur in 
Proteaceae (Douglas and Tucker 1996a,b), Caryophyllales 
(some species of Cactaceae and Caryophyllaceae), rosids 
(some species of Capparaceae, Malvaceae, and Rutaceae), 
asterids (some species of Rubiaceae), and monocots (some 
species of Iridaceae and Amaryllidaceae) (Endress 1999). 
Perianth 
In most angiosperms, flowers have a perianth that com- 
monly consists of one or two whorls or series of organs 
with protective and attractive functions. In eudicots they 
are commonly called sepals and petals, whereas in the ANA 
grade, magnoliids, and most monocots, all perianth organs 
are referred to as tepals (Hiepko 1965b; Endress 2008). Pet- 
als evolved many times in the eudicots (Irish 2009; Ronse 
De Craene and Brockington 2013). For Caryophyllales 
alone, Brockington et al. (2009) calculated at least nine 
separate origins of petals. Thus, petals across the eudicots 
are not homologous in a phylogenetic sense, but may be 
homologous in an organizational sense (for such so-called 
biological homology, see Wagner 1989, 2014). 
Stamens and carpels are easy to define because of their 
specific functions. Stamens contain pollen sacs in which 
Floral Diversification 
353 
meiosis takes place and microspores are formed, and car- 
pels contain ovules in which meiosis takes places and mega- 
spores are formed. In contrast, tepals, or sepals and petals, 
are more difficult to define because their functions are less 
specific. Commonly, tepals or sepals have a mostly protec- 
tive function for the young inner floral organs, and petals 
have a mostly attractive function for pollinators during an- 
thesis. However, these functions can also be performed by 
other organs. Transfer of function has occurred between 
sepals and petals and between perianth and organs further 
inside the flowers and also outside the flowers (Baum and 
Donoghue 2002; Buzgo et al. 2005; Endress 2010a). In the 
majority of the eudicots, the perianth organs are present 
in two whorls or series. In these cases, sepals and petals 
are best defined by their position: sepals are the organs of 
the first whorl (or series), and petals are the organs of the 
second whorl (or series). Otherwise, there is no single char- 
acteristic that would always differentiate between sepals 
and petals. In cases with only one whorl (series) or more 
than two whorls (series), comparisons with the closest 
relatives that have two whorls (series) should help clarify 
homologies. 
However, several traits tend to be more common in 
sepals or more common in petals, thus allowing a loose 
characterization. These traits can be grouped into four 
categories: 
(1) Position: in a flower that contains sepals and petals, 
each organ type is commonly in one series, sepals 
are always in the outer series, and petals in the inner. 
However, if only one series or more than two series 
are present, distinguishing between them may be more 
problematic (see above). 
(2) Structure: sepals tend to be robust, persistent, green, 
acute, smooth, with broad base and more narrow up- 
per part, with three vascular strands in the floral base, 
and with only small intercellular spaces (Fig. 14.7a). 
In contrast, petals tend to be delicate, ephemeral, col- 
ored, obtuse or emarginate, papillate, with narrow 
base and broader upper part, with one vascular strand 
in the floral base, and with large intercellular spaces 
(Fig. 14.7b). 
(3) Development: sepals tend to be initiated in spiral se- 
quence (resulting in quincuncial aestivation) and dif- 
ferentiated early in flower development (Figs. 14.8a, 
14.9a). In contrast, petals tend to be initiated almost 
simultaneously or in a rapid spiral sequence and differ- 
entiated late, often being delayed until shortly before 
anthesis (Fig. 14.9b). 
(4) Function: sepals are commonly photosynthetic (green) 
protective organs for inner floral organs in bud and 
the young fruit; sometimes they are also involved in

fruit dispersal. Petals are commonly attractive organs 
for pollinators at anthesis (shape, color, scent) and are 
only rarely green or persistent. 
Petals that are characterized by the features assembled 
above are common in some core eudicots, especially in 
rosids (e.g., Geraniaceae; Endress 2010c) and Caryophyl- 
lales (e.g., Caryophyllaceae) (Rohweder 1967; Rohweder 
and Endress 1983; Endress 2011c). Among basal eudicots, 
only in some Ranunculales are similar petals present, espe- 
cially in Ranunculaceae and Berberidaceae (Hiepko 1965b; 
Erbar et al. 1999); however, the petals of these families are 
mostly characterized by the presence of nectaries, whereas 
nectaries occur at other sites in the flowers of core eudicots. 
In Saxifragales, the perianth is diverse, from the type just 
described to absent. 
In a number of other rosids and in many asterids, how- 
ever, the petals are robust, early differentiated, with a broad 
base, and protective at least in later stages of bud develop- 
ment when the sepals stop growing (Endress 201 1c) (Figs. 
14.8b, 14.10). Olacaceae, of Santalales, have a double 
perianth, with the sepals small and the petals exhibiting 
both protective functions from early in bud and attractive 
functions at anthesis. It seems that in more derived Santala- 
les the calyx is absent and only the petals remain (Endress 
1994a). 
: 
In many basal eudicots the perianth is simple (uniseri- 
ate); the sepals are well differentiated (Proteaceae), weakly 
differentiated (Buxaceae, Myrothamnaceae, Tetracentron), 
rudimentary (Trochodendron), or lacking (Eupteleaceae) 
(Jager-Ziirn 1966; Endress 1986a, 2010a; Douglas and 
Tucker 1996a; von Balthazar and Endress 2002a,b; Soltis 
et al. 2003c; Chen et al. 2007; Ren et al. 2007b). The prob- 
lem of sepal differentiation was discussed in a compara- 
tive developmental study by von Balthazar and Endress 
(2002a). However, the distinction between bracts and se- 
pals in basal eudicots has not yet been comparatively ex- 
amined critically. 
In basal angiosperms, several groups show some fea- 
tures of petals in the inner perianth members. However, the 
distinctness of such features is much less clear than in eu- 
dicots. Therefore, use of the terms sepals and petals in this 
assemblage (Hiepko 1965b; Endress 2008) is often prob- 
lematic. Among the ANA grade studied thus far (see Chap- 
ter 4), Cabomba (Nymphaeaceae) has inner perianth parts 
that come closest to the characterization of petals (Endress 
© 
2001c). 
In monocots, outer and inner perianth members are 
commonly less different from each other than in eudicots, 
although the inner may have more petal-like features than 
the outer (Weber 1980). Therefore, use of these terms in 
monocots is problematic.

Sympetaly and Floral Tubes 
In asterids, petals are commonly congenitally united (sym- 
petalous) (Fig. 14.5b). This has repercussions on petal 
structure, and some features are different from those of free 
petals. Such petals do not have narrow bases but are more 
often acute and have three main vascular bundles, and they 
are less delicate than those in flowers with free petals. In 
addition, their early development is less delayed than that 
of free petals, and they often take on a protective func- 
tion of the inner organs in later bud stages by extending 
beyond the sepals. Thus, in asterids, petals have several fea- 
tures that are more characteristic of sepals (Endress 1994a) 
(Fig. 14.7a,b). 
Sympetaly is a prominent key innovation in angiosperm 
evolution. It is a synapomorphy for euasterids (although 
it also occurs in some, but not all, members of Ericales 
and Cornales), one of the most species-rich major clades 
of angiosperms, in which some of the most complex flow- 
ers (asclepiads of Apocynaceae) and inflorescences (Astera- 
ceae) have evolved (see Chapter 11). Sympetaly has also 
evolved in a number of other groups, with a lower num- 
ber of genera and species than asterids, such as Caricaceae 
and some species of Crassulaceae, Malvaceae, and Ruta- 
ceae (El Ottra et al. 2013). In fact, sympetaly is present 
in rudimentary form—that is, as a very short basal zone, 
much more often than previously assumed (e.g., Trigonia- 
ceae and Dichapetalaceae, Matthews and Endress 2008; 
Cucurbitaceae [if the so-called petals really correspond 
to petals], Matthews and Endress 2004; some Protieae of 

356 Chapter 14 
Burseraceae, Bachelier and Endress 2009). Fusion of pet- 
als allows the formation of floral tubes, which, in turn, fa- 
cilitates adaptive radiations correlated with different pol- 
linators because the length and width of floral tubes can 
easily and rapidly be changed (Alexandersson and John- 
son 2002). Petal union also allows for the construction of 
larger flowers, because sympetaly provides stability to the 
floral architecture. Thus, the largest flowers in the world 
are in groups with united petals (or tepals) (Davis et al. 
2008). Examples are Brugmansia (Solanaceae) and Fagraea 
(Gentianaceae), both asterids, which attain flower lengths 
of more than 50 cm. Aristolochia (Piperales, magnoltids) 
and Rafflesia (Rafflesiaceae, Malpighiales, rosids, Nikolov 
et al. 2013), with flower sizes of a meter in length or diam- 
eter, respectively, have united tepals or sepals and petals. 
This architecture extends the upper end of a spectrum of 
diversification, which is narrower in plants with free peri- 
anth parts (see also Endress 1994a). 
In asterids, two kinds of developmental patterns of pet- 
als have been distinguished, “late” and “early” sympetaly 
(Erbar 1991; Erbar and Leins 1996). In late sympetaly, the 
developing petals appear free at first and become united 
by a common base. In early sympetaly, at first a ring meri- 
stem appears, on which the individual petals then become 
visible. Late sympetaly is common in Gentianales and La- 
miales, whereas early sympetaly is common in Dipsacales 
and Asterales. An interesting problem is whether these two 
developmental patterns could be (functionally or organiza- 
tionally) dependent on the overall shape of the floral apex 
at the time of organ inception (Endress 1997b; Roehls 
1998). Because in Gentianales and Lamiales the ovaries are 
predominantly superior and in Dipsacales and Asterales 
predominantly inferior, the early shape of the floral apex 
is more convex in the first group, but more concave in the 
latter. The concave shape could give the impression of a 
ring meristem at petal inception, whereas this is not the 
case in apices that are more convex. Erbar and Leins (2011) 
argue that this association may not be significant and men- 
tion some families with early sympetaly that have superior 
ovaries. However, the correlation still remains, and corolla 
development in asterids needs more detailed study. 
In some asterids, in early floral development sympetaly 
is expressed but is no longer evident in mature flowers (e.g., 
some Pittosporaceae, Araliaceae) (Erbar and Leins 1988, 
1995a). Developmental studies on seemingly choripetalous 
representatives of early-branching asterids (Cornales and 
Ericales) are needed. Perhaps more than one developmen- 
tal step is necessary to form distinct sympetaly: (1) conflu- 
ent meristems of the initiated petals, and (2) an intercalary 
elongation zone below the united petal meristems. It could 
be that in these seemingly choripetalous asterids, only step 
(1) has occurred but not step (2). This should also be stud- 
ied in other asterids that seemingly have free petals (see 
also Erbar and Leins 2011). 
In many groups with sympetalous flowers, the stamens 
are also fused with the corolla to a greater or lesser de- 
gree. This fusion enhances the firmness and stability of the 
floral tube even more and creates an intimate synorgani- 
zation between androecium and corolla. For instance, in 
polysymmetric flowers, this fusion may create five separate 
nectar canals (if five stamens are present), and this results 
in the architecture of revolver flowers, in which pollinators 
have to move around the flower to exploit the entire nectar 
source and thus most likely have extensive contact with 
anthers and stigmas. The most complex revolver flowers 
are in Apocynaceae (Asclepiadoideae, Periplocoideae, Se- 
camonoideae), in which five pollen units (groups of pol- 
linia) can be attached to an insect by means of a compli- 
cated transport organ (translator with clip or glue). Other 
clades of Apocynaceae have much simpler flowers, and the 
stepwise evolution of complex flowers can be seen if the en- 
tire family is studied comparatively (Fallen 1986; Endress 
et al. 1996; Endress and Bruyns 2000; M. Endress 2001). 
In some eudicots, sepals and petals are fused and form a 
synorganized perianth (e.g., Tropaeolaceae, Myrtaceae: es- 
pecially Eucalyptus; Drinnan and Ladiges 1989). In mono- 
cots, outer and inner perianth whorls may also be fused 
(e.g., some Asparagaceae). 
Floral Spurs 
Floral spurs are hollow outgrowths of perianth organs and 
are present in corollas more often than in calyces. They do 
not characterize large clades, but they have evolved in many 
angiosperm clades, especially in eudicots (among monocots, 
mainly in some orchids). Examples of spurred flowers are 
Aquilegia (Ranunculaceae) (Hodges 1997a,b; Whittall and 
Hodges 2007), Epimedium (Berberidaceae), and Halenia 
(Gentianaceae) (von Hagen and Kadereit 2002), all with 
four or five spurs. Most spurred flowers, however, have 
only one spur, as in Delphinium (Ranunculaceae), some 
Antirrhineae (Plantaginaceae) (Sutton 1988), and Hetero- 
toma (Campanulaceae) (Ayers 1990). These spurs mostly 
have a connection with nectar production and/or nectar 
presentation. In early-diverging eudicots with nectariferous 
petals (Ranunculaceae, Berberidaceae), nectar is produced 
at the end of the spur and stored in the spur, which is part 
of the petal. However, in Papaveraceae-Fumarioideae, the 
petals are not nectariferous, and nectar is produced at the 
base of the stamen filaments (e.g., Corydalis). In asterids, 
nectar is more often produced by a separate nectary disk 
and, if a spur is present, then secondarily stored in the spur. 
An exception is Halenia (Gentianaceae), in which nectar 
is produced directly in the spur, and the closest relatives 

have shallow petal nectaries. Another special case is Dia- 
scia (Scrophulariaceae), which has two oil-producing spurs 
per flower, from which specialized bees collect oil with their 
two front legs (Vogel 1974). 
A conspicuous adaptive radiation often accompanies the 
origin of spurs, particularly in comparison to close relatives 
with spur-less flowers. The presence of spurs has therefore 
been proposed as a key innovation (Hodges 1997b). How- 
ever, it has been argued that this is not the case for Halenia 
(Gentianaceae) (von Hagen and Kadereit 2002) because in 
this clade, radiation occurred long after spurs originated. 
As in other cases, a specific feature may apparently be a key 
innovation in one clade but not in another (Endress 2011c). 
Androecium 
The androecium comprises all stamens (the floral organs 
that contain microsporangia) of a flower. Stamens are not 
restricted to angiosperms, if they are defined in this gen- 
eral sense (Endress 2001b). However, angiosperm stamens 
have a thecal organization (Endress and Stumpf 1990) not 
present in other plant groups. Each stamen characteristi- 
cally has an anther with two lateral thecae often situated 
on a more or less elongate sterile part, the filament. Each 
theca is differentiated into a collateral pair of pollen sacs 
(microsporangia). At maturity, each theca opens by a longi- 
tudinal slit between the two pollen sacs. All major groups 
of angiosperms are characterized by this type of stamen 
structure (Fig. 14.11a). In only rare cases have some small 
angiosperm clades diverged from this pattern (Endress and 
Hufford 1989; Hufford and Endress 1989; Endress and 
Stumpf 1990). Diversity of anther shapes based on varia- 
tion of proportions of the basic pattern is also considerable 
(Bernhardt 1996; Endress 1996a) (Fig. 14.12).

Deviation from the basic anther pattern occurs in the 
opening mechanism and number of pollen sacs per stamen. 
In some groups (some Magnoliales, Laurales; basal eudi- 
cots [Trochodendraceae]; Saxifragales [Hamamelidaceae]; 
Endress and Hufford 1989; Hufford and Endress 1989), 
the longitudinal slit bifurcates at the ends, and each theca 
opens by two valves. There is a clear correlation between 
this form of dehiscence and the presence of a thick connec- 
tive. Such anthers are prone to lose one pollen sac per theca 
(some Laurales, some Hamamelidaceae). Loss of one pollen 
sac per theca also occurs in other eudicots, but there is no 
obvious phylogenetic pattern. Rather, a functional corre- 
lation can be seen, as this reduction occurs, for example, 
in some plants with cleistogamous flowers. The genetics of 
tetra- vs. disporangiate anthers in Microseris (Asteraceae) 
was studied by Gailing and Bachmann (2000). Increase in 
number of microsporangia also occurs in some groups but 
without a distinct phylogenetic pattern (Figs. 14.11b,c). 
The most extreme forms of stamens are those with a com- 
plete loss of thecal organization; an irregular number of 
microsporangia is present, and each opens by an individual 
pore or all converge to one apical pore (Fig. 14.11d,e). 
Such forms are known from three parasitic (but unrelated) 
families, Apodanthaceae, Rafflesiaceae, and Santalaceae, 
and from Polyporandra of Icacinaceae (Endress and Stumpf 
1990; Blarer et al. 2004; Nikolov et al. 2014), and perhaps 
Boschia and Cullenia of Malvaceae (Nyffeler and Baum 
2000). 
Stamen number is in general more diverse than numbers 
of the other three organs. In many groups with whorled 
floral phyllotaxis, stamens occur in two whorls (diplo- 
stemony), which results in a total of six stamens in many 
monocots and ten in many eudicots. A variant of diplo- 
stemony is obdiplostemony, in which the epipetalous (and

the stamens of a whorl—alternate with the epipetalous 
instead of the episepalous stamens. This is unexpected, as 
subsequent whorls of organs normally alternate with each 
other. The reason for this disturbance of normal alterna- 
tion is apparently that epipetalous stamens tend to be re- 
duced in size, so that the actual space for the carpels is 
larger between the epipetalous than between the episepal- 
ous stamens (Eckert 1965; Matthews and Endress 2002; 
Endress 2010b; Leins and Erbar 2010). Examples are many 
Geraniales and Oxalidales. 
In many taxa, the number of stamens per flower has 
increased even more. In flowers with a spiral phyllotaxis, 
high numbers of stamens are attained by an extended pe- 
riod of stamen formation following the ontogenetic spiral. 
In contrast, in flowers with a whorled phyllotaxis, stamen 
number may increase through an increase in whorl number, 
often with double positions, for example, in Papaveraceae 
(Endress 1987a), or an increase in the number of floral 
sectors, for example, in some Crassulaceae or Araliaceae 
(Nuraliev et al. 2014). A different mode of development 
is by the formation of primary primordia, on which many 
secondary primordia, each giving rise to a complete stamen, 

are formed. Such primary primordia may be > formed at the 
place where single stamens would be expected; they appear 
as several distinctive sectorial primordia or asa single ring 
primordium on which the individual stamen primordia are 
then not formed in whorls but in a less regular fashion. 
Notwithstanding the irregular stamen position, in androe- 
cia with primary and secondary primordia, centripetal 
and centrifugal patterns can be distinguished (Fig. 14.13, 
14.14a,b), which are often characteristic at the family level 
(Corner 1946). Centripetal stamen initiation occurs, for 
example, in Mimosoideae-Fabaceae (Gemmeke 1982), but 
centrifugal in Capparaceae (Leins and Metzenauer 1979; 
Ronse De Craene and Smets 1997), Dilleniaceae (Corner 
1946; Endress 1997a), and Lecythidaceae (Hirmer 1918; 
Endress 1994a). More rarely, the stamens appear to be ini- 
tiated almost simultaneously, as in Achariaceae (Bernhard 
and Endress 1999),

The centrifugal pattern is so unexpected that it has long 
been thought to characterize a major group of “dicots” (the 
dilleniids) (e.g., Cronquist 1957). However, phylogenetic 
studies have shown that centrifugal androecia evolved in 
very different clades of core eudicots. Thus, the pattern is 
of interest at a more shallow phylogenetic level than previ- 
ously thought (see also Endress and Matthews 2012). 
Stamens 
are typically free. However, synandry, the 
congenital union of stamens, occurs in many angiosperm 
groups. It is more prominent in unisexual than bisexual 
flowers because there is no gynoecium in the flower center, 
and thus the stamens may be united in a central structure 
that also involves the anthers (Fig. 14.15). Such extreme 
cases are present in Myristicaceae, Menispermaceae, Cu- 
curbitaceae, and Euphorbiaceae (in the latter three families 
only in a few taxa). Cases in which only the filaments are 
involved in stamen union are more common in bisexual 
flowers, for example, diagnostic for some Amaranthaceae, 
Malvaceae, and Meliaceae (von Balthazar et al. 2006; 
Janka et al. 2008). In some families the stamens tend to 
be united groupwise as several bundles (e.g., Clusiaceae, 
Hypericaceae, Myrtaceae) (Fig. 14.16). 
Gynoecium 
Gynoecia are exclusive and omnipresent in angiosperms. 
Carpels, the structural elements of a gynoecium, are cup- 
shaped or scale-shaped in early development and later be- 
come tubular (ascidiate) or folded (plicate). Intermediate 
forms between ascidiate and plicate are most common (En- 
dress and Igersheim 2000b; Endress and Doyle 2009). One 
to numerous ovules are formed near the margin of each car- 
pel. During development the ovule(s) become(s) completely

enclosed in the carpel in that the carpel flanks grow to- 
wards each other on top (in ascidiate carpels) or on the 
ventral side (in plicate carpels) and finally become sealed, 
so that the inner space with the ovule(s) is secluded from 
the outer world (angiospermy). Closure and “sealing” of 
the carpels is attained by secretion or by postgenital fusion. 
Endress and Igersheim (2000b) distinguished four types 
of angiospermy across the ANA grade, magnoliids, early- 
diverging eudicots, and early-diverging monocots: (1) clo- 
sure by secretion, without postgenital fusion, (2) closure by 
postgenital fusion at the periphery, but with a continuous 
secretory canal without fusion, (3) closure by postgenital 
fusion at the entire periphery and a secretory canal that 
stops below the stigma, and (4) closure by complete post- 
genital fusion, without a secretory canal (see Fig. 4.6). Post- 
genital fusion (epidermal fusion) comes about by intimate 

cuticular connection or by interdentation of epidermal cells 
and sometimes also division of epidermal Cells between 
two contiguous, coherent surfaces, with the result that the 
surfaces are no longer obvious (Sinha 2000). In the ANA 
grade, carpels are cup-shaped and sealed only by secretion 
(type 1); they have only one or a small number of carpels 
(Doyle and Endress 2000; Endress and Igersheim 2000b; 
Endress 2001a) (see also Chapter 4). In other angiosperm 
groups, carpel closure by partial or complete postgenital 
fusion is predominant (types 2-4) (Endress and Igersheim 
1999, 2000b; Igersheim et al. 2001). 
A major functional innovation of the advent of an- 
giospermy is pollination on the surface of the carpel (the 
stigma), no longer on the surface of the ovule (via the 
micropyle), and, concomitantly, the formation of a pollen 
tube transmitting tract (PTTT). The PTTT almost always 
differentiates along the primary morphological surface of 
the carpel (which, however, is hidden from the outer world 
because of carpel closure; Endress 1994a). Pollen grains 
are often deposited in groups on the stigma, and then mul- 
tiple pollen tubes grow synchronously along the PTTT. 
Consequently, the PTTT acts as an area where pollen tube 
(male gametophyte) competition and selection take place 
before fertilization (Mulcahy 1979; Mulcahy and Mulcahy 
1987). In some cases, competition and selection of female 
gametophytes may also occur (Bachelier and Friedman 
2011). Another innovation is that the stigma and PTTT 
act as sites where self-incompatibility reactions take place 
(Wheeler et al. 2001). Such prezygotic self-incompatibility 
is otherwise not well developed in non-angiosperm seed 
plants (Runions and Owens 1998). The speed of pollen 
tube growth increased in angiosperms compared to gymno- 
sperms and increased again in monocots and eudicots com- 
pared to the ANA grade and magnoliids (Williams 2008, 
2012). 
Syncarpy and Compitum 
Syncarpy is the congenital union of carpels. Two major 
aspects of syncarpy are (1) the extent of union, whether 
carpels are united only at the base or up to the top, with 
all possible transitions; and (2) the extent of union (conflu- 
ence) of the inner morphological surface of the carpels; if 
the inner morphological surfaces are confluent, formation 
of a unified PTTT of all carpels, termed a compitum, is 
possible (Carr and Carr 1961; Endress 1982). A compitum 
is the precondition for centralized pollen tube selection, 
which is hypothesized to be more efficient than individual 
selection in each carpel (Endress 1982; Armbruster et al. 
2002; X.-F Wang et al. 2012). 
The members of the ANA grade and magnoliids are 
largely apocarpous (Endress and Igersheim 2000b; Endress 
Floral Diversification 
361 
and Doyle 2009). In contrast, syncarpy is predominant in 
core eudicots and monocots. More than 80% of all angio- 
sperm species are syncarpous, with the remainder either 
apocarpous or unicarpellate (Endress 1982). It has yet to 
be determined in more detailed studies how common the 
presence of a compitum in syncarpous gynoecia is. How- 
ever, it seems to be the normal state in core eudicots and 
monocots (other than the early-diverging lineages, which 
are partly apocarpous, e.g., several families in Alismatales), 
although monocots appear to be originally syncarpous (En- 
dress and Doyle 2009; Doyle and Endress 2011; Sokoloff 
et al. 2013b). In some apocarpous Alismatales, an unusual 
compitum has evolved below the free carpels or by post- 
genital carpel fusion (Igersheim et al. 2001; X.-F. Wang 
et al. 2002, 2012; Endress 2011c). Postgenital fusion of 
free carpels (or carpels free in the upper region), and thus 
compitum formation without syncarpy, is also known from 
a number of eudicot families (e.g., Walker 1975; Endress 
et al. 1983; Fallen 1986; Matthews and Endress 2005b; El 
Ottra et al. 2013). 
Flowers with a syncarpous or unicarpellate gynoecium 
may exhibit an inferior ovary (Fig. 14.17), suggested to pro- 
vide better protection against certain pollinators with po- 
tentially destructive mouth parts, such as beetles and birds 
(Grant 1950). Inferior ovaries have evolved many times. 
They are more common in derived angiosperms, although 
they are also present in some basal groups (e.g., Chloran- 
thaceae, Gomortegaceae, Hernandiaceae) and are known 
since the Early Cretaceous (Friis et al. 1994b). In core eudi- 
cots and derived monocots, entire large clades may be char- 
acterized by inferior ovaries (e.g., Asterales, Dipsacales, 
Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, Zingiberales). Developmentally 
they arise by carpel initiation on a slightly concave floral 
apex and differential growth of the floral base including 
the gynoecium base, which results in a reinforcement of the 
concavity (cf. Endress 1994a). Evolutionary reversals in ex- 
ceptional cases are becoming increasingly known (see En- 
dress 2011b). Single genera with superior ovaries in these 
groups suggest such reversals, and the change from inferior 
to superior may even be seen during ontogeny, as in Gaert- 
nera (Rubiaceae; Igersheim et al. 1994). In Saxifragaceae, 
there is evolutionary oscillation between more superior 
and more inferior ovaries (Kuzoff et al. 1999; Soltis et al. 
2001a). 
Ovules 
Ovules are constituent parts of the carpels, although they 
appeared before the carpels in the evolutionary history of 
seed plants. Ovules consist of a nucellus (megasporangium) 
and, in angiosperms, basically two integuments. In the nu- 
cellus, meiosis takes place, and the embryo sac (megagame-

tophyte) develops, in which fertilization of the egg cell takes 
place. One or both integuments form a micropyle, a narrow 
canal through which a pollen tube is chemotactically at- 
tracted (Herrero 2001). The pollen tube grows through the 
micropyle, reaches the nucellus apex, which it penetrates, 
grows into the embryo sac, and releases the male gametes. 
One male gamete commonly fuses with the egg cell to give 
rise to a zygote, and the other with the (diploid) nucleus of 
the central cell to give rise to a (triploid) endosperm. 
Commonly, in angiosperms, crassinucellar (Fig. 14.18a) 
and tenuinucellar ovules (Fig. 14.18b) are distinguished. 
Tenuinucellar ovules are characterized by a single cell layer 
around the meiocyte in the nucellus, whereas in crassinu- 
cellar ovules there are two or more cell layers. The defini- 
tion of the former is clear, whereas the latter is everything 
else, and everything else is really not the same. Crassinu- 
cellar ovules are predominant in angiosperms but they are 
not uniform in structure, so they should not be considered 
a single character. However, it has long been known that 
some larger groups of angiosperms are characterized by 
tenuinucellar ovules. In addition, tenuinucellar ovules com- 
monly have only a single integument. The macrosystematic 
significance of this combination was emphasized by Philip- 
son (1977). Among monocots, the phylogenetic distribu- 
tion of these ovule types is less distinct (Rudall 1997). 
Based on the results of molecular systematic studies since 
the 1990s, the tenuinucellar ovule is characteristic of some 
large clades, especially the asterids (cf. Endress et al. 2000a; 
Albach et al. 2001c; Endress 2002a; see Chapter 11). Sev- 
eral families characterized by tenuinucellar ovules that 
were once classified in Rosidae, Dilleniidae, or Hamameli- 
dae (Cronquist 1981; Takhtajan 1997; see Chapter 3) have 
now been transferred to the asterids. However, tenuinucel- 
lar, unitegmic ovules, although predominant in asterids, 
cannot be considered a clear synapomorphy for asterids, 
because they do not occur in some early-branching clades 
(Endress et al. 2000a; Albach et al. 2001c; Endress 2002a, 
2011a; Endress and Rapini 2014). In Cornales, ovules are 
crassinucellar or tenuinucellar and unitegmic (Sat6 1976; 
Endress 2002a). In Ericales, ovules are tenuinucellar but 
fluctuate between bitegmic and unitegmic (Boesewinkel 
and Bouman 1991; Endress 2002a). In Garryales (with 
inclusion of part of Icacinaceae; Karehed 2001), ovules 
are commonly crassinucellar but mostly unitegmic (e.g., 
Eckardt 1963; Kapil and Mohana Rao 1966; Sat6 1976; 
Endress 2002a). There are also intermediate forms between 

crassinucellar and tenuinucellar, which may characterize 
families, for example, Convolvulaceae (see Endress 2002a). 
Endress 
(2011a) 
distinguished 
between 
tenuinucellar 
ovules (without any hypodermal tissue around the meio- 
cyte in the nucellus) and incompletely tenuinucellar ovules 
(with hypodermal tissue lacking at the apex, but present 
at the flanks and/or below the meiocyte in the nucellus). 
Tenuinucellar ovules in this narrower sense are more or less 
restricted to groups of euasterids (campanulids and lami- 
ids), whereas the “tenuinucellar” ovules in rosids and basal 
asterids are commonly incompletely tenuinucellar (Endress 
2011a) (Fig. 14.19). 
Tenuinucellar ovules are smaller than crassinucellar 
ovules, and thus the potential for flexibility in ovule num- 
ber (between one and exceedingly many) per carpel is 
higher. The largest number of ovules per ovary occurs in 
some Orchidaceae, which have tenuinucellar ovules (over 
half a million in Coryanthes; see Nazarov and Gerlach 
1997). In asterids with tenuinucellar ovules, some families, 
such as Solanaceae and Rubiaceae, also have clades with

high ovule numbers. However, ovule number is a poorly 
explored character in these groups. 
MORPHOLOGICAL ELABORATIONS 
IN FLOWERS POLLINATED 
BY ANIMALS 
Many elaborations are based on synorganization of organs. 
An especially successful elaboration (innovation) was the 
evolution of sympetaly (see above), which allowed the easy 
building of different floral architectures (e.g., lipped flow- 
ers, tubular flowers of various lengths and widths, e.g., in 
Gentianales, Lamiales) and specialization for a variety of 
pollinators (e.g., bees, butterflies, sphingids, birds, bats) 
(e.g., Vogel 1990). Another example is the evolution of 
revolver flowers—that is, flowers that have several canals 
to reach the nectar, on which pollinators have to rotate 
around the center of the flower to gather all available nec- 
tar. This increases body contact with the anthers and stigma

and thus may enhance pollination success. Such flowers are 
common in Gentianales and Solanaceae (Endress 1994a). 
Another principle is portioning of the pollen produced 
in a flower (or anther), resulting in staggered pollen presen- 
tation (Leins 2000). This is achieved by various means—for 
example, by elaborate secondary pollen presentation, as in 
Asterales (Leins and Erbar 1990; Erbar and Leins 1995b) 
or Fabales (Westerkamp and Weber 1999). In flowers with 
secondary pollen presentation, pollen transfer to the pol- 
linators is not directly from the anthers, but rather pollen is 
first deposited on the style or in the tip of a keel before it is 
removed by pollinators. Secondary pollen presentation has 
evolved in many clades of angiosperms (Yeo 1992), some 
of which are species-rich, such as Asteraceae and Fabaceae. 
Pollen portioning is also found in flowers with poricidal 
anthers, which are buzz-pollinated by bees (see below). 
Pollination by pollinia has been successful in orchids and 
asclepiads (Pacini and Hesse 2002). Here, the entire pollen 
mass of a theca is transported as a solid parcel (pollinium), 
and thus no pollen is lost on the way from one flower to 
the next. In some subgroups of both orchids and asclepi- 
ads, pollen portioning is also attained by the formation of 
smaller units, such as tetrads or massulae instead of entire 
pollinia. 
The evolution of monosymmetric flowers allowed en- 
hanced precise mechanisms of pollen application to the 
body of a pollinator and subsequently to the stigma of a 
flower. This also led to a greater potential for diversifica- 
tion in pollination biology. Some large, successful clades 
have evolved monosymmetric flowers, such as Orchida- 
ceae, Zingiberales, Fabales, and Lamiales (Endress 1999). 
Various means of pollinator attraction, in addition to 
pollen, have evolved in flowers, such as nectar, oil, resin, 
and perfume, which are used for food, nest building, or 
attraction of mates. Whereas pollen and nectar are used 
by many pollinators, oil, resin, and perfume are used by 
some highly specialized bees (Vogel 1974, 1988; Simpson 
and Neff 1981; Steiner 1991). Some flowers pollinated 
by certain bees that collect pollen by “buzzing”—that is, 
by activity of flight muscles—have attained a “solanoid” 
overall shape, that is, they have a flat, expanded corolla, a 
cone-shaped androecium with large, showy, poricidal an- 
thers and short filaments, and a punctiform stigma (Vogel 
1978; Vaknin et al. 2001). Such flowers are known from 
many families of eudicots and monocots. In flowers that 
offer only pollen as a reward to pollinators, there is also an 
evolutionary trend to diversify stamen structure and func- 
tion into showy “feeding stamens” and cryptic “pollinating 
stamens” (heteranthery), and in some cases even the pollen 
becomes different in the two stamen morphs (Vogel 1978; 
Endress 1997a; Barrett 2010a). Arrangement, size, shape, 
color, and scent of flowers are means of differential attrac- 
tion of pollinators and a source for reproductive isolation, 
speciation, and thus diversification (Waser 1998; Chittka 
et al. 1999; Lunau 2000; Chittka and Thomson 2001; 
Prusinkiewicz et al. 2007). 
A considerable repertoire of mating systems, apart from 
specialization to different pollinators, also plays a role in 
floral diversification, such as various kinds of gender distri- 
bution, self-incompatibility, self-compatibility, dichogamy, 
and herkogamy (e.g., Bertin and Newman 1993; Barrett 
1995, 1998, 2002, 2003; Barrett et al. 1996, 2000; Hols- 
inger 1996; Richards 1997; Harder and Barrett 2006). 
These specializations involve a number of ways to enhance 
outbreeding or keep a balance between outbreeding and 
inbreeding (Lloyd and Schoen 1992; Freeman et al. 1997; 
Schoen et al. 1997). Monoecy and dioecy are different 
ways of separating genders on one or on separate individu- 
als (e.g., Renner and Won 2001). Dioecy seems to evolve 
commonly from monoecy (Renner and Ricklefs 1995; 
Sakai and Weller 1999; Weller and Sakai 1999; but see also 
Spigler and Ashman 2012). In dichogamy, both genders 
are produced by the same individual but not at the same 
time; both genders can be present in the same flowers (bi- 
sexual flowers) or in separate flowers (unisexual flowers); 
both protogyny (with the female function working first) 
and protandry (with the male function working first) oc- 
cur (Lloyd and Webb 1986; Renner 2001). In herkogamy, 
both genders are produced by the same individual and at 
the same time but spatially separated on the same plant 
(Webb and Lloyd 1986). A special case of herkogamy is 
heterostyly, in which different floral morphs with long and 
short stamens or styles are produced on separate individu- 
als (Barrett 1992). Commonly, these sexual system variants 
are flexible at relatively shallow levels of the phylogenetic 
hierarchy (Korpelainen 1998), but protogyny (in perfect 
flowers) is extensive in the ANA grade and magnoliids (En- 
dress 1990b, 2001c, 2010b). 
MORPHOLOGICAL REDUCTION 
IN FLOWERS THAT ARE NOT 
ANIMAL-POLLINATED 
In some angiosperm groups, wind pollination is predomi- 
nant, and flowers are concomitantly greatly altered in struc- 
ture and behavior as compared to those of their animal- 
pollinated ancestors. The main trend is floral reductions 
of various sorts, but this is accompanied by an increase in 
pollen production (Wagenitz 1975), including increased 
pollen-to-ovule ratio (Friedman and Barrett 2009), which 
may lead to drastic changes in flower appearance. Major

wind-pollinated groups are Fagales and many Rosales 
(the urticoid families) among eudicots, and several Poales 
among monocots, grasses and sedges being the most prom- 
inent (Linder 1998). Wind pollination has also evolved 
in many smaller groups that are phylogenetically nested 
in larger animal-pollinated groups, such as single genera 
(e.g., Dodonaea in Sapindaceae, Ambrosia in Asteraceae, 
Plantago in Plantaginaceae, Preston et al. 2011) or single 
species. In Acer negundo (Fig. 14. 20b), in contrast to the 
insect-pollinated Acer platanoides (Fig. 14.20a), the flow- 
ers are unisexual, petals and nectary are lacking, and the 
stigma is much larger, thus providing a dramatic change 
in the superficial appearance. Water pollination is much 
less prominent in angiosperms, but it has evolved in several 
groups (Philbrick and Les 1996) and is also accompanied 
by floral reduction, in some groups extremely so (some gen- 
era of Hydrocharitaceae and other small families of Alis- 
matales, Callitriche of Plantaginaceae) (Cook 1982). 
In Fagales, which are predominantly wind-pollinated, a 
suite of traits, not only in floral morphology at anthesis 
but also in floral development before and after anthesis, is 
apparently functionally related to wind pollination. These 
traits include flowering early in the growing season, in the 
leafless state, and immaturity of the ovary and ovules at an- 
thesis with the effect that pollination may precede fertiliza- 
tion by months. In extreme cases (e.g., Corylus), ovules are 
not even present at the time of pollination (Endress 1977; 
Thompson 1979), but this post-pollination delay in ovule 
formation can also occur in insect-pollinated groups, such 
as Orchidaceae. Whether wind pollination evolved within 
Fagales or their ancestors and how many reversals to in- 
sect pollination there were in Fagales is not clear (Manos 
et al. 2001). 
EVOLUTIONARY INNOVATIONS 
AND DIVERSIFICATION IN 
FLOWERS OF THE MAJOR 
ANGIOSPERM GROUPS 
Evolutionary innovations or idiosyncrasies in flowers often 
characterize large angiosperm clades (Fig. 14.21). In many 
basal angiosperms, including Magnoliales and Laurales, flo- 
ral phyllotaxis is diverse and flexible, and the spiral pattern is 
not suppressed because synorganizations are largely lacking 
(Endress 1987a). Floral merism is also highly variable. The 
perianth is not clearly differentiated into sepals and petals, 
and sometimes it is even absent (see also Chapters 4-6). Sta- 
mens are often massive, with short filaments, thick connec- 
tives, and frequently valvate dehiscence. Uniaperturate pollen 
is predominant. The gynoecium is often apocarpous. Ovules 
are crassinucellar, bitegmic, and commonly anatropous. 
In some species of the ANA grade, flowers are small 
(except for some more specialized taxa: Austrobaileyaceae, 
Nymphaeaceae); floral phyllotaxis is spiral (Amborellaceae, 
Austrobaileyales) or whorled (Nymphaeales). The perianth 
is not clearly differentiated into sepals and petals. Stamens 
open with longitudinal slits (not with valves; except for 
Nuphar, Nymphaeaceae; Hufford 1996a). Carpel closure 
(angiospermy) is not by postgenital fusion but by secretion 
(except Illiciaceae, Nymphaeaceae) (Doyle and Endress 
2000, 2011; Endress and Igersheim 2000b; Endress 2001c; 
Endress and Doyle 2007, 2009). 
In magnoliids, many floral features are similar to those 
in the ANA grade. However, stamens opening by valves, 
concomitant with a thick connective, is common (Magnoli- 
ales, Laurales), angiospermy is often by postgenital fusion, 
and floral trimery is widespread.

Innovations in flower evolution of angiosperms. Fourteen innovations are mentioned, most of them innovations in more than one clade. Probable 
key innovations are marked with a short line on the respective clades. Non-key innovations are marked without a short line. Cladogram of angiosperms from APG III 
(2009). (Modified from Endress 2011¢, p. 371.) 

In monocots, flowers are almost always trimerous, ex- 
cept in Pandanales in which dimery, tetramery, pentamery, 
and polymery also occur. There 
is a tendency for intimate 
connections of organs of different kinds within the same 
floral radius (Endress 1995a; Remizowa et al. 2010). The 
perianth is not always clearly differentiated into sepals and 
petals. One of the three outer perianth organs is often an- 
terior in the median plane of the flower (Remizowa et al. 
2013). Pollen is uniaperturate, as in the early-diverging 
angiosperms. Nectaries are present in the septa of carpels 
(septal nectaries) or on the tepal surface (tepal nectaries). 
Nectaries are lacking in some large groups (e.g., Poales). 
Often, floral bracts or inflorescence bracts are elaborated 
and play important roles as protective organs for flowers 
or entire inflorescences (e.g., Poaceae and Arecaceae) and/ 
or as attractive organs for pollinators (e.g., Araceae, Bro- 
meliaceae, Arecaceae, Pandanaceae, Zingiberales) (Endress 
199 Sa). 
In eudicots, floral phyllotaxis is commonly whorled, ex- 
cept for some Ranunculales and Nelumbonaceae (Hiepko 
1965b; Endress and Doyle 2007; Endress 2010b,c). Flow- 
ers are often pentamerous, except for clades at the basal 
nodes. Perianths have sepals and petals in core eudicots 
and many Ranunculales. Stamens commonly have long fila- 
ments and anthers with thin connectives, each theca open- 
ing by a longitudinal slit. Eudicots are characterized by the 
presence of tricolpate or tricolpate-derived pollen (Doyle 
and Hotton 1991); an alternative name for the eudicots is 
tricolpates. 
Early-diverging eudicots are labile in floral construc- 
tion (see also Chapter 8). Spiral and whorled floral phyl- 
lotaxis occur side by side, sometimes in the same genus 
but more often among genera and families. Flowers with 
spirally arranged organs occur in many Ranunculaceae 
(Schoffel 1932; Hiepko 1965b), some Menispermaceae 
(Endress 1995b), Circaeasteraceae (Ren et al. 2004; Tian 
et al. 2006), Nelumbo (perianth) (Hayes et al. 2000), and 
sometimes Trochodendraceae (Trochodendron is spiral and 
whorled) (Endress 1990a). In taxa with spiral floral phyl- 
lotaxis, floral organ number is highly variable; in taxa with 
whorled flowers, di- and trimerous flowers predominate 
(Ranunculales, Proteaceae, Platanaceae, Buxaceae, Tetra- 
centron, Myrothamnus) (Drinnan et al. 1994; Chen et al. 
2007; von Balthazar and Schonenberger 2009; Endress 
2010a). In some groups, thecae open by valves and not by 
longitudinal slits (a few Ranunculaceae, Eupteleaceae, Plat- 
anaceae, Trochodendraceae). Pollen is often tricolpate, or 
tricolporate in some (e.g., some Menispermaceae; Thani- 
kaimoni 1984). Disk nectaries are lacking except for Buxa- 
ceae and Sabiaceae (von Balthazar and Endress 2002b); 
nectaries are present on petals or staminodes or are lacking. 
Ovules are mostly crassinucellar and bitegmic (but pseudo- 
Floral Diversification 
367 
crassinucellar in Papaveraceae and Ranunculaceae, cf. En- 
dress and Igersheim 1999). 
In core eudicots, flowers are predominantly pentamer- 
ous or pentamerous-derived. Increase in stamen number, 
based on secondary stamen primordia superimposed upon 
the primary primordia, has occurred in several families. 
Pollen is mostly tricolporate or tricolporate-derived. Disk 
nectaries are common. 
In rosids, flowers are almost always choripetalous. Ovules 
are mostly crassinucellar and bitegmic. In many groups, sec- 
ondary increase in stamen number is common. Many floral 
details in rosid clades are poorly known, but comparative 
studies of several larger clades of rosids sensu APG have been 
carried out in the past 15 years (e.g., Ronse De Craene and 
Smets 1999; Matthews et al. 2001, 2012; Ronse De Craene 
et al. 2001; Schonenberger et al. 2001a; Matthews and En- 
dress 2002, 2004, 2005a,b, 2008, 2011; Endress et al. 2013). 
In asterids, flowers are almost always sympetalous, and, 
in many groups, stamens are also fused with the sympetal- 
ous corolla. At least in some derived asterids (Gentianales, 
Lamiales, Asterales, Dipsacales), stamens are in a single 
whorl. Carpels are commonly reduced to two (or three). 
Ovules are incompletely tenuinucellar or tenuinucellar and 
unitegmic. The great diversity in floral forms among aste- 
rids is mainly based on variation in the sympetalous co- 
rolla and the often monosymmetric flowers. More recent 
comparative structural studies on larger clades of asterids 
are by Schonenberger et al. (2010) and von Balthazar and 
Schonenberger (2013). 
FLORAL DEVELOPMENTAL GENETICS 
The vast diversity of floral forms reflects the interplay of 
underlying genetic programs that control elements of or- 
ganization, construction, and mode. Here we review cur- 
rent understanding of the genetic underpinnings of these 
components of floral variation, emphasizing floral organ 
specification and number (organization), symmetry (con- 
struction), and color (mode). The most obvious shifts in 
floral morphology seem to be controlled by variation in 
expression of transcription factors, which may then trigger 
complex downstream cascades of genes that encode more 
specific attributes of floral features. 
ORGANIZATION: PRESENCE AND 
DISPOSITION OF FLORAL ORGANS 
(FLORAL ORGAN IDENTITY) 
Broad contributions from paleobotany, phylogenetics, ge- 
nomics, developmental biology, and developmental genetics 

368 Chapter 14 
have yielded tremendous insight into Darwin’s “abomina- 
ble mystery” (see Friedman 2009)—the origin and rapid di- 
versification of the angiosperms soon after their origin (see 
also reviews by P. Soltis et al. 2006, 2009; Soltis et al. 2007, 
2008b). Much of floral diversity results from variation in 
the types and numbers of organs composing a flower: for 
example, tepals vs. sepals and petals, and indeterminate vs. 
fixed numbers of organs. 
Whereas the central feature of the angiosperms is the 
flower, the origin of this complex structure and its sub- 
sequent diversification throughout angiosperm evolution 
still remain fundamental evolutionary questions. The past 
25 years have seen tremendous new developments in our 
understanding of the genes involved in the making of a 
flower. Over that time, the well-known ABC model (now 
often referred to as the ABCE model, below; Fig. 14.22) 
of floral organ identity has been the unifying paradigm 
for floral developmental genetics (Coen and Meyerowitz 
1991). This model proposed that floral organ identity is 
controlled by three major gene functions, A, B, and C, that 
act in combination to produce the floral organs; A-function 
alone specifies sepal identity, A- and B-functions together 
control petal identity; B- and C-functions together control 
stamen identity; C-function alone specifies carpel identity 
(Fig. 14.22). 
Several genes act as key regulators of floral organ iden- 
tity in model eudicots, such as Arabidopsis thaliana (Bras- 
sicaceae) and Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae; snap- 
dragon). In Arabidopsis, APETALA1 (AP1) and AP2 are 
the A-function genes, AP3 and PISTILLATA (PI) are the 
B-function genes, and AGAMOUS (AG) is the C-function 
gene. In Antirrhinum, the homologous gene (or homolog) to 
AP1 is SOQUAMOSA. Details regarding A-function remain 
complex, however, with A-function not clearly documented 
except in Arabidopsis. The homologs of the A-function 
gene AP2 in Antirrhinum are LIPLESS1 and LIPLESS2, 
which may provide partial A-function 
in snapdragon 
(Keck et al. 2003). The B-function genes in Antirrhinum 
are DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO), which 
are homologs of AP3 and PI, respectively. The C-function 
gene in Antirrhinum is PLENA (PLE). All these genes, with 
the exception of AP2 (and its homologs), are MADS-box 
genes (Theissen et al. 2000), a broad family of eukaryotic 
genes that encode transcription factors containing a highly 
conserved DNA-binding domain (MADS domain). 
Extensions to the original ABC model accommodated 
subsequent discoveries, including the identification 
of 
additional MADS-box 
genes 
that control 
ovule iden- 
tity (D-function; Colombo et al. 1995) and those that 
also contribute to sepal, petal, stamen, and carpel iden- 
tity (E-function; Pelaz et al. 2000). We will not consider 
D-function further here, given that ovules are part of the 
carpels and not floral organs per se. However, E-function 
plays a major role in the formation of floral organs and 
is closely integrated with ABC functions. The E-function 
genes in Arabidopsis are SEPALLATAI (SEP1), 2, 3, and 
4 (Pelaz et al. 2000). SEP proteins, together with the pro- 
tein products of the ABC genes, are required to specify flo- 
ral organ identity. The SEP genes are functionally redun- 
dant in their control of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels 
(Fig. 14.22). Given the important role of E-function in or- 
gan specification, ABCE is a more appropriate name for 
the general model of floral organ identity than simply ABC. 
Despite its joint derivation from phylogenetically di- 
vergent species (Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum 
majus; Bowman et al. 1989; Schwarz-Sommer et al. 1990; 
Coen and Meyerowitz 1991; Davies et al. 2006), the ABCE 
model is nonetheless based on phylogenetically derived eu- 
dicot model systems (D. Soltis et al. 2002a; P. Soltis et al. 
2006). Data from additional eudicots, including Petunia 
(reviewed in Rijpkema et al. 2006) and Gerbera (reviewed 
in Teeri et al. 2006), complemented the data for Arabi- 
dopsis and Antirrhinum. Expression patterns of MADS- 
box genes in eudicots as well as grasses typically support 
the ABCE model. In particular, early studies revealed that 
strong expression of AP3 and PI homologs in eudicots is 
typically limited to petals and stamens, where these genes 
are required for organ identity specification (Ma and de- 
Pamphilis 2000). However, over the past decade, it has 
become clear that the ABCE model developed in eudicot 
model plants does not apply to early-diverging angiosperm 
groups. Data produced in large part by the Floral Genome 
Project (D. Soltis et al. 2002a, 2007a; Albert et al. 2005; 
Kim et al. 2005; P. Soltis et al. 2006) provided some of the 
first crucial insights into the floral organ identity genes and 
their patterns of expression in several species of basal an- 
giosperms (reviewed in P. Soltis et al. 2006; D. Soltis et al. 
2007 a). 
Is the ABCE model applicable to basal angiosperms and 
thereby relevant to the origin and early evolution of the 
flower? As reviewed below (see also D. Soltis et al. 2002a, 
2007a; Albert et al. 2005; P. Soltis et al. 2006, 2009), the 
answer is yes and no. The expression of MADS-box genes 
in the floral organs of basal angiosperms is generally con- 
sistent with the ABCE model. Importantly, however, the 
expression patterns in basal angiosperms are often broader 
than those in eudicot flowers. The floral morphology of 
many basal angiosperms provides a crucial hint to what 
may be a more appropriate model for these plants. In Am- 
borella and some other basal angiosperms, floral organs are 
spirally arranged with a gradual transition from bracts to 
outer and inner tepals, from tepals to stamens, and finally 
to carpels (see Chapter 4). These gradual intergradations 
of floral organs cannot be easily explained by the classic

A. ABCE Model of floral organ identity. Sepals are produced where A function acts alone, petals where A and B functions overlap, stamens where B 
and C functions combine, and carpels where C function acts alone. In the eudicot genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, APETALA1 (AP1) and APETALA2 (AP2) 
are the A-function genes, APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI) together specify B function, C function is specified by AGAMOUS (AG), and multiple SEPALLATA 
genes provide E function. (Modified from Chanderbali et al. 2010.) B. Fading borders model for floral organ identity. Unlike the classic ABCE model where there is 
a sharp boundary between gene expression corresponding to floral organs, in the fading borders model there is a gradual transition of gene function across floral 
organs. (Courtesy of A. Chanderbali.) 

370 Chapter 14 
ABCE model as proposed for eudicots in which there are 
sharp boundaries between floral organs. 
Developmental genetics studies conducted 
for basal 
angiosperms indicate a broader pattern of expression of 
B- (and to a lesser extent, C- and E-) function homologs 
in basal angiosperms than in eudicots (Kim et al. 2005). 
These results prompted the formulation of the fading bor- 
ders model (Buzgo et al. 2004a, 2005) (Fig. 14.22b), which 
proposes that the gradual transitions in floral organ mor- 
phology result from a gradient in the level of expression 
of floral organ identity genes across the developing floral 
meristem. Weak expression at the margin of a gene’s range 
of “activity” overlapping with the expression of another 
regulator in adjacent cells results in the formation of mor- 
phologically intermediate floral organs rather than organs 
that are clearly distinct. 
Homologs of B-function genes, AP3 and PI, are broadly 
expressed in tepals, stamens, and carpels in the ANA grade 
of angiosperms, including Amborella (Amborellales), wa- 
ter lilies (Nymphaeales), and Illicium (Austrobaileyales), 
as well as in magnoliids (e.g., Magnolia) (Kim et al. 2005; 
Fig. 14.23). Additional support for fading borders was 
provided at a transcriptome-wide level (Chanderbali et al. 
2010; see below and Fig. 14.24). 
The ABCE model as developed for eudicots is therefore 
not perfectly applicable to basal angiosperms and, by infer- 
ence, the earliest angiosperms. The ABCE model of floral 
organ identity is typically considered the default program, 
with variants viewed as derivatives of this program. In fact, 
however, when gene expression profiles of floral-organ 
regulators are compared in a phylogenetic context, it is 
clear that the ABC model of Arabidopsis is evolutionarily 
derived. The ancestral flower had broad expression pat- 
terns of at least B-function regulators; broad and overlap- 
ping expression yielded morphologically intergrading floral 
organs, as seen in a number of extant basal angiosperms. 
Restriction of expression (and function) to specific regions 
of the floral meristem resulted in the discrete whorls of 
morphologically distinct floral organs that together char- 
acterize most of the eudicots and certainly all of the core 
eudicots. Further investigation of the evolution of the floral 
regulatory network should rely on the phylogenetic per- 
spective that the ABCE model is derived. 
But how was the genetic machinery necessary for speci- 
fying a flower assembled in the first place? Were the genes 
co-opted from other processes and integrated into a path- 
way gradually, or were they brought together more sud- 
denly, perhaps through gene or whole-genome duplication? 
Parallel duplications of floral regulatory genes, consistent 
with evidence from broad-scale genomic analyses (Jiao 
et al. 2011, 2012), suggest whole-genome duplications in 
the common ancestor of extant angiosperms and the com- 
mon ancestor of core eudicots. However, the mere duplica- 
tion of a genome or set of genes was likely not coincident 
with the origin of morphological novelty. Certainly some 
time would have been needed for the assembly of a func- 
tional floral-organ specification program in the ancestral 
angiosperm. Furthermore, the duplication of the B-function 
homologs (AP3 and PI) apparently occurred approxi- 
mately 260 mya, 130 myr before the first fossil evidence 
of angiosperms. The process of assembling a new genetic 
program and its translation into morphological innovation 
merits further study. 
Studies of floral developmental genetics have also pro- 
vided additional insights into the evolution of the perianth. 
The traditional view of angiosperm flower evolution main- 
tains that stamens and carpels evolved just once, whereas 
the sterile perianth organs may have arisen multiple times 
(e.g., Eames 1961; Takhtajan 1991). The rationale for this 
evolutionary reasoning is based on the longstanding view 
that angiosperms are derived from ancestors without petals, 
making the perianth an evolutionary novelty. The strong 
resemblance in some groups of sepals to foliar bracts and 
the similarity of petals to stamens has supported the view 
that sepals are derived from foliar bracts whereas petals are 
derived from stamens. Those petals that are stamen-derived 
(called andropetals by Takhtajan 1991) are primarily as- 
sociated with what we now term eudicots. In contrast, the 
perianth of basal angiosperms often comprises morpholog- 
ically similar organs, termed tepals (Endress 2001a)—these 
~ 
tepaloid organs could be assigned bracteal (bracteopetal) 
or staminal (andropetal) origins depending on whether 
sepal-like or petal-like features prevail. 
Following these criteria, the tepals of Lauraceae have 
been considered bracteopetals (Albert et al. 1998; Ronse 
De Craene et al. 2003), but expression data for Persea 
(based on RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and microarrays), 
coupled with developmental data, indicate that the “petals” 
of Persea and other Lauraceae are clearly of staminal origin 
(Chanderbali et al. 2006, 2009). Global patterns of gene 
expression in three phylogenetically pivotal angiosperms, 
a water lily (Nuphar advena), avocado (Persea americana, 
a magnoliid), and California poppy (Eschscholzia califor- 
nica, a basal eudicot), along with the model core eudicot 
Arabidopsis thaliana and a cycad (Zamia vazquezii), sup- 
port the fading borders model (Chanderbali et al. 2010). 
Transcriptional cascades exhibit broadly overlapping pat- 
terns of spatial gene expression deployed across the mor- 
phologically similar and intergrading floral organs typical 
of both water lily and avocado flowers (Fig. 14.24). In con- 
trast to the patterns in these basal angiosperms, in both the 
basal eudicot California poppy and derived core eudicot 
Arabidopsis, spatially discrete transcriptional programs 
were observed in the morphologically distinct floral organs.

In addition, deep evolutionary conservation in the genetic 
programs of putatively homologous floral organs appears 
to trace to those operating in gymnosperm reproductive 
cones. For example, angiosperm carpels and female cycad 
cones share conserved genetic features that are associated 
with the ovule developmental program common to both 
organs. In contrast, male cones of gymnosperms share tran- 
scriptomic features with both the angiosperm perianth and 
stamens. These results therefore support the evolutionary 
origin of the perianth of angiosperms from the male genetic 
program of other seed plants.

in Asteropeiaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Stegnospermataceae, 
Limeaceae, Lophiocarpaceae, Aizoaceae, Nyctaginaceae, 
Molluginaceae, and Portulacineae 
(Brockington 
et 
al. 
2009). Perianth differentiation has been achieved by dif- 
ferent mechanisms in these nine lineages, through either 
petaloid differentiation of the ancestral uniseriate perianth 
or the recruitment of other floral structures, either the an- 
droecium or the preceding bracts (Brockington et al. 2009). 
These separate origins of differentiated perianth, with the 
concomitant evolution of petaloidy from either androecial 
or bracteal organs, make Caryophyllales a valuable system 
to address the evolutionary developmental genetics of pet- 
aloidy, particularly the role of the canonical eudicot petal 
identity program in recurrent petal evolution (Brockington 
et al..2011). 
Perianth differentiation through sterilization and petal- 
oid modification of the outer members of a centrifugally 
initiating androecium has arisen a minimum of four times 
in Caryophyllales, in Aizoaceae, Molluginaceae, Lophio- 
carpaceae, and Limeaceae. In these instances, androecial 
development proceeds centrifugally, and the basipetal 
members become progressively more sterile and petaloid 
Floral Diversification

(Brockington et al. 2009). Aizoaceae comprise four sub- 
families, with Sesuvioideae and Aizooideae as successive 
sisters to Mesembryanthemoideae plus Ruschioideae (Klak 
et al. 2003). Sesuvioideae and Aizooideae exhibit an undif- 
ferentiated perianth comprising a single whorl of five tepals 
(Fig. 14.25), which are petaloid on their adaxial surfaces 
and sepaloid on their abaxial surfaces. In contrast, Mesem- 
bryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae display a differenti- 
ated perianth with an outer whorl of sepals (homologous 
to the petaloid tepals of Sesuvioideae/Aizooideae) and an 
inner whorl of putative andropetals. Therefore, a transfer 
of function has occurred from the adaxial tepal surface of 
Sesuvioideae and Aizooideae to the andropetals of Me- 
sembryanthemoideae and Ruschioideae. Brockington et al. 
(2011) examined these differently derived petaloid organs 
for evidence of a shared core eudicot petal identity pro- 
gram, by isolating AP3, PI, and AG homologs from all four 
subfamilies and observing in situ expression patterns of 
these genes in two species representing the two distinct flo- 
ral types, Sesuvium portulacastrum (Sesuvioideae: petaloid 
tepals) and Delosperma napiforme (Ruschioideae: petaloid 
staminodes).

374 Chapter 14 
Given the concept of a conserved petal identity program 
within core eudicots, and a hypothesis of heterotopy in 
petal evolution, it might be expected that there would be 
similarities in MADS-box gene expression between petal- 
oid tepals and petaloid stamens in members of Aizoaceae. 
Specifically, an evolutionary extension of the ABCE model 
predicts that AP3 and PI homologs should be required 
for petal identity and be expressed throughout the devel- 
opment of the petaloid organ (Brockington et al. 2011). 
Contrary to this expectation, the homologs of AP3 and PI 
are not expressed at any point in the development of the 
petaloid tepals in Aizoaceae, while the homologs AP3 and 
Pl] are only transiently expressed in the petaloid staminodes 
in Aizoaceae. Similarly, the AG homolog is not expressed 
in petaloid tepals, but is transiently expressed in petaloid 
staminodes. Therefore, at the level of AP3, PI, and AG ho- 
molog gene expression, Brockington et al. (2011) found no 
evidence for homology between the petaloid tepals and pet- 
aloid staminodes of S. portulacastrum and D. napiforme. 
Significantly, neither petal class exhibits gene expression 
patterns consistent with the classic core eudicot petal iden- 
tity program. Thus, Brockington et al. (2011) provide evi- 
dence for core eudicot petal development that is indepen- 
dent of the AP3 and PI lineage of MADS-box genes and 
suggest that even within the core eudicots, different genetic 
control of petal identity has evolved within Caryophylla- 
les in the context of its unusual floral evolutionary history 
(Fig. 14.25). 
CONSTRUCTION: SHAPE AND 
PEORAL SYMMETRY 
A major determinant of floral shape is symmetry, although 
additional factors, such as cell size and elongation, contrib- 
ute to differences between actinomorphic bowl-shaped and 
tubular flowers. Because actinomorphy vs. zygomorphy 
represents a major dichotomy in floral morphology—and 
because relatively little is known about factors that influ- 
ence other attributes of floral shape—we will confine our 
review here to symmetry. 
The role of floral symmetry in angiosperm evolution has 
long been of interest to evolutionary biologists and system- 
atists in large part due to its impact on plant-pollinator in- 
teractions (see Endress 2012). Here we consider the under- 
lying developmental genetics of floral symmetry, addressing 
actinomorphy (radial symmetry, polysymmetry) and zygo- 
morphy (bilateral symmetry, monosymmetry), with a fo- 
cus on the underlying developmental genetics. Actinomor- 
phy is considered the ancestral condition for flowering 
plants (e.g., Cronquist 1981). Not only is radial symmetry 
prevalent in extant basal angiosperm lineages (see Chap- 
ters 4 and 5), but this condition is also present in the earli- 
est fossils (Dilcher 2000). In contrast, bilateral symmetry 
appears later in multiple fossils during the Paleocene and 
Eocene (Dilcher 2000) and is reconstructed as derived in 
phylogenetic reconstructions (e.g., Ronse De Craene et al. 
2003; Soltis et al. 2005b). 
Bilateral symmetry is widespread in the angiosperms, 
with reports from at least 38 families (Westerkamp et al. 
2007) or more than 200 families, if bilateral symmetry by 
reduction is included (Endress 2012), and has evolved mul- 
tiple times during angiosperm evolution, as long noted by 
taxonomists and as reconstructed on the backbone phy- 
logeny of Soltis et al. (2011) (Hileman 2014a and redrawn 
as Fig. 14.26). For many lineages with bilateral symme- 
try, the same gene (CYCLOIDEA) has been implicated as 
the underlying genetic mechanism (see below). However, 
the actual number of transitions to bilateral symmetry is 
much higher than is apparent from a simple summary tree 
of angiosperms. For example, Citerne et al. (2010) found 
evidence for at least 70 transitions to bilateral symmetry 
(reviewed in Hileman 2014a): one event in basal angio- 
sperms, 23 in monocots, and 46 in the eudicots. More de- 
tailed studies of the transitions to zygomorphy have also 
been conducted within individual angiosperm subclades. 
For example, Donoghue et al. (1998) found evidence for 
multiple transitions to zygomorphy as well as a reversal to 
actinomorphy in asterids. Floral symmetry across Lamiales 
(analyzed at the family level) involves one change from ra- 
dial to bilateral symmetry, as well as one reversal back to 
radial symmetry (Schaferhoff et al. 2010). 
Shifts to bilateral symmetry have resulted in increased 
diversification of angiosperms. In 15 of 19 comparisons 
of large sister groups (clades recognized as families) hav- 
ing radial and bilateral symmetry, the clades with bilateral 
symmetry are more species-rich than their sisters with ra- 
dial symmetry (Sargent 2004). This difference is attributed 
to differences in pollination, with zygomorphy increasing 
pollinator specificity, thus ultimately promoting reproduc- 
tive isolation. Sargent’s (2004) results support longstanding 
views on the role of floral variation in angiosperm specia- 
tion and diversification. 
Developmental Genetics of Floral Symmetry 
The genetic control of floral symmetry has been investigated 
in a number of species, with the model asterid Antirrhinum 
majus (snapdragon) the earliest investigated system. In An- 
tirrhinum, bilateral symmetry results from two genes, CY- 
CLOIDEA (CYC) and DICHOTOMA (DICH) (Luo et al. 
1996, 1999; Cubas et al. 1999). Since the initial identifica- 
tion of the role of 
CYC and DICH, much has been learned 
about floral symmetry genes in snapdragon—in fact, the

Floral Diversification 
375 
genes and genetic interactions that control its bilateral sym- 
metry are now generally well understood (reviewed in Hile- 
man 2014a,b). A number of genes and gene interactions are 
needed for the development of bilateral floral symmetry. 
CYC and DICH are recent gene duplicates; both are tran- 
scription factors and function in a manner that is partially 
redundant, specifying adaxial floral identity in zygomor- 
phic flowers (Fig. 14.27). Expression of CYC and DICH 
genes not only determines the shape of the dorsal petals 
in snapdragon (Fig. 14.27), but also controls the abortion 
of the dorsal stamen (which is sterile in these plants). The 
gene DIVARICATA (DIV), representing another family of 
transcription factors, specifies the distinctive ventral petal 
shape in the flowers of snapdragon (Fig. 14.27). Lastly, the 
role of all three genes (CYC, DICH, and DIV) depends on 
the interplay with another transcription factor, RADIALIS 
(RAD). CYC and DICH have a role in positively regulat- 
ing RAD—as a result, the function of the RAD protein is 
largely in the dorsal portion of flowers, where CYC and 
DICH are expressed (Fig. 14.27). These data for Antirrhi- 
num provide a crucial foundation for elucidating the evolu- 
tion of floral symmetry and obtaining new insights across 
the angiosperms (Hileman 2014b). 
As more lineages have been investigated using develop- 
mental genetic methods, it has been possible to garner new 
insights into the genetic underpinning of the evolution of 
zygomorphy across the multiple lineages that obtained this 
feature independently. These studies now indicate a “strik- 
ing parallelism in the independent evolution of bilateral 
symmetry” (Hileman 2014b; p. 5). That is, a CYC-based 
genetic program has been employed repeatedly to specify 
dorsal floral identity across the angiosperms. 
The developmental program of Antirrhinum may be 
conserved throughout Lamiales (Zhong and Kellogg 2015), 
and CYC-like genes may also be involved in the evolution of 
zygomorphy in Dipsacales and Asterales (Hileman 2014b). 
In Asteraceae, CYC-like genes are involved in the differen- 
tiation of ray flowers (with bilateral symmetry) from disc 
flowers (with radial symmetry) (Fig. 14.28). In fact, differ- 
ent paralogs of the CYC gene family confer zygomorphy in 
species of Asteraceae with independently derived zygomor- 
phy (Chapman et al. 2012). 
A CYC homolog also controls bilateral symmetry in the 
rosid clade based on studies of Lotus japonicus (Fabaceae; 
Feng et al. 2006). Thus, homologs of CYC have been inde- 
pendently recruited in the determination of floral symme- 
try in the two major lineages of eudicots, superasterids and 
superrosids. Based on phylogenetic analyses, it is clear that 
bilateral symmetry has evolved multiple times in rosids (see 
Fig. 14.26). Furthermore, developmental genetic data now 
indicate that 
CYC homologs have been recruited in at least 
three cases (Fabaceae, Brassicaceae, Malpighiaceae).

Developmental control of bilateral symmetry in Antirrhinum. (a) Image showing the dorsal and ventral sides of the flower and the line that divides 
the flower into left and right mirror images (bilateral symmetry). (b) Dorsal flower identity is specified by CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and DICHOTOMA (DICH), transcrip- 
tion factors that are partially redundant in function. CYC and DICH establish dorsal identity via activation of RADIALIS (RAD). Ventral floral identity is specified by 
DIVARICATA (DIV). Expression of DIV is excluded from the dorsal flower domain area via negative regulation by RAD. (c) In the ventral portion of the flower where 
RAD is absent (bottom), DIV-DRIF heterodimers form, bind DIV consensus binding sequences, and are able to regulate downstream genes necessary for ventral 
flower development. RAD, which is restricted to the dorsal part of the flower, antagonizes DIV function by competing with DIV for a DRIF transcription factor (top 
panel). RAD-DRIF heterodimers may form in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm, but RAD lacks the C-terminal DNA binding domain found in DIV. Therefore, RAD seques- 
ters DRIF from interaction with DIV; DIV alone cannot regulate downstream target genes. (d) Modeling studies suggest that the dorsoventral identity genes, CYC, 
DICH, and DIV, not only control petal growth rates, but also influence the establishment of tissue polarity organizers that are critical for specific growth trajectories. 
Distal polarity organizers (gray—upper lobes of flower) are established early in floral development, and without DICH (plus CYC) contribution to the dorsal distal 
organizers of tissue polarity, models of floral development fail to produce asymmetric dorsal petal lobes. Central polarity organizers (gray—middle of flower) are 
established later in flower development at the ventral-lateral petal junction, and without DIV contribution to the central organizers, models of floral development 
do not produce a properly elongated corolla tube and ventral palate. (Figure and legend modified from Hileman 2014a, with permission.) 
Although there have been fewer investigations of basal 
eudicots and monocots, the evidence also suggests that 
CYC-like genes are responsible for the transition to bilat- 
eral symmetry in those lineages as well (reviewed in Hile- 
man 2014b). Developmental genetic data support a role 
for CYC-like genes in the evolution of bilateral symmetry 
in the basal eudicot Capnoides (Papaveraceae) (K6lsch and 
Gleissberg 2006; Damerval et al. 2007). Only a few mono- 
cot lineages have been investigated, but CYC-like genes are 
associated with a change to bilateral symmetry in Zingibera- 
les and Commelina (Commelinaceae) (Bartlett and Specht 
2011; Preston and Hileman 2012). Interestingly, in these 
monocots, differential expression of CYC-like genes occurs 
on the ventral side of the flower, whereas in eudicots CYC- 
like genes are involved in dorsal floral development (Hile- 
man 2014b). 
Many lineages contain multiple paralogs of CYC-like 
genes. For example, in some Fabaceae (e.g., Lotus and 
Pisum have been investigated in detail), there are three 
paralogs of CYC; two paralogs (CYC1 and CYC2) func- 
tion redundantly and are responsible for dorsal petal iden- 
tity (e.g., Xu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2008; reviewed in 
Hileman 2014b). Similarly, duplicate CYC-like genes play 
an important role in the bilateral symmetry of flowers of 
various asterid species, including Lonicera (Caprifoliaceae) 
(Howarth et al. 2011), members of Gesneriaceae (Gao et al. 
2008; Zhou et al. 2008), and various Asteraceae (Broholm 
et al. 2008; Chapman et al. 2012). 
The loss of bilateral symmetry and the reversion to ra- 
dial symmetry, documented in many clades of angiosperms, 
may derive from multiple causes. 
A complete loss of CYC- 
like gene expression is one possible mechanism, but the 
typical pathway for this reversal in lineages studied so far 
involves a role for the multiple paralogs of CYC-like genes 
(see above: one CYC-like paralog is lost, and the other 
paralog has expanded expression across the floral center 
[e.g., as in Plantago; Preston et al. 2011)). 
MODE: ADAPTATIONS TO 
POLLINATORS 
Much of floral diversity has been shaped by interactions 
of angiosperms with their pollinators. Floral organization 
and construction reflect broad pollination syndromes (e.g., 
so-called “hummingbird flowers” vs. “bee flowers”; e.g., 
Fenster et al. 2004; Waser 2006), but additional features 
may also result from selection by pollinators and be cru- 
cial elements of floral diversity. Most prominent among 
these attributes—and the best studied—is color variation, 
particularly anthocyanins and their underlying genetic and 
biosynthetic pathway. 

The role of anthocyanins in controlling floral color has 
been known for over half a century (e.g., Hagen 1959), 
and the basic biosynthetic pathway yielding anthocyanins 
has likewise been understood for many years (see Koes 
et al. 2005; Rausher 2008). On a gross level, we have long 
known that a loss-of-function mutation at any step in the 
anthocyanin pathway will block pigment production, re- 
sulting in white-flowered mutants. Often, white-flowered 
plants represent the double recessive genotype of a Men- 
delian trait within a population, but white flowers on 
broader geographic and phylogenetic scales are likely not 
homologous due to the many ways in which anthocyanin 
production can be blocked. The control of different colors, 
however, is much more complex. Despite knowledge of the 
catalyzing enzymes in the pathway, the genes for many of 
the steps have, until recently, remained elusive. Moreover, 
the connection between altered gene expression (via either 
gene number or regulation), variation in floral color, and 
pollinator-mediated radiations is only now beginning to 
emerge (e.g., Whittall et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2008; Smith 
and Rausher 2011; Smith and Goldberg 2015). Here we 
review the key elements of anthocyanin genetics and how

genetic variation in key enzymes leads to evolutionarily sig- 
nificant variation in flower color. 
Anthocyanin production is controlled by complex inter- 
actions involving the biosynthetic pathway itself and a set 
of regulatory proteins (reviewed by Koes et al. 2005; Stom- 
mel et al. 2009). The biosynthetic pathway is controlled by 
six enzymes, beginning with chalcone synthase (CHS). The 
number of gene copies encoding these key enzymes varies 
among species, for example, from two CHS genes in Zea 
mays (Coe et al. 1981) to 12 in Petunia x hybrida (Koes 
et al. 1989). Regulatory genes control the tissues and/or 
developmental stage at which the enzyme-coding genes 
are expressed. A regulatory complex comprising MYB and 
bHLH MYC proteins plus WD40 repeat (WDR) proteins 
controls transcription of the anthocyanin structural genes 
(Ramsay and Glover 2005). Specific sets of MYB, MYC, 
and WDR genes have been identified in Zea and Petunia 
as coding the proteins that form the complex that activates 
the anthocyanin genes. Evolutionary analyses of flower 
color variation (e.g., Rauscher 2008; Smith and Rausher 
2011) are extending understanding of this pathway and its 
interactions to natural systems. 

The Evolution of Genome Size 
Genome evolution in angiosperms is highly complex and 
multifaceted, and therefore our review cannot be com- 
prehensive. A general review of genome evolution might 
include wide-ranging topics, such as rates and patterns of 
nucleotide substitution, origins of introns and novel genes, 
evolutionary forces that shape patterns of genomic diver- 
sity, origins and evolution of transposable elements (TEs), 
concerted evolution, origins and functions of small RNAs, 
interactions between nuclear and organellar genomes, and 
many more. However, many of these topics have not been 
addressed broadly within angiosperms, and information is 
often restricted to one or a few model species. Rather than 
attempting a comprehensive review of genome evolution in 
angiosperms, we instead emphasize the evolution of genome 
size, the dynamics and mechanisms of genome size evolu- 
tion, and resulting variation in genome content and struc- 
ture. Well over 50 genome sequences have been reported 
for plants, 47 of them angiosperms (Michael and Jackson 
2013), and investigation of these sequences has provided 
enormous insights into the gene content and structure of 
plant genomes, with an emphasis on angiosperms. Despite 
enormous progress, there is still much to learn about the 
organization of plant genomes, gene function, and the non- 
coding space (Michael and Jackson 2013, p. 1). 
Here we focus on the evolution of genome size across 
the angiosperms and land plants, as well as some of the 
factors that govern variation and evolution of genome size. 
We also mention briefly the diverse mechanisms of genome 
evolution, the role of repetitive elements in genome size 
dynamics, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as a source of 
variation in gene content, and issues related to gene expres- 
sion, such as methylation and epigenetics. It is impossible 
to consider genome evolution in the angiosperms without 
concomitantly considering polyploidy (e.g., Fedoroff 2000; 
Wendel 2000; Adams and Wendel 2005; Eckardt 2008; 
Diez et al. 2014; chapters in Soltis and Soltis 2012; chap- 
ters in Wendel et al. 2012; chapters in Chen and Birchler 
2013). As a result, polyploidy (whole-genome duplication; 
WGD) is discussed here as a basic component of genome 
size variation and evolution, as is genome downsizing 
(polyploidy is covered in greater detail in Chapter 16). 
Both chromosome number and genome size vary tre- 
mendously across the flowering plants (e.g., Fedorov 1969; 
Plant DNA C-Values Database _http://www.rbgkew.org 
.uk/cval/homepage.html; Chromosome Counts Database 
http://ccdb.tau.ac.il/). This variation has stimulated a great 
deal of speculation about the original genome size and base 
chromosome number of the angiosperms, as well as about 
the patterns of genome and chromosomal evolution. Simi- 
lar questions regarding patterns of genome evolution are of 
interest across all land plants. 
Despite the frequency of polyploidy in plants, most 
estimates of the original base chromosome number for 
angiosperms are low, between x = 6 and 9 (e.g., Ehren- 
dorfer et al. 1968; Stebbins 1971; Walker 1972; Raven 
1975; Grant 1981), with a correspondingly small ances- 
tral genome size (Leitch et al. 1998; Soltis et al. 2003b). 
However, analysis of the vast range of chromosome num- 
bers and genome sizes encountered in angiosperms shows 
that genome size can vary independently of chromosome 
number (see Soltis et al. 2005b). Furthermore, reconstruct- 
ing ancestral base chromosome numbers and genome sizes 

for angiosperms is complex (see Soltis et al. 2005b), due in 
large part to rampant polyploidy throughout angiosperm 
evolutionary history. Moreover, although the estimation of 
the ancestral base chromosome number for angiosperms 
was of paramount interest historically, with discussion by 
some of the leading botanists of the mid-1900s (e.g., Steb- 
bins 1971; Raven 1975; Grant 1981), current efforts at 
inferring the ancestral angiosperm genome focus more on 
gene content and genome size and structure, rather than 
how the genome is packaged into chromosomes. We envi- 
sion, however, a return to the evolution of “genome pack- 
aging,” once greater understanding of the basic elements of 
genome evolution is achieved. 
GENOME SIZE 
A significant semantic problem concerns different uses of 
the term “genome” and “genome size” (Greilhuber et al. 
2005S). As originally defined (Winkler 1920), genome re- 
ferred to a monoploid chromosome complement. Since a 
monoploid complement is defined as “having one chro- 
mosome set with the basic (x) number of chromosomes” 
(Rieger et al. 1991), it followed by definition that any poly- 
ploid taxon had three or more genomes. 
However, an alternative meaning, now in common us- 
age, uses genome as an interchangeable alternative for the 
1C-value to refer to the DNA content of an unreplicated 
gametic nuclear complement, irrespective of ploidal level. 
Unless the meaning intended is clearly defined on each oc- 
casion, this can be confusing, especially when authors use 
both meanings for a polyploid taxon in the same paper. 
To overcome this issue Greilhuber et al. (2005) tried to 
standardize the terminology; they distinguished between 
the “holoploid” genome size, which is the amount of DNA 
in the nucleus independent of ploidal level, and “mono- 
ploid” genome size in which the ploidal level is taken into 
account. Greilhuber et al. (2005) recognized that the term 
“genome size” was imprecise. Thus, it is always more ac- 
curate to state whether one is referring to a 1C, 2C, or 4C 
holoploid value or a monopioid C-value, for which Greil- 
huber et al. (2005) used the shorthand of 1Cx, 2Cx, or 4Cx- 
value. Note that for polyploids, monoploid genome sizes 
estimated in this way are always smaller than the holoploid 
C-values. For example, in the diploid Triticum monococ- 
cum, 2C = 12.45 pg, so the holoploid 1C-value = 12.45 + 
2 = 6.23 pg, which also equals the monoploid 1Cx-value. 
In the tetraploid T: dicoccum, in contrast, 2C = 24.05 pg, so 
holoploid 1C = 24.05 + 2, which equals 12.03 pg, but the 
monoploid 1Cx-value is 24.05 + 4, or 6.01 pg. 
C-values (nearly 11,000) have been estimated for more 
than 7542 species of angiosperms (Bennett et al. 1997;

proximately 350,000 species of flowering plants and ap- 
proximately 60% of all angiosperm families (sensu APG 
1998; APG II 2003; APG III 2009; APG IV 2016). The Plant

represents the largest collection of nuclear DNA amounts 
for any group of organism (reviewed in Leitch et al. 1998; 
Bennett and Leitch 2011; Leitch and Leitch 2013). We will 
focus our discussions and analyses on 1Cx-values. 
C-values in angiosperms span a huge range (Greilhuber 
and Leitch 2013; see Plant DNA C-Values Database and 
Figs. 15.1, 15.2). These values have historically been re- 
ported in pg, but in this age of relatively facile and inexpen- 
sive genome sequencing, perhaps a better unit is megabases 
(Mb; 1 pg = 978 Mb). Some of the smallest reported val- 
ues are for several species in the carnivorous genus Genli- 
sea (0.06 pg, Fleischmann et al. 2014), Cardamine amara 
(Brassicaceae; 1C = 0.05 pg, Bennett and Smith 1991), and 
Fragaria (Rosaceae; 1C = 0.10 pg, Antonius and Ahokas 
1996). Arabidopsis thaliana, a well-known model organ- 
ism with a very small genome, has 1C = 0.16 pg (157 Mb; 
Bennett et al. 2003); the largest value is for Paris japonica 
(Melanthiaceae; 1C = 152.2 pg, Bennett and Smith 1976); 
other Melanthiaceae and Liliaceae also have high values 
(see below). 
Despite this 3,000-fold range in DNA amount, the ba- 
sic complement of genes required for normal growth and 
development appears to be essentially the same (i.e., even 
the 82-Mb genome of Utricularia gibba has an estimated 
28,500 genes, similar to gene content estimated for Ara- 
bidopsis, papaya, grape, Erythranthe, and tomato [Ibarra- 
Laclette et al. 2013]), reflective of the decades-old “C-value 
paradox” (Thomas 1971). The apparent paradox high-

lights the lack of association between genome size, in both 
plants and animals, and organismal complexity. There is, 
however, much less variation in actual genic content among 
plant genomes; differences in amount of DNA largely re- 
flect changes in the proportion of non-coding, repetitive 
DNA. This new understanding helps put to rest the pri- 
mary observation that underlies the C-value paradox. 
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the large 
variation in genome size in the angiosperms (reviewed in 
Kellogg and Bennetzen 2004; Grover and Wendel 2010; 
Leitch and Leitch 2013; Michael 2014). Repeated cycles of 
polyploidy may increase genome size (e.g., Leitch and Ben- 
nett 1997; D. Soltis et al. 2009; Otto and Whitton 2000; 
P. Soltis and Soltis 2000, 2009; Wendel 2000; see Chapter 
16). In addition, transposable elements (TEs) also contrib- 
ute to increases in genome size throughout eukaryotes (e.g., 
Flavell 1988; Bennetzen 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007; Fedoroff 
2000; Sankoff 2001; Kidwell 2002; Kazazian 2004; Ben- 
netzen et al. 2005; Michael and Jackson 2013; Michael 
2014; see below for further discussion). Gregory (2001) 
suggested that the phrase “C-value paradox” be replaced 
by “C-value enigma” to indicate that the current challenge 
is to understand the mechanisms and forces that determine 
the amounts of repetitive DNA in a genome. 
Leitch et al. (1998) calculated mean C-values for many 
angiosperm species and first considered the evolution of 
genome size in light of angiosperm phylogeny. Updated 
calculations (in Soltis et al. 2003d, 2005b) showed that de- 
spite the enormous range in values, most angiosperms have 
very small C-values, between 0.1 and 3.5 pg (Fig. 15.1). In 
fact, the modal C-value for angiosperms is actually quite 
low, 0.7 pg (~675 Mb). Large genomes are present in only 
a few diverse clades: various monocots (especially Aspar- 
agales and Liliales), some Santalales, and a few asterids. 
However, even in these clades, most members have small 
or intermediate-sized genomes; only two groups contain 
members with very large genomes (>35 pg, 50 times the 
modal value), Santalales and monocots. Considering only 
the six groups in which large to very large genome sizes 
have been reported, relatively few species in each group 
have large genomes. Furthermore, those species with large 
genomes tend to be restricted to the more derived fami- 
lies within each of these groups (Leitch et al. 1998). The 
most parsimonious explanation for these observations is 
that the ancestral angiosperms had small genomes and that 
the possession of large genomes is derived, with very large 
genomes derived independently multiple times (see Soltis 
et al. 2005b). However, given the recognition of frequent 
ancient WGDs in angiosperms, small genome sizes are, in 
many cases, not ancestral but rather have been derived via 
genome downsizing (see Chapter 16). 
Within extant seed plants, a very small genome is unique 
to the angiosperms (Leitch et al. 1998, 2001). Extant 
gymnosperms are generally characterized by much larger 
C-values than is typical of angiosperms (see Soltis and 
Soltis 2013b), although some Gnetales do have small ge- 
nomes (Burleigh et al. 2012; see below). The modal C-value 
for 152 gymnosperms is 15.8 pg, compared with a modal 
value of 0.6 for angiosperms (Leitch et al. 2001; this modal 
value for angiosperms is slightly lower than that reported 
by Leitch et al. 1998, 0.7 pg). Similarly, the modal C-value 
for 50 leptosporangiate ferns is 7.95 pg (Obermayer et al. 
2002; Leitch and Leitch 2013), which is also higher than 
that for angiosperms. 
. 
C-values for phylogenetically pivotal taxa helped pro- 
vide important insights into genome size evolution in an- 
giosperms (e.g., Amborella, Austrobaileya, Illicium, Cera- 
tophyllum; Hanson et al. 2001; Leitch and Hanson 2002). 
Amborella and Nymphaeales (the first two branches of an- 
giosperm phylogeny; see Chapter 3) have low 1C values. Two 
species of Nymphaea have very small genomes (1C-values 
of 0.89, and 0.60 and 1.10, respectively; Leitch and Hanson 
2002), and the water lily Brasenia has 1C = 1.25 (Diao et al. 
2006). Trithuria submersa (Hydatellaceae; sister to other 
Nymphaeales) also has a small genome (1C = 1.37 pg) and 
yet is a clear polyploid with 2n = 56, indicating that dip- 
loids in Trithuria likely have smaller C-values. 
Soltis et al. (2003b, 2005b) reexamined genome size 
evolution in the angiosperms, as well as in seed plants 
in general. They used genome size estimates for diploids, 
avoided using means for large clades, and implemented 
the same categories of C-values established by Leitch et al. 
(1998): C-values less than or equal to 1.4 pg and 3.5 pg 
(2 and 5 times the modal C-value of 0.7 pg for angio- 
sperms) were considered “very small” and “small,” respec- 
tively; C-values of 3.51 to 13.99 pg were considered “in- 
termediate”; C-values greater than or equal to 14.0 pg and 
35 pg (20 and 50 times the modal C-value) were considered 
“large” and “very large” genomes, respectively. We will use 
these genome size categories throughout the remainder of 
this section of the chapter. 
Average genome sizes for families can be misleading if 
values reported in the literature represent both diploids and 
polyploids, because often the highest values of genome size 
in a family are for polyploids. In Magnolia, for example, 
the reported C-values are 0.90 pg, 5.98 pg, and 7.1 pg. 
Magnolia kobus has a C-value of 0.90 pg and is diploid, 
with 2” = 38, which is the lowest number for Magnolia. 
Liriodendron, the sister of Magnolia, also with 2n = 38, 
has a C-value of 0.80, which is comparable to M. kobus. 
The highest C-values for Magnolia are from two sepa- 
rate reports for M. soulangeana, with 2n = 76. The higher 
C-values for this species, 5.98 and 7.1, would therefore be 
attributed to polyploidy, although genome doubling alone 

cannot be responsible for this huge increase 
ip C-value. 
In contrast, another paleopolyploid, the eudicot Aesculus 
hippocastanum (horse chestnut), has a very small genome 
(1C = 0.1 pg), but it, as well as the entire genus Aesculus 
(Sapindaceae), are ancient polyploids with 2 = 40 (Steb- 
bins 1950; Soltis and Soltis 1990). It is apparent, therefore, 
that not all presumed ancient polyploids necessarily have 
large genomes; ancient rounds of WGD are frequently ac- 
companied by loss of much of the duplicated DNA, in some 
cases even reducing genome size over time to a lower value 
than that observed in related lineages that did not experi- 
ence the WGD. 
The results above illustrate the importance of consid- 
ering multiple taxa when reconstructing ancestral genome 
sizes. For example, Magnolia and Liriodendron should 
both be represented in analyses of genome evolution, and 
Magnolia should be represented by the value for the dip- 
loid M. kobus. With this approach, the ancestral state for 
Magnoliaceae is reconstructed with a very small 1C-value 
(less than 1.5 pg). When a mean value is used for Magnolia, 
the family has a small C-value (1.5-3.6 pg). Mean values 
reported for large clades at higher taxonomic levels can 
also be misleading. The mean for Santalales is 1C = 12.7 pg 
(Leitch et al. 1998), but this value is strongly influenced 
by extremely high values for just one genus, Viscum (see 
below). 
New analyses with an updated angiosperm topology and 
the addition of new C-values again found that the ancestral 
angiosperm genome size is very small (Fig. 15.2), regardless 
of the reconstruction method. Thus, our reconstructions of 
a revised and updated matrix reinforce the earlier conclu- 
sion (Leitch et al. 1998; Soltis et al. 2003b, 2005b) that 
the ancestral genome size of angiosperms was very small. 
This result is also recovered when alternative nuclear-based 
topologies for angiosperms are used (e.g., Zeng et al. 2014; 
results not shown here). 
Not only do our new reconstructions indicate that the 
ancestral genome size of angiosperms is very small, they 
also indicate that ancestral genome sizes are very small for 
most major clades of the angiosperm tree of life (Fig. 15.2), 
including magnoliids, monocots, eudicots, and major sub- 
clades within the eudicots. Refinements of this conclusion 
may emerge from phylogenetic analyses that include many 
more terminals, capitalizing on the expanding C-values 
resources. 
Broader reconstructions of genome size diversification 
across all embryophytes (land plants) similarly revealed that 
the ancestral genome size of angiosperms was very small 
(Leitch et al. 2005). Our new analyses here (Fig. 15.3a) 
reinforce this conclusion. Reports from the literature indi- 
cate that all three bryophyte lineages (liverworts, mosses, 
hornworts) are characterized by very small genomes (1C < 
Genome Size 
381 
1.4 pg). Our reconstructions that include C-values for all 
three bryophyte groups indicate that the original genome 
size of land plants was likely very small (Fig. 15.3a). Al- 
though the accuracy of the reports for hornworts and liv- 
erworts has been questioned (Leitch et al. 2005), recently 
reported values continue to be very low (i.e., the average 
1C-value recently reported for 24 hornworts was ~0.27 pg; 
Bainard and Villarreal 2013). Genome sizes are similarly 
small in liverworts (Temsch et al. 2010). 
In contrast to bryophytes, diverse C-values are evident 
in the lycophytes. Isoetes has an intermediate C-value, and 
Selaginella has a very small C-value; the C-values of Lyco- 
podium and Huperzia are small and large, respectively. The 
ancestor of the lycophytes is reconstructed as equivocal in 
our analyses—or with an intermediate genome size—but 
more analyses with more taxa are needed (Fig. 15.3a). 
Following the lycophytes, our reconstructions favor an 
intermediate genome size (Fig. 15.3a) as ancestral for all 
remaining vascular plants (Euphyllophytina or euphyllo- 
phytes, Kenrick and Crane 1997). That is, an increase in 
genome size accompanied the origin of the euphyllophytes, 
and intermediate genome sizes are maintained throughout 
most lineages of euphyllophytes, with some increases and 
decreases. Again, the broader analyses highlight that the 
origin of the angiosperms involved a dramatic decrease in 
genome size (Fig. 15.3a; see Soltis and Soltis 2013b). 
Within 
the monilophytes, 
several 
independent 
de- 
creases and increases in genome size occurred. The evo- 
lution of Marsileaceae (represented by Regnellidium and 
Pilularia) + Salviniaceae (represented by Salvinia) within 
the ferns clearly involved a major decrease in genome size 
(Fig. 15.3a). In all reconstructions, ferns have an ancestral 
genome size that is intermediate; reductions to small ge- 
nomes apparently occurred independently in Ceratopteris 
and Asplenium (Fig. 15.3a). 
Considering gymnosperms, the mean C-values are gen- 
erally high: cycads, 14.71 pg; Ginkgo, 9.95 pg; Gnetales, 
7.23 pg; Pinaceae, 22.02 pg; and other conifers, 11.89 pg. 
The lowest C-values for gymnosperms are for Gnetales— 
Gnetum has a mean 1C = 3.38 pg, which represents a de- 
crease in genome size just within the clade of extant gym- 
nosperms (Soltis et al. 2003d; Leitch et al. 2005; Burleigh 
et al. 2012) (Fig. 15.3a). 
There is also evidence for several independent increases 
in genome size across land plants. One occurred in Hu- 
perzia of the lycophytes; the largest increase may have oc- 
curred in the clade that contains Ophioglossaceae (Ophi- 
oglossum) + Psilotaceae (Psilotum; Fig. 15.3a). Although 
there are uncertainties in our analyses, our reconstructions 
indicate that gymnosperms as well as euphyllophytes had 
an ancestral genome size that was intermediate.

within angiosperms was dynamic, with both ingreases and 
decreases; for example, dramatic changes can be seen just 
within the monocots (Leitch et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2005b; 
Soltis and Soltis 2013b) (Fig. 15.3a,b). A consistent result 
is that the origin of the angiosperms coincided with a de- 
crease in genome size (Figs 15.2, 15.3a). Our new recon- 
structions indicate that a very small genome size was ances- 
tral throughout the basal angiosperms, the early-diverging 
eudicots, and also most of the major clades of core eudicots 
(e.g., Caryophyllales, rosids, asterids; Fig. 15.2). Our recon- 
structions indicate repeated increases in genome size across 
diverse lineages of flowering plants, but more detailed 
analyses of major subclades of angiosperms are needed to 
pinpoint the various increases and decreases. 
GENETIC OBESITY HYPOTHESIS 
Bennetzen and Kellogg (1997) first proposed that genome 
size evolution in plants would be largely unidirectional, 
with an overall pattern of increase due to the combined 
influence of polyploidy and the accumulation of retroele- 
ments. These authors suggested that plants have a “one way 
ticket to genetic obesity.” Broad surveys of angiosperms ap- 
pear to be in general agreement with the genetic obesity 
hypothesis, with very large genomes confined to taxa that 
occupy derived positions within larger clades (Leitch et al. 
1998; Soltis et al. 2003b). However, these approaches are 
coarse-grained, and new mechanisms of DNA loss have 
been uncovered; thus, it has become evident that plant ge- 
nomes often have a return ticket and can slim down (Ben- 
netzen and Kellogg 1997; Cox et al. 1998; Wendel et al. 
2002; Grover and Wendel 2010; Michael 2014). 
The evolution of genome size at lower taxonomic levels 
has still only occasionally been examined in a phylogenetic 
context. In Pooideae (Poaceae), the ancestral grass genome 
size was inferred to be 2C = 3.5 pg (Kellogg 1998). Kellogg 
also provided evidence for a steady increase in genome size 
in Pooideae, ultimately leading to the much larger genome 
sizes (2C = 10.7 pg or more) in the Triticeae. However, 
genome size decreased in some genera, including Oryza, 
Chloris, and Sorghum. Furthermore, although increases in 
genome size in grasses are often due to polyploidy, prolif- 
eration of TEs also contributes, but is lineage-specific (e.g., 
Bennetzen 2007; Morgante et al. 2007; Charles et al. 2008). 
Moreover, rapid losses of TEs can, in fact, lead to reductions 
in genome size (Bennetzen 2005; Hawkins et al. 2009). 
Proliferation of transposable elements has led to a three- 
fold increase in genome size in Gossypium (cotton) in the 
5-10 million years since the divergence of the major clades 
(Hawkins et al. 2006). This variation is due to lineage- 
specific expansions of different classes of TEs among spe-

cies of Gossypium (Hawkins et al. 2006). However, in con- 
trast to a model of unidirectional change in genome size, 
in a clade of Gossypium and allies (the cotton tribe, Gos- 
sypieae, Malvaceae), the frequency of decreases in genome 
size exceeded the number of increases (Fig. 15.4; Wendel 
et al. 2002). Independent decreases in genome size occurred 
in Cienfuegosia, Gossypium raimondii, the ancestor of 
Gossypioides kirkii + Kokia drynarioides, and the ancestor 
of Thespesia, with three separate increases, in Gossypium 
herbaceum, Hampea appendiculata, and Thespesia popul- 
nea (Fig. 15.4). 
Lentibulariaceae, well known for their very small ge- 
nomes (Genlisea tuberosa and G. aurea have 1C-values of 
0.06 pg; Fleischmann et al. 2014), have experienced both 
expansions and contractions of genome size (Veleba et al. 
2014). A new phylogenetic analysis of Lentibulariaceae 
(Genlisea, Utricularia, and Pinguicula) has served as the 
basis for examining the evolution of genome size, with 1C- 
values now available for 119 taxa. From an ancestral es- 
timated genome size of 414 Mb, genome size increased in 
Pinguicula, in some cases due to polyploidy, with a few min- 
iaturizations (Veleba et al. 2014). More dramatic miniatur- 
izations, to genomes < 100 Mb, have occurred repeatedly 
in Genlisea and Utricularia. Despite these well-documented 
cases of genome miniaturization, the mechanisms and driv- 
ing forces have not been identified. Carnivory, and an ad- 
aptation to low-nutrient habitats, has been proposed as a 
factor selecting for small genome sizes in these plants, yet 
no statistical association of genome size with any morpho- 
logical or ecological variables was detected (Veleba et al. 
2014). Likewise, increased mutation rates, suggested as a 
mechanism of genome contraction in Utricularia and Gen- 
lisea, have not been verified to drive genome shrinkage in 
U. gibba (Ibarra-Laclette et al. 2013). 
Polyploids sometimes have genome sizes that are sub- 
stantially smaller than those of diploid congeners. Using 
C-values for 3,021 species, Leitch and Bennett (2004) found 
that mean 1C-value does not increase in direct proportion 
with ploidy. This observation held true in comparisons con- 
ducted in several distinct clades and provides clear evidence 
for genome downsizing in many polyploids (Fig. 15.5). 
Furthermore, “aggressive purging” of long terminal repeat 
retrotransposons (LTRs) via multiple mechanisms provides 
evidence for genome downsizing, even in the wake of many 
mechanisms of genome expansion (Michael 2014). Thus, 
several lines of evidence indicate that genome size evolu- 
tion in the angiosperms, as well as in embryophytes in gen- 
eral, is dynamic, with both increases and decreases having 
repeatedly occurred (e.g., Rabinowicz 2000; Wendel et al. 
2002; Leitch et al. 2005; Bennetzen 2005; Grover and Wen- 
del 2010; Leitch and Leitch 2013).

Reconstruction of the evolution of genome size in the cotton tribe (Gossypieae). The maximum likelihood and parsimony trees are identical and 
were inferred from CesA7 sequence data, The number of character state changes and jackknife support (%; in italics) from maximum parsimony analysis are shown 
above each internal branch. The tree is rooted with Malva sylvestris (ingroup-outgroup branch length = 0.12). Genome sizes (in pg) are shown at branch tips before 
species names, which are followed by somatic chromosome numbers. Ancestral genome sizes were estimated using sum-of-squared-changes parsimony analysis 
(Maddison 1991) and a generalized least squared method (Martins and Hansen 1997). A Wagner parsimony (Swofford and Maddison 1987) reconstruction was also 
conducted, but these estimates are not shown. The former estimates are shown in boxes on the internal branches. Inferred genome size increases are shown by 
shaded branches, decreases are indicated by unfilled branches, and ambiguities or stasis are denoted by hatched branches. (Modified from Wendel et al. 2002.)

MECHANISMS OF GENOME 
~™ 
SIZE EVOLUTION 
There are several avenues by which changes in genome 
size can occur. It is difficult to consider genome evolution 
in angiosperms without considering the impact of poly- 
ploidy (e.g., Wendel 2000). Polyploidy may substantially 
increase genome size in a single step (see Chapter 16 for 
further discussion of polyploidy). Proliferation of repeti- 
tive elements also plays a major role in increasing genome 
size (Kidwell 2002), through the large-scale accumulation 
of retroelements, as in Poaceae (Bennetzen 1996, 2000, 
2007; SanMiguel et al. 1996) and some non-angiosperm 
lineages, such as Pinus (Elsik and Williams 2000) and Nor- 
way spruce (Nystedt et al. 2013). Transposable elements 
contribute to increases in genome size throughout eukary- 
otes (e.g., Gaut 2002; Bennetzen 2000, 2005, 2007; Wen- 
del 2000; Fedoroff 2000; Kidwell 2002; Kazazain 2004; 
Michael and Jackson 2013; Michael 2014). In fact, plant 
genomes are often packed with TEs. 
Mechanisms of genome contraction are not as well 
known as mechanisms for increase, but our understanding 
of how decreases in genome size occur is improving (e.g., 
Vicient et al. 1999; Kirik et al. 2000; Petrov 2001, 2002; 
Bennetzen 2002, 2005; Frank et al. 2002; Hancock 2002; 
Hawkins et al. 2008; see Michael 2014 for recent review). 
Unequal recombination can slow the increase in genome 
size, and illegitimate recombination and other deletion pro- 
cesses may be the major mechanisms for decreases in ge- 
nome size (e.g., Bennetzen 2002; Devos et al. 2002; Kellogg 
and Bennetzen 2004; Hawkins et al. 2008; Michael 2014). 
Whereas losses of large LTRs characterize some reductions 
in genome size (e.g., in Oryza sativa, Ma et al. 2004), de- 
creases in genome size may also result from thousands of 
losses of small segments of DNA, as in Arabidopsis thali- 
ana relative to A. lyrata (Hu et al. 2011). 
Studies of microbial genomes suggest that downsizing of 
some genomes may be the result of homologous recombi- 
nation at repeated genes, leading to the loss of large blocks 
of DNA as well as repeated sequences (Frank et al. 2002). 
Differences in double-stranded break repair may be respon- 
sible for some variation in genome size (Kirik et al. 2000). 
For example, differences in the processing of chromosomal 
ends have been reported in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana (to- 
bacco) (Orel and Puchta 2003); the former has a genome 
size 20 times smaller than the latter. Free DNA ends are 
much more stable in tobacco, perhaps due to better pro- 
tection of DNA break ends. Exonucleolytic degradation 
of DNA ends might be a driving force in the evolution of 
genome size (Orel and Puchta 2003). DNA resulting from 
WGD can also be “purged” through mechanisms of frac- 
Genome Size 387 
tionation and neofunctionalization, as in Utricularia gibba 
(Ibarra-Laclette et al. 2013; Michael 2014). Extensive loss 
of duplicate loci in the recent (~80-year-old) allotetraploids 
Tragopogon mirus and T: miscellus (Asteraceae) supports 
this argument as a possible general mechanism of genome 
downsizing following WGD (e.g., Tate et al. 2006, 2009; 
Koh 2010; Buggs et al. 2012). 
In some animals, insertion/deletion biases may lead to 
significant changes in genome size. A high rate of deletion 
has apparently occurred in Drosophila (Petrov 2002). Han- 
cock (2002) has reconsidered the relationship between the 
level of repetitiveness in genomic sequences and genome 
size. A previously reported correlation between genome 
size and repetitiveness was generally confirmed, but with 
some deviations. Some of the variance in repetitive DNA 
observed may be the result of variation in the effectiveness 
of mechanisms for regulating slippage errors during repli- 
cation. Recent analyses (Oliver et al. 2007) further demon- 
strate that the rate of genome size evolution is positively 
correlated with genome size, such that the fastest rates of 
genome size evolution occur in those species with the larg- 
est genomes. Further, genome size may have significant 
phenotypic effects (e.g., Greilhuber and Leitch 2013), with 
bursts of genome size due to TE proliferation suggested as 
an explanation for bursts of phenotypic evolution (e.g., 
Oliver and Greene 2009). 
The driving forces behind changes in genome size remain 
unclear. It is tempting to invoke selection, and several hy- 
potheses have been proposed for reductions in genome size 
(Leitch and Bennett 2004): (1) to reduce the nucleotypic 
effects of increased DNA amounts; (2) to reduce the bio- 
chemical costs associated with additional DNA amounts; 
and (3) to enhance polyploid genome stability. However, 
Oliver et al. (2007) argue that their analyses of correlated 
evolutionary rates and genome size explain the skewed dis- 
tribution of genome sizes in eukaryotes without invoking 
selection against large genomes. 
The interplay between mechanisms that increase and de- 
crease genome size has ultimately shaped observed patterns 
of genome size evolution (Grover and Wendel 2010). Prop- 
erties of genomes themselves may lead to expansions or 
contractions of genomes while population size, selection, 
and drift may augment or oppose genomic processes. For 
example, polyploidy, proliferation of TEs, decreased het- 
erochromatin content, decreased recombination, decreased 
methylation, and epigenetic release of TEs, along with low 
effective population size and drift, will lead to increases in 
genome size. Counteracting these processes, however, are 
unequal homologous recombination, illegitimate recombi- 
nation, increased heterochromatin, increased recombina- 
tion, increased methylation, epigenetic suppression of TEs, 
high effective population size, and selection (Grover and 

388 Chapter 15 
Wendel 2010). The magnitude and interaction of these syn- 
ergistic or opposing forces have rarely been examined and 
offer exciting avenues for further research. 
POACEAE AND BRASSICACEAE 
AS MODELS FOR STUDYING 
GENOME EVOLUTION 
Both the grass family (Poaceae) and mustard family (Bras- 
sicaceae) have been well studied genomically because of the 
enormous economic importance of many of their members. 
These clades therefore provide useful models for evaluating 
the process of genome evolution. Here we use both systems 
and employ important reviews to summarize tendencies in 
genome evolution. Use of these and other models has re- 
vealed the complexities of plant gnome evolution, includ- 
ing broad synteny, as well as major structural changes and 
genome rearrangement at finer scales. Polyploidy coupled 
with chromosomal rearrangement results in considerable 
variation in chromosome number. Major changes in ge- 
nome size have also resulted from expansion and contrac- 
tion of repetitive elements. 
POACEAE 
At a grand scale, grass genomes are highly labile for ge- 
nome size and chromosome number, yet retain consider- 
able synteny, as reviewed initially nearly two decades ago 
(e.g., Devos and Gale 1997; Gale and Devos 1998; see 
Gaut and Ross-Ibarra 2008 and below). Here, we focus 
on fine-scale processes of genome evolution in Poaceae and 
discuss synteny below. 
Despite a pattern of overall genome collinearity, at a 
finer scale, numerous rearrangements and deletions are 
evident. For example, following the origin of the rice ge- 
nome via WGD (~70 mya), there have been a segmental 
duplication (5 mya), many large-scale chromosomal rear- 
rangements, and deletions (Wang et al. 2005). Significantly, 
following the ancient WGD event, there appears to have 
been massive and rapid diploidization in which 30-65% of 
gene duplicates have been lost. 
Gaut (2002) examined genome size evolution in grasses 
in a phylogenetic context. Genome size varies a great deal 
even when only diploids are considered, varying from 1C- 
values of 0.70 to 9.15 pg. Gaut (2002) noted that genomes 
of Poaceae vary a great deal in size, varying 36-fold be- 
tween the smallest and largest diploid values. Even within 
subfamilies, there is eight-fold variation in size, indicating 
rapid change in genome size across the family. In addition, 
genome size varies across subclades. Chloridoid grasses 
have low DNA content (highest 1C-value 
= 
1.68 pg) 
while Pooideae have larger genomes (smallest 1C-value = 
1.22 pg). Panicoideae and Pooideae also appear to differ 
in genome size. 
These results pose the question—what mechanisms con- 
tribute to these dramatic changes in genome size? Much 
of the increase in genome size in grasses appears to be due 
to the accumulation of repetitive elements (e.g., Meyers 
et al. 2001; Gaut 2002; Piegu et al. 2006; Bennetzen 2007; 
Charles et al. 2008; Brenchley et al. 2012; Han et al. 2013). 
Barley and rice have similar gene complements, but exhibit 
a 12-fold difference in DNA content, most of which is the 
result of variation in repetitive DNA. Even within Oryza, 
doubling of genome size relative to O. sativa has occurred 
in O. australiensis via expansion of LTRs (Piegu et al. 
2006). Likewise, proliferation of TEs has contributed to ge- 
nome size variation in wheat, with dynamic change occur- 
ring both prior to and since allopolyploidization (Charles 
et al. 2008). Comparing maize and sorghum, differences in 
the number and complement of retrotransposons explain 
much of the four-fold difference in DNA content. In maize, 
rapid accumulation of transposable elements has been a 
major aspect of genomic change (Wei et al. 2007). 
Researchers in grass genomics have attempted to re- 
construct the ancestral chromosomal complement of the 
grass genome. Wei et al. (2007) suggested that grass ge- 
nomes evolved from an ancestor with m = 12 as the base 
chromosome number and that the structure of this ge- 
nome was similar to that of the rice genome. Research by 
Salse et al. (2008; reviewed in Eckardt 2008) provides ad- 
ditional support for this basic model of grass genome evo- 
lution and suggests that the m = 12 ancestral chromosomes 
arose from WGD and rearrangement of a basic number of 
x = 5; several breakage/fusion events yielded the ancestral 
n = 12 chromosome complement (Fig. 15.6). 
BRASSICACEAE 
Brassicaceae, with over 4,100 species, provide another 
model for the study of genome evolution. As in many other 
large clades (e.g., Poaceae, with ~11,000 species, discussed 
above), genome size and chromosome number vary con- 
siderably. Examination of genome size in a phylogenetic 
context suggests a highly dynamic pattern of evolution, 
with numerous ups and downs in genome size (Johnston 
et al. 2005; Lysak et al. 2009). Lysak et al. (2009) recon- 
structed the ancestral genome size for Brassicaceae as very 
small (1C = 0.50 pg). Approximately 50% of the species

Model proposed for the ancestral grass genome and subsequent evolution. 
A common ancestor with n = 5 chromosomes underwent a whole- 
genome duplication resulting in an n = 10 intermediate. This event was then followed by two interchromosomal translocations and fusions that led to the construc- 
tion of two new chromosomes, resulting in an n =12 intermediate ancestor. The five ancestral chromosomes are named according to rice nomenclature. This model 
(from Salse et al. 2008) proposes how the genomes of rice, wheat, maize, and sorghum evolved from the n = 12 intermediate (Eckardt 2008; modified from Salse 
et al. 2008). 
they analyzed showed a decrease in genome size from this 
ancestral state, whereas the remaining species showed an 
increase. This increase was generally moderate, but signifi- 
cant increases in C-value were found in tribes Anchonieae 
and Physarieae. Several studies have examined patterns of 
transposon evolution and changes in methylation in Bras- 
sicaceae. In a recent comparison, Seymour et al. (2014) 
examined DNA methylation and transposons from three 
species in Brassicaceae that vary in genome architecture, 
Capsella rubella, Arabidopsis lyrata, and Arabidopsis thali- 
ana. Interestingly, they found evidence that lineage-specific 
expansion and contraction of transposon and repeat se- 
quences are the main drivers of interspecific differences in 
DNA methylation in the family. 
Brassica has emerged as a model for investigating the 
genomic changes that occur after polyploidization. Studies 
of synthetic lines of allopolyploid Brassica napus over mul- 
tiple generations show evidence of rapid changes in gene 
expression, as well as genomic changes, including deletions, 
duplications, and translocations, many of which appear to 
be the consequence of homeologous recombination (Gaeta 
et al. 2007; Gaeta and Pires 2010). There is also evidence 
for changes in methylation (Lukens et al. 2006), rapid chro- 
mosomal change (Xiong et al. 2011), and major epigenetic 
changes (Lukens et al. 2006; reviewed in Diez et al. 2014). 
Comparing the genome sequence of Brassica oleracea 
with that of its sister species, B. rapa, Liu et al. (2014) 
found evidence of numerous chromosome rearrangements, 
gene loss, and amplification of transposable elements. They 
also observed changes in gene expression, some of which 
trace to changes in patterns of alternative splicing. 
Beyond genomic alterations, major changes have also 
been reported following polyploidy in Arabidopsis. Studies 
of both natural and synthetic Arabidopsis allotetraploids 
show that polyploidy can result in rapid gene silencing (Co- 
mai et al. 2000; Lee et al. 2001; Chang et al. 2010), global 
changes in patterns of gene expression (Chen 2007, 2010; 
Wang et al. 2006; Chi et al. 2012), epigenetic changes (Os- 
born et al. 2003; Madlung et al. 2005), changes in alterna- 
tive splicing (Zhang et al. 2010), and consequent changes 
in the proteome (Ng et al. 2012). 
SYNTENIC PATTERNS ACROSS 
ANGIOSPERMS 
As the number of sequenced plant genomes continues to 
increase rapidly, new areas of comparative genomic infer- 
ence have become feasible. Levels and patterns of ancient 

390 Chapter 15 
WGD are being inferred from these genomes. Furthermore, 
assembled genomes (not just the gene space) are making it 
increasingly feasible to examine synteny (conservation of 
gene order on chromosome segments) both within clades, 
such as Brassicaceae and Poaceae, and in broader com- 
parisons across the angiosperms. Extensive synteny across 
long periods of angiosperm evolutionary history has been 
one of the most important discoveries resulting from the 
comparison of plant genomes. Comparison of gene order 
in Amborella with genomes of peach (Prunus; Rosaceae), 
cacao (Theobroma; Malvaceae), and grape (Vitis; Vita- 
ceae) showed synteny across diverse clades of Superrosidae 
(Fig. 15.7) and that synteny was retained from the com- 
mon ancestor of rosids and Amborella (Amborella Genome 
Project 2013). Furthermore, this synteny has enabled addi- 
tional studies of ancient polyploidy—comparisons among 
these superrosid genomes revealed that syntenic blocks had

early in eudicot evolution (Tang et al. 2008; Jiao et al. 
2012; Amborella Genome Project 2013). 
Similarly, on a broad phylogenetic scale, Guyot et al. 
(2012) compared the genomes of Coffea (coffee; Rubia- 
ceae) and Solanum (tomato; Solanaceae), representing the 
asterid clade, with the genome of Vitis, 
a member of the 
rosid clade, and found considerable synteny at this scale 
(referred to as “macrosynteny”) across the rosid and aste- 
rid clades. There was also evidence of genome restructur- 
ing. Unexpectedly, there was more conservation of synteny 
between coffee and grape (an asterid and a rosid) than be- 
tween the two asterids (coffee and tomato) (Fig. 15.8). 
It has long been .recognized that gene order is highly 
conserved across the grass family (Poaceae) over ~60 myr 
of evolution (Gale and Devos 1998). Genetic mapping of 
nine genomes, including maize, rice, wheat, sorghum, sugar

Synteny analysis of Amborella. (A) High- 
resolution analysis of intragenomic syntenic regions from 
Amborella putatively derived from the pre-angiosperm whole- 
genome duplication (WGD). Note the series of collinear genes 
between the two regions. (B) Macrosynteny and microsynteny 
between genomic regions in Amborella and Vitis (grape). 
(Top) Macrosynteny patterns between Vitis and Amborella and 
within Amborella scaffolds (only scaffolds 1-100 are shown). 
Each Amborella region aligns to up to three Vitis regions, 
which resulted from the “gamma” hexaploidization event in 
the eudicots (Jaillon et al. 2007). Syntenic regions within the 
Amborella genome were derived from the WGD prior to the 
| 
origin of all extant angiosperms (Jiao et al. 2011). An exemplar 
set of blocks, showing two homeologous Amborella regions 
derived from this earlier WGD, aligns to three distinct grape 
regions (derived from “gamma”), with eight parallel regions in 
total. (Bottom) Microsynteny among the eight regions. Blocks 
represent genes with orientation of the same strand (blue) or 
reverse strand (green); shades represent matching gene pairs. 
(C) Gene order alignments between one of the seven ancestral 
core eudicot chromosomes and a subset of the Amborella 
scaffolds, as well as between the three post-hexaploidization 
copies of this chromosome and the peach, cacao, and grape 
chromosomes descending from it. Similar configurations were 
obtained for the other six ancestral chromosomes (Fig. 2 from 
the Amborella Genome Project 2013). 

Tomato syntenic 
blocks 
~ 
cane, foxtail millet, and others, yielded a conserved con- 
sensus grass genetic map (Fig. 15.9). Furthermore, these 
comparative genomic studies 
also revealed 
that some 
chromosomal rearrangements characterize certain groups 
of grasses (Devos and Gale 1997; Gale and Devos 1998). 
The high conservation of gene number and order in grasses 
prompted Bennetzen and Freeling (1997) to propose the 
idea of a “unified grass genome: synergism in synteny.” 
Mapping studies using genetic/genomic data as well as 
evidence from FISH (fluorescent in-situ hybridization) also 
revealed a high degree of synteny across genomes in Bras- 
sicaceae (e.g., Koch and Kiefer 2005; Cheng et al. 2012; 
Schmidt and Bancroft 2011). However, some genomes, 
such as Arabidopsis thaliana, exhibit considerable genomic 
reshuffling (Lysak et al. 2006). Using comparative genetic 
and cytogenetic analyses, researchers have attempted to 
reconstruct the “ancestral crucifer karyotype” of eight 
chromosomes with conserved genomic blocks (Lysak et al. 
2006; Schranz et al. 2006). Although this sounds plausible, 
it must be recognized that this number of chromosomes 
does not itself represent the ancestral state for Brassicaceae;

given the number of ancient WGDs known in this family 
(see above), there must have been ancestral species with 
higher numbers. The eight chromosome pairs hypothesized 
to have been present in the Brassicaceae ancestor are also 
the result of even older periods of chromosome reorganiza- 
tion/reduction—events that may have been similar to those 
postulated to have occurred in the process of going from 
the eight pairs in the Brassicaceae ancestor to the five pairs 
of modern Arabidopsis thaliana. Chromosomal evolution 
across tribes of Brassicaceae has also subsequently been re- 
constructed (Mandakovéa et al. 2010). 
In their investigation of ancient polyploidy in mono- 
cots, Jiao et al. (2014) observed conservation of syntenic 
blocks between banana (Musa acuminata, Musaceae; Zin- 
giberales) and the grasses rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum 
(Sorghum bicolor). On a broader scale, synteny facilitated 
comparison of genomes and duplicated gene blocks among 
these genomes as well as with the oil palm (Elaeis guineen- 
sis) and two sequenced eudicot genomes included for com- 
parison, grape (Vitis vinifera; Vitaceae) and sacred lotus 
(Nelumbo nucifera; Nelumbonaceae).

THE ANCESTRAL 
ANGIOSPERM GENOME 
The complete sequencing of the nuclear genome of Ambo- 
rella (Amborella Genome Project 2013), sister to all other 
extant flowering plants (Chapters 3 and 4), has profound 
implications, permitting researchers to reconstruct the ge- 
nome and gene content of the ancestral angiosperms (Ad- 
ams 2013; Amborella Genome Project 2013). The ancestral 
angiosperm gene set comprised at least 14,000 genes. Com- 
pared with non-angiosperms, the Amborella genome has 
1,179 gene lineages that first appeared in flowering plants, 
with about 4,000 gene lineages specific to seed plants (Am- 
borella Genome Project 2013). The new gene lineages dis- 
covered in flowering plants may have had gene functions 
specific to angiosperms and therefore may have been cru- 
cial to their success and rapid diversification (Adams 2013; 
Amborella Genome Project 2013). It is also apparent that 
new functions were obtained by genes already present in 
plants—a good example being genes involved in floral 
development, which have homologs in other seed plants. 
Interestingly, orthologs of most floral genes were in exis- 
tence long before a role was established in flowering—these 
genes were co-opted for floral function. 
The Amborella genome contains at least 124 microRNA 
loci corresponding to 90 different families, with 27 of those 
likely present in the ancestral angiosperm, indicating that 
non-coding small RNAs were well represented in early 
angiosperms (Adams 2013; Amborella Genome Project 
2013). Transposable elements in Amborella are “old and 
dead”—some TEs have apparently persisted for millions of 
years but are no longer active. These results contrast with 
other angiosperms in which TEs continue to proliferate, 
sometimes massively, leading to divergent families of TEs 
even within single species. 

HORIZONTAL GENE TRANSFER: 
BACKGROUND 
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also termed lateral gene 
transfer (LGT), refers to the transfer of DNA between dif- 
ferent organisms in a manner other than by vertical de- 
scent from parent to offspring. It is best known as a major 
force in prokaryote evolution, but it has also played an 
important and perhaps underappreciated role in eukary- 
otic evolution (reviewed in Keeling and Palmer 2008); we 
mentioned HGT and its potential influence on phylogeny 
reconstruction briefly in Chapter 3 (see Fig. 3.4) and in- 
clude this discussion here because of the role of HGT in al- 
tering gene content. HGT can occur between all three sub- 
cellular genomes of plants—nucleus, mitochondrion, and 
plastid. The process of HGT is complex in eukaryotes and 
not completely understood. The foreign DNA involved in 
the HGT event must pass through both the cell membrane 
and nuclear (organellar) membrane to reach the genome of 
the host cell. The number of well-supported cases of HGT 
in prokaryotes, as well as eukaryotes, including plants, has 
expanded rapidly in recent years, due in large part to in- 
creasingly large nuclear, as well as plastid and mitochon- 
drial, datasets for many species. 
OVERVIEW OF HGT IN PLANTS 
Renner and Bellot (2012) provided an excellent recent re- 
view of HGT in eukaryotes with a thorough overview of 
plant-to-plant HGT events, which is our focus here. Much 
of our summary below is based on the extensive review 
of these authors. Increasing numbers of studies have indi- 
cated that all three plant genomes have experienced HGT 
and that this may be much more common than previously 
appreciated (Richardson and Palmer 2007; Bock 2010; 
Keeling and Palmer 2008; Renner and Bellot 2012). HGT 
may be particularly prevalent in the mitochondrial genome 
(Renner and Bellot 2012), and we review some of these 
cases below (e.g., Bergthorsson et al. 2003, 2004; Won 
and Renner 2003; Davis and Wurdack 2004; Barkman 
et al. 2007; Mower et al. 2010, 2012; Knoop et al. 2011; 
Sanchez-Puerta et al. 2011; Jorizzo et al. 2012; Radice 2012; 
Stegemann et al. 2012; W. Wang et al. 2012; T. Zhang et al. 
2012; Chang et al. 2013; Cuenca et al. 2013; Greiner and 
Bock 2013; Guo and Mower 2013; Huang and Yue 2013; 
Rice et al. 2013; Richardson et al. 2013; Straub et al. 2013; 
Davis et al. 2014; Gao et al. 2014; Park et al. 2014; Smith 
2014). 
The causes of HGT in plants and other eukaryotes are 
Genome Size 
393 
not well understood, but parasitic plants appear to pro- 
vide some of the strongest evidence of HGT in eukaryotes 
in general (e.g., Davis and Wurdack 2004; Mower et al. 
2004; Nickrent et al. 2004; Park et al. 2007; Yoshida et al. 
2010; see below). As many of these papers have stressed, 
HGT in these plants appears to be facilitated by the ex- 
tremely close association between tissues of the parasites 
and their hosts. Kim et al. (2014) demonstrated that mes- 
senger RNAs representing thousands of genes moved in 
high frequency in both directions between Cuscuta and its 
host (Arabidopsis in this experiment), providing a potential 
mechanism for HGT. 
THE EXTENT OF HGT 
Recent genomic studies have provided the first insights 
into the extent of HGT in parasitic plants. A phylogenomic 
study suggested that in the holoparasite Rafflesia cantleyi 
(Rafflesiaceae), roughly 2% of the nuclear gene transcripts 
may have been acquired from its obligate host (Xi et al. 
2012a). In a more recent and comprehensive analysis of 
mtDNA genes, Xi et al. (2013), using NGS to investigate 
R. cantleyi and additional parasites, including two of the 
closest relatives of R. cantleyi, conservatively estimated 
that 24-41% of the gene sequences show evidence of HGT 
in Rafflesiaceae, depending on the species examined. Sig- 
nificantly, the authors stressed that most of these transgenic 
sequences possess intact reading frames and appear to be 
actively transcribed—hence these transferred genes are po- 
tentially functional. Furthermore, some of these transgenes 
maintain synteny, suggesting that insertion is not random 
and that host genes have been displaced by foreign genes, 
perhaps via homologous recombination. 
MECHANISMS OF HGT IN PLANTS 
What are the possible means by which such events can 
occur? Renner and Bellot (2012) suggested the following 
possibilities: (1) vectors, such as bacteria, fungi, or phloem- 
attacking bugs; (2) transfer of entire mitochondria through 
plasmodesmata, facilitated by plant-to-plant contact; (3) il- 
legitimate pollination followed by elimination of most for- 
eign DNA except for a few mitochondria that might fuse 
with native mitochondria; and (4) natural transformation.

transfer in plants (see also Bergthorsson et al. 2003),

trichopoda, shown linearized and abutted (see vertical arrows). Shown here are regions of inferred organellar origin for which the ancestry was assignable (key: 
mt = mitochondrial; pt = plastid). Full-height boxes indicate genes. Half-height boxes indicate tracts of native and angiosperm-HGT DNA. Labeled black lines indicate 
mitochondrial genomes or partial genomes that have been horizontally transferred to Amborella. (Figure and legend modified from Rice et al. 2013; courtesy of 
D. Rice and J. Palmer.) 
Renner and Bellot (2012) noted that the actual number of 
cases is weighted heavily by the large number of Amborella 
mtDNA genes putatively acquired from other angiosperms 
and mosses (e.g., Bergthorsson et al. 2004; Rice et al. 2013) 
(Fig. 15.10). Given the large number of events of HGT in- 
volving this one plant species, we begin with Amborella. 
The extent of proposed HGT in Amborella is incredible: 
the mtDNA of Amborella is huge (3.9 Mb), and the genome 
contains “six genome equivalents of foreign mitochondrial 
DNA, acquired from green algae, mosses, and other angio- 
sperms. Many of these horizontal transfers were large, in- 
cluding acquisition of entire mitochondrial genomes from 
three green algae and one moss” (Rice et al. 2013; p. 1468) 
(Fig. 15.10). It remains unclear if Amborella is just a spe- 
cial case, or if there are other angiosperms with similar sto- 
ries of massive HGT to the mtDNA genome. This is an 
important area of future study—only additional analyses 
of mtDNA genomes will address this question. 
It is also noteworthy that at least seven of the examples 
reviewed by Renner and Bellot (2012) involve parasitic 
plants. The close connection of host and parasite must fa- 
cilitate HGT events in plants. HGT has occurred in a num- 
ber of phylogenetically distinct plant clades with parasites. 
Examples include an mtDNA intron in Rafflesia (Rafflesia- 
ceae) (Davis and Wurdack 2004; Barkman et al. 2007) and 
mtDNA genes in Pilostyles (Apodanthaceae) (Barkman 
et al. 2007), Cuscuta (Convolvulaceae), Mitrastemon (Mi- 
trastemonaceae) (Barkman et al. 2007), and several genera 
of Orobanchaceae (e.g., Mower et al. 2004, 2010). 
There are also examples of mtDNA HGT that do not 
involve parasites, and some of these involve angiosperms as 
well as other plants. These include the transfer of mtDNA 
genes to the asterid Actinidia from an unspecified monocot 
(Bergthorsson et al. 2003) and to the gymnosperm Gnetum 
from an unknown asterid (Won and Renner 2003). Also 
reported is the transfer from an angiosperm to a fern: an 
mtDNA intron in Botrychium (grape fern; Ophioglossales 
in the fern clade) from an unknown member of Lorantha- 
ceae (Davis et al. 200Sa). 
Several mtDNA genes have been transferred: 
rps2, 
rps11, matR, atp1, and atp6. Introns of mtDNA genes have 
also resulted from HGT events, including the mad1 second 
intron and the cox1 intron, which may have experienced 
multiple HGT events (reviewed in Renner and Bellot 2012). 
In most of the examples of HGT involving mtDNA genes, 
the transferred genes are present in the mtDNA genome of 
the host and typically are nonfunctional. Several instances 
of chimeric mtDNA sequences involving the host mtDNA 
and foreign DNA copies have also been reported (Barkman 
et al. 2007; Hao et al. 2010; Mower et al. 2010; see Renner 
and Bellot 2012). 
CASE STUDIES IN HGT: NUCLEAR 
AND PLASTID GENES 
There are only a few examples of plant-to-plant HGT that 
involve nuclear genes. One of the better known involves 
Striga hermonthica, a parasitic plant (witchweed; Oro- 
banchaceae) in which a nuclear gene was likely obtained 
via HGT from a monocot host plant (Yoshida et al. 2010). 
A more recent example involves the apparent HGT of a 
neochrome gene from hornworts to ferns; significantly, this 
gene transfer may have then played a significant role in the 

subsequent diversification of modern ferns (Ligt al. 2014). 
As larger datasets of nuclear genes are acquired for more 
lineages via NGS, it will be possible to assess better the 
extent of the transfer of nuclear genes (as well as genes in 
general) via HGT. 
The plastid genome seems to be rarely inyolved in HGT 
events, with the exception of frequent cases of plastid 
transfer between species via introgression. In a recent re- 
view, Huang and Yue (2013, p. 16) noted, “HGT in plastid 
genomes, though relatively rare, still exists” (see also Smith 
2014 and Gao et al. 2014). An exciting finding indicated 
the possible conversion of functional mtDNA genes (atp1) 
by the homologous atpA gene from the plastid. Nine such 
cases have been reviewed (see Hao and Palmer 2009). 
Angiosperm genomes are dynamic, with fluctuations 
in size mediated by a host of mechanisms. Here we have 
Genome Size 
395 
summarized patterns of genome size evolution across the 
angiosperms and addressed mechanisms of both genome 
expansion and contraction. Despite growing resources on 
genome size, such data are currently available for only ap- 
proximately 2-3% of all angiosperm species, hampering 
the development of hypotheses to explain and understand 
patterns of genome 
size dynamics. Additional genome 
size measurements, perhaps via development of high- 
throughput and collaborative methods, are needed to aid 
our understanding of genome size evolution and to provide 
a foundation for prioritizing species for genome sequencing 
(e.g., Galbraith et al. 2011). An enhanced perspective on 
phylogenetic patterns of genome size, coupled with contin- 
ued investigation of HGT, will allow further analysis and 
insight into factors governing the size, structure, and con- 
tent of angiosperm genomes. 

Polyploidy 
INTRODUCTION 
Biologists have long recognized that polyploidy (or whole- 
genome duplication, WGD) is a major evolutionary force 
in plants with seminal papers dating to the early and mid- 
1900s (e.g., Muntzing 1936; Darlington 1937; Clausen 
et al. 1945; Love and Love 1949; Stebbins 1950; Lewis 
1980; Grant 1981; Levin 1983). Importantly, polyploidy 
is now recognized not just as a process restricted largely to 
plants, but also as a significant evolutionary force through- 
out eukaryotes (e.g., Mable 2003; Gregory and Mable 
2005; Husband et al. 2013). 
Genomic investigations have expanded appreciation of 
the association between WGD and evolutionary innova- 
tion. They have also played a major role in the dramatic 
modification of the longstanding polyploidy paradigm— 
that WGD is a process limited largely to plants. Genomic 
studies over the past 15 years have shown that all eukary- 
otes have genomes with considerable gene redundancy re- 
sulting in large part from ancient WGD. Diverse polyploid 
events ranging from ancient to recent have been docu- 
mented in vertebrates (e.g., Van de Peer et al. 2010; Braasch 
and Postlethwait 2012; Cafiestro 2012), fungi (Hudson 
and Conant 2012), and ciliates (Aury et al. 2006). Relying 
on the excellent review of Husband et al. (2013) that covers 
green plants, the incidence of polyploidy appears to be gen- 
erally low in liverworts, hornworts, cycads, and conifers 
(see also Ahuja 2005), but is frequent in lycophytes, ferns, 
and angiosperms. Polyploidy is also prevalent in other pho- 
tosynthetic groups, such as red algae (Husband et al. 2013). 
Until recently it was difficult to determine the actual 
frequency of polyploidy in various plant lineages. For de- 
cades, workers used chromosome counts as a proxy to es- 
timate diploidy versus polyploidy. The researcher would 
essentially provide a best guess for what the original base 
chromosome numbers might have been in a given lineage, 
and multiples of that were considered polyploids. Others 
tried to set a cut-off for which base numbers were them- 
selves the result of polyploidy. For example, some 
set 
x = 12 (see below) as the lowest number indicating that a 
group of plants had polyploidy in their ancestry. Obviously, 
such arbitrary cut-offs could be problematic. Despite many 
obvious caveats, there were numerous attempts to estimate 
the frequency of polyploidy in various land plant clades 
using these methods. The angiosperms, in particular, were 
the focus of many attempts to estimate the occurrence of 
polyploidy with this general approach. 
Stebbins (1950, 1971) estimated that ~30-35% of an- 
giosperm species had formed via polyploidy. This estimate 
was one of the lowest suggested from that time period, but 
it differs from many others in that Stebbins was speaking 
about speciation that involved a change in ploidy, whereas 
others were concerned with the percentage of angiosperms 
that had polyploidy in their ancestry. This would result in 
different percentages because the former was concerned 
with formation and the latter with total numbers; a spe- 
cies may form via polyploidy (and so be included in Steb- 
bins’s estimate) but then undergo diversification, leading 
to a clade of perhaps hundreds of species with polyploidy 
in their background, but only one instance of involvement 
of polyploidy in speciation, which was Stebbins’s focus. In 
what were among the earliest estimates for the percentage 
of angiosperms with polyploidy in their ancestry, Miintzing 
(1936) and Darlington (1937) speculated that roughly 

50% of all angiosperm species were polyploid, To under- 
stand the variation in estimates among authors, it is impor- 
tant to understand the limitations of the methodology. As 
noted, estimates were based on chromosome counts and 
generally varied based on the cut-off chromosome num- 
ber used by the author for scoring species.as diploid or 
polyploid. Stebbins (1971, p. 124) suggested that “all gen- 
era or families with x = 12 or higher have been derived 
originally by polyploidy” and noted “that even the num- 
bers x = 10 and x = 11 may often be of polyploid deriva- 
tion.” Grant (1981) suggested the cut-off number should be 
higher and hypothesized that angiosperms with chromo- 
some numbers of 7 = 14 or higher were of polyploid origin. 
With this cut-off point, he determined that 47% of all an- 
giosperms were of polyploid origin and further proposed 
that 
58% of monocots and 43% of “dicots” (eudicots is 
a concept that came later; Chapters 3 and 8) were poly- 
ploid. In contrast, Goldblatt (1980) maintained that this 
estimate was too conservative and proposed that taxa with 
chromosome numbers above n = 9 or 10 are of polyploid 
origin. He calculated that at least 70-80% of monocots 
have polyploidy in their ancestry. Lewis (1980) applied an 
approach similar to Goldbiatt’s to “dicots” and estimated 
that 70-80% were polyploid. Masterson (1994) used the 
novel approach. of comparing leaf guard cell size in fossil 
and extant taxa from a few angiosperm families (Platana- 
ceae, Lauraceae, Magnoliaceae) to estimate occurrence of 
polyploidy through time. With this method, she estimated 
that 70% of all angiosperms had experienced one or more 
episodes of polyploidy in their evolutionary history. 
The modern approaches to answering these questions 
rely on genomic data analyzed within a phylogenetic con- 
text. Operating on a similar basis to Stebbins’s original esti- 
mate, Wood et al. (2009) estimated that 15% of speciation 
events for flowering plants and 31% for ferns directly in- 
volve a change in ploidy. Other investigators have similarly 
proposed that polyploid speciation is much more frequent 
than widely appreciated (e.g., Soltis et al. 2007d; Ramsey 
and Schemske 1998, 2002). 
Genomic data have made it possible to avoid the use 
of chromosome number per se, which can be highly mis- 
leading. A major surprise was that the complete genome se- 
quence of Arabidopsis revealed evidence for three polyploid 
events (Vision et al. 2000; Bowers et al. 2003). However, 
Arabidopsis thaliana with its small genome size and low 
chromosome number (v = 5) had been considered a typical 
diploid plant—which is in large part why it was chosen as 
the first plant for complete sequencing. Similarly, the com- 
plete nuclear genome of rice (Oryza sativa; Poaceae) con- 
tained evidence for polyploidy in a plant with a chromo- 
some number (n = 12) considered by many to represent a 
model “diploid ” plant (Paterson et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2005). 
Polyploidy 397 
Genomic data also revealed a high level of gene redun- 
dancy that may result from multiple episodes of polyploidy. 
The crop Brassica napus was formed relatively recently 
(~7500 years ago) via allotetraploidy. When recent genome 
doubling events are considered together with a series of 
more ancient polyploidizations that occurred deeper in 
Brassicaceae, Brassicales, eudicots, and before the origin of 
the angiosperms, the number of genome doubling events 
involved is considerable. Chalhoub et al. (2014) estimated 
that the combined series of WGD events resulted in an ag- 
gregate 72X genome multiplication in B. napus since the 
origin of the flowering plants and, even considering loss of 
some duplicates, a very high overall duplicated gene con- 
tent. Multiple rounds of genome doubling, however, have 
not resulted in substantial increases in the number of re- 
tained genes. Genomic data reveal considerable gene loss 
following multiple rounds of WGD, as in the genome of 
Utricularia gibba (Ibarra-Laclette et al. 2013), discussed in 
more detail below. 
GENOMIC INSIGHTS INTO FREQUENCY 
OF ANCIENT POLYPLOIDY 
Over the past decade, the availability of powerful genomic 
tools has made it possible to obtain not only novel insights 
into polyploidy as a process (e.g., Doyle et al. 2008; Soltis 
and Soltis 2009; D. Soltis et al. 2009; Grover et al. 2012; 
Madlung and Wendel 2013), but also much more precise 
estimates of the timing and frequency of ancient polyploidy 
in the ancestry of extant species. Continued progress in es- 
tablishing the framework of angiosperm phylogeny has 
been critical for pinpointing where ancient polyploidy has 
occurred on the plant tree of life. This progress has acceler- 
ated in recent years, and undoubtedly we will see enormous 
continued progress in the years to come with the steady im- 
provement of NGS technology, as well as rapidly decreas- 
ing costs. 
Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that 
polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also sug- 
gest the presence of many major ancient WGD events (e.g., 
Van de Peer et al. 2009, 2010; D. Soltis et al. 2009). Indeed, 
the question is no longer what percent of angiosperms are 
polyploid, but how many WGD events occurred in any 
given lineage (D. Soltis et al. 2009). In this regard, at least 
50 independent ancient WGDs are distributed across flow- 
ering plant phylogeny (Cui et al. 2006; D. Soltis et al. 2009; 
Van de Peer et al. 2009; M. S. Barker et al., University of 
Arizona, pers. comm.); we cover some of the major events 
below with a summary given in Fig. 16.1. However, addi- 
tional events are being discovered on a regular basis, and

Ancient polyploidy events in seed plants. A simple summary of ancient polyploidy events with a focus on angiosperms. Nearly all taxa listed have 
completely sequenced nuclear genomes, although “Bataceae + others” are included as a placeholder to help illustrate the placement of B in Brassicales (see text and 
Fig. 16.2). The summary phylogeny is from Soltis et al. (2011). Some of the prominent ancient polyploidy events that have been designated with Greek letters are so 
indicated here (modified from CoGe website). 

current understanding of paleopolyploidy evengs in angio- 
sperm history can be found at the Comparative Genomics 
(CoGe) website (http://genomevolution.org/CoGe/). 
Before the origin of the angiosperms as well as within 
the angiosperms, genomic data now indicate many ancient 
WGD events; many of these appear to be associated with 
the origins of major subclades. Some of these have been 
given Greek symbols (letters), which seem confusing to 
many researchers and hard to remember. We include those 
that have been used commonly in the literature for some 
of the most prominent WGD events as a point of reference 
(Fig. 16.1). It is perhaps a hopeless task to continue giving 
this sort of recognition to all published polyploid events; 
for example, in Nicotiana (Solanaceae), there are seven sep- 
arate documented cases of polyploidy (Chase et al. 2003). 
Those involving large clades are worth noting, but it is clear 
that in angiosperms, polyploidy is ubiquitous. 
Significantly, all angiosperm genomes sequenced to date 
exhibit evidence of ancient polyploidy. Genomic data also 
indicate that an ancient WGD event preceded the origin of 
all extant angiosperms, an event sometimes referred to as 
epsilon or e (Jiao et al. 2011; Amborella Genome Project 
2013), indicating that all living angiosperms are of ancient 
polyploid origin. This finding raises an important question: 
did WGD contribute to the success of the flowering plants? 
Genomic data also suggest an older WGD event that is as- 
sociated with the origin of all extant seed plants, referred to 
as zeta or € (Jiao et al. 2011). 
Two successive and perhaps closely associated WGDs 
apparently occurred during early eudicot evolution (Jiao 
et al. 2012; Chanderbali et al. 2017; gamma event, y); 
these events are often referred to as a triplication, implying 
a single event, but as has been described from bread wheat, 
Triticum aestivum (e.g., Salamini et al. 2002; Marcussen 
et al. 2014; The International Wheat Genome Sequencing 
Consortium 2014), hexaploidy is a consequence of two 
rounds of genome doubling. Rather than simply referring 
to a triplication event as y, perhaps the hexaploid ancestor 
of all core eudicots should be characterized as a product of 
y1 and y2, indicating two events close in time. These events 
are correlated with and perhaps in some way directly as- 
sociated with the core eudicot radiation (70% of all angio- 
sperm species; Chapter 8). However, the precise location 
of these events on the angiosperm tree of life is unknown, 
although Ming et al. (2013) raised the possibility of one 
WGD before divergence of the Nelumbo and core eudicot 
lineages and one WGD afterwards, but the predivergence 
WGD could be explained by either incomplete sorting of 
retained ancestral variation (e.g., Jones et al. 2013) or error 
in tree estimation. 
Genomic studies have pinpointed two WGD events in 
Polyploidy 
399 
Brassicales (Figs. 16.1, 16.2). One event (alpha or a) is 
associated with the origin of Brassicaceae (Schranz et al. 
2011). A second event (beta or B) occurred deeper in Bras- 
sicales; following Schranz et al. (2011), this WGD appears 
to have occurred just after the branch to Limnanthaceae 
and prior to the origin of the subclade containing Koe- 
berliniaceae, 
Bataceae, 
Salvadoraceae, 
Emblingiaceae, 
Pentadiplandraceae, Resedaceae, Gyrostemonaceae, Tova- 
riaceae, Capparaceae, Cleomaceae, and Brassicaceae (see 
Chapter 10; Fig. 16.2). Note that the coverage of families 
in Schranz et al. (2011) does not reflect the current treat- 
ment presented in Chapters 10 and 12 (we have updated 
Fig. 16.2 accordingly). 
There are also a number of major WGD events in the 
monocots. In fact, some authors have suggested that one 
ancient polyploid event (tau or 7; Jiao et al. 2014) may be 
associated with the origin of the monocots (Paterson et al. 
2012). However, because of the limited sampling of mono- 
cots, it remains unclear as to where t occurred. The event 
is known to be present in the commelinid clade sampled 
to date, and this is where we have placed the event (Jiao 
et al. 2014; Fig. 16.1). Analyses are needed for more mono- 
cot lineages to determine whether the event characterizes 
all monocots. Within the monocots, two WGD events are 
closely associated with the origin of the grass family (Poa- 
ceae); these are referred to as sigma or o and rho or p (see 
Fig. 16.1) (Paterson et al. 2004, 2012; D’Hont et al. 2012; 
Jiao et al. 2014). Other ancient WGD events were detected 
in the genomes of Musa (Musaceae) and Phoenix (Areca- 
ceae) (D’Hont et al. 2012; Jiao et al. 2014) (Fig. 16.1). More 
sampling and analyses are needed to determine where these 
WGD events occurred. Where does the earliest event identi- 
fied in the Musa genome occur on the monocot tree? Does 
the event identified in Phoenix occur in a common ancestor 
of all palms? 
The origins of several families are also associated with 
WGD events. Poaceae and Brassicaceae were noted above. 
Other examples include the origin of Asteraceae (Barker 
et al. 2008), Solanaceae (The Tomato Genome Consortium 
2012), Cleomaceae (Schranz and Mitchell-Olds 2006), and 
papilionoid legumes (Papilionoideae or Faboideae; Can- 
non et al. 2015). Some of these examples, as well as others, 
could be discussed in much more detail to highlight the 
prevalence of polyploidy, but we are only briefly touching 
on these here. For example, the origin of Asteraceae ap- 
pears to coincide with several ancient polyploidy events, 
with additional ancient events associated with some of 
the major subclades within this large family. Interestingly, 
Asteraceae also have two well-documented examples of 
young (less than 200 years old) polyploids (Hegarty et al. 
2012; Soltis et al. 2012), making it an excellent test case

for investigating polyploidy over a continuum of ages from 
40 million years (age of the family) to 40 generations (age 
of new Tragopogon polyploids). The complete genome se- 
quence for Arabidopsis thaliana provided evidence for 
three WGD events, termed a, B, and y (Vision et al. 2000; 
Bowers et al. 2003). The most recent of these events is 
a, which characterizes most Brassicaceae and is distinct 
from an independent event in Cleomaceae (Schranz and 
Mitchell Olds-2006; Schmidt and Bancroft 2011). Based 
on chromosome numbers, it was long thought that an 
ancient polyploid event characterized part of Solanaceae 
(reviewed in D. Soltis et al. 2009). Complete genome se- 
quencing of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) confirmed 
this, revealing that the tomato lineage has experienced two 
different genome “triplication” events. One of these is now 
known to be shared by most eudicots (see above; Jiao et al. 
2012), but there is also a more recent one (The Tomato 
Genome Consortium 2012). As noted, triplication events 
are likely not single events but two polyploidy events in 
close succession.

The placement of the a and B WGD 
events in Brassicales (modified from Schranz et al. 2011). 
The events reviewed above, as well as the ~50 that have 
been noted to date for angiosperms, certainly represent 
only the beginning in terms of ancient WGDs in flower- 
ing plants. With the explosion of genomic analyses, the 
next five to ten years will see more accurate placements 
of known events, as well as the discovery of many other 
WGD events. Complete genome sequences are not required 
to estimate WGD events. Lynch and Conery (2000) pro- 
posed a genomic-scale approach to estimate the occur- 
rence and age of gene duplication events by assessing the 
frequency distribution of per-site synonymous divergence 
levels (Ks) for pairs of duplicate genes. Analyses of Ks plots 
have been useful in suggesting ancient WGD events (see 
Cui et al. 2006; Lynch and Conery 2000; Blanc and Wolfe 
2004; Schlueter et al. 2004). Recent analyses of Ks plots 
generated using large genomic resources such as data from 
the 1000 plant transcriptome project (1KP) continue to 
reveal additional WGD events. These results suggest, for 
example, that multiple ancient polyploid events occurred 
within Lamiaceae (Godden et al. unpubl.); multiple events 

are also evident within Laurales and Magnolialgs (Cui et al. 
2006).

DOES POLYPLOIDY PROMOTE 
DIVERSIFICATION? 
A question that has long been of interest is—do poly- 
ploid events promote a burst of speciation or diversifica- 
tion? There has been an interesting and stimulating recent 
debate on this subject. Mayrose et al. (2011) and Arrigo 
and Barker (2012) examined phylogenies at the genus 
level (usually) and concluded that polyploid lineages have 
higher extinction rates than diploid lineages. Based on 
these results, Arrigo and Barker (2012, p. 140) revived the 
old view of Stebbins (1950) and Wagner (1970), referring 
to “rarely successful” polyploid lineages and stating that 
“most (polyploidy lineages) are evolutionary dead-ends.” 
Certainly new polyploids go extinct regularly at the pop- 
ulation level, but a question that remains is, what is the 
fate of established polyploid species? Are they really more 
prone to extinction? Soltis et al. (2013, 2014a) pointed to 
numerous flaws in the logic and arguments of Mayrose 
et al. (2011, 2014) and Arrigo and Barker (2012). It is also 
noteworthy that using the Mayrose et al. (2011) methods, 
Zhan et al. (2014) found the opposite for fish—polyploids 
actually diversify more than diploids. One of the points of 
Soltis et al. (2014a) was that the sample sizes in Mayrose 
et al. (2011) were small and not broadly representative of 
angiosperms. A study of 63 of ~14,000 angiosperm genera 
(a clade of 350,000-400,000 species) as in Mayrose et al. 
(2011) is not enough to make strong generalizations re- 
garding the fate of polyploid lineages. This poor sampling 
issue, coupled with the methodological problems of May- 
rose et al. (2011), as well as the contrasting results of Zhan 
et al. (2014) indicate that broad generalizations regarding 
the fate cf polyploids (as in Arrigo and Barker 2012) are 
simply premature. Much more work is needed. 
Increased focus on the mechanisms that might increase 
(or decrease) diversification of polyploid lineages rela- 
tive to diploid lineages should improve understanding of 
the role of polyploidy in diversification. For example, the 
Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model of the evolution of 
genetic incompatibility among allopolyploid populations 
(Orr 1996) may spur diversification immediately following 
genome doubling whereas sustained increase in diversifica- 
tion of a polyploid lineage may be due to the evolutionary 
innovations such as the flower (Jiao et al. 2011; Amborella 
Genome Project 2013) or nodulation and symbiotic nitro- 
gen fixation (e.g., Cannon et al. 2015). Future research on 
Polyploidy 401 
the genes contributing to genetic incompatibilities and evo- 
lutionary innovations will help elucidate the role of poly- 
ploidy in diversification. 
Another approach to examine the fate of polyploid 
lineages is to use big phylogenies and place ancient WGD 
events on these megatrees. Using genomic data, researchers 
have identified and pinpointed where many WGD events 
occurred on the angiosperm tree of life. These well-marked 
events provide the opportunity to investigate whether there 
are correspondences between WGD events and major 
bursts in species richness—the role of polyploidy in diver- 
sification. Soltis et al. (2014a,b) recently reviewed the topic 
and found that many ancient WGDs when placed on a phy- 
logenetic tree are indeed associated with key diversification 
events in flowering plants. Many of these have already 
been noted and include the origins of angiosperms, eudi- 
cots, and Poaceae. Examination by eye—plotting polyploid 
events on phylogenetic trees for several families, including 
Poaceae and Solanaceae—suggested that ancient WGD was 
followed by a burst in speciation (D. Soltis et al. 2009). 
However, in many cases polyploidy was not immediately 
associated with a burst in species richness, which occurred 
several nodes later. Schranz et al. (2012) referred to this 
pattern as a “lag” and further noted that ancient polyploidy 
may be associated with an increase in plant diversity in 
other families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Cleomaceae, Fa- 
baceae). This lag can be seen associated with several major 
polyploid events, including the origin of the angiosperms 
(Fig. 16.3); Schranz et al. (2012) noted this lag as well for 
Brassicaceae and suggested (p. 147) that “ultimate success 
of the crown group does not only involve the WGD and 
novel key traits, but largely subsequent evolutionary phe- 
nomena including later migration events, changing envi- 
ronmental conditions and/or differential extinction rates.” 
Another explanation for the putative lag is that before the 
benefits of polyploidy can take effect, the deleterious phe- 
nomena associated with recent polyploidy (genomic shock, 
gene copy number imbalances, etc.) have to be eliminated 
by diploidization, which may take several million years (De 
Smet et al. 2013). As discussed above, more research on 
the mechanisms contributing to increased diversification is 
necessary. 
The methods of D. Soltis et al. (2009) and Schranz et al. 
(2012) were simple approaches, simply plotting WGD on 
trees and looking at the number of species that appeared 
afterwards. More recently, using a very large phylogenetic 
tree for angiosperms, Tank et al. (2015) used a novel ap- 
proach and demonstrated with statistically significant sup- 
port that several major ancient polyploid events are closely 
correlated with major bursts in diversification (Fig. 16.4). 
These include the origin of angiosperms, eudicots, mono-

The diversification lag. Following WGD (stars) there may be a lag before diversification actually starts (modified from Schranz et al. 2012 and Soltis 
et al. 2014). This yields a phylogenetic pattern in which clades closest to the WGD event are small in size, ultimately followed by larger clades. 
cots, and Asteraceae, and the 8 event within Brassicales. 
Some of these diversification bursts did not coincide exactly 
with the WGD event, but instead occurred a few nodes sub- 
sequent to that at which the WGD occurred, providing evi- 
dence for the “lag” effect. Improvements in the resolution 
of species phylogenies and associated estimation of diver- 
gence times and character evolution will help elucidate the 
length of these lags and the evolutionary changes occurring 
between genome duplication events and increased rates of 
diversification. 
Many more phylogenomic analyses of evolutionary dy- 
namics following WGD events are needed—there may be 
no single answer, but variation exists from group to group. 
In this regard, Estep et al. (2014) investigated polyploidy 
and diversification of the grass tribe Andropogoneae, 
which possesses numerous polyploids. At least 32% of the 
species sampled are allopolyploids. Using a large tree, Es- 
tep et al. (2014) found no evidence that polyploidy was 
followed by a net increase in diversification, although al- 
lopolyploidy is clearly a major mode of speciation in the 
clade. 
ANCIENT POLYPLOIDY AND THE 
CRETACEOUS-TERTIARY BOUNDARY. 
Faweett et al. (2009) dated WGD events using genomic 
data and noted that a number of ancient polyploid events 
occurred at the same time (~65 mya) in several diverse an- 
giosperm lineages. This timing is close to the K-T bound- 
ary; they proposed that preexisting WGDs helped numer- 
ous plant lineages survive the K-T mass extinction (now 
known 
as the Cretaceous-Paleogene 
[K-Pg] extinction 
event). More examples of this association were provided 
by Vanneste et al. (2014), who built a stronger case for this 
association, noting that there was evidence for this rela- 
tionship across 41 plant genomes from diverse lineages rep- 
resenting a number of families (Fig. 16.5). 
It is often assumed that polyploidy must confer some 
type of advantage, and polyploidy has therefore been sug- 
gested to be the driver of diversification events (e.g., Levin 
1983; Tank et al. 2015) or the reason behind survival of 
some lineages over others following the K-T (K-Pg) mass 

extinction event (Fawcett et al. 2009; Vannesteet al. 2014). 
However, Meyers and Levin (2006) provided an interest- 
ing twist on the idea that polyploidy confers “advantages.” 
Rather than searching for “advantages” of polyploids to 
explain their high frequency as many other researchers 
have done, Meyers and Levin (2006, p. 1198) took a dif- 
ferent approach and hypothesized that the abundance of 
polyploids may be the result of “a simple ratcheting pro- 
Polyploidy 
403 
cess that does not require evolutionary advantages due to 
the biological properties of organisms.” They show that the 
average ploidy within a lineage can continue to increase to 
the levels seen today, “even if there are ecological or physi- 
ological disadvantages to higher ploidy.” However, this sce- 
nario does not take into account other aspects of what we 
now know about what happens subsequent to formation of 
polyploid plants, so we think that this ratchet effect, while

Use of a large phylogenetic tree for angiosperms to assess whether increased diversification accompanies WGD events. Collapsed clades are drawn 
as triangles proportional to family-level species richness. Stars = WGD events; circ es show the location of increases in net diversification rate (r). Shades of color 
within circles reflect magnitudes of change in r from the immediate phylogenetic background to the shifted lineage, averaged across the distribution of bootstrap 
replicates; darker shades are associated with greater magnitudes of shifts. Size of circles indicates shift support as the relative frequency of trees in the distribution 
for which MEDUSA recovers a given shifted lineage. For some WGD events there is a significant association (arrows). Polyploidization is perfectly associated with 
an increase in diversification for Asteraceae and when Commelinidae + Asparagales was used as one of the putative placements of the + event. Other polyploidiza- 
tion nodes show delayed diversification upticks: Angiospermae, Gunneridae, the monocot t event (some of the placements), and all placements of the Brassicales 
B event. Modified from Tank et al. (2015).

GENOME EVOLUTION: FRACTIONATION 
FOLLOWING WGD 
One of the more intriguing genome processes that occurs 
following polyploidy is genome fractionation—the loss 
of genes from one or the other parental genome follow- 
ing genome doubling. Lynch and Conery (2000) examined 
the evolutionary fate of duplicate genes and found that 
most gene duplicates are silenced within just a few million 
years—they further suggested that the stochastic silencing 
of duplicate genes may play a significant role in evolution. 
The process of fractionation at a simple tetraploid level 
is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 16.6. A superb example 
of this process in action is seen in the carnivorous plant 
Utricularia gibba (bladderwort; Lentibulariaceae). The ge- 
nome of this plant is very small (82 megabases). Despite 
its small size, the genome is the result of multiple WGD 
events, so this summary is also relevant to that discussion. 
Importantly, this finding is in line with many other studies 
that demonstrate that genome size and levels of polyploidy 
are often unrelated; soon after their formation, polyploids 
undergo episodes of reduction in genome size (Leitch and 
Bennett 2004). Genomic analyses of synteny indicate that 
U. gibba has experienced three sequential WGD events 
since its shared common ancestry with tomato (Solanum; 
Solanaceae) and grape (Vitis; Vitaceae) (Ibarra-Laclette 
et al. 2013). These analyses indicate that the genome of

Fractionation following WGD. (a) In this simple example the 
initial diploid genome has 10 genes. Following one WGD (b) there are 20 genes 
in the tetraploid, which is then shown to fractionate into 16 genes (c). Figure 
and legend modified from Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2013). 
U. gibba is 8x compared to the core eudicot ancestor, which 
is already considered palaeohexaploid (reviewed above; 
Jiao et al. 2012; see Ibarra-Laclette et al. 2013) (Fig. 16.6). 
When Ibarra-Laclette et al. (2013) compared the genome 
of U. gibba to that of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), they 
found evidence for highly fractionated gene loss in U. gibba 
despite the numerous rounds of polyploidy. Almost two- 
thirds of the syntenic genes shared with S. lycopersicum 
appear to have been returned to single copy in U. gibba; 
however, these losses were spread across the different com- 
ponent genomes. This reduction in genes to something ap- 
proaching the diploid condition is found in the 13 poly- 
ploid genomes studied by De Smet et al. (2013). This type 
of reduction in genes and chromosome number in many 
groups of herbaceous plants, particularly pronounced in 
annual taxa, is suggestive of selection being the driving 
force behind these processes, given its consistency across 
taxa after WGD. 
REPEATED PATTERNS OF 
GENE RETENTION AND LOSS 
FOLLOWING POLYPLOIDY 
Broad comparisons of angiosperm and even broader com- 
parisons of eudicot genomes have provided the opportu- 
Polyploidy 
405 
nity to address the fate of duplicated genes following WGD. 
Significantly, these broad genomic comparisons indicate a 
consistent pattern of gene loss/retention following poly- 
ploidization. Therefore, there may be some basic rules that 
govern the fate of duplicated genes following WGD (Pater- 
son et al. 2006). Although most duplicated genes are lost 
following gene and genome duplications (Lynch and Con- 
ery 2000), maintenance of some genes in duplicate could 
occur as a consequence of copy number imbalances and 
neofunctionalization/subfunctionalization, and these could 
ultimately impact features of the organism itself (Freeling 
and Thomas 2006). Conversely, duplications of some genes 
may be deleterious. Studies in Asteraceae have compared 
gene retention after ancient events, 40-50 mya, with pat- 
terns of loss in young polyploids that are only 40 genera- 
tions old (Buggs et al. 2011). 
The De Smet et al. (2013) analysis described above doc- 
umented consistent patterns of gene loss associated with 
structural and house-keeping genes, whereas those associ- 
ated with plastid/mitochondrial functions and gene regu- 
lation (e.g., transcription factors) are maintained in mul- 
tiple copies. Similar results have been observed by others 
in other genomic comparisons (e.g., Birchler 2012; Maere 
et al. 2005; Freeling et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2013). Reten- 
tion of genes following duplication is hypothesized to be 
the result of both subfunctionalization and neofunctional- 
ization (e.g., Force et al. 1999), but these processes may 
be difficult to distinguish for several reasons, including 
incomplete knowledge of ancestral function. In addition, 
although many instances of subfunctionalization have been 
documented (e.g., Gossypium), fewer cases of neofunc- 
tionalization have been reported. Perhaps what is being 
observed in recent studies is the effect of selection operat- 
ing to eliminate extra gene copies that do not convey an 
advantage (including selectively neutral duplicated copies). 
Studies documenting that selection is active in polyploids 
resulting in diploidization and the loss and retention of 
particular categories of duplicated genes suggest that the 
ratchet process (above) may not completely govern the oc- 
currence of polyploidy in angiosperms.

Descriptions of Major Clades 
In the following descriptions of orders and major supra- 
ordinal clades, in parallel format, putative synapomorphies 
are indicated in bold and other useful diagnostic charac- 
ters in italics. Characters found only rarely within the de- 
scribed taxa/clades are usually not mentioned. Descriptions 
are provided only for clades containing more than a single 
family, and style and format of the descriptions follow 
Judd et al. (2008). Note that under the ICN, the author- 
ity of a name stands, despite the circumscription of that 
named group adopted by the authors of this volume. Thus, 
for example, Magnoliidae Takhtajan is correct despite the 
fact his concept of Magnoliidae is very different from our 
own phylogenetic concept, which is defined formally as 
Magnoliidae W.S. Judd, P.S. Soltis & D.E. Soltis in Can- 
tino et al. (2007) under the proposed PhyloCode. How- 
ever, given that the PhyloCode names have not yet been 
validly published, here we follow the ICN for all names 
except those names that exist only under the proposed Phy- 
loCode and were proposed as rankless; in those cases, we 
use the authorities from the treatments in Cantino et al. 
(2007) and the as-yet-unpublished Companion Volume to 
the PhyloCode.

parasitizing the tree on which they are growing), the veg- 
etative body typical or much reduced, external to the host 
or internal and ramifying within the host, producing emer-

not mycorrhizal; crystals various; parenchymatous tissues 

434 Descriptions of Major Clades 
often with yellow to red betalains (possible synapomor- 
phy of core Caryophyllineae, but not in Macarthuria), but 
sometimes with anthocyanins or neither of these pigments, 
sometimes with acetogenic naphthaquinones (e.g., plum- 
bagin, occasionally with sclereids; a synapomorphy of 
Polygonineae); stems often with successive cambia (pro- 
ducing concentric rings or bundles of xylem and phloem; 
synapomorphy of Caryophyllineae), occasionally with cor-

monoecious or dioecious), usually radial, sometimes with a 
short to elongate hypanthium, with perianth differentiated 
(of calyx and corolla), in 2 whorls, but the petals early lost 
in the evolutionary history of this clade, so many have only 
tepals (characteristic of most Caryophyllineae), in 1 or 
2 whorls or spirally arranged, although a seemingly biseri- 
ate perianth has re-evolved by recruitment of other floral 
plant parts into the “perianth” (i.e., “petals” from stami- 
nodia, “sepals” from a pair of bracts) or by an increase in 
the number of tepals followed by differentiation of the in- 
ner ones from the outer ones, the flower sometimes sunken 
into the apex of a modified stem (most Cactaceae) or as- 
sociated with often accrescent bracts or bracteoles and in 
some 2 bracteoles appearing to be a calyx, occasionally

well developed), or with as many styles as carpels, or gy- 
noecium represented by only a single carpel, then style

sometimes with accessory tissue derived from the stem, 
— 
in which the flower is sunken), with axile, parietal, free- 
central, or basal placentation; stigmas minute to capitate,

the length of the style or style-branch (a synapomorphy of 
Caryophyllineae). Ovules anatropous to campylotropous 
(synapomorphy of core Caryophyllineae) or orthotropous, 
with 2 integuments (rarely a single integument), with a 
thick to thin nucellus (but ovules always crassinucellate), 
1 to numerous per carpel. Nectary a disk, ring of glands, 
pits, ring on inner surface of hypanthium, or nectar pro- 
duced by glandular adaxial staminal bases (synapomor- 
phy of core Caryophyllineae), or absent. Fruit a variably 
dehiscent capsule, berry (sometimes spiny), utricle, achene 
or nut, often associated with fleshy or dry, sometimes pa- 
pery or winged perianth parts or bracts, or sometimes 
enclosed in persistent, leathery to fleshy, basal portion of 
perianth tube (which may have sticky gland-headed or 
hooked hairs); seeds sometimes with ornamented testa (in- 
dividual cells clearly visible, bulging), sometimes arillate or 
hairy, rarely winged, the embryo straight to curved, but in 
core Caryopbyllineae always curved; endosperm present 
(homogeneous to rarely ruminate, often starchy) to absent, 
often replaced by starchy perisperm (synapomorphy of 
core Caryophyllineae).

ERICALES BERCHT. & J. PRESL 
Trees, shrubs, lianas (usually scrambling or weakly twin- 
ing), and herbs, sometimes rhizomatous, rarely carnivo- 
rous (then with leaf modifications, i.e., pitcher-like traps 
or leaves with gland-headed hairs), rarely parasitic or my- 
coparasitic; crystals various solitary, styloids, or druses, 
sometimes also with silica bodies; parenchymatous tissues 
sometimes with sclereids, laticifers (milky sap), or secretory 
cavities containing yellow to red resinous materials, and 
then appearing as yellow-green, red, brown, or black dots 
to lines (on leaves, stems, and floral parts), occasionally 
with wandering fibers, rarely with mucilage canals; stems 
sometimes with cortical vascular bundles; black or dark- 
colored naphthaquinones occasionally present (in nearly 
all tissues). Hairs extremely diverse. Leaves alternate and 
spiral or 2-ranked, less commonly opposite and decussate 
or whorled, borne along the stem, clustered at shoot apices, 
or occasionally in a basal rosette, usually simple, but oc- 
casionally lobed to dissected or even pinnately compound, 
entire to variously toothed, and the teeth (when present) 
often theoid (with a + deciduous, opaque apical portion, or 
with an associated multicellular hair), with pinnate or less 
commonly palmate or + parallel venation, sometimes with 
domatia, sometimes with nectar glands on abaxial surface 
or leaf base, occasionally with yellowish to red or black 
lines and dots, rarely with persistent, spinose petiole, re- 
duced to scales in parasites; stipules absent or occasionally 
present, minute. Inflorescences determinate or indetermi- 
nate, terminal or axillary, occasionally cauliflorous, some- 
times reduced to a solitary flower (and rarely scapose). 
Flowers bisexual or unisexual (and plants then dioecious 
or less commonly monoecious or polygamous), radial or 
less commonly bilateral (due to form of perianth and/or 
androecium and gynoecium), with perianth differentiated 
(of calyx and corolla), in 2 or occasionally 3 whorls, or 
rarely of tepals (and flowers reduced, wind pollinated), 
erect to pendulous, occasionally heterostylous or resu- 
pinate. Sepals (2-) 3-8 (-11), but most commonly 4 or 5, 
distinct or connate, imbricate, valvate or with open aes- 
tivation, occasionally dimorphic, occasionally enlarged in 
fruit, with a nectar spur, or intergrading with bracts, rarely 
petaloid. Petals 3-8 (to numerous), but most commonly 
4 or 5, connate or less commonly distinct or nearly so, oc- 
casionally the 4 lower petals fused into 2 pairs, valvate or 
imbricate, sometimes contorted or convolute, occasionally 
with paired petaloid appendages (outgrowths from lower 
portion of corolla lobes), or wrinkled to lacerate along 
margins, rarely plicate, sometimes the flower pendulous 
and the corolla urn-shaped. Stamens (2-) 4 or 5 to numer- 
ous, but ancestrally 10, in 2 whorls, but with secondary in- 
crease (+ numerous) and decrease (loss of outer whorl, and 
thus stamens equaling the petals in number and opposite 
them, or loss of inner whorl, and thus stamens equaling the 
petals and alternating with them), distinct to connate (by 
filaments), sometimes fascicled, sometimes alternating with 
staminodia, or with androecium asymmetrical, prolonged 
on one side into a strap-like structure that arches over the 
ovary, formed from numerous staminodia (these produc- 
ing nectar or “feeder” pollen), staminodia also sometimes 
in carpellate flowers; filaments free (and arising from re- 
ceptacle) or adnate to corolla, short and broad to elon- 
gate, slender, occasionally with paired projections; anthers 
opening by longitudinal slits, + apical pores, or valves, the 
anther often inverting in development, occasionally with 
terminal or dorsal, paired projections; pollen grains usu- 
ally tri- to multicolporate, or 5- to 8-zonocolpate, or 4- to 
pantoporate, sometimes released in tetrads, occasionally 
with viscin threads. Carpels 2 to numerous, connate, with 
a single, sometimes hollow, short to elongate, unbranched 
to distally branched style, which is rarely distally expanded 
and shield- or umbrella-like, or rarely as many styles as 
carpels; ovary superior to inferior, sometimes with an api- 
cal depression, with axile, intruded-parietal or free-central 
placentation, the locules occasionally secondarily divided, 
the placentae small to expanded and diffuse, extending into 
the locules, or if free-central, expanded, + globose, filling or 
nearly filling the locule; stigma or stigmas minute, punctate 
to capitate, slightly elongated or + lobate. Ovules anatro- 
pous to campylotropous or rarely orthotropous, with 1 or 
2 integuments, with a thin nucellus, 1 or 2 to numerous in 
each locule, or few to numerous on free-central placenta. 
Nectary at base of filaments or around base or apex of 
ovary, a well-developed, sometimes lobate disk, or nectar 
produced by staminodia, by nectariferous spur on one of 
the sepals, or nectary absent; rarely with nectar-producing 
bracts associated with flowers. Fruit a variously dehiscent, 
dry to fleshy capsule (this rarely associated with a fleshy 
calyx), berry, drupe (and then with a single or several pits, 
and the pits single to few-seeded, occasionally with a ger- 
mination pore), indehiscent pod, samara or a schizocarp of 
nutlets; seeds occasionally with a large or depressed hilum, 
occasionally winged, occasionally arillate, the coat hard/ 
shiny to fleshy, sometimes mucilaginous, thin, or even + dis- 
appearing; embryo minute to large; endosperm present to 
absent, occasionally ruminate.

Ithough they are relative 
latecomers on the evolution- 
ary scene, having emerged only 
35-170 million years ago, angio- 
sperms—or flowering plants—are 
the most diverse and species-rich 
group of seed-producing land 
plants, comprising more than 
ER 
Xenorere) 
species. Not only are they a model 
15,000 genera and over 
group for studying the patterns and 
processes of evolutionary diversi- 
fication, they also play major roles 
in our economy, diet, and court- 
ship rituals, producing our fruits, 
legumes, and grains, not to mention 
the flowers in our Valentine’s bou- 
quets. They are also crucial ecolog- 
ically, dominating most terrestrial 
and some aquatic landscapes. 
This fully revised edition of 
Phylogeny and Evolution of the 
Angiosperms provides an up-to- 
date, comprehensive overview of 
the evolution of and relationships 
among these vital plants. Incorpo- 
rating molecular phylogenetics with 
morphological, chemical, develop- 
mental, and paleobotanical data, as 
- 
well as presenting a more detailed 
account of early angiosperm fossils 
and important fossil information 
for each evolutionary branch of the 
angiosperms, the new edition inte- 
grates fossil evidence into a robust 
phylogenetic framework. Featuring 
a wealth of new color images, this 
highly synthetic work further re- 
evaluates long-held evolutionary hy- 
potheses related to flowering plants 
and will be an essential reference for 
botanists, plant systematists, and 
evolutionary biologists alike.

PRAISE FOR THE FIRST. EDITION 
“lOne of the] most significant books on flowering plant phylogeny and systematics 
to come out in recent years... 
. This book belongs on the bookshelf of any serious 
plant systematist—it will be a valuable resource for years to come.” 
BioScience 
“Takes a unique but much néeded approach to describe the phylogeny, systemat- 
ics, and evolutionary patterns of flowering plants. The volume represents a major 
systematic contribution. 
. .. The book’s goals are to review the molecular phylog- 
eny of all flowering plants and use this information to inform systematics and our 
understanding of major evolutionary trends; in this it succeeds admirably. 
. 
. 
. I find 
it challenging to criticize this book: it is a really well-organized and well-presented 
compendium, filling an important niche... . It will be a valuable reference for every 
botanist and many ecologists, and compelling reading for anyone who works on 
plant morphology, systematics, and evolution. It will be an important source of 
ideas and phylogenetic information for future higher-level systematic and compara- 
tive studies of flowering plants.” 
Quarterly Review of Biology 
“An important and very helpful book and a must for every plant systematist.” 
Plant Systematics and Evolution 
“No endnote to a finished project, but rather, a dynamic and synoptic state-of-the- 
union of the ongoing effort by many botanists. ... 
A necessary reference... 
. It 
is encyclopedic in its treatment of the subject matter and the lengthy list of works 
cited makes it an excellent source book for anyone hoping to begin broad phyloge- 
netic study.” 
Cladistics 
“Excellent . . 
. highly recommendable for anyone involved in plant systematics.” 
Plant Science Bulletin 
“The authors present scholarly and lucid discussions of topics ranging from parallel 
and convergent evolution to the evolution of genome size and base chromosome 
number. . 
. 
. Fascinating reading, not only for the answers it provides to many . @ 
curiosities about plant evolution, Pr also for the scholarly discussion of those 
questions still awaiting answers.”
