Because time does not appear in Schrodinger's
equation
as an operator but only as a parameter,
the time-
energy uncertainty
relation
must be formulated
in a special way. This problem
has in fact been studied
by
many authors
and we give a summary
of their treatments.
We then criticize the main conclusion
of these
treatments;
viz. , that in a measurement
of energy carried out in a time interval,
ht, there must be a minimum
uncertainty
in the transfer
of energy to the observed
system,
given by 6(E'
E) &~h/n—i We
s.how that this
conclusion
is erroneous
in two respects. First, it is not consistent
with the general principles
of the quantum
theory, which require that all uncertainty
relations
be expressible
in terms of the mathematical
formalism,
i.e., by means of operators,
wave functions, etc. Secondly, the examples of measurement
processes that were
used to derive the above uncertainty
relation are not general enough. We then develop a systematic
presenta-
tion of our own point of view, with regard to the role of time in the quantum
theory,
and give a concrete
example
of a measurement
process not satisfying
the above uncertainty
relation.
1. HISTORICAL
SUMMARY
OF THE STATE OF THE
PROBLEM OF TIME MEASUREMENT
IN
THE QUANTUM
THEORY
where 1ta(x) is the eigenfunction
of the Hamiltonian
H
of the system
belonging
to the eigenvalue E, and Cz is
an arbitrary
coefficient. If we consider a wave packet of
width DE in energy space (i.e., AE is the range in which
~CE~ is appreciable),
it immediately
follows
from the
properties
of Fourier
analysis
that
(DE)r&~h, where r
is the
time
during
which
the
wave
packet
does not
change significantly
(r may be regarded as the mean life
of the state in question').
The above is a discussion
in terms of the Schrodinger
representation.
Mandelstamm
and Tamm4 have formu-
lated what is, in essence, the same point of view but it is
expressed
in the Heisenberg
representation.
They con-
sider a dynamical
variable 3, which is a function of the
time (e.g., the location of the needle on a clock dial or
the position of a free particle in motion)
and which can
therefore
be used to indicate
time. If D.4 is the un-
certainty
in 3, then the uncertainty
in time is
Sf= ZA/
~ (A),(,
provided
that A does not change
significantly
during
the time,
At, and that
DA/~ (A.),
~ is negligible.
From
the relation
A
S is
well
known,
the
uncertainty
relations
in
quantum
mechanics can be regarded
in two closely
related ways. First of all, they are a direct mathematical
consequence
of the replacement
of classical numbers
by
operators,
and of adding
the basic principle
that
the
statistical distributions
of the corresponding
observables
can be obtained
by means
of the usual formulas
from
the wave function
and its probability
interpretation. '
Secondly,
however,
it can be shown
by analyses
such
as that of the Heisenberg
microscope
experiment
that
they
are also limitations
on the possible
accuracy
of
measurements. '
These
considerations
apply
to observables
such
as
x, p, and H. With regard to the measurement
of time,
however,
a further
problem
appears,
because
time
.enters into Schrodinger's
equation,
not as an operator
(i.e., and
"observable" ) but
rather,
as a parameter,
which
is a "c"number
that has a well dined
value.
Nevertheless,
the uncertainty
principle,
AEht~&h,
is
generally
accepted
as valid,
even
though
it is not
deduced
directly
from
commutation
relations
in the
way described above.
The
justification
of
the
time-energy
uncertainty
relationship
has been attempted
in several
ways.
(We
shall restrict
ourselves
here entirely
to a discussion
of
the nonrelativistic
case, since the theory
of relativity
has
no
essential
relationship
to
the
measurement
problems
that we are going to treat in this paper. )
First, one can begin with the wave function
aA aH& ~((A,H))..( =h~(A)..(,
AA AH/(A). = 2 f AH ~&Ir.
we obtain
Since II represents
the
Hamiltonian
of the
isolated
system,
AII is also equal
to AE, the uncertainty
in
energy of that system.
It should
be noted
that
the method
proposed
by
Mandelstamm
and Tamm can actually
lead to a deter-
mination
of time,
only
when
the system
is not in a
stationary
state; i.e., only when the wave function takes
the form of a packet, consisting
of a linear superposition
of stationary
states. In other words, the AII appearing
in equation
(2) is determined
by the range of energies

in the wave packet. In this way,
the relation
of the
Mandelstamm
and Tamm treatment
to the Schrodinger
representation
is made clear.
The
above
is
then
a
discussion
of
the
relation
AE ht~&h insofar
as this has been obtained
from the
ma, thematical
formalism
of the quantum
theory
(i.e.,
the
wave
function,
operators,
and
probability
inter-
pretation).
Naturally,
as is necessary
in the case of
observables
such as x and p, this uncerta, inty relation
must also be analyzed
in terms of the interaction
of the
measuring
apparatus
with the observed system. Landau
and
Peierls,"for example,
do this by considering
a
special
example,
in which
the
momentum
of a free
particle is measured
by means of a collision with a heavy
test particle
(also free). To simplify
the problem
they
consider
a case in which
the measuring
particle
is a
perfectly rejecting
mirror,
and discuss only the move-
ment
in one dimension
(perpendicular
to the mirror).
They then apply the laws of conservation
of energy and
momentum,
which are
p'+P'
(p+P) =—0,
(3a)
E'+e'
(E+e)=0, —
(3b)
where
lower case letters refer to the observed
particle,
capitals
to the test particle,
unprimed
quantities
to
values before collision, and primed
quantities
to values
after collision. Because E=P'/2M,
e= p'/2m,
one can
solve for the momentum
of the observed particle before
and
after
collision,
in
terms
of
the
corresponding
momenta
of the test particle.
In order to define the time of measurement,
Landau
and Peierls'
(and also Landau
and Lifshitz)'
consider
the case of a time-dependent
interaction
between
the
particle
and
the mirror,
which
lasts for some known
period
of time,
At. This period
At, which
is the un-
certainty
in the
time
of measurement,
then
implies
(e.g., according to perturbation
theory)
an uncertainty
in the
energy
of the combined
system
consisting
of
observed
particle
and
mirror,
of
magnitude
h/ht,
resulting
from the time-dependent
interaction.
Instead
of Eq. (3b) for the exact conservation
of energy, we must
therefore
write
i e'+E' —(e+E) i & h/Dt.
(3c)
Evidently
the momentum
of the test particle before
and
after
collision
can be measured
with
arbitrary
accuracy,
so that AP=AP'=0. As a result,
we obtain
from Eq. (3a), 6p=hp',
and from (3c), we have
2 (e'—e) &~h/At
Since e= p'/2m,
we can also write the above result as
("—v)ap& h/at.
(Note that although
Ap itself may be very small, there

is still a minimum
uncertainty
in energy
transfer,
be-
cause
the
change
of velocity
will
then
become
very
large, if At is finite. )
Landau and Peierls therefore conclude that there is an
uncertainty
relation
between
the energy
transferred
to
the
system
and
the
time
at
which
the
energy
is
measured.
This means that the energy
of the observed
system
cannot
be measured
in a short
time,
without
changing it in an unpredictable
and uncontrollable
way.
In other words,
energy meuslremeets
curried out in short
periods of time are not reproducible.
Fock and Krylov' criticize the derivation
of the above
results, but come to essentially
the same conclusion. In
effect, they do not accept the definition
of the time of
measurement
by means
of a time-dependent
potential
of interaction
between the two particles. This is because
in a real
collision,
there
is no
such
time-dependent
potential.
Rather, the time of collision is determined
by
the movement
of the particles themselves,
in such a way
that one of them serves as a clock. Let us suppose that
it is the test particle
which
fulfills
this function.
This
particle
defines the time, t, as that at which it passes a
definite
point,
X,
by
the
equation,
t= X/V.
The
time,
as
defined
in
this
way,
has
an
uncertainty
LU= d,X/V (provided,
as will actually
be the case in our
example,
that AV/V((l).
In order to define the time of collision,
we must have
some information
about the initial location
of the ob-
served particle, as well as that of the test particle. For
simplicity,
let us suppose that the initial velocity of the
test particle is so much higher than that of the observed
particle that the latter can be regarded
as essentially
at
rest until the collision. The mean initial position x of the
observed particle will be taken to be at the origin, while
the uncertainty
in this position
is represented
by Ax.
Evidently
we must choose Ax & Ax, if the location of the
test particle
is to serve as a definition
of the time of
collision. Therefore
d,t= AX/V)~A/(dP)
V=i'i/5E.
(This is just the well-known
uncertainty
relation
be-
tween the energy of the test particle and the time that is
defined by the movement
of its coordinate. )
Fock and Krylov then point out that in this case, the
laws of conservation
of energy and momentum
are both
satisfied
exactly, so that Eqs. (3a) and (3b) can be used
directly,
while the approximate
form (3c) for the con-
servation
of energy
is not to be applied
here
(since
perturbation
theory no longer has any relevance
to the
problem. ) From (3a), we obtain
~(p
p') =~(P P')—
—
If
V
is chosen
large
enough,
we
can
for a given
dd&~h/VDP
make DP and hP' arbitrarily
small,
and,
a,s a result,
we can likewise make h(p —p') as small as

AND

we please. From Eq. (3b), it then follows that
where
we have used the result that A(p' —p) is negli-
gible. TlIe above is exactly
the same Eq. (5) as that
obtained by Landau and Peierls, but the uncertainty
in
energy transfer to the observed
system
is now deduced
on the basis of the fact that the (time-dependent)
posi-
tion of one of the particles
is used to define the time of
collision.
Fock and Krylov then go on to criticize the approach
of Mandelstamm
and Tamm,
suggesting
that it is in-
complete. They assert that by means of the wave func-
tion and the operators
of the observed
system,
one can
discuss
only
the statistical
features
of any
measure-
ment. In order to discuss
an ieCkviduu/
measurement
process, they refer to what they call "Bohr's uncertainty
relation, " A(e' —e)At& h, where
e and
e' are the actual
values
of the energy
of an individual
observed
system
before and after measurement.
To clarify
this
distinction
between
the
statistical
uncertainty
relations
discussed
by Mandelstamm
and
Tamm, and the Bohr relation,
they point out that, for
example,
in observation
of a state with
lifetime r (as
described by its wave function),
one can make measure-
ments
in times
much
shorter
than r. Therefore,
it is
necessary
to distinguish
between
the
time
intervals
defined
by the wave function
of the observed
system,
and the time interval
representing
the actual duration
of an individual
measurement.
The time interval
defined
by the wave function
has in measurements
generally
only a statistical
significance.
Even
if one treated
the
measurement
process
by
means of a many-body
Schrodinger
equation,
including
the apparatus
coordinates,
the same distinction
would
arise. For it would
the necessary
to observe
the com-
bined
system
by means
of additional
apparatus;
and
here too, there
will be a "Bohr uncertainty
principle"
for the
individual
observation
and
a statistical
un-
certainty
principle
following
from
the wave
function,
which
applies
to an ensemble
of cases. To treat
the
apparatus
by quantum
theory is, in effect, to push back
the well known "cut" between
classical and quantum
sides another
stage. While it is always
permissible
and
sometimes
convenient
to do this, it cannot
change the
content of the theory.
Let us now sum up the problem.
Mandelstamm
and
Tamm
propose
a mathematical
operator
uncertainty
relation
between
energy
and
time,
as determined
by
the wave function. Fock and Krylov regard such a treat-
ment as incomplete,
because it applies only statistically
to a large number
of measurements,
and because within
it one cannot even consider the question
of the interval
of time needed to carry out an individual
measurement.
To complete
the treatment,
they call attention
to the
"Bohr uncertainty
relation"
(discussed
also by Landau
and Peierls, ' as well as by Landau
and Lifshitz')
which
applies to individual
measurements,
and which refers to
the relation
between
the error in the measurement
of
energy
and the duration
of the measurement
process.
While criticizing
some of the methods
of Landau
and
Peierls,
they
agree with
the essential
conclusion
that
energy
cannot be measured
in arbitrarily
short periods
of time, without
introducing
uncertainties,
according to
the relation
A(e' —e) ~& h jhow.
2. CRITICISM
OF
COMMONLY
ACCEPTED
INTERPRETATIONS
OF THE TIME-ENERGY
UNCERTAINTY
RELATION
The main conclusion
of Landau
and Peierls, ' Landau
and Lifschitz, ' and Fock and Krylov'
(given in Sec. 1),
viz. , that
energy
cannot
be measured
in a short
time
without
introducing
an
uncertainty
in
its
value,
represents
a very widely accepted interpretation
of the
time-energy
uncertainty
relation. This conclusion
is, as
we shall show, erroneous,
the error being based in part
on an inadequate
formulation
of Bohr's point of view
concerning
measurement,
and in part on the use of an
illustrative
example of a measurement
process, that was
not sufficiently
typical
of the general
case of such a
measurement.
(In fact, in Sec. 4 we shall give a counter-
example, in which the energy of a particle is measured
to
arbitrary
accuracy in as short a time as we please).
With
regard
to Bohr's
point
of view
concerning
measurements,
it is important
to stress here his con-
tinual
insistence
that the minimum
ambiguities
in the
results
of any individual
measurement
process
(in the
sense of what Fock and Krylov
called the "Bohr un-
certainty
relations" ) are always exactly the same as the
minimum
ambiguities
in the possibility
of definition
in
the mathematical
theory
of the observables
that
are
being measured. ' (These latter ambiguities
are, of course,
the "statistical"
uncertainty
relations
referred
to by
Fock and Krylov. )
The ambiguities
in the results of individual
measure-
ments
are regarded
as originating
in the
indivisible
quantum
connections
of the object under investigation
to the apparatus
(and indeed
to the whole
universe),
which give rise to a minimum
ambiguity
in the degree to
which
well-defined
classical
properties
(e.g., position
and
momentum)
can be assigned
to the object as a
result of any such measurement. ' In addition,
however,
the result
of each measurement
defines
a "quantum
state" of the observed
system,
specified
by its wave
function. This wave function
is, of course, not a repre-
sentation
of an individual
system,
but it implies,
in
general,
only a set of statistical
predictions
concerning
the results
of possible
measurements.
Nevertheless,
if
these predictions
were such that
the minimum
ambi-
guity
in the definition
of the results
of an individual
measurement
were
less than
the minimum
statistical

Unwin,

i652
fluctuation
implied
by the mathematical
theory,
then
there would be a contradiction.
Vice versa, if they were
such that the minimum
ambiguity
in the result
of an
individual
measurement
were greater than the minimum
statistical
fluctuation
as described
above,
then
this
would lead to an arbitrary
restriction,
not related in any
general
way to the mathematical
formalism,
a restric-
tion that evidently
has no place in a coherent
over-all
framework
of theory.
Moreover,
one could, in general,
expect that with sufficient effort, it would be possible to
find an example
of an individual
measurement
process
with the same minimum
ambiguity
as that implied
by
the formalism;
and if such a process is found,
then the
supposedly
greater minimum
ambiguity
in the results of
an individual
measurement
will be contradicted.
For
these zeasons, it is necessary
to consider the statistical
and
individual
uncertainty
relations
as two
equally
essential
sides of what is basically
the same limitation
on the
precise
definability
and
measurability
of the
state
of any
system.
In other
words,
as Bohr
has
stressed,
there car be eo Hmitatioe oe individual
measure-
ments
that cannot also be obtained from the mathematical
formalism
and the statistical
interpretation.
There is no question that all the above considerations
apply for common examples of the uncertainty
principle
(e.g., x and p). However,
as we pointed
out in Sec. 1,
time
enters
into
Schrodinger's
equation
only
as
a
parameter,
so that there
is no straightforward
way to
apply
these ideas to the time-energy
uncertainty
rela-
tion. Of course, we can, with Mandelstamm
and Tamm,
obtain an uncertainty
relation
between
the lifetime
of
a state of the observed system and its energy. But let us
recall here that
(as pointed
out by Fock and Krylov),
the operators of the observed system have no connection
whatsoever
with
the
duration
of the
measurement
process
(which
is evidently
determined,
in general,
by
the apparatus).
Keeping
this fact in mind,
let us now
raise the question
of whether
there can be a genuine
un-
certainty relation between the energy transferred
to the
observed
system
and the time at which
the measure-
ment took place (as has been suggested
by I.andau
and
Peierls, Fock and Krylov,
and other authors).
In accordance
with Bohr's point of view on the sub-
ject, as we have described it above, we are led to point
out that one cannot safely regard any given uncertainty
relations
as
representing
a
real
limitation
on
the
accuracy of all possible measurements
of the quantities
under discussion
unless the relationship
has been shown
to follow
from
the mathematical
formalism.
On the
other hand,
all of the authors
referred to above seem to
be satisfied
to establish
the
time-energy
uncertainty
relations
as applying
to individual
measurements
by
what Fock and Krylov
called "illustrative
examples. "
Such a point of view would
imply,
of course, that the
uncertainty
relations
applying
to individual
measure-
ments could in principle,
have a basis that is independ-

ent
of the
statistical
relations
obtainable
from
the
mathematical
formalism.
As we have already
pointed
out, however,
such a procedure
is arbitrary
and there-
fore subject to the continual danger of being contradicted
by the development
of new examples
of measurement
processes,
which
reduce
the
ambiguity
down
to the
minimum
allowed
by the formalism.
(For, as is quite
evident,
there
is no way to be sure that
conclusions
obtained
from an illustrative
example
have
universal
validity).
It follows from the above discussion that to complete
the treatment
of the time-energy
uncertainty
relation, it
is necessary
to develop
a method
of showing
how the
time of measurement
and the energy transferred
in this
measurement
are to be expressed
in terms
of suitable
operators. The method
that we shall use in this paper
starts from our discussion of the example first treated by
Landau
and
Peierls,
and
then by Fock and Krylov;
viz. , the one in which
the energy
of a free particle
is
measured
by collision with another particle. As we saw
in Sec. 1, in such an interaction,
the time of collision is
determined
physically
by
the state
of some
system
which
serves as a clock. In the example
of Fock and
Krylov,
it is determined
by the position
of the test
particle
(which
was taken
to be free). Now,
for any
system,
one can define a Hermitian
operator represent-
ing such a time. In the case of a free particle,
this is
y
p
1
1
t,=—= —',M/
y—+—
y
f,
pw
where y and p„are respectively
position and momentum
of the particle in question. "
The commutation
relations between the above opera-
tor and the Hamiltonian,
H„of the "clock" in question
are
(as can easily
be verified
for the
case of a free
particle, for which H, =p„'( 352),
This
procedure
is evidently
very
similar
to that
of
Mandelstamm
and
Tamm.
However,
they
discussed
only the operators of the observed
system, and obtained
an uncertainty
relation
(2) between
the energy
of this
system
and the "inner" time as defined
by dynamical
variables
in this system
(e.g., the lifetime
of a state).
On the other hand,
we are applying
the relations
(8) to
the energy, E„ofthe "clock" in the apparatus,
and to
the time, t„ofmeasurement
as determined
by this clock.
Since the time of measurement
can be represented
by
an operator, t„belonging
only to the observing
appara-
tus, it follows
that
this
time must
commute
with
every
operator of the observed
systeni and, in particular,
with As
Hamil/oriana.
There is therefore no reason inherent
in the
principles
of the quantum
theory
why the energy
of a
system
cannot
be measured
in as short a time as we

please.
(Recall, however,
that in accordance
with
the
treatment
of Mandelstamm
and
Tamm,
any
such a
measurement
of the energy of the observed system to an
accuracy AE must leave the "inner" time undefined
to
at& A/z E).
In view of the above discussion, it is evident that the
usual treatment
of the energy-time
uncertainty
relation
(e.g., as discussed by Fock and Krylov) must be in some
way erroneous.
Since the particular
illustrative
example
chosen by all the authors
cited here (which
is, in fact,
the one usually
given) has in fact been treated correctly,
it follows that the mistake must be that this example is
not suKciently
typical of the general case. And, indeed,
as we shall see in Sec. 4, one can suggest
more general
methods
of measurement
of energy,
which do not lead
to the above limitation.
In this way,
we confirm
our
conclusion,
based
on general
considerations
regarding
the principles
of the quantum
theory, that it is always
possible to obtain true limitations
on the measurability
of any
observable
from
the mathematical
formalism,
and that any other limitations
that are added to these
are
arbitrary
restrictions,
which
can
eventually
be
contradicted,
if
further
examples
of
measurement
processes are sought. "
Finally, it is instructive
to point out that problems
similar
to those
connected
with
the
time-energy
un-
certainty
relations
arise in the more familiar
example
of the position
momentum
relationship,
hp, Ax~&A. To
bring out the analogy,
we can ask ourselves
whether
the
momentum
of a particle
can be measured
to arbitrary
accuracy by means of an apparatus,
which is localized in
space. (Here, p, takes the place of E, while the region of
space in which the apparatus
is located takes the place
of the duration,
d,t, of the measurement. ) At first sight,
it may seem that if the apparatus
is localized in a very
small
region
of size AX, the momentum
of a particle
cannot
be
measured
to
an
accuracy
greater
than
hp =h/AX.
This,
however,
is not the case, because,
what is defined here is the coordinate, X, of the appara-
tus, and not that of the measured
particle, x. Since p,
commutes
with X, there
is no inherent
limitation
on
how accurately it can be measured,
if X is defined.
To illustrate
such a possibility,
consider the measure-
ment of the momentum
of a photon,
by measuring
its
energy and using the relation p =E/c. (This is analogous
to the measurement
of energy of a particle by measuring
its momentum
and using
the relation E=p'/2M. ) We
can do this by means of an atom which
is very highly
localized,
provided
that
this atom has a sharp
level,
excited above the ground
state by the amount 8=pc.
If the photon
has the appropriate
energy,
it will be
absorbed
and eventually
reemitted
(being delayed
and
perhaps
scattered).
It
is
observable
whether
this
happens
or not. If it does happen,
then this provides a
measurement
of the energy,
and through
this,

momentum.
It is evident
that the uncertainty
in this
momentum
has no essential
relation
to the size of the
atom, but only to the lifetime of the excited state. The
momentum
has therefore been measured
by an appara-
tus, which
is as localized
in space as we please.
(Of
course,
the position
of the photon
after the measure-
ment
is over
is indeterminate,
just as happens
with
"inner" time variables
in the analogous
case of time
measurement.
)
3. TREATMENT
OF TIME
OF
MEASUREMENT
IN
TERMS OF THE MATHEMATICAL
FORMALISM
OF THE QUANTUM
THEORY
We saw in Sec. 1 that
(as pointed
out by Fock and
Krylov')
there
is a need to make a careful distinction
between
the time at which a measurement
takes place
and
the
time
as defined
by the
wave
function
and
operators
of the observed system (e.g., the lifetime of an
excited state). In Sec. 2, we showed
how
such a dis-
tinction
can be represented
within
the mathematical
formalism
of the
quantum
theory
by considering
as
operators
certain
variables
that have hitherto
usually
been
associated
with
the
observing
apparatus;
viz. ,
those variables
determining
the time at which
inter-
action between
the apparatus
and the observed
system
takes place. This implies, of course, that the wave func-
tion must
now be extended,
so as to depend
on these
latter
variables, It is equivalent
to placing
the "cut"
between
observing
apparatus
and observed
system at
a di6erent point.
It is well known that while there is a certain kind of
arbitrariness
in the location of this cut, it is not com-
pletely arbitrary.
For example,
in the treatment
of the
energy levels of a hydrogen
atom, one can, in a certain
approximation,
regard the nucleus as a classical particle
in a well-defined
position.
If, however,
the treatment
aims at being accurate enough to take the reduced mass
into account, both electron and nucleus must be treated
quantum-mechanically,
and
the
cut
is
introduced
instead between the atom as a whole and its environment.
The place of the cut therefore
depends,
in general,
on
how accurate a treatment
is required
for the problem
under discussion.
Of course, it follows that once a given
place of the cut is justified, then it can always be moved
further
toward
the classical side without
changing
the
results
significantly.
If we are interested
only in discussing
what Fock and
Krylov called the "Bohr uncertainty
relation"
(the one
referring
to an Asdieidla/
measurement
of energy
and
time),
then
we are justified
in placing
the
physical
variables
that determine
the time of the measurement
on the classical side of the cut. For, as is quite evident,
in this aspect of the uncertainty
relations,
these varia-
bles are by de6nition
regarded
as classical, in the sense
that
their
uncertainty
represents
only
an
inherent
ambiguity
in the possibility
of defining
the state of an
iedkidmul
system. We have seen in Sec. 2, however, that
according to the Bohr point of view, every uncertainty

relation
that appears
in this way must also be able to
appear
as a statistical
fiuctuation
in a corresponding
operator,
which must, of course, be calculated
from an
appropriate
wave function. To discuss
this side of the
uncertainty
relations,
it is clear that
we must
change
the
position
of the
cut,
so that
the
corresponding
variables
now fall on the quantum-mechanical
side.
In the subsequent
discussion
of how the uncertainty
relations appear in the mathematical
formalism,
we shall
begin
with
the
case in which
the
time
determining
variables
are placed on the classical side of the cut. In
this
case, the time
variables
can be rejected
in the
Schrodinger
equation
only in the time parameter
3 which
can, of course, have an arbitrarily
well-defined
value.
This
time
parameter
is related
to measurement
in
several ways.
First of all such a relation comes about in the prepara-
tion of a system
in a definite
quantum
state, and in
observations
carried out later on that system. Consider,
for example, a quantum
state prepared at a time deter-
mined by means of a shutter
(which
we are, of course,
now regarding
as being on the classical side of the cut).
There must be some relationship
between
the time, t„
at which the shutter
functions
and the time parameter,
t appearing
the Schrodinger's
equation.
Indeed,
if the
Hamiltonian
of the observed system does not depend on
time, then it is easily seen that the wave function takes
the form
P=P(x, t—t,),
where
1b is a solution
of Schrodinger's
equation
for the
system
in question.
The form
of f is determined
by
choosing that solution
which at f=t, becomes equal to
the function,
Po(x), representing
the quantum
state in
which the "preparing"
measurement
leaves the system.
Then, when an observation
is made, the time t, of the
measurement
is likewise
determined
by suitable
varia-
bles on the classical side of the cut. The probability
of
any
given
result
is, of course,
computed
in the well-
known
way from the wave function, P=P(x, t —t,).
It is clear that as far as this one-body
treatment
is
concerned,
there is certainly
nothing
in the formalism
which would prevent
the system under
discussion
from
being either prepared
or observed
in a state of definite
energy,
when
f
and 3, are as well defined as we please.
Thus, if the system
is in a state of definite
energy, E
(so that the uncertainty,
hE, in its energy is zero, while
the lifetime r) A/AE of the state is infinite),
its wave
function,
/=pe(x)e 'e"" )where
p~(x)
is the
eigen-
function
of the Hamiltonian
operator
belonging
to the
eigenvalue,
Eg is evidently
able to represent
such a
state, no matter what value is given to t. A wave func-
tion of this kind is therefore
evidently
compatible
with
the statement
that at some time, t=t„ the system
was
prepared
in the eigenstate
of the energy represented
by
fe(x). Thus, in the one body treatmen-t
alone, no reason
for an uncertainty
relation
between
the energy
of the
system and the time of measurement
can be found. And
this is indeed basically the reason why Fock and Krylov
were
led
to postulate
such
an
uncertainty
relation
independently,
and to try to justify this relationship
by
means of illustrative
examples of measurement
processes
(see Sec. 1).
Let us now go on to consider
the time-energy
un-
certainty
relation
from the other aspect,
in which
the
variables
determining
the
time
of measurement
are
placed on the quantum-mechanical
side of the cut. In
this case, we must
introduce
these variables
into the
wave function,
so that we are in this way led to a many-
body Schrodinger
equation. Let us recall, however,
that
the "cut" has not been abolished,
but merely
pushed
back another
stage. Thus,
as was pointed
out in the
discussion
of the treatment
of Fock and Krylov given
in Sec. 1, there
is implied
an
additional
observing
apparatus
on the classical side of the cut, with the aid
of which
the many-body
system
under
discussion
can
be observed.
The probabilities
for the results
of such
observations
are determined
by the
wave
functions,
which take the form
%=%(x,y,,t),
where
y;, represents
the
apparatus
variables
on the
quantum-mechanical
side
of the
cut
(which
include
those
that
describe
the
time
of measurement).
The
time parameter
t here plays a role similar to that which
it had in the one-body problem; viz. , through it the time
frame
on the
large-scale
classical
side
of the cut is
brought into relationship
with the quantum-mechanical
formalism
by means of suitable
observations.
We shall now consider as an example of the approach
described
above, the measurement
of energy
and time
by means
of a collision of two particles,
as treated
in
Sec. 1. The
initial
wave
function
of the
combined
system
is, for this case, a product
of two packet func-
tions, one representing
the test particle
coming in with
a very high velocity,
U, and the other representing
the
observed
particle,
essentially
at rest
(with a velocity
that
is negligible
in comparison
to V) and
with
its
center
at
the
origin.
After
the
collision,
it
is
well
known""
that
the wave function
becomes a sum
of
products
of such packets, correlated
in such a way that
an observation
of the properties
of the test particle can
yield information
about the particle under discussion.
As far as this particular
example is concerned, it will
not be relevant here to go into a more detailed discussion
of the problem
of solving
Schrodinger's
equation.
All
that is important
here is that as we saw in Sec. 2, the
time of collision is given essentially
by the operator,

QUANTUM
THEORY
FOR TIME
AND
ENERGY
V= V(x,y,s),
(12)
where
s is the variable
that
determines
the time
of
interaction.
If the particles
determining
the time of interaction
are heavy enough,
then they will move in an essentially
classical
way,
very
nearly
following
a definite
orbit,
the test particle, respectively),
so that the operator, t„
commutes
with
the Hamiltonian,
H„of the observed
system. As a result, there is, as we have already
stated
in Sec. 2, no uncertainty
relation
between
the time of
measurement
and the energy
of the observed
system.
But in the treatment
that
we are now using,
we have
obtained
this result
by allowing
the variables
deter-
mining the time of measurement
to fall on the quantum-
mechanical
side of the cut. (As was to be expected,
of
course, the actual physical
consequences
of the theory
do not depend
on which
side of the cut these variables
are placed. )
In the example
given above, the same apparatus
was
used to determine
both the time of measurement
and
the momentum
of the particle. However,
it is possible,
and in fact frequently
advantageous,
to consider a more
general
situation,
in
which
the
time
determining
variables
are separated
from those which
are used to
measure
other quantities
(such as momentum).
This, in
fact, would be the correct way of completing
the treat-
ment of the example given by Landau and Peierls" (see
Sec. 1), in which
the time of measurement
was deter-
mined by an interaction
between
the test particle
and
the observed
particle
which
was assumed
to last for
some interval
At.
If there
is a
time-dependent
interaction
between
apparatus
and
observed
system
which
lasts
for an
interval
At, then the Schrodinger
equation
will have to
have a corresponding
potential,
which
represents
this
interaction.
The form of this potential
will depend
on
where we place the cut.
If the apparatus
determining
the time of interaction
is taken to be on the classical side, then the potential
will be a certain well defined function
of time, which is
nonzero
only in the specified interval
of length
At. We
may write this potential
as
V= V(x,y,t),
where
x represents
the
coordinate
of the
observed
particle,
and y that of the test particle. This is indeed.
the usual way by which measurements
are represented
in the mathematical
formalism ""
In the next section
we shall
apply
this method
in
order to treat a specihc
example,
in which it will be
shown
in detail
that
the energy
of a system
can be
measured
in an arbitrarily
short time.
If, on the other hand,
the variables
determining
the
time of interaction
are placed on the quantum
mechani-
cal side of the cut, then we cannot regard the potential
as a well-defined
function
of time. Instead,
we must
write
i A
(x,y,s,t)= PI„+H„+H,+V(x,y,s)]%'(x,y,s,t), (14)
8t
where JI„represents
the Hamiltonian
of the observed
particle, H„ that of the apparatus,
H, that of the time-
determining
variable, s. We must then show the equiva-
lence of this treatment
with that obtained
by placing
the time-determining
variable on the classical side of the
cut. To do this, it is sufficient to demonstrate
that in a
suitable approximation,
equation
(14) leads to the time-
dependent
Schrodinger
equation

the
x

y
variables

by letting

by a heavy

we have H, =p,'/2M. We
suppose
that
the initial
state of the time-determining
variable

by a wave packet narrow

small as is necessary. This packet is

C (s—s,t) is

is, in
general, a fairly regular
function
which varies slowly in
comparison
with the wavelength,

a solution
for the whole problem

we obtain, as
a good approximation,
V(x,y,s)= V(x,y,s(t))
To treat this problem
mathematically,
we begin with
the Schrodinger
equation
for the whole system.

where
the sum is taken over the respective

a sum is necessary,
there
will be correlations
between
the time-determining
variable
and the other variables,
with the result that there will be no valid approximation
in which an equation such as (15)involving
only x and y
canbe separated
out. However,
if the mass, M, of the
time
determining
particle
is great enough,
so that the
potential
V(x,y,z) does not vary significantly
in a, wave-
length, X=h/p„ then,
as is well known,
the adiabatic
approximation
will apply. In this case, one can obtain
a simple
solution,
consisting
of a single product,
even
when interaction
is taken into account. To show in more
detail how this comes about, we first write the solution
in the form
4=I o(z,t)I//(x, y,z,t).

4. EXAMPLE OF A REPRODUCIBLE
MEASUREMENT
OF ENERGY IN A WELL-DEFINED TIME
We saw in Secs. 2 and 3 that
there
is no reason
inherent
in the principles
of the quantum
theory why a
reproducible
and exact measurement
of energy
cannot
be made in an arbitrarily
short period
of time. Since
Landau
and
Peierls, ' Pock and
Krylov, ' and
many
others have considered
examples
leading
to a contrary
conclusion, it is necessary to complete the discussion by
giving
a specific
example
of a method
of measuring
energy precisely in as short a time as we please. This we
shall do in the present
section. Following
the develop-
ment
of our
example,
it will
become
clear
in what
way
the
previous
treatments
of this
problem
were
inadequate.
As a preliminary
step, we discuss the treatment
of the
measurement
of energy
by means
of the Schrodinger
equation
for the apparatus
and
the observed
system
together. The Hamiltonian
of the combined
system is
H= Hp(p, x)+Hp'(p, y)+Hr(p*, x; p„,y,t),
(23)
where
Hp(p„x)
is the
Hamiltonian
of the
observed
system, Hp'(p„, y), that of the apparatus,
and H&(p„x;
p„,y,t) is the interaction,
which is zero except during
a
certain interval
of time between
tp and tp+At. (Here we
are adopting
the point of view described
in Sec. 3, in
which
we
regard
the
time
determining
variables
as
being on the classical side of the cut, so that they do not
appear
explicitly
in Schrodinger's
equation. ) It will be
adequate
for our
purposes
to assume
that
both
the
observed
system
and the apparatus
are free particles,
with respective
Hamiltonians
We then make the substitution,
s—v,t=N, and
ip'(x, y,u, t) =ip(x,y, z,t) =tp(x, y,u+z, t,t).
With the relation
BP'/Bt= (rtiiP/Bt)+ (n,8$/rlz),
we have
t',ABQ'/Bt= tH„+H„+V (x,y,u+ti, t)]P'(x,y,u,t).

Note that this equation
does not contain derivatives
of
I, so that I can be given a definite value in it.
The complete
wave function
is, of course, obtained
by multiplying
iP'(x,y,u,t) by 4p(z —z,t) =Cp(u). Now,
this was assumed
to be a narrow
packet
centering
at
+=0, such that the spread of I can be neglected.
As a
result,
we can write m=0 in the above equation.
The
To simplify
the problem,
we consider the ideal case of
a measurement
of p, which
does not change p,. This
will happen if Hr is not a function of x. (The satisfaction
of this condition
will evidently
guarantee
that repro-
ducible measurements
of p„and therefore H p= p,'/2M
will be possible). The Hamiltonian
of the whole system
will then be taken as
's If V(s,y,s) varies too rapidly,
then (As/2N)8 P/ass will not be'
negligible,
even when
Jtt/I is large.

where
g(t) is everywhere
zero, except between
to and
to+At,
where
it is constant.
(The interaction
Hamil-
tonian is similar to a vector potential
in its effects).
With the Hamiltonian
(25), p, is, of course, a constant
of the motion. The equations
of motion for the remain-
ing variables
are then
On solving for p„, we obtain
(using p, =constant)
(2&)
This
equation
implies
a correlation
between p„—P„'
and p„such
that
if p„—p„' is
observed,
we
can
calculate p,.
It is important
also to consider
the behavior
of i.
Although p, is constant, i shifts suddenly
at t= to from
p /rN to P,/rN+g(t)y,
and remains
at this value
until
t=t;, after which it returns
to its initial
value.
(In a
similar
way, the velocity and rnornentum
differ in the
case of a vector potential. )
The above behavior
of the velocity
is, as a simple
calculation
shows, just what
is needed
to produce
the
uncertainty
in position,
which
is required
by the im-
proved
definition
of the momentum
resulting
from the
measurement.
It is easily seen that if g(t) is large enough,
the meas-
urement
described above can be carried out in as short a
time as we please. In order that a given accuracy, Ap„
be possible,
the change
of deflection
of the apparatus,
A(p„—p„') due to the shift AP„must be greater
than
the
uncertainty,
h(p„)
in
the
initial
state
of the
apparatus.
This means that we must have
DP g(t)ht=hP„',
and if g(t) is large enough, both At and Ap, can be made
arbitrarily
small for a given hp„'.
This hypothetical
example
confirms
our conclusion
once again that accurate
energy
measurements
can be
reproduced
in an arbitrarily
short time. We shall now
show how to carry out such a measurement
by means of
a concrete experiment.
To guide us in the choice of this
experiment,
we note that
the essential
feature
of the
interaction
described
in Eq. (25) is that it implies
a
force that
is independent
of the x coordinate
of the
partide,
and
which
alters
the
velocity
suddenly
at
t= tp to bring it back to its original value at t= ti."This
force is therefore
equivalent
in its effect to a pair of
equal and opposite pulses in a uniform
electric 6eld, the
first at tp and the second at ti. In order to approximate
such pulses, we shall consider two condensers,
the fields
of which cross the observed particle at the times
tp and
t~. The condensers are assumed to have a length,
/, in the
"In the hypothetical
example
of Eq. (25), this force resulted
from the time-dependent
interaction,
which
was equivalent
to a
corresponding
vector
potential,
which
would
produce
a field,

only when A(t) changes; i.e., at
the beginning
and the end of the interval.

is much greater than their thickness,
d, in the X direction.
Therefore,
they
will produce
a

electric Geld in the X direction, except for edge
effects which
can be neglected
when /))d. Each con-
denser
will go by the particle at a velocity, V„ in the Y
direction,
which
is assumed
to be so great
that
the
electric field acts for a very short time, t/U„, with the
result that the field approximates
the one cited in our
mathematical
example,
where the period of action was
infinitesimal.
If the two condensers
follow each other,
one at t=tp, the other at t= t~, then we shall approach
the case treated in Eq. (25).
As in the case of the collision treated in Secs. 1 and 3,
the time of measurement
is defined as the time at which
the condenser
passes the observed particle. (This means
that we are now shifting
to the point of view in which
the
time-determining
variables
are on the quantum-
mechanical
side of the cut, but as we saw in Sec. 3, both
both
points
of view
are equivalent
and can be used
interchangeably).
As in the case of collision,
the un-
certainty
Dt in this time will be given by Dy/V„, pro-
vided that the observed
particle is initially
localized
in
the Y direction,
with a velocity v„much
smaller
than
V~. This will imply an uncertainty
in the energy of the
condenser, hF, = V„AP» A/At.
In the interaction
between particle and condenser,
the
transfer
ofI component
of the momentum
(neglecting
edge effects) is
Ap =p O=Fr=eSr=ehl/Uy,
(28)
where
7 is the time taken by the condenser
to pass the
particle.
(Note that r and
At are different
quantities).
This transfer
is independent
of initial conditions,
and is
calculable to arbitrary
accuracy. (Since V„ is as large as
you please, the Y component
of the velocity of the par-
ticle can be neglected
in the above
calculation. ) The
above
transfer
of momentum
implies
a transfer
of
energy to the particle,
(29)
By conservation,
this
transfer
must
be equal
to the
energy
loss Ep—E& of the condenser.
Since the initial
momentum
I', of the condenser
in the X direction
is
zero, and since the mass M of the condenser
is large, the
term
(Ap,)'/2M
which
represents
the
energy
of the
condenser due to momentum
transfer in the X direction,
will be negligible.
The energy change must therefore be
the
result
of alteration
in the
Y component
of the
condenser
momentum,
so that
it
will
be
equal
to
Ep—Eg—
Vyd I'y.
Equation
(29) can now be used to permit p,' to be
measured
if Ep—E=6—
6p is known. For since
~—
6p de-
pends
on P,' and
since
AP, can
be obtained
from
Eq. (28), p,' can be calculated
in terms of Eo
I:'i.
There
is, however,
a limitation
on how accurately
Ep—E& can be measured
because
we require
that the

AN D D. BOH M
V coordinate
of the condenser
shall serve as a clock to
an accuracy,
bt, with
the result
that
the uncertainty
relation,
8E&A/8 will hold for the energy
of the con-
denser. By conservation,
the same uncertainty
relation
must hold for the energy c—
eo transferred
to the particle.
By evaluating
8(e—eo) from Eq. (29), we obtain
Ap,
8(eo
e)—
bt=8p,'
Q=bp, 'An, Q=bp.'(n, '—n,)Q)~h.
This is exactly the same relation
as was obtained
in
the collision
example
given
in Sec. 1. In other
words,
the measurement
on the first
condenser
alone,
must
satisfy
the condition
that if it is carried out in a time
defined as 0t, there will be an uncertain
energy transfer,
hE) h/Q. It is at this point, however,
that the second
condenser
plays
an
essential
role.
For
immediately
after the interaction
with the first condenser
is over, it
will
bring
about
a transfer
of X component
of the
momentum,
which is equal and opposite to that trans-
ferred to the first condenser.
As a result, the velocity of
the observed particle
will return to its initial value, just
as happened
in the mathematical
example
discussed
in
the beginning
of this section. Thus, the momentum
and
the
energy
have
been
measured
without
their
being
changed.
There
is,
therefore,
no
limitation
on
the
accuracy
with
which
the energy
of the particle
can be
measured,
regardless
of the value
of 6t, which
can be
made as small as we please by making
V„very large.
A similar
two-stage
interaction
can be carried out in
the collision example described
in Sec. 1. To do this, we
recall that the uncertainty
in energy
transfer,
8(e'—e)
= (n—n'~8p is large because
(n
n') is large. Nev—
erthe-
less
v—v' can be determined
with
arbitrary
accuracy
from the results of the measurement.
After this is done,
one can then send in a second test particle,
with initial
momentum
calculated
to be such as to change
v' back
to n. After the two collisions,
there
will be, as in the
case of the condensers,
no uncertainty
in energy of the
observed
particle.
In
the
collision
experiment,
the
change of velocity depends
on the value of the momen-
tum of the observed
particle,
so that the initial condi-
tions
in
the
second
collision
must
be
arranged,
in
accordance
with
this value,
which
is learned
from the
first
collision.
On
the
other
hand,
in the
condenser
experiment,
e, —v, is independent
of initial
conditions
so that
the second
condenser
can be prearranged
to
cancel out this shift of velocity without any information
from the results of the first interaction.
At first
sight,
one might
raise
the
question
as to
whether
our conclusions
could be invalidated
by eGects
of radiation,
or by currents
which might be induced
in
the condenser.
Since we are discussing
only the problem
of nonrelativistic
quantum
mechanics,
we can assume
that the velocity of light is infinite. In this case, radia-
tion and relativistic
effects,
in general,
can be made
negligible,
no matter
how sudden
the shift of potential
is. As for currents
induced
in the condenser,
these can
be avoided by charging
an insulator
instead of a metal
plate. The field will still be uniform, but the charges will
not be mobile, so that no currents
will be induced in the
condenser.
The error in the treatments
of Landau
and Peierls,
Fock, and Krylov, and others, as discussed in Sec. 1, is
now evident. For in all of these treatments,
the example
used was that of a single collision of a pair of particles.
For this case, our own treatment
also gave the result
that energy transfer
in a short time must be uncertain.
But as shown in our general canonical treatment
of the
problem [see Eqs. (25)—(28)7, it is clear that this is not
the correct
way
to measure
momentum
and
energy
without
changing
them. To accomplish
this purpose
we
need an interaction
of the kind described
in the above
equations,
which
changes
the
velocity
only
while
interaction
is taking place, but which brings it back to
the initial
value
after interaction
is over. And, as we
have seen, it is possible to realize such a measurement
in a concrete example.
S. SUMMARY
AND
CONCLUSIONS
There
has been an erroneous
interpretation
of un-
certainty
relations
of energy and time. It is commonly
realized,
of
course,
that
the
"inner"
times
of the
observed
system
(defined
as, for example,
by Mandel-
stamm
and Tamm')
do obey an uncertainty
relation
AEht&~ h, where AE is the uncertainty
of the energy of
the system, and At is, in effect, a lifetime of states in that
system. It goes without
saying that whenever
the energy
of any system
is measured,
these "inner" times must
become uncertain
in accordance with the above relation,
and that this uncertainty
will follow in any treatment
of
the measurement
process. In addition,
however,
there
has been a widespread
impression
that there is a further
uncertainty
relation
between
the dlratioe
of measure-
ment
and
the energy
transfer
to the observed
system.
Since this cannot be deduced directly from the operators
of the observed
system and their statistical
fluctuation,
it was regarded
as an additional
principle
that had to
be postulated
independently
and justified
by suitable
illustrative
examples.
As was
shown
by us, however,
this
procedure
is
not
consistent
with
the
general
principles
of the quantum
theory,
and its justification
was based on examples that are not general
enough.
Our conclusion
is then that there are no limitations
on measurability
which
are not obtainable
from
the
mathematical
formalism
by considering
the appropriate
operators
and
their
statistical
Quctuation;
and
as a
special
case
we
see that
energy
can
be
measured
reproducibly
in an arbitrarily
short time.
