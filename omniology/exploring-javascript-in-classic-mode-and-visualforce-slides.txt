Exploring JavaScript in Classic Mode 
and Visualforce

Why Learn Classic Mode?

You can learn “pure” 
JavaScript – no frameworks 
required
Visualforce pages can be 
hosted in Lightning!
Why Learn Classic Mode?

If you have no need for 
classic mode or Visualforce, 
you can skip this module!

Requirement:
Apply for financial 
aid by calling Apex 
from a button and 
from Visualforce

JavaScript Buttons

Do not use JavaScript 
buttons in new 
development!



Wait – nobody uses 
SOAP anymore!
What about REST?
True – but the AJAX 
toolkit dates back 
from before 
Salesforce use REST

The button text is processed 
by the server before being 
sent to the browser

Anything inside the {!  } tag is evaluated on 
the server – the results are sent to the 
client
{! …… }

Visualforce, JavaScript and Remote Actions

The ActionFunction Tag
Supports re-rendering of page elements
Minimal JavaScript code
Doesn’t count against API limits
Remote Actions
Supports function parameters
Requires additional JavaScript code
Doesn’t count against API limits
Invoking Controller Methods from JavaScript


Strict Mode

Visualforce Only Does Template Substitution
ES7
ES6
ES5.1
Template 
substitution 
only
Inline
JavaScript

Add ‘use strict’ to the start of a file or 
function
- Lightning components and ES6 classes 
use strict mode automatically
Many silent failures throw exceptions
Reduces the chances of accidentally 
adding properties to the global object
