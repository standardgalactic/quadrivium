Preface
In the present monograph, we consider the extremal length method in its form
of the method of moduli of families of curves in applications to the problems
of conformal, quasiconformal mapping, and Teichm¨uller spaces. This method
going back to H. Gr¨otzsch, A. Beurling, L. V. Ahlfors, J. Jenkins is now
one of the basic methods in various parts of Analysis. Several surveys and
monographs, e.g., [30], [64], [78], [107], [139] are devoted to the development
of this method and applications. However, we want to give here a useful guide:
how one can start to solve extremal problems of conformal mapping beginning
with simple but famous classical theorems and ending at diﬃcult new results.
Some more non-traditional applications we consider in the quasiconformal
case. The modulus method permits us to consider the problems in question
from a single point of view.
At the mid-century it was established that the classical methods of the
geometric function theory could be extended to complex hyperbolic mani-
folds. The Teichm¨uller spaces turned out to be the most important of them.
Recently, it has become clear that some forms of the extremal length method
could be applied to examine diﬀerent properties of Teichm¨uller spaces (see
e.g. [43], [44]).
Thus, we are concerned with the modulus method and its applications to
extremal problems for conformal, quasiconformal mappings, the extension of
moduli onto Teichm¨uller spaces. The book is intended for diﬀerent groups of
readers:
(1) Non-experts who want to know about how one can use the modulus
technique to solve extremal problems of Complex Analysis. One can ﬁnd
proofs of classical theorems of conformal and quasiconformal mapping by
means of the modulus method as well as many examples of symmetrization
and polarization. Graduate students will ﬁnd here some useful exercises to
check their understanding.
(2) Experts who will ﬁnd new results about solution of diﬃcult extremal prob-
lems for conformal and quasiconformal mappings and about the extension of
the modulus onto Teichm¨uller spaces.

PREFACE
For the most part of this book we assume the background provided by
the usual graduate courses in complex analysis, in particular, the theory of
conformal mappings.
This book is not an exhaustive survey of quasiconformal or conformal
mapping. Here we mostly consider applications of the modulus method to
extremal problems and to the Teichm¨uller theory. Some of results are known
but we present them from the modern point of view and some of them ap-
pear here for the ﬁrst time. One can ﬁnd either the results in the proper
development of the modulus method or its applications.
We omit some diﬃcult proofs of theorems which one can ﬁnd in already
existing monographs, however, we prove various introductory theorems in
Chapter 2 to give the reader the ﬂavour of the modulus method. To facilitate
matters along this line, we present some exercises (marked by ⋆) which are
either simple examples or else theorems that we suggest to prove indepen-
dently.
First of all, this book reﬂects the scientiﬁc interests and results of the
author and does not pretend to be an exhaustive treatment of the ﬁeld. In
particular, we have deliberately omitted a number of results by R. K¨uhnau
and his alumni. Most of them are covered in depth in [75]. We only men-
tion here the work by F. Gardiner and H. Masur [44] on the relationship
between a special embedding of a Teichm¨uller space by extremal lengths
and the Thurston embedding that turns out to be the starting point of a
new interesting direction. A thorough treatment of the proper development
of the modulus method in connection with the extremal partitions one can
ﬁnd in the already mentioned books by G. Kuz’mina [78], M. Ohtsuka [107],
K. Strebel [141], and of symmetrization and polarization in a series of arti-
cles by A. Solynin [133]–[136] and V. Dubinin [30]. So this work is neither a
complete exposition of the classical theory nor a complete survey of the latest
results. But we hope one can ﬁnd here a step to new ways of investigation to
make progress in modern and classical problems.

1. Introduction
An important part of complex analysis is extremal problems, ﬁrst of all,
estimation of functionals and description of the ranges of system of function-
als in various compact classes of conformal or quasiconformal maps. Many
powerful methods have been developed to solve the problems for conformal
maps. We mention here the area principle [48], [88], the variational method
of Goluzin–Schiﬀer [48], [118], [120], the L¨owner–Kufarev parametric method
[4], [56], [94], [112]. The latter has allowed, ﬁnally, to solve the Bieberbach
Conjecture (see the history, e.g., in [21], [111]). One of the crucial problems is
the uniqueness of the extremal functions for a given functional. The complete
solution of such a problem is given by the modulus method that uses either
variational principles or topological-geometric ones.
The method of extremal metrics (extremal length method) goes back to
the strip method by H. Gr¨otzsch [53], [54]. ”H. Gr¨otzsch ﬁrst used it as
a method in the theory of univalent functions. He states that its use was
suggested to him by the work of Faber” (see [64], page 7). Later, L. V. Ahlfors
and A. Beurling [9], [12] introduced the notion of the extremal length (the
reciprocal of the modulus) that gave rise to the active development of the
method. The great contribution to the subject has been made by J. Jenkins
[63], [64] and K. Strebel [141] who connected the modulus problem with
the problem of the extremal partitioning of a Riemann surface and proved
the existence of the extremal metric by Schiﬀer’s variations [119]. Further
development and generalization of the modulus were made by G. V. Kuz’mina
[78]. Now on, the modulus method (the extremal length method in Ahlfors’
terminology) is a powerful tool for the solution of problems of various types.
It turns out to be rather universal and provides easily and naturally the
uniqueness of solution in many extremal problems of conformal mapping what
is complicate on applying other methods. It is important, that the modulus
became a source of the deﬁnition of quasiconformal maps.
The theory of quasiconformal mapping emerged at the beginning of the
twentieth century. At that time, these maps arose by geometric reasons
based on the works of H. Gr¨otzsch [53], [54] (who introduced so-called reg-
ular quasiconformal maps) and the notion of the extremal length suggested
by L. V. Ahlfors and A. Beurling and, on the other hand, as solutions of
a special type of elliptic systems of diﬀerential equations in the works by

1. INTRODUCTION
M. A. Lavrentiev (see e.g. [86]). Important applications to various ﬁelds of
mathematics such as the discrete group theory, mathematical physics, com-
plex diﬀerential geometry, have caused a great development of the theory of
quasiconformal mappings that, nowadays, is an important branch of Complex
Analysis. A great contribution to this theory has been made by M. Lavren-
tiev, H. Gr¨otzsch, L. Ahlfors (who became one of the ﬁrst Fields laureates
(1936)), L. Bers, O. Teichm¨uller, P. Belinski˘ı, and L. Volkovyski˘ı in the past,
and C. Earle, I. Kra, M. Ohtsuka, V. Zorich, S. Krushkal, Yu. Reshetnyak,
A. Sych¨ev, F. Gehring, O. Lehto, J. V¨ais¨al¨a, C. Andreian Cazacu, R. K¨uhnau,
V. Aseev, V. Gutlyanski˘ı, V. Sheretov, etc., recently.
Various methods such as the area method, the variational method, the
method of parametric representations, the length-area principle, the extremal
length method were developed for solution of the problems for quasiconformal
maps. Many of them became more or less transformations of the ideas from
classical methods of conformal analysis. However, not all of them provide
similar eﬀect solving concrete problems. So, one can compare the L¨owner-
Kufarev method [4], [94], [112] for univalent functions in the conformal case
and the parametric method by Shah Dao-Shing [126] and Gehring-Reich [46]
(see also [87]) in the quasiconformal case. Only few problems have been solved
by the latter but the main extremal problems like the Bieberbach Conjecture
in the conformal case have used the L¨owner method. Thus, the problems in
the quasiconformal case are, generally, much more diﬃcult.
At the mid-century it was established that the classical methods of the
geometric function theory could be extended to complex hyperbolic mani-
folds. The Teichm¨uller spaces became the most important of them. In 1939
O. Teichm¨uller [150] proposed and partially realized an adventurous program
of investigation in the moduli problem for Riemann surfaces. In the present
work we often use the term ”modulus” with a diﬀerent meaning. So, we
should clarify that the classical modulus problem starts with the work by
B. Riemann [115]. It is based on the fact that the conformal structure of a
compact Riemann surface of genus g > 1 depends on 3g −3 complex pa-
rameters (moduli). The problem proceeds with a study of the nature of these
parameters for general Riemann surfaces and with the induction of a real or a
complex structure into the corresponding space of Riemann surfaces. O. Te-
ichm¨uller has brought together the moduli problem, extremal quasiconformal
maps, and relevant quadratic diﬀerentials on a Riemann surface. This led him
to the well known theory of the Teichm¨uller spaces. Later on, Teichm¨uller’s
ideas were thoroughly substantiated by L. Ahlfors, L. Bers [11] and other
specialists. Investigations in Teichm¨uller spaces were carried out in various
directions: the topological one which is connected with homotopy classes of
diﬀeomorphisms of surfaces of ﬁnite conformal type (W. Abikoﬀ, R. Fricke,
J. Nielsen, W. Thurston), mathematical physics which is connected with ap-
plications to the conformal-gauge string theory (L. Takhtadzhyan, P. Zo-
graf), the theory of discontinuous groups (B. Maskit, H. Zieschang, E. Fogt,

H.-D. Coldewey, I. Kra, S. Krushkal, B. Apanasov, N. Gusevski˘ı), the the-
ory of dynamical systems (R. Devaney, A. Douady, J. Hubbard, L. Keen,
D. Sullivan, C. McMullen, A. Eremenko, M. Lyubich), complex analysis and
metric theory (C. Earle, I. Kra, S. Nag, H. Royden, F. Gardiner, S. Krushkal,
V. Sheretov), etc.
However, returning to the appearance of quasiconformal maps one can
consider the notion of the modulus of families of curves as the basis of the no-
tion of quasiconformality (surface strips in Gr¨otzsch’s terminology, extremal
length in Ahlfors’ terminology). We refer the reader to a simple and elegant
formulation of the problem (known as the Gr¨otzsch problem (see [9]; [43],
Section 1.10). It is known, that the simplest and most important conformal
invariant is the modulus of a quadrilateral, i.e., the ratio of the lengths of the
sides of a relevant conformally equivalent rectangle. Suppose that two topo-
logical quadrilaterals D and D′ are deﬁned by a ﬁxed order of their vertices.
We intend to construct a homeomorphism f : D →D′ with a natural agree-
ment of the vertices which is the most nearly conformal map. The deviation
of this homeomorphism from a conformal one can be measured by K(f) that
maximizes the ratio of the maximal and minimal diameters of the images
of inﬁnitesimal disks from D. Then, the extremal homeomorphism f ∗is an
aﬃne map up to the conformal maps of D and D′ onto rectangles. If M(D)
is the modulus of D and M(D′) ≥M(D), then K(f ∗) = M(D′)/M(D).
A sense preserving homeomorphism f of a domain Ω ⊂C into the Rie-
mann sphere C is said to be a quasiconformal map if for any quadrilat-
eral D ⊂Ω the ratio M(f(D))/M(D) is ﬁnite; a K–quasiconformal map if
M(D)/K ≤M(f(D)) ≤KM(D). So, the homeomorphism f ∗is extremal
for the latter inequality.
The conformal invariant M(D) of a quadrilateral D is equal to the mod-
ulus of the family of curves that join two opposite sides of D. Here a link
appears between the notion of quasiconformality and the modulus of a fam-
ily of curves. The modulus is a realization of a so-called length-area principle
where the lengths of curves in some metric and the reduced area that they
sweep out are taken into account together. Let us give a simple deﬁnition.
Let Γ be a family of curves in Ω and P be a family of diﬀerential metrics
ρ(z)|dz| on Ω with a non-negative, real, square integrable density ρ(z) on Ω,
and

γ
ρ(z)|dz| ≥1,
for any
γ ∈Γ.
(1.1)
If P ̸= ∅, then one can say that for Γ the modulus problem is formulated
and the modulus in this problem is deﬁned as
m(Γ) := inf
ρ∈P

ρ2(z) dxdy, z = x + iy.
(1.2)
In the classical deﬁnition (see e.g. [9]; [64], Deﬁnition 2.6) the Lebesgue inte-
grals are considered in (1.1), (1.2) as well as locally rectiﬁable curves. Here

1. INTRODUCTION
and further on, we refer the reader to Tamrazov’s [146], [149] approach to
conditions of admissibility, to deﬁnitions of metrics, families of curves, lin-
ear integrals, and moduli where one can abandon rectiﬁability of curves and
Borelian metrics and can consider only measured metrics and arbitrary (not
necessary rectiﬁable) curves. It is important when we consider the quasicon-
formal images of rectiﬁable curves (see an example by P. Belinski˘ı [16] of
the non-rectiﬁable quasiconformal image of a rectiﬁable curve). To make this
possible we consider in (1.1) the lower Darboux integral instead of the usual
Lebesgue one, and keep the Lebesgue integral in (1.2). Under these conditions
all the results about the moduli and the extremal partitions remain true. This
will help us to avoid diﬃculties when we will consider quasiconformal images
of curves. We remark here that there are other approaches to generalize the
deﬁnition of the modulus. For example, J. Hersch, A. Pﬂuger [59] suggested to
use the upper Darboux integral in (1.2); B. Fuglede [42] considered Borelian
metrics ρ(ζ)|dζ|. But in a view of later applications, Tamrazov’s approach
seems to be the best one. There exists another way to avoid the problem of
non-rectiﬁability. Considering the quasiconformal image of a homotopy class
of curves one observes that the set of non-rectiﬁable images sweeps out a
plane null set. Therefore, they does not contribute to the value of (1.2) (see
C. Anreian Cazacu [7]).
The main and simple properties of the modulus one can learn from the
advanced monograph by J. Jenkins [64]. They are the conformal invariance of
the modulus and the uniqueness (essentially) of the extremal metric in (1.2).
But the existence and the form of such a metric turns out to be a much more
diﬃcult problem. Simple cases of families of curves on a quadrilateral and on
a doubly connected hyperbolic domain still have been only known for a long
time. The works by J. Jenkins [63], [64], K. Strebel [141], and G. Kuz’mina
[78] are concerned with the proofs of the existence of the extremal metrics
in non-trivial cases. Important results have been obtained by J. Jenkins in
his famous article [63] by the application of Schiﬀer’s special variations [119],
and then, generalized by G. Kuz’mina [78]–[85], E. Emel’yanov [34], [36],
and A. Solynin [138], [139] . They established the connection between the
modulus problem and the problem of the extremal partition of a Riemann
surface by domains of special shape. These results reﬂect the geometric and
variational-analytic nature of the modulus and stipulate further development
of the modulus method. Nowadays, it has become a powerful tool of investiga-
tion in the theory of conformal and quasiconformal mappings. Many diﬃcult
problems have been solved by this method, e.g., geometric problems posed
by N. Chebotarev, M. Lavrentiev, O. Teichm¨uller (see G. Kuz’mina [78],
S. Fedorov [40]); problems of the potential theory (see M. Ohtsuka [107],
P. Tamrazov [147]–[149], N. Zori˘ı [180], [181], V. Shlyk [128], [129]); vari-
ational and isoperimetric problems (see J. Jenkins [62], [64], G. Kuz’mina
[78]–[80], I. Mityuk [101], A. Solynin [132], E. Emel’yanov [34], S. Fedorov

Riemann manifolds (see J. V¨ais¨al¨a [171], P. Tamrazov [149], F. Gehring [45],

B. Sultanov [13], and V. Shlyck [128]).
There are many problems of conformal mapping solved by the modulus
method that could not be solved by other methods or there were insuperable
technical obstacles surveyed, e.g., in [64], [78], [30]. Among these problems we
meet covering theorems in diﬀerent classes of conformal mappings [40], [78],
[79]; estimations of growth, distortion, and their mutual variation in these
classes [34], [41], [62], [79], [163]; estimations of the product of conformal radii
of non-overlapping domains [29], [78], problems connected with the harmonic
measure [28], [133]–[136], etc.
This monograph covers applications of the modulus method in connection
with the extremal partitions of Riemann surfaces to a number of extremal
problems of conformal mapping (Chapter 3) and quasiconformal mapping
(Chapter 4). In Chapter 5 we extend the modulus onto Teichm¨uller spaces
and derive various properties of the modulus dependent on the conformal
structure of the underlying Riemann surface. There we also deal with metric
problems of the Teichm¨uller theory.

2. Moduli of Families of Curves and Extremal
Partitions
This chapter contains an introductory course of the extremal length method
in the form of the modulus of a family of curves in connection with the ex-
tremal partition of Riemann surfaces. For convenience, we introduce in Sec-
tion 2.4 a catalogue of the most frequently used moduli of rings and quadri-
laterals, reduced moduli of circular domains and digons, and summarize in
Section 2.3 the information on some elliptic functions and integrals.
Throughout the book we use the following notations:
C = {z = x + iy : |z| < ∞} the ﬁnite complex plane,
C = C ∪{∞} the compactiﬁcated complex plane or the Riemann sphere,
U = {z ∈C : |z| < 1} the unit disk,
U(a, r) = {z ∈C : |z −a| < r},
a ∈C, r > 0,
U(0, 1) = U,
if D ⊂C is a domain, then ∂D is the usual boundary operator of D, D is
the closure of D,
Lp is the class of Lebesgue p-integrable functions.
If f(z) is a complex valued function, z ∈D, then f(D) := {w ∈C : w =
f(z), z ∈D}.
2.1 Simple deﬁnition and properties of the modulus
Basic deﬁnitions and theorems of this section in some form one can ﬁnd in
[9], [64], [78], [107], [141].
2.1.1 Deﬁnition
Let D be a domain in C and a function ρ(z) be real-valued, measurable,
almost everywhere non-negative, and from L2(D). Let this function deﬁne a
diﬀerential metric ρ on D by ρ := ρ(z)|dz|.
Moreover, we deﬁne a conformal invariant metric ρ which is represented
in D as above. If D = f(D), where w = f(z) is a conformal map, then
ρ(f −1(w))|f ′(w)|−1|dw| ≡ρ(w)|dw| is the metric ρ(w)|dw| that represents ρ
in D. Thus, we construct a metric which is deﬁned on the complete collection
of conformally equivalent domains. This refers to the deﬁnition for an abstract
Riemann surface where the map f means the change of charts.

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
Let γ be a curve in D. The lower Darboux integral

γ
ρ(z)|dz| =: lρ(γ)
(2.1)
is said to be the ρ-length of γ. If ρ(z) ≡1 almost everywhere in D, then the
1-length of any rectiﬁable γ ⊂D coincides with its Euclidian length. In the
non-rectiﬁable case, nevertheless, the integral exists (in the sense of Darboux)
and the deﬁnition is valid. The integral

D
ρ2(z)dσz =: Aρ(D),
dσz = dx · dy,
(2.2)
is called the ρ-area of D.
Let Γ be a family of curves γ in D. Denote by
Lρ(Γ) := inf
γ∈Γ lρ(γ)
the ρ-length of the family Γ. Then, the quantity
m(D, Γ) = inf
ρ
Aρ(D)
L2ρ(Γ)
is said to be the modulus of the family Γ in D where the inﬁmum is taken
over all metrics ρ in D.
Another equivalent and suitable (in a view of further applications) deﬁ-
nition of the modulus can be formulated as follows. Denote by P the family
of all admissible (for Γ) metrics in D, that is, a metric ρ ∈P that satisﬁes
the additional condition lρ(γ) ≥1 for all γ ∈Γ. If P ̸= ∅, then we can deﬁne
the modulus as
m(D, Γ) = inf
ρ∈P Aρ(D).
If there is such metric ρ∗that m(D, Γ) = Aρ∗(D), then this metric is
called extremal. We follow Tamrazov’s approach as it has been mentioned
in Introduction. See there also the discussion about generalizations of this
deﬁnition.
2.1.2 Properties
Now we establish simple but important properties of the modulus m(D, Γ).
Theorem 2.1.1 (conformal invariance). Let Γ be a family of curves in a
domain D ∈C, and w = f(z) be a conformal map of D onto D ∈C. If
Γ := f(Γ), then
m(D, Γ) = m( D, Γ).
(2.3)
In other words, the modulus is well deﬁned in the whole class of conformally
invariant domains.

2.1 Simple deﬁnition and properties of the modulus
9
Proof. Let P be the family of all admissible metrics for Γ and P be the family
of admissible metrics for Γ. We set ρ(z)|dz| = ρ(f(z))|f ′(z)||dz| for ρ ∈P.
Since

ρ(z)|dz| =

γ
ρ(f(z))|f ′(z)||dz| =

f(γ)∈
Γ
ρ(w)|dw| ≥1,
for any γ ∈Γ, we have ρ ∈P. Making use of change of variables under a
conformal map in (2.2) we have Aρ(D) = Aρ( D). Hence,
m(D, Γ) = inf
P Aρ(D) ≤inf
ρ∈P Aρ( D) = m( D, Γ).
Considering the inverse map z = f −1(w) we obtain the reverse inequality
and ﬁnish the proof.

Theorem 2.1.2 (properties of the extremal metric). (i) Let ρ1 and ρ2 be
two extremal metrics for the modulus m(D, Γ). Then, ρ∗:= ρ1 = ρ2 almost
everywhere.
(ii) Moreover, Lρ∗(Γ) = 1.
Proof. (i) Since ρ1 and ρ2 are the extremal metrics for the modulus m(D, Γ),
they are admissible. Then 1

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
Theorem 2.1.3 (monotonicity). If Γ1 ⊂Γ2 in D, then m(D, Γ1) ≤m(D, Γ2).
The proof immediately follows from the inequality Lρ(Γ1) ≥Lρ(Γ2).
Thus, we have established the properties of the conformal invariance of
the modulus and the essential uniqueness of the extremal metric if it exists.
But the most diﬃcult question in the theory is exactly about the existence
of this metric and about its form.
2.1.3 Examples
Now, we give simple examples of domains and families of curves that sheds
light on the general principle of the theory to surmise which metric must be
thought of as an extremal one.
Example 2.1.1. Let D be a rectangle {z = x + iy : 0 < x < l, 0 < y < 1} and
Γ be the family of curves in D that connect the opposite horizontal sides of
D. Then, m(D, Γ) = l.

Proof. The Euclidean metric ρ∗= |dz| is obviously admissible, therefore, the
family P of admissible metrics is non-empty. Moreover, Aρ∗(D) = l and,
consequently, m(D, Γ) ≤l.
Now, let ρ be an admissible metric from P. Then,

for any admissible ρ and, taking the inﬁmum over all ρ, we have m(D, Γ) ≥l.
This means that m(D, Γ) = l and, by Theorem 2.1.2, only the Euclidean
metric is extremal.

Example 2.1.2. Let D be an annulus {z = reiθ : 1 < r < R, 0 < θ ≤2π}
and Γ be the family of curves in D that separate the opposite boundary
components of D. Then, m(D, Γ) =

⋆We will not repeat the proof and ask the reader to do this independently
as an exercise.
From, e.g., [97] one can learn that any hyperbolic doubly connected do-
main D can be conformally mapped onto an annulus {w : 1 < |w| < R} and
R is a conformal invariant of D. This means that if two doubly connected
domains D1 and D2 happen to have the same moduli m(D1, Γ1) = m(D2, Γ1)
with respect to the families of curves that separate their boundary compo-
nents, then there must be a conformal map of D1 onto D2. This special
modulus we denote by M(D). In order to simplify further notations, the
analogous conformal invariant for a quadrilateral D is designated also by
M(D).

2.1 Simple deﬁnition and properties of the modulus
13
Remark 2.1.1. Generally, one could not deduce the modulus of Example 2.1.2
directly as a corollary from Example 2.1.1 using the logarithmic map.
Namely, we can map the rectangle Dz = {z : 0 < x <
1
2π log R, 0 < y ≤
1} onto the annulus {w : 1 < |w| < R} by w = g(z) := exp(2πz). If Γ is
the family of curves that connect the horizontal sides of the rectangle, then
m(Dz, Γ) =
1
2π log R. But g(Γ) does not coincide with the family of curves
that separate the boundary components of the annulus.
By Example 2.1.2 we know now that if D = {z : 1 < |z| < R} and Γ is the
family of curves that separate its boundary components; if D′ = D \ (1, R)
is a quadrilateral with the vertices with the order 1, 1, R, R and Γ ′ is the
family of curves that connect the horizontal sides of D′, then Γ ⊂Γ ′ and
m(D′, Γ ′) = m(D, Γ).
2.1.4 Gr¨otzsch lemmas
Theorem 2.1.4 (1-st Gr¨otzsch lemma). Let D be an annulus D := {z : r <
|z| < R} and D1, . . . , Dn be non-overlapping doubly connected domains that
separate the boundary components of ∂D. If M(D) stands for the modulus of
D with respect to the family of curves that separate its boundary components,
then

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
Obviously, the equality sign appears in (2.4) when ∪n
j=1Dj = D and ∂Dj are
concentric circles for any j.
In order to prove the uniqueness, we suppose ﬁrst that there is a domain
Dk, 1 ≤k ≤n, such that there is no circle centered at the origin which
lies in Dk. Hence, if Γk is the family of curves that separate the boundary
components of Dk, then Lρ∗(Γ) > 1, and by Theorem 2.1.2 this metric is
not extremal for M(Dk) and the inequality sign in (2.4) is substituted by the
strict inequality sign.
Now, we assume that there is a domain Dk, 1 ≤k ≤n such that one of
the boundary components δk of Dk is not a concentric circle. There exists a
conformal map w = f(z) of Dk onto the annulus 1 < |w| < exp(2πM(Dk)).
Then, the metric
|f ′(z)|
2π|f(z)||dz|, z ∈Dk
is extremal for M(Dk). Without loss of generality, we suppose that δk ⊂
∂D′
k := ∂(f −1(1 < |w| < 1 + ε)). Denote by D′′
k := Dk \ D′
k. Then M(Dk) =
M(D′
k) + M(D′′
k). But for a suﬃciently small ε the domain D′
k does not
contain a concentric circle. Therefore, the previous case yields that the metric
ρ∗is not extremal for M(D′

2.2.1 Reduced modulus
Let D ⊂C be a simply connected hyperbolic domain, a ∈D, |a| < ∞. We

ε. The quantity

M(Dε) + 1

16
2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
is said to be the reduced modulus of the circular domain D with respect to
the point a where M(Dε) is the modulus of the doubly connected domain Dε
with respect to the family of curves that separate its boundary components.
By the Riemann mapping theorem there is a unique conformal map w =
f(z) of D onto a disk |w| < R < ∞, such that f(a) = 0, f ′(a) = 1. The
number R is called the conformal radius of D with respect to the point a.
We denote it by R(D, a).
In the case a = ∞the function f has the expansion about ∞as f(z) =
z + a0 + a1/z + . . . and maps D onto the exterior part of the disk |w| > R :=
R(D, ∞).

Fig. 2.6. To the deﬁnition of the reduced modulus
Theorem 2.2.1. Let a simply connected hyperbolic domain D have the con-
formal radius R(D, a) with respect to a ﬁxed point a ∈D. Then, the quantity
m(D, a) exists, ﬁnite, and equal to
1
2π log R(D, a).
Proof. Let w = f(z) = z −a + b2(z −a)2 + . . . be the Riemann mapping.
Then,
{ε(1 + |b2|ε + o(ε)) < |w| < R(D, a)} ⊂f(Dε) ⊂
⊂{ε(1 −|b2|ε −o(ε)) < |w| < R(D, a)}.
By Theorem 2.1.3 and Example 2.1.2 we have the inequality
1
2π log
R(D, a)
ε(1 + |b2|ε + o(ε)) ≤M(Dε) = M(f(Dε)) ≤1
2π log
R(D, a)
ε(1 −|b2|ε −o(ε)).
Then, we add
1
2π log ε to all parts of the latter inequality and take the limit
as ε →0. This leads to the statement of the theorem.
2
Corollary 2.2.1. Let D be a simply connected hyperbolic domain, a ∈D,
|a| < ∞. If f(z) is a conformal map of D such that |f(a)| < ∞, then
m(f(D), f(a)) = m(D, a) +
1
2π log |f ′(a)|

2.2 Reduced moduli and capacity
17
Now, we deﬁne the reduced modulus m(D, ∞) of a simply connected
domain D, ∞∈D with respect to inﬁnity as the reduced modulus of the
image of D under the map 1/z with respect to the origin,
m(D, ∞) = −1
2π log R(D, ∞).
So, if D is a simply connected hyperbolic domain, a ∈D, |a| < ∞, and
f(z) = a−1/(z −a) + a0 + a1(z −a) + . . . is a conformal map from D, then
m(f(D), ∞) = m(D, a) −
1
2π log |a−1|.
2.2.2 Capacity and transﬁnite diameter
We give all deﬁnitions only for compact sets, however, there are general-
izations to the Borel sets as well. Denote by Lip (D) the class of functions
u(z) : D →R satisfying the Lipschitz condition in D, i.e., for every function
u ∈Lip (D) there is a constant K such that for any two points z1, z2 ∈D
the inequality |u(z1) −u(z2)| ≤K|z1 −z2| holds. In the case ∞∈D the
continuity of u(z) at ∞is required. Functions from Lip (C) are absolutely
continuous on lines which are parallel to the axes and the integral
I(u) :=

C
|∇u(z)|2dσz
exists.
An ordered pair of non-overlapping compact sets D1, D2 is called the
condenser C = {D1, D2} with the ﬁeld C \ {D1 ∪D2}. The capacity of a
condenser C is the quantity cap C := inf I(u) as u ranges over the class
Lip (C) and 0 ≤u(z) ≤1 whenever z ∈C, u(z) ≡0 whenever z ∈D1,
u(z) ≡1 whenever z ∈D2.
A condenser C is said to be admissible if there exists a continuous real-
valued in C function ω(z), 0 ≤ω(z) ≤1 which is harmonic in C \ {D1 ∪D2}
and ω(z) ≡0 for z ∈D1, ω(z) ≡1 for z ∈D2. This function is said to be a
potential . The Dirichlet principle yields that in the deﬁnition of capacity the
equality appears only in the case of an admissible condenser and u(z) ≡ω(z)
almost everywhere for the potential function ω.
Obviously, the capacity is a conformal invariant, that is, if Cf is a con-
denser C \ f(C \ {D1 ∪D2}) for a conformal map f in C \ {D1 ∪D2}, then
cap C = cap Cf.
If D1 and D2 are simply connected domains, then we can construct the
conformal map w = f(z) of C \ {D1 ∪D2} onto an annulus 1 < |w| < R and
the potential function for the condenser C = {D1, D2} is
ω(z) =

ω(z) ≡0 for z ∈D1, ω(z) ≡1 for z ∈D2. Therefore, cap C = 2π/ log R.
Let C = {D1, D2} and Ck = {Dk

that all Ck have non-intersected ﬁelds and

(possibly with the equality sign see, e.g., [30]).
Let D be a compact bounded set. We consider a condenser of special type
CR = {|z| ≥R, D}. If CR1,R2 = {|z| ≤R1, |z| ≥R2}, R1 < R2, then the
inequality (2.5) implies

exists and is said to be the logarithmic capacity of a compact set D ⊂C. The
limit (2.6) is also known as Pﬂuger’s theorem (see e.g. [112], Theorem 9.17).
Now we brieﬂy summarize the deﬁnition and some properties of the log-
arithmic capacity of a compact bounded set D ⊂C following Fekete. For
n = 2, 3, . . . we consider
Δn(D) =
max
z1,...,zn∈D
n

1≤k<j≤n
|zk −zj|.
The maximum exists and holds for so-called Fekete points znk ∈∂D, k =
1, . . . , n. The value Δn is equal to the Vandermonde determinant
Δn(D) =

det
k=1,...,n(1 znk . . . zn−1
nk )
.
Then, the limit
cap D = lim
n→∞(Δn(D))
2
n(n−1)
exists (see [112]) and gives the same quantity of the logarithmic capacity or
the transﬁnite diameter (see also [109]).

2.2 Reduced moduli and capacity
19
Let D be a continuum in C and D′ = C \ D. Then, from the deﬁnition of
the logarithmic capacity and the reduced modulus it is clear that cap D =
cap ∂D = exp(−2π m(D′, ∞)).
It is well known that for D = [0, 1] its capacity is given by cap D = 1/4.
If we have a condenser C(h) = {D1, D2} of special type D1 ⊂U, D2 = C\
U, then cap C(h) is said to be the hyperbolic capacity of D1 and cap (h)D1 =
cap C(h). One can deﬁne also cap (h)D by means of the hyperbolic transﬁnite
diameter. Denote by
Δ(h)
n (D) =
max
z1,...,zn∈D
n

1≤k<j≤n
 zk −zj
1 −zkzj
.
Then,
cap (h) D = lim
n→∞(Δ(h)
n (D))
2
n(n−1) .
Now, if D is a continuum in U and D′ = U \ D, then
cap (h) D = cap (h) ∂D = exp(−2πM(D′)),
where M(D′) is the modulus of the doubly connected domain D′ with respect
to the family of separating curves.
2.2.3 Digons, triangles and their reduced moduli
We are also concerned with another quantity that has appeared rather re-
cently in [36], [81], [139]. It is called the reduced modulus of a digon. We will
use this reduced modulus as well as the reduced modulus of triangles to solve
problems on conformal maps (see also [162], [164], [166], [168], [169]). The
existence of the reduced moduli of digons or triangles is closely connected
with the existence of the angular derivative of a conformal map at the vertex
of the ﬁgure in question. Therefore, we are particularly interested in these
quantities to apply them further to study extremal problems for the angular
derivatives.
We deﬁne the reduced modulus of digons. For details we refer to the papers
by E. G. Emel’yanov [36], G. V. Kuz’mina [81], some recent particulars and
the connection with the angular derivatives one can see in [135], [139], [166],
[168].
An important notion in the problems of the boundary behaviour of con-
formal maps (see [112]) is the Stolz angle at a point ζ ∈∂U that is of the
form
Δζ = {z ∈U : | arg (1 −¯ζz)| < θ, |z −ζ| < η},
with θ ∈(0, π
2 ), η ∈(0, 2 cos θ). We say that f has the angular limit a ∈C at
ζ ∈∂U if f(ζ) →a as z ∈Δζ, z →ζ for any Stolz angle Δζ at ζ. We denote
this angular limit by f(ζ). If the limit f(z) →a exists for all z ∈U, z →ζ,

20
2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
then f turns out to be continuous at ζ as a function on U ∪{ζ}. As one can
see [112], univalent functions in U have the angular limits at almost all points
in ∂U but are continuous there only in some restricted cases. Let us consider
an analytic function f that maps the disk U into itself, f(0) = 0. Then the
angular limit f(ζ) exists for almost all ζ ∈∂U. Moreover, the exceptional set
in ∂U has zero capacity.
We say that f has the angular derivative f ′(ζ) at ζ ∈∂U if the ﬁnite
angular limit f(ζ) exists and if
lim
z→ζ, z∈Δζ
f(z) −f(ζ)
z −ζ
= f ′(ζ).
The angular derivative f ′(ζ) exists if and only if the analytic function f ′(z)
has the angular limit f ′(ζ) (see [112], Proposition 4.7). Generally, very little
can be said about the existence of the angular derivative. However, for self-
maps of U the Julia-Wolﬀlemma (see [112], Proposition 4.13) implies that
the angular derivative f ′(ζ) exists for all points ζ whenever the angular limit
f(ζ) exists and |f(ζ)| = 1 even without assumption of univalence. Further-
more, for the case of univalent functions the McMillan Twist Theorem [98]
says that the angular derivative is ﬁnite at almost all such points. Thus, the
points ζ such that |f(ζ)| = 1 are of particular interest.
Let D be a hyperbolic simply connected domain in C with two ﬁnite ﬁxed
boundary points a, b (maybe with the same support) on its piecewise smooth
boundary. It is called a digon. Set the region S(a, ε) which is the connected
component of D ∩{|z −a| < ε} with the point a in its border. Denote by
Dε the domain D \ {S(a, ε1) ∪S(b, ε2)} for suﬃciently small ε1,2 such that
there is a curve connecting the opposite sides on S(a, ε1) and S(b, ε2). Let
M(Dε) be the modulus of the family of arcs in Dε that connect the boundary
arcs of S(a, ε1) and S(b, ε2) when lie in the circumferences |z −a| = ε1 and
|z −b| = ε2 (we choose a single arc in each circle so that both arcs can be
connected in Dε). If the limit

exists, where ϕa = sup Δa and ϕb = sup Δb are the inner angles and Δa,b
is the Stolz angle inscribed in D at a or b respectively, then it is called the
reduced modulus of the digon D. Various conditions guarantee the existence
of this modulus, whereas even in the case of piecewise analytic boundary
there are examples [139] which show that it is not always the case. The
existence of the limit (2.7) is a local characteristic of the domain D (see
[139], Theorem 1.2). If the domain D is conformal (see the deﬁnition in [112],
page 80) at the points a and b, then ([139], Theorem 1.3) the limit (2.7)
exists. More generally, suppose that there is a conformal map f(z) of the
domain S(a, ε1) ⊂D onto a circular sector, so that the angular limit f(a)
exists which is thought of as a vertex of this sector of angle ϕa. If the function

2.2 Reduced moduli and capacity
21
f has the ﬁnite non-zero angular derivative f ′(a) we say that the domain D
is also conformal at the point a (compare [112], page 80). If the digon D
is conformal at the points a, b then the limit (2.7) exists ([139], Theorem
1.3). It is noteworthy that J. Jenkins and K. Oikawa [68] in 1977 applied
extremal length techniques to study the behaviour of a regular univalent
map at a boundary point. Necessary and suﬃcient conditions were given for
the existence of a ﬁnite non-zero angular derivative. Independently a similar
results have been obtained by B. Rodin and S. E. Warschawski [116].

Fig. 2.7. To the deﬁnition of the reduced modulus of a digon
Theorem 2.2.2. Let the digon D with the vertices at a and b be so that the
limit (2.7) exists and the Stolz angles are ϕa and ϕb . Suppose that there
is a conformal map f(z) of the digon D (which is conformal at a, b) onto
a digon D′, so that there exist the angular limits f(a), f(b) with the inner
angles ψa and ψb at the vertices f(a) and f(b) which we also understand as
the supremum over all Stolz angles inscribed in D′ with the vertices at f(a) or
f(b) respectively. If the function f has the ﬁnite non-zero angular derivatives
f ′(a) and f ′(b), then ϕa = ψa, ϕb = ψb, and the reduced modulus (2.7) of D′
exists and changes [36], [81], [139] according to the rule
m(f(D), f(a), f(b)) = m(D, a, b) + 1
ψa
log |f ′(a)| + 1

log |f ′(b)|
(2.8)
Proof. First we consider a simple case of the slit plane D0 = C \ [0, ∞) as a
digon with the vertices at 0, ∞. Following the deﬁnition of the reduced mod-
ulus, denote by Dε the domain {ε1 < |z| < 1/ε2} \ (ε1, 1/ε2). The modulus
of the quadrilateral Dε with respect to the family of curves that connect its
circular sides is equal to M(Dε) = −
2π
log(ε1ε2). In this case ϕ0 = ϕ∞= 2π.
Therefore,
m(D0, 0, ∞) =

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
Now we consider a digon D such that the conditions of the theorem hold
with the vertices at a and b. There is a conformal univalent map f(z) that
maps D onto D0. Suppose that lim
z→a f(z)(z −a)−2π
ϕa = c1 and lim

ϕa

(see e.g. [112], Proposition 11.8). The same inequality is easily veriﬁed for the
point b. Analogously to Theorem 2.2.1, using the second Gr¨otsch Lemma, we
obtain that

Then we add

ϕb log ε2 to each part of the above inequalities and
derive that there is a limit in the theorem, and it is equal to
1
2π log |d1|
|c1|. This
is equivalent to what the theorem states.

If we suppose, moreover, that f has the expansion
f(z) = w1 + (z −a)ψa/ϕa(c1 + c2(z −a) + . . . )
about the point a, and the expansion
f(z) = w2 + (z −b)ψb/ϕb(d1 + d2(z −a) + . . . )
about the point b, then the reduced modulus of D changes according to the
rule
m(f(D), f(a), f(b)) = m(D, a, b) + 1

Obviously, one can extend this deﬁnition to the case of vertices with inﬁnite
support.
We also consider a quantity which is called the reduced modulus of a
triangle. It is closely connected with the reduced modulus of a digon. For
details we refer to the paper by A. Yu. Solynin [139].
Let D be a hyperbolic simply connected domain in C with three ﬁnite ﬁxed
boundary points z1, z2, and a on its piecewise smooth boundary. Denote by
Dε the domain D \ S(a, ε) for a suﬃciently small ε. Denote by M(Dε) the
modulus of the family of arcs in Dε joining the boundary arc of S(a, ε) that
lies in the circumference |z −a| = ε with the leg of the triangle D which is
opposite to a (we again choose a single arc in the circle so that both arcs can
be connected in Dε). If the limit

exists, where ϕa is the inner angle deﬁned as before, then it is called the
reduced modulus of the triangle D. The conditions for the reduced modulus
to exist are similar to those for the reduced modulus of digons. It turns out
that the reduced modulus exists when D is conformal at a. If there is a
conformal map f(z) of the triangle D onto a triangle D′, so that there exists
the angular limit f(a) with the inner angle ψa at the vertex f(a), if the
function f has the ﬁnite non-zero angular derivative f ′(a), then ϕa = ψf(a)
and the reduced modulus of D exists and changes [139] according to the rule
mΔ(f(D), f(a)) = mΔ(D, a) + 1
ψa
log |f ′(a)|.
If we suppose, moreover, that f has the expansion
f(z) = w1 + (z −a)ψa/ϕa(c1 + c2(z −a) + . . . )
in a neighbourhood of the point a, then the reduced modulus of D is changed
by the rule
mΔ(f(D), f(a)) = mΔ(D, a) + 1
ψa
log |c1|.
2.3 Elliptic functions and integrals
In this section we present some useful information and formulae about elliptic
functions and integrals that we will use throughout the following sections. A
major part of this section can be found in e.g. [3], [22], [57].
2.3.1 Elliptic functions
A meromophic function in the complex plane with two periods ω1, ω2, such
that Im ω2
ω1 > 0, is called an elliptic function. If (ω1, ω2) is a pair of primitive
(or reduced) periods of a non-constant meromorphic function f(z), they form
a basis of the set of all periods of f. Each period ω is of the form ω =
mω1 + nω2, where m, n are some integers. The points ω form a lattice in C,
therefore, the set {mω1 +nω2} is called the period-lattice with (ω1, ω2) as the
basis. Any other basic periods (ω∗
1, ω∗
2) of the same elliptic function f(z) can
be described by a unimodular transform τ →τ ∗. That is, denote by τ = ω2
ω1
and τ ∗= ω∗

ω∗

1 = mω1 + nω2 and ω∗
2 = pω1 + pω2. Then,
τ ∗= qτ + p
mτ + n.

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES

A parallelogram constructed by basic periods is called a period-parallelogram.
The parallelogram constructed by the basic primitive periods is called a fun-
damental period parallelogram. A non-constant elliptic function has at least
one pole in any period-parallelogram.

Integrals of the form

R(x,

P(x))dx, where P(x) is a polynomial of the
third or fourth degree and R is a rational function are known to be the elliptic
integrals. They were ﬁrst treated systematically by Legendre, who showed
that any elliptic integral can be represented by means of three fundamental
integrals F (ϕ, k), E (ϕ, k), and Π(ϕ, n, k). They are the Legendre canonical
elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst, second, and third kind respectively. The elliptic
functions of Abel, Jacobi, and Weierstrass are obtained by the inversion of
elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst kind. For a real number 0 < k < 1, that is called
the modulus, let us deﬁne

and x = sin ϕ.
When x = 1 (or ϕ = π/2), the above integrals are said to be complete.
In that case, one writes K (k) := F (π/2, k), E (k) = E (π/2, k), Π(k) =
Π(π/2, n, k). The associated complete elliptic integrals are given by K ′(k) ≡
K (k′), E ′(k) ≡E (k′). They satisfy the Legendre relation E K ′ + E ′K −

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
It is evident that
sn (−ω) = −sn (ω),
cn (−ω) = cn (ω),
dn (−ω) = dn (ω).
Jacobi’s functions are 4K (k)-periodic. More rigorously,
sn (ω ± 2K (k)) = −sn (ω), cn (ω ± 2K (k)) = −cn (ω),
dn (ω + 2K (k)) = dn (ω).
It is seen that 2K (k) is a period of dn (ω) and tn (ω) ≡sn (ω)
cn (ω). Some special
values are given as
sn (2K (k)) = 0, cn (2K (k)) = −1, dn (2K (k)) = 1,
sn (4K (k)) = 0, cn (4K (k)) = 1,
dn (4K (k)) = 1.
sn (ω ± 2K ′(k), k′) = −sn (ω, k′),
sn (ω ± 4K ′(k), k′) = sn (ω, k′),
etc.
The addition-theorem for sn , cn , dn asserts that
sn (u + v) = sn (u)cn (v)dn (v) + sn (v)cn (u)dn (u)

cn (u + v) = cn (u)cn (v) −dn (u)dn (v)sn (u)sn (v)

dn (u + v) = dn (u)dn (v) −k2cn (u)cn (v)sn (u)sn (v)
1 −k2sn 2(u)sn 2(v)
.
The imaginary Jacobi’s transforms are deﬁned as
sn (iω, k) = i tn (ω, k′),
cn (iω, k) =
1
cn (ω, k′),
dn (iω, k) = dn (ω, k′)
cn (ω, k′) .
The continuation of the real Jacobi’s transforms into the complex ω-plane
gives the elliptic functions with the primitive periods represented by K and
K ′.
The periods of sn (ω, k) are 4K (k) and 2iK ′(k).
The periods of cn (ω, k) are 4K (k) and 2K (k) + 2iK ′(k).
The periods of dn (ω, k) are K (k) and 4iK ′(k).
The Theta Functions of Jacobi are auxiliary functions in many problems
involving elliptic functions. They are deﬁned by the Fourier series

2.5 Symmetrization and polarization
A good collection of results about symmetrization and polarization is the con-
tents of the survey by V. Dubinin [30] and the series of articles by A. Solynin
[133]–[136]. Here we present only a part of them that we will apply further.
2.5.1 Circular symmetrization
a) Let D be a simply connected hyperbolic domain in C. Deﬁne a point O
as a center of symmetrization and a ray l+ starting at O as the direction of
symmetrization. A domain D∗is said to be the result of circular symmetriza-
tion with the center at O and the direction l+ if any circle centered on O
lies or does not in D and D∗simultaneously. If this circle has an intersection
with D of linear Lebesgue measure m, then it has the intersection with D∗
that is a symmetric arc about l+ of the same measure. Obviously, D and D∗
have the same area.
b) Now let D be a doubly connected hyperbolic domain and K1 and K2 be its
complements with respect to C. Denote by K∗
1 and K∗
2 the results of circular
symmetrization of K1 and K2 with the direction l+ and l−respectively where
the ray l−starts at O in the antipodal direction to l+. Then, D∗= C\{K∗
1 ∪
K∗
2} is said to be the result of circular symmetrization of the doubly connected
domain D.

D∗

c) Let D be a quadrilateral with the opposite sides on the unit circle, D′
be its reﬂection under the map 1/z. Then, the domain D ∪D′ with their
common boundary is a doubly connected domain G. Denote by G∗the result
of circular symmetrization (b) with respect to the origin and the positive real
axis. Then, D∗= G∗∩U is said to be the result of circular symmetrization of
the quadrilateral D. One can obviously extend this deﬁnition to an arbitrary
disk instead of the unit one.

2.5 Symmetrization and polarization
35
There are other types of symmetrization as, e.g., the Steiner symmetriza-
tion that one can imagine as a circular symmetrization with the inﬁnite cen-
ter, the Schwarz symmetrization, the elliptic symmetrization and others. For
these we refer to the excellent survey by V. Dubinin [30].
The main result on symmetrization is the monotonic change of moduli
deﬁned for the above mentioned domains.
Theorem 2.5.1 (Polya [108], Jenkins [64]). Let D be a doubly connected
hyperbolic domain in C and D∗be the result of circular symmetrization as in
(b). Let M(D) be the modulus of D with respect to the family of curves that
separate its boundary components. Then, M(D) ≤M(D∗) with the equality
only in the case when D∗is a rotation of D with respect to the center of
symmetrization.
The limiting form of this theorem is the following.
Corollary 2.5.1. Let D be a simply connected hyperbolic domain and c ∈
D. Let D∗be the result of circular symmetrization as in (a). Denote by c∗
the circular projection of c onto l+. Then, the reduced modulus m(D, c) ≤
m(D∗, c∗) with the same condition for the equality sign.
Theorem 2.5.2 (Jenkins [64]). Let D be a quadrilateral in the disk U(O, R)
with two opposite sides on the circumference ∂U(O, R) and D∗be the result
of circular symmetrization as in (c). Let M(D) be the modulus of D with
respect to the family of curves that connect its circular boundary components.
Then, M(D) ≤M(D∗) with the equality sign only in the case when D∗is a
rotation of D with respect to the center of symmetrization O.
The proofs, however, would take us to far aﬁeld. One can ﬁnd them in the
famous monograph by J. Jenkins [64]. The limiting form of Theorem 2.5.2
that leads to symmetrization of digons was obtained by A. Yu. Solynin in
[135].
2.5.2 Polarization
Another powerful tool close to symmetrization is polarization.
d) We begin with polarization of an arbitrary set. Let l+ and l−be a straight
line l with two opposite orientations. Consider a set A and denote by A∗the
set that is symmetric to A with respect to the line l, by A+– the part of A
left to l+, by A−– the part of A left to l+. The set P +(A) := (A ∪A∗)+ ∪
(A∩A∗)−∪(A∩l) we call the result of polarization of the set A with respect
to the straight line l+. One can consider the set P −(A) = (A ∪A∗)−∪(A ∩
A∗)+ ∪(A ∩p) which is also the result of polarization of A with respect to
l−.
e) Polarization of a doubly connected domain D. We consider a doubly con-
nected hyperbolic domain D and assume C \ D = E1 ∪E2. Denote by E′
j the

Fig. 2.11. Linear polarization of a simply connected domain
domain that contains a connected component of P +(Ej) left to l+ (of course,
E′
j can lie in both half-planes). Then, the set P +(D) = C \ {E′
1 ∪(E′
2)∗} is
said to be the result of polarization of the doubly connected domain D with
respect to the straight line l+. The same deﬁnition is valid for P −(D). Ob-
serve that P −(D) is symmetric to P +(D) substituting E1 →E2, E2 →E1.
f) Polarization of a quadrilateral D. Let D be a quadrilateral with the op-
posite sides on the unit circle, D′ be its reﬂection under the map 1/z. The
domain D ∪D′ with their common boundary is a doubly connected domain
G. Denote by P +(G) the result of polarization (e) with respect to the straight
line l+ passing through the origin. Then, P +(D) = P +(G) ∩U is said to be
the result of polarization of the quadrilateral D with respect to l+. One can
obviously extend this deﬁnition to an arbitrary disk instead of the unit one.
Theorem 2.5.3 (Wolontis [176], Dubinin [30]). Let C = {D1, D2} be a con-
denser in C and P(C) = {P +(D1), P −(D2)} be the result of polarization as
in (d). Then, cap C ≥cap P(C) with the equality sign only in the case when
P(C) coincides with C or is symmetric to C with respect to l.
This result implies the following theorem.
Theorem 2.5.4 (Solynin [137]). Let D be a doubly connected hyperbolic do-
main in C and P +(D) be the result of polarization as in (e). Let M(D) be the
modulus of D with respect to the family of curves that separate its boundary
components. Then, M(D) ≤M(P +(D)) with the equality sign only in the
case when P +(D) coincides with D or is symmetric to D with respect to l.
Theorem 2.5.5 (Solynin [137]). Let D be a quadrilateral in the disk U(O, R)
with two opposite sides on the circumference ∂U(O, R) and P +(D) be the

2.6 Quadratic diﬀerentials on Riemann surfaces

result of polarization as in (f). Let M(D) be the modulus of D with respect
to the family of curves that connect its circular boundary components. Then,
M(D) ≤M(P +(D)) with the equality sign only in the case when P +(D)
coincides with D or is symmetric to D with respect to l.
The following exercises use polarization or symmetrization.
⋆Let D(θ) = U \ {[0, r1] ∪[0, r2eiθ]}, 0 < rk < 1, 0 ≤θ < 2π. Prove
that M(D(θ)) decreases in 0 ≤θ ≤π as a function of θ and increases in
π ≤θ ≤2π.
⋆The limiting form of Theorem 2.5.4. Let D′(θ) = U \{[r1, 1)∪[r2eiθ, eiθ0},
0 < rk < 1, 0 ≤θ < 2π. Prove that the reduced modulus m(D′(θ), 0)
decreases in 0 ≤θ ≤π as a function of θ and increases in π ≤θ ≤2π.

⋆Polarization+ symmetrization. Let D = C \ {(−∞, 0] ∪[1, R]}, D1 =
C \ {γ1, γ2} where γ1 is a curve that connects 0 with ∞and γ2 connects
1 with R such that the curve γ2 is not homotopic to the segment [1, R] on
C \ {0, 1, R} and γ1 ∩γ2 = ∅. Prove that M(D) ≥M(D1) with the equality
sign only if D = D1.
⋆Let D be a convex simply connected domain, i.e., any segment connecting
two points of D lies in D. Is it true, that D∗(symmetrization (a)) remains
convex?
2.6 Quadratic diﬀerentials on Riemann surfaces
A great collection of deﬁnitions and results about quadratic diﬀerentials one
can ﬁnd in monographs by well known analysts J. Jenkins [64] and K. Strebel
[141]. Here we present only some basic deﬁnitions and facts. We also refer
the reader to [38], [105], [106], [131], [140] for the deﬁnitions and properties
of Riemann surfaces.
2.6.1 Riemann surfaces
A Riemann surface S is a connected topological Hausdorﬀspace M with an
open covering Uj and a system of homeomorphisms gj such that gj : S →
C and in a non-empty intersection Uj ∩Uk the vicinity relation gj ◦g−1
k
is conformal. The set of pairs (charts) {Uj, gj} is said to be a conformal
structure on S. Two structures {U 1
j , g1
j } and {U 2
j , g2
j } are called equivalent
if their union is also a conformal structure on S. So, two Riemann surfaces
with equivalent conformal structures and the same underlying topological
space M are thought of as the same Riemann surface. The space S is a
connected component of 1-dimensional complex analytic manifold and itself
is an oriented manifold. Any ﬁnite compact Riemann surface is topologically

38
2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
equivalent to a sphere with a ﬁnite number of handles that is said to be the
genus of this surface. The genus is a topological invariant.
A bordered Riemann surface S is also a connected Hausdorﬀspace M
with charts containing an open covering Uj and a system of homeomorphisms
gj with the properties as above but gj acts from M into the closed upper
half-plane and all vicinity relations are again conformal. If there is a neigh-
bourhood Uj of a point p ∈M with a real interval as a part of its boundary,
and gj : Im gj(p) = 0, then this point is supposed to be from the border of
S. All such points form the border of S.
Let p ∈S and let us consider a class [c] of all closed curves homotopic on
S (continuous quotient maps from [0, 1] into S) with endpoints at p and of
given orientation. Suppose that c represents [c]. We deﬁne the product oper-
ation c1c2 as a union of c1 and c2 with the corresponding orientation. The
inverse operation c−1 is deﬁned as the same curve with the reverse orienta-
tion. A point is considered to be a 0-curve. The same operations are easily
understandable for homotopy classes [c1][c2] = [c1c2], [c]−1 = [c−1], [1] is a
class of curves homotopic to p. These classes with operations deﬁned form a
so called fundamental group π(S, p) of the surface S with respect to the point
p chosen. A curve γ connecting the point p with another point p1 produces
an isomorphism [γcγ−1] of fundamental groups π(S, p) and π(S, p1). So, we
can speak about a single fundamental group π(S) up to an isomorphism.
For any subgroup F of the fundamental group π(S) of the given surface
S one can construct a new Riemann surface S∗which is non-branched, un-
bounded over S, and π(S∗) = F. This surface is a covering surface of S
and the deck homeomorphism σ of S∗onto itself leaves the traces of points
from S∗invariant. For the trivial subgroup F = [1] the covering surface ˜S
is said to be the universal covering of S. The surface ˜S is simply connected
and, by the uniformization theorem of Koebe and Poincar´e, there is a con-
formal homeomorphism h of ˜S onto either U, C, or else C. So, the surface
is said to be hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic respectively. In particular, a hy-
perbolic simply connected domain has more than two boundary points. The
homeomorphism σ produces a conformal automorphisms h(σ) of one of the
canonical domains and the function J ◦h−1 with the projection J : ˜S →S is
an automorphic analytic function with an invariant group of automorphisms
of the canonical domain. Further, the universal cover is to be identiﬁed with
its canonical conformal image under h. We denote by G the group of auto-
morphisms of the canonical domain that corresponds to the group of deck
transformations for ˜S. So, any Riemann surface S is to be identiﬁed with
the quotient S = D/G up to conformal equivalence, where D is a canonical
domain. We say that G uniformizes the surface S.
All elliptic Riemann surfaces are conformally equivalent to the Riemann
sphere C. The group G in this case consists of fractional linear conformal au-
tomorphisms of C. All parabolic Riemann surfaces are conformally equivalent
either to the plane C, the punctured plane C\{0}, or the torus. The group G

2.6 Quadratic diﬀerentials on Riemann surfaces
39
in this case is either trivial or else consists of transformations z′ = z + nω, or
z′ = z +nω1 +mω2 where ω, ω1, ω2 are complex numbers with Im ω2/ω1 ̸= 0
and n, m are some integers. All other Riemann surfaces are of hyperbolic
type and G is a subgroup of the M¨obius group M¨ob of all conformal auto-
morphisms of U. They are of the form
z →eiθ z −a
1 −z¯a, a ∈U, 0 ≤θ < 2π.
In this case the group G is called the Fuchsian group. The fundamental do-
main D of the Fuchsian group G is a factor set of the points of U that are not
equivalent with respect to the actions from G. Geometrically this fundamen-
tal domain is a hyperbolic polygon in U bounded by arcs of orthocircles or
∂U. If this polygon has a ﬁnite number of sides, then the group G is ﬁnitely
generated. A Riemann surface S with a ﬁnitely generated uniformizing group
G is said to be a ﬁnite Riemann surface. If it is of genus g, then there are
generators A1, B1, . . . , Ag, Bg of the group G with hyperbolic ﬁxed points on
∂U corresponding to 4g from 4g + 2(n + r) sides of D. If it has, moreover,
n punctures and r branch points, then there are generators C1, . . . , Cn+r of
the group G corresponding to n parabolic ﬁxed points of C1, . . . , Cn (cusps
of ∂D) and r elliptic points of Cn+1, . . . , Cn+r (vertices of D from U). These
generators satisfy the normalization

If a surface S has additionally l hyperbolic boundary components, then this
surface is said to be of ﬁnite type (g, n, l).
2.6.2 Quadratic diﬀerentials
Let g, n, l, m be non-negative integers and S0 be a Riemann surface of ﬁnite
type (g, n, l) or (g, n) when l = 0, i.e., it is of genus g and has n punctures
and l hyperbolic boundary components (with the border if l ̸= 0). S0 can
have a ﬁnite number of branch points. If 6g −6 + 2n + 3l > 0, then S0 is of
hyperbolic conformal type and its universal covering is conformally equivalent
to the unit disk U = {z : |z| < 1}. The deck mappings that replace the sheets
of the universal covering induce a corresponding Fuchsian group G0 of M¨obius
automorphisms of U. The elements of G0 map the fundamental polygons of
S0 onto themselves. One says that the Fuchsian group G0 uniformizes the
Riemann surface S0 and this Riemann surfaces is to be idetiﬁed with the
quotient S0 = U/G0.
We say that a holomorphic (meromorphic) quadratic diﬀerential ϕ is de-
ﬁned on S0 if for any local parameter ζ of S0 there is a holomorphic (meromor-
phic) function ϕ(ζ) deﬁned in the parametric neighbourhood. This function
satisﬁes the condition of the invariance respectively to a change of parame-
ters, i.e., if ϕ∗and ϕ are two representations of the diﬀerential in terms of
the parameters ζ∗and ζ, then

for the vicinity relation ζ(ζ∗) deﬁned in the intersection of the paramet-
ric neighbourhoods. We denote these quadratic diﬀerentials simply by ϕ or
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 in terms of the local parameter ζ. Let J0(z) be the projection of the
universal covering of S0 (which is realized as U) onto S0. Deﬁne the pull-
back q(z)dz2 of the quadratic diﬀerential ϕ onto the universal cover U by the
formula q(z) = ϕ(J0(z))(J′
0(z))2. Since J0 is an automorphic function with
respect to the group G0, the invariance condition for the diﬀerential q(z)dz2
is satisﬁed as q(γ(z))(γ′(z))2 = q(z) in so far as z ∈U, γ ∈G0.
Let us consider the conformal invariant metric

|ϕ(ζ)||dζ| associated
with a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ. The element of length in this metric is
|dw| =

|ϕ(ζ)||dζ|. A maximal regular curve on S0 such that the inequality
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 > 0 holds on it we call a trajectory of ϕ; an orthogonal trajectory
if it satisﬁes the reverse inequality ϕ(ζ)dζ2 < 0. The trajectories and or-
thogonal trajectories are connected with the inner diﬀerential structure and
do not depend on a local parameter. We call a trajectory (or an orthogonal
one) critical if there is a zero or a pole in its closure. Other trajectories are
regular. The rigorous description of the local and global trajectory structure
will be given in the next subsections and can be found in J. Jenkins [64] and
K. Strebel [141].
A trajectory of a diﬀerential ϕ on the Riemann surface S0 is called ﬁnite
(or closed in the case of a loop following Strebel’s terminology) if its length
in

|ϕ(ζ)||dζ|-metric is ﬁnite.
One says that a holomorphic (meromorphic) diﬀerential has ﬁnite trajec-
tories if its non-ﬁnite ones run through a plane null-set.
The next propositions give some useful information about the space of
quadratic diﬀerentials with ﬁnite trajectories.
Proposition 2.6.1 (Strebel [141], p. 23). A holomorphic quadratic diﬀeren-
tial on S0 of ﬁnite L1-norm can have at most simple poles on the closure S0
of the surface S0.
Proposition 2.6.2 (Strebel [141], Theorem 21.2). The set of holomorphic
quadratic diﬀerentials on S0 of ﬁxed L1-norm and with ﬁnite trajectories of
given homotopy type is compact (in the local uniform topology on S0).
Proposition 2.6.3 ([141] Theorem 25.2, see also [27] ). On a Riemann sur-
face of type (g, n) quadratic diﬀerentials with ﬁnite trajectories form an ev-
erywhere dense set in the space of all quadratic diﬀerentials of ﬁnite L1 norm.
2.6.3 Local trajectory structure
Now we study the behaviour of trajectories in the neighbourhoods of singu-
larities of a quadratic diﬀerential or the critical points. Many of basic results

2.6 Quadratic diﬀerentials on Riemann surfaces
41
with detail proofs can be found in [141], Chapter III, [64], Chapter 2 . Here we
will summarize the relevant information about the local trajectory structure.
Consider a simplest quadratic diﬀerential dz2 on the Riemann sphere C.
Changing the parameter z →1/z∗one can see that it has the representation
(dz∗)2/(z∗)4 in a neighbourhood of 0 in terms of the parameter z∗. So, this
diﬀerential has a unique singularity at the point ∞which is the pole of order
4. The trajectories of dz2 are, obviously, horizontal lines.
For a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 we introduce a so called natural pa-
rameter
z =
ζ
 
ϕ(ζ)dζ
in a neighbourhood of a regular point of ϕ(ζ)dζ2. So, one can select a single
valued branch of the square root and locally represent

ϕ(ζ) = a0 + a1ζ + . . . , a0 ̸= 0.
Therefore, integrating term by term (this is possible due to the uniform con-
vergence on compacts inside the neighbourhood chosen) we obtain a con-
formal map ζ →z. Thus, the local trajectory structure for ϕ(ζ)dζ2 near a
regular point is the same as for dz2 up to shift and rotation.
Let p0 be a zero of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 of even order n. We consider
it in terms of a local parameter ζ near p0 which represents this zero as 0. In
a suﬃciently small neighbourhood of p0 one can select a single valued branch
of the square root and locally outside ζ = 0 represent

ϕ(ζ) = ζn/2(a0 + a1ζ + . . . ).
Integrating again termwise we obtain a function w = ζ(n+2)/2(b0 + b1ζ + . . . )
that maps the local neighbourhood of the parameter ζ onto an branched
element over w-plane. Introducing a new parameter z : z(n+2)/2 = w we
obtain a conformal map ζ →z which is unique up to the factor exp( 2kπ
n+2),
k = 0, . . . , n + 1. This map satisﬁes the equation
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 =
n + 2

2
zndz2.
Thus, the trajectory structure of ϕ(ζ)dζ2 in a neighbourhood of zero is the
same as for zndz2 up to shift, rotation, and the factor mentioned. The func-
tion w = z(n+2)/2 maps each sector

onto the upper or lower half-plane and all horizontal arcs are the images of
the trajectories of ϕ(ζ)dζ2. For an odd n one can construct the additional

Analogously, if p0 is a simple pole this procedure leads to the same form
of trajectories in the sector 0 < arg z < 2π.
Let p0 be a pole of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 of order 2. This case is distinct
because the function

ϕ(ζ) after integration gives the logarithmic singular-
ity. Further exponentiating leads to the conformal map ζ →z that satisﬁes
the equation

2.6.4 Trajectory structure in the large
The trajectories and orthogonal trajectories of a given diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2
produce a transversal foliation of the Riemann surface.
We give here a classiﬁcation of domains of special types associated with
a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2.
First we suppose that the Riemann surface S0 is of hyperbolic type (g, n).
We consider a holomorphic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 on S0 which can be meromor-
phic on the closure S0 of S0.
1) With a diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 with ﬁnite trajectories and of ﬁnite L1-
norm we associate ring domains. A maximal doubly connected hyperbolic
domain D is said to be a ring domain for ϕ(ζ)dζ2 if there is no singularity in
D, a trajectory passing through a point of D lies in D, and there is a number
R > 1 and a map
z = exp
⎛
⎝c
ζ
 
ϕ(ζ) dζ
⎞
⎠, c ̸= 0
of D onto the ring 1 < |z| < R.
2) With a diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 of ﬁnite L1-norm we associate ring do-
mains and spiral domains. To describe a spiral domain we need some more
deﬁnitions. Let p0 be a regular point of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 on S0 and
the trajectory γ(p0) of ϕ passing through the point p0 is not closed and never
runs into a critical point. We consider the oriented trajectory γ+(p0). Denote
by A the limit set of γ+(p0). Then, [43], Section 2.5; [141], Section 10.2, the
interior of A is a simply connected domain D bounded by ﬁnite critical tra-
jectories of ϕ(ζ)dζ2. Moreover, γ+(p0) = A and, if p ∈A, then γ+(p) = A.
Hereof the domain D is called a spiral domain.

44
2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
3) With a diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 with ﬁnite trajectories we associate ring
domains, circular domains, strip domains, and ending domains.
A maximal simply connected hyperbolic domain D is said to be a circular
domain for ϕ(ζ)dζ2 if there is a unique singularity p0 in D, that is a pole of
order 2, a trajectory passing through a point of D lies in D separating p0
from ∂D, and there is a map
z = exp
⎛
⎝c
ζ
 
ϕ(ζ) dζ
⎞
⎠, c ̸= 0, for ζ ̸= p0, z = 0 for ζ = p0
of D onto the disk |z| < R.
Other types of domains contain no singularity. A maximal simply con-
nected hyperbolic domain D is said to be a strip domain for ϕ(ζ)dζ2 if there
are two singularities p1 and p2 in ∂D, that are poles of order 2, a trajectory
passing through a point of D lies in D connecting p1 and p2, and there is a
map
z =
ζ
 
ϕ(ζ) dζ
of D onto strip a < Im z < b.
A maximal simply connected hyperbolic domain D is said to be an ending
domain for ϕ(ζ)dζ2 if there is a pole p0 of order > 2 in ∂D, a trajectory
passing through a point of D starting and ending in p0 lies in D, and there
is a map
z =
ζ
 
ϕ(ζ) dζ
of D onto the upper or lower half-plane according to the branch of the root.
4) With a diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 without the above restrictions we associate
all types of the domains: ring domains, spiral domains, circular domains,
strip domains, and ending domains.
Now we suppose a Riemann surface S0 to be of hyperbolic type (g, n, l)
with l > 0, the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 has the border of S0 as a trajectory or an
orthogonal trajectory.
5) Suppose that the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 has no singularities on the border
of S0 which is a trajectory of ϕ. Then, the global trajectory structure is
described by the same domains as for the case of compact surfaces with
possible punctures.
6) Suppose that the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 has no singularities on the border
of S0 and a connected component of the border of S0 is an orthogonal tra-
jectory of ϕ. Then, the global trajectory structure is described by the same
domains as for the case of compact surfaces plus quadrangles and triangles

2.6 Quadratic diﬀerentials on Riemann surfaces

as ”semi-rings” and ”semi-strips”. Namely, one can extend symmetrically
the diﬀerential onto the Riemann surface S′ obtained by the inversion of S0
through one of its boundary components.
A

D
with

non-intersected connected boundary components lying on the border of S0 is
said to be a quadrangle for ϕ(ζ)dζ2 if there is no singularity in D, a trajectory

and a map
z =

 
ϕ(ζ) dζ,
of D onto a rectangle Re ζ ∈(a, b), Im ζ ∈(c, d).
A maximal simply connected hyperbolic domain D with a connected
boundary component lying on the border of S0 is said to be a triangle for
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 if there is a pole p0 of order 2 in ∂D, a trajectory passing through a
point of D lies in D, starts at p0, ends in the boundary component of D on
the border of S0 and there is a map
z = exp
⎛

⎞
⎠, c ̸= 0, for ζ ̸= p0, z = 0 for ζ = p0
of D onto U \ [0, 1).
Poles of order 2 on the border of S0 can also produce ”semi-circular”
domains if the border is an orthogonal trajectory of the diﬀerential locally
near such a pole.
The trajectory structure of ϕ(ζ)dζ2 contains a ﬁnite number of non-
overlapping domains of the above types. We do not consider here the case
of more complicated critical points of ϕ in the border of S0. The informa-
tion about the trajectory structure in the large is given by the Jenkins Main
Structure Theorem ([64], Theorem 3.5, and its more complete version in [66]
(see also [139]; [141], Chapter IV).

2.7 Free families of homotopy classes of curves and
extremal partitions
In the development of the modulus method one may distinguish two ap-
proaches which equally connect the moduli of families of curves and quadratic
diﬀerentials with ﬁnite trajectories. The ﬁrst one refers to J. Jenkins [63], [67]
and was developed by P. Tamrazov [146], [149], and G. Kuz’mina [78]–[85].
It comes from the concept of the modulus of a family of curves. This notion
was initially deﬁned by L. Ahlfors and A. Beurling [12] as the reciprocal of
extremal length. The other one is due to K. Strebel [141] (see also [36], [137],
[134], [137], [138], [139]) and comes from the extremal partition of a Riemann
surface by domains of special shape.
2.7.1 The case of ring domains and quadrangles
Let Γ be a family of curves on S0, ρ be a conformal invariant metric ρ(ζ)|dζ|
(in terms of a local parameter ζ), i.e., for any local parameter ζ on the surface
S0 there is a real valued non-negative measurable function ρ(ζ) such that the
following invariance condition is satisﬁed
ρ∗(ζ∗) = ρ(ζ)
 dζ
dζ∗
.
This means that we deﬁne the metric ρ for all conformally equivalent complex
structures on S0 (see also Section 2.1.1). Let P be a family of conformal
invariant metrics ρ on S0 satisfying the following admissible condition [63],
[146], for any γ ∈Γ,

γ
ρ(ζ)|dζ| ≥1.
(2.10)
As in Introduction and Section 2.1.1 we refer to Tamrazov’s [146],[149] ap-
proach to the conditions of admissibility, to the deﬁnitions of metrics, fami-
lies of curves, linear integrals and moduli where one can omit rectiﬁability of
curves and Borelian metrics and can consider only measurable metrics and
arbitrary (not necessary rectiﬁable) curves. Here we consider in (2.10) the
lower Darboux integrals and take the Lebesgue plane integrals in (2.11).
If P ̸= ∅, then one can say that for Γ on S0 the modulus problem is
deﬁned and the modulus in this problem is given as

47
m(S0, Γ) = inf
ρ∈P

S0
ρ2(ζ)dσζ,
(2.11)
where dσζ is the area element on S0.
The main properties of the modulus are the same as in Section 2.1.2,
i.e., its conformal invariance: if f is a conformal mapping S0 →S, then
m(S0, Γ) = m(S, f(Γ)); and the uniqueness of the extremal metric ρ∗.
In other words, the modulus remains the same under a conformal change
of the complex structure of S0. We indicate here an important inequality
m(S0, Γ1) ≤m(S0, Γ2) when Γ1 ⊂Γ2. However, the problem on the exis-
tence and on the form of the extremal metric is still the most diﬃcult one.
General modulus problems were considered in [63], [67]; [78], Chapter 0, and
the existence has been established as well as the form of the extremal metric.
Avoiding supeﬂuous notations we denote by M(D) either the modulus of
a doubly connected domain or else of a quadrilateral according to the type
of D. M(D) = m(D, Γ) where Γ is the family of curves that separate the
boundary components of a doubly connected domain D or a family of curves
that connect the opposite boundary components of a quadrilateral D.
Now we deﬁne rigorously the family Γ. On a Riemann surface S0 we set
a collection of curves γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) of two types I, II. The ﬁrst one (I)
consists of simple loops on S0 that are not freely homotopic pairwise. The
second one (II) exists when l > 0 and consists of simple arcs on S0 ending
on the hyperbolic boundary components of S0. All curves are neither homo-
topically trivial nor intersected. Such a collection γ is called the admissible
system of curves.
A set Γj of curves on S0 is said to be a homotopy class generated by γj
from the admissible system (γ1, . . . , γm) if this set consists of all curves of
type I or II that are freely homotopic to γj on S0.
A collection of the homotopy classes of curves Γ := (Γ1, . . . , Γm) gener-
ated by the admissible system (γ1, . . . , γm) on S0 is said to be the free family
of homotopy classes of curves.
Assume α := (α1, . . . , αm) to be a non-zero vector with non-negative co-
ordinates. Let P be a family of conformal invariant metrics ρ on S0 satisfying
the following admissible condition [63], [146]. For any γ ∈Γj,

γ
ρ(ζ)|dζ| ≥αj.
(2.12)
If P ̸= ∅, then one can say that for the family Γ on S0 and for the vector α
the modulus problem is deﬁned and the modulus in this problem is given by
m(S0, Γ, α) = inf
ρ∈P


ρ2(ζ)dσζ,
(2.13)

48
2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
In (2.12) we equally take the lower Dardoux integral as in (2.10) and (2.1).
This deﬁnition of the modulus satisﬁes all important properties of the deﬁni-
tion (2.10)–(2.11) or (2.1)–(2.2). Moreover, it is known [63], [67], that there
exists a unique extremal metric ρ∗in this modulus problem. It is deﬁned by
the unique holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential with ﬁnite trajectories ϕ(ζ)dζ2
on S0 and ρ∗(ζ) =

|ϕ(ζ)|.
We call a doubly connected domain Dj to be associated with the homotopy
class Γj of the ﬁrst type (I) if any simple loop separating the boundary
components of Dj belongs to Γj. Then we equally call a quadrilateral Dj
with four distinct vertices 1,2,3,4 on the hyperbolic boundary components of
S0 to be associated with the homotopy class Γj of the second type (II) if any
simple arc connecting the boundary components on 1,4 and 2,3 ∈∂S0 of Dj
belongs to Γj.
The critical trajectories of ϕ(ζ)dζ2 split S0 into at most m ring do-
mains and quadrangles D∗= (D∗
1, . . . , D∗
m) associated respectively with
homotopy classes of curves (some of D∗
j can degenerate). Any collection
of non-overlapping admissible doubly connected domains and quadrilater-
als D = (D1, . . . , Dm) of types I,II associated with the homotopy classes of
the free family Γ satisﬁes the following inequality

with the equality only for D = D∗where M(Dj) (according to j) is the mod-
ulus of a doubly connected domain with respect to the family of curves which
separate its boundary components or the modulus of a quadrilateral with re-
spect to the family of curves connecting its opposite boundary components
on ∂S0.
Each D∗
j is either a ring domain or else a quadrangle in the trajectory
structure of ϕ(ζ)dζ2. If D∗
j is a ring domain, then there is a conformal map

j(g′

j onto the rectangle 0 < Re w < 1, 0 < Im w < M(D∗
j ). We
call the system of domains D∗the characteristic system of domains for the
diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2.
Thus, the modulus problem is equivalent to the problem of the extremal
partition of the Riemann surface S0 by the domains of special types associated
with certain free family of homotopy classes of curves.

2.7 Free families of homotopy classes of curves and extremal partitions
49
Many particular cases of this modulus problem, generalization, calcula-
tion of the moduli of certain families of curves, and their applications were
considered in [34], [40], [41], [78], [79], [163]. The results on extremal partition
in the case of other types of associated domains such as strip-like, ending, and
circular domains were obtained by G. Kuz’mina [78], [81] and E. Emel’yanov
[36].
Now we formulate a slightly diﬀerent problem of the extremal partition
of the Riemann surface S0 which is due to K. Strebel ([141], Section 20.5,
Weighted sum of the reciprocals of moduli).
A holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential ϕ with ﬁnite trajectories and of ﬁnite
L1-norm is said to to be of homotopy type (γ1, . . . , γm) for a prescribed
admissible system of curves on S0 if its critical trajectories split S0 into a
system of non-overlapping ring domains and quadrangles (D∗
1, . . . , D∗
m) of
homotopy type (γ1, . . . , γm).
Let a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ with ﬁnite trajectories be of ﬁnite norm
and of homotopy type (γ1, . . . , γm); (D∗
1, . . . , D∗
m) be its characteristic sys-
tem of domains. If D∗
j is not degenerate, then we denote by αj the length
of a trajectory that belongs to the domain D∗
j of the diﬀerential ϕ in the
metric

|ϕ(ζ)||dζ|. Assume bj := αj · M(D∗
j ). Then, ∥ϕ∥= m
j=1 αj · bj.
The minimum property of the diﬀerential ϕ is expressed in the following
propositions.
Proposition 2.7.1 (Strebel [141], page 105). Let Γ := (Γj)m
j=1 be a free
family of homotopy classes of curves generated by an admissible system
(γ1, . . . , γm) on S0. Let ϕ be a holomorphic quadratic diﬀerentials on S0 of ﬁ-
nite L1-norm and with ﬁnite trajectories of given homotopy type (γ1, . . . , γm).

D∗= (D∗

2. MODULI OF FAMILES OF CURVES
Proposition 2.7.3 (Strebel [141], Theorem 21.1). Let γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) be
an admissible system of curves on S0. Suppose there exists a system of doubly
connected domains and quadrilaterals of this homotopy type with bounded
moduli. Then, for any collection of positive numbers (b1, . . . , bm) there exists
a unique holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential ϕ on S0 with ﬁnite trajectories
and a system of doubly connected domains and quadrilaterals (D∗
1, . . . , D∗
m)
of homotopy type (γ1, . . . , γm) such that ϕ is of the same homotopy type and
(D∗
1, . . . , D∗
m) is the characteristic domain system for ϕ. Moreover, ∥ϕ∥=

These propositions give the solution to the problem of the extremal par-
tition of a Riemann surface ﬁxing the weight vector α or the height vector
(b1, . . . , bm). The principal diﬀerence is that: if bk ̸= 0, then the domain D∗
k
never degenerates meanwhile the case αk ̸= 0 does not imply this.
2.7.2 The case of circular, strip domains, and triangles
We consider the modulus problem of Section 2.7.1 as a basic one provided
by J. Jenkins and K. Strebel. One can think of the problem of the extremal
partition of a Riemann surface by the collection of non-overlapping domains
associated with a certain free family of homotopy classes of curves as dual
to the modulus problem. Recently, G. Kuz’mina has added some new types
of homotopy classes and expand both the modulus problem and the problem
about the extremal partition described in Section 2.7.1. It turns out to be
important for the solution of various extremal problems for conformal map.
We need to add new types of curves to the deﬁnition of the admissible
system. A ﬁnite number γ = (γ1, . . . , γm, γm+1, . . . , γs, γs+1, . . . , γk) of simple
loops and simple arcs with endpoints in the hyperbolic boundary components
and punctures of S0 that are not freely homotopic pairwise on S0 is called
the admissible system of curves on S0 if these curves are not homotopic to
a point of S0 and do not intersect. We let a curve γj from the admissible
system be homotopic to a puncture (III type) for j = m + 1, . . . , s. Another
type of curves consists of those γj that are not homotopically trivial, start
and ﬁnish at ﬁxed points (or the same point) which can be either punctures
or else points of hyperbolic components of S0 (IV type) for j = s + 1, . . . , k.
Let an admissible system of curves (γ1, . . . , γk) be given. A doubly con-
nected domain Dj on S0 with one hyperbolic boundary component and a
puncture as the other one is said to have a homotopy type III if any loop on
S0 separating the boundary components of D is freely homotopic to a curve
γj of type III. A digon Dj on S0 with two ﬁxed vertices on its boundary
(maybe the same point) is said to be of homotopy type IV if any arc on S0
connecting two vertices is homotopic (not freely) to a curve γj of type IV. A
triangle Dj on S0 with the ﬁxed vertex at a puncture of S0 is said to be of
homotopy type IV if any arc on S0 connecting the vertex with the opposite

leg on the hyperbolic boundary component of S0 is freely homotopic to a
curve γj of type IV.
A system of non-overlapping doubly connected domains, quadrilaterals,
and simply connected domains (D1, . . . , Dk) on S0 is said to be of homotopic
type (γ1, . . . , γk) if (γ1, . . . , γk) is an admissible system of curves on S0 and
for any j ∈{1, . . . , k} the domain Dj is of homotopic type γj (I–IV). So, here
now we let doubly connected domains be of parabolic type.
We ﬁx a weight-height vector α = (α1, . . . , αs, hs+1, . . . , hk) and require
the digons and triangles to be conformal at their vertices and to satisfy the
condition of compatibility of angles and heights, say ϕaj = πhj/(
k∈Iaj hk),
j = s + 1, . . . , k, ϕbj = πhj/(
k∈Ibj hk), where Iaj (Ibj) is the set of indices
which refer to the digons Dj with the vertices at aj (bj) or to the triangles
Dj with the vertices at aj. With a given admissible system γ and a vector
α we associate the collection D = (D1, . . . , Dk) of domains of the homotopy
type γ, satisfying the condition of compatibility of angles and heights, which
we call associated with γ and α.
With each of the domains of type III we associate the reduced modulus
m(Dk, ak) of the parabolic domain Dk with respect to a puncture ak and
with each domain of IV type we associate the reduced modulus m(D, aj, bj)
of the digon Dj with the vertices at aj, bj or the reduced modulus mΔ(D, aj)
of the triangle Dj with the vertex at aj.
Some of domains (D1, . . . , Dk) (not all of them) can degenerate. In this
case assume the modulus or the reduced one to vanish.

mains, by E. Emel’yanov [36], G. Kuz’mina [81], A. Solynin [139] for the

lection of non-overlapping admissible doubly connected domains, quadrilat-
erals, digons, and triangles D = (D1, . . . , Dk) of types I–IV associated with
the admissible system of curves γ and the vector α satisﬁes the following

and the weight-height vector (some of D∗

The above solves the problem of the extremal partition of S0. Now we
connect this problem for the general case of the admissible system of curves
with the modulus problem or, in other words, we are looking for the inﬁmum
of an integral that presents the reduced area.
We suppose here that there is no curve from the admissible system of type
IV. Let P be the family of conformal invariant metrics ρ on S0 that satisfy
the admissible condition (2.12) for any γ ∈Γj,

If P ̸= ∅, then one can say that for the family Γ on S0 and for the vector α

to exist and to be ﬁnite. Then, the modulus is equal to the inﬁmum of this
limit as ρ ranges over P. For this modulus problem the extremal metric is
deﬁned by the unique diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 that has at most double poles at
the punctures am+1, . . . as on the closure of the surface S0 and at most simple
poles in other punctures. This diﬀerential is the same as in the problem of
the extremal partition.
The the case IV of admissible domains (strip domains and triangles) in the
trajectory structure of the extremal diﬀerential is considered for the modulus
problem in [81] and [139] . It makes use of more complicated deﬁnitions. In
applications the results about the extremal partition are more useful so we
abandon awkward cases of the modulus problems.

2.7.3 Continuous and diﬀerentiable moduli
A study of the dependence of conformal invariants on the determining pa-
rameters started in 1966 by P. Tamrazov [145] and continued by A. Solynin
[132], E. Emel’yanov [35], [37], and by the author [152], [155],[157], [170],
namely, we speak about the continuous, diﬀerentiable, and harmonic prop-
erties respectively. The harmonic properties we will consider in Chapter 5;
the continuous and diﬀerentiable properties we formulate in connection with
the deﬁnitions of the above sections. For more general formulations see [35],
[132], [139].
Here in this subsection we assume S0 = C \ {ζ0
1, . . . , ζ0
n, ζn+1, ζn+2, ζn+3},
where all punctures are diﬀerent. Since the modulus is a conformal invariant
we can assume ζn+1 = 0, ζn+2 = 1, ζn+3 = ∞. Further we will consider more
general surfaces and will discuss this problems from the point of view of the
Teichm¨uller theory.
We use the notation S = C⧹{ζ1, . . . , ζn, 0, 1}. Let α0 := (α0
1, . . . , α0
m) be
a ﬁxed weight vector in Section 2.7.2, G(ζ0
j ) be a simply connected domain
that contains the point ζ0

Theorem 2.7.1 (Solynin [132]). Let ¯x ∈G and Γ 0 be a free family of ho-
motopy classes of curves on S0 of types I-III. Then, m(¯x) := m(S, Γ, α) is
a continuous function with respect to ¯x. Here Γ is a continuous deformation
of Γ 0 and S is a continuous deformation of S0. Denote by ϕ(ζ, ¯x)dζ2 the ex-
tremal diﬀerential for the modulus m(S, Γ, α). Then, ϕ(ζ, ¯x) tends to ϕ(ζ, ¯x0)
locally uniformly in C.
Here and further on for convenience we will denote the local parameters
on S and S0 by the same character.
Theorem 2.7.2 (Solynin [132], Emel’yanov [35]). Let ¯x ∈G be a vector with
coordinates (ζ1, . . . , ζn, α1, . . . , αm) and m(¯x) be deﬁned as in Theorem 2.7.1.
Then, for a ﬁxed (α1, . . . , αm) the function m(¯x) is diﬀerentiable with respect
to (ζ1, . . . , ζn) in some neighbourhood of ¯x0 in G. For a ﬁxed (ζ1, . . . , ζn) the
function m(¯x) is diﬀerentiable with respect to (α1, . . . , αm) in some neigh-
bourhood of ¯x0 in G. Moreover, the following equalities are valid

The formulae of diﬀerentiation remain similar for the case of strip domains
in the trajectory structure of the extremal diﬀerential.
Here M(D∗
j ) is the modulus of a ring domain, or a quadrangle D∗
j in the
trajectory structure of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, ¯x0)dζ2. In particular, an important
corollary follows from Theorem 2.7.2. Namely, the gradient of m(¯x) by ζj at
the point ζ0
j has the same tangent direction with the critical trajectory of the
diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, ¯x0)dζ2 starting from ζ0
j .
This remark is very convenient for the monotonic change of the modulus
when we move the point ζj along a prescribed curve. This is a useful addition
to the method of symmetrization.
Example 2.7.1. Consider the free family of curves Γ consisting of the unique
homotopy class of simple loops that separate the points {0, 1} and {ζ, ∞}
on the surface S0 = C⧹{0, 1, ζ}, |ζ| > 1. All curves from Γ are homotopic
on S0 to the slit [0, 1]. As a result of circular symmetrization with respect
to the center 0 and the direction R+ we obtain that the modulus m(S, Γ)
attains its maximum on the circle {z : |z| = |ζ|} at the point ζ = −|ζ|. We
can learn more detail information from Theorem 2.7.2 and from the remark
thereafter. Namely, this modulus increases monotonically on a in the circle
{z : z = |ζ|eia}, a ∈(0, π) and decreases monotonically in a ∈(π, 2π). This
comes from the fact that the critical trajectory of the extremal diﬀerential
starting from ζ has the direction into the half-plane Im zei arg ζ > 0. So the
vector of the motion has an acute angle with the gradient of the modulus.

3. Moduli in Extremal Problems for
Conformal Mapping
Denote by S the class of all holomorphic univalent functions f(z) = z +
a2z2 + . . . in the unit disk U, and by SR its subclass of functions with real
coeﬃcients an. In this chapter we start with classical theorems on conformal
map like the Koebe 1/4 theorem, growth, and distortion theorems. Then we
prove two-point distortion theorems, i.e., we will ﬁnd the range of the system
of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) in the classes S, SR of univalent functions.
We continue, furthermore, with extremal problems for other classes of uni-
valent functions such as bounded functions, Montel functions, functions with
prescribed angular derivatives.
3.1 Classical extremal problems for univalent functions
Here we do not present deeply the history of results and theorems because all
of them are well-known nowadays. One can ﬁnd details in numerous surveys
and monographs, e.g., [4], [31], [48], [64], [100], [110]. We start with the famous
Koebe 1/4 theorem. The Koebe function which is extremal in many important
problems is kθ(z) = z(1 + zeiθ)−2. The transformation f(z) →eiθf(e−iθz) is
called the rotation of the function f.
3.1.1 Koebe set, growth, distortion
Theorem 3.1.1 (Koebe Theorem). The boundary of the Koebe set
KS =

f(U)
in the class S is the circle |w| = 1/4. If
inf
w∈∂f(U) |w| = 1/4
for some f, then it is the Koebe function or its rotation.
Proof. Suppose, contrary to our claim, that there exists such w0 with |w0| ≤
1/4, that does not belong to f(U) where f is not the Koebe function. Then,

there is a curve γ ̸∈f(U) that connects w0 and ∞. So, the reduced modulus
is given by 0 = m(U, 0) = m(f(U), 0) ≤m(C \ γ, 0). Let D∗be the result of
circular symmetrization of the domain C\γ with respect to the origin and to
the direction deﬁned by the positive real axis. Then, m(C \ γ, 0) ≤m(D∗, 0).
Moreover, D∗⊂k0(D) = C \ [1/4, ∞). Then, m(D∗, 0) ≤0. Therefore, we
have the equality sign in all previous inequalities what is possible only if
eiαf(U) = D∗= k0(D) for some α or f ≡kθ for some θ. This contradicts
our assumption and ﬁnishes the proof.

r := |z|
(3.1)
with the equality sign only for the Koebe function or its rotation.
Proof. Starting with the lower estimation we consider the domain Uz = U \
[z, ei arg z) with the reduced modulus
m(Uz, 0) = 1
2π log
4r
(1 + r)2 ,
(see Section 2.4). Suppose the contrary. Let f be a function from the class
S with |f(z)| < r(1 + r)−2. Then, denote by D∗the result of circular sym-
metrization of the domain f(Uz) with respect to the origin and to the direc-
tion deﬁned by the positive real axis. Then, m(f(Uz), 0) ≤m(D∗, 0). More-
over, D∗⊂k0(e−i arg zUz) = {C \ [r(1 + r)−2, ∞)}. Thus,
m(D∗, 0) ≤1
2π log
4r
(1 + r)2 .
The contradiction obtained implies the lower estimate. The uniqueness of the
extremal conﬁguration under symmetrization leads to the uniqueness of the
extremal function up to rotation. Therefore, we have the equality sign in all
previous inequalities only if eiαf(Uz) = D∗= C \ [r(1 + r)−2, ∞) for some α
or f ≡kθ.
For the upper estimate we consider the digon U ′
z = U \ (−ei arg z, z] with
two vertices with the same support 0 with the equal angles π at them. This
digon is conformal at the vertices and
m(U ′
z, 0, 0) = 2
π log
4r
(1 −r)2
(see Section 2.4).
Again, we suppose the contrary. Let f be a function from the class S with
|f(z)| > r(1 −r)−2. Apart from the previous consideration we need here the
more powerful tool of Section 2.7.2 that consists of the extremal partition
of the Riemann surface S0 = C \ {0, f(z)}. The digon f(U ′
z) is conformal

3.1 Classical extremal problems for univalent functions

and admissible in the problem of minimizing the reduced modulus in the
family of all digons on S0 with the angles π at 0, conformal at 0, having the
homotopy type deﬁned by a curve γ that connects on S0 the origin with itself
and homotopic on S0 to the slit [0, f(z)]. The extremal digon is C slit along
the ray [f(z), ∞] passing through the origin.
So, we have the inequality
2
π log 4|f(z)| ≤2
π log
4r
(1 −r)2
(we use the fact that f ′(0) = 1). This is equivalent to the upper estimate
in the theorem. The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration leads to the
uniqueness of the extremal map up to rotation.

(3.3)
with the equality sign only for the Koebe function or its rotation.
Proof. We start with the upper estimate in (3.2). Consider the domain1 Uz =
U \ (−1, 0] with the reduced modulus
m(Uz, z) = 1
2π log 4r(1 −r)
(1 + r) .
The domain f(Uz) has the reduced modulus m(Uz, 0)+ 1
2π log |f ′(z)|. Here we
can apply either symmetrization or the results about the extremal partition.
The extremal conﬁguration for the maximal reduced modulus in both cases
is the domain D = C \ {w = t exp(i arg f(z)) : t ∈(−∞, 0]} and with
the puncture at the point f(z). It has the reduced modulus m(D, f(z)) =
1
2π log 4|f(z)|. This leads to the right-hand side inequality in (3.2).
For
the

estimate
in
(3.2)
we
consider
the
digon
U ′

formal at z, have the angles π there and
m(U ′

(see Section 2.4).
The digon f(U ′
z) with the vertices over f(z) is also conformal and has the
reduced modulus

This digon is admissible in the problem of minimizing the reduced modulus

there and the same homotopy type deﬁned by a curve γ that connects on
S0 the point f(z) with itself and homotopic on S to the slit [0, f(z)]. The
extremal digon D is C slit along the ray [0, ∞] that passes through the point
f(z). Its reduced modulus is 2
π log 4|f(z)|. This leads to the lower estimate in
(3.2). The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration leads to the uniqueness
of the extremal map up to some rotation.
The result of the Growth Theorem with the possibility of the equality for
the Koebe function leads to the estimate (3.3).

An explicit information about the location of the point (x, y) is given by
theorems about the range of the system of functionals I(f) = (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|).
A great contribution to solution of this problem was made by J. Jenkins [65],
I. Alexandrov, S. Kopanev [5], V. Popov [114], V. Gutlyanski˘ı [56].
Due to rotation it suﬃces to consider the point z = r ∈(0, 1). The range of
a continuous system of functionals in a connected compact class of functions
(S in our case) is connected and closed (see, e.g., [58]). Since the range of the
functional |f ′(r)| for f ∈S with |f(r)| ﬁxed is also connected and closed, the
range Mf of I(f) is simply connected and ∂Mf is an arc consisting of two
parts: Γ +, the arc of y = max |f ′(r)| as f ∈S with |f(r)| = x ﬁxed, and Γ −,
the arc of y = min |f ′(r)| as f ∈S with |f(r)| = x ﬁxed. We determine here
Mf by the modulus method.

for u ∈[−2, 2], we choose for |f(r)| = x the unique u = uf = r + 1/r −1/x

Consider the digon U ′

is given by the digon obtained from C slitting along two rays starting from 0

these two points. Therefore, |f ′(r)| ≥1−r2

The moduli that we are going to calculate will be used in various extremal
problems. Let S0 = C \ {0, 1} be the punctured Riemann sphere. On S0 we
consider the admissible system (γ1, γ2) of curves of type III where γ1 = {w :
|w| = 1/ε} and γ2 = {w : |w| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small such that
1 belongs to the doubly connected domain between γ1 and γ2 on C. Let D
be a set of all pairs (D1, D2) of simply connected domains of homotopy type
(γ1, γ2). Then, the problem of extremal partition of S0 consists of maximizing
the sum α2
1m(D1, ∞) + α2
2m(D2, 0) over all (D1, D2) ∈D. Without loss of
generality we assume α1 = 1, α2 = α and the maximum of this sum we
denote by M(α). From Section 2.7.2 it follows that there exists a unique
pair (D∗
1, D∗
2) which is extremal in this problem. D∗
1 and D∗
2 are the circular
domains in the trajectory structure of the diﬀerential

Here A and c are functions with respect to α. If α = 1, then the lengths of
trajectories of the diﬀerential ϕ from D∗
1 and D∗
2 are equal and c(1) = 1. In
this case M(1) = 0 and D∗
1 = {z : |z| > 1}, D∗
2 = U. If α = 0 or α →∞, then
the domains D∗
2 and D∗
1 are respectively degenerate and M(0) = M(∞) =
(1/2π) log 4. In other cases we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.1.5. Let 0 < α < ∞, α ̸= 1. Then
m(D∗

Proof. We consider the map u = u(z) whose inverse is
z = (c −1)
1 −cos u
(1 −c) −(1 + c) cos u + 1,
(3.6)
and obtain the representation of the diﬀerential ϕ in terms of the parameter
u in regular points
ϕ(z)dz2 = Q(u)du2 = −A(c−1)2c
(1 + cos u)2
((1 −c) −(1 + c) cos u)2 cos2 udu2. (3.7)
Now we study the trajectory structure of this quadratic diﬀerential which
is a complete square of a linear one. The diﬀerential Q(u)du2 has the zeros
of order 4 at the points π +2πk that are the images of c under the map u(z).

Further, u(0) = π/2+kπ and u(∞) = θk = arccos(1−c)/(1+c) are the poles
of the second order. The points u(1) = 2πk are regular for this diﬀerential.
Let us consider a ﬁxed branch of the function u(z) that maps C \ [c, 1]
onto the strip 0 < Re u < π. For 0 < α < 1 the circular domain Du
2 = u(D∗
2)
is bounded by the critical trajectory of Q(u)du2 starting and ending at π
enclosing the point π/2, θ1 ∈(0, π/2). The circular domain Du
2 = u(D∗
2)
is bounded by the same trajectory and the straight lines Re u = 0, π. For
α > 1 the boundary of the domain Du
1 is the critical trajectory of Q(u)du2
starting and ending at π enclosing the point θ1, θ1 ∈(π/2, π). The circular
domain Du
2 = u(D∗
2) is bounded by the same trajectory and the straight lines
Re u = 0, π.
Let ζj(u), j = 0, 1 be conformal maps of the domains Du
j onto the unit
disk U such that ζ1(π/2) = ζ2(θ1) = 0 in the case of α < 1 or ζ2(π/2) =
ζ1(θ1) = 0 in the case of α > 1. Each function ζj satisﬁes in the domain Du

Letting z →∞in (3.9) in the case of j = 1, or z →0 in the case of j = 2 we
obtain A = 1/4π2 and c = α2.
To calculate the reduced moduli we ﬁrst consider the case α < 1. The
part [π/2 + δ, π] of the orthogonal trajectory of the diﬀerential Q(u)du2 for

we derive that
δ = 1 −c
2c ε1 + O(ε2
1).
(3.10)
For these two segments there is an image in ζ-plane [εeiβ, eiβ]. Without loss
of generality, we assume β = 0.
Let z = f2(ζ) = A1ζ + A2ζ2 + . . . be a mapping of U onto D∗
2. Then, the
conformal radius of D∗
2 can be calculated as R(D∗
2, 0) = 1/|A1|. We deduce
directly from (3.7) that

where we choose the sign (+) after the logarithm if
(tan(u/2) −tan(θ1/2))/(tan(u/2) + tan(θ1/2)) > 0,

the root in the left-hand side of (3.11) choosing (-) after the equality sign.

This is equivalent to (3.5) in the statement of the theorem for α < 1.
Now we pass to the case α > 1. For the segment [0, π/2−δ] in the u-plane
there is a preimage [ε1, 1] in the z-plane, and consequently, a preimage [ε, 1]
in the ζ-plane. Integrating (3.8) along these segments, we obtain

This is equivalent to (3.5) in the statement of the theorem for α > 1.
Now we prove (3.4). If α < 1, then the segment [0, θ1 −δ] in the domain
Du
1 has the preimage [0, 1/ε1] in the z-plane, and consequently, the preimage

[ε, 1] in the ζ-plane. Let z = f1(ζ) = B−1/ζ + B0 + B1ζ + . . . be a map of U
onto D∗

δ = √c1 −c
1 + cε1 + O(ε2
1).
(3.12)
Fixing the branch of the root in (3.12) with (+) after the equality sign, and
integrating (3.8) along the segments chosen, we have
ε =

This is equivalent to (3.4) in the statement of the theorem for α < 1.
For α > 1 the segment [θ+δ, π] in the u-plane has the preimage [1/ε1, c] in
the z-plane, and consequently, the preimage [ε, 1] in the ζ-plane. Integrating
(3.8) along these segments we obtain

This is equivalent to (3.4) in the statement of the theorem for α > 1 and

Now we consider another modulus problem which is connected with the
preceding one. Let S0 = C \ {0, c, 1} be a punctured Riemann sphere, c ∈
(0, 1). On S0 we consider the admissible system (γ1, γ2) of curves of type III
where γ1 = {w : |w| = 1/ε} and γ2 = {w : |w| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently
small such that c, 1 belongs to the doubly connected domain between γ1 and
γ2 on C. Let B be a set of all pairs (B1, B2) of simply connected domains of
homotopy type (γ1, γ2). Then, the problem of the extremal partition of S0
consists of maximizing the sum α2
1m(B1, ∞)+α2
2m(B2, 0) over (B1, B2) ∈B.
Denote by (B∗
1, B∗
2) ∈B a unique extremal pair of domains in this problem.
Without loss of generality, we assume α1 = 1, α2 = α and the maximum of
this sum we denote by M(c, α). For α ≤√c this problem is equivalent to the
previous one and M(c, α) = M(α), α < 1. For α ≥1/√c this problem is also
equivalent to the previous one with α > 1 and M(c, α) = M(α)/√c.

Proof. The extremal pair (B∗
1, B∗
2) consists of the circular domains B∗
1 and
B∗
2 in the trajectory structure of the diﬀerential
Φ(z)dz2 = −A
(z −b)2dz2
z2(z −1)(z −c).
By the analogy with the proof of Theorem 3.1.5 we deduce that A = 1/4π2
and b = α√c. We use the map of the form (3.6) and obtain the diﬀerential
Φ in terms of the parameter u
Φ(z)dz2 = Q1(u)du2 = −A (bc −b + (b + bc −2c) cos u)2
c((1 −c) −(1 + c) cos u)2cos2udu2.
(3.15)
Unlike the diﬀerential Q(u)du2, the diﬀerential Q1(u)du2 has the zeros of the
second order at the points

Let ζj(u), j = 0, 1 be conformal maps of the domains Bu

3.1.4 Upper boundary curve for the range of (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|)
Now we use the moduli calculated in the preceding section to derive the
upper boundary curve Γ + for the range of I(f) = (|f ′(z)|, |f(z)|) in the class
S. Our proof is based on simultaneous consideration of two problems of the

3.1 Classical extremal problems for univalent functions
67
extremal partition of the punctured unit disk and of the punctured Riemann
sphere.
Let Uz = U \ {0, r} be a punctured unit disk. We consider on Uz the
admissible system of curves (γz
1, γz
2) of type III where γz
2 = {z : |z −r| = ε}
and γz
1 = {z : |z| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small such that r + ε < 1 and
ε < r/2. Let Dz be a set of all pairs (Dz
1, Dz
2) of simply connected domains
of homotopy type (γz
1, γz
2). Then, the problem of the extremal partition of Uz
consists of maximizing the sum m(Dz
1, 0) + α2m(Dz
2, r) over all (Dz
1, Dz
2) ∈
Dz. The maximum of this sum we denote by Mz(α, r). Under the map
Z(z) = 1 −r(1 + z)2
z(1 + r)2
two extremal domains (Dz
1
∗, Dz
2
∗) in the problem for Mz(α, r) are trans-
formed into two extremal domains (B1
∗, B2
∗) in the problem for M(c, α)
with c = (1 −r)2/(1 + r)2. Taking into account the change of the reduced
moduli under the conformal map Z(z) we deduce that for (1 −r)/(1 + r) ≤
α ≤(1 + r)/(1 −r) the relations
m(Dz
1
∗, 0) = 1
2π log rα,
m(Dz
2
∗, r) = 1
2π log r1/α(1 −r2)
hold.
Let Cw = C\{0, w0} be a punctured Riemann sphere. We consider on Cw
the admissible system of curves (γw
1 , γw
2 ) of type III where γw
1 = {w : |w| = ε}
and γz
2 = {z : |w −w0| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small such that ε < w0/2.
Let Dw be the set of all pairs (Dw
1 , Dw
2 ) of simply connected domains of
homotopy type (γw
1 , γw
2 ). Then, the problem of the extremal partition of Cw
consists of maximizing the sum m(Dw
1 , 0)+α2m(Dw
2 , w0) over all (Dw
1 , Dw
2 ) ∈
Dw. The maximum of this sum we denote by Mw(α). Under the map
W(w) = w0 −w
w0w
two extremal domains (Dw
1
∗, Dw
2
∗) in the problem for Mw(α) are transformed
into two extremal domains (D1
∗, D2
∗) in the problem for M(α). Taking into
account the change of the reduced moduli under the conformal map W(w)
we deduce that for α ̸= 1
m(Dw

m(Dw

For α = 1 we have

∗, 0) = 1
2π log w0.

3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
We precede the next theorem by the following technical lemma omitting
its simple proof.
Lemma 3.1.1. For (1 −r)/(1 + r) ≤α ≤(1 + r)/(1 −r) the equation
m(Dw
1
∗, 0) = m(Dz
1
∗, 0)
deﬁnes the function w0(α) which strictly increases with increasing α from
w0 = r(1 + r)−2 to w0 = r(1 −r)−2.
Theorem 3.1.7. (i) The upper boundary curve Γ + of the range Mf of the
system of functionals I(f) = (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|) in the class S consists of the
points (x(α), y(α)) for
α ∈

If α = 1, then x(1) = r, y(1) = 1/(1 −r2).
(ii) Each point (x(α), y(α)) of Γ + is given by the unique function F(z, α)
that satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
ϕ(z)dz2 = ψ(w)dw2, α ̸= 1,
ϕ(z)dz2 =
(z −d)2(z −¯d)2
z2(z −r)2(z −1/r)2 dz2,
ψ(z)dz2 =
w −C
w2(w −x(α))2 dw2,
where |d| = 1 and d is one of two conjugated solutions of the equation
α1 −r
1 + r = 1 −r(1 + d)2
d(1 + r)2 ,
C = C(α) =
x(α)
1 −α2 .
The function F(z, α) maps the unit disk onto the complex plane C minus the
ray [C(α), +∞) in the case α < 1 or (−∞, C(α)] in the case α > 1, and two
smooth arcs of the trajectories of the diﬀerential ψ(w) dw2 emanating from
C(α) symmetrically with respect to R so that the simply connected domain
F(U, α) is of zero reduced modulus with respect to the origin.
If α = 1, then

ϕ(z)dz2 =

and the function F(z, 1) maps the unit disk onto the complex plane C minus
two symmetric rays with respect to R along the straight line Re w = r/2 with
the analogous normalization.
Proof. Let f ∈S with a ﬁxed value of |f(r)| = x. The previous lemma states
that there exists such α, that w0(α) = x. We consider the functions f1(z)
and f2(z) satisfying the equations

= 4π2ψ(w)dw2,
where the diﬀerentials ϕ(z)dz2 and ψ(w)dw2 are deﬁned in the statement of
the theorem and α is chosen. The superposition f −1
2
◦f1(z) maps conformally
the domain Dz
1
∗onto the domain Dw
1
∗. Continuing this map analytically
into Dz
2
∗we obtain the function F(z, α) that maps the unit disk onto the
domain which is admissible with respect to the diﬀerential ψ(w)dw2. After
the normalization F ′(0, α) = 1 the function F(z, α) satisﬁes all conditions
of the theorem. Since the pair (Dw
1
∗, Dw
2
∗) is extremal in the family Dw, we
have the following chain of inequalities
m(f(Dz

Then, |f ′(r)| ≤|F ′(r, α)| = y(α). The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁgu-
ration implies the uniqueness of the extremal function. Rotation ﬁnishes the
proof.

The boundary curves Γ + and Γ −have been obtained by J. Jenkins [65]
applying his General Coeﬃcient Theorem and by I. Alexandrov, S. Kopanev
[5] using the parametric method without assertion on the uniqueness of the
extremal functions. Later on, V. Gorya˘ınov [50] proved the uniqueness of the
extremal functions developing the L¨owner-Kufarev method.

3.2 Two-point distortion for univalent functions
In this paragraph we study the sets of values of the system of functionals
I(f) = (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|), 0 < r1 < r2 < 1 in the classes SR and S. Descriptions
of various systems of functionals dependent on the values of a function from
the class S deﬁned at two diﬀerent non-zero points from U have been studied
by several analysts. J. Jenkins [61], [64] has proved that the maximum of
|f(r2)| in the class S for a given value of |f(−r1)| is provided by a function
f ∈SR. He found this upper boundary curve for the system of functionals
(|f(−r1)|, |f(r2)|) in the class SR. As a corollary, he derived the upper bound
of the sum |f(−r1eiθ)| + |f(r2eiθ)|, f ∈S. Without the assertion on the
uniqueness of the extremal functions the same result had been obtained earlier
by G. Goluzin [47], [48]. We note that from Jenkins’ result and method it is
impossible to deduce the range of I(f) in our problem. J. Krzy˙z [76] found
the range of values of the complex valued functional f(z1)/f(z2), f ∈S,
z1, z2 ∈U by the variational method.
3.2.1 Lower boundary curve for the range of (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) in
SR
The range Nf of I(f) is a simply connected closed set for f ∈S, and ∂Nf
is an arc consisting of two parts Γ + which is the arc of y = max |f(r2)| over
f ∈S with |f(r1)| = x ﬁxed, and Γ −which is the arc of y = min |f(r2)| over
f ∈S with |f(r1)| = x ﬁxed. Denote the range of I(f) in the class SR by NR
f
and its boundary curves by Γ +
R and Γ −
R respectively.

for u ∈[−2, 2]. We choose a unique u = uf = r1 + 1/r1 −1/x for a ﬁxed
|f(r1)| = x such that g(r1) = |f(r1)|.
Let us consider the digon U ′
z = U \ {(−1, r1] ∪[r2, 1)} with two vertices
over 0 which is conformal at them having the equal angles π. The reduced
modulus is given as
m(U ′
z, 0, 0) = 2
π log
4r1r2
(r2 −r1)(1 −r1r2).
The digon f(U ′
z) with the vertices over 0 is also conformal at them and has
the same reduced modulus. It is admissible in the problem of minimizing
the reduced modulus over all digons conformal at 0, of the homotopy type
deﬁned by the curve γ, having the angles π. The curve γ has two endpoints at
0 and encloses the point f(r1) having the point f(r2) in its exterior part. The
extremal reduced modulus is given by the digon obtained from C by deleting
two rays (−∞, f(r1)] and [f(r2), ∞). Since the reduced modulus decreases
as the domain extends, the inequality f(r2) ≥g(r2) holds with the chosen
value of u. The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration g(U ′) leads to the
uniqueness of the extremal map.

3.2.2 Special moduli
Let A, B, C be diﬀerent punctures of C. Let (γ1, γ(k)
2

∞
k=1) be a countable set
of admissible systems of curves on S0 = C\{A, B, C}. Set γ1 = {z : |z| = 1/ε}
for a suﬃciently small ε such that γ1 is of type III and separates the puncture
∞from all others, γ(k)
2
is from the countable set of possible non-homotopic
on S0 closed curves of type I that separate the punctures A and B from
the punctures C, ∞. We assume that the curve γ(1)
2
is homotopic to the slit
along [A, B] if C ̸∈[A, B], or else to the broken line connecting the points
A, C + εei(π/2+arg (C−A)), B, otherwise. Let D(k) be the family of all pairs
(D1, D(k)
2 ) of non-overlapping domains of homotopy type (γ1, γ(k)
2 ), D1 is a
hyperbolic simply connected domain, ∞∈D1, D(k)
2
is a hyperbolic doubly
connected domain. Degeneracy of the domain D(k)
2
is possible in the sense
that its boundary components coincide. As before, we denote by m(D1, ∞)
the reduced modulus of D1 with respect to ∞and by M(D(k)
2 ) the modulus
of the domain D(k)
2
with respect to the family of closed curves that separate
its boundary components. If the domain D(k)
2
degenerates, then M(D(k)
2 )
vanishes. Consider the problem of maximizing the sum
m(D1, ∞) + α2M(D(k)
2 ),
(3.18)
for a non-negative α over all (D1, D(k)
2 ) ∈D(k). Denote by M (k)(α, A, B, C)
the maximum of the sum (3.18). For α = 0 the problem of ﬁnding

3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
M (k)(0, A, B, C) is the same as the problem of determination of the con-
tinuum of minimal capacity that contains the points A, B, C. This prob-
lem has been solved by G. Kuz’mina ([79], Theorem 1.6). For α →∞the
problem is the same as ﬁnding the maximum of the modulus of doubly con-
nected domain over all such domains on S0 of homotopy type γ(k)
2 . The
value of M (k)(α, A, B, C) attains its maximum for the unique pair of do-
mains (D∗
1, D(k)
2
∗) ∈D(k) which are the circular and the ring domain in the
trajectory structure of the quadratic diﬀerential
ϕ(z) dz2 = A
z −G
(z −A)(z −B)(z −C)dz2.
(3.19)
The domain D(k)
2
∗is degenerate otherwise.
Let ζ1(z) be a univalent conformal map of the domain D∗
1 onto the disk
|ζ1| < R(D∗
1, ∞), such that ζ1(∞) = 0, z·ζ1(z)

z→∞= 1; ζ2(z) be a univalent
conformal map of the domain D(k)
2
∗onto the annulus 1 < |ζ2| < M, such that
ζ2(B) = 1. These functions satisfy in the domains D∗
1, D(k)

= −4π2ϕ(z)dz2, α1 = 1, α2 = α
(3.20)
respectively.
The ϕ-lengths of the trajectories in the non-degenerate domains D∗
1 and
D(k)
2
∗are equal to 1 and α respectively. These conditions deﬁne a simple
zero G. Taking the limit z →∞in the ﬁrst equation in (3.20), we obtain
A = −1/4π2.
Lemma 3.2.1. In the family D(k) the inequality
M (k)(α, A, B, C) < M (1)(α, A, B, C)
holds for all α and k = 2, 3, . . . .
Proof. Without loss of generality, in the proof of this lemma we assume
Im A = Im B = 0, Im C ≥0. We apply polarization with respect to
the real axis to the extremal circular domain D∗
1 and the ring domain
D(k)
2
∗for k ≥2. As a result, we obtain a pair of non-overlapping domains
D0
1, D0
2 which are admissible with respect to the problem associated with
M (1)(α, A, B, C). Moreover, m(D∗
1, ∞) ≤m(D0
1, ∞) whenever D1 ̸= D0
1, and
M(D(k)
2
∗) < M(D0
2, ∞) whenever D2 ̸= D0
2. Thus, the statement of Lemma
3.2.1 follows from the extremality of the pair of the domains D∗

M (1)(α, A, B, C).

3.2 Two-point distortion for univalent functions
73
Lemma 3.2.2. Let 0 < A < B, 0 ≤θ ≤π. The value of M (1)(α, A, Beiθ, 0)
strictly decreases with increasing θ ∈[0, π].
Proof. Let 0 < α < 1. The trajectories of the diﬀerential ϕ(z)dz2 are piece-
wise analytic. By the deﬁnition of polarization with respect to the real
axis, we have two domains D0
1, D0
2 as in the proof of Lemma 3.2.1 for
k = 1 which are admissible for M (1)(α, A, Beiθ, 0). But, on the other hand,
m(D∗
1, ∞) ≤m(D0
1, ∞) and M(D(1)
2
∗) ≤M(D0
2, ∞). So, this is possible only
when the polarized domains coincide with the initial ones. In this case, the
trajectory of the diﬀerential ϕ(z)dz2 connecting G and 0, θ ∈(0, π) lies in the
upper half-plane. The analogous application of polarization with respect to
the lines (A, Beiθ) and (0, Beiθ) yields that the zero G lies within the triangle
with the vertices at 0, A, Beiθ.
The same application of polarization in the case α > 1 implies that the
zero G lies in the part of the angle between the lines (0, Beiθ) and (0, A) in
the lower half-plane.
In both cases the trajectory connecting the points A, Beiθ lies within the
part of the angle between the lines (0, Beiθ) and (0, A) in the upper half-
plane. It follows from Theorem 2.7.2 that the gradient ∇M (1)(α, A, Beiθ, 0),
taken with respect to the third variable at the point Beiθ, is co-directed with
the trajectory of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 starting at this point. Thus, the
scalar product of this vector and the vector of the motion of the point Beiθ
is negative. This ﬁnishes the proof.

Remark 3.2.2. Let a be a ﬁxed number 1 < a < ∞, a function α = α(a, c) be

of Theorem 3.2.2 and continuous in c ∈(1, ∞). Moreover, α(a, c) →μ1(a) as
c →1. The function α(a, c), as a function with respect to c, strictly increases
in c ∈(1, ∞).
Assume that −1, 1, c1, a1 are diﬀerent punctures of C, 1 < c1 < a1 < ∞.
Let (γ′

γ′
1 = {z : |z| = 1/ε} for a suﬃciently small ε such that γ′
1 is of type III
and separates the puncture ∞from all others; γ′
2 is a closed curve of type I
and separates the punctures −1, 1 from the punctures c1, a1, ∞. Assume that
the curve γ′
2 is homotopic to the slit along [−1, 1]. Let B be a family of all
pairs (B1, B2) of non-overlapping domains of homotopic type (γ′
1, γ′
2). B1 is
a hyperbolic simply connected domain, ∞∈B1, B2 is a hyperbolic doubly
connected domain. The domain B2 can be possibly degenerate in such sense
that its boundary components coincide. As before, we denote by m(B1, ∞)
the reduced modulus of B1 with respect to ∞and by M(B2) the modulus of
the domain B2 with respect to the family of simple loops that separate its
boundary components. If the domain B2 degenerates, then M(B2) vanishes.
Consider the problem of maximizing the sum
m(B1, ∞) + α2M(B2),

for a non-negative α over all (B1, B2) ∈B. Denote by M(α, −1, 1, c1, a1) the

tremal partition of the punctured unit disk and of the punctured Riemann
sphere.
Let Uz = U \ {0, r1, r2} be the punctured unit disk. We consider on Uz
the admissible system (γz
1, γz
2) of types III and I respectively where γz
2 is a
simple loop that separates the points r1, r2 from 0 and ∂U, γz
1 = {z : |z| = ε}.
Here ε is suﬃciently small so that at most ε < r1. Let Dz be the set of all
pairs (Dz
1, Dz
2) of a simply connected domain Dz
1 and a doubly connected
domain Dz
2 of homotopy type (γz
1, γz
2). Then, the problem of the extremal
partition of Uz consists of maximizing the sum m(Dz
1, 0) + α2M(Dz
2) over
(Dz
1, Dz
2) ∈Dz. The maximum of this sum we denote by Mz(α, r1, r2). Under
the transformation

, a1 = (r2 + r1)(1 + r1r2) + 4r1r2

Taking into account the change of the reduced modulus under the conformal

set of possible non-homotopic on Cw simple loops of type I that separate
the punctures w1 and w2 from the punctures 0, ∞. Assume that the curve

Lemma 3.2.3. For ﬁxed numbers a1, c1 such that 1 < a1 < c1 and for
a1 ≤a ≤c1 the equation
M(D∗
2) = M(B∗
2)
deﬁnes a function α∗(a) which is diﬀerentiable and strictly increases in a ∈
[a1, c1] from μ2(a1, c1) to μ2(c1, a1). Here D∗
2 and B∗
2 are the extremal ring
domains for M(α, −1, 1, a) and M(α, −1, 1, a1, c1) respectively.
Proof. For
convenience,
we
rewrite
M2(α, −1, 1, a)
≡
M(D∗
2)
and
M2(α, −1, 1, a1, c1) ≡M(B∗
2). For a ﬁxed α we set the equation
αM2(α, −1, 1, a) = αM2(α, −1, 1, a1, c1)
(3.22)
for all possible a. For α = μ2(a1, c1) the problem on M(α, −1, 1, a1, c1) is
reducible to the problem on M(α, −1, 1, a), therefore, the equation (3.22)
has the solution a = a1.
Theorem 3.2.3 and the remarks to Theorem 3.2.2 imply that

4K ′(k),

∂
∂α(αM2(α, −1, 1, a1, c1)) = ∂
∂α(αM2(α, −1, 1, a)).
(3.23)
holds for α = μ2(a1, c1). Explicit calculation yields

2pk2(p(a2 −1) + ac −1)2K ′(k).
Hence, ∂k
∂α > 0 as α < 1, and ∂k
∂α < 0 as α > 1. From (3.23) we derive that
the inequality
∂
∂α(αM2(α, −1, 1, a1, c1)) < ∂
∂α(αM2(α, −1, 1, a)),
(3.24)
holds for α ∈(μ2(a1, c1), 1]. Taking into account (3.24) and the equality
M2(μ2(a1, c1), −1, 1, a1) = M2(μ2(a1, c1), −1, 1, a1, c1),
we obtain that
αM2(α, −1, 1, a1) < αM2(α, −1, 1, a1, c1), α ∈(μ2(a1, c1), 1].
Now we examine αM2(α, −1, 1, a) for a ﬁxed α ∈[μ2(a1, c1), 1] as a function
with respect to a. Since μ1(a) decreases from 1 to 0, there is a unique ˜a =
˜a(α) such that μ1(˜a) = α. The function M2(α, −1, 1, a) decreases in a ∈
(a1, ˜a(α)] and M2(α, −1, 1, ˜a(α)) = 0. Thus, there exists a unique solution of
the equation (3.22) which we denote by a = a∗(α).
Since a∗(μ2(a1, c1)) = a1 and a∗(α) > a1 for α ∈(μ2(a1, c1), 1], the func-
tion a∗(α) increases for a suﬃciently small α from the interval (μ2(a1, c1), 1].

we apply the same argumentation that was used for the construction of the
solution a = a1, α = μ2(a1, c1). Therefore, a∗(α) increases with increasing
α in the interval (˜α, ˜α + ε). This contradicts the assumption concerning the
behaviour of a∗(α). A similar analysis for α ∈[1, μ2(c1, a1)] completes the
proof of the lemma.

Proof. Lemma 3.2.3 states that there exists a function a∗(α) deﬁned in the
segment [μ2(a1, c1), μ2(c1, a1)], such that M(D∗

the domains D∗

(1)∗. The functions Z(z) and
W(w) are deﬁned in the beginning of Section 3.2.3. The equation
W −c(α∗)
(W −a)(W 2 −1)dW 2 =
(Z −b)2
(Z −c1)(Z −a1)(Z2 −1)dZ2,
is equivalent to the equation in the statement of the theorem. It implies that
the function w = ˜f(z) can be continued analytically onto ∂U, f(−1) = ∞,
and maps ∂U onto the continuum ˜E so that the simply connected domain
C \ ˜E has the conformal radius
2r1r2
(r2 −r1)(1 −r1r2)
R(B∗
1, ∞)
R(D∗
1, ∞).
Thus, the function w = ˜f(z) which we have constructed is holomorphic and
univalent in U with the expansion
˜f(z) =
2r1r2
(r2 −r1)(1 −r1r2)
R(B∗
1, ∞)
R(D∗

The function w = f ∗(z, α) is easily deﬁned as

2r1r2
R(D∗
1, ∞)
R(B∗

˜f(z).
So, it satisﬁes the conditions (i) and (iii) of the statement of Theorem 3.2.4.

,
such that w0 = w1(α1), w0 = w1(α2), α1 ̸= α2, but w2(α1) < w2(α2).
Note, that if w2(α1) = w2(α2), then we would have a∗(α1) = a∗(α2),
what is impossible. Let domains D1, D2 be extremal in the problem for
M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α2)). Then, they are admissible (but not extremal) for
M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α1)) and the inequality
M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α2)) < M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α1))
holds. On the other hand, we have w2(α1) < w2(α2) and, because of Theorem
2.7.2, the modulus M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α1)) increases when the puncture moves
from from w2(α2) to w2(α1) and
M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α1)) < M (1)(α1, w0, w2(α2)).
This contradicts the previous inequality and proves the uniqueness of the
parametric representation of the curve Γ + and (ii).
Now we prove the extremality of the function f ∗(z, α) respectively to the
system of functionals (f(r1), f(r2)). Let f(z) be an arbitrary function from
SR. Choose α such that f(r1) = f ∗(r1, α) = w1(α). Suppose the contrary,
f(r2) > f ∗(r2, α). Then, (f(Dz
1
∗), f(Dz
2
∗)) is a pair of admissible domains for
M (1)(α, w1(α), f(r2)). Further,
Mz(α, r1, r2) = m(f(Dz
1
∗, 0) + α2M(f(Dz
1
∗) ≤M (1)(α, w1(α), f(r2)).
Since f(r2) > w2(α), the inequality
M (1)(α, w1(α), f(r2)) < M (1)(α, w1(α), w2(α))
holds because of the monotonicity of the modulus as before. But the latter
modulus M (1)(α, w1(α), w2(α)) is equal to the initial one by construction.
This contradiction proves the extremality of the function f ∗(z, α) and (iv).
The uniqueness, as usual, follows from the uniqueness of the extremal con-
ﬁgurations.

3.2.4 Upper boundary curve for the range of (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) in S
Here we prove that the upper boundary curve for the range Nf of the system
of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|), 0 < r1 < r2 < 1 in the class S is the same as
in the class SR.

86
3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
Theorem 3.2.5. The upper boundary curve Γ + for the range Nf of the
system of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) in the class S consists of the points
(w1(α), w2(α))
obtained
in
Theorem
3.2.4.
They
are
given
for
each
α ∈[μ2(a1, c1), μ2(c1, a1)] by the unique function f ∗(z, α) ∈SR.
Proof. Without loss of generality assume arg f(r1) = 0. Choose α so that
w1(α) = f(r1) = |f(r1)|. Suppose the contrary, |f(r2)| > w2(α). Then,
(f(Dz
1
∗, f(Dz
2
∗) is a pair of admissible domains for M (k)(α, w1(α), f(r2)) for
some k. So, by Lemma 3.2.1, we have the inequality
Mz(α, r1, r2) = m(f(Dz
1
∗, 0) + α2M(f(Dz
1
∗) ≤
≤M (k)(α, w1(α), f(r2)) ≤M (1)(α, w1(α), f(r2)).
Lemma 3.2.2 applied with the map W(w) yields the inequality
M (1)(α, w1(α), f(r2)) ≤M (1)(α, w1(α), |f(r2)|).
The monotonicity of the modulus by Theorem 2.7.2 yields
M (1)(α, w1(α), |f(r2)|) < M (1)(α, w1(α), w2(α)).
But the latter modulus is equal to the initial one in this chain of inequali-
ties. This contradiction proves the extremality of the function f ∗(z, α) and
the statement of the theorem. The uniqueness, as usual, follows from the
uniqueness of the extremal conﬁgurations.

We note that the lower boundary curve Γ −for the class S is diﬀerent from
that for the class SR. Its points for the class S are given by functions from
S \ SR that map the unit disk onto the plane minus a curve with a unique
ﬁnite endpoint. Since geometric structures in this case are not symmetric it
seems to be not possible to use the modulus method in the form suggested .
The same is for non-real initial points r1, r2.
3.3 Bounded univalent functions
We denote by Bs the class of all univalent holomorphic maps f(z) = bz +
a2z2 + . . . from U into itself with 0 < b < 1. The compact subclass Bs(b)
consists of all functions from Bs with the ﬁrst coeﬃcient b ﬁxed. The function
that plays the same role as the Koebe function in the class S is the so-called
Pick function w = pθ(z). The Pick function satisﬁes the equation
w

3.3 Bounded univalent functions
87
3.3.1 Elementary estimates
⋆By the analogy with the proof of the Koebe Theorem one can obtain the
covering theorem for the class Bs(b).
Theorem 3.3.1. The boundary of the Koebe set
KB =

f∈Bs(b)
f(U)
in the class Bs(b) is the circle
|w| = Rb = −1 + 1 −
√
1 −b
b
If infw∈∂f(U) |w| = Rb for some f, then f is a suitable rotation of the Pick
function.
The growth theorem is given as follows.
Theorem 3.3.2. If f ∈S, then p0(r) ≤|f(z)| ≤pπ(r) with the equality
only for a suitable rotation of the Pick function.
⋆The proof is the same as for the classical Growth Theorem. In the
plane of preimages we choose the same initial extremal domain and consider
the problem of the extremal partition in the unit disk instead of the complex
plane.
More interesting features one can ﬁnd in the distortion theorems.
Theorem 3.3.3. If f ∈Bs, then
|f ′(z)| ≤|f(z)|(1 −|f(z)|)
1 + |f(z)|
1 + r
r(1 −r), r := |z|,
(3.26)
with the Pick function pθ(z) as the extremal one for any p′
θ(0) = b. Moreover,
|f ′(z)| ≤1 for |z| ≤
√
2 −1. The constant
√
2 −1 is sharp.
Proof. Let m(D, a) stand for the reduced modulus of a simply-connected
hyperbolic domain D with respect to a point a ∈D. We take the domain
U \ (ei(π+arg z), 0] as the initial one and calculate the reduced modulus (Sec-
tion 2.4) as m(U \ (ei(π+arg z), 0], z) =
1
2π log 4r(1 −r)/(1 + r). The change of
the reduced modulus under the map f and further symmetrization immedi-
ately lead to the elementary sharp inequality (3.26) in the statement of the
theorem.
Now we deduce the supremum over all such r, that |f ′(z)| ≤1. The
inequality
|f(z)|(1 −|f(z)|)
1 + |f(z)|
1 + r
r(1 −r) ≤1

is equivalent to
|f(z)| ∈[0, min(1 −r
1 + r, r)] ∪[max(1 −r
1 + r, r), 1).
1) 0 ≤r ≤
√
2 −1. Hence, (3.26) is equivalent to
|f(z)| ∈[0, r] ∪[1 −r
1 + r, 1),
because |f(z)| < r. Therefore, |f ′(z)| ≤1 for all z : |z| ≤
√
2 −1, with the
obvious possibility of the equality sign.
2)
√
2 −1 < r < 1. Hence, (3.26) is equivalent to
|f(z)| ∈[0, 1 −r
1 + r] ∪[r, 1).
For
√
2 −1 < |z| < 1 there is a Pick function with some b = p′
θ(0) close
to 1, so that 1−r
1+r < |f(z)| < r and, therefore, |f ′(z)| > 1.

Theorem 3.3.4. If f ∈Bs, then
|f ′(z)| ≥|f(z)|(1 + |f(z)|)
1 −|f(z)|
1 −r
r(1 + r), r := |z|.
The equality occurs for a suitable rotation of the Pick function pθ(z) with any
p′
θ(0) = b.
Proof. For this lower estimate we consider the digon U ′
z = U \[0, exp(i arg z))
with two vertices over the same support z. It is conformal at z, have there
the angles π and the reduced modulus is
m(U ′
z, z, z) = 2
π log 4r(1 + r)
1 −r
(see Section 2.4).
The digon f(U ′
z) with the vertices over f(z) has the reduced modulus
m(f(U ′
z), f(z), f(z)) = 2
π log 4r(1 + r)
1 −r
+ 2
π log |f ′(z)|.
This digon is admissible in the problem of minimum of the reduced modulus
over all digons on S0 = U \{0, f(z)} conformal at f(z) with corresponding an-
gles and of homotopy type deﬁned by a curve γ that connects on S0 the point
f(z) with itself and homotopic on S0 to the slit [0, f(z)]. The extremal digon
D is C with the slit along the segment [0, exp(i arg f(z))] passing through
the point f(z). Its reduced modulus is equal to 2

conﬁguration leads to the uniqueness of the extremal map up to rotation. 2
Theorem 3.3.4 and the inequality (3.26) are due to R. M. Robinson (see
[49], page 57, Theorem 22). The statement of Theorem 3.3.3 about the
constant

(J. Dieudonn´e [25]) (see e.g. [23], page 18).

3.3.2 Boundary curve for the range of (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|) in Bs(b)
Now we describe the range of the system of functionals (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|) in the
class Bs(b). By a suitable rotation we can assume z = r ∈(0, 1).
Let Uz = U \ {0, r}, r ∈(0, 1) be the punctured unit disk. We consider
on Uz the system of curves (γz
1, γz
2) where γz
2 = {z : |z −r| = ε} and γz
1 =
{z : |z| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small such that r + ε < 1 and ε < r/2. Let
Dz be a set of all pairs (Dz
1, Dz
2) of simply connected domains of homotopy
type (γz
1, γz
2). Then, the problem of the extremal partition of Uz consists of
maximizing the sum m(Dz
1, 0) + α2m(Dz
2, r) over all (Dz
1, Dz
2) ∈Dz. The
maximum of this sum we denote by Mz(α, r). Under the transformation
Z(z) = 1 −r(1 + z)2
z(1 + r)2
two extremal domains (Dz
1
∗, Dz
2
∗) in the problem of Mz(α, r) are mapped
onto the two extremal domains (B1
∗, B2
∗) in the problem of M(α, c) (we use
here notations of Section 3.1.3), where c = (1 −r)2/(1 + r)2. Taking into
account the change of the reduced moduli under the conformal map Z(z) we
deduce that for (1 −r)/(1 + r) ≤α ≤(1 + r)/(1 −r)
m(Dz
1
∗, 0) = 1
2π log rα,
m(Dz
2
∗, r) = 1
2π log r1/α(1 −r2).
Theorems 3.1.5, 3.1.6 and suitable conformal maps imply that for 0 ≤

Here (*) denotes the extremality of domains.
Let x ∈(0, r). We consider the same modulus problem in the unit disk
with x in place of r. The extremal domains for this problem we denote by
(Dw
1
∗, Dw
1
∗) ∈Dw. The preceding formulae give the values of the correspond-
ing reduced moduli.
We deﬁne now a problem of the extremal partition of the disk U by digons.
Let 0, r be punctures in U. We consider the family D of digons D in U such

90
3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
that the points 0, ω are not in D but they are two vertices of any D ∈D. All
digons under consideration are supposed to be conformal with the angles 2π
at the vertices. We deﬁne the problem of minimizing
min
D∈D m(D, 0, r).
There is a unique digon D∗= U \ {(−1, 0] ∪[r, 1)} that gives this minimum.
The reduced modulus is calculated in Section 2.4 as
m(D∗, 0, r) = 1
2π log
r2
1 −r2 .
We evaluate now the system of functionals I(f) = (|f(r)|, |f ′(r)|), f ∈
Bs(b). Denote by Γ + the arc of y = max |f ′(r)| as f ∈Bs(b) with |f(r)| = x
ﬁxed, and by Γ −the arc of y = min |f ′(r)| as f ∈Bs(b) with |f(r)| = x
ﬁxed. We deﬁne here the range of I(f), f ∈Bs(b) by the moduli calculated
before. Set the functions
g(z) =
z
1 −uz + z2 ,
u ∈[−2, 2],
and G(z, u) = g−1(b · g(z)).
Theorem 3.3.5. The boundary curve Γ −of the range Mf of the sys-
tem of functionals (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|) in the class Bs(b) consists of the points
(x(u), y(u)) where x = G(r, u), y = G′
z(r, u) for −2 ≤u ≤2, r = |z|. Each
point is given only by the function G(z, u) or its rotation.
Proof. Since
p0(r) = G(r, −2) ≤G(r, u) ≤G(r, 2) = pπ(r),
for u ∈[−2, 2], we choose for a function f ∈Bs(b) the unique u = u0 such
that x = |f(r)| = G(r, u0). Consider the digon U ′
z = U \{(−1, 0]∪[r, 1)} with
two vertices 0, r. It is conformal at 0, r and the reduced modulus given by
m(U ′
z, 0, r) = 1
2π log
r2
1 −r2 .
The digon f(U ′
z) with the vertices 0, f(r) has the reduced modulus
m(f(U ′
z), 0, f(r)) = 1
2π log
r2
1 −r2 |f ′(r)|b.
This digon is admissible in the problem of minimum of the reduced modulus
over all digons of homotopy type deﬁned by γ = [0, x] which are conformal
at 0, x and have the angles 2π. The extremal reduced modulus

91
m(D∗, 0) = 1
2π log
x2

is given by the digon obtained from U by deleting two segments (−1, 0] and
[x, 1). Therefore, |f ′(r)| ≥
(1−r2)x2
(1−x2)r2b. This is equivalent to the statement of
the theorem. The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration G(U ′
z, u0) leads
to the uniqueness of the extremal map.
2
Let us deﬁne now the curve Γ +. For this we need the following technical
lemma.
Lemma 3.3.1. For (1 −r)/(1 + r) ≤α ≤(1 + r)/(1 −r) the function x(α)
deﬁned by the equation
m(Dw
1
∗, 0) = m(Dz
1
∗, 0) + 1
2π log b,
is continuous and strictly increases from G(r, −2) to G(r, 2) with increasing
α.
For α ∈[ 1−r
1+r, α1] the function x(α) is a unique solution to the equation
rαb =
x
(1 + x)2
4(1 −α)α−1
(1 + α)α+1 .
For α ∈[α1, α2] the function x(α) is is deﬁned as
x(α) = (rαb)1/α.
For α ∈[α2, 1+r
1−r] the function x(α) is a unique solution to the equation
rαb =
x
(1 −x)2
4(α −1)α−1
(1 + α)α+1 .
Here the quantities m(Dw
1
∗, 0) and m(Dz
1
∗, 0) are deﬁned before, and α1 is a
unique solution to the equation
rαb =
1 −α
1 + α
α
,
α2 is a unique solution to the equation
rαb =
α + 1
α −1
α
.
Proof. For
α ∈
1 −x
1 + x, 1 + x
1 −x

the value of x(α) = (rαb)1/α obviously increases.

92

For
α ∈

1 + x

,
we have the derivative
x′(α)(1 −x)
(1 + x)x
= log r(1 + α)
(1 −α) .
This implies x′(α) > 0. The case
α ∈
1 + x
1 −x, 1 + r
1 −r

is considered analogously. The values of α1 and α2 are deduced from the
equations α = (1−x(α))/(1+x(α)) and α = (1+x(α))/(1−x(α)) respectively.

Theorem 3.3.6. (i) The upper boundary curve Γ + of the range Mf of the
system of functionals (|f(r)|, |f ′(r)|) in the class Bs(b) consists of the points
(x(α), y(α)), α ∈[(1 −r)/(1 + r), (1 + r)/(1 −r)]. Here x(α) is deﬁned by
Lemma 3.3.1 and

(ii) Each point (x(α), y(α)) of Γ + is given by a unique function w =
F(z, α) satisfying the diﬀerential equation
ϕ(z)dz2 = ψ(w)dw2,
where
ϕ(z)dz2 =
(z −d)2(z −¯d)2
z2(z −r)2(z −1/r)2 dz2,
such that |d| = 1 and d is one of the conjugated solutions to the equation

ψ(w)dw2 =

where c = c(α) is a unique solution in (x, 1) to the equation
1 −α2 = x(1 + c)2
c(1 + x)2 ,
and we assume the sign (-) in nominator of ψ for α ∈[(1 −r)/(1 + r), α1];
c = c(α) is a unique solution in (−1, 0) to the equation
1 −α2 = x(1 −c)2
c(1 −x)2 ,
and we assume the sign (+) for α ∈[α2, (1 + r)/(1 −r)];
ψ(w)dw2 =
(w −c)2(w −¯c)2
w2(w −x(α))2(w −1/x(α))2 dw2,
where c = c(α) is such that |c| = 1 and c is one of the solutions to the
equation
α1 −x
1 + x = 1 −x(1 + c)2
c(1 + x)2
for α ∈[α1, α2].
The function F(z, α) maps the unit disk U onto itself with a slit along the
piecewise analytic curve with two simmetric endpoints. The simply connected
domain F(U, α) has the reduced modulus b with respect to the origin.
Proof. Let f ∈Bs(b) with a ﬁxed value of |f(r)| = x. The previous lemma
asserts that there is a unique α such that x(α) = x. Consider the functions
f1(z) and f2(z) satisfying the equations
df1(z)
f1(z)
2
= 4π2ϕ(z)dz2,
df2(w)
f2(w)
2
= 4π2ψ(w)dw2,
where the diﬀerentials ϕ(z)dz2 and ψ(w)dw2 are deﬁned in the statement
of the theorem and α is chosen. Theorems 3.1.5, 3.1.6, the transformation
Z(z), and a suitable map from Uw yield that the superposition f −1
2
◦f1(z)
maps conformally the domain Dz
1
∗onto the domain Dw
1
∗and the form of
the diﬀerentials ϕ and ψ follows from that of the diﬀerentials Q and Φ in
Section 3.1.3. We continue this map analytically onto Dz
2
∗and obtain the
function F(z, α) that maps the unit disk onto the domain which is admissible
with respect to the diﬀerential ψ(w)dw2. The function satisﬁes the equality
F ′(r, α) = x(α) and meets all conditions of the theorem. We have the obvious
equality results from the change of the reduced moduli
m(f(Dz
1
∗), 0) + α2m(f(Dz
2
∗), f(r)) =

2π log b + α2
2π log |f ′(r)|.
We now symmetrize the pair of domains (f(Dz
1
∗), f(Dz
2
∗)) with respect to
the origin and the positive real semiaxis. Let us denote the result of this
symmetrization by ( ˜D1, ˜D2). This pair is admissible and the pair (Dw
1
∗, Dw
2
∗)
is extremal in the family Dw, so we have the following chain of inequalities
m(f(Dz
1
∗), 0) + α2m(f(Dz
2
∗), r) ≤m( ˜D1, 0) + α2m( ˜D2, x) ≤

2π log b + α2
2π log |F ′(r, α)|.
Then, |f ′(r)| ≤|F ′(r, α)| = y(α). The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁgura-
tion implies the uniqueness of the extremal function.

A general form of the range of the system of functionals (f(r), f ′(r))
in Bs(b) was described by the parametric method by V. V. Gorya˘ınov,
V. Ya. Gutlyanski˘ı in [51]. Their result does not allow to deduce Theorem
3.3.6. One also could obtain a result on two-point distortion but huge formu-
lations could make this useless. A collection of results in the class Bs(b) by
the variational, parametric, and area methods is presented in [143], [144].
3.4 Montel functions
Denote by M(ω) the class of all univalent holomorphic in U functions f(z) =
a1z + a2z2 + . . . with the additional normalization f(ω) = ω where ω ∈
(0, 1). This normalization is known as the Montel normalization. The subclass
M M(ω) means that |f(z)| < M with M > 1 in U. The functions
K1(z) = z(1 + ω)2
(1 + z)2 ,
K2(z) = z(1 −ω)2

play the role of the Koebe functions for the class M(ω). The functions

3.4.1 Covering theorems
We start with the covering theorem for the class M(ω) that has been obtained
by J. Krzy˙z and E. Zlotkiewicz in 1971 [77]. We consider the modulus problem
for the family Γ of closed curves on S0 = C \ {0, ω, A} which are homotopic
on S0 to the slit along the segment [0, ω] if A ̸∈[0, ω] or along a broken line
[0, A + iε] ∪[A + iε, ω] otherwise. Denote by m(A) the modulus m(S0, Γ). In
[78] the value of m(A) was calculated as
m(A) = 1
2Im τ
 ω2
A2

,
where τ is the modular function given by
τ(k2) = iK ′(k)
K (k) .
Here the elliptic integrals K (k) and K ′(k) are understood to be the positive
valued functions coinciding with usual elliptic integrals for k2 ∈(0, 1), deﬁned
for Im k2 ̸= 0 by the analytic continuation along any path not intersecting
the real axis of the k2-plane, and deﬁned by analytic continuation along any
path in the lower half-plane Im k2 ≤0 for k2 > 1.
We consider the set of points A on S0 satisfying the equation m(A) =
R = const > 0. Then, this set is a closed smooth curve if R > 1/4 that
encloses the points 0, ω. Otherwise, this set consists of two closed arcs with
angles at their intersection with the real axis between 0, ω. The form of this
curve was studied by G. Kuz’mina ([78], page 205). For Im A ≥0 the arc
(or two arcs) of this curve is mapped by the function τ = τ(k2) onto one (or
two) segment of the line Im τ = R/2.

Each point A ∈∂KM is given by the unique function f ∗∈M(ω) such that
A = f ∗(eiθ). It maps U onto C with the slit along a smooth curve which is
the critical trajectory of the quadratic diﬀerential

which is extremal for m(A).
Proof. Denote by Uz = U\[0, ω] with the modulus M(Uz) = K (ω)/(4K ′(ω)).
Suppose, there is a function f ∈M(ω) such that the value w0 = f(eiθ) ∈KM
for some θ. The domain f(Uz) is admissible in the modulus problem for one
of the homotopy classes Γ (n) of curves that separate 0, ω and w0, ∞on S0.
Lemma 3.2.1 asserts that the modulus m(S0, Γ (n)) attains its maximum over
(n) for n = 1, i.e., m(S0, Γ (n)) ≤m(w0). This means that
K (ω)
4K ′(ω) = M(Uz) = M(f(Uz)) ≤m(w0).
The extremal associated doubly connected domain D∗in the problem of the

of γ2 that connects ∞with the point of the intersection A = γ2 ∩∂KM,
by ˜D the doubly connected domain C \ {γ1 ∪˜γ2}. Evidently, D∗⊂˜D and
m(w0) = M(D∗) < M( ˜D). The domain ˜D is admissible in the problem of
the extremal partition for m(A). This implies the inequality M( ˜D) ≤m(A).
This chain of inequalities contradicts the equation that deﬁnes A
m(A) = K (ω)
4K ′(ω).
This completes the proof.

3.4 Montel functions

An analogous theorem is valid for the bounded Montel functions. The
modulus problem should be considered for the family Γ of closed curves on
Uw = U(0, M) \ {0, ω, A} which are homotopic on Uw to the slit along the
segment [0, ω] if A ̸∈[0, ω] or along a broken line [0, A + iε] ∪[A + iε, ω]
otherwise. Denote by m(A) the modulus m(Uw, Γ).
Theorem 3.4.2. The boundary of the Koebe set
KM M =

f∈M M(ω)
f(U)
in the class M M(ω) consists of the points which are the solutions to the
equation
m(A) = K (ω)
4K ′(ω).
Each point A ∈∂KM M is given by the unique function f ∗∈M M(ω) such
that A = f ∗(eiθ). It maps U onto U(0, M) with the slit along the smooth
curve which is the critical trajectory of the quadratic diﬀerential
ϕ(w)dw2 =
¯η(w −η)2dw2
w(w −ω)(1 −ωw)(w −A)(1 −¯Aw),
which is extremal for m(A).
Since there is no such a good description of the boundary curve of KM M
as for the class M(ω) we give a theorem about its geometric properties.
Theorem 3.4.3. The Koebe set KM M in the class M M(ω) contains the
union of the disk U(0, |KM
2 (−1)|) and its image under the transformation
Λ(ζ) = ω −ζ
1 −ζω
M 2
.
Proof. A simple application of the functions KM
1 (z) and KM
2 (z) yields that
the points KM
2 (−1) and KM
1 (1) belong to ∂KM M . Let there be a point A ∈
∂KM M , A ∈U(0, |KM
2 (−1)|). Let m(A) be the modulus of Theorem 3.4.1 and
D∗be the extremal domain for m(A). Denote by Ds the result of circular
symmetrization applied to D∗with respect to the origin and the positive real
axis. Evidently, Ds ⊂{U(0, M) \ {(−M, KM
2 (−1)] ∪[0, ω]}}. Hence,
m(A) = M(D∗) ≤M(Ds) < m(KM
2 (−1)).
This contradicts KM
2 (−1) ∈∂KM M .
One can observe that KM
1 (1) = Λ(KM
2 (−1)), KM
1 (1) ∈∂KM M . Let again
A ∈∂KM M , A ∈Λ(U(0, |KM
2 (−1)|)). Then, m(A) = M(Λ−1(D∗)) and
Λ−1(A) ∈U(0, |KM
2 (−1)|). Next we symmetrize the domain Λ−1(D∗) as

in the previous case and widen the domain, which is obtained from the Λ-
image of the result of symmetrization, up to the domain U(0, M) \ {[0, ω] ∪
[KM
1 (1), M)}. As a result, we obtain the inequality
M(D∗) = m(A) = M(Λ−1(D∗)) < m(KM
1 (1)).
This contradicts KM
1 (1) ∈∂KM M and ﬁnishes the proof.

These results have been obtained by J. Krzy˙z [77], R. Libera, E. Zlotkiewicz
[92], and A. Vasil’ev, P. Pronin [165].
3.4.2 Distortion at the points of normalization
Theorem 3.4.4. Let f ∈M(ω), f(z) = a1z + a2z2 + . . . . Then,

1 −ω
1 + ω ≤|f ′(ω)| ≤1 + ω

The extremal functions are only K1(z) and K2(z).
These estimates immediately follow from the connection between the class
S and the class M(ω):
(g(z) ∈S) ⇐⇒

Now we learn more explicitly the mutual change of |f ′(0)| and |f ′(ω)|. De-
note by Γ + the arc of y = max |f ′(ω)| as f ∈M(α) with |f ′(0)| = x
ﬁxed, and by Γ −the arc of y = min |f ′(ω)| as f ∈M(ω) with |f ′(0)| = x
ﬁxed. We determine here the range of the system of the functionals Mf =
{(|f ′(0)|, |f ′(ω)|), f ∈M(ω)} by the modulus method analogously to the
system of functionals (|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|) in the class S in Section 3.1.4.
Theorem 3.4.5. The boundary curve Γ −of the range Mf of the system of

It is admissible in the problem of minimum of the reduced modulus over
all digons having the homotopy type deﬁned by γ = [0, ω], conformal at
0, ω, with appropriate angles at the vertices. The extremal reduced modulus
1
2π log ω2 is given by the digon obtained from C by slitting along two rays
starting from 0 and ω lying on the straight line that passes through these
two points. Therefore, |f ′(r)| ≥1−ω2

. This is equivalent to the statement of
the theorem. The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration g(U ′) leads to the
uniqueness of the extremal map.

Now we use the moduli calculated in Section 3.1.3 to deﬁne the upper
boundary curve Γ + for the range of (|f ′(0)|, |f ′(ω)|) in the class M(ω).
Our proof is based on simultaneous consideration of two problems of the
extremal partition in the punctured unit disk and in the punctured Riemann
sphere. The proof is somewhat similar to that for the system of functionals
(|f(z)|, |f ′(z)|) in S in 3.1.4.
Let Uz = U \ {0, ω} be the punctured unit disk. We consider on Uz the
admissible system (γz
1, γz
2) of type III where γz
2 = {z : |z −ω| = ε} and
γz
1 = {z : |z| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small so that ω + ε < 1 and
ε < ω/2. Let Dz be the set of all pairs (Dz
1, Dz
2) of simply connected domains
of homotopy type (γz
1, γz
2). Then, the problem of the extremal partition of Uz
consists of maximizing the sum m(Dz
1, 0) + α2m(Dz
2, ω) over (Dz
1, Dz
2) ∈Dz.
The maximum of this sum we denote by Mz(α, ω). Under the transformation
Z(z) = 1 −ω(1 + z)2
z(1 + ω)2
two extremal domains (Dz
1
∗, Dz
2
∗) in the problem for Mz(α, ω) are mapped
onto two extremal domains (B1
∗, B2
∗) in the problem of ﬁnding M(α, c),
where c = (1 −ω)2/(1 + ω)2. Taking into account the change of the reduced
modulus under the conformal map Z(z), we deduce that for (1−ω)/(1+ω) ≤
α ≤(1 + ω)/(1 −ω) the reduced moduli are given as
m(Dz

∗, 0) = 1
2π log ωα,
m(Dz

3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
Let Cw = C \ {0, ω} be the punctured Riemann sphere. We consider on
Cw the admissible system (γw
1 , γw
2 ) of type III where γw
1 = {z : |w| = ε} and
γz
2 = {z : |w −ω| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small so that ε < ω/2. Let Dw
be the set of all pairs (Dw
1 , Dw
2 ) of simply connected domains of homotopy
type (γw
1 , γw
2 ). Then, the problem of extremal partition of Cw consists of
maximizing the sum m(Dw
1 , 0) + α2m(Dw
2 , ω) over all (Dw
1 , Dw
2 ) ∈Dw. The
maximum of this sum we denote by Mw(α). Under the transformation
W(w) = ω −w
ωw
two extremal domains (Dw
1
∗, Dw
2
∗) in the problem for Mw(α) are mapped
onto two extremal domains (D1
∗, D2
∗) in the problem of ﬁnding M(α). Tak-
ing into account the change of the reduced moduli under the conformal map
W(w), we deduce that for α ̸= 1
m(Dw

For α = 1 we have
m(Dw

∗, 0) = 1
2π log ω.
Lemma 3.1.1 in our case is of the following form.
Lemma 3.4.1. For (1 −ω)/(1 + ω) ≤α ≤(1 + ω)/(1 −ω) the function
x(α) = exp(2π(m(Dw
1
∗, 0) −m(Dz
1
∗, 0)))
is continuous and strictly decreases in α from (1 + ω)2 to (1 −ω)−2.
Proof. For (1 −ω)/(1 + ω) ≤α < 1 we have the derivative
x′(α)
x(α) = 1
2π log
1 −α
(1 + α)ω .
This implies x′(α) < 0. It is easy to obtain that
lim
α→1+0 x(α) =
lim
α→1−0 x(α) = x(1).
The case α > 1 is proved similarly.

Theorem 3.4.6. (i) The upper boundary curve Γ + of the range Mf of the
system of functionals (|f ′(0)|, |f ′(ω)|) in the class M(ω) consists of the points
(x(α), y(α)) where

If α = 1, then x(1) = 1, y(1) = 1/(1 −ω2).
(ii) Each point (x(α), y(α)) of Γ + is given by the unique function F(z, α)
satisfying the diﬀerential equation
ϕ(z)dz2 = ψ(w)dw2, α ̸= 1,
ϕ(z)dz2 =

such that |d| = 1 and d is one of the conjugated solutions to the equation
α1 −ω
1 + ω = 1 −ω(1 + d)2
d(1 + ω)2 ,
C = C(α) =
x(α)
1 −α2 .
The function F(z, α) maps the unit disk onto the complex plane C minus the
ray [C(α), +∞) in case α < 1 or (−∞, C(α)] otherwise, and two smooth arcs
of trajectories of the diﬀerential ψ(w) dw2 symmetric with respect to R such
that the simply connected domain F(U, α) has the reduced modulus x(α) with
respect to the origin.
If α = 1, then
ϕ(z)dz2 =
(z −d)2(z −¯d)2
z2(z −ω)2(z −1/ω)2 dz2,
ψ(w)dw2 =

w2(w −ω)2 dw2,
and the function F(z, 1) maps the unit disk onto the complex plane C slit
along the symmetric with respect to R rays along the straight line Re w = ω/2
with the analogous normalization.
Proof. Let f ∈M(ω) with a ﬁxed value of |f ′(0)| = x. The preceding lemma
asserts that there is such α that x(α) = x. We consider the functions f1(z)
and f2(z) satisfying the equations

where the diﬀerentials ϕ(z)dz2 and ψ(w)dw2 are deﬁned in the statement of
the theorem and α is chosen. The superposition f −1

the domain Dz

∗. Furthermore, we continue this map
analytically onto Dz

∗and obtain the function F(z, α) that maps the unit disk
onto the domain which is admissible with respect to the diﬀerential ψ(w)dw2.
The function satisﬁes the equality F ′(0, α) = x(α) and meets all conditions
of the theorem. Since the pair (Dw
1
∗, Dw
2
∗) is extremal in the family Dw, we
deduce that the following chain of inequalities

is valid. Then, |f ′(ω)| ≤|F ′(ω, α)| = y(α). The uniqueness of the extremal
conﬁguration implies the uniqueness of the extremal function.

The boundary curves Γ + and Γ −were obtained by S. D¨emin in [24] with
some calculus errors.
We consider now the problem for the class of bounded Montel functions.
From [92] it follows that if f ∈M M(ω), then
M 2(1 −ω)2
(M −ω)2
≤|f ′(0)| ≤M 2(1 + ω)2
(M + ω)2 .
The equality sign is attained by the function KM
1
for the right-hand side
inequality and by the function KM
2
for the left-hand side inequality. It is not
diﬃcult to obtain the analogous estimates for |f ′(ω)|:
(M + ω)(1 −ω)
(M −ω)(1 + ω) ≤|f ′(ω)| ≤(M −ω)(1 + ω)
(M + ω)(1 −ω),
with the same extremal functions. Therefore, the range of the system of
functionals (|f ′(0)|, |f ′(ω)|) lies inside the rectangle deﬁned by the preceding
inequalities. To obtain the sharp form of the boundary curve we consider
some special problems of the extremal partition.
Let Uz = U \ {0, ω}, ω ∈(0, 1) be the punctured unit disk. We consider
on Uz the admissible system of curves (γz

and γz
1 = {z : |z| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small so that ω + ε < 1 and
ε < ω/2. Let Dz be the set of all pairs (Dz

consists of maximizing the sum m(Dz

where c = (1 −ω)2/(1 + ω)2. Taking into account the change of the reduced

1 = {w : |w| = ε}. Here ε is suﬃciently small as before.
Let Dw be the set of all pairs (Dw

The maximum of this sum we denote by Mw(α, ω). Theorems 3.1.5, 3.1.6

with the angles 2π. Al digons are supposed to be conformal at their vertices.
We deﬁne the problem of ﬁnding the minimum

There is a unique digon D∗

minimum. One can calculate this reduced modulus by making use of suitable
conformal maps of D∗

We evaluate now the system of the functionals (|f ′(0)|, |f ′(ω)|), f ∈

Denote by Γ + the arc of y = max |f ′(ω)| as f ∈M M(ω) with |f ′(0)| = x
ﬁxed, and by Γ −the arc of y = min |f ′(ω)| as f ∈M M(ω) with |f ′(0)| = x

Theorem 3.4.7. The boundary curve Γ −of the range Mf of the system
of functionals (|f ′(0)|, |f ′(ω)|) in the class M M(ω) consists of the points

y = (1 −ω2)(M 2 −Muω + ω2)

as −2 ≤u ≤2. Each point is given only by the function G(z).
Proof. Since

M 2 −Muω + ω2 ≤M 2(1 + ω)2

such that x = |f ′(0)| = G′(0). We consider the digon U ′

the statement of the theorem. The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration
G(U ′

We deﬁne now the curve Γ +. For this we need the following technical
lemma
Lemma 3.4.2. For (1 −ω)/(1 + ω) ≤α ≤(1 + ω)/(1 −ω) the function

the value of x(α) = M 1−α obviously decreases.

The function F(z, α) maps the unit disk onto the disk U(M) slit along a
piecewise analytic curve with two simmetric endpoints. The simply connected
domain F(U, α) has the reduced modulus x(α) with respect to the origin.
Proof. Let f ∈M M(ω) with a ﬁxed value of |f ′(0)| = x. The previous lemma
asserts that there is a unique α such that x(α) = x. Consider the functions
f1(z) and f2(w) satisfying the equations

where the diﬀerentials ϕ(z)dz2 and ψ(w)dw2 are deﬁned in the statement

Z(z), and a suitable map from the surface Uw yield that the superposition
f −1

◦f1(z) maps conformally the domain Dz

form of the diﬀerentials ϕ and ψ follows from that of the diﬀerentials Q and Φ
of Section 3.1.3. Continuing this mapping analytically onto Dz

function F(z, α) that maps the unit disk onto the domain which is admissible
with respect to the diﬀerential ψ(w)dw2. The function satisﬁes the equality
F ′(0, α) = x(α) and meets all requirements of the theorem. Since the pair
(Dw

inequalities

3.4.3 The range of (|f(r)|, |f ′(r)|) in MR(ω)
In the class of all holomorphic univalent in U functions with normalization
f(0) = 0 we have the inequality (see [100])
|f(r2)|
|f(r1)| ≤r2(1 −r1)2
r1(1 −r2)2
for 0 < r1 < r2 < 1. So, the upper bound of |f(r)| in M(ω) for ω < r < 1
easily follows from this estimate
|f(r)| ≤r(1 −ω)2
(1 −r)2
with the extremal function K2. The analogous easy estimate holds for |f(−r)|.
However, the extremal functions for the case 0 < r < ω or for the complex
value of r have more complicated nature and do not map symmetric structures
in U onto those in C. We do not intend to develop these features here and
refer the reader to J. Krzy˙z [76] who obtained the range of f(z) in the class
M(ω) by the variational method. Since we operate with symmetric extremal
structures we consider in this section the class MR(ω) of functions from M(ω)
with real coeﬃcients in their Taylor expansion. This class plays the same role
as SR for S.
For this class the estimates of |f(r)| can be obviously derived from the
connection with the class SR. Namely,
K1(r) ≤f(r) ≤K2(r), for ω ≤r < 1,
K2(r) ≤f(r) ≤K1(r), for 0 ≤r < ω,
K1(−r) ≤f(−r) ≤K2(−r), for −1 < r < 0.
Now we obtain the range of the system of functionals (f(r), f ′(r)) for the
class MR(ω). For this we need to calculate some special moduli of extremal

−1 < a < 1 the pair of non-intersected curves (γ1, γ2) of type III forming an
admissible system on S0. The curve γ1 starting and ending at ∞separates
the puncture at 1 from −1, a; the curve γ2 starting and ending at ∞separates
the puncture at -1 from 1, a. For a given vector (1, α) let D be the family
of all pairs (D1, D2) of non-overlapping domains of homotopic type (γ1, γ2),
Dj is a digon on S0 with its vertices over the same support ∞which is
conformal at its vertices. It is of homotopy type γj, j = 1, 2. The condition
of compatibility of angles and weights is given as follows: D1 has two equal
angles β at its vertices over ∞. Consequently, the digon D∗

angles π −β, β = π/(1 + α). Degeneracy is permissible as (A) D1 = ∅or (B)

Consequently, we consider on the Riemann surface S1 = C\{−1, c1, a1, 1},

forming an admissible system on S1. The curve γ1 starting and ending at ∞
separates the puncture at 1 from −1, c1, a1; the curve γ2 starting and ending
at ∞separates the puncture at -1 from 1, c1, a1. Now let B be a family of all
pairs (B1, B2) of non-overlapping domains of homotopic type (γ1, γ2), Bj be a

The proof of this theorem is analogous to that for Theorem 3.4.9, so we
omit it.
Remark 3.4.2. Let 0 < r1 < r2 < 1, Rj = rj + 1/rj, j = 1, 2. Set
a1 = 1 + 2(R1 −R2)

Then, the inverse map z(Z) satisﬁes the equalities z(−1) = r2, z(1) = r1,
z(a1) = 1, z(c1) = −1. The extremal conﬁguration (B∗

Now we need the following technical lemma.
Lemma 3.4.3. Let 0 < r1 < r2 < 1 and the values of a1, c1 be deﬁned as in
the remark to Theorem 3.4.10. Then, there is a unique function a(α) deﬁned
in α ∈[μ1, μ2] by the equation
M1(α, −1, a, 1) = M1(α, −1, c1, a1, 1).
(3.30)
Proof. First, assume α = α0. Then, the equation (3.30) implies
α0 =
π −2

,
a(α0) = −cos

π

Now let α ∈[μ1, α0]. Then, the equation (3.30) is equivalent to the equation

Im ω
K (k) = Im ω1
K (k1).
(3.31)
Obviously, at α = μ1 the problem about M(α, −1, c1, a1, 1) is equivalent to
that about M(α, −1, a, 1). Hence,
Im ω
K (k)

α=μ1, a=a1
= Im ω1
K (k1).
Under these conditions the equation (3.30) has the solution a(μ1) = a1. Since
α =
c

−1

A(c −x)
(1 −x2)(a −x)dx,
the function c(a, α) increases with respect to a for any ﬁxed α ∈[μ1, α0], and
increases with respect to α for any ﬁxed a ∈[c1, a1]. Therefore, for a = a1
the functions k and K (k) increase with respect to α, the function p decreases
with respect to α, and dn (ω, k) increases with respect to α. The function
dn (ω, k) decreases with respect to Im ω ∈[K (k), K (k) + 2iK ′(k)] from
√
1 −k2 to −
√
1 −k2 for a ﬁxed k. Since dn (ω, k) decreases with respect
to k for ﬁxed Im ω, the hypothesis that Im ω increases on α contradicts
increasing of dn (ω, k) with increasing α. Therefore,
Im ω
K (k)

α∈(μ1,α0), a=a1
< Im ω1
K (k1).
Analogously,
Im ω
K (k)

α∈(μ1,α0), a=c1
> Im ω1
K (k1).
The continuity of the left-hand side of (3.31) implies the existence of the
solution to the equation (3.30) for any ﬁxed α ∈(μ1, α0). The existence of
the solution for α ∈(α0, μ2] is provided in the same manner.
Now we prove the uniqueness. For this we use the monotonicity of c(a, α)
with respect to a for a ﬁxed α. Analogously the preceding observations we
obtain that Im ω/K (k) decreases in a ∈[c1, a1]. This yields the uniqueness.

Let the pairs (D∗

These functions map their domains onto the strip 0 < Re ζ < α. Then,
the map W = F(Z) has the form F = g−1

◦g2. From the equation (3.32)
it follows that the function F(Z) has an analytical continuation onto the

[c1, a1] onto the continuum w(E) where the function w(W) is deﬁned in

The above results have been obtained in see [157], [164]. The upper bound-
ary curve for the system of the functionals (f(r), f ′(r)), 0 < ω < r < 1 can be
obtained (see [166]) by use the results of Section 3.2.2. The extremal functions
map the unit disk onto the complex plane minus a symmetric slit with two
ﬁnite endpoints. Principally, this result does not use more, than the results
of Theorem 3.4.11, 3.4.12, and we will not develop this point here.

3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
3.5 Univalent functions with the angular derivatives
We consider conformal maps f of U into U. We have already discuss some
properties of the angular limits and the angular derivatives in Section 2.2.3.
We brieﬂy remind here that the angular limit
f(ζ) =
lim
z→ζ, z∈Δ f(z), Δ is any Stolz angle at ζ,
exists for almost all ζ ∈∂U, the exceptional set even has zero capacity. In
general, very little can be said about the existence of the angular derivative
f ′(ζ) =
lim
z→ζ, z∈Δ f ′(z),
see, e.g., ([112], Chapter 6) for the discussion.
The situation becomes much better when we restrict ourselves to the set
A = {ζ ∈∂U : f(ζ} exists and |f(ζ)| = 1},
because the angular derivative exists for every ζ ∈A by the Julia-Wolﬀ
Lemma ([112], Proposition 4.13), even without the assumption that f is in-
jective in U. It may, however, be inﬁnite. In our case of univalent functions,
it follows from the McMillan Twist Theorem [98] that f ′(ζ) ̸= ∞for almost
all ζ ∈A.
Here we denote by S1(β) the class of all holomorphic, univalent in the unit
disk U functions f(z) = az +a2z2 +. . . , f(1) = 1 that map U →U and have
the ﬁnite angular derivative |f ′(1)| = β ﬁxed. The class S1(β) is diﬀerent
comparing with other classes of univalent functions and possess some new
features. Set the canonical Pick function (only one) for this class
Ka(z) = k−1
π
(akπ(z)) ,
a ∈(0, 1),
a =
4h
(1 + h)2 ,
kπ(z) =
z
(1 −z)2 .
It maps U onto the unit disk slit along (−1, −h]. For a = 1/β2 the function
Ka(z) belongs to S1(β), and |K′
a(0)| = a = 1/β2. The class S1(β) is not
compact. Indeed, consider the sequence of functions fn from S1(β) that map
U onto U slit along two segments starting form the points exp (±iπ/n) which
are parallel to the real axis and of length 1/n. Obviously, lim
n→∞fn = id, which
does not belong to the class S1(β).
3.5.1 Estimates of the angular derivatives
For the class S1(β) the obvious estimate 0 < |f ′(0)| < 1 holds. The right-hand
side inequality is never reachable, but sharp due to the previous example. In
order to provide the sharp form of the left-hand side inequality we prove the
following theorem.

3.5 Univalent functions with the angular derivatives
121
Theorem 3.5.1. For all functions from S1(β) the sharp estimate a :=
|f ′(0)| ≥1/β2 holds with the extremal function Ka(z).
Proof. Let f ∈S1(β). We consider the digon Uz = U \ (−1, 0] with two
vertices 0,1. It is conformal at 0, 1, with the angles 2π, π at the vertices 0,1
respectively, and its reduced modulus is m(Uz, 0, 1) = 0. The digon f(Uz)
with the vertices 0,1 is also conformal at 0, 1, has the same angles and the
reduced modulus
m(f(Uz), 0, 1) = 1
2π log |f ′(0)| + 1
π log β.
It is admissible in the problem of minimum of the reduced modulus over
all digons having the homotopy type deﬁned by γ = [0, 1] (with the angles
2π and π at the vertices 0, 1 respectively where they are conformal). The
extremal reduced modulus m(D∗
1, 0, 1) = 0 is given by the same digon Uw =
Uz. Therefore, |f ′(0)| ≥1/β2. The uniqueness of the extremal conﬁguration
Ka(Uz), a = 1/β2. leads to the uniqueness of the extremal function.
2
This theorem was earlier proved by A. Solynin in [135].
Considering the digon U \ {(−1, 0] ∪[r, 1)} with two vertices over 1 and
applying analogous observations we arrive at the following result.
Theorem 3.5.2. For all functions from S1(β) the sharp estimate K1/β2(r) ≤
|f(r)| < r holds with the extremal function K1/β2(z) for the left-hand side
inequality. The right-hand side inequality is sharp but never reachable.
The next theorem generalizes Theorem 3.5.1 for the case of the angular
derivatives at two points of ∂U.
Theorem 3.5.3. Let α1, α2 be positive numbers such that α1 + α2 = 1. Let
w = f(z) be a conformal map of the unit disk into itself, f(0) = 0, such that
for two points z1, z2 ∈∂U the angular limits w1 = f(z1) and w2 = f(z2) also
lie in ∂U. Suppose also that the angular derivatives f ′(z1), f ′(z2) are ﬁnite.

Corollary 3.5.1. Let w = f(z) be a conformal map of the unit disk into
itself, f(0) = 0, such that z1, z2 ∈∂U and z1 = f(z1), z2 = f(z2). Suppose
also that the angular derivatives f ′(z1), f ′(z2) are ﬁnite. The sharp inequality


|f ′(z1)f ′(z2)|
holds with the extremal function given by Theorem 3.5.3 with α1 = α2 = 1/2,
a = |f ′(0)|.
First we give some preliminary observations. Let U ′ = U \ {0}. On the
boundary ∂U of U we ﬁx two points ζ1 = eiθ1, ζ2 = eiθ2, 0 ≤θ1 < θ2 < 2π.
The next problem about the extremal partition we formulate as follows.
Set a non-zero weight vector (α1, α2) with non-negative coordinates. We con-
struct two intervals γ1 = (0, eiθ1) and γ2 = (0, eiθ2) in U ′. This is an ad-
missible system (γ1, γ2) of curves of type IV. Now we consider the pairs of
non-overlapping digons (D1, D2) on U ′ associated with the system of curves
(γ1, γ2) and the vector (α1, α2), where the digon Dj has its vertices at 0, eiθj,
j = 1, 2. We require the digons D1 and D2 to be conformal at their ver-
tices and to satisfy the condition of compatibility of angles and weights, i.e.,
ϕ(j)
0
=
2παj
α1+α2 is the inner angle of the digon Dj at the origin and ϕ(j)
ζj = π is
the inner angle of the digon Dj at the boundary point ζj, j = 1, 2. We also
require that the reduced moduli m(Dj, 0, ζj) exist.
Any collection of non-overlapping admissible digons associated with the
system of curves (γ1, γ2) and the vector (α1, α2) satisﬁes the following in-
equality
α2
1m(D1, 0, eiθ1) + α2

M1(α1, α2, 0, eiθ1, eiθ2) showing its dependence on parameters.
Each D∗

associated with the problem about the extremal partition. The factor A is
positive because of strip domains and the local trajectory structure close to
the origin (ϕ(z) = A
z2 (1 + . . . )). Here A, γ, and β are functions of α1, α2. For
D∗

The critical trajectories of ϕ(z)dz2 split U ′ into at most two strip domains
{D∗
j } associated with the admissible system (one of D∗
j can degenerate).
Lemma 3.5.1. Let α1, α1 ∈(0, ∞), 0 ≤θ1 < θ2 < 2π, θ2 −θ1 ≤π. Then,

eiβ and eiγ.
Proof. First we observe that the unit circle ∂U should be the trajectory of
the diﬀerential (3.37). Therefore, −ϕ(eiθ)e2iθdθ2 > 0 in regular points of ∂U.
This implies that β + γ = π + θ1 + θ2.
Since we can rotate the conﬁguration z →zei θ1+θ2
2
, without loss of gen-
erality, assume that θ2 ∈(0, π/2] and θ1 = −θ2.
The map g1(z) has the expansion g1 = zπ/ϕ(1)
0 (c1 + . . . ) about the origin.
Tending in (3.38) z →0 for j = 1, we obtain
α2

has the expansion g2 = zπ/ϕ(2)

Suppose j = 1. We take the square root in (3.38) and integrate it putting
the branch of the root so that g(0) = ∞and g(eiθ2) = 0. We normalize
the function g(z) so that the part of the the boundary of D∗
1 lying on the
unit circle is mapped into the real axis. Thus, after the normalization of the
imaginary constant in the logarithm and exponentiating we obtain

The reduced modulus of the digon H+ with respect to its vertices at 0 and
∞is equal to zero. Therefore, calculating the derivatives of the maps g1 and
g2 and making use the formulae on the change of the reduced moduli under
a conformal map, we obtain the values of the reduced moduli m(D∗
1, 0, eiθ1),
m(D∗
2, 0, eiθ2) asserted in Lemma 3.5.1. This ﬁnishes the proof.
2
Remark 3.5.1. The case θ2 −θ1 > π is analogous and the moduli in Lemma
3.5.1 are the same, interchanging γ ↔β.
Now we give the proof of Theorem 3.5.3 using the extremal partitions and
Lemma 3.5.1. We use the inequality (3.37) to derive the inequality (3.34).
Let f be an arbitrary map with the properties asserted in Theorem 3.5.3.
Without less of generality we again assume here that ζ1 = ζ2. Fix the positive
values of α1, α2. Let the pair of domains (D∗
1, D∗
2) be the extremal pair for
the minimum M(α1, α2, ζ1, ζ2) of the sum (3.37). Then, the pair of domains
(f(D∗
1), f(D∗
2)) is an admissible pair for the minimum M(α1, α2, w1, w2).
Therefore, the inequality
α2
1m(f(D∗
1), 0, w1) + α2
2m(f(D∗
2), 0, w2) ≥
(3.41)
≥α2
1m(B∗

2m(B∗
2, 0, w2),
holds where (B∗
1, B∗
2) is the extremal pair for the minimum M(α1, α2, w1, w2).
We deduce that
α2
1m(f(D∗
1), 0, w1) + α2
2m(f(D∗
2), 0, w2) =
(3.42)
= α2

Now we use Lemma 3.5.1 and calculate the moduli in (3.42) and (3.43).
Thus, normalizing α1 + α2 = 1, the inequalities (3.42) and (3.43) imply the
inequality (3.34) in the assertion of Theorem 3.5.3.

3.5 Univalent functions with the angular derivatives
125
Now we derive the extremal function w = f ∗(ζ) and the equation (3.35).
We examine the function g1(ζ) given by (3.39) that maps the domain D∗
1
onto the upper halfplane H+, and the function G1 that maps the domain B∗

onto H+. The function G1 satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation

G2(ζ) that maps the domain B∗

equation

The equation which we deduce for the superposition G−1

as for f ∗. Therefore, the function f ∗is deﬁned in the whole disk U as a
subordinating superposition, and maps the extremal conﬁguration (D∗
1, D∗
2)
onto the extremal conﬁguration (B∗
1, B∗
2). Thus, it gives the equality sign to
(3.42–3.43), and, therefore, also to (3.34).

3.5.2 The range of (|f(r)|, |f ′(0)|)
Now we consider the problem of ﬁnding the range of the system of functionals
(|f(r)|, |f ′(0)|)
in
the
class
S1(β)
corresponding
to
the
problem
on
max |f ′(0)| as |f(r)| ﬁxed.
Let S0 = C \ {0, a}, a > 0 be the twice-punctured Riemann sphere. We
consider on S0 the admissible system of curves (γ1, γ2) of types I and IV
respectively where γ1 = {w : |w| = 1/ε} and γ2 = {w : |w−a| = a}, so that ε
is suﬃciently small. Let D be the set of all pairs (D1, D2) of doubly connected
parabolic domains and digons associated with the admissible system (γ1, γ2)
and a weight-height vector (α1, α2) given. The digons are supposed to be
conformal at their vertices and the condition of the compatibility of weights
and angles is satisﬁed with the equal angles π at the vertices over 0 of all
digons D2 ∈D. Then, the problem of the extremal partition of S0 consists
of maximizing the sum α2
1m(D1, ∞) −α2
2m(D2, 0, 0) over all (D1, D2) ∈D.
Without loss of generality, we assume α1 = α, α2 = 1, α ∈[0, ∞), and the
maximum of this sum we denote by M(α, a). There is a unique pair (D∗
1, D∗
2)
which is extremal in this problem. D∗
1 is the circular domain and D∗

order 4 at the points π + 2πk which are the images of c under the map u(z).
Furthermore, u(0) = ±ηk, so that Re η0 = 0 in the case a < 1 or Re η0 = π
in the case a > 1, and
ηk = arccos 1 + a
1 −a, k = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . .
For deﬁniteness, assume now a < 1. Then, u(∞) = θk = arccos(1+c)/(1−c),
θ0 ∈(0, π), and θk and ηk are the poles of the second order. The points
u(a) = 2πk are regular for this diﬀerential.
Consider a ﬁxed branch of the function u(z) that maps C \ [c, a] onto
the strip 0 < Re u < π. The circular domain Du

the critical trajectory of Q(u)du2 starting and ending at π enclosing the real

2) is bounded by the same trajectory,
the imaginary axis, and the straight line Re u = π.
Let ζj(u), j = 1, 2 be conformal maps of the domains Du
j onto the unit
disk U and the digon C\[0, ∞) respectively, such that ζ1(θ0) = 0 and ζ2(η0) =
0, ζ2(−η0) = ∞. These functions satisfy in the domain Du

(3.49)
Letting z →∞in (3.48) in the case of j = 1 or z →0 in (3.49) in the
case of j = 2, we obtain A = α/4π2 and c = −a/α2.
Now we calculate the reduced modulus of the circular domain. The part
[θ0 + δ, π] of the orthogonal trajectory of the diﬀerential Q(u)du2 for a suf-
ﬁcient small δ has the preimage [−1/ε1, c] under the map u(z). From (3.44)
we derive
δ =

These two segments have the image [εeiβ, eiβ] in the ζ-plane. Without loss of
generality, assume β = 0.
Let z = f1(ζ) = A−1/ζ + A0 + A1ζ + . . . be a function from U onto

Then the modulus m(D∗

Next we calculate the reduced modulus of the digon D∗
2 with respect
to its two vertices with the same support 0. For this we consider the strip
domain Du
2 in the u-plane and the segment of the imaginary axis [0, η0 −iδ]
that belongs to the critical trajectory of the diﬀerential Q(u)du2. It has the
preimage [ε1, a] in the z-plane under the mapping u(z). We calculate from
(3.44) that
δ =
c −a
c√a(a −1)ε1 + O(ε2
1).
(3.52)
For these two segments there is an image in the ζ-plane [1, 1/ε] from the
boundary of the digon C \ [0, ∞) which is the image of the domain D∗
2 under
the map ζ2(u(z)). We ﬁnd that the lengths of the segments [ε, 1] and [1, 1/ε]
are equal in the metric |dζ|/|ζ| and, therefore, 1 = ζ2(0). Let z = f2(ζ) =
B−1/ζ + B0 + B1ζ + . . . be a conformal map from C \ [0, ∞) onto D∗
2. Then,
the reduced modulus of D∗
2 turns out to be m(D∗

this derivative is thought of as one of the angular derivatives in D∗

We deﬁne another problem of the extremal partition connected with the
previous one. Let S1 = C\{c1, 0, a1}, a1 > 0, c1 < 0, be the thrice-punctured
Riemann sphere. We consider on S1 the admissible system of curves (γ1, γ2)
of type I, IV respectively, where γ1 = {w : |w| = 1/ε} and γ2 = {w :
|w−a1| = a1}, so that and ε is suﬃciently small. Let B be the set of all pairs
(B1, B2) of doubly connected parabolic domains and digons associated with
the admissible system (γ1, γ2) and a weight-height vector (α1, α2) given. All
digons are supposed to be conformal at their vertices and the condition of
the compatibility of weights and angles is satisﬁed with the equal angles π at
the vertices over 0 of all digons B2 ∈B. Then, the problem of the extremal
partition of S1 consists of maximizing the sum α2
1m(B1, ∞) −α2
2m(B2, 0, 0)
over all (B1, B2) ∈D. Without loss of generality, we assume α1 = α, α2 =
1, α ∈[0, ∞), and the maximum of this sum we denote by M(α, c1, a1).
There is a unique pair (B∗
1, B∗
2) which is extremal in this problem. B∗

diﬀerential
ψ(z)dz2 = −A

z2(z −a1)(z −c1), A > 0, b ≤0.
(3.55)
Here A and b are functions on α. For α ∈[0,


reduced to the previous case (Theorem 3.5.4) with a = a1. If α →∞, then
B∗

2π log 4/(a1 −c1).

(c1 + 1) + (c1 −1) cos u,
and obtain the representation of the diﬀerential ψ in terms of the parameter

Now we study the trajectory structure of this quadratic diﬀerential which is
a complete square of a linear one. The diﬀerential Q(u)du2 has zeros of order
2 at the points ±γk + 2πk which are the images of
c1(a1 + 1) −b(c1 + 1)
c1(a1 −1) −b(c1 −1)
under the map u(z). Furthermore, u(0) = ±ηk, so that Re η0 = 0 in the case
a1 < 1, or Re η0 = π in the case a1 > 1, and
ηk = arccos 1 + a
1 −a, k = 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . .

3.5 Univalent functions with the angular derivatives
131
For deﬁniteness, assume now a1 < 1. The case a1 > 1 can be considered as in
Theorem 3.5.4. Then, u(∞) = θk = arccos(1 + c)/(1 −c), θ0 ∈(0, π), and θk
and ηk are the poles of the second order. The points u(a1) = 2πk are regular
for this diﬀerential.
We consider a ﬁxed branch of the function u(z) that maps C \ [c, a] onto
the strip 0 < Re u < π. The circular domain Du
1 = u(D∗
1) is bounded by
the critical trajectory of Q(u)du2 starting and ending at π enclosing the real
point θ0. The strip domain Du
2 = u(D∗
2) is bounded by the same trajectory,
the imaginary axis, and the straight line Re u = π.
Let ζj(u), j = 1, 2 be univalent conformal maps of the domains Bu
j onto
the unit disk U and the digon C \ [0, ∞) respectively, such that ζ1(θ0) = 0
and ζ2(η0) = 0, ζ2(−η0) = ∞. These functions satisfy in the domain Bu

case of j = 2, we obtain A = α/4π2 and b = −√−a1c1/α.

Now let Uz = U \ {0, r}, r ∈(0, 1) be the twice-punctured unit disk.
We consider on Uz an admissible system of curves (γz

associated with (γz

Now we consider the case 1−x

This completes the proof.

Now we need results about some properties of the monotonicity of the
modulus. Let U ′ = U \ {0, w}, |w| < 1 be the twice punctured unit disk. We
consider on U ′ an admissible system of curves (γ1, γ(n)
2

2
is from the countable set of arcs with certain homotopy on U ′,
with starting and ending points at 1, enclosing w such that γ1 ∩γ(n)
2

means of n = 1 we assume that γ(1)
2
is homotopic to the segment [1, w]. Here

ε < |w| and suﬃciently small. Let D(n) be the set of all pairs (D(n)
1 , D(n)

of doubly connected parabolic domains and digons in U ′ associated with
the admissible system (γ1, γ(n)
2
) and the vector (α, 1). Suppose that digons
have the inner angles π/2 at the vertices and are conformal there. Then,
the problem of the extremal partition of U ′ consists of maximizing the sum
α2m(D(n)

this sum we denote by M (n)
w (α, w).
Lemma 3.5.3. In the family D(n) the inequality
M (n)
w (α, w) ≤M (1)
w (α, w)
holds for all α and n = 2, 3, . . . .
Proof. Without loss of generality we assume Im w > 0. Now we are going
to apply the results about polarization of doubly connected domains. For
this we construct the pair of doubly connected domains (D1

one side starting from a, b respectively lying on its circular boundary within
the disk {|z−1| < ε} for a suﬃciently small ε. Denote by M(D′

there is a conformal univalent map f(z) from D onto the upper half-plane

3. MODULI FOR CONFORMAL MAPPING
Remark 3.5.2. 1) Since the class S1(β) is not compact, the point x(∞) = r
is not reachable and the limiting function f(z) ≡z as α →∞is not from
the class S1(β).
2) Theorem 3.5.6 gives the sharp lower estimate of |f(r)| over the class
S1(β) with |f ′(0)| ﬁxed, |f ′(0)| ∈[1/β2, 1].
Proof. We start the proof constructing the extremal maps. Let α ∈[ 1−r
2√r, α0].
Assume a1 = (1−r)2
r
, c1 = −4, a = (1−x(α))2
x(α)
. Then the diﬀerential equation
(3.68) is equivalent just to the equation ψ(Z)dZ2 = ϕ(W)dW 2 under the
transformations Z = (1−z)2
z
, W = (1−w)2
w
, where the diﬀerentials ϕ and ψ
are deﬁned in (3.43) and (3.55). Now we construct the functions f2(Z) and
F2(W) that map the domains B∗
2 and D∗
2 respectively onto the same strip
domain C \ [0, ∞). By (3.49) and (3.60), they satisfy the equations
d f2(Z)
f2(Z)
2
= 4π2ϕ(Z)dZ2,
d F2(W)
F2(W)
2
= 4π2ψ(W)dW 2.
Then we construct the map w = f ∗(z) ≡W −1 ◦F −1
2
◦f2 ◦Z(z) of the do-
main Dz

∗onto Dw
2
∗. This map can be continued analytically by the equation
(3.68) into Dz
1
∗through the analytic arc of the trajectory of the right-hand
side diﬀerential in (3.68) connecting d(α) and d(α). Calculating the deriva-
tives and taking into account Lemma 3.5.2, we deduce that |f ∗′(0)| = y(α),
|f ∗′(1)| = β, |f ∗(r)| = x(α). The same we do in the case α0 < α < ∞. In
this case

and we can obtain the explicit formula substituting α by Lemma 3.5.2.
Let f be an arbitrary map from the class S1(β). Then, two extremal
domains (Dz

∗, Dz
2
∗) in the problem about Mz(α, r) are mapped onto two
admissible domains (f(Dz

Since x(α) increases in α ∈[0, ∞) from x1 to r, and x1 =

f∈S1(β) |f(r)|, there
is α∗∈[0, ∞) such that x(α∗) = |f(r)|. Denote by ( ˜D(n)

pair of domains in the problem of M (n)
w (α, f(r)) and by ( ˜D1, ˜D2) the extremal
pair of domains in the problem of M (1)
w (α, f(r)). By Lemma 3.5.3, we have
M (n)
w (α, f(r)) ≤M (1)
w (α, f(r)). Now we apply circular symmetrization to the

3.5 Univalent functions with the angular derivatives
139
domains ( ˜D1, ˜D2) in the following way. Denote by ˜Dε
1 the doubly connected
domain ˜D1 \ {|w| ≤ε}. Now we construct the quadrilateral ˜Dε
2 ﬁxing two
arcs of the domain ˜D2 that start from the point 1 lying within the disk
|w −1| < ε. Then, we apply circular symmetrization in the usual way to the
doubly connected domain ˜Dε
1 with respect to the positive real axis, and to
the quadrilateral ˜Dε
2 with respect to the negative real axis (ﬁrst we have to
construct the symmetric image of ˜Dε
2 with respect to the unit circle and then
apply symmetrization to the doubly connected domain obtained). Denote by
(D∗
1, D∗
2) the result of this symmetrization as ε →0. Using Lemma 3.5.4,
adding necessary expressions dependent on ε, we derive
α2m( ˜D1, 0) −m( ˜D2, 1, 1) ≤α2m( ˜D∗
1, 0) −m( ˜D∗
2, 1, 1).
(3.71)
In its turn, the pair (D∗
1, D∗
2) is admissible in the problem about Mw(α, x(α)).
Therefore,
α2m( ˜D∗
1, 0) −m( ˜D∗
2, 1, 1) ≤Mw(α, x(α)).
(3.72)
Taking into account the equality

the chain of inequalities (3.71–3.72) leads to the inequality |f ′(0)| ≤y(α).
The uniqueness of the extremal function f ∗follows from the uniqueness of
the extremal conﬁguration for the maximum Mw(α, x(α)).

The boundary curve Γ −of the range of the system of the function-
als (|f(r)|, |f ′(0)|) in the class S1(β) that corresponds to the problem of
min |f ′(0)| with |f(r)| ﬁxed is still unknown. The results of this sections
were obtained in [168], [169]. The distortion theorems were obtained in [162].
It turns out that the minimum of |f ′(r)| in the class S1(β), 0 < r < 1, is given
by the canonical function for r close to the origin whereas another function
is extremal for r →1.
Recently, the hyperbolically convex univalent functions have received
much attention (see [95], [99], [167]). Distortion theorems as well as two-
point distortion are studied in [167] by the modulus method in this class of
univalent functions.

4. Moduli in Extremal Problems for
Quasiconformal Mapping
Classical results (P. P. Belinski˘ı [16], M. Schiﬀer, G. Schober [121], S. Krushkal
[71]) state that in various extremal problems a special form of extremal maps
(the Teichm¨uller maps) is used. These maps are given in terms of complex
dilatation of the inverse map. For maps close to the identity this leads to com-
plete solution of the problem. However, for the whole corresponding class of
quasiconformal maps the number of unknown parameters does not allow to
obtain an exact solution and gives only its qualitative characteristic, namely,
this extremal mapping is a Teichm¨uller map. So, a major problem in the
theory is this: to ﬁnd a description of the extremal maps in terms of dilata-
tion of the direct map with all parameters known. By the suggested modulus
method we will obtain the value regions for systems of functionals connected
with two-point distortion in basic compact classes of quasiconformal maps.
Each extremal function will be naturally unique for every boundary point of
the range in question.
4.1 General information and simple extremal problems
4.1.1 Quasiconformal mappings of Riemann surfaces
The starting point is quasiconformal mappings of planar domains. Let D be
a domain in C (possibly equal to C) and w = f(z) be a homeomorphism of
D onto a domain D′ ⊆C. We deﬁne Sobolev distributional derivatives as
f¯z := ∂f
∂¯z = 1

,
which are locally square integrable, on D, z = x + iy. A homeomorphism
f is said to be quasiconformal in D if the complex valued function μf(z) =
f¯z/fz satisﬁes the inequality |μf(z)| < 1 uniformly almost everywhere in
D. If ∥μf∥∞= ess sup
z∈D
|μf(z)| ≤k < 1, then the homeomorphism f is
said to be K-quasiconformal, K = (1 + k)/(1 −k). The function μf(z) is
called its complex characteristic or dilatation. A quasiconformal map is a
homeomorphic generalized solution of the Beltrami equation
w¯z = μf(z)wz.

4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
This solution is unique up to a conformal homeomorphism. A usual confor-
mal normalization (for instance, three boundary ﬁxed points for a simply
connected domain) implies the uniqueness of the solution to (4.1). The detail
description of properties of quasiconformal maps can be easily ﬁnd in [9], [16],
[43], [45], [71], [75]. Returning to the geometric deﬁnition of a quasiconformal
map one can consider the notion of the modulus of a family of curves as a
basis of the notion of quasiconformality. A sense preserving homeomorphism
f of a domain D onto a domain D′ is said to be a K-quasiconformal map if for
any doubly connected hyperbolic domain R ⊂D the ratio M(f(R))/M(R)
is bounded and the following inequality is satisﬁed
M(R)
K
≤M(f(R)) ≤KM(R),
(4.2)
where M(R) is the modulus of the family of curves that separate the bound-
ary components of R. The inequality (4.2) we call the property of quasi-
invariance of the modulus. A quasiconformal map is conformal if and only if
K = 1 (or k = 0).
We will consider basic compact classes of quasiconformal maps. They
are: QK– a class of all K-quasiconformal automorphisms of C normalized
as f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(∞) = ∞; UK– a class of all K-quasiconformal
automorphisms of U with the normalization f(0) = 0.
An important point to note here is the dependence of a quasiconformal
map on its dilatation. We let the dilatation μf(z, t) depend on z ∈U and
t be real or complex; μf(z, ·) be a measurable function with respect to z,
∥μf∥∞< 1. If μf is n-diﬀerentiable with respect to z and the n-th derivative
is H¨older continuous of order α ∈(0, 1), then a quasiconformal solution f μ ∈
UK to the equation (4.1) is (n+1)-diﬀerentiable and the (n+1)-th derivative
satisﬁes the same H¨older condition [16], n ≥1. Thus, one could expect that
f μ possesses a continuous derivative whenever μ is continuous. However, this
fails making use of the map f(z) = z(1 −log |z|), f(0) = 0, z ∈U, which
is even not Lipschitz continuous at z = 0. P. P. Belinski˘ı [16] proved that a
continuous μ produces a H¨older continuous f with any 0 < α < 1.
The dependence on the parameter t is much easier. If μ(·, t) is a diﬀeren-
tiable or continuous function with respect to t (for instance, holomorphic for
complex t), then the function f μ is also of the same quality.
Now we proceed with the deﬁnition of quasiconformality for Riemann
surfaces. Let S0 = U/G0 and ω be a quasiconformal automorphism of U. Let
mω be a dilatation of the map ω which is compatible with the Fuchsian group
G0, that is,
mω(γ(z))γ′(z)
γ′(z) = mω(z), for γ ∈G0.
We construct a Fuchsian group by the rule G = ω ◦G0 ◦ω−1. Then, the
Riemann surface S = U/G induces the following commutative diagram where
f = J ◦ω ◦J−1
0
is a quasiconformal homeomorphism of S0 onto S and J, J0

are automorphic projections. The map f has the dilatation
μf(ζ) = mω(J−1
0 (ζ))(J−1
0 (ζ))′
(J−1
0 (ζ))′ ,
in terms of a local parameter ζ. The groups G0 and G are the groups of
automorphisms for the functions J0, J respectively. A homeomorphism f
induces an isomorphism χf of the Fuchsian groups G0 →G. Dilatations mω
form the unit ball D(G0) of the Beltrami diﬀerentials in the whole space of
the Beltrami diﬀerentials B(G0) of ﬁnite norm ∥·∥∞which are invariant with
respect to the actions from G0.
The Teichm¨uller maps are of particular importance in the theory of qua-
siconformal mapping. They are the Sobolev generalized K-quasiconformal
homeomorphic solutions to the Beltrami equation (4.1) with the complex
dilatation
μf(ζ) = k ϕ(ζ)
|ϕ(ζ)|, k = K −1
K + 1,
(4.3)
where ϕ(ζ)dζ2 is a holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential on S0. The inverse
map is also Teichm¨uller’s, i.e., there exists a holomorphic quadratic dif-
ferential ψ(w)dw2 on f(S0), such that the inverse map has the dilatation
μf −1(w) = kψ(w)/|ψ(w)|. Teichm¨uller maps are locally aﬃne and map in-
ﬁnitesimal circles onto inﬁnitesimal ellipses having their big semi-axes along
or orthogonal to a trajectory of the diﬀerential ψ(w)dw2. The ratio of the
big and small axes of ellipses is K for any point of S0 diﬀerent from the
singularities of ϕ.
We denote by K(f) a maximal deviation of a quasiconformal map f from
conformality, i.e., K(f) = (1 + ∥μf∥∞)/(1 −∥μf∥∞). Let (S, f) be a marked
(with respect to S0) Riemann surface, where f is a homeomorphism S0 →S.
The homeomorphism f is thought of as a representative of the homotopy
class of homeomorphisms of S0 onto S. A homeomorphism g : S →S′ induces
a homeomorphism of the marked Riemann surface (S, f) onto (S′, f ′) where
f ′ = g◦f. Let (S, f) and (S′, f ′) be equally oriented marked Riemann surfaces
of type (g, n, l) (the orientation and type of marked Riemann surfaces are
generated by those of Riemann surfaces). It is known [18] that there are
quasiconformal maps among all homotopic homeomorphisms of (S, f) onto
(S′, f ′).
A fundamental result in the theory of quasiconformal mapping was for-
mulated by O. Teichm¨uller [150] and rigorously proved by L. Ahlfors, L. Bers
[11], and by another method by S. Krushkal [71]. In the homotopy class of

144
4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
homeomorphisms of (S, f) onto (S′, f ′) there is a unique Teichm¨uller map
which is either conformal (k(f) = 0) or there are such k and a quadratic
diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2, that the complex dilatation of this map is of the form
(4.3). In particular, two diﬀerent Teichm¨uller maps are never homotopic to
each other.
Another result that invokes Teichm¨uller maps is concerned with extremal
problems for compact classes of quasiconformal maps. Let us formulate the
so-called interpolation Schur-Pick-Nevanlinna problem. Let A be a class of
maps of a domain D into C. Let z1, . . . , zn be punctures of D, w1, . . . , wn be
punctures of C and w1
1, . . . , wi1
1 , . . . , w1
2, . . . , wi2
2 , . . . , w1
n, . . . , win
n be complex
numbers. The problem consists of construction of a map from the class A,
such that it admits the values wj, j = 1, . . . , n at the points zj and at
the points of diﬀerentiability f (kj)(zj) = wkj
j
(the map is supposed to be
complex diﬀerentiable at zj if ij ≥1). Let F(f) be a functional (or a system
of functionals) dependent on the values of a function and its derivatives at
the points zj. Then, ﬁnding the extremum of this functional (or the range of
a system of functionals) is equivalent to the necessary condition of solvability
of the above interpolation problem.
Among such problems we indicate the Bieberbach problem on estimation
of the Taylor coeﬃcients of a univalent conformal map, a mutual behaviour
of the value of a univalent function and the value of its derivative at a certain
point of the set of deﬁnition, Gronwall’s problems in the conformal case.
In the quasiconformal case, however, one ﬁnds only few completely resolved
problems such as, for instance, description of the range of f(ζ) for the maps
from QK, the Mori theorem, and some others. In fact, there is known only a
qualitative description of the inverse maps to the extremal ones by variational
methods [15], [16], [71], and optimal control methods [26].
We show such a result for one concrete problem. We consider the compact
class QK of quasiconformal automorphisms of the complex plane and denote
by F(w1, . . . , wn−3) a holomorphic function on Cn−3. The maximum
max
f∈QK Re F(f(z1), . . . , f(zn−3))
is to be found for z1, . . . , zn−3 ﬁxed and diﬀerent from 0,1. It is known [15],
[16], [71] that the extremal map is Teichm¨uller’s and the inverse map satisﬁes
the Beltrami equation z ¯
w = μf −1(w)zw with the dilatation
μf −1(w) = keit ψ(w)

∂F
∂wj
wj(wj −1)
w(w −1)(w −wj), for w = f ∗(z), wj = f ∗(zj).
This Beltrami coeﬃcient contains a lot of unknown parameters, thus, the
extremal problem can be solved only qualitatively. Therefore, our main eﬀort

4.1 General information and simple extremal problems
145
aims at elaboration of a method of ﬁnding representation of extremal maps
by the dilatation of the direct map.
Among particular cases of this functional we consider two-point distortion
under quasiconformal maps from QK. This can be reduced to estimation of
functionals dependent on two ﬁxed points from S0. There are only few results
devoted to such estimation. In the case of the class QK there is a result by
S. Krushkal [4]. He obtained that there is such K0 > 1 that for all f ∈QK,
1 ≤K ≤K0, and for ﬁxed points z1, z2 ∈C\{0, 1}, z1 +z2 = 1, the extremal
map for the functional max
f∈QK |f(z1) −f(z2)| is the Teichm¨uller map with the
dilatation
μf(z) = keit ϕ(z)
|ϕ(z)|, k = K −1
K + 1,
where ϕ(z) = z1z2[z(1 −z)(z −z1)(z −z2)]−1.
This chapter deals with the application of the modulus method to this
extremal problem in the classes QK, UK. We evaluate the range of the system
of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) for ﬁxed real values r1 and r2. From these
general results we deduce some sharp estimates of functionals.
4.1.2 Growth and H¨older continuity
We start with two well-known results applying the modulus method. The
ﬁrst one is about estimation of growth of the quasiconformal automorphisms
of the unit disk U.
Theorem 4.1.1 (Belinski˘ı [15], [16], Hersch, Pﬂuger [59]). Let f be a K-
quasiconformal homeomorphism of the unit disk with the motionless point 0,
say from the class UK. Then,
Φ−1(KΦ(|z|)) ≤|f(z)| ≤Φ−1( 1
K Φ(|z|)),
where Φ(t) = K ′(t)/2K (t), 0 ≤t < 1.
The equality sign in the right-hand side inequality is attained for the func-
tion that realizes an aﬃne map along the trajectories of the quadratic diﬀer-
ential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 = [ζ(z−ζ)(1−ζ¯z)]−1dζ2 (aﬃne in terms of the local parameter
w =
 
ϕ(ζ)dζ). The same assertion can be made for the equality sign in
the left-hand side equality for the diﬀerential (−ϕ(ζ)dζ2).
Remark 4.1.1. We have to clear up the notation Φ we have used. The stan-
dard notation (see [91]) for the relation
μ(t) = π
2 · K ′(t)
K (t)
contradicts the standard notation for the complex dilatation, so it seems to
be more convenient to change it here. Denote by pK(t) := Φ−1( 1
K Φ(t)). For
this quantity the useful estimate (pK(t))2 ≤161−1
K · t
1
K can be found in e.g.
[6].

4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
Now we proceed with the proof of Theorem 4.1.1.
Proof. We suppose the contrary. Denote by ρ0 = pK(|z|) Let f be a function
from the class UK with |f(z)| ≥ρ0. The doubly connected domain Dz =
U \ [z, ei arg z) has the modulus
M(Dz) = 1
2Φ(|z|).
Let D∗be a result of circular symmetrization of the domain f(Dz) with
respect to the origin and the positive real axis. Then, M(f(Dz)) ≤M(Dz).
For a quasiconformal map from UK the inequality M(f(Dz)) ≥
1
K M(Dz)
holds. The unique extremal map is the Teichm¨uller map that realizes an
aﬃne mapping along the trajectories of the quadratic diﬀerential
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 =
dζ2
ζ(z −ζ)(1 −ζ¯z).
Moreover, D∗⊂{U \[0, ρ0]}, and, hence, M(D∗) ≥1
2Φ(ρ0). The whole chain
of these inequalities is valid only in the case ρ0 = |f(z)|. The uniqueness of
the extremal conﬁguration and the uniqueness of the extremal Teichm¨uller
map imply the uniqueness of the extremal map in the theorem up to rotation.
The left-hand side inequality can be obtained starting with the quadrilat-
eral U ′
z = U \ {(−1, 0] ∪[r, 1)}, where r = |z|. Symmetrization of the domain
f(U ′
z) yields the inequality
K (r)
KK ′(r) ≤K (|f(z)|)
K ′(|f(z)|)
which is equivalent to the inequality in Theorem 4.1.1.
2
The next theorem deals with the boundary tension under a quasiconformal
map and can be proved similarly using the Mori domain (see Section 2.4)
C \ {[0, −∞) ∪{eiθ, −α/2 ≤θ ≤α/2}}.
Theorem 4.1.2 (Belinski˘ı [16]). Let f be a K-quasiconformal homeomor-
phism of the unit disk with the motionless point 0 and let an arc of the unit
circle of length α be mapped onto an arc of the unit circle of length β. Then,
β ≤4 arcsin[pK(sin α
4 )].
The extremal function exists, is unique, and realizes an aﬃne map along
the trajectories of the quadratic diﬀerential with simple poles at 0 and at the
limiting endpoints of the arc α.
Now we brieﬂy sketch some other results about the deviation of a point
under a quasiconformal map to complete this subsection. Their proofs do not
use the modulus method and exceed the scope of our book.

P. P. Belinski˘ı [16] has proved the sharp estimate
|f(z) −z| ≤λ−1( 1
K λ(|z|)) −|z|,
where λ(t) = 2Φ(

t/(t + 1)), for the functions from UK.
The absolute constant for the preceding estimate was obtained by the
parametric method by Shah Dao-Sing [126]. Let f ∈UK. Then, the sharp
estimate
|f(z) −z| ≤Γ 4(1/4)

log K,
holds where Γ(·) is the Euler gamma-function.
We also indicate here an asymptotic estimate by P. P. Belinski˘ı [16]. Let

holds.
One can ﬁnd analogous results for quasiconformal homeomorphisms of
the complex plane in [16], [126], [91].
We mention here some results obtained by the modulus method that are
covered in [9]. We ask the reader to look through the proofs there. One of
them deals with the H¨older continuity. A classical result is the Mori theorem.
Theorem 4.1.3 (Mori [102]). Let f ∈UK. Then, for any z1, z2 ∈U the
following unimprovable inequality is valid
|f(z1) −f(z2)| ≤16|z1 −z2|1/K.
One can ﬁnd the proof by the modulus method in [9].
A topical problem is to replace the absolute constant 16 by a relative
constant dependent on K. This means to ﬁnd
M(K) = sup{|f(z1) −f(z2)|
|z1 −z2|1/K
; f ∈UK; z1, z2 ∈U}.
Obviously, sup
K≥1
M(K) = 16. O. Lehto, K. Virtanen conjectured ([91], page
68) that M(K) = 161−1/K. Another problem is to establish an analog of the
Mori theorem for the lower estimate of |f(z1) −f(z2)|. P. P. Belinski˘ı [16]
obtained the inequality
|f(z1) −f(z2)| >
z1 −z2

K.
Establishing reﬁned estimates of M(K) attracted attention of various spe-
cialists.

Theorem 4.1.4 (Wang Chuang-Fang [175]). Let f ∈UK. Then, the follow-
ing unimprovable inequalities
41−K|z|K ≤|f(z)| ≤41−1/K|z|1/K
hold.
This estimate is also found in works by P. P. Belinski˘ı [16], O. Lehto,
K. Virtanen [91] and in recent papers by V. Semenov [122], [123] as an appli-
cation of the method of quasiconformal ﬂows. He also obtained the following
sharp estimate 1 −|f(z)|2 ≤161−1/K(1 −|z|2)1/K.
Theorem 4.1.5 (Semenov [122]). 161−1/K ≤M(K) ≤1241−1/K.
4.1.3 Quasiconformal motion of a quadruple of points
Here we apply the modulus method to establishing geometric properties of
the solution of the Teichm¨uller problem on the minimum of deviation of a
quasiconformal image of a quadruple of punctures on the Riemann sphere.
Let S0 = C \ {0, 1, r} and S = C \ {0, 1, w0} where r > 1, w0 ∈C \ {0, 1}.
Let us map S →C by the integral
J(w) =
w

dw

w(w −1)(w −w0)
,
ﬁxing a branch of the root. Denote by ω′
1, ω′
2 the periods of the function J−1
such that ω′
1 > 0, Im ω′
2 > 0. In the case S = S0 the analogous integral J0(z)
maps this surface onto the plane of the periods ω1, ω2 (see Section 2.3), where
ω1 = 2K

r −1


, ω1 = iK ′

r −1

.
Denote by w = f(ζ) a quasiconformal homeomorphism of S0 onto S that,
being extended onto S0 = C, keeps the points 0, 1, ∞motionless. Then, the
function J ◦f ◦J−1
0
maps the rectangular lattice of periods ω1, ω2 onto the
parallelogram lattice of periods ω′
1, ω′
2. Let Cz = C \ {nω1 + mω2; n, m, ∈Z}
and Cw = C \ {nω′
1 + mω′
2; n, m, ∈Z}. We consider the countable set of
homotopy classes Hj of quasiconformal homeomorphisms f : S0 →S; H =
∪Hj. The index j = 1 refers to the class of homeomorphisms homotopic to
J−1 ◦g ◦J0, where g is an aﬃne map of the lattice of periods on Cz onto
the lattice of periods on Cw. The Teichm¨uller problem for a homotopy class
of mappings consists of ﬁnding the inﬁmum of the deviation K(f) over all
maps from this homotopy class.
We formulate a problem connected with the Teichm¨uller problem and
the motion of a quadruple of points. Namely, for which K there is a K-
quasiconformal map of S0 onto S? This problem was solved by L. Ahlfors by
the extremal length method.

4.1 General information and simple extremal problems
149
Theorem 4.1.6 (Ahlfors [9]). If 1
2 log K ≥ρ(r, w0), then there exists a K-
quasiconformal map of S0 onto S which is motionless in the punctures 0, 1, ∞.
Here ρ(·, ·) is the non-Euclidean metric in C⧹{0, 1}. The equality sign is
attained only for the K-quasiconformal Teichm¨uller map from H ∩QK.
For the proof we again refer to [9].
Generalizations of this theorem were made by S. Krushkal [75]. Now we
consider a countable set of homotopy classes Γ ′
j of simple loops that separate
the points 0,1 from w0, ∞. The index j = 1 refers to the class of loops
homotopic on S to the slit along the segment [0, 1]. We denote by m(Γ ′
1) ≡
m(w0) the corresponding modulus. Let Γ1 := Γ ′
1 in the case w0 = r. We
deﬁne a curve on S by the equation l(R) = {w : m(w)
m(r) = R}. The shape of
this curve was shown in Section 3.4.1 (or see [78], Corollary 5.3), l(1) contains
the point r. We consider the homotopy classes H of maps S0 onto S. The
following result was obtained in [151].
Theorem 4.1.7. If the point w0 is located to the left from the counter clock-
wise direction of l(1), then the extremum in the Teichm¨uller problem is at-
tained for the homotopy class H1, i.e.,
min
f∈H1 K(f) = min
f∈H K(f) < min
f∈Hj K(f), j ̸= 1.
Proof. Let us consider on S the family of simple loops γ ∈Γ ′
1, that separate
the punctures 0,1 from w0, ∞. This family is transformed by the mapping
J(w) to the family of curves connecting on Cw the points u′ and u′+ω′
1 which
are homotopic on Cw to the segment [u′, u′ +ω′
1]. The modulus of this family
is equal to Im τ ′
2 , where τ ′ = ω′
2
ω′
1 . The extremal metric is Euclidean. Consider
two neighboring parallelograms of periods on Cw, pasted along a sloping side
with identiﬁcation of other sloping sides. We map the conﬁguration obtained
by the Weierstrass function ℘(u′ ω′
1, ω′
2). As a result, we obtain a doubly
connected domain Ω which is admissible for the extremal partition of the
Riemann surface S among the domains of the ﬁrst type, associated with the
homotopy class Γ ′
1. Thus, m(w0) = M(Ω) = m(Γ ′
1) ≥Im τ ′
2 .
We make use of transformations s(τ ′) which are automorphisms of the
upper half-plane Im τ ′ > 0, and which are the covering transformations for
the surface S. There is a one-to-one correspondence [9] between the homo-
topy classes of maps Hj and the automorphisms s(τ ′). The solution of the
Teichm¨uller problem about the minimum of deviation in a homotopy class of
maps is given by the formula
min
f∈Hj K(f) = exp(2d(τ, s(τ ′)),
where d(·, ·) is the hyperbolic Poincar´e distance in the upper half-plane, and
τ = ω1
ω2 . For the transformations s(τ ′) the inequality Im s(τ ′) ≤Im τ ′ holds

150
4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
and the equality sign is attained only for the identity. Obviously, for the sur-
face S0 we have m(r) = Φ(1/√r). In this case Im τ/2 = m(r). The condition
of the theorem that the point w0 lies on S left to the counter clock-wise di-
rection of the curve l(1) implies that the modulus m(w0) increases to m(r)
when we delete the part of the critical trajectory of the extremal quadratic
diﬀerential for m(w0) up to the intersection with l(1) leaving its connected
part with the inﬁnite endpoint. Thus, the inequality m(r) > m(w0) holds.
We have the inequality Im τ ≥Im τ ′ ≥Im s(τ ′). The map (ζ −τ)(ζ −¯τ)−1
geometrically shows the inequality d(τ, s(τ ′)) ≥d(τ, τ ′) with the equality sign
only for the identity. Thus,
min
j
min
f∈Hj K(f) = exp(2d(τ, τ ′)) = min
f∈H1 K(f).
This completes the proof.
2
The class of homeomorphisms QK is deﬁned and QK ⊂H if K(f) < K
for f ∈H. Obviously,
min
f∈QK m(f(Γ1)) = 1
K Φ(1/√r), max
f∈QK m(f(Γ1)) = KΦ(1/√r).
The equality sign is attained for the function f1, f2 respectively satisfying
the Beltrami equation with the dilatation
μf(z) = ±k ϕ(ζ)
|ϕ(ζ)|, ϕ(ζ) =
1
ζ(ζ −1)(ζ −r).
These functions belong to the class H1.
Denote by T(K) the set of all points w0 such that min
f∈H K(f) = K, and
by T1(K) the set of all points w0 such that min
f∈H1 K(f) = K.
Proposition 4.1.1. The set T(K) is the boundary of the range of f(r) in
the class QK. It is the boundary of the non-Euclidean disk E in C⧹{0, 1}
centered in r with the non-Euclidean radius 1
2 log K.
Proof. In fact, all homeomorphisms giving the points of T(K) belong to QK,
and T(K) ⊂E. Let there be a point w0 = f0(r) in T(K), w0 ̸∈∂E. Then,
there is K1 < K such that the range of f(r) in the class QK1 is the non-
Euclidean disk E1 ⊂E, and w0 ∈∂E1. The boundary points of E are given
by the functions with K(f) = K. Hence, K(f0) < K and this contradicts the
deﬁnition of T(K). Now we prove that there is no point in ∂E which is not
from T(K). Indeed, if there were such functions f giving such points, then
K(f) > K, and the functions would not be from the class QK. This ends the
proof.

4.2 Two-point distortion for quasiconformal maps of the plane
151
Theorem 4.1.8. The curve T1(K) has homotopy with respect to K to the
point T1(1) = r, it is located between the curves l(K) and l(1/K). T1(K) has
a unique common point with l(K) in the real axis to the right from r. T1(K)
and T(K) have a unique common point with l(1/K) in the real axis between
1 and r.
Proof. a) T1(K) and l(K) are intersected at a unique point. Indeed, let there
be at least two points w1 and w2 of the intersection. But max
f∈QK m(f(Γ1)) =
Km(r) and there exist two functions such that f1(r) = w1 ∈T1(K), f2(r) =
w2 ∈T1(K), f1, f2 ∈H1, and, therefore, f1, f2 ∈QK. At the same time
w1, w2 ∈l(K) and m(w1) = m(w2) = Km(r) that contradicts the uniqueness
of the extremal map with respect to the modulus.
b) Now we prove that Im (T1(K) ∩l(K)) = 0. The extremal map (for the
modulus m(w0)) belongs to the class H1, and transforms the point r into the
point w0 that lies on the real axis and l(K). At the same time, if it were not
a point from T1(K), then there would be such K1 < K that w0 ∈T1(K1),
and T1(K1) ⊂int T1(K). Then, T1(K) would have more than one point of
intersection with l(K). This contradicts (a).
Analogously one can prove the assertion of the theorem for the point of
intersection of T1(K) with l(1/K). Theorem 4.1.7 yields the conclusion about
T1(K).

Beltrami equation (4.1) with the Beltrami coeﬃcient (4.3) where

Theorem 4.2.2. (i) The unique map f ∗gives the absolute maximum of

4.2.1 Special diﬀerentials and extremal partitions
Suppose 1 < r1 < r2. We consider some special modulus problems and ex-
tremal partitions generated by certain quadratic diﬀerentials. Set P(z) =
z(z −1)(z −r1)(z −r2). Let us consider the following one-parametric families
of holomorphic quadratic diﬀerentials on S0 = C \ {0, 1, r1, r2}.
ϕ1(z)dz2 = A1(α)(z −c1(α))P −1(z)dz2,

From (4.4–4.6) one can learn the dynamics of zeros and trajectories with
respect to the parameter α. The values α0, . . . , α4 of the parameter α corre-
spond to degeneracy of D∗
1 or D∗
2 in the trajectory structure of the diﬀerentials
(4.4–4.6). The diﬀerentials are of ﬁnite L1-norm and have ﬁnite trajectories.
For each of them one can deﬁne the modulus where the corresponding diﬀer-
ential is extremal. This means that the admissible system of curves consists
at most of two non-homotopic non-critical trajectories of the diﬀerential with
the weight vector (1, α).
4.2.2 Quasisymmetric functions and the extremal maps
Let f(x) be a continuous strictly increasing function with respect to a real
x deﬁned in the axis R. This function is said to be quasisymmetric on R if
there exists a positive constant M such that
1
M ≤f(x + t) −f(x)
f(x) −f(x −t) ≤M
for any real t > 0. A ﬁnite real function f is quasisymmetric on the real axis
if and only if there exists a quasiconformal continuation of this function onto

4.2 Two-point distortion for quasiconformal maps of the plane
155
the upper (or, which is the same, lower) half-plane (see e.g. [91] Section 7).
We consider the compact class of all quasisymmetric functions that admit K-
quasiconformal continuation normalized by f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1. For us it will
be convenient to consider functions extended into the upper half-plane H+.
We denote such class of extended normalized maps by HK. Then, we extend
them onto the whole complex plane by the rule f(¯z) = f(z). So, the class HK
is supposed to be a subclass of QK. First, we will solve the extremal problem
on the range of the system of functionals I(f) = (f(r1), f(r2)), 1 < r1 < r2,
in the class HK.
We construct the Teichm¨uller maps fj deﬁned in the upper half-plane H+
satisfying the Beltrami equation (4.1) with the complex dilatation
μfj(ζ) = k ϕj(ζ)
|ϕj(ζ)|, k = K −1
K + 1, j = 1, 2, 3,
keeping the points z = 0, 1, ∞motionless. These maps can be extended
into the whole plane C by the rule f(¯z) = f(z). We can do this because
the Beltrami coeﬃcients are symmetric. Then, the maps become extremal
with respect to the following modulus problems. Let us consider the dif-
ferential ϕ1(z)dz2, α ∈(α0, α1) and its two non-homotopic in S0 trajecto-
ries as an admissible system of curves γ = {γ1, γ2} on S0. One may de-
ﬁne the problem of the extremal partition for this system and the vector
(1, α), α ∈[α0, α1]. Let m = m(S, Γ, α) be the modulus in this problem.
For f which is an arbitrary quasiconformal homeomorphism from HK we
deﬁne the modulus mf = m(f(S), f(Γ), α). The Teichm¨uller map f1 is the
unique extremal homeomorphism in the problem of min
f∈HK mf. More in de-
tails, mf ≥m/K ≡m(S, Γ, α)/K and the extremal mapping exists. Con-
sider the map f1. In the trajectory structure of ϕ1(z)dz2 there are two ring
domains D1 and D2. The domain D1 is bounded by the segment [0, 1], the
ray [c1, ∞), and the connected arc δ of the critical trajectory starting and
ending at c1, D2 is bounded by the segment [r1, r2] and the arc δ. The Te-
ichm¨uller homeomorphism f1 maps D1 and D2 onto a couple of ring do-
mains in the trajectory structure of a quadratic diﬀerential ψ(w)dw2 on C
with singularities relevant to those of ϕ1(z)dz2. Let us introduce the local
parameters ζ = exp(
z 
ϕ1(z)dz) and ζ′ = exp(
w 
ψ(w)dw). In each do-
main Dj the map f1, being considered in C, acts aﬃnely in these coordi-
nates ζ′ = ζ + k¯ζ. The ratio α ∈[α0, α1] of the length of trajectories re-
mains the same for ϕ1 and for ψ, therefore, the normalization of ψ implies
mf1 = M(f1(R1))+α2M(f1(R2)) = m/K. The uniqueness follows from [63].
The same statements one can deduce for the diﬀerentials ϕj and the maps
fj for j = 2, 3.
Proposition 4.2.1. The unique map f1

α=α0
gives the absolute minimum
and f3

α=1 gives the absolute maximum to f(r1) in the class HK.

4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
Proof. The result is not diﬃcult but we give the proof for the completeness
and to show the general approach to the problem in question. We prove
Proposition 4.2.1 for f3. If α = 1, then c3(1) = r1 and the admissible system
of curves consists of a curve γ1 that separates the points 1, r1 from 0 and ∞
which is homotopic on S0 to the slit along the segment [1, r1]. We suppose the
contrary. Let there be a map f ∈HK such that f ̸= f3 for α = 1 and f(r1) ≥
f3(r1)

α=1. Then, mf > m/K. The maps from HK are homeomorphic on R,
therefore, f(γ1) is homotopic on C\{0, 1, f(r1)} to the slit along the segment
[1, f(r1)]. We have
m/K ≤M(C \ {(−∞, 0] ∪[1, f(r1)]} = mf
≤M(C \ {(−∞, 0] ∪[1, f3(r1)

α=1]} = m/K.
This chain of inequalities is valid only for f ≡f3

α=1. This contradiction
proves Proposition 4.2.1. For the map f1

α=α0
the proof is similar.

Proposition 4.2.2. For any real c with

α=α0 ≤c ≤f3(r1)

α=1 = max
f∈HK f(r1)
there are such j and ˜α that fj(r1)

α=˜α = c.
Proof. Theorems 2.7.1, 2.7.2 imply that the diﬀerentials ϕ1, . . . , ϕ3 continu-
ously depend on α and, hence, the same for f1, . . . , f3. Moreover, f1

α=α4 that implies the assertion of Proposition 4.2.2.

Theorem 4.2.3. For any f ∈HK there are a unique ˜α and j = 1, . . . , 3
such that with f(r1) = fj(r1)

α=˜α = c the inequality f(r2) ≤fj(r2)

α=˜α
holds. The equality is attained only for f = fj

α=˜α.
Proof. By Proposition 4.2.2 we choose j and ˜α, such that f(r1) = fj(r1)

α=˜α =
c for a function f ∈HK. Assume, for instance, j = 3, ˜α ∈[α4, 1]. Then, we
can generate the problem of the extremal partition on S0 by the diﬀeren-
tial ϕ3(z)dz2 with the modulus m = m(S, Γ, ˜α) for the admissible system
of curves γ = (γ1, γ2) so that γ2 is freely homotopic on S0 to the slit along
[1, r1]. Now we assume the contrary. Let f ∈HK and suppose that with f3
as above f(r2) ≥f3(r2)

α=˜α but that f(z) is not identical with f3. We deﬁne
the problem of the extremal partition in S′ = C \ {0, 1, f(r1), f(r2)} for the
admissible system γ′ of two curves (γ′
1, γ′
2) and the vector (1, ˜α). A simple

loop γ′
1 separates the points ∞, 0 from 1, f(r1), f(r2), and is homotopic on
S′ to the slit along [−∞, 0]. The curve γ′
2 separates the points ∞, 0, f(r2)
from 1, f(r1) and is homotopic on S′ to the slit along [1, f(r1)]. Since the do-
mains f(D1), f(D2) are admissible, associated with the system (γ′
1, γ′
2) the
following chain of inequalities is valid
1
K m < M(f(D1)) + ˜α2M(f(D2)) ≤m(S′, Γ ′, ˜α).
(4.7)
The strict inequality sign results from the uniqueness of f3 in the extremal
problem of min mf. The extremal quadratic diﬀerential in the latter problem
of the extremal partition is
ψ(w)dw2 = A′
w −c′
w(w −1)(w −f(r1))(w −f(r2))dw2,
where the constants A′ < 0, c′ ∈[f(r1), f(r2)] are deﬁned by the equations

ψ(x)dx = α

Since the critical trajectory of the diﬀerential ψ starting from f(r2) has the
negative direction, the corresponding modulus increases in so far as we move
the point f(r2) in this direction. Taking into account the extremal properties
of f3(z) with respect to the problem of the extremal partition, we have the
inequality m(S′, γ′, ˜α) ≤mf3 = m/K. This contradicts to (4.7) and ends the
proof of the inequality in Theorem 4.2.3. The cases j = 1, 2 can be considered
analogously.
Now we can prove the uniqueness of the choice of ˜α and j = 1, . . . , 3. For
this we assume that there are two diﬀerent pairs of these parameters that
lead us to the same point of the boundary of the range of I(f). One of these
pairs we choose as a basic pair for the Teichm¨uller map (analog of f3) and
the Teichm¨uller map deﬁned by the other one we denote by f. Then, we can
repeat the preceding proof and arrive at the same contradiction. This ends
the whole proof.

4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
Theorem 4.2.4. Let f ∈HK. Then, the upper boundary curve for the range
of the functional I(f) = (f(r1), f(r2)), 1 < r1 < r2, i.e., the curve of
max
f∈HK f(r2) for f(r1) ﬁxed, is assigned parameterically by (w1(t), w2(t)), t ∈
[0, 1]. This curve is smooth and, being considered in the plane (w1, w2) ∈R2,
increases in t ∈[0, 2/3] and decreases in t ∈[2/3, 1]. The normal vector
to this curve at the point t = 2/3 is vertical and at the points t = 0, 1 is
horizontal.
Proof. By (4.4-4.6), the functions Aj(α) and cj(α) for j = 1, 2, 3 are diﬀer-
entiable with respect to α in the corresponding intervals, so the same for
ϕj, fj. Therefore, the functions w1(t), w2(t) are piecewise diﬀerentiable and
they have left-side and right-side derivatives at the points 1/3, 2/3. We con-
sider the interval (2/3, 1). We have in this interval the equality mf3 ≡m/K
where the modulus m is deﬁned by the extremal diﬀerential ϕ3. Theorem
2.7.2 states that
dm
dα = 2αM(D2); ∂mf3
∂α
= 2αM(f3(D2)); ∂mf3
∂wk
= πRes w=wkψ(w).
Each of wk is a simple pole of the extremal diﬀerential ψ. By this we come
to the equality
∂mf3
∂α
+ ∂mf3
∂w1
dw1
dα + ∂mf3
∂w2

dα = 1

The map f3 is extremal for the problem of the extremal partition with the
modulus mf so it maps the extremal conﬁguration in the trajectory struc-
ture of the diﬀerential ϕ3 onto the extremal conﬁguration in the trajectory
structure of the diﬀerential ψ. Therefore,
∂mf3
∂α
= 1
K

dα .
The direct diﬀerentiation leads us to the derivative dw2/dw1 which exists and
is negative in all points of (2/3,1). Moreover, dw2/dw1 →0 as t →2/3 + 0
and dw2/dw1 →−∞as t →1 −0. By the analogy with the above, we prove
the cases j = 1, 2. This ends the proof.

The lower boundary is obtained in the same way. We omit the awkward
statements of these results because one can learn them by Theorems 4.2.3,
4.2.4. Here we present the quadratic diﬀerentials that lead us to the extremal
functions for the lower boundary.

Theorems 4.2.3, 4.2.4 deﬁne the range of I(f) in the class of quasisym-
metric functions.
4.2.4 The class QK. Estimations of functionals
Here we apply symmetrization to describe the part of the boundary of the
range of I(f) for the class QK and obtain some non-trivial estimates of func-
tionals dependent on |f(r1)| and |f(r2)|.
Proposition 4.2.3. The unique map f3

α=1 gives the absolute maximum to
|f(r1)| in the class QK.
Proof. If α = 1, then c3(1) = r1 and the admissible system of curves consists
of a curve γ that separates the points 1, r1 from 0,∞, and is homotopic on S0
to the slit along the segment [1, r1] as for Proposition 4.2.1. We suppose the
contrary to the assertion of Proposition 4.2.3. Let there be a map f ∈QK
such that for f ̸= f3, α = 1 the reverse inequality |f(r1)| ≥f3(r1)

α=1 holds.
We deﬁne the problem of the extremal partition of S′ = C \ {0, 1, |f(r1)|}
for an admissible curve γ′ which is a simple loop separating the points ∞, 0

from 1, |f(r1)|, homotopic on S′ to the slit along [−∞, 0]. Denote by D =
C \ {(−∞, 0] ∪[1, r1]}. For the domain f(D) we have the inequality
1
K m = mf3 ≤M(f(D)).
(4.8)
Let D(x) = C\{(−∞, 0]∪[1, x]} and the domain D′ = D(|f(r1)|) be extremal
for m(S′, Γ ′), say m(S′, Γ ′) = M(D′). We apply circular symmetrization to
the domain f(D) with the center at the origin and with the direction along the
positive real axis. Denote by D∗the resulting domain of this symmetrization.
This domain is admissible in the problem of the extremal partition of S′ for
the admissible curve γ′. Since D′ ⊂D(|f3(r1)|)

α=1, the inequality
M(f(D)) ≤M(D∗) ≤M(D′) ≤M(D(|f3(r1)|)

α=1) = m/K
(4.9)
holds. The ﬁrst inequality admits the equality only in the case D∗= f(D),
and the chain of inequalities (4.8–4.9) is valid only if f ≡f3

α=1. This con-
tradiction ends the proof.
2
Theorem 4.2.5. Let f ∈QK. Then, the upper boundary curve of the range
of the system of functionals I(f) = (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|), 1 < r1 < r2 in the class
QK coincides with that for the class HK for |f(r1)| ≥f2(r1)

α=1.
Proof. Let f ∗∈QK be a function that maximizes max
f∈QK |f(r2)| for a ﬁxed
value of |f(r1)| ≥f2(r1)

α=1. Then, by Propositions 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.2.3, there
is a function fj for some j = 2, 3 and ˜α such that |f ∗(r1)| = fj(r1). For this
function the inequality fj(r1) < fj(r2) ≤|f ∗(r2)| holds. Therefore, we can
choose extremal functions among those satisfying the inequality |f(r1)| <
|f(r2)|.
We prove Theorem 4.2.5 for j = 3. For j = 2 the proof is similar. We
start with the problem of the extremal partition deﬁned by the diﬀerential
ϕ3. By Proposition 4.2.2, we choose ˜α such that |f(r1)| = f3(r1)

α=˜α = c
for a function f ∈QK and |f(r1)| ≥f3(r1)

α=α4, ˜α ∈[α4, 1]. Then, we
introduce the problem on the extremal partition of S0 by the diﬀerential
ϕ3(z)dz2 with the modulus m = m(S, Γ, ˜α) for the admissible system of
curves γ = (γ1, γ2) as in Theorem 4.2.3. We assume the contrary. Let f ∈QK
and suppose that with f3 as above |f(r2)| ≥f3(r2)

α=˜α, but that f(z) is not
identical with f3. Now we deﬁne the problem of the extremal partition of S′ =
C \ {0, 1, |f(r1)|, |f(r2)|} by the admissible system γ′ of two curves (γ′
1, γ′
2)
and the vector (1, ˜α) as above. The curve γ′
1 is a simple loop that separate the
points ∞, 0 from 1, |f(r1)|, |f(r2)|, homotopic on S′ to the slit along [−∞, 0].
The curve γ′
2 separates the punctures ∞, 0, |f(r2)| from 1, |f(r1)| with the

4.2 Two-point distortion for quasiconformal maps of the plane
161
homotopy deﬁned by γ′
1. The domains f(D1), f(D2) satisfy the following
inequality
1
K m ≤M(f(D1)) + ˜α2M(f(D2)).
(4.10)
Let D′
1 and D′
2 be the extremal pair of ring domains for m(S′, Γ ′, ˜α). Then,
m(S′, Γ ′, ˜α) = M(D′
1)+ ˜α2M(D′
2). Now we apply circular symmetrization to
the domains f(D1), f(D2) with the center at the origin and with the direction
of the positive and negative real axes respectively. Denote by D∗
1 and D∗
2 the
resulting domains of this symmetrization. This pair of domains is admissible
in the problem of the extremal partition of S′ for the admissible system γ′
and the vector (1, ˜α) as above. Then,
m(S′, Γ ′, ˜α) ≥M(D∗
1) + ˜α2M(D∗
2) ≥M(f(D1)) + ˜α2M(f(D2)).
(4.11)
The inequality can be replaced by equality only in the case D∗
1 = f(D1) and
D∗
2 = f(D2). Since the trajectory of the extremal diﬀerential in the latter
problem of the extremal partition starting from |f(r2)| has negative direction
to |f(r1)|, the gradient of m(S′, Γ ′, ˜α) at the point |f(r2)| has the same
direction and the modulus increases in so far as we move the point |f(r2)|
to |f3(r2)|α=˜α. Taking into account the extremal properties of f3(z) with
respect to the problem of the extremal partition we arrive at the inequality
m(S′, Γ ′, ˜α) ≤mf3 = m/K. This contradicts the chain of inequalities (4.10–
4.11) and ends the proof.
2
For the rest of the boundary of the range of the system of functionals
I(f) = (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) symmetrization can not be applied because sym-
metrized domains are not admissible in the corresponding problems of the
extremal partition.
Theorem 4.2.6. The unique map f2

α=1 gives the absolute maximum to the
functional |f(r2)/f(r1)|, 1 < r1 < r2 in the classes QK and HK. Moreover,

Proof. If α = 1, then c2(1) = 1 and the admissible system of curves consists

suppose that with f2 as above |f(r2)/f(r1)| ≥f2(r2)/f2(r1)

α=1, but that
f(z) is not identical with f2. We deﬁne the problem of the extremal partition

loop separating the punctures ∞, 0 from 1, f(r2)/f(r1), homotopic on S′ to
the slit along [−∞, 0]. Let D = C \ {(−∞, 0] ∪[r1, r2]}. We consider the map
w = f(z)/f(r1). The domain f(D)/f(r1) satisﬁes the following inequality

symmetrization to the domain f(D)/f(r1) with the center at origin and with
the direction of the positive real axis. Denote by D∗the resulting domain of
this symmetrization. This domain is admissible in the problem of the extremal
partition of S′ for the admissible curve γ′. Since D′ ⊂D(f2(r2)/f2(r1))

α=1,
the inequality
M(D∗) ≤M(D′) ≤M(D(f2(r2)/f2(r1))

(4.13)

α=1. The
explicit calculation of the moduli and the relation m/K ≤M(D(|f(r2)/f(r1)|))
gives us the inequality of Theorem 4.2.6 for the class QK. Since the extremal

For the forthcoming Theorem 4.2.8 (right-hand side inequality) the prob-
lem of the extremal partition is deﬁned by the admissible curve which is a
simple loop that separates the punctures 0, 1 from r1, r2. It is homotopic on
S0 = C \ {0, 1, r1, r2} to the slit along the segment [0, 1]. For the left-hand
side inequality we consider the problem of the extremal partition for the ad-
missible curve which is a simple loop that separates the punctures 1, r1 from
0, r2. It is homotopic on the same S0 to the slit along the segment [1, r1].
Theorem 4.2.8. Let f ∈HK, 1 < r1 < r2. Then, the following sharp esti-

The extremal functions are the Teichm¨uller maps generated by the extremal
diﬀerentials in the above problems of the extremal partition.
More diﬃcult estimates are valid for the functionals |f(r1) ± f(r2)| and
|f(r1)| ± |f(r2)|.
Theorem 4.2.9. The unique extremal map f ∗gives the maximum to f(r2)−
f(r1) in the class HK and the maximum to |f(r2)|−|f(r1)|, 1 < r1 < r2 in the
class QK. This map satisﬁes the Beltrami equation (4.1) with the Beltrami
coeﬃcient (4.2) with

Proof. The proof falls into three steps.

points (w1(t), w2(t)) of the upper boundary curve Γ + of the range of the
system of functionals I(f) = (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|).
Consider the point (w1(1/3), w2(1/3)) of Γ +. Theorems 4.2.4, 4.2.6 imply
that

For the function f2 we have
∇w1mf2 = πRes w=w1ψ2(w);
∇w2mf2 = πRes w=w2ψ2(w).
(4.14)
The notation ∇wj stands for the gradient which is taken at the point wj.
Each of w1, w2 is a simple pole of the extremal diﬀerential ψ2,
ψ2(w)dw2 = B
w −C
w(w −1)(w −w1)(w −w2)dw2,
C ∈[1, w1] and B < 0. Hence, we obtain as in Theorem 4.2.4, the equality

This implies that there exists a unique α∗and t∗satisfying the necessary
condition that, therefore, becomes suﬃcient, because the extremal function
giving a point of Γ + is unique for each point of Γ +. To prove this we need
more reﬁned observations.
For a ﬁxed α∗we consider the quadratic diﬀerential

where the real-valued diﬀerentiable functions u = u(μ), v = v(μ) accept their
values from some neighbourhood of (r1, r2), μ ∈(−ε, ε), u(0) = r1, v(0) = r2.
We construct the Teichm¨uller map ˜f as the solution of the Beltrami equation
(4.1) with the Beltrami coeﬃcient (4.2) for the quadratic diﬀerential (4.17)
with the normalization of the class HK. Denote by w1(α∗, u, v) = ˜f(r1),
w2(α∗, u, v) = ˜f(r2). These functions are diﬀerentiable with respect to u and
v because ˜f is the solution to the Beltrami equation with the Beltrami co-
eﬃcient which is diﬀerentiable with respect to u and v. Moreover, we have
that ˜c1(r1, r2) = c1(α∗), w1(α∗) = w1(α∗, r1, r2), w2(α∗) = y(α∗, r1, r2).
Since ˜f ∈HK, the points (w1(α∗, u(μ), v(μ)), w2(α∗, u(μ), v(μ))) form a
curve, parameterized by μ, that touches the boundary curve Γ + at the point
(w1(α∗), w2(α∗)).
Denote by m(u, v) the modulus deﬁned by the diﬀerential (4.17), and
by m ˜
f the modulus deﬁned by the Teichm¨uller map ˜f. Of course, m ˜
f =

Here in the right-hand sides of these equalities the partial derivatives are

into account the rule of diﬀerentiation for the modulus we obtain that

Now we choose the parameterization u = r1 + μ/2, v = r2 −μ/2. Since
the curve (w1(α∗, u(μ), v(μ)), w2(α∗, u(μ), v(μ))), given with the parameter
μ ∈(−ε, ε), touches the boundary curve of Theorem 4.2.4 at the point μ = 0,

Thus, the extremal function f ∗is f2 deﬁned by the Beltrami coeﬃcient
given in the formulation of the theorem. This completes the proof.
2
By the analogy with the preceding theorem we arrive at the following
statement.
Theorem 4.2.10. The unique extremal map f ∗gives the maximum to |f(r2)+
f(r1)|, 1 < r1 < r2 in the classes HK, QK. This map satisﬁes the Beltrami
equation (4.1) with the Beltrami coeﬃcient (4.2) with
ϕ(z) =
c −z
z(z −1)(z −r1)(z −r2),
where
c =
r1r2(r1 + r2 −2)
r2(r2 −1) + r1(r1 −1).
The extremal function in this theorem is f3 for some α = α∗.
The case of a negative r1 is obtained by the analogy with the above.
Moreover, for r1 > 0, r2 > 1 an analog of Theorem 4.2.5 is stronger. It turns
out that the upper boundary curve of the range of the system of functionals
I(f) = (|f(−r1)|, |f(r2)|) in the class QK coincides with that for the class
HK completely.
4.2.5 Conclusions and unsolved problems
We start with the conformal case. An earlier result by J. Jenkins [64] asserts
that the upper boundary curve of the range of the system of functionals
(|f(−r1)|, |f(r2)|), 0 < r1, r2 < 1 in the class S coincides with that in the class
SR. By the words ”upper” and ”lower” we mean, as before, that the points
(|f(−r1)|, |f(r2)|) are considered as points of the real plane R2. In Jenkins’
proof it was important that the ﬁxed points (−r1) and r2 were situated in
diﬀerent legs of the real diameter. Later on, the author and S. Fedorov [163]
have reached to a similar result for the system of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|),
0 < r1 < r2 < 1. As for the lower boundary curves for these ranges, they

4.2 Two-point distortion for quasiconformal maps of the plane
167
are diﬀerent in the classes S and SR. In SR the points of the lower boundary
curves are given by the simple function z(1 −uz + z2)−1, −2 ≤u ≤2.
The points of the upper boundary curves are given by functions with more
complicated structure. They have been described in [64], [163].
In the quasiconformal case we introduce a subclass HK of the class QK
of functions satisfying the same symmetry condition f(z) = f(¯z). This class
plays the same role for the class QK as the subclass SR for the class S. One
can easily see that the upper boundary curve of the range of the system of
functionals (|f(−r1)|, |f(r2)|), r1 > 0, r2 > 1 over the class QK coincides with
that over the class QR
K. Hence, this result is close to [64] and [163]. Of course,
the method of proof is completely diﬀerent. The extra normalization f(1) = 1
causes another diﬃculty. So, we are not able right now to prove an analogous
result for the system of functionals (|f(−r1)|, |f(r2)|), r1 > 0, 0 < r2 < 1
or for the system of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|), 0 < r1 < 1, r2 > 1. But
for the system of functionals (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|), 1 < r1 < r2 this is the case
as the author announced at the International Congress of Mathematicians,
Berlin, 1998 [159]. In [156] the author has shown this for K-quasiconformal
homeomorphisms of U. Corresponding theorem we will present in the next
section.
From these results we deduce the sharp estimates for the functionals
|f(r2)| ± |f(±r1)| and |f(r2) ± f(±r1)|. The proofs open a way to present
extremal functions in terms of Beltrami coeﬃcients of direct mapping. But
the solution of the problem for |f(r2) ± f(∓r1)| is still unknown. The same
holds for the lower estimates of the functional |f(r2)|/|f(r1)|.
Hereby we consider the following problems as interesting and diﬃcult to
solve:
1) Find the lower boundary curve of the range of the system of functionals
(|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) in the class QK for diﬀerent real r1, r2.
2) Find the upper boundary curve of the range of the system of functionals
(|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|) in the class QK for diﬀerent r1, r2, so that one of r1, r2 lies
in the segment (0, 1) (for r1, r2 ∈(0, 1) this can be obtained in the same way
as presented in this work and, therefore, it is not so interesting).
3) Obtain the sharp estimates of |f(r2) −f(r1)| and |f(r2) + f(−r1)| for
r2, r1 > 0 in terms of the Beltrami coeﬃcient of the direct mapping.
4) Obtain the lower sharp estimates of |f(r2)|/|f(±r1)| for diﬀerent real
values of r1 and r2.
Here we do not speak about non-real ﬁxed points because our method is
based on symmetric structures.

From the construction of the diﬀerentials one can learn the dynamics
singularities and the trajectory changes depending on the parameter α. The
diﬀerentials ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, and ϕ4 have ﬁnite norms and ﬁnite trajectories.
For each of them one can deﬁne the problem of the extremal partition the
admissible system of curves that consists of at most two elements which are
non-homotopic non-critical trajectories of the corresponding diﬀerential. We
pose now more general problems.

170
4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
I) Let U ′ = U \ {0, A, B}, |A| < |B| < 1. We consider the admissible
system of two curves γ(j) = (γ(j)
1 , γ(j)
2 ) where γ(j)
1
is a countable set of curves
of the 2-nd type containing arcs with endpoints on ∂U that separate 0 from A,
B; γ(j)
2
is a countable set of simple loops of the 1-st type with the homotopy
deﬁned by γ(j)
1 , and separating A, B from 0, ∂U. Assume j = 1 if γ(j)
1
is
homotopic on U ′ to the slit along [A, B], 0 /∈[A, B], and to the slit along the
broken line [A, ε] #[ε, B] for some complex ε with a small |ε| if 0 ∈[A, B].
We pose the problem of the extremal partition of U ′ for the admissible
system γ(j) and a vector α ≡(1, α). The extremal metric is deﬁned by the
quadratic diﬀerential ψ1(w)dw2,
ψ1(w) = A1(α)
(w −d1(α))(w −1/ ¯d1(α))
w(w −A)(w −B)(w −1/ ¯A)(w −1/ ¯B),
where A1(α) and d1(α) are deﬁned by the ψ1-lengths of non-critical trajecto-
ries under the assumption that two characteristic domains do not degenerate.
If j = 1, then the equality arg A1(α) = π −arg(AB/d1(α)) is satisﬁed.
The extremal diﬀerential can also have the form ψ2(w)dw2,
ψ2(w) = A2(α)
(w −eiβ(α))(w −eiκ(α))
w(w −A)(w −B)(w −1/ ¯A)(w −1/ ¯B),
where A2(α), β(α), κ(α) are deﬁned by ψ2-lengths of non-critical trajectories
and β, κ are connected by the following equalities
κ

β

ψ2(eiη)eiηdη = 0,
arg A2(α) = −κ + β

II) On U ′ we consider the admissible system of curves γ(j) = (γ1, γ(j)
2 )
where γ1 is the simple loop of the 1-st type separating ∂U from 0, A, B; Γ (j)
2
is deﬁned in the same way as the above in I). The equality j = 1 is thought
of as before.
The extremal quadratic diﬀerential ψ3(w)dw2 in the corresponding prob-
lem of the extremal partition has the form
ψ3(w) = A1(α)
(w −d3(α))(w −1/ ¯d3(α))
w(w −A)(w −B)(w −1/ ¯A)(w −1/ ¯B),
where A3(α) and d3(α) are deﬁned in the same way as in I). If j = 1, then
the equality arg A3(α) = arg(AB/d3(α)) is satisﬁed.
III) Consider on U ′ the admissible system of curves the ﬁrst type γ(j) =
{γ1, γ(j)
2 } where γ1 is the same as in II) and γ(j)
2
is a simple loop that separates
0, A from B, ∂U. The homotopy j = 1 is deﬁned by the slit along [0, A], if
B /∈[0, A], and by the slit along the broken line [0, B + ε] #[B + ε, A] if
B ∈[0, A].

4.3 Two-point distortion for quasiconformal maps of the unit disk
171
The extremal quadratic diﬀerential ψ4(w)dw2 is given by
ψ4(w) = A4(α)
(w −d4(α))(w −1/ ¯d4(α))
w(w −A)(w −B)(w −1/ ¯A)(w −1/ ¯B),
where A4(α) and d4(α) are deﬁned as in I), II). If j = 1, then the equality
arg A4(α) = arg(AB/d4(α)) is satisﬁed. If A = r1, B = r2, then ψk ≡ϕk
with an appropriate α. The limiting values of α correspond to degeneracy of
a characteristic domain and one can calculate them integrating along critical
trajectories.
Further we need some statements which we formulate as propositions.
Without loss of generality we assume A > 0.
Proposition 4.3.1. In each of the problems of the extremal partition I), II),
III), the modulus satisﬁes the inequality
m(U ′, Γ (j), α) ≤m(U ′, Γ (1), α).
Proposition 4.3.2. Let j = 1. In the problem III) the simple zero d4(α) and
the arc of the critical trajectory of the diﬀerential ψ4(w)dw2 connecting d4(α)
and B are located within the triangle with the vertices 0, A, B, when α < 1,
and in the sector {w : |B| ≤|w| < 1, arg B ≤arg(w −B) ≤arg(B −A)},
when α > 1.
Proof of Propositions 4.3.1, 4.3.2 are based on the use of polarization. Let
0 ≤α < 1, Im B > 0. We consider ﬁrst the problem III). We apply the
polarization transform with respect to the real axis to the extremal doubly
connected domains D1 and D2 associated with γ1, γ(j)
2 . As a result, we obtain
the pair of non-overlapping doubly connected domains D0
1, D0
2 admissible
with respect to the problem associated with γ1, γ(1)
2 . Moreover M(Dk) <
M(D0
k) if Dk ̸= D0
k. Thus, the statement of Proposition 4.3.1 follows from
the extremality of the pair of the domains. The problems I), II) are considered
analogously.
Besides, the trajectories of ψ4 are analytic. By the deﬁnition of polariza-
tion the arc of the trajectory connecting B and d4 is located in the upper
half-plane. The analogous application of polarization with respect to the lines
(0, B), (A, B) leads to the statement of Proposition 4.3.2.

Denote by mI(B) = m(U ′, Γ (1), α) = ∥ψ1∥(or ∥ψ2∥), mII(B) = ∥ψ3∥,
mIII(B) = ∥ψ4∥emphasizing the dependence of the modulus on the simple
pole of the corresponding diﬀerential in U.
Proposition 4.3.3. If 0 < α < 1, then mIII(|B|eit) is a decreasing function
in t ∈[0, π] and an increasing function in t ∈[−π, 0].
Proof. We prove the proposition for non-negative values of t. It follows from
Theorem 2.7.2 that the modulus is a diﬀerentiable function with respect to

172
4. MODULI FOR QUASICONFORMAL MAPPING
B and that the vector ∇m(B) is directed tangentially to the trajectory of
the diﬀerential ψ4 at the point B. By Proposition 4.3.2 this vector is directed
into the half-plane Im w ¯B < 0. The tangent vector to the circle |B|eit at the
point B is directed into the half-plane Im w ¯B > 0. Therefore, their scalar
product is negative. This leads to the statement of Proposition 4.3.3.
2
The following Propositions can be proved analogously.
Proposition 4.3.4. In the problem I), if j = 1, then the arc of the critical
trajectories of the diﬀerentials ψ1(w)dw2, ψ2(w)dw2 connecting A and B are
situated in the half-plane Im w ¯B < 0.
Proposition 4.3.5. In the problem I), if α > 0, then the modulus mk(|B|eit)
is a decreasing function in t ∈[0, π] and an increasing function in t ∈[−π, 0],
k = I, II.
4.3.2 Extremal problems
We construct the Teichm¨uller maps fj by the diﬀerentials ψ1, . . . , ψ4 as in
Section 4.2.2, i.e., K-quasiconformal automorphisms deﬁned on U satisfying
the Beltrami equation 5.1 with the complex dilatation
μfj(ζ) = k ϕj(ζ)
|ϕj(ζ)|, k = K −1
K + 1, j = 1, 2, 3, 4,
keeping the points z = 0, 1 motionless. Obviously, fj ∈UK. These maps are
extremal with respect to the problems of the extremal partition established
by the diﬀerentials (4.20–4.23).
The following remark concerns with the continuous dependence of f1, . . . , f4
on the parameter α. We have f1

α=α1 = f2

α=α1, f2

α=α2 = f3

α=α2,
f3

α=α3 = f4

α=α3.
Theorem 4.1.1 yields that the unique map f1

α=α0 gives the absolute
minimum and f4

α=1 gives the absolute maximum |f(r1)| in the class UK.
The continuous properties of f1, . . . , f4 on α imply that for any real c with

there are such j and ˜α that |fj(r1)|α=˜α = c. Moreover, the Teichm¨uller maps
fj act homeomorphically in the segment [−1, 1]. Hence, |fj(r1)| = fj(r1) <
|fj(r2)| = fj(r2), j = 1, . . . , 4.
Theorem 4.3.1. For any f ∈UK there are unique pair ˜α and j = 1, . . . , 4
such that
|f(r1)| = fj(r1)

α=˜α, and |f(r2)| ≤fj(r2)

α=˜α.
The equality is attained only for f = fj

α=˜α.

4.3 Two-point distortion for quasiconformal maps of the unit disk
173
Proof. We choose j and ˜α such that |f(r1)| = fj(r1)

α=˜α = c for a func-
tion f ∈UK. Let, for instance, j = 4, ˜α ∈[α4, 1]. Then, we generate
the problem of the extremal partition induced by the diﬀerential ϕ4(z)dz2
with the modulus m for the admissible system of curves γ = (γ1, γ2) with
the homotopy deﬁned by the slit along [0, r1]. Now we suppose the con-
trary. Let f ∈UK and suppose that with f4 as above |f(r2)| ≥f4(r2)

α=˜α,
but that f(z) is not identical with f4. The map e−i arg f(r1)f deﬁnes a sys-
tem of curves e−i arg f(r1)f(γ) = (e−i arg f(r1)f(γ1), e−i arg f(r1)f(γ2)) which
is an admissible system γ(k) = f(γ) on U ′ = U \ {c, f(r2)e−i arg f(r1), 0}
for some k. Then, m/K < mf < m(U ′, Γ (k), ˜α), and by Proposition 4.3.1,
m/K < mf < m(U ′, Γ (1), ˜α). By Proposition 4.3.3 we have the inequality
m(U ′, Γ (1), ˜α) ≤m(U \ {c, |f(r2)|, 0}, Γ (1), ˜α).
In the latter modulus its gradient at the point |f(r2)| is directed to 0 and
m(U \ {c, |f(r2)|, 0}, Γ (1), ˜α) ≤m(U \ {c, |f4(r2)|α=˜α, 0}, Γ (1), ˜α).
For j = 1, 2 we use Propositions 4.3.4 and for j=3 Proposition 4.3.5. The
uniqueness of the pair (j, ˜α) follows from the uniqueness of the extremal
map for quasiconformal distortion of the modulus as in the proof of Theorem
4.2.3. Thus, the theorem is proved completely.

Assume wk(t) = fj(rk)

α=t where j = 1 for t ∈[α0, α1], j = 2 for

α=t−α3+α4
for t ∈[α3, α3 +
1 −α4]; k = 1, 2.
Theorem 4.3.2. Let f ∈UK. The upper boundary curve for the range of
the functional I(f) = (|f(r1)|, |f(r2)|), 0 < r1 < r2 < 1, i.e., the curve
of max
f∈UK |f(r2)| for |f(r1)| ﬁxed, is parameterized by (w1(t), w2(t)) in t ∈
[α0, α3 +1−α4]. This curve is smooth and, being considered in R2, increases
in t ∈[α0, α3] and decreases in t ∈[α3, α3 + 1 −α4]. The normal vector
to this curve is vertical at the point t = α3 and is horizontal at the points
t = α0, α3 + 1 −α4.
The proof of this theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 4.2.4. Also,
the following estimates are valid.

5. Moduli on Teichm¨uller Spaces
The main purpose of this chapter is to study the moduli on a Riemann surface
varying the conformal structure of this surface. Thus, we will consider the
modulus as a functional on a Teichm¨uller space. The variational formulae
will be derived. By this variations we will deduce harmonic properties of the
modulus with respect to the complex parameters of the Teichm¨uller space.
5.1 Some information on Teichm¨uller spaces
Let g, n be non-negative integers and S0 be a Riemann surface of ﬁnite type
(g, n), i.e., it is of genus g with n possible punctures. If 3g −3 + n > 0,
then S0 is of hyperbolic conformal type and its universal cover is conformally
equivalent to the unit disk U. The covering maps replacing the sheets of
the universal covering induce a corresponding Fuchsian group G0 of M¨obius
automorphisms of U. One says that the Fuchsian group G0 uniformizes the
Riemann surface S0 and S0 = U/G0.
The Teichm¨uller space T(S0) is the space of analytically ﬁnite conformal
structures on a topological surface S0 where two are equivalent if there is a
conformal map between them which is homotopic to the identity. In other
words, it is a quotient space of marked (with respect to the initial surface
S0) Riemann surfaces of the same orientation and analytically ﬁnite confor-
mal type. Let S be a Riemann surface and f be a homeomorphism of the
initial Riemann surface S0 onto S. We consider the pair (S, [f]) as a marked
Riemann surface where [f] is the class of all homeomorphisms homotopic to
f. For the convenience we will denote the marked Riemann surface by (S, f)
where f represents [f]. The marked Riemann surfaces (S1, f1) and (S2, f2)
are said to be equivalent if there is a conformal homeomorphism h : S1 →S2
such that the map f −1
2
◦h ◦f1 is homotopic to the identity map on S0. We
call an equivalence class of the marked Riemann surfaces the point of the Te-
ichm¨uller space and the collection of all equivalence classes the Teichm¨uller
space T ≡T(S0) (with respect to the initial surface S0). The equivalence
class represented by the marked Riemann surface (S0, id) is said to be the
initial point 0 of T(S0). The Teichm¨uller space T(S0) is a complex analytic
manifold of complex dimension 3g−3+n. For these results we refer the reader

to L. V. Ahlfors [8], [9], L. Bers [17] who proved the existence of global co-
ordinates (moduli) in the Teichm¨uller space (see also [71]). For the detail
information we also refer to [1], [90], [104].
The Teichm¨uller space T is a metric, connected, simply connected space
with the natural Teichm¨uller metric τT (x, y). Assume (S1, f1) and (S2, f2) to
be the marked Riemann surfaces. The homeomorphism f2 ◦f −1
1
: S1 →S2
generates a homeomorphism of marked Riemann surfaces. There are qua-
siconformal maps (see e.g. [18]) among all homeomorphisms homotopic to
f2 ◦f −1
1 . Let (S1, f1) represent a point x ∈T(S0) and (S2, f2) represent a
point y ∈T(S0). Then,
τT (x, y) := 1

where we take f over all quasiconformal homeomorphisms which are homo-
topic to f2 ◦f −1

z∈S1
|μf(z)| < 1.
Let S0 = U/G0 and let B(G0) be the Banach space of Beltrami diﬀeren-
tials μ(z)d¯z/dz which are invariant with respect to actions from G0, i.e., μ(z)
is a measurable function in U with ∥μf∥∞< ∞and μ(γ(z))γ′(z)/γ′(z) =
μ(z), γ ∈G0. Let D(G0) be the unit ball in B(G0): ∥μf∥∞< 1. Each
μ ∈D(G0) deﬁnes by means of the Beltrami equation a unique quasicon-
formal automorphism ωμ : U →U of the unit disk with the normalization
ωμ(±1) = ±1, ωμ(i) = i. We denote by I(G0) the space consisting of the
diﬀerentials μ ∈D(G0) so that the map ωμ acts identically on ∂U and call it
the space of trivial Beltrami diﬀerentials. The Teichm¨uller space T(S0) can be
realized as the Teichm¨uller space of Fuchsian groups T(G0) = D(G0)/I(G0).
Riemann surfaces of the same conformal type (g, n) generate isomorphic Te-
ichm¨uller spaces, so they can be thought of as a single Teichm¨uller space
T(g, n). However, for convenience we will link the Teichm¨uller space with
some initial Riemann surface. There is a natural holomorphic projection
Φ : D(G0) →T(G0).
Denote by H2,0(G0) the space of all quadratic holomorphic diﬀerentials
q(z)dz2 in U, invariant with respect to G0: q(γ(z))(γ′(z))2 = q(z), γ ∈G0,
say the space of all parabolic 2-forms of weight (-4) for the group G0 with
the ﬁnite norm ∥q∥:= sup
U
(1 −|z|2)−2|q(z)|. The projection of H2,0(G0) onto
S0 is the space of quadratic holomorphic diﬀerentials ϕ on S0 and in the case

Denote by N(G0) the space of locally trivial Beltrami diﬀerentials, i.e., the
subspace of B(G0) that forms the kernel of the operator A(μ). Then, one
can identify the tangent space to T(G0) at the initial point with the space
H(G0) := B(G0)/N(G0). It is natural to relate it to a subspace of B(G0).

Then, H(G0) = Λ∗
q(H2,0(G0)) ∼= B(G0)/N(G0). At any other point of T(G0)
one can obtain the tangent space H(G) by the same observations with respect
to the group G = χμ(G0) where χμ is the group isomorphism deﬁned by
χμ : G0 →ωμ◦G0◦(ωμ)−1. The coupling ⟨μ, q⟩:= A(μ) deﬁnes the cotangent

5.2 Moduli on Teichm¨uller spaces
On a Riemann surface S0 of type (g, n, l) (in this section we let l ̸= 0) we
deﬁne an admissible system γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) of curves of type I, II. This
system induces a free family Γ of the homotopy classes of curves generated
by the curves of the admissible system. A major problem considered in this
section is this: given a ﬁxed vector α, how the modulus m(S0, Γ, α) changes
under the variation of the conformal structure of S0?

178
5. MODULI ON TEICHM¨ULLER SPACES
5.2.1 Variational formulae
Now our attempt is to vary the complex structure of S0 to observe what
happens with the modulus m(S0, Γ, α), i.e., we are going to extend the mod-
ulus onto the Teichm¨uller space T(S0). Let us deﬁne the modulus problem
(2.12–2.13) for the free family Γ on S0 and a weight vector α ﬁxed. Denote
the modulus in this problem by m(S0, Γ, α). Consider a quasiconformal map
w = f(ζ) : S0 →S with a complex Beltrami dilatation μf = f¯ζ/fζ such that
the marked Riemann surface (S, f) represents a point x of the Teichm¨uller
space T(S0). Now let us deﬁne the modulus problem (2.12–2.13) for the ad-
missible system of curves Γf = (f(γ1), . . . , f(γm)) with the same weight vec-
tor α on the Riemann surface S. Deﬁne m0 = m(S0, Γ, α), mf = m(S, Γf, α).
Let ϕμ(w)dw2 (w is a local parameter on S) be the extremal quadratic diﬀer-
ential in the modulus problem on S, mf =

S |ϕμ|dσw. Since the homotopy
type of the maps from the same equivalence class x ∈T(S0) induces the ho-
motopy type of curves on S, the conformal invariance of the modulus implies
that the value of mf does not depend on the choice of f. It depends only on
the point x ∈T(S0) and we denote it by m(x) where x varies over the whole
space T(S0) for the admissible system Γ and the vector α ﬁxed, m(0) = m0.
If Φ(μ1) = Φ(μ2) = x, then the diﬀerential ϕμ1 can be obtained from the
diﬀerential ϕμ2 by a conformal transform. The quadratic diﬀerential is in-
variant under a conformal change of parameters. Therefore, the diﬀerentials
ϕμ1, ϕμ2 represent one and the same diﬀerential ϕx, ϕ0 ≡ϕ.
Set

Then, the diﬀerential ψ(ζ)dζ2 is locally integrable on S0 and ∥ψ∥L1 < ∞.

Proof. The critical trajectories of the extremal quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2
split S0 into a family of non-overlapping ring domains {Dj}s
j=1 and quad-
rangles {Dj}m
j=s+1 on S0 (∪m
j=1Dj = S0). These domains are associated with
the homotopy classes {Γj}s

of the ﬁrst type, i.e., 1 ≤j ≤s. If ζ ∈γ, then ϕ(ζ)dζ2 ≥0 and ϕ(ζ)/|ϕ(ζ)| =

We slit the doubly connected domain Dj along a critical orthogonal trajec-

The parameter

normalization, z = z(ζ) conformally maps the domain Dj onto a rectangle
R in the z-plane; this rectangle is of length 1 and of height M(Dj), where
M(Dj) is the modulus of the ring domain Dj with respect to the family
of curves that separate the boundary components of Dj. The diﬀerentials
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 and ψ(ζ)dζ2 are invariant under the change of the local parameter
on the surface S0. Consequently, ϕ(ζ)dζ2 = ϕ(z)dz2, ψ(ζ)dζ2 = ψ(z)dz2, and
in terms of the local parameter z we have ϕ(z) ≡α2

We remind that Φ is a projection D(G0) →T(G0) = T(S0) and H(G0)
is a tangent space to T(S0) at the initial point. The following theorem gives
us a variational formula for the functional m(x)– the modulus extended to
T(S0).
Theorem 5.2.1. Let x be a point of T(S0), t = inf ∥μ∥∞for all μ ∈D(G0)

Proof. By the well-known Teichm¨uller theorem on the minimum of the max-
imal deviation from a conformal map (see Section 5.1), there exists a qua-
siconformal map f such that ∥f¯ζ/fζ∥∞= t. The preceding lemma shows

ζ = J(z) is a global uniformizing function, i.e., an automorphic function with

This relation is a consequence of the absolute continuity of the Lebesgue
integral and the following facts: ω(z) tends to z locally uniformly in U; ωz
tends to 1 locally in L2; qμ tends to q locally uniformly in U (by virtue of
the convergence ∥ϕμ∥→∥ϕ∥and the uniqueness of the limit diﬀerential).
Obviously, the assertion of Theorem 5.2.1 follows from (5.1–5.3), that
completes the proof.

The following corollary is a diﬀerential formula for the modulus of a family
of curves with respect to its parameters; this formula was proved earlier and
by diﬀerent methods by A. Solynin and E. Emel’yanov (see Theorem 2.7.2).
Corollary 5.2.1. Let g = 0, l = 0, wj = f μ(ζj), j = 1, . . . , n; further, let
ζn−2 = wn−2 = 0, ζn−1 = wn−1 = 1, ζn = wn = ∞. Then

μ=0

j = 1, . . . , (n −3).
Proof. If μ∗∈H(G0), then there exists a unique cusp 2-form q∗(z) ∈
H2,0(G0) of weight (-4) such that μ∗= (1 −|z|2)−2q∗(z). Hence,

U/G0
μ∗q dσz =

U/G0
q (1 −|z|2)−2q∗(z) dσz = (q, q∗),
where (·, ·) is the Petersson scalar product on H2,0(G0). Let Rj, j =
1, . . . , (n −3), be the pull-backs to U of the linearly independent vectors
1
π
ζj(ζj −1)
ζ(ζ −1)(ζ −ζj).
In H2,0(G0), we consider the basis {qj}n−3
j=1 biorthogonal with {Rj} relative
to the Petersson scalar product, i.e.,
(qj, Rk) =
0, for j ̸= k,
1, for j = k.
Then {νj : νj = (1 −|z|2)2qj} is the Bers basis in H(G0). The punctures
wj can be regarded as local parameters on T(0, n). Now the assertion follows
from the Petersson diﬀerentiation formulae ∂/∂wj = (·, qj) and (q, qj) =
−π Res w=wjϕ(w) (see, e.g., [89]).

system of curves γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) leads to the functional m(S0, Γ, α) for each
vector α given. Given a vector b = (b1, . . . , bm) we consider another problem
of the extremal partition following K. Strebel (Propositions 2.7.2, 2.7.3) where
we ﬁx the widths of the domains swept by the curves of the corresponding
homotopy classes. This implies that an extremal domain never degenerates
for a positive width.
Now we construct the holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 of ﬁnite
L1 norm with ﬁnite trajectories on S0. Let (D1, . . . , Dm) be its characteristic
system of domains. Let us consider on S the family of non-overlapping dou-
bly connected domains and quadrilaterals (f(D1), . . . , f(Dm)). The moduli
of all components are bounded due to the obvious inequality M(f(Dj)) ≤
KM(Dj) where K = exp(2τT (0, x)). In each doubly connected domain f(Dj)
we select a simple loop γx
j , separating the boundary components of f(Dj)
and in each quadrilateral f(Dj) we select a simple arc connecting its op-
posite sides on ∂S. Then (γx
1 , . . . , γx
m) is an admissible system of curves on
S. By Proposition 2.7.3 for the same vector b = (b1, . . . , bm) we construct
a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, x)dζ2, ϕ(ζ, 0) = ϕ(ζ) with ﬁnite trajectories, of
homotopy type (γx
1 , . . . , γx
m). Analogously to m(x) the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, x)dζ2
does not depend on concrete μ or f, but on the point x ∈T(S0). Denote by
s(x) = sϕ(x) = ∥ϕ(ζ, x)∥L1. We deduce the properties of this functional.
Proposition 5.2.1. Let x ∈T(S0), K = exp(2τT (0, x)). Then s(0)/K ≤
s(x) ≤Ks(0).
Proof. Let (Dx
1, . . . , Dx
m) be the characteristic family of domains for the dif-
ferential ϕ(ζ, x)dζ2, and let (D1, . . . , Dm) := (D0
1, . . . , D0
m). Since Dx
j and
f x(Dj) have the same homotopic type, Proposition 2.7.2 implies the inequal-

The following theorem is proved much as Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 4.1,
by using the corresponding integration along the orthogonal trajectories. For
this reason, here we only give the statement.
Theorem 5.2.2. Let x be a point of T(S0), t = inf ∥μ∥∞for all μ ∈D(G0)
such that Φ(μ) = x. Then,

where μ∗∈H(G0), ∥μ∗∥∞= t; q(z)dz2 is a pull-back of the quadratic diﬀer-
ential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 for s(0) onto the universal covering U.
Theorems 5.2.1, 5.2.2, in particular, yield that m(x) and s(x) are locally
harmonic in a neighbourhood of x if and only if the extremal quadratic dif-
ferential ϕx is locally holomorphic in this neighbourhood.
5.2.2 Three lemmas
Here and further on we assume the initial Riemann surface to be of type
(g, n). First of all, we summarize the relevant information about the spaces
of diﬀerentials on Riemann surfaces. We refer the reader to [8], [19], [71],
[104] for the case of compact Riemann surfaces. Denote by J : U →S0 the
G0-automorphic function, say the global uniformization of S0 = U/G0, and
let p be an integer number. Then, every holomorphic p-diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζp
on S0 can be lifted to the universal cover U by the rule
ϕ(ζ)dζp →q(z)dzp,
where q(z) = (ϕ ◦J(z)) (J′(z))p.
For simplicity, we denote the linear vector spaces of the diﬀerentials indi-
cated on S0 and U by the same symbol Hp,0(S0).
Classical results ([38], [140]) state for n = 0 that

Lemma 5.2.2. For p ≥1 and n > max[3 −3g, 2(p −1)(g −1)], the complex
dimension of the space Hp,0(S0) is given by the formula
dim CHp,0(S0) = (2p −1)(g −1) + n.
Proof. The lemma is a consequence of the Riemann-Roch theorem. Suppose
a is a divisor on a compact Riemann surface S of genus g > 1, i.e., a is a ﬁnite
0-chain on S: a = k
j=1 αjpj, where pj are points of S and αj are integers.
The order of the divisor at pj is ord pja = αj (note that ord pa = 0 if p ̸= pj),
and the degree is deg a = k
j=1 αj. The sum of two divisors a = k
j=1 αjpj
and b = l
j=1 βjqj is the 0-chain deﬁned by a+b = k
j=1 αjpj +l
j=1 βjqj.
If pi = qj, then the coeﬃcients are added. The set of all divisors on S is
an Abelian group with respect to the above operation of addition; the unit

element is the divisor with zero coeﬃcients, and the inverse element is (−a) =
k
j=1(−αj)pj. A divisor a is called non-negative if αj ≥0 for all j = 1, . . . , k.
If ϕ(ζ)dζp is a holomorphic or meromorphic diﬀerential on S, then (ϕ)
denotes its divisor,
(ϕ) =

r∈S
r · ord rϕ, deg(ϕ) =

r∈S
ord rϕ = N −P,
where N is the number of zeros and P the number of poles of the diﬀerential
in question. For p = 0 we have deg(ϕ) = 0. Let [a] denote the equivalence
class of a divisor a; by deﬁnition, a ∼b if deg(a−b) = 0, i.e., if there exists a
meromorphic function f such that a −b = (f). Since, obviously, all divisors
in [a] have equal degrees, we can set deg [a] := deg a. Furthermore, let Dp(a)
denote the complex linear space of meromorphic diﬀerentials ϕ(ζ)dζp on S
such that (ϕ) −a ≥0. The fundamental Riemann-Roch theorem says that
for p ≥1 we have
dimC Dp(a) = dimC D1−p(−a) + (2p −1)(g −1) −deg [a], g ≥0.
Let S be the closure S0 of the surface S0, and let a = n
j=1(−ζj), where ζj are
the punctures on S0 and  is understood as a formal sum. In this case, Dp(a)
coincides with the space Hp,0(S0). We have dimC D1−p(−a) > 0 if and only
if deg a > 2(p−1)(g −1) (see, e.g., [131]). It follows that under the condition
imposed on n we have dimC Dp(a) = dimC Hp,0(S0) = (2p −1)(g −1) + n,
that proves the lemma.
2
Lemma 5.2.3. Let ϕ(ζ)dζp ∈Hp,0(S0), ζ ∈S0. Let νj denote the order of
the zero of ϕ or the order of the pole of ϕ at ζj taken with the sign (-) if ζj is a
pole of ϕ. Then the number N of zeros of ϕ on S0 counted with multiplicities
is given by
N = −
n

j=1
νj + 2p(g −1).
Proof. This readily follows from the fact that the diﬀerential ϕ has degree
deg ϕ = 2p(g −1) on S0. Carrying the orders of the diﬀerential at the punc-
tures of S0 to the right-hand side, we obtain the assertion of the lemma.
2
Again, we consider S0 = U/G0, where G0 is the uniformizing Fuchsian
group with the unit disk U as a connected component of the set of dis-
continuity. Any fundamental polygon P in U is bounded by segments of
non-Euclidean lines and is convex in the non-Euclidean plane, its sides in
U are pairwise equivalent. Let p1, . . . , pr be the J-projection of the elliptic
and parabolic ﬁxed points of G0. The universal covering is branched over
S0 at the elliptic points. With each point pk we associate the number mk

where Aj, Bj are the hyperbolic generators and Ck the elliptic and parabolic

Lemma 5.2.4. For every point x ∈T(S0), there exist a Jordan domain
U(x) and 2g + r transformations z →Aj(z, x), z →Bj(z, x), z →Ck(z, x),
j = 1, . . . , g, k = 1, . . . , r of U such that
1) ∂U(x) is parameterized via a mapping z = σ(eiθ, x), where 0 ≤θ ≤2π;
σ(eiθ, 0) = eiθ; σ(·, x) depends holomorphically on x;
2) Aj(·, x), Bj(·, x), and Ck(·, x) satisfy the relation (5.4) and depend
holomorphically on z and x; they generate a quasi-Fuchsian group G(x), so
that G(0) = G0 and S(x) = U(x)/G(x) is a Riemann surface;
2) every Beltrami diﬀerential μ such that Φ(μ) = x, induces a quasicon-
formal map f x : S0 →S(x) such that the equivalence class represented by
the marked Riemann surface (S(x), f x) is the element x of the Teichm¨uller
space T(G0).
Proof. Let μx(z) = Φ−1(x) be a Beltrami diﬀerential which is compatible
with G0. There is a quasiconformal automorphism w = Ωm(z) on C with
the ﬁxed points −1, 1, and i, satisfying the Beltrami equation w¯z = mx wz,
where
mx(z) :=
μx(z), for z ∈U,
0,
for z ∈C \ U.
Set U(x) := Ωm(U). If we parameterize ∂U by (eiθ, 0 ≤θ < 2π), then
∂U(x) = {w : w = Ωm(eiθ =: σ(eiθ, x), 0 ≤θ < 2π}.
Since mx depends holomorphically on x, it follows that ωm and, hence,
σ(eiθ, x) also depens holomorphically on x. The mapping Ωm ◦Aj satisﬁes
the Beltrami equation
(Ωm ◦Aj)¯z = mx(z) (Ωm ◦Aj)z.
Therefore, there is a mapping Aj(z, x) of the domain U(x) onto itself that
depends holomorphically on z and is such that Aj(·, x)◦Ωm ≡Ωm◦Aj(·). Sim-
ilarly, starting with Bj and Cj, we obtain transformations Bj(z, x), Ck(z, x).
These transformations form a quasi-Fuchsian group G(x) = Ωm ◦G0 ◦Ω−1
m
acting on U(x). The hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic elements of G0 are

transformed into hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic elements of G(x) (see
[96]). Obviously, Aj(z, x), Bj(z, x), and Ck(z, x) satisfy the relation (5.4)
and depend holomorphically on x. The quotient U(x)/G(x) is a Riemann
surface S(x).
Let Jx stand for the projection U(x) →S(x). We deﬁne a quasiconformal
map f x : S0 →S(x) by the formula f x(ζ) := J ◦Ωm ◦(Jx)−1(ζ), ζ ∈S0.
Two diﬀerent Beltrami diﬀerentials μ1 and μ2, for which Φ(μ1) = Φ(μ2) = x,
deﬁne the maps Ω1 = Ωm1 and Ω2 = Ωm2, the corresponding domains U1(x)
and U2(x), the quasi-Fuchsian groups G1(x) and G2(x) acting on these do-
mains, and the marked Riemann surfaces (S1(x), [f x
1 ]) and (S2(x), [f x
2 ]). We
consider the conformal map given by H : U1(x) →U2(x) with the ﬁxed
boundary points −1, i, and 1. The deﬁnition of T(S0) implies that the con-
tinuous extension of the map Ω−1
2
◦H ◦Ω1 onto ∂U is identical on ∂U. This
means that, for the conformal map h := Jx
2 ◦H ◦(Jx
1 )−1: S1(x) →S2(x), the
map (f x
2 )−1 ◦h ◦f x
1 is homotopic to the identity on of S0, and the marked
Riemann surfaces (S1(x), [f x
1 ]) and (S2(x), [f x
2 ]) are equivalent and represent
the same x. This completes the proof of Lemma 5.2.4.
2
We will need the following statement.
Proposition 5.2.2 (Gardiner [43], Lemma 1, p.192; Strebel [141], Theorem
2.6, page 8). The maximal number of elements in an admissible system of
curves of type I on a Riemann surface of ﬁnite conformal type (g, n) is 3g −
3 + n.
5.3 Harmonic properties of the moduli
Suppose g = 0, i.e., we consider S0 to be the n-punctured Riemann sphere,
n ≥4 (of course, one can achieve the normalization S0 = C\{0, 1, ζ1, . . . , ζn−3}
by a M¨obius transform). An interesting question arises when we move locally
the punctures of S0. Namely, how the value of the modulus depends on the
values of these punctures. Generally (g ≥0) how the modulus m(S0, Γ, α)
changes under the variation of the conformal structure of S0. It is a simple
consequence from ([78], Theorem 5.2) that if g = 0, n = 4, then the mod-
ulus is a continuous and diﬀerentiable function of ζ1. Then, A. Yu. Solynin
and E. G. Emel’yanov (see Theorems 2.7.1, 2.7.2 and references thereafter)
proved that for any n (g = 0) the modulus is a diﬀerentiable function of the
parameters (ζ1, . . . , ζn−3).
The next step has been made by the author [155] who proved that for
n = 5 the modulus is a locally pluriharmonic function whenever the ex-
tremal diﬀerential ϕ has exactly two non-degenerate ring domains in its
trajectory structure. In the case of one degenerate ring domain the coun-
terexample has been constructed by A. Yu. Solynin (see his construction in
[151], and Theorem 5.3.1, the example thereafter). In [158] we conjectured

188
5. MODULI ON TEICHM¨ULLER SPACES
that for any ﬁnite g, n, m = 3g −3 + n > 0 the modulus is a locally har-
monic function with respect to the parameters of conformal structures of S0
when the extremal diﬀerential ϕ has the maximal (3g −3 + n) number of
non-degenerate ring domains in its trajectory structure. Later, this has been
proved by E. G. Emel’yanov [37] and by another method in [170].
We are aimed at local harmonic properties of m(x) on the Teichm¨uller
space T(S0) with the initial Riemann surface S0 of genus g with n possible
punctures such that 3g + n −3 > 0.
Theorem 5.3.1. Let m = 3g−3+n. Fix an admissible system of m curves Γ
and a weight vector α = (α1, . . . , αm) with positive coordinates αj. Construct
the modulus m(S0, Γ, α). Suppose that the extremal holomorphic quadratic
diﬀerential ϕ0 has exactly m non-degenerate ring domains in its trajectory
structure. Then, there exists a neighbourhood Ω of the initial point of the
Teichm¨uller space T(S0) such that the extension of the modulus m(x) is har-
monic in Ω.
Proof. The diﬀerential ϕ0 has exactly m non-degenerate ring domains in its
trajectory structure that is the maximal number due to Proposition 5.3.1.
There is a neighbourhood Ω of the origin of T(S0) such that for all x ∈Ω
the diﬀerential ϕx also has m non-degenerate ring domains in its trajectory
structure. As it has been remarked at the end of Section 5.2.1, it suﬃces to
prove that the extremal diﬀerential ϕx depends holomorphically on x in Ω.
Let us denote by q(x, z)dz2 the pull-back of the diﬀerential ϕx(ζ)dζ2 onto the
universal cover U(x) of the surface S(x) (here we use notations introduced in
Lemma 5.2.4). Lemma 5.2.2 implies that this diﬀerential can be represented
as
q(x, z)dz2 =
m

j=1
βj(x)pj(x, z)dz2,
(5.5)
where the diﬀerentials pj(x, z)dz2, j = 1, . . . , m form the basis of H2,0(S(x)),
and they are holomorphic with respect to x. Thus, it suﬃces to prove that
the coeﬃcients βj(x) are also holomorphic with respect to x. We denote by
q(z) ≡q(z, 0), pj(z) ≡pj(z, 0), D∗
k ≡D∗
k(0). We know (see Section 2.7) that
in each non-degenerate ring domain D∗
k(x), k = 1, . . . , m, in the trajectory
structure of the diﬀerential ϕx(ζ′)(dζ′)2, this diﬀerential is represented as
ϕx(ζ′)(dζ′)2 = −α2

(5.6)
where the parameter w is deﬁned in the annulus Kk(x) = {1 < |w| < Rk(x)},
M(D∗
k(x)) =
1
2π log Rk(x), and the parameter ζ′ is deﬁned in D∗
k(x). Now we
consider the equality (5.6) at the initial point x = 0 and rewrite it as
ϕ(ζ)dζ2 = −α2
kdv2
4π2v2 ,

where the parameter v is deﬁned in the annulus Kk = {1 < |v| < Rk},
M(D∗
k) =

2π log Rk, and the parameter ζ is deﬁned in D∗
k. Among all homo-
topic homeomorphisms f : S0 →S(x), that represent the point x ∈T(S0),
there is one that maps each D∗
k onto D∗
k(x). We denote it by f ∗. Its dilatation
μ∗
x holomorphically depends on x. Then the superposition w ◦f ∗◦ζ(v) maps
the ring Kk onto the ring Kk(x) as Kk →D∗
k →D∗
k(x) →Kk(x). It satisﬁes
in Kk the diﬀerential equation dw2/w2 = dv2/v2. Changing variables by (5.6,
5.7) and applying the representation (5.5) we have

Now we ﬁx 3g −3+n points vk in annuli Kk and obtain 3g −3+n images
zk(x) in U(x) which are holomorphic with respect to x. We choose the points
vk so that their images zk(x) are diﬀerent from the Weierstrass points of
order 2 (in Petersson’s sense, see [19]) of the surface S(x). All functions
dζ/dz, w ◦v(ζ), wζ are holomorphic with respect to x. Therefore, we have
obtained a system of m equations with respect to m unknowns βj(x) with
coeﬃcients which are holomorphic with respect to x.
In order to prove that the obtained system has a unique solution, we
note that since the points zk(x) are diﬀerent from the Weierstrass points, the
Wronskian for the basis of H2,0(S(x)) with respect to these points does not
vanish and the columns
[pj(z1(x), x), . . . , pj(zm(x), x)]′,
j = 1, . . . , m
are linearly independent. Therefore, the system has a unique solution for each
x which is holomorphic in x ∈Ω. This ends the proof.
2
Remark 5.3.1. Under the conditions of Theorem 5.3.1 the modulus m(x) is
locally harmonic in all points of T(S0) whenever the extremal diﬀerential ϕx
has 3g −3 (the maximal number by Proposition 5.2.2) non-degenerate ring
domains in its trajectory structure.
However, we can not speak about global pluriharmonicity of m(x). A
counterexample by A. Solynin shows this.
Counterexample. Let Γ be a homotopy class of simple loops that separate the
points 0, ∞and a, exp(iβ), exp(−iβ) where |a −1| < ε, arccos(1 −ε2/2) <
β < π/2, that are homotopic on C⧹{a, exp(iβ), exp(−iβ)} to the slit along
the ray [0, ∞]. Varying a in the neighbourhood of 1 we see that the modulus
of Γ attains its maximum at the whole arc of the unit circle exp(it), |t| <
arccos(1 −ε2/2) (the Mori domain). This contradicts the maximum modulus
property for harmonic functions.

190
5. MODULI ON TEICHM¨ULLER SPACES
Now let Γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) be an admissible system of m = 3g −3 + n
curves on a Riemann surface S0 and we choose a vector α = (α1, . . . , αm) so
that the extremal quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2 contains m non-degenerate
ring domains in its trajectory structure. We denote by m0 = m(S0, Γ, α) the
modulus in the corresponding modulus problem and let m(x) be its exten-
sion onto the Teichm¨uller space T0 which is harmonic in a neighbourhood Ω
of the origin of T(S0). Now we deﬁne another admissible system of curves
Γ = (γ1, . . . , γk) ⊂Γ, k < m, and with the vector α = (α1, . . . , αk) let us
deﬁne the modulus problem and denote by m(x) the extension of the modu-
lus m0 = m(S0, Γ, α). Then the metric

|ϕ(ζ)||dζ| is admissible in the latter
modulus problem with the modulus m0 as well as the metric

|ϕx(ζ′)||dζ′|
is admissible in the modulus problem with the modulus m(x). Therefore, the
inequality m(x) ≤m(x) holds in Ω. Reciprocally, if an admissible system is
incomplete, then we always can construct a complete one so that the corre-
sponding modulus for the complete system is harmonic. Thus we come to the
following result.
Corollary 5.3.1. The extension m(x) of the modulus m0 = m(S0, Γ, α) is a
subharmonic function in the whole Teichm¨uller space T(S0) for any admis-
sible system Γ and a weight vector α.
Remark 5.3.2. Let us ﬁx an admissible system Γ and a weight vector α. The
maximum principle for subharmonic functions asserts that m(x) never attains
its maximum in T(S0). We observe now that m(x) has no local extrema in
T(S0). Indeed, let us consider the coupling ⟨μ∗, q⟩in the variational formula
in Theorem 2.2. If we ﬁx μ∗∈L∞(U, G0) and ⟨μ∗, q⟩= 0 for all q ∈Q(G0),
then μ∗∈N(G0) and represents the origin of H(G0) = L∞(U, G0)/N(G0),
dimC H(G0) = 3g −3 + n. The complex dimension of the cotangent space
Q(G0) is also 3g −3+n. This means, that if we ﬁx q ∈Q(G0) and ⟨μ∗, q⟩= 0
for all μ∗∈H(G0), then q ≡0. But q(z)dz2 is the pull-back of the ex-
tremal quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2, in other words, the linear term in the
variational formula is never 0.
5.4 Descriptions of the Teichm¨uller metric
Now let S0 be again a hyperbolic Riemann surface of ﬁnite type (g, n, l) with
boundary when l ̸= 0. If f1 and f2 are homeomorphisms of S0 onto itself and
f1 is homotopic to f2, then they map any simple loop γ on S0 onto γ1 = f1(γ)
and γ2 = f2(γ) and γ1 is homotopic to γ2 on S0. The reverse statement is false.
A simple example shows this: S0 = {z : r ≤|z| ≤1/r, 0 < r < 1}, f1 = z,
f2 = 1/z, z ∈S0. In this section we show that we can use only homotopy
of curves instead of homotopy of homeomorphisms for the deﬁnition of the
Teichm¨uller metric. Given an admissible system γ of curves of type I,II on S0

5.4 Descriptions of the Teichm¨uller metric

and the weight vector α we deﬁne the modulus m(S0, Γ, α). Let m(x) stand
for this modulus extended onto the Teichm¨uller space T(S0).

T(S0) is described as
τT (x, y) = sup

where (f1(S0), f1) and (f2(S0), f2) are the marked Riemann surfaces repre-
senting x and y respectively.
We remark here that a similar description was obtained by S. Kerckhoﬀ
[69] for compact and punctured Riemann surfaces in terms of the Ahlfors-
Beurling extremal length, so we will better prove the following theorem giving
the description in terms of the functional s(x).
Let ϕ ∈Q(S0) be the space of all holomorphic quadratic diﬀerentials with
ﬁnite trajectories on S0. Then, each ϕ deﬁnes the vector b = (b1, . . . , bm)
with positive coordinates, and the system γ = (γ1, . . . , γm) of its non-critical
trajectories is an admissible system of curves on S0. We deﬁne the functional
sϕ(x), x ∈T(S0), as in Theorem 5.2.2.
Theorem 5.4.2. Let ϕ ∈Q(S0). Then the Teichm¨uller metric τT (x, y) on
the Teichm¨uller space T(S0) is described as
τT (x, y) =
sup
ϕ∈Q(S0)
1
2
 log sϕ(x)
sϕ(y)
.
Proof. Without loss of generality one can assume x = 0. We denote by
s(0, x) :=
sup
ϕ∈Q(S0)
1
2
 log sϕ(0)
sϕ(x)
.
(5.8)
First we will show that s(0, x) is a metric and then, that τT (0, x) = s(0, x).
1) There exists a ﬁnite supremum in (5.8). This follows from Proposition
5.2.1, because the inequality there does not depend on ϕ. So for any ﬁxed x
the value s(0, x) is uniquely deﬁned and ﬁnite.
2) The obvious triangle inequality s(0, x) + s(x, y) ≥s(0, y) is satisﬁed.
Moreover, if x = 0, then f μ, where Φ(μ) = 0, is homotopic to the identity,
μ ∈I(G0) and s(0, 0) = 0.
3) If s(0, 0) = 0, then x = 0 (so we prove that s(x, y) is a metric). We
suppose the contrary, i.e., x ̸= 0. Then there exists a Teichm¨uller diﬀerential
μ = t|ψ|/ψ, such that the equivalence class with the representative μ is the
point x ∈T(S0), and where 0 < t < 1, ψ(ζ)dζ2 is a holomorphic quadratic
diﬀerential on S0 with ∥ψ∥< ∞.
Proposition 2.6.3 implies that for any ε > 0 there exists a holomorphic
quadratic diﬀerential ϕ with ﬁnite trajectories and of ﬁnite norm such that

192
5. MODULI ON TEICHM¨ULLER SPACES
∥μ −ν∥∞< ε where ν = t|ϕ|/ϕ. The diﬀerential ϕ ∈Q(S0) deﬁnes a vector
b = (b1, . . . , bm) with positive coordinates and the admissible system of curves
γ = (γ1, . . . , γm). Let S = f ν(S0), y = Φ(ν). Then, the map f ν is aﬃne in the
local coordinates z =
 √ϕ in each ring domain Dj in the trajectory structure
of ϕ on S0. Hence, this map realizes the equality signs in Proposition 5.2.1
and sϕ(y) = Ksϕ(0), where K = (1 + t)/(1 −t). Since s(0, x) = 0, for any
quadratic diﬀerential ϕ ∈Q(S0)
sϕ(x) = sϕ(0).
(5.9)
Now we construct the mapping F : S →S0 →f μ(S0). Its complex dilatation
is
μF = μ −ν
1 −¯μν
f ν
ζ
f ν
ζ
and ∥μF ∥∞< ε/(1 −t2). Now we ﬁnd in the equivalence class [μF ] the
Teichm¨uller diﬀerential μ0 which has the norm ∥μ0∥= ε1 ≤∥μF ∥due to its
minimal property.
The mappings F ◦f ν, f μ form the same quadratic diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, x)dζ2
from the initial diﬀerential ϕ(ζ)dζ2. The mapping F generates this diﬀerential
as an image of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, y)dζ2 on the surface S.
The variational formula of Theorem 5.2.2 yields
sϕ(x) = sϕ(y) + 2ε1Re

S
μ∗qνdσζ + o(ε1),
where μ∗is a unit vector of the tangent space to T(S0) at the point y and
qν is a pull-back of the diﬀerential ϕ(ζ, y)dζ2. This implies
sϕ(x) −sϕ(0) =
2t
1 −tsϕ(0) + 2ε1Re

S
μ∗qνdσζ + o(ε1).
(5.10)
The right-hand side is strictly positive for a suﬃciently small ε and, hence,
ε1. This contradicts (5.9) and completes the proof of 3).
4) Prove that the obtained metric s(0, x) is equal to τT (0, x).
Let x ∈T(S0) be diﬀerent from the origin, μ = t|ψ|/ψ be a Teichm¨uller
diﬀerential such that Φ(μ) = x. If ψ is a diﬀerential with ﬁnite trajecto-
ries, then we consider it’s non-freely homotopic non- critical trajectories
(γ1, . . . , γm) as an admissible system of curves. There are exactly m char-
acteristic ring domains (D1, . . . , Dm) in its trajectory structure. Assume
(b1, . . . , bm) the vector of the length of connected arcs of the orthogonal tra-
jectories of ψ situated in each Dj. By these data we construct the functional
sψ(x). The Teichm¨uller mapping f μ acts aﬃnely in each characteristic do-
main Dj, and therefore, either sψ(x) = Ksψ(0) or sψ(x) = sψ(x)/K. This
means that s(0, x) = 1
2 log 1+t
1−t = τT (0, x).

5.5 Invariant metrics
193
If ψ is an arbitrary holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential on S0, then for any
ε we can approximate it by diﬀerentials ϕε with ﬁnite trajectories as in 3).
The variation (5.10) implies
τT (0, x) −ε ≤1
2
 log sϕε(x)
sϕε(0)
 < s(0, x) ≤τT (0, x).
Thus, s(0, x) = τT (0, x), that ﬁnishes the proof.

5.5 Invariant metrics
The Teichm¨uller space T(g, n) is a (3g−3+n)-dimensional hyperbolic complex
analytic manifold and one can deﬁne on it biholomorphically invariant metrics
that generalize the Poincar´e hyperbolic metric. Namely, we will consider the
Kobayashi and Carath´eodory metrics kT (x, y) and cT (x, y), x, y ∈T(g, n)
metrics. For their deﬁnitions and properties we refer to [43], [75], [113].
Let S0 = U/G0 and q(z)dz2 be a holomorphic quadratic diﬀerential in U,
q(γ(z))(γ′(z))2 = q(z) for any γ ∈G0. A geodesic in the Teichm¨uller metric
disk which is the embedding of the unit disk in the Teichm¨uller space T(S0)
by Δq := {Φ(t¯q/|q|), t ∈U} is called the Teichm¨uller disk.
Denote by d(·, ·) the usual hyperbolic Poincar´e metric in the unit disk U:
d(z1, z2) = 1
2 log
1 +
 z1−z2
1−z1¯z2

1 −
 z1−z2
1−z1¯z2

.
Let X, A, B be complex analytic manifolds and Hol (A, B) be the class of
all holomorphic mappings from A to B. The Kobayashi semimetric kX(x, y)
on X is the biggest among the semimetrics ρ in X satisfying the inequal-
ity ρ(f(z1), f(z2)) ≤d(z1, z2) for any f ∈Hol (U, X); z1, z2 ∈U. The
Carath´eodory semimetric cX(x, y) is the smallest among the semimetrics ρ
in X satisfying the inequality ρ(x, y) ≥d(f(x), f(y)) for any f ∈Hol (X, U);
x, y ∈T(g, n). Both semimetrics on X satisfy the main properties of the
hyperbolic Poincar´e metric: holomorphic contractibility (analogously to the
Schwarz lemma) and biholomorphic invariance. In particular, if X is a sub-
manifold of T(g, n), then cX(x, y) ≥cT (x, y). On the Teichm¨uller space
and on its submanifolds both semimetrics are metrics. The Kobayashi met-
ric is inner, i.e., it can be restored by its inﬁnitesimal generator, but the
Carath´eodory metric is not. This seems to be the main diﬀerence between
the metrics. Besides, kX(x, y) ≥cX(x, y).
The Kobayashi metric was completely described by H. Royden [117] in
1971 for T(g, 0) and by C. Earle, I. Kra [32], [20] in 1974 for T(g, n). They
showed that kT (x, y) = τT (x, y). For the Teichm¨uller space T(0, 4) the met-
rics kT (x, y), cT (x, y) are the same because this space is holomorphically

194
5. MODULI ON TEICHM¨ULLER SPACES
equivalent to a hyperbolic domain in C. In [20] W. Abikoﬀ, C. Earle, I. Kra
posed a problem whether these metrics are the same on any Teichm¨uller
space. In 1981 S. Krushkal [72] (see also [75]) constructed an example show-
ing that for 3g −3 + n > 2, n ≥1, g > 2 and for every x ∈T(g, n) there is
a point y ∈T(g, n) such that kX(x, y) > cX(x, y). In the same year I. Kra
[70] obtained an aﬃrmative result in this direction. Namely, he proved that
in the Teichm¨uller disks Δq, such that q is a square of an Abelian holomor-
phic diﬀerential on S0, the metrics coincide. Then there appeared some works
of negative sense. In particular, it was shown that the Bers embedding into
T(g, n) (see [11]) is not geodesic in the Carath´eodory metric (S. Nag [103]).
Then the analogous result was obtained by S. Krushkal [73] for the universal
Teichm¨uller space and for the general case of inﬁnite dimensional Teichm¨uller
space it was proved in the Ph.D. thesis of L. Liu [93]. For the universal Te-
ichm¨uller space H. Shiga and H. Tonigawa [127] have presented an example of
a non-Abelian Teichm¨uller disk where the metrics are the same. This result
was obtained by a quasiconformal variation of Grunski coeﬃcients.
The following results apply harmonic properties of the functionals m(x),
s(x) and variational formulae from Theorems 5.2.1, 5.2.2 for suﬃcient condi-
tions for Teichm¨uller disks or their subdisks to be geodesic in the Carath´eodory
metric.
Theorem 5.5.1. Let Xr = {x : x ∈T(g, n), τT (0, x) < r}. If ϕ is an ex-
tremal quadratic diﬀerential for the functional m(x) at the point x = 0, q its
pull-back onto the universal covering U, and m(x) is pluriharmonic on Xr,
then on Δq ∩Xr the Teichm¨uller-Kobayashi metric τT and the Carath´eodory
metric cXr are the same. In particular, this statement is true for the entire
T(g, n) when r →∞and Xr →T(g, n).
Proof. Obviously we may assume that x = 0. The same argumentation is
applied to an arbitrary x making use of quasiconformal shifts.
We invoke the inﬁnitesimal description of the Carath´eodory metric:
c∗
Xr(x, v) = sup
h
|h∗(v)|,
where x and v lie in the tangent space to T at x ∈Xr, h belongs to the space
Hol(Xr, U) of all holomorphic mappings from Xr to U and satisﬁes h(x) = 0,
and h∗is the diﬀerential of h.
Since T(g, n) and Xr are simply connected (3g −3+n)-dimensional com-
plex analytic manifolds, there exists a holomorphic mapping Λ(x) such that
Re Λ(x) = m(x)/m(0), Im Λ(0) = 0. Also, we consider the function
F(x) = Λ(x) −1
Λ(x) + 1,
F(0) = 0,
F ∈Hol(Xr, C). By an obvious inequality for the moduli of families of homo-
topy classes of curves, we have

5.5 Invariant metrics
195
e−2r < exp(−2τT (0, x)) ≤Re Λ(x) ≤exp(2τT (0, x)) < e2r,
where τT (·, ·) is the Teichm¨uller metric on T(g, n). Therefore, F ∈Hol(Xr, U).
We put h(t) = F ◦Φ(tμ0), where μ0 = ¯ϕ/|ϕ|. Then h(t) satisﬁes the con-
ditions of the Schwarz lemma, whence |h′(0)| ≤1. Calculating h′(0) explicitly
with the help of Theorem 5.2.1, we obtain
h′(0) = −

m(0)

ϕμ0 dσζ = −1.
Hence,
c∗

Φ(0), ∂Φ(tμ0)

The results by E. Vezentini [172] and I. Kra [70] imply that Φ(tμ0), where |t| <
k = (e2r −1)/(e2r +1), is a complex geodesic in the Carath´eodory metric cXr,
i.e., cXr(Φ(t1μ0), Φ(t2μ0)) = d(t1, t2), where d(·, ·) is the hyperbolic Poincar´e
metric on U. Now, Δϕ is geodesic in the metric τT , that proves the theorem.

Theorem 5.5.2. If ϕ is an extremal quadratic diﬀerential for the functional
s(x) at the point x = 0, q its pull-back onto the universal covering U, and
s(x) is pluriharmonic on Xr, then on Δq ∩Xr the Teichm¨uller-Kobayashi
metric τT and the Carath´eodory metric cXr are the same. In particular, this
statement is true for the entire T(g, n) when r →∞and Xr →T(g, n).
Thus, for the coincidence of three metrics cT , τT , kT on the Teichm¨uller
disk Δq it is suﬃcient to check whether one of the functionals m(x), s(x) gen-
erated by a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ is pluriharmonic on T(g, n) or whether
ϕ has even zeros on S0. Note that the coincidence of the metrics implies a
progress in solution of extremal problems for compact classes of quasiconfor-
mal maps [74].
Harmonic moduli in Theorem 5.3.1 show that Theorems 5.5.1, 5.5.2 are
sensible.
The modulus problem (2.12)–(2.13) reﬂects the Dirichlet principle. Namely,
we are given a Riemann surface S0 of a ﬁnite type (g, n, l) possessing a com-
plex structure, and a free family of homotopy classes of curves of the ﬁrst and
second types on S0. The Dirichlet problem consists of ﬁnding the minimum of
L1-norm of a quadratic diﬀerential ϕ corresponding to the complex structure
of S0 among all diﬀerentials of the given homotopy type from the free family.
The trajectories of this diﬀerential have the lengths in the metric

|ϕ| which
are not less than preassigned positive numbers. The Dirichlet principle states
that there exists a unique diﬀerential realizing this minimum. In this case
the Dirichlet principle is a particular case of the modulus problem when we
take only metrics

|ϕ| from the class of all admissible metrics. The results

196
5. MODULI ON TEICHM¨ULLER SPACES
by J. Jenkins and K. Strebel establish that the solutions of both problems
involve the same metric.
A similar approach was suggested by W. Thurston and described in [39].
It also displays the Dirichlet principle. In the space of all homotopy classes
of curves one can introduce measured foliations. One looks for a minimum
of the L1-norm in the space of diﬀerentials having reduced heights of curves
from a given homotopy class in the metric |i √ϕ| not less than the height of
this class with respect to a precise measured foliation. A foliation is assigned
by formal multiplication of homotopy classes by positive numbers. Each class
becomes a ray of the foliation.
The norm of a measured foliation plays a similar role as the norm of
the extremal quadratic diﬀerential in a modulus problem. One can derive a
description of the Teichm¨uller metric and results about the harmonic prop-
erties of this norm in connection with invariant metrics of Kobayashi and
Carath´eodory similar to those for the modulus. For deﬁnition of the norm
and properties of measured foliations we refer to [39], [43], [60].
Results of this chapter were obtained in [151], [152], [153], [154], [155],
[160], [170].
