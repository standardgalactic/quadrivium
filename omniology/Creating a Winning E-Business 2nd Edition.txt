PREFACE
Creating a Winning E-Business, Second Edition provides general business students, graduate stu-
dents, continuing education students, executive education seminar participants, and entrepre-
neurs with practical ideas on planning and creating an e-business. We assume that readers have
no previous e-business knowledge or experience. This book is designed to help you learn about
the key business elements involved in planning and starting an e-business from the ground up.
When we began teaching both an executive education seminar and an MBA-level course in
planning and starting an e-business, we found many textbooks that emphasized the technological
aspects of electronic commerce, but we did not find a textbook that focused on the planning and
startup phases of an e-business. Creating a Winning E-Business, Second Edition is our attempt to
fill that void.
Organization and Coverage
This book takes a practical, case-based, hands-on approach to planning and starting an
e-business. Numerous real-world e-business examples are used in each chapter to illustrate impor-
tant concepts. Additionally, the evolution of a real-world e-business, Rackspace Managed Hosting,
is featured throughout the book, from the e-business’s conceptual stage through its Web page
design and operations phases. Important topics covered in the book include:
●
the global e-business economy and e-business models (Chapter 1)
●
the e-business entrepreneurial process and how to exploit e-business advantages
(Chapter 2)
●
the elements of an e-business plan (Chapter 3)
●
financing options for an e-business startup (Chapter 4)
●
e-business startup challenges, such as identifying legal issues, selecting office space,
hiring employees, identifying electronic payment methods, and selecting appropriate
e-business technologies (Chapter 5)
●
effective tools for branding and marketing an e-business and its products or services
(Chapter 6)
●
affiliate marketing programs as both a marketing tool and a source of revenue
(Chapter 7)
●
Web site accessibility, usability, and design (Chapter 8)
●
Web site development and performance measurement tools, including markup lan-
guages and Web analytics (Chapter 9)
●
E-business risk management and security (Chapter 10)

Features
Creating a Winning E-Business is unique in its field because it includes the following
features:
●
Opening and Closing Case: A real-world e-business case opens and closes each
chapter and provides a unifying theme for the chapter. At the beginning of the
chapter, the case establishes background elements and introduces relevant
issues. At the end of the chapter, the case concludes with a discussion of
whether those relevant issues were resolved and how they were resolved.
●
E-Case in Progress: A real-world e-business, Rackspace Managed Hosting, is
used throughout the text to illustrate the processes involved with starting a
new e-business.
●
E-Cases and E-Pioneers: Other real-world e-business examples are used
throughout the text to illustrate key concepts and to show the impact of deci-
sions made by real-life entrepreneurs. A table of these e-cases appears on the
inside front cover of the book.
●
Numerous illustrations: The text of the chapter is well supported with many
conceptual figures and screenshots of e-business Web sites.
●
Quotes on Success: Quotes are presented from real-world entrepreneurs and
others involved in starting, building, operating, and securing e-businesses.
●
Tips: Each chapter has multiple tip boxes that contain useful information
about individual topics.
●
Chapter Summary: Each chapter concludes with a summary that concisely
recaps the most important concepts in the chapter.
●
Checklist: Following the Chapter Summary is a checklist of the major con-
cepts discussed in the chapter. Students can use this checklist to establish
reference points from the chapter concepts to their own e-business—-
whether it is a real-world or classroom-based e-business.
●
Key Terms: Following the Checklist is a list of key terms used in the
chapter. These key terms are bolded in the chapter text and defined in the
Glossary at the end of the book.
●
Review Questions and Exercises: Every chapter concludes with meaning-
ful review materials that include both objective questions and hands-on
exercises. Many exercises guide students toward investigating chapter top-
ics and creating hardcopy materials (in the form of reports or tables) from
their findings, and then using these materials to engage in discussions
with their fellow classmates. One of the exercises in Chapter 9, for
example, asks students to use links from this text’s student online com-
panion to visit e-business Web sites that focus on providing Web analytics
products. Students are asked to take a product tour at each site, summa-
rize what they have learned about each Web analytics vendor and its prod-
ucts, and then use their summaries to direct a discussion with a group of
classmates on the Web analytics tools available to a startup e-business.
xvi
Creating a Winning E-Business, Second Edition

●
Case Projects: The chapters contain two to three case projects, each of
which is based on a fictional but realistic startup e-business scenario. Stu-
dents are required to apply concepts discussed in the chapter to the sce-
nario to create a case project solution. These projects can be completed
individually or in groups.
●
Team Project: Each chapter contains a specially designed team project
that allows two to three students to work toward the project solution and
then make a formal presentation of that solution to fellow classmates.
Team members must work together to name and describe a startup
e-business, and complete the project by implementing key concepts from
the chapter. This format allows multiple teams to work on the same
project and arrive at different solutions. An important aspect of the Team
Project is that students are required to prepare a 5-10 slide presentation
illustrating their project solution, and then use these presentation materi-
als to formally present this project solution to the class. This allows stu-
dents to both understand the practical application of key concepts and to
experience and practice important presentation skills.
●
For Further Study: Every chapter contains a list of references to online
magazine articles and reports, print magazine articles, newspaper articles,
journal papers, and books that students can read to learn more about the
topics discussed in the chapter.
●
End Notes: Every chapter contains an extensive list of references tied
directly to chapter concepts.
●
Glossary: A glossary containing key terms and their definitions appears at the
end of the text.
●
Appendix, Microsoft FrontPage Tutorial: A short appendix is included that
introduces how a Microsoft FrontPage wizard can be used to create a Web site.
Students may be directed to use this appendix to create a simple e-business
Web site to complement various case or team project solutions.
●
Student Online Companion: Connects concepts from the book to the Web at

From its inception in 1984 to the early 1990s, Spokane, Washington-based Egghead Soft-
ware enjoyed great success as the first nationwide chain of stores that sold only software.
The chain grew to comprise more than 200 stores, employing thousands of workers and
earning millions of dollars in revenues. Egghead’s success attracted competitors, includ-
ing mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and CompUSA, who began selling software at dis-
counted prices. As software prices fell, Egghead was unable to compete successfully and
began suffering operating losses.
Needing a change in direction, in the mid-1990s the Egghead board of directors turned
to George Orban, a longtime Egghead investor with a track record for turning around fail-
ing businesses. Orban, who joined Egghead as chairman and CEO, believed that the only
way to save Egghead was to simplify the business by closing stores, cutting costs, and bet-
ter identifying the company’s target market. He began Egghead’s turnaround with a mas-
sive cost-cutting program that involved closing more than 70 stores and a distribution
center, selling real estate holdings, and laying off hundreds of employees. The merchan-
dise at some of the remaining stores was switched to a more profitable product mix that
included computer systems and accessories. Hoping to attract new customers and
increase sales, Egghead also began selling software and computer systems through an
online store.1 Would these changes be enough to save Egghead?

Commerce, the exchange of valuable goods or services, has been conducted for thousands
of years. Traditionally, commerce involved bringing traders, buyers, and sellers together
in a physical marketplace to exchange information, products, services, and payments.
Today, many business transactions occur across a telecommunications network where
buyers, sellers, and others involved in the business transaction (such as the employees who
process transactions) rarely see or know each other and may be anywhere in the world.
This process of buying and selling of products and services across a telecommunications
network is often called electronic commerce or e-commerce.
Many people use the term “e-commerce” in a broader sense: to encompass not only
the buying and selling of goods, but also the delivery of information, the providing of cus-
tomer service before and after a sale, the collaboration with business partners, and the
effort to enhance productivity within organizations. Others refer to this broader spectrum
of business activities that can be conducted over the Internet as e-business. Most people
today use the terms “e-commerce” (in its broadest sense) and “e-business” interchangeably.
In this book, we use the term “e-business” to indicate the widest spectrum of business
activities that use Internet and Web technologies.
The initial development of e-business transactions began more than thirty years ago
when banks began transferring money to each other by using electronic funds transfer
(EFT), and when large companies began sharing transaction information with their sup-
pliers and customers via electronic data interchange (EDI). Using EDI, companies elec-
tronically exchange information that used to be traditionally submitted on paper forms,
such as invoices, purchase orders, quotes, and bills of lading. This exchange occurs both
with suppliers and customers (often called trading partners). These transmissions gener-
ally occur over private telecommunications networks called value-added networks, or
VANs. Because of the expense of setting up and maintaining these private networks and the
costs associated with creating a standard interface between companies, implementing EDI
has usually been beyond the financial reach of small and medium-sized companies.
Today, companies of all sizes use a less expensive network alternative to VANs for the
exchange of information, products, services, and payments—the Internet. Global access to
the Internet and the Web has changed the way people and businesses around the world
communicate.

Almost a billion people worldwide use the Internet to shop for products and services, lis-
ten to music, view artwork, conduct research, get stock quotes, keep up-to-date with cur-
rent events, chat with each other, upload and download electronic files, send e-mail, and
much more.3
What Is the Internet?
To understand the Internet, you must first become familiar with computer networks. A
computer network is a group of two or more computers linked by cables, telephone lines,
or other wired or wireless media (Figure 1-1). A network of linked computers usually
includes special computers called servers that give users access to shared resources such
as electronic files, programs, printers, and connections to other networks, such as the
Internet. The Internet is a worldwide public network that connects private networks (Fig-
ure 1-2).

A Brief History of the Internet
The Internet originated in the late 1960s, when scientists sponsored by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense developed a network called the Advanced Research Projects Agency Net-
work or ARPANET. Quickly realizing the usefulness of such a network, researchers at
colleges and universities soon began using ARPANET to share data. In the 1980s, the mili-
tary portion of ARPANET became a separate network called the MILNET. The National Sci-
ence Foundation (NSF) began overseeing the remaining nonmilitary portions, called the
NSFnet, which connected hundreds of colleges, universities, and research centers. During
this time, commercial activity over the NSFnet was prohibited by law. Restrictions on
commercial activity over the NSFnet were lifted in 1991, and in the spring of 1995, the NSF-
net was replaced by high-speed telecommunications backbones, or main networks, oper-
ated by commercial network providers, such as AT&T and MCI—thereby creating the
Internet as we know it today.4
To connect to the Internet, individuals and businesses generally use some type of physi-
cal communications media, such as a network cable, phone line, or, as is increasingly true
these days, wireless media. In addition to some form of media, individuals and small-to-
medium sized businesses seeking access to the Internet usually need the services of an
Internet service provider (ISP)—an e-business that provides access to the Internet for a
fee. Examples of ISPs include America Online, Netscape Network, EarthLink, NetZero, and
Road Runner. Large businesses, colleges, universities, and government institutions may
have a computer network that is connected directly to the Internet. Figure 1-3 illus-
trates an example of an ISP.

A Brief History of the World Wide Web
In 1989, a software consultant named Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN (the Euro-
pean Laboratory for Particle Physics) in Switzerland, where he was trying to find ways to
improve information sharing and document handling between the lab’s research
scientists. Building on the concept of hypertext, where text on one page links to text on
another page, Berners-Lee developed the first computer programs that could be used to
store, access, and view hypertext-linked pages. Berners-Lee called his system of linked
documents the “WorldWideWeb,” which we now call the World Wide Web or simply the
Web.5
The Web is a subset of the Internet consisting of computers called Web servers on
which documents that are linked together by hypertext links, or hyperlinks, are stored. A
hyperlink can be text or a picture that is associated with the location (path and file-
name) of another document. The hyperlinked documents, called Web pages, can contain
text, graphics, video, and audio, as well as hyperlinks to other Web pages. A group of related
Web pages is called a Web site. The program used to access and view Web pages stored on
a Web server is called a Web browser. The most popular Web browser at this writing is
Internet Explorer®. Other popular Web browsers include Mozilla Firefox™, Netscape®, and
Opera®. Figure 1-4 illustrates the Mozilla Web page.

Many companies are increasingly using a company intranet for internal business trans-
actions and the exchange of information between employees. An intranet uses Internet and
Web technologies to allow employees within a company to view and use internal Web sites
that are not accessible to anyone outside the company. Intranet Web sites provide an
interface to internal systems such as accounting, customer relationship management, and
other company operating systems. Transactions between two or more companies can be
conducted over the Internet or over a private network called an extranet. An extranet con-
sists of two or more company intranets connected via the Internet. Using an extranet, the
participating companies can view the other company’s data and complete business
transactions.

Internet and Web Demographics
Determining how many individuals are online around the world and which Internet services
they are using can be difficult. Research and marketing groups publish various estimates
on a regular basis. However, because of the dynamic growth of the Internet, these esti-
mates become outdated quickly. Additionally, there are differences among the various esti-
mates due to differences in how Internet access and Web content are defined, which survey
FIGURE 1-4

and calculation methods are used, and how the data are gathered. Furthermore, the sheer
speed of change in Internet access and the rapid evolution of online content make esti-
mating current growth and predicting future growth difficult at best.
However, there is one thing all growth estimates and predictions have in common: They
indicate that the remarkable growth of Internet access from year to year shows no sign of
abating. For example, World Internet Stats reports that worldwide Internet access
increased from approximately 360.9 million people in 2000 to approximately 888.7 mil-
lion people in 2005—an increase of more than 146 percent in five years!6
Along with increased Internet access, the amount of information available on the Web
is growing very rapidly. In fact, IDC Research expects that in the near future, Internet users
worldwide will exchange information equivalent in volume to the entire Library of Con-
gress more than 64,000 times every day.7
Given that global Internet access and the growth of Web content has changed our every-
day lives, it should not be surprising that the Internet and the Web have also trans-
formed the way buyers, sellers, employees, and business intermediaries interact with each
other to conduct business transactions.

The widespread electronic linking of individuals and businesses around the world has
created an economic environment in which time and space are no longer limiting factors;
the business value of information is more important than before and information itself is
more accessible; traditional business intermediaries are being replaced by new business
intermediaries; and buyers are growing more powerful. In the past, some large compa-
nies were able to conduct their business transactions electronically using EDI and private
networks, but the high costs associated with EDI prevented most businesses from using the
technology. The Internet has leveled the playing field by making it easier and cheaper for
companies of all sizes to transact business and exchange information electronically.
As many of the business limitations of space and time disappear with the emergence
of the Internet, businesses that once had geographically limited customer and competitor
bases are finding that the whole world is now both customer and competitor. In addi-
tion, millions of companies that previously engaged in business transactions only during tra-
ditional hours now conduct those transactions online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
T I P
Internet users are eagerly adopting wireless Internet access as the number of wireless devices and Inter-
net applications grows. In the U.S., the number of wireless Internet subscribers is expected to explode to
more than 84 million, with businesses making up almost 60 percent of all subscribers.8

Competing for Customers
The Tattered Cover Book Store, a popular independent bookstore with three stores
in the Denver, Colorado area, has been doing business successfully for over 30 years.
The Tattered Cover Book Store has traditionally competed with other local Denver
bookstores, but these days, it must also compete with online bookstores such as
Amazon.com and Barnes&Noble.com. To contend with this online competition, the
Tattered Cover Bookstore added its own online bookstore (Figure 1-5), where cus-
tomers can buy books and gift certificates. The online store also provides special
customer services around the clock, including a schedule of upcoming special events
and personalized search requests for hard-to-find books.9
While the Internet and the Web are providing online opportunities for sellers, it is buy-
ers who are dramatically gaining new economic power. Internet and Web access has
changed many buyers’ expectations about how quickly transactions can be processed and
how convenient it should be to access information about competing products and services.
With Internet and Web access, buyers no longer have to travel to various physical loca-
tions to compare prices and features of the products or services they need—competing
businesses that offer unique services, lower costs, or products with the best features are just
a mouse click away!
FIGURE 1-5

In addition to accessing the Web sites of various sellers directly, buyers can take advan-
tage of online shopping sites such as Shopzilla shopping search and NexTag. Buyers use
these online shopping sites to quickly locate and compare the prices and availability of prod-
ucts offered by multiple online stores. Generally, these shopping sites gather and publish
buyer ratings on the products (which may include items such as digital cameras, laptop
computers, and flat screen LCD projection TVs) as well as the online stores that sell them.
Figure 1-6 illustrates an online shopping site.
Because information is easier to customize than hard goods, many companies are find-
ing that the information portion of their products or services is becoming a larger part of
the total value they offer customers. For example, office product suppliers, such as Staples,
have discovered that they can increase online sales by creating custom options for buy-
ers, such as customized product catalogs that list only frequently purchased items or those
items and prices negotiated by contract.
The ready access to consumer information via the Internet and the Web has empow-
ered buyers and dramatically changed how many business transactions are
conducted—even relatively substantial ones such as the buying and selling of cars and
trucks. An automotive industry information provider that pioneered the offering of automo-
tive information online is Edmunds. Edmunds, founded in 1966, publishes a number of
automobile and truck reviews and pricing guides. In the mid-1990s, Edmunds introduced
its Web site, Edmunds.com, which is a valuable online source for information about new
and used vehicles, including pricing, dealer cost and holdbacks, reliability, buying advice,
and product reviews. The Edmunds.com Web site provides a marketplace for buying and
selling used vehicles, as well as information about financing, insurance, and other areas of
interest for someone involved in buying or selling a vehicle. Competing with Edmunds.com
are other automotive industry information and sales e-businesses such as eBay Motors,
FIGURE 1-6
Shopzilla

Automotive.com, Autobytel.com, and CarsDirect.com. In addition to consulting these infor-
mation and sales Web sites, buyers can visit sites such as CARFAX and AutoCheck to pur-
chase a complete history on a given used car before making the purchase. Figures 1-7
and 1-8 show automotive information Web sites.

In a global economy where buyers located anywhere in the world are linked directly
to sellers who are also located anywhere in the world, traditional business intermediaries,
such as distributors and agents, are being threatened—and new kinds of intermediaries are
emerging. For example, brick-and-mortar travel agents are being replaced by travel industry
e-businesses, such as Travelocity, and traditional brokerage firms are losing business to
online trading services, such as E*TRADE Financial.
Global access to the Internet and the Web has led to the development of a new kind
of e-business intermediary, one that organizes information on the basis of customer needs.
The Internet Truckstop is an example of this new type of middleman—an online service
that gathers information from truckers, trucking companies, brokers, shippers, freight
forwarders, and others in the trucking industry and then makes that information avail-
able to subscribers for a fee. Figures 1-9 and 1-10 illustrate examples of new e-business
intermediaries.
Access to the Internet and the Web has created a business environment in which time
and distance have less meaning, information has greater value, traditional intermediar-
ies are being replaced or eliminated completely, and buyers hold more power than ever
before. While buyers are enjoying greater access to markets, sellers are also finding tre-
mendous advantages in doing e-business.
T I P
According to a study by J. D. Power and Associates, 64 percent of new vehicle buyers use online auto-
motive information when making a purchase.10

E-Business Advantages and Disadvantages
Like buyers, sellers also benefit tremendously from the global e-business-based economy.
Sellers can increase sales and operations from local to worldwide markets, improve inter-
nal efficiency and productivity, enhance customer service, and increase communication
with both suppliers and customers. Table 1-2 illustrates some e-business advantages for
sellers and buyers.

“The information highway will . . . carry us into a new world of low-friction, low-

low. It will be a shopper’s heaven.”

Unfortunately, however, the global e-business economy also poses some disadvan-
tages for both sellers and buyers. Businesses may find it difficult and expensive to keep up
with rapidly changing technologies, and exploiting the global marketplace means busi-
nesses must confront diverse language and cultural issues, conduct transactions in differ-
ent currencies, and navigate unknown political environments.
The global e-business economy poses disadvantages for consumers in the form of con-
cerns about transaction security and privacy and vendor reliability. Many consumers still
prefer to touch and feel products before buying them. Table 1-3 illustrates some
e-business disadvantages for both sellers and buyers.

E-Business Value Chains
The widespread access to the Internet and the Web by suppliers and customers has
encouraged many companies to reevaluate their value chains. In his book, Competitive
Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, Michael E. Porter of the
Harvard Business School first introduced the concept of a value chain. A company’s value
chain consists of all the primary and support activities, called value activities, per-
formed to create and distribute its goods and services.11 Primary activities include all the
Chapter 1
14

activities necessary to produce, sell, and support the company’s products. Support activi-
ties include purchasing, human resources, technology, and other functions necessary to
support the primary activities. At each link in an e-business’s value chain, Internet and Web
technologies improve communications and transaction speed. Figure 1-11 illustrates a
generic value chain.
Value chains are also used to represent the value activities of any transaction starting
with a product or service and ending with a customer. Internet and Web access is redefin-
ing the relationships among manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and customers. Increas-
ingly, a company’s value chains can be seen as value networks of the multiple relationships
the company depends on to produce and sell its products and services (Figure 1-12).
FIGURE 1-11

The process of rethinking and redefining value chains enables companies to develop
new ways of conducting business using the Internet and the Web.
E - B U S I N E S S

A company’s business model is the way in which the company conducts business in
order to generate revenue. Widespread access to the Internet and the Web is driving
companies to adapt old business models and create new ones. Although there are many dif-
ferent ways to categorize e-business models, they can be broadly categorized as business-
to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G),
consumer-to-consumer (C2C), and consumer-to-business (C2B). Table 1-4 describes the
general features of these e-business models and provides examples of e-businesses that
follow them.

Within these broad categories, there are a number of variations in the way the mod-
els are implemented; in fact, many e-businesses follow some combination of these
e-business models. Take, for example, Interstate Batteries, a Dallas, Texas-based com-
pany that has been marketing and distributing batteries of all kinds through a system of
wholesale distributors since 1952. Interstate Batteries’ original Web site focused prima-
rily on its traditional B2B marketing and sales. But in 2004, the company made major modi-
fications to its Web site—including the addition of new search and navigation tools—to
Chapter 1
16

help individual consumers more easily find and purchase batteries at the site. These Web
site modifications, together with an advertising program targeting individual consumers,
added substantial online B2C sales to the mix.12, 13
Other e-businesses that combine B2B and B2C e-business models are Dell, Office Depot,
and Staples. To appreciate the competitive advantage of these variations, you must first
become more familiar with how each of these e-business model works.
Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
Consumers are increasingly going online to shop for and purchase products, arrange
financing, prepare shipment and delivery of digital products such as software, and get ser-
vice after the sale. Business-to-consumer, or B2C, e-business includes retail sales, often
called e-retail, of goods and services, as well as online purchases of items such as airline
tickets, entertainment venue tickets, hotel rooms, and shares of stock.
Businesses that conduct their transactions from a physical location are sometimes
known as brick-and-mortar enterprises. Many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers—from
nationwide companies such as Sears, Best Buy, Barnes & Noble, and the Gap, to regional
or local stores such as The Sunglass City—are now e-retailers who maintain online stores
at which their customers can also view merchandise and make purchases. Companies such
as these, which combine brick-and-mortar business facilities with e-business opera-
tions, are sometimes called brick-and-click companies.
Some B2C e-businesses provide high-value content for a subscription fee. Examples of
e-businesses following a subscription model such as this include the Wall Street Jour-
nal Online (for financial news and articles), Consumer Reports (for product reviews and
evaluations), and eDiets.com (for nutritional counseling).
The B2C e-business category also includes virtual malls, which are e-business Web sites
that host a number of online merchants. Virtual malls, which may also offer transaction
handling services and marketing options, typically charge online merchants setup, listing,
or transaction fees. Most virtual malls allow consumers to search for a specific product,
compare the product features and prices offered by various stores, and even check out each
store’s consumer satisfaction ratings. Two examples of virtual malls are MSN Shopping and
Yahoo! Shopping.
Pure-play e-retailers, merchants that offer traditional or Web-specific products or ser-
vices only over the Internet, are sometimes called virtual merchants, and they provide
another variation on the B2C model. Amazon.com—a company that sells books, electron-
ics, toys, music, and more—is one of the most successful original pure-play e-retailers.
Other successful pure-play e-retailers include eBags, which specializes in bags and lug-
gage of all types, and Hometown Favorites, an e-business that offers hard-to-find foods.
Some businesses supplement a successful traditional mail-order business with an online
shopping site, or move completely to an online store. These businesses are sometimes
called catalog merchants. Examples of catalog merchants include Avon.com (cosmetics
and fragrances), CHEF’S (cookware and kitchen accessories), Omaha Steaks (premium
steaks, meats, and other gourmet food), and Harry and David (gourmet food gifts). Fig-
ures 1-13 through 1-16 depict various B2C Web sites.

While B2C may be the most familiar form of e-business, worldwide transactions among
businesses account for the majority of e-business transactions.14
Business-to-Business (B2B)
Like B2C e-business models, business-to-business, or B2B, e-business models take a vari-
ety of forms. There are basic B2B Internet storefronts, such as Staples and Office Depot,
which provide business customers with purchasing, order fulfillment, and other custom-
ized services. Some B2B e-businesses offer Internet and Web products such as Web site
hosting and Web page design, networking hardware and software, or e-business consulting
services.
Another B2B model is an online trading community that acts as a central source of
information for a vertical market. A vertical market is a specific industry in which simi-
lar products or services are developed and sold using similar methods. Examples of broad
vertical markets include insurance, real estate, banking, heavy manufacturing, and
transportation. The information available at online trading community Web sites
includes buyer’s guides, supplier and product directories, industry news and articles, sched-
ules for industry trade shows and events, and classified ads. MediSpeciality.com (health-
care industry), Hotel Resource (hospitality industry), and Elance (IT industry) are examples
of B2B e-businesses that support vertical markets. Figure 1-17 shows a B2B Web site.
In addition to supporting vertical markets, Elance also serves as a B2B exchange.
B2B exchanges are e-businesses that bring multiple buyers and sellers together in a vir-
tual centralized marketplace, sometimes called a marketspace. B2B exchanges
may aggregate information from multiple sellers, allow participants to post buy or sell
FIGURE 1-17
Elance
Chapter 1

opportunities on an electronic bulletin board, provide auction services that enable mul-
tiple buyers or sellers to enter competitive bids on contracts, or provide access to expert
information for a specific field.
B2B exchanges that deal in products or services include XSAg.com (agricultural indus-
try), freightquote.com (shipping industry), Covisint (automotive industry), VIPAR Heavy
Duty (truck parts), and Dairy.com (dairy industry). One example of a B2B expert informa-
tion exchange is the ATLA Exchange Expert operated by the Association of Trial Law-
yers of America (ATLA). ATLA members can login and access the ATLA Expert Exchange
database to locate legal experts who can help them prepare for a case. Legal experts wish-
ing to become part of the database pay a subscription fee. Figures 1-18 and 1-19 are
examples of B2B exchange Web sites.

Business.com
Jake Winebaum and Sky Dayton, entrepreneurs formerly associated with Disney
Online and EarthLink, respectively, set a record in the late 1990s by purchasing the
Internet domain name “business.com” with a common stock transaction valued, at
the time, at $7.5 million.Their plan was to build a B2B exchange that aggregated busi-
ness information from various industries. Winebaum and Dayton wanted the
Business.com Web site (Figure 1-20) to be the first place a businessperson looked
to find all types of business information on the Web. Launched in 2000, Business.
com initially provided news, statistics, company profiles, financial data, and product/
service directories for 57 industries. Since then, Business.com has evolved into a
business-oriented search tool, with more than 60,000 industry, product, and ser-
vice directory subcategories.15, 16

FIGURE 1-19

Another subcategory within in the B2B model is a B2B auction, where products and ser-
vices are exchanged through online bidding. B2B auctions include both online forward
auctions, where many buyers bid on products or services offered by a single seller, and
online reverse auctions, in which a single buyer offers to purchase products and ser-
vices from multiple competing sellers. One B2B auction site that offers both forward and
reverse auction services for the retail, construction, travel, and manufacturing industries is
HedgeHog. Figure 1-21 illustrates a B2B auction Web site.
Business-to-Government (B2G)
A variation on the B2B model is the business-to-government, or B2G, model. These
e-businesses create a marketspace for sellers wanting do business with government
agencies. B2G e-businesses provide information on government contracting and bring
suppliers and government agencies together. E-businesses, such as Bidmain and
B2GMarkets, follow the B2G e-business model. Figure 1-22 illustrates a B2G Web site.
Now that you’ve become familiar with how B2C, B2B, and B2G e-businesses interact
with individual consumers and other businesses, you can examine another type of busi-
ness activity fostered by the growth of the Internet and Web access, one in which consum-
ers interact directly with other consumers to buy, sell, and trade items, personal services,
and information.

Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
In the consumer-to-consumer, or C2C, e-business model, consumers sell products, personal
services, and expertise directly to other consumers through a number of methods: by plac-
ing online classified ads, by participating in forward and reverse auctions, or by making
trades. Examples of e-businesses that involve consumers selling directly to consumers are
American Boat Listing, an online boat listing servive; eBay, which offers both fixed price
items and auctions; TraderOnline.com, which hosts classified ads; and AllExperts.com, an
expert information exchange. Figures 1-23 through 1-26 show C2C Web sites.
In addition to enabling consumers to interact with each other directly, the growth of
Internet access and Web content has shifted marketplace power from sellers to buyers. This
shift has transformed the relationships between these two groups in dramatic ways, and
has led to the creation of the final business model listed in Table 1-4: the consumer-to-
business model.

Consumer-to-Business (C2B)
Like the B2B reverse auction model, the consumer-to-business, or C2B, e-business model
uses reverse auctions to enable consumers to name their own price for a specific good or
service; once the bid is offered and accepted, it is often binding. An e-business following the
C2B model collects an individual consumer’s bid for a product or service, such as an air-
line ticket, rental car, or hotel room, and then offers the bid to multiple competing sellers
who either accept or decline the consumer’s bid. The most well-known e-business follow-
ing the C2B e-business model is priceline.com (Figure 1-27).
In addition to broad categories such as B2B and B2C, there are various subcategories of
e-business models. Many of these subcategories were created by organizations such as govern-
ment agencies, non-profit institutions, and social or religious groups that decided to reduce
their operating expenses and improve customer service by adapting e-business models to their
specific needs. National Public Radio is an example of a non-profit institution following an
e-business model.
In Chapter 2, we introduce Rackspace Managed Hosting, an e-business located in San
Antonio, TX. In subsequent chapters, we will follow Rackspace’s progress from idea to
launch to operation.

Despite the cost-cutting changes implemented by CEO George Orban, the Egghead stores
continued to lose money. A notable exception to this trend was the online store, whose
sales were growing dramatically. The message was clear: Egghead had to change its busi-
ness even more dramatically or go under. The decision was made to close the remain-
ing brick-and-mortar stores, lay off store employees, and begin doing business online
only—that is, as the pure-play e-retailer now known as Egghead.com.17 As part of this
initiative, Egghead.com began courting small- and medium-sized businesses as its custom-
ers by offering new software licensing options and volume pricing discounts. It also
improved customer support by adding an automatic service that sent order status updates
via e-mail. Finally, Egghead.com joined in new strategic reseller partnerships with Com-
paq Computer Corporation, Sony, and others.18
By changing its business model and rethinking its value chains, Egghead Software rein-
carnated itself as Egghead.com, and the company’s online sales continued to grow. In
1999, Egghead.com merged with the online auction company OnSale to form a new com-
pany that kept the Egghead.com name. But a combination of factors forced the new
Egghead.com to file for bankruptcy in two short years. One such factor was that competi-
tors continued to undercut Egghead.com by selling the same or similar products at lower
prices. Also, a general downturn in the overall economy further reduced sales, and in
trying to stay afloat, the company began hemorrhaging cash.

Egghead.com cut costs again by laying off employees and moving many of its jobs from
California to Washington State. Unfortunately, however, all this was too little too late. The
company suspended operations, and its assets—including its URL www.egghead.
com—were ultimately purchased from the bankruptcy court by Amazon.com.19, 20 As you
can see in Figure 1-28, Egghead.com is now an Amazon.com storefront.

Chapter Summary
●
In traditional commerce, buyers and sellers come together in a physical marketplace to
exchange information, products, services, and payments.
●
The terms “e-commerce” and “e-business” both refer to the process of conducting a broad
spectrum of business activities over a telecommunications network.
●
The earliest forms of electronic commerce were electronic data interchange (EDI) and
electronic funds transfer (EFT).
●
The Internet is a worldwide public network connecting thousands of private networks and
individuals.
●
The World Wide Web is a subset of the Internet and consists of servers that store hyper-
linked documents called Web pages.
●
Traditional business limitations of time, space, and geographical location are being over-
come by the flexibility of doing business over the Internet.
●
Access to consumer information and competing sellers through the Internet and the Web
has led to a shift in market power from seller to buyer.
●
A company’s value chain comprises all the primary and support activities necessary to
create and distribute the company’s goods and services.
●
Because of the growth of the Internet and the Web and the way they have redefined busi-
ness relationships, companies are rethinking their traditional value chains and consider-
ing new ways of doing business.
●
A company’s business model is the way in which it conducts business in order to gener-
ate revenue.
●
Global access to the Internet and the Web is driving businesses to adapt old business
models and create new ones.
●
E-business models can be broadly categorized as business-to-consumer (B2C),
business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), consumer-to-consumer
(C2C), and consumer-to-business (C2B).

Kelby Hagar, a fifth-generation Texan, grew up in Hereford, Texas, a small town in the Texas
panhandle. After graduating from Angelo State University with a degree in prelaw and
accounting, Hagar married and moved east to study law at Harvard in the early 1990s.
Looking for a snack late one night, Hagar opened the refrigerator and found it was prac-
tically empty! But who had time to shop for groceries? The Internet-savvy Hagar, who was
accustomed to going online to shop for books and make travel arrangements, began won-
dering why he couldn’t order his groceries online and have them delivered to his door-
step like his books. After graduating from Harvard, Hagar and his wife moved to Dallas,
where he began working for a major law firm. But the time-saving idea of ordering grocer-
ies online and having them delivered just wouldn’t go away.1, 2 Could Hagar turn his
e-business idea into reality?

Do you have an e-business idea? Are you excited about taking your e-business idea to
market? One of the first things you should do is consider the entrepreneurial abilities
needed to start any business, including an e-business.
The Entrepreneur
An entrepreneur is someone who assumes the risks associated with starting and running
his or her own business. Entrepreneurial abilities include:
●
leadership traits
●
a high-energy personality
●
self-confidence
●
organizational skills
●
the ability to act quickly and decisively
To successfully start, operate, and grow any business—including an e-business—an
entrepreneur must be able to lead others. Leadership traits common to most successful
entrepreneurs include intelligence, determination, integrity, listening skills, and the abil-
ity to relate to others in a positive way. As a leader, an entrepreneur must be able to com-
municate the mission and goals of his or her business to investors, suppliers, customers,
employees, and interested others.3
Q U O T E S

S U C C E S S
“I’m convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-
successful ones is pure perseverance.”
Steve Jobs, founder of Apple Computer, Inc.
Starting any new business requires considerable energy and the ability to focus that
energy on accomplishing objectives. Because starting and running a business is more time-
intensive than working for someone else, following an appropriate stress management plan
(including exercise and a healthy diet) is a must for an entrepreneur.
Successful entrepreneurs must believe in their business ideas and have the self-
confidence to accomplish their goals. Self-confidence is enhanced when the business idea
is closely related to an area of the entrepreneurs’ interests or expertise. Along with self-
confidence, entrepreneurs need the ability to organize business activities successfully, as
this is essential to get things done on time, locating business-critical information quickly,
and staying on schedule.
T I P
Entrepreneurship is also taking place within large corporations, such as Sun Microsystems and Boeing,
where project leaders are encouraged to use their entrepreneurial skills to turn new product
ideas—especially the kind that strive to take advantage of the Internet and Web—into profits.When employ-
ees exhibit entrepreneurship behaviors within a large corporation, this phenomenon is sometimes called
“intrapreneurship.”
Chapter 2
38

In addition, successful entrepreneurs are generally independent, goal-oriented, cre-
ative, and competitive. Many successful entrepreneurs display their competitive natures
early in life—that is, in their approach to school, hobbies, or sports. Finally, entrepre-
neurs must be ready to make short-term sacrifices, such as spending limited time with fam-
ily and friends, in return for long-term success.4
E - P I O N E E R S
Failure—A Successful Idea
A few years ago, Jason Zasky, a survivor of three failed entrepreneurial adventures,
was walking with his cousin in Manhattan, when his cousin stopped and said: “I have
a great idea for a magazine—failure.” Zasky, who also thought the idea was great,
began working “serious 18-hour days” with his partner, Kathleen Ervin, in a small
building in Scarsdale, New York. Together the two of them launched an online maga-
zine named Failure in July, 2000.
According to Zasky, Failure Magazine’s target market consists of adventurous,
risk-taking individuals between 25 and 55 years old, for whom the word “failure” car-
ries little stigma. Failure Magazine is designed to be “thought-provoking rather than
provocative,” and includes articles and features on topics such as the world’s great-
est golfer never to succeed on the pro tour and an interview with the player who made
one of the greatest baseball errors in history.
Because failure is a universal experience, Zasky believes that people are inter-
ested in failure-related stories. When asked if it were possible to create a success-
ful e-business by publicizing the failures of others, Zasky responded that he and his
partner believe that “the greatest failure would be in not trying to make Failure
Magazine a success.” Even with a history of other failed entrepreneurial attempts,
Zasky was not afraid to use his entrepreneurial abilities and hard work to try a new
e-business idea!5, 6, 7, 8

“I think we write about winners because those are the people out there taking risks, mak-
ing things happen, even if they fail.”

After considering entrepreneurial abilities, the next step is to understand the entrepre-
neurial process.
T I P
Some people consider starting their own business so that they can set their own working hours. While
entrepreneurs often do set their own work schedules, they are seldom easy ones. To achieve a busi-
ness’s startup goals, an entrepreneur may need to work 10 to 12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week!
Defining Your E-Business Idea
39

The Entrepreneurial Process
The entrepreneurial process, which can be divided into several steps or stages, is a
methodology in which you begin by determining whether or not you are an entrepreneur
and then deciding whether to start your own business or purchase an existing business. If
you choose to start your own business, you must define the business idea, create a busi-
ness plan, and perhaps, secure financing before you can begin operating the business. Fig-
ure 2-1 illustrates the five stages of the entrepreneurial process.9
●
Stage 1: Decide whether or not you are an entrepreneur. It is critical that you
assess your entrepreneurial abilities and evaluate the time and effort that will
be required. Consider seriously the effect of this commitment on you and your
family before going to the next stage.
●
Stage 2: Decide whether to buy or start a business. If you determine that you
are an entrepreneur, the next step in the entrepreneurial process is to decide
whether to start a new business or purchase an existing business.
●
Stage 3: If you decide to start a new business, you must first define the busi-
ness idea or concept, including the products or services to be sold. Then you
must create a business plan that includes your assessment of the business
environment in which you will operate, an identification of the business need,
estimates of expected profitability, and a description of the legal form the busi-
ness will take. Part of the business planning process includes defining stake-
holders, such as customers, suppliers, distributors, and possible investors.
After developing the business plan, you must then secure financing and
resources from various sources: you (a business owner’s own time and effort
are commonly referred to as sweat equity), friends and family, third-party
angel investors, and venture capitalists.
●
Stage 4: After you either start a new business or purchase an existing one, you
then must operate and grow the business.
●
Stage 5: Once the business is in operation and has grown, you will be able to
harvest the business through a number of means: by continuing to operate the
business and letting it become a cash cow (that is, continue operations to
generate cash), by going public (issuing a public stock offering or IPO), by sell-
ing the business, or by allowing it to be acquired by another business. Of
course, if the business is not successful, you may be required at this stage to liq-
uidate the business and, if necessary, file for bankruptcy.
T I P
Thinking about quitting your current job to devote time and energy to an entrepreneurial adventure?
Before you do, remember to consider your ongoing financial needs. Various sources suggest that you
should set aside funds to cover living expenses for a period ranging anywhere from six months to two years.

From Idea to Harvest
The Chicago-area Web marketing company WebPromote was launched by four
engineers—Keith Speer, Ken Wruk, Kevin Manley, and John Weiss—whose
e-business idea was to create a permissions-based marketing company that sent a
weekly newsletter containing advertising messages to newsletter subscribers. In the
late 1990s, when the four-year-old e-business’s newsletter started generating larger
advertising revenues, the founders of WebPromote began searching for funds to
expand their e-business, but they didn’t have a lot of luck—at least not initially. It
seemed that many of the venture capital firms they contacted were concerned that
WebPromote lacked the marketing management expertise to succeed.
Enter David M. Tolmie, an experienced marketing professional who met with the
founders on behalf of his venture capital firm. Tolmie liked the WebPromote
e-business idea, and because he wanted the challenge of running a business, he
agreed to join WebPromote as the chief executive officer and president—thereby pro-
viding the business the important marketing expertise it needed. As CEO, Tolmie
acted quickly to secure a round of venture capital financing; he changed the com-
pany name to Yesmail, refocused the company on its permission-based e-mail
business, and doubled the company’s member base.

The efforts paid off, and in a little more than one year, Tolmie took Yesmail public.
Shortly thereafter, Tolmie and the company’s founders harvested the e-business’s
value by selling Yesmail for more than $500 million to the e-business aggregator
CMGI, Inc.10, 11, 12 Today, Yesmail is part of infoUSA and Donnelley Marketing.
After determining that you have the entrepreneurial abilities to take your e-business
idea to market and after reviewing the entrepreneurial process, you should next consider
some of the major factors that could affect the long-term success of your e-business idea.

E - B U S I N E S S
S U C C E S S
E-business ideas span the spectrum from selling hard-to-find food products directly to
consumers, to auctioning excess oil and gas capacity, to offering online mediation ser-
vices, to providing Web site hosting services. Successful e-businesses based on viable
e-business models and sound business principles will grow, change, and mature; on the
other hand, e-businesses based on flawed e-business models or unsound business prac-
tices find it difficult, if not impossible, to survive. Many factors can affect the success of
a new e-business idea. There are several factors that are unique to doing business online
including the network effect, creating innovative marketing ideas, scalability, the ease of
entry into electronic markets for you and your competitors, and adaptability to change.
Every e-business entrepreneur should carefully consider each of these factors.
The Network Effect
A primary factor in the growth of e-business is the network effect. The network effect is
the phenomena in which the total value of a product, service, or technology grows as more
and more people use the product, service, or technology. A commonly used example that
demonstrates how the network effect leads to increasing value is a telephone service. A
telephone service or network with a single telephone user has little value to the user or to
others because there is no one else to call. However, when you add a second telephone user,
the value of the telephone network increases because there are now other people to call. As
additional telephone users are added, the telephone service’s total value continues to
increase.
For each Internet user, the value of being online grows as the number of individuals
and businesses that are online grows. For global e-business, the network of linked
e-businesses and consumers becomes more valuable as more and more e-businesses and
T I P
The change in the value of a network as it grows, or the network effect, is sometimes called Metcalfe’s
Law. Bob Metcalfe, an engineer and entrepreneur, was involved in the early development of network tech-
nologies at Xerox PARC and is the founder of 3Com Corporation. Metcalfe’s Law states that the power of
the network is N squared, where N is the number of nodes in the network.13
Chapter 2
42

consumers participate in the process. Examples of e-businesses and other organizations
who have successfully harnessed the power of the network effect include auction sites, such
as uBid; professional associations, such as that of the developers of Bluetooth; and B2B
technology providers, such as Groove Networks. Figures 2-2 through 2-4 show the Web sites
for these organizations.
FIGURE 2-2

Defining Your E-Business Idea
43

Take a close look at your e-business idea and decide whether or not the value of the
product, service, or technology you plan to offer increases with greater use or distribution
over the Internet and the Web. You should also be mindful of the inherent dangers of the
network effect on your e-business idea—for example, rapidly circulating negative cus-
tomer comments or technologies that perform in unexpected and unwanted ways.
As part of the evaluation of your e-business idea, you should identify ways to exploit-
the network effect by using innovative marketing ideas to promote your e-business.
E - P I O N E E R S
A Network Effect Backlash
In the late 1990s, an e-business named Third Voice gained worldwide attention by
offering Web annotation software that allowed users to post Web versions of “sticky
notes” on any Web page. Users simply downloaded the Third Voice browser plug-in
software, which enabled them to post comments, view comments by others, and even
join discussion groups or communities related to specific Web pages. With this soft-
ware, users could also import their e-mail address books into Third Voice and use
it to generate an e-mail message that included a link to the Web page being viewed.
If message recipients didn’t have the Third Voice software, a quick click took them to
the Third Voice Web site, where they could download it. By enabling people to
import their address books, Third Voice immediately created a network of potential
users for itself.

What at first seemed like a fun and interesting e-business idea rapidly turned
sour, however. Software programmers quickly discovered security problems with the
Third Voice software that allowed hackers to access users’ data and also enabled
them to create fake Web pages. In addition, many Web design professionals and pro-
prietors of e-businesses were outraged that Third Voice users could, in effect, deface
Web pages with unflattering and inappropriate comments. While some people
championed Third Voice as a new tool for free expression, many others become con-
cerned about threats to user privacy. Before long, Third Voice closed shop, posting
instructions on its Web site for how its users could uninstall the Third Voice software
from their computers.14, 15, 16
Innovative Marketing Ideas
Successful e-business entrepreneurs develop imaginative ways of exploiting the network
effect in order to market products and services to new customers. One of the most famous
examples of a new e-business that successfully exploited the network effect through the use
of an innovative marketing idea is Hotmail.
Hotmail, a wildly successful e-business that offers free e-mail services, almost didn’t
get launched. As with many e-business startups, Hotmail’s founders Sabeer Bhatia and Jack
Smith had difficulties getting venture capitalists interested in their idea. When they met
with Tim Draper, the founding partner of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson
(DFJ), Draper liked the idea of free e-mail but insisted that text be added to the bottom of
each outgoing e-mail message encouraging recipients to get their own free Hotmail account.
Draper wanted the text to be linked to the Hotmail Web site so that message recipients
could click the link, view the features of Hotmail on the Web site, and immediately sign up
for the service themselves.
At first, Bhatia and Smith resisted the idea of adding the linked message, considering
it to be too much like what today is called spam—unsolicited commercial messages or
advertisements that are sent by marketers to a large number of unrelated and uninter-
ested parties. Eager to get financing for their new e-business, however, Bhatia and Smith
finally agreed with Draper about including the marketing message link.
Hotmail was quietly launched in 1996 over the July 4th holiday. Because of the holi-
day and because there was little money to spend on advertising the service, the launch gen-
erated little press coverage. But this apparently didn’t matter—customers soon began
signing up for Hotmail accounts in droves! The first customers to sign up were at colleges
and universities. A single user from a school would sign up, and then, the next day, a hun-
dred users from the same school would be signed up. By the end of the week, there would
be a thousand users from the same school. In the meantime, word about Hotmail would
spread to another school, and this process would begin again.
Before long, users from around the world began signing up, and the propagating pro-
cess continued at impressive speeds. For example, within six weeks after the first user in
India subscribed, India had 100,000 Hotmail subscribers. Less than 18 months after its
launch, Hotmail had 12 million worldwide subscribers. And in less than three years, Hot-
mail had become the fastest-growing media company in history, with more than 30 mil-
lion subscribers! The network effect enabled Hotmail, the world’s first Web-based e-mail

service, to spread like wildfire. Shortly after recording 12 million subscribers, Hotmail’s
founders sold the company to Microsoft for $400 million (Figure 2-5).17, 18
The astounding spread of Hotmail prompted Tim Draper and his partner at DFJ, Steve
Jurvetson, to analyze what was unique about Hotmail’s success. They noted that Hotmail
spread around the world like an epidemic. When current users sent messages to others con-
taining the Hotmail link, they were “infecting” potential users, who in turn “infected” other
potential users. Drawing an analogy to the effects of a sneeze in a crowd, Draper and Jur-
vetson coined the phrase viral marketing to describe Hotmail’s innovative method of
attracting new customers.19, 20, 21, 22

In addition to assessing the network effect and making use of innovative marketing
ideas, you must carefully consider how the idea for your e-business will work when your
business experiences rapid growth.

Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of your e-business idea to continue to function well,
regardless of how large the business gets. The rapid growth of an e-business can cause prob-
lems if your e-business idea does not scale well with unexpected growth. Just ask the
founders of AllAdvantage; they not only underestimated the power of the network effect and
viral marketing, they also failed to realize how poorly the AllAdvantage e-business idea
would scale as a result of rapid growth.
AllAdvantage, along with similar e-businesses such as Spedia and Jotter, tried to put a
new twist on generating advertising revenues by paying people to browse the Web. AllAd-
vantage’s e-business idea involved allowing individuals to download a viewing bar in which
advertisements targeted to their Web browsing habits would appear as they moved from
Web page to Web page. The idea was that advertisers would pay AllAdvantage to display their
advertising messages in the viewing bar, while AllAdvantage paid its members up to $.53
per hour to surf the Web and read those messages. Members were encouraged to get oth-
ers to sign up, and AllAdvantage paid members up to an additional $.10 an hour for the
time the new members they had referred surfed the Web. Original members were also paid
a bonus if the member they had referred wound up referring someone else, and so on—a
classic pyramid scheme.
AllAdvantage had expected to attract 20,000 members in three months. In the first
week of operations, 100,000 users enrolled with AllAdvantage; at the three-month mark, the
company found itself with one million members. Within a few months, AllAdvantage had
6.7 million registered members, with membership growing at a rate of 15,000–16,000 mem-
bers per month.
While these numbers may suggest that AllAdvantage was experiencing the same run-
away success that Hotmail had enjoyed, the real story is more complicated. While AllAd-
vantage had no problem building its membership, advertisers resisted the idea of targeting
online advertising to individuals browsing the Web. Many advertisers did not yet fully under-
stand how to harness the power of the Internet and exploit the network effect to target cus-
tomers with their advertising. Because of this resistance, AllAdvantage had trouble selling
advertisers on using the AllAdvantage service, and in its first year of operations, the com-
pany earned only $14.4 million in revenues. At the same time, with its skyrocketing mem-
ber acquisitions, AllAdvantage paid out almost $50 million to members. This payout,
coupled with operating expenses, caused AllAdvantage to lose more than $100 million in
its first year—and from then on, the situation only got worse. Advertisers didn’t buy into the
AllAdvantage e-business idea quickly enough to match the overwhelming growth in
membership. Within two years, AllAdvantage burned through its capital and ceased
operations.23, 24

The term “scalability” is also used to refer to the ability of Web servers to handle increases in traffic loads
to a Web site without crashing.
Defining Your E-Business Idea

Remember! When evaluating your e-business idea, consider its scalability—how well
your idea works with unexpected and rapid growth. What will happen to your e-business if
demand for your products or services explodes? For example, if your e-business sells prod-
ucts, do you have reliable sources for those products and a strong distribution system
that can meet a sudden increase in demand from your customers? If your e-business sells
a service, do you have sufficient resources to satisfy a spike in customer orders?
When evaluating your e-business idea, consider how easy it is for you—and your
competitors—to enter the marketplace.
Ease of Entry into Electronic Markets
Low-cost Internet technologies have made it easy for many new e-businesses to enter an
online marketplace and become competitive. A good example is the C2C auction market-
place, which in recent years has experienced tremendous growth in both the number of
auction sites and in auction sales dollars. Three major reasons for the growth of online C2C
auction sites are the following.
1.
Ease with which consumers can interact with an auction Web site—they need
only a computer and Internet access.
2.
Availability of Web site auction software that is easily installed and
maintained—entrepreneurs don’t need tremendous computer expertise to cre-
ate and maintain a Web site to showcase sellers’ items, record bids, and handle
buyers’ payments.
3.
Attractive business proposition—the e-business hosting the auction can earn
sales commissions without having to manage, warehouse, or distribute prod-
uct inventories.
One of the few e-businesses to be profitable from its inception, eBay remains the Web’s
top auction site despite this intensified competition. Launched as a central location to buy
and sell unique items, eBay experienced sales (that is, the value of goods traded on the
eBay site) that grew from $347,000 to $47 million within two years. Today, eBay’s reported
sales in more than ten categories, including automobiles, auto parts, consumer electron-
ics, toys, and collectibles, exceed $1 billion annually. 25, 26, 27
T I P
Many e-businesses—My Points, ClickRewards, and FreeRide, to name a few—attempted to jump on the
“pay-to-surf” bandwagon, and only a few still survive. For example, MyPoints and ClickRewards are now
reward-based marketing companies in which members earn points toward “free” gifts for Web surfing,
answering marketing e-mail, and shopping at specific stores. FreeRide evolved into a marketing com-
pany that pays members to take online surveys.

“It was an idea that I had, and I started it as an experiment, as a side hobby basically, while
I had my day job.”
Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay
eBay enjoys two business advantages that may be competitive barriers for other C2C
auction sites: first-mover advantage, or first-to-market advantage, and name
identification. Because eBay beat everyone else to the Web auction market, the site devel-
oped a strong community of buyers and sellers. Thanks to the fact that buyers and sell-
ers are naturally attracted to a Web site where there are already a large number of buyers
and sellers—and to the fact that the company was able to fortify its first-mover advan-
tage with aggressive marketing—eBay continues to attract many buyers, who then attract
more sellers, who then attract more buyers. Today, eBay reports more than 130 million
registered users around the world, including places such as China, India, South Korea,
Spain, and Taiwan.28
eBay’s penetration into the C2C marketplace has become so deep that the name “eBay”
is now synonymous with the concept of online auctions. It should be noted that the name
also represents a strong online community of already entrenched buyers and sellers. At
eBay, buyers and sellers not only enjoy the excitement of hunting for garage sale bar-
gains, but also the thrill of coming into contact and exchanging information with a commu-
nity of people who share their interests. This type of name identification is the ultimate
competitive barrier for new auction sites hoping to break into the C2C auction market.
An e-business’ ability to secure first-mover status or name identification does not guar-
antee that the business will be as successful as eBay. While other e-businesses, such as Dell,
Inc., have managed to successfully leverage first-mover advantage and name recogni-
tion into a dominant market position, many have not. For example, E*TRADE Financial,
one of the first online stock brokerage firms, now jockeys for first place with firms such as
Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, and others, in an online marketplace that E*TRADE
Financial pioneered.

Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking and Vision
As a teenager, Margaret “Meg” C. Whitman’s first job was as a snack bar cook and
general manager at Valley Ranch in Valley, Wyoming. She made brownies and cook-
ies, and bought other items to sell at the snack bar. When asked by the Detroit News
what she learned from that first job, Whitman replied, “You have to work hard to
make things work right. It doesn’t happen by itself.”29 With a bachelor’s degree in eco-
nomics from Princeton and an MBA from Harvard, Whitman has more than proved
this point by tackling a succession of high-profile jobs with companies such as Proc-
tor and Gamble, Disney, and Florists Transworld Delivery (FTD). Whitman has
embraced innovative technologies and adopted forward-looking strategies through-
out her career. For example, as president and CEO of FTD, she developed FTD’s
early e-business strategies.
When eBay was a small, three-year-old Internet startup, Whitman took a look and
liked what she saw. She quickly recognized that the eBay C2C auction concept was
a great e-business idea—it was unique, and it had no brick-and-mortar equivalent.
Already very successful in the traditional business world, in 1998 Whitman left her
position at FTD and staked her career and livelihood on the new venture by joining
eBay as President and CEO (Figure 2-6). From the start, Whitman had the foresight
to know that eBay was going to be huge. But no one—not even Meg Whitman—really
anticipated just how huge eBay would become in just a few short years. Today, some
investment analysts predict that eBay is positioned to control about 75 percent of the
global online auction market, which is valued at around $240 billion.30, 31, 32

“I still believe that technology is where the action is . . . But, if you love retail, travel, sports,
or something else, follow your passion and go for it.”
Meg Whitman, President and CEO of eBay
You should identify whether your e-business idea has a first-mover advantage or other
competitive advantage; if it doesn’t, consider the competitive barriers your e-business idea
faces in entering the existing online marketplace. Next, think about how quickly your
e-business idea can be adapted in an ever-changing business environment.
Adaptability to Change
The e-business marketspace is characterized by rapid knowledge transfer and the need to
make decisions quickly. An e-business entrepreneur must act quickly to exploit new ideas
and opportunities and to handle new challenges.
The ability to quickly adapt to the marketplace is a hallmark for what may be the most
famous e-retailer, Amazon.com. Amazon.com began as an online bookstore. Then, to meet
consumer demand for purchasing all kinds of items online, Amazon.com quickly started
selling music, toys and games, videos, vehicles, and other items. When the online auction
craze hit, Amazon.com promptly launched its own auction site and automatically regis-
tered its existing customers so that they could participate in the auctions (Figure 2-7). Next,
Amazon.com exploited its expertise in Web technologies by launching a new venture, Ama-
zon Web Services, which resells Web technologies to other e-businesses.

Because the rapid pace of change can affect the most fundamental ways in which your
e-business idea functions, you must consider how well your e-business idea could respond
and adapt to changes in the marketplace. The next step is to then think of ways to exploit
the built-in advantages you will have by doing business online.
E X P L O I T I N G
E - B U S I N E S S
A D V A N T A G E S
E-business offers certain inherent advantages. Existing businesses and new e-businesses
can exploit these built-in advantages to expand their markets, acquire greater business vis-
ibility, maximize customer relationships and increase responsiveness, create new prod-
ucts and services, and reduce costs.
Expand the Market
Because consumers in the e-business marketplace are not bound by the constraints of
physical location or time, an e-business has the opportunity to reach a larger market than
a traditional brick-and-mortar business. Recognizing this, many successful businesses are
revamping their existing business model to add an e-business component that comple-
ments their primary value chain. Examples of brick-and-mortar businesses that have suc-
cessfully modified their business model to incorporate an e-business include Wal-Mart,
Costco, and Ticketmaster.
Ticketmaster, the world leader in the market for live event ticket sales, demonstrates
how a very successful business idea can add e-business to its business mix. Founded in
1976, Ticketmaster was a pioneer in offering computerized ticketing services at brick-and-
mortar ticket outlets. In the mid 1990s, Ticketmaster launched its fledgling Web site, which
offered tickets online to events in the Pacific Northwest area. The ease with which a
transaction could be completed online was clearly popular with clients and consumers, and
within a few months, Ticketmaster was offering tickets online to events across the
country.33
Next, Ticketmaster was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp (formerly USA Network), who
combined the Ticketmaster online operations with those of its existing company,
CitySearch. Ticketmaster continued to expand its share of the market by actively market-
ing to consumers via e-mail, holding online ticket auctions, and providing an authorized
marketspace where season ticket holders could sell their unwanted tickets. Today, Ticket-
master (Figure 2-8) leads global online and offline ticket sales by combining more than
3,000 brick-and-mortar ticket outlets and 19 call centers with its online operations. In 2004,
Ticketmaster sold 98 million tickets across seventeen markets including the U.S.—both
online and offline—valued at $5 billion.34

If your e-business idea is based on a successful traditional business model, you should
determine whether it takes full advantage of the Internet to expand your market and gain
greater visibility for your products or services.
Acquire Greater Business Visibility
The Internet and the Web enable companies to get their name and products or services in
front of more potential customers than ever before. In fact, these days, having a pres-
ence online has become essential for most companies. In the Web’s early days, many com-
panies created Web sites that were little more than company brochures. Today, businesses
large and small acquire greater business visibility by hosting useful and informative Web
sites. A prime example of this is the way automobile manufacturers such as General Motors,
Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler use their Web sites to promote their companies and
their vehicles. Figures 2-9 through 2-11 illustrate examples of automotive company
Web sites.
Although these major automobile manufacturers sell their products through a net-
work of dealers, potential buyers and current owners can typically find a wealth of infor-
mation at the company Web sites, including:
●
industry and company news
●
owners’ information about vehicle care, accessories, and warranties
●
vehicle images and descriptions
●
tools to customize a specific vehicle
●
tools to search for nearby dealers
●
tools to search dealers’ inventories for a specific vehicle
●
online gift shops
●
calendars of sponsored events
FIGURE 2-8

But simply hosting a Web site is no guarantee that a company will successfully expand
the market for its products and services. Market conditions, execution, and timing all play
significant roles in this process. One major retailer that tried to harness the power of the
Web to gain greater business visibility, but fell very short of the mark, is Federated Depart-
ment Stores, a chain of brick-and-mortar department stores. In the late 1990s, Feder-
ated Department Stores bought Fingerhut Companies, a traditional catalog merchant with
FIGURE 2-9

FIGURE 2-10

Chapter 2

an online store. Federated planned to leverage Fingerhut’s 50 plus years of catalog retail-
ing and logistics expertise, as well as the company’s experience with operating an online
store, by transforming itself into a major e-retailer and supplier of logistics services (ware-
housing and distribution) for other e-businesses.35
Unfortunately, Federated’s timing, as well as the overall market conditions, couldn’t
have been worse. And, as you will see, the execution of Federated’s e-business idea was poor.
Shortly after Federated’s purchase of Fingerhut in 1999, the U.S. economy weakened.
Newly minted e-businesses that had exploded during the “dot.com boom” of the late 1990s
were finding it more and more difficult to survive, resulting in a “dot.com bust.” In the
weakened economy, Fingerhut’s online and catalog sales tanked. Fingerhut also had trouble
meeting its commitments to its logistics clients, who left in droves.
A major part of the problem for Federated was that Fingerhut’s core customer base con-
sisted of low-income credit customers who were granted credit on a purchase-by-purchase
basis. To spur sales, Fingerhut began offering revolving credit accounts to its
customers—with predictable results. Fingerhut’s customers began defaulting at record
rates. Within three years, Federated “threw in the towel” and closed Fingerhut, selling its
assets to Fingerhut’s former CEO and another business partner. Curiously, Fingerhut—the
subsidiary—fared better than expected. Reborn as Fingerhut Direct Marketing, Inc., Finger-
hut is again open for business as an e-retailer and catalog merchant.36

You should consider how your e-business idea can use the Internet and the Web to gain
greater business visibility, but always keep in mind that changing market conditions may
impact how well you will be able to execute your idea. Next, consider how your
e-business idea exploits the Internet and the Web to maximize your customer relationships.
Maximize Customer Relationships and Improve Responsiveness
The Internet is the ultimate tool for communication. E-businesses can use the Internet to
build customer loyalty by staying in touch with their customers’ needs, building one-on-
one relationships, and providing information that enriches their customers’ online
experience. As consumers become increasingly in control in the new global economy,
e-businesses must strive to improve their online responsiveness and maximize the ben-
efits they can offer via the Internet in order to draw and keep customers. These days,
e-businesses can create warm customer relationships through a variety of means such as
using personalized e-mail, displaying welcome messages, keeping track of customers’ inter-
ests, and delivering what the customers want. One company that uses its Web site to maxi-
mize customer benefits and maintain customer loyalty is Southwest Airlines.
Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Southwest is famous for its “no frills,” low-cost
approach to air travel. The company understands that simplicity, low airfares, and cus-
tomer service are what keep its customers coming back, and the company kept this in
mind when developing its Web site. Recognized as the airline industry’s leader in capitaliz-
ing on the Internet and the Web to boost sales and customer support, Southwest has a
simple, easy-to-use Web site. With just a few clicks, a customer can review flight and fare
options, book a low-cost flight, print out a boarding pass, book a car and hotel room, and
check on flight status. Customers can also enroll in Southwest’s Rapid Rewards frequent
flyer program at the Web site.
Understanding exactly what its online customers want and then using the power of the
Internet and the Web to deliver that is paying off for Southwest Airlines. Today, South-
west Airlines reports that more than 50 percent of its total passenger revenues, about $3 bil-
lion each year, are generated by customers booking their flights at Southwest.com

A Technology Innovator’s Excellent Idea
When W. W. Grainger, an 80-year-old, $5-billion-a-year distributor of electrical mer-
chandise such as power tools, electric motors, and light bulbs, launched its first Web
site in the mid-1990s, some analysts thought Grainger was an unlikely e-business
candidate. Grainger, which maintained a comfortable lead over its competitors in the
sales of machine maintenance and repair supplies, at first seemed to be exactly the
kind of traditional intermediary many analysts thought the advent of e-business
would destroy.
But Grainger had a history of being a technology innovator in its industry.
Grainger’s management team understood how a Web site would enable customers to
quickly locate product and pricing information. Despite some early problems,
Grainger’s Web-based sales thrived.Orders placed at the Web site were twice as large
on average as orders submitted via the traditional phone- or fax-based methods.
Additionally, customers who ordered online were spending 20 percent more annu-
ally than they had by ordering via traditional methods.
Grainger continued to fine tune its Web site operations, and before long Forbes
magazine named the Grainger site the “Best of the Web” in the “Indirect Procure-
ment Category.” B-to-B Magazine named the Grainger Web site to its NetMarketing
100 Top Business-to-Business Web Sites list. Today, instead of browsing through a
huge 3,700-page catalog that lists 82,000 products, Grainger’s online customers can
quickly search for products, get immediate information on their availability, and get
up-to-date prices customized for contractual discounts. Grainger reports that 15 per-
cent of its sales are generated at its Web site or through its EDI trading partners
(Figure 2-13).38

The Internet and the Web create possibilities for all types of new products and ser-
vices to be bought and sold. To operate a successful e-business, you must be open to the new
types of products and services your e-business idea might offer.
Create New Products and Services
The Internet and the Web create an environment that enables existing companies to expand
and refine their traditional businesses and one that promotes the emergence of new
e-business ideas. The list of the new types of e-businesses made possible by the Internet and
the Web goes on and on: business applications that can be accessed over the Web, server
facilities that offer file backup and storage, firms that provide Web site hosting services to
other firms, and more.
One interesting e-business idea is Online Dispute Resolution (ODR). Online Dispute
Resolution involves using Internet and Web technologies together with dispute resolution
technologies to facilitate dispute mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. A pioneer in the
field of Online Dispute Resolution is Cybersettle, Inc.
The idea for Cybersettle was born in the mid-1990s when two New York attorneys,
Charles Brofman and James Burchetta, were negotiating a routine auto accident claim.
Instead of spending days, weeks, and months in negotiations, the two attorneys chose a
simpler method. Each knew what the claim was worth to his client; they wrote that amount
down on a piece of paper, and the papers were handed to a court clerk who was told that
if the offers were within $1,000 of each other, the attorneys would split the difference and
settle the claim. If the difference was greater than $1,000, the clerk was to inform them of
this but not divulge the actual amounts, and the attorneys would try settling again. In the
FIGURE 2-13
Grainger
Chapter 2

case of the auto accident, the claim was settled on the first try.39 This speedy claim settle-
ment inspired Brofman and Burchetta to think about how similar types of claim settle-
ments could be facilitated using the Internet and the Web. Their idea became the e-business
named Cybersettle (Figure 2-14).
Cybersettle uses patented computerized dispute resolution software, which it makes
accessible to attorneys and claims professionals at its Web site. The dispute resolution soft-
ware matches confidential offers and demands in up to three rounds. When the maxi-
mum offer is equal to or greater than the minimum demand, the dispute is settled for a
monetary figure that is the average of the two—up to the amount of the maximum offer.
Cybersettle charges the participants in the dispute settlement fees based on the amount of
the settlement.
Cybersettle is now the Official and Exclusive Online Settlement Tool of The Associa-
tion of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA). With more than 9,000 claims professionals and
70,000 registered attorneys as clients, Cybersettle has been used to settle an assortment
of disputes, ranging from those involving bodily injury to various types of insurance claims.
The total value of its settlements is over $700 million.40

A Brilliant Execution of a Simple Idea
For serial entrepreneur Josh Kopelman, a new e-business idea grew out of an attempt
to buy a book online. Unwilling to pay a hefty price for a new book, Kopelman checked
out eBay, the auction powerhouse, where he found several copies of the book he
was looking for but no bids, which meant he would have to accept a seller’s list price.
Kopelman quickly realized that the auction model didn’t work well for some items,
such as used books. Why engage in the bidding process for a used book that could
be purchased at any used bookstore for half price or at any flea market for pennies?
Following his instincts, Kopelman created an online marketspace for buyers and sell-
ers of used books, CDs, and movies. Since nothing was to be priced at more than
half the original price, Kopelman named his online marketspace Half.com.41
What happened next is legendary in the annals of startup e-business history.
Kopelman and the Half.com marketing team wanted a sure-fire way to get national
attention and create greater business visibility for their new startup. They hit upon
the idea of renaming a small town “Half.com.” The Half.com team looked at several
options, and then chose a small Oregon town named Halfway. After meeting with the
town’s mayor and talking with several of Halfway’s residents, Half.com’s marketing
representative offered to donate computers to the city’s elementary school, provide a
raffle prize for the County Fair, and donate funds for civic improvements in exchange
for the name change. The town accepted and issued a proclamation changing its
name to Half.com, Oregon. In January, 2000, Half.com, Inc. launched its Web site dur-
ing a live broadcast of NBC’s Today Show from Half.com, Oregon and Consho-
hocken, Pennsylvania (Half.com, Inc.’s corporate headquarters), which garnered the
company priceless publicity.42
At around the same time, Meg Whitman, eBay’s CEO, was on the lookout for a
way to expand eBay’s market by offering fixed price items. Intrigued by what eBay
buyers and sellers were saying about Half.com, Whitman took a look and liked
what she saw—again! Recognizing that Half.com, Inc.’s business model was comple-
mentary to eBay’s; she bought Half.com for more than $300 million.43 After the acqui-
sition, Kopelman worked at eBay for three years, running the Half.com by eBay
operation (Figure 2-15). Then, true to his core interests as an entrepreneur, he left
and co-founded another e-business startup, TurnTide, a company that develops anti-
spam technologies.

Conducting business online not only opens up possibilities for new types of products
and services, it also offers ways to reduce the costs associated with customer acquisition,
transactions, and customer service after the sale.
Reduce Costs
One of the biggest benefits of doing business online is the potential to reduce the costs of
running a business. Allowing customers to get quotes as well as place and track orders
from a Web site can reduce an e-business’ order handling and sales support costs.
Other cost savings can be achieved by providing customer support online. For example,
technology companies such as Dell (computers, printers, electronics), Microsoft (computer
software), and Cisco Systems (networking products) save many millions of dollars each year
by enabling customers to access support services from their Web sites. By making their Web
sites the starting point for customer support, Cisco Systems and Microsoft greatly reduce the

number of calls to their technical assistance centers, which translates into major cost savings.
Figures 2-16 and 2-17 show examples of technology company Web sites.
When evaluating your e-business idea, consider how it might exploit the numerous
inherent advantages of doing business online. For example, how might using the Internet
and Web help your business expand its market, gain greater business visibility, improve

customer relationships, provide new services, and reduce the costs associated with main-
taining customer relationships and processing transactions?

In the Beginning, the Idea
Dirk Elmendorf and Richard Yoo were students at Trinity University, in San Antonio,
Texas in the late 1990s when they started an Internet consulting company named
Cymitar Network Systems. Soon, Elmendorf and Yoo were joined by Patrick Con-
don, another Trinity classmate.The business took off, and it wasn’t long before the trio
realized that they needed to focus their attention and resources in one specific area:
Web hosting. At that time, the Web hosting industry was in its infancy. Elmendorf,
Yoo, and Condon believed the field was ripe for a Web hosting provider with a strong
emphasis on customer support—and they were right. From that original idea—a Web
hosting e-business that emphasized top-level customer support—came Rack-
space Managed Hosting (Figure 2-18).
Today, the award-winning Rackspace Managed Hosting has five data centers,
revenues approaching $100 million, and clients such as EMI Records, Miller Brew-
ing, Best Buy, and National Geographic. Over the next few chapters, you will learn
more about the Rackspace story and how a timely idea became a very successful
e-business.44, 45

In his free time, Hagar, the lawyer who’d been looking for a midnight snack, began test-
ing his online grocery sales idea with business experts and advisors. He also did his
homework. After studying various industries, Hagar came to the conclusion that an
online grocery store could operate more efficiently than a regular grocery store because it
would not have to deal with the fixed costs associated with running a brick-and-mortar
enterprise. He also studied the habits of grocery shoppers and concluded that those shop-
pers who were already comfortable shopping online were ready for the convenience of
online grocery shopping and home delivery. After many months spent doing research, plan-
ning, putting together a management team with grocery sales experience, and securing
$48 million from private and institutional investors, GroceryWorks.com opened for
business in the Dallas area and quickly expanded to Houston. Hagar then helped to engi-
neer a merger between GroceryWorks.com and the grocery giant Safeway.
But GroceryWorks.com—along with other e-businesses that dealt in grocery deliv-
ery, such as Webvan and Peapod—struggled with the high cost of operating their busi-
nesses and their inability to attract as many customers as they had been expecting.
Within a year of its merger with Safeway, GroceryWorks.com was forced to suspend its
Texas operations. Ultimately, Safeway partnered with British grocery giant Tesco—a very
successful online grocery provider in the U.K.—and resumed online grocery operations
under the name Safeway.com. As of this writing, Safeway.com operates in Washington,
Oregon, and California.46, 47, 48, 49
But what about Kelby Hagar? Ever the entrepreneur, Hagar left GroceryWorks.com
after the merger with Safeway to pursue another business idea—surveillance systems for
the restaurant industry. Hagar founded a second Dallas-area business, Digital Witness,
which provides equipment and software for monitoring brick-and-mortar store operations
(Figure 2-19). Digital Witness uses its Web site to promote sales and provide software
downloads and technical support to its 400 plus clients, which include Outback Steak-
houses, Luby’s Cafeterias, and Quick Way stores.50, 51 Through hard work and an unflag-
ging entrepreneurial spirit, Hagar continues to capitalize on his e-business ideas.

Jenny Lefcourt and Jessica DiLullo met at Stanford Business School in the late 1990s,
where they were M.B.A. candidates. Lefcourt, who received her B.S.E. from the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and DiLullo, who graduated with a B.A. in Eco-
nomics from Stanford University, were experienced managers before beginning the M.B.A.
program.
Lefcourt and DiLullo soon discovered two important facts about each other. They both
wanted to create a startup business, and they shared the same business idea—an online
bridal registry. They wanted to create an easy way for people to register for a broad selec-
tion of gifts and for givers to send those gifts.
continued

Lefcourt and DiLullo decided to create a business plan for their online bridal regis-
try e-business idea and enter the plan in an entrepreneurship contest at Stanford. In the
contest, a panel of judges reviewed business plans through several rounds, eventually
awarding a prize of $25,000 in funding. Relying on their real-world experience as consum-
ers (both had been bridesmaids many times, and DiLullo was engaged to be married), Lef-
court and DiLullo began to prepare their plan. Working out their ideas, the two of them
would spend long hours in the Stanford library constantly asking each other, “Would you
register [for gifts] that way?” If the answer was “No!” they went back to the drawing
board. The hard work they put in to creating, reviewing, and revising their business plan
paid off. After the first round of judges’ reviews, Lefcourt and DiLullo pulled their busi-
ness plan out of the competition—and for good reason!1, 2

In Chapter 2, you learned about entrepreneurship and how to evaluate an e-business idea.
After you determine your interest and abilities as an entrepreneur and evaluate your
e-business idea, the next step is to create a plan for your new e-business. Business plan-
ning is an ongoing process of setting goals for a business and then determining the strate-
gies that would best accomplish those goals. A business plan is a formal business planning
document that:
●
identifies the business and its mission
●
names the key players on the management team
●
describes the products or services to be offered
●
provides an analysis of the current marketplace in which the business
will operate
●
identifies customers and competitors
●
determines the resources necessary for profitable operations
●
sets a timetable for profitability
For a startup e-business, an initial business plan is used to evaluate the feasibility of
the new e-business, to seek initial funding for operations, and to guide the management
team in operating the e-business. Since business planning is an ongoing process, how-
ever, a business plan is always a “work-in-progress” to be updated and maintained over the
entire life of the e-business.3
T I P
Strategic business planning—determining a company’s long-term goals and then identifying the actions
required to reach those goals—is an ongoing process for any existing business. For a startup e-business,
creating a business plan is usually part of its strategic planning process. Therefore, business plans are
sometimes called strategic plans.
Chapter 3
74

Creating and developing a business plan forces you to take a sharp look at your
e-business idea; the process requires a good deal of thought, time, and effort. Fortunately,
a comprehensive business plan can help you not only find and exploit the hidden strengths
of your e-business idea, but can also help identify and fix hidden weaknesses.
Q U O T E S

“It’s no mystery that one of the essential keys of launching, operating, and growing a suc-
cessful company is sound business planning. However, too many entrepreneurs carry
critical planning records in their heads and never transfer the ideas to paper. This is one
of the critical mistakes owners can make in running a business.”
William Clark, former Executive Director of FastTrac™
You can get assistance in creating a business plan for your e-business idea from a num-
ber of non-profit, governmental, and educational Web sites, such as those of the Service
Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE®) and the Small Business Administration (SBA). These
and similar Web sites provide information about business planning and offer examples of
formal business plan documents. While much of the information offered at these sites is
directed toward brick-and-mortar businesses, most of the tips and examples are also
appropriate for developing a business plan for an e-business. Other sites, such as the Cana-
dian government’s E-Future Centre site, provide business plan guides and tips directed spe-
cifically at e-business startups. Figures 3-1 through 3-3 provide examples of Web sites
with business planning information.

Several e-business Web sites—such as BizPlanIt and Bplans.com—sell business plan
preparation services and programs containing business plan tips and templates (Figures 3-4
and 3-5). They also offer free tips and business plan examples.

a table of contents
●
an executive summary

a description of the business

The arrangement of pages in a business plan and individual page formatting, such as
headings and subheadings, are a matter of style and will vary from plan to plan. While it is
very important to have a professional-looking and error-free business plan document, the
real goal is to create a description that helps a reader clearly understand your startup
e-business idea and when and how you expect it to become profitable.

“When I read a business plan, I look to find the answers to three questions. Is there really
an opportunity here? Can these people pull it off? Will the cash flow?”
Dr. Ray Smilor, President of Beyster Institute at the Rady School at UC San Diego
Cover Sheet and Title Page
A business plan’s cover sheet usually includes the title of the document, the preparer’s
name, the plan copy number, and a “Confidential” notation. When you prepare multiple
copies of a business plan, it is a good idea to number each copy and keep a list of who
has each copy. You should also consider confidentiality; each plan should be clearly marked
as confidential, with a notation that additional copies should not be made.5
An inside cover sheet, or title page, repeats the information from the cover sheet and
can include appropriate contact numbers and the names of key team members. The inside
cover sheet may also include the name of the person to whom the copy of the plan is
assigned. If you can afford it, you may consider adding a custom cover for a bound busi-
ness plan.
The business plan examples in this chapter are for a fictitious startup e-business,
WildCountryTreks.biz, a company that offers custom backcountry backpacking tours and
wilderness survival training. Figure 3-6 and Figure 3-7 illustrate the cover sheet and the
title page, respectively, for the WildCountryTreks.biz sample business plan.

Table of Contents
A business plan’s table of contents should list all the major sections and subsections of the
business plan by page number, allowing the reader to locate key information quickly. It
may be helpful to maintain a table of contents checklist as you prepare different sections
of the plan. You can then review the checklist when preparing the final table of contents.
The final table of contents should not be prepared until the rest of the business plan is
finished. Remember to double-check the final table of contents to look for common mis-
takes such as missing sections or subsections and incorrect page numbering. Obviously, a
table of contents with errors will not help your readers locate information quickly, and will
give them a negative feel for your business before they’ve even read your plan! Figure 3-8

An Evolving E-Business Plan
In the mid 1990s, three Chicago-area entrepreneurs—Christian Crone, Russ W.
Rosenzweig, and Robert Hull—pooled together their business experience and
resources to create a new e-business startup named Round Table Group. Their
e-business idea was to create a virtual matchmaking service between academic
experts and businesses that needed quick answers to very specific questions. The
original Round Table Group business plan envisioned clients from Fortune 500
companies submitting simple, targeted questions via e-mail. Then the Round Table
Group would forward these questions to its roster of pre-screened academic experts
in the field to see which expert wanted to provide the answer.The expert who agreed
to answer the question worked directly with the client company and set his or her
own fees; Round Table Group would then charge the client company a “matchmak-
ing fee.”6
Crone, Rosenzweig, and Hull soon found that what the Round Table Group’s busi-
ness clients really wanted wasn’t part of their original business plan. Instead of short,
targeted answers to specific questions, clients wanted consulting help on projects
that might last for months. In addition, many prospective clients wanted litigation con-
sultation, another service area that was not part of the original business plan. The
Round Table Group’s management moved quickly to revamp its business plan and
give its clients what they wanted. Today, Round Table Group matches more than
10,000 academic, industry, and government experts in several fields (including politi-
cal and social policies, biotechnologies, environmental policies, and international
trade policies) with clients needing consulting services. Round Table Group also pro-
vides expert services to attorneys and investment managers, and manages a cor-
porate learning and speakers’ bureau. The company’s revenues have grown in each
year of operation, and in both 2003 and 2004, Inc. Magazine named Round Table
Group to its list of the 500 fastest-growing private U.S. companies (Figure 3-9).7

Executive Summary
An executive summary is a condensed version of your complete business plan, and is
considered by many to be the most important section of the plan. It enables investors, bank-
ers, and other interested parties to quickly read and understand your e-business idea with-
out having to wade through the entire business plan document. Typically, investors,
bankers, and other sources of funding have more business plans and proposals than they
have time to evaluate; therefore, they use the executive summary page of business plans to
quickly weed out those plans in which they have no interest.8

“A business plan needs to get to the point quickly since most investors will make a deci-
sion within 10 seconds whether to contact the entrepreneur or not. One of the biggest
turn-offs to an investor is a paragraph that starts with ‘The Internet is growing at a tremen-
dous rate.’ You need to get to the beef of the message and get to it quickly.”
Bill Reichert, venture capitalist and Managing Director of Garage Technology Ventures
Keep your executive summary short—one page is best, but if a longer summary is
required, keep it to no more than three pages. A reader should be able to scan your execu-
tive summary quickly and understand how your e-business idea works. Use clear and con-
cise language to describe your e-business idea, and use action words to get the reader’s
attention and generate excitement. Emphasize the reasons why your e-business idea will
be successful, and support these reasons using concrete facts and descriptions. You will
probably want to include brief information on:
●
your staff and management team
●
the marketplace in which your e-business will operate
●
any competitive advantages your e-business will enjoy
●
a summary of financial projections
For best results, save writing the executive summary until you have worked out the
details in the remainder of your business plan. This will enable you to summarize the plan’s
key points more effectively. Figure 3-10 depicts the Executive Summary for the
WildCountryTreks.biz business plan.
You can use either a bulleted list style or narrative paragraphs in your executive
summary. You can also choose to position your executive summary either before or after the
table of contents, but remember: no matter which style you use or where you position your
executive summary in relation to the table of contents, your executive summary is the
first—and perhaps only—part of your business plan that most investors or other inter-
ested parties will read.9
Vision and Mission Statements
Some business plans include a vision and/or mission statement. Although closely related,
a vision statement and a mission statement are often defined differently. A vision
statement can be defined as a formal statement of a business’s hopes and desires, and it is
written to inspire, guide, and encourage its employees toward achieving the business’s
long-term goals. A mission statement is a formal statement that explains—in a few
words—the overall purpose of a business.

“Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision,
and relentlessly drive it to completion.”

FIGURE 3-10
Sample Executive Summary

Many businesses have vision and/or mission statements, but define them in other ways,
such as “corporate identity statements” or “statements of goals, values, and objectives.”
The terms “purpose,” “aspirations,” “ideals,” and “direction,” along with other similar
phrases, are often used interchangeably with the terms “vision” and “mission.” In this
text, we use the term mission statement to broadly define statements about a company’s
philosophy and goals.
Before you attempt to write a mission statement for your startup e-business, you should
examine published examples of various mission statements to see how they reflect com-
pany philosophies. Many businesses and other organizations, such as those noted below,
publish their mission statements on their Web sites, for example:
“Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally acces-
sible and useful.”
Google
“At Microsoft, we work to help people and businesses throughout the world realize their
full potential. This is our mission. Everything we do reflects this mission and the val-
ues that make it possible.”
Microsoft® Corporation
“To grow a profitable airline, that people love to fly and where people love to work.”
Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.
“To provide services for students and other writers in the University community.”
University of Miami College of Arts and Sciences, Writing Center
When writing a mission statement, you can choose to target a single audience or a com-
bined audience made up of employees, customers, competitors, shareholders, the govern-
ment, the press, and the general public. You can also choose to focus your mission
statement on a specific theme such as customer support, quality, leadership, or innovation.
Crafting an effective mission statement that makes your e-business’s purpose clear to
others might take time. You will probably need many drafts, as it may not be easy to iden-
tify the few meaningful words that clearly express your message to your targeted audience.
Thinking very carefully about your e-business idea, goals, and objectives before you begin
is critical to drafting an effective mission statement. You might also find that it is help-
ful to brainstorm with interested others—family members, friends, mentors—as you search
for just the right words for your mission statement.10

Mission statements that are too wordy and too general can be meaningless. For funny examples of how

Rackspace Managed Hosting
As e-businesses evolve, their mission statements will probably also evolve. For
example, here is the original mission statement for Rackspace Managed Hosting, the
managed hosting provider introduced in Chapter 2:
“To profitably enable e-businesses around the world to succeed by providing a
scalable, productized, outsourced, internet server platform for their businesses.”
In the beginning, Rackspace simply rented Web servers to its clients—providing
no other hosting services. This arrangement was similar to that of a traveler arriving
at the airport and renting a car. After renting the car, the traveler is completely
responsible for everything else—getting directions to his or her destination, driving
the car, parking the car, and returning the car after the trip.
Today, Rackspace provides its clients with all the Web hosting services they need,
and thus the business now functions more like a limousine or taxi service that pro-
vides the traveler with a complete transportation package—vehicle, driver, pick up at
the curb, and drop off at the destination. Rackspace has transformed itself from rent-
ing servers to running the servers and being a world-class service provider.
Just as Rackspace’s e-business has evolved, so has its mission statement. Rack-
space’s current mission statement reflects this evolution from equipment renter to
service provider:
“To be recognized as one of the world’s great service companies along with
names like Lexus, Nordstrom, The Ritz-Carlton and
.”
The blank line is deliberate—indicating Rackspace’s long-term goal of adding its
name to this list of great service companies.
Business Description
The business description portion of your business plan should also be brief and include
only pertinent information. It should provide the reader with a summary of your
e-business’s background and business idea. You may also include information about the legal
form of your e-business, when and where your e-business was formed, its history to date,
key personnel, and future goals. Figure 3-11 illustrates a portion of a sample Business
Description section.
Creating an E-Business Plan
87

Products or Services
Your business plan’s products or services section is one of the most important sections
in the plan. In this section, you provide a description of the products or services your
e-business offers and the anticipated sales that each product or service is expected to
generate. When developing this section, be sure to provide enough detail about each
product or service to enhance understanding, but not so much that a reader might be
confused.
If your e-business sells products, you should describe each product in terms that make
clear the product’s benefits to potential customers. You might decide that high-quality
graphics would be helpful in promoting your products. If so, you can include them in your
business plan’s appendix or in a separate catalog. In either case, you would then add a
statement in the products section that refers the reader to the appendix or states that a
product catalog is available upon request. If your e-business is selling a service, describe
the service: what it is, how it works, what makes it unique, and how potential customers can
benefit from it. Figure 3-12 illustrates a sample Products or Services section.
FIGURE 3-11

Chapter 3
88

Marketplace Analysis
A business plan’s marketplace analysis should include information about the specific
industry of which your e-business is a part. It should also include a description of your
e-business’s targeted customers and competitors. You can choose whether to include an
overview of the marketing and sales strategies you will employ to reach your targeted
customers.
Industry Information
An industry includes all the businesses that make or sell similar or complementary prod-
ucts or services. For example, airlines, hotels, and travel agencies are all part of the travel
industry. Auto dealers, tire retailers, and auto maintenance businesses are all part of the
auto industry. Computer hardware manufacturers, software developers, and silicon chip
manufacturers are all part of the computer industry. The industry information in your busi-
ness plan can include industry size, marketplace trends, technology trends, anticipated
labor shortages or other personnel issues, changes in government regulations, or other rel-
evant topics that might affect the success of your e-business.
When putting together your industry information, be sure to use verifiable data that
has been gathered from recognized sources such as government agencies, industry trade
associations, or qualified studies from reliable organizations. Use charts and graphs to
FIGURE 3-12
Portion of a sample Products or Services Section
Creating an E-Business Plan
89

enhance the reader’s understanding of the industry data you include. Charts and graphs
should be large enough to be readable, but not so large that they detract from the overall for-
mat of the plan.11
Targeted Customers
In addition to providing industry information, the marketplace analysis portion of your busi-
ness plan should identify your e-business’s potential customers, changes in consumer pref-
erences, shifts in consumer demographics, and new consumer-oriented technologies or
other advantages your e-business can exploit to attract customers. Your plan should also
define the characteristics of your targeted customers that will affect your e-business’s suc-
cess, including age, gender, income level, education, social class and lifestyle, geographic
location, and buying habits. The targeted customers portion of your marketplace analysis
should clearly explain how your products or services are a good fit with the characteris-
tics of your targeted customers. Some would argue that this section is the most important
part of the marketplace analysis.
Competitors
The marketplace analysis section of your business plan should emphasize your e-business’s
specific competitive advantages and strengths. It must also present a careful analysis of
competitive issues—number of competitors, ease of entry into the marketplace, and so
forth—that will affect your e-business’s success. Each of your major competitors should
be identified by name, and you should include a summary of each competitor’s products and
marketplace strengths and weaknesses. Charts depicting various competitors’ market
share can be helpful.
Marketing and Sales Strategies
The marketplace analysis section should also provide an overview of your e-business’s major
marketing objectives and strategies. You should describe in detail the steps required to
accomplish a business’s marketing objectives—in other words, strategies and tactics that
lead directly to sales and cash flow. Your marketing strategies section should therefore
give details about the following:
●
the features and benefits of the products or services your e-business offers
●
prices and pricing strategies
●
how the products or services will be promoted
●
how the products or services will be distributed
Your business plan might also contain a detailed marketing plan and budget. You will
learn more about how to create a detailed marketing plan in Chapter 6. Figure 3-13 illus-
trates a sample portion of a Marketplace Analysis.

Operational Plan
Traditionally, the operational plan section of a business plan describes a business’s physical
location and equipment, as well as the manufacturing or service actions necessary to get
the business’s products and services to customers. Business location information can
include headquarters location, branch office locations, warehouse space, and manufactur-
ing space. Any competitive advantages inherent in the business’s locations should be noted
in the operational plan section, and a layout of the facilities should be provided in the
appendix. An overview of significant vehicle, computer, office equipment, or manufactur-
ing equipment needs—including purchase or lease costs—should also be supplied.12
An e-business’s operational plan should incorporate these traditional elements where
applicable. But an e-business operational plan should also focus on the operations that are
critical to the specific e-business model or models being followed. For example, if the
e-business is a B2C online store selling physical products, then information about prod-
uct distribution, such as the location of distribution centers or the need for a fleet of spe-
cially designed delivery trucks, should be included. In contrast, an e-business that sells a
FIGURE 3-13

91

service and thus requires a large customer support staff, might emphasize call center loca-
tions and the availability of a labor pool (from which to hire customer support person-
nel) near those locations.
An e-business’s operational plan should also include information on how the
e-business’s Web site is integrated into overall operations. Adding a diagram to the appen-
dix of the Web site elements and a description of each element can help readers better
understand the Web site operations. You can also include a screenshot of the e-business Web
site and information about the internal or outsourced personnel needed to host, create,
and maintain the Web site. Summary information about any special technologies, hard-
ware, and software you will use—and what, if any, advantages this use gives you in the
marketplace—can also be included. Figure 3-14 illustrates a portion of a sample Opera-
tional plan.
Financial Plan
The financial plan section of your business plan explains how your e-business idea, goals,
and strategies translate into profits. It should also show when your e-business will hit the
break-even point after initial funding or investment. You may choose to include a num-
ber of financial documents in your plan, but there are three items that your financial plan
section must include: a pro forma balance sheet, a projected income statement, and a
planned cash flow statement.
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 3-14
Portion of a sample Operational Plan
Chapter 3
92

Pro forma (or projected) financial statements include income, expense, and cash flow
data based on current assumptions of future events. A pro forma balance sheet indi-
cates the value of the e-business’s assets, liabilities, and ownership or equity at a specific
point in time (Figure 3-15). A projected income statement shows the e-business’s
anticipated revenues, expenses, and net profit or loss over a specific period of time
(Figure 3-16). A planned cash flow statement illustrates what cash the e-business plans
to receive over a specific period of time and how it will spend that cash (Figure 3-17). A
business plan generally includes monthly financial statement projections for 12–24 months
in addition to the three-to-five year summary statements shown in Figures 3-15
through 3-17.

to generate the numbers used in the plan, a break-even analysis (Figure 3-18) that identi-
fies the amount of sales needed to cover fixed and variable expenses, and a standard finan-
cial ratios analysis (Figure 3-19) illustrating how well the e-business will perform compared

to other companies in the same industry. You may include an investment proposal, some-
times called a “deal plan,” that lays out to investors how much capital you need and in
what form, the anticipated return on investment (ROI) calculations, and a timeline for
profitability. If your e-business has a financial history, you may also include historical
financial statements.

Management Plan
Because many investors base their investment decisions on the strength of the management
team behind a new venture, a strong management team is critical for a startup e-business.
The management plan section of your business plan should therefore focus on your man-
agement team, including any outside advisors, mentors, and consultants. This section
should provide information about the people on the management team who are or who
will be involved in the day-to-day operations of your e-business. Typically, the informa-
tion about team members is organized into brief narrative descriptions of each person’s title,
duties and responsibilities, previous related experience, previous successes, and
education. You may, in addition, choose to add a detailed resume for each top team mem-
ber in the business plan’s appendices.
FIGURE 3-19
Ratio Analysis example
Chapter 3

Part of the planning process for any startup business is determining what work will be
done in-house by employees and what work will be outsourced to professionals outside
your company. Outsourcing allows you and your management team to concentrate on your
e-business’s core activities, while other professionals focus on areas in which you and your
team lack experience or skills. Examples of activities that businesses outsource include:
●
getting advice from an attorney on the legal form of the e-business, the con-
tent of the business plan, the wording of confidentiality agreements, and con-
tractual obligations
●
having a professional accountant prepare or review your pro forma financial
statements
●
hiring technology professionals to create, maintain, and host your e-business
Web site
Outside advisors can be very important to a startup e-business because they add expe-
rience and background that might be missing from the management team. An impres-
sive Advisory Board of experienced outside advisors can add credibility to an e-business
startup. If your e-business has an Advisory Board, be certain to include the members’
names and other pertinent information. Figures 3-20 and 3-21 show examples of the types
of information you can include in your Management Plan section.

Rackspace Managed Hosting
Because business planning is an ongoing process, the documents generated from
the business planning process are dynamic, changing as new opportunities, threats,
and business needs arise. In the late 1990s, when Elmendorf,Yoo, and Condon—the
three original Rackspace Managed Hosting founders—first pitched their e-business
idea to Graham Weston and Morris Miller, two successful San Antonio-based entre-
preneurs, the trio had not yet created a formal business plan, just a spreadsheet
showing potential profitability.
The spreadsheet analysis illustrated how Rackspace could successfully and prof-
itably follow a B2B subscription e-business model. The analysis also indicated that
the payback period for providing a client with a Web server was only five months. In
addition to these promising projections, Weston and Morris—like the original
founders—were convinced that a focus on customer service and support would keep
customer attrition low and encourage new customer growth. Low customer attri-
tion, new customer growth, and the five-month payback per server projection made
the Web hosting e-business idea very attractive—so attractive that Weston and Mor-
ris agreed to provide seed money for Rackspace and to add their entrepreneurial
experience to the Rackspace management team.
Fortunately, the Rackspace management team’s expectations that the com-
pany would experience low customer attrition and new customer growth panned out.
Before long, it became apparent that Rackspace would need to raise additional funds
to support its rapid growth. But before the Rackspace management team
approached venture capitalists about investing in the company, the team took the time
to prepare a more formal business planning document with components similar to
those illustrated in this chapter.
Issues Analysis and Critical Risks
An issues analysis or risk assessment identifies both threats and opportunities an
e-business encounters from outside influences such as economic changes, impending prod-
uct innovations, technological advancements, environmental issues, government regula-
tions, and any barriers to entry into the market. The analysis should take into account all
potential losses as well as any legal factors, staffing concerns, changes in competitor mar-
ket share, new technologies, or other issues that could have a negative impact on the
e-business. The analysis should also describe the business’s internal strengths or weak-
nesses, such as a lack of managerial expertise among the company’s principals. After you
have determined which issues are most significant, you must prepare a one-page issues
statement that lists these potential problems and the contingency plans you have devel-
oped to resolve them.13
Exit Strategies
Like an issues analysis, a realistic exit strategy provides owners and investors with some
understanding about how they will get their money back from a new venture; it is an
essential feature of a business plan. Your business plan should in fact include a handful of
exit strategies that your e-business can execute in order to enable your investors (and you)
Creating an E-Business Plan
99

to recover their business investments. Some possible exit strategies that your e-business’s
management team might consider include going public with an IPO (initial public offer-
ing), being acquired by another company, selling the company (or any part of it) to other
individuals, and merging with an existing company to form a new company.14
Appendices
The appendices to a business plan can include items that provide additional details to the
plan, such as Web site schematics and Web page descriptions; pictures of products or
details about services; marketing materials; management team resumes; details about order
fulfillment locations and equipment; copies of relevant legal documents, such as leases,
contracts, patents, partnership agreements, incorporation agreements, and licenses; and
any other documentation necessary to support the information included in the other sec-
tions of the plan.
In addition to describing an e-business’s goals and operations, a business plan should
also identify the way the e-business is legally organized.

One of the critical issues in the planning process for an e-business startup is determining
the legal form of organization the new business should adopt. This legal form is noted in
a business plan, often in the business description section, and is supported by documenta-
tion in the appendices. The most common legal forms of organization that businesses adopt
are a sole proprietorship, a partnership, and a corporation.
The simplest form of organization is a sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship is a
business started and operated by an individual; in terms of tax and legal liability, the owner
(proprietor) and the business are considered to be one and the same. This means that a sole
proprietorship does not pay taxes as an entity separate from the owner. Also, legal claims
against the sole proprietorship can be satisfied against an individual owner’s personal
property as well as his or her business assets.15
A partnership is a legal business entity that consists of two or more owners. A general
partnership consists of multiple co-owners of a for-profit business. Partnership arrange-
ments can be complicated, so a written partnership agreement that defines all the details
of the partnership arrangement is very important. Topics that should be covered in the
partnership agreement include:
●
each partner’s capital contribution to the partnership
●
how the partnership’s profits and losses are allocated between the partners
●
what partnership salaries and drawings against profits are allowed
●
the management responsibilities allocated to each partner
●
what happens to the partnership when a partner withdraws, retires, becomes
disabled, or dies
●
how the partnership can be dissolved
In a general partnership, tax and legal liabilities flow through to the individual part-
ners, just as with a sole proprietorship. Profits are distributed to the partners according to
the partnership agreement, and each individual partner pays his or her own taxes. Legal
Chapter 3
100

claims against the partnership can be pursued against any of the partners for any amount,
without regard to the amount of partner’s investment in the partnership or share of its
profits. Individual partners are responsible for the full debts of the partnership and an indi-
vidual partner can bind the entire partnership to a business deal.16
A limited partnership has both a general partner and limited partners. In a limited part-
nership, a general partner assumes management responsibility and unlimited liability for
the partnership. The limited partners have no management participation and are legally
liable only for the amount of their capital contribution plus any specifically accepted
debt.17
Another common legal form for a business to adopt is that of a corporation. A
corporation is a legal and taxable entity separate from its owners and managers. A com-
mon type of corporation is a “C” corporation. The owners of a “C” corporation are its
shareholders. Unlike a sole proprietor or the partners in a partnership, a corporation share-
holder’s legal liability is limited to the extent of his or her investment in the business. A cor-
poration is also a taxpaying entity, and its earnings are actually taxed twice: once as
income to the corporation, and again when shareholders pay taxes on dividends issued by
the corporation.18
Two other forms of organization are the “S” corporation and the limited liability
company. An “S” corporation gives its owners partnership tax status and corporate liabil-
ity protection. An organization must meet very restrictive conditions to qualify for S cor-
poration status. A limited liability company (LLC) combines the limited liability feature
of a corporation with the tax status of a partnership or sole proprietorship. Like a partner-
ship, an LLC may have an operating agreement that distributes profits and losses in many
ways, not just in proportion to the owners’ capital contributions.19, 20
When planning your new e-business’s legal form, keep in mind who the owners are and
who the potential investors will be. For a small group of individual owners and investors,
forming a partnership, an S corporation, or an LLC might be most appropriate. If venture
capital or other professional investors are solicited, if there is a need for the flexibility of
stock options in incentive stock plans, or if there is a plan to take the business public, form-
ing a corporation is a more suitable course of action. In any case, when preparing your
business plan, you should consult with attorneys and accountants to make certain that you
understand the details and ramifications of your state’s laws and the different legal and tax-
able forms your e-business can take.
A business plan should also include a description of the business partnerships which
will play an important role in the business’s future success.

For any business—including an e-business—achieving success depends strongly on the
business’s relationships with its strategic business partners, such as its suppliers and
distributors. Partnering, building alliances, and collaborating with others offer a faster
way to get an e-business’s products and services sold and distributed. An e-business can
have a variety of strategic business partners who provide support for a wide range of busi-
ness activities, including marketing, sales assistance, technology support, and financial
services. As an e-business grows and evolves, old partnerships may dissolve and new part-
nerships may take their place. For startup e-businesses, there are two general categories
Creating an E-Business Plan
101

of partnerships: partnerships that help the e-business build market awareness, and partner-
ships that assist in the actual e-business operations, such as customer service, or ship-
ping and transportation.
For example, the key strategic partners for Rackspace Managed Hosting include its
equipment and software providers, such as Dell, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Red Hat,
Inc., as well as a number of Web designers who comfortably recommend Rackspace to their
clients based on the managed hosting e-business’s dedication to customer support as
emphasized by its business slogan—Fanatical Support™.
Startup e-businesses are not the only businesses that benefit from e-partnerships. New
e-business partnerships have been formed by traditional brick-and-click retailers who find
new and different ways to use the Internet to create and exploit new strategic
partnerships. One example of a traditional brick-and-click business forming an
e-partnership is the story of PartsAmerica.com, an e-business partnership that provides
broader and more efficient distribution of auto parts and accessories.
The original PartsAmerica.com partners were Advance Auto Parts and CSK Auto, two
major auto parts retailers who became e-partners in order to offer automotive parts and
delivery options to both the B2B and B2C automotive marketplace. At the time the initial
e-partnership was formed, Advance Auto Parts was ranked second in the Aftermarket Busi-
ness Auto Chain Report Top 50 and had more than 1,600 stores in 37 states (primarily in the
East, Midwest, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands). CSK Auto was ranked third in the same
report, with 1,120 stores in 17 states, primarily in the western United States. Today, the
PartsAmerica.com partnership also includes Checker Auto Parts, Schuck’s Auto Supply, and
Kragen Auto Parts. By partnering together as PartsAmerica.com, these five companies ben-
efit from being able to cover 50 states, with a total of 3,000 local stores for parts pickup,
delivery, and returns, and having an inventory of more than $1 billion. PartsAmerica.com
customers benefit from broader product options, same-day or overnight delivery, and
in-store order pickup and returns across the country.
To identify appropriate strategic partnerships, take a careful look at the information
already included in your business plan, in particular your product and service offerings and
your targeted customers. Careful analysis might reveal areas in which your e-business
could benefit from various partnerships. Ask for recommendations from mentors and advi-
sors, and keep a close monitor on your competitors’ partnering activity. Once you have
identified potential partners with whom you might make mutually advantageous strategic
partnership arrangements, you can begin the process of contacting them. When you enter
into a strategic partnership, remember to formalize the arrangements you make in a con-
tract containing clearly identified expectations for both partners, a specific period of time
for the contract obligations, and an exit clause. Remember also to include a reference to
these key partnerships in your business plan as part of the startup phase of your
e-business.
A credible, professional business plan that describes your e-business idea; illustrates
your products or services and how they will be marketed; shows how your e-business opera-
tions can make money; and lists its management team, advisors, and key partners, can be
a map to success for your new e-business. In the next chapter, you learn about ways to
fund your startup e-business.

One of the judges during the first round of the Stanford business school’s entrepreneur-
ial contest was Dave Wharton, an associate at the venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers. Wharton thought the online bridal registry was such a good idea that
he contacted Lefcourt and DiLullo after the first round of judging. Following a series of con-
versations, Lefcourt and DiLullo decided to pull their plan out of the contest. They were
getting serious about it and didn’t want to circulate their idea too widely. Kleiner Per-
kins funded Lefcourt and DiLullo’s online gift registry idea, and the e-business Della &
James, named for the two characters in O. Henry’s story “The Gift of the Magi,” was born.
Lefcourt and DiLullo left Stanford at the end of that first year to enter Della & James in
the estimated $45 billion-per-year bridal registry market.21
During the first year after funding, Lefcourt and DiLullo concentrated on creating part-
nerships with retailers and hiring staff. By the time the Della & James Web site was
launched in 1999, the e-business had 50 employees, including CEO Rebecca Patton, for-
merly a senior vice president with E*TRADE Group. Della & James’ retail partners
included Crate & Barrel, Neiman Marcus Group, Williams-Sonoma, Dillard’s, Recre-
ational Equipment, and Gump’s, a well-known San Francisco specialty retailer.22, 23
In 2000, Tiffany & Co. acquired a 5 percent stake in Della & James, and the e-business,
whose name was soon simplified to Della.com, became the exclusive wedding registry
partner for Tiffany’s. Shortly after partnering with Tiffany’s, Della.com merged with the
WeddingChannel.com (Figure 3-22). Today, customers can use the WeddingChannel.com’s
patented registry system to search more than 1.5 million gift registries. As of 2005,
WeddingChannel.com customers had used these gift registries to purchase more than
$100 million in gifts.24, 25, 26

Using links on this text’s student online companion, tour the following business planning
sites: the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Service Core of Retired Executives
(SCORE), the Small Business Advancement National Center at the University of Central
Arkansas (SBANC), and E-Future Centre. Create a table of features for each site you
review, then report back to your class on the Web site features and how an individual start-
ing a new e-business can benefit from them.
Case Projects
1.
You have been thinking about creating a new e-business to sell your custom needlework
designs, needlework supplies, and the completed handcrafted needlework projects you
accept on consignment. You decide it’s time to get serious about your idea. Draft a busi-
ness description section for your e-business’s business plan and include the types of
e-partnerships that would benefit your e-business.
2.
You and three close friends are all freelancers: a technical writer, a Web designer, and a com-
puter programmer. Each of you would like a better way to make contact with potential clients.
Over dinner, the three of you decide that creating an online freelance talent “matchmak-
ing service” that matched freelancers with clients who needed help on specific projects
would be a great e-business idea. But before you go any further, you want to know if other
e-businesses are currently offering this type of online service. Using online search tools or
other relevant sources, identify e-businesses that currently offer freelance talent match-
making services; then draft a brief portion of a marketplace analysis that describes the major
competitors in the marketplace. If you need to see examples of industry or marketplace
analysis sections, use links on this text’s student online companion to review sample busi-
ness plans.
3.
You are the product manager for an exclusive line of cosmetics and fragrances, sold in shop-
ping mall kiosks, which is targeted to teenage girls. You are considering submitting a pro-
posal to your management team to encourage the company to begin selling its products
online. To prepare the proposal, you need to learn more about the online buying habits of
teenage girls. Using Web sites and other relevant sources, research the online buying hab-
its of teenage girls; then draft the targeted customer portion of a marketplace analysis for
your proposal.
Team Project
You and several associates are planning to start a new e-business that sells Web site design ser-
vices to other businesses. Your first step is to draft the e-business’s description, the business
concept, and a mission statement. Working together with your assigned team members, define
your e-business’s concept and description, and then draft its mission statement. Make certain that
the mission statement:
1.
reflects the e-business’s purpose
2.
is succinctly worded
Creating an E-Business Plan
107

3.
uses meaningful and understandable language
4.
addresses a clearly defined target audience or audiences
As a group, present the e-business concept and mission statement to your classmates and
your instructor. After your presentation, ask your classmates to evaluate your mission statement.
They should address the clarity of your wording, try to identify your target audience(s), and
appraise the effectiveness of the mission statement in conveying its message to the targeted
audience(s).
After your mission statement has been evaluated, prepare, at the direction of your instruc-
tor, a complete business plan for the e-business, including (but not limited to) the following
components: cover sheet, title page, executive summary, services section, marketplace analy-
sis, and operational, financial, and management plans. Limit the business plan to 30 pages or less.

At first, Kannan Srinivasan, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Penn-
sylvania, was just looking for a way to save money when he decided to hire a moonlight-
ing computer technician to set up his new computer system. But this was the late 1990s,
and e-business was booming. Like many other Internet-savvy professionals, Srinivasan
wondered if people like him, who found themselves with an immediate need for tempo-
rary professional help, might appreciate the convenience of finding such help from an
online service. He soon began toying with ways this idea could be turned into an
e-business—an online marketplace that would bring together employers with short-term
projects and self-employed or moonlighting professionals looking for work.
continued

Serendipitously, Srinivasan ran into a former student, Inderpal Guglani, a business
planner with FedEx. The two men began discussing the idea, and it wasn’t long before they
pooled their resources (about $60,000), and Emoonlighter, an online freelance talent mar-
ketplace, was born.1 Emoonlighter courted employers by providing special services,
such as helping them prepare the necessary tax documents associated with hiring con-
tract employees, and it charged moonlighting professionals a fee for each job they secured
through the Emoonlighter marketspace.
In the beginning, Emoonlighter made a ripple rather than a splash in the existing
online freelance talent marketplace. At the time, the industry already consisted of at least
ten e-business competitors, including Ants.com, Elance.com, and the San Francisco-
based Guru.com, who were backed by more than $250 million in total venture capital
funding.2 With limited funds, two employees, and an office in the basement of Guglani’s
home, what chance did Emoonlighter have to succeed against its well-funded rivals?

As an entrepreneur starting a new e-business, you must be prepared to invest time, effort,
and your own money to get your new e-business off the ground. As you learned in a Chap-
ter 1, the hard work you put in to building your e-business creates value in the business in
the form of sweat equity. But in addition to this sweat equity, you must be prepared to
invest cash in your e-business startup. Starting an e-business can involve a myriad of basic
operational activities such as building a Web prototype, doing market research, paying
rent, and leasing office equipment. To pay for these and other various expenses, entrepre-
neurs of startups often find themselves drawing on personal savings, mortgaging per-
sonal assets, or obtaining a personal loan. Some creative entrepreneurs manage to avoid
borrowing money and raising equity financing by finding unique and inventive ways to
acquire resources for their startups—this type of self-funding is known as bootstrapping.
Many entrepreneurs, however, find that they can’t finance the start up of their new busi-
ness on their own, and therefore raise money by turning to two major groups of investors:
informal investors and venture capitalists.
Informal Investors
Informal investors include friends and family members who invest in a business, and angel
investors, which you’ll learn about in a moment. According to a July, 2004 report by the
Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) at Babson College, informal investors in the U.S.
contributed more money for startups and growing businesses—more than $100
billion—than professional investors, making informal investors the “lifeblood of U.S.
entrepreneurship.”3 The GEM report also notes two other important findings:
●
Almost 20 percent of adults surveyed reported that they had invested in some-
one else’s private business in the prior three years.
●
More than half of all informal investing is made by relatives.

Many entrepreneurs discover that they can successfully tap their network of friends
and family for a solid round of funding that helps cover a startup e-business’s legal fees, Web
site prototype development, and other out-of-pocket expenses until additional funding is
secured. Another benefit of financing from family and friends is that family and friends who
know and trust you are likely to stand by you during tough times in the startup process,
such as when building your customer base takes longer than projected. This is because they
are largely investing in you rather than in your e-business idea.

“We weren’t betting on the Internet [with a $300,000 investment]. We were betting
on Jeff.”

But there is a downside to accepting startup money from family members and friends:
the risk of jeopardizing personal relationships with business misunderstandings. For
example, you may think of the $5,000 Uncle Phil gives you for your new e-business as a loan
or gift, while he may think he is buying equity in your business and is entitled to a por-
tion of its future earnings. To avoid misunderstandings that might strain a personal rela-
tionship, follow a few simple rules:4, 5
●
Make certain that your family member or friend understands that an e-business
startup is a risky proposition. Find out how that person would feel if you
weren’t able to give the money back.
●
Don’t let a family member or friend invest any money that he or she cannot
afford to lose.
●
Provide the same marketing material to a family member or friend that you
would provide to any investor, enabling the person to make an informed invest-
ment decision about your business proposition.
●
Deal with a family member or friend the same as you would deal with a stranger
and make it clear you’re doing so for the benefit of both of you. Keep the fund-
ing transaction “at arm’s length,” and require legal documentation for the
transaction.
Funding from your network of family members and friends may be the easiest money
you will ever find, so this is a great way to obtain enough money to get started. After tap-
ping into your family and friends network, your next step in financing your startup
e-business is to seek funding from angel investors.
The term “angel investor” originally referred to wealthy investors in Broadway theatri-
cal productions who swooped down and saved shows from going bankrupt. Now angel
investor commonly refers to an individual with money and time who enjoys the excite-
ment of investing in the early stages of a new business and is not averse to taking risks.
According to the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire, angels
invested more than $20 billion in startups in 2004—20 percent more than the previous
year. Also, the rate of angel investment is expected to continue growing in the future, at
about 10 percent a year.6 Unlike friends and family investors, who typically invest in the

entrepreneur, angel investors are primarily interested in the e-business idea. A typical angel
investment can range from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand dollars.7
Perhaps one of the more well-known examples of angel investing involves Andy
Bechtolsheim, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, and two young Stanford University gradu-
ate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In the late 1990s, Page and Brin were develop-
ing a new type of search engine which they called “BackRub.” When they decided to start
a company in order to commercialize their search engine, they went looking for inves-
tors and managed to snag an early morning meeting with Bechtolsheim. Bechtolsheim was
in a hurry and had no time to listen to a detailed pitch for the new e-business, so Page and
Brin gave him a quick demo. Bechtolsheim quickly grasped the new search engine’s
potential and right on spot wrote out a check for $100,000 made payable to Google, Inc.,
the name of Page and Brin’s new company. Bechtolsheim’s investment clearly paid
off—especially when Google went public in August, 2004 with an IPO valued at about $1.67
billion.8, 9

“My whole strategy in dealing with companies is that if I can’t figure out what they’re doing
in a 15-minute phone call, I’m not interested. If it makes sense, then I’ll listen to more.
I invest in companies that make sense to me, companies that are doing things that need to
be done. If I like the idea, other people probably do too.”
Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems and angel investor
Although many angels operate alone, some are now participating in investment clubs
(also known as syndicates, associations, forums, or networks) through which they can
combine their investments with other angels and thus spread their investment risk. An
investor who wishes to join an angel investment club must qualify as an accredited
investor under federal securities law, which means he or she must have a minimum net
worth of $1 million, or an individual income of at least $200,000 per year, or a household
income of $300,000 per year in each of the two most recent years.10 Additionally, each
angel investment club has its own membership criteria, and usually includes a financial
commitment to the club itself.
One well-known angel investment club is Band of Angels founded in 1994 by Hans
Severiens. Severiens, a former executive and venture capitalist, realized the advantages of
pooling his resources together with other angel investors. In addition to minimizing the
risk of an investment by spreading it out over a number of investors, a network of inves-
tors would offer a variety of expertise that individual investors could tap in order to
quickly assess whether a new business was a good investment. Severiens brought together
several Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and retired high-tech executives to create Band of
Angels, which today has more than 100 members. They meet monthly to review presenta-
tions from three new entrepreneurs whose business plans have gone through a rigorous
pre-screening process. Focusing on high-tech companies, Band of Angels members invest
individually in the range of $300,000 to $750,000. As of 2004, Band of Angels members
had invested more than $100 million in 151 companies (Figure 4-1).11

Of Angels and E-Mail
One high-profile investment made by Band of Angels members was a $4 million
investment in Sendmail, Inc. Sendmail has its origins in an e-mail server software pro-
gram that was released to the open source community in 1981 by Eric Allman, who
at the time was a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley. The
software, which was free, made it possible to forward e-mail from one network to
another. The Sendmail software became so popular that Allman began spending
much of his time providing support to Sendmail users, including corporate users
such as AOL and Earthlink. After giving free support to Sendmail users for a few years,
Allman decided that there was a business opportunity in selling packaged Send-
mail software with full service and support. In 1998, he teamed up with Greg Olsen,
a Cornell graduate, to form Sendmail, Inc.
In July 1998, Allman and Olsen raised $6 million from angel investors: the $4 mil-
lion from Band of Angels members, and another $2 million from the co-founders of
Sun Microsystems, Andy Bechtolsheim and Bill Joy.12 Today, Sendmail, Inc. custom-
ers include major companies from a variety of industries, such as Fidelity Invest-
ments (financial services), Johnson & Johnson (healthcare), Starbucks (retail), and
the Executive Office of the President (U.S. government).13 The Sendmail e-mail
server and security software runs on 40 percent of all Internet e-mail servers and is
used to deliver 70 percent of all global e-mail messages (Figure 4-2).14

One way to find angel investors is to ask family members, friends, and business asso-
ciates for referrals to angel investors in your area. Another way to locate information on
angel investors is to search the Web; a good place to start is the Active Capital Web site (Fig-
ure 4-3). Active Capital is a spin off of the Angel Capital Electronic Network (ACE-Net), an
online venue for entrepreneurs looking for angel investors and angel investors looking
for investment opportunities. ACE-Net was originally created in the late 1990s through a
collaborative effort by the Small Business Administration and various academic and non-
profit communities. Active Capital, which was formed in 2004, is allowed to match entre-
preneurs and accredited investors across state boundaries as a result of protective rulings by
the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state regulators.15 The Active Capital
Web site and databases are managed by the Office of Technology Transfers and Commer-
cialization (OTTC) at California State University at San Bernardino.

When presenting your e-business idea to an angel investor, remember that even though
how you present yourself is important (and that it does help to have management experi-
ence on your e-business’s team), the potential investor is most interested in how your
e-business fills a marketplace need. Angel investors can provide what might be the first sig-
nificant funds available to you and can usually provide experience and advice. Individual
angels generally invest a relatively small amount in each new business that catches their
interest; investment angel clubs or networks may be able to provide a larger amount of
startup funds.

Rackspace Managed Hosting
In 1999, soon after Graham Weston and Morris Miller brought their management
expertise and investment dollars to Rackspace Managed Hosting, business was
booming. Before long, Weston and Miller needed to find additional funding to pay
for the company’s expansion into European markets—and they did. In January 2000,
Rackspace secured $6.3 million in investments: $2.5 million from members of the
Rackspace management team, and the rest from two angel investor groups, Teton
Capital and Isom Capital. In April 2000, Rackspace received an additional round
of funding in the amount $11.5 million from three venture capitalists: Sequoia Capi-
tal, Norwest Venture Partners, and Red Hat, Inc. Altogether, Rackspace managed to
secure more than $27 million in venture capital funding from 1999 until February,
2001, when the e-business became profitable and no further equity funding was
necessary.

After you secure startup seed money from your personal capital and investments from
informal investors such as family, friends, and angels, you should attempt to solicit your
next round of funding from one or more venture capital investors.
Venture Capital Investors
A venture capitalist (VC) firm is a professional investment company that provides funds
for startup businesses, generally in exchange for an equity position in the new business.
Venture capital firms raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for new businesses
from sources such as endowments, insurance companies, and pension funds. Some promi-
nent VCs include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Murphree Venture Partners, and Sigma
Partners. According to The MoneyTree™Survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Thomson
Venture Economics, and the National Venture Capital Association, VCs were on track in
2005 to fund $20-$23 billion in investments.16 But VCs can provide a new e-business with
more than just money. These firms can also offer extensive knowledge about specific indus-
tries and access to important contacts.
VCs come in many flavors: from traditional partnerships of two or more wealthy indi-
viduals to professionally managed investment groups, from government-sponsored invest-
ment companies to the corporate funding programs of high-tech companies that consider
funding technology startups a way to extend their own research and development
interests.17 In general, VCs invest anywhere from $250,000 to $1,500,000 in the early stages
of a new business, and may be prepared to offer several million dollars over the course of
the business’s life. Examples of VCs and the successful e-business startups they have
funded include Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) and Hotmail; Kleiner Perkins Caufield &
Byers and Google; the SBA’s Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) program and
America Online; and Motorola Ventures and Web portal developer Epicentric. Figures 4-4
and 4-5 illustrate the Web sites of two of these VCs.

When seeking VC funding, you should strive to find venture capital firms whose inter-
ests would fit well with your e-business’s focus and its investment needs. Often VCs invest
in a portfolio of complementary businesses, each of which adds value to the overall
portfolio. Many VCs focus their investments in a specific industry, or they participate in spe-
cific funding rounds, such as seed or startup money, first round funding, or growth fund-
ing for new product development by established companies. Also, VCs often limit their
investments to businesses in a specific geographic area. Therefore, it is a good idea to begin
by researching the VCs in your area.
For each VC that might make a good match with your e-business, you should find out
about the VC’s principal investors, its management team and staff, and its investment strat-
egies and history before you approach the company for funding. The VC firms you target
through your research probably receive hundreds of business plans each year, and they
give serious consideration to only a few of these plans—those with an exciting e-business
idea backed by sound market research and an experienced management team.18 One of
the best ways to approach a VC is to arrange a face-to-face meeting with a principal through
a source the VC knows and trusts—such as an accountant or attorney or other business
professional—or to have your business plan submitted to the VC through the trusted
source.19

While there are numerous advantages to obtaining VC investments, you should be
aware of some significant downsides. In exchange for receiving VC funding for your
e-business, you can expect to give up a large stake in your e-business’s equity. The typi-
cal equity percentage is in the 30-40 percent range, but depending on your situation, this
can vary greatly—anywhere from 10 percent if you acquire growth funding for an already
established company, to as much as 90 percent for a startup. You can also expect to have one
or more of the VC principals on your board of directors, because a VC investor firm will
want to be actively involved in any strategic business decisions that could change your
e-business’s direction or deplete its resources.
Whether you are soliciting funding from your friends and family network, angel inves-
tors, or venture capital firms, you need to be ready to pitch your e-business to investors.

The first meeting with a potential investor of any type is a sales meeting. Your immediate
objective is to get the potential investor excited about your e-business idea and inter-
ested in pursuing more extensive discussions that might lead to financing. When pitching
to an angel or VC investor, the first meeting is likely to be brief, about one hour in length.
Come prepared, be on time, and bring everything you need with you.20
At a first meeting, you should present a brief pitch document rather than your entire
business plan (although you should be ready to provide the plan upon request). A pitch
document is a short marketing document about one to three pages in length based on the
Executive Summary portion of your business plan. The pitch document should briefly
highlight a market need, how your e-business meets this need, what potential profits you
expect, and how your e-business’s management team can make it all happen.

One of the strategies that entrepreneurs and VC investors implement in order to recover their invest-
ments in a new e-business is to take that business public. Going public is not a simple matter; there-
fore e-businesses that are serious about going public should consult with their attorneys about the
ramifications of a public stock offering, including how to file the appropriate documents. For a brief over-
view of the IPO process, check out the Initial Public Offerings Web page at the CCH Business Owner’s Tool-
kit Web site.
Chapter 4
120

Your pitch document should be the basis of your verbal presentation or pitch. You can
supplement your pitch visually by creating an easy-to-understand slide show presenta-
tion using Microsoft PowerPoint or a similar tool. But keep the slide presentation brief—no
more than 10-15 slides. If you plan to make a slide show presentation, remember to bring
a laptop computer, a projector, an extra projector bulb, and an extra copy of your slide
show on portable media such as a diskette or flash drive. Be sure to bring printed copies
of your slide show just in case your equipment malfunctions.21
Your pitch to investors, supported by your pitch document and slide show, should:
●
define your product or service
●
identify who will buy your product or service and how much they will pay
for it
●
describe your key industry competitors, and describe how your product or ser-
vice is differentiated from those of your competitors
●
explain how much it will cost to provide the product or service
●
make clear when the investor(s) can expect your e-business to be profitable
and thus earn a return on the investment
●
illustrate the planned exit strategies both for the investor(s) and for your
e-business principals
●
specify how much money you are looking for and how you will spend it
Expect potential investors to ask questions during your pitch in order to determine how
well you understand your e-business, your target market, your competitors, and critical
marketplace issues. Also be prepared to field questions about any potential risks or prob-
lems associated with your e-business idea, and point out how your e-business is posi-
tioned to handle those risks or problems. If you do not have an answer to a particular
question, don’t try to pretend that you do. Simply acknowledge that you need to do fur-
ther research on the issue and move on.

Zipping Along to an IPO
It is critical to prepare in advance for each meeting with potential investors by hav-
ing your handout materials organized and reviewed, by practicing your presentation,
and by trying to anticipate the possible questions so that you can give decisive
answers. If you think all this preparation is “overkill,” just ask Scott Kucirek, co-founder
and Executive Vice President of ZipRealty, about his experiences pitching a new
startup to investors.
Kucirek and his partner, Juan Mini, began planning to start their own e-business
while they were working their way through business school at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley in the late 1990s. By the time they graduated in 1999, Kucirek
and Mini had secured $1.7 million from Vanguard Venture Partners and a group of
angel investors led by Barrington Partners.22 By August 1999, their new
e-business—an online real estate brokerage business named ZipRealty.com—was
up and running. Later that year, ZipRealty secured $16 million in a second round of
financing; this involved the two original investors but was led by a venture capital firm
named Benchmark Capital.23

Getting Your E-Business Off the Ground
121

But Kucirek and Mini learned a few hard lessons along the way to getting that
financing.Their first lesson was about being careful and being brief.The original busi-
ness plan for ZipRealty.com contained 40 pages of text, with 20 pages of financial
statements and projections. After scheduling a series of presentations to various
investors, Kucirek and Mini decided to revise some of their handout material, but in
their haste, they mixed up the revised pages. Unfortunately, this mix-up was discov-
ered on the way to an actual presentation, and so they had to stop, fix the errors, and
then re-copy and re-bind the handout material. Then, things went from bad to worse.
During their presentation, Kucirek and Mini noticed that there were inconsistencies
in the name of their proposed e-business on several of their charts. Not surprisingly,
no one expressed interest in investing in ZipRealty after that presentation. After this
disastrous start, Kucirek and Mini managed to pare their business plan down to 20
pages and developed procedures for making sure their material was carefully
reviewed before future presentations.24
Another lesson Kucirek and Mini learned was the need to practice their presen-
tation and try to anticipate questions from potential investors. The day before one
investor meeting, Kucirek and Mini were unexpectedly asked to bring along two other
members of their management team who had real estate experience and could dis-
cuss why buyers and sellers would use ZipRealty’s services. Unfortunately, the
busy ZipRealty.com management team hadn’t set aside enough time prior to the
meeting to consider the various questions that might come up and practice their
answers. During the meeting, the potential investors asked questions that the man-
agement team members were unable to answer; the presentation went nowhere. Con-
tinuing to learn from their mistakes, Kucirek, Mini, and the others on the management
team made certain that they practiced their pitch before each future meeting.25
Through luck, perseverance, and the ability to learn from their mistakes, the Zip-
Realty team members managed to “get their act together” and eventually began
receiving serious interest from investors such as Vanguard Venture Partners, Bar-
rington Partners, Benchmark Capital, and Pyramid Technology Ventures. By May
2001, ZipRealty was profitable in some of its metropolitan markets.26 By 2003, Zip-
Realty had doubled its annual revenues to $34 million, and it received another infu-
sion of capital from its VCs.27 And in November 2004, ZipRealty (Nasdaq: ZIPR)
inaugurated a $69 million IPO.28 With more than 1,000 employees, ZipRealty now
represents buyers and sellers in 13 metropolitan markets in 10 states and Washing-
ton, D.C., and the e-business generates more than $60 million a year in revenues
(Figure 4-6).29

“Investors don’t like improvised presentations, we found. The VCs asked questions we
hadn’t anticipated. We ended up making references to an Austin Powers movie and giv-

the last time we went anywhere unrehearsed.”
Scott Kucirek, co-founder and Executive Vice President of ZipRealty
During your pitch, be certain to differentiate yourself and your management team from
the competition by describing how your team’s background and experiences position your
e-business for success. Be enthusiastic. Give examples that show a real commitment to
your e-business, and that create the feeling that your e-business idea is a viable, exciting
opportunity for your investors. The value of learning as much as you can about your poten-
tial investors before meeting with them should not be underestimated; use your research
to establish a good fit between your e-business idea and their existing portfolio of businesses.

If an angel investor or VC firm is interested in your e-business, you might receive a term
sheet. A term sheet is a list of the major terms or conditions of a proposed financing
arrangement being offered by the investor, and is used to start negotiations for the invest-
ment deal. The term sheet will include a valuation of your e-business. For example, if the
investor proposes to invest $200,000 in your e-business for 10 percent equity, then the
investor values your e-business at $2 million. Term sheets can also include demands for a
certain class of stock, automatic buyouts in case of an acquisition, seats on your e-business’s
board of directors, and other contingencies. Because term sheets can be very compli-
cated, you should have them reviewed by an attorney experienced in negotiations with
investors before agreeing to any investment deal. You can find an example of a term sheet
and other investor-related legal documents at the National Venture Capital Association
(NVCA) Web site illustrated in Figure 4-7.
Pitching your e-business to investors can garner tremendous gains in funding and, in
the case of VC firms, valuable expertise and contacts; but it is an involved process that
requires patience and perseverance, and getting good results can sometimes depend on
sheer luck and timing. Another way to help get your e-business off the ground is with a
business incubator.

Before soliciting equity funding you should consult with a qualified attorney who has experience in invest-
ments and securities. Federal or state securities laws may require you to have an attorney prepare an offer-
ing document, known as a private placement memorandum. A private placement memorandum
discloses the benefits and risks of an investment in your e-business to potential private investors.

Business incubators, sometimes called business accelerators, are non-profit organi-
zations (usually sponsored by local governments, businesses, and universities) or commer-
cial businesses that nurture startup businesses by offering fee-based business development
and administrative-support services or by providing such services for a percentage of
ownership equity in the startup company. The average startup business remains part of a
business incubator’s portfolio of companies for about three years. As you will learn shortly,
the services that non-profit and commercial business incubators offer are various, but gen-
erally include office space, telecommunications hookups, reception and conference room
areas, computer networking facilities, Web site design and hosting, clerical support, men-
toring, and referrals to potential investors. An alternative way that entrepreneurs can get
access to such business-support services is through self-incubation, whose advantages
and disadvantages will be detailed at the end of this section.
Non-Profit Business Incubators
Approximately 90 percent of the nearly 1,000 business incubators in the U.S. are non-profit
organizations.30 A non-profit business incubator is often a cooperative venture between
a university and the local community designed to stimulate and support the growth of
local business startups. For example, the Austin Technology Incubator (ATI) at the Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin provides startup technology companies with a variety of services,
such as business consulting, arranging for CEO mentors, providing advisory review boards,
offering referrals for financing, and helping with market research (Figure 4-8). ATI-
incubated companies also have access to office space and furniture, conference rooms, and
telecommunications services. Along with the support of the University of Texas, ATI
receives funding from the City of Austin and the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, and
charges fees of the startups that participate in its incubation program. Additionally,
startup companies grant ATI a one-percent ownership equity.31 Similar business incuba-
tors or accelerators supported by local government, area businesses, and universities are the
Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) at the Georgia Institute of Technol-
ogy, the Houston Technology Center, and the Illinois Technology Enterprise Center (ITEC)
at Northwestern University Evanston Research Park. Figures 4-9 through 4-11 illustrate
the Web sites for these non-profit business incubators.
An interesting private non-profit business incubator is the Women’s Technology Clus-
ter (WTC), which incubates women-led startup companies and promotes entrepreneur-
ship for women (Figure 4-12). Initially funded by Catherine Muther, a former vice president
of corporate marketing for Cisco Systems and now president of the Three Guineas Foun-
dation, WTC now gets support from a number of government, philanthropic, and business
organizations, such as The Kapor Foundation, The Kauffman Foundation, Citibank, Wells
Fargo, Pillsbury Winthrop LLP, and the City and County of San Francisco.32 Women-
owned startups incubated by WTC include MsMoney.com (a financial services Web por-
tal for women), Quantum Intech, Inc. (a provider of stress management programs and
training), and Remedy Interactive (a provider of risk management technologies and con-
sulting services).33

If you’re an entrepreneur needing funding for the early-stages of your startup e-business, you may qualify
for state-funded bridge grants (short-term funding grants intended to help you keep afloat while you are
looking for other more substantial financing), or other assistance from state or academic organizations.
When seeking funding, you should check with your state agencies and local universities for economic
development programs to see what kind of assistance is available in your area.

Commercial Business Incubators
Commercial business incubators are commercial businesses that typically charge fees
and require a large share of ownership equity for providing startup companies with business-
development services. One of the first commercial business incubators on record is the
Batavia Industrial Center (BIC). In the 1940s and 50s, Massey-Harris Ferguson, Ltd. was a
heavy equipment manufacturer that occupied approximately 850,000 square feet of build-
ing space in Batavia, New York. The company was the area’s largest employer until 1956,
when it closed its Batavia factory, leaving thousands of people out of work and a large manu-
facturing complex sitting empty and unused.34 In 1959, the Mancuso family purchased the
empty complex and charged one of its family members, Joseph, with the responsibility

When Joseph Mancuso was unable to find a single employer large enough to fill the
entire complex, he named the building the Batavia Industrial Center (BIC) and started rent-
ing space to startup and small businesses. Then he did whatever he could to help the
startups and small businesses grow. One of the first businesses in the BIC was a Connecti-
cut chicken hatchery, or incubator. Playing on the incubator idea, Mancuso began describ-
ing the BIC as a “business incubator.” Under the direction of Joseph Mancuso, who
eventually came to be known as the “father of business incubation,” and his son Tom, more
than 1,100 businesses have gotten their start at the BIC.35 Today the BIC is managed by
the Mancuso Business Development Group (Figure 4-13).
During the economic and dot-com boom of the late 1990s, many new commercial or for-
profit business incubators, such as Idealab, eCompanies, and Cambridge Incubators, formed
with the hope that they could accelerate the growth of hot new e-businesses that could
quickly—sometimes within three to twelve months—be spun out on their own and start to
generate huge profits for investors. It was not uncommon for many of these new commercial
business incubators—some of whom called themselves Internet accelerators—to demand
up to 60 percent or more equity in an e-business startup and to charge these startups monthly

fees for using their services.36 The economic downturn in 2000-2001 that led to the dot-com
bust also wreaked havoc on many new commercial business incubators who focused on star-
tup e-businesses. Some, like Digital Hatchery and i-Incubator, shut down. Others, such as Ide-
alab and eCompanies, are still active, maintaining substantial portfolios of incubating
companies. Critics of commercial business incubators suggest that giving up so much equity
makes the cost of incubation too high for entrepreneurs. But proponents counter that some
entrepreneurs require more guidance and thus may be more willing to give up a measure of
independence and equity in exchange for that guidance. Such entrepreneurs like the low-risk
option of starting a business that commercial business incubators offer.

Incubating Veritas Medicine
In the late 1990s, Stephen Knight, a licensed physician and MBA graduate from the Yale
School of Organization and Management, knew he had a good e-business idea.Knight’s
idea was to create a Web-based database of clinical drug trials that would be avail-
able to both patients and pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies run
clinical trials on drugs being developed, but often the details of those trials are kept secret
for competitive reasons. Many people are willing to participate in these trials to get free
medical examinations and free medications or to benefit from cutting-edge research,
but they do not know how to find out about them.Knight reasoned that by providing a com-
prehensive Web-based database of trial sites, along with crucial medical information,
both patients and pharmaceutical companies could win. Patients could locate and enroll
in the trials easily, and the pharmaceutical companies could fill their trials faster, thereby
bringing their drugs to market sooner and saving millions of dollars in the process. But

Knight, who had just become president and chief operating officer of a medical supply firm,
needed someone else to get the e-business off the ground; so he called on a friend from Yale
Medical School, Robert Adelman. Adelman, a board-certified physician with a consulting and
entrepreneurial background, agreed to become chief operating officer for the e-business ven-
ture, now named Veritas Medicine.37
At first, after several months of trying, Knight and Adelman were unsuccessful in
securing venture capital funding; then, as part of a last-ditch effort, they pitched their
e-business idea to Cambridge Incubator (CI). By early September 1999, the Veritas
team had signed a deal with CI and a venture capital firm, SeaFlower Ventures, that pro-
vided seed money, office space and furniture, phones, a T-1 line, and a computer
network. This deal transformed Veritas Medicine from an entrepreneur’s dream into an
operating company. As part of the deal, CI would also provide Veritas Medicine with
access to the professional services that e-business startups need, such as access toWeb
developers, lawyers, public relations and marketing specialists, and human resources
specialists, as well as introductions to other funding sources. Joining the business incu-
bator jump-started Veritas Medicine and put it weeks, perhaps even months, ahead in
the startup process.38 But the deal between Veritas Medicine and CI was expensive. In
exchange for providing $834,000 in seed money and access to facilities and profes-
sional services, CI and SeaFlower Ventures got 51.22 percent ownership of Veritas
Medicine. In addition to its equity position, CI charged Veritas Medicine about $19,000
a month for the infrastructure and professional services supplied during incubation.39
Was the expensive jump-start worth it? Perhaps so. Today, the award-winning
Veritas Medicine is a leading recruiter for participants in the pharmaceutical indus-
try’s clinical trials; it has more than 20 employees, and more than a dozen part-
time physician researchers.40 Following revelations in 2004-2005 about the very
serious side effects of some popular drugs, the pharmaceutical industry is under
pressure to conduct broader and more comprehensive clinical trials. Veritas Medi-
cine is poised to exploit that need by providing the pre-qualified participants that these
more extensive clinical trials will require (Figure 4-14).41

“The Internet is the most competitive marketplace in history, and we needed a leg up in
terms of resources. We knew we had competition, so for us speed was more important
than money. On day one, we walked into prime office space in an area with a 0 percent
occupancy rate. On day two, our T-1 line was installed. On day three, the computer net-
work was set up. Phones and support personnel began arriving on day four. By the end of
nine months, we had a staff of 70 and were hitting our stride while our main competi-
tor was still working out of his apartment.”
Robert Adelman , co-founder of Veritas Medicine and principal of OrbiMed Advisors
For many entrepreneurs, starting a new e-business under the wing of a non-profit or
commercial business incubator may be most appealing because it offers a “one-stop solu-
tion” to many startup problems. But before making a decision to incubate your e-business
startup, you should consider the following questions:42, 43
●
Who are the business incubator’s principals and staff? What entrepreneurial
experience do they have? What do they do to stay up-to-date with economic
issues and trends in business incubation?
●
What is the business incubator’s track record? Find out how long the incuba-
tion program has been operating. Check out the organization’s formerly incu-
bated companies to see how well they are doing; ask the principals about their
incubation experience.
FIGURE 4-14

Getting Your E-Business Off the Ground
131

●
What specifically will the business incubator do to help your e-business? The
startup services provided by business incubators vary. You should know up
front which services are provided by the business incubator and which ser-
vices you must provide on your own.
●
How easy will it be to leave the incubator program? Find out how long, on aver-
age, former clients stayed in the incubator.
●
In addition to services, does the business incubator offer seed money, or are
there venture capital funds linked to the incubator? It might be worth join-
ing the incubator simply to get access to seed money or first-round venture
capital financing.
●
How much will it cost you in cash and equity to participate? Remember that
the value from a commercial incubator’s services must warrant giving up a large
equity position in your e-business. In making this decision, you should deter-
mine whether it makes financial sense for your e-business to pay for the
incubator’s services (if services are part of the deal) as well as give up a large
equity position.
After a careful review of the advantages and disadvantages of incubation, you can decide
if joining a business incubator is the right thing for your startup e-business. One alterna-
tive to participating in a business incubation program is self-incubation.
Self-Incubation
For entrepreneurs, one of the primary advantages of participating in a business incubator
is the ability to share ideas and discuss startup problems with other entrepreneurs whose
companies are in the incubator’s portfolio. Another way to enjoy the advantages of commu-
nicating with other entrepreneurs of startups is through self-incubation—that is, by par-
ticipating in a members-only group that focuses on entrepreneurs. The Portland, Oregon
group Starve Ups is an example of such a group.
Starve Ups was started in 2000 by two young entrepreneurs who, in the course of
attending a number of meetings and lectures on entrepreneurial topics, found that talking
with their peers in the parking lot afterward was the most important part of the
experience.44 Membership in Starve Ups is composed of no more than 18 companies whose
founders meet on a regular basis to discuss issues related to running their businesses. At
these meetings, no topic—from pricing to profit margins—is off limits. But for Starve Ups
members, it isn’t just the conversation that’s helpful. Members also share practical exper-
tise and access to contacts, sell or barter products and services among themselves, and even
borrow equipment from other members when necessary.45
To avoid becoming just another business networking organization, Starve Ups keeps
its membership roster lean, with a maximum of 18 companies, and is very selective about
admitting new members. Of the more than 90 companies that have applied for member-
ship since its founding, most have been turned away for various reasons. For example, mem-
bership in Starve Ups is open to only those companies that offer their customers a distinct
product in addition to customer support services. Has membership in Starve Ups been
beneficial to its companies? It seems so. As of this writing, all seven founding companies
of Starve Ups are not only still in business, they have become profitable.46

with people you trust and literally lean on, and get valuable feedback.”

Although competing in a marketplace full of well-funded rivals, Emoonlighter had, as it
turned out, one very big advantage—Inderpal Guglani and his “conservative, tight purse
strings, no-nonsense approach” to doing business. After operating on a shoestring
budget for the first three years, Emoonlighter managed to garner $400,000 in funding from
the angel investors at Fairview Funds LP in August 2000.
With the additional funding and the ever-frugal Guglani at the helm, Emoonlighter
concentrated on becoming profitable fast—and its plan worked. Guglani’s tight rein on
expenses and focus on profitability helped Emoonlighter stay afloat during the eco-
nomic turndown and dot-com bust of 2000-2001. By November, 2001, many of Emoon-
lighter’s marketplace rivals were struggling financially, looking for more funding,
scrambling to change direction, or going out of business. But Emoonlighter had grown to
five employees and—by holding down costs and generating a steady stream of fee
revenues—was making a profit.47, 48, 49
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in 2001 almost 10 million U.S. workers
described themselves as being self-employed. Many of these were professionals who had
been newly laid-off as a result of the unpleasant side effects of the economic downturn
and dot-com bust, and had subsequently turned to self-employment to find work.50 By
managing its resources carefully, Emoonlighter survived this difficult economic period
and was then poised to exploit this pool of newly available self-employed professionals.
By this time Guglani had become concerned that the name “Emoonlighter” was a bit
too unprofessional for the types of self-employed professionals his employer clients
needed. A name change was in order. In an interesting twist of fate, one of Guglani’s major
marketplace rivals, Guru.com, had blown through its $63 million in VC funding without
becoming successful, and its assets were for sale. In late 2003, using a bank line of credit for
financing, Emoonlighter acquired some of Guru.com’s assets, including its URL, name,
and client base, after which point Emoonlighter became the new Guru.com (Figure 4-15).51
Today, Guru.com boasts a database of more than 400,000 self-employed professionals,
30,000 employer clients, and 40,000 employer-posted projects. And Guglani runs it all with
fewer than 10 employees!52

Chapter Summary
●
In addition to sweat equity, an entrepreneur starting a new e-business should expect to
invest personal funds in the e-business by drawing on savings, mortgaging assets, or
taking out a loan.
●
An entrepreneur’s network of friends and family can be an important source of seed
money for a startup e-business.
●
An angel investor is a wealthy individual who enjoys investing in startup businesses and
is not afraid of taking some risk.
●
Venture capital firms can raise hundreds of millions of dollars to fund new businesses,
but in return they usually expect an equity percentage, a seat on the board of direc-
tors, and some management control over the businesses in which they invest.
●
The first meeting with potential investors is really a sales meeting in which the entrepre-
neur’s objective is to excite interest in the e-business idea. For investor meetings, an
entrepreneur should be on time, be prepared, and keep it brief.
●
A pitch document is a short marketing document that highlights the key facets of an
e-business idea.
●
Before meeting with potential investors, entrepreneurs should practice their presenta-
tion and try to anticipate the questions they might be asked.
●
To succeed in getting funding for their startup e-businesses, entrepreneurs must learn
from each presentation they make, and use the resulting feedback to refine their pitch
document and verbal presentation for future meetings.
●
Business incubators are non-profit organizations (often sponsored by the government
or a university) or private companies that nurture startup businesses.
●
Commercial business incubators can provide a startup company with a wide range of ser-
vices, but in exchange may demand a large stake, sometimes 60 percent or more, in the
startup’s equity.
●
To enjoy the benefits of incubation without relinquishing equity, some entrepreneurs pre-
fer self-incubation, which involves participating in small groups that are composed of fel-
low entrepreneurs and that foster meaningful exchanges of information and resources
among peers.

Checklist
Pitching Your E-Business:
Be sure that your pitch or marketing document is short and to the point. It should highlight
a need in the marketplace, describe how your e-business idea will fill that need, forecast how
profitable the e-business could be, list any important partnerships you’ve cultivated, out-
line all the critical risks you’ve anticipated, and explain why you and your team can over-
come those risks to turn this idea into a successful business. If you are making a slide
show presentation, keep it less than 15 slides.
Be prepared to pitch your e-business idea under different circumstances: with your pitch
document handout, using a slide presentation, or by making a quick three-minute
elevator pitch.
Do your homework and be ready to answer questions about the e-business. For example,
when asked, you should be able to describe the benefits your e-business provides to poten-
tial customers, the size of its target market, how fast the target market is growing, and the
basis for the e-business model.
Try to anticipate all the questions that a potential investor might pose, but if you are asked
a question that you don’t know the answer to, resist the urge to “wing it” with an impro-
vised answer. Instead, simply state that you need to do more research and move on.
When pitching your e-business idea, be enthusiastic and demonstrate your commitment by
relating any personal investment (time, effort, money) you have made in the e-business.
Be able to describe how the management team’s experience positions the e-business for
success.
Practice! Practice! Practice! Don’t forget that pitching your e-business idea to others will help
you refine it.
Bring everything you need with you to the pitch meeting, including printed copies of elec-
tronic presentations, an extra copy of the electronic presentation file on portable media, and
your own computer and projector if you plan to use them. Be ready to be able to deliver your
pitch if your equipment fails to operate properly or if your electronic media is unusable.
Be prepared to pitch your e-business idea to potential investors a number of times. Listen
to their feedback and use it to refine your presentation for future meetings.

Case Projects
1.
Suppose you and three classmates have just graduated from college and have a great idea
for a new e-business. Write a brief description of a possible e-business idea that follows the
e-business model of your choice. Next, using online search tools or other relevant
resources, investigate non-profit and commercial business incubators in your area.Then join
your three classmates in a roundtable discussion of the pros and cons of incubating your
e-business with one of the business incubators. Make a decision for or against joining the
business incubator, and list the reasons for your choice.
2.
You are considering starting a new e-business. Write a description of the e-business idea
using the e-business model of your choice. Then create an outline of the steps necessary
to develop equity in the startup, get seed money, and solicit first-round funding. Using
online search tools or other relevant resources, identify appropriate funding sources in your
area for each stage of funding.
3.
You and three classmates have developed a new wireless technology that will make it easy
for C2C e-businesses to make transactions over wireless devices, and the three of you want
to start a new e-business to market this technology. When each of you discuss your
e-business idea with your respective families, you discover that you all have family mem-
bers who are willing to lend you money to get started—in fact the father of one of your
classmates is so enthusiastic about the idea that he has offered to cash out his retirement
plan. Working with your classmates, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of accept-
ing your family members’ offers, and then make a decision about whether you should accept
these offers. Write a brief explanation justifying your group’s decision.
Team Project
You and three classmates have just developed new software that enables B2B exchanges to pro-
cess buy and sell transactions much faster than they can with the tools they currently use. You
and your classmates want to create a new e-business to sell this software to B2B exchanges, but
you need seed money to get started. A professional associate of one of your parents has secured
a third-party introduction to a group of angel investors, and you are meeting with the investors
next week to pitch your e-business idea. Now you and your team must prepare for the meeting.
Create a one-page pitch document and, using Microsoft PowerPoint or another presenta-
tion tool, develop a five- to ten-slide presentation that highlights the selling points of your
e-business idea. (Aside from the facts explicitly stated above, you are free to elaborate on your
e-business idea and make any useful assumptions.) Draw up a list of questions that you antici-
pate your potential investors might ask, and prepare short answers for these questions. Don’t
forget that you will probably be asked to explain how your new software works, what the current
trends are in the B2B exchange marketplace, and how well your team can successfully man-
age the new e-business.
Using your pitch document and your slide show, pitch your e-business idea to a group of angel
investors that consists, in this case, of your classmates and instructor.Your team will have 45 min-
utes to an hour to make your presentation and to answer any questions about your e-business
idea that are posed by your potential investors.

In late 1998, two young men—Peter Thiel, a hedge fund manager and attorney, and Max
Levchin, an engineer—had an idea for an e-business: developing and providing security
software for personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld devices. After spending
a few months building this e-business, which they named FieldLink, Inc., Thiel and Levchin
abandoned the security software idea when they realized that there was a greater con-
sumer need that was being neglected by the marketplace—the need to quickly and easily
send money from person to person. Thiel and Levchin believed that consumers would find
this ability to transfer money useful for a variety of daily transactions, ranging from split-
ting dinner checks to paying for online auction purchases. They also believed that the
Internet was the perfect medium for these kinds of person-to-person payments. By the sum-
mer of 1999, FieldLink, Inc. had become Confinity, and Thiel and Levchin’s focus had
changed from building an e-business that developed security software to one that devel-
oped “money-beaming” software for handheld devices.1
continued

Like Thiel’s and Levchin’s original e-business idea, the Confinity e-business idea called
for the company to focus on the wireless marketplace. PDA and cell phone users who
wished to be able to transfer or exchange money could open a free account with Confin-
ity that would be funded with their respective credit cards. Using their handheld device’s
infrared (IR) port to connect with other handheld devices, customers would then be able
to “beam” money from their accounts to another person’s Confinity account. Confini-
ty’s plan was to make its money “on the float”—that is, by earning interest on the money
sitting in customer accounts.2
As suggested in earlier chapters, the late 1990s were the “rock and roll” days of the
dot.com boom, and so Confinity had little trouble finding investors, including Nokia Ven-
tures (the venture capital arm of the mobile communications giant Nokia) and Deut-
sche Bank. In July 1999, Confinity demonstrated its money-beaming software at a press
party by having Nokia Ventures “beam” $3 million in startup funds to Confinity through
Thiel’s PDA.3 With the popularity of handheld devices growing both in the U.S. and around
the world, Confinity was counting on the network effect and viral marketing to make its
person-to-person payment system a success. But the dot.com bust was right around the
corner. What did the future have in store for Thiel, Levchin, and Confinity?

In Chapters 3 and 4 you learned about planning for your new e-business and finding ways
to fund its startup. The next step in the entrepreneurial process is to begin operating
your e-business. Gearing up for operations requires considering a number of issues; for
example, what are some of the legal issues that might be involved with starting and operat-
ing your e-business? When is it time to move into commercial office space? What do you
need to know about hiring employees? How will your customers pay for the products and
services they buy? What technologies are appropriate for your e-business, and who pro-
vides them? How will you coordinate your Web site operations with accounting, prod-
uct distribution, and other “back office” operations? Must you maintain all the skills,
technologies, and operational systems your e-business needs in-house, or can you save
money by outsourcing some of these e-business needs? Finding good answers to these
operational questions may be critical to the success of your new e-business. In Chapter 6,
you will examine another important operational issue: how to market your e-business’s
products and services. But first, this chapter will introduce you to some of the other diverse
operational challenges that your startup e-business is likely to face, and will suggest ways
to deal with those challenges.

I S S U E S
Establishing an early relationship with an attorney experienced in business startups and,
if possible, with e-business startups, is important for an e-business entrepreneur. An expe-
rienced attorney can help you develop your business plan, formalize the legal structure of
your business, and establish a company valuation for investors. An established attorney
may also be able to provide leads to angel investors and venture capitalists. In addition to
Chapter 5
146

providing such services, your attorney should participate in any negotiations with inves-
tors and review all legal documents related to securing investments, such as term sheets.
You should obtain legal assistance not only for startup business planning and investor
activities, but also for many ongoing business activities. As with a brick-and-mortar busi-
ness, an e-business is subject to state and federal laws and regulations. The legal issues asso-
ciated with an e-business can be more complicated, however, because business activities
on the Web often move across traditional jurisdictional boundaries, and because the growth
in Web-based business is itself leading to changes in laws that are likely to affect your
e-business.
When dealing with issues such as copyrights, trademarks, employee benefits and com-
pensation, retirement plans, and personnel policies, you should seek advice from your
attorney. Understanding and negotiating marketplace issues such as taxation, content liabil-
ity, and information privacy may also require the advice of an experienced attorney.
Copyrights and Trademarks
A copyright is a form of legal protection for original work, including writing, drama, music,
art, and other intellectual property—whether the work is published or unpublished. A
copyright takes effect the moment the work is created. Virtually everything on the Web is
protected by copyright law, whether the copyright statement is visible or not. As a mat-
ter of form and best practice, however, an e-business’s Web site should contain a copy-
right notice. While the fair use concept built into copyright law allows for the limited use
of copyrighted material under certain circumstances, you should not include any text,
graphics, audio, or other material on your e-business Web site without obtaining permis-
sion from the copyright holder.4, 5 Both the U.S. Copyright Office Web site (Figure 5-1) and
the private Copyright Web site provide good information on copyright issues.
FIGURE 5-1
U.S. Copyright Office

A trademark is a distinctive symbol, word, or phrase that a business uses to identify
its products and to distinguish them from those of other businesses. Similarly, a busi-
ness’s services are distinguished from those of other businesses by distinctive words,
phrases, or symbols, which are referred to as service marks. Trademarks and service marks
make it easier for a consumer to identify the source of a product. For example, the word
“Nike” and the Nike “swoosh” symbol identify shoes and other products manufactured by
Nike. Using a trademark to heighten consumer awareness of a product or service is called
branding. You learn more about branding in Chapter 6.
When you develop a trademark or service mark for your e-business, you should take
steps to register it with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The U.S. Patent and Trade-
mark Office (Figure 5-2) and the International Trademark Association Web sites are good
sources of information about trademark issues.
Content Liability and Customer Information Privacy
An e-business may be exposed to potential liabilities for defamation, libel, copyright
infringement, obscenity, indecency, and other issues on the basis of the content and hyper-
links on its Web site. To protect against potential lawsuits, you should have your attor-
ney draft an appropriately worded disclaimer of liability and post this disclaimer on your
e-business’s Web site so that it is easily accessible to viewers.
One of the challenges for any e-business is the collection and analysis of customer
information. Many potential customers may be hesitant to purchase products or services
online or to provide valid information for fear that the information will be misused or sold
to others. Your e-business should have a clear policy on how it handles and secures the infor-
mation it collects at its Web site. Additionally, your e-business should take steps to make
customers aware of its information privacy policies before it collects the information,
FIGURE 5-2
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
Chapter 5
148

including informing customers how this information will be secured from possible unautho-
rized or fraudulent use.
Q U O T E S

“It’s more about managing information in a way that respects the customer’s wishes as to
how information is provided and used, while at the same time ensuring that the organi-
zation leverages the value of that information and returns that value to the customer. This
is a much broader approach than the purely regulatory. Ultimately, you want to build cus-
tomer trust and help improve the bottom line.”
Peter Cullen, chief privacy strategist at Microsoft Corporation
One way an e-business can build customer confidence about information privacy is to
become a TRUSTe licensee. TRUSTe is a non-profit organization that advocates disclo-
sure of information privacy policy, informed user consent, and consumer education about
information privacy issues.6 E-businesses that are licensed to display the TRUSTe online
seal, or “trustmark,” on their Web sites have agreed to make customers aware of what per-
sonal information is being gathered, with whom it will be shared, and how it will be used.
These companies have also agreed to provide customers with options that allow them to
control the way their information is disseminated. TRUSTe (Figure 5-3) licensees include
e-businesses such as Yesmail, Classmates.com, and eBay.

Taxation
The taxation of business conducted on the Web is one of the toughest issues facing
government. Sales taxes are the largest single source of revenue for many state and local
governments. These governments fear that increased sales on the Web (as opposed to
in-state brick-and-mortar businesses) will continue to cause a serious decline in their sales
tax revenues—a decline that must be made up from other sources, such as increased taxes
on property and income. As of this writing, e-businesses are subject to the same exist-
ing sales taxes, property taxes, and corporate income taxes as the brick-and-mortar busi-
nesses in their state, but they are not required to collect sales taxes from customers unless
the e-business has a physical presence in the customer’s state. Instead, buyers are respon-
sible for paying their state’s applicable sales taxes, although few, if any, do so. Although the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, originally passed by Congress in 1998 and extended to 2006,
has placed a moratorium on new Internet taxes, there are several ongoing initiatives by state
and local government officials to find an efficient method of collecting sales taxes on Web-
based purchases.7
It is important that your e-business’s management team stay informed about changes
in tax law. You should certainly seek the advice of an experienced tax accountant when
dealing with tax issues for your e-business. It also bears repeating that you should estab-
lish a relationship with an experienced attorney who can help you sort through the legal
and tax issues your e-business faces.
In addition to legal issues, another operational challenge your e-business will prob-
ably need to resolve is the issue of physical office space. If, like most startups, your
e-business occupies temporary office space, chances are you will eventually outgrow this
space. When that happens, it’s time to look into suitable commercial office space.
C O M M E R C I A L
O F F I C E
S P A C E
Many startup e-businesses begin life at the entrepreneur’s kitchen table and then quickly
expand to a spare room that serves as temporary office space. An arrangement like this
might work sufficiently for some time, but when you reach the point at which your employ-
ees have to share desks (and sometimes chairs), when a growing stacks of manila folders
serves as your “file cabinet,” and when extension cords and surge protectors fill every elec-
trical outlet in the room, it’s time to consider commercial office space. Perhaps even more
important than these internal needs are considerations related to your e-business’s inter-
actions with the public—in other words, you should consider relocating to commercial
office space when your e-business needs appropriate meeting spaces for clients and busi-
ness associates.
T I P
Another way to build customer confidence in your Web site and e-business operations is to take advan-
tage of the advisory and assurance programs offered by a certified public accountant (CPA) under the aus-
pices of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The AICPA WebTrust and
SysTrust programs can help ensure that your Web site and computer operations meet security, privacy, con-
fidentiality, and availability standards. For more information on these programs, check out the AICPA
Web site.
Chapter 5

If your e-business happened to have a need for large facilities, such as a call center or
product distribution center, you should have already evaluated those needs and outlined
them in your business plan. In the case of many e-business startups, however, the details
about commercial office space needs may not be a significant consideration in the origi-
nal business planning process. If this is true for you, it is important that you develop a
detailed facilities plan before you begin searching for commercial office space. Effec-
tively planning your search for commercial office space will help you avoid common pit-
falls such as moving to a poor business location, leasing space that doesn’t easily allow
for your business’s future growth, or occupying facilities that turn out to be inappropriate
for clients, business associates, and employees. Asking and answering the following ques-
tions will help you create a facilities plan and select appropriate office space:
●
How much space does your e-business need now, and how much will it need
in the near future?
●
How will you divide the space into offices or work areas?
●
What are your electrical wiring requirements?
●
What telecommunications services and office equipment does your
e-business need?
●
Will there be a need for additional space for break rooms, reception areas, and
conference rooms?
●
Will the physical location of the facilities offer access to adequate parking and
to nearby businesses that employees could patronize, such as restaurants and
childcare centers?
●
What major roads and public transportation are nearby?
●
Is there a nearby pool of qualified prospective employees?
●
What type of security requirements does your e-business have?
●
What property damage and liability insurance requirements does your
e-business have?
A facilities plan should also include a budget for the office space facilities plus any other
costs associated with the facilities, such as utilities, security, insurance, and parking fees.
Any estimated costs that may be incurred during the leasing process, such as legal fees,
real estate brokerage fees, and general contractor fees (if modifications to commercial space
are necessary), should also be part of your facilities plan budget.
After developing your facilities plan, you may choose to look for opportunities to save
money on office space. One way to do that is to look for office space with a non-profit busi-
ness incubator. Another way is to share office space with other businesses, so that the costs
of common areas such as reception areas, conference rooms, and break rooms can be split
among the businesses. Subletting space from an existing business is yet another good way
to save money. Alternatively, you may, as some startup e-businesses do, find ways to trade
services with strategic business partners in exchange for office space. Lastly, an addi-
tional way to downsize your office space requirements is to consider providing options that
allow some of your employees to telecommute.8
It is a good idea to work with an experienced and reliable commercial real estate bro-
ker who can help you locate commercial office space and help negotiate the lease on the
selected space. It is also a good idea for your attorney to review all lease agreements.
Operating Your E-Business

One of the major reasons your startup businesses might find it necessary to move from
a temporary home office into commercial space is to accommodate the additional employ-
ees that your e-business needs to grow.
H I R I N G
E M P L O Y E E S
The key to success for any business is its people. In the case of startup e-businesses, finding
key people—that is, employees who are critical to your e-business operations—can be
difficult. Knowing whom to hire first may be confusing, as the employee needs of indi-
vidual e-business startups can vary. Generally speaking, however, your first key hire may
need to be the chief information or technology officer. Even if you plan to outsource most
of your e-business’s technology needs, it is critical for your management team to include
someone who understands e-business technologies and who can help design and moni-
tor the development of your e-business’s systems and their operations. The next type of hir-
ing you might do involves building your e-business’s technology staff with—depending on
your e-business’s specific needs—employees who can serve as software engineers, Web
developers, product managers, and network administrators.9
Because maintaining an accurate picture of your e-business startup’s financial posi-
tion and burn rate (the rate at which your e-business is using its cash reserves) is criti-
cal, your next hire is likely to be a chief financial officer. Your chief financial officer is
responsible for all your e-business’s accounting and financial activities and may also play
a key role in securing additional financing. In addition to a chief financial officer, you should
consider hiring an experienced marketing professional to begin working on business
development. After you secure another round of financing, it may be time for your
e-business to concentrate on hiring employees for the marketing and customer support
teams. Lastly, you should remember that as the number of employees grows, you will prob-
ably need to hire someone to handle the e-business’s human resources functions.10

“What characteristics do I look for when hiring somebody? That’s one of the questions I
ask when interviewing. I want to know what kind of people they would hire.”
Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com
Leads on finding qualified and talented employees can come from many sources. Inves-
tors, boards of advisors or directors, family, friends, strategic business partners, and current
employees are all great sources for new employee leads. When hiring senior managers or tech-
nology workers, you may consider using a professional recruiting firm. Professional recruit-
ers, also known as headhunters, have access to experienced, talented people who are not
actively looking for employment but might consider moving to a new e-business if they
perceive it to be an exciting opportunity. To add credibility to your startup e-business and
satisfy investors’ requirements for experienced management, you may need to hire an experi-
enced chief executive officer or other senior management up front. In addition to soliciting
leads from advisors, you may turn to one of several well-known global professional recruiters,
such as Heidrick & Struggles, Korn/Ferry International, and Spencer Stuart, which focus on

Springing into Action
By the early years of the twenty-first century, Dan Isaacs and Adam Moore had been
co-workers in Austin, Texas for nearly a decade—first as marketing managers at Dell
Computers (now Dell, Inc.), then as partners at the T3 (The Think Tank) advertis-
ing agency, where they handled client advertising that generated millions in revenues.
During these years of working together, Isaacs and Moore had often thought about
starting an e-business.Their e-business idea? An interactive marketing firm that would
provide their clients a menu of services such as strategic planning, consulting, finan-
cial modeling, marketing planning, advertising, and Web site development.12
Blessed with $150,000 in seed money and years of cumulative business experience
in marketing, client management, and small business Web site development, Isaacs
and Moore finally decided to exploit these advantages and try to create a thriving new
business.
On March 1, 2004, Isaacs and Moore got to work on a business plan that included
a very tight budget.They knew that a large percentage of small businesses fail within
the first two years of operation, and with this in mind, they deferred their own sala-
ries until the end of their company’s first fiscal year so they would be able to hold down
costs. Armed with seed money, experience, an ambitious but pragmatic business
plan, and a fierce determination to succeed, Isaacs and Moore launched their inter-
active marketing firm, named Springbox, just two weeks later.

FIGURE 5-6

As part of their next step, Isaacs and Moore began tapping into the deep pool
of contacts they had accumulated over the years and succeeded in picking up cli-
ents like Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France champion, and Advanced Micro
Devices, a microprocessor manufacturer. As a result of their hard work, Springbox, the
little advertising shop located in the heart of downtown Austin, began to turn a profit
in its fourth month of operation.
Once Springbox got off the ground, Isaacs and Moore focused on finding and
retaining the best creative staff available in order to cultivate the firm’s growing stable
of clients—and fortunately, the two principals had the confidence to hire people
whose skills equaled or surpassed their own. To keep new talent invested in the com-
pany, Isaacs and Moore instituted performance-driven incentives like profit-sharing
and bonuses. They also made a conscious effort to keep the work environment con-
ducive to creativity by making it fun and energetic. So far, their hiring strategy has
worked well. With its talented team of employees, Springbox is on pace to exceed its
second-year financial targets in 2005 and is expected to double its staff in 2006.

“Finding great people is another challenge. Great people require financial reward, job sta-
bility, growth opportunity, and a great work environment. It can also be difficult convinc-
ing candidates that your new startup can provide them with those benefits.”
Dan Isaacs, co-founder of Springbox
After you’ve identified your e-business’s personnel needs, you should begin the hiring pro-
cess by researching the salary and benefit expectations of prospective employees in your
region. The Web is a good place to begin this research. Various government organizations, non-
profit groups, and business magazines often post free salary survey information at their Web
sites. The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Salary.com are good
sources of information on compensation and benefits. Figures 5-7 and 5-8 illustrate Web sites
that provide information on compensation and benefits.
When it comes to attracting employees for key positions, a startup e-business often
must not only offer the prospective candidates competitive salary and benefits, but also
some ownership equity in the e-business. But monetary and equity compensation alone
may not be enough to attract and keep talented employees. An attractive corporate cul-
ture that promotes and rewards creativity and personal growth, along with a pleasant work
environment, may be just as important in attracting key employees.
After hiring your first round of key employees, you should turn to the important chal-
lenge of deciding how your customers will pay for your products and services. Nothing is
more critical to your bottom line than determining what electronic payment methods your
customers can use.

M E T H O D S
You should base the selection of appropriate electronic payment methods on the kinds of
products and services your e-business will offer and the type of customers who will buy
those products and services. For example, a B2C e-business selling products to adults will
likely accept credit, debit, or charge cards and may accept electronic checks. However, a
B2C e-business that targets teenagers and young adults should remember that many poten-
tial customers in this demographic do not have access to credit, debit, or charge cards;
therefore, stored value cards or electronic cash in the form of micropayments might be the
best payment approach. In contrast, a C2C e-business might find it more efficient and cost-
effective to use a person-to-person (P2P) electronic payment method. A B2B e-business
may use a combination of electronic payment methods, such as credit cards, electronic
checks, or electronic funds transfer (EFT), in addition to traditional paper checks. To help
you make a selection that is appropriate for your e-business, the upcoming sections pro-
vide details on a variety of common electronic payment methods.
Credit, Debit, and Charge Card Payments
To pay for online purchases, consumers most commonly expect to use one of three types
of payment cards—bank-issued credit cards, debit cards, or charge cards. While similar in
nature, these three payment cards have important distinctions, which, as you will see, can
have different consequences in terms of transaction liability. A credit card allows a con-
sumer to pay for items using a revolving line of credit. A debit card, also called a check card,
enables a consumer to pay for items with a debit directly from the consumer’s checking
account. A charge card is a payment card that requires a consumer to pay the balance in
full each month.
Most consumers prefer to pay for their online purchases by credit or charge card in part
because these payment cards offer limited liability for any unauthorized purchases that are
made when the card number is stolen. The federal Truth in Lending Act limits liability
for unauthorized credit and charge card charges to $50, and many card issuers waive all
liability for unauthorized charges. But liability for unauthorized debit card withdrawals is
set by provisions of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and is based on how soon a con-
sumer notifies his or her financial institution that the card has been used unlawfully. Liabil-
ity for unauthorized withdrawals varies from $50 (if notification occurs within two
business days), to $500 (notification within 60 days), to unlimited losses (notification after
60 days).13
In order to accept payment cards, your e-business must have a merchant account, pay-
ment processing software, and, for real-time processing, a link to a secure payment
gateway. Additionally, you must have procedures in place to protect your customers and
your e-business from fraud.
Merchant Accounts and Payment Gateways
A merchant account is an account at a financial institution, such as a merchant bank, into
which payment card receipts are deposited. A payment gateway is a secure online ser-
vice that submits payment card transactions to the merchant bank’s card processing net-

transaction is approved or declined.14 The processing of a payment card transaction at an
e-business Web site typically involves the following steps:
●
Step 1: The customer enters and submits payment information at the
e-business’s Web site.
●
Step 2: The e-business transmits the payment information to the payment
gateway.
●
Step 3: The payment gateway connects to the merchant bank’s card process-
ing network to route the transaction to the card issuer.
●
Step 4: The card issuer approves or declines the payment transaction, sends
back a notification, and, if the transaction is approved, transfers funds to the
e-business’s merchant account.
●
Step 5: The payment gateway notifies the e-business and the customer of the
results of the transaction.
Remarkably, this payment card transaction process, illustrated in Figure 5-9, takes just a
few seconds. Examples of secure payment gateway service providers include Authorize.Net,
CyberSource, ICVERIFY, and VeriSign.
You can apply for a merchant account for your e-business either directly at a finan-
cial institution or through a merchant account provider. A merchant account provider
partners with financial institutions and payment gateway services, and can provide the
FIGURE 5-9

entire payment card processing package: a merchant account, payment processing soft-
ware and equipment, and a connection to a payment gateway. You apply for a merchant
account much in the same way you would apply for a personal credit card account, by
supplying requested financial information. The kinds of information requested by a finan-
cial institution or merchant account provider may vary but will likely include:15
●
your credit history and that of your e-business
●
how long your e-business has been in operation
●
the kind of products and services offered
●
payment cards to be accepted
●
the anticipated average size of each transaction
●
the anticipated monthly volume of transactions
In establishing its fees for a given business merchant account, the financial institu-
tion or merchant account provider assesses the risk level of the business, which depends on
the business owner’s credit worthiness and a number of other factors. Several “high-
risk” factors can also influence the fees charged for a business merchant account. For
example, businesses involved in telemarketing, catalog sales, and online sales generally
pay higher fees for a merchant account than brick-and-mortar businesses. These types of
businesses involve a greater risk of payment card fraud because the cardholder is not
present at the point-of-sale. This is called the cardholder not present risk factor.
Another factor is the chargeback risk. A chargeback occurs when a consumer refuses
to pay a charge on his or her credit card account for a variety of reasons, including prod-
uct returns, billing errors, and fraudulent charges. Financial institutions and merchant
account providers maintain chargeback risk statistics for specific types of businesses. If an
e-business falls into the “high-risk” category by offering online gambling or other non-
traditional (namely, pornographic) products or services, it will likely pay higher fees for its
merchant account.
Although the fees you can expect to be charged for your e-business merchant account
vary, they will generally include: a one-time setup fee, a per transaction fee, a monthly
minimum charge, a per-transaction authorization fee, a fee for a monthly transaction state-
ment, and a percentage of each transaction (called a discount rate). Table 5-1 offers
examples of the merchant account fees typically charged by a merchant bank and by vari-
ous merchant account providers. Because fees vary, it is a good idea to shop around to find
the best value before you set up your e-business merchant account.

As you determine the payment methods your e-business will accept, remember that
the security of personal and financial information is of utmost importance to your
customers. It is vital for e-businesses accepting credit, debit, or charge card payments to
provide adequate security for the card information as it is being transmitted through the
payment process. The next section outlines ways to provide this security.
Secure Transmission of Payment Card Numbers
To provide secure transaction processing, your e-business must use some type of encryp-
tion and digital authentication to protect data while it’s being transmitted to and from
your customers.
Encryption is the translation of data into a secret code, and a protocol is a standard
or agreed-upon format for electronically transmitting data. One of the earliest Internet
security protocols developed is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which provides encrypted
server-side transactions for electronic payments and other forms of secure Internet
communications. To use the SSL protocol, an e-business must contact its ISP or Web host-
ing company, which then places the Web page for the e-business’s online order form on a
secure server. The URL for the SSL-secured online order form then begins with https://
instead of just http://, indicating that the information entered in the form is transmitted
using the SSL protocol. Most browsers indicate that information is being transmitted using
encryption by displaying a warning message or some type of icon, such as a lock or key.16
Figure 5-10 illustrates the process of encrypting and decrypting credit card transaction
information. Figure 5-11 illustrates the secure transmission indicators you might see in a
Web browser.
Chapter 5
160

SSL transmissions rely on authentication using digital certificates. Authentication is
the process of verifying identity, and a digital certificate is an electronic message attach-
ment that verifies the sender’s identity. Because the SSL protocol uses digital certifi-
cates to authenticate an e-business’s identity during secure data transmission, an e-business
offering secure data transactions must have a digital certificate.17 Digital certificates are
issued by a certificate authority, a trusted third-party organization such as VeriSign, which
guarantees the identity of the sender for a fee. To get a digital certificate, an e-business’s
ISP or Web site hosting company generates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which is
then submitted to a certificate authority. The certificate authority authorizes the digital
certificate, and the ISP or Web hosting company then installs the digital certificate at the
e-business’s Web site. Figure 5-12 illustrates a digital certificate.

Corporate and Customer Identity Theft Risks
Identity theft is the number one fraud-related complaint received by the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC).19 Unfortunately, identity theft—called “the fastest-growing white-
collar crime in the U.S.”—has become so profitable that domestic and international orga-
nized crime is now involved.20 Identity theft involves stealing consumers’ names, addresses,
Social Security numbers, and credit card numbers. Corporate identity theft, which
involves stealing and misusing corporate identity information, is also becoming a growing
problem. Corporate identity theft often targets small and medium-sized businesses where
the theft of business names, logos, addresses, and Web site information might “fly under the
radar” long enough for the criminals to use the information in some type of scam.
FIGURE 5-12

T I P
An electronic wallet (also known as a digital wallet) is encryption software that stores payment infor-
mation and may reside either on the consumer’s computer as a Web browser plug-in, or on the credit card
issuer’s or e-business’s server. Instead of completing a long, complicated Web-based form during the
checkout process, a buyer can expedite this process by using the information in his or her electronic
wallet.18 Microsoft Passport and Gator eWallet are examples of electronic wallet technology.

“Identity theft has emerged as one of the dominant white collar crime problems of the 21st
Century.”
Chris Swecker, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigative Division, Federal Bureau
of Investigation
Fraudulent credit card charges cost businesses and consumers billions of dollars each
year. For example, in its sixth annual fraud report, the online payment processing com-
pany CyberSource reported that Internet fraud cost e-retailers about $2.6 billion in 2004
alone.21 To steal consumer information, criminals often use the Internet to hack into busi-
ness networks and databases. In fact, in one short period of time in early 2005, the media
reported more than 10 significant data thefts, including thefts of consumer information at
major corporations such as Lexus-Nexus, Bank of America, CardSystems Solutions, Inc.,
and Ameritrade.22 Criminals also use online “phishing” schemes, which involve sending
e-mails with links to fake versions of well-known Web sites to “fish for” and catch credit card
numbers and personal information from unsuspecting consumers.
Criminals profit from stealing credit card numbers and business or personal information
in a number of ways: by going on a shopping spree themselves, by reselling the numbers or
information to other criminals, or by setting up fake e-businesses similar to real businesses. For
example, one way criminals profit from both corporate and consumer identity theft is by tak-
ing advantage of the less stringent requirements of some merchant account providers and
opening bogus merchant accounts with stolen business name and address information. The
criminals then make charges small enough to be easily approved using consumers’ stolen credit
card numbers, and they submit these charges through the bogus merchant accounts’ pay-
ment gateway. By doing this, they can then clean out the credit card payment funds depos-
ited in the merchant accounts before anyone notices the scam.23
As noted earlier in the chapter, consumers who pay online with credit cards (the most
popular payment method) are protected against fraudulent charges. Banks that issue credit
cards generally charge back fraudulent credit card charges to the e-businesses who
accepted the cards. As an e-business entrepreneur, you must, therefore, consider all pos-
sible measures to reduce your e-business’s exposure to these chargebacks. Some of those
measures include:24
●
sending orders by national shipping companies and requiring a signature on
delivery to avoid having customers claim that the products were not received
●
getting complete billing and shipping information, including a complete
address and phone number, before shipping orders
●
accepting orders placed from ISP-based or domain-name-based e-mail
addresses only, not from free, Web-based, or e-mail forwarding addresses, so
that transactions can be traced to an actual person
●
calling the phone number on a questionable order to verify the order
●
waiting to ship items until authorization and verification are ensured, espe-
cially for orders being shipped out of the country
●
carefully checking very large orders and overnight delivery requests
Operating Your E-Business
163

●
double-checking international orders where the shipping address is outside the
U.S. but the charge, credit, or debit card is issued by a U.S. bank; for example,
double-checking an order to be shipped to central Europe paid for by a credit
card issued by a Houston, Texas bank
●
using the Address Verification System and other fraud prevention tools that
are available through your merchant account provider or the financial institu-
tion that hosts your merchant account
One tool that both consumers and e-businesses can use to protect against the risk of
credit card fraud at the point-of-sale is disposable or virtual credit card numbers. Citi’s
Virtual Account Numbers and Discover Card’s Discover Deskshop are two examples of
virtual credit card number programs. A virtual credit card number is designed such that it
can be used only at the Web site where it was first used; therefore, it has little value to a
thief because it is not re-usable. As an additional security measure, some virtual credit card
numbers have an expiration date. While intended to protect the consumer, the virtual
credit card number may also protect an e-business by minimizing the risk associated with
a theft of information from the e-business’s databases.25 A disposable credit card number
is not, however, suitable for all online transactions—such as guaranteeing airline, hotel, or
rental car reservations, or for recurring credit card charges such as automatic payment of
utility bills or automatic payments for monthly pet medications.

A Real Problem: Fake E-Businesses
In late 2004, the owner of a small software company in New York that doesn’t take
credit cards was notified that more than $10,000 in credit card charges had been
made from his business. During an investigation, it became apparent that the soft-
ware company was one of about 50 legitimate businesses—none of which accepted
credit cards—that were victims of an elaborate scam.
First, the perpetrators of the scam used the businesses’ names and similar
addresses to set up Web site addresses (URLs). Next, the scammers created dummy
Web sites. Then the scammers applied to various merchant account providers and
financial institutions, such as Global Payments, North American Bancard, First Data,
Wells Fargo, and Beacon Bank, to open new merchant accounts. They used stolen
business names and business addresses together with the fake Web sites to make the
applications appear to be from legitimate businesses. The scammers managed to
open several merchant accounts; once a merchant account was set up, the scam-
mers were able to use stolen credit card numbers already in their possession to
process charges through the merchant accounts.26 Although the exact loss figures
are still not known, it is believed that the perpetrators were able to steal several hun-
dred thousand dollars before the business owners and merchant account provid-
ers caught on to the scam.

Chapter 5
164

Investigators think the scam may have involved international organized crime
because it closely resembled the PharmacyCard.com scam of 2004, in which almost
90,000 consumers were charged a total of $10 million in fraudulent credit card
charges before the scam was stopped. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) traced
the monies from the PharmacyCard.com scam to Nicosia, Cyprus.27 What can a
small business owner do to protect his or her business from such a scam? Be aware
of the risk and search the Web on a regular basis for Web sites that might be using
your business’s name or other information.
Other Electronic Payment Methods
Although the preferred electronic payment methods among consumers today are credit,
debit, and charge cards, e-businesses can offer their customers several other electronic pay-
ment methods, such as stored value cards, electronic checks, electronic cash (micropay-
ments), and person-to-person (P2P) payments.
Stored Value Cards
Thousands of teens and children under the age of 12 would like to spend their allowances
or part-time-job incomes shopping online for clothes, music CDs, and other popular items.
Most young shoppers lack access to the credit cards accepted by e-retailers, and parents are
often reluctant to allow children to use their credit cards. Additionally, there are thou-
sands of adult consumers who do not have or want credit, debit, or charge cards. To sell
products and services to these two groups of consumers, e-businesses can accept stored
value cards.
A smart card is a small card approximately the size of a credit card that contains an
electronic memory chip. Smart cards are used for a variety of purposes, such as storing
medical records, personal identification data, and cash. A stored value card is a smart card
that stores cash. Examples of stored value cards include prepaid telephone cards, govern-
ment benefit cards used to purchase food, and gift cards. Some stored value cards, such
as single-purpose gift cards, can be used only where they were purchased. For example, a
Target store gift card can be used at Target’s brick-and-mortar stores and at the Target Web
site, but not at any other store or Web site. In contrast, multi-purpose stored value cards,
such as Visa Cash, MasterCard prepaid cards, and American Express Travelers Cheque
cards, can be used anywhere—both online and offline—that regular Visa, MasterCard, and
American Express cards are accepted. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York expects that,
by 2006, transactions involving all types of stored value cards will total more than $72
billion.28 Figures 5-13 through 5-15 illustrate card issuer Web sites where stored value cards
are described.

Electronic Checks
An electronic check, sometimes called an e-check or ACH check, is the electronic ver-
sion of a paper check. It not only contains the same information as a paper check, but is
based on the same legal framework as that of a paper check, and thus can be used in any
transaction in which a traditional paper check is used. An electronic check is, however,
much less expensive to process than a paper check. While the costs for processing a paper
check range anywhere from 75 cents to $3, it costs only a few pennies to process an elec-
tronic check.29
Like paper checks, electronic checks are processed at the point of sale. To pay for a pur-
chase at a brick-and-mortar store using an electronic check, the buyer writes out a check
and gives it to a cashier. The cashier then scans the check through a MICR (magnetic ink
character recognition) device that captures the account number, serial number, and finan-
cial institution routing number that appear on the check. The scanned data moves elec-
tronically to a check authorization service such as TeleCheck, which verifies that the check
is drawn on an open account and that the buyer does not have a record of writing “hot”
checks (checks drawn from accounts with insufficient funds). The paper check is then
voided and maintained by the seller, or it may even be returned to the buyer. After veri-
fication from an authorization service, the electronic check data then goes to the ACH
(Automated Clearing House) network, where the amount of the check is credited to the
merchant’s account and the data is forwarded to the buyer’s financial institution, where the
amount is debited from the buyer’s account.
Similarly, to use an electronic check at an online store, buyers fill out a Web-based form
at checkout, providing the merchant with their checking account number and their bank’s
routing number. This data is submitted to a check authorization agency and sent on
through the ACH system just like an electronic check presented at a brick-and-mortar store.
Figure 5-16 illustrates the electronic check process at an online store.

Electronic Cash and Micropayments
Electronic cash, sometimes called digital cash or e-cash, is a payment method that allows
buyers to pay for goods or services online by transmitting a unique electronic number (or
other identifier that carries a specific dollar value) over the Internet. There are two pri-
mary advantages of using electronic cash instead of a credit card: lower processing costs for
the seller, and no credit card authorization for the buyer. Although electronic cash is a
popular online payment method in Europe and Japan, it has not been widely accepted by
U.S. consumers, who still prefer to use credit cards to pay for their online purchases.
FIGURE 5-16

The late 1990s saw the launching of many new e-businesses, such as beenz and Flooz, that offered elec-
tronic cash consumer rewards programs or provided electronic cash for prepaid accounts targeted at chil-
dren and teens. Despite high-level promotion efforts, this type of electronic cash just never took off with
young consumers or their parents, and these companies did not survive the dot.com bust of 2000-2001.

Unfortunate Timing for a Good Idea
David Chaum is a renowned cryptographer and mathematician. He began his work
in cryptography in the 1980s as a graduate student in computer science at Berke-
ley, where he wrote his master’s thesis on an electronic mail system that was so pri-
vate it could be used for voting. After receiving a doctorate at Berkeley, Chaum went
to the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, where his inter-
est in privacy and the Internet led to his inventing a form of electronic money whose
legitimacy could be verified while its source could not be traced. Chaum named his
electronic cash “eCash,” and in 1990 he founded an e-business called DigiCash in
order to market eCash to banks.30
DigiCash’s eCash product gained widespread attention in 1994 and 1995 as
banks and other businesses began to look at the commerce opportunities the Inter-
net provided, and soon DigiCash succeeded in arranging licensing agreements with
several banks, including Deutsche Bank, Den Norske Bank, Bank Austria, Advance
Bank of Australia, and Mark Twain Bank of St. Louis.These banks hoped to offer their
customers a new service: the ability to use the funds in their bank accounts to make
purchases online without disclosing critical bank account information.
Unfortunately, however, DigiCash’s eCash product was ahead of its time. In 1995,
commercial Web browser technology was still in its infancy, and the idea of using the
Internet to purchase goods and services was so new that the term “e-business” had
not yet been invented. Also unfortunate for DigiCash was the fact that as online shop-
ping eventually began to take off, consumers turned out to be much less resistant to
the idea of providing personal credit card information over the Internet than indus-
try analysts had originally supposed.31
Lack of success with the eCash pilot programs, the complexity of the eCash sys-
tem, and internal management problems led to DigiCash filing for bankruptcy in
November 1998.32 But the idea of providing consumers with electronic cash was
still attractive to some entrepreneurs and investors. In May 1999, a group of entrepre-
neurs bought DigiCash’s software and patents and formed a company called eCash-
Technologies, Inc., known simply as eCash. But eCash was unsuccessful at
reviving Chaum’s electronic cash idea. In 2002, InfoSpace, Inc., a wireless and Inter-
net technologies company, purchased eCash Technologies’ intellectual property.
Meanwhile, Chaum, who had no involvement with eCash Technologies or InfoSpace,
Inc., continues to pursue his interest in cryptography, privacy issues, and secure
election voting.
It was once thought that micropayments, payments for purchases ranging from a few
cents to $5 in cost, would spur the growth of online shopping. Early attempts at introduc-
ing micropayment solutions involved charging consumers small amounts for access to
Web content. These attempts were not successful for a number of reasons, including a gen-
eral unwillingness by U.S. consumers to be “nickeled and dimed” for the Web content they
expected to access for free.33
But the recent success of charging consumers to download music—individual songs
downloaded for less than $1—may indicate a revival for the micropayment concept. Sev-
eral new e-businesses, such as BitPass, Peppercoin, Paystone, and Yaga, are betting that
an increasing number of online consumers will be willing to pay for all types of content,
including music, games, photos, and online publishing (e-books, comic books, and short
Operating Your E-Business

stories)—and their bets may just pay off. According to a 2004 survey by the market research
firm Ipsos-Insight, micropayment purchases in the U.S. are growing at more than 300 per-
cent a year, and an estimated 30 million U.S. consumers are somewhat likely to make a
micropayment purchase.34 TowerGroup, a financial services research and consulting com-
pany, predicts the global micropayment market will grow to more than $10 billion by
2009.35 Figures 5-17 and 5-18 show Web sites for some of the micropayment technology and
service providers in the emerging micropayment marketplace.

A Fortune in Nickels and Dimes?
Shortly after the dot.com bust of 2000-2001, Kurt Huang and his roommate at Stan-
ford, Gyuchang Jun, were dismayed to find that some of their favorite Web sites had
begun charging a monthly subscription fee for access to content that had previously
been free. Neither wanted to pay for a monthly subscription just to be able to access
a single article or report that had caught their interest. Following in the footsteps of ear-
lier Stanford graduate students such as Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who launched
Google) and David Filo and Jerry Yang (founders of Yahoo!), Huang and Jun
decided to start an e-business. Their e-business idea was to offer customers a ser-
vice that enabled them to quickly and easily pay for individual items of online
content—using micropayments—instead of signing up for a monthly subscription.36
Jun developed the micropayment software, and Huang pitched their e-business
idea to a number of venture capitalists, including Guy Kawasaki, managing direc-
tor of Garage Technology Ventures. Kawasaki liked the e-business idea and the
software; in 2002, Garage Technology Ventures provided $1.5 million in funding for
the new e-business, now named BitPass. BitPass offers consumers a prepaid account
from which they can make micropayments for online purchases. Opening a pre-
paid account with BitPass is free, and consumers can fund with it as little as $3. Once
consumers have an account, they can use their BitPass funds to pay for content at
Web sites that offer the BitPass payment service. At the BitPass Web site, consum-
ers can find a directory of Web sites that accept the BitPass micropayments. Bit-
Pass makes money by charging these Web sites a percentage of each micropayment
transaction.37

announced that it received a second round of funding in the amount of $11.75 mil-
lion from Worldview Technology Partners, Steamboat Ventures (the Walt Disney

“Three major things have changed to conspire to make this [micropayments] a big oppor-

are much more willing to use their credit card online. Another change is that advertis-
ing can no longer support all content models, which drives a willingness to charge [for
content]. Thirdly, the technology has really stabilized. Original providers required a down-

Person-to-Person Payment Systems
P2P (or person-to-person) payment systems enable a person to send money to anyone
anywhere around the world just as long as that other person has an e-mail address. Con-
sumers can pay for online purchases through their personal P2P account using a credit
card or debit card, or by directly transferring funds from their bank account. E-businesses
can use a business P2P account to accept these payments. P2P payment systems are used
extensively by buyers and sellers in the online auction marketplace. In the late 1990s,
several companies jumped on the P2P payment bandwagon; most have either gone out of
business (such as Yahoo! DirectPay) or changed their focus to online payment systems for
B2C transactions, such as Western Union MoneyZap and ProPay.com. Left standing are Bid-
Pay and the major player in the P2P payment system marketplace, PayPal, which has more
than a 60 percent share of the market.40 Figures 5-20 and 5-21 illustrate the Web sites
of e-businesses offering P2P payment systems.
Determining just how your customers will pay for your products and services is an
important step for an e-business startup. You must also understand the types of technolo-
gies that can help you operate your e-business, and become familiar with the vendors who
provide these technologies.

As an entrepreneur, you will make many technology-related decisions for your new e-business.
One of the most important of these involves determining what software you will need to
manage all of the various aspects of running your e-business, such as processing sales transac-
tions and payments, monitoring inventory, accounting, and other internal recordkeeping. You
must also decide how your e-business will connect to the Internet and whether you should
host and maintain your Web site or outsource the Web site operations. Your technology deci-
sions will be based on your e-business’s front-end and back-end systems needs.
Front-End and Back-End Systems
Front-end systems are the aspects of a business with which the business’s customers
interface and over which customers can exert some control. For your e-business, front-
end systems would be the Web site and other related processes that your customers use
to view information and purchase products and services. Back-end systems are the aspects
of a business that are not directly accessed by customers. For your e-business, back-end
systems would include the systems that handle the accounting and budgeting, manufactur-
ing, marketing, inventory management, distribution, order-tracking, and customer sup-
port processes.
FIGURE 5-21
PayPal
Chapter 5
174

Your e-business’s front-end systems will probably require much of the same data that
is already stored in its back-end systems, such as product availability and pricing. Addi-
tionally, new data being gathered by your front-end systems—for example, order and cus-
tomer information—must be made available to the back-end systems to facilitate internal
business processes such as accounting, billing, payment processing, and order fulfillment.
Integrating front-end and back-end systems not only provides an e-business with more
useful information about its own operations, but also enables the e-business to reduce its
costs by allowing common data to be shared across front-end and back-end applications.
Figure 5-22 illustrates the integration of an e-business’s front-end and back-end systems.
Many e-business operations depend on the integration of front-end and back-end
systems. For example, in order to authenticate and authorize a given credit card pay-
ment, the credit card information (front-end data) must be transferred either to a credit
card processing provider, or processed internally using credit card authorization software
(both of which are back-end business processes). Also, if a customer purchases a prod-
uct at your Web site, the order information must be routed to your warehouses for fulfill-
ment, and the product inventory records must be updated. The transaction must also be
recorded in your accounting system. If you have outside suppliers, it may be necessary to
transmit the order transaction to systems outside of the e-business, such as those of des-
ignated suppliers or shipping agents. Figure 5-23 illustrates an example of typical order
transaction processing for an e-retailer.

Entrepreneurs who are adding an e-business component to their existing brick-and-
mortar businesses have an additional challenge when making technology decisions—how
to integrate their new systems with their existing or legacy systems. Integration of new
systems with existing systems requires the following considerations.
FIGURE 5-23

●
Real-time or batch processing: Do the various systems involved require real-
time updating of data—for example, checking the inventory system before
allowing the customer to order an item? If there is no need for real-time data
exchange, or if this updating is simply not feasible, then the new system must
store the data to be updated in a queued list to be sent at a specified time. Many
e-businesses do this with their credit card authorization when their systems
are not capable of real-time authorization. They store all of the credit card
numbers to be authorized during the day, and then authorize them in a batch
at the end of the day.
●
Security: Because e-business operations usually involve several interconnect-
ing systems, each system must be secure. It is possible that the e-business will
exchange data with an outside business such as a supplier or shipping agent.
Such connections need to be secure as well, in both the old and new
systems.
●
Compatibility: Compatibility is always a consideration when integrating sys-
tems not originally designed to communicate with each other. When select-
ing software components for online transaction processing, it is important to
make sure that these software components can share data with the other
components. To facilitate the exchange of data, it may be necessary to write
special data translation programs, or to purchase specialized software, often
called middleware, for making connections between two systems.
As your e-business grows, the software technologies you need to operate and inte-
grate your front-end and back-end systems can range from simple storefront software,
which can help you create and operate a small online store, to the expensive and exten-
sive Web content management, enterprise resource planning, and customer relationship
management technologies that are used by larger or more mature e-businesses.
E-Business Software
The amount of information that your e-business must keep track of is tremendous. What’s
more, this information must be processed quickly. For example, with the swift pace of busi-
ness today, you may need to rapidly update product and pricing changes in your online
catalog, post current industry announcements, or add up-to-date syndicated news head-
lines, weblogs, and articles to your Web site in order to keep your Web site current and
competitive.
You must also ensure that the products in your customers’ shopping carts are actu-
ally in inventory. To fill customers’ orders in a timely manner, you must be able to quickly
route order and delivery information to a warehouse for order fulfillment. To retain cus-
tomers as your e-business grows, you will need to learn more about your customers’ shop-
ping habits and buying preferences. Fortunately, there are several types of management
software systems that your e-business can use to store and process its vast quantities of data,
convert that data into useful information, and then use the power of the network to make
the information quickly available to employees, vendors, and customers. Table 5-2 sum-
marizes different categories of e-business management software systems.

Storefront Software
If your e-business is an e-retailer, you will need to set up and maintain an online store. You
can create online store by licensing and installing storefront software on your server.
Storefront software creates an online store for your Web site and enables you to accept
order and payment information and then process that information. Small to medium-
sized e-retailers can choose from a number of pre-packaged online store options, called
hosted storefront software. Hosted storefront software can provide everything a small
e-retailer needs to build an online store: Web site hosting services, easy-to-use tem-
plates to build online store Web pages (such as product catalogs), and shopping cart
software. Shopping cart software manages customer purchases by temporarily storing
information about items selected for purchase and then handling the complete check-
out process, which generally includes shipping and tax calculations, credit card authoriza-
tion, and payment processing. Larger e-retailers may choose to license customizable
storefront software with more complex features, such as inventory management, and make
their own Web site hosting arrangements. Vendors that offer storefront software include
Yahoo! Small Business, GoECart and StoreFront.net. Figures 5-24 through 5-26 illustrate
the Web sites for these popular storefront software vendors.

Content Management System (CMS)
As your e-business grows, the content on your Web site is likely to become more complex.
To make your site more interesting and useful to your customers, you may choose to pro-
vide syndicated news headlines, industry updates, and other dynamic material from a
variety of sources. In order to manage complex Web site content but also make certain that
all of your Web pages maintain a professional and standardized appearance, you must be
able to control the quality, accuracy, and timing of the content that comes in from these
sources. A content management system (CMS) is a system that controls all the pro-
cesses involved in Web content development, including authoring, reviewing, editing, and
then publishing the content in a timely way.
Databases, called content repositories, are at the center of a content management
system. Content repositories contain Web page templates and style sheets that help con-
trol the appearance of all the Web pages at a site, as well as commonly used graphics
(such as logos), text documents, and syndicated content (such as news headlines). Web con-
tent can be built “on the fly” from the components stored in these content repositories. In
addition, time-sensitive content, like press releases, can be stored in content reposito-
ries and then published according to a predetermined schedule. Vendors that provide con-
tent management system technologies include OpenText Corporation, Interwoven, and
Vignette. Figures 5-27 through 5-29 illustrate the Web sites for these content manage-
ment system vendors.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
The term “enterprise” is often used in business to identify any organization that uses com-
puters and a network to interact with employees, suppliers, and customers, but it is more
often associated specifically with large businesses. Large e-businesses may use enterprise
resource planning (ERP) systems to integrate all aspects of their business operations,
including product planning, manufacturing, human resources, accounting, finance, sales,
and marketing. ERP systems had their origins in the 1960s with manufacturing compa-
nies, who began to incorporate elements such as raw material planning, purchasing, shop
floor management, and distribution into their manufacturing systems. In the early 1990s,
other enterprise activities, such as engineering, project management, accounting, finance,
and human resources, were added to ERP systems. Today, many large businesses use Web-
based interfaces to connect their ERP system components. The leading ERP systems pro-
viders for both brick-and-mortar enterprises and e-businesses are Oracle and SAP.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Getting and keeping customers is a top priority for any business. Another large enterprise
system that, like ERP, uses Internet and Web-based technologies is a customer
relationship management (CRM) system. CRM applications compile customer informa-
tion into databases and use the information to match customer needs with products and ser-
vices, to remind customers when new products or service updates are available, and to
analyze customer shopping and buying behaviors. ERP systems providers such as SAP and
Oracle also provide CRM systems technologies.
In addition to acquiring a basic understanding of the various technologies that can sup-
port your e-business, you must make decisions about which e-business operations can be
managed in-house and which can be outsourced.

The wide array of outsourced services available to your startup e-business includes
Internet access for your employees, hosting services for your Web site, software applica-
tion rental, Web development services, Web strategy consulting, data file storage and
backup, product warehousing and fulfillment services, and all conceivable combinations
of these and other services. The major advantage of outsourcing some of your e-business’s
operations is reduced costs. The major disadvantage is your lack of control over all aspects
of those outsourced operations. Table 5-3 shows examples of service providers to which you
can outsource some of your e-business’s operations.

Outsourcing Web Hosting to an ISP or Web Hosting Company
Internet service providers (ISPs), sometimes called Internet access providers (IAPs), are
the companies that provide connections to the Internet. Because they already have the
hardware, software, and Internet connection necessary to operate Web sites, many ISPs,
such as Earthlink, also offer personal and business Web hosting services. In contrast, for
Web hosting companies, such as Affinity, Hosting.com, and Rackspace Managed Host-
ing, managing and maintaining outsourced commercial Web site operations at their data
centers is the primary focus. Outsourcing your e-business’s Web site operations to one
Operating Your E-Business
183

of these Web hosting service providers has several advantages over hosting your own site.
In particular, a hosting service provider:
●
has a staff available 24 hours a day that have the technical knowledge neces-
sary to keep the servers and network connections running
●
can provide a level of redundancy (multiple high-speed Internet connections,
backup power from generators, and backup servers) that an e-business may
not be able to provide for itself
Outsourcing Web site operations can be a particularly cost-effective choice for a small
e-business. Instead of assuming all the costs related to Web site hardware, software, and
operations by itself, an individual e-business ends up sharing these costs with the other
e-businesses whose sites are also outsourced to the service provider. When evaluating Web
hosting service providers, you should look for those providers that have scalable servers,
high-speed connections, 24/7 technical support, server and network redundancy, secure
server facilities, and tested disaster-recovery plans.41
Many hosting service providers offer different levels of service at different prices, so you
must determine the level of service your e-business requires. Your management team
should consider questions such as: How much server storage space and bandwidth does your
e-business need? Can your e-business share a server with other e-businesses, or do you
need a server that is dedicated to your e-business’s operations? Do you have the in-house
expertise to manage your Web site remotely, or do you need a managed hosting arrange-
ment where the hosting provider’s staff handles all routine server management? Determin-
ing the answers to these questions will help you decide the level of hosting service that
would best serve your e-business.42
An e-business that prefers to control its server operations can provide its own servers
and software and simply co-locate its servers at the hosting service providers’ facilities.
Co-locating servers involves renting space and Internet connectivity from a hosting ser-
vice provider for an e-business’s own servers. Co-locating its servers allows an e-business
to maintain control over its servers while taking advantage of the high-speed transmis-
sions and secure data center facilities offered by the service provider.
In addition to outsourcing Web site operations, you may consider outsourcing your
e-business’s software applications to an application service provider.
Outsourcing Web-Based Software Applications
Application service providers (ASPs) use private networks or the Internet to deliver and
manage software applications and other computer services from remote data centers. ASPs
offer a diverse menu of services. For example, ASPs typically provide IT infrastructure,
software licenses, application support, database administration, system administration,
software upgrades, and technical-problem resolution for their clients. Client companies
access their software applications remotely over the Internet, and may pay either a
monthly fee for these services or a per-transaction fee. Examples of ASP-provided applica-
tions that your employees could access over the Internet are time and billing, calendar-
ing, data backup, ERP, and CRM applications. One leading ASP is USInternetworking, which
partners with major companies such as Oracle PeopleSoft (human resources and finan-
cial applications), Microsoft (e-business, exchange hosting, and messaging applications),
Chapter 5
184

and Siebel Systems (customer information applications) to provide a variety of packaged
application software.
For some startup e-businesses, the advantages of using an ASP are great, and include
exploiting the ASP’s superior level of IT experience and services while reducing hardware,
software, and personnel costs; getting access to ERP and CRM systems too expensive to be
supported internally; and allowing the e-business’s employees and management team to focus
on core business functions. The disadvantages of using an ASP are lack of control in terms
of application performance and data, data security concerns, and the additional costs that
may be incurred to customize application features.43 Before you contract with an ASP, you
should become familiar with the size and location of its data centers and its business prac-
tices, including management policies, data security procedures, customer support levels,
and user training options.44
If your e-business is an e-retailer, effectively managing the order fulfillment
process—getting customers’ orders filled, shipped, and delivered in a timely manner—is
critical.
Outsourcing Order Fulfillment Management
Unless your e-business ships thousands of orders each day, it may be more cost-effective
for you to outsource your order fulfillment processes instead of building expensive in-house
warehousing, order picking, and order distribution systems. A fulfillment house, some-
times called a third-party logistics provider or 3PL, is an independent company that pro-
vides order fulfillment services: warehousing your products and picking, packaging,
shipping, and tracking your customers’ orders. By outsourcing your order fulfillment man-
agement to a fulfillment house, you may reduce costs by avoiding the expense of main-
taining warehouse space (including related costs such as warehouse heating, cooling,
maintenance, and insurance) and the cost of hiring employees to oversee order
processing. Additionally, partnering with a fulfillment house may enable your e-business
to offer its customers various other benefits, including increased customer service and sup-
port after the sale; additional marketing options, such as promotional gifts and gift
wrapping; and access to better shipping rates. Webgistix and Turnaround, as shown in Fig-
ures 5-30 and 5-31, are examples of fulfillment houses.

Outsourcing critical functions such as order fulfillment means that you lose a mea-
sure of control over the processes that lead directly to customer satisfaction. In order to
establish an effective e-business partnership with a fulfillment house, you should con-
sider several factors. For example, a fulfillment house should:
●
maintain adequate inventory levels to satisfy anticipated demand
●
maintain a high order-fill rate (the percentage of orders that get filled on the
same day the order is placed)
●
have a reasonable cutoff time for orders to be filled the same day
●
use a variety of well-known shipping companies
●
support real-time communication to your e-business regarding the status of
inventories and orders, instead of communicating these details via simple
batch processing
The questions you should ask a fulfillment house before partnering with it include: Are
there any restrictions on the types of items that can be warehoused and shipped? Are there
required minimum or maximum quantities of each order? Are fees are charged for each
service—shelf space, picking, packaging, shipping—and how much are the fees? What types
of management reporting on inventory and shipments is available?45

Everyone had been out there believing these crazy predictions about incredible
[e-business] growth and changing-the-world technology and it didn’t happen, and people
got scared and left. These two companies [eBay and PayPal] are two of the only ones
whose predictions were right. Their technologies are changing the way people do things.”
John Draft, financial analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co.

Some e-businesses choose to maintain a virtual inventory—that is, a record of products that do not belong
to the e-business itself, but rather to its partners, third-party manufacturers, or distributors, who own, ware-
house, and ship the products. This arrangement allows the e-business to avoid tying up its cash in
inventory. When an e-business maintains a virtual inventory, its partners control the fulfillment process, but
the e-business is still responsible to its customers for the effectiveness and timeliness of the order fulfill-
ment processes.

Confinity officially launched its person-to-person electronic payment service, now called
PayPal, in December 1999, by having celebrity spokesperson James Doohan, a.k.a.
“Scotty” on the original Star Trek™television program, use his PDA to beam money to
selected e-mail users.46, 47 Confinity’s faith in the network effect and viral marketing
was well-placed—customers began signing up for its service in droves. Customers loved
the Confinity electronic payment service, but they weren’t using it for wireless devices.
Instead they were using their personal computers and PayPal accounts to send and
receive payments for their online auction purchases and sales. By January 2000, PayPal
had more than 10,000 new customers, about 60 percent of whom were eBay buyers and
sellers. In March 2000, PayPal, which had quickly become a leading payment system for
eBay customers, merged with X.com, an online banking service; and by May 2000, Pay-
Pal had 1.5 million customers.48 In 2000-2001, the dot.com bust was taking its toll on Pay-
Pal’s competitors, including eBay’s own in-house person-to-person payment service,
BillPoint. But PayPal just keep rolling along, riding successfully on its first-mover
advantage. Within a year, the e-business had 6.5 million customers and total investor
financing of more than $200 million. Strengthened by its dominant position in the mar-
ket, PayPal began charging its high-volume customers transaction fees.49
It wasn’t all rosy, of course. Some customers complained that PayPal made it too dif-
ficult to get a check for the balance of their account; international criminals scammed
PayPal accounts, creating fraud losses that the company had to bear; and regulators tried
to find ways to keep PayPal from operating in certain states.50 But by this point PayPal had
become an unstoppable juggernaut.
In February 2002, PayPal began to be profitable, with more than 10 million custom-
ers and a customer base that was growing at about 18,000 new customers a day. Fueled
by its success, PayPal launched a successful IPO on February 15, and by the end of the day,
the e-business’s stock market value was $1.2 billion.51 But the best was yet to come.
Within five short months after launching its IPO, eBay jettisoned its in-house BillPoint ser-
vice and bought PayPal for about $1.5 billion.52
Today, eBay’s award-winning PayPal person-to-person payment system has more than
70 million customers in 45 countries around the world.53 Was the eBay buyout a good deal
for the co-founders, Thiel and Levchin? The young entrepreneurs received millions in
eBay stock and moved on to new opportunities. Thiel is now president of Clarium Capi-
tal Management LLC, a private investment fund, and Levchin is involved with a new
e-business venture named Yelp!, an online person-to-person referral service.

Chapter Summary
●
To help resolve the startup and operational challenges of starting a new e-business, one
of the first things an entrepreneur should do is establish a relationship with an attorney
experienced with business startups (preferably e-business startups).
●
A copyright is a legal protection for the author of an original work such as a piece of writ-
ing, drama, music, art, or some other type of intellectual property. A trademark or ser-
vice mark is a distinctive symbol, word, or phrase that identifies a business and its
products and services.
●
An e-business should post a liability disclaimer on its Web site to protect itself from
lawsuits; it should also post a statement of its privacy policy regarding the handling and
securing of data collected at its Web site.
●
The laws affecting e-business taxation continue to change and should be monitored.
●
An e-business should create a facilities plan before searching for commercial office
space, and it should use the services of a commercial real estate broker to locate this
space and negotiate its lease.
●
Startup e-businesses often hire the employees they need as they obtain the funding
required to cover additional salaries; first hires will likely be at the senior management
level—namely, a chief technology officer and a marketing professional.
●
Electronic payment methods include payment cards (credit, debit, and charge), stored
value cards, electronic checks, electronic cash, micropayments, and P2P payment
systems.
●
To accept credit, debit, and charge cards, your e-business must have a merchant account
and access to a payment gateway.
●
You can apply for a merchant account directly with a financial institution or through a mer-
chant account provider.
●
The two major risks associated with accepting credit cards online are the cardholder not
present risk and chargebacks. When the cardholder is not present, the risk of credit card
fraud is greater. Chargebacks occur when a consumer refuses to pay for a credit charge
because of fraud, billing errors, or product returns.
●
Credit card numbers should be transmitted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption protocol.
●
To manage the various aspects of running your e-business, you will require technolo-
gies that integrate your e-business’s front-end systems (business activities with which
customers interface and over which they can exert some control) with its back-end sys-
tems (business activities that are not directly accessed by customers). Technologies for
an e-business include storefront software, content management systems, enterprise
resource planning, and customer relationship management software.
●
E-businesses may elect to outsource some of its operations to ISPs, Web hosting com-
panies, ASPs, and fulfillment houses.

Case Projects
1.
Your new e-business has outgrown its temporary office, which is located in a spare bed-
room in your house.You need to hire an assistant and a technical support person, and there
is no room for two more employees in the home office. Additionally, you are ready to set up
meetings with prospective clients and need a more professional atmosphere in which to
conduct those meetings. Create a detailed facilities plan for the commercial office space you
need, including a budget, a description of the desired area in which you want to locate your
office, and a list of the things your office space will need (such as divided work areas, wir-
ing requirements, room for office equipment, parking, security, and so on).Then research the
available commercial office space in that area. If possible, arrange a meeting with a com-
mercial real estate broker to discuss your options.
2.
You are creating a startup e-business following the B2C model and need to decide whether
to use an ISP or a Web hosting company to host your Web site. Use links on the student
online companion to this text, online search tools, or other resources to locate and review the
options provided by two ISPs and two Web hosting companies. Create a table comparing
the cost and services of each of the four companies, make a decision on which company you
want to host your Web site, and use the table to discuss your analysis and final choice with
a group of classmates.

ment method(s) you selected and the reasons for your choice(s). If you selected a method that
could be vulnerable to fraud, list the ways in which your e-business will protect against potential
fraud. Identify the storefront software solution you have chosen and the reasons for your choice.
Identify the hosting solution your selected and the reasons for your choice.
Give your presentation to a group of classmates who have been selected by your instructor
to critique your e-business idea, your payment selections, fraud-prevention procedures, store-
front software, and Web hosting solution.

In 1994, nationally recognized wine expert Peter Granoff and his brother-in-law Robert
Olson, an engineer knowledgeable about computer software, were enjoying a lovely din-
ner when the discussion turned to interactive software, the Internet—and wine.1 Why
couldn’t people buy wine and related products from an online store? Surely consumers
would flock to a Web site that provided in-depth information about the wines and the
wineries that made them. What if the online store featured only the best wines from the
best vintners, to ensure that customers would be satisfied with every wine purchase?
And what if it used sophisticated interactive software tools to make buying wine and related
products as easy and convenient as possible? Was an online store that catered to wine afi-
cionados really a viable e-business idea? To find out, Granoff and Olson ran their idea
by several wineries. Encouraged by the positive responses they received, Granoff and
Olson became e-business pioneers by launching Virtual Vineyards in early 1995. Virtual
Vineyards hit the mark with wine buyers, and by 1996 sales were about $1 million a
year.2 But the saga of Virtual Vineyards was just beginning.

Marketing is the process of developing the mutually satisfying relationships between your
e-business and your customers that result in sales and profits. Specifically, marketing
involves developing the strategies (plans) and selecting the tactics (actions) necessary to
build these relationships. Classic marketing strategies are based on the Four Ps model,
which is composed of product, place, promotion, and price (Figure 6-1). The Four Ps, also
called the marketing mix, is a concept that was originally developed more than 40 years ago
by consultant and marketing educator E. Jerome McCarthy.3 The Four Ps marketing mix
model identifies those elements of your marketing strategies and tactics over which you
have control:4
●
Product: all the elements of each individual product or service that is to be sold,
including branding, product features, packaging, installation, service, and
warranties
●
Place: activities pertaining to how the product or service is distributed to the
customer, including distribution channels and intermediaries, warehousing,
order fulfillment, and shipping
●
Promotion: activities pertaining to how information about products and ser-
vices is communicated to customers, including advertising, public relations,
promotion, and customer education
●
Price: the cost of the product or service to the customer
While the Four Ps marketing mix model looks at marketing from an “inside-out” per-
spective (from your e-business to your customer), another way to look at the marketing
mix is from an “outside-in” perspective (from your customer to your e-business). In this
FIGURE 6-1

case, the marketing mix is referred to as the Four Cs model (Figure 6-2); and it involves
the following elements, all specific to the customer’s point of view:5
●
Customer Needs and Wants: product variables are redefined in terms of what
the customer needs and wants
●
Convenience: product distribution variables are broadened to include all the
elements involved in obtaining and using a product or service
●
Communication: promotion variables are broadened to include all communi-
cations with customers designed to increase sales
●
Cost to the Customer: price variables change to be the total cost to the cus-
tomer of consuming a product or service
When used together, the Four Ps, the Four Cs, and other extended marketing mix mod-
els can provide you with a broad view of the marketing variables you will need to define
as you develop your e-business’s marketing strategies. An important first step in develop-
ing those marketing strategies is branding your e-business and your Web site.

A brand incorporates all aspects of your customers’ perceptions about and experiences
with your business. Traditionally, the effectiveness of business branding is measured in
terms of marketplace awareness—name and product or service recognition. For an

Since the marketing mix concept was first developed, educators and marketing professionals continue to
define various extended marketing mix models that include additional variables such as people, pro-
cess, physical evidence, public image, online scope, Web site operations, Web site content, online com-
munities, and networking technologies.6, 7, 8

e-business, building an effective brand often leads to more than just a spike in market-
place awareness—it leads directly to actions taken by consumers at your e-business
Web site.
What Is a Brand?
What exactly is a brand? According to the American Marketing Association, a brand is a
combination of name, logo, and design that identifies a business’s products or services and
differentiates the products and services from those of competitors.9 It is the difference
between a soda and a Coke, a tissue and Kleenex, drinking water and Evian, running shoes
and Nikes, and online search and Google. A brand comprises the subjective experience that
consumers have with a product or service, as well as the assumptions they make about
it and the trust they have in it satisfying their needs. In many respects, a brand is much
like an identity or personality—it is the “face” a business presents to the world.10, 11

“Simply put, a brand is a promise. By identifying and authenticating a product or ser-
vice, it delivers a pledge of satisfaction and quality.”
Walter Landor, marketing pioneer and authority on branding, whose legacy is on
display at the Smithsonian
Having a trusted brand that is recognizable to your customers and to strategic busi-
ness partners can drive sales and increase your e-business’s chances of achieving success.
Building a successful brand for your e-business involves understanding how your custom-
ers perceive your products and services, selecting an appropriate brand name and
e-business’ logo, and registering a domain name (URL) that ties closely to your products
and services in the minds of consumers.

Building Your E-Business’s Brand
To build your e-business’s brand, you must first define how you want your customers to
perceive the products or services offered by your e-business. This perception is the core
identity or essence of your e-business’s brand. Building this perception and a successful
brand involves a lot of homework. For example, you must:12, 13
●
understand the core elements of your e-business and how these elements dif-
fer from those of your competitors
●
identify how your e-business’s products or services solve customers’ prob-
lems or fulfill their specific needs
●
determine how to convince potential customers that your e-business is the best
source for the products or services you offer
●
consider methods you can use to build customer loyalty
●
select the words, phrases, and images that put the best public “face” on your
e-business
Next, you name your brand by choosing your e-business’s name, logo and symbols, and
domain name.
Naming Your Brand
After doing your homework, the next step in branding your e-business is selecting a name
and logo image that you want potential customers to identify with your specific products
or services. Brand names should be kept simple so that they are easy to remember, spell, and
understand. Traditionally, many successful brand names have been proper names; for
example, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Ford, Kodak, and Sony all resonate with customers who
identify these proper names with specific products. Early and successful e-businesses
such as Yahoo!, Amazon.com, eBay, and priceline.com are also branded with proper names.
In addition to being short, easy to remember, and easy to spell, Internet brand names
should also have “snap”—meaning they should evoke a memorable emotional response and
bring to mind thoughts about specific products and services. For example, consider Hot-
mail as a name for an e-mail provider, or EarthLink as a name for an ISP. Both names are
snappy, and they embody a clear, intuitive connection to the products or services these
respective e-businesses offer.
Personalizing a brand by naming an e-business after a well-known individual can help
make the brand memorable. While not many people are likely to remember the
generically-named PC Limited and its products and services, most people will immedi-
ately recognize this e-business by the name it uses today, Dell (Figure 6-3). Switching the
brand name from PC Limited to the proper name Dell (based on the name of the founder,
Michael Dell) in 1987 enhanced the publicity potential of the e-business.14 A conse-
quence of this is that all the attention and publicity Michael Dell receives can directly ben-
efit (or tarnish) the Dell brand. Another example of an e-business that built its brand around
a personality (a fictional one, in this case) is the original Ask Jeeves online search tool (Fig-
ure 6-4). The Ask Jeeves brand was personified by Jeeves the butler, a figure who embod-
ied impeccable personal service and suggested that the e-business, by association, had a
similarly attentive personality. The character of Jeeves was the distinctive hook that
resonated with users and stayed in their minds. You should be aware, however, that brand-
ing can be a dynamic and evolving process. In 2005, for example, the company that owns

the Ask Jeeves search tool announced plans to rename the search tool and revamp its
features. In addition, as part of a new branding effort designed to emphasize the search tool’s
enhanced features, the company announced plans to retire the portly butler.

Once you develop a brand, you should be vigilant about protecting it from abuse or misuse by posting a
copyright notice on your Web site, by listing rules for how your logo and company name should be used,
and by monitoring the Web for instances of unauthorized use of your Web site logo, art, and text.15
Chapter 6

A domain name or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address associated with a
Web page that a Web browser uses to locate the page. (You’ll learn more about the structure
of domain names later in the chapter.) In the early days of e-business, before single-word
domain names (URLs) were gobbled up by entrepreneurs, names based on common words
plus the domain—such as Business.com and Office.com—were popular. One disadvantage of
these types of generic names is that customers may not be able to make a direct connec-
tion to the specific products and services offered at the respective e-businesses. For example,
can you tell what types of products or services are available at Business.com or Office.com?
Without a trip to the respective Web sites, it is difficult to know. (Business.com is actually a B2B
directory, and Office.com is a small business portal offering tips, articles, and links to other
e-businesses.)
Another disadvantage of names based on common words is that although such names
are short and easy to spell, they lack snap and are not especially memorable. In general,
there is some doubt among professional marketers about whether generically named
e-businesses can build a successful brand over the long term. Some professional market-
ers are also critical of the common practice of choosing an e-business name that includes a
specific reference to the Internet and Web, such as Cyberchefs. Names tied directly to the
Internet and the Web are thought to be limiting in the long term, perhaps because they
may inadvertently bear some of the negative connotation that has lingered after the fail-
ure of so many e-businesses during the dot.com bust of 2000-2001. If you have an e-business
whose name includes prefixes such as “cyber,” “net,” or “tech,” or domain name suf-
fixes such as “.com” or “.biz,” you should consider whether these prefixes and suffixes might
limit the usefulness of your e-business’s name over time.16
In choosing a brand name, it is wise to indulge in a little “creative brainstorming.” For
example, you could create a list of words or phrases that describe your e-business. Then
play with the list to create different combinations of words, eliminating those words or word
combinations that do not work well. Next, you could invite family, friends, and advisors to
critique the short list of words or word combinations that remain.17 Alternatively, some
companies look to branding professionals such as The Namestormers and NameLab to help
them create a memorable brand name for their business (Figures 6-5 and 6-6).

After selecting a brand name, be certain to check the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office’s searchable trademark database (TESS) to determine if this name is available. After
this, your next step is to check to see what domain names are available.

Domain Names
As you learned earlier in the chapter, domain names (URLs) are Web page addresses rec-
ognized by a Web browser. For example, the domain name “www.rackspace.com” is the
address of Rackspace Managed Hosting’s Web site’s home page. The “www” portion is called
a subdomain and points to a specific part of Rackspace’s Internet services. By conven-
tion, most companies use the “www” subdomain to point to their Web site. The “rack-
space” portion of the domain name identifies the organization or entity associated with
the domain name. The “com” portion is called the top-level domain (TLD) and identifies
the general category in which the domain name is registered. For example, the top-level
domain “.com” indicates the commercial domain. Originally, there were seven TLDs des-
ignating the major kinds of organizations that published Web pages. Recently, in an attempt
to satisfy the exploding demand for domain names, the seven original TLDs have been
expanded into sixteen TLDs, shown in Table 6-1. As of this writing, there are other TLDs
that have been proposed and are being considered.

Domain name registration is managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization that operates under the auspices of the
U.S. Department of Commerce. ICANN actually contracts the domain name registration
process to approved private companies (called accredited registrars) such as Network
Solutions, GoDaddy.com, and Register.com. Figures 6-7 through 6-9 illustrate the Web sites
of these accredited registrars.
You can use search tools at an accredited registrar’s Web site to search a database of
already assigned domain names to determine if your domain name choice is available or if
someone has already registered it. If the domain name you desire is available, you can reg-
ister it for a fee ranging from about $7-$35 per year.

As you have seen, some e-businesses—Amazon.com and Register.com, for
example—chose to build their brand by making sure that their e-business’s name is the
same as their domain name. But an e-business’s name and domain name do not have to be
the same. Consider the domain name for Barnes & Noble (online bookstore), which is
bn.com, and for Ernst & Young (major accounting firm), which is ey.com. Note how these
brief domain names are easy to remember and easy to type in a Web browser; yet they still
make a good connection to the business name. When a domain name is closely associ-
ated with the e-business name, products, or services, it becomes another tool for brand-
ing your e-business.
Be aware that today the availability of short, meaningful domain names in the .com
domain is very limited. In fact, most English words have already been registered as domain
names in the .com domain. You may choose to use another business-oriented domain, such
as .biz, to register your domain name. Alternatively, to register in the more familiar .com
domain, you might need to invent a fun new word for a domain name, such as “google”—a
wordplay on the mathematical term “googol,” which describes a very large number
(10100).18
Another alternative is to buy the domain name you want from someone who has already
registered it. A quick Web search using the keywords “domain name resellers” will pro-
vide a list of many e-businesses who operate as domain name resellers. Reselling domain

names has become big business. According to the Ecommerce Times, the volume of domain
name reseller transactions tripled in 2004, and the average domain name resale price was
just over $9,000.19 Two types of companies or individuals register multiple domain
names for resale: legitimate domain name brokers and cybersquatters. Domain name bro-
kers register generic domain names that they think will be easy to resell. Cybersquat-
ters register domain names that are often a company name or acronym with the intent of
selling the domain name to its rightful owner. Cybersquatting became illegal in 1999 with
the passage of the U.S. Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.20
A domain name is not a trademark. In order to function as a trademark, the domain
name must serve as a product identifier, and not merely as a Web address. If the domain
name acts separately as a product identifier, the domain name must be registered with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as a trademark or service mark. If registered trademark
owners want to use their trademarks as their domain names, they must file for domain
name registration with a registrar accredited by ICANN.
Brand names, domain names, and trademarks have become interchangeable in con-
sumers’ minds. Since domain names have economic value, many e-businesses are register-
ing their domain name as a trademark. Thus, when choosing your domain name, be sure
to check whether the name you choose infringes on another e-business’s registered
trademark. The e-business NameProtect offers a free search tool that checks for both reg-
istered trademarks and registered domain names. You should also check county and state
business name databases to determine the availability of the name, as you may also be
required to register your name with the country and state in which your e-business resides.
The ultimate goal of building your brand name is to develop marketing strategies that
target and draw customers. Before you can define your marketing strategies, however,
you must understand the marketplace in which your e-business operates. Market research
helps you develop that understanding.

Market research involves collecting and analyzing the data you need to make informed
decisions about how to go about selling your business’s products or services in a specific
marketplace. Market research is used to identify needs, trends, customer preferences and
opinions, and even your competitors’ stake in a marketplace. The two types of market
research are primary research and secondary research.

able domain names related to the words or phrases you enter.

Primary research involves physically collecting marketplace, consumer, and competi-
tor data, organizing and manipulating it, and then analyzing and publishing the results. Pri-
mary research can involve both quantitative research (collecting data that can be
analyzed using statistical methods) and qualitative research (collecting data that requires
informed interpretation and cannot be analyzed using statistical methods). For
e-businesses, quantitative and qualitative research usually focuses on data collected from
online customer surveys, focus groups, Web server logs, customer transaction data-
bases, and electronic tracking tools such as cookies. Cookies are small text files that are
placed on the hard drive of a viewer while that viewer (that is, potential customer) is vis-
iting a Web site.21
Gathering and then analyzing the data necessary for primary research can be time-
consuming and expensive for a startup e-business. The alternative is the most widely used
and least expensive type of research, secondary research, which involves collecting data
through secondary sources, such as market research companies, who collect data, ana-
lyze the data, and then sell research reports based on their analyses. Companies such as For-
rester, eMarketer, and NPD Group, shown in Figures 6-10 through 6-12, are examples of
market research companies.

Other sources of secondary research data for an e-business include industry white
papers, magazine articles, U.S. and foreign government databases, domestic and interna-
tional trade associations, and articles published in professional journals.22 The Web is a
great source of both free and paid secondary research material. Six Organizations that pro-
vide secondary research that might be useful to an e-business entrepreneur include STAT-
USA Internet (U.S. government statistics), DismalScientist (economic trends), AdAge.com
(advertising trends and news), Bitpipe (IT industry data and news), and The Direct Market-
ing Association (direct marketing industry data and news). Figures 6-13 through 6-15
depict the Web sites of some of these organizations.
Your branding decisions, market research, and analysis should come together in your
marketing plan, a document that shows how your e-business will manage its marketing
mix, enhance its brand, drive sales, and generate profits.

In Chapter 3, you were introduced to business planning and the various elements of a formal
business plan. As you may recall, one of these elements was a marketplace analysis sum-
mary, which provides general information about the industry within which your e-business
operates and a brief overview of your e-business’s targeted customers and competitors. A
marketing plan provides the details behind this marketplace analysis summary. It speci-
fies how your e-business will manage the marketing mix in order to generate sales and
profits. A sufficiently detailed marketing plan helps you:23
●
define the market in which your e-business will operate
●
zero in on your customers and competitors
●
determine effective ways to acquire and keep your customers
●
plan ways your e-business can deal with change
Like overall business planning, marketing planning is dynamic. Your original market-
ing plan will change over time as you add new products or services and modify your strat-
egies and tactics to adapt to changes in the marketplace.
Marketing Plan Elements
Your marketing plan, just like your business plan, may contain many different elements.
Plan elements may be organized and formatted in many different ways, depending on your
e-business’s needs. For example, the elements of a marketing plan for a startup e-business
may be different in scope and number from the elements in a plan that was created by
an existing e-business in order to introduce a new product or service. With that said, most
marketing plans, at a minimum, contain the following elements:24, 25
●
Executive Summary: summarizes the overall marketing plan
●
Situational Analysis: explains what you know about the marketplace
●
Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics: describes your overall marketing mis-
sion, identifies what you want to accomplish and how you will do it, explains
how and when your marketing tactics will be implemented, and identifies
who inside or outside your e-business will be responsible for the
implementation
●
Budget and Performance Measures: details the estimated costs associated with
accomplishing your objectives and how the results are measured
In creating a marketing plan, you might find it useful to consult examples of market-
ing plan outlines and sample marketing plans. Fortunately, you can find many online
resources that will help you do this, including samples of marketing plan outlines and com-
plete marketing plans available from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), mar-
keting services companies that publish sample plans and tips for writing plans, and
businesses that sell business and marketing planning software, such as those you learned
about in Chapter 3.

Executive Summary
The Executive Summary portion of your marketing plan is similar to the Executive Sum-
mary of your overall business plan. In no more than three pages, it briefly summarizes the
features of your marketing plan. Also like your business plan Executive Summary, your
marketing plan Executive Summary should be written last, after you create your other plan
elements.
Situational Analysis
The Situational Analysis portion of your marketing plan is based on your market research
and analysis. This section describes key aspects of the overall marketplace, such as mar-
ket size, market segments, your target market, your competition, and the individual prod-
ucts or services your e-business offers. Being thorough in your preparation of this section
is more important than meeting a specific page length.
Market size can be defined in a number of ways: for example, the number of poten-
tial consumers, consumer purchasing power, projected sales volume, and so forth. Esti-
mates of the market size for the market in which your e-business will operate should be
gleaned from reliable sources and cited appropriately. The description of market size should
also explain how the market is growing or shrinking and why.
A market segment is a subgroup of the overall market. Markets can be segmented by
a number of factors, including geographic region, demographic characteristics of consum-
ers (such as age, gender, education, family size, and income), psychographic characteris-
tics of consumers/regions (such as buying behavior and price sensitivity), and so forth.
Understanding how the market in which your e-business operates is segmented will help you
identify your target market.
Your e-business’s target market(s) is the pool of potential customers to which you will
direct your marketing efforts. A description of your target market(s) should be both quali-
tative and quantitative and should include geographic, demographic, and psychographic
profiles of potential customers. Additionally, you should describe exactly how your prod-
ucts and services meet the needs and wants of these potential customers. An analysis of the
political, economic, social, and technological factors that influence your potential custom-
ers’ buying decisions—sometimes called a PEST analysis—is often included.26 These
qualitative descriptions of your target market(s) should be supported by data from reli-
able sources, such as the total number of potential customers in the market or the aver-
age income of potential customers.

“Determining the right target audience is probably the most important part of your mar-
keting efforts, because it doesn’t matter what you’re saying if you’re not saying it to the
right people.”
Lee Ann Obringer, author of “How Marketing Plans Work” and marketing
communications consultant and designer
Chapter 6
216

The competitive analysis section of your Situational Analysis must be a comprehen-
sive summary of your top competitors: who they are, what their market share is, what their
strengths and weakness are, and how they manage the elements of their marketing mix
(product, price, distribution, and promotion). To get first-hand knowledge of your competi-
tors, you should examine their Web sites, pour over their advertising and promotional
materials, compare their pricing structures, and try out their competing products and
services.27
Lastly, your Situational Analysis should include a product and services overview sec-
tion that identifies each product or service your e-business offers. For each product or ser-
vice, you should include the following:
●
a general description
●
an explanation of how the product or service is used
●
a list of special features that differentiate your product or service from com-
petitors’ similar products or services
●
a description of online and offline distribution channels (how the product or
service will reach customers)
●
a list of the benefits customers will enjoy by using the product or service (why
customers should buy the product or service)
Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics
Objectives are specific, attainable, measurable, realistic, and time-specific goals. Your over-
all business plan, as discussed in Chapter 3, includes sales objectives for a given plan-
ning period. These are the anticipated sales in dollars (and perhaps units) for each month
or year of the plan, which will eventually be measured against actual sales results. You may
choose to reiterate your sales objectives in the Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics section of
your marketing plan. Marketing objectives are distinct from sales objectives in that they
define the marketing activity that will help your e-business meet its sales objectives. For
example, a sales objective might be to have $5 million in annual sales within the next
three years. A complementary marketing objective might be to increase the number
of return customers by 25 percent in year 1, 50 percent in year 2, and 75 percent in
year 3.
A strategy is a plan of action—what you are going to do to accomplish a goal. Marketing
strategies describe how you will manage the marketing mix in order to sell more prod-
ucts and services to current customers, acquire new customers, retain current customers,
or develop new products and services.28 In the Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics por-
tion of your marketing plan, you should include marketing strategies that describe the spe-
cific actions or tactics your e-business will employ, and it should list the marketing tools
(such as traditional advertising, PR, or online advertising) that you will use to meet your
marketing objectives. Returning to the previous example, a marketing strategy to increase

nesses, opportunities, and threats associated with various elements in the marketplace.

the number of return customers might include the following tactics: making online cou-
pons or discounts available for return customers’ purchases, sending e-mail to existing cus-
tomers (who agree to receive e-mail) that contains links to new product pages,
automatically enrolling return customers in an online contest each time they make a pur-
chase, and so forth. Including a schedule of who inside or outside your e-business is
responsible for implementing each tactic and a timetable for the various implementations
is also useful.
Budget and Performance Measures
Your marketing budget will be structured similarly to the expenses portion of the pro-
jected income statement included in your overall business plan. The budget should reflect
the details of what it will cost to implement your marketing plan by itemizing how much
you are going to spend, on what, and when. You may choose to organize the budget by objec-
tive, by product, or by time period.
The final element of a marketing plan is a description of performance measures—that
is, the ways in which you will measure the success of your marketing strategies and tactics.
One basic performance measure is to track sales results and the ratio of sales to market-
ing expenses. Other important measures involve keeping track of the number of direct mail
and permission-based e-mail responses, the number of visitors to your Web site, the num-
ber of Web site visitors who actually make a purchase, the number of people who click
through to your Web site from other Web sites, and so on. (In Chapter 9, you will learn how
to measure activity at your Web site and how to interpret and make use of these
measurements.)
After drawing up a marketing plan and developing various marketing strategies, you
will need to learn about some of the marketing tactics and tools you can use to imple-
ment your marketing strategies.
M A R K E T I N G

One of the fallacies of the marketing approach of many early e-businesses was the attitude
that “If we build it, they will come.” Although this approach may work in the brick-and-
mortar world, where hundreds of people may drive by every day and see a new business, it
doesn’t suit the e-business world, where a new Web site can be like a brick-and-mortar
store built on a dead-end street with few people driving by. Drive-by Web “viewers,” those
who are simply doing undirected browsing, may, in fact, never find a specific e-business.
Even when visitors set out to search for Web sites that are closely attuned to their inter-
ests, they may never arrive at the Web site of a specific e-business that best fits their needs.
This is because the huge volume of available Web sites may make it very difficult for any spe-
cific e-business’s Web site to appear near the top of a search results list. Given this situa-
tion, unless you make a special effort to let potential customers know how to find your
e-business’s Web site, the site is likely to have few visitors. One way to increase traffic to
your site is to make certain that all major search tools have information about your site in
their indexes.
Chapter 6
218

Search Tool Submissions
A majority of people find the products or services they are looking for online by searching
for them as opposed to going directly to a Web site they already know about. In fact, a 2004
report by the Pew Internet & American Life Project indicates that more than 80 per-
cent of Americans who are online use search tools (both keyword searches and directory
links), and that on any given day, more than half of Internet users are using search tools.29
Online search tools include search engines, meta search engines, and directories. They
use a variety of methods to gather Web page information and build indexes of Web pages.
Search engines are search tools that use software programs (known as spiders, bots,
or crawlers) that automatically update their indexes of Web pages by examining existing
pages and moving from page to page across the Web via hyperlinks. Because of the grow-
ing volume of Web pages, any changes made to a Web site, such as pages added or deleted,
may take some time to be indexed by search engine spiders. Examples of popular search
engines include Google, Teoma, and MSN Search, as shown in Figures 6-16 through 6-18.
FIGURE 6-16

Another type of search tool is a meta search engine. A meta search engine allows users
to perform a keyword search on multiple search tool indexes and then combines the results
of that search action into one report. Meta search engines include metacrawler, Dog-
pile, KartOO, and Mamma, as shown in Figures 6-19 through 6-22.

A directory is a search tool that generates its Web page index with information submit-
ted by people using forms available at the directory’s Web site. The information is then cat-
egorized in a way that’s similar to how the old library card catalog system worked. To find
information using a directory, a visitor clicks multiple links to “drill down” from category
to subcategory until the desired Web page is found. The first popular directory was Yahoo!
Other directories include LookSmart Directory and the Open Directory Project; Web sites
for these directories are shown in Figures 6-23 through 6-25.

tool information, use a link on the student online companion to this text to check out the information at the
SearchEngineWatch Web site.
Chapter 6
224

Today, most search tools combine the features of both a search engine (keyword search)
and a directory (category links). For example, Google and Yahoo! have both a keyword
search index and a directory of category links, and many search tools actually rely on the
indexes of other search tools to deliver search results. For example, the search results for
the AltaVista and All the Web search tools are provided by the Yahoo! Search index. So sub-
mitting your e-business’s Web page information to one or two search tools such as Yahoo!
Search means your pages will likely appear on the search results lists of many other
search tools.
Search tools that accept direct submissions will have a link (likely on their home page)
to a page describing how your e-business can submit its Web page information plus a Web-
based form in which you enter your information. The information you may be required
to submit can include a short description of your e-business, primary keywords or phrases
that potential customers might enter when using the search tool to locate Web sites simi-
lar to yours, and general information about your e-business.
Some search tools that accept submissions allow you to do so for free but with no guar-
antee that your pages will be indexed; some operate a paid-inclusion program in which
an e-business is guaranteed accelerated inclusion of its Web pages in a search tool’s index for
a fee. Because individual search tools operate differently, it is a good idea to check out the
submission and paid-inclusion programs of the search tool in which you are interested.
Getting your Web pages indexed by a spider or submitting your Web page informa-
tion through a free or paid-inclusion program does not guarantee that your pages will appear
at or near the top of a search results list. Since search tools are such an important means
of attracting customers, you should try to design your e-business’s Web pages so that you
optimize their chances of appearing prominently in a search results list.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Search engines that use spiders to find Web pages build their indexes, create search results lists,
and rank pages in their search results list through a variety of methods. For example, some
search engines get their indexing information from page content and page titles (the text that
appears in the Web browser title bar). Some use the information in meta tags (used in Web
page HTML coding) to find keywords for indexing and for descriptions of pages in their search
results lists. Some evaluate the number of relevant incoming links to a specific page to estab-
lish a page ranking for their search results lists. Some accept payment in exchange for promi-
nently listing Web sites on a search results page that contain specific keywords. Most search
engines use a combination of these and other methods to create and report search results.
The basic way a search engine works is that it uses the keywords a user enters together
with a ranking algorithm to first identify which pages to include in a search results list and
then to rank those pages (generally called hits) in some order of relevancy. Different
search engines have different ranking algorithms. Given the sheer volume of Web pages that
are available today, a search results list of hits can be very long. Depending on the search
strategies used by the search engine and the keywords or phrases entered by the user,
a search results list can consist of hundreds or perhaps thousands of pages—most of which
are of questionable relevance. Users generally expect to find the most relevant Web page
links near the top of a search results hit list, certainly within the top 10 or 15 Web pages
listed. Thus, as an e-business entrepreneur, your goal is to get the searcher’s attention by
making sure your Web pages appear at or near the top of a search results list.
Marketing Your E-Business
225

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art of building your Web pages and Web site
links to maximize the chances of your pages getting positioned at or near the top of as many
search results lists as possible. Short of paying to become a prominent search result
(which may not be a viable option for a cash-strapped startup e-business), there is cur-
rently no guaranteed method of ensuring that your e-business’s Web pages will be listed at
or near the top of a search results list for every one of your relevant keywords. There are,
however, a number of steps that you can take to increase your Web pages’ chances of being
well-positioned in a search results list. The first step involves making sure you write effec-
tive descriptions of your products and services, and then pick as many highly relevant
keywords as possible when you submit your Web pages to a search tool. Other search engine
optimization techniques include:
●
writing clear and on-topic Web page content that a search engine can
easily index
●
using descriptive Web page titles
●
avoiding frames and dynamic content
●
using text navigation links among pages at your Web site
●
using meta tags
●
arranging to feature relevant inbound links from other Web sites, as these are
used by some search tools to determine a Web page’s ranking or relevance
Page Content and Page Title
Some search tools assess the number of times the keywords being searched appear on a
Web page and their location on the page to determine the page’s relevance and thus its rank
in a search results list. You should therefore carefully write the content on each of your
Web pages to focus on a specific topic and include the keywords and phrases a user might
enter in a search tool to find pages on that topic.30
The Web page title is the text that appears in the title bar of the Web browser when you
visit a Web page. Some search engines use the Web page title to index and report Web
pages. Other search engines look for keywords in a Web page title in order to rank the page
in a search results list.31 Additionally, some search tools use the Web page title to iden-
tify the page in the search results list. You should make sure that the title of each of your
Web pages accurately reflects the page’s content.
Web pages are created using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a markup lan-
guage that identifies page components so that the page can be displayed in a Web browser.
A Web page title is created using the following HTML tags or codes: <title> and </title>. An
example of the HTML tags that specifies the title of a Web page is <title>Rackspace Man-
aged Hosting</title>. Figure 6-26 illustrates how this title appears in the Internet Explorer
Web browser title bar. Figure 6-27 illustrates how this title appears in a Teoma search
results list that was generated by entering the keyword “rackspace.”
Frames, Dynamic Content, and Navigation Links
Web page creators use HTML to divide a browser window into viewing areas, called frames,
in which different Web pages at the same site can be viewed all at once. Many Web page
designers avoid frames, however, in part because some search engine spiders are not able
Chapter 6
226

to “see” the Web pages that appear in the frames.32 Search engine spiders may also have
trouble with pages that are loaded with images and dynamic “flash” content. When design-
ing a Web page, keep in mind that the simpler the content, the easier it will be for a search
engine spider to “see” and index the page. To index multiple pages at your Web site, a
search engine spider follows the hyperlinks that connect these various pages. To enable the
search engine spider to easily locate and follow your hyperlinks from page to page, make
certain that any Web pages that contain image-based hyperlinks also have corresponding
text-based hyperlinks that the search engine can read.33
Meta Tags
HTML meta tags are used to add information to a Web page that only a Web browser can
see. A few search engines get additional information—such as a page description and rel-
evant keywords—from the text inserted between HTML meta tags. Meta tags are placed at
the top of a Web page between the heading HTML tags <head> and </head>, and they use
the following format:34
<meta name=“description” content=“Description goes here.”>
<meta name=“keywords” content=“Keywords go here, separated by commas.”>
Figure 6-28 illustrates the meta tags on the Rackspace Managed Hosting home page.

Success in Doing What You Love
E-business entrepreneurship comes in many flavors—selling all types of products,
providing a variety of services, and making all kinds of information available to tar-
geted markets. For Danny Sullivan, a California newspaper researcher and reporter,
the e-business itch came in the mid-1990s when he first experienced the Web. Sulli-
van realized immediately that he wanted to be part of the Internet and Web revolu-
tion, but how? The newspapers Sullivan worked for had not yet discovered the power
of the new communication medium. So Sullivan left newspaper publishing and joined
a Web development company that not only built Web sites, but also used all types
of online marketing tools to promote those sites.35
One day, when a client asked a question about which keywords would best posi-
tion his Web site in a search results list—and no one at the company could give him
the answer—Sullivan’s experience in newspaper research kicked in. He began
researching and learning everything he could about search engines and directories
and how they worked. He then used his research to publish search engine optimi-
zation tips and other search engine information online in the Webmasters Guide to
Search Engines. The Guide became very popular with Web development, design,
and marketing professionals. Before long, Sullivan left the Web development com-
pany and set up his own e-business site, SearchEngineWatch, which was devoted to
all things related to search engines and directories.36
Much of the general search engine information at SearchEngineWatch, such as
a directory of search engines and search engine rankings, was free to site visitors;
but there was also lots of in-depth information that Web page designers, e-business
marketers, and other professionals could access for a subscription fee. The Search-
EngineWatch site continued to grow in popularity, providing up-to-date search engine
news and search engine optimization information to its viewers. In late 1997, Sulli-
van harvested his new e-business by selling it to the Web publishing powerhouse
Jupitermedia. Sullivan stayed on as editor, continuing to do what he
loved—researching and writing about the search industry.37

Today, Sullivan is recognized as a leading authority on search engines and
search engine marketing. He continues to edit SearchEngineWatch and also man-
ages a search industry blog, SearchEngineWatch Forums. Together, the Web sites
for SearchEngineWatch and SearchEngineWatch Forums generate more than
200,000 page views (requests to load a page by a browser) each day.38 Sullivan
also hosts search industry conferences.
Link Popularity
Link popularity is a measure of the number of relevant, high-quality, inbound links there are
to your Web pages. Many search engines now look at a page’s link popularity to establish key-
word relevancy and to rank the page in a search results list. You can find a number of online
tools to check a page’s link popularity, such as the Marketleap Link Popularity Check, the Web-
master Toolkit Link Popularity Checker, and LinkPopularity.com, shown in Figures 6-29
through 6-31.
At each of these pages, you can enter the URL for your Web page to see how many other
sites are linking to it. Later in this chapter, you learn about acquiring high-quality inbound
links for your Web pages.
Given the complexity involved in ensuring that your e-business’s Web pages appear
among the top search results hits for specific keywords, you may at some point need to seek
assistance from search engine optimization professionals (called SEOs) to optimize your
pages. Professional SEOs can offer a variety of tools to evaluate how effective your
e-business’s Web page content, page titles, internal links, meta tag content, and link popu-
larity are at getting your pages listed near the top of a search results list.

Because search engine optimization is an ongoing process, you should periodically con-
duct some online searches using various relevant keywords to review how your e-business’s Web
pages appear in the search results lists. Tracking your Web page’s ranking on search results lists
will also help you assess how well your Web page search engine optimization techniques are
working. Monitoring search results lists can provide other useful information as well, such as
the presence of a new competitor and how well your competitors’ Web pages are optimized.
In addition to submitting information to search tools and optimizing Web pages for
search engine spiders, you should also consider using traditional marketing tools such as
public relations and advertising to get your e-business and its Web site noticed.
Public Relations
Public relations (PR) is the process of establishing and maintaining a company’s public
image. When it works well, a public relations effort is one of the more cost-effective mar-
keting tools a business has at its disposal. Public relations activities for an e-business can
include developing strong and positive media, community, consumer, and governmental
relations; informing the general public about the e-business’s policies, procedures, activi-
ties, and accomplishments; and, if necessary, managing crisis communications.
Part of the art of a public relations effort is writing effective press releases and send-
ing those releases to the appropriate destinations at just the right time. A press release is
a short announcement of a newsworthy item that is sent to members of the press. A timely
and effectively written press release can attract the attention of writers and editors, and
if it’s published, it can be a boon to your e-business. Sending the release to the right mem-
bers of the press also makes a big difference. Another important consideration is to make
sure that the news media’s audience matches that of the e-business’s target market(s).
For example, a news radio station may have audience demographics similar to that of an
e-business offering online stock trading, while a rock ‘n’ roll radio station may not. While it’s
clear in this example on which station an e-business should focus its PR efforts, not all PR
choices may be so clear. It is a good idea to work with a public relations professional who
can handle this aspect of your marketing effort.
Advertising
As an e-business entrepreneur, you may need to use both online and traditional advertising
for two reasons: to let the public know about your e-business (i.e., to build your brand-
ing name) and to drive traffic to your Web site (to generate direct sales). Online advertis-
ing includes banner, sidebar, pop-up, pop-under, floating, and streaming media ads;
permission-based e-mail advertising and newsletters; featured or sponsored placement at
other Web sites; and paid placement on the search results lists. Traditional advertising
includes radio, television ads, and print media advertising.

billion by 2009.39

Banner, Sidebar, Pop-Up, Pop-Under, Floating, and Streaming Media Ads
Banner ads are rectangular images, or banners, that appear fixed in place on a Web page
and that link to the advertiser’s Web site. The typical size for a banner ad is 468 pixels wide
by 60 pixels high. A sidebar ad, also called a skyscraper ad, is vertical rather than horizon-
tal and is typically 600 pixels high by 120 pixels wide. Pop-up ads and pop-under ads
open in their own window on top of a Web page or underneath it on the desktop,
respectively. Pop-up and pop-under ads that appear in their own window, and thus must
be must manually closed, are unpopular with many viewers. In fact, most Web browsers now
contain a pop-up and pop-under ad blocking feature that can be turned on or off, or cus-
tomized to allow ads only from specific Web sites.
Floating ads, also called Shoshkele ads (pioneered by United Virtualities and named
Shoshkele after the nickname of the company founder’s daughter40), appear to float across
a Web page for a few seconds, then settle in a specific area of the page or automatically
close. Unicast was the first company to use streaming media to present ads with audio and
video in their own window. Floating ads and streaming media ads belong to a category of
ads known as rich media, because they contain interactive elements, audio, and video.41
You can see examples of floating ads and streaming media ads at the United Virtualities and
Unicast Web sites. Figure 6-32 illustrates the United Virtualities Web site.

Online ads are generally priced according to the number of impressions, or the num-
ber of times the ad is viewed. This pricing is expressed in cost per thousand (CPM)
impressions. The CPM for an online ad can range from a few pennies, to a few dollars, to
much more, depending on the popularity of the site on which the ad appears, the demo-
graphics of the site’s users, the demand for ad space, and the type of ad. Some online ads
are priced on a pay-per-click basis; you pay only when a viewer clicks through to your
Web site using the ad. The least expensive (and least effective) online ads are banner ads.
Because of their size, sidebar ads can be more effective and are therefore more expen-
sive than banner ads. Pop-up, pop-under, floating, and streaming media ads are more effec-
tive than banner or sidebar ads, and thus are the most expensive types of online ads.42
Some online ads can be targeted to the specific demographics of the registered users
at a Web site. For example, an online ad could be targeted to Web site viewers living in a spe-
cific zip code with a median income greater than $75,000, or it could be targeted to an even
more specific or narrow audience by being designed to appear only on selected pages at
a given Web site. Targeted ads are usually more expensive than those that are not tar-
geted, but the higher cost of targeted ads is often worth it, because effectively targeted ads
can generate high click-through rates. The click-through rate is the percentage of view-
ers who click an online ad to view the advertised Web site. Click-through rates for tar-
geted ads may be many times higher than the click-through rates for non-targeted ads.
Opt-In E-Mail Advertising and Newsletters
Permission-based e-mail advertising, also called opt-in e-mail advertising, is a feature of
permission marketing, the process of getting consumers to voluntarily learn more about a
company and its products and services. Opt-in email advertising involves sending e-mail
advertising messages or e-mail newsletters to potential customers who have agreed to
receive or “opt-in” to the messages. It is important to remember that opt-in e-mail mes-
sage or newsletter recipients choose to receive these messages. Opt-in e-mail advertising is
not unsolicited junk mail, commonly called spam.
Opt-in e-mail advertising can be effective because the target audience has chosen to
receive the e-mail advertising and, therefore, consists of a group of consumers who are more
predisposed to purchase a business’s products or services. In its fifth annual report on con-
sumer e-mail advertising, DoubleClick reports that in 2004, 32 percent of opt-in adver-
tising recipients clicked through to the Web site being advertised in the e-mail message and
made an immediate purchase; a slightly smaller percent clicked through to get more infor-
mation and then returned later to make a purchase; and 12 percent clicked through to
view more information but made their purchases offline.45 According to the DoubleClick
T I P
Click fraud—creating fraudulent pay-per-click data with phony clicks—is becoming a major concern for
online advertisers that follow the pay-per-click revenue model. Different types of click fraud have been
reported, including businesses that repeatedly click competitors’ ads to run up advertising expenses
and e-businesses that bill advertisers at their sites for click-throughs that were not really made. Some
e-businesses that provide software or services to help prevent click fraud include PPCTrax.com,
ClickFacts.com, and WhosclickingWho.com.43, 44

report, many consumers prefer opt-in e-mail advertising to other forms of direct sales tech-
niques such as telemarketing, in-person direct sales, or direct mail.46

“Permission marketing turns strangers into friends and friends into loyal customers.”
Seth Godin, author and marketing guru
Some e-businesses who use opt-in e-mail advertising build their own databases of e-mail
addresses by encouraging Web site visitors to complete and submit an online form that will
enable them to get additional product information or to subscribe to an industry
newsletter. Because of the negative consumer attitudes about spam, an e-business that offers
opt-in e-mail sign-up at its Web site should be certain of each sign-up’s validity. The best
way to do that is to set up a double opt-in process, in which a confirmation e-mail mes-
sage is sent to the consumer who signs up. The consumer’s e-mail address is not added to
the e-business’s database until he or she responds to this confirmation e-mail message.
Requiring the consumer to take to two separate actions—the original sign up and respond-
ing to the confirmation—also helps to ensure that the consumer is a willing recipient of the
opt-in e-mail advertising and should result in higher response rates.
A number of e-businesses, such as Return Path and Yesmail, maintain and rent lists of
opt-in e-mail subscribers. These lists can be useful for an e-business that does not want to
build its own opt-in database. Generally, an e-business that rents a particular list sub-
mits its e-mail advertising message to the list owner, who then sends the opt-in e-mail mes-
sage to all of the members of the list. The e-business never receives a copy of the list
members’ e-mail addresses.
An advantage of an opt-in e-mail advertising program is that the time required to
execute it is very short, just a matter of days. This means that you can execute this por-
tion of your e-business’s advertising strategy quickly, and analyze the results in real time
as they come in. This speed allows you to refine your e-business’s opt-in e-mail program and
then try it again, all in the same time frame it might take just to get an online or tradi-
tional ad published.
A disadvantage of opt-in e-mail advertising is the “false positive” response to opt-in
e-mail messages that is produced by spam blockers that mistakenly treat legitimate opt-in
e-mail as spam. Around 80 percent of all e-mail messages are spam.47 Consequently, many
ISPs, business networks, and individual consumers now employ spam filtering software to
delete suspected spam messages or to direct suspected spam into a special e-mail folder
where it can be reviewed and, if necessary, deleted. This spam blocking process often
removes legitimate opt-in e-mail messages by mistake. A study by Pivotal Veracity, an
e-mail advertising optimization services provider, indicates up to 20 percent of opt-in e-mail
messages fail to reach destination mailboxes because of spam blockers. More than half of
the businesses who participated in the study reported “false positive” effects on their opt-in
e-mail advertising because spam blockers had deleted or redirected their messages.48

Search Tool and Portal Advertising
Many e-businesses ensure that their Web sites appear on search results lists for specific key-
words by participating in various types of advertising programs sponsored directly by
search tools or by e-businesses who represent a network of search tools and portal sites. One
such type of advertising program is a search tool pay-per-click program in which an
e-business pays for placement in a search results list. To participate in this type of pay-per-
click program, you first identify search keywords relevant to your e-business. Then you
create a brief ad for each keyword, consisting of a title, description, and URL. You submit
the ad and a bid—the amount you are willing to pay each time a viewer clicks through to
your Web site—to have the ad presented in a search results list. Most bids range from a few
pennies to a few dollars. The higher the bid, the higher the placement of your e-business’s
ad in the search results list. The advertising provider then distributes your e-business ad
across its network of search tools and other Web sites. Today, most search tools are care-
ful to identify these listings as paid or “sponsored listings” to avoid confusion with their
non-paid search results.
Search tool and portal advertising providers include Yahoo! Search Marketing, MIVA
(formerly FindWhat.com), Enhance Interactive (formerly ah-ha.com), goClick.com, Google
Adsense, and Kanoodle.com. Figures 6-33 through 6-35 illustrate the Web sites of three
e-businesses that offer search tool and portal advertising programs.

E - P I O N E E R S
Bidding for Placement
In the late 1990s, one search engine—GoTo.com—changed the search industry for-
ever by allowing e-businesses to bid for placement in its search results lists. An
e-business could select keywords relevant to its products and services and then sub-
mit a bid for each keyword to GoTo.com. Each time a GoTo.com user entered one of
the keywords, the e-business’s title, description, and URL appeared in the search
results list. How high in the list the information appeared depended on the size of the
bid. The information from the highest bidder was placed at the top of the search
results list, the information from next highest bidder was placed next, and so forth, until
all bidders’ information was listed. Below these bidders would appear the actual
search results list, which listed the Web pages of businesses that did not participate
in the bidding process.It wasn’t long before other search tools began developing their
own pay-for-placement programs.
But soon there was a tremendous controversy raging over these programs.While
pay-for-placement search tool options were a boon to e-businesses who wanted to
be the first in line to get a search tool user’s attention, search results containing paid
placements at the top of the search results list were not necessarily a good thing for
search tool users. For one, users frequently found that the top listed results were
not necessarily the most relevant results for their needs. Plus, some search tools
obscured the fact that their top placements were paid placements, and eventually
questions began to arise about the editorial purity of the search results. In July
2001, the consumer watchdog group Commercial Alert filed a deceptive advertising
complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charging that several major
search tools were misleading consumers by disguising ads as legitimate search
results hits.49 In June 2002, the FTC responded to this complaint by issuing a let-
ter to major search tools requesting that they make a clear distinction between paid
and nonpaid search results hits.50 Search tools began cleaning up their act, and
today most search tool pay-for-placement advertising is clearly marked as spon-
sored or paid listings.
How did GoTo.com fare throughout all this controversy? Very well, indeed. Origi-
nally incubated by the commercial business incubator Idealab, GoTo.com went pub-
lic in June 1999; in 2001, it changed its name to Overture Services, Inc. and
broadened its advertising offerings; and in 2003, it was purchased by Yahoo!, one of
its most important strategic partners, for a reported $1.6 billion!51 In March, 2005,
Overture Services was re-branded as Yahoo! Search Marketing.
Traditional Advertising
As part of your overall advertising campaign, you should consider using traditional adver-
tising for your e-business. Traditional advertising includes print media, radio, television,
outdoor advertisements, and direct mail. Online advertising has not replaced traditional
media. In fact, the two complement each other. Costs for traditional media are often mea-
sured in CPM, as they are for online advertising. Prices for advertising in traditional media
vary widely, but are easily compared using the CPM measure.
Marketing Your E-Business

The two goals of your e-business advertising program should be to acquire new custom-
ers as inexpensively as possible and to build your brand. If your e-business does not have
the in-house expertise to design and manage an advertising campaign, consider hiring
an advertising agency. The professional marketers at an advertising agency should have the
experience and expertise to determine what does and does not work well for e-businesses
similar to yours, and can help you design your entire advertising campaign, including
helping you choose both the online and traditional advertising you should pursue. An adver-
tising agency can also help ensure that all your e-business’s advertising efforts are inte-
grated, communicate the same message, and work toward building your brand.
In addition to public relations and advertising, you can use a number of other, cost-
effective promotion methods to let the public know about your e-business.
Other Promotion Tools
Along with the formal marketing tools presented so far, there are many other tools that you
can use to promote your e-business. One basic way is to make sure that your e-business
Web site’s URL and e-mail address appear on all of your e-business’s printed materials,
including business cards, letterhead stationery and envelopes, and brochures. In addi-
tion, any building signs, company uniforms, delivery vans, shipping boxes, Yellow Page list-
ings, and trade organization directories you use—basically, any vehicles, packaging, or
venues that may be seen by potential customers—should display your e-business’s Web site
URL. Other promotion tools include link exchanges, newsgroup and Web-based forum
postings, word of mouth, weblogs, RSS feeds, affiliate programs, and Web rings and awards.
Link Exchanges
As you learned earlier in this chapter, link popularity is a very important component of
search engine optimization. Acquiring relevant, high-quality inbound links is, therefore,
important for your e-business. Many e-businesses cultivate a variety of partnerships in
order to have complementary Web sites with which to exchange links. For example, an
online pet store might exchange links with a veterinary clinic’s Web site, or a travel tour site
might exchange links with sites in its touring areas, such as restaurants, hotels, bed-and-
breakfast accommodations, and so forth.
The first step to developing link exchanges is to identify Web sites that complement
your e-business. Once you’ve identified a few such Web sites, you should send an e-mail
message to each that describes the complementary elements between your two sites and
propose a link exchange. Many e-businesses or organizations are happy to add addi-
tional links to their Web sites and to have others link to their Web site; however, some
e-businesses will not exchange links, or are very selective about the Web sites with which
they exchange links. Occasionally, an e-business might be willing to provide a link to your
Web site while not requiring you to establish a reciprocal link, because it’s simply inter-
ested in providing additional information to its own customers. Another way to encourage
link exchanges is to offer the complementary Web site some free content, such as an article
of interest to the site’s visitors, in exchange for a link to your site. E-businesses such as
LinkPartners.com can help in selecting high-quality reciprocal links (Figure 6-36).
Chapter 6
238

Beware of exchanging links through a link farm, a group of sites with unrelated con-
tent that link to each other solely for the purpose of building link popularity. Most search
engines have editorial policies against ranking pages with a link farm connection and have
very sophisticated methods of sniffing out link farm connections. Note that link farming is
sometimes called link stuffing.52

“I think it’s unfortunate that people today seem to think about links only in terms of what
Google might like, rather than asking themselves what’s the intrinsic value behind get-

or pay for that link. Think your visitors would want to find a link for a particular resource
on your site? Then install that link. These are the key criteria of linking, to me.”

Newsgroups and Web-Based Forums
A newsgroup is a topic-specific electronic “bulletin board” accessed over the Internet.
Newsgroup participants submit messages and respond to others’ messages using a Web
browser or e-mail software plug-in called a newsreader. Web-based forums are discus-
sion groups that allow participants to read and post messages through a Web site and Web
browser. Newsgroups and Web-based forums in which topics related to your e-business are
discussed can be a great source of information and can also serve as an indirect venue for
marketing your e-business. Participating in topic-related newsgroups and Web-based
forums by getting involved in the group and answering questions posted by other partici-
pants allows you to build relationships. In this way you can establish your expertise in
the topic, and indirectly market yourself and your e-business to the other participants. A
side benefit of being involved in a newsgroup or Web-based forum is that you quickly
become aware of negative postings about your e-business’s products or services, and are able
to check out any postings about your competition.
But remember that your participation only indirectly benefits your e-business—never
post blatant advertisements to the group. These groups are forums for information, not for
advertising. After you identify a newsgroup or Web-based forum to join, it is a good idea to
simply observe the message postings for a while and learn what is acceptable and what is
not acceptable to the group before you begin posting your own messages.
Old-Fashioned Word of Mouth
When customers tell their friends about your e-business, and those friends tell their friends,
and so on, an exponential explosion can occur in the number of visitors who view your Web
site and purchase your products or services. In Chapter 2, you learned about the power
of the network effect and viral marketing. At the heart of viral marketing is old-fashioned
word of mouth—one customer telling others of his or her experience. Today, a mes-
sage or recommendation can travel through “electronic word of mouth” over the Internet
from person to person around the world in seconds.
Remember Hotmail, the e-mail provider whose early success was a direct result of the
network effect and viral marketing? Amazon.com offers another great example of the
power of the network and word of mouth viral marketing. The first Amazon.com test Web
site (called a beta site) was created in late spring, 1995. Not long afterward, Jeff Bezos and
his team made the site available to 300 family members and friends who were asked to test
the site’s features.53 The following month, the Amazon.com site was made available to the
public, and to promote the site, Bezos and his team simply asked the 300 original testers
to tell others about the site. The result was phenomenal—in the first 30 days that the new
site was available to the public, Amazon.com sold books to new customers in every U.S.
state and in more than 40 countries!54
T I P
Certain rules should be followed when responding to or posting messages to newsgroups and Web-
based forums. These rules are often referred to as “netiquette” (short for network etiquette). Keep mes-
sages short, to the point, and relevant to the topic. For more information, just search the Web using the
keyword “netiquette.”

New-Fashioned Word of Mouth—Business Blogs
Weblogs, or blogs, are online diaries and have been around for quite a while. It wasn’t until
the 2004 U.S. presidential election, however, that “blog” became a household word. Dur-
ing the election, thousands of people started “blogging”—posting their thoughts on blogs
hosted by news sites that were covering the campaign and election process, or on Web sites
that supported one of the political candidates. By the end of 2004, 27 percent of Internet
users—32 million people—were reading blogs, and 8 million people had created one!55
Blogs are fast becoming an influential communication medium in the business world.
For example, many businesses now host CEO blogs that help put a “human face” on a
business. Business blogs have become the new medium for word of mouth marketing and
can be useful to your marketing efforts in several ways. For one, publishing your own blog
can help you reach out to your e-business’s target audience and build brand loyalty. In addi-
tion, tracking the blogs of others can provide you with a wealth of market research because
they can serve as venues where your happy and not-so-happy customers discuss your
business. In general, businesses consider any product- or service-related feedback that
comes from the marketplace—whether it’s good or bad—to be valuable; in the case of blogs,
you can not only tap into potentially constructive primary research, but you do so at very
little cost.
Companies as diverse as Microsoft, Stonyfield Farm, GM, and Google are using blogs
in a variety ways: as a tool that fosters internal employee collaboration; enables employ-
ees and the public to discuss new technologies; and helps the business create a perma-
nent historical record of company activities.56 Some e-businesses are even buying ad space
on popular blogs. A line can be crossed here, however, and many marketing profession-
als warn e-businesses not to publish a fake blog or “flog,” a business blog hosted by a ficti-
tious person and designed specifically to tout a new product. Many bloggers are highly
critical of any attempt to “spam” the blogging world, sometimes called the blogosphere, with
flogs.57, 58
One additional warning: Remember to never underestimate the power of the network
effect and viral marketing. Old-fashioned or new-fashioned word of mouth referrals from
satisfied customers can be a major source of new customers and revenues. But beware the
“dark side” of the network effect and viral marketing—bad word of mouth from custom-
ers who have had negative experiences with your products or services. Although a satis-
fied customer may or may not tell others about his or her experience with your e-business,
an unhappy customer is highly likely to do so.

“Obviously, I wouldn’t be doing this [publishing a blog] unless there was some sort of hope
that it would help our clients, attract new clients, and exert a greater influence in the
marketplace.”
Charlotte Li, editor at Forrester Research, Inc.
RSS
Another way to promote your e-business is to offer RSS syndication of some of your Web
site’s content to consumers. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML technology used
to publish blogs and to syndicate other types of content (such as headline news stories)
from Web sites. For a consumer, subscribing to an RSS feed (syndication) is as simple as
clicking the small red or blue RSS or XML button at an RSS-enabled Web site and then
subscribing to the RSS feed. Figure 6-37 illustrates the XML buttons used to subscribe to
various RSS feeds at the RSS in Government Web site.
The RSS syndicated content to which the user has subscribed then becomes automati-
cally available to the viewer through his or her Web browser. The current versions of the
most popular Web browsers, such as Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox, feature a built-in RSS
reader that viewers can use to read RSS content. Viewers can also download free RSS
reader plug-ins for older browsers that do not support RSS, such as the Pluck download for
older versions of the Internet Explorer browser.
Podcasting is the RSS of audio files, such as music or radio programs, and it pro-
vides yet another way for e-businesses to reach their targeted audiences. Consumers can

subscribe to a podcasting feed from a Web site in the same way that they subscribe to any
RSS feed.
Affiliate Programs
One marketing tool that many e-businesses have used effectively is an affiliate program.
An e-business affiliate program is an arrangement by which an e-business pays a flat refer-
ral fee or a commission for all sales sent to it from another Web site. To operate an affili-
ate program, an e-business must identify and draw affiliates and then connect to each
affiliate Web site via a customized link. When a visitor at an affiliate site clicks through one
of these links and makes a purchase at the e-business’s site, the affiliate is given credit for
the click through. In addition to the sale, the benefit to e-businesses is that another Web
site has an incentive to take on the marketing of the e-business’s products and services. A
pioneer in e-business affiliate programs is Amazon.com. Affiliate programs are discussed
in more detail in Chapter 7.
Web Rings and Awards
Sometimes a group of similar e-businesses will create a “chain” of links among their Web
sites that allows a visitor to link through to all of the sites in the chain. This circular chain
of links is called a Web ring. Participating in a Web ring can increase the number of visi-
tors to your e-business Web site, but it will also increase the number of visitors who leave
the site to follow the Web ring.
Another way to draw potential customers to an e-business Web site is to win an award,
such as a “cool site of the day” designation or Web design awards. Winning an award can
also help give a fledgling e-business credibility.

Selling alcoholic beverages across state boundaries involves negotiating a myriad of laws
and regulations. Virtual Vineyards moved quickly to establish strategic partnerships with
alcoholic beverage importers, distributors, and wholesalers as well as a law firm that spe-
cialized in alcoholic-beverage law. As a first mover in the industry, one of Virtual Vine-
yards’ goals was to position itself as a leader in developing an e-business model that
complied with state-by-state regulations related to the selling of alcoholic beverages as
well as becoming a lobbyist for changes in the law to make selling wine across state lines
easier.59

Despite experiencing some ups and downs that are common to startup e-businesses,
Virtual Vineyards was still standing in late 1999 when it merged with rival online wine
merchant Wine.com. The merged company retained the Wine.com name and URL, and
became the “new” Wine.com. Not long afterward, the “new” Wine.com had raised about
$100 million from VCs and others and was on its way to becoming the number one wine
portal.60, 61 The San Francisco advertising agency kirshenbaum bond + partners was
hired to design a successful brand awareness campaign for Wine.com, and millions were
spent on advertising and promotion.62, 63
By the end of 1999, it looked as though the sky was the limit for e-businesses in gen-
eral, and Wine.com in particular seemed poised for success. But it didn’t turn out that way.
Wine.com found that customer acquisition was slower than expected, distribution costs
were higher than expected, and navigating the arcane state-level alcoholic-beverage laws
and regulations designed to protect in-state businesses at the expense of out-of-state busi-
nesses was almost overwhelming.64, 65 By late 2000, Wine.com was hemorrhaging cash,
and the company merged again—this time with startup rival Wineshopper.com. The
merged company retained the by now well-branded name, Wine.com. Unfortunately, how-
ever, the merger didn’t save either of the two e-businesses. The economic downturn of
2000-2001 coupled with the dot.com bust was dealing death blows to many e-businesses
who were already in trouble—and Wine.com was one such victim. By the spring of 2001,
a Portland, Oregon-based rival, eVineyard, was able to purchase the Wine.com name, URL,
customer list, and Web site content for less than $10 million.66
In July 2001, eVineyard relaunched its Web site as “Wine.com by eVineyard” using
the www.wine.com URL. Announcing the relaunch, eVineyard Vice President Brett Lau-
ter stated, “There was a lot of brand recognition and awareness for the Wine.com name
and logo.” eVineyard CEO Larry Gerhard also noted, “In adopting the Wine.com look and
feel, we are also capitalizing on the more than $100 million that the original Wine.com
investors spend on advertising and branding.”67
Despite these high hopes, “Wine.com by eVineyard” fared little better financially than
its previous incarnations. In 2002, eVineyard restructured its operations, sought new fund-
ing, changed its name back to—you guessed it, Wine.com—and moved its operations to San
Francisco. By the fall of 2004, the latest incarnation of Wine.com remained the premier
wine e-retailer, and thus managed to draw more than $30 million in funding—$20 million of
which was from a venture capital firm Baker Capital of New York. In the funding press
release, Joseph Saviano, general partner of Baker Capital, explained, “What we found most
interesting and promising about Wine.com is the company’s tremendous brand, uniquely
positioned as the category leader in wine.”68
Another very important event in the saga of the Wine.com brand took place in May,
2005 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can no longer restrict
alcohol sales from out-of-state businesses to protect in-state businesses—now the restric-
tions, if there are any, must be applied to both in-state and out-of-state sales. It is expected
that this ruling will make state laws less restraining and, in turn, make it easier for
e-businesses like Wine.com to operate.69
Remember Peter Granoff and Robert Olson, the entrepreneurs who co-founded Vir-
tual Vineyards, and started the saga of the Wine.com brand? As of this writing, both remain
e-business entrepreneurs. Olson left Wine.com in 1999 and now serves as Vice Presi-
dent of Engineering for PostX, a technology startup. Granoff left Wine.com in 2001 and
co-founded a new business, Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant and Wine Bar in San Francisco
and the Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant Web site and online store.

Chapter Summary
●
Marketing is the process of developing the mutually satisfying relationships between your
e-business and your customers that result in sales and profits.
●
The classic marketing mix model consists of the Four Ps: product, place, promotion, and
price. Other marketing mix models include the Four Cs model (customer needs and
wants, convenience, communication, cost to the customer) and a number of extended
marketing mix models that add additional variables.
●
A brand is a combination of a name, logo, and design that identifies a business’s prod-
ucts and services. A brand name should be something that attracts attention but is easy
to remember, spell, and understand.
●
A domain name, or URL, is a Web page’s address on a Web server. A well-chosen
domain name can be an effective tool in building an e-business’s brand.
●
Market research involves collecting and analyzing the data needed to create informed
decisions about selling products or services in a specific marketplace. The two types of
market research are primary and secondary research.
●
A marketing plan is a document that provides the details of the marketplace analysis
summary portion of your business plan.
●
Marketing plans vary, but the document should include the following elements: an Execu-
tive Summary; Situational Analysis; Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics; and Budget and
Performance Measures.
●
The Executive Summary is similar to a general business plan Executive Summary and
gives an overview of a marketing plan in no more than three pages.
●
The Situational Analysis portion of your marketing plan describes what you know now
about the marketplace.
●
The Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics portion of a marketing plan itemizes your attain-
able, measurable, realistic, and time-specific goals; your strategies for achieving those
goals; and the specific tools you will use.
●
The Budget and Performance Measures portion of your marketing plan reflects the costs
of your marketing strategies and contains a section that describes how you will mea-
sure the success or failure of your marketing strategies.
●
The marketing tools you can use to promote your e-business include traditional tools
(such as radio, TV, and print ads) and public relations efforts.
●
Online marketing tools you can use include search tool submissions, search engine opti-
mization of your Web pages, online ads, opt-in e-mail and newsletter advertising, search
tool and portal advertising, link exchanges, newsgroup and Web-based forums, busi-
ness blogs, RSS feeds, affiliate programs, and Web rings and awards.

ing the Christmas season. By the late 1990s, Getz and Majdoch had successfully expanded
their seasonal retail business into Getz Majdoch Inc., an operator of a chain of seven sea-
sonal Halloween Express stores plus two lamp and home accessories shops in the Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin and northern Illinois area.1, 2
Like many other entrepreneurs in the late 1990s, Getz and Majdoch were excited
about the possibilities of doing business on the Web. They wanted to use the Internet and
the Web to expand their seasonal costume business into the national and international
marketplace. In August 1999, just in time for the Halloween season, Getz and Majdoch
launched a Web store named BuyCostumes.com. Amazingly, despite the fact that they
had little time to promote the site, the new online store garnered just about as much in Hal-
loween sales as one of their existing brick-and-mortar stores.3
Encouraged by the first Halloween season’s sales at BuyCostumes.com, Getz and Maj-
doch quickly began looking for financing in order to expand and market their
BuyCostumes.com e-business. Playing matchmaker, one of their bankers arranged an
introduction to Jeffrey Rusinow, a top retail executive at the Fortune 500 Kohl’s store
chain. Rusinow, who was getting ready to take an early retirement from Kohl’s, was on
the lookout for a new investment and a new challenge.4 Was this a match made in retail

Affiliate marketing is a revenue-sharing approach to marketing that involves paying other
e-businesses to promote your e-business Web site and the products and services you
offer. In Chapter 6, you learned that you can use traditional advertising, public relations,
search engine optimization, online advertising, and other online marketing tools—such as
operating an affiliate program—to help draw customers to your e-business’s Web site. Now
consider the flip side of this marketing coin. Suppose your e-business publishes a Web site
that sells products or services to a niche market, or publishes a Web site that provides free
Web page content (content that informs or entertains, such as a newsletter or blog). You
may be able to increase revenues from your Web site or generate revenues through your
newsletter or blog by participating in another e-business’s affiliate marketing program.
An affiliate marketing program is sometimes called an affiliate program, but also may
be referred to as a pay-for-performance program or an associate program. An affili-
ate program is a marketing tool for the e-business that operates it, called the merchant or
advertiser, and a source of revenue for the e-business that participates in it, called an
affiliate or associate or publisher.5 A successful affiliate Web site typically offers viewers
information, entertainment, products, or services that complement the products and ser-
vices offered at the merchant site. Affiliate sites are linked to the merchant site via custom-
ized links; when a visitor at an affiliate site clicks through to the merchant’s site via these
links, the affiliate typically earns a fee or commission. Three basic types of affiliate pro-
grams are: 6, 7
●
pay-per-click or cost-per-click affiliate programs: The merchant pays the
affiliate a set fee each time a visitor clicks through to the merchant’s site,
whether or not the visitor takes any action at the site.
●
pay-per-lead or cost-per-lead affiliate programs: The merchant pays the
affiliate a set fee for each visitor who clicks through and takes an action at the
merchant’s site, such as completing an online survey, registering at the site,
or opting-in to receive e-mail.
●
pay-per-sale or cost-per-sale affiliate programs: The merchant pays the
affiliate a percentage of the sale when a visitor clicks through to the mer-
chant’s site and makes a purchase. Some pay-per-sale programs have a residual
component that enables the affiliate to continue to earn commissions on sub-
sequent sales to the same visitor.
Figure 7-1 illustrates the pay-per-sale affiliate program process.

E-business affiliate programs first appeared in the mid-1990s. While there is some
debate about whether it was the first on the scene, there is no argument that the most high-
profile and successful affiliate program to appear during this time was the Amazon.com
Associates program.8, 9 Launched in July, 1996—a scant 12 months after Amazon.com
opened its virtual doors for business—the Amazon.com Associates program began enroll-
ing dozens of affiliate Web sites per day. Today, the Amazon.com Associates program boasts
thousands of members around the world.10 Many other well-known merchants, such as
Dell, Best Buy, and Barnes&Noble, also operate affiliate programs that serve as effective tools
for marketing their products and services. Some merchants even operate multiple affili-
ate programs. For example, Overstock.com operates a Shopping Affiliates program for B2C
online stores and an Auction Affiliates program for C2C auction sites. Figures 7-2 through
7-4 illustrate the affiliate program pages of several online merchants.

Another type of affiliate program is a multi-tier program in which in addition to earning pay-per-click, pay-
per-lead, or pay-per-sale fees for consumer click-throughs, affiliates earn referral fees for putting the mer-
chant in contact with other affiliates.

Rackspace Managed Hosting
Rackspace Managed Hosting uses four different types of referral programs to attract
potential customers: Referral Partners, Solution Partners, Development Partners,
and the Rackspace Affiliate Program.
●
Referral Partners: This program comprises anyone who refers a customer to
Rackspace and receives a commission or referral fee. Referral partners are gen-
erally existing customers or customers’ employees.
●
Solutions Partners:This program includes media agencies, Web developers, con-
sultants, application service providers, and other professionals that refer their cli-
ents to Rackspace and receive commissions or referral fees.To help promote the
services it offers, Rackspace may provide training and information about the
Rackspace sales philosophy to the sales staffs of its Solution Partners. Solution
Partners may earn a one-time fees or recurring commissions for a referral.
●
Development Partners: These are professional companies, such as accounting
or consulting firms, that refer their clients to Rackspace but do not accept com-
missions or fees for themselves in order to maintain their objectivity. Develop-
ment Partners may sometimes pass commissions or fees on to their clients as
discounts.

Rackspace Affiliate Program: This program allows other businesses to place
links to the Rackspace Managed Hosting Web site at their own Web sites and
earn up to 50 percent of the first month’s Web hosting fee whenever a visitor to
their site clicks through to the Rackspace site and purchases Web hosting
services.11, 12, 13, 14
A referral from a Referral Partner can be a one-time event. The referrals from
Solution Partners and Development Partners, however, are recurring, and thus Rack-
space maintains close, ongoing relationships with both its Solution and Develop-
ment Partners. Lastly, Rackspace uses its affiliate program as an extension of its
overall advertising program.15
Affiliate Programs as a Marketing Tool
E-business affiliate programs are electronic versions of the traditional sales referral
programs used by many different types of brick-and-mortar businesses. Affiliate programs
leverage other Web sites to drive potential customers to a merchant’s Web site where, it is
hoped, they will purchase the merchant’s products and services. The two major advan-
tages an affiliate program offers to an e-business merchant are (1) the merchant is able to
measure marketing efforts by tying those efforts directly to a lead or a sale, and (2) the mer-
chant pays only for results. In contrast, an e-business that uses traditional advertising must
not only pay up front for the print, radio, or TV ads it uses, but once these ads have cir-
culated, it may be difficult for the business to gauge how effective they were—that is, to tie
the ads directly to actions taken by customers. If your e-business uses an affiliate pro-
gram to market its products and services, you can track the effectiveness of the program
directly and pay each affiliate only when your program gets results in the form of a cus-
tomer click-through, lead, or purchase.
A survey by Shop.org and Forrester Research of 150 e-retailers found that 50 percent
of the e-retailers surveyed used affiliate marketing programs. Moreover, Forrester
Research estimates that the affiliate market accounts for roughly 15 to 20 percent of the
estimated $72 billion online market.16 Companies as varied as Apple Computer (iTunes),
Avon (cosmetics), Oakley (sunglasses), USA Today (newspaper publishing), and eBay
(online auctions) market their businesses through affiliate programs. In fact, using affili-
ates is Avon’s fastest growing customer acquisition method.17

One approach to operating a successful affiliate marketing program is to acquire a huge
and diverse affiliate membership. For example, the Amazon.com Associates program has over
1 million members, as diverse as RVPart.com (parts for recreational vehicles), Dilbert.com
(cartoons and entertainment), Books for Managers (business book reviews and top ten lists),
and HarperCollins.com (book publishing). What are the complementary relationships with
Amazon.com that makes these four different businesses good candidates for the Amazon.com
Associates program?
●
RVPart.com sells plumbing, lighting, heating, towing, and other parts and
accessories for recreational vehicles (RVs) and motor homes. In addition,
RVPart.com uses the Amazon.com Associates program graphic and text links
to promote travel books of interest to “RVers.” RVPart.com customers who
might not go directly to the Amazon.com site to search for a travel book—such
as a popular and up-to-date campground directory—can click through from
the RVPart.com site to the Amazon.com site and purchase one.
●
Dilbert.com is the official site for Scott Adams’ popular Dilbert comic strip, which
is syndicated in 2,000 newspapers and 65 countries around the world.18 Visitors
at Dilbert.com can view cartoons, play games, send electronic greeting cards, and
buy merchandise featuring Dilbert and other characters from the comic strip.
Adams has also written 22 books featuring Dilbert and other characters from the
comic strip. Visitors who come to the Dilbert.com Web site looking for entertain-
ment can click through to Amazon.com to purchase one of Adams’ books.
●
Books for Managers compiles information on the latest business books and publi-
cations and makes it available at a central location—the Books for Managers’ Web
site. The information includes lists of the current top-selling business-related
books provided by BusinessWeek, The New York Times, the Wall Street Jour-
nal, USA Today, and other publications. The Books for Managers e-business
doesn’t sell business books and publications—instead, it offers free information
about them and generates its revenues by participating in several different
affiliate programs. A busy business professional can visit the Books for Managers
site, review its lists of top-selling business books, and then click through to
Amazon.com to buy a book, or click through to a newspaper or magazine site to
subscribe to a publication (both of these customer actions generate revenue for
Books for Managers).
●
HarperCollins uses its Web site to promote its authors and their books. How-
ever, like many book publishers, HarperCollins sells its books through book-
stores and not directly to the public. A visitor at the HarperCollins site who
reads about a book and wants to purchase a copy must do so through a brick-
and-mortar or online book store. Membership in the Amazon.com Associates
program allows HarperCollins to sell its books indirectly by offering visitors
a link to the Amazon.com site.
In each of these four examples, everyone wins—the merchant (Amazon.com) cost-
effectively markets its online bookstore to a diverse marketplace; the affiliates (RVPart.com,
Dilbert.com, Books for Managers, and HarperCollins) earn a commission on each click-
through sale; and a visitor to the affiliate site can quickly find books specifically geared toward
his or her interests.

A second approach a merchant can take to operating a successful affiliate program is to
focus on acquiring a smaller number of highly effective affiliates that have a high volume of Web
site traffic and offer Web page content, products, and services that are directly related to the
merchant’s products and services. For example, an e-business that sells designer luggage might
target high volume sites that sell travel services for its niche affiliate marketing program.
E - P I O N E E R S
Growing a Business
In the late 1970s, Jim McCann was an administrator at St. John’s Home for Boys in
Rockaway, NewYork, when he learned from a friend about a small Manhattan flower
shop named Flora Plenty that was for sale. An entrepreneur at heart, McCann
explored the idea of running a floral shop by working at Flora Plenty on weekends.
It wasn’t long before he found that he enjoyed being a florist, and decided to pur-
chase the shop. Unable to give up his “day job” right away, however, McCann hired
someone to run the shop for him.19
By 1986, McCann had grown his floral business from one shop to a chain of 14
shops around the Manhattan area—and he realized he was ready to give up his “day
job” to run his floral business full time. It was about this time that McCann, always on
the look out for new opportunities, heard about a failing floral business in Texas that
had been attempting to use the new 1-800 toll-free telephone number system to
sell its flowers and gifts. In 1986, many people were still unfamiliar with using the 1-800
toll-free numbers; but McCann understood how the new telephone technology could
be a boost to the floral business and took a chance. He bought the failing com-
pany and its phone number, 1-800-FLOWERS.Then McCann renamed his floral chain
1-800-FLOWERS and began the long process of educating consumers, via tradi-
tional advertising media, about the convenience of ordering flowers anytime during the
day or night using the 1-800-FLOWERS toll-free number. McCann and his manage-
ment team also worked on building the 1-800-FLOWERS brand and increasing
customer loyalty by focusing on customer satisfaction during each sale and by
offering special benefits to repeat customers.20
As you might expect, McCann became intrigued, a few years later, with the pos-
sibilities of using another new technology—the Internet—to create an additional
sales channel for his company’s flowers and gifts. Convinced that the Internet was
going to change retailing forever, McCann created an online presence for 1-800-
FLOWERS on CompuServe’s Electronic Mall in 1992, long before many consumers
knew about the Internet. By 1995, 1-800-FLOWERS was operating its own
e-business Web site and using online tools to market its flowers and gifts.21, 22 Over
the next several years, McCann and his management team continued to grow the
business by opening new stores (both company-owned and franchised), adding new
products (gifts, gourmet food, candies), and developing a strong nationally-
recognized and successful affiliate program.

How successful have Jim McCann and his team been in mixing sales channels
(brick-and-mortar stores, call centers, and the Web) and marketing tools (such as
traditional advertising and affiliate programs) to build the 1-800-FLOWERS brand? In
1999, 1-800-FLOWERS became 1-800-FLOWERS.COM and launched a success-
ful IPO (NASDAQ:FLWS); by 2004, the company had annual sales of $604 million, net
profits of $41 million, and 2,500 employees.23 Today, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM has
more than 12,000 affiliates building their own businesses by earning up to 10 per-
cent commission on the flowers, plants, gift baskets, food, collectibles, and other
items their Web site visitors purchase by clicking through to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM
(Figure 7-5).24 As of this writing, McCann and his team are expanding their inter-
nal network of company-owned and franchised stores, called BloomNet, to create a
Web-based “florist transmission service” to compete head on with the granddaddy
of floral wire services, FTD.25

An e-business merchant can make sure that its affiliate program stands out from those
of its competitors and that it more effectively generates traffic, leads, and revenues by fol-
lowing a few simple guidelines when dealing with affiliate partners.
●
Treat affiliates like important long-term business partners and cultivate long-
term relationships with them by offering products and services, customer sup-
port, and other customer benefits to the customers they refer in order to foster
repeat business for them and for yourself.
●
Respond to affiliates’ inquiries within 24 hours. The speed of a merchant’s
response to an inquiry is a good indicator of the importance the merchant
places on its affiliates. Failing to respond quickly to affiliates’ e-mail mes-
sages may cause your affiliates to look for more responsive affiliate
programs.
●
Share important statistics, such as your e-business’s average affiliate conver-
sion rate (click-throughs converted to sales), sales figures, and earnings per
click-through, with potential affiliates to give them an idea of the revenue they
can earn. Other statistics that affiliates might find useful are the monthly
earnings of top affiliates and the products or services that have the highest con-
version rate (ratio of visitors to purchasers).
In a typical affiliate program, a small percentage of affiliates generate the majority of
the traffic and sales for a merchant.26 Sometimes called super affiliates, the members of
this small group are often offered extra benefits, such as custom reporting, prioritized
responses to their inquiries, and additional marketing support, to ensure that they remain
active participants in the program.
Affiliate Programs as a Revenue Source
While affiliate programs serve as a marketing tool for some e-businesses, they represent an
income opportunity for other types of organizations—particularly for e-businesses that sell
products and services to a niche market, for Web sites that offer information or enter-
tainment content but do not sell products or services, and for newsletter and blog
publishers. Affiliate programs also offer an income opportunity for entrepreneurs who don’t
want to worry about the logistics of selling and shipping products, managing services sales,
and providing customer support. In fact, some entrepreneurs use affiliate programs as
their sole Web site revenue source. An example of this type of e-business is the Books for
Managers site you learned about earlier in the chapter.
Participating in an affiliate program and then getting the most out of your participa-
tion involves:
●
selecting the appropriate merchant and affiliate program for your e-business
●
understanding the terms of the affiliate agreement
●
adding affiliate program links to your Web pages
●
building traffic at your Web site
Chapter 7
264

Selecting an Affiliate Program
Your first step in selecting an affiliate program is to look for programs that are a good fit
for your e-business. Remember that visitors at your site generate your affiliate income; it
is critical, therefore, that the affiliate programs in which your e-business participates offer
products and services of interest to your customers or to people who are likely to visit your
site.27 For example, suppose your e-business sells needlework patterns and supplies. Par-
ticipating in the Amazon.com Associates program or the Barnes&Noble AffiliateNetwork
would be a good choice because there is a clear overlap between your Web site’s content
and these merchant’s products—namely, books on needlework. Participating in the
PartsAmerica.com Affiliate Program, however, would probably not be a great match up for
your e-business because your site visitors and customers are not likely to be thinking about
purchasing auto parts when they visit your needlework site.
In addition to selecting affiliate programs that are a good fit with your e-business, you
should learn as much as you can about the programs in which you are interested and the
merchants who operate them. How long has the merchant been in business and what is the
merchant’s reputation in the marketplace? Does the program offer a fair and competi-
tive fee or commission structure? Are fees and commissions paid on time? Finding answers
to these questions can help you evaluate the effectiveness of individual affiliate programs.
You must also consider the fact that visitors who click through from your Web site
to a merchant site may evaluate your e-business based on their experiences at the mer-
chant site. Given this, it is a good idea to review the merchant’s site to look for quality prod-
ucts and services, competitive pricing, ease of shopping and buying, customer service and
product guarantees, clearly stated product return and privacy policies, and other ele-
ments that lead to satisfied customers.28
Once you have selected an affiliate program, the next step is to apply for membership.
Understanding the Affiliate Agreement
The online application form for membership in an affiliate program typically asks for
account information such payee name, address, phone number, contact name, and tax ID
number. You will also likely be asked to provide a description or profile of your Web site,
its name and URL, the number of people in your organization; relate how you plan to gen-
erate referrals from your site; and indicate which of the merchant’s products or services
best fit the visitors to your Web site.
You will also be required to acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions of the
program’s affiliate agreement. The affiliate agreement, created by the merchant and
agreed to by the affiliate, defines all aspects of the affiliate program and typically includes:
●
types of Web sites the merchant will accept into the affiliate program
●
types of links allowed and guidelines regarding their use
●
schedule of referral fees and commissions
●
payment terms for referral fees and commissions
●
terms on usage of the merchant’s name, logos, and Web site content
●
technical specifications that your Web site must meet, if any
●
restrictions on types of content that may appear on affiliate sites
●
requirements for compliance with all government laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations
Taking Advantage of Affiliate Marketing
265

●
limit of the merchant’s liability and other legal disclaimers
●
membership termination requirements
●
statement regarding the methods to be used to resolve disputes between the
merchant and the affiliate
Referral fees and commissions can be structured in many different ways. For example,
most affiliate agreements specify the length of time from the initial click-through to the com-
pleted purchase during which the affiliate will get credit for the purchase—this could range
from 10 days to 30 days. The affiliate agreement may also specify whether or not the affiliate
gets paid residual referral fees or commissions for a referred customer’s ongoing purchases,
such as when the customer signs up for a service with a recurring monthly service fee.
The affiliate agreement also spells out how often and when the merchant pays the affili-
ate, any minimum payout requirements, and the payment method. Some merchants pay
their affiliates on a monthly or quarterly basis; sometimes the amount of the referral fees or
commissions earned determines the payment period. The merchant usually makes pay-
ments by check, direct deposit, or credit towards purchases made at the merchant’s site.
Many merchants post their affiliate agreements and the answers to frequently asked
questions about them on their Web sites.
Adding Affiliate Program Links
After you submit an application to join an affiliate program, the merchant reviews your
application for approval. If your application is accepted, the merchant then provides you
with the following:
●
a unique affiliate identification code or ID that is used to track your referral
traffic
●
instructions on how to properly link to the merchant site
●
access to the merchant’s databases of special affiliate banners, logos, product
images, text and graphic links, search text boxes, and Web page content that
can be downloaded and used on your site
Some affiliate programs, such as that of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, offer dynamic link-
ing, which means that when the merchant modifies graphic links or content in its data-
bases, the changes automatically appear in the links or content on affiliates’ sites.
Building Traffic at Your Site
Your success in generating revenue through affiliate program participation will obviously
depend on your ability to attract visitors to your Web site and then to direct that traffic to your
merchant’s site. To generate interest in your Web site and draw visitors, you may use many
of the marketing tools described in Chapter 6. Before you do this, however, you should
carefully review any affiliate agreements you’ve signed to determine what restrictions, if any,
are placed on the types of marketing tools you may use to attract site visitors. For example,
T I P
As with any legal agreement, it is a good idea to have your attorney review the terms of an affiliate agree-
ment before you agree to participate in the program.
Chapter 7
266

to avoid spam, an affiliate agreement may restrict the use of e-mail advertising that con-
tains the merchant’s name, logo, or a link to the merchant’s site. Press releases announcing
your participation in the affiliate program may also be prohibited.29, 30
Whether you operate an affiliate program or participate in one, it is important for you
to become familiar with the multiple methods that are used to track click-throughs from
affiliate sites to merchant sites.
A F F I L I A T E
T R A C K I N G
S Y S T E M S
An affiliate tracking system allows a merchant to control how it credits its affiliates for
click-throughs, whether per click, lead, or sale. Tracking systems can also monitor the win-
dow of time in which an affiliate gets credit for an action at the merchant site; whether sub-
affiliates (multi-tier affiliates) are allowed to participate; and whether the affiliate gets
credit for additional purchases made by the visitor after the first purchase is made. An affili-
ate tracking system also records and stores affiliate information, and provides commis-
sion or fee reports. Figure 7-6 illustrates the affiliate tracking process.
FIGURE 7-6

While some merchants, such as Amazon.com, manage their own programs, handling
all of the details of an affiliate program can be expensive and time-consuming. Thousands of
merchants, such as Best Buy and Rackspace Managed Hosting, contract the management
of their affiliate programs to a special type of e-business known as an affiliate manage-
ment network.
Affiliate Management Networks
An affiliate management network is a third-party entity that recruits affiliates, manages
the registration process, tracks and properly credits all of the referral fees and commis-
sions, and arranges for payment. In return for these services, the affiliate management net-
work collects from the merchant a percentage of each referral transaction’s fee or
commission—perhaps as much as 30 percent.31 Figure 7-7 shows the relationship between
the merchants and affiliates who participate in an affiliate management network.

Affiliate Tracking Technologies
For an affiliate program to operate effectively, each click-through must be tracked so that
information about the source of the click-through can be passed on to the merchant and
so that the affiliate can be credited for any action the customer takes. The tracking infor-
mation that identifies the affiliate is included in links (URLs) the merchant provides to the
affiliate for the affiliate’s Web site. If the merchant is part of an affiliate management net-
work, these URLs contain information that identifies both the affiliate and the destina-
tion merchant site. This information is either passed directly to the merchant’s server or to
the affiliate management network server, which instantly records the source of the click-
through and directs the visitor to the correct merchant Web page.32 For example, the
Amazon.com Associate program uses information coded in the URL to flag the originat-
ing affiliate of the click-through. Figure 7-10 depicts a link from an Amazon.com associ-
ate, Books for Managers, to the Amazon.com Web page for a book titled Business
Planning for the Entrepreneur.
The first part of the URL, “http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0324220979/”
links to the Web page at the Amazon.com site for the book Business Planning for the
Entrepreneur. The last part of the URL, “booksformanag-20”, is the affiliate code for
Books for Managers. When a visitor clicks through to Amazon.com using this link and makes
a purchase, Amazon.com pays the Books for Managers associate a commission for refer-
ring the sale.
LinkShare, the affiliate management network, also uses information encoded in links
to identify the originating affiliate as well as the merchant and destination Web page. Fig-
ure 7-11 depicts a link from the Books for Managers site to the LinkShare merchant cli-
ent OfficeMax.
The first part of the URL, “http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click” is the LinkShare server
address; the second part, “?id=4z3CHHjtAoo” identifies Books for Managers as the affiliate;
FIGURE 7-9
LinkShare
Chapter 7
270

and the ending “&offerid=32481.10000181&type=4&subid=0” identifies OfficeMax as the
merchant and directs the visitor to an OfficeMax page.
A merchant that participates in an affiliate management network can rely on the net-
work’s technologies to collect and track click-through information. A merchant that man-
ages its own affiliate program must use some type of affiliate tracking technology. Some Web
hosting companies provide this for their e-business clients, and some e-business soft-
ware packages include tracking technologies.
Two other methods of acquiring tracking technologies are by installing third-party
tracking software or by using an affiliate tracking service provided by an application ser-
vice provider (ASP). The affiliate tracking technology from a third-party or an ASP does
more than just track the click-throughs from the affiliate site to the merchant site. It also
generates a cookie—a small text file that you learned about in Chapter 6—and stores the
cookie on the visitor’s computer. While the cookie does not contain any personal informa-
tion about the visitor, the cookie’s ID text can be used to identify a specific click-
through as a single unique visitor, even if the user clicks more than once on the affiliate
FIGURE 7-10

links.33 If the visitor blocks cookies or deletes them, the affiliate tracking software uses other
tracking methods to track the click-through, such as embedding JavaScript instructions in
a URL.

Affiliate marketing is not without certain risks and challenges, primarily from unethical
affiliates and the negative perceptions online consumers have about tracking technologies.
Despite spelling out restrictions in an affiliate agreement, merchants still find it difficult to
control the actions of any unethical affiliate determined to use methods such as cookie
stuffing, parasiteware, and spam in order to get credit for unearned sales or to drive up Web
site traffic. In addition, many online consumers are concerned about how tracking tech-
nologies might invade their privacy.
Cookie Stuffing and Parasiteware
Cookie stuffing is when an unethical affiliate places multiple cookies containing its com-
mission codes on an unsuspecting visitor’s computer during a single visit to the affili-
ate’s site. These cookies, which can sometimes number in the hundreds, represent multiple
merchant programs in which the affiliate participates. When the visitor directly accesses
one of these merchants’ sites and makes purchases, the cookies force the merchant’s track-
ing software to assume the visitor clicked through from the affiliate’s site (rather than
directly), and the affiliate gets credit for the visitor’s action.34
Spyware is a general term used to describe software that has been installed on a per-
sonal computer without the owner’s permission. Users sometimes unknowingly down-
load and install spyware when they download legitimate software such as games,
screensavers, freeware utilities, and so forth. Once installed, spyware can then be used
to gather personal information, track a user’s online behavior, serve up ads, and perform
other more malicious activities such as logging user keystrokes. Parasiteware is a kind of
spyware that redirects affiliate links on a user’s computer or replaces the content of the
user’s existing affiliate-tracking cookies. Some unethical affiliates use parasiteware to redi-
rect traffic from the Web sites of other affiliates to their own Web site, or to hijack track-
ing cookies by replacing the commission codes of competing affiliates with their own
commission codes—in other words, literally stealing the commissions of other affiliates.35
The affiliate agreements for some merchants, such as Oreck (vacuum cleaners), now
expressly prohibit the use of parasiteware by their affiliates.36
Spammers
Because the merchant has little control over what their affiliates do—the only recourse
being to remove them from the affiliate program—there is a constant risk of an affiliate con-
ducting itself in a manner that reflects poorly on the merchant or that even poses a poten-
tial legal risk to the merchant. One example is the use of unsolicited e-mail advertising
or spam. Spam is a scourge both to consumers, who deplore it, and to legitimate market-
ers, who don’t want their messages to get lost or ignored. Merchants also realize that spam
generates a negative impression of their organizations in the minds of most consumers.
Chapter 7
272

Unfortunately, some unethical, criminal, or simply naive affiliates continue to use spam.
There are even reports that international criminals have combined e-mail addresses ille-
gally harvested from Web sites with legitimate affiliate management network accounts to
send affiliate marketing spam and generate income.37, 38
Merchants who operate an affiliate program should be aware that sending spam is not
only unethical, it is now illegal. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 holds the merchant respon-
sible for spam sent by its affiliates if the merchant should have known about the spam or
failed to take reasonable precautions to monitor its affiliates, actions.39, 40, 41 Therefore,
most affiliate agreements now expressly prohibit the use of spam to generate Web site traffic.
Q U O T E S

S U C C E S S
“Our cases [Federal Trade Commission (FTC) actions against spammers] are sent with a
message for companies to understand they are potentially liable if their affiliates vio-
late the law. Certainly we are paying the most attention to entities causing the most injury,
but quote-unquote legitimate marketers are not immune to FTC action if they are violat-
ing CAN-SPAM.”
Steven Wernikoff, staff attorney for the FTC
For merchants, the best defense against abuses like cookie stuffing, parasiteware, and
illegal affiliate spam is to monitor their affiliates’ actions as carefully as possible and stay
on the lookout for customer complaints and evidence of affiliate misbehavior.
Blocking Software
One of the biggest challenges facing merchants and affiliates is the use by consumers of
software that blocks tracking cookies. Many consumers do not understand how tracking
cookies work and equate them with spyware, viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and other
destructive software, sometimes called malware. According to a study by JupiterResearch,
38 percent of Web site viewers think cookies are an invasion of their privacy, and 44 per-
cent believe they are protected by blocking or deleting cookies.42
Most cookies, like affiliate tracking cookies, are benign, and are used to store informa-
tion such as Web site passwords, viewing preferences, and click-through identification.
However, the software that detects, eliminates, and blocks malware frequently does the
same to benign cookies. This can prevent a merchant or affiliate management network
from properly tracking click-throughs.43 According to the same JupiterResearch study, 58
percent of Web site visitors have deleted cookies from their computers and 39 percent
delete cookies on a regular basis. These Web site visitors are most certainly deleting affili-
ate tracking cookies. Blocking or deleting affiliate tracking cookies severely compro-
mises the accuracy of affiliate commission and referral fee reporting based on tracking
cookies.44 Merchants can begin to tackle this problem by educating online users about
the usefulness of benign tracking cookies—and by using more than one type of tracking
technology in their affiliate marketing programs. Indeed, educating site visitors about cook-
ies and encouraging site visitors to read posted privacy policies might benefit both mer-
chants and affiliates.

The match between Jeffrey Rusinow, the retiring retailing executive, and Getz and Maj-
doch, the young entrepreneurs who started BuyCostumes.com, appears to have been a
good one. Rusinow liked the idea of becoming an entrepreneur and Getz and Majdoch
were happy to attract an investor and business partner with Rusinow’s experience and tal-
ent to their young company. Once on board, Rusinow immediately began a program to
find additional financing and to scale down operating costs. Under Rusinow’s guidance, the
business was able to raise a little more than $1 million in equity investment from 24 angel
investors, and then split into two entities: BUYSEASONS, INC., the e-business portion
of the business to be run by Getz, and GMI Inc., the brick-and-mortar stores to be run by
Majdoch. As part of his cost-cutting program, Rusinow scrapped an original plan to spend
$2.6 million for a traditional advertising campaign and replaced it with a public rela-
tions effort that was managed in-house, a portal advertising deal with MSN, e-mail promo-
tions and catalogs sent to existing customers, and affiliate marketing.
This successful marketing tool mix allowed BuyCostumes.com to survive the dot.
com bust, and by mid-summer 2001, BUYSEASONS, INC. and its BuyCostumes.com Web
site were approaching profitability. In fact, BuyCostumes.com was heading toward becom-
ing the largest costume e-business on the Web.45 By 2003, BuyCostumes.com had sales
of more than $10 million, and its affiliates were credited with driving 20−30 percent of
these sales.46, 47
Today, BUYSEASONS, INC. operates two e-business sites—Deal.com and
BuyCostumes.com (Figure 7-12). Both have affiliate programs managed by Commission
Junction.

Chapter Summary
●
Affiliate marketing is a revenue-sharing approach to promoting an e-business’s prod-
ucts and services.
●
An affiliate program is a marketing tool for the merchant who operates it and a source
of revenue for the affiliate who participates in it.
●
The advantages to a merchant of operating an affiliate program include the ability to mea-
sure marketing efforts and the benefit of paying only for results.
●
The advantages to participating in an affiliate program include increasing site revenue
for an affiliate e-retailer, or generating revenue for sites that offer information or enter-
tainment or for sites that feature an e-mail newsletter or a blog.
●
In a pay-per-click or cost-per-click affiliate program, the merchant pays the affiliate a set
fee each time a visitor clicks through to the merchant’s site whether or not the visitor takes
any action at the site.
●
In a pay-per-lead or cost-per-lead affiliate program, the merchant pays the affiliate a set
fee for each visitor who clicks through and takes an action at the merchant’s site, such
as completing an online survey, registering at the site, or opting-in to receive e-mail.
●
In a pay-per-sale or cost-per-sale affiliate program, the merchant pays the affiliate a per-
centage of the sale when a visitor clicks through to the merchant’s site and makes a
purchase.Some pay-per-sale programs have a residual component that enables the affili-
ate to continue to earn commissions on subsequent sales to the same visitor.
●
Merchants who operate an affiliate program should treat affiliates as long-term busi-
ness partners, be responsive to affiliate and potential affiliate inquiries, share important
statistics with potential affiliates, and provide extra benefits to super affiliates.
●
To participate in an affiliate program, an e-business should first carefully select the appro-
priate merchant(s) and program(s), fully understand the terms of the affiliate agree-
ment(s) it is required to sign, update its Web site with merchant links and other content,
and focus on drawing traffic to its site.
●
For an affiliate e-business, selecting an affiliate program(s) that fits well with its prod-
ucts and/or services—or, in the case of information- or entertainment-based sites, with
the content of its site, newsletter, or blog—is critical to successful participation.
●
An affiliate agreement defines all aspects of the affiliate program and the relationship
between the merchant and affiliate.
●
Specially coded URLs and tracking cookies are used to track click-throughs from an affili-
ate site to a merchant site.
●
An affiliate management network is a third-party e-business that recruits affiliates, man-
ages the registration process, tracks and properly credits all of the referral fees and com-
missions, and arranges for payment.
●
The risks and challenges of operating and participating in an affiliate program
primarily originate from the activities of unethical affiliates (such as cookie stuffing,
parasiteware, and spamming) and negative user perceptions about how cookies repre-
sent threats to their privacy (which lead to the use of software that blocks or deletes
tracking cookies).

Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. is a large international law firm with more than 900 attor-
neys in 11 worldwide offices, including its primary office in Houston, Texas. In the mid-
1990s, Fulbright & Jaworski launched its first Web site, which consisted of little more
than a page of contact information for its various offices.1 Over the next several years, the
Fulbright & Jaworski Web site continued to evolve, adjusting to changes in both Web-
related technologies and the expectations of Web site visitors, who were increasingly more
experienced at using the Web. For example, the Web site began to incorporate graphics
on its home page, and grew to include additional pages containing information about the
areas of legal practice in which Fulbright & Jaworski specialized, attorney biographies,
and current legal news and events.2 By 2003, more and more Internet-savvy individuals,
corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies were turning to the Web
to connect with law firms that could provide the legal services they needed.3 Was the Ful-
bright & Jaworski Web site up to the challenge of competing in this new environment in
which a firm’s Web site had become a key means of attracting clients?

Whether your e-business Web site and its pages are created from scratch by someone in your
business, or by a Web design and development service provider that you’ve hired as a con-
tractor, you must make important decisions about how your site is organized, what pages to
include, and how the pages should look and function. Making good decisions about your Web
site’s organization and page design begins with creating a plan.

In Chapters 3 and 6 you learned about business planning processes that involved defin-
ing your e-business’s overall purpose, setting specific business goals, planning ways to mar-
ket your e-business, and budgeting for each of these processes. Designing your e-business
Web site involves a similar planning process. Before you begin to design your Web site, you
must first identify the business objectives for the site, and then define its target audi-
ences and how these audiences will use the site.
Web Site Business Objectives
Your e-business is likely to have a number of business objectives for its Web site. The pri-
mary objective for your site is to create profits, which it can do by helping build your
e-business’s image and brand, generate sales and revenues, reduce expenses, grow your cus-
tomer base, and increase sales to repeat customers.4 Although the particulars vary from
e-business to e-business, your Web site’s other business objectives may involve:
●
educating consumers about your products and services
●
providing technical support for your products and services
●
providing customer support after the sale
●
collecting information about current and potential customers
●
offering a virtual community where consumers can interact with each other
●
directing consumers to other useful Web sites
●
recruiting talented employees
While these objectives may not focus directly on creating profits, they can contribute
indirectly to your profitability. Therefore, identifying your Web site’s many business objec-
tives is an important first step in the Web design process. To do this, you might ask your-
self questions such as:
●
Is there anything about my e-business’s products or services that customers
may find unfamiliar or unusual?
●
Do my customers need technical support to work with my e-business prod-
ucts or services?
●
Do my customers expect support after they purchase one of my products or
services?
●
What features do my competitors offer at their Web sites?
●
How will it help my bottom line if I solicit or collect information from my
customers?
After you determine the business objectives for your site, the next critical steps are to
identify your site’s target audiences, determine why these audiences might want to visit
your site, and identify any technological constraints they might experience when viewing
your site.
Web Site Audiences
Before you begin designing your Web site (and its pages),you must gain a clear understand-
ing of who will visit your site, what these visitors will want or need to accomplish at your site,
and how they will do it. The primary audience for an e-business’s Web site is its customers and
potential customers. If you created a marketing plan as described in Chapter 6, then you can
use the section in which you defined your target market to identify who these customers
are and what they might expect to find at your Web site. The secondary audiences for your
Chapter 8
284

e-business’s Web site may include any or all of the following: your vendors, strategic part-
ners, investors, other stakeholders, and the general public.
After defining the audiences for your site, you should next consider why anyone from
these audiences would want or need to visit your site. Remember that visitors to your site
are not interested in helping you build your brand, reduce your expenses, or improve your
e-business’s bottom line—those are your business objectives. What will bring visitors to
your site is the opportunity to satisfy their wants and needs—for example, their desire to
gather information or make a purchase.5 It is important, therefore, to focus your Web site
planning not just on how you want the site to look and function, but also on how the site’s
organization and page design will enable visitors to fulfill their wants and needs. In short,
your Web site must allow customers to find the information they need quickly and to
make purchases easily.

“Nobody cares about you or your site. Really. What visitors care about is getting their prob-
lems solved.”
Vincent Flanders, author, consultant, lecturer, and Web design guru
When planning your Web site’s organization and its page design, you should take into
account the tools your site’s visitors will use to access your site and view its pages. For
example, you shouldn’t assume that all members of your target audiences are using the lat-
est version of their Web browsers, high-speed broadband Internet connections, and the
highest monitor resolution available. It would be wiser instead to plan and design for visi-
tors who might be working under the most common technological constraints. To do this,
you will need answers to the following questions.
●
Are your site’s visitors likely to comprise experienced Internet and Web users,
novice users, or a mix of both? Although millions of people use the Internet
and Web today, your site’s visitors may still include some novice users. One
way to assess this is to consider the products or services you offer. For example,
if your e-business sells technical products or services, your site visitors will
likely be experienced Internet and Web users who can handle a more sophis-
ticated level of Web site complexity. If your e-business sells products or ser-
vices to older adults, your site’s visitors may include computer novices who
would benefit more from a simpler Web site organization and page design.
●
Which browsers (and which versions of these browsers) will your site’s visi-
tors likely use: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, Opera, or some other
browser? As of this writing, the three most recent versions of the Internet
Explorer Web browser continue to be the most widely used browsers by far. But
other browsers, such as Firefox, are gaining in popularity.6 You should be aware
that Web pages designed specifically to be viewed in the most recent Internet
Explorer browser version may not look the same or function as well when viewed
in other browsers. To make certain your Web pages look and function properly
in different browsers, it is wise to test your Web pages with several of the most
popular browsers and most commonly used browser versions.

●
At what speed will your site’s visitors connect to the Internet: dial-up, high
speed dial-up, or broadband? A 2004 research report by Nielsen//NetRatings
indicates that almost 70 percent of e-retail purchases in November, 2004 were
transacted over a broadband connection.7 In 2005, there were more than 150
million broadband Internet subscribers worldwide, and this number is
expected to grow to more than 400 million by 2009.8 Although broadband
usage continues to grow at a rapid pace, you should consider whether adding
features that require a broadband connection for optimum viewing will cause
problems for those visitors to your site who are still using slower dial-up
connections.
●
At what screen resolution will your site’s visitors view your Web pages: 640
x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, or higher? While old computers with limited
video memory and smaller screens are still around, current estimates indi-
cate about 90 percent of today’s monitors are set for 800 x 600 or higher
resolution.9, 10 But creating fixed-width Web pages that view best at 800 x 600
resolution may result in extra margin space at higher resolutions or may
require horizontal scrolling at a lower resolution. Later in this chapter you
learn about an alternative to the fixed-width design that will help you cre-
ate a Web page suitable for multiple screen resolutions.
Once you have established your Web site’s business objectives and identified its tar-
get audiences, their expectations, and the most common technologies they will use to view
your Web pages, you are ready to organize the pages at your site.

O R G A N I Z A T I O N
Organizing your Web site’s pages in a way that visitors find logical and intuitive will help
your visitors navigate the site and accomplish their goals. Organizing a Web site does not
simply involve creating links between various Web pages. Instead, you should begin the
process of Web site organization by anticipating the information viewers might seek out
when they first visit your site, as well as the content they might be interested in explor-
ing in-depth. Once you’ve begun identifying this sort of information, you can start creat-
ing the Web pages that correspond to it and determine how these Web pages best fit together.
Figuring out how the information on your Web pages best fits together will, in large part,
determine the linking relationships between the Web pages—and thereby the organiza-
tion of your Web site. A good place to begin the process of Web site organization is to deter-
mine the pages you will include at your site.
Web Site Pages
Web sites are dynamic. What this means is that you can expect the number and type of pages
at your e-business Web site to evolve over time as your e-business accommodates changes
in your customers’ wants and needs, shifts in your business objectives for your site,
trends in the marketplace, and new technological developments. You should keep this in
mind as you establish the initial pages of your site. Initial pages include a primary page (usu-
ally called a home page) and the main secondary pages your visitors need.
Chapter 8
286

Home Page
Your site’s home page is often the first page your site’s visitors see. Because of this, the con-
tent of your home page must provide quick answers to these basic visitor questions.
●
Who are you?
●
What do you do?
●
Where can I find what I want or need?
●
Why should I be interested in your products and services?
Consequently, your home page should include information such as your e-business’s
name, business slogan, logo, or trademark; a description of your products or services; a brief
explanation of how your products or services can benefit the visitor, or a link to a page that
discusses these benefits; and easy-to-follow links to other pages at your site. The Rack-
space Managed Hosting home page, as shown in Figure 8-1, illustrates content that answers
these basic who? what? where? and why? questions.
As you can see in Figure 8-1, the company’s name and logo are highly visible in the
upper-left corner of the home page. A nicely formatted, descriptive headline and trade-
mark line is positioned near the top of the page to inform a visitor what Rackspace Man-
aged Hosting does. A row of links between the company name and logo and the descriptive
headline tell a visitor where to find additional information about what the company sells
(Hosting Solutions and Managed Services), the benefits provided by the company’s ser-
vices (Fanatical Support™), the technologies the company uses (Superstructure), and
company background and management (About Us).

Secondary Pages
The secondary pages at your site provide the visitor with more detailed information and fea-
tures that support your home page. The type and number of secondary pages will depend
on the types of products and services you sell and to whom, the business objectives for
your site, and your visitors’ wants and needs. Your secondary pages may include (but are
not limited to) the following pages.
●
A customer login page that allows customers to log in, if necessary, to view
other pages on the Web site.
●
Products or services pages that provide information about the individual prod-
ucts or services you sell and how visitors can purchase them.
●
A “shopping cart” page that lists items the visitor wishes to purchase plus any
related information the visitor needs in order to “check out” or pay for these
purchases and then track their delivery.
●
Shipping and return policy pages that describe shipping options and how your
e-business handles product returns.
●
Customer account information pages that allow your customers to review and
edit their billing address, shipping address, and other information.
●
Customer support pages that provide your customers with information about
the support you provide for the products or services you sell.
●
A contact information page that provides your mailing address, telephone and
fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.
●
“About Us” pages that provide additional company information, such as your
e-business’s history, professional biographies for the key members of your man-
agement team, and community outreach efforts.
●
Forms pages that use text boxes, option buttons, drop-down lists, and other fea-
tures to gather information from your viewers.
●
A privacy statement page that explains what visitor information you gather and
how you use it.
●
An acceptable use policy page that outlines the rules and restrictions visitors
must follow when using your Web site and its content.
●
Frequently asked questions (FAQ) pages that itemize and provide answers to
questions visitors or customers frequently ask about your company, its prod-
ucts and services, and Web site features.
●
An employment opportunity page that lists job openings at your e-business,
if any, and how potential employees can apply for them.
●
“What’s new?” pages that discuss new products or services, introduce new Web
site features, or discuss important changes taking place at your e-business.
●
Customer stories or case studies pages that illustrate how your current cus-
tomers have benefited from using your products and services.
●
Affiliate program pages that explain how your affiliate program works, present
your affiliate agreement, and outline how e-businesses can join your program.
●
Help pages that tell visitors how to navigate your site or use the special fea-
tures of your site.
After determining which secondary pages you should include at your site, you need to
think about how those pages should be organized to best benefit your site’s visitors.
Chapter 8

Web Site Structure
The organizational structures commonly used to build Web sites are a linear (or sequential)
structure, a non-linear (or webbed) structure, a pure hierarchical structure, and a mixed
hierarchical structure that combines a hierarchical structure with cross-referencing links
between pages as necessary.11, 12 The simplest organizational structure is the linear
structure, in which visitors view a series of pages in sequential order. Web pages with con-
tent that must be viewed in order—such as pages with online instructions that must be fol-
lowed in sequence, as shown in Figure 8-2—are organized in a linear structure. Visitors
start at Step 1, click a link to the next page in the sequence, Step 2, and so on until they
reach the last page. In contrast, a non-linear or webbed structure, shown in Figure 8-3,
allows pages to be linked to each other without regard to how the content of these pages
fits together logically. While this structure exploits the power of links to tie pages together,
it may be the most confusing structure for site visitors to attempt to navigate.13
FIGURE 8-2
Linear structure
FIGURE 8-3
Webbed structure
Designing Your Web Site
289

A hierarchical structure presents carefully organized information in different levels,
beginning with a top level (general information) followed by multiple levels of increas-
ingly more detailed information. You may already be familiar with other instances of infor-
mation organized in a hierarchical structure. One common example is a business’s
management team organization chart, such as the one depicted in the business plan in
Chapter 3. A hierarchical Web site structure allows for more complexity than a linear struc-
ture but is easier to understand and navigate than a webbed structure. A Web site that is
built in a pure hierarchical structure starts with the home page at the very top level of the
hierarchy. Additional pages are organized by topic or category below the home page in mul-
tiple levels; the deeper the level, the more detailed the page content.14 Figure 8-4 illus-
trates a Web site organized in a pure hierarchical structure with four levels, beginning with
the home page.
A pure hierarchical structure in which visitors can move from page to page only by pro-
ceeding down or up the hierarchy can be restrictive for Web sites with multiple related pages.
These sites use instead a mixed hierarchical structure that allows for cross-linked pages
within a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 8-5. Some studies indicate that visitors remember
more of the information at a site when they navigate a mixed hierarchical structure.15
FIGURE 8-4
Pure hierarchical structure
Chapter 8
290

Another issue to consider is how shallow or deep you should make your hierarchy of pages.
The number of levels will depend on the number of pages and the level of detail your Web site
needs to present its content. Some simple Web sites might feature a single level of separate and
unrelated pages to which visitors link directly from the home page, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Although it’s easy for visitors to navigate, a flat structure can be uninteresting.
FIGURE 8-5
Mixed hierarchical structure
FIGURE 8-6
Flat hierarchical structure
Designing Your Web Site
291

Other, more complex Web sites use a mixed hierarchical structure with a deeper hierar-
chy that features multiple layers of pages. A structure with too deep a hierarchy can also be
problematic in that it may require visitors to click through a frustratingly large number of
pages to make a purchase or find the information they need. One way to achieve some
balance—that is, to avoid creating a Web site structure that is either too flat or too deep—is
to include as much important information as possible in the first few levels of the hierarchy,
which, you’ll notice, amounts to creating a structure similar to Figure 8-5.
One rule of thumb, sometimes called the Three-Click Rule, suggests that visitors should
be able find useful information or make a purchase in no more than three clicks from the
home page. The reasoning behind the Three-Click Rule is that visitors are likely to get
frustrated and move on to another site if they can’t accomplish their goals at your site within
three or fewer clicks. The basic idea here—leading visitors to actionable content as quickly
as possible—is indeed useful. But more important than following an arbitrary rule about
adhering to a specific number of clicks is ensuring that the organization of the pages at your
Web site will make logical sense to visitors and be easy for them to navigate.16, 17
After determining which initial pages you need at your site and considering how those
pages might be organized, you should test your Web site’s organizational plan. For this, you
can borrow a common practice from the movie industry.
Web Site Storyboard
A good way to test your Web site’s organizational plan is to use a technique called
storyboarding. A storyboard is a blueprint for a design of a narrative, and is used in movie
and television production to show the copy, dialogue, and actions corresponding to vari-
ous important moments (or scenes) in the narrative. A storyboard generally consists of a
board or panel that displays a series of small drawings or sketches that roughly depicts a
sequence of actions.18 The storyboarding process can be used to good effect when testing
your site’s organization because it allows you to visualize the linking relationships
between pages.
To create a Web site storyboard, you begin by summarizing the planned content of each
Web page on an individual sticky note, index card, or sheet of paper, depending on the level
of detail you want to show for the page. Next, you group the notes, cards, or sheets by
major categories, such as products or services, customer accounts, or “About Us” topics.
Then you fasten these dummy Web pages onto a wall, whiteboard, or bulletin board, arrang-
ing them in a hierarchical order of importance beginning with the home page at the top of
the hierarchy. One important aspect of this hierarchy is that you must assemble the
pages according to the perspective of a Web site visitor, not your e-business’s priorities.
The second level of the hierarchy typically represents the major categories of informa-
tion at your site that a visitor would be interested in viewing. The remaining levels then
contain the pages that provide details for each major category. As you arrange the pages,
keep your visitors in mind and consider what they will want, need to know, and hope to
accomplish at each level in the hierarchy. After your dummy Web pages are arranged, draw
or create temporary lines from page to page to represent the linking relationships among
them. Once you’ve done this, you will see a visual representation of how a visitor might navi-
gate from page to page at your site.
Chapter 8
292

Storyboarding helps you identify potential navigation problems a visitor might experi-
ence, such as important pages that require too many clicks to access quickly. This tech-
nique can also help you identify other types of organizational problems, such as orphan
pages (pages that do not currently fit into the hierarchy) or missing pages (pages that you
discover you need to add). Figure 8-7 illustrates a Web site storyboard in progress.
You should reposition any orphan pages, add any missing pages, and continue to rear-
range your notes, cards, or sheets until you have a satisfactory organization that your visi-
tors can navigate easily. After you complete the storyboarding process, you should then
create a more formal chart of your Web site’s organizational plan using flowcharting soft-
ware or the drawing tools found in business productivity software, such as Microsoft Office.
With a formal Web site chart in hand, you are ready to plan the overall design of your
Web site’s pages. You should start by considering the general design issues that can make
your Web pages more (or less) useful and attractive to your visitors.

Good Web page design creates useful and attractive Web pages that support your
e-business’s Web site message rather than detracting from it. For example, if visitors to your
site are spending time thinking about how “cool” your pages are, they may be missing your
site’s primary message—buy our products or services! Over the past few years, the prac-
tices associated with Web page design have evolved to take advantage of advances in tech-
nology and keep up with the increased sophistication of the average Web page viewer.

293

Given this constant evolution, the upcoming sections focus on general design guidelines
that will be useful for you to consider as you plan your Web pages. Two important prin-
ciples of good Web page design are accessibility and usability.
Accessibility and Usability
Many people with disabilities are able to use computers with the help of special tools called
assistive technologies. Assistive computer technologies include voice recognition soft-
ware and screen reader software. Voice recognition software recognizes spoken com-
mands and text entries for users who, for example, cannot use a keyboard. Screen reader
software uses speech synthesizers to read aloud content on the computer screen for users
who are visually impaired. The principle of Web accessibility involves designing Web
pages so that Web resources are available to people with disabilities.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international group that oversees and
develops protocols and guidelines for the Web. Directed by the inventor of the World Wide
Web, Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C has been active in developing Web accessibility guide-
lines since the late 1990s. In general, the W3C’s Web accessibility design guidelines seek to
ensure that:19
●
visual or auditory content is supported by corresponding alternative content;
for example, for images, alternative text is assigned that enables screen read-
ers to describe aloud what is shown in the image; similarly, visual text is
added to supplement audio content
●
information is not conveyed only through the use of color; for example, not
relying on color alone to indicate a link
●
background and foreground colors provide adequate contrast
●
text and objects that move, scroll, or blink can be turned off without losing
information or navigation
●
navigational links are presented clearly and consistently
●
page content is consistent across all pages
●
text is simply worded and easy to understand
The W3C guidelines also specify a number of technical standards for using HTML and
other technologies to create accessible Web pages that support this list of accessibility
guidelines. You’ll learn more about HTML and other Web page technologies in Chapter 9.

S U C C E S S
“The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability
is an essential aspect.”
Tim Berners-Lee, director of W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web
Another design issue that is closely related to Web accessibility is Web site and page
usability. While accessibility guidelines focus on ensuring that people with disabilities have
equal access to Web resources, Web site and page usability guidelines are designed to help
all Web site visitors accomplish their goals quickly and easily. Designing for accessibil-
ity gives you a good start toward designing for usability.
Chapter 8
294

Since the mid-1990s, scientists, engineers, and psychologists have conducted a num-
ber of research studies to learn how humans interact with different Web site and Web page
elements in order to identify ways to optimize site and page usability.20 These studies looked
at a variety of elements that can affect Web site/page usability, including:
●
organizational structures
●
frames and splash pages
●
the way Web page text is written
●
color, fonts, font sizes, and font styles
●
different types and arrangement of links
●
page scrolling actions
●
images and multimedia
●
the time it takes to download pages in a browser
In recent years, the results of some of the older studies have been mitigated or under-
cut by transformations such as the increasing level of sophistication of Web site visitors,
changes in programming standards, greater access to high-speed Internet connections, and
advances in the technologies used to create and view Web pages. For example, recommen-
dations to create fixed-width pages for a specific monitor resolution have largely been off-
set by recommendations to create Web pages that resize with the browser window size. In
other instances, however, the findings of these studies still inform Web page design today.
For example, the recommendation to use a consistent page layout and design across all the
pages of a Web site has become common, if not standard, practice.
An important result of these research studies was that many Web designers began
adhering to their findings, and this, over time, led to the creation of a number of de facto
guidelines for Web page layout. The application of these guidelines has, in turn, led to Web
site visitors having a particular set of design expectations. For example, viewers are now
accustomed to seeing a company’s name and/or logo in the upper-left corner of a home
page and finding links to other pages at the site near the top of a page and/or on the left side
of the page. Earlier in this chapter, you learned that studies have shown that a mixed hier-
archical organizational structure contributes to a more usable Web site. In the next sev-
eral sections, you will learn about guidelines for designing Web content to enhance the
usability of your individual Web pages.

Web Access for All
In the late 1990s, many scientists and researchers involved with Web development
and design became increasingly concerned that as Web pages evolved and began to
rely more on graphics, animation, and other special effects, it was actually becom-
ing more difficult for people with disabilities to access all the content on a Web page.
A movement led by Tim Berners-Lee and other scientists at the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) that called for full Web accessibility gained momentum. In 1997,
the W3C brought together government agencies, IT industry representatives, orga-
nizations that represented the disabled, disability researchers, and other stakehold-
ers to create its Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). The mission of the WAI is to
develop international standards for Web accessibility and to make available materi-
als and resources that will help Web designers, software engineers, and others
involved with Web technologies to understand and implement those standards.21 In
May 1999, the WAI published its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0)
for Web content and Web technology developers. As of this writing, the WCAG 1.0
guidelines are still in effect. However, an updated set of guidelines, WCAG 2.0, is
under review by WAI members.
In 1998, the U.S. Congress joined the Web accessibility movement by amend-
ing the U.S. Rehabilitation Act to add Section 508, the final standards of which became
effective on June 25, 2001.22 Section 508 mandates that all federal agencies elimi-
nate barriers to public electronic information for people with disabilities. Section 508
covers a host of information technology standards, from standards for software pro-
cured by government agencies to those for making government Web pages
accessible.The standards for government Web page accessibility under Section 508
are based on the WAI published standards.23 Because of the procurement power of
the U.S. government, many colleges, universities, and companies that do business
with government agencies are taking steps to make certain their products and Web
sites are Section 508 compliant.

Accessibility Guidelines at the W3C Web site and find information about Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act at the Section 508 Web site.
T I P
Designing your Web pages with accessibility and usability guidelines in mind makes good business sense.
For one, having pages that are accessible by people with disabilities increases the number of visitors to
your Web site, and thus the number of potential customers for your e-business.The idea is if your pages are
easy to use, you are more likely to convert a wider range of site visitors into customers. Also, following
accessibility and usability guidelines—such as using alternative text for images and animated objects, and
writing clear and simply worded text—may help optimize your pages for search engine indexing.24
Chapter 8

Consistency Across Site Pages
When planning the general design of your pages, make sure that all the pages are consistent
in design and function. Although your home page is likely to be the starting point for many visi-
tors, there is no guarantee which of your pages a visitor will access first, especially if he or she
arrives at your site by clicking through from a search results list. Additionally, a visitor may
click through to a specific page other than the home page when he or she uses an affiliate link.
To avoid disorienting a visitor who enters your site at a page other than your home page, you
should design of all your pages so that they present a common look and feel. For example,
you might consider placing your e-business’s name and logo in the same location on every page,
positioning the same style navigational elements in the same location on every page, and using
the same color scheme and font styles on every page. This sort of consistency in your design
will help reassure visitors that they are still browsing pages at your site and have not inadvert-
ently moved to pages at a different site.
The Rackspace Managed Hosting site provides an excellent example of design consis-
tency across pages at a Web site. Figure 8-1 illustrated the Rackspace home page. Fig-
ures 8-8 through 8-10 illustrate three additional pages at the Rackspace Managed Hosting
site: the Managed Hosting page, the Network page, and the Leadership page. Note the con-
sistent use of the company name and logo, navigational elements, font styles, and other
design elements on all four pages. Anyone who enters the Rackspace site at any of these
pages and then browses to other pages at the site should easily understand where they are.

Navigational Elements
An internal link is a connection between two pages at the same Web site. You can create
internal links using either text or images, but remember to always include complemen-
tary text links if you choose to use image links so that the links are accessible to all your
site’s visitors. You can use a number of different styles for your site’s internal links, includ-
ing text links, navigation bars, menus, navigation tabs, breadcrumb trails, and site maps.
Most sites use a combination of these styles. For example, you are likely to see embedded
text links in paragraphs, a graphic navigation bar across the top of a Web page, and cor-
responding simple text navigation bar at the bottom of the same Web page. Whichever link
style you use, remember to apply that style consistently across the pages at your site. This
helps your visitors clearly identify links as they move from page to page. Because visi-
tors do not necessarily enter your site at the home page, remember also to include a link
to the home page on all other pages at your site. The upcoming sections explore some
navigational elements and styles commonly found on Web pages.
Embedded Text Links
An embedded text link is a link positioned inside a text paragraph. When creating an
embedded text link (or, for that matter, any text link), make certain that the text you use
for the link clearly describes what page viewers will see when they click the link. For
example, text links Home or Privacy Statement clearly identify the pages to which the links
refer. If you embed a text link in a paragraph, the link’s text should fit into the context of
the surrounding text. This enables both humans and screen readers to visually scan for
and identify the links. For example, you should use phrasing like “Prices on the latest ZAX
phones” instead of “Click here to view our prices on ZAX phones.” It is easy to identify the
“ZAX” phones link when scanning the paragraph for relevant links, but the “Click here”
link means nothing unless you read the remainder of the sentence.26
Earlier in this chapter, you learned that Web page viewers have come to expect a Web
page to contain certain design elements. For example, most Web users are familiar with the
change in appearance that text links undergo when they have been accessed—namely,
the use of underlining and a dark color (often blue) to indicate a text link that has not yet
been clicked, and the use of underlining and a purple or maroon color to indicate a text
link that has already been clicked. Both of these commonly recognized formats for text links
also serve to distinguish the links from any surrounding text. As already noted, these for-
mats also make the process of visually scanning a Web page for links easier. If you decide
to stray from this common practice, remember to pay particularly close attention to acces-
sibility and usability issues. Make certain the alternative format you use allows visitors to
quickly and easily distinguish your text links from their surrounding text. Finally, don’t
forget to avoid using color alone to indicate a link.

According to U.S. Census Bureau projections, 15 percent of the U.S. population—approximately 49.9 mil-
lion people—will be age 62 and over by 2010.25 Web sites with content directed to an audience of older
adults should consider incorporating special design features that accommodate visitors whose physical
abilities may have changed due to aging. The student online companion to this text contains links to Web
pages that provide information and tips for designing Web pages for such audiences.

Clickable Table of Contents and Top-of-Page Links
You can help viewers navigate between topics on a long Web page by adding a clickable table
of contents section with text links to individual sub-topics throughout the page. A click-
able table of contents allows visitors to click a subtopic link in the table of contents to
quickly “jump” to that section of the page. You should also add a top-of-page link—a link
to a position at the top of the Web page—at the end of each subtopic to allow viewers to
quickly return to the top of a page. The text “Top” or “Back to top” or “Top of Page” is often
used for top-of-page links.
Combining a clickable table of contents and with top-of-page links enables your view-
ers to read just the subtopic in which they are interested without having to scroll through
a long page.27 Figure 8-11 illustrates the clickable table of contents at the top of the very long
page on Tanzania at the Central Intelligence Agency’s The World Factbook site. Figure 8-12
show a top-of-page link that appears further down on the same page on Tanzania.

Navigation Bars, Menus, and Tabs
A navigation bar is a series of graphic or text-based internal links that send visitors to the
various major pages of a given Web site. Using navigation bars can help you create a com-
mon look for links across all the pages at your site. Remember to place the navigation
bars at the same location on each of your pages.28 Figure 8-13 and 8-14 show the graphic
and text navigation bars on the home page of a Web site that specializes in advertising gov-
ernment jobs, USAJOBS.

A link that directs a visitor outside your Web site is called an external link.You can create external links
using text or images. External links should open a new browser window to display the link’s target page
so that it is clear to visitors that they have exited your Web site.

A navigation menu is a list of internal links, similar to a list of commands from a soft-
ware program menu. To make more efficient use of Web page space, some complex Web
sites use drop-down navigation menus near the top of the page, expandable navigation
menus on the left side of the page, or navigation tabs, similar to file folder tabs. Figure
8-15 illustrates a drop-down navigation menu near the top of the Rackspace Managed Hosting
home page. Figure 8-16 shows an expandable navigation menu and navigation tabs on the

Breadcrumb Trails
Another way to help visitors better navigate your site is to use a hierarchical navigational
outline, called a breadcrumb trail, which shows all the levels of links between the page
currently being viewed and the Web site’s home page (or another major page). A bread-
crumb trail can provide a site’s visitors with feedback on where they are at a site and how
they got there.29 In addition, visitors at a site can use the breadcrumb trail to quickly move
up or down in the hierarchy and more easily understand the relationship of the page they
are viewing to the page from which they started. Although breadcrumb trails are great
visual cues, some site visitors may be unfamiliar with them. Therefore, a breadcrumb trail
should be used in conjunction with other more familiar navigational links such as naviga-
tion bars. Figure 8-17 illustrates a breadcrumb trail at the U.S. government’s official Web
portal, FirstGov.gov. The breadcrumb trail begins with a Home page link (where the visi-
tor started), continues with the Agencies page link (which was accessed via the visitor’s
next click), and ends with a link to the Federal Executive Branch page (which the visitor
is currently viewing). The visitor can move back through their viewing history by clicking
the Agencies or Home page link.

Site Maps
A site map, sometimes called a site index, is a Web page that shows a summary of all the
linked pages at a Web site and depicts how those pages fit into the site’s organizational
structure. A site map can be very useful to viewers of a complex Web site that has many
pages. Figure 8-18 illustrates the site map at the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) Web site.

Rollover Links
Despite design guidelines that discourage the practice of designing pages with confusing or
hard to find links, some Web sites still use rollover links, animated graphics with links that
appear or disappear as a visitor moves the mouse pointer over the graphic. When design-
ing your Web pages, remember that the whole point of your pages’ links is to quickly get your
visitors to the information, products, or services they want and need. Links that are pretty
and animated, but hard to locate and use, may frustrate your visitors and drive them to
your competitors’ Web sites. If you must use rollover links in your design, remember to pro-
vide alternative text links, navigation bars, menus, or tabs.
Page Layout
Some studies have shown that viewers generally look first at the top of page, then they look
left and right—in that order—before reading down the page.30 With this in mind, you
should consider placing important or critical information near the top center, top left, and
top right areas of the page. For example, because quick telephone contact with sales and
customer support staff is an important element of the services provided by Rackspace Man-
aged Hosting, critical sales and customer support phone numbers are positioned near the
top-center of each page, along with the company name and logo (positioned at the top
left) and a link to the client login page (top right), followed immediately by navigation menus
centered near the top of the page (as was shown in Figure 8-1).
Fixed-width Pages vs. Liquid Design
Because most people will view your pages at a resolution of 800 x 600 or higher, some Web
designers suggest creating pages that view best at the 800 x 600 resolution. However, creating
a fixed-width page—a page whose width does not vary—for the 800 x 600 resolution does have
some drawbacks. When the page is viewed at the 1024 x 768 or higher resolution, a blank area
will appear at the page margins; when the page is viewed at a lower resolution, viewers will have
to scroll the page horizontally to see all the content on the page. Usability guidelines gener-
ally discourage requiring viewers to scroll pages horizontally.31
Because you have no control over the screen resolutions of your visitors’ computers, a
more important design issue to consider is how your pages will look in differently sized Web
browser windows. Instead of designing your pages for a specific screen resolution and so that
they fit within a fixed viewing area (for example, a maximized browser window), you should
consider using liquid design techniques to create your pages. Liquid design techniques
allow your pages to automatically resize to fit the browser window in which they are being
viewed. Two tools for liquid design are tables and cascading style sheets.
A table is a layout of columns and rows within which text or data or images can be
positioned. You may be familiar with using tables to organize text in a word processing docu-
ment or data in a spreadsheet. By some estimates, more than 90 percent of all Web pages

fusing or hidden navigational elements such as rollover links, use a link on the student online compan-

designed today use tables to organize page content.32 You can use tables to create fixed-
width pages by specifying the width of each column to be limited to an exact number of pix-
els (a pixel is a single point of light on a monitor’s screen). But you can also use tables in
a liquid design technique by specifying a table’s width to be 100 percent of the browser
window’s viewing area instead of occupying a specific number of pixels.33
An alternative to using percentage-width tables to lay out a page in liquid design is to
use cascading style sheets. Cascading style sheets (CSS) are files that contain the rules
or codes that define style issues—fonts, color, and item positioning—for all the pages at a
site. CSS codes can be inserted internally in a Web page or can be placed in a separate
document that is referenced by a browser as it displays the page. 34, 35
Page Length
Early Web usability studies indicated that Web page visitors sometimes became frustrated
or disoriented when they had to scroll vertically to view the content on very long Web
pages. In general, it is a good idea to break up a very long page into several shorter pages.
However, as with other page layout considerations, the length of a page depends on what
viewers are doing at the page.36 For example, if a page has content that is likely to be printed
and read offline, such as the individual country pages at The World Factbook site shown
in Figures 8-11 and 8-12, then creating a long page with a clickable table of contents and
intermittent top-of-page links is preferable. If a page is to be read primarily online and can
be logically broken into multiple shorter pages, doing so helps your site visitors avoid unnec-
essary vertical scrolling.
Splash Pages and Frames
Two older Web design techniques that are less commonly used today, but still worth discuss-
ing, are splash pages and frames. As you learned earlier, the first page or home page at your
Web site is very important and should make clear to a viewer who you are and what you do. A
splash page, sometimes called an entry page, is a Web page that is used to create a showy
entrance to a Web site, which it does by featuring big, flashy, sometimes animated
graphic images (and occasionally sound effects). After the animated graphics and sounds
finish playing, the Web site home page automatically loads in the Web browser. To allow visi-
tors to move on, most splash pages contain a link that the visitor can click to bypass the
animation and get right to the site’s home page. For site visitors eager to find information or
make a purchase, a splash page can be annoying; many design guidelines suggest avoid-
ing splash pages unless they are essential to conveying your site’s message.
A Web browser’s display area can be divided into separate sections called frames in which
different Web pages appear. For example, the home page of a Web site could consist of three
frames: a top frame containing a page with the company name and logo, a left frame con-
taining a page with navigational links, and a main frame in which pages containing con-
tent appear. Unfortunately, frames may make a page look cramped and cluttered and may
cause navigation problems for viewers.37 Additionally, as you learned in the search engine
optimization section of Chapter 6, frames may cause problems for search engine robot or
spider programs trying to index the site’s pages. As in the case of splash pages, design guide-
lines generally suggest avoiding frames.

“The golden rule of doing business on the Web is ‘Don’t do anything [when designing your
Web pages] that gets in the way of the sale.’”

Search Function and Forms
Most Web users are very familiar with using a search tool, such as Google, to find informa-
tion on the Web. It may be helpful, therefore, to add a search function to your site so that
visitors can perform keyword searches for information on products and services at your
site. If you add a search function, you should include the function on all pages at your site
where visitors might want to use it; and you should place the search feature where it will
be easy to find and use. Alternatively, you can create a separate search page. If you cre-
ate a separate search page, be sure to place a link to it on all the other pages where users
might need it. Also, be sure to include “how to search” instructions and examples for both
the basic search feature and any advanced search options that are available.38
Another Web page element that you will likely include at your site is forms. You use
Web page forms to collect information from viewers. Forms can consist of text labels and
the related input boxes, option buttons, drop-down lists, or check boxes. Forms allow a
viewer to enter specific information on the Web page and then send that information to the
e-business’s e-mail address or Web site database. Forms are used for many functions, such
as providing site feedback, registering for approval to use Web site functions, and order-
ing products online. You can also allow customers to download your forms so they can print
and complete the forms offline. Figure 8-19 illustrates both a search function and down-
loadable forms function on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms and Instruction page.

Writing for the Web
Usability studies indicate that there are important differences between writing for the Web
and writing for the printed page. For example, the results of one early study by Dr. Jakob
Nielsen at Sun Microsystems indicated the following:
●
70 percent of viewers scanned Web page content instead of reading it word
for word.
●
Reading text on a screen was 25 percent slower than reading printed text.
●
Web page text should have 50 percent of the word count it would have if printed
on a paper.39
Thus, early guidelines for writing for the Web emphasized writing short, succinctly writ-
ten paragraphs and using bulleted or numbered lists instead of densely worded text to
enhance the visitor’s ability to scan Web page text. More recent guidelines for writing for the
Web continue to recommend writing scannable text for most pages; but they also recog-
nize that some Web page text is designed to be read word-for-word and not scanned.40
The “Research-Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines” report developed by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services offers some useful guidelines for writing text to
be read online.41, 42, 43, 44
●
Use simple and direct language, and write in active voice.
●
Start each paragraph with a descriptive sentence; write succinctly by limiting
the number of words in a sentence and the number of sentences in the
paragraph.
●
Avoid industry jargon, and make sure that your site’s target audiences will
understand any acronyms or abbreviations you use.
●
To add emphasis, use boldface formatting; avoid using italic formatting, which
is hard to read online; and never use underlining for emphasis, as this signals
a text link.
●
Place related items in a bulleted or numbered list for easy scanning; intro-
duce each list with a descriptive heading.
●
Use a dark text color on a light colored background, such as black text on a
white background.
●
Use a familiar font, such as Arial, Times New Roman, Georgia, Helvetica, or
Verdana.
●
Use a font size no smaller than the equivalent of a 12-point font for the
printed page.
Finally, it is very important that all the your Web page text be checked for spelling errors
and professionally proofread and edited for grammatical and stylistic errors.

“It is up to your organization to speak the language of your customer, not the other way

Color
Choosing the right colors for a Web site can be critical, because color is one of the first things
a viewer sees as a Web page loads in his or her browser. Also, color can quickly set the tone
(good or bad) for a viewer’s experience at your Web site. Consider choosing a color
scheme of no more than three or four colors and applying this scheme consistently to the
page elements across all your Web pages.45 Make certain that the scheme you choose
allows for a good contrast between text color and the background color.
Color evokes both a cultural and emotional response; therefore, your Web page color
scheme should reflect the values and expectations of your site’s target audience(s). For
example, the Web page color scheme for a financial services company should use colors that
evoke feelings of trust, competency, and professionalism, such as white, blue, brown, and
gray. In contrast, the color scheme for an entertainment site should evoke feelings of fun
and excitement, so colors like red, orange, and black might be more suitable.
According to some reports, more than 75 percent of all Internet users live outside the
United States. This means that your e-business Web site will, whether you intend for it to
or not, most certainly have an international audience.46 You may, therefore, want con-
sider how people from different cultures around the world will respond to the colors you
choose for your Web site. For example, the colors red and blue may evoke very different cul-
tural and emotional responses in Eastern cultures than they do in Western cultures. Work-
ing with a design professional can help you select the most appropriate color scheme for
your site.

Critical First Impressions
In the late spring of 2000, the international retailer of luxury goods LVMH
(Moët Hennessey - Luis Vuitton) jumped into the online marketplace by launching
eLUXURY.com, an upscale fashion site designed to appeal to the “current buyer of
luxury goods and services, as well as the aspirational buyer.”47 After the launch,
the eLUXURY.com management team paid very close attention to customer feedback.
What they found was surprising. The feedback indicated that the Web site’s audi-
ence was younger than anticipated, with more customers falling into the 25–35 age
group, instead of the older age range of the typical consumer of luxury goods who
shopped in the company’s brick-and-mortar stores. By October, a scant 3 1/2 months
after the launch, the company did a major redesign of the Web site to target these
younger, online consumers.48
The redesign included replacing the dominant black-and-white color scheme with
bolder colors and using bolder typefaces to suggest a fresher, younger attitude. It
also included more product illustrations and photographs of a wider product assort-
ment to place a greater emphasis on a fashion-forward approach. In addition, the
redesign effort involved adding fashion show video clips to the Web site’s online maga-
zine, and modifying the Web site’s navigational structure to add links to the online
magazine from any page at the Web site. The immediate result of the redesign was
a doubling of the pages viewed by visitors—and an increase in sales.49
Now catering to a more youthful but affluent market, eLUXURY.com styles itself
as the “ultimate destination for what’s hip, hot, and hard to find” and sells a variety
of prestigious luxury goods brands such as Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Bac-
carat (Figure 8-20).50

Images and Multimedia
Images, audio, and video can enhance your site’s design and effectively communicate your
Web site’s message. Your logo image helps brand your site, and pictures of your products
help your customers make good buying decisions. Audio and video clips and other anima-
tion add interest and excitement to a site. For example, the use of fashion show video clips
at the eLUXURY.com site supported the site’s fashion-forward message. News sites usually
include audio and video clips to supplement their news stories. While the use of images and
multimedia clips can make your Web site stand out, you should never include an image
or multimedia clip simply because it looks or sounds great. Just like your other Web page
design elements, the images and multimedia you choose must support your site’s business
objectives and satisfy your target audiences’ expectations. As you go about making these
decisions, you should be aware of the various design guidelines for image and multime-
dia clips.

Image File Size
Image file size is an important factor to consider when designing Web pages because the larger
the image file size, the longer a Web page takes to download. To improve download times, Web
page image files should be compressed or reduced in size. There are two primary types of
compressed images used on Web pages—Graphic Interchange Format
or GIF images (usually pronounced “jif”) and Joint Photographic Experts Group or
JPEG images (pronounced “jay-peg”)—each with its own properties and uses. Web page

The Web is a dynamic environment. Site navigation tools and page design for specific e-business Web

bitmap images, such as logos and icons that require no more than 256 colors, are com-
pressed as GIF files because the compression does not result in a loss of image quality. Photo-
graphs, which have more detail, compress better into JPEG images. Although there is some
loss of detail when a photograph is compressed, the loss is generally not noticeable.51, 52
In addition, GIFs have some interesting features that JPEGs do not. GIFs can be animated in
that they can be shown as a rapid sequence of frames, like a very short movie or flipbook
animation. GIFs can also have a transparent color, which allows the Web page background to
show through.
Because the use of large images can increase the amount of time it takes for a Web page
to load in a browser, some Web pages feature a small version of an image, called a
thumbnail, in place of the larger image. Thumbnails help reduce download time, and once
the Web page has downloaded, a viewer can click the thumbnail image to see the larger ver-
sion of the image. E-businesses often use thumbnail images to illustrate their product
catalogs.
Background Images
While it is possible to add a background image behind other Web page content, most design
guidelines recommend that background images be used sparingly, if at all.53 Background
images may obscure Web page text and slow page download time. Instead of a back-
ground image, a neutral background color (with an appropriately contrasting text color) is
usually preferable for an e-business Web site.
Image Links
Images links are often used in addition to text links. For example, an image of a shopping
cart might be used as a link to an e-retailer’s shopping cart page, or the image of an enve-
lope on a company’s contact information page might signal a link to an e-mail message
window. If you use image links, you should make certain that you assign alternative text
to each image link so that screen readers can identify the link. You should also remember
to include nearby alternative text links in case viewers have a problem recognizing the
image as a link.

When you are planning your Web site’s design, another important issue to consider is your
budget. The decision whether to develop your Web site in-house or to outsource some
or all of the work will have a major impact on how much it will cost you to design and build
the site. Related to this is the decision you make about whether or not to outsource your

Web hosting needs—this will determine how much it will cost to operate your site. Estimat-
ing design and development costs can be difficult. Depending on the circumstances, costs
may range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.
In-house Web development may require the addition of technical personnel, software,
hardware, and office space. You may need other equipment such as a digital camera to pho-
tograph products in a digital format or a scanner to scan existing photos into a digital format.
You may also need software such as Adobe Photoshop to clean up and enhance the digi-
tal photos you decide to use, or you may need a Web authoring tools such as FrontPage or
Dreamweaver to create your Web site. (You learn more about Web authoring tools in Chap-
ter 9.) Finally, your e-business’s staff must expend time and effort to participate in the
design, testing, and maintenance of the Web site.
Outsourcing Web design work can save a startup e-business time and money by elimi-
nating the costs associated with recruiting and hiring in-house Web design professionals
and purchasing additional equipment and software. Outsourcing Web design also gives you
greater access to experienced design specialists who are familiar with the current best
practices and trends and the latest technological advances. Outsourcing all or part of your
Web site development will, however, require you to enter into contracts with Web design-
ers, programmers, and testers. Before selecting an outsourcing contractor, you should
thoroughly review several outsourcing candidates to get answers to the following questions:
●
What services do they provide?
●
What are their staff capabilities, and what portion of the design work, if any,
will they themselves subcontract?
●
Can they provide references and examples of their work?
●
What is their track record for completing projects on schedule?
Any contract to outsource Web design must also address the important issues of: (1)
who is responsible for updating and maintaining the site, (2) what happens if updates are not
made on a timely basis, and (3) who owns the Web site content. You must be sure that you
are not giving away copyright ownership of the resulting Web site to the designer. If
in-house employees do the Web design and work within the scope of their duties, the copy-
right falls to the e-business. If you outsource the Web design to an independent contrac-
tor, however, the copyright ownership may remain with the creator of the design unless you
have it formally transferred in writing to your e-business. Therefore, it is important to
clarify copyright ownership in writing as part of any Web design agreement with an out-
side designer or developer. And, as with all other contractual relationships, it is a good
idea to have your attorney review the terms of the written agreement.
One considerable benefit of outsourcing your Web design is that it may allow you to
take good advantage of usability analysis. For example, many Web design firms employ
usability analysts, specialists in human-to-computer interactions who work directly with
clients to fine-tune the clients’ Web site plans into usage scenarios and process flow
diagrams. These scenarios and diagrams are then passed on to Web designers and tech-
nicians, who use them to fine tune the Web site’s design.
In this chapter, you learned some guidelines for designing useful and attractive Web
pages and organizing those pages at your site. In Chapter 9, you will learn about the tech-
nologies you can use to create Web pages and how you can measure your Web site’s effec-
tiveness at attracting visitors and converting visitors into customers.

By 2003, the executive committee at Fulbright & Jaworski realized that more and more
of the law firm’s corporate clients were turning to the Internet for information about almost
everything—including legal services. To meet client expectations for a more comprehen-
sive and useful experience at the Fulbright & Jaworski site, the committee decided that
it was time to give the Web site a major overhaul and redesign. This project was so impor-
tant to Fulbright & Jaworski that a senior partner led the in-house team in the redesign
effort. The primary focus for the in-house team was to develop an understanding of what
kind of information Fulbright’s domestic and international clients wanted and needed to
find at the Fulbright & Jaworski Web site.54
As a result of this client-oriented focus, Fulbright & Jaworski revamped the organiza-
tion, color scheme, links, and other elements at its site. Additionally, several new fea-
tures were added, including a feature that translates key site content into different
languages (German, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, and French); download-
able articles and papers that viewers might find relevant and interesting; online registra-
tion for seminars; and a vCard feature that enables clients to download an individual
attorney’s contact information into their electronic address books.55 By August 2003, the
redesigned Fulbright & Jaworski site was launched, and in September 2004, Law Office

Before you create your Web site, you should identify your site’s business objectives, tar-
get audiences, and how these audiences will use your site.
●
Your Web site will have many business objectives that both directly and indirectly con-
tribute to your e-business’s profitability.

The primary audience for your Web site is the customers and potential customers
you identified in the target market assessment portion of your e-business marketing
plan. Secondary audiences include vendors, strategic partners, investors, and the
general public.

Your Web site and page design decisions should be geared toward meeting the wants
and needs of visitors to your site—in particular, fulfilling their desire to find information
or make a purchase.
●
You should try to anticipate any technological constraints your viewers might experi-
ence when accessing the pages at your site, viewing page content, or using page
features.
●
Your Web site will consist of a primary page, also known as a home page, and as many
secondary pages as necessary to meet your visitors’ wants and needs. Home page con-
tent should readily provide a visitor with the answers to four basic questions about your
e-business: who you are, what you do, where the visitor can find what he or she wants
or needs, and why the visitor should be interested in your products and services.
●
The organizational structure of your site determines the linking relationships between
its Web pages. Studies have shown that a mixed hierarchical structure with necessary
cross-linked pages improves a site’s usability.
●
A storyboard is a helpful planning tool for visualizing your site’s organizational struc-
ture and the linking relationships between the pages.
●
Good Web page design creates useful and attractive Web pages that support your
e-business’s Web site message rather than detracting from it.
●
Designing your site and pages with Web accessibility guidelines in mind makes your Web
site and pages available to people with disabilities.
●
Designing your site and pages with Web usability guidelines in mind can help ensure that
visitors can quickly and easily find information or make a purchase at your site.
●
It is very important that the design of your Web pages, including elements such as page
layout, navigational elements, and color scheme, be consistent across all the pages at
your site.
●
Embedded text links should use descriptive text and be formatted in such a way that the
links stand out from the surrounding text.
●
In general, it is a good idea to break very long pages into multiple shorter pages. Some
pages, however, such as those designed to be printed and read offline, can remain long.
To help viewers navigate very long pages, provide a clickable table of contents and inter-
mittently placed top-of-page links.
Designing Your Web Site
315

●
Navigation bars, menus, and tabs can save page space and help you create a com-
mon look for the links across all your Web site’s pages. A breadcrumb trail shows visi-
tors where they are at your site in relation to where they started.
●
A site map is a summary of all the categories of pages and page links at your site.
●
Important information, such as your e-business’s name, logo, primary navigation ele-
ments, and other critical information, should appear at or near the top of each page.
●
Fixed-width Web pages display best in a maximized browser window at a specific screen
resolution. Liquid design allows a Web page to fit within different sized browser windows.
●
Avoid any Web design elements (such as splash pages, frames, and unnecessary
images or multimedia) that make it more difficult for visitors to find information or make
a purchase.
●
Writing for the Web is different from writing for the printed page in that online text should
be succinctly worded in simple, direct language; related items should be placed in bul-
leted or numbered lists for easy scanning; and the text should be formatted in a famil-
iar font and easily read font size.
●
Color generates different emotional and cultural responses in various audiences; there-
fore, select your Web site color scheme carefully and make certain it supports your Web
site’s message.
●
When used appropriately, images and multimedia elements can enhance a Web site’s
design and effectively communicate information. To optimize the performance of these
elements, you should become familiar with the different file sizes and try to use the small-
est files possible (to avoid overly long download times). Avoid background images and
be sure to include alternative text links for any image links.
●
Outsourcing Web design work can save your startup e-business time and money by elimi-
nating the costs of recruiting and hiring in-house Web design professionals and purchas-
ing additional equipment and software. Outsourcing Web design work also gives you
access to experienced design professionals who are familiar with current best prac-
tices and latest technologies as well as access to usability testing.

Originally founded in the mid-1980s, the Resort Sports Network (RSN) is a national cable
television network with 29 television station affiliates broadcasting adventure sports and
travel programming into more than 70 resort-destination markets in North America.1
RSN provides information such as weather conditions, where to eat, where to shop, what
to do with the kids, and so forth for more than 100 mountain, beach, and golf resort
areas.2 Rated the number one network in its market by Nielsen//Netratings, RSN launched
its Web site, RSN.com, in 1996.3 By 2000, RSN.com’s management wanted to revamp the
site by adding interactive features that would allow visitors to personalize and custom-
ize content at the site. How could the management at RSN.com know that interactive per-
sonalization and customization features were what its site visitors wanted and needed?

As you learned in Chapter 8, whether you have in-house employees develop your
e-business Web site or you outsource the site’s design and development, you still are respon-
sible for making important decisions about how your site looks and functions. For example,
in order to hire an in-house programmer or outside Web developer, it may be useful to
have some knowledge of the tools that person might use to create your Web pages. Some
of the more common and popular Web page development tools are:
●
markup languages
●
text editors
●
HTML/XHTML editors
●
Web authoring software
●
multimedia tools and scripting languages (which are used to add images, ani-
mation, sound, and video content to your site)
Markup Languages
A markup language is a set of rules and instructions, also called tags, that are embedded
in an electronic document in order to define various aspects of the document’s content and
appearance. These markup tags are codes enclosed in angle brackets (for example
<body> and </body>). They can describe a document’s data and specify how document and
Web page elements, such as text and images, are formatted and positioned on a page by
computers.4 They can also be used to describe the actual data (for example, purchase order
or invoice data) contained in a document that businesses exchange across an extranet.
About 40 years ago, scientists began working on a generic coding system that would
allow documents created for one computer system to be correctly displayed and printed
when transported to a different computer system. The Standard Generalized Markup
Language (SGML) was the result of that work. More precisely, SGML is a standard that
defines a set of rules for encoding documents so that the documents are transportable
among computer systems. The SGML standard is approved by the International Organiza-
tion for Standardization (ISO), an international body of worldwide organizations that set
standards for numerous industry and government products and services.5, 6 The SGML
standard (ISO 8879:1986) can be used to create other markup languages. For example,
three markup languages based on the SGML standard that are commonly used on the Web
are Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Exten-
sible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML).
Extensible Markup Language (XML)
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a streamlined subset of SGML developed in
1996 by the XML Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XML is used
to describe data transmitted over the Web.7, 8 The XML tags used for a given document are
defined in a specification—known generally as a document type definition specification
(DTD) and specifically as an XML schema—that is either part of or attached to the
Chapter 9
326

document.9 Developers using XML create customized tags, which can be used to describe
or identify any type of data—the sender and receiver of the data must simply agree on the
tags and on what the tags describe. Due to this versatility, XML is often used by busi-
nesses to exchange a range of data, including company-specific data related to various
business processes such as shipping, receiving, and billing. Figure 9-1 shows an example of
how customized XML tags can be used to define purchase order data exchanged between
two businesses.
Another subset of SGML, the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), was developed to
control how data looks when viewed in a Web browser.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is an easy-to-use markup language that was
originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web.10 Berners-Lee created
HTML to allow documents with headings, text, tables, bulleted or numbered lists, images,
links, and other such style elements to be published on the Web and displayed properly in
a Web browser.11 When creating HTML in the early 1990s, Berners-Lee relied, in part, on
SGML tag formulation, but HTML did not become an SGML-based standard until the mid-
1990s.12
Unlike XML, which is used to describe data, HTML is used to display and format data
for viewing in a Web browser. Suppose that purchase order data is to appear on a page
titled “Purchase Order.” HTML tags could then be used to specify that this heading text
should be displayed in, for example, the center of the Web page between the left and right
margins, and that it should be formatted with the Arial font and the bold font style. Another
difference between XML and HTML is that whereas developers using XML can create their
own custom tags to describe data, developers using HTML can use only predefined tags
to lay out and format their Web pages. These predefined HTML tags can, however, be used
to communicate a range of information to a Web browser, including:
●
where to start and stop a Web page
●
where to find special heading information, such as a page title or meta tag
description and keywords
●
where to place paragraph breaks

●
where bulleted or numbered lists begin and end
●
what text is bolded or italicized for emphasis
●
which images to insert and where the images are stored
●
which text or image should function as a hyperlink
Like XML tags, HTML tags are placed inside angle brackets. For example, the tags that
specify the beginning and end of a Web page are <html> and </html>, respectively. (Note
that, as in XML, the closing tag of a pair of HTML tags includes a forward slash.) Between
the <html> and </html> tags are placed other HTML tags that display Web page elements,
such as heading text, paragraph text, images, and hyperlinks. Some basic HTML tags and
their respective elements are as follows.
●
The <head> and </head> tags indicate the beginning and end of a Web page’s
heading section, which generally contains the page title and meta tags you
learned about in Chapter 6.
●
The <title> and </title> tags indicate the text that appears in the title bar of
the Web browser.
●
The <body> and </body> tags indicate the beginning and end of the body of
a Web page, which generally consists of text, images, and hyperlinks.
●
The <p> and </p> tags indicate the beginning and end of a paragraph.
●
The <h1> and </h1> tags indicate an HTML heading style—in this case, head-
ing 1—that should be applied to the text these tags surround.
●
The <b> and </b> tags indicate that the bold font style should be applied to
the text these tags surround.
Figure 9-2 illustrates these basic HTML tags (which were created in the software pro-
gram Notepad) as they might be used to format and display a very simple Web page. Fig-
ure 9-3 shows this page displayed in a Web browser (in this case, the Firefox browser).

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which you learned about in Chapter 8, sets
HTML standards and adds, replaces, or deletes tags in the markup language on an ongo-
ing basis. Since its conception, HTML has evolved through several versions. As of this writ-
ing, the current W3C standard is HTML version 4.01.13 One example illustrating how
HTML has evolved over the years is the issue of how Web page text is formatted. Whereas
older versions of HTML used tag pairs and their properties to indicate how text should be
formatted (for example, to specify the type of font and font size to be used or how the text
is horizontally aligned on the page), the HTML 4.01 standard is deprecating (that is, phas-
ing out) formatting tags in favor of using cascading style sheets (CSS), which you learned
about in Chapter 8, to control the formatting of text across multiple Web pages.14, 15
In the past, Web browsers have been forgiving of sloppy HTML coding practices and
would try to display a page despite some coding errors or omissions, such as the omission
of the paragraph closing tag </p> at the end of a paragraph. Web browsers would also inter-
pret HTML tags whether they were written in uppercase, lowercase, or a combination of
both. For example, an opening and closing pair written as <HTML> and </html> would be
accepted. However, coding standards are evolving, and the HTML 4.01 coding standards are
stricter than the standards for previous HTML versions. For example, unlike earlier HTML
versions, HTML 4.01 requires developers to write tags and their properties only in
lowercase. Tags that in earlier versions were single tags, such as the <img> tag used to indi-
cate the insertion of an image, must now have a closing tag, </img>. This evolution of
HTML toward using CSS and toward adopting stricter coding standards is preparing Web
developers to convert to the “next generation” of HTML—the Extensible Hypertext
Markup Language, or XHTML.

Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML)
The Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) version 1.0 reformulated HTML
4.01 into XML. XHTML 1.0 is in fact very similar to HTML 4.01.16 While Web developers still
create pages using HTML 4.01, some developers stress the importance of migrating to
XHTML from HTML in order to stay current with changing technologies and W3C standards.
In addition to complying with W3C standards, the benefits of using XHTML include stricter
coding rules to help eliminate coding errors and omissions, better structured docu-
ments that display in a Web browser more quickly, the flexibility of creating custom tags,
and more control over how Web pages are viewed by wireless devices and screen
readers.17, 18 XHTML 1.1, which added markup features for Asian languages, became a
W3C standard in May 2001; as of this writing, developers are discussing a yet newer ver-
sion, XHTML 2.0.19, 20

“XML is a new standard—suite of standards—coming out of W3C. XML doesn’t replace
HTML directly—it replaces the SGML family of which HTML was one. XHTML is equiva-
lent to HTML but in the XML family. XML is simpler than SGML. It makes creating new
languages (like XHTML) easier.”
Tim Berners-Lee, director of the W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web
Text Editors and Web Authoring Software
You can create a Web page from scratch by typing the HTML or XHTML tags and related
text in a simple text editor, software that allows you to create text documents but lacks the
special document creating and formatting features found in a word processor. The Note-
pad software installed with the Windows operating system, and shown in Figure 9-2, is an
example of a text editor.
You also can use a text editor designed specifically for creating HTML/XHTML
documents. HTML/XHTML editors provide features that make coding a Web page easier and
faster, such as line numbering, tag menus, and a familiar working environment with menus
and toolbars. Some inexpensive HTML/XHTML editors are TextPad (Helios Software),
BBEdit for the Macintosh (Bare Bones Software), HomeSite (Macromedia), and HTMLPad
2005 (Blumentals Software). Figures 9-4 and 9-5 illustrate how the HTMLPad 2005 text
editor is used to create a Web page using HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, respectively.
T I P
Two other W3C markup language standards for the Web are the Synchronized Multimedia
Integration Language (SMIL), which is used to synchronize multimedia elements on a Web page, and
the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML), which is used to structure mathematical expressions on
a Web page.

Web authoring software provides a “What You See Is What You Get” or WYSIWYG
environment in which you create Web pages in much the same way you create docu-
ments in word processing software. Like HTML/XHTML editors, Web authoring software
provides a familiar working environment with menu commands and toolbar buttons that
enable you to build a Web page by keying and formatting text, inserting images, and creat-
ing hyperlinks. But unlike HTML/XHTML editors, Web authoring software can also auto-
matically insert the appropriate markup tags and their properties (values that further define
the tags) as you enter and format Web page elements. Two popular Web authoring soft-
ware packages are FrontPage (Microsoft) and Dreamweaver (Macromedia).
FrontPage
Microsoft FrontPage Web authoring software allows you to create a Web site folder, called
a FrontPage Web, and then create the site’s individual Web pages, which are saved in the
folder. In addition, FrontPage shares features like the Clip Organizer, common menu com-
mands, toolbar buttons, and task panes with Microsoft Office programs, such as Microsoft
Word. Also like Microsoft Office, FrontPage provides “wizards” (step-by-step instruc-
tions) and templates (model documents) for creating a new FrontPage Web and new
Web pages.
FrontPage offers a number of views and sub views that you can use to create your Web
pages. You use the Design sub view in Page view to see the text, images, and links you insert
on a page; the Code sub view to track the markup code being inserted automatically as
you work; the Preview sub view to see how your page looks in a Web browser; and the Split
sub view to see both the Design sub view and Code sub view at once. The appendix to this
book discusses other FrontPage views.
FrontPage also offers color-coordinated visual themes that, like Microsoft Power-
Point’s Design templates, contain graphics, bullets, and font formatting that you can apply
to one or more pages. In addition, FrontPage supports both table layout and CSS to help
you maintain a consistent look across your Web site. Because of its familiar working envi-
ronment and competitive pricing (less than $200), FrontPage may be a good choice for cre-
ating and maintaining a non-business or small business Web site. Figure 9-6 shows a Web
page created in FrontPage’s WYSIWYG environment and displayed in Design sub view.
Figure 9-7 depicts the Split sub view, in which you can see both the Web page (in a WYSI-
WYG environment) and its corresponding HTML tags, which were automatically inserted
by the software. Figure 9-8 shows just these HTML tags in Code sub view. Figure 9-9 illus-
trates the Preview sub view and thus shows the Web page as it looks in a Web browser.

Dreamweaver
Macromedia Dreamweaver is considered by many Web developers to be the “industrial
strength” version of Web authoring software. More powerful and rich in features than
FrontPage, Dreamweaver is also much more complex and may, in fact, be difficult for
Web authoring novices to learn to use. Like FrontPage, Dreamweaver offers different views:
a WYSIWYG Design view (Figure 9-10), a markup Code view (Figure 9-11), and a split view
that shows both the Code and Design views (Figure 9-12).

In Dreamweaver, you use a menu command to launch a Web browser and preview the
page currently being developed. Like FrontPage, Dreamweaver also supports table layout
and CSS. Dreamweaver is more expensive (about $400) than FrontPage, and, because of its
complexity, is generally regarded as a Web authoring tool for professional Web developers.21
Multimedia Tools
As you learned in Chapter 8, the appropriate use of images, multimedia, and animation can
add interest to your Web site. Several popular tools for creating and editing images, mul-
timedia, and animations include Photoshop (by Adobe Systems), Flash, Fireworks, and
FreeHand (all three developed by Macromedia).
Photoshop and Fireworks
Adobe Photoshop is image editing software that you can use to create the animated GIFs
you learned about in Chapter 8, draw vector graphics, and edit bitmap graphics. Vector
graphics are created by drawing lines, curves, and polygons to create images. Vector graph-
ics file formats include the Windows Metafile (.wmf), the PostScript (.ps), and the Flash
(.swf) formats.22 Bitmap graphics, also called raster graphics, are created by defining the
color of individual pixels in a bitmap. Raster file formats include the Windows .bmp for-
mat as well as the .gif and .jpeg formats you learned about in Chapter 8.23
Using Photoshop, you can scale and rotate a raster graphic, adjust its colors, and cor-
rect flaws, such as scratches. You can draw vector shapes (lines, rectangles, polygons, and
so forth) to create a drawing and then add layers of special effects to the drawing. Figure 9-13
shows a picture (in the .jpg format) of a boy being edited in Photoshop.
T I P
Vendors of text editors and Web authoring software, such as Blumentals, Microsoft, and Macromedia,
often provide free trial software downloads at their Web sites. Web sites directed at technology profes-
sionals, such as WebDeveloper.com and CNET Builder.com, also provide reviews and comparisons of text
editors and Web authoring software. You can use links on the student online companion to this text to

Like Photoshop, Fireworks is used to draw vector graphics, edit bitmap graphics, and
create animated GIF files. Figure 9-14 illustrates the same picture of a boy being edited in
Fireworks.

Flash
As you have learned, vector graphics are created with lines and curves. Flash is a multime-
dia program originally designed to provide animation for vector graphics. Flash anima-
tion is often used in Web page ads or online product tutorials. Some Web authoring software,
such as FrontPage and Dreamweaver, have a feature you use to incorporate Flash anima-
tion into Web pages. Additionally, developers can use Flash to create interactive Web sites
with animation, sound effects, and other fun elements. A visitor to a site that has Flash con-
tent must have a Flash player plug-in installed in his or her Web browser in order to view the
Flash content. Figure 9-15 illustrates vector graphic animation being created in Flash.

FreeHand
FreeHand is a graphic design program for planning the layout of any document that con-
tains graphics, such as a brochure, product catalog, or a Web page. FreeHand can also be
used to create a Web site storyboard. Figure 9-16 shows a new document with a perspec-
tive grid layout being created in FreeHand.
You can explore all four of these multimedia tools by reviewing information at the
respective vendor’s Web sites and by downloading trial versions of the software.

A Multimedia Vision
Today’s Internet users constantly encounter images and multimedia—from family pho-
tographs taken with a digital camera, edited on a home computer, and posted to a
Web-based photo album, to complex animation, video, and sound on e-business Web
pages. But it wasn’t always so. In fact, early Web pages were composed of little more
than static text and images. But in the mid-1980s, an outspoken, colorful entrepre-
neur with a multimedia-based vision for the future was instrumental in helping develop
the technologies that would ultimately change Web pages from static to dynamic
documents, and thus lay the groundwork for the multimedia-enriched Web pages we
know today.
In the mid-1980s, to add animation and sound to video games, you had to write
a computer program in a language such as the C programming language.25 In 1984,
Marc Canter and two other video game developers, Jay Fenton and Mark Pierce,
combined resources to form a company named MacroMind. The mission of Canter
and his partners at MacroMind was to develop video game authoring software that
would make it easier for nonprogrammers—artists, designers, and musicians—to
add animation and sound to video games.26 Calling themselves a “software rock and
roll band,” the MacroMind team began developing software for Macintosh comput-
ers, such as MusicWorks (which enabled game developers to add music and sounds
to CDs) and VideoWorks (used to create and play multimedia animation).MusicWorks
failed to catch on, but VideoWorks was licensed to Apple Computers, who used it
to create training discs that were shipped with every Macintosh computer and fea-
tured “guided tours” of the Mac and its software. By the late 1980s, two of the origi-
nal founders of MacroMind (Fenton and Pierce) had moved on to other projects.
Canter remained with MacroMind, where he helped guide the evolution of its pri-
mary software product, VideoWorks, into Director, a very popular multimedia soft-
ware program for the Macintosh that even nontechnical people could use to author
multimedia.
In the early 1990s, a number of changes were taking place at MacroMind. First,
in 1991, MacroMind merged with another multimedia developer named ParaComp
to form MacroMind-ParaComp. Then, in 1992, MacroMind-ParaComp merged with a
third multimedia company, Authorware, Inc., to create a new multimedia power-
house named Macromedia.27 In the meantime, the popularity of the Director soft-
ware (now known as Macromedia Director) continued to grow. By the mid-1990s,
the software was also supported in the Windows operating system environment, and
was being used to create more than 70 percent of multimedia CD-ROMs.28
Over the next several years, Macromedia became a huge player in the multime-
dia software market. In addition to its success with Director, the company devel-
oped many other popular software products, including Flash (animation),
Dreamweaver (Web authoring), Fireworks (graphics), FreeHand (page layout), and
ColdFusion (Web page/database interactivity).In 2005, Macromedia reported $4.4 bil-
lion in sales, announced a net income of $42 million, and was purchased by one of
its main competitors, Adobe Systems, for $3.4 billion.

But what happened to Marc Canter? Sometimes called the “father of multime-
dia,” Canter left Macromedia in 1992, shortly after the merger that created it, and, in
his own colorful words, “took the 90s off.” But Cantor remains a vocal supporter of
multimedia technologies. Today, he is the CEO of Broadband Mechanics, a com-
pany that is developing technologies to allow users to keep track of their digital col-
lections (music, photos, videos, and so forth) and then publish their own content based
on items in their collections.29

“Nowadays everybody and his mother is a multimedia expert. All they have to do is go buy
an iPod, digital camera, PC, Mac, even a videogame console—and they’ve got the power
of computers, graphics, digital video and audio—at their disposal. That wasn’t possible in
1985. Somebody, or group of people had to conceptualize what was possible and make it
all happen. I was one of those people.”
Marc Canter, co-founder of MacroMind, which became Macromedia
Tools for Interactive Web Page Elements
As you learned in Chapter 8, Web pages can contain forms and other interactive content
such as clickable buttons and animation. Developers can add interactive Web page ele-
ments using a variety of technologies, including Java applets and servlets, Active X con-
trols, JavaScript and JScript, PHP, CGI, and Active Server Pages (ASP).
Java Applets and Servlets and ActiveX Controls
Developed by Sun Microsystems, Java is an object-oriented programming language that is
used to create applets and servlets.30 (Object-oriented programming languages for the Web
control interactive Web page elements such as clickable buttons and scroll bars.) An applet
is a small program embedded in a Web page that executes when the page is loaded in a Web
browser.31 Java applets can be used to get information from databases, perform interac-
tive Web page animation and calculations, or carry out other such actions without requir-
ing the browser to send a request back to the server on which the Web page is stored.32 A
servlet is a small program that is similar to an applet but is executed at the server, before
the Web page is loaded in a browser.33 Servlets are often used to process data from online
forms and authenticate user names and passwords, as well as create interactive content.34
ActiveX technologies are object-oriented technologies that were developed by
Microsoft Corporation to compete with the Java programming language. ActiveX controls
are small programs, similar to Java applets, that are used to provide Web page interactiv-
ity primarily for pages viewed in the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser.35, 36
Understanding Web Technologies
343

JavaScript, JScript, PHP, CGI, and ASP
JavaScript, JScript, and PHP are all examples of scripting languages. While the details are
beyond the scope of this book, briefly, a scripting language is a programming language
used to embed run-time instructions in a Web page. Run-time instructions are commands
that do not have to be translated or compiled into a machine-readable format before they
execute—which means that the commands can execute very quickly and efficiently. Despite
its name, JavaScript was developed independently of Sun Microsystems’ Java program-
ming language; the Netscape Corporation developed JavaScript for use with its Netscape
browser.37 Like Java, JavaScript has its own Microsoft equivalent, JScript. Both JavaScript
and JScript are used to add Web page interactivity and dynamic content, such as the open-
ing of pages in pop-up windows.38
PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, or simply PHP, is a scripting language that can be
embedded in HTML and can be used to build Web pages “on the fly” with elements—such
as text, images, audio, and video—stored in databases. PHP is used primarily with Web
servers running the UNIX operating system.39
Another technology, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard, is a set of rules
that determine two-way communication between a Web server and a Web browser. For
example, when a user submits information entered in a Web-based form, a CGI script can
provide the instructions to add the information to a database. CGI scripts can be writ-
ten in a number of programming languages, including C++ and Perl.
Active Server Page (ASP) technologies were developed by Microsoft to embed server-
side controls such as JScript or ActiveX programs in a Web page. ASP is an alternative to
PHP and CGI for pages stored on a Web server running the Microsoft Internet Informa-
tion (IIS) Web server program in a Windows operating system environment.40
It is very likely that your e-business Web pages will be created using some of the Web
technologies discussed here. After your Web pages are completed, you should test them
thoroughly.

“Smarts, Aggressiveness, and Good Timing”
Growing up in Berkeley, California, Kim Polese was always interested in science, com-
puters, and owning her own business.These days, Polese is a successful serial Web
technology entrepreneur. During a 1998 interview for the Women of NASA’s “Take
Our Daughters to Work Day” chat forum, she described her ambition of becoming an
entrepreneur this way:“It has always been a dream of mine to start my own business.
I have known ever since I was a little kid that in some way I [would] make this dream
happen.”42

Dynamic HTML (DHTML) uses HTML tags, style sheets, and a scripting language, such as JavaScript,
to make animations and interactive features (such as a scrolling menu or banner) available in the browser
window after a page is downloaded from the server.41
Chapter 9
344

Polese got a chance to make her dream come true while she was working for
Sun Microsystems, a company she had joined in the late 1980s. By the summer of
1993, she was the product marketing manager for a new programming language
named Oak, which was designed to replace the C++ programming language and be
used to program “smart” appliances, such as coffee makers and microwave ovens.
By mid-1994, however, the focus of Oak development had changed. The Oak devel-
opment team realized that the Internet was on its way to becoming an interactive
“super highway” and was the perfect cross-platform environment in which to exploit the
features of its new programming language. Instead of focusing on how to use Oak
to program a coffee maker to make a morning cup, the team set out to discover how
the language might be used to add interactivity to static Web pages.43
As part of this re-focusing effort, the Oak programming language was renamed
Java and the rest, as the saying goes, is history. As product manager, Polese’s job
included using her entrepreneurial skills to create the business model for marketing
Java, develop a business plan, brand and position Java in the marketplace, and
develop business partnerships with complementary technology providers, such as
Netscape Communications. Polese’s efforts paid off and the Java programming lan-
guage became the hot technology for creating Web page interactivity.
Buoyed by the success of Java, Polese and three of her Java group co-workers
(Sami Shaio, Jon Payne, and Arthur van Hoff) left Sun Microsystems in 1996 to
establish their own Web technology company named Marimba. Each of the four
invested $15,000, and then the group raised $4 million in startup funds from the
VC firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers.44, 45 Marimba focused on developing and
marketing technologies that pushed software patches and updates to computers
over corporate networks.While serving as CEO of Marimba, Polese’s long-time dream
of becoming an entrepreneur was finally realized. In 2004, the co-founders har-
vested Marimba by selling it to BMC software for $239 million.46
Currently, Polese’s desire to run her own business is being realized through other
means. She is CEO of the technology startup SpikeSource, a company that pro-
vides support servers to businesses whose IT departments are using open-source
software.47

Before your Web site is published to its final destination Web server, and thus made
available to the public, you should have your Web pages tested for accessibility and usability.
All the features on each Web page should be checked to make sure they work as expected.
One way to do this testing is to publish your Web site to a temporary server, called a
staging server, and then perform a variety of tests to ensure that:
●
links work correctly
●
data submitted by visitors on Web-based forms update the appropriate database
●
dynamic or interactive elements function properly
Additionally, you should have your site undergo a “stress test” to ensure that it can
handle a heavy load of customer activity. If you develop your site in-house, you may lack
the resources for a thorough testing process. If this is the case, it is a good idea to use the
products or services of professional Web site testing companies, such as UsableNet, Segue
Software, and Empirix.
After your new Web site is thoroughly tested and all the issues discovered are resolved
adequately, you are ready to publish your Web pages to their final destination server. But
publishing your Web pages doesn’t mean that all your work on the Web site is finished.
Because of the dynamic nature of the Web and the constant advancement in Web technolo-
gies, over time you may have to adjust how various pages look and function. You should
also keep your Web site current by soliciting and evaluating feedback about your site from
visitors and then using this feedback to make appropriate changes to page content or
features. Finally, remember to retest your site at intervals as your business evolves.
After your Web site has been tested and is in operation, you must determine the suc-
cess or failure of your site in achieving its business objectives by carefully evaluating the
site’s performance.

P E R F O R M A N C E
In Chapter 8, you learned that determining your Web site’s business objectives is a criti-
cal first step in developing your site. After your site “goes live” you should regularly mea-
sure the site’s performance against these previously established business objectives. This
evaluation not only determines the success or failure of your site in meeting these objec-
tives, but it helps you learn how to improve your e-business’s and your Web site’s
operations. More to the point, success or failure in most businesses, including e-businesses,
is determined by the ability to learn from experience and make improvements. To evalu-
ate your site’s performance, begin by setting appropriate benchmarks and evaluating those
benchmarks using the appropriate Web analytics measurements.
Web Site Benchmarking
To measure your Web site’s performance, you must first set benchmarks, or performance-
based goals, for the site. You can develop benchmarks by observing the actual perfor-
mance of similar e-businesses or by reviewing and comparing your e-business’s performance
to industry averages. If your e-business has an operating history, you may also use histori-
cal data to set your benchmarks. For example, if you are operating a brick-and-click
Chapter 9

e-business, and thus have access to historical brick-and-mortar performance data, you may
set benchmarks based on annual increases in sales over historical sales. If your e-business
is new, you may need to look at similar brick-and-mortar businesses as well as similar
e-businesses to establish your site’s performance benchmarks.
Once you set your Web site’s benchmarks, you must then compare the actual site
results to these benchmarks to determine if the Web site performed as well as, better than,
or worse than the benchmarks. Next, you must arrive at meaningful conclusions on why
the benchmarks were or were not met or exceeded. Because it is possible to establish bench-
marks that are either unattainable or too easily achieved, you may periodically need to
reevaluate your original business objectives and benchmarks to determine if they are
reasonable. Only through reevaluation can you do a better job of setting future busi-
ness objectives and establishing appropriate benchmarks upon which to measure your site’s
performance.48
For evaluating the performance of a Web site, the measurements that are typically
benchmarked are the number of site visitors during a specific period of time or the num-
ber of visitors who become customers during a specific period of time. Such measure-
ments are grouped together in a system of performance measurements known as Web
analytics.
Web Analytics
However you choose to develop, market, and operate your e-business Web site, it will be
an expensive undertaking. One common method you can use to evaluate your Web site’s
performance is to identify its return on investment or ROI—the benefit your e-business
gets in return for the investment in its Web site. The ROI that most e-businesses are look-
ing for is an increase in sales. They want to know that the capital they are spending is gen-
erating additional sales and, they hope, increased profits. While increases or decreases
in sales and profits may be easy to quantify, other factors that influence your Web site’s ROI
may not be as easy. For example, one of the primary factors that can affect your site’s ROI
is the increase (or decrease) in customer satisfaction with interactions at your site, but
this sort of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction may not be immediately measurable in
terms of sales or profits. Determining your site’s ROI can also be challenging because some
online marketing activities may not be immediately measurable. For example, as you
learned in Chapter 6, you can participate in industry-specific newsgroups or publish a blog
to indirectly market your e-business, but it may be difficult to trace the direct impact on
your site’s ROI from these types of activities.
Web Analytics Performance Measures
When trying to determine your site’s ROI, you should be aware that no single measure can
define it. That is, the ROI is likely to depend on a number of factors. While the nature of
these factors can vary, many e-businesses have found that analyzing the behaviors and
actions of visitors at their Web sites can yield a generally useful, reliable ROI. Some visi-
tor behaviors and actions that are useful to track include whether a visitor is visiting your
site for the first time or is a repeat visitor; the last page the visitor accessed before exit-
ing your site; the keywords visitors use to search within your Web site; and so forth. These
and other visitor behaviors and actions like them are referred to as Web analytics,
Understanding Web Technologies

sometimes called Web metrics, as they can be measured, evaluated, and subsequently used
to help determine your site’s performance and ROI.49

“Start [measuring Web site ROI] by defining the site’s overall goals and the desired visi-
tor behaviors that support those goals. Once these are identified, determine which ones
[visitor behaviors] could potentially affect the bottom line the most.”
Jason Burby, director of Web analytics at ZAAZ, an e-business consultancy
Some commonly used Web analytics performance measurements are:51
●
Visit or session: This is a measure of the continuous requests for Web pages
at a site by a single user’s Web browser that hasn’t been inactive for a spe-
cific period of time, for example, 30 minutes. Requests from the same browser
after 30 minutes of inactivity are counted as a new visit. This measurement
indicates how long visitors are staying at the site.
●
Unique visitors (users): This is a measure of an individual visitor to a site, gen-
erally based on a combination of IP address and browser identification or
cookies. The number of unique visitors can help you evaluate the success of
your search engine optimization efforts and site advertising or promotion
efforts.
●
Repeat visitors (users): This measurement identifies unique visitors who visit
a Web site more than once during a specific time period. A large number of repeat
visitors can indicate visitors are getting their wants and needs met at your site;
a small number of repeat visitors can indicate problems at your site.
●
Page views or impressions: This measurement indicates the number of times
a specific page is viewed. Page views information tells you which pages your
visitors are (and are not) viewing at your site.
●
Page views per visitor: This measurement is developed by dividing the num-
ber of page views by the number of unique visitors, and it therefore measures how
deep visitors are going into your Web site. A larger number of page views per visi-
tor usually means that visitors are spending more time at your site.
●
IP addresses: This measurement identifies the origin of a unique visitor. Ana-
lyzing IP addresses enables you to approximately identify countries from which
your Web site visitors are coming, as well as from which networks.
T I P
Although the term “Web metrics” has been used in the past to describe the analysis of individual Web site
visitor activity and site performance, some Web marketers and analysts now prefer to use “Web met-
rics” to describe measures of overall activity on the Internet, such as the number of people online, the num-
ber of people using broadband connections, online demographics, and so forth.50
Chapter 9
348

●
Referring URLs: This measurement indicates how visitors reached your Web
site—whether by keying in the URL directly, clicking a link, or using a search
tool. Reviewing the referring URLs can help you evaluate the effectiveness of
online advertising links.
●
Browser type: This measurement indicates what type of Web browser a visi-
tor is using. This information can be used to make certain your site’s pages
operate correctly in your target audience’s browsers.
●
Click-stream analysis: This measurement identifies the path visitors take
when navigating through the pages at your Web site. A click-stream analysis
shows when and at what page a visitor entered your site, provides a list of all
pages the visitor viewed in the order in which the pages were accessed, tracks
the amount of time a visitor spends at each page, and indicates when a visi-
tor leaves your site and from which page. A click-stream analysis tells you
what visitors at doing at your site.
●
Conversion rate: This measure indicates the rate at which visitors are becom-
ing buyers. You can calculate the conversion rate by dividing the number of
online orders by the number of unique visitors.
●
Shopping cart abandonment: This measurement calculates the rate at which
online shoppers fail to complete a purchase of the items in their shopping cart.
A high rate of shopping cart abandonment may indicate that your site’s check-
out process is too complex or difficult.
Server log analysis and page tagging are two important tools used to develop these and
other Web analytics.

“Usability tests can show where technology or interfaces can stand improvement, but only
Web analytics can measure how well a site addresses a visitor’s needs.”
Bryan Eisenberg, author, Web marketer, and founder of the Web Analytics Association
Web Analytics Tools: Server Log Analysis and Page Tagging
Web servers record all of the events that occur on the server in server log files. For
example, every time a browser requests a Web page or an image, or submits a form, the Web
server log file records this event. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that you can
obtain a treasure trove of information by analyzing these log files, which contain data such
as date, time, the IP address of the computer making the request, browser type, refer-
ring URL, a myriad of other visitor information, and error messages. Figure 9-17 illus-
trates raw data recorded in the server log for the Books for Managers e-business you
learned about in Chapter 7.
Understanding Web Technologies
349

Obviously, raw server log data such as that shown in Figure 9-17 may be difficult to
interpret. Here is an explanation for the first entry in this server log:
●
65.54.188.51: This is the IP address of the computer visiting the Books for Man-
agers Web site (in this case, the IP address tracks back to the msbot.msn.com
domain).
●
[02/Aug/2007:18:23:12 -700]: This is the date and time of the visit, including
a time zone offset from Greenwich Mean Time (-700).
●
“GET /cgi-bin/ae.pl?asinsearch=0142000280 HTTP/1.0”: This is a request for
a specific page at the Books for Managers site and the access method to be used
(HTTP).
●
200 13730: This line contains the event status code (200), which indicates that
the event was successful, and provides the size of the data returned in bytes
(13730).
●
“msnbot/1.0 (+http://search.msn.com/msnbot.htm)”: This indicates that the
entity accessing the Books for Managers site is an MSN Search spider.
The analysis of server log data can be performed in-house by installing server log analy-
sis software or by contracting with an application service provider (ASP) that provides
server log analysis services.
An alternative to server log analysis is page tagging. Page tagging involves adding hid-
den JavaScript images or tags to each of your Web pages. Each time a page is viewed in a
visitor’s browser, the data about the visitor and the page is sent to a remote server, where
it is stored in a database. The database is then accessed to create a variety of reports that
provide an analysis of visitors’ behaviors.52 Figure 9-18 illustrates the process for gather-
ing visitor information using page tagging.
FIGURE 9-17
Web server log entries
Chapter 9
350

The page tagging solution for developing Web analytics is generally provided by a third-
party ASP service and may also involve the use of tracking cookies like those you learned
about in Chapter 7.
Accuracy of Web Analytics
Measurements of visits, unique visitors, and other visitor actions at your Web site are based
on the interaction between your visitors’ Web browsers and the Web servers on which your
pages are stored; the availability of cookies on the visitors’ computers; the accuracy of
human programmers; and many other variables. In other words, a number of factors can
compromise the accuracy of Web analytics measurements. To gain a better understanding
of what can go wrong, let’s take a look at the problems that can arise when an e-business
tries to measure the number of unique visitors at its Web site.
As described earlier in this chapter, a unique visitor is identified by combining IP
addresses and browser identification information. One way this measurement can be flawed
is that many organizations, for security reasons, substitute a common IP address for each
of their users’ internal IP addresses and also mandate that the same browser and browser
version be used across all workstations in the organization. Consequently, all visitors to an
e-business’s Web site from an organization that has implemented these security mea-
sures would have the same IP address and browser identification—and thus would be
counted as the same unique visitor. What about visitors that are assigned dynamic IP
addresses (IP addresses that change with each session), such as visitors who are traveling
and working from their laptops? In this case, a visitor who has been assigned dynamic IP
addresses might appear to be a different unique visitor each time he or she visits your site.53
FIGURE 9-18
Page tagging process
Understanding Web Technologies
351

But the difficulty of obtaining an accurate count of unique visitors does not end there.
If your e-business uses page tagging, there’s a chance that human errors were introduced
during the development of the JavaScript instructions, and this might also distort results.
Alternatively (or in addition), your e-business may use tracking cookies to identify unique
visitors. As you learned in Chapter 7, however, many people delete tracking cookies from
their computers in an attempt to protect their privacy, and this, too, can compromise your
e-business’s ability to measure the number of unique visitors to your site.54
Analyzing visitors’ behavior at your site is useful and important, but neither server log
analysis nor page tagging can produce 100% accurate data about visitors’ behaviors at your
site. However, you can still glean useful estimates and trends from both of these meth-
ods of analysis.

“Web analytics is growing more sophisticated. We’re developing methods for understand-
ing customers, predicting trends, and assessing ROI. Every month analytics gurus amaze
you with the latest revelations to sharpen your focus and tune your spend[ing]. What no
one is telling you is that all these systems and numbers are based on inaccurate numbers.
The god of web analytics has feet of clay—100 percent accuracy is impossible.”
Brandt Dainow, CEO of ThinkMetrics, a Web analytics consulting firm
Whether you choose to use server log analysis or page tagging or a combination of both,
you can access the Web analytics products or services you need from a number of soft-
ware and service vendors.
Web Analytics Vendors
If you choose to perform server log analysis in-house, you will find it helpful to purchase
some software that is designed to interpret log event entries and create meaningful, easy-
to-understand reports from those entries. Examples of Web analytics software vendors
include Sawmill and WebTrends. If you choose a page tagging solution, you will probably
need to contract with an ASP such as DEEPMETRIX to gather, store, and report the data.
Some vendors offer both server log analysis and page tagging services for developing Web
analytics.
T I P
In the early days of e-business, a common measure of Web site performance was a hit. A hit is a recorded
event in a Web site’s server log for each element of a Web page downloaded to a viewer’s browser. For
example, if a viewer loaded a Web page with four graphics in his or her browser, the Web server would
record five hits (one for the page and one for each of the four graphics). Although early industry mea-
surements were largely devoted to the number of hits at a Web site, a hit actually bears no relationship to
the number of pages viewed or visits to a site. Indeed, a count of unique visitors is more meaningful than
the number of hits.
Chapter 9
352

Monitoring visitors’ behaviors and actions can be expensive. According to Jupiter
Research, many large e-businesses spend thousands annually to analyze visitors’ behav-
iors and actions at their Web sites, and e-businesses are projected to spend almost $1 bil-
lion on Web analytics software and services by 2009.55, 56 It is a good idea, therefore, to
consider several factors as you determine which monitoring process, software, or ser-
vice to use.57, 58
●
Carefully evaluate your Web site’s business objectives and then determine
which Web analytics measures would best be able to help you determine if your
e-business is succeeding at or failing to meet those objectives.
●
Determine what types of Web analytics reports you really need. Accumulat-
ing too many reports can result in information overload; too few reports may
not be useful. Decide if your e-business would benefit from periodic (weekly,
monthly) reporting or if you require real-time reporting.
●
Many Web analytics vendors offer product tours, sample reports, and free tri-
als of their software or services, plus free online seminars. Take advantage of
these freebies to learn more about your Web analytics options.
●
Look carefully at each of the vendors that offer the Web analytics software or
ASP services in which you are interested to determine the company’s history
and commitment to customer training and support.
●
Consider your budget constraints. Whereas an in-house software solution
might give you what you need for a one-time cost, contracting with an ASP may
involve hefty monthly fees.
No matter which Web analytics process or vendor you choose, your final challenge, of
course, is to draw useful conclusions from the Web analytics reports and then to imple-
ment the changes your Web site might need.

Before revamping its Web site, the management at RSN.com, the Web site for the RSN
cable network, wanted to be certain the plans to add personalization and customization
features to the site were on the right track. They implemented a customer relationship
management (CRM) solution to create and maintain customer profile data, and they
installed Web analytics software to monitor the behaviors of visitors to their Web site. It
wasn’t long before an analysis of this data made clear that the primary information cus-
tomers and site visitors wanted to find at the site was not what RSN.com’s management
expected. Instead of checking out multiple resorts in a given geographic area, RSN.
com’s customers and visitors wanted to see more in-depth information on the specific
resort in which they were interested. Armed with this new information, RSN.com
scrapped its plans to add personalization and customization features to its site and con-
centrated on providing more in-depth information on each of its resort partners.59

Understanding Web Technologies
353

As part of this initiative, RSN.com phased out its CRM solution and concentrated on
using its Web analytics software to gather the information it needed to improve its site.
Continued analysis of visitors’ behaviors led to more site improvements. For example,
RSN.com’s management had originally supposed that most of its visitors entered the
RSN.com Web site through the site’s home page; but Web analytics indicated that most visi-
tors bypassed the home page and went directly to other pages at the site. RSN.com’s man-
agement had also thought that around 70 percent of its site visitors were repeat visitors.
Web analytics indicated that repeat visitors represented only about 20 percent of total site
visitors. On the basis of this information, the RSN.com site was again revamped in 2004
to improve navigation and content.60
Today, visitors to RSN.com can view the Web site’s Insider’s Guide to check out hap-
penings at major resort areas, book travel packages, and buy hiking, camping, and ski-
ing gear. For a monthly fee, RSN’s resort partners can have a “minisite” at the RSN.com
Web site where they can post a resort profile, add weather reports, and post travelers’
reviews.61 RSN.com continues to use Web analytics to refine its site, and it shares these
analyses with its resort partners to help them improve the effectiveness of their minisites.
Annual sales at RSN.com, which are reported to approach $1.3 million, now make up
almost 15 percent of Resort Sports Network’s total annual revenues.62

Chapter Summary
●
A markup language is a set of rules and instructions called codes or tags, which are
embedded in a document. Markup languages are used to describe the data in a docu-
ment, specify the document’s structure and layout, and format its contents. Examples
of markup languages for the Web include XML, HTML, and XHTML.
●
The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is an ISO standard for encoding
documents so that they are transportable among computer systems. The common
markup languages used on the Web today are based on the SGML standard.
●
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML used to describe the data
in a document. XML is focused on defining the contents of a document rather than its lay-
out or format.
●
The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) was developed by Tim Berners-Lee as an
easy-to-use language for publishing information on the Web. HTML is used to specify
the layout and format of headings, text, tables, images, and other Web page elements.
Unlike XML, HTML is focused on defining the layout and format of a document’s
contents.
●
The Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is a marriage between HTML and
XML and is the current W3C standard for creating Web pages.
●
Web pages can be created from scratch by manually entering text and HTML or XHTML
tags in a text editor such as Notepad, TextPad, HTMLPad, and HomeSite.
●
Web pages can also be created in a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG)
environment. WYSIWYG-based Web authoring tools such as FrontPage and Dream-
weaver allow Web page developers to work in an environment that contains familiar menu
commands and toolbar buttons. As the Web developer creates a Web page (by add-
ing text, images, and other elements), the Web authoring software automatically enters
the corresponding HTML or XHTML tags.
●
Popular multimedia tools that can be used to lay out Web pages, edit images, and insert
animation in Web pages include Photoshop, Fireworks, FreeHand, and Flash.
●
Interactive Web page elements are created using Java applets and servlets, which are
small programs that run in a browser or on a server when a Web page is loaded. ActiveX
controls are also used to create interactive elements for Web pages.
●
JavaScript and JScript are two scripting languages used to add interactive elements to
a Web page. PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts,
and Active Server Page (ASP) are technologies that allow Web developers to create Web
page and database interactions.
●
After your Web pages are developed, they must undergo thorough testing before they
are published and made available to the public. This testing includes making sure that
all the links on the Web pages work, that data submitted through forms update the appro-
priate database, that all interactive elements function properly, and that the site passes
a “stress test” to ensure that it can handle a heavy load of customer activity.
Understanding Web Technologies
355

●
After your site “goes live,” you must then evaluate its actual performance against its busi-
ness objectives. Begin by setting measurable benchmarks for the site’s performance that
support its business objectives. Then evaluate the site’s actual performance against
these benchmarks, and, if necessary, make adjustments to fine-tune both the Web site
and future benchmarks.
●
Web analytics involves measuring and analyzing the behaviors and actions of visitors
at your site. Common Web analytics measurements include visits, unique visitors, repeat
visitors, and page views. The data for Web analytics can be gathered from Web server
logs or by page tagging.
●
Because of technological constraints and the possibility of human error, the data gath-
ered for Web analytics analyses is not 100 percent accurate; however the results of such
analyses can still provide useful and important information about estimates and trends.
●
Analysis of raw server log or page tagging data can be done in-house using Web ana-
lytics software or by contracting with an ASP that provides Web analytics gathering and
analysis services.

Case Projects
1.
You and your business partner operate a small B2C e-business and want to better under-
stand how your Web site is performing relative to the business objectives you established
as part of the Web site design process.Your business partner thinks page tagging is the best
way to develop the Web analytics you need to assess the site’s performance, but you think
server log analysis might be a better approach. Create a description of your e-business,
set the business objectives for your site, and define the target audiences for your site and
their expectations. (You may assume any information about your e-business not explic-
itly stated here.) Then, using links on the student online companion to this text plus online
search tools and other relevant sources, research the advantages and disadvantages of
using page tagging versus server log file analysis to develop the Web analytics informa-
tion for your Web site. Create a table comparing the two approaches and use the table
as a springboard to conduct a discussion with your business partner.
2.
You and your business partner have finished planning your new e-business Web site and
are ready to begin creating it. Now you need to either hire an in-house programmer or out-
source the work.You want to be certain that whomever you hire to do the work is knowledgeable
of and experienced with the latest Web development technologies. Working together with a
classmate, use information from this chapter and other relevant sources to create a checklist
you can use during interviews to assess an interviewee’s knowledge and experience using cur-
rent Web technologies.

In the late 1990s, Phil Gilmour was managing partner of Armstrong Gilmour, a Walnut
Creek, California accounting and consulting firm. A significant portion of the firm’s busi-
ness involved administering private pension funds for individual clients. Clients’ pen-
sion and investment data was stored in a company database, and clients could go online
to access the database and check the status of their 401(k) accounts.1
The portion of the business dedicated to managing the pension funds was growing
fast—too fast, as it turned out, for the database that supported it. Unable to handle the
increasing traffic, the database crashed. Fortunately, the company’s computer system
had a magnetic tape backup and so clients’ data was safe—or so Gilmour thought. When
the company attempted to restore the pension data from the backup tapes, it found the
data on the tapes was corrupted.2 The only option left was an expensive and agonizing one.
Employees at the firm had to spend long hours over the next several weeks recreating the
database manually. But the total cost of the disaster to Armstrong Gilmour may have
been much greater than just the employee time and thousands of dollars consumed by the
database restoration process. Gilmour, who eventually sold the firm, believes the com-
pany lost credibility with some of its clients after the database crash, and that this loss of
credibility ultimately resulted in millions of dollars of lost value in goodwill—a loss that
was reflected in a lower selling price.3, 4
continued

As painful as this disaster was for all concerned, there was one bright spot—Gilmour
began thinking about the other small- and medium-sized businesses that relied on mag-
netic tape to back up their critical data. He suspected that many of these businesses, like
Armstrong Gilmour, lacked the technical expertise and time to make certain their backup
tape systems were functioning properly.5 Could there be a new e-business opportunity
in Gilmour’s unfortunate experience?

As you learned in Chapters 1 through 9, becoming an e-business entrepreneur can be both
rewarding and demanding. Some of the entrepreneurial challenges you will face in set-
ting up your e-business and getting it off the ground include:
●
identifying a viable e-business idea
●
creating a business plan
●
securing funding
●
resolving legal and taxation issues
●
planning adequate office space
●
hiring key employees
●
providing secure transactions for your customers and protecting their data
●
marketing your products and services
●
making the right technology decisions for your e-business and its Web site
Operating your e-business will pose still more challenges. For example, you must be
prepared to protect your e-business’s future by managing both the general risks inherent in
operating any business and the specific risks associated with operating an e-business.
Securing your e-business to protect not only its physical assets but also its reputation and
longevity is a serious issue. Consider the variety of potential threats that your
e-business faces:
●
natural or human-made disasters such as fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake,
or terrorist attack
●
physical theft of your equipment and data storage media or electronic theft of
your customers’ data
●
business interruptions caused by vandalism of your Web site or outside attacks
on your network
●
litigation and settlement costs associated with the inappropriate use of e-mail
and the Internet by your employees
●
product or service claims against items advertised and sold via your Web site
●
lawsuits resulting from infringements of Web site-related copyrights, trade-
marks, and patents
Such threats can result not only in immediate loss of revenue, but they can also com-
promise future revenue and may result in compensatory payments to others for damages.
In short, losses from business risks such as these could threaten the very survival of your
e-business. You must, therefore, have some mechanism in place for managing the risk of
potential losses. That mechanism is risk management.
Chapter 10
366

Risk management is a process that identifies a risk of a business loss, assesses the risk’s
potential impact on the business, and then determines how to handle the risk.6 You can
use the risk management process, depicted in Figure 10-1, to protect your e-business’ assets.
Suppose, for example, that you have just purchased vital and costly computer equip-
ment, including networking equipment and individual workstations. Let’s see how you can
use the risk management process to protect your computer equipment assets against
physical risk.7
Step 1: Identify the physical risk to the new equipment. Physical risks typically include
fire, flood, and theft.
Step 2: Assess the potential impact on your e-business if you were to lose the new equip-
ment as a result of fire, flood, or theft. The most obvious cost to your e-business is the cost
of replacing the equipment. But other less obvious costs will also be incurred, such as
the loss of software and data files, plus the employee-related costs lost to the process of
restoring the software and data.
Step 3: Manage the risk. Avoiding the risk completely by not purchasing the equip-
ment in the first place or by allowing your e-business to retain all of the risk are likely not
viable options in this situation; therefore, the solution should probably involve a combi-
nation of risk management actions. For example, in addition to taking steps to reduce the
potential loss from fire, flood, and theft, you might also retain a small part of the risk and
transfer the remaining risk to someone else.
Reducing your potential loss might involve such actions as operating the network equip-
ment from a secure, locked room; installing smart card or biometric identification devices
that employees must use to enter their work areas; and installing a fire suppression
system. Retaining part of the risk and transferring the remaining portion of the risk to some-
one else might involve purchasing fire, flood, and theft insurance with a deductible (your
retained loss) that you can afford.
Risk management can help you not only protect your physical assets (cash, computer
equipment, office furniture, and buildings) from physical damage or theft, but also protect
FIGURE 10-1
Risk management process
Securing Your E-Business
367

your nonphysical assets (copyrights, trademarks, brand names, employees’ knowledge, and
goodwill) from the network-related risks to which your e-business may be exposed.
Network-related risks can be complex in nature and their repercussions potent and damaging.
For example, what if an intruder breaches your network and steals sensitive customer infor-
mation, and then uses this information to commit credit card fraud? Alternatively, what
if the intruder attempts to extort money from your e-business by threatening to expose the
theft?8 A comprehensive risk management program will include strategies for reducing the
potential loss from network risks such as these. Those strategies may include sound secu-
rity policies and procedures, network and Web site security and intruder detection pro-
grams, antivirus protection, firewalls, physical barriers to entry of the work area, a strong
employee security education program, and a risk transfer program (insurance).
As you have learned, an important component of a comprehensive risk management
program is the transfer of part or all of a risk to someone else, primarily through the pur-
chase of insurance coverage. Table 10-1 illustrates types of traditional business insur-
ance coverage, and Table 10-2 shows some of the different kinds of insurance coverage you
should consider for your e-business.

Insurance companies, such as Zurich North America and St. Paul Travelers, and insur-
ance syndicates, such as those at Lloyd’s of London, offer business insurance products
through agents and commercial insurance brokers, such as Marsh. Because of the complexi-
ties involved in identifying business risks, assessing their impact, and choosing a plan of
action, it is a good idea to secure the services of a risk management professional who is
familiar with e-business.
Most of the time, your e-business systems will run smoothly; however, there may be
times when you must deal with operational problems, or when an unexpected and uncon-
trollable outside event disrupts normal business operations. Consider, for instance, what
might happen to your e-business in the wake of a natural disaster, such as Hurricanes Kat-
rina and Rita, which struck the Gulf Coast of the U.S. in 2005, or a human-made disas-
ter, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Such events could prevent you from operating your
business for days, weeks, or even months. Preparing for the worst, for things such as a loss

of data or a sudden inability to operate your e-business as a result of errors, accidents, or
natural or human-made disasters, is another critical aspect of risk management.
B U S I N E S S
C O N T I N U I T Y
P L A N N I N G
A business continuity plan (BCP) specifies how your e-business will resume partial or
complete operations after a major disruption, such as a loss of a major vendor, serious fail-
ure of your products or services, management malfeasance, a natural disaster, or a terror-
ist attack.9 Business continuity planning includes:10
●
identifying events that might lead to a business interruption
●
assessing how disruptive events might affect your e-business
●
determining the resources you will need to maintain critical business func-
tions after disruptive events
●
developing a disaster recovery plan for critical business systems
●
establishing procedures to communicate with stakeholders (employees, cli-
ents, vendors, bankers, emergency services, local authorities, and the public)
after disruptive events
While the term “disaster recovery planning” is sometimes used interchangeably with
business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning is generally associated with the
technological aspects of a business continuity plan. Also known as contingency plan-
ning, disaster recovery planning deals with the specific resources and procedures needed to
recover from hardware failures, loss of power, loss of communications lines, or other unex-
pected and catastrophic events that interrupt the operation of your business systems.
At a minimum, a business continuity plan for your startup e-business should desig-
nate the key employees who will make up your crisis management team; specify a plan of
succession for management personnel (identify who is the next in line to assume respon-
sibilities if a manager is not available); and describe procedures for notifying all employ-
ees where to report when a disruptive event occurs after work hours. Your business
continuity plan should also provide for business-critical information to be maintained off-
site and be accessible to members of your crisis management team. This information may
include (but is not limited to) the following items:
●
backup copies of system software, software programs, and critical data files
●
instructions on how to access both paper and electronic records in off-site
storage
●
copies of electronic file backup and restore procedures
●
computer system operations manuals and service agreements
●
information on how computer network components are configured
●
emergency contact information for all members of the crisis management team
●
names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses of employees, ven-
dors, and customers
●
emergency duty rosters for employees
●
office space floor plans and lists of computer and office equipment
●
copies of lease agreements and insurance policies
●
copies of emergency service agreements with electrical, telephone, and Inter-
net service providers
Chapter 10
370

Your plan may contain other elements, such as arrangements for key employees to work
from home after a disruptive event occurs at the workplace. As an added precaution, you may
also choose to review your plan with your local emergency services personnel. If you out-
source your Web site operations to an ISP or a Web hosting company, be certain to have a
clear understanding of the ISP or hosting company’s business continuity plan and disaster
recovery procedures. The service agreement you sign should specify exactly how the con-
tractor will resume your Web site operations and recover lost data after a disruptive event.
A number of online resources, such as the Disaster Recovery Journal or InfoSysSec,
offer articles, tips, and templates for business continuity and disaster recovery planning. A
risk management professional can also help you work out the details of an effective busi-
ness continuity plan. Once you create your business continuity plan and disaster recov-
ery procedures, don’t wait for a disruptive event to see how well it all works. Instead, you
should conduct a periodic assessment of your plan’s elements so that you can reassess the
risk of disruptive events and make any necessary adjustments.
All businesses must keep both paper and electronic records of their day-to-day
activities; additionally, various state and federal regulations and laws require that a num-
ber of transaction records, such as sales tax records, be maintained. Consequently, risk
management also includes instituting policies and procedures to protect your vital busi-
ness records.

M A N A G E M E N T
Primary records consist of those records that document your key e-business activities,
such as sales transactions, order fulfillment, and payment transactions. Secondary records
include important information that is generated from e-business activities but that is not
used in daily operations. Such information includes customer data, employee data, e-mail
and instant message communications, Web server logs, and so forth. Records management
involves the planning processes and actions your e-business must take to make certain your
e-business’s primary and secondary records (whether paper or electronic) are safely
retained for an appropriate period of time, guarded against unauthorized access, and then
destroyed when—and only when—they are no longer needed.11 Typically, the records
management process includes:12
●
identifying records (paper or electronic documents, including e-mail and
instant messages that support business activities and decisions or that are
required for financial or legal purposes)
●
storing the records in an online or offline environment where they are pro-
tected against unauthorized access or damage
●
controlling access to the stored records
●
searching for needed records
T I P
Some large organizations employ a key member of the management team, sometimes called a contin-
gency planner, to manage its business continuity planning efforts.
Securing Your E-Business
371

●
maintaining records-retention schedules
●
destroying records as scheduled
With both primary and secondary records, you must determine who has access to the
records and how long the records should be retained. Making records available as needed
is critical; but restricting access to only authorized individuals helps you keep your
records from being misplaced, damaged, or stolen. The period of time business records
should be retained depends on a number of factors, including financial reporting or audit-
ing requirements, legal liability requirements, and local, state, and federal regulations and
laws. Table 10-3 contains sample retention guidelines for the most common types of busi-
ness records.13, 14

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 changed federal securities laws and put new reporting requirements on
all publicly-traded companies. Born out of the financial scandals of the early 21st century involving major
companies such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, WorldCom, and Global Crossing, Sarbanes-Oxley requires
an annual report on the effectiveness of accounting controls, including the “electronic paper trails” that pro-
vide traceable data used in financial reports.15 You can use links on the student online companion to this

Sound records management policies include procedures to secure your e-business from
the loss of a business-critical operating system, software programs, and data files. Creat-
ing an electronic backup copy of your computer software and data files can protect you from
losses resulting from processing errors, a hardware failure such as a hard disk crash, or a
catastrophic event such as a building fire. Manual recovery of data lost as the result of these
types of events can cost your e-business anywhere from a few hundred to several thou-
sand dollars.
Backup procedures can vary, depending on the size of a business. For example, a small
business may have its employees regularly back up the files stored on their own hard drives
(these may be either files that are critical to the company or files that the employees use
frequently, such as document templates) to a Zip disk, USB flash drive, CD-ROM, or mag-
netic tape. The company might assign its network administrator to be responsible for
backing up system software and data files on shared network resources, such as file serv-
ers, to magnetic tape. The backup media would then be taken to a secure off-site loca-
tion so that it is protected from fire or other catastrophes.
Very large businesses that have multiple offices connected by a network might create
an off-site backup system by copying the backup data from servers at one location to serv-
ers at other locations. Depending on the individual business’s needs, this backup could be
performed once a day or weekly. On the other hand, an e-business that needs to be able
to process online order transactions on a 24/7-basis might schedule its backup proce-
dures for critical data to run continuously, often in real time. Today, it is easier than ever
to back up system and data files by contracting with an e-business, such as USDataTrust or
EVault, and then use the Internet to back up files on off-site servers.
Scheduling and conducting regular computer system and data file backups is only one
step. You must also have procedures in place to regularly test the accuracy of the backup
procedures and the validity of the backup media. For example, you—or one of your
employees who is not involved with performing the actual backup process—should periodi-
cally attempt to retrieve and restore backed up files. This testing allows you to find out
whether your files are being backed up correctly and on schedule, and to check that the
backup media is error-free.

Any business, whether it is a traditional brick-and-mortar business, a brick-and-click
e-business, or a pure-play e-business, must be concerned about network security. The Inter-
net is a public network consisting of thousands of private computer networks that are con-
nected together in a myriad of ways. This means that your e-business’s private computer
network system is exposed to threats that may arise from anywhere on the public network.
In addition to planning for network security issues, an e-business must be concerned about
Web site security. You must always be prepared for known and unknown network and

Web site attacks—or else risk losing assets. New methods of attacking networks and Web
sites and new network security holes are being discovered with disturbing frequency. By
carefully planning your network and Web site security, you can reduce the risk of many
known and as yet unknown threats.
Another very important reason to secure your network and Web site is to protect your
e-business’s relationships with its customers. Many Web users believe that there is a large
risk to their privacy and security when they buy products and services or submit per-
sonal information online. Although this perception of risk may be greater than the actual
risk, it is still a cause for concern. Your security measures must therefore address your
customers’ perceived risks just as much as they must mitigate any actual risks.
You cannot expect to achieve perfect security for your network and your Web site, but
you must have adequate security to protect your e-business’s reputation, assets, revenue
stream, and customer privacy. Determining what level of security is adequate for an
e-business depends on the e-business’s particular situation. For example, an e-business
that uses its Web site to provide information on flavors of dog food may not require the same
level of security as an online banking Web site. You must determine your e-business’s secu-
rity needs according to potential risks, the value of the assets at risk, and the cost of
implementing a network and Web site security system.
As you might expect, securing your e-business’s network and Web site takes time, effort,
and money. But keep in mind that the potential cost to your e-business for failing to pro-
vide adequate network and Web site security can be much higher than the cost of actu-
ally providing it. In July 2005, the Computer Security Institute (CSI) announced the results
of its tenth annual Computer Crime and Security Survey, which was based on responses
from 700 security managers from financial institutions, government agencies, medical insti-
tutions, universities, and businesses. The survey was conducted in association with the
Computer Intrusion Squad of the San Francisco office of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI). The survey results, some of which are summarized below, emphasize the ongo-
ing vulnerability of organizations to computer security violations.16
●
56 percent of survey respondents experienced unauthorized uses of their com-
puter systems within the past 12 months
●
95 percent of respondents reported Web site incidents
●
respondents reported more than $130 million in estimated financial losses
According to the CSI 2005 report, more than 80 percent of reported estimated finan-
cial losses resulted from virus infections, unauthorized network access and theft of pro-
prietary information, distributed denial of service attacks, and Web site defacement.17
Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses
Computer viruses and worms are the most common network security risk facing
e-businesses today. A virus is a small program that inserts itself into other program files,
just as a virus in nature embeds itself in normal cells that become “infected.” The com-
puter virus is then spread when an infected program executes and infects other programs.
The effects of viruses are numerous and can range from being mildly annoying to
debilitating. For example, viruses can prevent computers from booting, they can erase files
or entire hard drives, and they can prevent users from being able to save or print files.
Viruses can be introduced into a network through infected files shared by network users
or through infected files attached to e-mail messages.18
Chapter 10
374

An especially problematic type of virus often introduced into a network through data
communication ports (the logical entry points into a network for incoming data) or e-mail
is a worm. A worm is a type of virus that doesn’t alter program files directly. Instead, a worm
replicates itself and often goes unnoticed until its uncontrolled replication consumes net-
work resources and thus slows down or crashes the network.19 For example, in mid-
August 2005, the Zotob worm, exploiting a vulnerability in some versions of the Windows
operating system, infected networks belonging to government agencies, media compa-
nies (CNN, ABC, The New York Times, and others), and businesses (American Express and
Caterpillar Inc.). This caused users at these organizations to experience repeated shut-
downs and reboots (restarts) of their computers.20
Mass mailing worms, like the Sobig worm (and its variants such as Sobig-A and Sobig-F)
that ran amok across the Internet in 2003 and 2004, can be especially damaging. A mass
mailing worm hijacks the e-mail address book on an infected computer and then sends
itself to all the e-mail addresses in the book; the process is repeated at each newly infected
computer. For example, during the high point of the Sobig infections in the early fall 2003,
America Online (AOL) found its e-mail traffic had almost quadrupled. In a single day,
AOL identified more than 23 million e-mail messages infected with the Sobig-F worm. Some
estimates put the damage (network downtime, lost productivity, lost revenues, and so
forth) caused by the Sobig-F worm variant alone at more than $36 billion.21
Taking its name from a story in Homer’s Iliad, a Trojan horse is a program that emu-
lates a benign program, appearing to do something useful or entertaining. However, it per-
forms harmful actions as well, such as destroying files, logging keystrokes, spreading viruses,
creating a “back door” entry point to give an intruder access to a computer system, and
so on.22 A Trojan horse can be included in an e-mail attachment or it can be attached to
downloaded software. Examples of Trojan horse programs include Trojan.Webus.I (which
creates a backdoor entry point) and PWSteal.Flecsip.B (which steals passwords).
To secure your network against viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, you should:
●
install updates or patches to your network operating system as soon as they
are available, so that you prevent viruses and worms from exploiting known
operating system vulnerabilities
●
purchase antivirus software from a major vendor, such as Symantec or McAfee;
install it on all the computers in your network, and keep the virus definition
databases updated on a regular basis; set the software’s preferences to scan
all electronic files and e-mail messages for virus, worms, and Trojan horse
threats
●
close all unused network communication ports
T I P
It is not uncommon for stories and warnings about viruses to be circulated from person to person via
e-mail. Some so-called viruses you may hear about through e-mail from your friends may be hoaxes. Most
antivirus software vendors maintain up-to-date information on viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and hoaxes.
Before you take any action as a result of a friend’s e-mail warning, check the information about the sup-
posed virus against information provided by these software vendors. Use links on the student online
companion to this text to check out the McAfee Virus Information Library, the AVP Virus Encyclopedia, and
the Symantec Security Response pages.

Unauthorized Network Access and Theft of Proprietary Information
Your e-business’s assets may be at risk from unauthorized access to network resources by
individuals outside of your company and, possibly, by your own employees, contractors,
business partners, and customers.
Hackers and Crackers
An entire glossary of words and phrases exists for identifying various network and Web secu-
rity risks. In the previous section, you learned about the security risk terms “virus,”
“worm,” and “Trojan horse.” Just as there are terms for programs that invade networks,
there are also terms for the people who access network resources without authorization.
Originally, hacker was used to describe a gifted software programmer. Because of the wide
press coverage of unauthorized network access resulting in security breaches, the term
“hacker” is now generally used for those involved in malicious unauthorized computer sys-
tem access.23 Some software programmers prefer the terms ethical hacker or white-hat
hacker to refer to hackers who use their skills to find weaknesses in computer systems and
make the weaknesses known without regard for personal gain. In contrast, they use
black-hat hacker or cracker to refer to a hacker who accesses network resources to attempt
to disrupt service, to steal valuable information (such as credit card numbers), or to cause
other damage.
The best way to recognize when a hacker is attempting unauthorized network access is
to monitor network performance. Setting up, logging, and monitoring established network ref-
erence points or benchmarks on your networks can alert you to security problems. To do this,
you will probably want the expertise of a skilled system administrator and other well-
trained technicians who know how to use benchmarks to monitor and manage the network
and servers. In addition to monitoring these benchmarks, the system administrator should
regularly monitor the Web sites of software vendors whose products your company has pur-
chased, as well as security-related Web sites (AntiOnline), blogs (Security Fix), and discus-
sion groups (CastleCops), to stay abreast of network and Web site security issues.
Other tools to prevent intruders from hacking into a network include passwords, fire-
walls, and intrusion detection systems. A password is a code used to gain access to a com-
puter network. Passwords are an effective means of preventing unauthorized network
access, but only when they are chosen and used properly. Often an employee chooses a
bad password, such as a short common word, a name or birthday of a person he or she
knows, or pet’s name, because the employee wants to be able to remember the pass-
word easily. Unfortunately, selecting a password based on this criterion—that it will be easy
to remember—can be dangerous for several reasons. For one, outside intruders or hack-
ers can penetrate a network by using software that “guesses” an authorized user’s pass-
word by trying millions of common words until one of the words is accepted. Alternatively,
someone inside an organization who is familiar with the employee may breach network
security by “guessing” the employee’s password by trying known names, birthdates, or
pet’s names. A password that is at least six characters in length and contains a mix of num-
bers as well as uppercase and lowercase letters is much more difficult to guess. Table 10-4
presents a sampling of good and poor passwords.

A firewall is software and/or hardware designed to isolate a private network from a pub-
lic network. A firewall provides an easy-to-manage entry point to the network behind it.
Firewalls can control the type of information that is allowed to pass from the public net-
work to the private network, as well as the information that passes from the private net-
work to the public network. Firewalls can also log activity to provide an audit trail in case
the network is penetrated. Figure 10-2 illustrates a firewall.

Intrusion detection is the ability to analyze real-time data to detect, log, and stop unau-
thorized network access as it happens. You can install an intrusion detection system that
monitors your network for real-time intrusions and responds to intrusions in a variety
of user-determined ways, such as sending e-mail to notify the network administrator,
recording the event for future analysis, and stopping the intrusion. Cisco’s Intrusion Detec-
tion System and Intrusion’s SecureNet Intrusion Prevention are two examples of intru-
sion detection systems.
Unauthorized or Inappropriate Network Access by Employees and Other Insiders
You may think that your e-business’s assets are at risk only from an attack on your net-
work by an outside intruder. Unfortunately, however, your e-business’s assets may also be
at risk from the unauthorized and inappropriate use of network resources by your own
employees or other e-business insiders. For a variety of reasons (for example, to establish
a work environment built on mutual trust, professionalism, and so forth), businesses typi-
cally allow insiders (consisting both of employees and contractors) to have ready access to
the business’s network and data. Often the company does not monitor the use of these
resources closely enough. Should business insiders become disgruntled, they would be able
to perpetrate a variety of potentially debilitating computer-related crimes against the busi-
ness, ranging from destroying electronic data and planting viruses to stealing the credit
card numbers of the e-business’s customers.24 If you doubt that insider-perpetrated com-
puter crime is a real threat, just visit the Department of Justice’s Computer Crime and Intel-
lectual Property Section (CCIPS) Web pages to review the wide range of real-world
computer crimes, sometimes called cybercrimes, perpetrated by organization insiders.
In addition to the risk of insiders committing computer crimes through unauthorized
network access, your e-business assets are at risk when employees and contractors access
the Internet and Web for personal reasons while they are on the job. While it may seem
innocuous, the inappropriate use of network resources can drain a firm’s general
resources, especially when the activity is widespread—which, by many indicators, it is. For
example, a June 2005 survey of more than 10,000 workers by Salary.com and AOL indi-
cated using the Internet and Web for personal use was the respondents’ number one time-
wasting activity at work.25 This means that as an e-business entrepreneur you are likely
to pay your employees thousands of wasted salary dollars. Examples of unauthorized or
inappropriate use of network resources by employees include:
●
surfing the Web to read news stories, shop, play games, and visit pornogra-
phy sites
●
sending and receiving personal e-mail messages during work hours
●
circulating offensive jokes or other material using internal e-mail or instant
messaging
●
using the business’s high-speed Internet connections to download personal
music and video files
Not only does inappropriate use of network resources reduce employee productivity,
it also increases the risk of your network becoming infected with viruses, worms, and Tro-
jan horses. Inappropriate use of network resources can consume the high-speed band-
width your e-business needs to conduct its business transactions, and, if offensive material
is involved, may place your e-business at risk for costly and embarrassing workplace
Chapter 10

harassment lawsuits. Some methods you can use to protect your e-business against the
threat of insider-related computer crime and inappropriate use are: 26
●
establishing and circulating clearly worded polices that define your users’
security-based responsibilities and describe what activities on the Internet and
Web constitute acceptable use
●
enforcing your acceptable use policies when they have been violated
●
restricting physical access to network facilities and data
●
restricting employee access to the Internet
●
installing software that monitors Internet use by your employees
At a minimum, you should publish security and acceptable use policies that detail how
and when your employees may access your network, the Internet, and the Web while at
work. Next, provide adequate explanation and training on the security and acceptable use
policies so that your employees understand them. Finally, have your employees acknowl-
edge their understanding of the security and acceptable use policies in writing. For added
security, you should make certain to restrict physical access to your network and sensi-
tive information (whether in electronic or paper form).
It may not be necessary or practical for your startup e-business to restrict Internet
access to specific key employees, but as the number of employees grows, you may con-
sider this measure. Also, at some point you may find it necessary to monitor your
employees’ network and Internet use by installing monitoring software from vendors such
as SpectorSoft and Sepama Software. This type of software can block, filter, and report on
your employees’ network, Internet, and Web activities. While measures such as monitor-
ing Internet use might seem insensitive or intrusive, their purpose is to protect your
e-business from a real threat.

“After the first week [of using an Internet-monitoring software program] I did a spread-
sheet report showing a minimum of 40 to 50 hours a week wasted, just on Internet surfing.
The report easily projected savings of more than $50,000 a year [to be achieved by reduc-
ing personal Internet surfing].”
Keith Becker, Network Administrator for Illinois Wholesale Cash Register Corporation
When considering such measures, remember one important fact: typically, the weak-
est link in any security system is the people using it. This vulnerability can take a num-
ber of different forms and be exploited in various ways. For example, intruders or hackers
often use a tried-and-true method called social engineering, which is based on the prin-
ciple that people generally want to be helpful and tend to assume the best even from
strangers. An intruder or hacker using social engineering tries to get helpful and trusting
employees to divulge passwords, open locked doors, and so forth. Another vulnerability
arises when a business’s security policy is so confusing that the employees are not able to
follow it, or they choose not to follow it because the policy makes it difficult for them to get
their work done. For example, employees might resent a policy that requires them to make
frequent changes to their passwords. It is imperative, therefore, that you make certain
Securing Your E-Business

your employees understand your security policies and procedures and are aware of any pen-
alties associated with failing to comply with them.
Distributed Denial of Service Attacks
A distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack is an attack that is designed to disable
a network by flooding it with useless traffic. To launch a DDoS, a hacker might first com-
promise multiple personal computers by installing Trojan horse programs that allow the
hacker to control these computers remotely. Then the hacker would use the compro-
mised or “zombie” computers to send a continual stream of traffic to a Web server. This
stream not only disrupts the real traffic at the Web site, but it ultimately crashes the server,
which tries to respond to the excess traffic.27 Figure 10-3 illustrates a DDoS attack.
While a DDoS attack does not do any technological damage, it can cause substantial
financial damage, because every second your e-business’s network or Web site is down can
result in lost revenues. Meanwhile, the only reward to hackers for launching DDoS attacks
seems to be the opportunity to show off their skills.
The typical measures taken to mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack include being pre-
pared to block incoming traffic from the zombie sources (assuming the sources can be
identified), having extra bandwidth and server processing capacity just in case of an attack,
and redirecting legitimate traffic to backup servers. Unfortunately, these measures can be
expensive and may not be viable options for a startup e-business operating its own
servers. If this is the case for your startup e-business, your only option may be to wait out
the attack. Given this situation, another advantage of a startup contracting its Web site
FIGURE 10-3

operation to an ISP or Web hosting company instead of operating its own servers is that the
ISP or hosting company should have the technological resources and expertise to miti-
gate a DDoS attack. If you contract with an ISP or hosting company, it is a good idea to have
DDoS protection included in the service agreement.28
E - P I O N E E R S
Service Denied
In the early days of e-business, most people who weren’t IT personnel or network
security specialists had never heard of denial of service attacks. On February 6, 2000,
all that changed, as several of the biggest names in e-business were brought to their
knees by a series of coordinated DDoS attacks. First to fall was Yahoo!, whose
main U.S. Web site and some companion sites were attacked. Next, Buy.com, eBay,
Amazon.com, CNN Interactive, and E*TRADE all experienced DDoS attacks. Each
of these attacks left technicians scrambling to filter and reroute traffic, as service at the
sites was seriously degraded or halted for one to three hours.
By tracing the attacking computers’ IP addresses, U.S. and Canadian officials
managed to identify the perpetrator of the attacks within three days: it was a Cana-
dian teenager known as Mafiaboy. It helped the investigation that Mafiaboy had
bragged about his attacks in online hacker chat rooms. In August 2000, Mafiaboy was
charged with attackingYahoo!, Amazon.com, eBay, and other Web sites in early Feb-
ruary and with gaining unauthorized access to several U.S. university computer
systems, including systems at Harvard and Duke. In January 2001, Mafiaboy pleaded
guilty to 56 counts of mischief to property and unauthorized network access, and in
September 2001, he was sentenced to eight months in a youth detention center,
one year probation, and a small fine.29 Meanwhile, the DDoS attacks he spawned
resulted in estimated financial losses of more than $1.2 billion. Why did Mafiaboy do
it? Apparently the teenager was looking to gain notoriety and prestige in the eyes of
fellow hackers.30, 31, 32
Web Site Defacement
Web site defacement or vandalism occurs when a hacker maliciously alters a Web page.33
Many businesses, colleges/universities, and government agencies have reported deface-
ment of their Web sites. In fact, in May 2005, Zone-H.org, a Web site that tracks hacking
events, reported it had recorded one million Web site defacement events in its archives.34
T I P
A “smurf” is a type of distributed denial of service attack. In a smurf attack, a network connected to the
Internet is bombarded with Packet Internet Groper (PING) messages, which are normally sent to trouble-
shoot an Internet connection. The network attempts to reply to each PING message sent, as it’s designed
to do; in the process, it becomes overloaded. By sending hundreds or thousands of PINGs, a single smurf
attacker can bring down a good-sized network.

Web site defacement causes not only embarrassment and frustration for an e-business,
but it can also have serious financial and legal repercussions. For example, in February
2000, Aastrom Biosciences, Inc., a Michigan-based medical products company, experi-
enced a serious defacement designed to manipulate its stock price. A bogus news release
announcing a merger with a California biopharmaceutical company, Geron Corporation,
was posted on Aastrom’s Web site. The result was an upward spike in both companies’
stock prices. After discovering the defacement, Aastrom notified Geron, and representa-
tives of both companies advised officials with the NASDAQ index, where both stocks are
traded, that no merger was being planned.35
Hackers might deface Web sites for any number of personal or political reasons; tak-
ing steps to secure a network against hackers also protects it against Web site defacement.36

A security audit performed by an outside auditing firm or security consulting firm can
provide you with an overall assessment of your e-business systems’ security by checking for
vulnerabilities and providing recommendations for fixing them. A security audit can also
make certain that your security efforts comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as
FDIC regulations or HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
information-exchange requirements. A typical security audit involves a review of security
policies, interviews with employees, analyses of network and operating system settings,
and research into historical network operating data. Security auditors are looking for
answers to questions such as the ones listed below.37
●
Do published security policies exist? If so, how well do employees under-
stand and comply with them?
●
How easy or difficult is it to guess passwords?
●
Are controls in place to restrict both physical and electronic access to data?
●
Have the latest patches for operating system and software programs been
installed?
●
Have systems software programs and data been backed up?
●
Where is backup media stored, who has access to it, and how current is the
last backup?
●
Does a business continuity plan exist, and who is responsible for its
implementation?
●
Have disaster recovery procedures been rehearsed?

Web site spoofing or phishing is when criminals create a fake Web site and then redirect traffic from the
legitimate Web site to the fake Web site by manipulating DNS records (IP addresses) or by luring visi-
tors into clicking e-mail links. In Chapter 5, you learned about the risks to an e-business of not protecting
its customers’ data from theft, including personal and corporate identify theft from spoofing and phishing.
Remember to remain vigilant against criminals who might steal your corporate identity and lure visitors to

Firms such as SecurityMetrics and TraceSecurity offer security auditing services.
Accounting firms that offer security audit services often follow the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) SysTrust and WebTrust audit criteria. These audit
criteria cover best business practices, site security, and customer information privacy.
Displaying the AICPA SysTrust or WebTrust seals indicates to your customers that your
computer systems and Web site have been audited and meet the specific security criteria.

Getting “Poked and Prodded”
When Bank X, located in New England, rolled out its online banking Web sites, it real-
ized that its e-business risks included more than just the various problems with net-
work software that could be handled by its IT staff. Bank X, like many other
e-businesses, understood that network and e-business risks were just as big a threat
to its assets as any other business risk and thus deserved the attention of top
management. Accordingly, Bank X involved its top management in the security pro-
cess by forming a technology risk committee that included the bank’s executive vice
president, the senior vice president, the senior vice president of retail operations, the
vice president of IT, and the chief financial officer.38
The technology risk committee realized that it was important for the bank to be
able to withstand intruders attacking its network and Web sites, and so it wanted to
know where the network and Web site security were vulnerable. To determine these
vulnerabilities and how well its network and Web sites could stand up to an attack,
in July 2000 the bank hired a security-consulting firm to perform a security audit that
included penetration testing.
First, the security-consulting firm conducted a preliminary interview with the
bank’s internal financial auditor and the vice president of IT to establish the bank’s
objectives for the security audit. These objectives included testing the security of
Bank X’s internal network and its two Web sites, which were hosted by two different
hosting companies—one that handled its customers’ online banking and one that
handled static information pages.The security firm did not ask the bank for any details
about the Web sites or its internal network because it wanted to use only publicly
available information—that is, information that would be available to potential
hackers.39
The security-consulting firm’s testing of the bank’s internal network, including its
e-mail server, indicated no problems. But tests of the security of the two hosted Web
sites resulted in a very different outcome. Waiting until the early morning hours
(when the system administrators were less likely to be monitoring their systems), the
security-consulting company began attempting to penetrate the security at the two
Web hosting companies. The company that hosted the bank’s online transaction Web
site responded quickly: within 30 minutes, it notified the bank by voice mail and by
e-mail of the attempted intrusion. Also, within 12 hours, the hosting company had
traced the attempted intrusion back to the security-consulting firm’s IP address,
found the security firm’s phone number, and called it to find out what was going on.
Bank X’s vice president of IT and the internal financial auditor were thrilled with the
hosting company’s quick identification of the attack and its systematic response to it.40

Unfortunately, the second hosting company, which hosted the bank’s static infor-
mation pages, did not detect the attack. In fact, the second hosting company was not
even aware of the attempted intrusion until the vice president of IT called with the
bad news. Although no customer transaction data was available at this part of the
bank’s site and therefore couldn’t be stolen, the vulnerability of the site to intrusion
made it susceptible to Web site defacement by hackers, which could embarrass the
bank and damage its reputation.41 As result of the security testing, the second host-
ing company upgraded its security in order to keep the bank’s business. All in all, the
bank’s management considered the cost of a security audit on its network and Web
sites to be money well spent.42
As part of a security audit, your e-business’s network and Web site may undergo a com-
prehensive penetration test. Penetration testing uses real-world hacking tools to test net-
work and Web site security. Penetration testing provides an opportunity to see how your
e-business’s network and Web site security stands up to the most current hacking tools and
techniques. Penetration testing can also measure the effectiveness of your e-business’s
intrusion detection systems and how well your employees respond to attempted intrusions.
To better simulate a real-world penetration by a hacker, it is a good idea to arrange for the
penetration testing to be conducted by outside security consultants instead of your own
employees. When you evaluate a security consultant or consulting firm who may perform
the penetration testing, consider the following actions.43
●
Ask for evidence that the security-consulting firm has liability insurance to pro-
tect against accidental damage to your network, loss of proprietary data, and
loss of revenues as a result of network downtime.
●
Have everyone on the consultant’s penetration team sign a nondisclosure
agreement.
●
Consider requiring a third-party background check on each member of the
consultant’s penetration team.
●
Decide whether it makes sense to use a security-consulting firm that employs
former hackers.
●
Determine if the consultant’s team is going to use packaged security scanning
software that could be employed by the in-house staff, or if they are using cus-
tom tools.
●
Develop a clear scope for the penetration test and a workable time frame.
●
Determine whether to have the security-consulting firm perform a DDoS
attack; if you decide to have one conducted, schedule the attack so that you
minimize the disruption to customer access.
T I P
Many organizations recognize the importance of using security audits to protect their network resources
and other assets. According to the 2005 CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey, 87 percent of
respondents reported that their organizations conducted security audits.
Chapter 10

Make sure the final security audit report includes an accounting of all the attacks
attempted and whether or not they were successful, a return of all the paper or electronic
information gathered by the security-consulting firm, and recommendations on how to fix
any problems discovered during the tests.

Because of his unfortunate experience, Phil Gilmour suspected that there was a market
for products and services that could replace the old magnetic tape-based backup/recovery
systems that were used by so many small- and medium-sized businesses. He began
researching the backup/recovery options available to businesses in this size range.
Gilmour’s research led him to a company located in the Toronto, Canada area named
VytalVault, Inc. VytalVault, Inc. provided business data backup, restore, and off-site stor-
age services, and it had recently introduced a new network backup and restore service
that could be accessed over the Internet.44 Gilmour liked VytalVault’s online backup/
restore solution so much he formed a new company named EVault to license and sell
the VytalVault service on the U.S. West Coast.
The relationship between EVault and VytalVault was successful, and in 2000 the two
companies merged, retaining the EVault name. Today, EVault has six secure storage vaults
located in the U.S. and Canada, with offices in California, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
The company provides a variety of automated online data backup and restore services for
more than 6,000 clients.45

“Right now, about 90 percent of small- and medium-sized companies don’t have off-site
data backup or they back up on tape on the premises, and then use trucks to ship those
tapes to off-site storage. What that means is that we have a huge potential market for our
products and services. SMBs [small- and medium-sized businesses] all need the basics but
they just have not paid attention to security and recovery. There is lots and lots and lots
of business out there for us.”

Chapter Summary
●
Risk management is a process that identifies a risk to your business assets, assesses
the impact of the risk on your business, and determines how to manage the risk.
●
Managing a risk can involve avoiding the risk completely, reducing the impact of the risk,
retaining all or part of the risk, or transferring the risk to someone else through the pur-
chase of insurance.
●
A business continuity plan (BCP) specifies how your e-business will resume operations
following a major disruptive event, such as a fire, flood, theft, or terrorist attack.
●
The BCP for a startup e-business should include, at a minimum, crisis management team
designations, a management succession plan, and contact procedures for notifying all
employees where to report in case a disruptive event occurs after work hours.
●
Records management involves identifying, storing, protecting, and searching for paper
and electronic records, as well as destroying records according to a records-retention
schedule.
●
Tested software and electronic data backup and restore procedures are an essential part
of records management.
●
Planning for and implementing network and Web site security can protect your
e-business’s network resources and data from being damaged or lost due to computer
viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. Network and Web site security can also protect
against threats such as unauthorized access by outside intruders; unauthorized or inap-
propriate use of systems by employees, contractors, and other insiders; DDoS attacks;
and Web site defacement attacks.
●
A virus is a destructive program that inserts itself into another program; a worm is a type
of virus that replicates itself and consumes vital network resources. A Trojan horse is a
destructive program that enters a computer by masquerading as a useful or entertain-
ing program.
●
The term “hacker” is commonly used to identify individuals who breach network secu-
rity to steal data, disrupt network services, or commit other malicious acts.To protect your
e-business against hackers, you should implement tools such as well-designed pass-
words, software or hardware firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems.
●
Insider computer crime is a serious threat that must be considered when creating secu-
rity policies and procedures. Additionally, you must consider risks to your e-business
assets from inappropriate use of your network, the Internet, and the Web by your
employees.
●
Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks involve using “zombie” computers to send
continual streams of traffic to a network with the express purpose of crashing the network.
●
Web site defacement is a type of vandalism that is not only embarrassing to the victim
firm but also may have financial or legal repercussions.
●
A security audit, which is usually conducted by an outside security-consulting firm or audit
firm, provides you with an overall assessment of your e-business system’s security vul-
nerabilities and offers recommendations for fixing them.
●
Penetration testing is a security test in which security professionals attempt to invade a
client’s network in order to identify vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.

Exercises
1.
Using online search tools or other relevant sources, research the types of computer crimes
that have been committed by outside intruders or by employees over the past three to five
years. Then create a list of these computer crimes, including a description of each crime
and its impact on the business victims. Use your list to discuss with your classmates the risks
an e-business faces from computer crimes by outside intruders or by insiders, and describe
how an e-business might protect itself against such risks.
2.
Using links on the student online companion to this text or online search tools, identify at
least three online storage service vendors. Create a table that compares the services and
prices for each vendor. Suppose you are operating a startup e-business and have decided
to use an online storage service vendor to support your system and data file backup plan.
Use the table to discuss with two classmates the advantages and disadvantages of using
each of the three vendors you researched.
3.
Using links on the student online companion to this text or other relevant resources, review
current news about Web site and network security issues. Then create an outline of topics
you find in your research. Use the outline to direct a discussion with several classmates on
the types of security issues an e-business currently faces and how it might protect itself
against them.
4.
Using online search tools or other relevant resources, locate and review case studies or
articles that provide examples of real-world security audits and penetration testing and that
give their results. Make a list of lessons to be learned from these real-world examples. Use
your list to participate in a discussion on the importance of security audits and penetra-
tion testing.
5.
Using online search tools or other relevant resources, research and identify at least two
instances in which a real-world business suffered some type of loss because it lacked sound
records management policies and procedures (including backup and restore procedures)
or because its employees failed to follow the company’s existing policies and procedures. List
the business, the type of loss, and the actions that led to the loss. Then use the list to lead
a discussion on the importance of records management.
Case Projects
1.
You are the president of a startup e-business and are concerned that your employees are
spending too much time using the Internet and the Web for personal use while they are at
work. Using online search tools or other relevant resources, research and locate a few
sample templates that businesses might use to create a policy that defines acceptable use
of the Internet and Web. Then, use your research to draft an acceptable use policy for the
Internet and Web.

2.
Business is booming for your new B2B e-business, and you need to purchase insurance to
minimize the risk of loss for both your physical and nonphysical assets.You are meeting with
your insurance professional tomorrow. Before the meeting, you want to make certain that
you can ask appropriate questions about the types of insurance available to protect your
company against both traditional business risks and risks specific to e-businesses, such as
problems with the network or Web site. Use online search tools or other relevant resources
to learn more about potential risks to your physical and nonphysical assets and the types
of insurance you might need. You may assume any information about your e-business that
has not been specifically stated here. Then create a list of talking points you can use dur-
ing the meeting.
3.
You and your B2C e-business partner have decided to hire a security-consulting firm to help
you understand network and Web site security issues and to perform a security audit includ-
ing penetration testing of your e-business’s internal network and its hosted Web site. You
are interviewing representatives from three security-consulting firms this week and want to
be prepared for each interview. Create an outline of the topics you need to discuss dur-
ing the interviews.
Team Project
You and three classmates are part of the sales team for a B2B e-business.The purchasing man-
ager for a potential major client has declined to order products through your Web site because
of security concerns. You and your sales team are meeting tomorrow with the purchasing man-
ager and the vice president of production to assure the client that there are adequate security
measures in place.
Assume that your e-business has a risk management plan, has adequate network and Web
site security, has survived a security audit, and schedules regular third-party penetration test-
ing of your network and Web site.
Working with your team, use Microsoft PowerPoint or other presentation tool to prepare a
5–10 slide presentation you can use to reassure this major client that ordering at your Web site
is safe. Then use the presentation to persuade two classmates, selected by your instructor to
pose as the target client’s purchasing manager and vice president, that ordering products online
at your Web site is safe.

F R O N T P A G E
A complete overview of how Microsoft’s Web authoring program FrontPage works and how
its many features may be used to create Web sites and Web pages is beyond the scope of this
book. However, this appendix is designed to help you gain some experience in the process
of using FrontPage—in particular, its wizard tool—to create a small-business Web site and its
related pages. A FrontPage wizard is a series of dialog boxes that lead you through the pro-
cess step by step. In this appendix, you will start FrontPage and work through a wizard’s
steps to create a Web site. After you complete the wizard steps, you will use FrontPage’s dif-
ferent views to review the new Web site and sample Web pages you’ve created.
As you have learned, a Web site consists of one or more related Web pages that are con-
nected to each other via hyperlinks. FrontPage organizes all of a Web site’s related pages in
a single folder called a FrontPage Web site. When you install FrontPage, a folder called “My
Webs” is created in the My Documents folder on your computer’s hard drive. FrontPage then
saves any new FrontPage Web site folders in the “My Webs” folder. While this is the default
setting, you can set FrontPage to save your FrontPage Web site folders in another location.
As you work through the exercises in this appendix, you will save the FrontPage Web site
folder you create in a location specified by your instructor.

As you learned in Chapter 9, working with FrontPage is similar in many ways to work-
ing with Microsoft Word, the popular word processing program. In FrontPage, you work
with menu commands, toolbar buttons, task panes, and document views that will be famil-
iar to you if you use Word.
First, you will start the FrontPage program. When you start the program, a new,
blank Web page opens in Page view. To start the FrontPage program and view the new, blank
Web page:
Step 1.
Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
Step 2.
Point to All Programs.
Step 3.
Point to Microsoft Office, if necessary.
Step 4.
Click Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003.
Step 5.
Click No if asked to make FrontPage your default editor.
FrontPage features a number of different ways to view a Web page. In Chapter 9, you
learned about the default Page view and Design sub view. The FrontPage program opens
with a blank Web page in the Page view and Design sub view. The Getting Started task pane
may also open; close it, if necessary, so that your screen looks similar to Figure A-1, which
identifies the primary elements of the FrontPage window in Page view.

Menu Bar, Standard Toolbar, and Formatting Toolbar
The menu bar, located below the title bar, has eleven drop-down menus that contain groups
of related commands. For example, the File menu contains commands for opening, clos-
ing, previewing, and printing Web pages. You can use the mouse or the keyboard to select
a command from the menu bar. In this appendix you will use the mouse to select menu bar
commands.
The Standard toolbar is located under the menu bar and contains buttons that repre-
sent the most commonly used commands. For example, the Standard toolbar contains
buttons for opening, saving, previewing, and printing a Web page. The Standard toolbar
allows you to execute a command quickly through just one click of the corresponding
button. You can customize the Standard toolbar (or any other toolbar) by adding or delet-
ing buttons.
The Formatting toolbar is located under the Standard toolbar and contains buttons that
represent commonly used formatting commands. For example, there are buttons that
enable you to modify the appearance of a Web page by changing the font, font size, and color
of its text; by aligning the Web page text horizontally; and by inserting bulleted or num-
bered lists.
Status Bar
The status bar appears at the bottom of the window, above the Windows taskbar, and it
displays messages as you work on a Web page. For example, when you open a Web page, the
status bar displays a message telling you how long it takes for the current page to down-
load in a Web browser, the page size in pixels, and other option settings.
Page Sub Views
As you learned in Chapter 9, Page view has four different sub views: Design, Split, Code,
and Preview. Buttons to switch between these views are located in the lower-left corner of
the window above the status bar, as shown in Figure A-1. The Design sub view provides a
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) environment. This allows you to create and edit
your Web pages in the Design sub view much the way you would a word-processing docu-
ment in Microsoft Word. As you create and edit a FrontPage Web page document,
FrontPage inserts the appropriate HTML codes or tags that a browser will read to display
the page. The Split sub view allows you to work in the Design sub view and, at the same time,
view the automatically inserted HTML code or tags. You use the Code sub view to exam-
ine, insert, or edit the HTML codes or tags. The Preview sub view shows how the current
Web page looks in a Web browser.

page settings, formats, and other elements. Using a FrontPage wizard or template to cre-
ate a new FrontPage Web site or Web pages saves you time because the wizard or tem-
plate automatically provides the features you would most likely use to organize your pages’
content.
Each FrontPage wizard or template is designed to create a Web site or page that serves
a specific purpose, such as building a corporate presence or providing customer support.
Because you will not be using the blank page that automatically opened when you started
FrontPage, you will close it before you view FrontPage’s various Web wizards and
templates.
To close the blank Web page and view FrontPage’s various Web wizards and templates:
Step 1.
Click the Page Close button in the upper-right area immediately above the
blank Web page to close the page.
Step 2.
Click File on the menu bar.
Step 3.
Click New to open the New task pane.
Step 4.
Click the More Web site templates link in the New task pane to open the Web
Site Templates dialog box.
The General tab in the Web Site Templates dialog box opens. In this dialog box, you
first select the desired wizard or template and then specify where the new FrontPage Web
site folder is to be saved. For this exercise, you will use the Corporate Presence Wizard and
save the folder in the location specified by your instructor. To do this, you should:
Step 5.
Click the Corporate Presence Wizard icon to select it.
Step 6.
In the text box labeled Specify the location of the new Web site:, type the loca-
tion specified by your instructor for storing your Web pages. Use the Web site
folder name “Sample_Web.” When typing the folder name, remember to
include the underscore to represent a space, but do not type the quota-
tion marks.
The dialog box on your screen should look similar to Figure A-2.
Step 7.
Click OK.
At first, the Create New Web Site box opens to show you how the creation of the new
FrontPage Web site folder will progress. In a few seconds, the first Corporate Presence
Web Wizard dialog box opens. Your dialog box should look similar to Figure A-3.
You can use the buttons at the bottom of the wizard dialog boxes to cancel the wiz-
ard, go to the next step of the wizard process, return to the previous step, or finish the wiz-
ard process. To go to the next step:
Step 1.

The eighth wizard dialog box opens. In this dialog box, you can automatically add the
elements that you would like to appear on each page at your Web site. One design objec-
tive could be to have the company logo on each page. Another design objective could be to
have navigational hyperlinks to other pages at the site. Additionally, a well-designed Web
page should include contact information for the Webmaster (the individual who manages a
Web site), a copyright notice, and the page modification date. To indicate the desired
elements:
Step 18. Click the lower Links to your main web pages check box to remove the check
mark, if necessary.

stored on a Web server. Some Web authors add incomplete Web pages to a published Web
site but mark them with some standardized text and an icon to indicate that the Web pages
are “under construction.” Other Web authors think that only completed Web pages should
be added to a published Web site. For your sample Web site, you will not include incom-
plete Web pages. To turn off the “under construction” icon:
Step 21. Click the No option button. Your dialog box should look similar to
Figure A-11.

The twelfth wizard dialog box opens. At this point, you are almost finished with the wiz-
ard steps. FrontPage can automatically create a “to do” list of tasks that help you com-
plete your Web pages. To allow FrontPage to create these task items and then to finish the
wizard:

that contains four pages. The four pages include the home page (index.htm), the feed-
back page (feedback.htm), and two products pages (prod01.htm and products.htm). You
are now ready to view the site’s structure, folders, and pages in different FrontPage views.

Creating, editing, and maintaining a FrontPage Web site consists of many related tasks. To
help manage a Web site effectively, you can create an electronic “to do” list of outstand-
ing items to be completed. When completing some actions, FrontPage can automatically add
a task to the task list for you. For example, when checking spelling in a FrontPage Web site,
you can have FrontPage create a task for each page that contains misspelled words.
You have already learned about using FrontPage’s Page view; FrontPage provides even
more ways to view and manage a Web site. For example, when you finish the wizard steps
described in the previous section, the Sample_Web site is first displayed in Tasks view. Tasks
view allows you to see and edit or create reminders for the Sample_Web “to do” list. You
can also manually add tasks to the list. Figure A-15 shows the tasks that were added dur-
ing the wizard process to the “to do” list for the Sample_Web site.
FIGURE A-14
Twelfth wizard dialog box
Creating a Web Site with Microsoft FrontPage
407

In addition to using Tasks view, you can manage your Web site through other views such
as Folders view, Remote Web site view, Reports view, Navigation view, and Hyperlinks view.
You can switch to these other views by clicking a button in the lower-left corner of the
FrontPage window above the status bar, as shown in Figure A-15. You can also switch views
by clicking a command on the View menu.
To manage the folders and files in a FrontPage Web site folder easily, you must be able
to see them. The Sample_Web site folder contains additional subfolders created by
FrontPage—for example, the _private subfolder and the images subfolder. The images sub-
folder can be used to store any picture, sound, or video files that will be featured at the
Sample_Web site. Storing these files in the images subfolder reduces the clutter in the pri-
mary Web site folder. The _private subfolder and other subfolders contain files that
FrontPage uses to manage your Web site and should be left alone. The Sample_Web in Fold-
ers view is shown in Figure A-16.

You can use Remote Web site view to work with pages that are stored in a FrontPage
Web site folder on a remote server. Reports view, as shown in Figure A-17, provides infor-
mation about the status of a Web site. For example, it summarizes the number of files that
are in the current Web site, and it indicates if the Web site contains broken hyperlinks. A
broken hyperlink is one that no longer connects to a valid location.

A FrontPage Web site consists of interrelated pages that are organized in a hierarchi-
cal structure. The home page appears at the top of the structure, and the related pages
branch out at different levels below the home page. You use Navigation view, as illustrated
in Figure A-18, to review the Web site’s organizational structure. You can modify that struc-
ture in Navigation view by adding or deleting pages, or moving pages to a new position in the
structure.

The pages in the Sample_Web site contain partial navigation bars, sets of text or but-
ton hyperlinks to other pages in the Web site, placeholders for text and graphics, and com-
ments that indicate where you should type certain text, such as the mission statement. A
default color-coordinated visual theme, such as those you learned about in Chapter 9, was
automatically applied during the wizard process.

At this point, only the basic framework for a Web site and its pages has been created.
To create a complete Web site, you would edit the individual pages to include the appro-
priate text, graphics, and links. As you do this, you might find it necessary to add new Web
pages. After you have edited existing pages and added new ones, you would then create the
final hierarchical navigational structure in Navigation view. As you can see, using a
FrontPage wizard to begin building a Web site is simply the first step in the process of cre-
ating a Web site.

After you create and edit a FrontPage Web site, your next step is to publish the site’s folder
and pages to a Web server that others can access to view your Web pages. Your instruc-
tor may provide additional information on how to publish your sample FrontPage Web site
folder and pages to a Web server.
When you are finished with the FrontPage program, you should close both the open
Web site folder and the program. If you do not close the open Web site folder, the next time
FrontPage starts, the same Web folder will reopen. To close the Sample_Web FrontPage
Web site folder and the FrontPage program:
Step 1.
Click File on the menu bar.
Step 2.
Click Close Site to close the Sample_Web site folder.
Step 3.
Click File on the menu bar.
Step 4.
