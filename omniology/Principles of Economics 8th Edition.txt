About  
the Author
N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren Professor 
of Economics at Harvard University. As a student, he 
studied economics at Princeton University and MIT. 
As a teacher, he has taught macroeconomics, microeco-
nomics, statistics, and principles of economics. He even 
spent one summer long ago as a sailing instructor on 
Long Beach Island.
Professor Mankiw is a prolific writer and a regular 
participant in academic and policy debates. His work 
has been published in scholarly journals, such as the 
American Economic Review, Journal of Political Econ-

“ 
conomics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” So wrote 
Alfred Marshall, the great 19th-century economist, in his textbook,  Principles 
of Economics. We have learned much about the economy since Marshall’s 
time, but this definition of economics is as true today as it was in 1890, when the 
first edition of his text was published.
Why should you, as a student in the 21st century, embark on the study of 
economics? There are three reasons.
The first reason to study economics is that it will help you understand the 
world in which you live. There are many questions about the economy that might 
spark your curiosity. Why are apartments so hard to find in New York City? Why 
do airlines charge less for a round-trip ticket if the traveler stays over a Saturday 
night? Why is Robert Downey, Jr., paid so much to star in movies? Why are living 
standards so meager in many African countries? Why do some countries have 
high rates of inflation while others have stable prices? Why are jobs easy to find in 
some years and hard to find in others? These are just a few of the questions that a 
course in economics will help you answer.
The second reason to study economics is that it will make you a more astute 
participant in the economy. As you go about your life, you make many economic 
decisions. While you are a student, you decide how many years to stay in school. 
Once you take a job, you decide how much of your income to spend, how much 
to save, and how to invest your savings. Someday you may find yourself running 
a small business or a large corporation, and you will decide what prices to charge 
for your products. The insights developed in the coming chapters will give you a 
new perspective on how best to make these decisions. Studying economics will 
not by itself make you rich, but it will give you some tools that may help in that 
endeavor.
The third reason to study economics is that it will give you a better understand-
ing of both the potential and the limits of economic policy. Economic questions 
are always on the minds of policymakers in mayors’ offices, governors’ mansions, 
and the White House. What are the burdens associated with alternative forms of 
taxation? What are the effects of free trade with other countries? What is the best 
way to protect the environment? How does a government budget deficit affect 
the economy? As a voter, you help choose the policies that guide the allocation of 
society’s resources. An understanding of economics will help you carry out that 
responsibility. And who knows: Perhaps someday you will end up as one of those 
policymakers yourself. 
Thus, the principles of economics can be applied in many of life’s situations. 
Whether the future finds you following the news, running a business, or sitting in 
the Oval Office, you will be glad that you studied economics.

Video Application
C
onceptClip videos help students master economics terms. These high-energy 
videos, embedded throughout the interactive book, address the known 
student challenge of understanding economics terminology when initially 
introduced to the subject matter. Developed by Professor Mike Brandl of The 
Ohio State University, these concept-based animations provide students with 
memorable context to the key 
terminology required for your 
introductory economics course.
ConceptClip Videos
V
ideo application features the book’s author 
introducing chapter content. Author Greg 
Mankiw introduces the important themes 
in every chapter by delivering a highly relevant 
deposition on the real-world context to the 
economic principles that will be appearing in  
the upcoming chapter. These videos are intended 
to motivate students to better understand how 
economics relates to their day-to-day lives and  
in the world around them. 
“I have always wanted 
supplemental material such as 
this to help me understand certain 
concepts in economics.”

Graph Builder
G
raph Builder allows students to move 
step-by-step through complex graphical 
figures. Designed specifically for 
introductory economics students, Graph 
Builder interactive exercises help students 
first understand complex graphs by 
deconstructing a graph into finite steps 
that build upon one another, then practice 
graphing by drawing out a similar scenario 
from scratch. This drawing method supports 
the kinesthetic learning approach valued by 
instructors, like you— all within the context 
of the interactive book! 
“I have not used anything  
like this before.”
“The Graph Builder is amazing! 
This would help me a lot and the 
concept is great. I think all students 
should have access to this feature 
because it would better their 
knowledge of how to make graphs.”

Adaptive Test Prep Prepares Your 
Students for High-Stakes Testing 
A
re your students constantly asking you for more 
practice questions as exam time comes closer? Do 
your students complain because the test bank-type 
questions in the exam do not have the same look and feel 
as their homework assignments?
Adaptive Test Prep is a powerful tool that uses 4,000 new 
test bank-like questions to give students almost unlimited 
practice for each chapter and section. They can take as 
many tests as they like that are immediately graded for 
them. Students see how they did and the program 
gives them immediate remediation in the form of 
very robust feedback, a link right back into the text 
where the question topic resides, and for about 
2,000 questions, they get a brief Quick Coach video 
with an instructor walking them through the exact 
question they missed!
Students can generate reports that show them 
which chapters and sections they need the most 
help on so they can tailor future practice tests 
just on the areas they are struggling with.

n writing this book, I benefited from the input of many talented people. 
 Indeed, the list of people who have contributed to this project is so long, and 
their contributions so valuable, that it seems an injustice that only a single 
name appears on the cover. 
Let me begin with my colleagues in the economics profession. The many edi-
tions of this text and its supplemental materials have benefited enormously from 
their input. In reviews and surveys, they have offered suggestions, identified 
challenges, and shared ideas from their own classroom experience. I am indebted 
to them for the perspectives they have brought to the text. Unfortunately, the list 
has become too long to thank those who contributed to previous editions, even 
though students reading the current edition are still benefiting from their insights. 
Most important in this process has been David Hakes (University of Northern 
Iowa). David, a dedicated teacher, has served as a reliable sounding board for 
ideas and is a hardworking partner with me in putting together the superb pack-
age of supplements. In addition, a special thanks to Ron Cronovich, an insightful 
instructor and trusted advisor, for his many years of consultation.  
A special thanks to the team of teaching economists who worked on the test 
bank and ancillaries for this edition, many of whom have been working on the 
Mankiw ancillaries from the beginning. To Ken McCormick for vetting the entire 
test bank (with 17,000 questions) for correctness, and to Ken Brown, Sarah Cos-
grove, Harold Elder, Michael Enz, Lisa Jepsen, Bryce Kanago, Daniel Marburger, 
Amanda Nguyen, Alicia Rosburg, Forrest Spence, and Kelvin Wong for authoring 
new questions and updating existing ones. 
The following reviewers of the seventh edition provided suggestions for 
refining the content, organization, and approach in the eighth.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The team of editors who worked on this book improved it tremendously. Jane 
Tufts, developmental editor, provided truly spectacular editing—as she always 
does. Michael Parthenakis, senior product manager, did a splendid job of over-
seeing the many people involved in such a large project. Anita Verma, senior con-
tent developer, was crucial in assembling an extensive and thoughtful group of 
reviewers to give me feedback on the previous edition, while putting together an 
excellent team to revise the supplements. Colleen Farmer, senior content project 
manager, had the patience and dedication necessary to turn my manuscript into 
this book. Kasie Jean, digital content designer and a trained economist, designed 
and implemented all of the valuable student resources in MindTap. Michelle 
Kunkler, senior art  director, gave this book its clean, friendly look.  Bruce Morser, 
the illustrator, helped make the book more visually appealing and the economics 
in it less  abstract.  Pamela  Rockwell, copyeditor, refined my prose, and Lumina 
 Datamatic’s indexer,  prepared a careful and thorough index.  John Carey, exec-
utive marketing  manager, worked long hours getting the word out to potential 
users of this book. The rest of the Cengage team has, as always, been consistently 
professional,  enthusiastic, and dedicated.
I am grateful also to Denis Fedin and Nina Vendhan, two star Harvard 
 undergraduates, who helped me refine the manuscript and check the page proofs 
for this edition.  
As always, I must thank my “in-house” editor Deborah Mankiw. As the first 
reader of most things I write, she continued to offer just the right mix of criticism 
and encouragement.
Finally, I would like to mention my three children Catherine, Nicholas, and 
 Peter. Their contribution to this book was putting up with a father spending too 
many hours in his study. The four of us have much in common—not least of 
which is our love of ice cream (which becomes apparent in Chapter 4).  
N. Gregory Mankiw

Ten Principles of Economics
CHAPTER
1
T
he word economy comes from the Greek word oikonomos, which means “one 
who manages a household.” At first, this origin might seem peculiar. But in 
fact, households and economies have much in common. 
A household faces many decisions. It must decide which household members 
do which tasks and what each member receives in return: Who cooks dinner? 
Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets to drive 
the car? In short, a household must allocate its scarce resources (time, dessert, car 
mileage) among its various members, taking into account each member’s abilities, 
efforts, and desires.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
Like a household, a society faces many decisions. It must find some way to 
 decide what jobs will be done and who will do them. It needs some people to 
grow food, other people to make clothing, and still others to design computer soft-
ware. Once society has allocated people (as well as land, buildings, and  machines) 
to various jobs, it must also allocate the goods and services they produce. It must 
decide who will eat caviar and who will eat potatoes. It must decide who will 
drive a Tesla and who will take the bus.
The management of society’s resources is important because resources are 
scarce. Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot 
produce all the goods and services people wish to have. Just as each member of 
a household cannot get everything she wants, each individual in a society cannot 
attain the highest standard of living to which she might aspire.
Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most so-
cieties, resources are allocated not by an all-powerful dictator but through the com-
bined choices of millions of households and firms. Economists, therefore, study 
how people make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much they 
save, and how they invest their savings. Economists also study how people inter-
act with one another. For instance, they examine how the multitude of buyers and 
sellers of a good together determine the price at which the good is sold and the 
quantity that is sold. Finally, economists analyze the forces and trends that affect 
the economy as a whole, including the growth in average income, the fraction of 
the population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising.
The study of economics has many facets, but it is unified by several central 
ideas. In this chapter, we look at Ten Principles of Economics. Don’t worry if you 
don’t understand them all at first or if you aren’t completely convinced. We 
 explore these ideas more fully in later chapters. The ten principles are introduced 
here to give you an overview of what economics is all about. Consider this  chapter 
a “preview of coming attractions.”

ety manages its scarce

There is no mystery to what an economy is. Whether we are talking about the 
economy of Los Angeles, the United States, or the whole world, an economy is just 
a group of people dealing with one another as they go about their lives.  Because 
the behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who make up 
the economy, we begin our study of economics with four principles about indi-
vidual decision making.
1-1a Principle 1: People Face Trade-offs
You may have heard the old saying, “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” 
Grammar aside, there is much truth to this adage. To get something that we like, 
we usually have to give up something else that we also like. Making decisions 
requires trading off one goal against another.
Consider a student who must decide how to allocate her most valuable 
 resource—her time. She can spend all of her time studying economics, spend all 
of it studying psychology, or divide it between the two fields. For every hour she 
studies one subject, she gives up an hour she could have used studying the other. 
And for every hour she spends studying, she gives up an hour she could have 
spent napping, bike riding, watching TV, or working at her part-time job for some 
extra spending money.

CHAPTER 1   TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
Consider parents deciding how to spend their family income. They can buy 
food, clothing, or a family vacation. Or they can save some of the family income 
for retirement or the children’s college education. When they choose to spend an 
extra dollar on one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on some 
other good. 
When people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of trade-offs. 
One classic trade-off is between “guns and butter.” The more a society spends on 
national defense (guns) to protect its shores from foreign aggressors, the less it can 
spend on consumer goods (butter) to raise the standard of living at home. Also 
 important in modern society is the trade-off between a clean environment and a 
high level of income. Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the cost of 
producing goods and services. Because of these higher costs, the firms end up earn-
ing smaller profits, paying lower wages, charging higher prices, or some combina-
tion of these three. Thus, while pollution regulations yield the benefit of a cleaner 
environment and the improved health that comes with it, they come at the cost of 
reducing the incomes of the regulated firms’ owners, workers, and customers.
Another trade-off society faces is between efficiency and equality. Efficiency 
means that society is getting the maximum benefits from its scarce resources. Equal-
ity means that those benefits are distributed uniformly among society’s members. In 
other words, efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and equality refers to 
how the pie is divided into individual slices. 
When government policies are designed, these two goals often conflict. Consider, 
for instance, policies aimed at equalizing the distribution of economic well-being. 
Some of these policies, such as the welfare system or unemployment insurance, 
try to help the members of society who are most in need. Others, such as the in-
dividual income tax, ask the financially successful to contribute more than others 
to support the government. Though they achieve greater equality, these policies 
reduce efficiency. When the government redistributes income from the rich to the 
poor, it reduces the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and 
produce fewer goods and services. In other words, when the government tries to 
cut the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.
Recognizing that people face trade-offs does not by itself tell us what decisions 
they will or should make. A student should not abandon the study of psychology 
just because doing so would increase the time available for the study of economics. 
Society should not stop protecting the environment just because environmental reg-
ulations reduce our material standard of living. The poor should not be ignored just 
because helping them distorts work incentives. Nonetheless, people are likely to 
make good decisions only if they understand the options that are available to them. 
Our study of economics, therefore, starts by acknowledging life’s trade-offs.
1-1b Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It
Because people face trade-offs, making decisions requires comparing the costs 
and benefits of alternative courses of action. In many cases, however, the cost of 
an action is not as obvious as it might first appear. 
Consider the decision to go to college. The main benefits are intellectual enrich-
ment and a lifetime of better job opportunities. But what are the costs? To answer 
this question, you might be tempted to add up the money you spend on tuition, 
books, room, and board. Yet this total does not truly represent what you give up 
to spend a year in college.
There are two problems with this calculation. First, it includes some things that 
are not really costs of going to college. Even if you quit school, you need a place

from its scarce resources

ing economic prosperity

PART I   INTRODUCTION
to sleep and food to eat. Room and board are costs of going to college only to the 
extent that they are more expensive at college than elsewhere. Second, this calcu-
lation ignores the largest cost of going to college—your time. When you spend 
a year listening to lectures, reading textbooks, and writing papers, you cannot 
spend that time working at a job. For most students, the earnings they give up to 
attend school are the single largest cost of their education.
The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item. When 
making any decision, decision makers should be aware of the opportunity costs 
that accompany each possible action. In fact, they usually are. College athletes 
who can earn millions if they drop out of school and play professional sports 
are well aware that their opportunity cost of attending college is very high. It is 
not surprising that they often decide that the benefit of a college education is not 
worth the cost.
1-1c Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin
Economists normally assume that people are rational. Rational people systemat-
ically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the 
available opportunities. As you study economics, you will encounter firms that 
decide how many workers to hire and how much of their product to manufacture 
and sell to maximize profits. You will also encounter individuals who decide how 
much time to spend working and what goods and services to buy with the result-
ing income to achieve the highest possible level of satisfaction.
Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but usu-
ally involve shades of gray. At dinnertime, the question you face is not “Should I 
fast or eat like a pig?” More likely, you will be asking yourself “Should I take that 
extra spoonful of mashed potatoes?” When exams roll around, your decision is 
not between blowing them off and studying 24 hours a day but whether to spend 
an extra hour reviewing your notes instead of watching TV. Economists use the 
term marginal change to describe a small incremental adjustment to an existing 
plan of action. Keep in mind that margin means “edge,” so marginal changes are 
adjustments around the edges of what you are doing. Rational people often make 
decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.
For example, suppose you are considering calling a friend on your cell phone. 
You decide that talking with her for 10 minutes would give you a benefit that you 
value at about $7. Your cell phone service costs you $40 per month plus $0.50 per 
minute for whatever calls you make. You usually talk for 100 minutes a month, 
so your total monthly bill is $90 ($0.50 per minute times 100 minutes, plus the $40 
fixed fee). Under these circumstances, should you make the call? You might be 
tempted to reason as follows: “Because I pay $90 for 100 minutes of calling each 
month, the average minute on the phone costs me $0.90. So a 10-minute call costs 
$9. Because that $9 cost is greater than the $7 benefit, I am going to skip the call.” 
That conclusion is wrong, however. Although the average cost of a 10-minute call is 
$9, the marginal cost—the amount your bill increases if you make the extra call—is 
only $5. You will make the right decision only by comparing the marginal benefit 
and the marginal cost. Because the marginal benefit of $7 is greater than the mar-
ginal cost of $5, you should make the call. This is a principle that people innately 
understand: Cell phone users with unlimited minutes (that is, minutes that are free 
at the margin) are often prone to making long and frivolous calls.
Thinking at the margin works for business decisions as well. Consider an airline 
deciding how much to charge passengers who fly standby. Suppose that flying a 
200-seat plane across the United States costs the airline $100,000. In this case, the 
opportunity cost 
whatever must be given 
up to obtain some item

CHAPTER 1   TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
average cost of each seat is $100,000/200, which is $500. One might be tempted to 
conclude that the airline should never sell a ticket for less than $500. But a ratio-
nal airline can increase its profits by thinking at the margin. Imagine that a plane 
is about to take off with 10 empty seats and a standby passenger waiting at the 
gate is willing to pay $300 for a seat. Should the airline sell the ticket? Of course 
it should. If the plane has empty seats, the cost of adding one more passenger is 
tiny. The average cost of flying a passenger is $500, but the marginal cost is merely 
the cost of the can of soda that the extra passenger will consume. As long as the 
standby passenger pays more than the marginal cost, selling the ticket is profitable.
Marginal decision making can help explain some otherwise puzzling economic 
phenomena. Here is a classic question: Why is water so cheap, while diamonds 
are so expensive? Humans need water to survive, while diamonds are unneces-
sary.  Yet people are willing to pay much more for a diamond than for a cup of 
water. The reason is that a person’s willingness to pay for a good is based on the 
marginal benefit that an extra unit of the good would yield. The marginal bene-
fit, in turn, depends on how many units a person already has. Water is essential, 
but the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small because water is plentiful. By 
contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but because diamonds are so rare, 
people consider the marginal benefit of an extra diamond to be large.
A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit of 
the action exceeds the marginal cost. This principle explains why people use their 
cell phones as much as they do, why airlines are willing to sell tickets below aver-
age cost, and why people are willing to pay more for diamonds than for water. It 
can take some time to get used to the logic of marginal thinking, but the study of 
economics will give you ample opportunity to practice.
1-1d Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives
An incentive is something (such as the prospect of a punishment or reward) that 
induces a person to act. Because rational people make decisions by comparing 
costs and benefits, they respond to incentives. You will see that incentives play 
a central role in the study of economics. One economist went so far as to suggest 
that the entire field could be summarized as simply “People respond to incen-
tives. The rest is commentary.”
Incentives are key to analyzing how markets work. For example, when the 
price of an apple rises, people decide to eat fewer apples. At the same time, apple 
orchards decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples. In other words, 
a higher price in a market provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and 
an incentive for sellers to produce more. As we will see, the influence of prices 
on the behavior of consumers and producers is crucial to how a market economy 
allocates scarce resources.
Public policymakers should never forget about incentives: Many policies change 
the costs or benefits that people face and, as a result, alter their behavior. A tax on 
gasoline, for instance, encourages people to drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. 
That is one reason people drive smaller cars in Europe, where gasoline taxes are 
high, than in the United States, where gasoline taxes are low. A higher gasoline tax 
also encourages people to carpool, take public transportation, and live closer to 
where they work. If the tax were larger, more people would be driving hybrid cars, 
and if it were large enough, they would switch to electric cars.
When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they 
often end up facing unintended consequences. For example, consider public 
policy regarding auto safety. Today, all cars have seat belts, but this was not true

PART I   INTRODUCTION
60 years ago. In 1965, Ralph Nader’s book Unsafe at Any Speed generated much 
public concern over auto safety. Congress responded with laws requiring seat 
belts as standard equipment on new cars.
How does a seat belt law affect auto safety? The direct effect is obvious: When 
a person wears a seat belt, the probability of surviving an auto accident rises. But 
that’s not the end of the story because the law also affects behavior by  altering 
 incentives. The relevant behavior here is the speed and care with which drivers op-
erate their cars. Driving slowly and carefully is costly because it uses the driver’s 
time and energy. When deciding how safely to drive, rational people compare, per-
haps unconsciously, the marginal benefit from safer driving to the marginal cost. 
As a result, they drive more slowly and carefully when the benefit of increased 
safety is high. For example, when road conditions are icy, people drive more atten-
tively and at lower speeds than they do when road conditions are clear.
Consider how a seat belt law alters a driver’s cost–benefit calculation. Seat belts 
make accidents less costly because they reduce the likelihood of injury or death. 
In other words, seat belts reduce the benefits of slow and careful driving. People 
respond to seat belts as they would to an improvement in road conditions—by 
driving faster and less carefully. The result of a seat belt law, therefore, is a larger 
number of accidents. The decline in safe driving has a clear, adverse impact on 
pedestrians, who are more likely to find themselves in an accident but (unlike the 
drivers) don’t have the benefit of added protection.
At first, this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle specu-
lation. Yet in a classic 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman argued that  auto-safety 
laws have had many of these effects. According to Peltzman’s evidence, these 
laws give rise to fewer deaths per accident but also to more accidents. He con-
cluded that the net result is little change in the number of driver deaths and an 
increase in the number of pedestrian deaths. 
Peltzman’s analysis of auto safety is an offbeat and controversial example of 
the general principle that people respond to incentives. When analyzing any pol-
icy, we must consider not only the direct effects but also the less obvious indirect 
effects that work through incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause 
people to alter their behavior.

1-2 How People Interact
The first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions. As we go 
about our lives, many of our decisions affect not only ourselves but other people 
as well. The next three principles concern how people interact with one another.
1-2a Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
You may have heard on the news that the Chinese are our competitors in the 
world economy. In some ways, this is true because American and Chinese firms 
produce many of the same goods. Companies in the United States and China 
compete for the same customers in the markets for clothing, toys, solar panels, 
automobile tires, and many other items.
Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. 
Trade between the United States and China is not like a sports contest in which 

9
CHAPTER 1   TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
one side wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between 
two countries can make each country better off. 
To see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your 
family looks for a job, she competes against members of other families who are 
looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go shop-
ping because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. In a 
sense, each family in an economy competes with all other families.
Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself 
from all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food, 
make its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much 
from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the 
activities she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. By trad-
ing with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower 
cost.
Like families, countries also benefit from the ability to trade with one another. 
Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater 
variety of goods and services. The Chinese, as well as the French, Egyptians, 
and Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our 
competitors.
1-2b  Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to  
Organize Economic Activity
The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the late 
1980s and early 1990s was one of the last century’s most transformative events. 
Communist countries operated on the premise that government officials were in 
the best position to allocate the economy’s scarce resources. These central plan-
ners decided what goods and services were produced, how much was produced, 
and who produced and consumed these goods and services. The theory behind 
central planning was that only the government could organize economic activity 
in a way that promoted economic well-being for the country as a whole.
Most countries that once had centrally planned economies have abandoned the 
system and are instead developing market economies. In a market economy, the 
decisions of a central planner are replaced by the decisions of millions of firms 
and households. Firms decide whom to hire and what to make. Households 
 decide which firms to work for and what to buy with their incomes. These firms 
and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide 
their decisions.
At first glance, the success of market economies is puzzling. In a market econ-
omy, no one is looking out for the economic well-being of society as a whole. Free 
markets contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods and services, and 
all of them are interested primarily in their own well-being. Yet despite decentral-
ized decision making and self-interested decision makers, market economies have 
proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity to promote overall 
economic well-being.
In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
economist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of economics: 
Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an “in-
visible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes. One of our goals in 
this book is to understand how this invisible hand works its magic. 
As you study economics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with 
which the invisible hand directs economic activity. In any market, buyers look at 
market economy
an economy that allocates 
resources through the 
decentralized decisions 
of many firms and house-
holds as they interact in 
markets for goods and 
services

PART I   INTRODUCTION
the price when determining how much to demand, and sellers look at the price 
when deciding how much to supply. As a result of the decisions that buyers and 
sellers make, market prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the 
cost to society of making the good. Smith’s great insight was that prices adjust to 
guide these individual buyers and sellers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, 
maximize the well-being of society as a whole.
Smith’s insight has an important corollary: When a government prevents 
prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible 
hand’s ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make 
up an economy. This corollary explains why taxes adversely affect the allocation 
of resources: They distort prices and thus the decisions of households and firms. It 
also explains the great harm caused by policies that directly control prices, such as 
rent control. And it explains the failure of communism. In communist countries, 
prices were not determined in the marketplace but were dictated by central plan-
ners. These planners lacked the necessary information about consumers’ tastes 
and producers’ costs, which in a market economy is reflected in prices. Central 
planners failed because they tried to run the economy with one hand tied behind 
their backs—the invisible hand of the marketplace.

t may be only a coincidence that Adam Smith’s great book The Wealth of 
Nations was published in 1776, the exact year in which American revolu-
tionaries signed the Declaration of Independence. But the two documents 
share a point of view that was prevalent at the time: Individuals are usu-
ally best left to their own devices, without the heavy hand of government 
guiding their actions. This political philosophy provides the intellectual 
basis for the market economy and for free society more generally. 
Why do decentralized market economies work so well? Is it because 
people can be counted on to treat one another with love and kindness? 
Not at all. Here is Adam Smith’s description of how people interact in a 
market economy:
Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is 
in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more 
likely to prevail if he can interest their 
self-love in his favour, and show 
them that it is for their own advan-
tage to do for him what he requires 
of them. . . . Give me that which I 
want, and you shall have this which 
you want, is the meaning of every 
such offer; and it is in this manner 
that we obtain from one another the 
far greater part of those good offices 
which we stand in need of. 
It is not from the 
benevolence of the 
butcher, the brewer, or 
the baker that we expect 
our dinner, but from their 
regard to their own inter-
est. We address ourselves, not 
to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own 
necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to de-
pend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens. . . . 
Every individual . . . neither intends to promote the public interest, 
nor knows how much he is promoting it. . . . He intends only his own 
gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand 
to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always 
the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own 
interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually 
than when he really intends to promote it.
Smith is saying that participants in the economy are motivated by 
self-interest and that the “invisible hand” of the marketplace guides 
this self-interest into promoting general economic well-being.
Many of Smith’s insights remain at the center of modern econom-
ics. Our analysis in the coming chapters will allow us to express Smith’s 
conclusions more precisely and to analyze more fully the strengths and 
weaknesses of the market’s invisible hand. ■

CHAPTER 1   TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
CASE 
STUDY
ADAM SMITH WOULD HAVE LOVED UBER
You have probably never lived in a centrally planned economy, but 
if you have ever tried to hail a cab in a major city, you have likely 
experienced a highly regulated market. In many cities, the local gov-
ernment imposes strict controls in the market for taxis. The rules usually go well 
beyond regulation of insurance and safety. For example, the government may 
limit entry into the market by approving only a certain number of taxi  medallions 
or permits. It may determine the prices that taxis are allowed to charge. The gov-
ernment uses its police powers—that is, the threat of fines or jail time—to keep 
unauthorized drivers off the streets and to prevent all drivers from charging un-
authorized prices. 
Recently, however, this highly controlled market has been invaded by a disrup-
tive force: Uber. Launched in 2009, this company provides an app for smartphones 
that connects passengers and drivers. Because Uber cars do not roam the streets 
looking for taxi-hailing pedestrians, they are technically not taxis and so are not 
subject to the same regulations.  But they offer much the same service. Indeed, rides 
from Uber cars are often more convenient. On a cold and rainy day, who wants to 
stand on the side of the road waiting for an empty cab to drive by?  It is more pleas-
ant to remain inside, use your smartphone to arrange for a ride, and stay warm and 
dry until the car arrives.
Uber cars often charge less than taxis, but not always. Uber allows drivers to 
raise their prices significantly when there is a surge in demand, such as during a 
sudden rainstorm or late on New Year’s Eve, when numerous tipsy partiers are 
looking for a safe way to get home. By contrast, regulated taxis are typically pre-
vented from surge pricing.
Not everyone is fond of Uber. Drivers of traditional taxis complain that this new 
competition eats into their source of income. This is hardly a surprise: Suppliers 
of goods and services usually dislike new competitors. But vigorous competition 
among producers makes a market work well for consumers.
That is why economists love Uber. A 2014 survey of several dozen prominent 
economists asked whether car services such as Uber increased consumer well- 
being. Yes, said every single economist. The economists were also asked whether 
surge pricing increased consumer well-being. Yes, said 85 percent of them. Surge 
pricing makes consumers pay more at times, but because Uber drivers respond 
to incentives, it also increases the quantity of car services supplied when they 
are most needed. Surge pricing also helps allocate the services to those consum-
ers who value them most highly and reduces the costs of searching and waiting  
for a car.
If Adam Smith were alive today, he would surely have the Uber app on his 
phone. ●
1-2c  Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes  
Improve Market Outcomes
If the invisible hand of the market is so great, why do we need government? One 
purpose of studying economics is to refine your view about the proper role and 
scope of government policy.
One reason we need government is that the invisible hand can work its magic 
only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are 
key to a market economy. Most important, market economies need institutions 
to enforce property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
A farmer won’t grow food if she expects her crop to be stolen; a restaurant won’t 
serve meals unless it is assured that customers will pay before they leave; and a 
film company won’t produce movies if too many potential customers avoid paying 
by making illegal copies. We all rely on government-provided police and courts to 
enforce our rights over the things we produce—and the invisible hand counts on 
our ability to enforce those rights.
Another reason we need government is that, although the invisible hand is 
powerful, it is not omnipotent. There are two broad rationales for a government 
to intervene in the economy and change the allocation of resources that people 
would choose on their own: to promote efficiency or to promote equality. That is, 
most policies aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is 
divided.
Consider first the goal of efficiency. Although the invisible hand usually 
leads markets to allocate resources to maximize the size of the economic pie, 
this is not always the case. Economists use the term market failure to refer to a 
situation in which the market on its own fails to produce an efficient allocation 
of resources. As we will see, one possible cause of market failure is an exter-
nality, which is the impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a by-
stander. The classic example of an externality is pollution. When the production 
of a good pollutes the air and creates health problems for those who live near 
the factories, the market left to its own devices may fail to take this cost into ac-
count. Another possible cause of market failure is market power, which refers to 
the ability of a single person or firm (or a small group) to unduly influence mar-
ket prices. For example, if everyone in town needs water but there is only one 
well, the owner of the well is not subject to the rigorous competition with which 
the invisible hand normally keeps self-interest in check; she may take  advantage 
of this  opportunity by restricting the output of water so she can charge a higher 
price. In the presence of externalities or market power, well-designed public 
policy can enhance economic efficiency.
Now consider the goal of equality. Even when the invisible hand yields 
efficient outcomes, it can nonetheless leave sizable disparities in economic 
well-being. A market economy rewards people according to their ability to pro-
duce things that other people are willing to pay for. The world’s best basketball 
player earns more than the world’s best chess player simply because people are 
willing to pay more to watch basketball than chess. The invisible hand does not 
ensure that everyone has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate health-
care. This inequality may, depending on one’s political philosophy, call for gov-
ernment intervention. In practice, many public policies, such as the income tax 
and the welfare system, aim to achieve a more equal distribution of economic 
well-being.
To say that the government can improve on market outcomes does not mean 
that it always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by a political process 
that is far from perfect. Sometimes policies are designed simply to reward the 
 politically powerful. Sometimes they are made by well-intentioned leaders who 
are not fully informed. As you study economics, you will become a better judge of 
when a government policy is justifiable because it promotes efficiency or equality 
and when it is not.

CHAPTER 1   TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
1-3 How the Economy as a Whole Works
We started by discussing how individuals make decisions and then looked at how 
people interact with one another. All these decisions and interactions together 
make up “the economy.” The last three principles concern the workings of the 
economy as a whole.
1-3a  Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on  
Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services
The differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 2014, the 
average American had an income of about $55,000. In the same year, the average 
Mexican earned about $17,000, the average Chinese about $13,000, and the aver-
age Nigerian only $6,000. Not surprisingly, this large variation in average income 
is reflected in various measures of quality of life. Citizens of high-income coun-
tries have more TV sets, more cars, better nutrition, better healthcare, and a longer 
life expectancy than citizens of low-income countries. 
Changes in living standards over time are also large. In the United States, 
incomes have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for 
changes in the cost of living). At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years. 
Over the past century, average U.S. income has risen about eightfold. 
What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and 
over time? The answer is surprisingly simple. Almost all variation in living stan-
dards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount 
of goods and services produced by each unit of labor input. In nations where 
workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per hour, most peo-
ple enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are less produc-
tive, most people endure a more meager existence. Similarly, the growth rate of a 
 nation’s productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.
The fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards is sim-
ple, but its implications are far-reaching. If productivity is the primary determinant of 
living standards, other explanations must be of secondary importance. For example, it 
might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws for the rise in living 
standards of American workers over the past century. Yet the real hero of  American 
workers is their rising productivity. As another example, some commentators have 
claimed that increased competition from Japan and other countries  explained the 
slow growth in U.S. incomes during the 1970s and 1980s. Yet the real villain was not 
competition from abroad but flagging productivity growth in the United States.
The relationship between productivity and living standards also has profound 
implications for public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect liv-
ing standards, the key question is how it will affect our ability to produce goods 
and services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity 
by ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools they need to produce 
goods and services, and have access to the best available technology.
1-3b  Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government  
Prints Too Much Money
In January 1921, a daily newspaper in Germany cost 0.30 marks. Less than two 
years later, in November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks. All 
other prices in the economy rose by similar amounts. This episode is one of his-
tory’s most spectacular examples of inflation, an increase in the overall level of 
prices in the economy.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
Although the United States has never experienced inflation even close to that 
of Germany in the 1920s, inflation has at times been an economic problem. During 
the 1970s, for instance, when the overall level of prices more than doubled, Presi-
dent Gerald Ford called inflation “public enemy number one.” By contrast, infla-
tion in the first decade of the 21st century ran about 2½ percent per year; at this 
rate, it would take almost 30 years for prices to double. Because high inflation 
imposes various costs on society, keeping inflation at a low level is a goal of eco-
nomic policymakers around the world.
What causes inflation? In almost all cases of large or persistent inflation, the 
culprit is growth in the quantity of money. When a government creates large quan-
tities of the nation’s money, the value of the money falls. In Germany in the early 
1920s, when prices were on average tripling every month, the quantity of money 
was also tripling every month. Although less dramatic, the economic history of 
the United States points to a similar conclusion: The high inflation of the 1970s 
was associated with rapid growth in the quantity of money, and the return of low 
inflation in the 1980s was associated with slower growth in the quantity of money.
1-3c  Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off  
between Inflation and Unemployment
Although a higher level of prices is, in the long run, the primary effect of increas-
ing the quantity of money, the short-run story is more complex and controversial. 
Most economists describe the short-run effects of monetary injections as follows: 
r Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level 
of spending and thus the demand for goods and services. 
r Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the 
meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a 
larger quantity of goods and services. 
r More hiring means lower unemployment. 
This line of reasoning leads to one final economy-wide trade-off: a short-run 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Although some economists still question these ideas, most accept that society 
faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This simply means 
that, over a period of a year or two, many economic policies push inflation and un-
employment in opposite directions. Policymakers face this trade-off regardless of 
whether inflation and unemployment both start out at high levels (as they did in the 
early 1980s), at low levels (as they did in the late 1990s), or someplace in between. 
This short-run trade-off plays a key role in the analysis of the business cycle—the 
irregular and largely unpredictable fluctuations in economic activity, as measured 
by the production of goods and services or the number of people employed.
Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off between inflation and un-
employment using various policy instruments. By changing the amount that the 
government spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money it prints, pol-
icymakers can influence the overall demand for goods and services. Changes in 
demand in turn influence the combination of inflation and unemployment that 
the economy experiences in the short run. Because these instruments of economic 
policy are potentially so powerful, how policymakers should use them to control 
the economy, if at all, is a subject of continuing debate.
This debate heated up in the early years of Barack Obama’s presidency. In 2008 and 
2009, the U.S. economy, as well as many other economies around the world, experi-
enced a deep economic downturn. Problems in the financial system, caused by bad

bets on the housing market, spilled over into the rest of the economy, causing  incomes 
to fall and unemployment to soar. Policymakers responded in various ways to increase 
the overall demand for goods and services. President Obama’s first major initiative 
was a stimulus package of reduced taxes and increased government spending. At 
the same time, the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, increased the supply of 
money. The goal of these policies was to reduce unemployment. Some feared, how-
ever, that these policies might over time lead to an excessive level of inflation.

CHAPTER 1   TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
7. What are the two main causes of market failure? Give 
an example of each.
8. Why is productivity important?
9. What is inflation and what causes it?
10. How are inflation and unemployment related in the 
short run?
1. Describe some of the trade-offs faced by each of the 
following:
a. a family deciding whether to buy a new car
b. a member of Congress deciding how much to 
spend on national parks
c. a company president deciding whether to open a 
new factory
d. a professor deciding how much to prepare for 
class
e. a recent college graduate deciding whether to go 
to graduate school
2. You are trying to decide whether to take a vacation. 
Most of the costs of the vacation (airfare, hotel, and 
forgone wages) are measured in dollars, but the ben-
efits of the vacation are psychological. How can you 
compare the benefits to the costs?
3. You were planning to spend Saturday working at your 
part-time job, but a friend asks you to go skiing. What 
is the true cost of going skiing? Now suppose you had 
been planning to spend the day studying at the library. 
What is the cost of going skiing in this case? Explain.
4. You win $100 in a basketball pool. You have a choice 
between spending the money now and putting it 
away for a year in a bank account that pays 5 percent 
interest. What is the opportunity cost of spending the 
$100 now?
5. The company that you manage has invested $5 million 
in developing a new product, but the development is 
not quite finished. At a recent meeting, your salespeo-
ple report that the introduction of competing products 
has reduced the expected sales of your new product to 
$3 million. If it would cost $1 million to finish devel-
opment and make the product, should you go ahead 
and do so? What is the most that you should pay to 
complete development?
6. A 1996 bill reforming the federal government’s anti-
poverty programs limited many welfare recipients to 
only two years of benefits.
a. How does this change affect the incentives for 
working?
b. How might this change represent a trade-off 
 between equality and efficiency?
7. Explain whether each of the following government 
activities is motivated by a concern about equality or a 
concern about efficiency. In the case of efficiency, dis-
cuss the type of market failure involved.
a. regulating cable TV prices
b. providing some poor people with vouchers that 
can be used to buy food
c. prohibiting smoking in public places
d. breaking up Standard Oil (which once owned  
90 percent of all oil refineries) into several smaller 
companies
e. imposing higher personal income tax rates on 
people with higher incomes
f. instituting laws against driving while intoxicated
8. Discuss each of the following statements from the 
standpoints of equality and efficiency.
a. “Everyone in society should be guaranteed the 
best healthcare possible.” 
b.  “When workers are laid off, they should be able 
to collect unemployment benefits until they find a 
new job.”
9. In what ways is your standard of living different from 
that of your parents or grandparents when they were 
your age? Why have these changes occurred?
10. Suppose Americans decide to save more of their in-
comes. If banks lend this extra saving to businesses, 
which use the funds to build new factories, how might 
this lead to faster growth in productivity? Who do you 
suppose benefits from the higher productivity? Is soci-
ety getting a free lunch?
11. During the Revolutionary War, the American colonies 
could not raise enough tax revenue to fully fund the 
war effort.  To make up the difference, the colonies 
decided to print more money. Printing money to cover 
expenditures is sometimes referred to as an “inflation 
tax.” Who do you think is being “taxed” when more 
money is printed? Why?

very field of study has its own language and its own way of thinking. 
 Mathematicians talk about axioms, integrals, and vector spaces. Psychologists 
talk about ego, id, and cognitive dissonance. Lawyers talk about venue, torts, 
and promissory estoppel.
Economics is no different. Supply, demand, elasticity, comparative advantage, 
consumer surplus, deadweight loss—these terms are part of the economist’s lan-
guage. In the coming chapters, you will encounter many new terms and some 
 familiar words that economists use in specialized ways. At first, this new  language 
may seem needlessly arcane. But as you will see, its value lies in its ability 
to provide you with a new and useful way of thinking about the 
world in which you live.
Thinking Like an Economist
CHAPTER 
2

20
PART I   INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this book is to help you learn the economist’s way of thinking. 
Just as you cannot become a mathematician, psychologist, or lawyer overnight, 
learning to think like an economist will take some time. Yet with a combination of 
theory, case studies, and examples of economics in the news, this book will give 
you ample opportunity to develop and practice this skill.
Before delving into the substance and details of economics, it is helpful to 
have an overview of how economists approach the world. This chapter discusses 
the field’s methodology. What is distinctive about how economists confront a 
question? What does it mean to think like an economist?
2-1 The Economist as Scientist
Economists try to address their subject with a scientist’s objectivity. They approach 
the study of the economy in much the same way a physicist approaches the study 
of matter and a biologist approaches the study of life: They devise theories, collect 
data, and then analyze these data in an attempt to verify or refute their theories.
To beginners, the claim that economics is a science can seem odd. After all, 
economists do not work with test tubes or telescopes. The essence of science, 
however, is the scientific method—the dispassionate development and testing of 
theories about how the world works. This method of inquiry is as applicable to 
studying a nation’s economy as it is to studying the earth’s gravity or a species’ 
evolution. As Albert Einstein once put it, “The whole of science is nothing more 
than the refinement of everyday thinking.”
Although Einstein’s comment is as true for social sciences such as economics as 
it is for natural sciences such as physics, most people are not accustomed to look-
ing at society through a scientific lens. Let’s discuss some of the ways economists 
apply the logic of science to examine how an economy works.
2-1a  The Scientific Method: Observation,  
Theory, and More Observation
Isaac Newton, the famous 17th-century scientist and mathematician, allegedly 
became intrigued one day when he saw an apple fall from a tree. This observation 
motivated Newton to develop a theory of gravity that applies not only to an apple 
falling to the earth but to any two objects in the universe. Subsequent testing of 
Newton’s theory has shown that it works well in many circumstances (albeit not 
in all circumstances, as Einstein would later show). Because Newton’s theory has 
been so successful at explaining observation, it is still taught in undergraduate 
physics courses around the world.
This interplay between theory and observation also occurs in economics. An 
economist might live in a country experiencing rapidly increasing prices and be 
moved by this observation to develop a theory of inflation. The theory might 
assert that high inflation arises when the government prints too much money. 
To test this theory, the economist could collect and analyze data on prices and 
money from many different countries. If growth in the quantity of money were 
completely unrelated to the rate of price increase, the economist would start to 
doubt the validity of this theory of inflation. If money growth and inflation were 
strongly correlated in international data, as in fact they are, the economist would 
become more confident in the theory.
Although economists use theory and observation like other scientists, they 
face an obstacle that makes their task especially challenging: In economics, 
“I’m a social scientist, 
Michael. That means  
I can’t explain electricity 
or anything like that,  
but if you ever want  
to know about people, 
I’m your man.”

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
conducting experiments is often impractical. Physicists studying gravity can 
drop many objects in their laboratories to generate data to test their theories. By 
contrast, economists studying inflation are not allowed to manipulate a nation’s 
monetary policy simply to generate useful data. Economists, like astronomers 
and evolutionary biologists, usually have to make do with whatever data the 
world happens to give them.
To find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close attention 
to the natural experiments offered by history. When a war in the Middle East inter-
rupts the supply of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the world. 
For consumers of oil and oil products, such an event depresses living standards. 
For economic policymakers, it poses a difficult choice about how best to respond. 
But for economic scientists, the event provides an opportunity to study the effects 
of a key natural resource on the world’s economies. Throughout this book, there-
fore, we consider many historical episodes. These episodes are valuable to study 
because they give us insight into the economy of the past and, more important, 
because they allow us to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of the present.
2-1b The Role of Assumptions
If you ask a physicist how long it would take a marble to fall from the top of a 
ten-story building, he will likely answer the question by assuming that the mar-
ble falls in a vacuum. Of course, this assumption is false. In fact, the building is 
surrounded by air, which exerts friction on the falling marble and slows it down. 
Yet the physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so small that its 
effect is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum simplifies the problem 
without substantially affecting the answer.
Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can sim-
plify the complex world and make it easier to understand. To study the effects of 
 international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only 
two countries and that each country produces only two goods. In reality, there 
are  numerous countries, each of which produces thousands of different types of 
goods. But by considering a world with only two countries and two goods, we 
can focus our thinking on the essence of the problem. Once we understand inter-
national trade in this simplified imaginary world, we are in a better position to 
understand international trade in the more complex world in which we live. 
The art in scientific thinking—whether in physics, biology, or economics—
is deciding which assumptions to make. Suppose, for instance, that instead of 
dropping a marble from the top of the building, we were dropping a beach ball 
of the same weight. Our physicist would realize that the assumption of no fric-
tion is less accurate in this case: Friction exerts a greater force on the beach ball 
because it is much larger than a marble. The assumption that gravity works in a 
vacuum is reasonable when studying a falling marble but not when studying a 
falling beach ball. 
Similarly, economists use different assumptions to answer different questions. 
Suppose that we want to study what happens to the economy when the govern-
ment changes the number of dollars in circulation. An important piece of this 
analysis, it turns out, is how prices respond. Many prices in the economy change 
infrequently: The newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, change only once 
every few years. Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assumptions 
when studying the effects of the policy change over different time horizons. For 
studying the short-run effects of the policy, we may assume that prices do not 
change much. We may even make the extreme and artificial assumption that

22
PART I   INTRODUCTION
all prices are completely fixed. For studying the long-run effects of the policy,  
however, we may assume that all prices are completely flexible. Just as a physicist 
uses different assumptions when studying falling marbles and falling beach balls, 
economists use different assumptions when studying the short-run and long-run 
effects of a change in the quantity of money.
2-1c Economic Models
High school biology teachers teach basic anatomy with plastic replicas of the  
human body. These models have all the major organs—the heart, the liver, the 
kidneys, and so on—which allow teachers to show their students very simply 
how the important parts of the body fit together. Because these plastic models  
are stylized and omit many details, no one would mistake one of them for a real 
person. Despite this lack of realism—indeed, because of this lack of realism—
studying these models is useful for learning how the human body works.
Economists also use models to learn about the world, but unlike plastic 
 manikins, their models mostly consist of diagrams and equations. Like a biology 
teacher’s plastic model, economic models omit many details to allow us to see 
what is truly important. Just as the biology teacher’s model does not include all 
the body’s muscles and capillaries, an economist’s model does not include every 
feature of the economy. 
As we use models to examine various economic issues throughout this book, 
you will see that all the models are built with assumptions. Just as a physicist 
begins the analysis of a falling marble by assuming away the existence of friction, 
economists assume away many details of the economy that are irrelevant to the 
question at hand. All models—in physics, biology, and economics—simplify real-
ity to improve our understanding of it.
2-1d Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram
The economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities—buying, sell-
ing, working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on. To understand how the economy 
works, we must find some way to simplify our thinking about all these activities. In 
other words, we need a model that explains, in general terms, how the economy is 
organized and how participants in the economy interact with one another.
Figure 1 presents a visual model of the economy called a circular-flow  diagram.
In this model, the economy is simplified to include only two types of decision 
makers—firms and households. Firms produce goods and services using inputs, 
such as labor, land, and capital (buildings and machines). These inputs are called 
the factors of production. Households own the factors of production and consume 
all the goods and services that the firms produce.
Households and firms interact in two types of markets. In the markets for goods 
and services, households are buyers, and firms are sellers. In particular, households 
buy the output of goods and services that firms produce. In the markets for the fac-
tors of production, households are sellers, and firms are buyers. In these markets, 
households provide the inputs that firms use to produce goods and services. The 
circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizing the economic transac-
tions that occur between households and firms in the economy. 
The two loops of the circular-flow diagram are distinct but related. The inner 
loop represents the flows of inputs and outputs. The households sell the use of 
their labor, land, and capital to the firms in the markets for the factors of pro-
duction. The firms then use these factors to produce goods and services, which 
in turn are sold to households in the markets for goods and services. The outer 
circular-flow diagram

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
loop of the diagram represents the corresponding flow of dollars. The households 
spend money to buy goods and services from the firms. The firms use some of the 
revenue from these sales to pay for the factors of production, such as the wages 
of their workers. What’s left is the profit of the firm owners, who are themselves 
members of households.
Let’s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its 
way from person to person through the economy. Imagine that the dollar begins 
at a household—say, in your wallet. If you want to buy a cup of coffee, you take 
the dollar (along with a few of its brothers and sisters) to one of the economy’s 
markets for goods and services, such as your local Starbucks coffee shop. There, 
you spend it on your favorite drink. When the dollar moves into the Starbucks 
cash register, it becomes revenue for the firm. The dollar doesn’t stay at Starbucks 
for long, however, because the firm uses it to buy inputs in the markets for the 
factors of production. Starbucks might use the dollar to pay rent to its landlord 
for the space it occupies or to pay the wages of its workers. In either case, the 
dollar enters the income of some household and, once again, is back in someone’s 
wallet. At that point, the story of the economy’s circular flow starts once again.
The circular-flow diagram in Figure 1 is a very simple model of the economy. 
A more complex and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, 
the roles of government and international trade. (A portion of that dollar you 
gave to Starbucks might be used to pay taxes or to buy coffee beans from a 
farmer in  Brazil.) Yet these details are not crucial for a basic understanding 
of how the economy is organized. Because of its simplicity, this circular-flow

Decisions are made by households and

production (where firms are buyers and 
households are sellers). The outer set of

economy fit together. 
2-1e Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier
Most economic models, unlike the circular-flow diagram, are built using the tools 
of mathematics. Here we use one of the simplest such models, called the produc-
tion possibilities frontier, to illustrate some basic economic ideas.
Although real economies produce thousands of goods and services, let’s 
consider an economy that produces only two goods—cars and computers. 
Together, the car industry and the computer industry use all of the economy’s 
factors of production. The production possibilities frontier is a graph that 
shows the various combinations of output—in this case, cars and  computers—
that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of pro-
duction and the available production technology that firms use to turn these 
factors into output.
Figure 2 shows this economy’s production possibilities frontier. If the economy 
uses all its resources in the car industry, it produces 1,000 cars and no computers. 
If it uses all its resources in the computer industry, it produces 3,000 computers 
and no cars. The two endpoints of the production possibilities frontier represent 
these extreme possibilities. 
More likely, the economy divides its resources between the two industries, pro-
ducing some cars and some computers. For example, it can produce 600 cars and 
2,200 computers, shown in the figure by point A. Or, by moving some of the fac-
tors of production to the car industry from the computer industry, the economy 
can produce 700 cars and 2,000 computers, represented by point B.
Because resources are scarce, not every conceivable outcome is feasible. For 
example, no matter how resources are allocated between the two industries, the 
economy cannot produce the amount of cars and computers represented by point C. 
Given the technology available for manufacturing cars and computers, the econ-
omy does not have enough of the factors of production to support that level of 
output. With the resources it has, the economy can produce at any point on or 
production possibilities

FIGURE 2
The Production Possibilities Frontier
The production possibilities frontier shows 
the combinations of output—in this case, 
cars and computers—that the economy can 
possibly produce. The economy can produce 
any combination on or inside the frontier. 
Points outside the frontier are not feasible 
given the economy’s resources. The slope of 
the production possibilities frontier measures 
the opportunity cost of a car in terms of com-
puters. This opportunity cost varies, depending 
on how much of the two goods the economy is 
producing.

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
inside the production possibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at points outside 
the frontier.
An outcome is said to be efficient if the economy is getting all it can from the 
scarce resources it has available. Points on (rather than inside) the production 
possibilities frontier represent efficient levels of production. When the economy 
is producing at such a point, say point A, there is no way to produce more of 
one good without producing less of the other. Point D represents an inefficient
outcome. For some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the economy is 
producing less than it could from the resources it has available: It is producing 
only 300 cars and 1,000 computers. If the source of the inefficiency is eliminated, 
the economy can increase its production of both goods. For example, if the econ-
omy moves from point D to point A, its production of cars increases from 300 to 
600, and its production of computers increases from 1,000 to 2,200.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. The production possibilities frontier shows one trade-off that society 
faces. Once we have reached an efficient point on the frontier, the only way of 
producing more of one good is to produce less of the other. When the economy 
moves from point A to point B, for instance, society produces 100 more cars at the 
expense of producing 200 fewer computers. 
This trade-off helps us understand another of the Ten Principles of Economics:
The cost of something is what you give up to get it. This is called the opportu-
nity cost. The production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost of one 
good as measured in terms of the other good. When society moves from point A to 
point B, it gives up 200 computers to get 100 additional cars. That is, at point A, the  
opportunity cost of 100 cars is 200 computers. Put another way, the opportunity 
cost of each car is two computers. Notice that the opportunity cost of a car equals 
the slope of the production possibilities frontier. (If you don’t recall what slope is, 
you can refresh your memory with the graphing appendix to this chapter.)
The opportunity cost of a car in terms of the number of computers is not con-
stant in this economy but depends on how many cars and computers the economy 
is producing. This is reflected in the shape of the production possibilities frontier. 
Because the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2 is bowed outward, the 
opportunity cost of a car is highest when the economy is producing many cars 
and few computers, such as at point E, where the frontier is steep. When the econ-
omy is producing few cars and many computers, such as at point F, the frontier is 
flatter, and the opportunity cost of a car is lower.
Economists believe that production possibilities frontiers often have this 
bowed shape. When the economy is using most of its resources to make com-
puters, the resources best suited to car production, such as skilled autoworkers, 
are being used in the computer industry. Because these workers probably aren’t 
very good at making computers, increasing car production by one unit will cause 
only a slight reduction in the number of computers produced. Thus, at point F, 
the opportunity cost of a car in terms of computers is small, and the frontier is 
relatively flat. By contrast, when the economy is using most of its resources to 
make cars, such as at point E, the resources best suited to making cars are already 
at work in the car industry. Producing an additional car means moving some of 
the best computer technicians out of the computer industry and turning them into 
autoworkers. As a result, producing an additional car requires a substantial loss 
of computer output. The opportunity cost of a car is high, and the frontier is steep.
The production possibilities frontier shows the trade-off between the outputs 
of different goods at a given time, but the trade-off can change over time. For

PART I   INTRODUCTION
example, suppose a technological advance in the computer industry raises the 
number of computers that a worker can produce per week. This advance expands 
society’s set of opportunities. For any given number of cars, the economy can now 
make more computers. If the economy does not produce any computers, it can 
still produce 1,000 cars, so one endpoint of the frontier stays the same. But if the 
economy devotes some of its resources to the computer industry, it will produce 
more computers from those resources. As a result, the production possibilities 
frontier shifts outward, as in Figure 3.
This figure illustrates what happens when an economy grows. Society can 
move production from a point on the old frontier to a point on the new fron-
tier. Which point it chooses depends on its preferences for the two goods. In this 
example, society moves from point A to point G, enjoying more computers 
(2,300 instead of 2,200) and more cars (650 instead of 600).
The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to high-
light some basic but powerful ideas: scarcity, efficiency, trade-offs, opportunity 
cost, and economic growth. As you study economics, these ideas will recur in var-
ious forms. The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of thinking 
about them.
2-1f Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
Many subjects are studied on various levels. Consider biology, for example. 
Molecular biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things. 
Cellular biologists study cells, which are made up of many chemical compounds 
and, at the same time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms. 
Evolutionary biologists study the many varieties of animals and plants and how 
species change gradually over the centuries.
Economics is also studied on various levels. We can study the decisions of indi-
vidual households and firms. Or we can study the interaction of households and 
FIGURE 3
A Shift in the Production Possibilities Frontier
A technological advance in the computer  
industry enables the economy to produce  
more computers for any given number of  
cars. As a result, the production possibilities 
frontier shifts outward. If the economy moves 
from point A to point G, then the production  
of both cars and computers increases.

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
firms in markets for specific goods and services. Or we can study the operation 
of the economy as a whole, which is the sum of the activities of all these decision 
makers in all these markets.
The field of economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields. 
Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions 
and how they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of 
 economy-wide phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent 
control on housing in New York City, the impact of foreign competition on the 
U.S. auto industry, or the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers’ 
earnings. A macroeconomist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal 
government, the changes over time in the economy’s rate of unemployment, or 
alternative policies to promote growth in national living standards. 
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are closely intertwined. Because changes 
in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of individuals, it is 
impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without considering the 
associated microeconomic decisions. For example, a macroeconomist might study 
the effect of a federal income tax cut on the overall production of goods and ser-
vices. But to analyze this issue, he must consider how the tax cut affects house-
holds’ decisions about how much to spend on goods and services. 
Despite the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the 
two fields are distinct. Because they address different questions, each field has its 
own set of models, which are often taught in separate courses. 
In what sense is economics like a science? t Draw a production possi-
bilities frontier for a society that produces food and clothing. Show an 
efficient point, an inefficient point, and an infeasible point. Show the effects of a drought. t 
Define microeconomics and macroeconomics.
2-2 The Economist as Policy Adviser
Often, economists are asked to explain the causes of economic events. Why, 
for example, is unemployment higher for teenagers than for older workers? 
Sometimes, economists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic 
outcomes. What, for instance, should the government do to improve the eco-
nomic well-being of teenagers? When economists are trying to explain the 
world, they are scientists. When they are trying to help improve it, they are 
policy advisers.
2-2a Positive versus Normative Analysis
To help clarify the two roles that economists play, let’s examine the use of lan-
guage. Because scientists and policy advisers have different goals, they use lan-
guage in different ways.
For example, suppose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws. 
Here are two statements you might hear:
 
 portia: Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.
 
 noah: The government should raise the minimum wage. 
Ignoring for now whether you agree with these statements, notice that Portia and 
Noah differ in what they are trying to do. Portia is speaking like a scientist: She

PART I   INTRODUCTION
is making a claim about how the world works. Noah is speaking like a policy 
 adviser: He is making a claim about how he would like to change the world.
In general, statements about the world come in two types. One type, such as 
 Portia’s, is positive. Positive statements are descriptive. They make a claim about 
how the world is. A second type of statement, such as Noah’s, is normative. Norma-
tive statements are prescriptive. They make a claim about how the world ought to be. 
A key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge 
their validity. We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by ex-
amining evidence. An economist might evaluate Portia’s statement by analyzing 
data on changes in minimum wages and changes in unemployment over time. By 
contrast, evaluating normative statements involves values as well as facts. Noah’s 
statement cannot be judged using data alone. Deciding what is good or bad policy 
is not just a matter of science. It also involves our views on ethics, religion, and 
political philosophy.
Positive and normative statements are fundamentally different, but within a 
person’s set of beliefs, they are often intertwined. In particular, positive views 
about how the world works affect normative views about what policies are desir-
able. Portia’s claim that the minimum wage causes unemployment, if true, might 
lead her to reject Noah’s conclusion that the government should raise the mini-
mum wage. Yet normative conclusions cannot come from positive analysis alone; 
they involve value judgments as well.
As you study economics, keep in mind the distinction between positive and 
normative statements because it will help you stay focused on the task at hand. 
Much of economics is positive: It just tries to explain how the economy works. Yet 
those who use economics often have normative goals: They want to learn how to 
improve the economy. When you hear economists making normative statements, 
you know they are speaking not as scientists but as policy advisers.
2-2b Economists in Washington
President Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist. 
When he asked his economists for advice, they always answered, “On the one 
hand, . . . . On the other hand, . . . .“
Truman was right in realizing that economists’ advice is not always straight-
forward. This tendency is rooted in one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People 
face trade-offs. Economists are aware that trade-offs are involved in most policy 
decisions. A policy might increase efficiency at the cost of equality. It might help 
future generations but hurt current generations. An economist who says that all 
policy decisions are easy or clear-cut is an economist not to be trusted.
Truman was not the only president who relied on the advice of economists. 
Since 1946, the president of the United States has received guidance from the 
Council of Economic Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff of 
a few dozen economists. The council, whose offices are just a few steps from the 
White House, has no duty other than to advise the president and to write the an-
nual Economic Report of the President, which discusses recent developments in the 
economy and presents the council’s analysis of current policy issues. 
The president also receives input from economists in many administrative 
 departments. Economists at the Office of Management and Budget help formu-
late spending plans and regulatory policies. Economists at the Department of the 
 Treasury help design tax policy. Economists at the Department of Labor analyze 
data on workers and those looking for work to help formulate labor-market policies. 
Economists at the Department of Justice help enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
Economists are also found outside the administrative branch of government. 
To obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the 
advice of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists. The 
Federal Reserve, the institution that sets the nation’s monetary policy, employs 
hundreds of economists to analyze economic developments in the United States 
and throughout the world.
The influence of economists on policy goes beyond their role as advisers: Their 
research and writings often affect policy indirectly. Economist John Maynard 
Keynes offered this observation:
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right 
and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. 
Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves 
to be quite exempt from intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some 
defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distill-
ing their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.
These words were written in 1935, but they remain true today. Indeed, the “aca-
demic scribbler” now influencing public policy is often Keynes himself.
2-2c Why Economists’ Advice Is Not Always Followed
Any economist who advises presidents or other elected leaders knows that his 
recommendations are not always heeded. Frustrating as this can be, it is easy to 
understand. The process by which economic policy is actually made differs in 
many ways from the idealized policy process assumed in economics textbooks. 
Throughout this text, whenever we discuss economic policy, we often focus on 
one question: What is the best policy for the government to pursue? We act as if 
policy were set by a benevolent king. Once the king figures out the right policy, he 
has no trouble putting his ideas into action.
In the real world, figuring out the right policy is only part of a leader’s job, 
sometimes the easiest part. After a president hears from his economic advisers 
about what policy is best from their perspective, he turns to other advisers for 
related input. His communications advisers will tell him how best to explain the 
proposed policy to the public, and they will try to anticipate any misunderstand-
ings that might make the challenge more difficult. His press advisers will tell him 
how the news media will report on his proposal and what opinions will likely 
be expressed on the nation’s editorial pages. His legislative affairs advisers will 
tell him how Congress will view the proposal, what amendments members of 
 Congress will suggest, and the likelihood that Congress will pass some version of 
the president’s proposal into law. His political advisers will tell him which groups 
will organize to support or oppose the proposed policy, how this proposal will 
affect his standing among different groups in the electorate, and whether it will 
change support for any of the president’s other policy initiatives. After hearing 
and weighing all this advice, the president then decides how to proceed.
Making economic policy in a representative democracy is a messy affair—
and there are often good reasons why presidents (and other politicians) do not 
 advance the policies that economists advocate. Economists offer crucial input to 
the policy process, but their advice is only one ingredient of a complex recipe. 
Give an example of a positive statement and an example of a normative 
statement that somehow relates to your daily life. t Name three parts of 
government that regularly rely on advice from economists.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
“If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.” This 
quip from George Bernard Shaw is revealing. Economists as a group are often 
criticized for giving conflicting advice to policymakers. President Ronald Reagan 
once joked that if the game Trivial Pursuit were designed for economists, it would 
have 100 questions and 3,000 answers.
Why do economists so often appear to give conflicting advice to policymakers? 
There are two basic reasons:
r Economists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories of 
how the world works.
r Economists may have different values and therefore different normative 
views about what government policy should aim to accomplish.
Let’s discuss each of these reasons.
2-3a Differences in Scientific Judgments
Several centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was 
at the center of the solar system. More recently, climatologists have debated 
whether the earth is experiencing global warming and, if so, why. Science is an 
ongoing search to understand the world around us. It is not surprising that as 
the search continues, scientists sometimes disagree about the direction in which 
truth lies.
Economists often disagree for the same reason. Economics is a young science, 
and there is still much to be learned. Economists sometimes disagree because they 
have different hunches about the validity of alternative theories or about the size 
of important parameters that measure how economic variables are related.
For example, economists disagree about whether the government should tax a 
household’s income or its consumption (spending). Advocates of a switch from 
the current income tax to a consumption tax believe that the change would en-
courage households to save more because income that is saved would not be 
taxed. Higher saving, in turn, would free resources for capital accumulation, 
leading to more rapid growth in productivity and living standards. Advocates of 
the current income tax system believe that household saving would not respond 
much to a change in the tax laws. These two groups of economists hold different 
normative views about the tax system because they have different positive views 
about saving’s responsiveness to tax incentives.
2-3b Differences in Values
Suppose that Peter and Paula both take the same amount of water from the town 
well. To pay for maintaining the well, the town taxes its residents. Peter has  
income of $150,000 and is taxed $15,000, or 10 percent of his income. Paula has 
income of $30,000 and is taxed $6,000, or 20 percent of her income. 
Is this policy fair? If not, who pays too much and who pays too little? Does it 
matter whether Paula’s low income is due to a medical disability or to her deci-
sion to pursue an acting career? Does it matter whether Peter’s high income is due 
to a large inheritance or to his willingness to work long hours at a dreary job?
These are difficult questions about which people are likely to disagree. If the 
town hired two experts to study how it should tax its residents to pay for the well, 
we would not be surprised if they offered conflicting advice.

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
This simple example shows why economists sometimes disagree about public 
policy. As we know from our discussion of normative and positive analysis, pol-
icies cannot be judged on scientific grounds alone. Sometimes, economists give 
conflicting advice because they have different values. Perfecting the science of 
economics will not tell us whether Peter or Paula pays too much. 
2-3c Perception versus Reality
Because of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values, some 
disagreement among economists is inevitable. Yet one should not overstate the 
amount of disagreement. Economists agree with one another to a much greater 
extent than is sometimes understood. 
Table 1 contains twenty propositions about economic policy. In surveys of 
professional economists, these propositions were endorsed by an overwhelming 
Proposition (and percentage of economists who agree)
 1.  A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available. (93%)
 2.  Tariffs and import quotas usually reduce general economic welfare. (93%)
 3.  Flexible and floating exchange rates offer an effective international monetary arrangement. 
(90%)
 4.  Fiscal policy (for example, tax cut and/or government expenditure increase) has a 
significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy. (90%)
 5.  The United States should not restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries. 
(90%)
 6.  Economic growth in developed countries like the United States leads to greater levels of 
well-being. (88%)
 7.  The United States should eliminate agricultural subsidies. (85%)
 8.  An appropriately designed fiscal policy can increase the long-run rate of capital formation. 
(85%)
 9.  Local and state governments should eliminate subsidies to professional sports franchises. 
(85%)
10.  If the federal budget is to be balanced, it should be done over the business cycle rather 
than yearly. (85%)
11.  The gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainably large 
within the next 50 years if current policies remain unchanged. (85%)
12.  Cash payments increase the welfare of recipients to a greater degree than do transfers-in-
kind of equal cash value. (84%)
13.  A large federal budget deficit has an adverse effect on the economy. (83%)
14.  The redistribution of income in the United States is a legitimate role for the government. 
(83%)
15.  Inflation is caused primarily by too much growth in the money supply. (83%)
16.  The United States should not ban genetically modified crops. (82%)
17.  A minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers. (79%)
18.  The government should restructure the welfare system along the lines of a “negative 
income tax.” (79%)
19.  Effluent taxes and marketable pollution permits represent a better approach to pollution 
control than the imposition of pollution ceilings. (78%)
20.  Government subsidies on ethanol in the United States should be reduced or eliminated. (78%)

PART I   INTRODUCTION
majority of respondents. Most of these propositions would fail 
to command a similar consensus among the public. 
The first proposition in the table is about rent control, a policy  
that sets a legal maximum on the amount landlords can charge 
for their apartments. Almost all economists believe that rent 
control adversely affects the availability and quality of housing 
and is a costly way of helping the neediest members of society. 
Nonetheless, many city governments ignore the advice of econ-
omists and place ceilings on the rents that landlords may charge 
their tenants.
The second proposition in the table concerns tariffs and  
import quotas, two policies that restrict trade among nations. 
For reasons we discuss more fully later in this text, almost all 
economists oppose such barriers to free trade. Nonetheless, 
over the years, presidents and Congress have chosen to  restrict 
the import of certain goods.
Why do policies such as rent control and trade barriers per-
sist if the experts are united in their opposition? It may be that 
the realities of the political process stand as immovable obsta-
cles. But it also may be that economists have not yet convinced 
enough of the public that these policies are undesirable. One 
purpose of this book is to help you understand the economist’s 
view on these and other subjects and, perhaps, to persuade you 
that it is the right one.
As you read the book, you will occasionally see small boxes called “Ask the 
Experts.” These are based on the IGM Economics Experts Panel, an ongoing sur-
vey of several dozen of the world’s most prominent economists. Every few weeks, 
these experts are offered a proposition and then asked whether they agree with it, 
disagree with it, or are uncertain. The results in these boxes will give you a sense 
of when economists are united, when they are divided, and when they just don’t 
know what to think. 
You can see an example here regarding the resale of tickets to entertainment 
and sporting events. Lawmakers sometimes try to prohibit reselling tickets, or 
“scalping” as it is sometimes called. The survey results show that many econo-
mists side with the scalpers rather than the lawmakers.
Why might economic advisers to the president disagree about a question 
of policy?

excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economist 
must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, 
statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and 
speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, 
and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study 
the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of 
man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard. He must be 
purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorrupt-
ible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician.
This is a tall order. But with practice, you will become more and more accustomed 
to thinking like an economist.

address, the former president of the Fed-

case for studying economics.
The Dismal Science? Hardly!
By Robert D. McTeer, Jr.
M
y take on training in economics is that 
it becomes increasingly valuable as you 
move up the career ladder. I can’t imagine a 
better major for corporate CEOs, congressmen, 
or American presidents. You’ve learned a sys-
tematic, disciplined way of thinking that will 
serve you well. By contrast, the economically 
challenged must be perplexed about how it is 
that economies work better the fewer people 
they have in charge. Who does the planning? 
Who makes decisions? Who decides what to 
produce? 
For my money, Adam Smith’s invisible hand 
is the most important thing you’ve learned by 
studying economics. You understand how we 
can each work for our own self-interest and 
still produce a desirable social outcome. You 
know how uncoordinated activity gets coordi-
nated by the market to enhance the wealth of 
nations. You understand the magic of markets 
and the dangers of tampering with them too 
much. You know better what you first learned in 
kindergarten: that you shouldn’t kill or cripple 
the goose that lays the golden eggs. . . . 
Economics training will help you under-
stand fallacies and unintended consequences. 
In fact, I am inclined to define economics as 
the study of how to anticipate unintended con-
sequences. . . .
Little in the literature seems more relevant to 
contemporary economic debates than what usu-
ally is called the broken window fallacy. Whenever 
a government program is justified not on its mer-
its but by the jobs it will create, remember the 
broken window: Some teenagers, being the little 
beasts that they are, toss a brick through a bak-
ery window. A crowd gathers and laments, “What 
a shame.” But before you know it, someone sug-
gests a silver lining to the situation: Now the 
baker will have to spend money to have the win-
dow repaired. This will add to the income of the 
repairman, who will spend his additional income, 
which will add to another seller’s income, and so 
on. You know the drill. The chain of spending will 
multiply and generate higher income and em-
ployment. If the broken window is large enough, it 
might produce an economic boom! . . .
Most voters fall for the broken window fallacy, 
but not economics majors. They will say, “Hey, 
wait a minute!” If the baker hadn’t spent his 
money on window repair, he would have spent it 
on the new suit he was saving to buy. Then the 
tailor would have the new income to spend, and 
so on. The broken window didn’t create net new 
spending; it just diverted spending from some-
where else. The broken window does not create 
new activity, just different activity. People see the 
activity that takes place. They don’t see the activ-
ity that would have taken place.
The broken window fallacy is perpetuated in 
many forms. Whenever job creation or retention 
is the primary objective I call it the job-count-
ing fallacy. Economics majors understand the 
non-intuitive reality that real progress comes 
from job destruction. It once took 90 percent of 
our population to grow our food. Now it takes 3 
percent. Pardon me,  Willie, but are we worse off 
because of the job losses in agriculture? The 
would-have-been farmers are now college pro-
fessors and computer gurus. . . .
So instead of counting jobs, we should make 
every job count. We will occasionally hit a soft 
spot when we have a mismatch of supply and 
demand in the labor market. But that is tem-
porary. Don’t become a Luddite and destroy the 
machinery, or become a protectionist and try to 
grow bananas in New York City. ■

SUMMARY
r Economists try to address their subject with a scien-

r The field of economics is divided into two subfields: 
microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microecono-

the marketplace. Macroeconomists study the forces 
and trends that affect the economy as a whole. 
r A positive statement is an assertion about how the 
world is. A normative statement is an assertion about 
how the world ought to be. When economists make 
normative statements, they are acting more as policy 
 advisers than as scientists.
r Economists who advise policymakers sometimes offer 
conflicting advice either because of differences in sci-
entific judgments or because of differences in values. 
At other times, economists are united in the advice 
they offer, but policymakers may choose to ignore 
the advice because of the many forces and constraints 
 imposed by the political process.

PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS
1. Draw a circular-flow diagram. Identify the parts of the 
model that correspond to the flow of goods and ser-
vices and the flow of dollars for each of the following 
activities.
a. Selena pays a storekeeper $1 for a quart of milk.
b. Stuart earns $8 per hour working at a fast-food 
restaurant.
c. Shanna spends $40 to get a haircut.
d. Salma earns $20,000 from her 10 percent owner-
ship of Acme Industrial.
2. Imagine a society that produces military goods and 
consumer goods, which we’ll call “guns” and “butter.”
a. Draw a production possibilities frontier for guns 
and butter. Using the concept of opportunity 
cost, explain why it most likely has a bowed-out 
shape.
b. Show a point that is impossible for the economy 
to achieve. Show a point that is feasible but 
inefficient.
c. Imagine that the society has two political parties, 
called the Hawks (who want a strong military) 
and the Doves (who want a smaller military). 
Show a point on your production possibilities 
frontier that the Hawks might choose and a point 
that the Doves might choose.
d. Imagine that an aggressive neighboring country 
reduces the size of its military. As a result, both 
the Hawks and the Doves reduce their desired 
production of guns by the same amount. Which 
party would get the bigger “peace dividend,” 
measured by the increase in butter production? 
Explain.
3. The first principle of economics discussed in  
Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs. Use a  
production possibilities frontier to illustrate society’s 
trade-off between two “goods”—a clean environment 
and the quantity of industrial output. What do you 
suppose determines the shape and position of the 
frontier? Show what happens to the frontier if  
engineers develop a new way of producing electricity 
that emits fewer pollutants.
4. An economy consists of three workers: Larry, Moe, 
and Curly. Each works 10 hours a day and can pro-
duce two services: mowing lawns and washing cars. 
In an hour, Larry can either mow one lawn or wash 
one car; Moe can either mow one lawn or wash two 
cars; and Curly can either mow two lawns or wash 
one car. 
a. Calculate how much of each service is produced 
under the following circumstances, which we  
label A, B, C, and D:
r All three spend all their time mowing lawns. (A)
r All three spend all their time washing cars. (B)
r All three spend half their time on each  
activity. (C)
r Larry spends half his time on each activity, while 
Moe only washes cars and Curly only mows 
lawns. (D)
b. Graph the production possibilities frontier for this 
economy. Using your answers to part a, identify 
points A, B, C, and D on your graph. 
c. Explain why the production possibilities frontier 
has the shape it does.

Graphing: A Brief Review
Many of the concepts that economists study can be expressed with numbers—the 
price of bananas, the quantity of bananas sold, the cost of growing bananas, and 
so on. Often, these economic variables are related to one another: When the price 
of bananas rises, people buy fewer bananas. One way of expressing the relation-
ships among variables is with graphs. 
Graphs serve two purposes. First, when developing economic theories, graphs 
offer a visual way to express ideas that might be less clear if described with equa-
tions or words. Second, when analyzing economic data, graphs provide a power-
ful way of finding and interpreting patterns. Whether we are working with theory 
or with data, graphs provide a lens through which a recognizable forest emerges 
from a multitude of trees.
Numerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as 
there are many ways to express a thought in words. A good writer chooses words 
that will make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic. An 
effective economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand. 
In this appendix, we discuss how economists use graphs to study the mathe-
matical relationships among variables. We also discuss some of the pitfalls that 
can arise in the use of graphical methods.
Graphs of a Single Variable
Three common graphs are shown in Figure A-1. The pie chart in panel (a) shows 
how total income in the United States is divided among the sources of income, 
including compensation of employees, corporate profits, and so on. A slice of 
the pie represents each source’s share of the total. The bar graph in panel (b) 
compares income in four countries. The height of each bar represents the 
average income in each country. The time-series graph in panel (c) traces the ris-
ing productivity in the U.S. business sector over time. The height of the line 
shows output per hour in each year. You have probably seen similar graphs in 
newspapers and magazines.
Graphs of Two Variables: The Coordinate System
The three graphs in Figure A-1 are useful in showing how a variable changes 
over time or across individuals, but they are limited in how much they can tell 
us. These graphs display information only about a single variable. Economists 
are often concerned with the relationships between variables. Thus, they need to 
display two variables on a single graph. The coordinate system makes this possible. 
Suppose you want to examine the relationship between study time and grade 
point average. For each student in your class, you could record a pair of numbers: 
hours per week spent studying and grade point average. These numbers could then 
be placed in parentheses as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on the graph. 
Albert E., for instance, is represented by the ordered pair (25 hours/week, 3.5 GPA),

PART I   INTRODUCTION
while his “what-me-worry?” classmate Alfred E. is represented by the ordered pair 
(5 hours/week, 2.0 GPA). 
We can graph these ordered pairs on a two-dimensional grid. The first number 
in each ordered pair, called the x-coordinate, tells us the horizontal location of the 
point. The second number, called the y-coordinate, tells us the vertical location of the 
point. The point with both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of zero is known as 
the origin. The two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the point is  located 
in relation to the origin: x units to the right of the origin and y units above it.
Figure A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Albert E., Alfred E., 
and their classmates. This type of graph is called a scatter plot because it plots 
The pie chart in panel (a) shows how U.S. national income is derived from various sources. The 
bar graph in panel (b) compares the average income in four countries. The time-series graph in 
panel (c) shows the productivity of labor in U.S. businesses over time.

scattered points. Looking at this graph, we immediately notice that points farther 
to the right (indicating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicating a better 
grade point average). Because study time and grade point average typically move 
in the same direction, we say that these two variables have a positive correlation. 
By contrast, if we were to graph party time and grades, we would likely find that 
higher party time is associated with lower grades. Because these variables typi-
cally move in opposite directions, we say that they have a negative correlation. In 
either case, the coordinate system makes the correlation between two variables 
easy to see. 
Curves in the Coordinate System
Students who study more do tend to get higher grades, but other factors also 
influence a student’s grades. Previous preparation is an important factor, for 
instance, as are talent, attention from teachers, even eating a good breakfast. 
A scatter plot like Figure A-2 does not attempt to isolate the effect that study-
ing has on grades from the effects of other variables. Often, however, econo-
mists prefer looking at how one variable affects another, holding everything else 
constant.
To see how this is done, let’s consider one of the most important graphs in eco-
nomics: the demand curve. The demand curve traces out the effect of a good’s price 
on the quantity of the good consumers want to buy. Before showing a demand 
curve, however, consider Table A-1, which shows how the number of novels that 
Emma buys depends on her income and on the price of novels. When novels are 
cheap, Emma buys them in large quantities. As they become more expensive, she 
instead borrows books from the library or chooses to go to the movies rather than 
read. Similarly, at any given price, Emma buys more novels when she has a higher 
income. That is, when her income increases, she spends part of the additional 
income on novels and part on other goods.
We now have three variables—the price of novels, income, and the number of 
novels purchased—which is more than we can represent in two dimensions. To 
put the information from Table A-1 in graphical form, we need to hold one of 
the three variables constant and trace out the relationship between the other two. 
Because the demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity 
demanded, we hold Emma’s income constant and show how the number of nov-
els she buys varies with the price of novels. 
TABLE A-1
Novels Purchased by Emma 
This table shows the number of novels  
Emma buys at various incomes and prices. 
For any given level of income, the data 
on price and quantity demanded can be 
graphed to produce Emma’s demand curve 
for novels, as shown in Figures A-3 and A-4.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
Suppose that Emma’s income is $40,000 per year. If we place the number of 
novels Emma purchases on the x-axis and the price of novels on the y-axis, we can 
graphically represent the middle column of Table A-1. When the points that rep-
resent these entries from the table—(5 novels, $10), (9 novels, $9), and so on—are 
connected, they form a line. This line, pictured in Figure A-3, is known as Emma’s 
demand curve for novels; it tells us how many novels Emma purchases at any 
given price, holding income constant. The demand curve is downward-sloping, 
indicating that a higher price reduces the quantity of novels demanded. Because 
the quantity of novels demanded and the price move in opposite directions, we 
say that the two variables are negatively related. (Conversely, when two variables 
move in the same direction, the curve relating them is upward-sloping, and we 
say that the variables are positively related.)
Now suppose that Emma’s income rises to $50,000 per year. At any given price, 
Emma will purchase more novels than she did at her previous level of income. 
Just as earlier we drew Emma’s demand curve for novels using the entries from 
the middle column of Table A-1, we now draw a new demand curve using the 
entries from the right column of the table. This new demand curve (curve D2) is 
pictured alongside the old one (curve D1) in Figure A-4; the new curve is a similar 
line drawn farther to the right. We therefore say that Emma’s demand curve for 
novels shifts to the right when her income increases. Likewise, if Emma’s income 
were to fall to $30,000 per year, she would buy fewer novels at any given price 
and her demand curve would shift to the left (to curve D3).
In economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve 
and shifts of a curve. As we can see from Figure A-3, if Emma earns $40,000 per 
year and novels cost $8 apiece, she will purchase 13 novels per year. If the price of 
The line D1 shows how Emma’s  
purchases of novels depend on the 
price of novels when her income is 
held constant. Because the price and 
the quantity demanded are negatively 
related, the demand curve slopes 
downward.

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
novels falls to $7, Emma will increase her purchases of novels to 17 per year. The 
demand curve, however, stays fixed in the same place. Emma still buys the same 
number of novels at each price, but as the price falls, she moves along her demand 
curve from left to right. By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 but 
her income rises to $50,000, Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16 
per year. Because Emma buys more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts 
out, as shown in Figure A-4.
There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve: When a rel-
evant variable that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts. Income is on 
neither the x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma’s income changes, 
her demand curve must shift. The same is true for any change that affects Emma’s 
purchasing habits, with the sole exception of a change in the price of novels. If, 
for instance, the public library closes and Emma must buy all the books she wants 
to read, she will demand more novels at each price, and her demand curve will 
shift to the right. Or if the price of movies falls and Emma spends more time at the 
movies and less time reading, she will demand fewer novels at each price, and her 
demand curve will shift to the left. By contrast, when a variable on an axis of the 
graph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the change as a movement along 
the curve. 
Slope
One question we might want to ask about Emma is how much her purchasing 
habits respond to price. Look at the demand curve pictured in Figure A-5. If this 
curve is very steep, Emma purchases nearly the same number of novels regardless 
The location of Emma’s demand 
curve for novels depends on how 
much income she earns. The more 
she earns, the more novels she will 
purchase at any given price, and the 
farther to the right her demand curve 
will lie. Curve D1 represents Emma’s 
original demand curve when her 
income is $40,000 per year. If her 
income rises to $50,000 per year, 
her demand curve shifts to D2. If her 
income falls to $30,000 per year, her 
demand curve shifts to D3.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
of whether they are cheap or expensive. If this curve is much flatter, the number 
of novels Emma purchases is more sensitive to changes in the price. To answer 
questions about how much one variable responds to changes in another variable, 
we can use the concept of slope.
The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to the horizontal 
distance covered as we move along the line. This definition is usually written out 
in mathematical symbols as follows:
slope 5
Δy ,
Δx
where the Greek letter Δ (delta) stands for the change in a variable. In other 
words, the slope of a line is equal to the “rise” (change in y) divided by the 
“run” (change in x). The slope will be a small positive number for a fairly flat 
 upward-sloping line, a large positive number for a steep upward-sloping line, 
and a negative number for a downward-sloping line. A horizontal line has a 
slope of zero because in this case the y-variable never changes; a vertical line is 
said to have an infinite slope because the y-variable can take any value without 
the x-variable changing at all.
What is the slope of Emma’s demand curve for novels? First of all, because the 
curve slopes down, we know the slope will be negative. To calculate a numerical 
value for the slope, we must choose two points on the line. With Emma’s income 
at $40,000, she will purchase 21 novels at a price of $6 or 13 novels at a price of 
$8. When we apply the slope formula, we are concerned with the change between 
these two points. In other words, we are concerned with the difference between 
To calculate the slope of the demand 
curve, we can look at the changes in 
the x- and y-coordinates as we move 
from the point (21 novels, $6) to the 
point (13 novels, $8). The slope of 
the line is the ratio of the change in 
the y-coordinate (−2) to the change  
in the x-coordinate (+8), which 
equals −¼.

Figure A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works. Try computing the 
slope of Emma’s demand curve using two different points. You should get exactly 
the same result, −¼. One of the properties of a straight line is that it has the same 
slope everywhere. This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper in 
some places than in others.
The slope of Emma’s demand curve tells us something about how responsive her 
purchases are to changes in the price. A small slope (a number close to zero) means 
that Emma’s demand curve is relatively flat; in this case, she adjusts the number of 
novels she buys substantially in response to a price change. A larger slope (a number 
farther from zero) means that Emma’s demand curve is relatively steep; in this case, 
she adjusts the number of novels she buys only slightly in response to a price change. 
Cause and Effect
Economists often use graphs to advance an argument about how the economy 
works. In other words, they use graphs to argue about how one set of events 
causes another set of events. With a graph like the demand curve, there is no doubt 
about cause and effect. Because we are varying price and holding all other vari-
ables constant, we know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in the 
quantity Emma demands. Remember, however, that our demand curve came 
from a hypothetical example. When graphing data from the real world, it is often 
more difficult to establish how one variable affects another.
The first problem is that it is difficult to hold everything else constant when 
studying the relationship between two variables. If we are not able to hold other 
variables constant, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing 
changes in the other variable when those changes are actually being caused by a 
third omitted variable not pictured on the graph. Even if we have identified the cor-
rect two variables to look at, we might run into a second problem—reverse causality. 
In other words, we might decide that A causes B when in fact B causes A. The 
omitted-variable and reverse-causality traps require us to proceed with caution 
when using graphs to draw conclusions about causes and effects.
Omitted Variables  To see how omitting a variable can lead to a deceptive graph, 
let’s consider an example. Imagine that the government, spurred by public

PART I   INTRODUCTION
concern about the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions an exhaus-
tive study from Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother examines many 
of the items found in people’s homes to see which of them are associated with the 
risk of cancer. Big Brother reports a strong relationship between two variables: the 
number of cigarette lighters that a household owns and the probability that some-
one in the household will develop cancer. Figure A-6 shows this relationship. 
What should we make of this result? Big Brother advises a quick policy 
response. It recommends that the government discourage the ownership of ciga-
rette lighters by taxing their sale. It also recommends that the government require 
warning labels: “Big Brother has determined that this lighter is dangerous to your 
health.” 
In judging the validity of Big Brother’s analysis, one question is key: Has Big 
Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under consideration? 
If the answer is no, the results are suspect. An easy explanation for Figure A-6 is 
that people who own more cigarette lighters are more likely to smoke cigarettes 
and that cigarettes, not lighters, cause cancer. If Figure A-6 does not hold constant 
the amount of smoking, it does not tell us the true effect of owning a cigarette 
lighter. 
This story illustrates an important principle: When you see a graph used to 
support an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether the 
movements of an omitted variable could explain the results you see.
Reverse Causality  Economists can also make mistakes about causality by 
misreading its direction. To see how this is possible, suppose the Association 
of American Anarchists commissions a study of crime in America and arrives 
at Figure A-7, which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand people 
in major cities against the number of police officers per thousand people. The 
anarchists note the curve’s upward slope and argue that because police increase 
rather than decrease the amount of urban violence, law enforcement should be 
abolished.
If we could run a controlled experiment, we would avoid the danger of  reverse 
causality. To run an experiment, we would randomly assign different numbers 
of police to different cities and then examine the correlation between police and 
crime. Figure A-7, however, is not based on such an experiment. We simply 
The upward-sloping curve shows  
that members of households with 
more cigarette lighters are more  
likely to develop cancer. Yet we

CHAPTER 2   THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST
observe that more dangerous cities have more police officers. The explanation for 
this may be that more dangerous cities hire more police. In other words, rather 
than police causing crime, crime may cause police. Nothing in the graph itself 
allows us to establish the direction of causality.
It might seem that an easy way to determine the direction of causality is to 
examine which variable moves first. If we see crime increase and then the  police 
force expand, we reach one conclusion. If we see the police force expand and then 
crime increase, we reach the other. This approach, however, is also flawed: Often, 
people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present con-
ditions but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions. A 
city that expects a major crime wave in the future, for instance, might hire more 
police now. This problem is even easier to see in the case of babies and minivans. 
Couples often buy a minivan in anticipation of the birth of a child. The minivan 
comes before the baby, but we wouldn’t want to conclude that the sale of mini-
vans causes the population to grow!
There is no complete set of rules that says when it is appropriate to draw causal 
conclusions from graphs. Yet just keeping in mind that cigarette lighters don’t 
cause cancer (omitted variable) and that minivans don’t cause larger families 
(reverse causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economic arguments.
The upward-sloping curve shows that 
cities with a higher concentration of 
police are more dangerous. Yet the 
graph does not tell us whether police 
cause crime or crime-plagued cities 
hire more police.

Interdependence  
and the Gains  
from Trade
C
onsider your typical day. You wake up in the morning and pour yourself juice 
from oranges grown in Florida and coffee from beans grown in Brazil. Over 
breakfast, you read a newspaper written in  New York on a tablet  made in 
China. You get dressed in clothes made of cotton grown in Georgia and sewn in fac-
tories in Thailand. You drive to class in a car made of parts manufactured in more 
than a dozen countries around the world. Then you open up your economics text-
book written by an author living in Massachusetts, published by a company located 
in Ohio, and printed on paper made from trees grown in Oregon.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
Every day, you rely on many people, most of whom you have never met, to 
provide you with the goods and services that you enjoy. Such interdependence 
is possible because people trade with one another. Those people providing you 
with goods and services are not acting out of generosity. Nor is some govern-
ment agency directing them to satisfy your desires. Instead, people provide you 
and other consumers with the goods and services they produce because they get 
something in return. 
In subsequent chapters, we examine how an economy coordinates the activi-
ties of millions of people with varying tastes and abilities. As a starting point for 
this analysis, in this chapter we consider the reasons for economic interdepen-
dence. One of the Ten Principles of Economics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade 
can make everyone better off. We now examine this principle more closely. What 
 exactly do people gain when they trade with one another? Why do people choose 
to become interdependent?
The answers to these questions are key to understanding the modern global 
economy. Most countries today import from abroad many of the goods and ser-
vices they consume, and they export to foreign customers many of the goods and 
services they produce. The analysis in this chapter explains interdependence not 
only among individuals but also among nations. As we will see, the gains from 
trade are much the same whether you are buying a haircut from your local barber 
or a T-shirt made by a worker on the other side of the globe.
3-1 A Parable for the Modern Economy
To understand why people choose to depend on others for goods and services and 
how this choice improves their lives, let’s examine a simple economy. Imagine that 
there are only two goods in the world: meat and potatoes. And there are only two 
people in the world: a cattle rancher named Ruby and a potato farmer named Frank. 
Both Ruby and Frank would like to eat a diet of both meat and potatoes.
The gains from trade are most obvious if Ruby can produce only meat and 
Frank can produce only potatoes. In one scenario, Frank and Ruby could choose 
to have nothing to do with each other. But after several months of eating beef 
roasted, boiled, broiled, and grilled, Ruby might decide that self-sufficiency is 
not all it’s cracked up to be. Frank, who has been eating potatoes mashed, fried, 
baked, and scalloped, would likely agree. It is easy to see that trade would allow 
both of them to enjoy greater variety: Each could then have a steak with a baked 
potato or a burger with fries.
Although this scene illustrates most simply how everyone can benefit from 
trade, the gains would be similar if Frank and Ruby were each capable of produc-
ing the other good, but only at great cost. Suppose, for example, that Ruby is able 
to grow potatoes but her land is not very well suited for it. Similarly, suppose that 
Frank is able to raise cattle and produce meat but is not very good at it. In this 
case, Frank and Ruby can each benefit by specializing in what he or she does best 
and then trading with the other person.
The gains from trade are less obvious, however, when one person is better at 
producing every good. For example, suppose that Ruby is better at raising cattle 
and better at growing potatoes than Frank. In this case, should Ruby choose to 
remain self- sufficient? Or is there still reason for her to trade with Frank? To 
answer this question, we need to look more closely at the factors that affect such 
a decision.

CHAPTER 3   INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE  
3-1a Production Possibilities
Suppose that Frank and Ruby each work 8 hours per day and can devote this 
time to growing potatoes, raising cattle, or a combination of the two. The table 
in  Figure 1 shows the amount of time each person requires to produce 1 ounce of 
each good. Frank can produce an ounce of potatoes in 15 minutes and an ounce of 
meat in 60 minutes. Ruby, who is more productive in both activities, can produce 
an ounce of potatoes in 10 minutes and an ounce of meat in 20 minutes. The last 
two columns in the table show the amounts of meat or potatoes Frank and Ruby 
can produce if they devote all 8 hours to producing only that good.
Panel (b) of Figure 1 illustrates the amounts of meat and potatoes that Frank 
can produce. If Frank devotes all 8 hours of his time to potatoes, he produces  
32 ounces of potatoes (measured on the horizontal axis) and no meat. If he devotes 
all of his time to meat, he produces 8 ounces of meat (measured on the vertical 
axis) and no potatoes. If Frank divides his time equally between the two activities, 
spending 4 hours on each, he produces 16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of 
meat. The figure shows these three possible outcomes and all others in between.
This graph is Frank’s production possibilities frontier. As we discussed in 
Chapter 2, a production possibilities frontier shows the various mixes of output

8 hours per day. If there is no trade, each person’s production possibilities frontier is  
also his or her consumption possibilities frontier.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
that an economy can produce. It illustrates one of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Here Frank faces a trade-off between producing 
meat and producing potatoes. 
You may recall that the production possibilities frontier in Chapter 2 was 
drawn bowed out. In that case, the rate at which society could trade one good 
for the other depended on the amounts that were being produced. Here, how-
ever, Frank’s technology for producing meat and potatoes (as summarized in 
Figure 1) allows him to switch between the two goods at a constant rate. When-
ever Frank spends 1 hour less producing meat and 1 hour more producing pota-
toes, he reduces his output of meat by 1 ounce and raises his output of potatoes 
by 4 ounces—and this is true regardless of how much he is already producing. 
As a result, the production possibilities frontier is a straight line.
Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows the production possibilities frontier for Ruby. If 
Ruby devotes all 8 hours of her time to potatoes, she produces 48 ounces of pota-
toes and no meat. If she devotes all of her time to meat, she produces 24 ounces of 
meat and no potatoes. If Ruby divides her time equally, spending 4 hours on each 
activity, she produces 24 ounces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat. Once again, 
the production possibilities frontier shows all the possible outcomes.
If Frank and Ruby choose to be self-sufficient rather than trade with each other, 
then each consumes exactly what he or she produces. In this case, the production 
possibilities frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier. That is, without 
trade, Figure 1 shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoes that Frank 
and Ruby can each produce and then consume.
These production possibilities frontiers are useful in showing the trade-offs 
that Frank and Ruby face, but they do not tell us what Frank and Ruby will actu-
ally choose to do. To determine their choices, we need to know the tastes of Frank 
and Ruby. Let’s suppose they choose the combinations identified by points A and 
B in Figure 1. Based on his production opportunities and food preferences, Frank 
 decides to produce and consume 16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat, while 
Ruby decides to produce and consume 24 ounces of potatoes and 12 ounces of meat.
3-1b Specialization and Trade
After several years of eating combination B, Ruby gets an idea and goes to talk to 
Frank:
 
ruby:  Frank, my friend, have I got a deal for you! I know how to improve 
life for both of us. I think you should stop producing meat alto-
gether and devote all your time to growing potatoes. According to 
my calculations, if you work 8 hours a day growing potatoes, you’ll 
produce 32 ounces of potatoes. If you give me 15 of those  
32 ounces, I’ll give you 5 ounces of meat in return. In the end, you’ll 
get to eat 17 ounces of potatoes and 5 ounces of meat every day, 
instead of the 16 ounces of potatoes and 4 ounces of meat you now 
get. If you go along with my plan, you’ll have more of both foods. 
[To illustrate her point, Ruby shows Frank panel (a) of Figure 2.]
 
frank:  (sounding skeptical) That seems like a good deal for me. But I don’t 
understand why you are offering it. If the deal is so good for me, it 
can’t be good for you too.
 
ruby:  Oh, but it is! Suppose I spend 6 hours a day raising cattle and  
2 hours growing potatoes. Then I can produce 18 ounces of meat 
and 12 ounces of potatoes. After I give you 5 ounces of my meat in 
 exchange for 15 ounces of your potatoes, I’ll end up with 13 ounces

of meat and 27 ounces of potatoes, instead of the 12 ounces of meat 
and 24 ounces of potatoes that I now get. So I will also consume more 
of both foods than I do now. [She points out panel (b) of Figure 2.] 
frank: I don’t know. . . . This sounds too good to be true.
ruby: It’s really not as complicated as it first seems. Here—I’ve summa-
rized my proposal for you in a simple table. [Ruby shows Frank a 
copy of the table at the bottom of Figure 2.]
frank: (after pausing to study the table) These calculations seem correct, 
but I am puzzled. How can this deal make us both better off?
ruby: We can both benefit because trade allows each of us to specialize in 
doing what we do best. You will spend more time growing potatoes 
and less time raising cattle. I will spend more time raising cattle 
FIGURE 2
How Trade Expands the Set  
of Consumption Opportunities
The proposed trade between Frank the farmer and Ruby the rancher offers each of them 
a combination of meat and potatoes that would be impossible in the absence of trade. In 
panel (a), Frank gets to consume at point A* rather than point A. In panel (b), Ruby gets to 
consume at point B* rather than point B. Trade allows each to consume more meat and more 
potatoes.

and less time growing potatoes. As a result of specialization and 
trade, each of us can consume more meat and more potatoes with-
out working any more hours. 
Draw an example of a production possibilities frontier for Robinson 
Crusoe, a shipwrecked sailor who spends his time gathering coconuts and 
catching fish. Does this frontier limit Crusoe’s consumption of coconuts and fish if he lives 
by himself? Would he face the same limits if he could trade with natives on the island?
QuickQuiz
3-2 Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization
Ruby’s explanation of the gains from trade, though correct, poses a puzzle: If 
Ruby is better at both raising cattle and growing potatoes, how can Frank ever 
specialize in doing what he does best? Frank doesn’t seem to do anything best. To 
solve this puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative advantage.
As a first step in developing this principle, consider the following question: In 
our example, who can produce potatoes at a lower cost—Frank or Ruby? There 
are two possible answers, and in these two answers lie the solution to our puzzle 
and the key to understanding the gains from trade.
3-2a Absolute Advantage
One way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to com-
pare the inputs required by the two producers. Economists use the term absolute 
advantage when comparing the productivity of one person, firm, or nation to that 
of another. The producer that requires a smaller quantity of inputs to produce a 
good is said to have an absolute advantage in producing that good. 
In our example, time is the only input, so we can determine absolute advantage 
by looking at how much time each type of production takes. Ruby has an absolute 
advantage in producing both meat and potatoes because she requires less time 
than Frank to produce a unit of either good. Ruby needs to input only 20 minutes 
to produce an ounce of meat, whereas Frank needs 60 minutes. Similarly, Ruby 
needs only 10 minutes to produce an ounce of potatoes, whereas Frank needs  
15 minutes. Thus, if we measure cost in terms of the quantity of inputs, Ruby has 
the lower cost of producing potatoes.
3-2b Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage
There is another way to look at the cost of producing potatoes. Rather than 
comparing inputs required, we can compare opportunity costs. Recall from 
Chapter 1 that the opportunity cost of some item is what we give up to get that 
item. In our example, we assumed that Frank and Ruby each spend 8 hours 
a day working. Time spent producing potatoes, therefore, takes away from 
time available for producing meat. When reallocating time between the two 
goods, Ruby and Frank give up units of one good to produce units of the other, 
thereby moving along the production possibilities frontier. The opportunity 
cost measures the trade-off between the two goods that each producer faces.
Let’s first consider Ruby’s opportunity cost. According to the table in panel 
(a) of Figure 1, producing 1 ounce of potatoes takes 10 minutes of work. When 
Ruby spends those 10 minutes producing potatoes, she spends 10 fewer minutes 
producing meat. Because Ruby needs 20 minutes to produce 1 ounce of meat,  
10 minutes of work would yield ½ ounce of meat. Hence, Ruby’s opportunity cost 
of producing 1 ounce of potatoes is ½ ounce of meat.

good using fewer inputs

53
CHAPTER 3   INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE  
Now consider Frank’s opportunity cost. Producing 1 ounce of potatoes takes him 
15 minutes. Because he needs 60 minutes to produce 1 ounce of meat, 15 minutes of 
work would yield ¼ ounce of meat. Hence, Frank’s opportunity cost of 1 ounce of 
potatoes is ¼ ounce of meat.
Table 1 shows the opportunity costs of meat and potatoes for the two produc-
ers. Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity cost 
of potatoes. Because 1 ounce of potatoes costs Ruby ½ ounce of meat, 1 ounce of 
meat costs Ruby 2 ounces of potatoes. Similarly, because 1 ounce of potatoes costs 
Frank ¼ ounce of meat, 1 ounce of meat costs Frank 4 ounces of potatoes.
Economists use the term comparative advantage when describing the opportu-
nity costs faced by two producers. The producer who gives up less of other goods 
to produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good X and is 
said to have a comparative advantage in producing it. In our example, Frank has 
a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than Ruby: An ounce of potatoes 
costs Frank only ¼ ounce of meat, but it costs Ruby ½ ounce of meat. Conversely, 
Ruby has a lower opportunity cost of producing meat than Frank: An ounce of 
meat costs Ruby 2 ounces of potatoes, but it costs Frank 4 ounces of potatoes. 
Thus, Frank has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and Ruby has a 
comparative advantage in producing meat.
Although it is possible for one person to have an absolute advantage in both 
goods (as Ruby does in our example), it is impossible for one person to have a 
comparative advantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one good 
is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person’s opportunity cost 
of one good is relatively high, the opportunity cost of the other good must be rel-
atively low. Comparative advantage reflects the relative opportunity cost. Unless 
two people have the same opportunity cost, one person will have a comparative 
advantage in one good, and the other person will have a comparative advantage 
in the other good. 
3-2c Comparative Advantage and Trade
The gains from specialization and trade are based not on absolute advantage but 
on comparative advantage. When each person specializes in producing the good 
for which he or she has a comparative advantage, total production in the econ-
omy rises. This increase in the size of the economic pie can be used to make every-
one better off. 
In our example, Frank spends more time growing potatoes, and Ruby spends 
more time producing meat. As a result, the total production of potatoes rises from 
40 to 44 ounces, and the total production of meat rises from 16 to 18 ounces. Frank 
and Ruby share the benefits of this increased production. 
We can also view the gains from trade in terms of the price that each party pays 
the other. Because Frank and Ruby have different opportunity costs, they can both 
comparative advantage

good at a lower oppor-
tunity cost than another 
producer

PART I   INTRODUCTION
get a bargain. That is, each of them benefits from trade by obtaining a good at a 
price that is lower than his or her opportunity cost of that good. 
Consider the proposed deal from Frank’s viewpoint. Frank receives 5 
ounces of meat in exchange for 15 ounces of potatoes. In other words, Frank 
buys each ounce of meat for a price of 3 ounces of potatoes. This price of meat 
is lower than his opportunity cost for an ounce of meat, which is 4 ounces of 
potatoes. Thus, Frank benefits from the deal because he gets to buy meat at a 
good price. 
Now consider the deal from Ruby’s viewpoint. Ruby buys 15 ounces of 
 potatoes at a cost of 5 ounces of meat. That is, the price for an ounce of potatoes 
is 1/3 ounce of meat. This price of potatoes is lower than her opportunity cost of an 
ounce of potatoes, which is ½ ounce of meat. Ruby benefits because she gets to 
buy potatoes at a good price.
The story of Ruby the rancher and Frank the farmer has a simple moral, which 
should now be clear: Trade can benefit everyone in society because it allows people to 
specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage. 
3-2d The Price of the Trade
The principle of comparative advantage establishes that there are gains from 
specialization and trade, but it raises a couple of related questions: What 
 determines the price at which trade takes place? How are the gains from trade 
shared between the trading parties? The precise answers to these questions 
are beyond the scope of this chapter, but we can state one general rule: For 
both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between the two 
opportunity costs.
In our example, Frank and Ruby agreed to trade at a rate of 3 ounces of 
potatoes for each ounce of meat. This price is between Ruby’s opportunity cost 
(2 ounces of potatoes per ounce of meat) and Frank’s opportunity cost (4 ounces 
of potatoes per ounce of meat). The price need not be exactly in the middle for 
both parties to gain, but it must be somewhere between 2 and 4.
To see why the price has to be in this range, consider what would happen 
if it were not. If the price of meat were below 2 ounces of potatoes, both Frank 
and Ruby would want to buy meat, because the price would be below each of 
their opportunity costs. Similarly, if the price of meat were above 4 ounces of 
potatoes, both would want to sell meat, because the price would be above their 
opportunity costs. But there are only two members of this economy. They can-
not both be buyers of meat, nor can they both be sellers. Someone has to take the 
other side of the deal.
A mutually advantageous trade can be struck at a price between 2 and 4. In 
this price range, Ruby wants to sell meat to buy potatoes, and Frank wants to sell 
 potatoes to buy meat. Each party can buy a good at a price that is lower than his 
or her opportunity cost. In the end, each person specializes in the good for which 
he or she has a comparative advantage and, as a result, is better off.
Robinson Crusoe can gather 10 coconuts or catch 1 fish per hour. His 
friend Friday can gather 30 coconuts or catch 2 fish per hour. What is 
Crusoe’s opportunity cost of catching 1 fish? What is Friday’s? Who has an absolute advan-
tage in catching fish? Who has a comparative advantage in catching fish?

CHAPTER 3   INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE  
The Legacy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo
E
conomists have long understood the gains from trade. Here is how the 
great economist Adam Smith put the argument: 
It is a maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt 
to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The 
tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the 
shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes 
but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one 
nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find 
it for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which 
they have some advantage over their neighbors, and to purchase 
with a part of its produce, or what is the 
same thing, with the price of part of it, 
whatever else they have occasion for.
This quotation is from Smith’s 1776 
book An Inquiry into the Nature and 
Causes of the Wealth of Nations, which 
was a landmark in the analysis of trade 
and economic interdependence.
Smith’s book inspired David  
Ricardo, a millionaire stockbroker, to 
become an economist. In his 1817 book 
Principles of Political 
Economy and Taxation, 
Ricardo developed the 
principle of comparative 
advantage as we know it 
today. He considered an ex-
ample with two goods (wine and 
cloth) and two countries (England and Portugal). He showed that both 
countries can gain by opening up trade and specializing based on com-
parative advantage.
Ricardo’s theory is the starting point of modern international eco-
nomics, but his defense of free trade was not a mere academic exercise. 
Ricardo put his beliefs to work as a member of the British Parliament, 
where he opposed the Corn Laws, which restricted the import of grain.
The conclusions of Adam Smith and David Ricardo on the gains 
from trade have held up well over time. Although economists often 
disagree on questions of policy, they are united in their support of free 
trade. Moreover, the central argument for free trade has not changed 
much in the past two centuries. Even though the field of economics has 
broadened its scope and refined its theories since the time of Smith 
and  Ricardo, economists’ opposition to trade restrictions is still based 
largely on the principle of comparative advantage. ■

3-3 Applications of Comparative Advantage
The principle of comparative advantage explains interdependence and the gains 
from trade. Because interdependence is so prevalent in the modern world, the 
principle of comparative advantage has many applications. Here are two exam-
ples, one fanciful and one of great practical importance.
3-3a Should Serena Williams Mow Her Own Lawn?
When Serena Williams plays at the Wimbledon tennis tournament, she spends a 
lot of time running around on grass. One of the most talented tennis players of all 
time, she can hit a ball with a speed and accuracy that most casual athletes can 
only dream of. Most likely, she is talented at other physical activities as well. For 
example, let’s imagine that Serena can mow her lawn faster than anyone else. But 
just because she can mow her lawn fast, does this mean she should?
To answer this question, we can use the concepts of opportunity cost and com-
parative advantage. Let’s say that Serena can mow her lawn in 2 hours. In that 
same 2 hours, she could film a television commercial and earn $30,000. By con-
trast, Forrest Gump, the boy next door, can mow Serena’s lawn in 4 hours. In that 
same 4 hours, Forrest could work at McDonald’s and earn $50. 
“They did a nice job with 
this grass.”

PART I   INTRODUCTION
An economist argues that you shouldn’t 
always unload the dishwasher just 
because you’re better at it than your 
partner.
You’re Dividing the Chores 
Wrong
By Emily Oster
N
o one likes doing chores. In happiness 
surveys, housework is ranked down there 
with commuting as activities that people 
 enjoy the least. Maybe that’s why figuring out 
who does which chores usually prompts, at 
best, tense discussion in a household and, at 
worst, outright fighting. 
If everyone is good at something differ-
ent, assigning chores is easy. If your part-
ner is great at grocery shopping and you are 
great at the laundry, you’re set. But this isn’t 
always—or even usually—the case. Often 
one person is better at everything. (And let’s 
be honest, often that person is the woman.) 
Better at the laundry, the grocery shopping, 
the cleaning, the cooking. But does that mean 
she should have to do everything?
Before my daughter was born, I both 
cooked and did the dishes. It wasn’t a big 
deal, it didn’t take too much time, and 
honestly I was a lot better at both than my 
husband. His cooking repertoire extended 
only to eggs and chili, and when I left him 
in charge of the dishwasher, I’d often find he 
had run it “full” with one pot and eight forks.
After we had a kid, we had more to do 
and less time to do it in. It seemed like it was 
time for some reassignments. But, of course, I 
was still better at doing both things. Did that 
mean I should do them both?
I could have appealed to the principle of 
fairness: We should each do half. I could have 
appealed to feminism—surveys show that 
women more often than not get the short end 
of the chore stick. In time-use data, women do 
about 44 minutes more housework than men  
(2 hours and 11 minutes versus 1 hour and  
27 minutes). Men outwork women only in the 
 areas of “lawn” and “exterior maintenance.” I 
could have suggested he do more chores to rec-
tify this imbalance, to show our daughter, in the 
Free To Be You and Me style, that Mom and Dad 
are equal and that housework is fun if we do it to-
gether! I could have simply smashed around the 
pans in the dishwasher while sighing loudly in the 
hopes he would notice and offer to do it himself.
But luckily for me and my husband, I’m an 
economist, so I have more effective tools than 
passive aggression. And some basic economic 
principles provided the answer. We needed 
to divide the chores because it is simply not 
efficient for the best cook and dishwasher to 
do all the cooking and dishwashing. The eco-
nomic principle at play here is increasing mar-
ginal cost. Basically, people get worse when 
they are tired. When I teach my students at the 
University of Chicago this principle, I explain 
it in the context of managing their employ-
ees. Imagine you have a good employee and 
a not-so-good one. Should you make the good 
 employee do literally everything? 
Usually, the answer is no. Why not? It’s 
likely that the not-so-good employee is better 
at 9 a.m. after a full night of sleep than the 
good employee is at 2 a.m. after a 17-hour 
workday. So you want to give at least a few 
tasks to your worse guy. The same principle 
applies in your household. Yes, you (or your 
spouse) might be better at everything. But 
anyone doing the laundry at 4 a.m. is likely to 
put the red towels in with the white T-shirts. 
Some task splitting is a good idea. How much 
depends on how fast people’s skills decay. 
Economics within a Marriage
IN THE NEWS
In this example, Serena has an absolute advantage in mowing lawns because 
she can do the work with a lower input of time. Yet because Serena’s opportunity 
cost of mowing the lawn is $30,000 and Forrest’s opportunity cost is only $50, For-
rest has a comparative advantage in mowing lawns.
The gains from trade in this example are tremendous. Rather than mowing her 
own lawn, Serena should make the commercial and hire Forrest to mow the lawn. 
As long as Serena pays Forrest more than $50 and less than $30,000, both of them 
are better off.

CHAPTER 3   INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE  
To “optimize” your family efficiency (every 
economist’s ultimate goal—and yours, too), 
you want to equalize effectiveness on the fi-
nal task each person is doing. Your partner 
does the dishes, mows the lawn, and makes 
the grocery list. You do the cooking, laundry, 
shopping, cleaning, and paying the bills. This 
may seem imbalanced, but when you look at 
it, you see that by the time your partner gets 
to the grocery-list task, he is wearing thin 
and starting to nod off. It’s all he can do to 
figure out how much milk you need. In fact, 
he is just about as good at that as you are 
when you get around to paying the bills, even 
though that’s your fifth task. 
If you then made your partner also do 
the cleaning—so it was an even four and 
four—the house would be a disaster, since 
he is already exhausted by his third chore 
while you are still doing fine. This system 
may well end up meaning one person does 
more, but it is unlikely to result in one per-
son doing everything. 
Once you’ve decided you need to divide up 
the chores in this way, how should you decide 
who does what? One option would be ran-
domly assigning tasks; another would be hav-
ing each person do some of everything. One 
spousal-advice website I read suggested you 
should divide tasks based on which ones you 
like the best. None of these are quite right.  
(In the last case, how would anyone ever end 
up with the job of cleaning the bathroom?)
To decide who does what, we need more 
economics. Specifically, the principle of com-
parative advantage. Economists usually talk 
about this in the context of trade. Imagine 
Finland is better than Sweden at making both 
reindeer hats and snowshoes. But they are 
much, much better at the hats and only a lit-
tle better at the snowshoes. The overall world 
production is maximized when Finland makes 
hats and Sweden makes snowshoes.
We say that Finland has an absolute 
advantage in both things but a comparative 
advantage only in hats. This principle is part 
of the reason economists value free trade, 
but that’s for another column (and probably 
another author). But it’s also a guideline for 
how to trade tasks in your house. You want to 
assign each person the tasks on which he or 
she has a comparative advantage. It doesn’t 
matter that you have an absolute advantage 
in everything. If you are much, much better at 
the laundry and only a little better at cleaning 
the toilet, you should do the laundry and have 
your spouse get out the scrub brush. Just ex-
plain that it’s efficient!
In our case, it was easy. Other than using 
the grill—which I freely admit is the husband 
domain—I’m much, much better at cooking. 
And I was only moderately better at the dishes. 
So he got the job of cleaning up after meals, 
even though his dishwasher loading habits 
had already come under scrutiny. The good 
news is another economic principle I hadn’t 
even counted on was soon in play: learning by 
doing. As people do a task, they improve at it. 
Eighteen months into this new arrangement the 
dishwasher is almost a work of art: neat rows 
of dishes and everything carefully screened 
for “top-rack only” status. I, meanwhile, am 
forbidden from getting near the dishwasher. 
Apparently, there is a risk that I’ll “ruin it.” ■
Ms Oster is a professor of economics at Brown 
University.
Americans enjoy are produced abroad, and many of the goods produced in the 
United States are sold abroad. Goods produced abroad and sold domestically 
are called imports. Goods produced domestically and sold abroad are called 
exports. 
To see how countries can benefit from trade, suppose there are two countries, 
the United States and Japan, and two goods, food and cars. Imagine that the two 
countries produce cars equally well: An American worker and a Japanese worker 
can each produce one car per month. By contrast, because the United States has 
more and better land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 
2 tons of food per month, whereas a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of 
food per month.

PART I   INTRODUCTION
QuickQuiz
The principle of comparative advantage states that each 
good should be produced by the country that has the smaller 
opportunity cost of producing that good. Because the op-
portunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United States 
but only 1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative ad-
vantage in producing cars. Japan should produce more cars 
than it wants for its own use and export some of them to the 
United States. Similarly, because the opportunity cost of a ton 
of food is 1 car in Japan but only 1/2 car in the United States, 
the United States has a comparative advantage in producing 
food. The United States should produce more food than it 
wants to consume and export some to Japan. Through spe-
cialization and trade, both countries can have more food and 
more cars.
In reality, of course, the issues involved in trade among 
nations are more complex than this example suggests. Most 
important among these issues is that each country has many cit-
izens with different interests. International trade can make some 
individuals worse off, even as it makes the country as a whole 
better off. When the United States exports food and  imports 
cars, the impact on an American farmer is not the same as the 
impact on an American autoworker. Yet, contrary to the opin-
ions sometimes voiced by politicians and pundits, international 
trade is not like war, in which some countries win and others 
lose. Trade allows all countries to achieve greater prosperity.
Suppose that a skilled brain surgeon also happens 
to be the world’s fastest typist. Should she do her 
own typing or hire a secretary? Explain.
3-4 Conclusion
You should now understand more fully the benefits of living 
in an interdependent economy. When Americans buy tube socks from China, 
when residents of Maine drink orange juice from Florida, and when a home-
owner hires the kid next door to mow her lawn, the same economic forces are 
at work. The principle of comparative advantage shows that trade can make 
everyone better off.
Having seen why interdependence is desirable, you might naturally ask how 
it is possible. How do free societies coordinate the diverse activities of all the 
people involved in their economies? What ensures that goods and services will 
get from those who should be producing them to those who should be con-
suming them? In a world with only two people, such as Ruby the rancher and 
Frank the farmer, the answer is simple: These two people can bargain and allo-
cate resources between themselves. In the real world with billions of people, the 
answer is less obvious. We take up this issue in the next chapter, where we see 
that free societies allocate resources through the market forces of supply and 
demand.
ASK THE EXPERTS
Trade between China  
and the United States
“Trade with China makes most Americans better off because, 
among other advantages, they can buy goods that are made or 
assembled more cheaply in China.”
“Some Americans who work in the production of competing 
goods, such as clothing and furniture, are made worse off by 
trade with China.”

CHAPTER 3   INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE  
SUMMARY 
r Each person consumes goods and services produced 
by many other people both in the United States and 
around the world. Interdependence and trade are de-
sirable because they allow everyone to enjoy a greater 
quantity and variety of goods and services.
r There are two ways to compare the ability of two peo-
ple to produce a good. The person who can produce 
the good with the smaller quantity of inputs is said 
to have an absolute advantage in producing the good. 
The person who has the smaller opportunity cost of 
producing the good is said to have a comparative advan-
tage. The gains from trade are based on comparative 
advantage, not absolute advantage.
r Trade makes everyone better off because it allows peo-
ple to specialize in those activities in which they have a 
comparative advantage. 
r The principle of comparative advantage applies to 
countries as well as to people. Economists use the prin-
ciple of comparative advantage to advocate free trade 
among countries.

The Market Forces of Supply 
and Demand
W
hen a cold snap hits Florida, the price of orange juice rises in supermarkets 
throughout the country. When the weather turns warm in New England 
every summer, the price of hotel rooms in the Caribbean plummets. When 
a war breaks out in the Middle East, the price of gasoline in the United States rises 
and the price of a used Cadillac falls. What do these events have in common? 
They all show the workings of supply and demand.
Supply and demand are the two words economists use most often—and for good 
reason. Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work. 
They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price at which it

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
is sold. If you want to know how any event or policy will affect the economy, you 
must think first about how it will affect supply and demand.
This chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It considers how 
buyers and sellers behave and how they interact with one another. It shows how 
supply and demand determine prices in a market economy and how prices, in 
turn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources.
4-1 Markets and Competition
The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact with 
one another in competitive markets. Before discussing how buyers and sellers 
behave, let’s first consider more fully what we mean by the terms market and 
competition. 
4-1a What Is a Market?
A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The buy-
ers as a group determine the demand for the product, and the sellers as a group 
determine the supply of the product. 
Markets take many forms. Some markets are highly organized, such as the mar-
kets for many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellers meet 
at a specific time and place where an auctioneer helps set prices and arrange sales. 
More often, markets are less organized. For example, consider the market for 
ice cream in a particular town. Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any one 
time. The sellers of ice cream are in different locations and offer somewhat different 
products. There is no auctioneer calling out the price of ice cream. Each seller posts 
a price for an ice-cream cone, and each buyer decides how much ice cream to buy 
at each store. Nonetheless, these consumers and producers of ice cream are closely 
connected. The ice-cream buyers are choosing from the various ice-cream sellers to 
satisfy their cravings, and the ice-cream sellers are all trying to appeal to the same 
ice-cream buyers to make their businesses successful. Even though it is not as orga-
nized, the group of ice-cream buyers and ice-cream sellers forms a market. 
4-1b What Is Competition?
The market for ice cream, like most markets in the economy, is highly competi-
tive. Each buyer knows that there are several sellers from which to choose, and 
each seller is aware that his product is similar to that offered by other sellers. As a 
result, the price and quantity of ice cream sold are not determined by any single 
buyer or seller. Rather, price and quantity are determined by all buyers and sellers 
as they interact in the marketplace.
Economists use the term competitive market to describe a market in which 
there are so many buyers and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact 
on the market price. Each seller of ice cream has limited control over the price 
 because other sellers are offering similar products. A seller has little reason to 
charge less than the going price, and if he charges more, buyers will make their 
purchases elsewhere. Similarly, no single buyer of ice cream can influence the 
price of ice cream because each buyer purchases only a small amount.
In this chapter, we assume that markets are perfectly competitive. To reach this 
highest form of competition, a market must have two characteristics: (1) The 
goods offered for sale are all exactly the same, and (2) the buyers and sellers are so 
numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price.

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
Because buyers and sellers in perfectly competitive markets must accept the price 
the market determines, they are said to be price takers. At the market price, buyers 
can buy all they want, and sellers can sell all they want.
There are some markets in which the assumption of perfect competition  applies 
perfectly. In the wheat market, for example, there are thousands of farmers who 
sell wheat and millions of consumers who use wheat and wheat products. Be-
cause no single buyer or seller can influence the price of wheat, each takes the 
market price as given.
Not all goods and services, however, are sold in perfectly competitive markets. 
Some markets have only one seller, and this seller sets the price. Such a seller is called 
a monopoly. Your local cable television company, for instance, may be a monopoly. Res-
idents of your town probably have only one company from which to buy cable ser-
vice. Other markets fall between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly.
Despite the diversity of market types we find in the world, assuming perfect 
competition is a useful simplification and, therefore, a natural place to start. Per-
fectly competitive markets are the easiest to analyze because everyone partic-
ipating in the market takes the price as given by market conditions. Moreover, 
because some degree of competition is present in most markets, many of the les-
sons that we learn by studying supply and demand under perfect competition 
apply in more complicated markets as well. 
What is a market? t What are the characteristics of a perfectly competi-
tive market?
4-2 Demand
We begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers. To focus our 
thinking, let’s keep in mind a particular good—ice cream.
4-2a  The Demand Curve: The Relationship between  
Price and Quantity Demanded
The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are 
willing and able to purchase. As we will see, many things determine the quantity 
demanded of any good, but in our analysis of how markets work, one determi-
nant plays a central role: the price of the good. If the price of ice cream rose to 
$20 per scoop, you would buy less ice cream. You might buy frozen yogurt 
 instead. If the price of ice cream fell to $0.20 per scoop, you would buy more. This 
relationship between price and quantity demanded is true for most goods in the 
economy and, in fact, is so pervasive that economists call it the law of demand: 
Other things being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded 
of the good falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises. 
The table in Figure 1 shows how many ice-cream cones Catherine buys each 
month at different prices. If ice cream is free, Catherine eats 12 cones per month. At 
$0.50 per cone, Catherine buys 10 cones each month. As the price rises further, she 
buys fewer and fewer cones. When the price reaches $3.00, Catherine doesn’t buy 
any cones at all. This table is a demand schedule, a table that shows the relation-
ship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding constant 
everything else that influences how much of the good consumers want to buy.
The graph in Figure 1 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law 
of demand. By convention, the price of ice cream is on the vertical axis, and the 
quantity demanded
the amount of a good that 
buyers are willing and 
able to purchase

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
quantity of ice cream demanded is on the horizontal axis. The line relating price 
and quantity demanded is called the demand curve. The demand curve slopes 
downward because, other things being equal, a lower price means a greater quan-
tity demanded.
4-2b Market Demand versus Individual Demand
The demand curve in Figure 1 shows an individual’s demand for a product. To 
analyze how markets work, we need to determine the market demand, the sum of 
all the individual demands for a particular good or service.
The table in Figure 2 shows the demand schedules for ice cream of the two 
individuals in this market—Catherine and Nicholas. At any price, Catherine’s 
demand schedule tells us how much ice cream she buys, and Nicholas’s demand 
schedule tells us how much ice cream he buys. The market demand at each price 
is the sum of the two individual demands.
The graph in Figure 2 shows the demand curves that correspond to these 
demand schedules. Notice that we sum the individual demand curves horizontally
to obtain the market demand curve. That is, to find the total quantity demanded 
at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are found on the horizontal 
axis of the individual demand curves. Because we are interested in analyzing how 
markets function, we work most often with the market demand curve. The market 
demand curve shows how the total quantity demanded of a good varies as the price 
of the good varies, while all other factors that affect how much consumers want to 
buy are held constant.

The demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price.  
The demand curve, which graphs the demand schedule, illustrates how the quantity  
demanded of the good changes as its price varies. Because a lower price increases  
the quantity demanded, the demand curve slopes downward.

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
4-2c Shifts in the Demand Curve
Because the market demand curve holds other things constant, it need not be 
stable over time. If something happens to alter the quantity demanded at any 
given price, the demand curve shifts. For example, suppose the American  Medical 
Association discovered that people who regularly eat ice cream live  longer, 
healthier lives. The discovery would raise the demand for ice cream. At any given 
price, buyers would now want to purchase a larger quantity of ice cream, and the 
demand curve for ice cream would shift. 
Figure 3 illustrates shifts in demand. Any change that increases the quantity 
demanded at every price, such as our imaginary discovery by the American 
 Medical Association, shifts the demand curve to the right and is called an increase 
in demand. Any change that reduces the quantity demanded at every price shifts 
the demand curve to the left and is called a decrease in demand.
There are many variables that can shift the demand curve. Let’s consider the 
most important.
Income  What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your 
job one summer? Most likely, it would fall. A lower income means that you have

The quantity demanded in a market is the sum of the quantities demanded  
by all the buyers at each price. Thus, the market demand curve is found  
by adding horizontally the individual demand curves. At a price of $2.00,  
Catherine demands 4 ice-cream cones and Nicholas demands 3 ice-cream 
cones. The quantity demanded in the market at this price is 7 cones.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
less to spend in total, so you would have to spend less on some—and probably 
most—goods. If the demand for a good falls when income falls, the good is called 
a normal good.
Normal goods are the norm, but not all goods are normal goods. If the demand 
for a good rises when income falls, the good is called an inferior good. An exam-
ple of an inferior good might be bus rides. As your income falls, you are less likely 
to buy a car or take a cab and more likely to ride a bus.
Prices of Related Goods  Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls. The law 
of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, you will 
probably buy less ice cream. Because ice cream and frozen yogurt are both cold, 
sweet, creamy desserts, they satisfy similar desires. When a fall in the price of one 
good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called substitutes. 
Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other, such as 
hot dogs and hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and cinema tickets and film 
streaming services.
Now suppose that the price of hot fudge falls. According to the law of demand, 
you will buy more hot fudge. Yet in this case, you will likely buy more ice cream 
as well because ice cream and hot fudge are often used together. When a fall in the 
price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called 
complements. Complements are often pairs of goods that are used together, such 
as gasoline and automobiles, computers and software, and peanut butter and jelly.
Tastes  The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you like 
ice cream, you buy more of it. Economists normally do not try to explain peo-
ple’s tastes because tastes are based on historical and psychological forces that are 
 beyond the realm of economics. Economists do, however, examine what happens 
when tastes change.
Expectations  Your expectations about the future may affect your demand for a 
good or service today. If you expect to earn a higher income next month, you may

choose to save less now and spend more of your current income buying ice cream. 
If you expect the price of ice cream to fall tomorrow, you may be less willing to 
buy an ice-cream cone at today’s price.
Number of Buyers  In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the 
behavior of individual buyers, market demand depends on the number of these 
buyers. If Peter were to join Catherine and Nicholas as another consumer of ice 
cream, the quantity demanded in the market would be higher at every price, and 
market demand would increase.
Summary  The demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded of 
a good when its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influence 
buyers. When one of these other variables changes, the demand curve shifts. Table 1 
lists the variables that influence how much of a good consumers choose to buy. 
If you have trouble remembering whether you need to shift or move along the 
demand curve, it helps to recall a lesson from the appendix to Chapter 2. A curve 
shifts when there is a change in a relevant variable that is not measured on either 
axis. Because the price is on the vertical axis, a change in price represents a move-
ment along the demand curve. By contrast, income, the prices of related goods, 
tastes, expectations, and the number of buyers are not measured on either axis, so 
a change in one of these variables shifts the demand curve.

variables shifts the demand curve.

TWO WAYS TO REDUCE THE QUANTITY OF SMOKING DEMANDED
Because smoking can lead to various illnesses, public policymakers 
often want to reduce the amount that people smoke. There are two 
ways that they can attempt to achieve this goal.
One way to reduce smoking is to shift the demand curve for cigarettes and other 
tobacco products. Public service announcements, mandatory health warnings on 
cigarette packages, and the prohibition of cigarette advertising on television are all 
policies aimed at reducing the quantity of cigarettes demanded at any given price. 
If successful, these policies shift the demand curve for cigarettes to the left, as in 
panel (a) of Figure 4. 
Alternatively, policymakers can try to raise the price of cigarettes. If the gov-
ernment taxes the manufacture of cigarettes, for example, cigarette companies 
pass much of this tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices. A higher price 
encourages smokers to reduce the numbers of cigarettes they smoke. In this case, 
the reduced amount of smoking does not represent a shift in the demand curve.

72
PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
Instead, it represents a movement along the same demand curve to a point with a 
higher price and lower quantity, as in panel (b) of Figure 4.
How much does the amount of smoking respond to changes in the price of 
cigarettes? Economists have attempted to answer this question by studying what 
happens when the tax on cigarettes changes. They have found that a 10 percent 
increase in the price causes a 4 percent reduction in the quantity demanded. 
Teenagers are especially sensitive to the price of cigarettes: A 10 percent increase in 
the price causes a 12 percent drop in teenage smoking.
A related question is how the price of cigarettes affects the demand for illicit 
drugs, such as marijuana. Opponents of cigarette taxes often argue that tobacco 
and marijuana are substitutes so that high cigarette prices encourage marijuana 
use. By contrast, many experts on substance abuse view tobacco as a “gateway 
drug” leading young people to experiment with other harmful substances. Most 
studies of the data are consistent with this latter view: They find that lower 
cigarette prices are associated with greater use of marijuana. In other words, 
tobacco and marijuana appear to be complements rather than substitutes. ●

the implied demand curve. Give an example of something that would shift 
this demand curve, and briefly explain your reasoning. Would a change in the price of pizza

ent point on the demand curve. In panel (b), when the price rises from $4.00 to $8.00,  
the quantity demanded falls from 20 to 12 cigarettes per day, as reflected by the  
movement from point A to point C.

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
4-3 Supply
We now turn to the other side of the market and examine the behavior of sellers. 
Once again, to focus our thinking, let’s consider the market for ice cream.
4-3a  The Supply Curve: The Relationship  
between Price and Quantity Supplied
The quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are will-
ing and able to sell. There are many determinants of quantity supplied, but once 
again, price plays a special role in our analysis. When the price of ice cream is 
high, selling ice cream is profitable, and so the quantity supplied is large. Sell-
ers of ice cream work long hours, buy many ice-cream machines, and hire many 
workers. By contrast, when the price of ice cream is low, the business is less prof-
itable, so sellers produce less ice cream. At a low price, some sellers may even 
choose to shut down, and their quantity supplied falls to zero. This relationship 
between price and quantity supplied is called the law of supply: Other things 
being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also 
rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well.
The table in Figure 5 shows the quantity of ice-cream cones supplied each 
month by Ben, an ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice cream. At a price below 
$1.00, Ben does not supply any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies a 
greater and greater quantity. This is the supply schedule, a table that shows the 
relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied, holding con-
stant everything else that influences how much of the good producers want to sell.

The supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at each price. This 
supply curve, which graphs the supply schedule, illustrates how the quantity supplied 
of the good changes as its price varies. Because a higher price increases the quantity 
supplied, the supply curve slopes upward.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
The graph in Figure 5 uses the numbers from the table to illustrate the law of 
supply. The curve relating price and quantity supplied is called the supply curve. 
The supply curve slopes upward because, other things being equal, a higher price 
means a greater quantity supplied. 
4-3b Market Supply versus Individual Supply
Just as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply 
is the sum of the supplies of all sellers. The table in Figure 6 shows the supply 
schedules for the two ice-cream producers in the market—Ben and Jerry. At any 
price, Ben’s supply schedule tells us the quantity of ice cream that Ben supplies, 
and Jerry’s supply schedule tells us the quantity of ice cream that Jerry supplies. 
The market supply is the sum of the two individual supplies.
The graph in Figure 6 shows the supply curves that correspond to the supply 
schedules. As with demand curves, we sum the individual supply curves horizon-
tally to obtain the market supply curve. That is, to find the total quantity supplied 
at any price, we add the individual quantities, which are found on the horizontal 
axis of the individual supply curves. The market supply curve shows how the 
total quantity supplied varies as the price of the good varies, holding constant all 
other factors that influence producers’ decisions about how much to sell.

The quantity supplied in a market is the sum of the quantities supplied by all 
the sellers at each price. Thus, the market supply curve is found by adding  
horizontally the individual supply curves. At a price of $2.00, Ben supplies  
3 ice-cream cones and Jerry supplies 4 ice-cream cones. The quantity supplied 
in the market at this price is 7 cones.

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
4-3c Shifts in the Supply Curve
Because the market supply curve is drawn holding other things constant, when 
one of these factors changes, the supply curve shifts. For example, suppose the 
price of sugar falls. Sugar is an input in the production of ice cream, so the fall in 
the price of sugar makes selling ice cream more profitable. This raises the supply 
of ice cream: At any given price, sellers are now willing to produce a larger quan-
tity. As a result, the supply curve for ice cream shifts to the right.
Figure 7 illustrates shifts in supply. Any change that raises quantity supplied at 
every price, such as a fall in the price of sugar, shifts the supply curve to the right 
and is called an increase in supply. Any change that reduces the quantity supplied 
at every price shifts the supply curve to the left and is called a decrease in supply.
There are many variables that can shift the supply curve. Let’s consider the 
most important.
Input Prices  To produce their output of ice cream, sellers use various inputs: 
cream, sugar, flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the ice 
cream is made, and the labor of workers who mix the ingredients and operate 
the  machines. When the price of one or more of these inputs rises, producing ice 
cream is less profitable, and firms supply less ice cream. If input prices rise sub-
stantially, a firm might shut down and supply no ice cream at all. Thus, the supply 
of a good is negatively related to the price of the inputs used to make the good.
Technology  The technology for turning inputs into ice cream is another deter-
minant of supply. The invention of the mechanized ice-cream machine, for exam-
ple, reduced the amount of labor necessary to make ice cream. By reducing firms’ 
costs, the advance in technology raised the supply of ice cream.
Expectations  The amount of ice cream a firm supplies today may depend on its 
expectations about the future. For example, if a firm expects the price of ice cream 
to rise in the future, it will put some of its current production into storage and 
supply less to the market today.
FIGURE 7

Any change that raises the quantity that 
sellers wish to produce at any given price

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
Number of Sellers  In addition to the preceding factors, which influence the 
behavior of individual sellers, market supply depends on the number of these 
sellers. If Ben or Jerry were to retire from the ice-cream business, the supply in the 
market would fall.
Summary  The supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied of a 
good when its price varies, holding constant all the other variables that influence 
sellers. When one of these other variables changes, the supply curve shifts. Table 2 
lists the variables that influence how much of a good producers choose to sell.
Once again, to remember whether you need to shift or move along the supply 
curve, keep in mind that a curve shifts only when there is a change in a relevant 
variable that is not named on either axis. The price is on the vertical axis, so a 
change in price represents a movement along the supply curve. By contrast, 
because input prices, technology, expectations, and the number of sellers are not 
measured on either axis, a change in one of these variables shifts the supply curve.
Make up an example of a monthly supply schedule for pizza, and graph 
the implied supply curve. Give an example of something that would shift 
this supply curve, and briefly explain your reasoning. Would a change in the price of pizza 
shift this supply curve?

4-4 Supply and Demand Together
Having analyzed supply and demand separately, we now combine them to see 
how they determine the price and quantity of a good sold in a market.
4-4a Equilibrium
Figure 8 shows the market supply curve and market demand curve together. 
Notice that there is one point at which the supply and demand curves intersect. 
This point is called the market’s equilibrium. The price at this intersection is 
called the equilibrium price, and the quantity is called the equilibrium quan-
tity. Here the equilibrium price is $2.00 per cone, and the equilibrium quantity is 
7 ice-cream cones. 
The dictionary defines the word equilibrium as a situation in which various 
forces are in balance. This definition applies to a market’s equilibrium as well. 
At the equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy 
exactly balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell. The equilibrium 
price is sometimes called the market-clearing price because, at this price, everyone

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
in the market has been satisfied: Buyers have bought all they want to buy, and 
sellers have sold all they want to sell. 
The actions of buyers and sellers naturally move markets toward the equilib-
rium of supply and demand. To see why, consider what happens when the mar-
ket price is not equal to the equilibrium price.
Suppose first that the market price is above the equilibrium price, as in 
panel (a) of Figure 9. At a price of $2.50 per cone, the quantity of the good sup-
plied (10 cones) exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). There is a surplus of 
the good: Suppliers are unable to sell all they want at the going price. A surplus 
is sometimes called a situation of excess supply. When there is a surplus in the 
ice-cream market, sellers of ice cream find their freezers increasingly full of ice 
cream they would like to sell but cannot. They respond to the surplus by cutting 
their prices. Falling prices, in turn, increase the quantity demanded and decrease 
the quantity supplied. These changes represent movements along the supply and 
demand curves, not shifts in the curves. Prices continue to fall until the market 
reaches the equilibrium.
Suppose now that the market price is below the equilibrium price, as in 
panel (b) of Figure 9. In this case, the price is $1.50 per cone, and the quantity 
of the good demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. There is a shortage of the 
good: Demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. A shortage is 
sometimes called a situation of excess demand. When a shortage occurs in the ice-
cream market, buyers have to wait in long lines for a chance to buy one of the few 
cones available. With too many buyers chasing too few goods, sellers can respond 
to the shortage by raising their prices without losing sales. These price increases 
cause the quantity demanded to fall and the quantity supplied to rise. Once again, 
these changes represent movements along the supply and demand curves, and 
they move the market toward the equilibrium.
Thus, regardless of whether the price starts off too high or too low, the activities 
of the many buyers and sellers automatically push the market price toward the 
equilibrium price. Once the market reaches its equilibrium, all buyers and sellers

The equilibrium is found  
where the supply and

At the equilibrium price, the 
quantity supplied equals  
the quantity demanded. Here 
the equilibrium price is $2.00: 
At this price, 7 ice-cream cones 
are supplied and 7 ice-cream 
cones are demanded.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
are satisfied, and there is no upward or downward pressure on the price. How 
quickly equilibrium is reached varies from market to market depending on how 
quickly prices adjust. In most free markets, surpluses and shortages are only tem-
porary because prices eventually move toward their equilibrium levels.  Indeed, 
this phenomenon is so pervasive that it is called the law of supply and de-
mand: The price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity 
demanded for that good into balance.
4-4b Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium
So far, we have seen how supply and demand together determine a market’s equi-
librium, which in turn determines the price and quantity of the good that buyers 
law of supply and 
demand
the claim that the price 
of any good adjusts to 
bring the quantity sup-
plied and the quantity 
demanded for that good

FIGURE 9
Markets Not in Equilibrium
In panel (a), there is a surplus. Because the market price of $2.50 is above the equilibrium 
price, the quantity supplied (10 cones) exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). Suppliers 
try to increase sales by cutting the price of a cone, and this moves the price toward its equi-
librium level. In panel (b), there is a shortage. Because the market price of $1.50 is below 
the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded (10 cones) exceeds the quantity supplied  
(4 cones). With too many buyers chasing too few goods, suppliers can take advantage of the 
shortage by raising the price. Hence, in both cases, the price adjustment moves the market 
toward the equilibrium of supply and demand.

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
purchase and sellers produce. The equilibrium price and quantity depend on the 
position of the supply and demand curves. When some event shifts one of these 
curves, the equilibrium in the market changes, resulting in a new price and a new 
quantity exchanged between buyers and sellers. 
When analyzing how some event affects the equilibrium in a market, we pro-
ceed in three steps. First, we decide whether the event shifts the supply curve, 
the demand curve, or, in some cases, both. Second, we decide whether the curve 
shifts to the right or to the left. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram 
to compare the initial equilibrium with the new one, which shows how the shift 
affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Table 3 summarizes these three steps. 
To see how this recipe is used, let’s consider various events that might affect the 
market for ice cream.
1. Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or perhaps both).
2. Decide in which direction the curve shifts.
3.  Use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift changes the equilibrium 
price and quantity.
TABLE 3
Three Steps for Analyzing 
Changes in Equilibrium
Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Demand    Suppose 
that one summer the weather is very hot. How does this event affect the market 
for ice cream? To answer this question, let’s follow our three steps.
 1. The hot weather affects the demand curve by changing people’s taste for 
ice cream. That is, the weather changes the amount of ice cream that people 
want to buy at any given price. The supply curve is unchanged because the 
weather does not directly affect the firms that sell ice cream. 
 2. Because hot weather makes people want to eat more ice cream, the demand 
curve shifts to the right. Figure 10 shows this increase in demand as a shift in 
the demand curve from D1 to D2. This shift indicates that the quantity of ice 
cream demanded is higher at every price.
 3. At the old price of $2, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and this 
shortage induces firms to raise the price. As Figure 10 shows, the increase in 
demand raises the equilibrium price from $2.00 to $2.50 and the equilibrium 
quantity from 7 to 10 cones. In other words, the hot weather increases both the 
price of ice cream and the quantity of ice cream sold.
Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves  Notice that when hot weather 
increases the demand for ice cream and drives up the price, the quantity of ice 
cream that firms supply rises, even though the supply curve remains the same. In 
this case, economists say there has been an increase in “quantity supplied” but no 
change in “supply.” 
Supply refers to the position of the supply curve, whereas the quantity sup-
plied refers to the amount suppliers wish to sell. In this example, supply does 
not change because the weather does not alter firms’ desire to sell at any given 
price. Instead, the hot weather alters consumers’ desire to buy at any given 
price and thereby shifts the demand curve to the right. The increase in demand

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
causes the equilibrium price to rise. When the price rises, the quantity supplied 
rises. This increase in quantity supplied is represented by the movement along 
the supply curve.
To summarize, a shift in the supply curve is called a “change in supply,” and 
a shift in the demand curve is called a “change in demand.” A movement along a 
fixed supply curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied,” and a movement 
along a fixed demand curve is called a “change in the quantity demanded.”
Example: A Change in Market Equilibrium Due to a Shift in Supply  Suppose 
that during another summer, a hurricane destroys part of the sugarcane crop and 
drives up the price of sugar. How does this event affect the market for ice cream? 
Once again, to answer this question, we follow our three steps. 
 1. The change in the price of sugar, an input for making ice cream, affects the 
supply curve. By raising the costs of production, it reduces the amount of 
ice cream that firms produce and sell at any given price. The demand curve 
does not change because the higher cost of inputs does not directly affect the 
amount of ice cream consumers wish to buy. 
 2. The supply curve shifts to the left because, at every price, the total amount that 
firms are willing and able to sell is reduced. Figure 11 illustrates this decrease 
in supply as a shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2.
 3. At the old price of $2, there is now an excess demand for ice cream, and  
this shortage causes firms to raise the price. As Figure 11 shows, the shift  
in the supply curve raises the equilibrium price from $2.00 to $2.50 and 
FIGURE 10
How an Increase in Demand  
Affects the Equilibrium
An event that raises quantity 
 demanded at any given price 
shifts the demand curve to the 
right. The equilibrium price and 
the equilibrium quantity both 
rise. Here an abnormally hot 
summer causes buyers to demand 
more ice cream. The demand 
curve shifts from D1 to D2, which 
causes the equilibrium price to 
rise from $2.00 to $2.50 and the 
equilibrium quantity to rise from 
7 to 10 cones.

CHAPTER 4   THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
lowers the equilibrium quantity from 7 to 4 cones. As a result of the sugar 
price increase, the price of ice cream rises, and the quantity of ice cream 
sold falls.
Example: Shifts in Both Supply and Demand  Now suppose that the heat wave 
and the hurricane occur during the same summer. To analyze this combination of 
events, we again follow our three steps. 
 1. We determine that both curves must shift. The hot weather affects the  
demand curve because it alters the amount of ice cream that consumers want 
to buy at any given price. At the same time, when the hurricane drives up 
sugar prices, it alters the supply curve for ice cream because it changes the 
amount of ice cream that firms want to sell at any given price.
 2. The curves shift in the same directions as they did in our previous analysis: 
The demand curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left. 
Figure 12 illustrates these shifts.
 3. As Figure 12 shows, two possible outcomes might result depending on  
the relative size of the demand and supply shifts. In both cases, the  
equilibrium price rises. In panel (a), where demand increases substantially 
while supply falls just a little, the equilibrium quantity also rises. By  
contrast, in panel (b), where supply falls substantially while demand rises 
just a little, the equilibrium quantity falls. Thus, these events certainly raise 
the price of ice cream, but their impact on the amount of ice cream sold is 
ambiguous (that is, it could go either way).
FIGURE 11
How a Decrease in Supply  
Affects the Equilibrium
An event that reduces quantity 
supplied at any given price shifts 
the supply curve to the left. 
The equilibrium price rises, and 
the equilibrium quantity falls. 
Here an increase in the price of 
sugar (an input) causes sellers 
to  supply less ice cream. The 
supply curve shifts from S1 to 
S2, which causes the  equilibrium 
price of ice cream to rise 
from $2.00 to $2.50 and the 
 equilibrium quantity to fall from 
7 to 4 cones.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
Summary  We have just seen three examples of how to use supply and demand 
curves to analyze a change in equilibrium. Whenever an event shifts the supply 
curve, the demand curve, or perhaps both curves, you can use these tools to pre-
dict how the event will alter the price and quantity sold in equilibrium. Table 4 
shows the predicted outcome for any combination of shifts in the two curves. To 
make sure you understand how to use the tools of supply and demand, pick a few 
entries in this table and make sure you can explain to yourself why the table con-
tains the prediction that it does.

but the equilibrium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2.

4-5  Conclusion: How Prices  
Allocate Resources
This chapter has analyzed supply and demand in a single market. Our discus-
sion has centered on the market for ice cream, but the lessons learned here apply 
to most other markets as well. Whenever you go to a store to buy something, 
you are contributing to the demand for that item. Whenever 
you look for a job, you are contributing to the supply of  labor 
services. Because supply and demand are such pervasive eco-
nomic phenomena, the model of supply and demand is a pow-
erful tool for analysis. We use this model repeatedly in the 
following chapters.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 
1 is that markets are usually a good way to organize economic 
activity. Although it is still too early to judge whether market 
outcomes are good or bad, in this chapter we have begun to see 
how markets work. In any economic system, scarce resources 
have to be allocated among competing uses. Market economies 
harness the forces of supply and demand to serve that end. Sup-
ply and demand together determine the prices of the economy’s 
many different goods and services; prices in turn are the signals 
that guide the allocation of resources. 
For example, consider the allocation of beachfront land. Be-
cause the amount of this land is limited, not everyone can enjoy 
the luxury of living by the beach. Who gets this resource? The 
answer is whoever is willing and able to pay the price. The price 
of beachfront land adjusts until the quantity of land demanded 
exactly balances the quantity supplied. Thus, in market econo-
mies, prices are the mechanism for rationing scarce resources.
Similarly, prices determine who produces each good and 
how much is produced. For instance, consider farming. Because 
we need food to survive, it is crucial that some people work on 
“Two dollars”
“—and seventy-five cents.”

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
When a disaster such as a hurricane 
strikes a region, many goods expe-
rience an increase in demand or a 
decrease in supply, putting upward 
pressure on prices. Policymakers often 
object to these price hikes, but this 
opinion piece endorses the market’s 
natural response.
Is Price Gouging Reverse 
Looting?
By John Carney
F
our dollars for a can of coke. Five hundred 
dollars a night for a hotel in downtown 
Brooklyn. A pair of D-batteries for $6.99. 
These are just a few of the examples of 
price hikes I or friends of mine have person-
ally come across in the run-up and aftermath 
of hurricane Sandy. Price gouging, as this is 
often called, is a common occurrence during 
emergencies. 
Price gouging around natural disasters 
is one of the things politicians on the left and 
right agree is a terrible, no good, very bad thing. 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman 
sent out a press release warning “against 
price inflation of necessary goods and services 
during hurricane Sandy.” New Jersey Governor 
Chris Christie issued a “forceful reminder” that 
price gouging “will result in significant penal-
ties.” Hotlines have been established to allow 
consumers to report gouging. 
New Jersey’s law is very specific. Price 
increases of more than 10 percent during a 
declared state of emergency are considered 
excessive. A New Jersey gas station paid a 
$50,000 fine last year for hiking gasoline prices 
by 16 percent during tropical storm Irene. 
New York’s law may be even stricter. 
 According to AG Schneiderman’s release, 
all price increases on “necessary goods and 
items” count as gouging. 
“General Business Law prohibits such 
increase in costs of essential items like 
food, water, gas, generators, batteries and 
flashlights, and services like transportation, 
during natural disasters or other events that 
disrupt the market,” the NY AG release said. 
These laws are built on the quite conven-
tional view that it is unethical for a business 
to take advantage of a disaster in pursuit 
of profits. It just seems wrong for business 
owners to make money on the misery of their 
neighbors. Merchants earning larger profits 
because of a disaster seem to be rewarded for 
doing nothing more than raising their prices. 
“It’s reverse looting,” a neighbor of mine 
in Brooklyn said about the price of batteries 
at a local electronic store. 
Unfortunately, ethics runs into economics 
in a way that can make these laws positively 
harmful. Price gouging can occur only when 
there is a shortage of the goods in demand. 
If there were no shortage, normal market pro-
cesses would prevent sudden price spikes. 
A deli owner charging $4 for a can of Pepsi 
would discover he was just driving custom-
ers to the deli a block away, which charges 
a buck. 
But when everyone starts suddenly buy-
ing batteries or bottles of water for fear of 
a blackout, shortages can arise. Sometimes 
there simply is not enough of a particular 
good to satisfy a sharp spike in demand. 
And so the question arises: how do we decide 
Price Increases after Disasters
IN THE NEWS
farms. What determines who is a farmer and who is not? In a free society, there is 
no government planning agency making this decision and ensuring an adequate 
supply of food. Instead, the allocation of workers to farms is based on the job deci-
sions of millions of workers. This decentralized system works well because these 
decisions depend on prices. The prices of food and the wages of farmworkers (the 
price of their labor) adjust to ensure that enough people choose to be farmers.
If a person had never seen a market economy in action, the whole idea might 
seem preposterous. Economies are enormous groups of people engaged in a 
multitude of interdependent activities. What prevents decentralized  decision 
making from degenerating into chaos? What coordinates the actions of the 
millions of people with their varying abilities and desires? What ensures that 
what needs to be done is in fact done? The answer, in a word, is prices. If an 
invisible hand guides market economies, as Adam Smith famously suggested, 
then the price system is the baton that the invisible hand uses to conduct the 
economic orchestra.

which customers get the batteries, the gro-
ceries, the gasoline? 
We could hold a lottery. Perhaps people 
could receive a ticket at the grocery store. 
Winners would get to shop at the usual prices. 
Losers would just go hungry. Or, more likely, 
they would be forced to buy the food away 
from the lottery winners—at elevated prices 
no doubt, since no one would buy food just 
to sell it at the same price. So the gouging 
would just pass from merchant to lottery win-
ning customer. 
We could have some sort of rationing pro-
gram. Each person could be assigned a por-
tion of the necessary goods according to their 
household need. This is something the U.S. 
resorted to during World War II. The problem is 
that rationing requires an immense amount of 
planning—and an impossible level of knowl-
edge. The rationing bureaucrat would have to 
know precisely how much of each good was 
available in a given area and how many peo-
ple would need it. Good luck getting that in 
place as a hurricane bears down on your city. 
We could simply sell goods on a first 
come, first serve basis. This is, in fact, what 
anti-gouging laws encourage. The result is 
all too familiar. People hoard goods. Store 
shelves are emptied. And you have to wonder, 
why is a first to the register race a fairer sys-
tem than the alternative of market prices? 
Speed seems a poor proxy for justice. 
Allowing prices to rise at times of  extreme 
demand discourages overconsumption. Peo-
ple consider their purchases more carefully. 
Instead of buying a dozen batteries (or bot-
tles of water or gallons of gas), perhaps 
they buy half that. The result is that goods 
under extreme demand are available to more 
customers. The market process actually 
 results in a more equitable distribution than 
the anti-gouging laws. 
Once we understand this, it’s easy to see 
that merchants aren’t really profiting from 
 disaster. They are profiting from managing their 
prices, which has the socially beneficial effect 
of broadening distribution and discouraging 
hoarding. In short, they are being justly rewarded 
for performing an important public service. 
One objection is that a system of free- 
floating, legal gouging would allow the wealthy to 
buy everything and leave the poor out altogether. 
But this concern is overrated. For the most part, 
price hikes during disasters do not actually put 
necessary goods and services out of reach of even 
the poorest people. They just put the budgets of 
the poor under additional strain. This is a prob-
lem better resolved through transfer payments to 
alleviate the household budgetary effects of the 
prices after the fact, rather than trying to control 
the price in the first place…. 
Instead of cracking down on price goug-
ers, we should be using our experience of 
shortages during this time of crisis to spark 
a reform of our counter-productive laws. Next 
time disaster strikes, we should hope for a 
bit more gouging and a lot fewer empty store 
shelves. ■

SUMMARY 
r Economists use the model of supply and demand to 
analyze competitive markets. In a competitive market, 
there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has 
little or no influence on the market price.
r The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good 
demanded depends on the price. According to the law 
of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity 
demanded rises. Therefore, the demand curve slopes 
downward.
r In addition to price, other determinants of how much 
consumers want to buy include income, the prices of 
substitutes and complements, tastes, expectations, and 
the number of buyers. If one of these factors changes, 
the demand curve shifts.
r The supply curve shows how the quantity of a good 
supplied depends on the price. According to the law 
of supply, as the price of a good rises, the quantity sup-
plied rises. Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward.
r In addition to price, other determinants of how much 
producers want to sell include input prices, technol-
ogy, expectations, and the number of sellers. If one of 
these factors changes, the supply curve shifts.
r The intersection of the supply and demand curves 
 determines the market equilibrium. At the equilibrium 
price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity 
supplied. 
r The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally drives 
markets toward their equilibrium. When the market 
price is above the equilibrium price, there is a sur-
plus of the good, which causes the market price to 
fall. When the market price is below the equilibrium 
price, there is a shortage, which causes the market 
price to rise. 
r To analyze how any event influences a market, we use 
the supply-and-demand diagram to examine how the 
event affects the equilibrium price and quantity. To do 
this, we follow three steps. First, we decide whether 
the event shifts the supply curve or the demand curve 
(or both). Second, we decide in which direction the 
curve shifts. Third, we compare the new equilibrium 
with the initial equilibrium.
r In market economies, prices are the signals that 
guide economic decisions and thereby allocate scarce 
 resources. For every good in the economy, the price 
ensures that supply and demand are in balance. The 
equilibrium price then determines how much of the 
good buyers choose to consume and how much sellers 
choose to produce.

show what happens in the market for TV screens.
c. Draw two more diagrams to show how the 
change in the market for TV screens affects the 
markets for film streaming and movie tickets.
5. Over the past 40 years, technological advances  
have reduced the cost of computer chips. How do  
you think this has affected the market for computers? 
For computer software? For typewriters?
6. Using supply-and-demand diagrams, show the effect 
of the following events on the market for sweatshirts.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
7. Ketchup is a complement (as well as a condiment) for 
hot dogs. If the price of hot dogs rises, what happens 
in the market for ketchup? For tomatoes? For tomato 
juice? For orange juice?
8. The market for pizza has the following demand and 
supply schedules:

a. Graph the demand and supply curves. What are 
the equilibrium price and quantity in this market? 
b. If the actual price in this market were above the 
equilibrium price, what would drive the market 
toward the equilibrium? 
c. If the actual price in this market were below the 
equilibrium price, what would drive the market 
toward the equilibrium?
9. Consider the following events: Scientists reveal that 
eating oranges decreases the risk of diabetes, and at 
the same time, farmers use a new fertilizer that makes 
orange trees produce more oranges. Illustrate and  
explain what effect these changes have on the  
equilibrium price and quantity of oranges.
10. Because bagels and cream cheese are often eaten  
together, they are complements.
a. We observe that both the equilibrium price of cream 
cheese and the equilibrium quantity of  bagels have 
risen. What could be responsible for this pattern—a 
fall in the price of flour or a fall in the price of milk? 
Illustrate and explain your answer.
b. Suppose instead that the equilibrium price of 
cream cheese has risen but the equilibrium 
quantity of bagels has fallen. What could be 
responsible for this pattern—a rise in the price of 
flour or a rise in the price of milk? Illustrate and 
explain your answer.
11. Suppose that the price of basketball tickets at your 
college is determined by market forces. Currently, the 
demand and supply schedules are as follows:

a. Draw the demand and supply curves. What is 
unusual about this supply curve? Why might this 
be true?
b. What are the equilibrium price and quantity of 
tickets?
c. Your college plans to increase total enrollment 
next year by 5,000 students. The additional stu-
dents will have the following demand schedule:

demand schedule for the new students to  
calculate the new demand schedule for the  
entire college. What will be the new  
equilibrium price and quantity?

CHAPTER
5
Elasticity and Its Application
I
magine that some event drives up the price of gasoline in the United States. It 
could be a war in the Middle East that disrupts the world supply of oil, a boom-
ing Chinese economy that boosts the world demand for oil, or a new tax on gaso-
line passed by Congress. How would U.S. consumers respond to the higher price?
It is easy to answer this question in a broad fashion: Consumers would buy 
less. This conclusion follows from the law of demand, which we learned in the 
previous chapter. But you might want a precise answer. By how much would con-
sumption of gasoline fall? This question can be answered using a concept called 
elasticity, which we develop in this chapter.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
Elasticity is a measure of how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in 
market conditions. When studying how some event or policy affects a market, we 
can discuss not only the direction of the effects but also their magnitude. Elasticity 
is useful in many applications, as we see toward the end of this chapter.
Before proceeding, however, you might be curious about the answer to the 
gasoline question. Many studies have examined consumers’ response to changes 
in gasoline prices, and they typically find that the quantity demanded responds 
more in the long run than it does in the short run. A 10 percent increase in gaso-
line prices reduces gasoline consumption by about 2.5 percent after a year and 
by about 6 percent after 5 years. About half of the long-run reduction in quantity 
demanded arises because people drive less, and half arises because they switch to 
more fuel-efficient cars. Both responses are reflected in the demand curve and its 
elasticity.
5-1 The Elasticity of Demand
When we introduced demand in Chapter 4, we noted that consumers usually 
buy more of a good when its price is lower, when their incomes are higher, when 
the prices of its substitutes are higher, or when the prices of its complements are 
lower. Our discussion of demand was qualitative, not quantitative. That is, we 
discussed the direction in which quantity demanded moves but not the size of the 
change. To measure how much consumers respond to changes in these variables, 
economists use the concept of elasticity. 
5-1a The Price Elasticity of Demand and Its Determinants
The law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity 
demanded. The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity 
 demanded responds to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic
if the quantity demanded responds substantially to changes in the price. Demand 
is said to be inelastic if the quantity demanded responds only slightly to changes 
in the price.
The price elasticity of demand for any good measures how willing consum-
ers are to buy less of the good as its price rises. Because a demand curve reflects 
the many economic, social, and psychological forces that shape consumer pref-
erences, there is no simple, universal rule for what determines a demand curve’s 
elasticity. Based on experience, however, we can state some rules of thumb about 
what influences the price elasticity of demand.
Availability of Close Substitutes  Goods with close substitutes tend to have 
more elastic demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from that good 
to  others. For example, butter and margarine are easily substitutable. A small 
 increase in the price of butter, assuming the price of margarine is held fixed, 
causes the quantity of butter sold to fall by a large amount. By contrast, because 
eggs are a food without a close substitute, the demand for eggs is less elastic 
than the  demand for butter. A small increase in the price of eggs does not cause a 
 sizable drop in the quantity of eggs sold.
Necessities versus Luxuries  Necessities tend to have inelastic demands, whereas 
luxuries have elastic demands. When the price of a doctor’s visit rises, people do 
not dramatically reduce the number of times they go to the doctor, although they

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
might go somewhat less often. By contrast, when the price of sailboats rises, the 
quantity of sailboats demanded falls substantially. The reason is that most people 
view doctor visits as a necessity and sailboats as a luxury. Whether a good is a 
necessity or a luxury depends not on the intrinsic properties of the good but on 
the preferences of the buyer. For avid sailors with little concern about their health, 
sailboats might be a necessity with inelastic demand and doctor visits a luxury 
with elastic demand. 
Definition of the Market  The elasticity of demand in any market depends on 
how we draw the boundaries of the market. Narrowly defined markets tend to 
have more elastic demand than broadly defined markets because it is easier to 
find close substitutes for narrowly defined goods. For example, food, a broad 
category, has a fairly inelastic demand because there are no good substitutes for 
food. Ice cream, a narrower category, has a more elastic demand because it is easy 
to substitute other desserts for ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, a very narrow cat-
egory, has a very elastic demand because other flavors of ice cream are almost 
perfect substitutes for vanilla. 
Time Horizon  Goods tend to have more elastic demand over longer time 
 horizons. When the price of gasoline rises, the quantity of gasoline demanded 
falls only slightly in the first few months. Over time, however, people buy more 
fuel-efficient cars, switch to public transportation, and move closer to where 
they work. Within several years, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls more 
substantially.
5-1b Computing the Price Elasticity of Demand
Now that we have discussed the price elasticity of demand in general terms, let’s 
be more precise about how it is measured. Economists compute the price elastic-
ity of demand as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the 
percentage change in the price. That is, 
price elasticity of demand 5
percentage change in quantity demanded
percentage change in price
For example, suppose that a 10 percent increase in the price of an ice-cream cone 
causes the amount of ice cream you buy to fall by 20 percent. We calculate your 
elasticity of demand as 
price elasticity of demand 5
20 percent
5 2
10 percent
In this example, the elasticity is 2, reflecting that the change in the quantity 
 demanded is proportionately twice as large as the change in the price.
Because the quantity demanded of a good is negatively related to its price, the 
percentage change in quantity will always have the opposite sign as the percent-
age change in price. In this example, the percentage change in price is a positive
10 percent (reflecting an increase), and the percentage change in quantity 
 demanded is a negative 20 percent (reflecting a decrease). For this reason, price 
elasticities of demand are sometimes reported as negative numbers. In this book, 
we follow the common practice of dropping the minus sign and reporting all price

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
elasticities of demand as positive numbers. (Mathematicians call this the absolute 
value.) With this convention, a larger price elasticity implies a greater responsive-
ness of quantity demanded to changes in price.
5-1c  The Midpoint Method: A Better Way to Calculate  
Percentage Changes and Elasticities
If you try calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points on a 
 demand curve, you will quickly notice an annoying problem: The elasticity from 
point A to point B seems different from the elasticity from point B to point A. For 
example, consider these numbers:
point A: 
price 5 $4 
quantity 5 120
point B: 
price 5 $6 
quantity 5 80
Going from point A to point B, the price rises by 50 percent and the quantity 
falls by 33 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 33/50, or 
0.66.  Going from point B to point A, the price falls by 33 percent and the quan-
tity rises by 50 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 50/33, 
or 1.5. This difference arises because the percentage changes are calculated 
from a different base.
One way to avoid this problem is to use the midpoint method for calculating 
elasticities. The standard procedure for computing a percentage change is to 
 divide the change by the initial level. By contrast, the midpoint method computes 
a percentage change by dividing the change by the midpoint (or average) of the 
initial and final levels. For instance, $5 is the midpoint between $4 and $6. There-
fore, according to the midpoint method, a change from $4 to $6 is considered a 
40 percent rise because (6 2 4) / 5 3 100 5 40. Similarly, a change from $6 to $4  
is considered a 40 percent fall.
Because the midpoint method gives the same answer regardless of the direc-
tion of change, it is often used when calculating the price elasticity of demand 
between two points. In our example, the midpoint between point A and point B is:
midpoint: 
price 5 $5 
quantity 5 100
According to the midpoint method, when going from point A to point B, the price 
rises by 40 percent and the quantity falls by 40 percent. Similarly, when going 
from point B to point A, the price falls by 40 percent and the quantity rises by  
40 percent. In both directions, the price elasticity of demand equals 1. 
The following formula expresses the midpoint method for calculating the price 
elasticity of demand between two points, denoted (Q1, P1) and (Q2, P2):
price elasticity of demand 5
(Q2 2 Q1) / [(Q2 1 Q1) / 2]
(P2 2 P1) / [(P2 1 P1) / 2]
The numerator is the percentage change in quantity computed using the mid-
point method, and the denominator is the percentage change in price computed 
using the midpoint method. If you ever need to calculate elasticities, you should 
use this formula.
In this book, however, we rarely perform such calculations. For most of our 
purposes, what elasticity represents—the responsiveness of quantity demanded 
to a change in price—is more important than how it is calculated.

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
5-1d The Variety of Demand Curves 
Economists classify demand curves according to their elasticity. Demand is con-
sidered elastic when the elasticity is greater than 1, which means the quantity 
moves proportionately more than the price. Demand is considered inelastic when 
the elasticity is less than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately 
less than the price. If the elasticity is exactly 1, the percentage change in quantity 
equals the percentage change in price, and demand is said to have unit elasticity. 
Because the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity  demanded 
responds to changes in the price, it is closely related to the slope of the demand 
curve. The following rule of thumb is a useful guide: The flatter the demand curve 
that passes through a given point, the greater the price elasticity of demand. The 
steeper the demand curve that passes through a given point, the smaller the price 
elasticity of demand.
Figure 1 shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, shown in 
panel (a), demand is perfectly inelastic, and the demand curve is vertical. In this 
case, regardless of the price, the quantity demanded stays the same. As the elas-
ticity rises, the demand curve gets flatter and flatter, as shown in panels (b), (c), 
and (d). At the opposite extreme, shown in panel (e), demand is perfectly elastic. 
This occurs as the price elasticity of demand approaches infinity and the demand 
curve becomes horizontal, reflecting the fact that very small changes in the price 
lead to huge changes in the quantity demanded.
Finally, if you have trouble keeping straight the terms elastic and inelastic, here’s 
a memory trick for you: Inelastic curves, such as in panel (a) of Figure 1, look like 
the letter I. This is not a deep insight, but it might help on your next exam.
A Few Elasticities from the Real World
W
e have talked about what elasticity means, what determines it, and 
how it is calculated. Beyond these general ideas, you might ask for 
a specific number. How much, precisely, does the price of a particular 
good influence the quantity demanded?
To answer such a question, economists collect data from market out-
comes and apply statistical techniques to estimate the price elasticity 
of demand. Here are some price elasticities of demand, obtained from 
various studies, for a range of goods:
These kinds of numbers are 
fun to think about, and they 
can be useful when compar-
ing markets.
Nonetheless, one 
should take these estimates 
with a grain of salt. One rea-
son is that the statistical techniques used to obtain them require some 
 assumptions about the world, and these assumptions might not be true 
in practice. (The details of these techniques are beyond the scope of this 
book, but you will encounter them if you take a course in econometrics.) 
Another reason is that the price  elasticity of demand need not be the 
same at all points on a demand curve, as we will see shortly in the case 
of a linear demand curve. For both reasons, you should not be surprised 
if different studies report different price elasticities of demand for the 
same good. ■

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
5-1e Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand
When studying changes in supply or demand in a market, one variable we often 
want to study is total revenue, the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers 
of a good. In any market, total revenue is P 3 Q, the price of the good times the 
quantity of the good sold. We can show total revenue graphically, as in Figure 2. 
The height of the box under the demand curve is P, and the width is Q. The area 
of this box, P 3 Q, equals the total revenue in this market. In Figure 2, where  
P 5 $4 and Q 5 100, total revenue is $4 3 100, or $400.
How does total revenue change as one moves along the demand curve? The 
 answer depends on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic, as in 
panel (a) of Figure 3, then an increase in the price causes an increase in total 
 revenue. Here an increase in price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to 
fall from 100 to 90, so total revenue rises from $400 to $450. An increase in price 
raises P 3 Q because the fall in Q is proportionately smaller than the rise in P. In 
other words, the extra revenue from selling units at a higher price (represented by 
area A in the figure) more than offsets the decline in revenue from selling fewer 
units (represented by area B).
We obtain the opposite result if demand is elastic: An increase in the price 
causes a decrease in total revenue. In panel (b) of Figure 3, for instance, when the 
price rises from $4 to $5, the quantity demanded falls from 100 to 70, so total rev-
enue falls from $400 to $350. Because demand is elastic, the reduction in the quan-
tity demanded is so great that it more than offsets the increase in the price. That is, 
an increase in price reduces P 3 Q because the fall in Q is proportionately greater 
than the rise in P. In this case, the extra revenue from selling units at a higher price 
(area A) is smaller than the decline in revenue from selling fewer units (area B).
The examples in this figure illustrate some general rules:
r When demand is inelastic (a price elasticity less than 1), price and total  
revenue move in the same direction: If the price increases, total revenue  
also increases.

r When demand is elastic (a price elasticity greater than 1), price and total 
revenue move in opposite directions: If the price increases, total revenue 
decreases.
r If demand is unit elastic (a price elasticity exactly equal to 1), total revenue 
remains constant when the price changes.
5-1f Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve
Let’s examine how elasticity varies along a linear demand curve, as shown in 
Figure 4. We know that a straight line has a constant slope. Slope is defined as 
“rise over run,” which here is the ratio of the change in price (“rise”) to the change 
in quantity (“run”). This particular demand curve’s slope is constant because each 
$1 increase in price causes the same 2-unit decrease in the quantity demanded. 
Even though the slope of a linear demand curve is constant, the elasticity is not. 
This is true because the slope is the ratio of changes in the two variables, whereas 
the elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in the two variables. You can see 
this by looking at the table in Figure 4, which shows the demand schedule for the 
FIGURE 3
How Total Revenue Changes 
When Price Changes
The impact of a price change on total revenue (the product of price and quantity)  
depends on the elasticity of demand. In panel (a), the demand curve is inelastic.  
In this case, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that  
is proportionately smaller, so total revenue increases. Here an increase in the price 
from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to fall from 100 to 90. Total revenue 
rises from $400 to $450. In panel (b), the demand curve is elastic. In this case,  
an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is proportion-
ately larger, so total revenue decreases. Here an increase in the price from $4 to  
$5 causes the quantity demanded to fall from 100 to 70. Total revenue falls from 
$400 to $350.

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
linear demand curve in the graph. The table uses the midpoint method to calcu-
late the price elasticity of demand. The table illustrates the following: At points 
with a low price and high quantity, the demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high 
price and low quantity, the demand curve is elastic. 
The explanation for this fact comes from the arithmetic of percentage changes. 
When the price is low and consumers are buying a lot, a $1 price increase and 
2-unit reduction in quantity demanded constitute a large percentage increase in 
the price and a small percentage decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in a 
small elasticity. When the price is high and consumers are not buying much, the 
same $1 price increase and 2-unit reduction in quantity demanded constitute a 
small percentage increase in the price and a large percentage decrease in quantity 
demanded, resulting in a large elasticity.
The table also presents total revenue at each point on the demand curve. These 
numbers illustrate the relationship between total revenue and elasticity. When the 
price is $1, for instance, demand is inelastic and a price increase to $2 raises total 
revenue. When the price is $5, demand is elastic and a price increase to $6 reduces 
total revenue. Between $3 and $4, demand is exactly unit elastic and total revenue 
is the same at these two prices.

Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve
The slope of a linear demand curve is constant, but its  
elasticity is not. The price elasticity of demand is calculated 
using the demand schedule in the table and the midpoint 
method. At points with a low price and high quantity, the  
demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high price and 
low quantity, the demand curve is elastic.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
The linear demand curve illustrates that the price elasticity of demand need 
not be the same at all points on a demand curve. A constant elasticity is possible, 
but it is not always the case.
5-1g Other Demand Elasticities 
In addition to the price elasticity of demand, economists use other elasticities to 
describe the behavior of buyers in a market. 
The Income Elasticity of Demand  The income elasticity of demand measures 
how the quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes. It is calcu-
lated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage 
change in income. That is,
income elasticity of demand 5
percentage change in quantity demanded
percentage change in income
As we discussed in Chapter 4, most goods are normal goods: Higher income raises 
the quantity demanded. Because quantity demanded and income move in the 
same direction, normal goods have positive income elasticities. A few goods, such 
as bus rides, are inferior goods: Higher income lowers the quantity demanded. 
 Because quantity demanded and income move in opposite directions, inferior 
goods have negative income elasticities.
Even among normal goods, income elasticities vary substantially in size. 
 Necessities, such as food and clothing, tend to have small income elasticities 
 because consumers choose to buy some of these goods even when their  incomes 
are low. Luxuries, such as caviar and diamonds, tend to have large  income 
 elasticities because consumers feel that they can do without these goods  altogether 
if their incomes are too low. 
The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand  The cross-price elasticity of demand mea-
sures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price 
of another good. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded of 
good 1 divided by the percentage change in the price of good 2. That is,
cross-price elasticity of demand 5
percentage change in quantity demanded of good 1
percentage change in the price of good 2
Whether the cross-price elasticity is a positive or negative number depends 
on whether the two goods are substitutes or complements. As we discussed in 
Chapter 4, substitutes are goods that are typically used in place of one another, 
such as hamburgers and hot dogs. An increase in hot dog prices induces peo-
ple to grill hamburgers instead. Because the price of hot dogs and the quantity 
of hamburgers demanded move in the same direction, the cross-price elasticity 
is positive. Conversely, complements are goods that are typically used together, 
such as computers and software. In this case, the cross-price elasticity is nega-
tive, indicating that an increase in the price of computers reduces the quantity of 
software demanded.

total revenue and the price elasticity of demand.

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
5-2 The Elasticity of Supply
When we introduced supply in Chapter 4, we noted that producers of a good  offer to 
sell more of it when the price of the good rises. To turn from qualitative to quantita-
tive statements about quantity supplied, we once again use the concept of elasticity.
5-2a The Price Elasticity of Supply and Its Determinants
The law of supply states that higher prices raise the quantity supplied. The price 
elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds to 
changes in the price. Supply of a good is said to be elastic if the quantity supplied 
responds substantially to changes in the price. Supply is said to be inelastic if the 
quantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the price.
The price elasticity of supply depends on the flexibility of sellers to change the 
amount of the good they produce. For example, beachfront land has an inelas-
tic supply because it is almost impossible to produce more of it. Manufactured 
goods, such as books, cars, and televisions, have elastic supplies because firms 
that produce them can run their factories longer in response to a higher price.
In most markets, a key determinant of the price elasticity of supply is the time 
period being considered. Supply is usually more elastic in the long run than in the 
short run. Over short periods of time, firms cannot easily change the size of their 
factories to make more or less of a good. Thus, in the short run, the quantity sup-
plied is not very responsive to the price. Over longer periods of time, firms can 
build new factories or close old ones. In addition, new firms can enter a market, 
and old firms can exit. Thus, in the long run, the quantity supplied can respond 
substantially to price changes.
5-2b Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply
Now that we have a general understanding about the price elasticity of supply, 
let’s be more precise. Economists compute the price elasticity of supply as the 
percentage change in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in 
the price. That is, 
price elasticity of supply 5
percentage change in quantity supplied
percentage change in price
For example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a gal-
lon raises the amount that dairy farmers produce from 9,000 to 11,000 gallons per 
month. Using the midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in price as
percentage change in price 5 (3.15 2 2.85) / 3.00 3 100 5 10 percent
Similarly, we calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as:
Percentage change in quantity supplied 5 (11,000 2 9,000) / 10,000 3 100 5 20 percent.
In this case, the price elasticity of supply is 
price elasticity of supply 5
20 percent
5 2
10 percent
In this example, the elasticity of 2 indicates that the quantity supplied changes 
proportionately twice as much as the price.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
5-2c The Variety of Supply Curves
Because the price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity 
supplied to changes in price, it is reflected in the appearance of the supply curve. 
Figure 5 (on the facing page) shows five cases. In the extreme case of zero elasticity, 
as shown in panel (a), supply is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is verti-
cal. In this case, the quantity supplied is the same regardless of the price. As the 
elasticity rises, the supply curve gets flatter, which shows that the quantity sup-
plied responds more to changes in the price. At the opposite extreme, shown in 
panel (e), supply is perfectly elastic. This occurs as the price elasticity of supply 
approaches infinity and the supply curve becomes horizontal, meaning that very 
small changes in the price lead to very large changes in the quantity supplied.
In some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the sup-
ply curve. Figure 6 (presented below) shows a typical case for an industry in which 
firms have factories with a limited capacity for production. For low levels of quantity 
supplied, the elasticity of supply is high, indicating that firms respond substantially to 
changes in the price. In this region, firms have capacity for production that is not be-
ing used, such as plants and equipment that are idle for all or part of the day. Small 
increases in price make it profitable for firms to begin using this idle capacity. As the 
quantity supplied rises, firms begin to reach capacity. Once capacity is fully used, fur-
ther increases in production require the construction of new plants. To induce firms to 
incur this extra expense, the price must rise substantially, so supply becomes less elastic.
Figure 6 presents a numerical example of this phenomenon. When the price 
rises from $3 to $4 (a 29 percent increase, according to the midpoint method), the 
quantity supplied rises from 100 to 200 (a 67 percent increase). Because quan-
tity supplied changes proportionately more than the price, the supply curve 
has an elasticity greater than 1. By contrast, when the price rises from $12 to $15 
(a 22 percent increase), the quantity supplied rises from 500 to 525 (a 5 percent 
increase). In this case, quantity supplied moves proportionately less than the 
price, so the elasticity is less than 1.
Define the price elasticity of supply. t Explain why the price elasticity of 
supply might be different in the long run than in the short run.
QuickQuiz
FIGURE 6
How the Price Elasticity of Supply Can Vary
Because firms often have a maximum capacity for 
production, the elasticity of supply may be very high 
at low levels of quantity supplied and very low at 
high levels of quantity supplied. Here an increase in 
price from $3 to $4 increases the quantity supplied 
from 100 to 200. Because the 67 percent increase 
in quantity supplied (computed using the midpoint 
method) is larger than the 29 percent increase in 
price, the supply curve is elastic in this range. By 
contrast, when the price rises from $12 to $15, 
the quantity supplied rises only from 500 to 525. 
Because the 5 percent increase in quantity supplied 
is smaller than the 22 percent increase in price, the 
supply curve is inelastic in this range.

5-3  Three Applications of Supply, Demand, and Elasticity
Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers? Why did OPEC, the in-
ternational oil cartel, fail to keep the price of oil high? Does drug interdiction 
increase or decrease drug-related crime? At first, these questions might seem to 
have little in common. Yet all three questions are about markets, and all mar-
kets are subject to the forces of supply and demand. Here we apply the versa-
tile tools of supply, demand, and elasticity to answer these seemingly complex 
questions.
5-3a Can Good News for Farming Be Bad News for Farmers?
Imagine you’re a Kansas wheat farmer. Because you earn all your income from 
selling wheat, you devote much effort to making your land as productive as pos-
sible. You monitor weather and soil conditions, check your fields for pests and 
disease, and study the latest advances in farm technology. You know that the 
more wheat you grow, the more you will have to sell after the harvest, and the 
higher your income and standard of living will be. 
One day, Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers 
in its agronomy department have devised a new hybrid of wheat that raises the 
amount farmers can produce from each acre of land by 20 percent. How should 
you react to this news? Does this discovery make you better off or worse off than 
you were before?
Recall from Chapter 4 that we answer such questions in three steps. First, 
we examine whether the supply or demand curve shifts. Second, we consider 
the  direction in which the curve shifts. Third, we use the supply-and-demand 
 diagram to see how the market equilibrium changes.
In this case, the discovery of the new hybrid affects the supply curve.  Because 
the hybrid increases the amount of wheat that can be produced on each acre of 
land, farmers are now willing to supply more wheat at any given price. In other 
words, the supply curve shifts to the right. The demand curve remains the 
same because consumers’ desire to buy wheat products at any given price is not 
affected by the introduction of a new hybrid. Figure 7 shows an example of 
such a change. When the supply curve shifts from S1 to S2, the quantity of 
wheat sold increases from 100 to 110 and the price of wheat falls from $3 
to $2.
Does this discovery make farmers better off? As a first cut to answering 
this question, consider what happens to the total revenue received by farmers. 
 Farmers’ total revenue is P 3 Q, the price of the wheat times the quantity sold. 
The discovery affects farmers in two conflicting ways. The hybrid allows farm-
ers to produce more wheat (Q rises), but now each bushel of wheat sells for less 
(P falls). 
The price elasticity of demand determines whether total revenue rises or falls. 
In practice, the demand for basic foodstuffs such as wheat is usually inelastic 
 because these items are relatively inexpensive and have few good substitutes. 
When the demand curve is inelastic, as it is in Figure 7, a decrease in price causes 
total revenue to fall. You can see this in the figure: The price of wheat falls sub-
stantially, whereas the quantity of wheat sold rises only slightly. Total revenue 
falls from $300 to $220. Thus, the discovery of the new hybrid lowers the total 
revenue that farmers receive from the sale of their crops.

103
CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
If farmers are made worse off by the discovery of this new hybrid, one might 
wonder why they adopt it. The answer goes to the heart of how competitive 
markets work. Because each farmer is only a small part of the market for wheat, 
she takes the price of wheat as given. For any given price of wheat, it is better 
to use the new hybrid to produce and sell more wheat. Yet when all farmers do 
this, the supply of wheat increases, the price falls, and farmers are worse off. 
This example may at first seem hypothetical, but it helps to explain a major 
change in the U.S. economy over the past century. Two hundred years ago, most 
Americans lived on farms. Knowledge about farm methods was sufficiently prim-
itive that most Americans had to be farmers to produce enough food to feed the 
nation’s population. But over time, advances in farm technology increased the 
amount of food that each farmer could produce. This increase in food supply, 
together with the inelastic demand for food, caused farm revenues to fall, which 
in turn encouraged people to leave farming.
A few numbers show the magnitude of this historic change. As recently as 
1950, 10 million people worked on farms in the United States, representing 
17 percent of the labor force. Today, fewer than 3 million people work on farms, 
or 2 percent of the labor force. This change coincided with tremendous advances 
in farm productivity: Despite the large drop in the number of farmers, U.S. farms 
now produce about five times as much output as they did in 1950.
This analysis of the market for farm products also explains a seeming paradox 
of public policy: Certain farm programs try to help farmers by inducing them not
to plant crops on all of their land. The purpose of these programs is to reduce the 
supply of farm products and thereby raise prices. With inelastic demand for their 
products, farmers as a group receive greater total revenue if they supply a smaller 
crop to the market. No single farmer would choose to leave her land fallow on 
her own because each takes the market price as given. But if all farmers do so 
together, they can all be better off.
FIGURE 7
An Increase in Supply in the Market for Wheat
When an advance in farm technology increases the 
supply of wheat from S1 to S2, the price of wheat 
falls. Because the demand for wheat is inelastic, the 
increase in the quantity sold from 100 to 110 is  
proportionately smaller than the decrease in the price 
from $3 to $2. As a result, farmers’ total revenue 
falls from $300 ($3 3 100) to $220 ($2 3 110).

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
When analyzing the effects of farm technology or farm policy, it is important to 
keep in mind that what is good for farmers is not necessarily good for society as a 
whole. Improvement in farm technology can be bad for farmers because it makes 
farmers increasingly unnecessary, but it is surely good for consumers who pay 
less for food. Similarly, a policy aimed at reducing the supply of farm products 
may raise the incomes of farmers, but it does so at the expense of consumers.
5-3b Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High?
Many of the most disruptive events for the world’s economies over the past sev-
eral decades have originated in the world market for oil. In the 1970s, members of 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to raise 
the world price of oil to increase their incomes. These countries accomplished this 
goal by agreeing to jointly reduce the amount of oil they supplied. As a result, the 
price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) rose more than 50 percent from 1973 to 
1974. Then, a few years later, OPEC did the same thing again. From 1979 to 1981, 
the price of oil approximately doubled. 
Yet OPEC found it difficult to maintain such a high price. From 1982 to 1985, 
the price of oil steadily declined about 10 percent per year. Dissatisfaction and 
disarray soon prevailed among the OPEC countries. In 1986, cooperation among 
OPEC members completely broke down, and the price of oil plunged 45 percent. 
In 1990, the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) was back to where it be-
gan in 1970, and it stayed at that low level throughout most of the 1990s. (In the 
first decade and a half of the 21st century, the price of oil fluctuated substantially 
once again, but the main driving force was not OPEC supply restrictions. Instead, 
booms and busts in economies around the world caused demand to fluctuate, 
while advances in fracking technology caused large increases in supply.)
The OPEC episodes of the 1970s and 1980s show how supply and demand can 
behave differently in the short run and in the long run. In the short run, both 
the supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic. Supply is inelastic because 
the quantity of known oil reserves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be 
changed quickly. Demand is inelastic because buying habits do not respond im-
mediately to changes in price. Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 8 shows, the short-run

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
supply and demand curves are steep. When the supply of oil shifts from S1 to S2, 
the price increase from P1 to P2 is large.
The situation is very different in the long run. Over long periods of time, pro-
ducers of oil outside OPEC respond to high prices by increasing oil exploration 
and by building new extraction capacity. Consumers respond with greater conser-
vation, such as by replacing old inefficient cars with newer efficient ones. Thus, 
as panel (b) of Figure 8 shows, the long-run supply and demand curves are more 
elastic. In the long run, the shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2 causes a much 
smaller increase in the price.
This analysis shows why OPEC succeeded in maintaining a high price of oil 
only in the short run. When OPEC countries agreed to reduce their production 
of oil, they shifted the supply curve to the left. Even though each OPEC member 
sold less oil, the price rose by so much in the short run that OPEC incomes rose. In 
the long run, however, supply and demand are more elastic.  As a result, the same 
reduction in supply, measured by the horizontal shift in the supply curve, caused 
a smaller increase in the price. Thus, OPEC’s coordinated reduction in supply 
proved less profitable in the long run. The cartel learned that raising prices is eas-
ier in the short run than in the long run.
5-3c  Does Drug Interdiction Increase or Decrease  
Drug-Related Crime?
A persistent problem facing our society is the use of illegal drugs, such as heroin, 
cocaine, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. Drug use has several adverse effects. 
One is that drug dependence can ruin the lives of drug users and their families.

When the supply of oil falls, the response depends on the time horizon. In the short run, 
supply and demand are relatively inelastic, as in panel (a). Thus, when the supply curve 
shifts from S1 to S2, the price rises substantially. In the long run, however, supply and  
demand are relatively elastic, as in panel (b). In this case, the same size shift in the  
supply curve (S1 to S2) causes a smaller increase in the price.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
Another is that drug addicts often turn to robbery and other violent crimes to 
obtain the money needed to support their habit. To discourage the use of illegal 
drugs, the U.S. government devotes billions of dollars each year to reducing the 
flow of drugs into the country. Let’s use the tools of supply and demand to exam-
ine this policy of drug interdiction.
Suppose the government increases the number of federal agents devoted to the 
war on drugs. What happens in the market for illegal drugs? As usual, we answer 
this question in three steps. First, we consider whether the supply or demand 
curve shifts. Second, we consider the direction of the shift. Third, we see how the 
shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.
Although the purpose of drug interdiction is to reduce drug use, its direct 
impact is on the sellers of drugs rather than on the buyers. When the government 
stops some drugs from entering the country and arrests more smugglers, it raises 
the cost of selling drugs and, therefore, reduces the quantity of drugs supplied at 
any given price. The demand for drugs—the amount buyers want at any given 
price—remains the same. As panel (a) of Figure 9 shows, interdiction shifts the 
supply curve to the left from S1 to S2 without changing the demand curve. The 
equilibrium price of drugs rises from P1 to P2, and the equilibrium quantity falls 
from Q1 to Q2. The fall in the equilibrium quantity shows that drug interdiction 
does reduce drug use.
But what about the amount of drug-related crime? To answer this question, 
consider the total amount that drug users pay for the drugs they buy. Because few

Drug interdiction reduces the supply of drugs from S1 to S2, as in panel (a). If the demand 
for drugs is inelastic, then the total amount paid by drug users rises, even as the amount of 
drug use falls. By contrast, drug education reduces the demand for drugs from D1 to D2, as 
in panel (b). Because both price and quantity fall, the amount paid by drug users falls.

CHAPTER 5   ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION
drug addicts are likely to break their destructive habits in response to a higher 
price, it is likely that the demand for drugs is inelastic, as it is drawn in the  figure. 
If demand is inelastic, then an increase in price raises total revenue in the drug 
market. That is, because drug interdiction raises the price of drugs proportion-
ately more than it reduces drug use, it raises the total amount of money that drug 
users pay for drugs. Addicts who already had to steal to support their habits 
would have an even greater need for quick cash. Thus, drug interdiction could 
increase drug-related crime. 
Because of this adverse effect of drug interdiction, some analysts argue for 
 alternative approaches to the drug problem. Rather than trying to reduce the sup-
ply of drugs, policymakers might try to reduce the demand by pursuing a policy 
of drug education. Successful drug education has the effects shown in panel (b) 
of Figure 9. The demand curve shifts to the left from D1 to D2. As a result, the 
equilibrium quantity falls from Q1 to Q2, and the equilibrium price falls from P1
to P2. Total revenue, P 3 Q, also falls. Thus, in contrast to drug interdiction, drug 
education can reduce both drug use and drug-related crime.
Advocates of drug interdiction might argue that the long-run effects of this pol-
icy are different from the short-run effects because the elasticity of demand 
 depends on the time horizon. The demand for drugs is probably inelastic over 
short periods because higher prices do not substantially affect drug use by estab-
lished addicts. But demand may be more elastic over longer periods because 
higher prices would discourage experimentation with drugs among the young 
and, over time, lead to fewer drug addicts. In this case, drug interdiction would 
increase drug-related crime in the short run but decrease it in the long run.
How might a drought that destroys half of all farm crops be good for farm-
ers? If such a drought is good for farmers, why don’t farmers destroy their 
own crops in the absence of a drought?
5-4 Conclusion
According to an old quip, even a parrot can become an economist simply by learn-
ing to say “supply and demand.” These last two chapters should have convinced 
you that there is much truth to this statement. The tools of supply and demand 
allow you to analyze many of the most important events and policies that shape 
the economy. You are now well on your way to becoming an economist (or at least 
a well-educated parrot).

SUMMARY
r The price elasticity of demand measures how much the 
quantity demanded responds to changes in the price. 
Demand tends to be more elastic if close substitutes are 
available, if the good is a luxury rather than a necessity, 
if the market is narrowly defined, or if buyers have 
substantial time to react to a price change.
r The price elasticity of demand is calculated as the 
percentage change in quantity demanded divided by 
the percentage change in price. If quantity demanded 
moves proportionately less than the price, then the 
elasticity is less than 1 and demand is said to be inelas-
tic. If quantity demanded moves proportionately more 
than the price, then the elasticity is greater than 1 and 
demand is said to be elastic.
r Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, 
equals the price of the good times the quantity sold. 
For inelastic demand curves, total revenue moves in 
the same direction as the price. For elastic demand 
curves, total revenue moves in the opposite direction 
as the price.
r The income elasticity of demand measures how 
much the quantity demanded responds to changes 
in consumers’ income. The cross-price elasticity of  
demand measures how much the quantity demanded 
of one good responds to changes in the price of  
another good. 
r The price elasticity of supply measures how much the 
quantity supplied responds to changes in the price. 
This elasticity often depends on the time horizon 
 under consideration. In most markets, supply is more 
elastic in the long run than in the short run.
r The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the per-
centage change in quantity supplied divided by the 
percentage change in price. If quantity supplied moves 
proportionately less than the price, then the elasticity is 
less than 1 and supply is said to be inelastic. If quantity 
supplied moves proportionately more than the price, 
then the elasticity is greater than 1 and supply is said 
to be elastic.
r The tools of supply and demand can be applied in 
many different kinds of markets. This chapter uses 
them to analyze the market for wheat, the market for 
oil, and the market for illegal drugs.

E
conomists have two roles. As scientists, they develop and test theories to 
 explain the world around them. As policy advisers, they use these theo-
ries to help change the world for the better. The focus of the preceding two 
chapters has been scientific. We have seen how supply and demand determine 
the price of a good and the quantity of the good sold. We have also seen how 
 various events shift supply and demand, thereby changing the equilibrium 
price and quantity. And we have developed the concept of elasticity to gauge 
the size of these changes.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
This chapter offers our first look at policy. Here we analyze various types of 
government policy using only the tools of supply and demand. As you will see, 
the analysis yields some surprising insights. Policies often have effects that their 
architects did not intend or anticipate.
We begin by considering policies that directly control prices. For  example, 
rent-control laws set a maximum rent that landlords may charge tenants. 
 Minimum-wage laws set the lowest wage that firms may pay workers. Price 
 controls are usually enacted when policymakers believe that the market price of a 
good or service is unfair to buyers or sellers. Yet, as we will see, these policies can 
generate inequities of their own. 
After discussing price controls, we consider the impact of taxes. Policymakers 
use taxes to raise revenue for public purposes and to influence market outcomes. 
Although the prevalence of taxes in our economy is obvious, their effects are not. 
For example, when the government levies a tax on the amount that firms pay their 
workers, do the firms or the workers bear the burden of the tax? The answer is not 
at all clear—until we apply the powerful tools of supply and demand.
6-1 Controls on Prices
To see how price controls affect market outcomes, let’s look once again at the mar-
ket for ice cream. As we saw in Chapter 4, if ice cream is sold in a competitive 
market free of government regulation, the price of ice cream adjusts to balance 
supply and demand: At the equilibrium price, the quantity of ice cream that buy-
ers want to buy exactly equals the quantity that sellers want to sell. To be concrete, 
let’s suppose that the equilibrium price is $3 per cone. 
Some people may not be happy with the outcome of this free-market process. 
The American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters complains that the $3 price is too 
high for everyone to enjoy a cone a day (their recommended daily allowance). 
Meanwhile, the National Organization of Ice-Cream Makers complains that the 
$3 price—the result of “cutthroat competition”—is too low and is depressing 
the incomes of its members. Each of these groups lobbies the government to 
pass laws that alter the market outcome by directly controlling the price of an 
ice-cream cone.
Because buyers of any good always want a lower price while sellers want a 
higher price, the interests of the two groups conflict. If the Ice-Cream Eaters are 
successful in their lobbying, the government imposes a legal maximum on the 
price at which ice-cream cones can be sold. Because the price is not allowed to rise 
above this level, the legislated maximum is called a price ceiling. By contrast, if 
the Ice-Cream Makers are successful, the government imposes a legal minimum 
on the price. Because the price cannot fall below this level, the legislated mini-
mum is called a price floor. Let us consider the effects of these policies in turn.
6-1a How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes
When the government, moved by the complaints and campaign contributions 
of the Ice-Cream Eaters, imposes a price ceiling in the market for ice cream, two 
outcomes are possible. In panel (a) of Figure 1, the government imposes a price 
ceiling of $4 per cone. In this case, because the price that balances supply and 
demand ($3) is below the ceiling, the price ceiling is not binding. Market forces 
naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price ceiling has no effect 
on the price or the quantity sold.

CHAPTER 6   SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows the other, more interesting, possibility. In this case, 
the government imposes a price ceiling of $2 per cone. Because the equilibrium 
price of $3 is above the price ceiling, the ceiling is a binding constraint on the mar-
ket. The forces of supply and demand tend to move the price toward the equilib-
rium price, but when the market price hits the ceiling, it cannot, by law, rise any 
further. Thus, the market price equals the price ceiling. At this price, the quantity 
of ice cream demanded (125 cones in the figure) exceeds the quantity supplied 
(75 cones). Because of this excess demand of 50 cones, some people who want 
to buy ice cream at the going price are unable to do so. In other words, there is a 
shortage of ice cream.
In response to this shortage, some mechanism for rationing ice cream will 
naturally develop. The mechanism could be long lines: Buyers who are willing 
to arrive early and wait in line get a cone, while those unwilling to wait do not. 
Alternatively, sellers could ration ice-cream cones according to their own personal 
biases, selling them only to friends, relatives, or members of their own racial or 
ethnic group. Notice that even though the price ceiling was motivated by a desire 
to help buyers of ice cream, not all buyers benefit from the policy. Some buyers do 
get to pay a lower price, although they may have to wait in line to do so, but other 
buyers cannot get any ice cream at all.
This example in the market for ice cream shows a general result: When the 
government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the 
good arises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential 
FIGURE 1
A Market with a Price Ceiling
In panel (a), the government imposes a price ceiling of $4. Because the price ceiling is 
above the equilibrium price of $3, the price ceiling has no effect, and the market can reach 
the equilibrium of supply and demand. In this equilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity 
demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price ceiling  
of $2. Because the price ceiling is below the equilibrium price of $3, the market price 
equals $2. At this price, 125 cones are demanded and only 75 are supplied, so there  
is a shortage of 50 cones.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
buyers. The rationing mechanisms that develop under price ceilings are rarely 
desirable. Long lines are inefficient because they waste buyers’ time. Discrimina-
tion according to seller bias is both inefficient (because the good may not go to 
the buyer who values it most highly) and often unfair. By contrast, the rationing 
mechanism in a free, competitive market is both efficient and impersonal. When 
the market for ice cream reaches its equilibrium, anyone who wants to pay the 
market price can get a cone. Free markets ration goods with prices. 
CASE 
STUDY
LINES AT THE GAS PUMP
As we discussed in Chapter 5, in 1973 the Organization of Petro-
leum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reduced production of crude oil, 
thereby increasing its price in world oil markets. Because crude oil is 
the major input used to make gasoline, the higher oil prices  reduced the supply 
of gasoline. Long lines at gas stations became commonplace, and motorists often 
had to wait for hours to buy only a few gallons of gas.
What was responsible for the long gas lines? Most people blame OPEC. Surely, 
if OPEC had not reduced production of crude oil, the shortage of gasoline would 
not have occurred. Yet economists blame the U.S. government regulations that 
limited the price oil companies could charge for gasoline.
Figure 2 reveals what happened. As panel (a) shows, before OPEC raised the 
price of crude oil, the equilibrium price of gasoline, P1, was below the price ceiling. 
The price regulation, therefore, had no effect. When the price of crude oil rose, how-
ever, the situation changed. The increase in the price of crude oil raised the cost of 
Panel (a) shows the gasoline market when the price ceiling is not binding because the equilib-
rium price, P1, is below the ceiling. Panel (b) shows the gasoline market after an increase in  
the price of crude oil (an input into making gasoline) shifts the supply curve to the left from  
S1 to S2. In an unregulated market, the price would have risen from P1 to P2. The price ceiling, 
however, prevents this from happening. At the binding price ceiling, consumers are willing to 
buy QD, but producers of gasoline are willing to sell only QS. The difference between quantity 
demanded and quantity supplied, QD – QS, measures the gasoline shortage.

producing gasoline, and this reduced the supply of gasoline. As panel (b) shows, 
the supply curve shifted to the left from S1 to S2. In an unregulated market, this 
shift in supply would have raised the equilibrium price of gasoline from P1 to P2, 
and no shortage would have resulted. Instead, the price ceiling prevented the price 
from rising to the equilibrium level. At the price ceiling, producers were willing to 
sell QS, but consumers were willing to buy QD. Thus, the shift in supply caused a 
severe shortage at the regulated price.
Eventually, the laws regulating the price of gasoline were repealed.  Lawmakers 
came to understand that they were partly responsible for the many hours 
 Americans lost waiting in line to buy gasoline. Today, when the price of crude 
oil changes, the price of gasoline can adjust to bring supply and demand into 
 equilibrium. ●

RENT CONTROL IN THE SHORT RUN AND THE LONG RUN
One common example of a price ceiling is rent control. In many 
cities, the local government places a ceiling on rents that landlords 
may charge their tenants. The goal of this policy is to help the poor 
by making housing more affordable. Economists often criticize rent control, 
 arguing that it is a highly inefficient way to help the poor raise their standard of 
living. One economist called rent control “the best way to destroy a city, other 
than bombing.”
The adverse effects of rent control are less apparent to the general population  
because these effects occur over many years. In the short run, landlords have a 
fixed number of apartments to rent, and they cannot adjust this number quickly as 
market conditions change. Moreover, the number of people searching for housing 
in a city may not be highly responsive to rents in the short run because people take 
time to adjust their housing arrangements. Therefore, the short-run supply and  
demand for housing are relatively inelastic. 
Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows the short-run effects of rent control on the hous-
ing market. As with any binding price ceiling, rent control causes a shortage. But 
 because supply and demand are inelastic in the short run, the initial shortage caused 
by rent control is small. The primary effect in the short run is to reduce rents.
The long-run story is very different because the buyers and sellers of rental 
housing respond more to market conditions as time passes. On the supply side, 
landlords respond to low rents by not building new apartments and by failing to 
maintain existing ones. On the demand side, low rents encourage people to find 
their own apartments (rather than living with their parents or sharing apartments 
with roommates) and induce more people to move into the city. Therefore, both 
supply and demand are more elastic in the long run. 
Panel (b) of Figure 3 illustrates the housing market in the long run. When 
rent control depresses rents below the equilibrium level, the quantity of apart-
ments supplied falls substantially and the quantity of apartments demanded rises 
 substantially. The result is a large shortage of housing.
In cities with rent control, landlords use various mechanisms to ration housing. 
Some landlords keep long waiting lists. Others give preference to tenants without 
children. Still others discriminate on the basis of race. Sometimes apartments are 
allocated to those willing to offer under-the-table payments to building superin-
tendents. In essence, these bribes bring the total price of an apartment closer to the 
equilibrium price.
To understand fully the effects of rent control, we have to remember one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In free

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
markets, landlords try to keep their buildings clean and safe 
because desirable apartments command higher prices. By con-
trast, when rent control creates  shortages and waiting lists, land-
lords lose their incentive to respond to tenants’ concerns. Why 
should a landlord spend money to maintain and improve the 
property when people are waiting to move in as it is? In the end, 
tenants get lower rents, but they also get lower-quality housing.
Policymakers often react to the effects of rent control by 
imposing additional regulations. For example, various laws make 
racial discrimination in housing  illegal and require landlords to 
provide minimally adequate living conditions. These laws, how-
ever, are difficult and costly to enforce. By contrast, when rent 
control is eliminated and a market for housing is regulated by the 
forces of competition, such laws are less necessary. In a free mar-
ket, the price of housing adjusts to eliminate the shortages that 
give rise to undesirable landlord behavior. ●
6-1b How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes
To examine the effects of another kind of government price con-
trol, let’s return to the market for ice cream. Imagine now that 
the government is persuaded by the pleas of the National Or-
ganization of Ice-Cream Makers whose members feel that the 
$3 equilibrium price is too low. In this case, the government 
might institute a price floor. Price floors, like price ceilings, are 
an attempt by the government to maintain prices at other than 
Panel (a) shows the short-run effects of rent control: Because the supply and demand curves for 
apartments are relatively inelastic, the price ceiling imposed by a rent-control law causes only 
a small shortage of housing. Panel (b) shows the long-run effects of rent control: Because the 
supply and demand curves for apartments are more elastic, rent control causes a large shortage.

CHAPTER 6   SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
equilibrium levels. Whereas a price ceiling places a legal maximum on prices, a 
price floor places a legal minimum.
When the government imposes a price floor on the ice-cream market, two out-
comes are possible. If the government imposes a price floor of $2 per cone when 
the equilibrium price is $3, we obtain the outcome in panel (a) of Figure 4. In this 
case, because the equilibrium price is above the floor, the price floor is not bind-
ing. Market forces naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price 
floor has no effect.
Panel (b) of Figure 4 shows what happens when the government imposes a 
price floor of $4 per cone. In this case, because the equilibrium price of $3 is below 
the floor, the price floor is a binding constraint on the market. The forces of sup-
ply and demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium price, but when 
the market price hits the floor, it can fall no further. The market price equals the 
price floor. At this floor, the quantity of ice cream supplied (120 cones) exceeds the 
quantity demanded (80 cones). Because of this excess supply of 40 cones, some 
people who want to sell ice cream at the going price are unable to. Thus, a binding 
price floor causes a surplus. 
Just as the shortages resulting from price ceilings can lead to undesirable 
 rationing mechanisms, so can the surpluses resulting from price floors. The sellers 
who appeal to the personal biases of the buyers, perhaps due to racial or familial 
ties, may be better able to sell their goods than those who do not. By contrast, in 
a free market, the price serves as the rationing mechanism, and sellers can sell all 
they want at the equilibrium price.
In panel (a), the government imposes a price floor of $2. Because this is below the  
equilibrium price of $3, the price floor has no effect. The market price adjusts to balance  
supply and demand. At the equilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity demanded both  
equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a price floor of $4, which is above  
the equilibrium price of $3. Therefore, the market price equals $4. Because 120 cones  
are supplied at this price and only 80 are demanded, there is a surplus of 40 cones.

THE MINIMUM WAGE
An important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. Mini-
mum-wage laws dictate the lowest price for labor that any employer 
may pay. The U.S. Congress first instituted a minimum wage with 
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to ensure workers a minimally adequate 
standard of living. In 2015, the minimum wage according to federal law was $7.25 
per hour. (Some states mandate minimum wages above the federal level.) Many 
European nations have minimum-wage laws as well, sometimes  significantly 
higher than in the United States. For example, even though the  average income in 
France is almost 30 percent lower than it is in the United States, the French mini-
mum wage is more than 30 percent higher.
To examine the effects of a minimum wage, we must consider the market for 
 labor. Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows the labor market, which, like all markets, is sub-
ject to the forces of supply and demand. Workers determine the supply of labor, 
and firms determine the demand. If the government doesn’t intervene, the wage 
normally adjusts to balance labor supply and labor demand.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows the labor market with a minimum wage. If the 
 minimum wage is above the equilibrium level, as it is here, the quantity of labor 
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is unemployment. Thus, while 
the minimum wage raises the incomes of those workers who have jobs, it lowers 
the incomes of workers who cannot find jobs. 
To fully understand the minimum wage, keep in mind that the economy con-
tains not a single labor market but many labor markets for different types of work-
ers. The impact of the minimum wage depends on the skill and experience of the 
worker. Highly skilled and experienced workers are not affected because their 
equilibrium wages are well above the minimum. For these workers, the minimum 
wage is not binding.
Panel (a) shows a labor market in which the wage adjusts to balance labor supply and labor  
demand. Panel (b) shows the impact of a binding minimum wage. Because the minimum  
wage is a price floor, it causes a surplus: The quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity 
demanded. The result is unemployment.

CHAPTER 6   SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
The minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor. 
The equilibrium wages of teenagers are low because teenagers are among the 
least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force. In addition, teen-
agers are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on-the-job training. 
(Some teenagers, including many college students, are willing to work as interns 
for no pay at all. Because internships pay nothing, minimum-wage laws often do 
not  apply to them. If they did, these internship opportunities might not exist.) As 
a result, the minimum wage is binding more often for teenagers than for other 
members of the labor force.
Many economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage 
labor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage over 
time with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some debate 
about how much the minimum wage affects employment, the typical study finds 
that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment 
by 1 to 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 percent increase in 
the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers by 10 percent. 
A change in the law does not directly affect those teenagers who are already paid 
well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-wage laws is not perfect. 
Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is significant. 
In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage alters 
the quantity supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wage that  teenagers 
can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to look for jobs. Studies 
have found that a higher minimum wage influences which teenagers are employed. 
When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still  attending high school 
choose to drop out and take jobs. With more people vying for the available jobs, 
some of these new dropouts displace other teenagers who had already dropped out 
of school and now become unemployed. 
The minimum wage is a frequent topic of debate. Advo-
cates of the minimum wage view the policy as one way to 
raise the income of the working poor. They correctly point 
out that  workers who earn the minimum wage can afford 
only a meager standard of living. In 2015, for instance, when 
the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, two adults working 
40 hours a week for every week of the year at minimum-wage 
jobs had a total annual income of only $30,160. This amount 
was 24 percent above the official poverty line for a family 
of four but was less than half of the median family income 
in the United States. Many advocates of the minimum wage 
admit that it has some adverse effects, including unemploy-
ment, but they believe that these effects are small and that, 
all things considered, a higher minimum wage makes the 
poor better off.
Opponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the 
best way to combat poverty. They note that a high  minimum 
wage causes unemployment, encourages teenagers to drop 
out of school, and prevents some unskilled workers from get-
ting on-the-job training. Moreover, opponents of the  minimum 
wage point out that it is a poorly targeted policy. Not all 
minimum-wage workers are heads of households trying to 
help their families escape poverty. In fact, less than a third of 
minimum-wage earners are in families with incomes below the 
“If the federal minimum wage is raised gradually to $15-per-hour 
by 2020, the employment rate for low-wage U.S. workers will be 
substantially lower than it would be under the status quo.”

6-1c Evaluating Price Controls
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets 
are usually a good way to organize economic activity. This principle explains 
why economists usually oppose price ceilings and price floors. To economists, 
prices are not the outcome of some haphazard process. Prices, they contend, 
are the  result of the millions of business and consumer decisions that lie behind  
the supply and demand curves. Prices have the crucial job of balancing supply 
and  demand and, thereby, coordinating economic activity. When policymakers set 
prices by legal decree, they obscure the signals that normally guide the allocation 
of society’s resources.
Another one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. Indeed, policymakers are motivated to control 
prices because they view the market’s outcome as unfair. Price controls are  often 
aimed at helping the poor. For instance, rent-control laws try to make housing 
affordable for everyone, and minimum-wage laws try to help people escape 
poverty.
Yet price controls often hurt those they are trying to help. Rent control may 
keep rents low, but it also discourages landlords from maintaining their buildings 
and makes housing hard to find. Minimum-wage laws may raise the incomes of 
some workers, but they also cause other workers to become unemployed. 
Helping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling 
prices. For instance, the government can make housing more affordable by paying 
a fraction of the rent for poor families. Unlike rent control, such rent subsidies do 
not reduce the quantity of housing supplied and, therefore, do not lead to hous-
ing shortages. Similarly, wage subsidies raise the living standards of the working 
poor without discouraging firms from hiring them. An example of a wage sub-
sidy is the earned income tax credit, a government program that supplements the 
incomes of low-wage workers.
Although these alternative policies are often better than price controls, they are 
not perfect. Rent and wage subsidies cost the government money and, therefore, 
require higher taxes. As we see in the next section, taxation has costs of its own.

Define price ceiling and price floor and give an example of each. Which

All governments—from national governments around the world to local 
 governments in small towns—use taxes to raise revenue for public projects, such 
as roads, schools, and national defense. Because taxes are such an important 
 policy instrument and affect our lives in many ways, we return to the study of 
taxes several times throughout this book. In this section, we begin our study of 
how taxes affect the economy.
To set the stage for our analysis, imagine that a local government decides to 
hold an annual ice-cream celebration—with a parade, fireworks, and speeches by 
town officials. To raise revenue to pay for the event, the town decides to place a 
$0.50 tax on the sale of ice-cream cones. When the plan is announced, our two

CHAPTER 6   SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
lobbying groups swing into action. The American Association of Ice-Cream Eaters 
claims that consumers of ice cream are having trouble making ends meet, and it 
argues that sellers of ice cream should pay the tax. The National Organization of 
Ice-Cream Makers claims that its members are struggling to survive in a compet-
itive market, and it argues that buyers of ice cream should pay the tax. The town 
mayor, hoping to reach a compromise, suggests that half the tax be paid by the 
buyers and half be paid by the sellers.
To analyze these proposals, we need to address a simple but subtle question: 
When the government levies a tax on a good, who actually bears the burden of the 
tax? The people buying the good? The people selling the good? Or if buyers and 
sellers share the tax burden, what determines how the burden is divided? Can the 
government simply legislate the division of the burden, as the mayor is suggest-
ing, or is the division determined by more fundamental market forces? The term 
tax incidence refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed among the various 
people who make up the economy. As we will see, some surprising lessons about 
tax incidence can be learned by applying the tools of supply and demand. 
6-2a How Taxes on Sellers Affect Market Outcomes
We begin by considering a tax levied on sellers of a good. Suppose the local 
 government passes a law requiring sellers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the 
government for every cone they sell. How does this law affect the buyers and 
 sellers of ice cream? To answer this question, we can follow the three steps in 
Chapter 4 for analyzing supply and demand: (1) We decide whether the law 
 affects the supply curve or the demand curve. (2) We decide which way the curve 
shifts. (3) We examine how the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.
Step One  The immediate impact of the tax is on the sellers of ice cream. Because 
the tax is not levied on buyers, the quantity of ice cream demanded at any given 
price is the same; thus, the demand curve does not change. By contrast, the tax on 
sellers makes the ice-cream business less profitable at any given price, so it shifts 
the supply curve.
Step Two  Because the tax on sellers raises the cost of producing and selling ice 
cream, it reduces the quantity supplied at every price. The supply curve shifts to 
the left (or, equivalently, upward).
In addition to determining the direction in which the supply curve moves, we 
can also be precise about the size of the shift. For any market price of ice cream, 
the effective price to sellers—the amount they get to keep after paying the tax—is 
$0.50 lower. For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the 
effective price received by sellers would be $1.50. Whatever the market price, 
sellers will supply a quantity of ice cream as if the price were $0.50 lower than it 
is. Put differently, to induce sellers to supply any given quantity, the market price 
must now be $0.50 higher to compensate for the effect of the tax. Thus, as shown 
in Figure 6, the supply curve shifts upward from S1 to S2 by the exact size of the 
tax ($0.50).
Step Three  Having determined how the supply curve shifts, we can now com-
pare the initial and the new equilibriums. Figure 6 shows that the equilibrium 
price of ice cream rises from $3.00 to $3.30, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 
100 to 90 cones. Because sellers sell less and buyers buy less in the new equilib-
rium, the tax reduces the size of the ice-cream market.

122
PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
Implications  We can now return to the question of tax incidence: Who pays the 
tax? Although sellers send the entire tax to the government, buyers and sellers 
share the burden. Because the market price rises from $3.00 to $3.30 when the tax 
is introduced, buyers pay $0.30 more for each ice-cream cone than they did with-
out the tax. Thus, the tax makes buyers worse off. Sellers get a higher price ($3.30) 
from buyers than they did previously, but what they get to keep after paying the 
tax is only $2.80 ($3.30 2 $0.50 5 $2.80), compared with $3.00 before the tax. Thus, 
the tax also makes sellers worse off.
To sum up, this analysis yields two lessons:
r Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the 
good sold is smaller in the new equilibrium.
r Buyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers 
pay more for the good, and sellers receive less.
6-2b How Taxes on Buyers Affect Market Outcomes
Now consider a tax levied on buyers of a good. Suppose that our local govern-
ment passes a law requiring buyers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the gov-
ernment for each ice-cream cone they buy. What are the effects of this law? Again, 
we apply our three steps.
Step One  The initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream. The sup-
ply curve is not affected because, for any given price of ice cream, sellers have the 
same incentive to provide ice cream to the market. By contrast, buyers now have 
to pay a tax to the government (as well as the price to the sellers) whenever they 
buy ice cream. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for ice cream. 
Step Two  Next, we determine the direction of the shift. Because the tax on buy-
ers makes buying ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity of 
FIGURE 6
A Tax on Sellers
When a tax of $0.50 is levied on 
sellers, the supply curve shifts up by 
$0.50 from S1 to S2. The equilibrium 
quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. 
The price that buyers pay rises from 
$3.00 to $3.30. The price that sellers 
receive (after paying the tax) falls from 
$3.00 to $2.80. Even though the tax 
is levied on sellers, buyers and sellers 
share the burden of the tax.

CHAPTER 6   SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
ice cream at every price. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, equiv-
alently, downward), as shown in Figure 7.
Once again, we can be precise about the size of the shift. Because of the $0.50 
tax levied on buyers, the effective price to buyers is now $0.50 higher than the 
market price (whatever the market price happens to be). For example, if the mar-
ket price of a cone happened to be $2.00, the effective price to buyers would be 
$2.50. Because buyers look at their total cost including the tax, they demand a 
quantity of ice cream as if the market price were $0.50 higher than it actually is. 
In other words, to induce buyers to demand any given quantity, the market price 
must now be $0.50 lower to make up for the effect of the tax. Thus, the tax shifts 
the demand curve downward from D1 to D2 by the exact size of the tax ($0.50). 
Step Three  Having determined how the demand curve shifts, we can now see 
the effect of the tax by comparing the initial equilibrium and the new equilibrium. 
You can see in Figure 7 that the equilibrium price of ice cream falls from $3.00 to 
$2.80, and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. Once again, the tax 
on ice cream reduces the size of the ice-cream market. And once again, buyers and 
sellers share the burden of the tax. Sellers get a lower price for their product; buy-
ers pay a lower market price to sellers than they did previously, but the effective 
price (including the tax buyers have to pay) rises from $3.00 to $3.30.
Implications  If you compare Figures 6 and 7, you will notice a surprising conclu-
sion: Taxes levied on sellers and taxes levied on buyers are equivalent. In both cases, the tax 
places a wedge between the price that buyers pay and the price that sellers receive. 
The wedge between the buyers’ price and the sellers’ price is the same, regardless 
of whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers. In either case, the wedge shifts the 
relative position of the supply and demand curves. In the new equilibrium, buyers 
and sellers share the burden of the tax. The only difference between a tax levied on 
sellers and a tax levied on buyers is who sends the money to the government.

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
The equivalence of these two taxes is easy to understand if we imagine that the 
government collects the $0.50 ice-cream tax in a bowl on the counter of each ice-
cream store. When the government levies the tax on sellers, the seller is required 
to place $0.50 in the bowl after the sale of each cone. When the government levies 
the tax on buyers, the buyer is required to place $0.50 in the bowl every time a 
cone is bought. Whether the $0.50 goes directly from the buyer’s pocket into the 
bowl, or indirectly from the buyer’s pocket into the seller’s hand and then into the 
bowl, does not matter. Once the market reaches its new equilibrium, buyers and 
sellers share the burden, regardless of how the tax is levied.
CASE 
STUDY
CAN CONGRESS DISTRIBUTE THE BURDEN OF A PAYROLL TAX?
If you have ever received a paycheck, you probably noticed that 
taxes were deducted from the amount you earned. One of these 
taxes is called FICA, an acronym for the Federal Insurance Contri-
butions Act. The federal government uses the revenue from the FICA tax to pay 
for Social Security and Medicare, the income support and healthcare programs for 
the elderly. FICA is an example of a payroll tax, which is a tax on the wages that 
firms pay their workers. In 2015, the total FICA tax for the typical worker was 15.3 
percent of earnings. 
Who do you think bears the burden of this payroll tax—firms or workers? When 
Congress passed this legislation, it tried to mandate a division of the tax burden. 
According to the law, half of the tax is paid by firms, and half is paid by workers. 
That is, half of the tax is paid out of firms’ revenues, and half is deducted from 
workers’ paychecks. The amount that shows up as a deduction on your pay stub is 
the worker contribution.
Our analysis of tax incidence, however, shows that lawmakers cannot dictate the 
distribution of a tax burden so easily. To illustrate, we can analyze a payroll tax as 
merely a tax on a good, where the good is labor and the price is the wage. The key 
feature of the payroll tax is that it places a wedge between the wage that firms pay 
and the wage that workers receive. Figure 8 shows the outcome. When a payroll tax 
is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and the wage paid by firms rises. 
In the end, workers and firms share the burden of the tax, much as the legislation 
requires. Yet this division of the tax burden between workers and firms has nothing 
to do with the legislated division: The division of the burden in Figure 8 is not nec-
essarily fifty-fifty, and the same outcome would prevail if the law levied the entire 
tax on workers or if it levied the entire tax on firms.
This example shows that the most basic lesson of tax incidence is often over-
looked in public debate. Lawmakers can decide whether a tax comes from the buy-
er’s pocket or from the seller’s, but they cannot legislate the true burden of a tax. 
Rather, tax incidence depends on the forces of supply and demand. ●
6-2c Elasticity and Tax Incidence
When a good is taxed, buyers and sellers of the good share the burden of the tax. 
But how exactly is the tax burden divided? Only rarely will it be shared equally. To 
see how the burden is divided, consider the impact of taxation in the two markets 
in Figure 9. In both cases, the figure shows the initial demand curve, the initial 
supply curve, and a tax that drives a wedge between the amount paid by buyers 
and the amount received by sellers. (Not drawn in either panel of the figure is the 
new supply or demand curve. Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax is 
levied on buyers or sellers. As we have seen, this is irrelevant for determining the

CHAPTER 6   SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES
incidence of the tax.) The difference in the two panels is the relative elasticity of 
supply and demand. 
Panel (a) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with very elastic supply and rela-
tively inelastic demand. That is, sellers are very responsive to changes in the price 
of the good (so the supply curve is relatively flat), whereas buyers are not very 
responsive (so the demand curve is relatively steep). When a tax is imposed on a 
market with these elasticities, the price received by sellers does not fall by much, 
so sellers bear only a small burden. By contrast, the price paid by buyers rises sub-
stantially, indicating that buyers bear most of the burden of the tax.
Panel (b) of Figure 9 shows a tax in a market with relatively inelastic supply 
and very elastic demand. In this case, sellers are not very responsive to changes 
in the price (so the supply curve is steeper), whereas buyers are very responsive 
(so the demand curve is flatter). The figure shows that when a tax is imposed, the 
price paid by buyers does not rise by much, but the price received by sellers falls 
substantially. Thus, sellers bear most of the burden of the tax.
The two panels of Figure 9 show a general lesson about how the burden of a 
tax is divided: A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elas-
tic. Why is this true? In essence, the elasticity measures the willingness of buyers 
or sellers to leave the market when conditions become unfavorable. A small elas-
ticity of demand means that buyers do not have good alternatives to consuming 
this particular good. A small elasticity of supply means that sellers do not have 
good alternatives to producing this particular good. When the good is taxed, the 
side of the market with fewer good alternatives is less willing to leave the market 
and, therefore, bears more of the burden of the tax.
We can apply this logic to the payroll tax discussed in the previous case study. 
Most labor economists believe that the supply of labor is much less elastic than 
the demand. This means that workers, rather than firms, bear most of the burden 
of the payroll tax. In other words, the distribution of the tax burden is far from the 
fifty-fifty split that lawmakers intended.

WHO PAYS THE LUXURY TAX?
In 1990, Congress adopted a new luxury tax on items such as yachts, 
private airplanes, furs, jewelry, and expensive cars. The goal of the 
tax was to raise revenue from those who could most easily  afford to 
pay. Because only the rich could afford to buy such extravagances, taxing luxuries 
seemed a logical way of taxing the rich.
Yet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was quite 
different from the one Congress intended. Consider, for example, the market for 
yachts. The demand for yachts is quite elastic. A millionaire can easily not buy a

yacht; he can use the money to buy a bigger house, take a European vacation, or 
leave a larger bequest to his heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts is relatively 
inelastic, at least in the short run. Yacht factories are not easily converted to alterna-
tive uses, and workers who build yachts are not eager to change careers in response 
to changing market conditions. 
Our analysis makes a clear prediction in this case. With elastic demand and  
inelastic supply, the burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers. That is, a tax on 
yachts places a burden largely on the firms and workers who build yachts because 
they end up getting a significantly lower price for their product. The workers, how-
ever, are not wealthy. Thus, the burden of a luxury tax falls more on the middle 
class than on the rich.
The mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax quickly became 
apparent after the tax went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries made their congres-
sional representatives well aware of the economic hardship they experienced, and 
Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993. ●

6-3 Conclusion
The economy is governed by two kinds of laws: the laws of supply and demand 
and the laws enacted by governments. In this chapter, we have begun to see how 
these laws interact. Price controls and taxes are common in various markets in the 
economy, and their effects are frequently debated in the press and among policy-
makers. Even a little bit of economic knowledge can go a long way toward under-
standing and evaluating these policies.
In subsequent chapters, we analyze many government policies in greater  
detail. We examine the effects of taxation more fully and consider a broader range 
of policies than we considered here. Yet the basic lessons of this chapter will not 
change: When analyzing government policies, supply and demand are the first 
and most useful tools of analysis.

SUMMARY
r A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price of a 
good or service. An example is rent control. If the price 
ceiling is below the equilibrium price, then the price 
ceiling is binding, and the quantity demanded exceeds 
the quantity supplied. Because of the resulting short-
age, sellers must in some way ration the good or ser-
vice among buyers.
r A price floor is a legal minimum on the price of a 
good or service. An example is the minimum wage. 
If the price floor is above the equilibrium price, then 
the price floor is binding, and the quantity supplied  
exceeds the quantity demanded. Because of the result-
ing surplus, buyers’ demands for the good or service 
must in some way be rationed among sellers.
r When the government levies a tax on a good, the equi-
librium quantity of the good falls. That is, a tax on a 
market shrinks the size of the market.
r A tax on a good places a wedge between the price paid 
by buyers and the price received by sellers. When the 
market moves to the new equilibrium, buyers pay 
more for the good and sellers receive less for it. In this 
sense, buyers and sellers share the tax burden. The  
incidence of a tax (that is, the division of the tax bur-
den) does not depend on whether the tax is levied on 
buyers or sellers.
r The incidence of a tax depends on the price elasticities 
of supply and demand. Most of the burden falls on the 
side of the market that is less elastic because that side 
of the market cannot respond as easily to the tax by 
changing the quantity bought or sold.

QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
1. Give an example of a price ceiling and an example of 
a price floor.
2. Which causes a shortage of a good—a price ceiling or 
a price floor? Justify your answer with a graph.
3. What mechanisms allocate resources when the price 
of a good is not allowed to bring supply and demand 
into equilibrium? 
4. Explain why economists usually oppose controls on 
prices.
5. Suppose the government removes a tax on buyers of a 
good and levies a tax of the same size on sellers of the 
good. How does this change in tax policy affect the price 
that buyers pay sellers for this good, the amount buy-
ers are out of pocket (including any tax payments they

make), the amount sellers receive (net of any tax pay-
ments they make), and the quantity of the good sold?
6. How does a tax on a good affect the price paid by buy-
ers, the price received by sellers, and the quantity sold?
7. What determines how the burden of a tax is divided 
between buyers and sellers? Why?
PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS
1. Lovers of classical music persuade Congress to impose 
a price ceiling of $40 per concert ticket. As a result of 
this policy, do more or fewer people attend classical 
music concerts? Explain.
2. The government has decided that the free-market 
price of cheese is too low.
a. Suppose the government imposes a binding price 
floor in the cheese market. Draw a supply-and- 
demand diagram to show the effect of this policy 
on the price of cheese and the quantity of cheese 
sold. Is there a shortage or surplus of cheese?
b. Producers of cheese complain that the price floor 
has reduced their total revenue. Is this possible? 
Explain.
c. In response to cheese producers’ complaints, the 
government agrees to purchase all the surplus 
cheese at the price floor. Compared to the basic 
price floor, who benefits from this new policy? 
Who loses?
3. A recent study found that the demand-and-supply 
schedules for Frisbees are as follows:

a. What are the equilibrium price and quantity of 
Frisbees?
b. Frisbee manufacturers persuade the government 
that Frisbee production improves scientists’ un-
derstanding of aerodynamics and thus is import-
ant for national security. A concerned Congress 
votes to impose a price floor $2 above the equilib-
rium price. What is the new market price? How 
many Frisbees are sold?
c. Irate college students march on Washington and 
demand a reduction in the price of Frisbees. An 
even more concerned Congress votes to repeal the 
price floor and impose a price ceiling $1 below the 
former price floor. What is the new market price? 
How many Frisbees are sold?
4. Suppose the federal government requires beer drink-
ers to pay a $2 tax on each case of beer purchased. (In 
fact, both the federal and state governments impose 
beer taxes of some sort.) 
a. Draw a supply-and-demand diagram of the mar-
ket for beer without the tax. Show the price paid 
by consumers, the price received by producers, 
and the quantity of beer sold. What is the differ-
ence between the price paid by consumers and the 
price received by producers?
b. Now draw a supply-and-demand diagram for the 
beer market with the tax. Show the price paid by 
consumers, the price received by producers, and 
the quantity of beer sold. What is the difference 
between the price paid by consumers and the 
price received by producers? Has the quantity of 
beer sold increased or decreased?
5. A senator wants to raise tax revenue and make work-
ers better off. A staff member proposes raising the 
payroll tax paid by firms and using part of the extra 
revenue to reduce the payroll tax paid by workers. 
Would this accomplish the senator’s goal? Explain.
6. If the government places a $500 tax on luxury cars, 
will the price paid by consumers rise by more than 
$500, less than $500, or exactly $500? Explain.
7. Congress and the president decide that the United 
States should reduce air pollution by reducing its use 
of gasoline. They impose a $0.50 tax on each gallon of 
gasoline sold.
a. Should they impose this tax on producers  
or  consumers? Explain carefully using a  
supply-and-demand diagram.
b. If the demand for gasoline were more elastic, 
would this tax be more effective or less effective 
in reducing the quantity of gasoline consumed? 
Explain with both words and a diagram.
c. Are consumers of gasoline helped or hurt by this 
tax? Why?
d. Are workers in the oil industry helped or hurt by 
this tax? Why?

PART II   HOW MARKETS WORK
8. A case study in this chapter discusses the federal  
minimum-wage law. 
a. Suppose the minimum wage is above the equi-
librium wage in the market for unskilled labor. 
Using a supply-and-demand diagram of the mar-
ket for unskilled labor, show the market wage, 
the number of workers who are employed, and 
the number of workers who are unemployed. 
Also show the total wage payments to unskilled 
workers.
b. Now suppose the secretary of labor proposes an 
increase in the minimum wage. What effect would 
this increase have on employment? Does the 
change in employment depend on the elasticity of 
demand, the elasticity of supply, both elasticities, 
or neither?
c. What effect would this increase in the minimum 
wage have on unemployment? Does the change  
in unemployment depend on the elasticity of  
demand, the elasticity of supply, both elasticities, 
or neither?
d. If the demand for unskilled labor were inelastic, 
would the proposed increase in the minimum 
wage raise or lower total wage payments to 
 unskilled workers? Would your answer change if 
the demand for unskilled labor were elastic?
9. At Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox,  
seating is limited to about 38,000. Hence, the number 
of tickets issued is fixed at that figure. Seeing a golden 
opportunity to raise revenue, the City of Boston levies 
a per ticket tax of $5 to be paid by the ticket buyer. 
Boston sports fans, a famously civic-minded lot, 
dutifully send in the $5 per ticket. Draw a well-labeled 
graph showing the impact of the tax. On whom does 
the tax burden fall—the team’s owners, the fans, or 
both? Why?
10. A market is described by the following supply and  
demand curves:
 
QS 5 2P
QD 5 300 2 P
a. Solve for the equilibrium price and quantity.
b. If the government imposes a price ceiling of $90, 
does a shortage or surplus (or neither) develop? 
What are the price, quantity supplied, quantity 
demanded, and size of the shortage or surplus?
c. If the government imposes a price floor of $90, 
does a shortage or surplus (or neither) develop? 
What are the price, quantity supplied, quantity 
demanded, and size of the shortage or surplus?
d. Instead of a price control, the government levies  
a tax on producers of $30. As a result, the new 
supply curve is: 
QS 5 2(P − 30).
Does a shortage or surplus (or neither) develop? 
What are the price, quantity supplied, quantity de-
manded, and size of the shortage or surplus?

CHAPTER
7
Consumers, Producers, and 
the Efficiency of Markets
W
hen consumers go to grocery stores to buy food for Thanksgiving dinner, 
they may be disappointed see the high price of turkey. At the same time, 
when farmers bring to market the turkeys they have raised, they probably 
wish that the price of turkey were even higher. These views are not surprising: 
Buyers always want to pay less, and sellers always want to be paid more. But is 
there a “right price” for turkey from the standpoint of society as a whole?
In previous chapters, we saw how, in market economies, the forces of supply 
and demand determine the prices of goods and services and the quantities sold.

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
So far, however, we have described the way markets allocate scarce resources 
without directly addressing the question of whether these market allocations are 
desirable. In other words, our analysis has been positive (what is) rather than nor-
mative (what should be). We know that the price of turkey adjusts to ensure that 
the quantity of turkey supplied equals the quantity of turkey demanded. But at 
this equilibrium, is the quantity of turkey produced and consumed too small, too 
large, or just right?
In this chapter, we take up the topic of welfare economics, the study of how 
the allocation of resources affects economic well-being. We begin by examining 
the benefits that buyers and sellers receive from engaging in market transactions. 
We then examine how society can make these benefits as large as possible. This 
analysis leads to a profound conclusion: In any market, the equilibrium of sup-
ply and demand maximizes the total benefits received by all buyers and sellers 
combined.
As you may recall from Chapter 1, one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that 
markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. The study of wel-
fare economics explains this principle more fully. It also answers our question 
about the right price of turkey: The price that balances the supply and demand for 
turkey is, in a particular sense, the best one because it maximizes the total welfare 
of turkey consumers and turkey producers. No consumer or producer of turkeys 
aims to achieve this goal, but their joint action directed by market prices moves 
them toward a welfare-maximizing outcome, as if led by an invisible hand.

7-1 Consumer Surplus
We begin our study of welfare economics by looking at the benefits buyers receive 
from participating in a market. 
7-1a Willingness to Pay 
Imagine that you own a mint-condition recording of Elvis Presley’s first album. 
Because you are not an Elvis Presley fan, you decide to sell it. One way to do so is 
to hold an auction.
Four Elvis fans show up for your auction: Taylor, Carrie, Rihanna, and Gaga. 
They would all like to own the album, but each of them has a limit on the amount 
she is willing to pay for it. Table 1 shows the maximum price that each of the 
four possible buyers would pay. A buyer’s maximum is called her willingness to 
pay, and it measures how much that buyer values the good. Each buyer would be 
eager to buy the album at a price less than her willingness to pay, and she would 
refuse to buy the album at a price greater than her willingness to pay. At a price

the maximum amount 
that a buyer will pay for 
a good

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
equal to her willingness to pay, the buyer would be indifferent about buying the 
good: If the price is exactly the same as the value she places on the album, she 
would be equally happy buying it or keeping her money.
To sell your album, you begin the bidding process at a low price, say, $10. 
Because all four buyers are willing to pay much more, the price rises quickly. 
The bidding stops when Taylor bids $80 (or slightly more). At this point, Carrie,  
Rihanna, and Gaga have all dropped out of the bidding because they are unwill-
ing to bid any more than $80. Taylor pays you $80 and gets the album. Note that 
the album has gone to the buyer who values it most highly.
What benefit does Taylor receive from buying the Elvis Presley album? In a 
sense, Taylor has found a real bargain: She is willing to pay $100 for the album 
but pays only $80. We say that Taylor receives consumer surplus of $20. Consumer 
surplus is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the 
buyer actually pays for it.
Consumer surplus measures the benefit buyers receive from participating in 
a market. In this example, Taylor receives a $20 benefit from participating in the 
auction because she pays only $80 for a good she values at $100. Carrie, Rihanna, 
and Gaga get no consumer surplus from participating in the auction because they 
left without the album and without paying anything.
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you had two iden-
tical Elvis Presley albums to sell. Again, you auction them off to the four possible 
buyers. To keep things simple, we assume that both albums are to be sold for the 
same price and that no one is interested in buying more than one album. There-
fore, the price rises until two buyers are left.
In this case, the bidding stops when Taylor and Carrie bid $70 (or slightly 
higher). At this price, Taylor and Carrie are each happy to buy an album, and 
Rihanna and Gaga are not willing to bid any higher. Taylor and Carrie each  
receive consumer surplus equal to her willingness to pay minus the price.  Taylor’s 
consumer surplus is $30, and Carrie’s is $10. Taylor’s consumer surplus is higher 
now than in the previous example because she gets the same album but pays less 
for it. The total consumer surplus in the market is $40.
7-1b Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve for a product. To see 
how they are related, let’s continue our example and consider the demand curve 
for this rare Elvis Presley album. 
We begin by using the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers to find the 
market demand schedule for the album. The table in Figure 1 shows the  demand 
schedule that corresponds to Table 1. If the price is above $100, the quantity 
 demanded in the market is 0 because no buyer is willing to pay that much. If the 
price is between $80 and $100, the quantity demanded is 1 because only Taylor is 
willing to pay such a high price. If the price is between $70 and $80, the quantity 
demanded is 2 because both Taylor and Carrie are willing to pay the price. We can 
continue this analysis for other prices as well. In this way, the demand schedule is 
derived from the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers.
The graph in Figure 1 shows the demand curve that corresponds to this 
 demand schedule. Note the relationship between the height of the demand 
curve and the buyers’ willingness to pay. At any quantity, the price given by 
the demand curve shows the willingness to pay of the marginal buyer, the buyer 
who would leave the market first if the price were any higher. At a quantity of  
4 albums, for instance, the demand curve has a height of $50, the price that Gaga

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
(the marginal buyer) is willing to pay for an album. At a quantity of 3 albums, 
the demand curve has a height of $70, the price that Rihanna (who is now the 
marginal buyer) is willing to pay.
Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, we can also 
use it to measure consumer surplus. Figure 2 uses the demand curve to compute 
consumer surplus in our two examples. In panel (a), the price is $80 (or slightly 
above) and the quantity demanded is 1. Note that the area above the price and 
below the demand curve equals $20. This amount is exactly the consumer surplus 
we computed earlier when only 1 album is sold.
Panel (b) of Figure 2 shows consumer surplus when the price is $70 (or slightly 
above). In this case, the area above the price and below the demand curve equals 
the total area of the two rectangles: Taylor’s consumer surplus at this price is $30 
and Carrie’s is $10. This area equals a total of $40. Once again, this amount is the 
consumer surplus we computed earlier.
The lesson from this example holds for all demand curves: The area below the 
demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. This is 
true because the height of the demand curve represents the value buyers place on 
the good, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The difference between 
this willingness to pay and the market price is each buyer’s consumer surplus. 
Thus, the total area below the demand curve and above the price is the sum of the 
consumer surplus of all buyers in the market for a good or service.
7-1c How a Lower Price Raises Consumer Surplus 
Because buyers always want to pay less for the goods they buy, a lower price 
makes buyers of a good better off. But how much does buyers’ well-being rise in 
response to a lower price? We can use the concept of consumer surplus to answer 
this question precisely.

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
Figure 3 shows a typical demand curve. You may notice that this curve grad-
ually slopes downward instead of taking discrete steps as in the previous two 
 figures. In a market with many buyers, the resulting steps from each buyer drop-
ping out are so small that they form a smooth curve. Although this curve has a 
different shape, the ideas we have just developed still apply: Consumer surplus 
is the area above the price and below the demand curve. In panel (a), consumer 
surplus at a price of P1 is the area of triangle ABC.
Now suppose that the price falls from P1 to P2, as shown in panel (b). The con-
sumer surplus now equals area ADF. The increase in consumer surplus attribut-
able to the lower price is the area BCFD.
This increase in consumer surplus is composed of two parts. First, those buy-
ers who were already buying Q1 of the good at the higher price P1 are better off 
because now they pay less. The increase in consumer surplus of existing buy-
ers is the reduction in the amount they pay; it equals the area of the rectangle 
BCED. Second, some new buyers enter the market because they are willing to 
buy the good at the lower price. As a result, the quantity demanded in the market  
increases from Q1 to Q2. The consumer surplus these newcomers receive is the 
area of the triangle CEF.
7-1d What Does Consumer Surplus Measure?
Our goal in developing the concept of consumer surplus is to make judgments 
about the desirability of market outcomes. Now that you have seen what con-
sumer surplus is, let’s consider whether it is a good measure of economic 
well-being. 
Imagine that you are a policymaker trying to design a good economic 
system. Would you care about the amount of consumer surplus? Consumer

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
surplus, the amount that buyers are willing to pay for a good minus the 
amount they actually pay for it, measures the benefit that buyers receive from 
a good as the buyers themselves perceive it. Thus, consumer surplus is a good 
measure of economic well- being if policymakers want to satisfy the prefer-
ences of buyers.
In some circumstances, policymakers might choose to disregard consumer sur-
plus because they do not respect the preferences that drive buyer behavior. For 
example, drug addicts are willing to pay a high price for heroin. Yet we would not 
say that addicts get a large benefit from being able to buy heroin at a low price 
(even though addicts might say they do). From the standpoint of society, will-
ingness to pay in this instance is not a good measure of the buyers’ benefit, and 
consumer surplus is not a good measure of economic well-being, because addicts 
are not looking after their own best interests.
In most markets, however, consumer surplus does reflect economic well-
being. Economists normally assume that buyers are rational when they make 
decisions. Rational people do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given their 
opportunities. Economists also normally assume that people’s preferences should 
be respected. In this case, consumers are the best judges of how much benefit they 
receive from the goods they buy.

rises from Q1 to Q2 and the consumer surplus rises to the area of the triangle ADF. The increase 
in consumer surplus (area BCFD) occurs in part because existing consumers now pay less (area 
BCED) and in part because new consumers enter the market at the lower price (area CEF).

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
7-2 Producer Surplus
We now turn to the other side of the market and consider the benefits sellers 
receive from participating in a market. As you will see, our analysis of sellers’ 
welfare is similar to our analysis of buyers’ welfare.
7-2a Cost and the Willingness to Sell
Imagine now that you are a homeowner and want to get your house painted. You 
turn to four sellers of painting services: Vincent, Claude, Pablo, and Andy. Each 
painter is willing to do the work for you if the price is right. You decide to take 
bids from the four painters and auction off the job to the painter who will do the 
work for the lowest price.
Each painter is willing to take the job if the price he would receive exceeds his 
cost of doing the work. Here the term cost should be interpreted as the paint-
ers’ opportunity cost: It includes the painters’ out-of-pocket expenses (for paint, 
brushes, and so on) as well as the value that the painters place on their own time. 
Table 2 shows each painter’s cost. Because a painter’s cost is the lowest price he 
would accept for his work, cost is a measure of his willingness to sell his services. 
Each painter would be eager to sell his services at a price greater than his cost 
and would refuse to sell his services at a price less than his cost. At a price exactly 
equal to his cost, he would be indifferent about selling his services: He would be 
equally happy getting the job or using his time and energy for another purpose.
When you take bids from the painters, the price might start high, but it quickly 
falls as the painters compete for the job. Once Andy has bid $600 (or slightly less), he 
is the sole remaining bidder. Andy is happy to do the job for this price because his 
cost is only $500. Vincent, Claude, and Pablo are unwilling to do the job for less than 
$600. Note that the job goes to the painter who can do the work at the lowest cost.
What benefit does Andy receive from getting the job? Because he is willing to 
do the work for $500 but gets $600 for doing it, we say that he receives producer 
surplus of $100. Producer surplus is the amount a seller is paid minus the cost of 
production. Producer surplus measures the benefit sellers receive from participat-
ing in a market. 
Now consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you have two 
houses that need painting. Again, you auction off the jobs to the four painters. To 
keep things simple, let’s assume that no painter is able to paint both houses and 
that you will pay the same amount to paint each house. Therefore, the price falls 
until two painters are left.
In this case, the bidding stops when Andy and Pablo each offer to do the job for 
a price of $800 (or slightly less). Andy and Pablo are willing to do the work at this 
price, while Vincent and Claude are not willing to bid a lower price. At a price of

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
$800, Andy receives producer surplus of $300 and Pablo receives producer sur-
plus of $200. The total producer surplus in the market is $500.
7-2b Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus
Just as consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve, producer surplus 
is closely related to the supply curve. To see how, let’s continue with our example. 
We begin by using the costs of the four painters to find the supply sched-
ule for painting services. The table in Figure 4 shows the supply schedule that 
corresponds to the costs in Table 2. If the price is below $500, none of the four 
painters is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied is zero. If the price is 
between $500 and $600, only Andy is willing to do the job, so the quantity sup-
plied is 1. If the price is between $600 and $800, Andy and Pablo are willing to 
do the job, so the quantity supplied is 2, and so on. Thus, the supply schedule is 
derived from the costs of the four painters.
The graph in Figure 4 shows the supply curve that corresponds to this supply 
schedule. Note that the height of the supply curve is related to the sellers’ costs. 
At any quantity, the price given by the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal 
seller, the seller who would leave the market first if the price were any lower. At 
a quantity of 4 houses, for instance, the supply curve has a height of $900, the 
cost that Vincent (the marginal seller) incurs to provide his painting services. At 
a quantity of 3 houses, the supply curve has a height of $800, the cost that Claude 
(who is now the marginal seller) incurs.
Because the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, we can use it to measure pro-
ducer surplus. Figure 5 uses the supply curve to compute producer surplus in our 
two examples. In panel (a), we assume that the price is $600 (or slightly less). In 
this case, the quantity supplied is 1. Note that the area below the price and above

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
the supply curve equals $100. This amount is exactly the producer surplus we 
computed earlier for Andy.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows producer surplus at a price of $800 (or slightly less). 
In this case, the area below the price and above the supply curve equals the total 
area of the two rectangles. This area equals $500, the producer surplus we com-
puted earlier for Pablo and Andy when two houses needed painting.
The lesson from this example applies to all supply curves: The area below the 
price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. The logic 
is straightforward: The height of the supply curve measures sellers’ costs, and the 
difference between the price and the cost of production is each seller’s producer 
surplus. Thus, the total area is the sum of the producer surplus of all sellers.
7-2c How a Higher Price Raises Producer Surplus 
You will not be surprised to hear that sellers always want to receive a higher 
price for the goods they sell. But how much does sellers’ well-being rise in 
response to a higher price? The concept of producer surplus offers a precise 
answer to this question.
Figure 6 shows a typical upward-sloping supply curve that would arise in a 
market with many sellers. Although this supply curve differs in shape from the 
previous figure, we measure producer surplus in the same way: Producer surplus 
is the area below the price and above the supply curve. In panel (a), the price is P1
and producer surplus is the area of triangle ABC.

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
Panel (b) shows what happens when the price rises from P1 to P2. Producer sur-
plus now equals area ADF. This increase in producer surplus has two parts. First, 
those sellers who were already selling Q1 of the good at the lower price P1 are 
better off because they now get more for what they sell. The increase in producer 
surplus for existing sellers equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Second, some 
new sellers enter the market because they are willing to produce the good at the 
higher price, resulting in an increase in the quantity supplied from Q1 to Q2. The 
producer surplus of these newcomers is the area of the triangle CEF.
As this analysis shows, we use producer surplus to measure the well-being of 
sellers in much the same way as we use consumer surplus to measure the well- 
being of buyers. Because these two measures of economic welfare are so similar, it is 
natural to use them together. Indeed, that is exactly what we do in the next section.

existing producers now receive more (area BCED) and in part because new producers  
enter the market at the higher price (area CEF).
7-3 Market Efficiency
Consumer surplus and producer surplus are the basic tools that economists use 
to study the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market. These tools can help us 
address a fundamental economic question: Is the allocation of resources deter-
mined by free markets desirable?

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
7-3a The Benevolent Social Planner
To evaluate market outcomes, we introduce into our analysis a new, hypothetical 
character called the benevolent social planner. The benevolent social planner is an 
all-knowing, all-powerful, well-intentioned dictator. The planner wants to max-
imize the economic well-being of everyone in society. What should this planner 
do? Should she just leave buyers and sellers at the equilibrium that they reach 
naturally on their own? Or can she increase economic well-being by altering the 
market outcome in some way?
To answer this question, the planner must first decide how to measure the eco-
nomic well-being of a society. One possible measure is the sum of consumer and 
producer surplus, which we call total surplus. Consumer surplus is the benefit that 
buyers receive from participating in a market, and producer surplus is the benefit 
that sellers receive. It is therefore natural to use total surplus as a measure of soci-
ety’s economic well-being.
To better understand this measure of economic well-being, recall how we mea-
sure consumer and producer surplus. We define consumer surplus as
Consumer surplus 5 Value to buyers 2 Amount paid by buyers.
Similarly, we define producer surplus as
Producer surplus 5 Amount received by sellers 2 Cost to sellers.
When we add consumer and producer surplus together, we obtain
Total surplus 5 (Value to buyers 2 Amount paid by buyers) 
 
1 (Amount received by sellers 2 Cost to sellers).
The amount paid by buyers equals the amount received by sellers, so the middle 
two terms in this expression cancel each other. As a result, we can write total sur-
plus as
Total surplus 5 Value to buyers 2 Cost to sellers. 
Total surplus in a market is the total value to buyers of the goods, as measured by 
their willingness to pay, minus the total cost to sellers of providing those goods.
If an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, we say that the 
allocation exhibits efficiency. If an allocation is not efficient, then some of the 
potential gains from trade among buyers and sellers are not being realized. 
For example, an allocation is inefficient if a good is not being produced by the 
sellers with lowest cost. In this case, moving production from a high-cost pro-
ducer to a low-cost producer will lower the total cost to sellers and raise total 
surplus. Similarly, an allocation is inefficient if a good is not being consumed 
by the buyers who value it most highly. In this case, moving consumption of 
the good from a buyer with a low valuation to a buyer with a high valuation 
will raise total surplus. 
In addition to efficiency, the social planner might also care about equality—
that is, whether the various buyers and sellers in the market have a similar level 
of economic well-being. In essence, the gains from trade in a market are like a 
pie to be shared among the market participants. The question of efficiency con-
cerns whether the pie is as big as possible. The question of equality concerns how

the pie is sliced and how the portions are distributed among members of society. 
In this chapter, we concentrate on efficiency as the social planner’s goal. Keep in 
mind, however, that real policymakers often care about equality as well.
7-3b Evaluating the Market Equilibrium 
Figure 7 shows consumer and producer surplus when a market reaches the equi-
librium of supply and demand. Recall that consumer surplus equals the area 
above the price and under the demand curve and producer surplus equals the 
area below the price and above the supply curve. Thus, the total area between 
the supply and demand curves up to the point of equilibrium represents the total 
surplus in this market. 
Is this equilibrium allocation of resources efficient? That is, does it maximize 
total surplus? To answer this question, recall that when a market is in equilibrium, 
the price determines which buyers and sellers participate in the market. Those 
buyers who value the good more than the price (represented by the segment 
AE on the demand curve) choose to buy the good; buyers who value it less than 
the price (represented by the segment EB) do not. Similarly, those sellers whose 
costs are less than the price (represented by the segment CE on the supply curve) 
choose to produce and sell the good; sellers whose costs are greater than the price 
(represented by the segment ED) do not.
These observations lead to two insights about market outcomes:
1. Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most 
highly, as measured by their willingness to pay.
2. Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce 
them at the lowest cost.

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
Thus, given the quantity produced and sold in a market equilibrium, the social 
planner cannot increase economic well-being by changing the allocation of con-
sumption among buyers or the allocation of production among sellers.
But can the social planner raise total economic well-being by increasing or 
decreasing the quantity of the good? The answer is no, as stated in this third 
insight about market outcomes: 
3. Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of 
consumer and producer surplus.
Figure 8 illustrates why this is true. To interpret this figure, keep in mind that the 
demand curve reflects the value to buyers and the supply curve reflects the cost 
to sellers. At any quantity below the equilibrium level, such as Q1, the value to the 
marginal buyer exceeds the cost to the marginal seller. As a result, increasing the 
quantity produced and consumed raises total surplus. This continues to be true 
until the quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Similarly, at any quantity beyond 
the equilibrium level, such as Q2, the value to the marginal buyer is less than the 
cost to the marginal seller. In this case, decreasing the quantity raises total sur-
plus, and this continues to be true until quantity falls to the equilibrium level. To 
maximize total surplus, the social planner would choose the quantity where the 
supply and demand curves intersect.
Together, these three insights tell us that the market outcome makes the sum of 
consumer and producer surplus as large as it can be. In other words, the equilib-
rium outcome is an efficient allocation of resources. The benevolent social planner 
can, therefore, leave the market outcome just as she finds it. This policy of leaving 
well enough alone goes by the French expression laissez faire, which literally trans-
lates to “leave to do” but is more broadly interpreted as “let people do as they will.” 
FIGURE 8
The Efficiency of the Equilibrium Quantity
At quantities less than the equilibrium quantity, such 
as Q1, the value to buyers exceeds the cost to sellers. 
At quantities greater than the equilibrium quantity, 
such as Q2, the cost to sellers exceeds the value to 
buyers. Therefore, the market equilibrium maximizes 
the sum of producer and consumer surplus.

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
Society is lucky that the planner doesn’t need to intervene. Although it has been 
a useful exercise imagining what an all-knowing, all-powerful, well- intentioned 
dictator would do, let’s face it: Such characters are hard to come by. Dictators are 
rarely benevolent, and even if we found someone so virtuous, she would lack 
crucial information.
 Suppose our social planner tried to choose an efficient allocation of resources 
on her own, instead of relying on market forces. To do so, she would need to know 
the value of a particular good to every potential consumer in the market and the 
cost for every potential producer. And she would need this information not only 
for this market but for every one of the many thousands of markets in the econ-
omy. The task is practically impossible, which explains why centrally planned 
economies never work very well.
The planner’s job becomes easy, however, once she takes on a partner: Adam 
Smith’s invisible hand of the marketplace. The invisible hand takes all the infor-
mation about buyers and sellers into account and guides everyone in the market 
to the best outcome as judged by the standard of economic efficiency. It is a truly 
remarkable feat. That is why economists so often advocate free markets as the 
best way to organize economic activity.
In many cities, finding an available 
parking spot on the street seems about 
as likely as winning the lottery. But 
if local governments relied more on 
the price system, they might be able to 
achieve a more efficient allocation of 
this scarce resource.
A Meter So Expensive,  
It Creates Parking Spots
By Michael Cooper and  
Jo Craven McGinty
S
AN FRANCISCO—The maddening quest 
for street parking is not just a tribulation 
for drivers, but a trial for cities. As much as 
a third of the traffic in some areas has been 
attributed to drivers circling as they hunt for 
spaces. The wearying tradition takes a toll 
in lost time, polluted air and, when drivers 
despair, double-parked cars that clog traffic 
even more. 
But San Francisco is trying to shorten the 
hunt with an ambitious experiment that aims 
to make sure that there is always at least one 
empty parking spot available on every block 
that has meters. The program, which uses new 
technology and the law of supply and demand, 
raises the price of parking on the city’s most 
crowded blocks and lowers it on its emptiest 
blocks. While the new prices are still being 
phased in—the most expensive spots have 
risen to $4.50 an hour, but could reach $6—
preliminary data suggests that the change 
may be having a positive effect in some areas. 
Change can already be seen on a stretch 
of Drumm Street downtown near the Embar-
cadero and the popular restaurants at the 
Ferry Building. Last summer it was nearly  
impossible to find spots there. But after the 
city gradually raised the price of parking to 
$4.50 an hour from $3.50, high-tech sensors 
embedded in the street showed that spots 
were available a little more often—leaving 
a welcome space the other day for the silver 
Toyota Corolla driven by Victor Chew, a sales-
man for a commercial dishwasher company 
who frequently parks in the area. 
“There are more spots available now,” 
said Mr. Chew, 48. “Now I don’t have to walk 
half a mile.” 
San Francisco’s parking experiment is the 
latest major attempt to improve the uneasy 
relationship between cities and the internal 
combustion engine—a century-long saga 
that has seen cities build highways and tear 
them down, widen streets and narrow them, 
and make more parking available at some 
times and discourage it at others, all to try to 
make their downtowns accessible but not too 
congested. 
The program here is being closely watched 
by cities around the country. With the help of a 
federal grant, San Francisco installed parking 
sensors and new meters at roughly a quarter 
of its 26,800 metered spots to track when and 
where cars are parked. And beginning last

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
CASE 
STUDY
SHOULD THERE BE A MARKET FOR ORGANS?
Some years ago, the front page of The Boston Globe ran the head-
line “How a Mother’s Love Helped Save Two Lives.” The newspa-
per told the story of Susan Stephens, a woman whose son needed 
a kidney transplant. When the doctor learned that the mother’s kidney was 
not compatible, he proposed a novel solution: If Stephens donated one of her 
kidneys to a stranger, her son would move to the top of the kidney waiting list. 
The mother accepted the deal, and soon two patients had the transplants they 
were waiting for.
The ingenuity of the doctor’s proposal and the nobility of the mother’s act can-
not be doubted. But the story raises some intriguing questions. If the mother could 
trade a kidney for a kidney, would the hospital allow her to trade a kidney for an 
expensive, experimental cancer treatment that she could not otherwise afford? 
Should she be allowed to exchange her kidney for free tuition for her son at the 
hospital’s medical school? Should she be able to sell her kidney and use the cash to 
trade in her old Chevy for a new Lexus?

organs. In essence, in the market for organs, the government has imposed a price

summer, the city began tweaking its prices 
every two months—giving it the option of 
raising them 25 cents an hour, or lowering 
them by as much as 50 cents—in the hope of 
leaving each block with at least one available 
spot. The city also has cut prices at many of 
the garages and parking lots it manages, to 
lure cars off the street….  
The program is the biggest test yet of 
the theories of Donald Shoup, a professor of 
urban planning at the University of California, 
Los Angeles. His 2005 book, “The High Cost of 
Free Parking,” made him something of a cult 
figure to city planners—a Facebook group, The 
Shoupistas, has more than a thousand mem-
bers. “I think the basic idea is that we will see 
a lot of benefits if we get the price of curbside 
parking right, which is the lowest price a city 
can charge and still have one or two vacant 
spaces available on every block,” he said. 
But raising prices is rarely popular. A 
chapter in Mr. Shoup’s book opens with a quote 
from George Costanza, the “Seinfeld” char-
acter: “My father didn’t pay for parking, my 
mother, my brother, nobody. It’s like going to 
a prostitute. Why should I pay when, if I apply 
myself, maybe I can get it for free?” Some San 
Francisco neighborhoods recently objected to 
a proposal to install meters on streets where 
parking is now free. And raising prices in the 
most desirable areas raises concerns that it 
will make them less accessible to the poor. 
That was on the minds of some parkers on 
Drumm Street, where the midday occupancy rate 
on one block fell to 86 percent from 98 percent 
after prices rose. Edward Saldate, 55, a hairstyl-
ist who paid nearly $17 for close to four hours of 
parking there, called it “a big rip-off.” 
Tom Randlett, 69, an accountant, said 
that he was pleased to be able to find a spot 
there for the first time, but acknowledged 
that the program was “complicated on the 
social equity level.” 
Officials note that parking rates are cut 
as often as they are raised. And Professor 
Shoup said that the program would benefit 
many poor people, including the many San 
Franciscans who do not have cars, because 
all parking revenues are used for mass tran-
sit and any reduction in traffic will speed 
the buses many people here rely on. And he 
imagined a day when drivers will no lon-
ger attribute good parking spots to luck or 
karma. 
“It will be taken for granted,” he said, 
“the way you take it for granted that when 
you go to a store you can get fresh bananas 
or apples.” ■

ceiling of zero. The result, as with any binding price ceiling, is a 
shortage of the good. The deal in the Stephens case did not fall 
under this prohibition because no cash changed hands.
Many economists believe that there would be large 
 benefits to allowing a free market for organs. People are born 
with two kidneys, but they usually need only one. Mean-
while, some people suffer from illnesses that leave them 
without any working kidney. Despite the obvious gains from 
trade, the current situation is dire: The typical patient has to 
wait several years for a kidney transplant, and every year 
thousands of people die because a compatible kidney can-
not be found. If those needing a kidney were allowed to buy 
one from those who have two, the price would rise to bal-
ance supply and demand. Sellers would be better off with 
the  extra cash in their pockets. Buyers would be better off 
with the organ they need to save their lives. The shortage of 
kidneys would disappear.
Such a market would lead to an efficient allocation 
of resources, but critics of this plan worry about fairness. 
A market for organs, they argue, would benefit the rich 
at the expense of the poor because organs would then be 
allocated to those most willing and able to pay. But you can also 
question the fairness of the current system. Now, most of us walk 
around with an extra organ that we don’t really need, while some 
of our fellow citizens are dying to get one. Is that fair? ●

7-4  Conclusion: Market Efficiency and Market Failure
This chapter introduced the basic tools of welfare economics—consumer and 
producer surplus—and used them to evaluate the efficiency of free markets. 
We showed that the forces of supply and demand allocate resources effi-
ciently. That is, even though each buyer and seller in a market is concerned 
only about her own welfare, together they are guided by an invisible hand to 
an equilibrium that maximizes the total benefits to buyers and sellers.
A word of warning is in order. To conclude that markets are efficient, we made 
several assumptions about how markets work. When these assumptions do not 
hold, our conclusion that the market equilibrium is efficient may no longer be 
true. As we close this chapter, let’s briefly consider two of the most important 
assumptions we made.
First, our analysis assumed that markets are perfectly competitive. In actual 
economies, however, competition is sometimes far from perfect. In some mar-
kets, a single buyer or seller (or a small group of them) may be able to con-
trol market prices. This ability to influence prices is called market power. Market 
power can cause markets to be inefficient because it keeps the price and quan-
tity away from the levels determined by the equilibrium of supply and demand.
Second, our analysis assumed that the outcome in a market matters only to the 
buyers and sellers who participate in that market. Yet sometimes the decisions of

CHAPTER 7   CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
buyers and sellers affect people who are not participants in the market at all. Pol-
lution is the classic example. The use of agricultural pesticides, for instance, affects 
not only the manufacturers who make them and the farmers who use them but 
also many others who breathe the air or drink the water contaminated by these 
pesticides. When a market exhibits such side effects, called externalities, the welfare  
implications of market activity depend on more than just the value obtained by the 
buyers and the cost incurred by the sellers. Because buyers and sellers may ignore 
these side effects when deciding how much to consume and produce, the equilib-
rium in a market can be inefficient from the standpoint of society as a whole. 
Market power and externalities are examples of a general phenomenon called 
market failure—the inability of some unregulated markets to allocate resources 
efficiently. When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the problem 
and increase economic efficiency. Microeconomists devote much effort to study-
ing when market failures are likely and how they are best corrected. As you con-
tinue your study of economics, you will see that the tools of welfare economics 
developed here are readily adapted to that endeavor.
Despite the possibility of market failure, the invisible hand of the marketplace 
is extraordinarily important. In many markets, the assumptions we made in this 
chapter work well and the conclusion of market efficiency applies directly. More-
over, we can use our analysis of welfare economics and market efficiency to shed 
light on the effects of various government policies. In the next two chapters, we 
apply the tools we have just developed to study two important policy issues—the 
welfare effects of taxation and of international trade.

SUMMARY 
r Consumer surplus equals buyers’ willingness to pay 
for a good minus the amount they actually pay, and 
it measures the benefit buyers get from participating 
in a market. Consumer surplus can be computed by 
finding the area below the demand curve and above 
the price.
r Producer surplus equals the amount sellers receive 
for their goods minus their costs of production, and 
it measures the benefit sellers get from participat-
ing in a market. Producer surplus can be computed 
by finding the area below the price and above the 
supply curve.
r An allocation of resources that maximizes total sur-
plus (the sum of consumer and producer surplus) is 
said to be efficient. Policymakers are often concerned 
with the efficiency, as well as the equality, of economic 
outcomes.
r The equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes 
total surplus. That is, the invisible hand of the mar-
ketplace leads buyers and sellers to allocate resources 
efficiently.
r Markets do not allocate resources efficiently in the 
presence of market failures such as market power or 
externalities.

monthly demand for minutes of calling is given  
by the equation QD 5 150 2 50P, where P is the  
price of a minute.
a. With each provider, what is the cost to your friend 
of an extra minute on the phone?
b. In light of your answer to (a), how many minutes 
with each provider would your friend talk on the 
phone?
c. How much would she end up paying each pro-
vider every month?
d. How much consumer surplus would she obtain 
with each provider? (Hint: Graph the demand 
curve and recall the formula for the area of a 
triangle.)
e. Which provider would you recommend that your 
friend choose? Why?
11. Consider how health insurance affects the quantity 
of healthcare services performed. Suppose that the 
typical medical procedure has a cost of $100, yet a 
person with health insurance pays only $20 out of 
pocket. Her insurance company pays the remaining 
$80. (The insurance company recoups the $80 through 
premiums, but the premium a person pays does not 
depend on how many procedures that person chooses 
to undertake.)
a. Draw the demand curve in the market for medical 
care. (In your diagram, the horizontal axis should 
represent the number of medical procedures.) 
Show the quantity of procedures demanded if 
each procedure has a price of $100. 
b. On your diagram, show the quantity of proce-
dures demanded if consumers pay only $20 per 
procedure. If the cost of each procedure to society 
is truly $100, and if individuals have health in-
surance as described above, will the number of 
procedures performed maximize total surplus? 
Explain.
c. Economists often blame the health insurance sys-
tem for excessive use of medical care. Given your 
analysis, why might the use of care be viewed as 
“excessive”?
d. What sort of policies might prevent this  
excessive use?

CHAPTER
8
Application: The Costs  
of Taxation
T
axes are often a source of heated political debate. In 1776, the anger of the 
American colonists over British taxes sparked the American Revolution. More 
than two centuries later, the American political parties still debate the proper 
size and shape of the tax system. Yet no one would deny that some level of tax-
ation is necessary. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., once said, “Taxes are what we 
pay for civilized society.”
Because taxation has such a major impact on the modern economy, we return to 
the topic several times throughout this book as we expand the set of tools we have

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
at our disposal. We began our study of taxes in Chapter 6. There we saw how a 
tax on a good affects its price and quantity sold and how the forces of supply and 
demand divide the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers. In this chapter, we 
extend this analysis and look at how taxes affect welfare, the economic well-being 
of participants in a market. In other words, we see how high the price of civilized 
society can be.
The effects of taxes on welfare might at first seem obvious. The government 
enacts taxes to raise revenue, and this revenue must come out of someone’s 
pocket. As we saw in Chapter 6, both buyers and sellers are worse off when a 
good is taxed: A tax raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers 
receive. Yet to fully understand how taxes affect economic well-being, we must 
compare the reduced welfare of buyers and sellers to the amount of revenue the 
government raises. The tools of consumer and producer surplus allow us to make 
this comparison. Our analysis will show that the cost of taxes to buyers and sell-
ers typically exceeds the revenue raised by the government.
8-1 The Deadweight Loss of Taxation
We begin by recalling one of the surprising lessons from Chapter 6: The impact of 
a tax on a market outcome is the same whether the tax is levied on buyers or sell-
ers of a good. When a tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward 
by the size of the tax; when it is levied on sellers, the supply curve shifts upward 
by that amount. In either case, when the tax is enacted, the price paid by buyers 
rises, and the price received by sellers falls. In the end, the elasticities of supply 
and demand determine how the tax burden is distributed between producers and 
consumers. This distribution is the same regardless of how the tax is levied.
Figure 1 shows these effects. To simplify our discussion, this figure does not 
show a shift in either the supply or demand curve, although one curve must shift. 
Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax is levied on sellers (the supply

curve shifts) or buyers (the demand curve shifts). In this chapter, we keep the 
analysis general and simplify the graphs by not showing the shift. For our pur-
poses here, the key result is that the tax places a wedge between the price buyers 
pay and the price sellers receive. Because of this tax wedge, the quantity sold falls 
below the level that would be sold without a tax. In other words, a tax on a good 
causes the size of the market for the good to shrink. These results should be famil-
iar from Chapter 6.
8-1a How a Tax Affects Market Participants
Let’s use the tools of welfare economics to measure the gains and losses from a 
tax on a good. To do this, we must take into account how the tax affects buyers, 
sellers, and the government. The benefit received by buyers in a market is mea-
sured by consumer surplus—the amount buyers are willing to pay for the good 
minus the amount they actually pay for it. The benefit received by sellers in a 
market is measured by producer surplus—the amount sellers receive for the good 
minus their costs. These are precisely the measures of economic welfare we used 
in Chapter 7.
What about the third interested party, the government? If T is the size of the tax 
and Q is the quantity of the good sold, then the government gets total tax revenue 
of T 3 Q. It can use this tax revenue to provide services, such as roads, police, 
and public education, or to help the needy. Therefore, to analyze how taxes affect 
economic well-being, we use the government’s tax revenue to measure the public 
benefit from the tax. Keep in mind, however, that this benefit actually accrues not 
to the government but to those on whom the revenue is spent.
Figure 2 shows that the government’s tax revenue is represented by the rect-
angle between the supply and demand curves. The height of this rectangle is the 
size of the tax, T, and the width of the rectangle is the quantity of the good sold, Q. 
 Because a rectangle’s area is its height multiplied by its width, this rectangle’s 
area is T 3 Q, which equals the tax revenue.

taxation with representa-

Tax Revenue
The tax revenue that the gov-

the size of the tax T times the

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
Welfare without a Tax   To see how a tax affects welfare, we begin by consider-
ing welfare before the government imposes a tax. Figure 3 shows the supply-and- 
demand diagram with the key areas marked by the letters A through F. 
Without a tax, the equilibrium price and quantity are found at the intersection 
of the supply and demand curves. The price is P1, and the quantity sold is Q1. 
 Because the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, consumer surplus 
is the area between the demand curve and the price, A 1 B 1 C. Similarly, because 
the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, producer surplus is the area between the 
supply curve and the price, D 1 E 1 F. In this case, because there is no tax, tax 
revenue is zero. 
Total surplus, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, equals the area 
A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F. In other words, as we saw in Chapter 7, total surplus is 
the area between the supply and demand curves up to the equilibrium quantity. 
The first column of the table in Figure 3 summarizes these conclusions.
Welfare with a Tax   Now consider welfare after the tax is enacted. The price paid 
by buyers rises from P1 to PB, so consumer surplus now equals only area A (the 
A tax on a good reduces consumer surplus (by the area B 1 C) and producer surplus (by 
the area D 1 E). Because the fall in producer and consumer surplus exceeds tax revenue 
(area B 1 D), the tax is said to impose a deadweight loss (area C 1 E).

area below the demand curve and above the buyers’ price). The price received by 
sellers falls from P1 to PS, so producer surplus now equals only area F (the area 
above the supply curve and below the sellers’ price). The quantity sold falls from 
Q1 to Q2, and the government collects tax revenue equal to the area B 1 D.
To compute total surplus with the tax, we add consumer surplus, producer sur-
plus, and tax revenue. Thus, we find that total surplus is area A 1 B 1 D 1 F. The 
second column of the table summarizes these results.
Changes in Welfare  We can now see the effects of the tax by comparing welfare 
before and after the tax is enacted. The third column of the table in Figure 3 shows 
the changes. Consumer surplus falls by the area B 1 C, and producer surplus falls 
by the area D 1 E. Tax revenue rises by the area B 1 D. Not surprisingly, the tax 
makes buyers and sellers worse off and the government better off. 
The change in total welfare includes the change in consumer surplus (which is 
negative), the change in producer surplus (which is also negative), and the change 
in tax revenue (which is positive). When we add these three pieces together, we 
find that total surplus in the market falls by the area C 1 E. Thus, the losses to buy-
ers and sellers from a tax exceed the revenue raised by the government. The fall in total 
surplus that results when a tax (or some other policy) distorts a market outcome is 
called a deadweight loss. The area C 1 E measures the size of the deadweight loss. 
To understand why taxes cause deadweight losses, recall one of the Ten 
 Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In Chapter 7, 
we saw that free markets normally allocate scarce resources efficiently. That is, in 
the absence of any tax, the equilibrium of supply and demand maximizes the total 
surplus of buyers and sellers in a market. When the government imposes a tax, 
it raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive, giving buyers 
an incentive to consume less and sellers an incentive to produce less. As buyers 
and sellers respond to these incentives, the size of the market shrinks below its 
optimum (as shown in the figure by the movement from Q1 to Q2). Thus, because 
taxes distort incentives, they cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently. 
8-1b Deadweight Losses and the Gains from Trade
To better understand why taxes cause deadweight losses, consider an example. 
Imagine that Mike cleans Mei’s house each week for $100. The opportunity cost of 
Mike’s time is $80, and the value of a clean house to Mei is $120. Thus, Mike and 
Mei each receive a $20 benefit from their deal. The total surplus of $40 measures 
the gains from trade in this particular transaction.
Now suppose that the government levies a $50 tax on the providers of cleaning 
services. There is now no price that Mei can pay Mike that will leave both of them 
better off. The most Mei would be willing to pay is $120, but then Mike would be left 
with only $70 after paying the tax, which is less than his $80 opportunity cost. Con-
versely, for Mike to receive his opportunity cost of $80, Mei would need to pay $130, 
which is above the $120 value she places on a clean house. As a result, Mei and Mike 
cancel their arrangement. Mike loses the income, and Mei lives in a dirtier house.
The tax has made Mike and Mei worse off by a total of $40 because they have 
each lost $20 of surplus. But note that the government collects no revenue from 
Mike and Mei because they decide to cancel their arrangement. The $40 is pure 
deadweight loss: It is a loss to buyers and sellers in a market that is not offset by 
an increase in government revenue. From this example, we can see the ultimate 
source of deadweight losses: Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buy-
ers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade.

The area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves created by the 
tax wedge (area C 1 E in Figure 3) measures these losses. This conclusion can be 
seen more easily in Figure 4 by recalling that the demand curve reflects the value 
of the good to consumers and that the supply curve reflects the costs of producers. 
When the tax raises the price buyers pay to PB and lowers the price sellers receive 
to PS, the marginal buyers and sellers leave the market, so the quantity sold falls 
from Q1 to Q2. Yet as the figure shows, the value of the good to these buyers still 
exceeds the cost to these sellers. At every quantity between Q1 and Q2, the situation 
is the same as in our example with Mike and Mei. The gains from trade—the dif-
ference between buyers’ value and sellers’ cost—are less than the tax. As a result, 
these trades are not made once the tax is imposed. The deadweight loss is the sur-
plus that is lost because the tax discourages these mutually advantageous trades.

8-2 The Determinants of the Deadweight Loss
What determines whether the deadweight loss from a tax is large or small? The 
answer is the price elasticities of supply and demand, which measure how much 
the quantity supplied and quantity demanded respond to changes in the price. 
Let’s consider first how the elasticity of supply affects the size of the dead-
weight loss. In the top two panels of Figure 5, the demand curve and the size of 
the tax are the same. The only difference in these figures is the elasticity of the 
supply curve. In panel (a), the supply curve is relatively inelastic: Quantity sup-
plied responds only slightly to changes in the price. In panel (b), the supply curve 
is relatively elastic: Quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the

In panels (a) and (b), the demand curve and the size of the tax are the same, but the price 
elasticity of supply is different. Notice that the more elastic the supply curve, the larger the 
deadweight loss of the tax. In panels (c) and (d), the supply curve and the size of the tax 
are the same, but the price elasticity of demand is different. Notice that the more elastic the 
demand curve, the larger the deadweight loss of the tax.

and demand curves, is larger when the supply curve is more elastic.
Similarly, the bottom two panels of Figure 5 show how the elasticity of demand 
affects the size of the deadweight loss. Here the supply curve and the size of the 
tax are held constant. In panel (c), the demand curve is relatively inelastic, and 
the deadweight loss is small. In panel (d), the demand curve is more elastic, and 
the deadweight loss from the tax is larger. 
The lesson from this figure is apparent. A tax has a deadweight loss because 
it induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior. The tax raises the price

paid by buyers, so they consume less. At the same time, the tax lowers the price 
received by sellers, so they produce less. Because of these changes in behavior, the 
equilibrium quantity in the market shrinks below the optimal quantity. The more 
responsive buyers and sellers are to changes in the price, the more the equilibrium 
quantity shrinks. Hence, the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the greater 
the deadweight loss of a tax.
CASE 
STUDY
THE DEADWEIGHT LOSS DEBATE
Supply, demand, elasticity, deadweight loss—all this economic the-
ory is enough to make your head spin. But believe it or not, these 
ideas are at the heart of a profound political question: How big 
should the government be? The debate hinges on these concepts because the larger 
the deadweight loss of taxation, the larger the cost of any government program. If 
taxation entails large deadweight losses, then these losses are a strong  argument 
for a leaner government that does less and taxes less. But if taxes  impose small 
deadweight losses, then government programs are less costly than they otherwise 
might be, which in turn argues for a more expansive government.
So how big are the deadweight losses of taxation? Economists disagree on the 
answer to this question. To see the nature of this disagreement, consider the most 
important tax in the U.S. economy: the tax on labor. The Social Security tax, the 
Medicare tax, and much of the federal income tax are labor taxes. Many state gov-
ernments also tax labor earnings through state income taxes. A labor tax places a 
wedge between the wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive. For a 
typical worker, if all forms of labor taxes are added together, the marginal tax rate on 
labor income—the tax on the last dollar of earnings—is about 40 percent. 
The size of the labor tax is easy to determine, but calculating the deadweight 
loss of this tax is less straightforward. Economists disagree about whether this 
40  percent labor tax has a small or a large deadweight loss. This disagreement 
arises because economists hold different views about the elasticity of labor supply.
Economists who argue that labor taxes do not greatly distort market outcomes 
believe that labor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work 
full-time regardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, and 
a tax on labor has a small deadweight loss.  Some evidence suggests that this may 
be the case for workers who are in their prime working years and who are the main 
breadwinners of their families.
Economists who argue that labor taxes are highly distortionary believe that 
 labor supply is more elastic. While admitting that some groups of workers may not 
change the quantity of labor they supply by very much in response to changes in 
labor taxes, these economists claim that many other groups respond more to incen-
tives. Here are some examples:
r Some workers can adjust the number of hours they work—for instance, by 
working overtime. The higher the wage, the more hours they choose to work.
r Many families have second earners—often married women with children—
with some discretion over whether to do unpaid work at home or paid work 
in the marketplace. When deciding whether to take a job, these second earn-
ers compare the benefits of being at home (including savings on the cost of 
child care) with the wages they could earn. 
r Many of the elderly can choose when to retire, and their decisions are partly 
based on the wage. Once they are retired, the wage determines their incen-
tive to work part-time.

CHAPTER 8   APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 
r Some people consider engaging in illegal economic activity, such as the drug 
trade, or working at jobs that pay “under the table” to evade taxes. Economists 
call this the underground economy. In deciding whether to work in the under-
ground economy or at a legitimate job, these potential criminals compare what 
they can earn by breaking the law with the wage they can earn legally.
In each of these cases, the quantity of labor supplied responds to the wage (the 
price of labor). Thus, these workers’ decisions are distorted when their labor earn-
ings are taxed. Labor taxes encourage workers to work fewer hours, second earn-
ers to stay at home, the elderly to retire early, and the unscrupulous to enter the 
underground economy.
The debate over the distortionary effects of labor taxation persists to this day.  
Indeed, whenever you see two political candidates debating whether the govern-
ment should provide more services or reduce the tax burden, keep in mind that 
part of the disagreement may rest on different views about the elasticity of labor 
supply and the deadweight loss of taxation. ●

8-3 Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary
Taxes rarely stay the same for long periods of time. Policymakers in local, state, 
and federal governments are always considering raising one tax or lowering  
another. Here we consider what happens to the deadweight loss and tax revenue 
when the size of a tax changes.
Figure 6 shows the effects of a small, medium, and large tax, holding constant the 
market’s supply and demand curves. The deadweight loss—the reduction in total 
surplus that results when the tax reduces the size of a market below the  optimum—
equals the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves. For the small 
tax in panel (a), the area of the deadweight loss triangle is quite small. But as the size 
of the tax rises in panels (b) and (c), the deadweight loss grows larger and larger.
Indeed, the deadweight loss of a tax rises even more rapidly than the size of 
the tax. This occurs because the deadweight loss is the area of a triangle, and the 
area of a triangle depends on the square of its size. If we double the size of a tax, 
for instance, the base and height of the triangle double, so the deadweight loss 
rises by a factor of 4. If we triple the size of a tax, the base and height triple, so the 
deadweight loss rises by a factor of 9.
The government’s tax revenue is the size of the tax times the amount of the 
good sold. As the first three panels of Figure 6 show, tax revenue equals the 
area of the rectangle between the supply and demand curves. For the small tax 
in panel (a), tax revenue is small. As the size of the tax increases from panel (a) 
to panel (b), tax revenue grows. But as the size of the tax increases further from 
panel (b) to panel (c), tax revenue falls because the higher tax drastically reduces 
the size of the market. For a very large tax, no revenue would be raised because 
people would stop buying and selling the good altogether.
The last two panels of Figure 6 summarize these results. In panel (d), we see 
that as the size of a tax increases, its deadweight loss quickly gets larger. By con-
trast, panel (e) shows that tax revenue first rises with the size of the tax, but as the 
tax increases further, the market shrinks so much that tax revenue starts to fall.

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
The deadweight loss is the reduction in total surplus due to the tax. Tax revenue is the 
amount of the tax multiplied by the amount of the good sold. In panel (a), a small tax has a 
small deadweight loss and raises a small amount of revenue. In panel (b), a somewhat larger 
tax has a larger deadweight loss and raises a larger amount of revenue. In panel (c), a very 
large tax has a very large deadweight loss, but because it has reduced the size of the market 
so much, the tax raises only a small amount of revenue. Panels (d) and (e) summarize these 
conclusions. Panel (d) shows that as the size of a tax grows larger, the deadweight loss grows 
larger. Panel (e) shows that tax revenue first rises and then falls. This relationship is called 
the Laffer curve.

THE LAFFER CURVE AND SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS
One day in 1974, economist Arthur Laffer sat in a Washington restau-
rant with some prominent journalists and politicians. He took out a 
napkin and drew a figure on it to show how tax rates affect tax rev-
enue. It looked much like panel (e) of our Figure 6. Laffer then suggested that the 
United States was on the downward-sloping side of this curve. Tax rates were so 
high, he argued, that reducing them might actually increase tax revenue.
Most economists were skeptical of Laffer’s suggestion. They accepted the idea 
that a cut in tax rates could increase tax revenue as a matter of economic theory,

CHAPTER 8   APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 
“A cut in federal income tax rates in the United States right now 
would lead to higher national income within five years than with-
out the tax cut.”
“A cut in federal income tax rates in the United States right now 
would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax rev-
enue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut.”

but they doubted whether it would do so in practice. There was scant evidence for 
Laffer’s view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels. 
Nonetheless, the Laffer curve (as it became known) captured the imagination of 
Ronald Reagan. David Stockman, budget director in the first Reagan administra-
tion, offers the following story:
[Reagan] had once been on the Laffer curve himself. “I came into the Big Money 
making pictures during World War II,” he would always say. At that time the 
wartime income surtax hit 90 percent. “You could only make four pictures and 
then you were in the top bracket,” he would continue. “So we all quit work-
ing after four pictures and went off to the country.” High tax rates caused less 
work. Low tax rates caused more. His experience proved it.
When Reagan ran for president in 1980, he made cutting taxes part of his platform. 
Reagan argued that taxes were so high that they were discouraging hard work and 
thereby depressing incomes. He argued that lower taxes would give people more 
incentive to work, which in turn would raise economic well-being. He suggested 
that incomes could rise by so much that tax revenue might increase, despite the 
lower tax rates. Because the cut in tax rates was intended to encourage people to in-
crease the quantity of labor they supplied, the views of Laffer and  
Reagan became known as supply-side economics.
Economists continue to debate Laffer’s argument. Many  
believe that subsequent history refuted Laffer’s conjecture that 
lower tax rates would raise tax revenue. Yet because history is open 
to alternative interpretations, other economists view the events 
of the 1980s as more favorable to the supply siders. To evaluate  
Laffer’s hypothesis definitively, we would need to rerun history 
without the Reagan tax cuts and see if tax revenues would have 
been higher or lower. Unfortunately, that experiment is impossible. 
Some economists take an intermediate position on this  issue. 
They believe that while an overall cut in tax rates normally  
reduces revenue, some taxpayers may occasionally find them-
selves on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. Other things  being 
equal, a tax cut is more likely to raise tax revenue if the cut 
applies to those taxpayers facing the highest tax rates. In addition,  
Laffer’s argument may be more compelling for countries with 
much higher tax rates than the United States. In Sweden in the 
early 1980s, for instance, the typical worker faced a marginal tax 
rate of about 80 percent. Such a high tax rate provides a substantial 
disincentive to work. Studies have suggested that Sweden would 
have indeed raised more tax revenue if it had lowered its tax rates.
Economists disagree about these issues in part because there is 
no consensus about the size of the relevant elasticities. The more 
elastic supply and demand are in any market, the more taxes dis-
tort behavior, and the more likely it is that a tax cut will increase 
tax revenue. There is no debate, however, about the general les-
son: How much revenue the government gains or loses from a 
tax change cannot be computed just by looking at tax rates. It 
also depends on how the tax change affects people’s behavior. ●

8-4 Conclusion
In this chapter, we have used the tools developed in the previous chapter to fur-
ther our understanding of taxes. One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in 
Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. In 
Chapter 7, we used the concepts of producer and consumer surplus to make this 
principle more precise. Here we have seen that when the government imposes 
taxes on buyers or sellers of a good, society loses some of the benefits of market 
efficiency. Taxes are costly to market participants not only because taxes transfer 
resources from those participants to the government but also because they alter 
incentives and distort market outcomes.
The analysis presented here and in Chapter 6 should give you a good basis for 
understanding the economic impact of taxes, but this is not the end of the story. 
Microeconomists study how best to design a tax system, including how to strike 
the right balance between equality and efficiency. Macroeconomists study how 
taxes influence the overall economy and how policymakers can use the tax system 
to stabilize economic activity and to achieve more rapid economic growth. So as 
you continue your study of economics, don’t be surprised when the subject of 
taxation comes up yet again.

CHAPTER 8   APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 
r A tax on a good reduces the welfare of buyers and sell-
ers of the good, and the reduction in consumer and 
producer surplus usually exceeds the revenue raised 
by the government. The fall in total surplus—the 
sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and tax 
 revenue—is called the deadweight loss of the tax.
r Taxes have deadweight losses because they cause buy-
ers to consume less and sellers to produce less, and 
these changes in behavior shrink the size of the market 
below the level that maximizes total surplus. Because 
the elasticities of supply and demand measure how 
much market participants respond to market condi-
tions, larger elasticities imply larger deadweight losses.
r As a tax grows larger, it distorts incentives more, and its 
deadweight loss grows larger. Because a tax reduces the 
size of the market, however, tax revenue does not con-
tinually increase. It first rises with the size of a tax, but 
if the tax gets large enough, tax revenue starts to fall.

to 800. Calculate tax revenue and deadweight loss 
with this larger tax. Are they double, more than 
double, or less than double? Explain.
10. Suppose that a market is described by the following 
supply and demand equations:
QS 5 2P
QD 5 300 2 P
a. Solve for the equilibrium price and the equilib-
rium quantity.
b. Suppose that a tax of T is placed on buyers, so the 
new demand equation is
QD 5 300 2 (P 1 T)
Solve for the new equilibrium. What happens to 
the price received by sellers, the price paid by buy-
ers, and the quantity sold?
c. Tax revenue is T 3 Q. Use your answer from part 
(b) to solve for tax revenue as a function of T. 
Graph this relationship for T between 0 and 300.
d. The deadweight loss of a tax is the area of the 
triangle between the supply and demand curves. 
Recalling that the area of a triangle is ½ 3 base 3 
height, solve for deadweight loss as a function 
of T. Graph this relationship for T between 
0 and 300. (Hint: Looking sideways, the base of 
the deadweight loss triangle is T, and the height is 
the difference between the quantity sold with the 
tax and the quantity sold without the tax.) 
e. The government now levies a tax of $200 per unit 
on this good. Is this a good policy? Why or why 
not? Can you propose a better policy?

CHAPTER

I
f you check the labels on the clothes you are wearing, you will probably find 
that some were made in another country. A century ago, the textile and clothing 
industry was a major part of the U.S. economy, but that is no longer the case. 
Faced with foreign competitors that can produce quality goods at low cost, many 
U.S. firms found it increasingly difficult to produce and sell textiles and clothing 
at a profit. As a result, they laid off their workers and shut down their factories. 
Today, most of the textiles and clothing that Americans consume are imported.
The story of the textile industry raises important questions for economic pol-
icy: How does international trade affect economic well-being? Who gains 
and who loses from free trade among countries, and how do the 
gains compare to the losses?

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
Chapter 3 introduced the study of international trade by applying the principle 
of comparative advantage. According to this principle, all countries can benefit 
from trading with one another because trade allows each country to specialize in 
doing what it does best. But the analysis in Chapter 3 was incomplete. It did not 
explain how the international marketplace achieves these gains from trade or how 
the gains are distributed among the various economic participants.
We now return to the study of international trade to tackle these questions. 
Over the past several chapters, we have developed many tools for analyzing 
how markets work: supply, demand, equilibrium, consumer surplus, producer 
surplus, and so on. With these tools, we can learn more about how international 
trade affects economic well-being.
9-1 The Determinants of Trade
Consider the market for textiles. The textile market is well suited to studying the 
gains and losses from international trade: Textiles are made in many countries 
around the world, and there is much world trade in textiles. Moreover, the textile 
market is one in which policymakers often consider (and sometimes implement) 
trade restrictions to protect domestic producers from foreign competitors. Here 
we examine the textile market in the imaginary country of Isoland. 
9-1a The Equilibrium without Trade
As our story begins, the Isolandian textile market is isolated from the rest of the 
world. By government decree, no one in Isoland is allowed to import or export 
textiles, and the penalty for violating the decree is so large that no one dares try.  
Because there is no international trade, the market for textiles in Isoland consists 
solely of Isolandian buyers and sellers. As Figure 1 shows, the domestic price adjusts 
to balance the quantity supplied by domestic sellers and the quantity demanded by 
domestic buyers. The figure shows the consumer and producer surplus in the equi-
librium without trade. The sum of consumer and producer surplus measures the 
total benefits that buyers and sellers receive from participating in the textile market.
FIGURE 1
The Equilibrium without 
International Trade
When an economy cannot trade 
in world markets, the price 
adjusts to balance domestic 
supply and demand. This figure 
shows consumer and producer 
surplus in an equilibrium with-
out international trade for the 
textile market in the imaginary 
country of Isoland.

CHAPTER 9   APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Now suppose that, in a political upset, Isoland elects a new president. The 
president campaigned on a platform of “change” and promised the voters bold 
new ideas. Her first act is to assemble a team of economists to evaluate Isolandian 
trade policy. She asks them to report on three questions:
r If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, what will 
happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the domes-
tic textile market? 
r Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will the gains 
exceed the losses?
r Should a tariff (a tax on textile imports) be part of the new trade policy?
After reviewing supply and demand in their favorite textbook (this one, of 
course), the Isolandian economics team begins its analysis. 
9-1b The World Price and Comparative Advantage
The first issue our economists take up is whether Isoland is likely to become a 
textile importer or a textile exporter. In other words, if free trade is allowed, will 
Isolandians end up buying or selling textiles in world markets?
To answer this question, the economists compare the current Isolandian 
price of textiles to the price of textiles in other countries. We call the price 
prevailing in world markets the world price. If the world price of textiles is 
higher than the domestic price, then Isoland will export textiles once trade 
is permitted. Isolandian textile producers will be eager to receive the higher 
prices available abroad and will start selling their textiles to buyers in other 
countries. Conversely, if the world price of textiles is lower than the domestic 
price, then Isoland will import textiles. Because foreign sellers offer a  better 
price, Isolandian textile consumers will quickly start buying textiles from 
other countries.
In essence, comparing the world price with the domestic price before trade 
reveals whether Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
The domestic price reflects the opportunity cost of textiles: It tells us how much 
an Isolandian must give up to obtain one unit of textiles. If the domestic price is 
low, the cost of producing textiles in Isoland is low, suggesting that Isoland has 
a comparative advantage in producing textiles relative to the rest of the world. 
If the domestic price is high, then the cost of producing textiles in Isoland is 
high, suggesting that foreign countries have a comparative advantage in pro-
ducing textiles.
As we saw in Chapter 3, trade among nations is ultimately based on compara-
tive advantage. That is, trade is beneficial because it allows each nation to special-
ize in doing what it does best. By comparing the world price with the domestic 
price before trade, we can determine whether Isoland is better or worse than the 
rest of the world at producing textiles.
QuickQuiz
The country Autarka does not allow international trade. In Autarka, you 
can buy a wool suit for 3 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, in neighboring coun-
tries, you can buy the same suit for 2 ounces of gold. If Autarka were to allow free trade, 
would it import or export wool suits? Why?

prevails in the world 
 market for that good

170
PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
To analyze the welfare effects of free trade, the Isolandian economists begin with 
the assumption that Isoland is a small economy compared to the rest of the world. 
This small-economy assumption means that Isoland’s actions have little effect on 
world markets. Specifically, any change in Isoland’s trade policy will not affect 
the world price of textiles. The Isolandians are said to be price takers in the world 
economy. That is, they take the world price of textiles as given. Isoland can be an 
exporting country by selling textiles at this price or an importing country by buy-
ing textiles at this price. 
The small-economy assumption is not necessary to analyze the gains and losses 
from international trade. But the Isolandian economists know from experience 
(and from reading Chapter 2 of this book) that making simplifying assumptions is 
a key part of building a useful economic model. The assumption that Isoland is a 
small economy simplifies the analysis, and the basic lessons do not change in the 
more complicated case of a large economy.
9-2a The Gains and Losses of an Exporting Country
Figure 2 shows the Isolandian textile market when the domestic equilibrium price 
before trade is below the world price. Once trade is allowed, the domestic price 
rises to equal the world price. No seller of textiles would accept less than the 
world price, and no buyer would pay more than the world price.
9-2 The Winners and Losers from Trade
FIGURE 2
International Trade in an 
Exporting Country
Once trade is allowed, the 
domestic price rises to equal 
the world price. The supply 
curve shows the quantity of 
textiles produced domesti-
cally, and the demand curve 
shows the quantity consumed 
domestically. Exports from 
Isoland equal the differ-
ence between the domestic 
quantity supplied and the 
domestic quantity demanded 
at the world price. Sellers are 
better off (producer  surplus 
rises from C to B 1 C 1 D), 
and  buyers are worse off 
( consumer surplus falls from  
A 1 B to A). Total surplus rises 
by an amount equal to area D, 
 indicating that trade raises the 
economic well- being of the 
country as a whole.

CHAPTER 9   APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
After the domestic price has risen to equal the world price, the domestic 
 quantity supplied differs from the domestic quantity demanded. The supply 
curve shows the quantity of textiles supplied by Isolandian sellers. The demand 
curve shows the quantity of textiles demanded by Isolandian buyers. Because 
the domestic quantity supplied is greater than the domestic quantity demanded, 
 Isoland sells textiles to other countries. Thus, Isoland becomes a textile exporter.
Although domestic quantity supplied and domestic quantity demanded differ, 
the textile market is still in equilibrium because there is now another participant 
in the market: the rest of the world. One can view the horizontal line at the world 
price as representing the rest of the world’s demand for textiles. This demand 
curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland, as a small economy, can sell as many 
textiles as it wants at the world price.
Consider the gains and losses from opening up trade. Clearly, not everyone 
benefits. Trade forces the domestic price to rise to the world price. Domestic pro-
ducers of textiles are better off because they can now sell textiles at a higher price, 
but domestic consumers of textiles are worse off because they now have to buy 
textiles at a higher price.
To measure these gains and losses, we look at the changes in consumer and 
producer surplus. Before trade is allowed, the price of textiles adjusts to balance 
domestic supply and domestic demand. Consumer surplus, the area between the 
demand curve and the before-trade price, is area A 1 B. Producer surplus, the 
area between the supply curve and the before-trade price, is area C. Total surplus 
be fore trade, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, is area A 1 B 1 C.
After trade is allowed, the domestic price rises to the world price. Con-
sumer surplus shrinks to area A (the area between the demand curve and the 
world price). Producer surplus increases to area B 1 C 1 D (the area between 
the supply curve and the world price). Thus, total surplus with trade is area 
A 1 B 1 C 1 D.
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an  
exporting country. Sellers benefit because producer surplus increases by the area 
B 1 D. Buyers are worse off because consumer surplus decreases by the area B. 
Because the gains of sellers exceed the losses of buyers by the area D, total surplus 
in Isoland increases.
This analysis of an exporting country yields two conclusions:
r When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic 
producers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good are 
worse off. 
r Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of 
the winners exceed the losses of the losers.
9-2b The Gains and Losses of an Importing Country
Now suppose that the domestic price before trade is above the world price. Once 
again, after trade is allowed, the domestic price must equal the world price. As 
Figure 3 shows, the domestic quantity supplied is less than the domestic quan-
tity demanded. The difference between the domestic quantity demanded and the  
domestic quantity supplied is bought from other countries, and Isoland becomes 
a textile importer.
In this case, the horizontal line at the world price represents the supply of the 
rest of the world. This supply curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland is a small 
economy and, therefore, can buy as many textiles as it wants at the world price.

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
Once again, consider the gains and losses from trade. As in the previous case, 
not everyone benefits, but here the winners and losers are reversed. When trade 
forces the domestic price to fall, domestic consumers are better off (they can now 
buy textiles at a lower price), and domestic producers are worse off (they now 
have to sell textiles at a lower price). Changes in consumer and producer surplus 
measure the size of the gains and losses. Before trade, consumer surplus is area A, 
producer surplus is area B 1 C, and total surplus is area A 1 B 1 C. After trade is 
allowed, consumer surplus is area A 1 B 1 D, producer surplus is area C, and total 
surplus is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D. 
These welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an 
importing country. Buyers benefit because consumer surplus increases by the area 
B 1 D. Sellers are worse off because producer surplus falls by the area B. The gains 
of buyers exceed the losses of sellers, and total surplus increases by the area D.
This analysis of an importing country yields two conclusions parallel to those 
for an exporting country:
r When a country allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, domestic 
consumers of the good are better off, and domestic producers of the good are 
worse off. 
r Trade raises the economic well-being of a nation in the sense that the gains of 
the winners exceed the losses of the losers.
FIGURE 3

Importing Country
Once trade is allowed, the do-
mestic price falls to equal the 
world price. The supply curve 
shows the amount produced 
domestically, and the demand 
curve shows the amount con-
sumed domestically. Imports 
equal the difference between 
the domestic quantity de-
manded and the domestic 
quantity supplied at the world 
price. Buyers are better off 
(consumer surplus rises from  
A to A 1 B 1 D), and sellers 
are worse off (producer sur-
plus falls from B 1 C to C). To-
tal surplus rises by an amount 
equal to area D, indicating 
that trade raises the economic 
well-being of the country as a 
whole.

CHAPTER 9   APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Having completed our analysis of trade, we can better understand one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: Trade can make everyone better off. If 
Isoland opens its textile market to international trade, the change creates winners 
and losers, regardless of whether Isoland ends up exporting or importing textiles. 
In either case, however, the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers, so 
the winners could compensate the losers and still be better off. In this sense, trade 
can make everyone better off. But will trade make everyone better off? Probably 
not. In practice, compensation for the losers from international trade is rare. With-
out such compensation, opening an economy to international trade is a policy that 
expands the size of the economic pie, but it can leave some participants in the 
economy with a smaller slice.
We can now see why the debate over trade policy is often contentious. When-
ever a policy creates winners and losers, the stage is set for a political battle.  
Nations sometimes fail to enjoy the gains from trade because the losers from free 
trade are better organized than the winners. The losers may turn their cohesiveness 
into political clout and lobby for trade restrictions such as tariffs or import quotas.
9-2c Effects of a Tariff
The Isolandian economists next consider the effects of a tariff—a tax on imported 
goods. The economists quickly realize that a tariff on textiles will have no effect if 
Isoland becomes a textile exporter. If no one in Isoland is interested in importing 
textiles, a tax on textile imports is irrelevant. The tariff matters only if Isoland 
becomes a textile importer. Concentrating their attention on this case, the econo-
mists compare welfare with and without the tariff.
Figure 4 shows the Isolandian market for textiles. Under free trade, the 
domestic price equals the world price. A tariff raises the price of imported  textiles 
above the world price by the amount of the tariff. Domestic suppliers of textiles, 
who compete with suppliers of imported textiles, can now sell their textiles for 
the world price plus the amount of the tariff. Thus, the price of textiles—both 
imported and domestic—rises by the amount of the tariff and is, therefore, closer 
to the price that would prevail without trade.
The change in price affects the behavior of domestic buyers and sellers.  Because 
the tariff raises the price of textiles, it reduces the domestic quantity demanded 
from Q1
D to Q2
D  and raises the domestic quantity supplied from Q1
S to Q2
S. Thus, the 
tariff reduces the quantity of imports and moves the domestic market closer to its equilib-
rium without trade.
Now consider the gains and losses from the tariff. Because the tariff raises the 
domestic price, domestic sellers are better off, and domestic buyers are worse off. 
In addition, the government raises revenue. To measure these gains and losses, 
we look at the changes in consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government 
revenue. These changes are summarized in the table in Figure 4. 
Before the tariff, the domestic price equals the world price. Consumer surplus, the 
area between the demand curve and the world price, is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F. 
Producer surplus, the area between the supply curve and the world price, is area G. 
Government revenue equals zero. Total surplus, the sum of consumer surplus, pro-
ducer surplus, and government revenue, is area A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F 1 G.
Once the government imposes a tariff, the domestic price exceeds the world 
price by the amount of the tariff. Consumer surplus is now area A 1 B. Producer 
surplus is area C 1 G. Government revenue, which is the size of the tariff multi-
plied by the quantity of after-tariff imports, is the area E. Thus, total surplus with 
the tariff is area A 1 B 1 C 1 E 1 G.

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
A tariff, a tax on imports, reduces the quantity of imports and moves a market closer to 
the equilibrium that would exist without trade. Total surplus falls by an amount equal to 
area D 1 F. These two triangles represent the deadweight loss from the tariff.

To determine the total welfare effects of the tariff, we add the change in con-
sumer surplus (which is negative), the change in producer surplus (positive), and 
the change in government revenue (positive). We find that total surplus in the 
market decreases by the area D 1 F. This fall in total surplus is called the dead-
weight loss of the tariff.
A tariff causes a deadweight loss because a tariff is a type of tax. Like most 
taxes, it distorts incentives and pushes the allocation of scarce resources away 
from the optimum. In this case, we can identify two effects. First, when the tariff 
raises the domestic price of textiles above the world price, it encourages domestic 
producers to increase production from Q1
S to Q2
S. Even though the cost of making 
these incremental units exceeds the cost of buying them at the world price, the 
tariff makes it profitable for domestic producers to manufacture them nonethe-
less. Second, when the tariff raises the price that domestic textile consumers have 

175
CHAPTER 9   APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
to pay, it encourages them to reduce their consumption of textiles from Q1
D to Q2
D. 
Even though domestic consumers value these incremental units at more than the 
world price, the tariff induces them to cut back their purchases. Area D represents 
the deadweight loss from the overproduction of textiles, and area F represents 
the deadweight loss from the underconsumption of textiles. The total deadweight 
loss of the tariff is the sum of these two triangles.
9-2d The Lessons for Trade Policy
The team of Isolandian economists can now write to the new president:
Dear Madam President,
You asked us three questions about opening up trade. After much hard work, 
we have the answers.
Question: If the government allows Isolandians to import and export textiles, 
what will happen to the price of textiles and the quantity of textiles sold in the 
domestic textile market? 
Answer: Once trade is allowed, the Isolandian price of textiles will be driven to 
equal the price prevailing around the world.
If the world price is now higher than the Isolandian price, our price will rise. 
The higher price will reduce the amount of textiles Isolandians consume and 
raise the amount of textiles that Isolandians produce. Isoland will, therefore, 
become a textile exporter. This occurs because, in this case, Isoland has a com-
parative advantage in producing textiles. 
Import Quotas: Another Way to Restrict Trade
B
eyond tariffs, another way that nations sometimes restrict inter-
national trade is by putting limits on how much of a good can be  
imported. In this book, we will not analyze such a policy, other than to 
point out the conclusion: Import quotas are much like tariffs. Both tariffs 
and import quotas reduce the quantity of imports, raise the domestic 
price of the good, decrease the welfare of domestic consumers, increase 
the welfare of domestic producers, and cause deadweight losses. 
There is only one difference between these two types of trade 
 restriction: A tariff raises revenue for the government, whereas an  import 
quota creates surplus for those who obtain the licenses to import. The 
profit for the holder of an import license is the difference between the 
 domestic price (at which she sells the imported good) and the world 
price (at which she buys it).
Tariffs and import quotas are even more similar if the government 
charges a fee for the import licenses. Suppose the government sets 
the license fee equal to the difference between the domestic price and 
the world price. In this case, the entire profit of license holders is paid 
to the government in li-
cense fees, and the import 
quota works exactly like a 
tariff. Consumer surplus, 
 producer surplus, and gov-
ernment revenue are precisely 
the same under the two policies.
In practice, however, countries that restrict trade with import 
 quotas rarely do so by selling the import licenses. For example, the U.S. 
 government has at times pressured Japan to “voluntarily” limit the sale 
of Japanese cars in the United States. In this case, the Japanese govern-
ment allocates the import licenses to Japanese firms, and the surplus 
from these licenses accrues to those firms. From the standpoint of U.S. 
welfare, this kind of import quota is worse than a U.S. tariff on imported 
cars. Both a tariff and an import quota raise prices, restrict trade, and 
cause deadweight losses, but at least the tariff produces revenue for the 
U.S. government rather than profit for foreign producers. ■

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
Conversely, if the world price is now lower than the Isolandian price, our 
price will fall. The lower price will raise the amount of textiles that Isolandians 
consume and lower the amount of textiles that Isolandians produce.  Isoland 
will, therefore, become a textile importer. This occurs because, in this case, 
other countries have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
Question: Who will gain from free trade in textiles and who will lose, and will 
the gains exceed the losses?
Answer: The answer depends on whether the price rises or falls when trade 
is allowed. If the price rises, producers of textiles gain, and consumers of tex-
tiles lose. If the price falls, consumers gain, and producers lose. In both cases, 
the gains are larger than the losses. Thus, free trade raises the total welfare of 
Isolandians.
Question: Should a tariff be part of the new trade policy?
Answer: A tariff has an impact only if Isoland becomes a textile importer. In 
this case, a tariff moves the economy closer to the no-trade equilibrium and, 
like most taxes, causes deadweight losses. A tariff improves the welfare of 
domestic producers and raises revenue for the government, but these gains are 
more than offset by the losses suffered by consumers. The best policy, from the 
standpoint of economic efficiency, would be to allow trade without a tariff.
We hope you find these answers helpful as you decide on your new policy. 
Your faithful servants,

9-2e Other Benefits of International Trade
The conclusions of the Isolandian economics team are based on the standard anal-
ysis of international trade. Their analysis uses the most fundamental tools in the 
economist’s toolbox: supply, demand, and producer and consumer surplus. It 
shows that there are winners and losers when a nation opens itself up to trade, 
but the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers. 
The case for free trade can be made even stronger, however, because there are 
several other economic benefits of trade beyond those emphasized in the stan-
dard analysis. In a nutshell, here are some of these other benefits:
r Increased variety of goods. Goods produced in different countries are 
not exactly the same. German beer, for instance, is not the same as Amer-
ican beer. Free trade gives consumers in all countries greater variety to 
choose from.
r Lower costs through economies of scale. Some goods can be produced at 
low cost only if they are produced in large quantities—a phenomenon called 
economies of scale. A firm in a small country cannot take full advantage of 
economies of scale if it can sell only in a small domestic market. Free trade 
gives firms access to larger world markets and allows them to realize econo-
mies of scale more fully.
r Increased competition. A company shielded from foreign competitors is more 
likely to have market power, which in turn gives it the ability to raise prices 
above competitive levels. This is a type of market failure. Opening up trade fos-
ters competition and gives the invisible hand a better chance to work its magic.

CHAPTER 9   APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Free international trade can help the 
world’s poorest citizens.
Andy Warhol’s Guide to Public 
Policy
By Arthur C. Brooks
I 
often ask people in my business — public pol-
icy — where they get their inspiration. Liberals 
often point to John F. Kennedy. Conservatives 
usually cite Ronald Reagan.  Personally, I prefer 
the artist Andy Warhol, who famously declared, 
“I like boring things.” He was referring to art, of 
course. But the sentiment provides solid public 
policy  guidance as well.
Warhol’s work exalted the everyday “bor-
ing” items that display the transcendental 
beauty of life itself. The canonical example is 
his famous paintings of Campbell Soup cans. 
Some people sneered, but those willing to look 
closely could see what he was doing. It is the 
same idea expressed in an old Zen saying,  
often attributed to the eighth-century Chinese 
Buddhist philosopher Layman Pang: “How 
wondrously supernatural and miraculous! I 
draw water and I carry wood!”
Warhol’s critical insight is usually lost on 
most of the world. This is not because people 
are stupid, but because our brains are wired to 
filter out the mundane and focus on the novel. 
This turns out to be an important survival adap-
tation. To discern a predator, you must filter out 
the constant rustling of leaves and notice the 
strange snap of a twig.
Warhol believed that defeating this cognitive 
bias led to greater appreciation of beauty. It also 
leads to better public policy, especially in reliev-
ing poverty. For example, while our attention is 
naturally drawn to the latest fascinating and 
expensive innovations in tropical public health, 
many experts insist it is cheap, boring mosquito 
bed nets that best protect against malaria.  
Despite their lifesaving utility, these boring nets 
tend to be chronically underprovided.
We can look closer to home, too. People love 
to find ways to get fancy technology into poor 
schoolchildren’s hands, but arguably the best 
way to help children falling behind in school is 
simply to devise ways to get them to show up.
But the very best example of the Warhol 
principle in policy is international trade. If it 
is progress against poverty that we’re pur-
suing, trade beats the pants off every fancy 
development program ever devised. The sim-
ple mundane beauty of making things and  
exchanging them freely is the best anti- poverty 
achievement in history. 
For more than two decades, the global 
poverty rate has been decreasing by roughly 
1 percent a year. To put this in perspective, that 
comes to about 70 million people —  equivalent 
to the whole population of Turkey or Thailand — 
climbing out of poverty annually. Add it up, and 
around a billion people have escaped destitution 
since 1990.
Why? It isn’t the United Nations or for-
eign aid. It is, in the words of the publication 
 YaleGlobal Online, “High growth spillovers orig-
inating from large open emerging economies 
that utilize cross-border supply chains.” For 
readers who don’t have tenure, that means free 
trade in poor countries.
That mug in your hand that says “Made in 
China” is part of the reason that 680  million 
Chinese have been pulled out of absolute pov-
erty since the 1980s. No giant collaboration 
among transnational technocrats or lending 
initiatives did that. It was because of economic 
reforms in China, of people making stuff, put-
ting it on boats, and sending it to be sold in 
America — to you. Critics of free trade often 
argue that open economies lead to exploitation 
or environmental degradation. These are serious 
issues, but protectionism is never the answer. 
Curbing trade benefits entrenched domestic  
interests and works against the world’s poor. 
And what of claims that trade increases 
global income inequality? They are false. Econ-
omists at the World Bank and at LIS (formerly 
known as the Luxembourg Income Study Cen-
ter) have shown that, for the world as a whole, 
income inequality has fallen for most of the 
past 20 years. This is chiefly because of rising 
incomes from globalization in the developing 
world. . . .
Fortunately, President Obama appreciates 
the benefits of trade and is currently fight-
ing for the latest international trade pact, the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership (T.P.P.). It would knock 
down barriers between North  American, South 
American and East Asian nations, benefiting 
rich and poor people and countries alike. Admi-
rably, the president is standing up to critics in 
his own party (as well as some in the opposi-
tion) who oppose the deal. With luck, T.P.P. will 
make its way through the House and Senate this 
spring or summer, and receive the president’s 
signature.
Trade doesn’t solve every problem, of course. 
The world needs democracy, security and many 
other expressions of American values and lead-
ership as well. But in a policy world crowded 
with outlandish, wasteful boondoggles, free 
trade is just the kind of beautifully boring War-
holian strategy we need. Americans dedicated to 
helping others ought to support it without com-
promise or apology. ■

r Enhanced flow of ideas. The transfer of technological advances around the 
world is often thought to be linked to the trading of the goods that embody 
those advances. The best way for a poor agricultural nation to learn about 
the computer revolution, for instance, is to buy some computers from abroad 
rather than trying to make them domestically. 
Thus, free international trade increases variety for consumers, allows firms to 
take advantage of economies of scale, makes markets more competitive, and 
 facilitates the spread of technology. If the Isolandian economists also took these 
effects into account, their advice to the president would be even more forceful.

9-3 The Arguments for Restricting Trade
The letter from the economics team starts to persuade the new president of 
 Isoland to consider allowing trade in textiles. She notes that the domestic price 
is now high compared to the world price. Free trade would, therefore, cause the 
price of textiles to fall and hurt domestic textile producers. Before implementing 
the new policy, she asks Isolandian textile companies to comment on the econo-
mists’ advice.
Not surprisingly, the textile companies oppose free trade in textiles. They  
believe that the government should protect the domestic textile industry from for-
eign competition. Let’s consider some of the arguments they might give to sup-
port their position and how the economics team would respond.
9-3a The Jobs Argument
Opponents of free trade often argue that trade with other countries destroys  
domestic jobs. In our example, free trade in textiles would cause the price of 
“You like protectionism as a ‘working man.’  
How about as a consumer?”

What to Expect When You’re Free 
Trading 
By Steven E. Landsburg
A
ll economists know that when American jobs 
are outsourced, Americans as a group are 
net winners. What we lose through lower wages 
is more than offset by what we gain through 
lower prices. In other words, the winners can 
more than afford to compensate the losers. Does 
that mean they ought to? Does it create a moral 
mandate for taxpayer- subsidized retraining pro-
grams?. . .
Um, no. Even if you’ve just lost your job, 
there’s something fundamentally churlish about 
blaming the very phenomenon that’s elevated 
you above the subsistence level since the day 
you were born. If the world owes you compensa-
tion for enduring the downside of trade, what do 
you owe the world for enjoying the upside?
I doubt there’s a human being on earth 
who hasn’t benefited from the opportunity to 
trade freely with his neighbors. Imagine what 
your life would be like if you had to grow your 
own food, make your own clothes and rely on 
your grandmother’s home remedies for health 
care. Access to a trained physician might  
reduce the demand for grandma’s home reme-
dies, but—especially at her age—she’s still 
got plenty of reason to be thankful for having a 
doctor. 
Some people suggest, however, that it makes 
sense to isolate the moral effects of a single 
new trading opportunity or free trade agreement. 
Surely we have fellow citizens who are hurt by 
those agreements, at least in the limited sense 
that they’d be better off in a world where trade 
flourishes, except in this one instance. What do 
we owe those fellow citizens?
One way to think about that is to ask what 
your moral instincts tell you in analogous situ-
ations. Suppose, after years of buying shampoo 
at your local pharmacy, you discover you can 
order the same shampoo for less money on the 
Web. Do you have an obligation to compensate 
your pharmacist? If you move to a cheaper 
apartment, should you compensate your land-
lord? When you eat at McDonald’s, should you 
compensate the owners of the diner next door? 
Public policy should not be designed to advance 
moral instincts that we all reject every day of our 
lives.
In what morally relevant way, then, might 
displaced workers differ from displaced phar-
macists or displaced landlords? You might 
argue that pharmacists and landlords have  
always faced cutthroat competition and 
therefore knew what they were getting into, 
while decades of tariffs and quotas have led 
manufacturing workers to expect a modicum of 
protection. That expectation led them to develop 
certain skills, and now it’s unfair to pull the rug 
out from under them. 
Once again, that argument does not mesh 
with our everyday instincts. For many decades, 
schoolyard bullying has been a profitable occu-
pation. All across America, bullies have built up 
skills so they can take advantage of that oppor-
tunity. If we toughen the rules to make bullying 
unprofitable, must we compensate the bullies?
Bullying and protectionism have a lot in 
common. They both use force (either directly or 
through the power of the law) to enrich someone 
else at your involuntary expense. If you’re forced 
to pay $20 an hour to an  American for goods 
you could have bought from a Mexican for $5 
an hour, you’re being extorted. When a free trade 
agreement allows you to buy from the Mexican 
after all, rejoice in your liberation. ■

textiles to fall, reducing the quantity of textiles produced in Isoland and thus re-
ducing employment in the Isolandian textile industry. Some Isolandian textile 
workers would lose their jobs.
Yet free trade creates jobs at the same time that it destroys them. When Iso-
landians buy textiles from other countries, those countries obtain the resources to 
buy other goods from Isoland. Isolandian workers would move from the textile

industry to those industries in which Isoland has a comparative advantage. The 
transition may impose hardship on some workers in the short run, but it allows 
Isolandians as a whole to enjoy a higher standard of living.
Opponents of trade are often skeptical that trade creates jobs. They might 
respond that everything can be produced more cheaply abroad. Under free trade, 
they might argue, Isolandians could not be profitably employed in any industry. 
As Chapter 3 explains, however, the gains from trade are based on comparative 
advantage, not absolute advantage. Even if one country is better than another 
country at producing everything, each country can still gain from trading with the 
other. Workers in each country will eventually find jobs in an industry in which 
that country has a comparative advantage.
9-3b The National-Security Argument
When an industry is threatened with competition from other countries, oppo-
nents of free trade often argue that the industry is vital to national security. For 
example, if Isoland were considering free trade in steel, domestic steel companies 
might point out that steel is used to make guns and tanks. Free trade would allow 
Isoland to become dependent on foreign countries to supply steel. If a war later 
broke out and the foreign supply was interrupted, Isoland might be unable to 
produce enough steel and weapons to defend itself.
Economists acknowledge that protecting key industries may be appropriate 
when there are legitimate concerns over national security. Yet they fear that this 
argument may be used too quickly by producers eager to gain at consumers’ 
expense. 
One should be wary of the national-security argument when it is made by rep-
resentatives of industry rather than the defense establishment. Companies have 
an incentive to exaggerate their role in national defense to obtain protection from 
foreign competition. A nation’s generals may see things very differently. Indeed, 
when the military is a consumer of an industry’s output, it would benefit from 
imports. Cheaper steel in Isoland, for example, would allow the Isolandian mili-
tary to accumulate a stockpile of weapons at lower cost. 
9-3c The Infant-Industry Argument
New industries sometimes argue for temporary trade restrictions to help them 
get started. After a period of protection, the argument goes, these industries will 
mature and be able to compete with foreign firms. Similarly, older industries 
sometimes argue that they need temporary protection to help them adjust to new 
conditions. 
Economists are often skeptical about such claims, largely because the infant- 
industry argument is difficult to implement in practice. To apply protection suc-
cessfully, the government would need to decide which industries will eventually 
be profitable and decide whether the benefits of establishing these industries 
exceed the costs of this protection to consumers. Yet “picking winners” is extraor-
dinarily difficult. It is made even more difficult by the political process, which  
often awards protection to those industries that are politically powerful. And once 
a powerful industry is protected from foreign competition, the “temporary” pol-
icy is sometimes hard to remove.
In addition, many economists are skeptical about the infant-industry argu-
ment in principle. Suppose, for instance, that an industry is young and unable to 
compete profitably against foreign rivals, but there is reason to believe that the 
industry can be profitable in the long run. In this case, firm owners should be

willing to incur temporary losses to obtain the eventual profits. Protection is not 
necessary for an infant industry to grow. History shows that start-up firms often 
incur temporary losses and succeed in the long run, even without protection from 
competition.
9-3d The Unfair-Competition Argument
A common argument is that free trade is desirable only if all countries play by 
the same rules. If firms in different countries are subject to different laws and 
regulations, then it is unfair (the argument goes) to expect the firms to compete 
in the international marketplace. For instance, suppose that the government of 
Neighborland subsidizes its textile industry by giving textile companies large tax 
breaks. The Isolandian textile industry might argue that it should be protected 
from this foreign competition because Neighborland is not competing fairly.
Would it, in fact, hurt Isoland to buy textiles from another country at a subsi-
dized price? Certainly, Isolandian textile producers would suffer, but Isolandian 
textile consumers would benefit from the low price. The case for free trade is the 
same as before: The gains of the consumers from buying at the low price would 
exceed the losses of the producers. Neighborland’s subsidy to its textile indus-
try may be a bad policy, but it is the taxpayers of Neighborland who bear the 
burden. Isoland can benefit from the opportunity to buy textiles at a subsidized 
price. Rather than objecting to the foreign subsidies, perhaps Isoland should send 
Neighborland a thank-you note.
9-3e The Protection-as-a-Bargaining-Chip Argument
Another argument for trade restrictions concerns the strategy of bargaining. Many 
policymakers claim to support free trade but, at the same time, argue that trade 
restrictions can be useful when we bargain with our trading partners. They claim 
that the threat of a trade restriction can help remove a trade restriction already im-
posed by a foreign government. For example, Isoland might threaten to impose a 
tariff on textiles unless Neighborland removes its tariff on wheat. If Neighborland 
responds to this threat by removing its tariff, the result can be freer trade.
The problem with this bargaining strategy is that the threat may not work. If 
it doesn’t work, the country faces a choice between two bad options. It can carry 
out its threat and implement the trade restriction, which would reduce its own 
economic welfare. Or it can back down from its threat, which would cause it to 
lose prestige in international affairs. Faced with this choice, the country would 
probably wish that it had never made the threat in the first place.
CASE 
STUDY
TRADE AGREEMENTS AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
A country can take one of two approaches to achieving free trade. It 
can take a unilateral approach and remove its trade restrictions on its 
own. This is the approach that Great Britain took in the 19th century 
and that Chile and South Korea have taken in recent years. Alternatively, a coun-
try can take a multilateral approach and reduce its trade restrictions while other 
countries do the same. In other words, it can bargain with its trading partners in 
an attempt to reduce trade restrictions around the world. 
One important example of the multilateral approach is the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which in 1993 lowered trade barriers among the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. Another is the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), which is a continuing series of negotiations among many of the 
world’s countries with the goal of promoting free trade. The United States helped

PART III   MARKETS AND WELFARE
to found GATT after World War II in response to the high tar-
iffs imposed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many 
economists believe that the high tariffs contributed to the world-
wide economic hardship of that period. GATT has successfully  
reduced the average tariff among member countries from about 
40 percent after World War II to about 5 percent today.
The rules established under GATT are now enforced by an 
international institution called the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The WTO was established in 1995 and has its headquar-
ters in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2015, 162 countries have joined 
the organization, accounting for more than 97 percent of world 
trade. The functions of the WTO are to administer trade agree-
ments, provide a forum for negotiations, and handle disputes 
among member countries. 
What are the pros and cons of the multilateral approach to 
free trade? One advantage is that the multilateral approach has 
the potential to result in freer trade than a unilateral approach  
because it can reduce trade restrictions abroad as well as at home. If  
international negotiations fail, however, the result could be more 
restricted trade than under a unilateral approach.
In addition, the multilateral approach may have a political 
advantage. In most markets, producers are fewer and better 
 organized than consumers—and thus wield greater political 
 influence. Reducing the Isolandian tariff on textiles, for example, 
may be politically difficult if considered by itself. The textile com-
panies would oppose free trade, and the buyers of textiles who 
would benefit are so numerous that organizing their support 
would be difficult. Yet suppose that Neighborland promises to  
reduce its tariff on wheat at the same time that Isoland reduces its 
tariff on textiles. In this case, the Isolandian wheat farmers, who 
are also politically powerful, would back the agreement. Thus, 
the multilateral approach to free trade can sometimes win politi-
cal support when a unilateral approach cannot. ●

9-4 Conclusion
Economists and the public often disagree about free trade. In 2015, NBC News 
and The Wall Street Journal asked the American public, “In general, do you think 
that free trade between the United States and foreign countries has helped the 
United States, has hurt the United States, or has not made much of a difference 
either way?” Only 29 percent of those polled said free international trade helped, 
whereas 34 percent thought it hurt. (The rest thought it made no difference or 
were unsure.) By contrast, economists overwhelmingly support free international 
trade. They view free trade as a way of allocating production efficiently and rais-
ing living standards both at home and abroad.

CHAPTER 9   APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Economists view the United States as an ongoing experiment that confirms the 
virtues of free trade. Throughout its history, the United States has allowed unre-
stricted trade among the states, and the country as a whole has benefited from 
the specialization that trade allows. Florida grows oranges, Alaska pumps oil, 
California makes wine, and so on. Americans would not enjoy the high standard 
of living they do today if people could consume only those goods and services 
produced in their own states. The world could similarly benefit from free trade 
among countries.
To better understand economists’ view of trade, let’s continue our parable. 
Suppose that the president of Isoland, after reading the latest poll results, ignores 
the advice of her economics team and decides not to allow free trade in textiles. 
The country remains in the equilibrium without international trade.
Then, one day, some Isolandian inventor discovers a new way to make tex-
tiles at very low cost. The process is quite mysterious, however, and the inventor 
insists on keeping it a secret. What is odd is that the inventor doesn’t need tradi-
tional inputs such as cotton or wool. The only material input he needs is wheat. 
And even more oddly, to manufacture textiles from wheat, he hardly needs any 
labor input at all.
The inventor is hailed as a genius. Because everyone buys clothing, the lower 
cost of textiles allows all Isolandians to enjoy a higher standard of living. Work-
ers who had previously produced textiles experience some hardship when their 
factories close, but they eventually find work in other industries. Some become 
farmers and grow the wheat that the inventor turns into textiles. Others enter new 
industries that emerge as a result of higher Isolandian living standards. Everyone 
understands that the displacement of workers in outmoded industries is an inevi-
table part of technological progress and economic growth. 
After several years, a newspaper reporter decides to investigate this mysteri-
ous new textiles process. She sneaks into the inventor’s factory and learns that 
the inventor is a fraud. The inventor has not been making textiles at all. Instead, 
he has been smuggling wheat abroad in exchange for textiles from other coun-
tries. The only thing that the inventor had discovered was the gains from inter-
national trade.
When the truth is revealed, the government shuts down the inventor’s oper-
ation. The price of textiles rises, and workers return to jobs in textile factories. 
Living standards in Isoland fall back to their former levels. The inventor is jailed 
and held up to public ridicule. After all, he was no inventor. He was just an 
economist.

2. When the nation of Ectenia opens itself to world trade 
in coffee beans, the domestic price of coffee beans 
falls. Which of the following describes the situation?
a. Domestic production of coffee rises, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee importer.
b. Domestic production of coffee rises, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee exporter.
c. Domestic production of coffee falls, and Ectenia 
becomes a coffee importer.
d. Domestic production of coffee falls, and Ectenia

3. When a nation opens itself to trade in a good and be-

a. producer surplus decreases, but consumer surplus 
and total surplus both increase.
b. producer surplus decreases, consumer surplus 
increases, and so the impact on total surplus is 
ambiguous.
c. producer surplus and total surplus increase, but 
consumer surplus decreases.
d. producer surplus, consumer surplus, and total sur-

increase
a. the domestic quantity demanded.
b. the domestic quantity supplied.
c. the quantity imported from abroad.
d. all of the above.
5. Which of the following trade policies would benefit 
producers, hurt consumers, and increase the amount 
of trade?
a. the increase of a tariff in an importing country
b. the reduction of a tariff in an importing country
c. starting to allow trade when the world price is 
greater than the domestic price
d. starting to allow trade when the world price is less 
than the domestic price 
6. The main difference between imposing a tariff and 
handing out licenses under an import quota is that a 
tariff increases
a. consumer surplus.
b. producer surplus.
c. international trade.
d. government revenue.
r The effects of free trade can be determined by com-
paring the domestic price before trade with the world 
price. A low domestic price indicates that the country 
has a comparative advantage in producing the good 
and that the country will become an exporter. A high 
domestic price indicates that the rest of the world has 
a comparative advantage in producing the good and 
that the country will become an importer. 
r When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter 
of a good, producers of the good are better off, and 
consumers of the good are worse off. When a country 
allows trade and becomes an importer of a good, con-
sumers are better off, and producers are worse off. In 
both cases, the gains from trade exceed the losses.
r A tariff—a tax on imports—moves a market closer 
to the equilibrium that would exist without trade 
and, therefore, reduces the gains from trade.  
Although domestic producers are better off and the 
government raises revenue, the losses to consumers 
exceed these gains.
r There are various arguments for restricting trade: 
protecting jobs, defending national security, helping 
infant industries, preventing unfair competition, and 
responding to foreign trade restrictions. Although 
some of these arguments have merit in some cases, 
most economists believe that free trade is usually the 
better policy.

automobiles to protect the U.S. auto industry from 
foreign competition. Assuming that the United States 
is a price taker in the world auto market, show the 
following on a diagram: the change in the quantity of 
imports, the loss to U.S. consumers, the gain to U.S. 
manufacturers, government revenue, and the dead-
weight loss associated with the tariff. The loss to con-
sumers can be decomposed into three pieces: a gain to 
domestic producers, revenue for the government, and 
a deadweight loss. Use your diagram to identify these 
three pieces.
3. When China’s clothing industry expands, the increase 
in world supply lowers the world price of clothing.

you. For each, describe the economic rationale for 
and against these arguments for trade restrictions.
5. The nation of Textilia does not allow imports of 
clothing. In its equilibrium without trade, a T-shirt 
costs $20, and the equilibrium quantity is 3 million 
T-shirts. One day, after reading Adam Smith’s The 
Wealth of Nations while on vacation, the president 
decides to open the Textilian market to international 
trade. The market price of a T-shirt falls to the world 
price of $16. The number of T-shirts consumed in 
Textilia rises to 4 million, while the number of T-shirts 
produced declines to 1 million. 
a. Illustrate the situation just described in a graph. 
Your graph should show all the numbers.

and the quantity produced in Isoland under a tex-

9. Assume the United States is an importer of televisions 
and there are no trade restrictions. U.S. consumers 
buy 1 million televisions per year, of which 400,000 are 
produced domestically and 600,000 are imported. 
a. Suppose that a technological advance among 
 Japanese television manufacturers causes the 
world price of televisions to fall by $100. Draw a 
graph to show how this change affects the welfare 
of U.S. consumers and U.S. producers and how it 
affects total surplus in the United States.
b. After the fall in price, consumers buy 1.2 million 
televisions, of which 200,000 are produced domes-
tically and 1 million are imported. Calculate the 
change in consumer surplus, producer surplus, 
and total surplus from the price reduction.
c. If the government responded by putting a 
$100 tariff on imported televisions, what would 
this do? Calculate the revenue that would be 
raised and the deadweight loss. Would it be a 
good policy from the standpoint of U.S. welfare? 
Who might support the policy? 
d. Suppose that the fall in price is attributable not 
to technological advance but to a $100 per tele-
vision subsidy from the Japanese government to 
Japanese industry. How would this affect your

10. Consider a small country that exports steel. Suppose 
that a “pro-trade” government decides to subsidize 
the export of steel by paying a certain amount for each 
ton sold abroad. How does this export subsidy affect 
the domestic price of steel, the quantity of steel pro-
duced, the quantity of steel consumed, and the quan-
tity of steel exported? How does it affect consumer 
surplus, producer surplus, government revenue, and 
total surplus? Is it a good policy from the standpoint 
of economic efficiency? (Hint: The analysis of an  
export subsidy is similar to the analysis of a tariff.)

irms that make and sell paper also create, as a by-product of the manufactur-

the environment, it raises the population’s risk of cancer, birth defects, and 
other health problems.
Is the production and release of dioxin a problem for society? In Chapters 4

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
metaphor, the “invisible hand” of the marketplace leads self-interested buyers 
and sellers in a market to maximize the total benefit that society derives from 
that market. This insight is the basis for one of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. Should 
we conclude, therefore, that the invisible hand prevents firms in the paper market 
from emitting too much dioxin? 
Markets do many things well, but they do not do everything well. In this 
chapter, we begin our study of another of the Ten Principles of Economics: 
Government action can sometimes improve upon market outcomes. We examine 
why markets sometimes fail to allocate resources efficiently, how government 
policies can potentially improve the market’s allocation, and what kinds of 
policies are likely to work best. 
The market failures examined in this chapter fall under a general category 
called externalities. An externality arises when a person engages in an activity 
that influences the well-being of a bystander but neither pays nor receives 
compensation for that effect. If the impact on the bystander is adverse, it is called 
a negative externality. If it is beneficial, it is called a positive externality. In the 
presence of externalities, society’s interest in a market outcome extends beyond 
the well-being of buyers and sellers who participate in the market to include the 
well-being of bystanders who are affected indirectly. Because buyers and sellers 
neglect the external effects of their actions when deciding how much to demand 
or supply, the market equilibrium is not efficient when there are externalities. That 
is, the equilibrium fails to maximize the total benefit to society as a whole. The 
release of dioxin into the environment, for instance, is a negative externality. Self-
interested paper firms will not consider the full cost of the pollution they create 
in their production process, and consumers of paper will not consider the full 
cost of the pollution they contribute to as a result of their purchasing decisions. 
Therefore, the firms will emit too much pollution unless the government prevents 
or discourages them from doing so.
Externalities come in many varieties, as do the policy responses that try to deal 
with the market failure. Here are some examples:
r The exhaust from automobiles is a negative externality because it creates 
smog that other people have to breathe. Because drivers may ignore this 
 externality when deciding what cars to buy and how much to use them, they 
tend to pollute too much. The federal government addresses this problem 
by setting emission standards for cars. It also taxes gasoline to reduce the 
amount that people drive.
r Restored historic buildings convey a positive externality because people  
who walk or ride by them can enjoy the beauty and sense of history that 
these buildings provide. Building owners do not get the full benefit of res-
toration and, therefore, tend to tear down older buildings too quickly. Many 
local governments respond to this problem by regulating the destruction of 
historic buildings and by providing tax breaks to owners who restore them.
r Barking dogs create a negative externality because neighbors are disturbed 
by the noise. Dog owners do not bear the full cost of the noise and, there-
fore, tend to take too few precautions to prevent their dogs from barking. 
Local governments address this problem by making it illegal to “disturb the 
peace.”
r Research into new technologies provides a positive externality because it cre-
ates knowledge that other people can use. If individual inventors, firms, and

CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
universities cannot capture the benefits of their inventions, they will devote 
too few resources to research. The federal government addresses this prob-
lem partially through the patent system, which gives inventors exclusive use 
of their inventions for a limited time.
In each of these cases, some decision maker fails to take into account the  external 
effects of his behavior. The government responds by trying to influence this 
 behavior to protect the interests of bystanders.
10-1 Externalities and Market Inefficiency
In this section, we use the tools of welfare economics developed in Chapter 7 to 
examine how externalities affect economic well-being. The analysis shows pre-
cisely why externalities cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently. Later in 
the chapter, we examine various ways private individuals and public policymak-
ers can remedy this type of market failure.
10-1a Welfare Economics: A Recap
We begin by recalling the key lessons of welfare economics from Chapter 7. To 
make our analysis concrete, we consider a specific market—the market for alumi-
num. Figure 1 shows the supply and demand curves in the market for aluminum. 
Recall from Chapter 7 that the supply and demand curves contain important 
information about costs and benefits. The demand curve for aluminum reflects 
the value of aluminum to consumers, as measured by the prices they are willing 
to pay. At any given quantity, the height of the demand curve shows the will-
ingness to pay of the marginal buyer. In other words, it shows the value to the 
consumer of the last unit of aluminum bought. Similarly, the supply curve reflects 
the costs of producing aluminum. At any given quantity, the height of the supply 
curve shows the cost to the marginal seller. In other words, it shows the cost to the 
producer of the last unit of aluminum sold.
FIGURE 1
The Market for Aluminum
The demand curve reflects the value  
to buyers, and the supply curve reflects 
the costs of sellers. The equilibrium 
quantity, QMARKET, maximizes the total 
value to buyers minus the total costs of 
sellers. In the absence of externalities, 
therefore, the market equilibrium is 
efficient.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
In the absence of government intervention, the price adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for aluminum. The quantity produced and consumed in 
the market equilibrium, shown as QMARKET in Figure 1, is efficient in the sense 
that it maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. That is, the market 
 allocates resources in a way that maximizes the total value to the consumers who 
buy and use aluminum minus the total costs to the producers who make and sell 
aluminum.
10-1b Negative Externalities
Now let’s suppose that aluminum factories emit pollution: For each unit of alu-
minum produced, a certain amount of smoke enters the atmosphere. Because this 
smoke creates a health risk for those who breathe the air, it is a negative externality. 
How does this externality affect the efficiency of the market outcome?
Because of the externality, the cost to society of producing aluminum is larger 
than the cost to the aluminum producers. For each unit of aluminum produced, 
the social cost includes the private costs of the aluminum producers plus the costs 
to those bystanders affected adversely by the pollution. Figure 2 shows the  social 
cost of producing aluminum. The social-cost curve is above the supply curve 
because it takes into account the external costs imposed on society by aluminum 
production. The difference between these two curves reflects the cost of the pollu-
tion emitted.
What quantity of aluminum should be produced? To answer this question, 
we once again consider what a benevolent social planner would do. The planner 
wants to maximize the total surplus derived from the market—the value to con-
sumers of aluminum minus the cost of producing aluminum. The planner under-
stands, however, that the cost of producing aluminum includes the external costs 
of the pollution.
“All I can say is that  
if being a leading  
manufacturer means  
being a leading polluter, 
so be it.”

FIGURE 2
Pollution and the  
Social Optimum
In the presence of a  
negative externality, such  
as pollution, the social cost 
of the good exceeds the 
private cost. The optimal 
quantity, QOPTIMUM, is  
therefore smaller than 
the equilibrium quantity, 
QMARKET.

CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
The planner would choose the level of aluminum production at which the 
 demand curve crosses the social-cost curve. This intersection determines the 
 optimal amount of aluminum from the standpoint of society as a whole. Below 
this level of production, the value of the aluminum to consumers (as measured 
by the height of the demand curve) exceeds the social cost of producing it (as 
measured by the height of the social-cost curve). Above this level of production, 
the social cost of producing additional aluminum exceeds the value to consumers.
Note that the equilibrium quantity of aluminum, QMARKET, is larger than the 
socially optimal quantity, QOPTIMUM. This inefficiency occurs because the market 
equilibrium reflects only the private costs of production. In the market equilib-
rium, the marginal consumer values aluminum at less than the social cost of pro-
ducing it. That is, at QMARKET, the demand curve lies below the social-cost curve. 
Thus, reducing aluminum production and consumption below the market equi-
librium level raises total economic well-being.
How can the social planner achieve the optimal outcome? One way would be 
to tax aluminum producers for each ton of aluminum sold. The tax would shift 
the supply curve for aluminum upward by the size of the tax. If the tax accu-
rately reflected the external cost of pollutants released into the atmosphere, the 
new supply curve would coincide with the social-cost curve. In the new market 
equilibrium, aluminum producers would produce the socially optimal quantity of 
aluminum. 
The use of such a tax is called internalizing the externality because it gives 
buyers and sellers in the market an incentive to take into account the external 
effects of their actions. Aluminum producers would, in essence, take the costs of 
pollution into account when deciding how much aluminum to supply because 
the tax would make them pay for these external costs. And, because the market 
price would reflect the tax on producers, consumers of aluminum would have an 
incentive to buy a smaller quantity. The policy is based on one of the Ten Principles 
of Economics: People respond to incentives. Later in this chapter, we consider in 
more detail how policymakers can deal with externalities.
10-1c Positive Externalities
Although some activities impose costs on third parties, others yield benefits. 
Consider education, for example. To a large extent, the benefit of education is 
private: The consumer of education becomes a more productive worker and thus 
reaps much of the benefit in the form of higher wages. Beyond these private ben-
efits, however, education also yields positive externalities. One externality is that 
a more educated population leads to more informed voters, which means better 
government for everyone. Another externality is that a more educated population 
tends to result in lower crime rates. A third externality is that a more educated 
population may encourage the development and dissemination of technologi-
cal advances, leading to higher productivity and wages for everyone. Because of 
these three positive externalities, a person may prefer to have neighbors who are 
well educated. 
The analysis of positive externalities is similar to the analysis of negative 
 externalities. As Figure 3 shows, the demand curve does not reflect the value to 
society of the good. Because the social value is greater than the private value, the 
social-value curve lies above the demand curve. The optimal quantity is found 
where the social-value curve and the supply curve intersect. Hence, the socially 
optimal quantity is greater than the quantity that the private market would natu-
rally reach on its own.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Once again, the government can correct the market failure by inducing market 
participants to internalize the externality. The appropriate response in the case of 
positive externalities is exactly the opposite to the case of negative externalities. To 
move the market equilibrium closer to the social optimum, a positive externality 
requires a subsidy. In fact, that is exactly the policy the government follows: Edu-
cation is heavily subsidized through public schools and government scholarships.
To summarize: Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than 
is socially desirable. Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than 
is socially desirable. To remedy the problem, the government can internalize the exter-
nality by taxing goods that have negative externalities and subsidizing goods that have 
positive externalities.
CASE 
STUDY
TECHNOLOGY SPILLOVERS, INDUSTRIAL POLICY,  
AND PATENT PROTECTION
A potentially important type of positive externality is called a tech-
nology spillover—the impact of one firm’s research and production 
efforts on other firms’ access to technological advance. For example, consider the 
market for industrial robots. Robots are at the frontier of a rapidly changing tech-
nology. Whenever a firm builds a robot, there is some chance that the firm will 
discover a new and better design. This new design may benefit not only this firm 
but also society as a whole because the design will enter society’s pool of tech-
nological knowledge. That is, the new design may have positive externalities for 
other producers in the economy.
In this case, the government can internalize the externality by subsidizing the 
production of robots. If the government paid firms a subsidy for each robot pro-
duced, the supply curve would shift down by the amount of the subsidy, and this 
shift would increase the equilibrium quantity of robots. To ensure that the market 
equilibrium equals the social optimum, the subsidy should equal the value of the 
technology spillover.
FIGURE 3
Education and the

In the presence of a

The optimal quantity,

CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
How large are technology spillovers, and what do they imply for public policy? 
This is an important question because technological progress is the key to raising 
living standards over time. Yet it is also a difficult question about which economists 
often disagree. 
Some economists believe that technology spillovers are pervasive and that the 
government should encourage those industries that yield the largest spillovers. For 
instance, these economists argue that if making computer chips yields greater spill-
overs than making potato chips, the government should encourage the production 
of computer chips relative to the production of potato chips. The U.S. tax code does 
this in a limited way by offering special tax breaks for expenditures on research 
and development. Some nations go further by subsidizing specific industries that 
supposedly yield large technology spillovers. Government intervention that aims 
to promote technology-enhancing industries is sometimes called industrial policy. 
Other economists are skeptical about industrial policy. Even if technology spill-
overs are common, pursuing an industrial policy requires the government to gauge 
the size of the spillovers from different markets. This measurement problem is 
difficult at best. Without accurate measurements, the political system may end up 
subsidizing industries with the most political clout rather than those that yield the 
largest positive externalities.
Another way to deal with technology spillovers is patent protection. The pat-
ent laws protect the rights of inventors by giving them exclusive use of their 
 inventions for a period of time. When a firm makes a technological break-
through, it can patent the idea and capture much of the economic benefit for 
itself. The patent internalizes the externality by giving the firm a property right 
over its invention. If other firms want to use the new technology, they have to 
obtain permission from the inventing firm and pay it a royalty. Thus, the patent 
system gives firms a greater incentive to engage in research and other activities 
that  advance technology. ●
QuickQuiz
Give an example of a negative externality and a positive externality. Explain 
why market outcomes are inefficient in the presence of these externalities.
10-2 Public Policies toward Externalities 
We have discussed why externalities lead markets to allocate resources ineffi-
ciently but have mentioned only briefly how this inefficiency can be remedied. In 
practice, both public policymakers and private individuals respond to externali-
ties in various ways. All of the remedies share the goal of moving the allocation of 
resources closer to the social optimum. 
This section considers governmental solutions. As a general matter, the govern-
ment can respond to externalities in one of two ways. Command-and-control policies 
regulate behavior directly. Market-based policies provide incentives so that private 
decision makers will choose to solve the problem on their own.
10-2a Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation
The government can remedy an externality by either requiring or forbidding cer-
tain behaviors. For example, it is a crime to dump poisonous chemicals into the 
water supply. In this case, the external costs to society far exceed the benefits to 
the polluter. The government therefore institutes a command-and-control policy 
that prohibits this act altogether. 

196
PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
In most cases of pollution, however, the situation is not this 
simple. Despite the stated goals of some environmentalists, 
it would be impossible to prohibit all polluting activity. For 
example, virtually all forms of transportation—even the horse—
produce some undesirable polluting by-products. But it would 
not be sensible for the government to ban all transportation. As a 
result, instead of trying to eradicate pollution entirely, society has 
to weigh the costs and benefits to decide the kinds and quantities 
of pollution it will allow. In the United States, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) is the government agency tasked with 
developing and enforcing regulations aimed at protecting the 
environment. 
Environmental regulations can take many forms. Sometimes 
the EPA dictates a maximum level of pollution that a factory may 
emit. Other times the EPA requires that firms adopt a particular 
technology to reduce emissions. In all cases, to design good rules, 
the government regulators need to know the details about spe-
cific industries and about the alternative technologies that those 
industries could adopt. This information is often difficult for gov-
ernment regulators to obtain.

Instead of regulating behavior in response to an externality, 
the government can use market-based policies to align private 
incentives with social efficiency. For instance, as we saw earlier, 
the government can internalize the externality by taxing activities 
that have negative externalities and subsidizing activities that 
have positive externalities. Taxes enacted to deal with the effects 
of negative externalities are called corrective taxes. They are also 
called Pigovian taxes after economist Arthur Pigou (1877–1959), an 
early advocate of their use. An ideal corrective tax would equal 
the external cost from an activity with negative externalities, and 
an ideal corrective subsidy would equal the external benefit from 
an activity with positive externalities.
Economists usually prefer corrective taxes to regulations as a 
way to deal with pollution because they can reduce pollution at a 
lower cost to society. To see why, let us consider an example. 
Suppose that two factories—a paper mill and a steel mill—are each dumping 
500 tons of glop into a river every year. The EPA decides that it wants to reduce 
the amount of pollution. It considers two solutions:
r Regulation: The EPA could tell each factory to reduce its pollution to 300 tons 
of glop per year.
r Corrective tax: The EPA could levy a tax on each factory of $50,000 for each 
ton of glop it emits. 
The regulation would dictate a level of pollution, whereas the tax would give fac-
tory owners an economic incentive to reduce pollution. Which solution do you 
think is better?
corrective tax
a tax designed to induce 
private decision makers 
to take into account 
the social costs that 
arise from a negative 
externality 
“Declining to be vaccinated against contagious diseases such 
as measles imposes costs on other people, which is a negative 
externality.”
“Considering the costs of restricting free choice, and the share 
of people in the US who choose not to vaccinate their children for 
measles, the social benefit of mandating measles vaccines for all 
Americans (except those with compelling medical reasons) would 
exceed the social cost.”

CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
Most economists prefer the tax. To explain this preference, they would first 
point out that a tax is just as effective as regulation in reducing the overall level of 
pollution. The EPA can achieve whatever level of pollution it wants by setting the 
tax at the appropriate level. The higher the tax, the larger the reduction in pollu-
tion. If the tax is high enough, the factories will close down altogether, reducing 
pollution to zero. 
Although regulation and corrective taxes are both capable of reducing pollu-
tion, the tax accomplishes this goal more efficiently. The regulation requires each 
factory to reduce pollution by the same amount. An equal reduction, however, 
is not necessarily the least expensive way to clean up the water. It is possible 
that the paper mill can reduce pollution at lower cost than the steel mill. If so, 
the paper mill would respond to the tax by reducing pollution substantially to 
avoid the tax, whereas the steel mill would respond by reducing pollution less 
and paying the tax. 
In essence, the corrective tax places a price on the right to pollute. Just as 
markets allocate goods to those buyers who value them most highly, a correc-
tive tax allocates pollution to those factories that face the highest cost of reduc-
ing it. Thus, the EPA can achieve any level of pollution at the lowest total cost by 
using a tax.
Economists also argue that corrective taxes are better for the environment. 
Under the command-and-control policy of regulation, the factories have no rea-
son to reduce emission further once they have reached the target of 300 tons 
of glop. By contrast, the tax gives the factories an incentive to develop cleaner 
technologies because a cleaner technology would reduce the amount of tax the 
factory has to pay.
Corrective taxes are unlike most other taxes. As we discussed in Chapter 8, 
most taxes distort incentives and move the allocation of resources away from the 
social optimum. The reduction in economic well-being—that is, in consumer and 
producer surplus—exceeds the amount of revenue the government raises, result-
ing in a deadweight loss. By contrast, when externalities are present, society also 
cares about the well-being of the affected bystanders. Corrective taxes alter incen-
tives that market participants face to account for the presence of externalities and 
thereby move the allocation of resources closer to the social optimum. Thus, while 
corrective taxes raise revenue for the government, they also enhance economic 
efficiency.

WHY IS GASOLINE TAXED SO HEAVILY?
In many nations, gasoline is among the most heavily taxed goods. 
The gas tax can be viewed as a corrective tax aimed at addressing 
three negative externalities associated with driving:
r Congestion: If you have ever been stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, you 
have probably wished that there were fewer cars on the road. A gasoline tax 
keeps congestion down by encouraging people to take public transportation, 
carpool more often, and live closer to work. 
r Accidents: Whenever people buy large cars or sport utility vehicles, they 
may make themselves safer but they certainly put their neighbors at risk. 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a person 
driving a typical car is five times as likely to die if hit by a sport utility 
vehicle than if hit by another car. The gas tax is an indirect way of making

people pay when their large, gas-guzzling vehicles impose risk on others. 
It would induce them to take this risk into account when choosing what 
vehicle to purchase.
r Pollution: Cars cause smog. Moreover, the burning of fossil fuels such as 
 gasoline is widely believed to be the primary cause of global warming.  
Experts disagree about how dangerous this threat is, but there is no doubt 
that the gas tax reduces the threat by discouraging the use of gasoline.
So the gas tax, rather than causing deadweight losses like most taxes, actually 
makes the economy work better. It means less traffic congestion, safer roads, and 
a cleaner environment.
How high should the tax on gasoline be? Most European countries impose gas-
oline taxes that are much higher than those in the United States. Many observers 
have suggested that the United States should also tax gasoline more heavily. A 
2007 study published in the Journal of Economic Literature summarized the research 
on the size of the various externalities associated with driving. It concluded that 
the optimal corrective tax on gasoline was $2.28 per gallon in 2005 dollars; af-
ter adjusting for inflation, that amount is equivalent to about $2.78 per gallon in  
2015 dollars. By contrast, the actual tax in the United States in 2015 was only about 
50 cents per gallon.
The tax revenue from a gasoline tax could be used to lower taxes that distort 
incentives and cause deadweight losses, such as income taxes. In addition, some of 
the burdensome government regulations that require automakers to produce more 
fuel-efficient cars would prove unnecessary. This idea, however, has never been  
politically popular. ●

CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
Many policy analysts believe that taxing 
carbon is the best approach to dealing 
with global climate change.
The Most Sensible Tax of All
By Yoram Bauman and Shi-Ling Hsu
O
n Sunday, the best climate policy in the 
world got even better: British Columbia’s 
carbon tax—a tax on the carbon content of all 
fossil fuels burned in the province—increased 
from $25 to $30 per metric ton of carbon diox-
ide, making it more expensive to pollute. 
This was good news not only for the 
 environment but for nearly everyone who pays 
taxes in British Columbia, because the carbon 
tax is used to reduce taxes for individuals and 
businesses. Thanks to this tax swap, British 
Columbia has lowered its corporate income tax 
rate to 10 percent from 12 percent, a rate that 
is among the lowest in the Group of 8 wealthy  
nations. Personal income taxes for people earn-
ing less than $119,000 per year are now the low-
est in Canada, and there are targeted  rebates 
for low-income and rural households. 
The only bad news is that this is the last 
increase scheduled in British Columbia. In our 
view, the reason is simple: the province is wait-
ing for the rest of North America to catch up so 
that its tax system will not become unbalanced 
or put energy-intensive industries at a competi-
tive disadvantage. 
The United States should jump at the chance 
to adopt a similar revenue-neutral tax swap. It’s 
an opportunity to reduce existing taxes, clean up 
the environment and increase personal freedom 
and energy security. 
Let’s start with the economics. Substituting 
a carbon tax for some of our current taxes—on 
payroll, on investment, on businesses and on 
workers—is a no-brainer. Why tax good things 
when you can tax bad things, like emissions? 
The idea has support from economists across 
the political spectrum, from Arthur B. Laffer 
and N. Gregory Mankiw on the right to Peter 
Orszag and Joseph E. Stiglitz on the left. That’s 
because economists know that a carbon tax 
swap can reduce the economic drag created by 
our current tax system and increase long-run 
growth by nudging the economy away from con-
sumption and borrowing and toward saving and 
investment. 
Of course, carbon taxes also lower car-
bon emissions. Economic theory suggests that 
putting a price on pollution reduces emissions 
more affordably and more effectively than any 
other measure. This conclusion is supported by 
 empirical evidence from previous market-based 
policies, like those in the 1990 amendments to 
the Clean Air Act that targeted sulfur dioxide 
emissions. British Columbia’s carbon tax is only 
four years old, but preliminary data show that 
greenhouse gas emissions are down 4.5 percent 
even as population and gross domestic product 
have been growing. Sales of motor gasoline have 
fallen by 2 percent since 2007, compared with a 
5 percent increase for Canada as a whole. 
What would a British Columbia-style carbon 
tax look like in the United States? According 
to our calculations, a British Columbia-style  
$30 carbon tax would generate about $145 billion 
a year in the United States. That could be used 
to reduce individual and corporate income taxes 
by 10 percent, and afterward there would still be 
$35 billion left over. If recent budget deals are 
any guide, Congress might choose to set aside 
half of that remainder to reduce estate taxes (to 
please Republicans) and the other half to offset 
the impacts of higher fuel and electricity prices 
resulting from the carbon tax on low-income 
households through refundable tax credits or 
a targeted reduction in payroll taxes (to please 
Democrats). 
Revenue from a carbon tax would most likely 
decline over time as Americans reduce their 
carbon emissions, but for many years to come 
it could pay for big reductions in existing taxes. 
It would also promote energy conservation and 
steer investment into clean technology and other 
productive economic activities. 
Lastly, the carbon tax would actually give 
Americans more control over how much they pay 
in taxes. Households and businesses could reduce 
their carbon tax payments simply by reducing 
their use of fossil fuels. Americans would trim 
their carbon footprints—and their tax  burdens—
by investing in energy efficiency at home and at 
work, switching to less- polluting vehicles and 
pursuing countless other innovations. All of this 
would be driven not by government mandates but 
by Adam Smith’s invisible hand. 
A carbon tax makes sense whether you are 
a Republican or a Democrat, a climate change 
skeptic or a believer, a conservative or a conser-
vationist (or both). We can move past the par-
tisan fireworks over global warming by turning 
British Columbia’s carbon tax into a made-in-
America solution. ■

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
10-2c  Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable  
Pollution Permits
Returning to our example of the paper mill and the steel mill, 
let us suppose that, despite the advice of its economists, the EPA 
adopts the regulation and requires each factory to reduce its pol-
lution to 300 tons of glop per year. Then one day, after the regu-
lation is in place and both mills have complied, the two firms go 
to the EPA with a proposal. The steel mill wants to increase its 
emission of glop from 300 to 400 tons. The paper mill has agreed 
to reduce its emission from 300 to 200 tons if the steel mill pays it 
$5 million. The total emission of glop would remain at 600 tons. 
Should the EPA allow the two factories to make this deal?
From the standpoint of economic efficiency, allowing the deal 
is good policy. The deal must make the owners of the two facto-
ries better off because they are voluntarily agreeing to it. More-
over, the deal does not have any external effects because the 
total amount of pollution stays the same. Thus, social welfare is  
enhanced by allowing the paper mill to sell its pollution rights to 
the steel mill.
The same logic applies to any voluntary transfer of the right to 
pollute from one firm to another. If the EPA allows firms to make 
these deals, it will, in essence, create a new scarce resource: pol-
lution permits. A market to trade these permits will eventually 
 develop, and that market will be governed by the forces of supply 
and demand. The invisible hand will ensure that this new market 
allocates the right to pollute efficiently. That is, the permits will 
end up in the hands of those firms that value them most highly, 
as judged by their willingness to pay. A firm’s willingness to pay 
for the right to pollute, in turn, will depend on its cost of reducing 
pollution: The more costly it is for a firm to cut back on pollution, 
the more it will be willing to pay for a permit.
An advantage of allowing a market for pollution permits is 
that the initial allocation of pollution permits among firms does 
not matter from the standpoint of economic efficiency. Those 
firms that can reduce pollution at a low cost will sell whatever 
permits they get, while firms that can reduce pollution only at a 
high cost will buy whatever permits they need. As long as there 
is a free market for the pollution rights, the final allocation will 
be efficient regardless of the initial allocation.
Reducing pollution using pollution permits may seem very 
different from using corrective taxes, but the two policies have 
much in common. In both cases, firms pay for their pollution. With corrective 
taxes, polluting firms must pay a tax to the government. With pollution permits, 
polluting firms must pay to buy the permits. (Even firms that already own per-
mits must pay to  pollute: The opportunity cost of polluting is what they could 
have received by selling their permits on the open market.) Both corrective taxes 
and pollution permits internalize the externality of pollution by making it costly 
for firms to pollute.
The similarity of the two policies can be seen by considering the market for 
pollution. Both panels in Figure 4 show the demand curve for the right to pollute. 
“The Brookings Institution recently described a U.S. carbon tax 
of $20 per ton, increasing at 4 percent per year, which would 
raise an estimated $150 billion per year in federal revenues 
over the next decade. Given the negative externalities created 
by carbon dioxide emissions, a federal carbon tax at this rate 
would involve fewer harmful net distortions to the U.S. economy 
than a tax increase that generated the same revenue by raising 
marginal tax rates on labor income across the board.”
“A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expen-
sive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a 
collection of policies such as ‘corporate average fuel economy’ 
requirements for automobiles.”

CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
This curve shows that the lower the price of polluting, the more firms will choose 
to pollute. In panel (a), the EPA uses a corrective tax to set a price for pollution. 
In this case, the supply curve for pollution rights is perfectly elastic (because 
firms can pollute as much as they want by paying the tax), and the position of the 
demand curve determines the quantity of pollution. In panel (b), the EPA sets a 
quantity of pollution by issuing pollution permits. In this case, the supply curve 
for pollution rights is perfectly inelastic (because the quantity of pollution is fixed 
by the number of permits), and the position of the demand curve determines the 
price of pollution. Hence, the EPA can achieve any point on a given demand curve 
either by setting a price with a corrective tax or by setting a quantity with pollu-
tion permits.
In some circumstances, however, selling pollution permits may be better than 
levying a corrective tax. Suppose the EPA wants no more than 600 tons of glop 
dumped into the river. But because the EPA does not know the demand curve 
for pollution, it is not sure what size tax would achieve that goal. In this case, it 
can simply auction off 600 pollution permits. The auction price would yield the 
appropriate size of the corrective tax.
The idea of the government auctioning off the right to pollute may at first 
sound like a creature of some economist’s imagination. And in fact, that is how 
the idea began. But increasingly, the EPA has used this system as a way to control 
pollution. A notable success story has been the case of sulfur dioxide (SO2), a lead-
ing cause of acid rain. In 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act required power 
plants to reduce SO2 emissions substantially. At the same time, the amendments

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
set up a system that allowed plants to trade their SO2 allowances. Initially, both 
industry representatives and environmentalists were skeptical of the proposal, 
but over time the system reduced pollution with minimal disruption. Pollution 
permits, like corrective taxes, are now widely viewed as a cost-effective way to 
keep the environment clean.
10-2d Objections to the Economic Analysis of Pollution
“We cannot give anyone the option of polluting for a fee.” This comment from the 
late Senator Edmund Muskie reflects the view of some environmentalists. Clean 
air and clean water, they argue, are fundamental human rights that should not 
be debased by considering them in economic terms. How can you put a price on 
clean air and clean water? The environment is so important, they claim, that we 
should protect it as much as possible, regardless of the cost.
Economists have little sympathy for this type of argument. To economists, good 
environmental policy begins by acknowledging the first of the Ten  Principles of 
Economics in Chapter 1: People face trade-offs. Certainly, clean air and clean  water 
have value. But their value must be compared to their opportunity cost—that is, 
to what one must give up to obtain them. Eliminating all pollution is impossi-
ble. Trying to eliminate all pollution would reverse many of the technological 
advances that allow us to enjoy a high standard of living. Few people would be 
willing to accept poor nutrition, inadequate medical care, or shoddy housing to 
make the environment as clean as possible.
Economists argue that some environmental activists hurt their own cause by 
not thinking in economic terms. A clean environment can be viewed as simply 
 another good. Like all normal goods, it has a positive income elasticity: Rich 
countries can afford a cleaner environment than poor ones and, therefore, usually 
have more rigorous environmental protection. In addition, like most other goods, 
clean air and clean water obey the law of demand: The lower the price of environ-
mental protection, the more the public will want. The economic approach of using 
pollution permits and corrective taxes reduces the cost of environmental protec-
tion and should, therefore, increase the public’s demand for a clean environment.

10-3 Private Solutions to Externalities
Although externalities tend to cause markets to be inefficient, government action 
is not always needed to solve the problem. In some circumstances, people can 
develop private solutions.
10-3a The Types of Private Solutions
Sometimes the problem of externalities is solved with moral codes and social sanc-
tions. Consider, for instance, why most people do not litter. Although there are 
laws against littering, these laws are not rigorously enforced. Most people choose 
not to litter just because it is the wrong thing to do. The Golden Rule taught to 
most children says, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” This 
moral injunction tells us to take account of how our actions affect other people. In 
economic terms, it tells us to internalize externalities.

203
CHAPTER 10   EXTERNALITIES
Another private solution to externalities involves charities. For example, the 
Sierra Club, whose goal is to protect the environment, is a nonprofit organiza-
tion funded with private donations. As another example, colleges and universities 
receive gifts from alumni, corporations, and foundations in part because educa-
tion has positive externalities for society. The government encourages this private 
solution to externalities through the tax system by allowing an income tax deduc-
tion for charitable donations.
The private market can often solve the problem of externalities by relying on 
the self-interest of the relevant parties. Sometimes the solution takes the form of 
integrating different types of businesses. For example, consider an apple grower 
and a beekeeper who are located next to each other. Each business confers a posi-
tive externality on the other: By pollinating the flowers on the trees, the bees help 
the orchard produce apples, while the bees use the nectar they get from the  apple 
trees to produce honey. Nonetheless, when the apple grower is deciding how 
many trees to plant and the beekeeper is deciding how many bees to keep, they 
neglect the positive externality. As a result, the apple grower plants too few trees 
and the beekeeper keeps too few bees. These externalities could be internalized 
if the beekeeper bought the apple orchard or if the apple grower bought the bee-
hives: Both activities would then take place within the same firm, and this single 
firm could choose the optimal number of trees and bees. Internalizing external-
ities is one reason that some firms are involved in multiple types of businesses.
Another way for the private market to deal with external effects is for the inter-
ested parties to enter into a contract. In the foregoing example, a contract between 
the apple grower and the beekeeper can solve the problem of too few trees and 
too few bees. The contract can specify the number of trees, the number of bees, 
and perhaps a payment from one party to the other. By setting the right number 
of trees and bees, the contract can solve the inefficiency that normally arises from 
these externalities and make both parties better off.
10-3b The Coase Theorem
How effective is the private market in dealing with externalities? A famous result, 
called the Coase theorem after economist Ronald Coase, suggests that it can be 
very effective in some circumstances. According to the Coase theorem, if private 
parties can bargain over the allocation of resources at no cost, then the private mar-
ket will always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources efficiently.
To see how the Coase theorem works, consider an example. Suppose that Dick 
owns a dog named Spot. Spot barks and disturbs Jane, Dick’s neighbor. Dick gets 
a benefit from owning the dog, but the dog confers a negative externality on Jane. 
Should Dick be forced to send Spot to the pound, or should Jane have to suffer 
sleepless nights because of Spot’s barking?
Consider first what outcome is socially efficient. A social planner, considering 
the two alternatives, would compare the benefit that Dick gets from the dog to 
the cost that Jane bears from the barking. If the benefit exceeds the cost, it is effi-
cient for Dick to keep the dog and for Jane to live with the barking. Yet if the cost 
 exceeds the benefit, then Dick should get rid of the dog.
According to the Coase theorem, the private market will reach the efficient out-
come on its own. How? Jane can simply offer to pay Dick to get rid of the dog. 
Dick will accept the deal if the amount of money Jane offers is greater than the 
benefit of keeping the dog.
By bargaining over the price, Dick and Jane can always reach the efficient out-
come. For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $500 benefit from the dog and Jane

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this case, Jane can offer Dick $600 to get rid 
of the dog, and Dick will gladly accept. Both parties are better off than they were 
before, and the efficient outcome is reached.
It is possible, of course, that Jane would not be willing to offer any price that 
Dick would accept. For instance, suppose that Dick gets a $1,000 benefit from the 
dog and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. In this case, Dick would turn 
down any offer below $1,000, while Jane would not offer any amount above $800. 
Therefore, Dick ends up keeping the dog. Given these costs and benefits, how-
ever, this outcome is efficient.
So far, we have assumed that Dick has the legal right to keep a barking dog. 
In other words, we have assumed that Dick can keep Spot unless Jane pays him 
enough to induce him to give up the dog voluntarily. But how different would the 
outcome be if Jane had the legal right to peace and quiet?
According to the Coase theorem, the initial distribution of rights does not mat-
ter for the market’s ability to reach the efficient outcome. For instance, suppose 
that Jane can legally compel Dick to get rid of the dog. Having this right works to 
Jane’s advantage, but it probably will not change the outcome. In this case, Dick 
can offer to pay Jane to allow him to keep the dog. If the benefit of the dog to Dick 
exceeds the cost of the barking to Jane, then Dick and Jane will strike a bargain in 
which Dick keeps the dog.
Although Dick and Jane can reach the efficient outcome regardless of how 
rights are initially distributed, the distribution of rights is not irrelevant: It 
 determines the distribution of economic well-being. Whether Dick has the right 
to a barking dog or Jane the right to peace and quiet determines who pays whom 
in the final bargain. But in either case, the two parties can bargain with each other 
and solve the externality problem. Dick will end up keeping the dog only if his 
benefit exceeds Jane’s cost.
To sum up: The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve 
the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the initial distribution of rights, 
the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome 
is efficient. 
10-3c Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work
Despite the appealing logic of the Coase theorem, private individuals on their 
own often fail to resolve the problems caused by externalities. The Coase theorem 
applies only when the interested parties have no trouble reaching and enforcing 
an agreement. In the real world, however, bargaining does not always work, even 
when a mutually beneficial agreement is possible.
Sometimes the interested parties fail to solve an externality problem because 
of transaction costs, the costs that parties incur in the process of agreeing to and 
following through on a bargain. In our example, imagine that Dick and Jane speak 
different languages so that, to reach an agreement, they need to hire a translator. 
If the benefit of solving the barking problem is less than the cost of the transla-
tor, Dick and Jane might choose to leave the problem unsolved. In more realistic 
examples, the transaction costs are the expenses not of translators but of lawyers 
required to draft and enforce contracts.
At other times, bargaining simply breaks down. The recurrence of wars and 
 labor strikes shows that reaching agreement can be difficult and that failing to reach 
agreement can be costly. The problem is often that each party tries to hold out for a 
better deal. For example, suppose that Dick gets a $500 benefit from having the dog 
and Jane bears an $800 cost from the barking. Although it is efficient for Jane to pay 
transaction costs
the costs that parties  
incur during the process 
of agreeing to and follow-
ing through on a bargain

Don’t Want Me to Recline My  
Airline Seat? You Can Pay Me
By Josh Barro
I 
fly a lot. When I fly, I recline. I don’t feel guilty 
about it. And I’m going to keep doing it, unless 
you pay me to stop.
I bring this up because of a dispute you 
may have heard about: On Sunday, a United 
Airlines flight from Newark to Denver made an 
unscheduled stop in Chicago to discharge two 
passengers who had a dispute over seat reclin-
ing. According to The Associated Press, a man 
in a middle seat installed the Knee Defender, a 
$21.95 device that keeps a seat upright, on the 
seatback in front of him.
A flight attendant asked him to remove the 
device. He refused. The woman seated in front of 
him turned around and threw water at him. The 
pilot landed the plane and booted both passen-
gers off the flight.
Obviously, it’s improper to throw water 
at another passenger on a flight, even if he 
 deserves it. But I’ve seen a distressing amount 
of sympathy for Mr. Knee Defender, who wasn’t 
just instigating a fight but usurping his fellow 
passenger’s property rights. When you buy an 
airline ticket, one of the things you’re buying is 
the right to use your seat’s reclining function. If 
this passenger so badly wanted the passenger 
in front of him not to recline, he should have 
paid her to give up that right.
I wrote an article to that effect in 2011, not-
ing that airline seats are an excellent case study 
for the Coase Theorem. This is an economic theory 
holding that it doesn’t matter very much who is ini-
tially given a property right; so long as you clearly 
define it and transaction costs are low, people will 
trade the right so that it ends up in the hands of 
whoever values it most. That is, I own the right to 
recline, and if my reclining bothers you, you can pay 
me to stop. We could (but don’t) have an alterna-
tive system in which the passenger sitting behind 
me owns the reclining rights. In that circumstance, 
if I really care about being allowed to recline, I 
could pay him to let me.
Donald Marron, a former director of the Con-
gressional Budget Office, agrees with this anal-
ysis, but with a caveat. Recline negotiations do 
involve some transaction costs — passengers 
don’t like bargaining over reclining positions 
with their neighbors, perhaps because that 
sometimes ends with water being thrown in 
someone’s face.
Mr. Marron says we ought to allocate the 
initial property right to the person likely to 
care most about reclining, in order to reduce 
the number of transactions that are necessary. 
He further argues that it’s probably the person 
sitting behind, as evidenced by the fact people 
routinely pay for extra-legroom seats.
Mr. Marron is wrong about this last point. I 
understand people don’t like negotiating with 
strangers, but in hundreds of flights I have 
taken, I have rarely had anyone complain to 
me about my seat recline, and nobody has ever 
offered me money, or anything else of value, in 
exchange for sitting upright.
If sitting behind my reclined seat was such 
misery, if recliners like me are “monsters,” as 
Mark Hemingway of The Weekly Standard puts it, 
why is nobody willing to pay me to stop? Peo-
ple talk a big game on social media about the 
terribleness of reclining, but then people like to 
complain about all sorts of things; if they really 
cared that much, someone would have opened 
his wallet and paid me by now. ■

The Coase Theorem in Action
IN THE NEWS
THE IMAGE BANK/GETTY IMAGES
Dick to find another home for the dog, there are many prices that could lead to this 
outcome. Dick might demand $750, and Jane might offer only $550. As they haggle 
over the price, the inefficient outcome with the barking dog persists.
Reaching an efficient bargain is especially difficult when the number of inter-
ested parties is large, because coordinating everyone is costly. For example, con-
sider a factory that pollutes the water of a nearby lake. The pollution confers a 
negative externality on the local fishermen. According to the Coase theorem, if the 
pollution is inefficient, then the factory and the fishermen could reach a bargain 
in which the fishermen pay the factory not to pollute. If there are many fishermen,

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
however, trying to coordinate them all to bargain with the factory may be almost 
impossible.
When private bargaining does not work, the government can sometimes play a 
role. The government is an institution designed for collective action. In this exam-
ple, the government can act on behalf of the fishermen, even when it is impracti-
cal for the fishermen to act for themselves.

10-4 Conclusion
The invisible hand is powerful but not omnipotent. A market’s equilibrium maxi-
mizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. When the buyers and sellers in 
the market are the only interested parties, this outcome is efficient from the stand-
point of society as a whole. But when there are external effects, such as pollution, 
evaluating a market outcome requires taking into account the well-being of third 
parties as well. In this case, the invisible hand of the marketplace may fail to allo-
cate resources efficiently.
In some cases, people can solve the problem of externalities on their own. The 
Coase theorem suggests that the interested parties can bargain among themselves 
and agree on an efficient solution. Sometimes, however, an efficient outcome can-
not be reached, perhaps because the large number of interested parties makes bar-
gaining difficult.
When people cannot solve the problem of externalities privately, the govern-
ment often steps in. Yet even with government intervention, society should not 
abandon market forces entirely. Rather, the government can address the problem 
by requiring decision makers to bear the full costs of their actions. Pollution per-
mits and corrective taxes on emissions, for instance, are designed to internalize 
the externality of pollution. These are increasingly the policies of choice for those 
interested in protecting the environment. Market forces, properly redirected, are 
often the best remedy for market failure.

out smoke that Hillary’s neighbor Kristen has to 
breathe.
c. Hillary’s newly cut lawn makes her neighborhood 
more attractive.
d. Hillary’s neighbors pay her if she promises to get 
her lawn cut on a regular basis.

d. both parties understand the externality fully.
SUMMARY
r When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly 
affects a third party, the effect is called an external-
ity. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as 
pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is 
less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields 
positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, 
the  socially optimal quantity is greater than the equi-
librium quantity.
r Governments pursue various policies to remedy the 
inefficiencies caused by externalities. Sometimes the 
government prevents socially inefficient activity by 
regulating behavior. Other times it internalizes an ex-
ternality using corrective taxes. Another public policy 
is to issue permits. For example, the government could 
protect the environment by issuing a limited number 
of pollution permits. The result of this policy is similar 
to imposing corrective taxes on polluters.
r Those affected by externalities can sometimes solve 
the problem privately. For instance, when one business 
imposes an externality on another business, the two 
businesses can internalize the externality by merging. 
Alternatively, the interested parties can solve the prob-
lem by negotiating a contract. According to the Coase 
theorem, if people can bargain without cost, then they 
can always reach an agreement in which resources are 
allocated efficiently. In many cases, however, reaching 
a bargain among the many interested parties is diffi-
cult, so the Coase theorem does not apply.

5. List some of the ways that the problems caused by 
externalities can be solved without government 
intervention.
6. Imagine that you are a nonsmoker sharing a room 
with a smoker. According to the Coase theorem,  
what determines whether your roommate smokes in 
the room? Is this outcome efficient? How do you and 
your roommate reach this solution?
PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS
1. Consider two ways to protect your car from theft. The 
Club (a steering wheel lock) makes it difficult for a 
car thief to take your car. Lojack (a tracking system) 
makes it easier for the police to catch the car thief who 
has stolen it. Which of these methods conveys a nega-
tive externality on other car owners? Which conveys a 
positive externality? Do you think there are any policy 
implications of your analysis?
2. Consider the market for fire extinguishers.
a. Why might fire extinguishers exhibit positive 
externalities?
b. Draw a graph of the market for fire extinguishers, 
labeling the demand curve, the social-value curve, 
the supply curve, and the social-cost curve.
c. Indicate the market equilibrium level of output 
and the efficient level of output. Give an intuitive 
explanation for why these quantities differ. 
d. If the external benefit is $10 per extinguisher, 
 describe a government policy that would yield the 
efficient outcome.
3. Greater consumption of alcohol leads to more motor 
vehicle accidents and, thus, imposes costs on people 
who do not drink and drive.
a. Illustrate the market for alcohol, labeling the 
 demand curve, the social-value curve, the supply 
curve, the social-cost curve, the market equilib-
rium level of output, and the efficient level of 
output.
b. On your graph, shade the area corresponding to 
the deadweight loss of the market equilibrium. 
(Hint: The deadweight loss occurs because some 
units of alcohol are consumed for which the social 
cost exceeds the social value.) Explain.
4. Many observers believe that the levels of pollution in 
our society are too high.
a. If society wishes to reduce overall pollution by a 
certain amount, why is it efficient to have different 
amounts of reduction at different firms?
b. Command-and-control approaches often rely on 
uniform reductions among firms. Why are these 
approaches generally unable to target the firms 
that should undertake bigger reductions?
c. Economists argue that appropriate corrective 
taxes or tradable pollution rights will result 
in efficient pollution reduction. How do these 
 approaches target the firms that should undertake 
bigger reductions?
5. The many identical residents of Whoville love 
 drinking Zlurp. Each resident has the following 
 willingness to pay for the tasty refreshment:
 
First bottle  
$5
 
Second bottle 
4
 
Third bottle 
 3
 
Fourth bottle 
 2
 
Fifth bottle  
 1
 
Further bottles 
 0
a. The cost of producing Zlurp is $1.50, and the 
 competitive suppliers sell it at this price. (The 
 supply curve is horizontal.) How many bottles 
will each Whovillian consume? What is each 
 person’s consumer surplus?
b. Producing Zlurp creates pollution. Each bottle has 
an external cost of $1. Taking this additional cost 
into account, what is total surplus per person in 
the allocation you described in part (a)?
c. Cindy Lou Who, one of the residents of Whoville, 
decides on her own to reduce her consumption 
of Zlurp by one bottle. What happens to Cindy’s 
welfare (her consumer surplus minus the cost of 
pollution she experiences)? How does Cindy’s  
decision affect total surplus in Whoville?
d. Mayor Grinch imposes a $1 tax on Zlurp. What 
is consumption per person now? Calculate con-
sumer surplus, the external cost, government  
revenue, and total surplus per person.
e. Based on your calculations, would you support 
the mayor’s policy? Why or why not?
6. Bruno loves playing rock ‘n’ roll music at high  
volume. Placido loves opera and hates rock ‘n’ roll. 
Unfortunately, they are next-door neighbors in an 
apartment building with paper-thin walls.
a. What is the externality here?
b. What command-and-control policy might the 
landlord impose? Could such a policy lead to an 
inefficient outcome?
c. Suppose the landlord lets the tenants do what-
ever they want. According to the Coase theorem,

how might Bruno and Placido reach an efficient 
outcome on their own? What might prevent them 
from reaching an efficient outcome?
7. Figure 4 shows that for any given demand curve 
for the right to pollute, the government can achieve 
the same outcome either by setting a price with a 
corrective tax or by setting a quantity with pollution 
permits. Suppose there is a sharp improvement in the 
technology for controlling pollution.
a. Using graphs similar to those in Figure 4, illus-
trate the effect of this development on the demand 
for pollution rights.
b. What is the effect on the price and quantity of  
pollution under each regulatory system? Explain.
8. Suppose that the government decides to issue tradable 
permits for a certain form of pollution.
a. Does it matter for economic efficiency whether the 
government distributes or auctions the permits? 
Why or why not?
b. If the government chooses to distribute the  
permits, does the allocation of permits among 
firms matter for efficiency? Explain.
9. There are three industrial firms in Happy Valley.
 
 
Initial Pollution 
Cost of Reducing 
 
Firm 
Level 
Pollution by 1 Unit
 
A 
30 units 
$20
 
B 
40 units 
$30
 
C 
20 units 
$10
 
 The government wants to reduce pollution to 60 units, 
so it gives each firm 20 tradable pollution permits.
a. Who sells permits and how many do they sell? 
Who buys permits and how many do they buy? 
Briefly explain why the sellers and buyers are 
each willing to do so. What is the total cost of  
pollution reduction in this situation?
b. How much higher would the costs of pollution  
reduction be if the permits could not be traded?

Public Goods and Common 
Resources 
A
n old song lyric maintains that “the best things in life are free.” A moment’s 
thought reveals a long list of goods that the songwriter could have had in 
mind. Nature provides some of them, such as rivers, mountains, beaches, 
lakes, and oceans. The government provides others, such as playgrounds, parks, 
and parades. In each case, people often do not pay a fee when they choose to 
 enjoy the benefit of the good.
Goods without prices provide a special challenge for economic analysis. Most 
goods in our economy are allocated through markets, in which buyers pay for 
what they receive and sellers are paid for what they provide. For these goods,

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
prices are the signals that guide the decisions of buyers and sellers, and these 
decisions lead to an efficient allocation of resources. When goods are available 
free of charge, however, the market forces that normally allocate resources in our 
economy are absent.
In this chapter, we examine the problems that arise for the allocation of 
 resources when there are goods without market prices. Our analysis will shed 
light on one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: Governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. When a good does not have a price attached 
to it, private markets cannot ensure that the good is produced and consumed in 
the proper amounts. In such cases, government policy can potentially remedy the 
market failure and increase economic well-being.
11-1 The Different Kinds of Goods
How well do markets work in providing the goods that people want? The  answer 
to this question depends on the good being considered. As we discussed in 
 Chapter 7, a market can provide the efficient number of ice-cream cones: The price 
of ice-cream cones adjusts to balance supply and demand, and this equilibrium 
maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus. Yet as we discussed in 
Chapter 10, the market cannot be counted on to prevent aluminum manufacturers 
from polluting the air we breathe: Buyers and sellers in a market typically do not 
take into account the external effects of their decisions. Thus, markets work well if 
the good is ice cream, but they don’t if the good is clean air. 
When thinking about the various goods in the economy, it is useful to group 
them according to two characteristics:
• Is the good excludable? That is, can people be prevented from using 
the good? 
• Is the good rival in consumption? That is, does one person’s use of the good 
reduce another person’s ability to use it?
Using these two characteristics, Figure 1 divides goods into four categories: 
 1. Private goods are both excludable and rival in consumption. Consider an 
ice-cream cone, for example. An ice-cream cone is excludable because it is 
possible to prevent someone from eating one—you just don’t give it to her. 
An ice-cream cone is rival in consumption because if one person eats an 
ice-cream cone, another person cannot eat the same cone. Most goods in the 
economy are private goods like ice-cream cones: You don’t get one unless 
you pay for it, and once you have it, you are the only person who benefits. 
When we analyzed supply and demand in Chapters 4, 5, and 6 and the effi-
ciency of markets in Chapters 7, 8, and 9, we implicitly assumed that goods 
were both excludable and rival in consumption. 
 2. Public goods are neither excludable nor rival in consumption. That is, peo-
ple cannot be prevented from using a public good, and one person’s use of a 
public good does not reduce another person’s ability to use it. For example, 
a tornado siren in a small town is a public good. Once the siren sounds, it is 
impossible to prevent any single person from hearing it (so it is not exclud-
able). Moreover, when one person gets the benefit of the warning, she does not 
 reduce the benefit to anyone else (so it is not rival in consumption).

CHAPTER 11   PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES 
FIGURE 1
Four Types of Goods
Goods can be grouped into four 
categories according to two 
characteristics: (1) A good is 
excludable if people can be pre-
vented from using it. (2) A good 
is rival in consumption if one 
person’s use of the good dimin-
ishes other people’s use of it. 
This diagram gives examples of 
goods in each category.

3. Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. For example, 
fish in the ocean are rival in consumption: When one person catches fish, there are 
fewer fish for the next person to catch. But these fish are not an excludable good 
because it is difficult to stop fishermen from taking fish out of a vast ocean.
 4. Club goods are excludable but not rival in consumption. For instance, consider 
fire protection in a small town. It is easy to exclude someone from using this 
good: The fire department can just let her house burn down. But fire protection 
is not rival in consumption: Once a town has paid for the fire department, the 
additional cost of protecting one more house is small. (We discuss club goods 
again in Chapter 15, where we see that they are one type of a natural monopoly.)
Although Figure 1 offers a clean separation of goods into four categories, 
the boundaries between the categories are sometimes fuzzy. Whether goods are 
 excludable or rival in consumption is often a matter of degree. Fish in an ocean 
may not be excludable because monitoring fishing is so difficult, but a large 
enough coast guard could make fish at least partly excludable. Similarly, although 
fish are generally rival in consumption, this would be less true if the population of 
fishermen were small relative to the population of fish. (Think of North American 
fishing waters before the arrival of European settlers.) For purposes of our analy-
sis, however, it will be helpful to group goods into these four categories.
In this chapter, we examine goods that are not excludable: public goods and 
common resources. Because people cannot be prevented from using these goods, 
they are available to everyone free of charge. The study of public goods and 
common resources is closely related to the study of externalities. For both of 
these types of goods, externalities arise because something of value has no price 
 attached to it. If one person were to provide a public good, such as a tornado 
siren, other people would be better off. They would receive a benefit without 
paying for it—a positive externality. Similarly, when one person uses a common 
 resource such as the fish in the ocean, other people are worse off because there are 
fewer fish to catch. They suffer a loss but are not compensated for it—a negative 
externality. Because of these external effects, private decisions about consumption 
and production can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, and government 
intervention can potentially raise economic well-being.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
11-2 Public Goods
To understand how public goods differ from other goods and why they present 
problems for society, let’s consider an example: a fireworks display. This good is 
not excludable because it is impossible to prevent someone from seeing fireworks, 
and it is not rival in consumption because one person’s enjoyment of fireworks 
does not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of them. 
11-2a The Free-Rider Problem
The citizens of Smalltown, U.S.A., like seeing fireworks on the Fourth of July. 
Each of the town’s 500 residents places a $10 value on the experience for a total 
benefit of $5,000. The cost of putting on a fireworks display is $1,000. Because the 
$5,000 benefit exceeds the $1,000 cost, it is efficient for Smalltown to have a fire-
works display on the Fourth of July.
Would the private market produce the efficient outcome? Probably not. Imag-
ine that Ella, a Smalltown entrepreneur, decided to put on a fireworks display. 
Ella would surely have trouble selling tickets to the event because her potential 
customers would quickly figure out that they could see the fireworks even with-
out a ticket. Because fireworks are not excludable, people have an incentive to be 
free riders. A free rider is a person who receives the benefit of a good but does not 
pay for it. Because people would have an incentive to be free riders rather than 
ticket buyers, the market would fail to provide the efficient outcome.
One way to view this market failure is that it arises because of an externality. If 
Ella puts on the fireworks display, she confers an external benefit on those who see 
the display without paying for it. When deciding whether to put on the display, 
however, Ella does not take the external benefits into account. Even though the 
fireworks display is socially desirable, it is not profitable. As a result, Ella makes 
the privately rational but socially inefficient decision not to put on the display.
Although the private market fails to supply the fireworks display demanded 
by Smalltown residents, the solution to Smalltown’s problem is obvious: The 
 local government can sponsor a Fourth of July celebration. The town council 
can raise everyone’s taxes by $2 and use the revenue to hire Ella to produce the 
fireworks. Everyone in Smalltown is better off by $8—the $10 at which residents 
value the fireworks minus the $2 tax bill. Ella can help Smalltown reach the effi-
cient outcome as a public employee even though she could not do so as a private 
entrepreneur.
The story of Smalltown is simplified but realistic. In fact, many local govern-
ments in the United States pay for fireworks on the Fourth of July. Moreover, the 
story shows a general lesson about public goods: Because public goods are not 
excludable, the free-rider problem prevents the private market from supplying 
them. The government, however, can remedy the problem. If the government 
 decides that the total benefits of a public good exceed its costs, it can provide the 
public good, pay for it with tax revenue, and potentially make everyone better off.
11-2b Some Important Public Goods
There are many examples of public goods. Here we consider three of the most 
important. 
National Defense  The defense of a country from foreign aggressors is a classic 
example of a public good. Once the country is defended, it is impossible to pre-
vent any single person from enjoying the benefit of this defense. And when one 
free rider
a person who receives 
the benefit of a good but 
avoids paying for it

CHAPTER 11   PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES 
person enjoys the benefit of national defense, she does not reduce the ben-
efit to anyone else. Thus, national defense is neither excludable nor rival 
in consumption.
National defense is also one of the most expensive public goods. In 
2014, the U.S. federal government spent a total of $748 billion on national 
defense, more than $2,346 per person. People disagree about whether this 
amount is too small or too large, but almost no one doubts that some gov-
ernment spending for national defense is necessary. Even economists who 
advocate small government agree that national defense is a public good 
the government should provide.
Basic Research  Knowledge is created through research. In evaluating 
the appropriate public policy toward knowledge creation, it is important 
to distinguish general knowledge from specific technological knowledge. Spe-
cific technological knowledge, such as the invention of a longer-lasting battery, 
a smaller microchip, or a better digital music player, can be patented. The pat-
ent gives the inventor the exclusive right to the knowledge she has created for a 
 period of time. Anyone else who wants to use the patented information must pay 
the inventor for the right to do so. In other words, the patent makes the knowl-
edge created by the inventor excludable. 
By contrast, general knowledge is a public good. For example, a mathema-
tician cannot patent a theorem. Once a theorem is proven, the knowledge is 
not excludable: The theorem enters society’s general pool of knowledge that 
anyone can use without charge. The theorem is also not rival in consumption: 
One person’s use of the theorem does not prevent any other person from using 
the theorem.
Profit-seeking firms spend a lot on research trying to develop new products 
that they can patent and sell, but they do not spend much on basic research. Their 
incentive, instead, is to free ride on the general knowledge created by others. As a 
result, in the absence of any public policy, society would devote too few resources 
to creating new knowledge.
The government tries to provide the public good of general knowledge in var-
ious ways. Government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and 
the National Science Foundation, subsidize basic research in medicine, mathe-
matics, physics, chemistry, biology, and even economics. Some people justify gov-
ernment funding of the space program on the grounds that it adds to society’s 
pool of knowledge. Determining the appropriate level of government support for 
these endeavors is difficult because the benefits are hard to measure. Moreover, 
the members of Congress who appropriate funds for research usually have little 
expertise in science and, therefore, are not in the best position to judge what lines 
of research will produce the largest benefits. So, while basic research is surely a 
public good, we should not be surprised if the public sector fails to pay for the 
right amount and the right kinds.
Fighting Poverty  Many government programs are aimed at helping the poor. 
The welfare system (officially called TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families) provides a small income for some poor families. Food stamps (officially 
called SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) subsidize the purchase 
of food for those with low incomes. And various government housing programs 
make shelter more affordable. These antipoverty programs are financed by taxes 
paid by families that are financially more successful.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Economists disagree among themselves about what role the government should 
play in fighting poverty. We discuss this debate more fully in Chapter 20, but here we 
note one important argument: Advocates of antipoverty programs claim that fighting 
poverty is a public good. Even if everyone prefers living in a society without poverty, 
fighting poverty is not a “good” that private actions will adequately provide.
To see why, suppose someone tried to organize a group of wealthy individuals 
to try to eliminate poverty. They would be providing a public good. This good 
would not be rival in consumption: One person’s enjoyment of living in a society 
without poverty would not reduce anyone else’s enjoyment of it. The good would 
not be excludable: Once poverty is eliminated, no one can be prevented from tak-
ing pleasure in this fact. As a result, there would be a tendency for people to free 
ride on the generosity of others, enjoying the benefits of poverty elimination with-
out contributing to the cause.
Because of the free-rider problem, eliminating poverty through private charity will 
probably not work. Yet government action can solve this problem. Taxing the wealthy 
to raise the living standards of the poor can potentially make everyone better off. The 
poor are better off because they now enjoy a higher standard of living, and those pay-
ing the taxes are better off because they enjoy living in a society with less poverty.
CASE 
STUDY
ARE LIGHTHOUSES PUBLIC GOODS?
Some goods can switch between being public goods and being private 
goods depending on the circumstances. For example, a fireworks display is 
a public good if performed in a town with many residents. Yet if performed 
at a private amusement park, such as Walt Disney World, a fireworks display is more like 
a private good because visitors to the park pay for admission.
Another example is a lighthouse. Economists have long used lighthouses as an 
example of a public good. Lighthouses mark specific locations along the coast so 
that passing ships can avoid treacherous waters. The benefit that the 
lighthouse provides to the ship captain is neither excludable nor rival 
in consumption, so each captain has an incentive to free ride by using 
the lighthouse to navigate without paying for the service. Because of 
this free-rider problem, private markets usually fail to provide the light-
houses that ship captains need. As a result, most lighthouses today are 
operated by the government.
In some cases, however, lighthouses have been closer to private goods. On 
the coast of England in the 19th century, for example, some lighthouses were 
privately owned and operated. Instead of trying to charge ship captains for the 
service, however, the owner of the lighthouse charged the owner of the nearby 
port. If the port owner did not pay, the lighthouse owner turned off the light, 
and ships avoided that port.
In deciding whether something is a public good, one must determine 
who the beneficiaries are and whether these beneficiaries can be excluded 
from using the good. A free-rider problem arises when the number of 
beneficiaries is large and exclusion of any one of them is impossible. If a 
lighthouse benefits many ship captains, it is a public good. If it primarily 
benefits a single port owner, it is more like a private good. ●
11-2c The Difficult Job of Cost–Benefit Analysis 
So far we have seen that the government provides public goods 
 because the private market on its own will not produce an efficient 
quantity. Yet deciding that the government must play a role is only the 
What kind of good is this?

CHAPTER 11   PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES 
first step. The government must then determine what kinds of public goods to 
provide and in what quantities. 
Suppose that the government is considering a public project, such as building 
a new highway. To judge whether to build the highway, it must compare the total 
benefits for all those who would use it to the costs of building and maintaining it. 
To make this decision, the government might hire a team of economists and engi-
neers to conduct a study, called a cost–benefit analysis, to estimate the total costs 
and benefits of the project to society as a whole.
Cost–benefit analysts have a tough job. Because the highway will be available 
to everyone free of charge, there is no price with which to judge the value of the 
highway. Simply asking people how much they would value the highway is not 
reliable: Quantifying benefits is difficult using the results from a questionnaire, 
and respondents have little incentive to tell the truth. Those who would use the 
highway have an incentive to exaggerate the benefit they receive to get the high-
way built. Those who would be harmed by the highway have an incentive to 
 exaggerate the costs to them to prevent the highway from being built.
The efficient provision of public goods is, therefore, intrinsically more difficult 
than the efficient provision of private goods. When buyers of a private good  enter 
a market, they reveal the value they place on it through the prices they are will-
ing to pay. At the same time, sellers reveal their costs with the prices they are 
willing to accept. The equilibrium is an efficient allocation of resources because 
it reflects all this information. By contrast, cost–benefit analysts do not have any 
price signals to observe when evaluating whether the government should provide 
a public good and how much to provide. Their findings on the costs and benefits 
of public projects are rough approximations at best.

STUDY
HOW MUCH IS A LIFE WORTH?
Imagine that you have been elected to serve as a member of your local 
town council. The town engineer comes to you with a proposal: The 
town can spend $10,000 to install and operate a traffic light at a town 
intersection that now has only a stop sign. The benefit of the traffic light is increased 
safety. The engineer estimates, based on data from similar intersections, that the traf-
fic light would reduce the risk of a fatal traffic accident over the lifetime of the traffic 
light from 1.6 to 1.1 percent. Should you spend the money for the new light?
To answer this question, you turn to cost–benefit analysis. But you quickly run 
into an obstacle: The costs and benefits must be measured in the same units if 
you are to compare them meaningfully. The cost is measured in dollars, but the 
 benefit—the possibility of saving a person’s life—is not directly monetary. To make 
your decision, you have to put a dollar value on a human life.
At first, you may be tempted to conclude that a human life is priceless. After all, there 
is probably no amount of money that you could be paid to voluntarily give up your life or 
that of a loved one. This suggests that a human life has an infinite dollar value. 
For the purposes of cost–benefit analysis, however, this answer leads to nonsen-
sical results. If we truly placed an infinite value on human life, we should place 
traffic lights on every street corner, and we should all drive large cars loaded with 
the latest safety features. Yet traffic lights are not at every corner, and people some-
times choose to pay less for smaller cars without safety options such as side-impact 
air bags or antilock brakes. In both our public and private decisions, we are at times 
willing to risk our lives to save some money. 
Once we have accepted the idea that a person’s life has an implicit dollar value, 
how can we determine what that value is? One approach, sometimes used by 
cost–benefit analysis
a study that compares 
the costs and benefits 
to society of providing

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
courts to award damages in wrongful-death suits, is to look at the total amount of 
money a person would have earned if she had lived. Economists are often critical of 
this approach because it ignores other opportunity costs of losing one’s life. It thus 
has the bizarre implication that the life of a retired or disabled person has no value.
A better way to value human life is to look at the risks that people are volun-
tarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them. For exam-
ple, mortality risk varies across jobs. Construction workers in high-rise buildings 
face greater risk of death on the job than office workers do. By comparing wages in 
risky and less risky occupations, controlling for education, experience, and other 
determinants of wages, economists can get some sense about what value people 
put on their own lives. Studies using this approach conclude that the value of a 
human life is about $10 million.
We can now return to our original example and respond to the town engineer. The 
traffic light reduces the risk of fatality by 0.5 percentage points. Thus, the expected 
benefit from installing the traffic light is 0.005 3 $10 million, or $50,000. This estimate

11-3 Common Resources
Common resources, like public goods, are not excludable: They are available 
free of charge to anyone who wants to use them. Common resources are, how-
ever, rival in consumption: One person’s use of the common resource reduces 
other people’s ability to use it. Thus, common resources give rise to a new 
problem: Once the good is provided, policymakers need to be concerned about 
how much it is used. This problem is best understood from the classic parable 
called the Tragedy of the Commons.
11-3a The Tragedy of the Commons
Consider life in a small medieval town. Of the many economic activities that take 
place in the town, one of the most important is raising sheep. Many of the town’s 
families own flocks of sheep and support themselves by selling the sheep’s wool, 
which is used to make clothing.
As our story begins, the sheep spend much of their time grazing on the land 
surrounding the town, called the Town Common. No family owns the land. 
 Instead, the town residents own the land collectively, and all the residents are 
 allowed to graze their sheep on it. Collective ownership works well because land 
is plentiful. As long as everyone can get all the good grazing land they want, the 
Town Common is not rival in consumption, and allowing residents’ sheep to 
graze for free causes no problems. Everyone in the town is happy. 
As the years pass, the population of the town grows, and so does the number 
of sheep grazing on the Town Common. With a growing number of sheep and a 
fixed amount of land, the land starts to lose its ability to replenish itself. Even-
tually, the land is grazed so heavily that it becomes barren. With no grass left on 
the Town Common, raising sheep is impossible, and the town’s once prosperous 
wool industry disappears. Many families lose their source of livelihood.
Tragedy of the Commons

why common resources are 
used more than is desir-
able from the standpoint 
of society as a whole

CHAPTER 11   PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES 
What causes the tragedy? Why do the shepherds allow the sheep population 
to grow so large that it destroys the Town Common? The reason is that social and 
private incentives differ. Avoiding the destruction of the grazing land depends on 
the collective action of the shepherds. If the shepherds acted together, they could 
reduce the sheep population to a size that the Town Common can support. Yet 
no single family has an incentive to reduce the size of its own flock because each 
flock represents only a small part of the problem.
In essence, the Tragedy of the Commons arises because of an externality. When 
one family’s flock grazes on the common land, it reduces the quality of the land 
available for other families. Because people neglect this negative externality when 
deciding how many sheep to own, the result is an excessive number of sheep. 
If the tragedy had been foreseen, the town could have solved the problem in 
various ways. It could have regulated the number of sheep in each family’s flock, 
internalized the externality by taxing sheep, or auctioned off a limited number of 
sheep-grazing permits. That is, the medieval town could have dealt with the problem 
of overgrazing in the way that modern society deals with the problem of pollution.
In the case of land, however, there is a simpler solution. The town can divide 
the land among town families. Each family can enclose its parcel of land with a 
fence and then protect it from excessive grazing. In this way, the land becomes 
a private good rather than a common resource. This outcome in fact occurred 
during the enclosure movement in England during the 17th century. 
The Tragedy of the Commons is a story with a general lesson: When one person 
uses a common resource, she diminishes other people’s enjoyment of it. Because 
of this negative externality, common resources tend to be used excessively. The 
government can solve the problem by using regulation or taxes to reduce con-
sumption of the common resource. Alternatively, the government can sometimes 
turn the common resource into a private good. 
This lesson has been known for thousands of years. The ancient Greek philos-
opher Aristotle pointed out the problem with common resources: “What is com-
mon to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is 
their own than for what they possess in common with others.” 
11-3b Some Important Common Resources
There are many examples of common resources. In almost all 
cases, the same problem arises as in the Tragedy of the Com-
mons: Private decision makers use the common resource too 
much. As a result, governments often regulate behavior or im-
pose fees to mitigate the problem of overuse.
Clean Air and Water  As we discussed in Chapter 10, markets do 
not adequately protect the environment. Pollution is a negative ex-
ternality that can be remedied with regulations or with corrective 
taxes on polluting activities. One can view this market failure as 
an example of a common-resource problem. Clean air and clean 
water are common resources like open grazing land, and excessive 
pollution is like excessive grazing. Environmental degradation is a 
modern Tragedy of the Commons.
Congested Roads  Roads can be either public goods or com-
mon resources. If a road is not congested, then one person’s 
use does not affect anyone else. In this case, use is not rival in 
“In general, using more congestion charges in crowded trans-
portation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel 
times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing 
slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would 
make citizens on average better off.”

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Many economists think drivers should 
be charged more for using roads. Here 
is why.
Why You’ll Love Paying for 
Roads That Used to Be Free
By Eric A. Morris
T
o end the scourge of traffic congestion, 
Julius Caesar banned most carts from 
the streets of Rome during daylight hours. 
It didn’t work—traffic jams just shifted to 
dusk. Two thousand years later, we have 
put a man on the moon and developed gar-
ments infinitely more practical than the 
toga, but we seem little nearer to solving 
the congestion problem.
If you live in a city, particularly a large 
one, you probably need little convincing that 
traffic congestion is frustrating and wasteful. 
According to the Texas Transportation Insti-
tute, the average American urban traveler 
lost 38 hours, nearly one full work week, to 
congestion in 2005. And congestion is getting 
worse, not better; urban travelers in 1982 
were delayed only 14 hours that year. 
Americans want action, but unfortunately 
there aren’t too many great ideas about what that 
action might be. As Anthony Downs’s excellent 
book Still Stuck in Traffic: Coping With Peak-Hour 
Traffic  Congestion chronicles, most of the proposed 
solutions are too difficult to implement, won’t work, 
or both. 
Fortunately, there is one remedy which is 
both doable and largely guaranteed to suc-
ceed. In the space of a year or two we could 
have you zipping along the 405 or the LIE 
at the height of rush hour at a comfortable 
55 miles per hour. 
There’s just one small problem with this 
silver bullet for congestion: many people 
seem to prefer the werewolf. Despite its mer-
its, this policy, which is known as “congestion 
pricing,” “value pricing,” or “variable toll-
ing,” is not an easy political sell. 
For decades, economists and other trans-
portation thinkers have advocated  imposing 
tolls that vary with congestion levels on 
roadways. Simply put, the more  congestion, 
the higher the toll, until the congestion 
goes away. 
To many people, this sounds like a scheme 
by mustache-twirling bureaucrats and their 
academic apologists to fleece drivers out of 
their hard-earned cash. Why should drivers 
have to pay to use roads their tax dollars have 
already paid for? Won’t the remaining free 
roads be swamped as drivers are forced off 
the tolled roads? Won’t the working-class and 
poor be the victims here, as the tolled routes 
turn into “Lexus lanes”? 
And besides, adopting this policy would 
mean listening to economists, and who wants 
to do that? 
There’s a real problem with this logic, 
which is that, on its own terms, it makes per-
fect sense (except for the listening to econo-
mists part). Opponents of tolls are certainly 
not stupid, and their arguments deserve 
 serious consideration. But in the end, their 
concerns are largely overblown, and the bene-
fits of tolling swamp the potential costs. 
Unfortunately, it can be hard to convey this 
because the theory behind tolling is somewhat 
complex and counterintuitive. This is too bad, 
because variable tolling is an excellent public 
policy. Here’s why: the basic economic theory is 
that when you give out something valuable—in 
this case, road space—for less than its true 
value, shortages result. 
Ultimately, there’s no free lunch; instead 
of paying with money, you pay with the effort

consumption, and the road is a public good. Yet if a road is congested, then use 
of that road yields a negative externality. When one person drives on the road, it 
becomes more crowded, and other people must drive more slowly. In this case, 
the road is a common resource.
One way for the government to address the problem of road congestion is to 
charge drivers a toll. A toll is, in essence, a corrective tax on the externality of con-
gestion. Sometimes, as in the case of local roads, tolls are not a practical solution 
because the cost of collecting them is too high. But several major cities, including 
London and Stockholm, have found increasing tolls to be a very effective way to 
reduce congestion.
Sometimes congestion is a problem only at certain times of day. If a bridge is 
heavily traveled only during rush hour, for instance, the congestion externality 
is largest during this time. The efficient way to deal with these externalities is

CHAPTER 11   PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES 
and time needed to acquire the good. Think of 
Soviet shoppers spending their lives in end-
less queues to purchase artificially low-priced 
but exceedingly scarce goods. Then think of 
Americans who can fulfill nearly any consum-
erist fantasy quickly but at a monetary cost. 
Free but congested roads have left us shiver-
ing on the streets of Moscow.
To consider it another way, delay is an 
externality imposed by drivers on their peers. 
By driving onto a busy road and contribut-
ing to congestion, drivers slow the speeds of 
others—but they never have to pay for it, at 
least not directly. In the end, of course, every-
body pays, because as we impose congestion 
on others, others impose it on us. This degen-
erates into a game that nobody can win.
Markets work best when externalities 
are internalized: i.e., you pay for the hassle 
you inflict on others…. Using tolls to help 
internalize the congestion externality would 
somewhat reduce the number of trips made 
on the most congested roads at the peak 
 usage periods; some trips would be moved to 
less congested times and routes, and others 
would be foregone entirely. This way we would 
cut down on the congestion costs we impose 
on each other. 
Granted, tolls cannot fully cope with 
 accidents and other incidents, which are 
 major causes of delay. But pricing can largely 
eliminate chronic, recurring congestion. No 
matter how high the demand for a road, there 
is a level of toll that will keep it flowing freely. 
To make tolling truly effective, the price 
must be right. Too high a price drives away 
too many cars and the road does not function 
at its capacity. Too low a price and congestion 
isn’t licked. 
The best solution is to vary the tolls in 
real time based on an analysis of current 
traffic conditions. Pilot toll projects on roads 
(like the I-394 in Minnesota and the I-15 in 
 Southern California) use sensors embedded 
in the pavement to monitor the number and 
speeds of vehicles on the facility. 
A simple computer program then 
 determines the number of cars that should be 
allowed in. The computer then calculates the 
level of toll that will attract that number of 
cars—and no more. Prices are then updated 
every few minutes on electronic message 
signs. Hi-tech transponders and antenna 
 arrays make waiting at toll booths a thing of 
the past. 
The bottom line is that speeds are kept 
high (over 45 m.p.h.) so that throughput 
is higher than when vehicles are allowed to 
crowd all at once onto roadways at rush hour, 
slowing traffic to a crawl. 
To maximize efficiency, economists would 
like to price all travel, starting with the 
freeways. But given that elected officials have 
no burning desire to lose their jobs, a more 
realistic option, for now, is to toll just some 
freeway lanes that are either new  capacity 
or underused carpool lanes. The other lanes 
would be left free—and congested. Drivers 
will then have a choice: wait or pay. Granted, 
neither is ideal. But right now drivers have no 
choice at all.
What’s the bottom line here? The state of 
Washington recently opened  congestion-priced 
lanes on its State Route 167. The peak toll in 
the first month of operation (reached on the 
evening of  Wednesday, May 21) was $5.75. 
I know, I know, you would never pay such an 
exorbitant amount when America has taught 
you that free roads are your birthright. But that 
money bought  Washington drivers a 27- minute 
time savings. Is a half hour of your time 
worth $6?
I think I already know the answer, and it 
is “it depends.” Most people’s value of time 
varies widely depending on their activities 
on any given day. Late for picking the kids 
up from daycare? Paying $6 to save a half 
hour is an incredible bargain. Have to clean 
the house? The longer your trip home takes, 
the better. Tolling will introduce a new level 
of flexibility and freedom into your life, giving 
you the power to tailor your travel costs to fit 
your schedule. ■

to charge higher tolls during rush hour. This toll would provide an incentive for 
drivers to alter their schedules, reducing traffic when congestion is greatest.
Another policy that responds to the problem of road congestion (discussed in 
the previous chapter) is the tax on gasoline. A higher gasoline tax increases the 
price of gasoline, reduces the amount that people drive, and reduces road conges-
tion. The gasoline tax is an imperfect solution to congestion, however, because it 
affects other decisions besides the amount of driving on congested roads. In par-
ticular, the tax also discourages driving on uncongested roads, even though there 
is no congestion externality for these roads. 
Fish, Whales, and Other Wildlife  Many species of animals are common 
resources. Fish and whales, for instance, have commercial value, and anyone can 
go to the ocean and catch whatever is available. Each person has little incentive

to maintain the species for the next year. Just as excessive grazing can destroy the 
Town Common, excessive fishing and whaling can destroy commercially valu-
able marine populations.
Oceans remain one of the least regulated common resources. Two problems 
prevent an easy solution. First, many countries have access to the oceans, so any 
solution would require international cooperation among countries that hold dif-
ferent values. Second, because the oceans are so vast, enforcing any agreement is 
difficult. As a result, fishing rights have been a frequent source of international 
tension among normally friendly countries.
Within the United States, various laws aim to manage the use of fish and other 
wildlife. For example, the government charges for fishing and hunting licenses, 
and it restricts the lengths of the fishing and hunting seasons. Fishermen are often 
required to throw back small fish, and hunters can kill only a limited number of 
animals. All these laws reduce the use of a common resource and help maintain 
animal populations.
CASE 
STUDY
WHY THE COW IS NOT EXTINCT 
Throughout history, many species of animals have been threatened 
with extinction. When Europeans first arrived in North America, 
more than 60 million buffalo roamed the continent.  Unfortunately, 
however, hunting the buffalo was so popular during the 19th century that by 1900 
the animal’s population had fallen to about 400 before the government stepped 
in to protect the species. In some African countries today, elephants face a similar 
challenge, as poachers kill them for the ivory in their tusks.
Yet not all animals with commercial value face this threat. The cow, for exam-
ple, is a valuable source of food, but no one worries that the cow will soon be 
extinct. Indeed, the great demand for beef seems to ensure that the species will 
continue to thrive.
Why does the commercial value of ivory threaten the elephant, while the com-
mercial value of beef protects the cow? The reason is that elephants are a common 
resource, whereas cows are a private good. Elephants roam freely without any 
owners. Each poacher has a strong incentive to kill as many elephants as she can 
find. Because poachers are numerous, each poacher has only a slight incentive to 
preserve the elephant population. By contrast, cattle live on ranches that are pri-
vately owned. Each rancher makes a great effort to maintain the cattle population 
on her ranch because she reaps the benefit.
Governments have tried to solve the elephant’s problem in two ways. Some 
countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, have made it illegal to kill el-
ephants and sell their ivory. Yet these laws have been hard to enforce, and the 
battle between the authorities and the poachers has become increasingly violent. 
Meanwhile, elephant populations have continued to dwindle. By contrast, other 
countries, such as Botswana,  Malawi, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, have made ele-
phants a private good by allowing people to kill elephants, but only those on their 
own property. Landowners now have an incentive to preserve the species on their 
own land, and as a result, elephant populations have started to rise. With pri-
vate ownership and the profit motive now on its side, the African elephant might 
someday be as safe from extinction as the cow. ●

CHAPTER 11   PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES 
11-4  Conclusion: The Importance  
of Property Rights 
In this and the previous chapter, we have seen there are some “goods” that 
the market does not provide adequately. Markets do not ensure that the air we 
breathe is clean or that our country is defended from foreign aggressors. Instead, 
societies rely on the government to protect the environment and to provide for the 
national defense.
The problems we considered in these chapters arise in many different markets, 
but they share a common theme. In all cases, the market fails to allocate resources 
efficiently because property rights are not well established. That is, some item of 
value does not have an owner with the legal authority to control it. For example, 
although no one doubts that the “good” of clean air or national defense is valu-
able, no one has the right to attach a price to it and profit from its use. A factory 
pollutes too much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits. 
The market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge 
those who are defended for the benefit they receive.
When the absence of property rights causes a market failure, the government 
can potentially solve the problem. Sometimes, as in the sale of pollution permits, 
the solution is for the government to help define property rights and thereby 
 unleash market forces. Other times, as in restricted hunting seasons, the solution 
is for the government to regulate private behavior. Still other times, as in the pro-
vision of national defense, the solution is for the government to use tax revenue to 
supply a good that the market fails to supply. In each of these cases, if the policy 
is well planned and well run, it can make the allocation of resources more efficient 
and thus raise economic well-being.

• Goods differ in whether they are excludable and 
whether they are rival in consumption. A good is 
 excludable if it is possible to prevent someone from 
 using it. A good is rival in consumption if one person’s 
use of the good reduces others’ ability to use the same 
unit of the good. Markets work best for private goods, 
which are both excludable and rival in consumption. 
Markets do not work as well for other types of goods.
• Public goods are neither rival in consumption nor 
 excludable. Examples of public goods include 
 fireworks displays, national defense, and the  discovery 
of fundamental knowledge. Because people are not 
charged for their use of the public good, they have 
an incentive to free ride, making private provision of 
the good untenable. Therefore, governments provide 
 public goods, basing their decision about the quantity 
of each good on cost–benefit analysis.
• Common resources are rival in consumption but not 
excludable. Examples include common grazing land, 
clean air, and congested roads. Because people are not 
charged for their use of common resources, they tend 
to use them excessively. Therefore, governments use 
various methods, such as regulations and corrective 
taxes, to limit the use of common resources.

CHAPTER
12
The Design of the Tax System
A
l “Scarface” Capone, the notorious 1920s gangster and crime boss, was never 
convicted for his many violent crimes. Yet, eventually, he did go to jail—for 
tax evasion. He had neglected to heed Ben Franklin’s observation that “in this 
world nothing is certain but death and taxes.”
When Franklin made this claim in 1789, the average American paid less than 
5  percent of his income in taxes, and that remained true for the next hundred years. 
Over the course of the 20th century, however, taxes became ever more important in 
the life of the typical U.S. citizen. Today, all taxes taken together—including personal 
income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, and property 
taxes—use up more than a quarter of the average American’s income. 
In many European countries, the tax bite is even larger.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Taxes are inevitable because citizens expect their governments to provide 
them with various goods and services. One of the Ten Principles of Economics from 
 Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. 
But market economies rely on property rights and the rule of law, and so the gov-
ernment provides police and courts. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is 
that the government can sometimes improve market outcomes. When the govern-
ment remedies an externality (such as air pollution), provides a public good (such 
as national defense), or regulates the use of a common resource (such as fish in a 
public lake), it can raise economic well-being. But these activities can be costly. 
For the government to perform these and its many other functions, it needs to 
raise revenue through taxation.
We began our study of taxation in earlier chapters, where we saw how a 
tax on a good affects the supply and demand for that good. In Chapter 6, we 
saw that a tax reduces the quantity sold in a market, and we examined how 
the burden of a tax is shared by buyers and sellers depending on the elasticities 
of supply and demand. In Chapter 8, we examined how taxes affect economic 
well-being. We learned that taxes can cause deadweight losses: The reduction in 
consumer and producer surplus resulting from a tax exceeds the revenue raised 
by the government.
In this chapter, we build on these lessons to discuss the design of a tax system. 
We begin with some basic facts about how the U.S. government raises money. We 
then discuss the fundamental principles of taxation. Most people agree that taxes 
should impose as small a cost on society as possible and that the burden of taxes 
should be distributed fairly. That is, the tax system should be both efficient and 
equitable. As we will see, however, stating these goals is easier than achieving them.
12-1 An Overview of U.S. Taxation
How much of the nation’s income does the government collect as taxes? Figure 1 
shows government revenue, including federal, state, and local, as a percentage 
of total income for the U.S. economy. It shows that the role of government has 
grown substantially over the past century. In 1902, the government collected 
only 7  percent of total income; in recent years, government has collected almost 
30  percent. In other words, as the economy’s income has grown, the government’s 
revenue from taxation has grown even more.
Figure 2 compares the tax burden for several major countries, as measured by 
the government’s tax revenue as a percentage of the nation’s total income. The 
United States has a low tax burden compared to most other advanced economies. 
Many European nations have much higher taxes, which finance a more gener-
ous social safety net, including more substantial income support for the poor and 
unemployed.
12-1a Taxes Collected by the Federal Government
The U.S. federal government collects about two-thirds of the taxes in our econ-
omy. Table 1 shows the receipts of the federal government in 2014. Total receipts 
that year were $3.3 trillion, a number so large that it is hard to comprehend. To 
bring this astronomical number down to earth, we can divide it by the size of the 
U.S. population, which was about 319 million in 2014. We then find that the aver-
age American paid $10,235 to the federal government.

CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
This figure shows revenue of the federal government and of state and local governments as a per-
centage of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures total income in the economy. It shows 
that the government plays a large role in the U.S. economy and that its role has grown over time.

TABLE 2
The Federal Income Tax Rates: 2014
This table shows the marginal tax rates for 
an unmarried taxpayer. The taxes owed by 
a taxpayer depend on all the marginal tax 
rates up to his income level. For example, 
a taxpayer with income of $25,000 pays 
10 percent of the first $9,075 of income, 
and then 15 percent of the rest.

Personal Income Taxes  The largest source of revenue for the federal govern-
ment is the personal income tax. As April 15 approaches each year, almost  every 
American family fills out a tax form to determine the income tax it owes the 
 government. Each family is required to report its income from all sources: wages 
from working, interest on savings, dividends from corporations in which it owns 
shares, profits from any small businesses it operates, and so on. The family’s tax 
liability (how much it owes) is based on its total income. 
A family’s income tax liability is not simply proportional to its income. Instead, 
the law requires a more complicated calculation. Taxable income is computed as 
total income minus an amount based on the number of dependents (primarily 
children) and minus certain expenses that policymakers have deemed “deduct-
ible” (such as mortgage interest payments, state and local tax payments, and 
charitable giving). Then the tax liability is calculated from taxable income using a 
schedule like the one shown in Table 2.
This table presents the marginal tax rate—the tax rate applied to each additional 
dollar of income. Because the marginal tax rate rises as income rises, higher-
income families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. Note that each 
tax rate in the table applies only to income within the associated range, not to a 
person’s entire income. For example, a person with an income of $1 million still 
pays only 10 percent of the first $9,075. (Later in this chapter we discuss the con-
cept of the marginal tax rate more fully.)
Payroll Taxes  Almost as important to the federal government as the personal 
income tax are payroll taxes. A payroll tax is a tax on the wages that a firm pays its

CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
workers. Table 1 calls this revenue social insurance taxes because the revenue from 
these taxes is mostly earmarked to pay for Social Security and Medicare. Social 
Security is an income-support program designed primarily to maintain the living 
standards of the elderly. Medicare is the government health program for the elderly. 
In 2014, the total payroll tax was 15.3 percent for annual earnings up to $117,000 
and 2.9 percent of earnings above $117,000, together with an additional 0.9 percent 
for taxpayers with high income (above $200,000 if single, $250,000 if married). For 
many middle-income households, the payroll tax is the largest tax they pay.
Corporate Income Taxes  Next in magnitude, but much smaller than either 
personal income taxes or social insurance taxes, is the corporate income tax. A 
corporation is a business set up to have its own legal existence, distinct and sepa-
rate from its owners. The government taxes each corporation based on its profit—
the amount the corporation receives for the goods or services it sells minus the 
costs of producing those goods or services. Notice that corporate profits are, in 
essence, taxed twice. They are taxed once by the corporate income tax when the 
corporation earns the profits, and they are taxed again by the personal income tax 
when the corporation uses its profits to pay dividends to its shareholders. In part 
to compensate for this double taxation, policymakers have decided to tax divi-
dend income at lower rates than other types of income: In 2014, the top marginal 
tax rate on dividend income was only 20 percent (plus a 3.8 percent Medicare tax), 
compared with the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income of 39.6 percent (plus 
the same 3.8 percent).
Other Taxes  The last category, labeled “other” in Table 1, makes up 9 percent of 
receipts. This category includes excise taxes, which are taxes on specific goods like 
gasoline, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. It also includes various small items, 
such as estate taxes and customs duties.
12-1b Taxes Collected by State and Local Governments
State and local governments collect about a third of all taxes paid. Table 3 shows 
the receipts of U.S. state and local governments. Total receipts for 2014 were 
$2,225 billion, or $6,975 per person. The table also shows how this total is broken 
down into different kinds of taxes.
The two most important taxes for state and local governments are sales taxes 
and property taxes. Sales taxes are levied as a percentage of the total amount spent

at retail stores. Every time a customer buys something, he pays the storekeeper an 
extra amount that the storekeeper remits to the government. (Some states exclude 
certain items that are considered necessities, such as food and clothing.) Prop-
erty taxes are levied on property owners as a percentage of the estimated value of 
land and structures. Together, these two taxes make up more than 40 percent of all 
 receipts of state and local governments.
State and local governments also levy individual and corporate income taxes. 
In many cases, state and local income taxes are similar to federal income taxes. 
In other cases, they are quite different. For example, some states tax income from 
wages less heavily than income earned in the form of interest and dividends. 
Some states do not tax income at all.
State and local governments also receive substantial funds from the federal 
government. To some extent, the federal government’s policy of sharing its rev-
enue with state governments redistributes funds from high-income states (which 
pay more taxes) to low-income states (which receive more benefits). Often, these 
funds are tied to specific programs that the federal government wants to subsidize. 
For example, Medicaid provides healthcare for the poor; this program is managed 
by the states but much of the funding comes from the federal government.
Finally, state and local governments receive receipts from various sources 
 included in the “other” category in Table 3. These include fees for fishing and hunt-
ing licenses, tolls from roads and bridges, and fares for public buses and subways.

12-2 Taxes and Efficiency
Now that we have seen how various levels of the U.S. government raise money in 
practice, let’s consider how one might design a good tax system in principle. The 
primary aim of a tax system is to raise revenue for the government, but there are 
many ways to raise any given amount of money. When choosing among the many 
alternative taxes, policymakers have two objectives: efficiency and equity.
One tax system is more efficient than another if it raises the same amount of reve-
nue at a smaller cost to taxpayers. What are the costs of taxes to taxpayers? The most 
obvious cost is the tax payment itself. This transfer of money from the taxpayer to 
the government is an inevitable feature of any tax system. Yet taxes also impose two 
other costs, which well-designed tax policy tries to avoid or, at least, minimize:
• The deadweight losses that result when taxes distort the decisions people 
make; 
• The administrative burdens that taxpayers bear as they comply with the tax 
laws.
An efficient tax system is one that imposes small deadweight losses and small 
administrative burdens.
12-2a Deadweight Losses
One of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives, and 
this includes incentives provided by the tax system. If the government taxes ice

CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
cream, people eat less ice cream and more frozen yogurt. If the government taxes 
housing, people live in smaller houses and spend more of their income on other 
things. If the government taxes labor earnings, people work less and enjoy more 
leisure.
Because taxes distort incentives, they entail deadweight losses. As we first dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, the deadweight loss of a tax is the reduction in economic 
well-being of taxpayers in excess of the amount of revenue raised by the govern-
ment. The deadweight loss is the inefficiency that a tax creates as people allocate 
resources according to the tax incentive rather than the true costs and benefits of 
the goods and services that they buy and sell.
To recall how taxes cause deadweight losses, consider an example. Sup-
pose that Jake places an $8 value on a pizza and Jane places a $6 value on it. 
If there is no tax on pizza, the price of pizza will reflect the cost of making 
it. Let’s suppose that the price of pizza is $5, so both Jake and Jane choose to 
buy one. Both consumers get some surplus of value over the amount paid. 
Jake gets consumer surplus of $3, and Jane gets consumer surplus of $1. Total 
surplus is $4.
Now suppose that the government levies a $2 tax on pizza and the price of 
pizza rises to $7. (This occurs if supply is perfectly elastic.) Jake still buys a pizza, 
but now he has consumer surplus of only $1. Jane now decides not to buy a pizza 
because its price is higher than its value to her. The government collects tax reve-
nue of $2 on Jake’s pizza. Total consumer surplus has fallen by $3 (from $4 to $1). 
Because total surplus has fallen by more than the tax revenue, the tax has a dead-
weight loss. In this case, the deadweight loss is $1.
Notice that the deadweight loss comes not from Jake, the person who pays 
the tax, but from Jane, the person who doesn’t. The reduction of $2 in Jake’s 
surplus exactly offsets the amount of revenue the government collects. The 
deadweight loss arises because the tax causes Jane to alter her behavior. When 
the tax raises the price of pizza, Jane is worse off, and yet there is no offsetting 
revenue to the government. This reduction in Jane’s welfare is the deadweight 
loss of the tax.
CASE 
STUDY
SHOULD INCOME OR CONSUMPTION BE TAXED?
When taxes cause people to change their behavior—such as induc-
ing Jane to buy less pizza—the taxes cause deadweight losses and 
make the allocation of resources less efficient. As we have already 
seen, much government revenue comes from the personal income tax. In a case 
study in Chapter 8, we discussed how this tax discourages people from working 
as hard as they otherwise might. Another inefficiency caused by this tax is that it 
discourages people from saving.
Consider a 25-year-old deciding whether to save $1,000. If he puts this money 
in a savings account that earns 8 percent and leaves it there, he will have $21,720 
when he retires at age 65. Yet if the government taxes one-fourth of his interest 
income each year, the effective interest rate is only 6 percent. After 40 years of 
earning 6 percent, the $1,000 grows to only $10,290, less than half of what it would 
have been without taxation. Thus, because interest income is taxed, saving is 
much less attractive.
Some economists advocate eliminating the current tax system’s disincentive 
 toward saving by changing the basis of taxation. Rather than taxing the amount of 
income that people earn, the government could tax the amount that people spend. 
Under this proposal, all income that is saved would not be taxed until the saving

is later spent. This alternative system, called a consumption tax, would not distort 
people’s saving decisions. 
Various provisions of current law already make the tax system a bit like a con-
sumption tax. Taxpayers can put a limited amount of their income into special 
savings accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans, and 
this income and the accumulated interest it earns escape taxation until the money 
is withdrawn at retirement. For people who do most of their saving through these 
retirement accounts, their tax bill is, in effect, based on their consumption rather 
than their income.
European countries tend to rely more on consumption taxes than does the 
United States. Most of them raise a significant amount of government revenue 
through a value-added tax, or a VAT. A VAT is like the retail sales tax that many 
U.S. states use. But rather than collecting all of the tax at the retail level when the 
consumer buys the final good, the government collects the tax in stages as the 
good is being produced (that is, as value is added by firms along the chain of 
production).
Various U.S. policymakers have proposed that the tax code move further in 
the direction of taxing consumption rather than income. In 2005, economist Alan 
Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered this advice to a presi-
dential commission on tax reform: “As you know, many economists believe that 
a consumption tax would be best from the perspective of promoting economic 
growth—particularly if one were designing a tax system from scratch—because 
a consumption tax is likely to encourage saving and capital formation. However, 
getting from the current tax system to a consumption tax raises a challenging set 
of transition issues.” ●
12-2b Administrative Burden
If you ask the typical person on April 15 for an opinion about the tax system, 
you might get an earful (perhaps peppered with expletives) about the headache 
of filling out tax forms. The administrative burden of any tax system is part of the 
inefficiency it creates. This burden includes not only the time spent in early April 
filling out forms but also the time spent throughout the year keeping records for 
tax purposes and the resources the government uses to enforce the tax laws.
Many taxpayers—especially those in higher tax brackets—hire tax lawyers and 
accountants to help them with their taxes. These experts in the complex tax laws 
fill out tax forms for their clients and help them arrange their affairs in a way that 
reduces the amount of taxes owed. This behavior is legal tax avoidance, which is 
different from illegal tax evasion.
Critics of our tax system say that these advisers help their clients avoid taxes 
by abusing some of the detailed provisions of the tax code, often dubbed “loop-
holes.” In some cases, loopholes are congressional mistakes: They arise from 
 ambiguities or omissions in the tax laws. More often, they arise because Congress 
has chosen to give special treatment to specific types of behavior. For example, 
the U.S. federal tax code gives preferential treatment to investors in municipal 
bonds because Congress wanted to make it easier for state and local governments 
to borrow money. To some extent, this provision benefits states and localities, and 
to some extent, it benefits high-income taxpayers. Most loopholes are well known 
by those in Congress who make tax policy, but what looks like a loophole to one 
taxpayer may look like a justifiable tax deduction to another.

235
CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
The resources devoted to complying with the tax laws are a type of deadweight 
loss. The government gets only the amount of taxes paid. By contrast, the tax-
payer loses not only this amount but also the time and money spent document-
ing, computing, and avoiding taxes.
The administrative burden of the tax system could be reduced by simplifying 
the tax laws. Yet simplification is often politically difficult. Most people are ready 
to simplify the tax code by eliminating the loopholes that benefit others, but few 
are eager to give up the loopholes that they benefit from themselves. In the end, 
the complexity of the tax law results from the political process as various taxpay-
ers with their own special interests lobby for their causes. 
12-2c Marginal Tax Rates versus Average Tax Rates
When discussing the efficiency and equity of income taxes, economists distin-
guish between two notions of the tax rate: the average and the marginal. The 
average tax rate is total taxes paid divided by total income. The marginal tax rate 
is the amount by which taxes increase from an additional dollar of income.
For example, suppose that the government taxes 20 percent of the first 
$50,000 of income and 50 percent of all income above $50,000. Under this tax, a 
person who makes $60,000 pays a tax of $15,000: 20 percent of the first $50,000 
(0.20 3 $50,000 5 $10,000) plus 50 percent of the remaining $10,000 (0.50 3 $10,000 5 
$5,000). For this person, the average tax rate is $15,000 / $60,000, or 25 percent. 
But the marginal tax rate is 50 percent. If the taxpayer earned an additional dollar 
of income, that dollar would be subject to the 50 percent tax rate, so the amount 
the taxpayer would owe to the government would rise by $0.50.
The marginal and average tax rates each contain a useful piece of informa-
tion. If we are trying to gauge the sacrifice made by a taxpayer, the average tax 
rate is more appropriate because it measures the fraction of income paid in taxes. 
By contrast, if we are trying to gauge how the tax system distorts incentives, the 
marginal tax rate is more meaningful. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
 Chapter 1 is that rational people think at the margin. A corollary to this principle 
is that the marginal tax rate measures how much the tax system discourages peo-
ple from working. If you are thinking of working an extra few hours, the marginal 
tax rate determines how much the government takes of your additional earnings. 
It is the marginal tax rate, therefore, that determines the deadweight loss of an 
income tax.
12-2d Lump-Sum Taxes
Suppose the government imposes a tax of $4,000 on everyone. That is, everyone 
owes the same amount, regardless of earnings or any actions that a person might 
take. Such a tax is called a lump-sum tax.
A lump-sum tax shows clearly the difference between average and marginal 
tax rates. For a taxpayer with income of $20,000, the average tax rate of a $4,000 
lump-sum tax is 20 percent; for a taxpayer with income of $40,000, the average tax 
rate is 10 percent. For both taxpayers, the marginal tax rate is zero because no tax 
is owed on an additional dollar of income.
A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax possible. Because a person’s deci-
sions do not alter the amount owed, the tax does not distort incentives and, 
therefore, does not cause deadweight losses. Because everyone can easily com-
pute the amount owed and because there is no benefit to hiring tax lawyers

and accountants, the lump-sum tax imposes a minimal administrative burden 
on taxpayers.
If lump-sum taxes are so efficient, why do we rarely observe them in the real 
world? The reason is that efficiency is only one goal of the tax system. A lump-sum 
tax would take the same amount from the poor and the rich, an outcome most 
people would view as unfair. To understand the tax systems that we  observe, we 
must therefore consider the other major goal of tax policy: equity.

12-3 Taxes and Equity
Ever since American colonists dumped imported tea into Boston harbor to protest 
high British taxes, tax policy has generated some of the most heated debates in 
American politics. The heat is rarely fueled by questions of efficiency. Instead, it 
arises from disagreements over how the tax burden should be distributed. Sena-
tor Russell Long once mimicked the public debate with this ditty:
Don’t tax you.
Don’t tax me. 
Tax that fella behind the tree.
Of course, if we rely on the government to provide some of the goods and services 
we want, then someone must pay taxes to fund those goods and services. In this 
section, we consider the equity of a tax system. How should the burden of taxes 
be divided among the population? How do we evaluate whether a tax system is 
fair? Everyone agrees that the tax system should be equitable, but there is much 
disagreement about how to judge the equity of a tax system.
12-3a The Benefits Principle
One principle of taxation, called the benefits principle, states that people should 
pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from government services. This 
principle tries to make public goods similar to private goods. It seems fair that 
a person who often goes to the movies pays more in total for movie tickets than 
a person who rarely goes. Similarly, a person who gets great benefit from a public 
good should pay more for it than a person who gets little benefit.
The gasoline tax, for instance, is sometimes justified using the benefits princi-
ple. In some states, revenues from the gasoline tax are used to build and main-
tain roads. Because those who buy gasoline are the same people who use the 
roads, the gasoline tax might be viewed as a fair way to pay for this government 
service.
The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should 
pay higher taxes than poorer ones. Why? Simply because the wealthy benefit 
more from public services. Consider, for example, the benefits of police protection 
from theft. Citizens with much to protect benefit more from police than do those 
with less to protect. Therefore, according to the benefits principle, the wealthy 
should contribute more than the poor to the cost of maintaining the police force.

237
CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
The same argument can be used for many other public services, such as fire pro-
tection, national defense, and the court system.
It is even possible to use the benefits principle to argue for antipoverty pro-
grams funded by taxes on the wealthy. As we discussed in Chapter 11, people 
may prefer living in a society without poverty, suggesting that antipoverty pro-
grams are a public good. If the wealthy place a greater dollar value on this pub-
lic good than members of the middle class do, perhaps just because the wealthy 
have more to spend, then according to the benefits principle, they should be taxed 
more heavily to pay for these programs.
12-3b The Ability-to-Pay Principle
Another way to evaluate the equity of a tax system is called the ability-to-pay 
principle, which states that taxes should be levied on a person according to how 
well that person can shoulder the burden. This principle is sometimes justified by 
the claim that all citizens should make an “equal sacrifice” to support the govern-
ment. The magnitude of a person’s sacrifice, however, depends not only on the size 
of his tax payment but also on his income and other circumstances: A $1,000 tax paid 
by a poor person may require a larger sacrifice than a $10,000 tax paid by a rich one.
The ability-to-pay principle leads to two corollary notions of equity: vertical 
equity and horizontal equity. Vertical equity states that taxpayers with a greater 
ability to pay should contribute a larger amount. Horizontal equity states that 
taxpayers with similar abilities to pay should contribute the same amount. These 
notions of equity are widely accepted, but applying them to evaluate a tax system 
is rarely straightforward. 
Vertical Equity  If taxes are based on ability to pay, then richer taxpayers should 
pay more than poorer taxpayers. But how much more should the rich pay? The 
debate over tax policy often focuses on this question.
Consider the three tax systems in Table 4. In each case, taxpayers with higher 
incomes pay more. Yet the systems differ in how quickly taxes rise with income. 
The first system is called proportional because all taxpayers pay the same fraction 
of income. The second system is called regressive because high-income taxpayers 
pay a smaller fraction of their income, even though they pay a larger amount. The 
third system is called progressive because high-income taxpayers pay a larger 
fraction of their income.
Which of these three tax systems is most fair? There is no obvious answer, and 
economic theory does not offer any help in trying to find one. Equity, like beauty, 
is in the eye of the beholder.

HOW THE TAX BURDEN IS DISTRIBUTED
The debate over tax policy often concerns whether the wealthy pay 
their fair share. There is no objective way to make this judgment. In 
evaluating the issue for yourself, however, it is useful to know how 
much families with different incomes pay under the current tax system.
Table 5 presents some data on how federal taxes are distributed among income 
classes. These figures are for 2011, the most recent year available as this book was 
going to press, and were tabulated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
They include all federal taxes—personal income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate 
income taxes, and excise taxes—but not state and local taxes. When calculating a 
household’s tax burden, the CBO allocates corporate income taxes to the owners 
of capital and payroll taxes to workers.
To construct the table, households are ranked according to their income and 
placed into five groups of equal size, called quintiles. The table also presents data 
on the richest 1 percent of Americans. The second column of the table shows the 
average income of each group. Income includes both market income (income that 
households have earned from their work and savings) and transfer payments 
from government programs, such as Social Security and welfare. The poorest one-
fifth of households had average income of $24,600, and the richest one-fifth had 
average income of $245,700. The richest 1 percent had average income of over $1.4 
million.
The third column of the table shows total taxes as a percentage of income. As you 
can see, the U.S. federal tax system is progressive. The poorest fifth of households 
paid 1.9 percent of their incomes in taxes, and the richest fifth paid 23.4 percent. 
The top 1 percent paid 29.0 percent of their incomes.
The fourth and fifth columns compare the distribution of income with the dis-
tribution of taxes. The poorest quintile earned 5.3 percent of all income and paid 
0.6 percent of all taxes. The richest quintile earned 51.9 percent of all income and 
paid 68.7 percent of all taxes. The richest 1 percent (which, remember, is ½0 the size 
of each quintile) earned 14.6 percent of all income and paid 24.0 percent of all taxes.
These numbers on taxes paid are a good starting point for understanding how 
the burden of government is distributed, but they give an incomplete picture. 
Money flows not only from households to the government in the form of taxes 
but also from the government back to households in the form of transfer pay-
ments. In some ways, transfer payments are the opposite of taxes. Including trans-
fers as negative taxes substantially changes the distribution of the tax burden.

CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
The richest quintile of households still pays about one-quarter of its  income to 
the government, even after transfers are subtracted, and the top 1 percent still 
pays  almost 30  percent. By contrast, the average tax rate for the poorest quintile 
 becomes a sizeable negative number. That is, typical households in the bottom 
of the income distribution receive substantially more in transfers than they pay 
in taxes. The lesson is clear: To understand fully the progressivity of government 
policies, one must take into account both what people pay and what they receive.
Finally, it is worth noting that the numbers in Table 5 are a bit out of date. In 
late 2012, the U.S. Congress passed and President Obama signed a tax bill that 
 increased taxes significantly from those that prevailed previously, particularly for 
taxpayers at the top of the income distribution. As a result, the tax system in place 
for 2013 and beyond is more progressive than the one shown in the table. The Con-
gressional Budget Office projects that for the top 1 percent, taxes as a percentage of 
income increased from 29.0 to 33.3 percent. ●
Horizontal Equity  If taxes are based on ability to pay, then similar taxpayers 
should pay similar amounts of taxes. But what determines if two taxpayers are 
similar? Families differ in many ways. To evaluate whether a tax code is horizon-
tally equitable, one must determine which differences are relevant for a family’s 
ability to pay and which differences are not.
Suppose the Smith and Jones families each have income of $100,000. The Smiths 
have no children, but Mr. Smith has an illness that results in medical expenses of 
$40,000. The Joneses are in good health, but they have four children. Two of the 
Jones children are in college, generating tuition bills of $60,000. Would it be fair 
for these two families to pay the same tax because they have the same income? 
Would it be fair to give the Smiths a tax break to help them offset their high med-
ical expenses? Would it be fair to give the Joneses a tax break to help them with 
their tuition expenses?
There are no easy answers to these questions. In practice, the U.S. tax code is 
filled with special provisions that alter a family’s tax obligations based on its spe-
cific circumstances. 
12-3c Tax Incidence and Tax Equity
Tax incidence—the study of who bears the burden of taxes—is central to evaluat-
ing tax equity. As we first saw in Chapter 6, the person who bears the burden of 
a tax is not always the person who gets the tax bill from the government. Because 
taxes alter supply and demand, they alter equilibrium prices. As a result, they 
affect people beyond those who, according to statute, actually pay the tax. When 
evaluating the vertical and horizontal equity of any tax, it is important to take 
these indirect effects into account.
Many discussions of tax equity ignore the indirect effects of taxes and are based 
on what economists mockingly call the flypaper theory of tax incidence. According 
to this theory, the burden of a tax, like a fly on flypaper, sticks wherever it first 
lands. This assumption, however, is rarely valid. 
For example, a person not trained in economics might argue that a tax on 
 expensive fur coats is vertically equitable because most buyers of furs are wealthy. 
Yet if these buyers can easily substitute other luxuries for furs, then a tax on furs 
might only reduce the sale of furs. In the end, the burden of the tax will fall more 
on those who make and sell furs than on those who buy them. Because most 
workers who make furs are not wealthy, the equity of a fur tax could be quite dif-
ferent from what the flypaper theory indicates.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
CASE 
STUDY
WHO PAYS THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX?
The corporate income tax provides a good example of the importance 
of tax incidence for tax policy. The corporate tax is popular among 
voters. After all, corporations are not people. Voters are  always eager 
to get a tax cut and let some impersonal corporation pick up the tab.
But before deciding that the corporate income tax is a good way for the govern-
ment to raise revenue, we should consider who bears the burden of the  corporate 
tax. This is a difficult question on which economists disagree, but one thing is 
certain: People pay all taxes. When the government levies a tax on a corporation, 
the corporation is more like a tax collector than a taxpayer. The burden of the tax 
ultimately falls on people—the owners, customers, or workers of the corporation.
Many economists believe that workers and customers bear much of the burden 
of the corporate income tax. To see why, consider an example. Suppose that the 
U.S. government decides to raise the tax on the income earned by car companies. 
At first, this tax hurts the owners of the car companies, who receive less profit. 
Tax reformers and deficit hawks of-
ten suggest reducing the deductions, 
credits, and exclusions that narrow 
the tax base.
The Blur between Spending  
and Taxes
By N. Gregory Mankiw
S
hould the government cut spending or 
raise taxes to deal with its long-term fis-
cal imbalance? As President Obama’s deficit 
commission rolls out its final report in the 
coming weeks, this issue will most likely 
 divide the political right and left. But, in many 
ways, the question is the wrong one. The dis-
tinction between spending and taxation is 
 often murky and sometimes meaningless. 
Imagine that there is some activity—say, 
snipe hunting—that members of Congress 
want to encourage. Senator Porkbelly proposes 
a government subsidy. “America needs more 
snipe hunters,” he says. “I propose that every 
time an American bags a snipe, the federal 
government should pay him or her $100.” 
“No, no,” says Congressman Blowhard. 
“The Porkbelly plan would increase the size of 
an already bloated government. Let’s instead 
reduce the burden of taxation. I propose that 
every time an American tracks down a snipe, 
the hunter should get a $100 credit to reduce 
his or her tax liabilities.” 
To be sure, government accountants may 
treat the Porkbelly and Blowhard plans differ-
ently. They would likely deem the subsidy to 
be a spending increase and the credit to be a 
tax cut. Moreover, the rhetoric of the two poli-
ticians about spending and taxes may appeal 
to different political bases. 
But it hardly takes an economic genius to 
see how little difference there is between the 
two plans. Both policies enrich the nation’s 
snipe hunters. And because the government 
must balance its books, at least in the long 
run, the gains of the snipe hunters must come 
at the cost of higher taxes or lower govern-
ment benefits for the rest of us. 
Economists call the Blowhard plan a “tax 
expenditure.” The tax code is filled with them 
—although not yet one for snipe hunting. 
 Every time a politician promises a “targeted 
tax cut,” he or she is probably offering up a 
form of government spending in disguise. 
Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson, 
the chairmen of President Obama’s deficit 
 reduction commission, have taken at hard look 
at these tax expenditures —and they don’t like 
what they see. In their draft proposal,  released 
earlier this month, they proposed doing away 
with tax expenditures, which together cost the 
Treasury over $1 trillion a year. 
Such a drastic step would allow Mr. Bowles 
and Mr. Simpson to move the budget toward 
fiscal sustainability, while simultaneously 
 reducing all income tax rates. Under their 
plan, the top tax rate would fall to 23 percent 
from the 35 percent in today’s law (and the 
39.6 percent currently advocated by Demo-
cratic leadership). 
This approach has long been the basic rec-
ipe for tax reform. By broadening the tax base 
and lowering tax rates, we can increase gov-
ernment revenue and distort incentives less. 
That should command widespread applause 
across the ideological spectrum. Unfortu-
nately, the reaction has been less enthusiastic. 
Pundits on the left are suspicious of any 
plan that reduces marginal tax rates on the 
rich. But, as Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson point

CHAPTER 12   THE DESIGN OF THE TAX SYSTEM
out, tax expenditures disproportionately ben-
efit those at the top of the economic ladder. 
According to their figures, tax expenditures 
increase the after-tax income of those in the 
bottom quintile by about 6 percent. Those in the 
top 1 percent of the income distribution  enjoy 
about twice that gain. Progressives who are 
concerned about the gap between rich and poor 
should be eager to scale back tax expenditures. 
Pundits on the right, meanwhile, are sus-
picious of anything that increases government 
revenue. But they should recognize that tax 
expenditures are best viewed as a hidden form 
of spending. If we eliminate tax expenditures 
and reduce marginal tax rates, as Mr. Bowles 
and Mr. Simpson propose, we are essentially 
doing what economic conservatives have long 
advocated: cutting spending and taxes. 
Yet another political problem is that each 
tax expenditure has its own political constit-
uency. If Congressman Blowhard ever got his 
way, the snipe hunters of the world would 
surely fight to keep their tax break. 
One major tax expenditure that the 
Bowles-Simpson plan would curtail or elim-
inate is the mortgage interest deduction. 
Without doubt, many homeowners and the 
real estate industry will object. But they won’t 
have the merits on their side. 
This subsidy to homeownership is neither 
economically efficient nor particularly equita-
ble. Economists have long pointed out that tax 
subsidies to housing, together with the high 
taxes on corporations, cause too much of the 
economy’s capital stock to be tied up in res-
idential structures and too little in corporate 
capital. This misallocation of resources results 
in lower productivity and reduced real wages.
Moreover, there is nothing particularly 
 ignoble about renting that deserves the scorn 
of the tax code. But let’s face it: subsidizing 
homeowners is the same as penalizing renters. 
In the end, someone has to pick up the tab. 
There are certain tax expenditures that I 
like. My personal favorite is the deduction for 
charitable giving. It encourages philanthropy 
and, thus, private rather than governmental 
solutions to society’s problems. 
But I know that solving the long-term fiscal 
problem won’t be easy. Everyone will have to 
give a little, and perhaps even more than a lit-
tle. I am willing to give up my favorite tax expen-
diture if everyone else is willing to give up theirs.
The Bowles-Simpson proposal is not per-
fect, but it is far better than the status quo. 
The question ahead is whether we can get 
Senator Porkbelly and Congressman Blowhard 
to agree. ■

But over time, these owners will respond to the tax. Because pro-
ducing cars is less profitable, they invest less in building new 
car factories. Instead, they invest their wealth in other ways—for 
example, by buying larger houses or by building factories in other 
industries or other countries. With fewer car factories, the supply 
of cars declines, as does the demand for autoworkers. Thus, a tax 
on corporations making cars causes the price of cars to rise and 
the wages of  autoworkers to fall. 
The corporate income tax shows how dangerous the flypaper 
theory of tax incidence can be. The corporate income tax is popular 
in part because it appears to be paid by rich corporations. Yet those 
who bear the ultimate burden of the tax—the customers and workers 
of corporations—are often not rich. If the true incidence of the cor-
porate tax were more widely known, this tax might be less popular 
among voters. ●

12-4 Conclusion: The Trade-off between Equity and Efficiency
Almost everyone agrees that equity and efficiency are the two most important 
goals of a tax system. But these two goals often conflict, especially when equity 
is judged by the progressivity of the tax system. People often disagree about tax 
policy because they attach different weights to these goals.
The recent history of tax policy shows how political leaders differ in their views 
on equity and efficiency. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the 
marginal tax rate on the earnings of the richest Americans was 50 percent. On 
 interest income, the marginal tax rate was 70 percent. Reagan argued that such high 
tax rates greatly distorted economic incentives to work and save. In other words, 
he claimed that these high tax rates cost too much in terms of economic efficiency. 
Tax reform was, therefore, a high priority of his administration. Reagan signed into 
law large cuts in tax rates in 1981 and then again in 1986. When Reagan left office in 
1989, the richest Americans faced a marginal tax rate of only 28 percent.
The pendulum of political debate swings both ways. When Bill Clinton ran for 
president in 1992, he argued that the rich were not paying their fair share of taxes. 
In other words, the low tax rates on the rich violated his view of vertical equity. In 
1993, President Clinton signed into law a bill that raised the tax rates on the richest 
Americans to about 40 percent. When George W. Bush ran for president, he reprised 
many of Reagan’s themes, and as president he reversed part of the Clinton tax in-
crease, reducing the highest tax rate to 35 percent. Barack Obama pledged during 
the 2008 presidential campaign that he would raise taxes on high-income house-
holds, and starting in 2013 the top marginal tax rate was back at about 40 percent.
Economics alone cannot determine the best way to balance the goals of effi-
ciency and equity. This issue involves political philosophy as well as economics. 
But economists have an important role in this debate: They can shed light on the 
trade-offs that society inevitably faces when designing the tax system and can help 
us avoid policies that sacrifice efficiency without any benefit in terms of equity.

KEY CONCEPTS
SUMMARY
• The U.S. government raises revenue using various 
taxes. The most important taxes for the federal gov-
ernment are personal income taxes and payroll taxes 
for social insurance. The most important taxes for 
state and local governments are sales taxes and prop-
erty taxes.
• The efficiency of a tax system refers to the costs it 
 imposes on taxpayers. There are two costs of taxes 
 beyond the transfer of resources from the taxpayer to 
the government. The first is the deadweight loss that 
arises as taxes alter incentives and distort the  allocation 
of resources. The second is the administrative  burden 
of complying with the tax laws.
• The equity of a tax system concerns whether the 
tax burden is distributed fairly among the popula-
tion.  According to the benefits principle, it is fair for 
people to pay taxes based on the benefits they receive 
from the government. According to the ability-to-pay 
principle, it is fair for people to pay taxes based on 
their capability to handle the financial burden. When 
evaluating the  equity of a tax system, it is important 
to remember a lesson from the study of tax incidence: 
The distribution of tax burdens is not the same as the 
distribution of tax bills.
• When considering changes in the tax laws, policy-
makers often face a trade-off between efficiency and 
 equity. Much of the debate over tax policy arises 
 because  people give different weights to these two 
goals.

PART IV   THE ECONOMICS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
1. The information in many of the tables in this chapter 
can be found in the Economic Report of the President, 
which appears annually. Using a recent issue of the 
report at your library or on the Internet, answer the 
following questions and provide some numbers 
to support your answers. (Hint: The website of the 
 Government Printing Office is http://www.gpo.gov.)
a. Figure 1 shows that government revenue as a per-
centage of total income has increased over time. Is 
this increase primarily attributable to changes in 
federal government revenue or in state and local 
government revenue?
b. Looking at the combined revenue of the federal 
government and state and local governments, 
how has the composition of total revenue changed 
over time? Are personal income taxes more or 
less important? Social insurance taxes? Corporate 
profits taxes?
2. Suppose you are a typical person in the U.S. economy. 
You pay 4 percent of your income in a state income 
tax and 15.3 percent of your labor earnings in federal 
payroll taxes (employer and employee shares com-
bined). You also pay federal income taxes as in Table 2. 
How much tax of each type do you pay if you earn 
$30,000 a year? Taking all taxes into account, what are 
your average and marginal tax rates? What happens 
to your tax bill and to your average and marginal tax 
rates if your income rises to $60,000?
3. Some states exclude necessities, such as food and 
clothing, from their sales tax. Other states do not. 
Discuss the merits of this exclusion. Consider both 
efficiency and equity.
4. When someone owns an asset (such as a share of 
stock) that rises in value, he has an “accrued” capital 
gain. If he sells the asset, he “realizes” the gains that 
have previously accrued. Under the U.S. income tax 
system, realized capital gains are taxed, but accrued 
gains are not. 
a. Explain how individuals’ behavior is affected by 
this rule. 
b. Some economists believe that cuts in capital gains 
tax rates, especially temporary ones, can raise tax 
revenue. How might this be so?
c. Do you think it is a good rule to tax realized but 
not accrued capital gains? Why or why not?
5. Suppose that your state raises its sales tax from 
5  percent to 6 percent. The state revenue commissioner 
forecasts a 20 percent increase in sales tax revenue. 
Is this plausible? Explain.
6. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the deduct-
ibility of interest payments on consumer debt (mostly 
credit cards and auto loans) but maintained the 
 deductibility of interest payments on mortgages and 
home equity loans. What do you think happened to 
the relative amounts of borrowing through consumer 
debt and home equity debt?
7. Categorize each of the following funding schemes as 
examples of the benefits principle or the ability-to-pay 
principle.
a. Visitors to many national parks pay an 
entrance fee.
b. Local property taxes support elementary and 
 secondary schools.
c. An airport trust fund collects a tax on each 
plane ticket sold and uses the money to improve 
 airports and the air traffic control system.

and search for “Mankiw.”
PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS
1. Over the past century, has the government’s tax rev-
enue grown more or less slowly than the rest of the 
economy?
2. Explain how corporate profits are taxed twice.
3. Why is the burden of a tax to taxpayers greater than 
the revenue received by the government?
4. Why do some economists advocate taxing 
 consumption rather than income?
5. What is the marginal tax rate on a lump-sum tax? 
How is this related to the efficiency of the tax?
6. Give two arguments why wealthy taxpayers should 
pay more taxes than poor taxpayers.
7. What is the concept of horizontal equity and why is it 
hard to apply?

The Costs of Production
T
he economy is made up of thousands of firms that produce the goods and 
services you enjoy every day: General Motors produces automobiles, General 
Electric produces lightbulbs, and General Mills produces breakfast cereals. 
Some firms, such as these three, are large; they employ thousands of workers and 
have thousands of stockholders who share the firms’ profits. Other firms, such as 
the local barbershop or café, are small; they employ only a few workers and are 
owned by a single person or family.
In previous chapters, we used the supply curve to summarize firms’ produc-
tion decisions. According to the law of supply, firms are willing to produce

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
and sell a greater quantity of a good when the price of the good is higher. This 
response leads to a supply curve that slopes upward. For analyzing many ques-
tions, the law of supply is all you need to know about firm behavior.
In this chapter and the ones that follow, we examine firm behavior in more 
detail. This topic will give you a better understanding of the decisions behind 
the supply curve. In addition, it will introduce you to a part of economics called 
industrial organization—the study of how firms’ decisions about prices and quan-
tities depend on the market conditions they face. The town in which you live, for 
instance, may have several pizzerias but only one cable television company. This 
raises a key question: How does the number of firms affect the prices in a  market 
and the efficiency of the market outcome? The field of industrial organization 
 addresses exactly this question.
Before turning to these issues, we need to discuss the costs of production. All 
firms, from Delta Air Lines to your local deli, incur costs while making the goods 
and services that they sell. As we will see in the coming chapters, a firm’s costs 
are a key determinant of its production and pricing decisions. In this chapter, we 
define some of the variables that economists use to measure a firm’s costs, and we 
consider the relationships among these variables. 
A word of warning: This topic is dry and technical. To be honest, one might 
even call it boring. But this material provides a crucial foundation for the fascinat-
ing topics that follow. 
13-1 What Are Costs?
We begin our discussion of costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory. Caroline, the owner 
of the firm, buys flour, sugar, chocolate chips, and other cookie ingredients. She 
also buys the mixers and ovens and hires workers to run this equipment. She then 
sells the cookies to consumers. By examining some of the issues that Caroline 
faces in her business, we can learn some lessons about costs that apply to all firms 
in an economy.
13-1a Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit
We begin with the firm’s objective. To understand the decisions a firm makes, we 
must understand what it is trying to do. Although it is conceivable that Caroline 
started her firm because of an altruistic desire to provide the world with cookies 
or, perhaps, out of love for the cookie business, it is more likely that she started 
the business to make money. Economists normally assume that the goal of a firm 
is to maximize profit, and they find that this assumption works well in most cases.
What is a firm’s profit? The amount that the firm receives for the sale of its out-
put (cookies) is called total revenue. The amount that the firm pays to buy inputs 
(flour, sugar, workers, ovens, and so forth) is called total cost. Caroline gets to 
keep any revenue that is not needed to cover costs. Profit is a firm’s total revenue 
minus its total cost: 
Profit 5 Total revenue 2 Total cost
Caroline’s objective is to make her firm’s profit as large as possible.
To see how a firm goes about maximizing profit, we must consider fully how to 
measure its total revenue and its total cost. Total revenue is the easy part: It equals 
the quantity of output the firm produces multiplied by the price at which it sells its 
total revenue
the amount a firm 
receives for the sale  
of its output
total cost
the market value  
of the inputs a firm  
uses in production
profit
total revenue minus  
total cost

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
output. If Caroline produces 10,000 cookies and sells them at $2 a cookie, her total 
revenue is $20,000. The measurement of a firm’s total cost, however, is more subtle.
13-1b Costs as Opportunity Costs
When measuring costs at Caroline’s Cookie Factory or any other firm, it is import-
ant to keep in mind one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: The cost 
of something is what you give up to get it. Recall that the opportunity cost of an 
item refers to all the things that must be forgone to acquire that item. When econ-
omists speak of a firm’s cost of production, they include all the opportunity costs 
of making its output of goods and services.
While some of a firm’s opportunity costs of production are obvious, others are 
less so. When Caroline pays $1,000 for flour, that $1,000 is an opportunity cost 
because Caroline can no longer use that $1,000 to buy something else. Similarly, 
when Caroline hires workers to make the cookies, the wages she pays are part of 
the firm’s costs. Because these opportunity costs require the firm to pay out some 
money, they are called explicit costs. By contrast, some of a firm’s opportunity 
costs, called implicit costs, do not require a cash outlay. Imagine that Caroline 
is skilled with computers and could earn $100 per hour working as a program-
mer. For every hour that Caroline works at her cookie factory, she gives up $100 
in  income, and this forgone income is also part of her costs. The total cost of 
 Caroline’s business is the sum of her explicit and implicit costs.
The distinction between explicit and implicit costs highlights an important 
difference between how economists and accountants analyze a business. Econo-
mists are interested in studying how firms make production and pricing decisions. 
 Because these decisions are based on both explicit and implicit costs, economists 
include both when measuring a firm’s costs. By contrast, accountants have the job 
of keeping track of the money that flows into and out of firms. As a result, they 
measure the explicit costs but usually ignore the implicit costs.
The difference between the methods of economists and accountants is easy to 
see in the case of Caroline’s Cookie Factory. When Caroline gives up the oppor-
tunity to earn money as a computer programmer, her accountant will not count 
this as a cost of her cookie business. Because no money flows out of the business 
to pay for this cost, it never shows up on the accountant’s financial statements. 
An economist, however, will count the forgone income as a cost because it will 
affect the decisions that Caroline makes in her cookie business. For example, if 
Caroline’s wage as a computer programmer rises from $100 to $500 per hour, she 
might decide that running her cookie business is too costly. She might choose to 
shut down the factory so she can take a job as a programmer.
13-1c The Cost of Capital as an Opportunity Cost
An important implicit cost of almost every business is the opportunity cost of the 
financial capital that has been invested in the business. Suppose, for instance, that 
Caroline used $300,000 of her savings to buy the cookie factory from its previous 
owner. If Caroline had instead left this money in a savings account that pays an 
interest rate of 5 percent, she would have earned $15,000 per year. To own her 
cookie factory, therefore, Caroline has given up $15,000 a year in interest income. 
This forgone $15,000 is one of the implicit opportunity costs of Caroline’s business.
As we have already noted, economists and accountants treat costs differently, 
and this is especially true in their treatment of the cost of capital. An economist 
views the $15,000 in interest income that Caroline gives up every year as an 
explicit costs
input costs that require 
an outlay of money by  
the firm
implicit costs
input costs that do not 
require an outlay of 
money by the firm

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
implicit cost of her business. Caroline’s accountant, however, will not show this 
$15,000 as a cost because no money flows out of the business to pay for it.
To further explore the difference between the methods of economists and 
accountants, let’s change the example slightly. Suppose now that Caroline did 
not have the entire $300,000 to buy the factory but, instead, used $100,000 of her 
own savings and borrowed $200,000 from a bank at an interest rate of 5 percent. 
Caroline’s accountant, who only measures explicit costs, will now count the 
$10,000 interest paid on the bank loan every year as a cost because this amount 
of money now flows out of the firm. By contrast, according to an economist, the 
opportunity cost of owning the business is still $15,000. The opportunity cost 
equals the interest on the bank loan (an explicit cost of $10,000) plus the forgone 
interest on savings (an implicit cost of $5,000). 
13-1d Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit
Now let’s return to the firm’s objective: profit. Because economists and accoun-
tants measure costs differently, they also measure profit differently. An econo-
mist measures a firm’s economic profit as the firm’s total revenue minus all the 
opportunity costs (explicit and implicit) of producing the goods and services sold. 
An accountant measures the firm’s accounting profit as the firm’s total revenue 
minus only the firm’s explicit costs. 
Figure 1 summarizes this difference. Notice that because the accountant 
ignores the implicit costs, accounting profit is usually larger than economic profit. 
For a business to be profitable from an economist’s standpoint, total revenue must 
exceed all the opportunity costs, both explicit and implicit. 
Economic profit is an important concept because it motivates the firms that 
supply goods and services. As we will see, a firm making positive economic profit 
will stay in business. It is covering all its opportunity costs and has some reve-
nue left to reward the firm owners. When a firm is making economic losses (that 
is, when economic profits are negative), the business owners are failing to earn 
enough revenue to cover all the costs of production. Unless conditions change, 
economic profit
total revenue minus  total 
cost, including both 
explicit and implicit costs
accounting profit
total revenue minus total 
explicit cost
FIGURE 1
Economists versus Accountants
Economists include all opportunity 
costs when analyzing a firm, whereas 
accountants measure only explicit 
costs. Therefore, economic profit is 
smaller than accounting profit.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
the firm owners will eventually close down the business and exit the industry. To 
understand business decisions, we need to keep an eye on economic profit.
QuickQuiz
Farmer McDonald gives banjo lessons for $20 an hour. One day, he spends 
10 hours planting $100 worth of seeds on his farm. What opportunity 
cost has he incurred? What cost would his accountant measure? If these seeds yield $200 
worth of crops, does McDonald earn an accounting profit? Does he earn an economic profit? 
13-2 Production and Costs 
Firms incur costs when they buy inputs to produce the goods and services that 
they plan to sell. In this section, we examine the link between a firm’s production 
process and its total cost. Once again, we consider Caroline’s Cookie Factory.
In the analysis that follows, we make an important simplifying assumption: 
We assume that the size of Caroline’s factory is fixed and that Caroline can vary 
the quantity of cookies produced only by changing the number of workers she 
employs. This assumption is realistic in the short run but not in the long run. That 
is, Caroline cannot build a larger factory overnight, but she could do so over the 
next year or two. This analysis, therefore, describes the production decisions that 
Caroline faces in the short run. We examine the relationship between costs and 
time horizon more fully later in the chapter.
13-2a The Production Function
Table 1 shows how the quantity of cookies produced per hour at  Caroline’s 
 factory depends on the number of workers. As you can see in columns 
(1) and (2), if there are no workers in the factory, Caroline produces no cookies.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
When there is 1 worker, she produces 50 cookies. When there are 2 workers, 
she produces 90 cookies and so on. Panel (a) of Figure 2 presents a graph of 
these two columns of numbers. The number of workers is on the horizontal 
axis, and the number of cookies produced is on the vertical axis. This relation-
ship between the quantity of inputs (workers) and quantity of output (cookies) 
is called the  production function.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that ratio-
nal people think at the margin. As we will see in future chapters, this idea is 
the key to understanding the decisions a firm makes about how many workers 
to hire and how much output to produce. To take a step toward understanding 
these decisions, column (3) in the table gives the marginal product of a worker. 
The marginal product of any input in the production process is the increase in 
the quantity of output obtained from one additional unit of that input. When the 
number of workers goes from 1 to 2, cookie production increases from 50 to 90, so 
the marginal product of the second worker is 40 cookies. And when the number of

Caroline’s Production 
Function and Total-Cost

The production function in panel (a) shows the relationship between the number of workers 
hired and the quantity of output produced. Here the number of workers hired (on the horizon-
tal axis) is from column (1) in Table 1, and the quantity of output produced (on the vertical 
axis) is from column (2). The production function gets flatter as the number of workers  
increases, reflecting diminishing marginal product. The total-cost curve in panel (b) shows 
the relationship between the quantity of output produced and total cost of production.  
Here the quantity of output produced (on the horizontal axis) is from column (2) in Table 1, 
and the total cost (on the vertical axis) is from column (6). The total-cost curve gets steeper 
as the quantity of output increases because of diminishing marginal product.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
workers goes from 2 to 3, cookie production increases from 90 to 120, so the mar-
ginal product of the third worker is 30 cookies. In the table, the marginal product 
is shown halfway between two rows because it represents the change in output as 
the number of workers increases from one level to another.
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product declines. 
The second worker has a marginal product of 40 cookies, the third worker has 
a marginal product of 30 cookies, and the fourth worker has a marginal prod-
uct of 20 cookies. This property is called diminishing marginal product. At first, 
when only a few workers are hired, they have easy access to Caroline’s kitchen 
equipment. As the number of workers increases, additional workers have to 
share equipment and work in more crowded conditions. Eventually, the kitchen 
 becomes so overcrowded that workers often get in each other’s way. Hence, as 
more workers are hired, each additional worker contributes fewer additional 
cookies to total production. 
Diminishing marginal product is also apparent in Figure 2. The produc-
tion function’s slope (“rise over run”) tells us the change in Caroline’s output 
of cookies (“rise”) for each additional input of labor (“run”). That is, the slope 
of the production function measures the marginal product. As the number of 
workers increases, the marginal product declines, and the production function 
becomes flatter.
13-2b From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve
Columns (4), (5), and (6) in Table 1 show Caroline’s cost of producing cookies. 
In this example, the cost of Caroline’s factory is $30 per hour, and the cost of a 
worker is $10 per hour. If she hires 1 worker, her total cost is $40 per hour. If she 
hires 2 workers, her total cost is $50 per hour, and so on. With this information, 
the table now shows how the number of workers Caroline hires is related to the 
quantity of cookies she produces and to her total cost of production.
Our goal in the next several chapters is to study firms’ production and pricing 
decisions. For this purpose, the most important relationship in Table 1 is between 
quantity produced [in column (2)] and total cost [in column (6)]. Panel (b) of Figure 2 
graphs these two columns of data with quantity produced on the horizontal axis 
and total cost on the vertical axis. This graph is called the total-cost curve.
Now compare the total-cost curve in panel (b) with the production function 
in panel (a). These two curves are opposite sides of the same coin. The total-cost 
curve gets steeper as the amount produced rises, whereas the production function 
gets flatter as production rises. These changes in slope occur for the same rea-
son. High production of cookies means that Caroline’s kitchen is crowded with 
many workers. Because the kitchen is crowded, each additional worker adds less 
to production, reflecting diminishing marginal product. Therefore, the production 
function is relatively flat. But now turn this logic around: When the kitchen is 
crowded, producing an additional cookie requires a lot of additional labor and 
is thus very costly. Therefore, when the quantity produced is large, the total-cost 
curve is relatively steep.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Our analysis of Caroline’s Cookie Factory demonstrated how a firm’s total cost 
reflects its production function. From data on a firm’s total cost, we can derive 
several related measures of cost, which will turn out to be useful when we ana-
lyze production and pricing decisions in future chapters. To see how these related 
measures are derived, we consider the example in Table 2. This table presents cost 
data on Caroline’s neighbor—Conrad’s Coffee Shop.
Column (1) in the table shows the number of cups of coffee that Conrad might 
produce, ranging from 0 to 10 cups per hour. Column (2) shows Conrad’s total 
cost of producing coffee. Figure 3 plots Conrad’s total-cost curve. The quantity of 
coffee [from column (1)] is on the horizontal axis, and total cost [from column (2)] 
is on the vertical axis. Conrad’s total-cost curve has a shape similar to Caroline’s. 
In particular, it becomes steeper as the quantity produced rises, which (as we have 
discussed) reflects diminishing marginal product.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
13-3a Fixed and Variable Costs
Conrad’s total cost can be divided into two types. Some costs, called fixed costs, 
do not vary with the quantity of output produced. They are incurred even if 
the firm produces nothing at all. Conrad’s fixed costs include any rent he pays 
because this cost is the same regardless of how much coffee he produces. Sim-
ilarly, if Conrad needs to hire a full-time bookkeeper to pay bills, regardless of 
the quantity of coffee produced, the bookkeeper’s salary is a fixed cost. The third 
column in Table 2 shows Conrad’s fixed cost, which in this example is $3.00.
Some of the firm’s costs, called variable costs, change as the firm alters the quan-
tity of output produced. Conrad’s variable costs include the cost of coffee beans, 
milk, sugar, and paper cups: The more cups of coffee Conrad makes, the more of 
these items he needs to buy. Similarly, if Conrad has to hire more workers to make 
more cups of coffee, the salaries of these workers are variable costs. Column (4) in 
the table shows Conrad’s variable cost. The variable cost is 0 if he produces noth-
ing, $0.30 if he produces 1 cup of coffee, $0.80 if he produces 2 cups, and so on.
A firm’s total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs. In Table 2, total cost in 
column (2) equals fixed cost in column (3) plus variable cost in column (4).
13-3b Average and Marginal Cost
As the owner of his firm, Conrad has to decide how much to produce. One issue 
he will want to consider when making this decision is how the level of production 
affects his firm’s costs. Conrad might ask his production supervisor the following 
two questions about the cost of producing coffee:
• How much does it cost to make the typical cup of coffee?
• How much does it cost to increase production of coffee by 1 cup?

costs that do not vary 
with the quantity of

Conrad’s Total-Cost Curve
Here the quantity of output produced (on the  
horizontal axis) is from column (1) in Table 2, 
and the total cost (on the vertical axis) is from 
column (2). As in Figure 2, the total-cost curve 
gets steeper as the quantity of output increases 
because of diminishing marginal product.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
These two questions might seem to have the same answer, but they do not. Both 
answers are important for understanding how firms make production decisions.
To find the cost of the typical unit produced, we divide the firm’s costs by the 
quantity of output it produces. For example, if the firm produces 2 cups of coffee 
per hour, its total cost is $3.80, and the cost of the typical cup is $3.80/2, or $1.90. 
Total cost divided by the quantity of output is called average total cost. Because 
total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs, average total cost can be expressed 
as the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost is 
the fixed cost divided by the quantity of output, and average variable cost is the 
variable cost divided by the quantity of output.
Average total cost tells us the cost of the typical unit, but it does not tell us how 
much total cost will change as the firm alters its level of production. Column (8) in 
Table 2 shows the amount that total cost rises when the firm increases production 
by 1 unit of output. This number is called marginal cost. For example, if Conrad 
increases production from 2 to 3 cups, total cost rises from $3.80 to $4.50, so the 
marginal cost of the third cup of coffee is $4.50 minus $3.80, or $0.70. In the table, 
the marginal cost appears halfway between any two rows because it represents 
the change in total cost as quantity of output increases from one level to another.
It may be helpful to express these definitions mathematically:
Average total cost 5 Total cost/Quantity 
ATC 5 TC/Q,
and
Marginal cost 5 Change in total cost/Change in quantity 
MC 5 ΔTC/ΔQ
Here Δ, the Greek letter delta, represents the change in a variable. These equa-
tions show how average total cost and marginal cost are derived from total cost. 
Average total cost tells us the cost of a typical unit of output if total cost is divided evenly 
over all the units produced. Marginal cost tells us the increase in total cost that arises 
from producing an additional unit of output. As we will see more fully in the next 
chapter, business managers like Conrad need to keep in mind the concepts of 
average total cost and marginal cost when deciding how much of their product to 
supply to the market. 
13-3c Cost Curves and Their Shapes
Just as we found graphs of supply and demand useful when analyzing the behav-
ior of markets in previous chapters, we will find graphs of average and marginal 
cost useful when analyzing the behavior of firms. Figure 4 graphs Conrad’s costs 
using the data from Table 2. The horizontal axis measures the quantity the firm 
produces, and the vertical axis measures marginal and average costs. The graph 
shows four curves: average total cost (ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average 
variable cost (AVC), and marginal cost (MC). 
The cost curves shown here for Conrad’s Coffee Shop have some features 
that are common to the cost curves of many firms in the economy. Let’s exam-
ine three features in particular: the shape of the marginal-cost curve, the shape 
of the  average-total-cost curve, and the relationship between marginal cost and  
average total cost.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
Rising Marginal Cost  Conrad’s marginal cost rises as the quantity of output pro-
duced increases. This upward slope reflects the property of diminishing marginal 
product. When Conrad produces a small quantity of coffee, he has few  workers, 
and much of his equipment is not used. Because he can easily put these idle 
 resources to use, the marginal product of an extra worker is large, and the mar-
ginal cost of an extra cup of coffee is small. By contrast, when Conrad produces 
a large quantity of coffee, his shop is crowded with workers, and most of his 
 equipment is fully utilized. Conrad can produce more coffee by adding workers, 
but these new workers have to work in crowded conditions and may have to wait 
to use the equipment. Therefore, when the quantity of coffee produced is already 
high, the marginal product of an extra worker is low, and the marginal cost of an 
extra cup of coffee is large.
U-Shaped Average Total Cost  Conrad’s average-total-cost curve is U-shaped, as 
shown in Figure 4. To understand why, remember that average total cost is the 
sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost always 
declines as output rises because the fixed cost is getting spread over a larger num-
ber of units. Average variable cost usually rises as output increases because of 
diminishing marginal product. 
Average total cost reflects the shapes of both average fixed cost and average 
variable cost. At very low levels of output, such as 1 or 2 cups per hour, average 
total cost is very high. Even though average variable cost is low, average fixed 
cost is high because the fixed cost is spread over only a few units. As output

Marginal-Cost Curves
This figure shows the average total 
cost (ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), 
average variable cost (AVC), and 
marginal cost (MC) for Conrad’s  
Coffee Shop. All of these curves  
are obtained by graphing the data 
in Table 2. These cost curves show 
three common features: (1) Marginal 
cost rises with the quantity of out-
put. (2) The average-total-cost curve 
is U-shaped. (3) The marginal-cost 
curve crosses the average-total-cost 
curve at the minimum of average 
total cost.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
increases, the fixed cost is spread over more units. Average fixed cost declines, 
rapidly at first and then more slowly. As a result, average total cost also declines 
until the firm’s output reaches 5 cups of coffee per hour, when average total cost 
is $1.30 per cup. When the firm produces more than 6 cups per hour, however, the 
increase in average variable cost becomes the dominant force, and average total 
cost starts rising. The tug of war between average fixed cost and average variable 
cost generates the U-shape in average total cost.
The bottom of the U-shape occurs at the quantity that minimizes average total 
cost. This quantity is sometimes called the efficient scale of the firm. For Conrad, 
the efficient scale is 5 or 6 cups of coffee per hour. If he produces more or less than 
this amount, his average total cost rises above the minimum of $1.30. At lower 
levels of output, average total cost is higher than $1.30 because the fixed cost is 
spread over so few units. At higher levels of output, average total cost is higher 
than $1.30 because the marginal product of inputs has diminished significantly. 
At the efficient scale, these two forces are balanced to yield the lowest average 
total cost.
The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost  If you look at 
Figure 4 (or back at Table 2), you will see something that may be surprising at 
first. Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling. 
Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising.
This feature of Conrad’s cost curves is not a coincidence from the particular num-
bers used in the example: It is true for all firms.
To see why, consider an analogy. Average total cost is like your cumulative 
grade point average. Marginal cost is like the grade you get in the next course 
you take. If your grade in your next course is less than your grade point average, 
your grade point average will fall. If your grade in your next course is higher than 
your grade point average, your grade point average will rise. The mathematics of 
average and marginal costs is exactly the same as the mathematics of average and 
marginal grades.
This relationship between average total cost and marginal cost has an import-
ant corollary: The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its min-
imum. Why? At low levels of output, marginal cost is below average total cost, 
so average total cost is falling. But after the two curves cross, marginal cost rises 
above average total cost. As a result, average total cost must start to rise at this 
level of output. Hence, this point of intersection is the minimum of average total 
cost. As we will see in the next chapter, minimum average total cost plays a key 
role in the analysis of competitive firms.
13-3d Typical Cost Curves
In the examples we have studied so far, the firms have exhibited diminishing 
marginal product and, therefore, rising marginal cost at all levels of output. This 
simplifying assumption was useful because it allowed us to focus on the key 
features of cost curves that are useful in analyzing firm behavior. Yet actual firms 
are usually more complicated than this. In many firms, marginal product does 
not start to fall immediately after the first worker is hired. Depending on the 
production process, the second or third worker might have a higher  marginal 
product than the first because a team of workers can divide tasks and work 
more productively than a single worker. Firms exhibiting this pattern would 
 experience increasing marginal product for a while before diminishing marginal 
 product set in.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
Figure 5 shows the cost curves for such a firm, including average total 
cost (ATC), average fixed cost (AFC), average variable cost (AVC), and marginal 
cost (MC). At low levels of output, the firm experiences increasing marginal prod-
uct, and the marginal-cost curve falls. Eventually, the firm starts to experience 
diminishing marginal product, and the marginal-cost curve starts to rise. This 
combination of increasing then diminishing marginal product also makes the 
average-variable-cost curve U-shaped. 
Despite these differences from our previous example, the cost curves in Figure 5 
share the three properties that are most important to remember:
• Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output. 
• The average-total-cost curve is U-shaped.
• The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum 
of average total cost. 
QuickQuiz
Suppose Honda’s total cost of producing 4 cars is $225,000 and its total 
cost of producing 5 cars is $250,000. What is the average total cost of 
producing 5 cars? What is the marginal cost of the fifth car? • Draw the marginal-cost curve 
and the average-total-cost curve for a typical firm, and explain why these curves cross where 
they do.
13-4 Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run
We noted earlier in this chapter that a firm’s costs might depend on the time 
horizon under consideration. Let’s examine more precisely why this might be 
the case.
FIGURE 5
Cost Curves for a Typical Firm
Many firms experience increasing 
marginal product before diminishing 
marginal product. As a result, they 
have cost curves shaped like those 
in this figure. Notice that marginal 
cost and average variable cost fall 
for a while before starting to rise.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
13-4a  The Relationship between Short-Run  
and Long-Run Average Total Cost 
For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs 
depends on the time horizon. Consider, for instance, a car manufacturer such as 
Ford Motor Company. Over a period of only a few months, Ford cannot adjust the 
number or sizes of its car factories. The only way it can produce additional cars 
is to hire more workers at the factories it already has. The cost of these factories 
is, therefore, a fixed cost in the short run. By contrast, over a period of several 
years, Ford can expand the size of its factories, build new factories, or close old 
ones. Thus, the cost of its factories is a variable cost in the long run.
Because many decisions are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, 
a firm’s long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves. Figure 6 shows 
an example. The figure presents three short-run average-total-cost curves—for a 
small, medium, and large factory. It also presents the long-run average-total-cost 
curve. As the firm moves along the long-run curve, it is adjusting the size of the 
factory to the quantity of production.
This graph shows how short-run and long-run costs are related. The long-run 
average-total-cost curve has a much flatter U-shape than the short-run average-
total-cost curve. In addition, all the short-run curves lie on or above the long-run 
curve. These properties arise because firms have greater flexibility in the long run. 
In essence, in the long run, the firm gets to choose which short-run curve it wants 
to use. But in the short run, it has to use whatever short-run curve it has, based on 
decisions it has made in the past.
The figure shows an example of how a change in production alters costs over 
different time horizons. When Ford wants to increase production from 1,000 to 
1,200 cars per day, it has no choice in the short run but to hire more workers at its 
existing medium-sized factory. Because of diminishing marginal product, average 
total cost rises from $10,000 to $12,000 per car. In the long run, however, Ford 
can expand both the size of the factory and its workforce, and average total cost 
returns to $10,000.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
How long does it take a firm to get to the long run? The answer depends on 
the firm. It can take a year or more for a major manufacturing firm, such as a car 
company, to build a larger factory. By contrast, a person running a coffee shop can 
buy another coffee maker within a few days. There is, therefore, no single answer 
to the question of how long it takes a firm to adjust its production facilities.
13-4b Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
The shape of the long-run average-total-cost curve conveys important informa-
tion about the production processes that a firm has available for manufacturing a 
good. In particular, it tells us how costs vary with the scale—that is, the size—of a 
firm’s operations. When long-run average total cost declines as output increases, 
there are said to be economies of scale. When long-run average total cost rises as 
output increases, there are said to be diseconomies of scale. When long-run aver-
age total cost does not vary with the level of output, there are said to be constant 
returns to scale. As we can see in Figure 6, Ford has economies of scale at low 
levels of output, constant returns to scale at intermediate levels of output, and 
diseconomies of scale at high levels of output. 
What might cause economies or diseconomies of scale? Economies of scale 
often arise because higher production levels allow specialization among workers, 
which permits each worker to become better at a specific task. For instance, if 
Ford hires a large number of workers and produces a large number of cars, it can 
reduce costs using modern assembly-line production. Diseconomies of scale can 
arise because of coordination problems that are inherent in any large organization. 
The more cars Ford produces, the more stretched the management team becomes, 
and the less effective the managers become at keeping costs down.

Lessons from a Pin Factory
“J
ack of all trades, master of none.” This well-known adage sheds 
light on the nature of cost curves. A person who tries to do everything 
usually ends up doing nothing very well. If a firm wants its workers to be 
as productive as they can be, it is often best to give each worker a limited 
task that she can master. But this organization of work is possible only 
if a firm employs many workers and produces a large quantity of output.
In his celebrated book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the 
Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described a visit he made to a pin factory. 
Smith was impressed by the specialization among the workers and the 
resulting economies of scale. He wrote,
One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a 
fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to 
make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is 
a peculiar business; to whiten it is another; it is even a trade by itself 
to put them into paper.
Smith reported that because of this specialization, the pin factory pro-
duced thousands of pins per worker every day. He conjectured that if the 
workers had chosen to 
work separately, rather 
than as a team of spe-
cialists, “they certainly 
could not each of them 
make twenty, perhaps not 
one pin a day.” In other words, 
because of specialization, a large pin factory could achieve higher output 
per worker and lower average cost per pin than a small pin factory.
The specialization that Smith observed in the pin factory is preva-
lent in the modern economy. If you want to build a house, for  instance, 
you could try to do all the work yourself. But most people turn to a 
builder, who in turn hires carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, 
and many other types of workers. These workers focus their training and 
experience in particular jobs, and as a result, they  become better at 
their jobs than if they were generalists. Indeed, the use of  specialization 
to achieve economies of scale is one reason modern societies are as 
prosperous as they are. ■

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
This analysis shows why long-run average-total-cost curves are often 
U-shaped. At low levels of production, the firm benefits from increased size 
because it can take advantage of greater specialization. Coordination problems, 
meanwhile, are not yet acute. By contrast, at high levels of production, the benefits 
of specialization have already been realized, and coordination problems become 
more severe as the firm grows larger. Thus, long-run average total cost is falling 
at low levels of production because of increasing specialization and rising at high 
levels of production because of growing coordination problems.

from an extra unit of production
13-5 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to develop some tools to study how firms 
make production and pricing decisions. You should now understand what econ-
omists mean by the term costs and how costs vary with the quantity of output a 
firm produces. To refresh your memory, Table 3 summarizes some of the defini-
tions we have encountered. 
By themselves, a firm’s cost curves do not tell us what decisions the firm will 
make. But they are a key component of that decision, as we will see in the next 
chapter.

CHAPTER 13   THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
• The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals 
total revenue minus total cost. 
• When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to 
 include all the opportunity costs of production. Some of 
the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its 
workers, are explicit. Other opportunity costs, such as the 
wages the firm owner gives up by working at the firm 
rather than taking another job, are implicit. Economic 
profit takes both explicit and implicit costs into account, 
whereas accounting profit considers only explicit costs.
• A firm’s costs reflect its production process. A typical 
firm’s production function gets flatter as the quantity 
of an input increases, displaying the property of dimin-
ishing marginal product. As a result, a firm’s total-cost 
curve gets steeper as the quantity produced rises.
• A firm’s total costs can be divided into fixed costs and 
variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that do not change 
when the firm alters the quantity of output produced. 
Variable costs are costs that change when the firm 
 alters the quantity of output produced. 
• From a firm’s total cost, two related measures of cost 
are derived. Average total cost is total cost divided by 
the quantity of output. Marginal cost is the amount by 
which total cost rises if output increases by 1 unit.
• When analyzing firm behavior, it is often useful to 
graph average total cost and marginal cost. For a 
typical firm, marginal cost rises with the  quantity 
of output. Average total cost first falls as output 
 increases and then rises as output increases further. 
The  marginal-cost curve always crosses the average- 
total-cost curve at the minimum of average total cost. 
• A firm’s costs often depend on the time horizon con-
sidered. In particular, many costs are fixed in the short 
run but variable in the long run. As a result, when the 
firm changes its level of production, average total cost 
may rise more in the short run than in the long run.

Firms in Competitive 
Markets
CHAPTER
14
I
f your local gas station raised its price for gasoline by 20 percent, it would see a 
large drop in the amount of gasoline it sold. Its customers would quickly switch 
to buying their gasoline at other gas stations. By contrast, if your local water com-
pany raised the price of water by 20 percent, it would see only a small decrease in 
the amount of water it sold. People might water their lawns less often and buy more 
water-efficient showerheads, but they would be hard-pressed to reduce  water con-
sumption greatly or to find another supplier. The difference between the gasoline 
market and the water market is that many firms supply gasoline to the local mar-
ket, but only one firm supplies water. As you might expect, this difference in 
 market structure shapes the pricing and production decisions of the firms  
that operate in these markets.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
In this chapter, we examine the behavior of competitive firms, such as your 
local gas station. You may recall that a market is competitive if each buyer and 
seller is small compared to the size of the market and, therefore, has little ability 
to influence market prices. By contrast, if a firm can influence the market price of 
the good it sells, it is said to have market power. Later in the book, we examine the 
behavior of firms with market power, such as your local water company.
Our analysis of competitive firms in this chapter sheds light on the decisions 
that lie behind the supply curve in a competitive market. Not surprisingly, we 
find that a market supply curve is tightly linked to firms’ costs of production. 
Less obvious, however, is the question of which among a firm’s many types of 
cost—fixed, variable, average, and marginal—are most relevant for its supply 
decisions. We see that all these measures of cost play important and interre-
lated roles.
14-1 What Is a Competitive Market?
Our goal in this chapter is to examine how firms make production decisions in 
competitive markets. As a background for this analysis, we begin by reviewing 
what a competitive market is.
14-1a The Meaning of Competition
A competitive market, sometimes called a perfectly competitive market, has two 
characteristics:
• There are many buyers and many sellers in the market.
• The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
As a result of these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller in the mar-
ket have a negligible impact on the market price. Each buyer and seller takes the 
market price as given.
As an example, consider the market for milk. No single consumer of milk 
can influence the price of milk because each buys a small amount relative to the 
size of the market. Similarly, each dairy farmer has limited control over the price 
 because many other sellers are offering milk that is essentially identical. Because 
each seller can sell all he wants at the going price, he has little reason to charge 
less, and if he charges more, buyers will go elsewhere. Buyers and sellers in com-
petitive markets must accept the price the market determines and, therefore, are 
said to be price takers.
In addition to the previous two conditions for competition, a third condition is 
sometimes thought to characterize perfectly competitive markets:
• Firms can freely enter or exit the market.
If, for instance, anyone can start a dairy farm, and if any existing dairy farmer can 
leave the dairy business, then the dairy industry satisfies this condition. Much of 
the analysis of competitive firms does not require the assumption of free entry 
and exit because this condition is not necessary for firms to be price takers. Yet, 
as we see later in this chapter, when there is free entry and exit in a competitive 
market, it is a powerful force shaping the long-run equilibrium.

CHAPTER 14   FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
14-1b The Revenue of a Competitive Firm
A firm in a competitive market, like most other firms in the economy, tries to max-
imize profit (total revenue minus total cost). To see how it does this, we first con-
sider the revenue of a competitive firm. To keep matters concrete, let’s consider a 
specific firm: the Vaca Family Dairy Farm.
The Vaca Farm produces a quantity of milk, Q, and sells each unit at the market 
price, P. The farm’s total revenue is P 3 Q. For example, if a gallon of milk sells 
for $6 and the farm sells 1,000 gallons, its total revenue is $6,000.
Because the Vaca Farm is small compared to the world market for milk, it takes 
the price as given by market conditions. This means, in particular, that the price 
of milk does not depend on the number of gallons that the Vaca Farm produces 
and sells. If the Vacas double the amount of milk they produce to 2,000 gallons, 
the price of milk remains the same, and their total revenue doubles to $12,000. As 
a result, total revenue is proportional to the amount of output.
Table 1 shows the revenue for the Vaca Family Dairy Farm. Columns (1) and (2) 
show the amount of output the farm produces and the price at which it sells its 
output. Column (3) is the farm’s total revenue. The table assumes that the price of 
milk is $6 a gallon, so total revenue is $6 times the number of gallons.
Just as the concepts of average and marginal were useful in the preceding 
chapter when analyzing costs, they are also useful when analyzing revenue. To 
see what these concepts tell us, consider these two questions:
• How much revenue does the farm receive for the typical gallon of milk?
• How much additional revenue does the farm receive if it increases 
 production of milk by 1 gallon?
Columns (4) and (5) in Table 1 answer these questions.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Column (4) in the table shows average revenue, which is total revenue [from 
column (3)] divided by the amount of output [from column (1)]. Average revenue 
tells us how much revenue a firm receives for the typical unit sold. In Table 1, you 
can see that average revenue equals $6, the price of a gallon of milk. This illus-
trates a general lesson that applies not only to competitive firms but to other firms 
as well. Average revenue is total revenue (P 3 Q) divided by the quantity (Q). 
Therefore, for all types of firms, average revenue equals the price of the good.
Column (5) shows marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue from 
the sale of each additional unit of output. In Table 1, marginal revenue equals $6, 
the price of a gallon of milk. This result illustrates a lesson that applies only to 
competitive firms. Total revenue is P 3 Q, and P is fixed for a competitive firm. 
Therefore, when Q rises by 1 unit, total revenue rises by P dollars. For competitive 
firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good.

14-2  Profit Maximization and the Competitive Firm’s 
Supply Curve
The goal of a firm is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus 
total cost. We have just discussed the competitive firm’s revenue, and in the 
preceding chapter, we discussed the firm’s costs. We are now ready to examine 
how a competitive firm maximizes profit and how that decision determines its 
supply curve.
14-2a A Simple Example of Profit Maximization
Let’s begin our analysis of the firm’s supply decision with the example in  Table 2. 
Column (1) in the table shows the number of gallons of milk the Vaca Family Dairy 
Farm produces. Column (2) shows the farm’s total revenue, which is $6 times the 
number of gallons. Column (3) shows the farm’s total cost. Total cost includes 
fixed costs, which are $3 in this example, and variable costs, which depend on the 
quantity produced.
Column (4) shows the farm’s profit, which is computed by subtracting total 
cost from total revenue. If the farm produces nothing, it has a loss of $3 (its fixed 
cost). If it produces 1 gallon, it has a profit of $1. If it produces 2 gallons, it has 
a profit of $4 and so on. Because the Vaca family’s goal is to maximize profit, it 
chooses to produce the quantity of milk that makes profit as large as possible. In 
this example, profit is maximized when the farm produces either 4 or 5 gallons of 
milk, for a profit of $7.
There is another way to look at Vaca Farm’s decision: The Vacas can find the 
profit-maximizing quantity by comparing the marginal revenue and marginal 
cost from each unit produced. Columns (5) and (6) in Table 2 compute marginal 
revenue and marginal cost from the changes in total revenue and total cost, and 
column (7) shows the change in profit for each additional gallon produced. The 
first gallon of milk the farm produces has a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal 
cost of $2; hence, producing that gallon increases profit by $4 (from 2$3 to $1). 
The second gallon produced has a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal cost 
of $3, so that gallon increases profit by $3 (from $1 to $4). As long as marginal

TABLE 2
Profit Maximization: 
A Numerical Example
revenue exceeds marginal cost, increasing the quantity produced raises profit. 
Once the Vaca Farm has reached 5 gallons of milk, however, the situation changes. 
The sixth gallon would have a marginal revenue of $6 and a marginal cost of $7, 
so producing it would reduce profit by $1 (from $7 to $6). As a result, the Vacas 
would not produce beyond 5 gallons.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that rational people think 
at the margin. We now see how the Vaca Family Dairy Farm can apply this prin-
ciple. If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost—as it is at 1, 2, and 3 
 gallons—the Vacas should increase the production of milk because it will put 
more money in their pockets (marginal revenue) than it takes out (marginal cost). 
If marginal revenue is less than marginal cost—as it is at 6, 7, and 8 gallons—
the Vacas should decrease production. If the Vacas think at the margin and make 
incremental adjustments to the level of production, they end up producing the 
 profit-maximizing quantity.
14-2b The Marginal-Cost Curve and the Firm’s Supply Decision
To extend this analysis of profit maximization, consider the cost curves in 
Figure 1. These cost curves have the three features that, as we discussed in the 
previous chapter, are thought to describe most firms: The marginal-cost curve 
(MC) is upward-sloping. The average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped. And 
the  marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of 
average total cost. The figure also shows a horizontal line at the market price (P). 
The price line is horizontal because a competitive firm is a price taker: The price

This figure shows the marginal-cost curve (MC), the average-total-cost curve (ATC), and 
the average-variable-cost curve (AVC). It also shows the market price (P), which for a 
competitive firm equals both marginal revenue (MR) and average revenue (AR). At the 
 quantity Q1, marginal revenue MR1 exceeds marginal cost MC1, so raising production 
 increases profit. At the quantity Q2, marginal cost MC2 is above marginal revenue MR2, so 
reducing production increases profit. The profit-maximizing quantity QMAX is found where 
the horizontal line representing the price intersects the marginal-cost curve.

of the firm’s output is the same regardless of the quantity that the firm decides 
to produce. Keep in mind that, for a competitive firm, the price equals both the 
firm’s average revenue (AR) and its marginal revenue (MR). 
We can use Figure 1 to find the quantity of output that maximizes profit. Imag-
ine that the firm is producing at Q1. At this level of output, the marginal-revenue 
curve is above the marginal-cost curve, showing that marginal revenue is greater 
than marginal cost. This means that if the firm were to raise production by 1 unit, 
the additional revenue (MR1) would exceed the additional cost (MC1). Profit, 
which equals total revenue minus total cost, would increase. Hence, if marginal 
revenue is greater than marginal cost, as it is at Q1, the firm can increase profit by 
increasing production.
A similar argument applies when output is at Q2. In this case, the marginal-cost 
curve is above the marginal-revenue curve, showing that marginal cost is greater 
than marginal revenue. If the firm were to reduce production by 1 unit, the costs 
saved (MC2) would exceed the revenue lost (MR2). Therefore, if marginal revenue 
is less than marginal cost, as it is at Q2, the firm can increase profit by reducing 
production.
Where do these marginal adjustments to production end? Regardless of 
whether the firm begins with production at a low level (such as Q1) or at a 
high level (such as Q2), the firm will eventually adjust production until the

CHAPTER 14   FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
quantity produced reaches QMAX. This analysis yields three general rules for 
profit maximization:
• If marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should increase its 
output.
• If marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, the firm should decrease its 
output.
• At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue and marginal 
cost are exactly equal.
These rules are the key to rational decision making by any profit-maximizing 
firm. They apply not only to competitive firms but, as we will see in the next 
chapter, to other types of firms as well.
We can now see how the competitive firm decides what quantity of its good 
to supply to the market. Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal 
revenue equals the market price. For any given price, the competitive firm’s 
 profit-maximizing quantity of output is found by looking at the intersection of the 
price with the marginal-cost curve. In Figure 1, that quantity of output is QMAX.
Suppose that the price prevailing in this market rises, perhaps because of an 
increase in market demand. Figure 2 shows how a competitive firm responds to 
the price increase. When the price is P1, the firm produces quantity Q1, the quan-
tity that equates marginal cost to the price. When the price rises to P2, the firm 
finds that marginal revenue is now higher than marginal cost at the previous level 
of output, so the firm increases production. The new profit-maximizing quan-
tity is Q2, at which marginal cost equals the new, higher price. In essence, because 
the firm’s marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to 
supply at any price, the marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm’s supply curve. 
There are, however, some caveats to this conclusion, which we examine next.
14-2c The Firm’s Short-Run Decision to Shut Down
So far, we have been analyzing the question of how much a competitive firm will 
produce. In certain circumstances, however, the firm will decide to shut down 
and not produce anything at all.
FIGURE 2

Competitive Firm’s Supply

An increase in the price 
from P1 to P2 leads to 
an increase in the firm’s 
profit-maximizing quantity 
from Q1 to Q2. Because the

the firm at any given price, 
it is the firm’s supply 
curve.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Here we need to distinguish between a temporary shutdown of a firm and 
the permanent exit of a firm from the market. A shutdown refers to a short-run 
 decision not to produce anything during a specific period of time because of cur-
rent market conditions. Exit refers to a long-run decision to leave the market. The 
short-run and long-run decisions differ because most firms cannot avoid their 
fixed costs in the short run but can do so in the long run. That is, a firm that shuts 
down temporarily still has to pay its fixed costs, whereas a firm that exits the mar-
ket does not have to pay any costs at all, fixed or variable.
For example, consider the production decision that a farmer faces. The cost of 
the land is one of the farmer’s fixed costs. If the farmer decides not to produce any 
crops one season, the land lies fallow, and he cannot recover this cost. When making 
the short-run decision of whether to shut down for a season, the fixed cost of land is 
said to be a sunk cost. By contrast, if the farmer decides to leave farming altogether, 
he can sell the land. When making the long-run decision of whether to exit the mar-
ket, the cost of land is not sunk. (We return to the issue of sunk costs shortly.)
Now let’s consider what determines a firm’s shutdown decision. If the firm 
shuts down, it loses all revenue from the sale of its product. At the same time, it 
saves the variable costs of making its product (but must still pay the fixed costs). 
Thus, the firm shuts down if the revenue that it would earn from producing is less than its 
variable costs of production.
A bit of mathematics can make this shutdown rule more useful. If TR stands 
for total revenue and VC stands for variable cost, then the firm’s decision can be 
written as
Shut down if TR , VC.
The firm shuts down if total revenue is less than variable cost. By dividing both 
sides of this inequality by the quantity Q, we can write it as 
Shut down if TR/Q , VC/Q.
The left side of the inequality, TR/Q, is total revenue P 3 Q divided by  quantity Q, 
which is average revenue, most simply expressed as the good’s price, P. The right 
side of the inequality, VC/Q, is average variable cost, AVC. Therefore, the firm’s 
shutdown rule can be restated as
Shut down if P , AVC.
That is, a firm chooses to shut down if the price of the good is less than the aver-
age variable cost of production. This rule is intuitive: When choosing to produce, 
the firm compares the price it receives for the typical unit to the average vari-
able cost that it must incur to produce the typical unit. If the price doesn’t cover 
the  average variable cost, the firm is better off stopping production altogether. 
The firm still loses money (because it has to pay fixed costs), but it would lose 
even more money by staying open. The firm can reopen in the future if conditions 
change so that price exceeds average variable cost.
We now have a full description of a competitive firm’s profit-maximizing strat-
egy. If the firm produces anything, it produces the quantity at which marginal 
cost equals the good’s price, which the firm takes as given. Yet if the price is less 
than average variable cost at that quantity, the firm is better off shutting down 
temporarily and not producing anything. These results are illustrated in Figure 3. 
The competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve 
that lies above average variable cost.

14-2d Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs
Sometime in your life you may have been told, “Don’t cry over spilt milk,” or 
“Let bygones be bygones.” These adages hold a deep truth about rational decision 
making. Economists say that a cost is a sunk cost when it has already been com-
mitted and cannot be recovered. Because nothing can be done about sunk costs, 
you should ignore them when making decisions about various aspects of life, 
 including business strategy.
Our analysis of the firm’s shutdown decision is one example of the irrelevance 
of sunk costs. We assume that the firm cannot recover its fixed costs by tempo-
rarily stopping production. That is, regardless of the quantity of output supplied 
(even if it is zero), the firm still has to pay its fixed costs. As a result, the fixed 
costs are sunk in the short run, and the firm should ignore them when decid-
ing how much to produce. The firm’s short-run supply curve is the part of the 
 marginal-cost curve that lies above average variable cost, and the size of the fixed 
cost does not matter for this supply decision.
The irrelevance of sunk costs is also important when making personal deci-
sions. Imagine, for instance, that you place a $15 value on seeing a newly released 
movie. You buy a ticket for $10, but before entering the theater, you lose the ticket. 
Should you buy another ticket? Or should you now go home and refuse to pay a 
total of $20 to see the movie? The answer is that you should buy another ticket. 
The benefit of seeing the movie ($15) still exceeds the opportunity cost (the $10 for 
the second ticket). The $10 you paid for the lost ticket is a sunk cost. As with spilt 
milk, there is no point in crying about it.
CASE 
STUDY
NEAR-EMPTY RESTAURANTS AND OFF-SEASON MINIATURE GOLF
Have you ever walked into a restaurant for lunch and found it  almost 
empty? Why, you might have asked, does the restaurant even bother 
to stay open? It might seem that the revenue from so few  customers

a restaurant’s costs—the rent, kitchen equipment, tables, plates, silverware, and 
so on—are fixed. Shutting down during lunch would not reduce these costs. In 
other words, these costs are sunk in the short run. When the owner is deciding 
whether to serve lunch, only the variable costs—the price of the additional food 
and the wages of the extra staff—are relevant. The owner shuts down the restau-
rant at lunchtime only if the revenue from the few lunchtime customers would fail 
to cover the restaurant’s variable costs.
An operator of a miniature-golf course in a summer resort community faces 
a similar decision. Because revenue varies substantially from season to season, 
the firm must decide when to open and when to close. Once again, the fixed 
costs—the costs of buying the land and building the course—are irrelevant in 
making this short-run decision. The miniature-golf course should be open for 
business only during those times of year when its revenue exceeds its variable 
costs. ●
14-2e The Firm’s Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market
A firm’s long-run decision to exit a market is similar to its shutdown decision. If 
the firm exits, it will again lose all revenue from the sale of its product, but now 
it will save not only its variable costs of production but also its fixed costs. Thus, 
the firm exits the market if the revenue it would get from producing is less than its total 
cost.
We can again make this rule more useful by writing it mathematically. If TR
stands for total revenue and TC stands for total cost, then the firm’s exit rule can 
be written as
Exit if TR , TC.
Staying open can be profitable, even with many tables empty.

The Competitive Firm’s 
Long-Run Supply Curve
In the long run, the com-
petitive firm’s supply 
curve is its marginal-cost 
curve (MC) above average 
total cost (ATC). If the 
price falls below average 
total cost, the firm is better 
off exiting the market.

exits if 
P , ATC.
The firm exits if total revenue is less than total cost. By dividing both sides of this 
inequality by quantity Q, we can write it as 
Exit if TR/Q , TC/Q.
We can simplify this further by noting that TR/Q is average revenue, which 
equals the price P, and that TC/Q is average total cost, ATC. Therefore, the firm’s 
exit rule is
Exit if P , ATC.
That is, a firm chooses to exit if the price of its good is less than the average total 
cost of production. 
A parallel analysis applies to an entrepreneur who is considering starting 
a firm. He will enter the market if starting the firm would be profitable, which 
occurs if the price of the good exceeds the average total cost of production. The 
entry rule is
Enter if P . ATC.
The rule for entry is exactly the opposite of the rule for exit. 
We can now describe a competitive firm’s long-run profit-maximizing strat-
egy. If the firm produces anything, it chooses the quantity at which marginal cost 
equals the price of the good. Yet if the price is less than the average total cost at 
that quantity, the firm chooses to exit (or not enter) the market. These results are 
illustrated in Figure 4. The competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its 
marginal-cost curve that lies above average total cost. 
14-2f Measuring Profit in Our Graph for the Competitive Firm
As we study exit and entry, it is useful to analyze the firm’s profit in more detail. 
Recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC):
Profit 5 TR 2 TC.

The area of the shaded box between price and average total cost represents the firm’s 
profit. The height of this box is price minus average total cost (P 2 ATC), and the 
width of the box is the quantity of output (Q). In panel (a), price is above average total 
cost, so the firm has positive profit. In panel (b), price is less than average total cost, 
so the firm incurs a loss.

We can rewrite this definition by multiplying and dividing the right side by Q:

Note that TR/Q is average revenue, which is the price, P, and TC/Q is average 
total cost, ATC. Therefore,
Profit 5 (P 2 ATC) 3 Q.
This way of expressing the firm’s profit allows us to measure profit in our graphs. 
Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows a firm earning positive profit. As we have already 
discussed, the firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity at which price 
equals marginal cost. Now look at the shaded rectangle. The height of the rectan-
gle is P 2 ATC, the difference between price and average total cost. The width of 
the rectangle is Q, the quantity produced. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 
(P 2 ATC) 3 Q, which is the firm’s profit. 
Similarly, panel (b) of this figure shows a firm with losses (negative profit). In 
this case, maximizing profit means minimizing losses, a task accomplished once 
again by producing the quantity at which price equals marginal cost. Now con-
sider the shaded rectangle. The height of the rectangle is ATC 2 P, and the width 
is Q. The area is (ATC 2 P) 3 Q, which is the firm’s loss. Because a firm in this sit-
uation is not making enough revenue on each unit to cover its average total cost, 
it would choose to exit the market in the long run.

CHAPTER 14   FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
14-3 The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market
Now that we have examined the supply decision of a single firm, we can discuss 
the supply curve for a market. There are two cases to consider. First, we examine 
a market with a fixed number of firms. Second, we examine a market in which 
the number of firms can change as old firms exit the market and new firms enter. 
Both cases are important, for each applies to a specific time horizon. Over short 
periods of time, it is often difficult for firms to enter and exit, so the assumption of 
a fixed number of firms is appropriate. But over long periods of time, the number 
of firms can adjust to changing market conditions.
14-3a The Short Run: Market Supply with a Fixed Number of Firms
Consider a market with 1,000 identical firms. For any given price, each firm sup-
plies a quantity of output so that its marginal cost equals the price, as shown in 
panel (a) of Figure 6. That is, as long as price is above average variable cost, each 
firm’s marginal-cost curve is its supply curve. The quantity of output supplied to 
the market equals the sum of the quantities supplied by each of the 1,000 individ-
ual firms. Thus, to derive the market supply curve, we add the quantity supplied 
by each firm in the market. As panel (b) of Figure 6 shows, because the firms are 
identical, the quantity supplied to the market is 1,000 times the quantity supplied 
by each firm. 
14-3b The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit
Now consider what happens if firms are able to enter and exit the market. Let’s 
suppose that everyone has access to the same technology for producing the good 
In the short run, the number of firms in the market is fixed. As a result, the market  supply 
curve, shown in panel (b), reflects the individual firms’ marginal-cost curves, shown in 
panel (a). Here, in a market of 1,000 firms, the quantity of output supplied to the market is 
1,000 times the quantity supplied by each firm.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
and access to the same markets to buy the inputs for production. Therefore, all 
current and potential firms have the same cost curves.
Decisions about entry and exit in a market of this type depend on the incen-
tives facing the owners of existing firms and the entrepreneurs who could start 
new firms. If firms already in the market are profitable, then new firms will have 
an incentive to enter the market. This entry will expand the number of firms, 
 increase the quantity of the good supplied, and drive down prices and profits. 
Conversely, if firms in the market are making losses, then some existing firms will 
exit the market. Their exit will reduce the number of firms, decrease the quantity 
of the good supplied, and drive up prices and profits. At the end of this process of 
entry and exit, firms that remain in the market must be making zero economic profit.
Recall that we can write a firm’s profit as
Profit 5 (P 2 ATC) 3 Q.
This equation shows that an operating firm has zero profit if and only if the 
price of the good equals the average total cost of producing that good. If price is 
above average total cost, profit is positive, which encourages new firms to enter. 
If price is less than average total cost, profit is negative, which encourages some 
firms to exit. The process of entry and exit ends only when price and average total cost 
are driven to equality.
This analysis has a surprising implication. We noted earlier in the chapter that 
competitive firms maximize profits by choosing a quantity at which price equals 
marginal cost. We just noted that free entry and exit force price to equal average 
total cost. But if price is to equal both marginal cost and average total cost, these 
two measures of cost must equal each other. Marginal cost and average total cost 
are equal, however, only when the firm is operating at the minimum of average 
total cost. Recall from the preceding chapter that the level of production with low-
est average total cost is called the firm’s efficient scale. Therefore, in the long-run 
equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating at 
their efficient scale.
Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows a firm in such a long-run equilibrium. In this  figure, 
price P equals marginal cost MC, so the firm is maximizing profit. Price also 
equals average total cost ATC, so profit is zero. New firms have no incentive to 
enter the market, and existing firms have no incentive to leave the market. 
From this analysis of firm behavior, we can determine the long-run supply 
curve for the market. In a market with free entry and exit, there is only one price 
consistent with zero profit—the minimum of average total cost. As a result, the 
long-run market supply curve must be horizontal at this price, as illustrated by 
the perfectly elastic supply curve in panel (b) of Figure 7. Any price above this 
level would generate profit, leading to entry and an increase in the total quantity 
supplied. Any price below this level would generate losses, leading to exit and 
a decrease in the total quantity supplied. Eventually, the number of firms in the 
market adjusts so that price equals the minimum of average total cost, and there 
are enough firms to satisfy all the demand at this price.
14-3c  Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business If They Make 
Zero Profit?
At first, it might seem odd that competitive firms earn zero profit in the long run. 
After all, people start businesses to make a profit. If entry eventually drives profit 
to zero, there might seem to be little reason to stay in business.

CHAPTER 14   FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
To understand the zero-profit condition more fully, recall that profit equals 
total revenue minus total cost and that total cost includes all the opportunity costs 
of the firm. In particular, total cost includes the time and money that the firm 
owners devote to the business. In the zero-profit equilibrium, the firm’s revenue 
must compensate the owners for these opportunity costs.
Consider an example. Suppose that, to start his farm, a farmer had to invest 
$1 million, which otherwise he could have deposited in a bank and earned $50,000 
a year in interest. In addition, he had to give up another job that would have paid 
him $30,000 a year. Then the farmer’s opportunity cost of farming includes both 
the interest he could have earned and the forgone wages—a total of $80,000. Even 
if his profit is driven to zero, his revenue from farming compensates him for these 
opportunity costs.
Keep in mind that accountants and economists measure costs differently. As 
we discussed in the previous chapter, accountants keep track of explicit costs but 
not implicit costs. That is, they measure costs that require an outflow of money 
from the firm, but they do not include the opportunity costs of production that do 
not involve an outflow of money. As a result, in the zero-profit equilibrium, eco-
nomic profit is zero, but accounting profit is positive. Our farmer’s  accountant, for 
instance, would conclude that the farmer earned an accounting profit of $80,000, 
which is enough to keep the farmer in business.
14-3d A Shift in Demand in the Short Run and Long Run 
Now that we have a more complete understanding of how firms make supply 
decisions, we can better explain how markets respond to changes in demand. 
Because firms can enter and exit in the long run but not in the short run, the 
response of a market to a change in demand depends on the time horizon. To see 
this, let’s trace the effects of a shift in demand over time. 
In the long run, firms will enter or exit the market until profit is driven to zero. As a  result, 
price equals the minimum of average total cost, as shown in panel (a). The number of 
firms adjusts to ensure that all demand is satisfied at this price. The long-run market 
supply curve is horizontal at this price, as shown in panel (b).

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Suppose the market for milk begins in a long-run equilibrium. Firms are earn-
ing zero profit, so price equals the minimum of average total cost. Panel (a) of 
 Figure 8 shows this situation. The long-run equilibrium is point A, the quantity 
sold in the market is Q1, and the price is P1. 
Now suppose scientists discover that milk has miraculous health benefits. 
As a result, the quantity of milk demanded at every price increases, and the 
demand curve for milk shifts outward from D1 to D2, as in panel (b). The short-
run equilibrium moves from point A to point B; as a result, the quantity rises 
from Q1 to Q2, and the price rises from P1 to P2. All of the existing firms respond 
to the higher price by raising the amount they produce. Because each firm’s 
supply curve reflects its marginal-cost curve, how much each firm increases 
production is determined by the marginal-cost curve. In the new short-run 
equilibrium, the price of milk exceeds average total cost, so the firms are mak-
ing positive profit.
Over time, the profit generated in this market encourages new firms to enter. 
Some farmers may switch to producing milk instead of other farm products, for 
example. As the number of firms grows, the quantity supplied at every price in-
creases, the short-run supply curve shifts to the right from S1 to S2, as in panel (c), 
and this shift causes the price of milk to fall. Eventually, the price is driven back 
down to the minimum of average total cost, profits are zero, and firms stop en-
tering. Thus, the market reaches a new long-run equilibrium, point C. The price 
of milk has returned to P1, but the quantity produced has risen to Q3. Each firm is 
again producing at its efficient scale, but because more firms are in the dairy busi-
ness, the quantity of milk produced and sold is higher.
14-3e Why the Long-Run Supply Curve Might Slope Upward
So far, we have seen that entry and exit can cause the long-run market supply 
curve to be perfectly elastic. The essence of our analysis is that there are a large 
number of potential entrants, each of which faces the same costs. As a result, the 
long-run market supply curve is horizontal at the minimum of average total cost. 
When the demand for the good increases, the long-run result is an increase in the 
number of firms and in the total quantity supplied, without any change in the 
price.
There are, however, two reasons that the long-run market supply curve might 
slope upward. The first is that some resources used in production may be avail-
able only in limited quantities. For example, consider the market for farm prod-
ucts. Anyone can choose to buy land and start a farm, but the quantity of land is 
limited. As more people become farmers, the price of farmland is bid up, which 
raises the costs of all farmers in the market. Thus, an increase in demand for 
farm products cannot induce an increase in quantity supplied without also in-
ducing a rise in farmers’ costs, which in turn means a rise in price. The result is a 
long-run market supply curve that is upward-sloping, even with free entry into 
farming.
A second reason for an upward-sloping supply curve is that firms may have 
different costs. For example, consider the market for painters. Anyone can enter 
the market for painting services, but not everyone has the same costs. Costs vary 
in part because some people work faster than others and in part because some 
people have better alternative uses of their time than others. For any given price, 
those with lower costs are more likely to enter than those with higher costs. To 
increase the quantity of painting services supplied, additional entrants must be 
encouraged to enter the market. Because these new entrants have higher costs,

CHAPTER 14   FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
The market starts in a long-run equilibrium, shown as point A in panel (a). In this equilibrium, 
each firm makes zero profit, and the price equals the minimum average total cost. Panel (b) 
shows what happens in the short run when demand rises from D1 to D2. The equilibrium goes 
from point A to point B, price rises from P1 to P2, and the quantity sold in the market rises from 
Q1 to Q2. Because price now exceeds average total cost, each firm now makes a profit, which over 
time encourages new firms to enter the market. This entry shifts the short-run supply curve to the 
right from S1 to S2, as shown in panel (c). In the new long-run equilibrium, point C, price has re-
turned to P1 but the quantity sold has increased to Q3. Profits are again zero, and price is back to 
the minimum of average total cost, but the market has more firms to satisfy the greater demand.

the price must rise to make entry profitable for them. Thus, the long-run market 
supply curve for painting services slopes upward even with free entry into the 
market.
Notice that if firms have different costs, some firms earn profit even in the 
long run. In this case, the price in the market reflects the average total cost of the 
marginal firm—the firm that would exit the market if the price were any lower. 
This firm earns zero profit, but firms with lower costs earn positive profit. Entry 
does not eliminate this profit because would-be entrants have higher costs than 
firms already in the market. Higher-cost firms will enter only if the price rises, 
making the market profitable for them.
Thus, for these two reasons, a higher price may be necessary to induce a larger 
quantity supplied, in which case the long-run supply curve is upward-sloping 
rather than horizontal. Nonetheless, the basic lesson about entry and exit remains 
true. Because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run, 
the long-run supply curve is typically more elastic than the short-run supply curve.

14-4 Conclusion: Behind the Supply Curve
We have been discussing the behavior of profit-maximizing firms that supply 
goods in perfectly competitive markets. You may recall from Chapter 1 that one 
of the Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This 
chapter has applied this idea to the competitive firm. Marginal analysis has given 
us a theory of the supply curve in a competitive market and, as a result, a deeper 
understanding of market outcomes.
We have learned that when you buy a good from a firm in a competitive mar-
ket, you can be assured that the price you pay is close to the cost of producing that 
good. In particular, if firms are competitive and profit-maximizing, the price of a 
good equals the marginal cost of making that good. In addition, if firms can freely 
enter and exit the market, the price also equals the lowest possible average total 
cost of production.
Although we have assumed throughout this chapter that firms are price 
takers, many of the tools developed here are also useful for studying firms in 
less competitive markets. We now turn to examining the behavior of firms with 
market power. Marginal analysis will again be useful, but it will have quite 
different implications for a firm’s production decisions and for the nature of 
market outcomes.

• Because a competitive firm is a price taker, its revenue 
is proportional to the amount of output it produces. 
The price of the good equals both the firm’s average 
revenue and its marginal revenue.
• To maximize profit, a firm chooses a quantity of out-
put such that marginal revenue equals marginal cost. 
 Because marginal revenue for a competitive firm 
equals the market price, the firm chooses quantity 
so that price equals marginal cost. Thus, the firm’s 
 marginal-cost curve is its supply curve.
• In the short run when a firm cannot recover its fixed 
costs, the firm will choose to shut down temporarily if 
the price of the good is less than average variable cost. 
In the long run when the firm can recover both fixed 
and variable costs, it will choose to exit if the price is 
less than average total cost.
• In a market with free entry and exit, profit is driven 
to zero in the long run. In this long-run equilibrium, 
all firms produce at the efficient scale, price equals the 
minimum of average total cost, and the number of firms 
adjusts to satisfy the quantity demanded at this price. 
• Changes in demand have different effects over dif-
ferent time horizons. In the short run, an increase in 
demand raises prices and leads to profits, and a de-
crease in demand lowers prices and leads to losses. But 
if firms can freely enter and exit the market, then in 
the long run, the number of firms adjusts to drive the 
 market back to the zero-profit equilibrium.

short run? What happens to the number of boat 
makers in the long run? 
2. Bob’s lawn-mowing service is a profit-maximizing, 
competitive firm. Bob mows lawns for $27 each. His 
total cost each day is $280, of which $30 is a fixed cost. 
He mows 10 lawns a day. What can you say about 
Bob’s short-run decision regarding shutdown and his 
long-run decision regarding exit?
3. Consider total cost and total revenue given in the fol-
lowing table:

a. Calculate profit for each quantity. How much 
should the firm produce to maximize profit?
b. Calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost 
for each quantity. Graph them. (Hint: Put the 
points between whole numbers. For example, the 
 marginal cost between 2 and 3 should be graphed 
at 2½.) At what quantity do these curves cross? 
How does this relate to your answer to part (a)?
c. Can you tell whether this firm is in a competitive 
industry? If so, can you tell whether the industry 
is in a long-run equilibrium?
4. Ball Bearings, Inc., faces costs of production as follows:

a. Calculate the company’s average fixed cost, aver-
age variable cost, average total cost, and marginal 
cost at each level of production. 
b. The price of a case of ball bearings is $50. Seeing 
that he can’t make a profit, the chief executive 
 officer (CEO) decides to shut down operations. 
What is the firm’s profit/loss? Was this a wise 
 decision? Explain.
c. Vaguely remembering his introductory economics 
course, the chief financial officer tells the CEO 
it is better to produce 1 case of ball bearings, 
 because marginal revenue equals marginal cost 
at that quantity. What is the firm’s profit/loss 
at that level of production? Was this the best 
 decision? Explain.
5. Suppose the book-printing industry is competitive 
and begins in a long-run equilibrium. 
a. Draw a diagram showing the average total cost, 
marginal cost, marginal revenue, and supply 
curve of the typical firm in the industry.
b. Hi-Tech Printing Company invents a new process 
that sharply reduces the cost of printing books. 
What happens to Hi-Tech’s profits and to the 
price of books in the short run when Hi-Tech’s 
patent prevents other firms from using the new 
technology?
c. What happens in the long run when the  patent 
expires and other firms are free to use the 
technology?
6. A firm in a competitive market receives $500 in  total 
revenue and has marginal revenue of $10. What 
is the average revenue, and how many units were 
sold? 
7. A profit-maximizing firm in a competitive market is 
currently producing 100 units of output. It has average 
revenue of $10, average total cost of $8, and fixed cost 
of $200. 
a. What is its profit?
b. What is its marginal cost?
c. What is its average variable cost?
d. Is the efficient scale of the firm more than, less 
than, or exactly 100 units?

CHAPTER 14   FIRMS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS
8. The market for fertilizer is perfectly competitive. 
Firms in the market are producing output but are cur-
rently incurring economic losses. 
a. How does the price of fertilizer compare to the av-
erage total cost, the average variable cost, and the 
marginal cost of producing fertilizer? 
b. Draw two graphs, side by side, illustrating the 
present situation for the typical firm and for the 
market. 
c. Assuming there is no change in either demand or 
the firms’ cost curves, explain what will happen 
in the long run to the price of fertilizer, marginal 
cost, average total cost, the quantity supplied by 
each firm, and the total quantity supplied to the 
market.

Monopoly
CHAPTER 
15
I
f you own a personal computer, it probably uses some version of Windows, 
the operating system sold by the Microsoft Corporation. When Microsoft first 
 designed Windows many years ago, it applied for and received a copyright 
from the government. The copyright gives Microsoft the exclusive right to make 
and sell copies of the Windows operating system. If a person wants to buy a copy 
of Windows, she has little choice but to give Microsoft the approximately $100 
that the firm has decided to charge for its product. Microsoft is said to have a 
 monopoly in the market for Windows.
Microsoft’s business decisions are not well described by the model of firm 
behavior we developed in the previous chapter. In that chapter,

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
we analyzed competitive markets, in which many firms offer essentially identical 
products, so each firm has little influence over the price it receives. By contrast, 
a monopoly such as Microsoft has no close competitors and, therefore, has the 
power to influence the market price of its product. Whereas a competitive firm is 
a price taker, a monopoly firm is a price maker.
In this chapter, we examine the implications of this market power. We will see 
that market power alters the relationship between a firm’s costs and the price at 
which it sells its product. A competitive firm takes the price of its output as given 
by the market and then chooses the quantity it will supply so that price equals 
marginal cost. By contrast, a monopoly charges a price that exceeds marginal cost. 
Sure enough, we observe this practice in the case of Microsoft’s Windows. The 
marginal cost of Windows—the extra cost that Microsoft incurs by downloading 
one more copy of the program onto a CD—is only a few dollars. The market price 
of Windows is many times its marginal cost.
It is not surprising that monopolies charge high prices for their products. Cus-
tomers of monopolies might seem to have little choice but to pay whatever the 
monopoly charges. But if so, why does a copy of Windows not cost $1,000? Or 
$10,000? The reason is that if Microsoft were to set the price that high, fewer peo-
ple would buy the product. People would buy fewer computers, switch to other 
operating systems, or make illegal copies. A monopoly firm can control the price 
of the good it sells, but because a high price reduces the quantity that its custom-
ers buy, the monopoly’s profits are not unlimited.
As we examine the production and pricing decisions of monopolies, we also 
consider the implications of monopoly for society as a whole. Monopoly firms, 
like competitive firms, aim to maximize profit. But this goal has very differ-
ent ramifications for competitive and monopoly firms. In competitive markets, 
self-interested consumers and producers reach an equilibrium that promotes gen-
eral economic well-being, as if guided by an invisible hand. By contrast, because 
monopoly firms are unchecked by competition, the outcome in a market with a 
monopoly is often not in the best interest of society.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. The analysis in this chapter sheds more light on 
this principle. As we examine the problems that monopolies raise for society, we 
discuss the various ways in which government policymakers might respond to 
these problems. The U.S. government, for example, keeps a close eye on Microsoft’s 
business decisions. In 1994, it blocked Microsoft from buying Intuit, a leading seller 
of personal finance software, on the grounds that combining the two firms would 
concentrate too much market power. Similarly, in 1998, the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice objected when Microsoft started integrating its Internet browser into its Win-
dows operating system, claiming that this addition would extend the firm’s market 
power into new areas. In recent years, regulators in the United States and abroad 
have shifted their focus to firms with growing market power, such as Google and 
Samsung, but continue to monitor Microsoft’s compliance with the antitrust laws.
15-1 Why Monopolies Arise
A firm is a monopoly if it is the sole seller of its product and if its product does not 
have any close substitutes. The fundamental cause of monopoly is barriers to entry: 
A monopoly remains the only seller in its market because other firms cannot enter 
the market and compete with it. Barriers to entry, in turn, have three main sources:

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
• Monopoly resources: A key resource required for production is owned 
by a single firm.
• Government regulation: The government gives a single firm the 
 exclusive right to produce some good or service.
• The production process: A single firm can produce output at a lower 
cost than can a larger number of firms.
Let’s briefly discuss each of these.
15-1a Monopoly Resources
The simplest way for a monopoly to arise is for a single firm to own a key  
resource. For example, consider the market for water in a small town. If 
dozens of town residents have working wells, the model of competitive 
markets discussed in the preceding chapter describes the behavior of sell-
ers. Competition among suppliers drives the price of a gallon of water to 
equal the marginal cost of pumping an extra gallon. But if there is only one 
well in town and it is impossible to get water from anywhere else, then the 
owner of the well has a monopoly on water. Not surprisingly, the monopolist has 
much greater market power than any single firm in a competitive market. In the 
case of a necessity like water, the monopolist can command quite a high price, 
even if the marginal cost of pumping an extra gallon is low.
A classic example of market power arising from the ownership of a key 
 resource is DeBeers, the South African diamond company. Founded in 1888 by 
Cecil Rhodes, an English businessman (and benefactor of the Rhodes scholar-
ship), DeBeers has at times controlled up to 80 percent of the production from 
the world’s diamond mines. Because its market share is less than 100 percent, 
 DeBeers is not exactly a monopoly, but the company has nonetheless exerted sub-
stantial influence over the market price of diamonds.
Although exclusive ownership of a key resource is a potential cause of 
 monopoly, in practice monopolies rarely arise for this reason. Economies are large, 
and resources are owned by many people. The natural scope of many markets is 
worldwide, because goods are often traded internationally. There are, therefore, 
few examples of firms that own a resource for which there are no close substitutes.
15-1b Government-Created Monopolies
In many cases, monopolies arise because the government has given one person 
or firm the exclusive right to sell some good or service. Sometimes the monopoly 
arises from the sheer political clout of the would-be monopolist. Kings, for exam-
ple, once granted exclusive business licenses to their friends and allies. At other 
times, the government grants a monopoly because doing so is viewed to be in the 
public interest.
The patent and copyright laws are two important examples. When a pharma-
ceutical company discovers a new drug, it can apply to the government for a pat-
ent. If the government deems the drug to be truly original, it approves the patent, 
which gives the company the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the drug 
for 20 years. Similarly, when a novelist finishes a book, she can copyright it. The 
copyright is a government guarantee that no one can print and sell the work with-
out the author’s permission. The copyright makes the novelist a monopolist in the 
sale of her novel.
The effects of patent and copyright laws are easy to see. Because these laws 
give one producer a monopoly, they lead to higher prices than would occur under 
“Rather than a  
monopoly, we like to  
consider ourselves ‘the 
only game in town.’”

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
competition. But by allowing these monopoly producers to charge higher prices 
and earn higher profits, the laws also encourage some desirable behavior. Drug 
companies are allowed to be monopolists in the drugs they discover to encour-
age research. Authors are allowed to be monopolists in the sale of their books to 
 encourage them to write more and better books.
Thus, the laws governing patents and copyrights have both benefits and costs. 
The benefits of the patent and copyright laws are the increased incentives for cre-
ative activity. These benefits are offset, to some extent, by the costs of monopoly 
pricing, which we examine later in this chapter. 
15-1c Natural Monopolies
An industry is a natural monopoly when a single firm can supply a good or ser-
vice to an entire market at a lower cost than could two or more firms. A natural 
monopoly arises when there are economies of scale over the relevant range of out-
put. Figure 1 shows the average total costs of a firm with economies of scale. In 
this case, a single firm can produce any amount of output at the lowest cost. That 
is, for any given amount of output, a larger number of firms leads to less output 
per firm and higher average total cost.
An example of a natural monopoly is the distribution of water. To provide 
water to residents of a town, a firm must build a network of pipes throughout the 
town. If two or more firms were to compete in the provision of this service, each 
firm would have to pay the fixed cost of building a network. Thus, the average 
total cost of water is lowest if a single firm serves the entire market. 
We saw other examples of natural monopolies when we discussed public 
goods and common resources in Chapter 11. We noted that club goods are exclud-
able but not rival in consumption. An example is a bridge used so infrequently 
that it is never congested. The bridge is excludable because a toll collector can 
prevent someone from using it. The bridge is not rival in consumption because 
use of the bridge by one person does not diminish the ability of others to use it. 
Because there is a large fixed cost of building the bridge and a negligible marginal 
cost of additional users, the average total cost of a trip across the bridge (the total 
cost divided by the number of trips) falls as the number of trips rises. Hence, the 
bridge is a natural monopoly.

arises because a single

FIGURE 1
Economies of Scale as a Cause of Monopoly
When a firm’s average-total-cost curve continually declines, the 
firm has what is called a natural monopoly. In this case, when 
production is divided among more firms, each firm produces 
less, and average total cost rises. As a result, a single firm can 
produce any given amount at the lowest cost.

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
When a firm is a natural monopoly, it is less concerned about new entrants 
eroding its monopoly power. Normally, a firm has trouble maintaining a monop-
oly position without ownership of a key resource or protection from the govern-
ment. The monopolist’s profit attracts entrants into the market, and these entrants 
make the market more competitive. By contrast, entering a market in which 
 another firm has a natural monopoly is unattractive. Would-be entrants know 
that they cannot achieve the same low costs that the monopolist enjoys because, 
after entry, each firm would have a smaller piece of the market. 
In some cases, the size of the market is one determinant of whether an industry 
is a natural monopoly. Again, consider a bridge across a river. When the popula-
tion is small, the bridge may be a natural monopoly. A single bridge can satisfy 
the entire demand for trips across the river at the lowest cost. Yet as the popula-
tion grows and the bridge becomes congested, satisfying the entire demand may 
require two or more bridges across the same river. Thus, as a market expands, a 
natural monopoly can evolve into a more competitive market.

two examples of monopolies and explain the reason for each.
15-2  How Monopolies Make Production  
and Pricing Decisions
Now that we know how monopolies arise, we can consider how a monopoly firm 
decides how much of its product to make and what price to charge for it. The 
analysis of monopoly behavior in this section is the starting point for evaluating 
whether monopolies are desirable and what policies the government might pur-
sue in monopoly markets. 
15-2a Monopoly versus Competition
The key difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly is the monopoly’s 
ability to influence the price of its output. A competitive firm is small relative to 
the market in which it operates and, therefore, has no power to influence the price 
of its output. It takes the price as given by market conditions. By contrast, because 
a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, it can alter the price of its good by 
adjusting the quantity it supplies to the market.
One way to view this difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly 
is to consider the demand curve that each firm faces. When we analyzed profit 
maximization by competitive firms in the preceding chapter, we drew the market 
price as a horizontal line. Because a competitive firm can sell as much or as little 
as it wants at this price, the competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve, as 
in panel (a) of Figure 2. In effect, because the competitive firm sells a product with 
many perfect substitutes (the products of all the other firms in its market), the 
demand curve that any one firm faces is perfectly elastic.
By contrast, because a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, its demand 
curve is the market demand curve. Thus, the monopolist’s demand curve slopes 
downward, as in panel (b) of Figure 2. If the monopolist raises the price of its 
good, consumers buy less of it. Looked at another way, if the monopolist reduces 
the quantity of output it produces and sells, the price of its output increases.
The market demand curve provides a constraint on a monopoly’s ability to 
profit from its market power. A monopolist would prefer, if it were possible, to

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
charge a high price and sell a large quantity at that high price. The market demand 
curve makes that outcome impossible. In particular, the market demand curve 
describes the combinations of price and quantity that are available to a monopoly 
firm. By adjusting the quantity produced (or equivalently, the price charged), the 
monopolist can choose any point on the demand curve, but it cannot choose a 
point off the demand curve. 
What price and quantity of output will the monopolist choose? As with com-
petitive firms, we assume that the monopolist’s goal is to maximize profit. Because 
the firm’s profit is total revenue minus total costs, our next task in  explaining 
 monopoly behavior is to examine a monopolist’s revenue.
15-2b A Monopoly’s Revenue
Consider a town with a single producer of water. Table 1 shows how the mono-
poly’s revenue might depend on the amount of water produced. 
Columns (1) and (2) show the monopolist’s demand schedule. If the 
monopolist produces 1 gallon of water, it can sell that gallon for $10. If it produces 
2 gallons, it must lower the price to $9 to sell both gallons. If it produces 3 gallons, 
it must lower the price to $8. And so on. If you graphed these two columns of 
numbers, you would get a typical downward-sloping demand curve.
Column (3) of the table presents the monopolist’s total revenue. It equals the 
quantity sold [from column (1)] times the price [from column (2)]. Column (4) 
computes the firm’s average revenue, the amount of revenue the firm receives per 
unit sold. We compute average revenue by taking the number for total revenue 
in column (3) and dividing it by the quantity of output in column (1). As we dis-
cussed in the previous chapter, average revenue always equals the price of the 
good. This is true for monopolists as well as for competitive firms.

Because competitive firms are price takers, they face horizontal demand curves,  
as in panel (a). Because a monopoly firm is the sole producer in its market, it faces  
the downward-sloping market demand curve, as in panel (b). As a result, the monopoly  
has to accept a lower price if it wants to sell more output.

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
Column (5) of Table 1 computes the firm’s marginal revenue, the amount of rev-
enue that the firm receives for each additional unit of output. We compute mar-
ginal revenue by taking the change in total revenue when output increases by 
1 unit. For example, when the firm is producing 3 gallons of water, it receives  total 
revenue of $24. Raising production to 4 gallons increases total revenue to $28. 
Thus, marginal revenue from the sale of the fourth gallon is $28 minus $24, or $4.
Table 1 shows a result that is important for understanding monopoly behavior: 
A monopolist’s marginal revenue is less than the price of its good. For example, if the 
firm raises production of water from 3 to 4 gallons, it increases total revenue by 
only $4, even though it sells each gallon for $7. For a monopoly, marginal revenue 
is lower than price because a monopoly faces a downward-sloping demand curve. 
To increase the amount sold, a monopoly firm must lower the price it charges to 
all customers. Hence, to sell the fourth gallon of water, the monopolist must earn 
$1 less revenue for each of the first 3 gallons. This $3 loss accounts for the differ-
ence between the price of the fourth gallon ($7) and the marginal revenue of that 
fourth gallon ($4).
Marginal revenue for monopolies is very different from marginal revenue for 
competitive firms. When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, this action has 
two effects on total revenue (P 3 Q):
• The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher, which tends to increase 
total revenue.
• The price effect: The price falls, so P is lower, which tends to decrease total 
revenue.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Because a competitive firm can sell all it wants at the market price, there is no 
price effect. When it increases production by 1 unit, it receives the market price for 
that unit, and it does not receive any less for the units it was already selling. That 
is, because the competitive firm is a price taker, its marginal revenue equals the 
price of its good. By contrast, when a monopoly increases production by 1 unit, it 
must reduce the price it charges for every unit it sells, and this cut in price reduces 
revenue on the units it was already selling. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal 
revenue is less than its price. 
Figure 3 graphs the demand curve and the marginal-revenue curve for a 
monopoly firm. (Because the firm’s price equals its average revenue, the demand 
curve is also the average-revenue curve.) These two curves always start at the 
same point on the vertical axis because the marginal revenue of the first unit sold 
equals the price of the good. But for the reason we just discussed, the monopo-
list’s marginal revenue on all units after the first is less than the price of the good. 
Thus, a monopoly’s marginal-revenue curve lies below its demand curve. 
You can see in Figure 3 (as well as in Table 1) that marginal revenue can even 
become negative. Marginal revenue is negative when the price effect on revenue 
is greater than the output effect. In this case, when the firm produces an extra unit 
of output, the price falls by enough to cause the firm’s total revenue to decline, 
even though the firm is selling more units.
15-2c Profit Maximization
Now that we have considered the revenue of a monopoly firm, we are ready to 
examine how such a firm maximizes profit. Recall from Chapter 1 that one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics is that rational people think at the margin. This lesson 
is as true for monopolists as it is for competitive firms. Here we apply the logic of 
marginal analysis to the monopolist’s decision about how much to produce. 
Figure 4 graphs the demand curve, the marginal-revenue curve, and the cost 
curves for a monopoly firm. All these curves should seem familiar: The demand 
and marginal-revenue curves are like those in Figure 3, and the cost curves are 
like those we encountered in the last two chapters. These curves contain all the 
FIGURE 3
Demand and Marginal-Revenue Curves  
for a Monopoly
The demand curve shows how the quantity 
sold affects the price of the good. The 
marginal-revenue curve shows how the 
firm’s revenue changes when the quantity 
increases by 1 unit. Because the price on 
all units sold must fall if the monopoly 
increases production, marginal revenue is 
less than the price.

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
information we need to determine the level of output that a profit-maximizing 
monopolist will choose.
Suppose, first, that the firm is producing at a low level of output, such as Q1. 
In this case, marginal cost is less than marginal revenue. If the firm increased pro-
duction by 1 unit, the additional revenue would exceed the additional costs, and 
profit would rise. Thus, when marginal cost is less than marginal revenue, the 
firm can increase profit by producing more units.
A similar argument applies at high levels of output, such as Q2. In this case, 
marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue. If the firm reduced production 
by 1 unit, the costs saved would exceed the revenue lost. Thus, if marginal cost is 
greater than marginal revenue, the firm can raise profit by reducing production.
In the end, the firm adjusts its level of production until the quantity reaches QMAX, at 
which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Thus, the monopolist’s  profit-maximizing 
quantity of output is determined by the intersection of the marginal- revenue curve and the 
marginal-cost curve. In Figure 4, this intersection occurs at point A.
You might recall from the previous chapter that competitive firms also choose 
the quantity of output at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In follow-
ing this rule for profit maximization, competitive firms and monopolies are alike. 
But there is also an important difference between these types of firms: The mar-
ginal revenue of a competitive firm equals its price, whereas the marginal revenue 
of a monopoly is less than its price. That is,
For a competitive firm:  P 5 MR 5 MC.
 
For a monopoly firm: P . MR 5 MC.
The equality of marginal revenue and marginal cost determines the profit- 
maximizing quantity for both types of firm. What differs is how the price is 
 related to marginal revenue and marginal cost.
FIGURE 4
Profit Maximization for a Monopoly
A monopoly maximizes profit by choosing 
the quantity at which marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost (point A). It then uses

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
How does the monopoly find the profit-maximizing price for its product? 
The demand curve answers this question because the demand curve relates the 
amount that customers are willing to pay to the quantity sold. Thus, after the 
monopoly firm chooses the quantity of output that equates marginal revenue and 
marginal cost, it uses the demand curve to find the highest price it can charge for 
that quantity. In Figure 4, the profit-maximizing price is found at point B.
We can now see a key difference between markets with competitive firms and 
markets with a monopoly firm: In competitive markets, price equals marginal cost. In 
monopolized markets, price exceeds marginal cost. As we will see in a moment, this 
finding is crucial to understanding the social cost of monopoly.
15-2d A Monopoly’s Profit
How much profit does a monopoly make? To see a monopoly firm’s profit in a 
graph, recall that profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total costs (TC):
Profit 5 TR 2 TC.
We can rewrite this as
Profit 5 (TR/Q 2 TC/Q) 3 Q.
TR/Q is average revenue, which equals the price, P, and TC/Q is average total 
cost, ATC. Therefore,
Profit 5 (P 2 ATC) 3 Q.
This equation for profit (which also holds for competitive firms) allows us to mea-
sure the monopolist’s profit in our graph. 
Consider the shaded box in Figure 5. The height of the box (the segment BC) 
is price minus average total cost, P – ATC, which is the profit on the typical unit 
sold. The width of the box (the segment DC) is the quantity sold, QMAX. Therefore, 
the area of this box is the monopoly firm’s total profit.
Why a Monopoly Does Not Have a Supply Curve
Y
ou may have noticed that we have analyzed the price in a monopoly 
market using the market demand curve and the firm’s cost curves. 
We have not made any mention of the market supply curve. By contrast, 
when we analyzed prices in competitive markets beginning in Chapter 4, 
the two most important words were always supply and demand. 
What happened to the supply curve? Although monopoly firms make 
decisions about what quantity to supply, a monopoly does not have a sup-
ply curve. A supply curve tells us the quantity that firms choose to sup-
ply at any given price. This concept makes sense when we are analyzing 
competitive firms, which are price takers. But a monopoly firm is a price 
maker, not a price taker. It is not meaningful to ask what amount such a 
firm would produce at any given price because it cannot take the price 
as given. Instead, when the firm chooses the quantity to supply, that 
decision (along with the 
demand curve) determines 
the price. 
Indeed, the monopolist’s 
decision about how much 
to supply is impossible to 
separate from the demand curve 
it faces. The shape of the demand curve determines the shape of the 
marginal-revenue curve, which in turn determines the monopolist’s 
profit-maximizing quantity. In a competitive market, each firm’s sup-
ply decisions can be analyzed without knowing the demand curve, but 
that is not true in a monopoly market. Therefore, we never talk about a 
 monopoly’s supply curve. ■

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
CASE 
STUDY
MONOPOLY DRUGS VERSUS GENERIC DRUGS
According to our analysis, prices are determined differently in 
monopolized markets and competitive markets. A natural place to 
test this theory is the market for pharmaceutical drugs because this 
market takes on both market structures. When a firm discovers a new drug, pat-
ent laws give the firm a monopoly on the sale of that drug. But eventually, the 
firm’s patent runs out, and any company can make and sell the drug. At that time, 
the market switches from being monopolistic to being competitive.
What should happen to the price of a drug when the patent runs out? Figure 6 
shows the market for a typical drug. In this figure, the marginal cost of producing 
the drug is constant. (This is approximately true for many drugs.) During the life 
of the patent, the monopoly firm maximizes profit by producing the quantity at 
which marginal revenue equals marginal cost and charging a price well above mar-
ginal cost. But when the patent runs out, the profit from making the drug should 
encourage new firms to enter the market. As the market becomes more competi-
tive, the price should fall to equal marginal cost.
Experience is, in fact, consistent with our theory. When the patent on a drug 
 expires, other companies quickly enter and begin selling generic products that 
are chemically identical to the former monopolist’s brand-name product. Just as 
our analysis predicts, the price of the competitively produced generic drug is well 
 below the price that the monopolist was charging.
The expiration of a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all 
of its market power. Some consumers remain loyal to the brand-name drug, per-
haps out of fear that the new generic drugs are not actually the same as the drug 
they have been using for years. As a result, the former monopolist can continue to 
charge a price above the price charged by its new competitors. 
For example, one of the most widely used antidepressants is the drug fluoxetine, 
which is taken by millions of Americans. Because the patent on this drug expired 
in 2001, a consumer today has the choice between the original drug, sold under the

15-3 The Welfare Cost of Monopolies
Is monopoly a good way to organize a market? We have seen that a monopoly, 
in contrast to a competitive firm, charges a price above marginal cost. From the 
standpoint of consumers, this high price makes monopoly undesirable. At the 
same time, however, the monopoly is earning profit from charging this high price. 
From the standpoint of the owners of the firm, the high price makes monopoly 
very desirable. Is it possible that the benefits to the firm’s owners exceed the costs 
imposed on consumers, making monopoly desirable from the standpoint of soci-
ety as a whole?
We can answer this question using the tools of welfare economics. Recall from 
Chapter 7 that total surplus measures the economic well-being of buyers and 
sellers in a market. Total surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer 
surplus. Consumer surplus is consumers’ willingness to pay for a good minus 
the amount they actually pay for it. Producer surplus is the amount producers 
receive for a good minus their costs of producing it. In this case, there is a single 
producer—the monopolist. 
You can probably guess the result of this analysis. In Chapter 7, we concluded 
that the equilibrium of supply and demand in a competitive market is not only a 
natural outcome but also a desirable one. The invisible hand of the market leads 
to an allocation of resources that makes total surplus as large as it can be. Because 
a monopoly leads to an allocation of resources different from that in a competitive 
market, the outcome must, in some way, fail to maximize total economic well-being.

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
15-3a The Deadweight Loss
We begin by considering what the monopoly firm would do if it were run by a 
benevolent social planner. The social planner cares not only about the profit 
earned by the firm’s owners but also about the benefits received by the firm’s 
consumers. The planner tries to maximize total surplus, which equals producer 
surplus (profit) plus consumer surplus. Keep in mind that total surplus equals the 
value of the good to consumers minus the costs of making the good incurred by 
the monopoly producer. 
Figure 7 analyzes how a benevolent social planner would choose the monop-
oly’s level of output. The demand curve reflects the value of the good to con-
sumers, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The marginal-cost curve 
reflects the costs of the monopolist. Thus, the socially efficient quantity is found where 
the demand curve and the marginal-cost curve intersect. Below this quantity, the value 
of an extra unit to consumers exceeds the cost of providing it, so increasing out-
put would raise total surplus. Above this quantity, the cost of producing an extra 
unit exceeds the value of that unit to consumers, so decreasing output would raise 
total surplus. At the optimal quantity, the value of an extra unit to consumers 
exactly equals the marginal cost of production.
If the social planner were running the monopoly, the firm could achieve this 
efficient outcome by charging the price found at the intersection of the demand 
and marginal-cost curves. Thus, like a competitive firm and unlike a profit-
maximizing monopoly, a social planner would charge a price equal to marginal 
cost. Because this price would give consumers an accurate signal about the cost of 
producing the good, consumers would buy the efficient quantity.
We can evaluate the welfare effects of monopoly by comparing the level of out-
put that the monopolist chooses to the level of output that a social planner would 
FIGURE 7
The Efficient Level of Output
A benevolent social planner maximizes  
total surplus in the market by choosing the 
level of output where the demand curve 
and marginal-cost curve intersect. Below 
this level, the value of the good to the 
marginal buyer (as reflected in the demand 
curve) exceeds the marginal cost of making 
the good. Above this level, the value to the 
marginal buyer is less than marginal cost.

choose. As we have seen, the monopolist chooses to produce and sell the quantity 
of output at which the marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves intersect; the 
social planner would choose the quantity at which the demand and marginal-cost 
curves intersect. Figure 8 shows the comparison. The monopolist produces less than 
the socially efficient quantity of output. 
We can also view the inefficiency of monopoly in terms of the monopolist’s 
price. Because the market demand curve describes a negative relationship 
 between the price and quantity of the good, a quantity that is inefficiently low is 
equivalent to a price that is inefficiently high. When a monopolist charges a price 
above marginal cost, some potential consumers value the good at more than its 
marginal cost but less than the monopolist’s price. These consumers do not buy 
the good. Because the value these consumers place on the good is greater than the 
cost of providing it to them, this result is inefficient. Thus, monopoly pricing pre-
vents some mutually beneficial trades from taking place. 
The inefficiency of monopoly can be measured with a deadweight loss tri-
angle, as illustrated in Figure 8. Because the demand curve reflects the value to 
consumers and the marginal-cost curve reflects the costs to the monopoly pro-
ducer, the area of the deadweight loss triangle between the demand curve and the 
 marginal-cost curve equals the total surplus lost because of monopoly pricing. It 
represents the reduction in economic well-being that results from the monopoly’s 
use of its market power.
The deadweight loss caused by a monopoly is similar to the deadweight loss 
caused by a tax. Indeed, a monopolist is like a private tax collector. As we saw 
in Chapter 8, a tax on a good places a wedge between consumers’ willingness to 
pay (as reflected by the demand curve) and producers’ costs (as reflected by the 
supply curve). Because a monopoly exerts its market power by charging a price 
above marginal cost, it creates a similar wedge. In both cases, the wedge causes 
the quantity sold to fall short of the social optimum. The difference between the 
two cases is that the government gets the revenue from a tax, whereas a private 
firm gets the monopoly profit.
FIGURE 8
The Inefficiency of Monopoly
Because a monopoly charges a price above 
marginal cost, not all consumers who value 
the good at more than its cost buy it. Thus, 
the quantity produced and sold by a  
monopoly is below the socially efficient 
level. The deadweight loss is represented 
by the area of the triangle between the  
demand curve (which reflects the value  
of the good to consumers) and the  
marginal-cost curve (which reflects the 
costs of the monopoly producer).

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
15-3b The Monopoly’s Profit: A Social Cost?
It is tempting to decry monopolies for “profiteering” at the expense of the public. 
And indeed, a monopoly firm does earn a profit by virtue of its market power. 
According to the economic analysis of monopoly, however, the firm’s profit is not 
in itself necessarily a problem for society.
Welfare in a monopolized market, as in all markets, includes the welfare of 
both consumers and producers. Whenever a consumer pays an extra dollar to 
a producer because of a monopoly price, the consumer is worse off by a dollar 
and the producer is better off by the same amount. This transfer from the con-
sumers of the good to the owners of the monopoly does not affect the market’s 
total  surplus—the sum of consumer and producer surplus. In other words, the 
monopoly profit itself represents not a reduction in the size of the economic pie 
but merely a bigger slice for producers and a smaller slice for consumers.  Unless 
consumers are for some reason more deserving than producers—a normative 
judgment about equity that goes beyond the realm of economic efficiency—the 
monopoly profit is not a social problem.
The problem in a monopolized market arises because the firm produces and 
sells a quantity of output below the level that maximizes total surplus. The 
deadweight loss measures how much the economic pie shrinks as a result. This 
inefficiency is connected to the monopoly’s high price: Consumers buy fewer 
units when the firm raises its price above marginal cost. But keep in mind that 
the profit earned on the units that continue to be sold is not the problem. The 
problem stems from the inefficiently low quantity of output. Put differently, if 
the high monopoly price did not discourage some consumers from buying the 
good, it would raise producer surplus by exactly the amount it reduced con-
sumer surplus, leaving total surplus the same as that achieved by a benevolent 
social planner.
There is, however, a possible exception to this conclusion. Suppose that a 
 monopoly firm has to incur additional costs to maintain its monopoly position. 
For example, a firm with a government-created monopoly might need to hire lob-
byists to convince lawmakers to continue its monopoly. In this case, the monopoly 
may use up some of its monopoly profits paying for these additional costs. If so, 
the social loss from monopoly includes both these costs and the deadweight loss 
resulting from reduced output. 
QuickQuiz
How does a monopolist’s quantity of output compare to the quantity of 
output that maximizes total surplus? How does this difference relate to 
the deadweight loss?
15-4 Price Discrimination
So far, we have been assuming that the monopoly firm charges the same price to 
all customers. Yet in many cases, firms sell the same good to different customers 
for different prices, even though the costs of producing for the two customers are 
the same. This practice is called price discrimination.
Before discussing the behavior of a price-discriminating monopolist, we should 
note that price discrimination is not possible when a good is sold in a competi-
tive market. In a competitive market, many firms are selling the same good at the 
market price. No firm is willing to charge a lower price to any customer because 
the firm can sell all it wants at the market price. And if any firm tried to charge a

selling the same good at

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
higher price to a customer, that customer would buy from another firm. For a firm 
to price discriminate, it must have some market power.
15-4a A Parable about Pricing
To understand why a monopolist would price discriminate, let’s consider an 
example. Imagine that you are the president of Readalot Publishing Company. 
Readalot’s best-selling author has just written a new novel. To keep things 
simple, let’s imagine that you pay the author a flat $2 million for the exclusive 
rights to publish the book. Let’s also assume that the cost of printing the book is  
zero (as it would be, for example, for an e-book). Readalot’s profit, therefore, 
is the revenue from selling the book minus the $2 million it has paid to the 
author. Given these assumptions, how would you, as Readalot’s president, 
decide the book’s price?
Your first step is to estimate the demand for the book. Readalot’s marketing 
department tells you that the book will attract two types of readers. The book will 
appeal to the author’s 100,000 die-hard fans who are willing to pay as much as 
$30. In addition, it will appeal to about 400,000 less enthusiastic readers who will 
pay up to $5.
If Readalot charges a single price to all customers, what price maximizes 
profit? There are two natural prices to consider: $30 is the highest price Read-
alot can charge and still get the 100,000 die-hard fans, and $5 is the highest price 
it can charge and still get the entire market of 500,000 potential readers. Solving 
Readalot’s problem is a matter of simple arithmetic. At a price of $30, Readalot 
sells 100,000 copies, has revenue of $3 million, and makes profit of $1 million. At 
a price of $5, it sells 500,000 copies, has revenue of $2.5 million, and makes profit 
of $500,000. Thus, Readalot maximizes profit by charging $30 and forgoing the 
opportunity to sell to the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers.
Notice that Readalot’s decision causes a deadweight loss. There are 400,000 
readers willing to pay $5 for the book, and the marginal cost of providing it to 
them is zero. Thus, $2 million of total surplus is lost when Readalot charges the 
higher price. This deadweight loss is the inefficiency that arises whenever a mo-
nopolist charges a price above marginal cost.
Now suppose that Readalot’s marketing department makes a discovery: These 
two groups of readers are in separate markets. The die-hard fans live in Australia, 
and the other readers live in the United States. Moreover, it is hard for readers in 
one country to buy books in the other. 
In response to this discovery, Readalot can change its marketing strategy and 
increase profits. To the 100,000 Australian readers, it can charge $30 for the book. 
To the 400,000 American readers, it can charge $5 for the book. In this case, rev-
enue is $3 million in Australia and $2 million in the United States, for a total of  
$5 million. Profit is then $3 million, which is substantially greater than the 
$1 million the company could earn charging the same $30 price to all customers. 
Not surprisingly, Readalot chooses to follow this strategy of price discrimination.
The story of Readalot Publishing is hypothetical, but it describes the business 
practice of many publishing companies. Consider the price differential between 
hardcover books and paperbacks. When a publisher has a new novel, it initially 
releases an expensive hardcover edition and later releases a cheaper paperback 
edition. The difference in price between these two editions far exceeds the differ-
ence in printing costs. The publisher is price discriminating by selling the hard-
cover to die-hard fans and the paperback to less enthusiastic readers, thereby 
increasing its profit.

305
CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
15-4b The Moral of the Story
Like any parable, the story of Readalot Publishing is stylized. Yet also like any 
parable, it teaches some general lessons. In this case, three lessons can be learned 
about price discrimination.
The first and most obvious lesson is that price discrimination is a rational 
strategy for a profit-maximizing monopolist. That is, by charging different prices 
to different customers, a monopolist can increase its profit. In essence, a price- 
discriminating monopolist charges each customer a price closer to her willingness 
to pay than is possible with a single price.
The second lesson is that price discrimination requires the ability to separate 
customers according to their willingness to pay. In our example, customers were 
separated geographically. But sometimes monopolists choose other differences, 
such as age or income, to distinguish among customers.
A corollary to this second lesson is that certain market forces can prevent firms 
from price discriminating. In particular, one such force is arbitrage, the process 
of buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it in another market 
at a higher price to profit from the price difference. In our example, if Australian  
bookstores could buy the book in the United States and resell it to Australian 
readers, the arbitrage would prevent Readalot from price discriminating, because 
no Australian would buy the book at the higher price.
The third lesson from our parable is the most surprising: Price discrimination 
can raise economic welfare. Recall that a deadweight loss arises when Readalot 
charges a single $30 price because the 400,000 less enthusiastic readers do not end 
up with the book, even though they value it at more than its marginal cost of pro-
duction. By contrast, when Readalot price discriminates, all readers get the book 
and the outcome is efficient. Thus, price discrimination can eliminate the ineffi-
ciency inherent in monopoly pricing.
Note that in this example the increase in welfare from price discrimination 
shows up as higher producer surplus rather than higher consumer surplus. Con-
sumers are no better off for having bought the book: The price they pay exactly 
equals the value they place on the book, so they receive no consumer surplus. 
The entire increase in total surplus from price discrimination accrues to Readalot 
Publishing in the form of higher profit. 
15-4c The Analytics of Price Discrimination
Let’s consider a bit more formally how price discrimination affects economic wel-
fare. We begin by assuming that the monopolist can price discriminate perfectly. 
Perfect price discrimination describes a situation in which the monopolist knows  
exactly each customer’s willingness to pay and can charge each customer a differ-
ent price. In this case, the monopolist charges each customer exactly her willing-
ness to pay, and the monopolist gets the entire surplus in every transaction.
Figure 9 illustrates producer and consumer surplus with and without price dis-
crimination. To keep things simple, this figure is drawn assuming constant per 
unit costs—that is, marginal cost and average total cost are constant and equal. 
Without price discrimination, the firm charges a single price above marginal cost, 
as shown in panel (a). Because some potential customers who value the good at 
more than marginal cost do not buy it at this high price, the monopoly causes a 
deadweight loss. Yet when a firm can perfectly price discriminate, as shown in 
panel (b), each customer who values the good at more than marginal cost buys 
the good and is charged her willingness to pay. All mutually beneficial trades take

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
place, no deadweight loss occurs, and the entire surplus derived from the market 
goes to the monopoly producer in the form of profit.
In reality, of course, price discrimination is not perfect. Customers do not walk 
into stores with signs displaying their willingness to pay. Instead, firms price dis-
criminate by dividing customers into groups: young versus old, weekday versus 
weekend shoppers, Americans versus Australians, and so on. Unlike those in our 
parable of Readalot Publishing, customers within each group differ in their will-
ingness to pay for the product, making perfect price discrimination impossible.
How does this imperfect price discrimination affect welfare? The analysis of 
these pricing schemes is complicated, and it turns out that there is no general 
answer to this question. Compared with the single-price monopoly outcome, 
imperfect price discrimination can raise, lower, or leave unchanged the total sur-
plus in a market. The only certain conclusion is that price discrimination raises 
the monopoly’s profit; otherwise, the firm would choose to charge all customers 
the same price.
15-4d Examples of Price Discrimination
Firms in our economy use various business strategies aimed at charging different 
prices to different customers. Now that we understand the economics of price dis-
crimination, let’s consider some examples.
Movie Tickets   Many movie theaters charge a lower price for children and  senior 
citizens than for other patrons. This fact is hard to explain in a competitive mar-
ket. In a competitive market, price equals marginal cost, and the marginal cost 
of providing a seat for a child or senior citizen is the same as the marginal cost

Panel (a) shows a monopoly that charges the same price to all customers. Total surplus in this 
market equals the sum of profit (producer surplus) and consumer surplus. Panel (b) shows a  
monopoly that can perfectly price discriminate. Because consumer surplus equals zero, total  
surplus now equals the firm’s profit. Comparing these two panels, you can see that perfect  
price discrimination raises profit, raises total surplus, and lowers consumer surplus.

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
of providing a seat for anyone else. Yet the differential pricing is easily 
 explained if movie theaters have some local monopoly power and if chil-
dren and senior citizens have a lower willingness to pay for a ticket. In this 
case, movie theaters raise their profit by price discriminating.
Airline Prices  Seats on airplanes are sold at many different prices. Most 
airlines charge a lower price for a round-trip ticket between two cities if the 
traveler stays over a Saturday night. At first, this seems odd. Why should it 
matter to the airline whether a passenger stays over a Saturday night? The 
reason is that this rule provides a way to separate business travelers and 
leisure travelers. A passenger on a business trip has a high willingness to 
pay and, most likely, does not want to stay over a Saturday night. By con-
trast, a passenger traveling for personal reasons has a lower willingness to 
pay and is more likely to be willing to stay over a Saturday night. Thus, the 
airlines can successfully price discriminate by charging a lower price for 
passengers who stay over a Saturday night.
Discount Coupons  Many companies offer discount coupons to the public in 
newspapers, magazines, or online. A buyer simply has to clip the coupon to get 
$0.50 off her next purchase. Why do companies offer these coupons? Why don’t 
they just cut the price of the product by $0.50?
The answer is that coupons allow companies to price discriminate. Compa-
nies know that not all customers are willing to spend time clipping coupons. 
Moreover, the willingness to clip coupons is related to the customer’s willing-
ness to pay for the good. A rich and busy executive is unlikely to spend her time 
clipping discount coupons out of the newspaper, and she is probably willing to 
pay a higher price for many goods. A person who is unemployed is more likely 
to clip coupons and to have a lower willingness to pay. Thus, by charging a 
lower price only to those customers who clip coupons, firms can successfully 
price discriminate.
Financial Aid  Many colleges and universities give financial aid to needy stu-
dents. One can view this policy as a type of price discrimination. Wealthy stu-
dents have greater financial resources and, therefore, a higher willingness to pay 
than needy students. By charging high tuition and selectively offering financial 
aid, schools in effect charge prices to customers based on the value they place on 
going to that school. This behavior is similar to that of any price-discriminating 
monopolist. 
Quantity Discounts   So far in our examples of price discrimination, the 
 monopolist charges different prices to different customers. Sometimes, however, 
 monopolists price discriminate by charging different prices to the same customer 
for different units that the customer buys. For example, many firms offer lower 
prices to customers who buy large quantities. A bakery might charge $0.50 for 
each donut but $5 for a dozen. This is a form of price discrimination because the 
customer pays a higher price for the first unit she buys than for the twelfth. Quan-
tity discounts are often a successful way of price discriminating because a cus-
tomer’s willingness to pay for an additional unit declines as she buys more units.

to different students, which makes 
data on the cost of education harder 
to interpret.
Misconceptions 101: Why  
College Costs Aren’t Soaring
By Evan Soltas 
C
onventional wisdom suggests that U.S. 
colleges and universities have become 
sharply more expensive in recent years.
“When kids do graduate, the most daunt-
ing challenge can be the cost of college,” 
President Barack Obama said in his 2012 
State of the Union address. “We can’t just 
keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll 
run out of money.”
At first, the view that the cost of col-
lege is rising appears to have data on its 
side. Published tuition prices and fees at 
colleges have risen three times faster than 
the rate of Consumer Price Index inflation 
since 1978, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics…. 
Real tuition and fees have increased, to 
be sure, but hardly as significantly as the 
 media often report or the data suggest at face 
value. The inflation-adjusted net price of col-
lege has risen only modestly over the last two 
decades, according to data from the College 
Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges.
What has happened is a shift toward price 
discrimination—offering multiple prices for 
the same product. Universities have offset 
the increase in sticker price for most families 
through an expansion of grant-based financial 
aid and scholarships. That has caused the BLS 
measure to rise without increasing the net cost.
Wealthier families now pay more than 
ever to send their children to college. But for 
much of the middle class, the real net cost 
of college has not changed significantly; for 
much of the poor, the expansion of aid has 
 increased the accessibility and affordability 
of a college education…. 
The nation’s most selective institutions 
are leading the trend toward income-based 
price discrimination. For example, at Harvard 
University, the majority of students receive 
financial aid: In 2012, one year of undergrad-
uate education had a sticker price of $54,496 
and came with an average grant of roughly 
$41,000.
In other words, the cost burden of college 
has become significantly more progressive 
since the 1990s. Students from wealthier 
families not only now pay more for their own 
educations but also have come to heavily 
subsidize the costs of the less fortunate. ■

We have seen that monopolies, in contrast to competitive markets, fail to allocate 
resources efficiently. Monopolies produce less than the socially desirable quantity 
of output and charge prices above marginal cost. Policymakers in the government 
can respond to the problem of monopoly in one of four ways:
• By trying to make monopolized industries more competitive
• By regulating the behavior of the monopolies
• By turning some private monopolies into public enterprises
• By doing nothing at all

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
large soft-drink companies would make the U.S. soft-drink market substan-
tially less competitive and, as a result, would reduce the economic well-being 
of the country as a whole. If so, the Department of Justice would challenge the 
merger in court, and if the judge agreed, the two companies would not be al-
lowed to merge. It is precisely this kind of challenge that prevented  software 
giant Microsoft from buying Intuit in 1994. Similarly, in 2011, the government 
blocked the phone giant AT&T from buying its competitor T-Mobile.
The government derives this power over private industry from the an-
titrust laws, a collection of statutes aimed at curbing monopoly power. 
The first and most important of these laws was the Sherman Antitrust Act, 
which Congress passed in 1890 to reduce the market power of the large and 
powerful “trusts” that were viewed as dominating the economy at the time. 
The Clayton Antitrust Act, passed in 1914, strengthened the government’s 
powers and authorized private lawsuits. As the U.S. Supreme Court once put 
it, the antitrust laws are “a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed 
at  preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade.”
The antitrust laws give the government various ways to promote compe-
tition. They allow the government to prevent mergers, such as the merger 
between AT&T and T-Mobile. At times, they allow the government to break up 
a large company into a group of smaller ones. Finally, the antitrust laws  prevent com-
panies from coordinating their activities in ways that make markets less competitive.
Antitrust laws have costs as well as benefits. Sometimes companies merge not 
to reduce competition but to lower costs through more efficient joint production. 
These benefits from mergers are sometimes called synergies. For example, many U.S. 
banks have merged in recent years and, by combining operations, have been able to 
reduce administrative staff. The airline industry has experienced a similar consoli-
dation. If antitrust laws are to raise social welfare, the government must be able to 
determine which mergers are desirable and which are not. That is, it must be able 
to measure and compare the social benefit from synergies with 
the social costs of reduced competition. Critics of the antitrust 
laws are skeptical that the government can perform the neces-
sary cost–benefit analysis with sufficient accuracy. In the end, 
the application of antitrust laws is often controversial, even 
among the experts.
15-5b Regulation
Another way the government deals with the problem of 
monopoly is by regulating the behavior of monopolists. This 
solution is common in the case of natural monopolies, such 
as water and electric companies. These companies are not 
allowed to charge any price they want. Instead, government 
agencies regulate their prices. 
What price should the government set for a natural monop-
oly? This question is not as easy as it might at first appear. One 
might conclude that the price should equal the monopolist’s 
marginal cost. If price equals marginal cost, customers will 
buy the quantity of the monopolist’s output that maximizes 
total surplus and the allocation of resources will be efficient.
There are, however, two practical problems with marginal- 
cost pricing as a regulatory system. The first arises from the 
logic of cost curves. By definition, natural monopolies have

declining average total cost. As we first discussed in Chapter 13, when average 
total cost is declining, marginal cost is less than average total cost. This situation 
is illustrated in Figure 10, which shows a firm with a large fixed cost and then 
constant marginal cost thereafter. If regulators were to set price equal to marginal 
cost, that price would be less than the firm’s average total cost and the firm would 
lose money. Instead of charging such a low price, the monopoly firm would just 
exit the industry.
Regulators can respond to this problem in various ways, none of which is per-
fect. One way is to subsidize the monopolist. In essence, the government picks up 
the losses inherent in marginal-cost pricing. Yet to pay for the subsidy, the gov-
ernment needs to raise money through taxation, which involves its own dead-
weight losses. Alternatively, the regulators can allow the monopolist to charge a 
price higher than marginal cost. If the regulated price equals average total cost, 
the monopolist earns exactly zero economic profit. Yet average-cost pricing leads 
to deadweight losses because the monopolist’s price no longer reflects the mar-
ginal cost of producing the good. In essence, average-cost pricing is like a tax on 
the good the monopolist is selling.
The second problem with marginal-cost pricing as a regulatory system (and 
with average-cost pricing as well) is that it gives the monopolist no incentive to 
reduce costs. Each firm in a competitive market tries to reduce its costs because 
lower costs mean higher profits. But if a regulated monopolist knows that regu-
lators will reduce prices whenever costs fall, the monopolist will not benefit from 
lower costs. In practice, regulators deal with this problem by allowing monopo-
lists to keep some of the benefits from lower costs in the form of higher profit, a 
practice that requires some departure from marginal-cost pricing.
15-5c Public Ownership
The third policy used by the government to deal with monopoly is public own-
ership. That is, rather than regulating a natural monopoly that is run by a pri-
vate firm, the government can run the monopoly itself. This solution is common 
in many European countries, where the government owns and operates utilities 
FIGURE 10
Marginal-Cost Pricing for a Natural 
Monopoly
Because a natural monopoly has declining 
average total cost, marginal cost is less 
than average total cost. Therefore, if regu-
lators require a natural monopoly to charge 
a price equal to marginal cost, price will be 
below average total cost, and the monopoly 
will lose money.

CHAPTER 15   MONOPOLY
such as telephone, water, and electric companies. In the United States, the gov-
ernment runs the Postal Service. The delivery of ordinary first-class mail is often 
thought to be a natural monopoly. 
Economists usually prefer private to public ownership of natural monopolies. 
The key issue is how the ownership of the firm affects the costs of production. 
Private owners have an incentive to minimize costs as long as they reap part of 
the benefit in the form of higher profit. If the firm’s managers are doing a bad job 
of keeping costs down, the firm’s owners will fire them. By contrast, if the govern-
ment bureaucrats who run a monopoly do a bad job, the losers are the customers 
and taxpayers, whose only recourse is the political system. The bureaucrats may 
become a special-interest group and attempt to block cost-reducing reforms. Put 
simply, as a way of ensuring that firms are well run, the voting booth is less reli-
able than the profit motive.
15-5d Doing Nothing
Each of the foregoing policies aimed at reducing the problem of monopoly has 
drawbacks. As a result, some economists argue that it is often best for the gov-
ernment not to try to remedy the inefficiencies of monopoly pricing. Here is the 
assessment of economist George Stigler, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in 
industrial organization:
A famous theorem in economics states that a competitive enterprise economy 
will produce the largest possible income from a given stock of resources. No 
real economy meets the exact conditions of the theorem, and all real economies 
will fall short of the ideal economy—a difference called “market failure.” In 
my view, however, the degree of “market failure” for the American economy 
is much smaller than the “political failure” arising from the imperfections of 
economic policies found in real political systems.
As this quotation makes clear, determining the proper role of the government in 
the economy requires judgments about politics as well as economics.

15-6 Conclusion: The Prevalence of Monopolies
This chapter has discussed the behavior of firms that have control over the 
prices they charge. We have seen that these firms behave very differently from 
the competitive firms studied in the previous chapter. Table 2 summarizes some 
of the key similarities and differences between competitive and monopoly 
markets.
From the standpoint of public policy, a crucial result is that a monopolist pro-
duces less than the socially efficient quantity and charges a price above marginal 
cost. As a result, a monopoly causes deadweight losses. In some cases, these 
 inefficiencies can be mitigated through price discrimination by the monopolist. 
But other times, they call for policymakers to take an active role.
How prevalent are the problems of monopoly? There are two answers to this 
question.
In one sense, monopolies are common. Most firms have some control over the 
prices they charge. They are not forced to charge the market price for their goods

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
because their goods are not exactly the same as those offered by other firms. 
A Ford Taurus is not the same as a Toyota Camry. Ben and Jerry’s ice cream is 
not the same as Breyer’s. Each of these goods has a downward-sloping demand 
curve, which gives each producer some degree of monopoly power.
Yet firms with substantial monopoly power are rare. Few goods are truly 
unique. Most have substitutes that, even if not exactly the same, are similar. Ben 
and Jerry can raise the price of their ice cream a little without losing all their sales, 
but if they raise it a lot, sales will fall substantially as their customers switch to 
other brands. 
In the end, monopoly power is a matter of degree. It is true that many firms 
have some monopoly power. It is also true that their monopoly power is usually 
limited. In such a situation, we will not go far wrong assuming that firms operate 
in competitive markets, even if that is not precisely the case.

SUMMARY 
• A monopoly is a firm that is the sole seller in its market. A 
monopoly arises when a single firm owns a key resource, 
when the government gives a firm the exclusive right to 
produce a good, or when a single firm can supply the 
 entire market at a lower cost than many firms could.
• Because a monopoly is the sole producer in its mar-
ket, it faces a downward-sloping demand curve for 
its product. When a monopoly increases production 
by 1 unit, it causes the price of its good to fall, which 
reduces the amount of revenue earned on all units pro-
duced. As a result, a monopoly’s marginal revenue is 
always below the price of its good.
• Like a competitive firm, a monopoly firm maximizes 
profit by producing the quantity at which marginal 
revenue equals marginal cost. The monopoly then sets 
the price at which that quantity is demanded. Unlike a 
competitive firm, a monopoly firm’s price exceeds its 
marginal revenue, so its price exceeds marginal cost.
• A monopolist’s profit-maximizing level of output is 
 below the level that maximizes the sum of consumer 
and producer surplus. That is, when the monopoly 
charges a price above marginal cost, some consumers 
who value the good more than its cost of production 
do not buy it. As a result, monopoly causes dead-
weight losses similar to those caused by taxes.
• A monopolist can often increase profits by charging 
different prices for the same good based on a buyer’s 
willingness to pay. This practice of price discrimination 
can raise economic welfare by getting the good to some 
consumers who would otherwise not buy it. In the 
 extreme case of perfect price discrimination, the dead-
weight loss of monopoly is completely eliminated and 
the entire surplus in the market goes to the monopoly 
producer. More generally, when price discrimination is 
imperfect, it can either raise or lower welfare compared 
to the outcome with a single monopoly price.
• Policymakers can respond to the inefficiency of 
 monopoly behavior in four ways. They can use 
the  antitrust laws to try to make the industry more 
competitive. They can regulate the prices that the 
 monopoly charges. They can turn the monopolist into 
a government-run enterprise. Or, if the market failure 
is deemed small compared to the inevitable imperfec-
tions of policies, they can do nothing at all.

The author is paid $2 million to write the book, and 
the marginal cost of publishing the book is a constant 
$10 per book.
a. Compute total revenue, total cost, and profit  
at each quantity. What quantity would a  
profit-maximizing publisher choose? What  
price would it charge?
b. Compute marginal revenue. (Recall that  
MR 5 ΔTR/ΔQ.) How does marginal revenue 
compare to the price? Explain.
c. Graph the marginal-revenue, marginal-cost, and 
demand curves. At what quantity do the margin-
al-revenue and marginal-cost curves cross? What 
does this signify?
d. In your graph, shade in the deadweight loss.  
Explain in words what this means.
e. If the author were paid $3 million instead of  
$2 million to write the book, how would this  
affect the publisher’s decision regarding what 
price to charge? Explain.
f. Suppose the publisher was not profit-maximizing 
but was concerned with maximizing economic  
efficiency. What price would it charge for the 
book? How much profit would it make at this 
price?
2. A small town is served by many competing supermar-
kets, which have the same constant marginal cost. 
a. Using a diagram of the market for groceries,  
show the consumer surplus, producer surplus, 
and total surplus.
b. Now suppose that the independent supermarkets 
combine into one chain. Using a new diagram, 
show the new consumer surplus, producer  
surplus, and total surplus. Relative to the compet-
itive market, what is the transfer from consumers 
to producers? What is the deadweight loss?

Is creating this monopoly necessarily bad public  
policy? Explain.
2. Define natural monopoly. What does the size of a  
market have to do with whether an industry is a  
natural monopoly?
3. Why is a monopolist’s marginal revenue less than  
the price of its good? Can marginal revenue ever be 
negative? Explain.
4. Draw the demand, marginal-revenue, average- 
total-cost, and marginal-cost curves for a  
monopolist. Show the profit-maximizing level

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
7. The residents of the town Ectenia all love economics, 
and the mayor proposes building an economics  
museum. The museum has a fixed cost of $2,400,000 
and no variable costs. There are 100,000 town  
residents, and each has the same demand for  
museum visits: QD 5 10 2 P, where P is the price of 
admission.
a. Graph the museum’s average-total-cost curve 
and its marginal-cost curve. What kind of market 
would describe the museum?
b. The mayor proposes financing the museum with 
a lump-sum tax of $24 and then opening the 
museum to the public for free. How many times 
would each person visit? Calculate the benefit 
each person would get from the museum, mea-
sured as consumer surplus minus the new tax.
c. The mayor’s anti-tax opponent says the museum 
should finance itself by charging an admission fee. 
What is the lowest price the museum can charge 
without incurring losses? (Hint: Find the number 
of visits and museum profits for prices of $2, $3, 
$4, and $5.)
d. For the break-even price you found in part (c),  
calculate each resident’s consumer surplus.  
Compared with the mayor’s plan, who is better 
off with this admission fee, and who is worse off? 
Explain.
e. What real-world considerations absent in the 
problem above might provide reasons to favor an 
admission fee?
8. Henry Potter owns the only well in town that pro-
duces clean drinking water. He faces the following 
demand, marginal revenue, and marginal cost curves:
 
Demand: P 5 70 2 Q
Marginal Revenue: MR 5 70 2 2Q
Marginal Cost: MC 5 10 1 Q
a. Graph these three curves. Assuming that  
Mr. Potter maximizes profit, what quantity does 
he produce? What price does he charge? Show 
these results on your graph.
b. Mayor George Bailey, concerned about water con-
sumers, is considering a price ceiling that is  
10 percent below the monopoly price derived in 
part (a). What quantity would be demanded at 
this new price? Would the profit-maximizing  
Mr. Potter produce that amount? Explain. (Hint: 
Think about marginal cost.) 
c. George’s Uncle Billy says that a price ceiling is a 
bad idea because price ceilings cause shortages. 
Is he right in this case? What size shortage would 
the price ceiling create? Explain.
d. George’s friend Clarence, who is even more con-
cerned about consumers, suggests a price ceiling 
50 percent below the monopoly price. What quan-
tity would be demanded at this price? How much 
would Mr. Potter produce? In this case, is Uncle 
Billy right? What size shortage would the price 
ceiling create?
9. Only one firm produces and sells soccer balls in the 
country of Wiknam, and as the story begins, interna-
tional trade in soccer balls is prohibited. The following 
equations describe the monopolist’s demand, mar-
ginal revenue, total cost, and marginal cost:
 
Demand: P 5 10 2 Q
 
Marginal Revenue: MR 5 10 2 2Q
Total Cost: TC 5 3 1 Q 1 0.5 Q2
Marginal Cost: MC 5 1 1 Q,
where Q is quantity and P is the price measured in 
Wiknamian dollars. 
a. How many soccer balls does the monopolist pro-
duce? At what price are they sold? What is the 
monopolist’s profit?
b. One day, the King of Wiknam decrees that  
henceforth there will be free trade—either  
imports or exports—of soccer balls at the world 
price of $6. The firm is now a price taker in a 
competitive market. What happens to domestic 
production of soccer balls? To domestic  
consumption? Does Wiknam export or import 
soccer balls?
c. In our analysis of international trade in Chapter 9,  
a country becomes an exporter when the price 
without trade is below the world price and an 
importer when the price without trade is above 
the world price. Does that conclusion hold in your 
answers to parts (a) and (b)? Explain.
d. Suppose that the world price was not $6 but, 
instead, happened to be exactly the same as the 
domestic price without trade as determined in 
part (a). Would allowing trade have changed any-
thing in the Wiknamian economy? Explain. How 
does the result here compare with the analysis in 
Chapter 9?

where Q indicates the number of copies sold and P is 
the price in Ectenian dollars.
a. Find the price and quantity that maximize the 
company’s profit.
b. Find the price and quantity that would maximize 
social welfare.
c. Calculate the deadweight loss from monopoly.
d. Suppose, in addition to the costs above, the  
director of the film has to be paid. The company is 
considering four options:
i. a flat fee of 2,000 Ectenian dollars. 
ii. 50 percent of the profits.
iii. 150 Ectenian dollars per unit sold. 
iv. 50 percent of the revenue.
For each option, calculate the profit-maximizing 
price and quantity. Which, if any, of these compensa-
tion schemes would alter the deadweight loss from 
monopoly? Explain.
11. Larry, Curly, and Moe run the only saloon in town. 
Larry wants to sell as many drinks as possible without 
losing money. Curly wants the saloon to bring in as 
much revenue as possible. Moe wants to make the 
largest possible profits. Using a single diagram of  
the saloon’s demand curve and its cost curves, show 
the price and quantity combinations favored by each 
of the three partners. Explain. (Hint: Only one of these 
partners will want to set marginal revenue equal to 
marginal cost.)
12. Many schemes for price discrimination involve some 
cost. For example, discount coupons take up the time 
and resources of both the buyer and the seller. This 
question considers the implications of costly price 
discrimination. To keep things simple, let’s assume 
that our monopolist’s production costs are simply 
proportional to output so that average total cost and 
marginal cost are constant and equal to each other.
a. Draw the cost, demand, and marginal- revenue 
curves for the monopolist. Show the price 
the monopolist would charge without price 
discrimination. 
b. In your diagram, mark the area equal to the mo-
nopolist’s profit and call it X. Mark the area equal 
to consumer surplus and call it Y. Mark the area 
equal to the deadweight loss and call it Z.
c. Now suppose that the monopolist can perfectly 
price discriminate. What is the monopolist’s 
profit? (Give your answer in terms of X, Y, and Z.)
d. What is the change in the monopolist’s profit from 
price discrimination? What is the change in total 
surplus from price discrimination? Which change 
is larger? Explain. (Give your answer in terms of 
X, Y, and Z.)
e. Now suppose that there is some cost associated 
with price discrimination. To model this cost, let’s 
assume that the monopolist has to pay a fixed cost 
C to price discriminate. How would a monopolist 
make the decision whether to pay this fixed cost? 
(Give your answer in terms of X, Y, Z, and C.)
f. How would a benevolent social planner, who 
cares about total surplus, decide whether the  
monopolist should price discriminate? (Give your 
answer in terms of X, Y, Z, and C.)
g. Compare your answers to parts (e) and (f). How 
does the monopolist’s incentive to price discrimi-
nate differ from the social planner’s? Is it possible 
that the monopolist will price discriminate even 
though doing so is not socially desirable?

Monopolistic Competition
CHAPTER

Y
ou walk into a bookstore to buy a book to read during your next vacation. 
On the store’s shelves you find a Patricia Cornwell mystery, a Stephen King 
thriller, a Nathaniel Philbrick history, a Suzanne Collins dystopian survival 
romance, and many other choices. When you pick out a book and buy it, what 
kind of market are you participating in? 
On the one hand, the market for books seems competitive. As you look over 
the shelves at your bookstore, you find many authors and many publishers  vying 
for your attention. A buyer in this market has thousands of competing products 
from which to choose. And because anyone can enter the industry by writing 
and  publishing a book, the book business is not very profitable. For every 
highly paid novelist, there are hundreds of struggling ones.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
On the other hand, the market for books seems monopolistic. Because each 
book is unique, publishers have some latitude in choosing what price to charge. 
The sellers in this market are price makers rather than price takers. And indeed, 
the price of books greatly exceeds marginal cost. The price of a typical hardcover 
novel, for instance, is about $25, whereas the cost of printing one additional copy 
of the novel is less than $5.
The market for novels fits neither the competitive nor the monopoly model. 
 Instead, it is best described by the model of monopolistic competition, the subject 
of this chapter. The term “monopolistic competition” might at first seem to be an 
oxymoron, like “jumbo shrimp.” But as we will see, monopolistically competitive 
industries are monopolistic in some ways and competitive in others. The model 
describes not only the publishing industry but also the market for many other goods 
and services.
16-1 Between Monopoly and Perfect Competition
The previous two chapters analyzed markets with many competitive firms and 
markets with a single monopoly firm. In Chapter 14, we saw that the price in a 
perfectly competitive market always equals the marginal cost of production. We 
also saw that, in the long run, entry and exit drive economic profit to zero, so the 
price also equals average total cost. In Chapter 15, we saw how monopoly firms 
can use their market power to keep prices above marginal cost, leading to a pos-
itive economic profit for the firm and a deadweight loss for society. Competition 
and monopoly are extreme forms of market structure. Competition occurs when 
there are many firms in a market offering essentially identical products; monop-
oly occurs when there is only one firm in a market.
Although the cases of perfect competition and monopoly illustrate some 
 important ideas about how markets work, most markets in the economy include 
elements of both these cases and, therefore, are not completely described by either 
of them. The typical firm in the economy faces competition, but the competition 
is not so rigorous that it makes the firm a price taker like the firms analyzed in 
Chapter 14. The typical firm also has some degree of market power, but its mar-
ket power is not so great that the firm can be described exactly by the monopoly 
model presented in Chapter 15. In other words, many industries fall somewhere 
between the polar cases of perfect competition and monopoly. Economists call 
this situation imperfect competition.
One type of imperfectly competitive market is an oligopoly, a market with only 
a few sellers, each offering a product that is similar or identical to the products 
 offered by other sellers in the market. Economists measure a market’s domination 
by a small number of firms with a statistic called the concentration ratio, which is the 
percentage of total output in the market supplied by the four largest firms. In the 
U.S. economy, most industries have a four-firm concentration ratio under 50 per-
cent, but in some industries, the biggest firms play a more dominant role. Highly 
concentrated industries include the market for major household appliances (which 
has a concentration ratio of 90 percent), tires (91 percent), light bulbs (92 percent), 
soda (94 percent), and wireless telecommunications (95 percent). These industries 
are best described as oligopolies. In the next chapter we see that the small number 
of firms in oligopolies makes strategic interactions among them a key part of the 
analysis. That is, in choosing how much to produce and what price to charge, each 
firm in an oligopoly is concerned not only with what its competitors are doing but 
also with how its competitors would react to what it might do.

CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
A second type of imperfectly competitive market is called monopolistic 
competition. This describes a market structure in which there are many firms 
selling products that are similar but not identical. In a monopolistically competi-
tive market, each firm has a monopoly over the product it makes, but many other 
firms make similar products that compete for the same customers.
To be more precise, monopolistic competition describes a market with the fol-
lowing attributes:
• Many sellers: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers.
• Product differentiation: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly 
different from those of other firms. Thus, rather than being a price taker, each 
firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve.
• Free entry and exit: Firms can enter or exit the market without restriction. 
Thus, the number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are 
driven to zero.
A moment’s thought reveals a long list of markets with these attributes: books, 
computer games, restaurants, piano lessons, cookies, clothing, and so on.
Monopolistic competition, like oligopoly, is a market structure that lies 
 between the extreme cases of perfect competition and monopoly. But oligopoly 
and  monopolistic competition are quite different. Oligopoly departs from the per-
fectly competitive ideal of Chapter 14 because there are only a few sellers in the 
market. The small number of sellers makes rigorous competition less likely and 
strategic interactions among them vitally important. By contrast, a monopolisti-
cally competitive market has many sellers, each of which is small compared to the 
market. It departs from the perfectly competitive ideal because each of the sellers 
offers a somewhat different product.
Figure 1 summarizes the four types of market structure. The first question to 
ask about any market is how many firms there are. If there is only one firm, the 
monopolistic competition

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
market is a monopoly. If there are only a few firms, the market is an oligopoly. If 
there are many firms, we need to ask another question: Do the firms sell identical 
or differentiated products? If the many firms sell identical products, the market is 
perfectly competitive. But if the many firms sell differentiated products, the mar-
ket is monopolistically competitive. 
Because reality is never as clear-cut as theory, at times you may find it 
hard to decide what structure best describes a market. There is, for instance, 
no magic number that separates “few” from “many” when counting the 
 number of firms. (Do the approximately dozen companies that now sell cars 
in the United States make this market an oligopoly, or is the market more 
competitive? The answer is open to debate.) Similarly, there is no sure way 
to  determine when products are differentiated and when they are identical. 
(Are different brands of milk really the same? Again, the answer is debatable.) 
When analyzing actual markets, economists have to keep in mind the lessons 
learned from studying all types of market structure and then apply each les-
son as it seems appropriate.
Now that we understand how economists define the various types of market 
structure, we can continue our analysis of each of them. In this chapter we exam-
ine monopolistic competition. In the next chapter we analyze oligopoly.

Define oligopoly and monopolistic competition and give an example of each.
16-2 Competition with Differentiated Products
To understand monopolistically competitive markets, we first consider the 
 decisions facing an individual firm. We then examine what happens in the long 
run as firms enter and exit the industry. Next, we compare the equilibrium 
 under monopolistic competition to the equilibrium under perfect competition 
that we examined in Chapter 14. Finally, we consider whether the outcome in a 
 monopolistically competitive market is desirable from the standpoint of society 
as a whole.
16-2a The Monopolistically Competitive Firm in the Short Run
Each firm in a monopolistically competitive market is, in many ways, like a 
monopoly. Because its product is different from those offered by other firms, it 
faces a downward-sloping demand curve. (By contrast, a perfectly competitive 
firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price.) Thus, the monopo-
listically competitive firm follows a monopolist’s rule for profit maximization: 
It chooses to produce the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost and then uses its demand curve to find the price at which it can sell that 
quantity.
Figure 2 shows the cost, demand, and marginal-revenue curves for two  typical 
firms, each in a different monopolistically competitive industry. In both panels 
of the figure, the profit-maximizing quantity is found at the intersection of the 
 marginal-revenue and marginal-cost curves. The two panels show different out-
comes for the firm’s profit. In panel (a), price exceeds average total cost, so the firm 
makes a profit. In panel (b), price is below average total cost. In this case, the firm 
is unable to make a positive profit, so the best it can do is to minimize its losses.

CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
All this should seem familiar. A monopolistically competitive firm chooses its 
quantity and price just as a monopoly does. In the short run, these two types of 
market structure are similar.
16-2b The Long-Run Equilibrium
The situations depicted in Figure 2 do not last long. When firms are making prof-
its, as in panel (a), new firms have an incentive to enter the market. This entry 
increases the number of products from which customers can choose and, there-
fore, reduces the demand faced by each firm already in the market. In other 
words, profit encourages entry, and entry shifts the demand curves faced by the 
incumbent firms to the left. As the demand for incumbent firms’ products falls, 
these firms experience declining profit. 
Conversely, when firms are making losses, as in panel (b), firms in the mar-
ket have an incentive to exit. As firms exit, customers have fewer products from 
which to choose. This decrease in the number of firms expands the demand faced 
by those firms that stay in the market. In other words, losses encourage exit, and 
exit shifts the demand curves of the remaining firms to the right. As the demand 
for the remaining firms’ products rises, these firms experience rising profits (that 
is, declining losses). 
This process of entry and exit continues until the firms in the market are mak-
ing exactly zero economic profit. Figure 3 depicts the long-run equilibrium. Once 
the market reaches this equilibrium, new firms have no incentive to enter, and 
existing firms have no incentive to exit.

Monopolistic Competitors in the 
Short Run
Monopolistic competitors, like monopolists, maximize profit by producing the quantity 
at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm in panel (a) makes a profit  
because, at this quantity, price is greater than average total cost. The firm in panel (b) 
makes losses because, at this quantity, price is less than average total cost.

A Monopolistic Competitor  
in the Long Run
In a monopolistically competitive 
market, if firms are making prof-
its, new firms enter, causing the 
demand curves for the incumbent 
firms to shift to the left. Similarly, 
if firms are making losses, some 
of the firms in the market exit, 
causing the demand curves of the 
remaining firms to shift to the right. 
Because of these shifts in demand, 
monopolistically competitive firms 
eventually find themselves in the 
long-run equilibrium shown here. 
In this long-run equilibrium, price 
equals average total cost, and each 
firm earns zero profit.
Notice that the demand curve in this figure just barely touches the 
average- total-cost curve. Mathematically, we say the two curves are tangent to 
each other. These two curves must be tangent once entry and exit have driven 
profit to zero. Because profit per unit sold is the difference between price (found 
on the demand curve) and average total cost, the maximum profit is zero only if 
these two curves touch each other without crossing. Also note that this point of 
tangency occurs at the same quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost. That these two points line up is not a coincidence: It is required because this 
particular quantity maximizes profit and the maximum profit is exactly zero in 
the long run.
To sum up, two characteristics describe the long-run equilibrium in a monopo-
listically competitive market:
• As in a monopoly market, price exceeds marginal cost (P . MC). This 
 conclusion arises because profit maximization requires marginal revenue to 
equal marginal cost (MR 5 MC) and because the downward-sloping demand 
curve makes marginal revenue less than the price (MR , P).
• As in a competitive market, price equals average total cost (P 5 ATC). This 
conclusion arises because free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero.
The second characteristic shows how monopolistic competition differs from 
monopoly. Because a monopoly is the sole seller of a product without close sub-
stitutes, it can earn positive economic profit, even in the long run. By  contrast, 
 because there is free entry into a monopolistically competitive market, the 
 economic profit of a firm in this type of market is driven to zero.

CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
equilibrium with perfect competition.) There are two noteworthy differences 
 between monopolistic and perfect competition: excess capacity and the markup. 
Excess Capacity   As we have just seen, the process of entry and exit drives each 
firm in a monopolistically competitive market to a point of tangency  between 
its demand and average-total-cost curves. Panel (a) of Figure 4 shows that the 
quantity of output at this point is smaller than the quantity that  minimizes 
 average total cost. Thus, under monopolistic competition, firms produce on 
the  downward-sloping portion of their average-total-cost curves. In this way, 
 monopolistic competition contrasts starkly with perfect competition. As panel (b) 
of Figure 4 shows, free entry in competitive markets drives firms to produce at the 
minimum of average total cost. 
The quantity that minimizes average total cost is called the efficient scale of the 
firm. In the long run, perfectly competitive firms produce at the efficient scale, 
whereas monopolistically competitive firms produce below this level. Firms are 
said to have excess capacity under monopolistic competition. In other words, a 
monopolistically competitive firm, unlike a perfectly competitive firm, could 
 increase the quantity it produces and lower the average total cost of production. 
The firm forgoes this opportunity because it would need to cut its price to sell the 
additional output. It is more profitable for a monopolistic competitor to continue 
operating with excess capacity.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Markup over Marginal Cost   A second difference between perfect competition 
and monopolistic competition is the relationship between price and marginal cost. 
For a perfectly competitive firm, such as the one shown in panel (b) of  Figure 4, 
price equals marginal cost. For a monopolistically competitive firm, such as the 
one shown in panel (a), price exceeds marginal cost because the firm always has 
some market power. 
How is this markup over marginal cost consistent with free entry and zero 
profit? The zero-profit condition ensures only that price equals average total cost. 
It does not ensure that price equals marginal cost. Indeed, in the long-run equilib-
rium, monopolistically competitive firms operate on the declining portion of their 
average-total-cost curves, so marginal cost is below average total cost. Thus, for 
price to equal average total cost, price must be above marginal cost.
In this relationship between price and marginal cost, we see a key behavioral 
difference between perfect competitors and monopolistic competitors. Imagine 
that you were to ask a firm the following question: “Would you like to see another 
customer come through your door ready to buy from you at your current price?” 
A perfectly competitive firm would answer that it didn’t care. Because price 
exactly equals marginal cost, the profit from an extra unit sold is zero. By con-
trast, a monopolistically competitive firm is always eager to get another customer. 
Because its price exceeds marginal cost, an extra unit sold at the posted price 
means more profit.

market, and panel (b) shows the long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive

CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
According to an old quip, monopolistically competitive markets are those in 
which sellers send Christmas cards to the buyers. Trying to attract more custom-
ers makes sense only if price exceeds marginal cost.
16-2d Monopolistic Competition and the Welfare of Society
Is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive market desirable from the stand-
point of society as a whole? Can policymakers improve on the market outcome? 
In previous chapters we evaluated markets from the standpoint of efficiency 
by asking whether society is getting the most it can out of its scarce resources. 
We learned that competitive markets lead to efficient outcomes, unless there are  
externalities, whereas monopoly markets lead to deadweight losses. Monopolis-
tically competitive markets are more complex than either of these polar cases, so 
evaluating welfare in these markets is a more subtle exercise.
One source of inefficiency in monopolistically competitive markets is the 
markup of price over marginal cost. Because of the markup, some consumers who 
value the good at more than the marginal cost of production (but less than the 
price) will be deterred from buying it. Thus, a monopolistically competitive mar-
ket has the normal deadweight loss of monopoly pricing.
This outcome is undesirable compared with the efficient quantity that arises 
when price equals marginal cost, but policymakers don’t have an easy way to fix 
the problem. To enforce marginal-cost pricing, they would need to regulate all firms 
that produce differentiated products. Because such products are so common in the 
economy, the administrative burden of such regulation would be overwhelming.
Moreover, regulating monopolistic competitors entails all the problems of reg-
ulating natural monopolies. In particular, because monopolistic competitors are 
making zero profits already, requiring them to lower their prices to equal mar-
ginal cost would cause them to make losses. To keep these firms in business, the 
government would need to help them cover these losses. Rather than raise taxes 
to pay for these subsidies, policymakers often decide it is better to live with the 
inefficiency of monopolistic pricing. 
Another source of inefficiency under monopolistic competition is that the num-
ber of firms in the market may not be “ideal.” That is, there may be too much or 
too little entry. One way to think about this problem is in terms of the externalities 
associated with entry. Whenever a new firm considers entering the market with 
a new product, it takes into account only the profit it would make. Yet its entry 
would also have the following two effects that are external to the firm:
• The product-variety externality: Because consumers get some consumer surplus 
from the introduction of a new product, the entry of a new firm conveys a 
positive externality on consumers. 
• The business-stealing externality: Because other firms lose customers and 
 profits when faced with a new competitor, the entry of a new firm imposes a 
negative externality on existing firms.
Thus, in a monopolistically competitive market, the entry of new firms entails both 
positive and negative externalities. Depending on which externality is larger, a 
 monopolistically competitive market could have either too few or too many products.
Both of these externalities are closely related to the conditions for monopolis-
tic competition. The product-variety externality arises because new firms offer 
products that differ from those of the existing firms. The business-stealing exter-
nality arises because firms post a price above marginal cost and, therefore, are

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
always eager to sell additional units. Conversely, because perfectly competitive 
firms produce identical goods and charge a price equal to marginal cost, neither 
of these externalities exists under perfect competition.
In the end, we can conclude only that monopolistically competitive markets do 
not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfectly competitive markets. That 
is, the invisible hand does not ensure that total surplus is maximized under monop-
olistic competition. Yet because the inefficiencies are subtle, hard to measure, and 
hard to fix, there is no easy way for public policy to improve the market outcome.

16-3 Advertising
It is nearly impossible to go through a typical day in a modern economy without 
being bombarded with advertising. Whether you are surfing the Internet, posting 
on Facebook, reading a magazine, watching television, or driving down the high-
way, some firm will try to convince you to buy its product. Such behavior is a nat-
ural feature of monopolistic competition (as well as some oligopolistic industries). 
When firms sell differentiated products and charge prices above marginal cost, each 
firm has an incentive to advertise to attract more buyers to its particular product.
The amount of advertising varies substantially across products. Firms that sell 
highly differentiated consumer goods, such as over-the-counter drugs, perfumes, 
soft drinks, razor blades, breakfast cereals, and dog food, typically spend between 
10 and 20 percent of their revenue on advertising. Firms that sell industrial prod-
ucts, such as drill presses and communications satellites, typically spend very lit-
tle on advertising. And firms that sell homogeneous products, such as wheat, salt, 
sugar, and crude oil, spend nothing at all. 
For the economy as a whole, about 2 percent of total firm revenue is spent on  
advertising. This spending takes many forms, including ads on web sites, social  media, 
television, radio, and billboards and in newspapers, magazines, and direct mail.
16-3a The Debate over Advertising
Is society wasting the resources it devotes to advertising? Or does advertising serve a 
valuable purpose? Assessing the social value of advertising is difficult and often gener-
ates heated argument among economists. Let’s consider both sides of the debate.
The Critique of Advertising  Critics of advertising argue that firms advertise to 
manipulate people’s tastes. Much advertising is psychological rather than informa-
tional. Consider, for example, the typical television commercial for some brand of 
soft drink. The commercial most likely does not tell the viewer about the product’s 
price or quality. Instead, it might show a group of happy people at a party on a 
beach on a beautiful sunny day. In their hands are cans of the soft drink. The goal 
of the commercial is to convey a subconscious (if not subtle) message: “You too can 
have many friends and be happy, if you drink our product.” Critics of advertising 
argue that such a commercial creates a desire that otherwise might not exist. 
Critics also argue that advertising impedes competition. Advertising often tries 
to convince consumers that products are more different than they truly are. By 
increasing the perception of product differentiation and fostering brand loyalty, 
advertising makes buyers less concerned with price differences among similar

329
CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
goods, thereby making the demand for a particular brand less elastic. When a 
firm faces a less elastic demand curve, it can increase its profits by charging a 
larger markup over marginal cost.
The Defense of Advertising  Defenders of advertising argue that firms use adver-
tising to provide information to customers. Advertising conveys the prices of the 
goods offered for sale, the existence of new products, and the locations of retail 
outlets. This information allows customers to make better choices about what to 
buy and, thus, enhances the ability of markets to allocate resources efficiently.
Defenders also argue that advertising fosters competition. Because advertising 
allows customers to be more fully informed about all the firms in the market, cus-
tomers can more easily take advantage of price differences. Thus, each firm has 
less market power. In addition, advertising allows new firms to enter more easily 
because it gives entrants a means to attract customers from existing firms.
Over time, policymakers have come to accept the view that advertising can 
make markets more competitive. One important example is the regulation of 
 advertising for certain professions, such as lawyers, doctors, and pharmacists. In 
the past, these groups succeeded in getting state governments to prohibit advertis-
ing in their fields on the grounds that advertising was “unprofessional.” In recent 
years, however, the courts have concluded that the primary effect of these restric-
tions on advertising was to curtail competition. They have, therefore, overturned 
many of the laws that prohibit advertising by members of these professions. 
ADVERTISING AND THE PRICE OF EYEGLASSES
What effect does advertising have on the price of a good? On the one 
hand, advertising might make consumers view products as being 
more different than they otherwise would. If so, it would make mar-
kets less competitive and firms’ demand curves less elastic, and this 
would lead firms to charge higher prices. On the other hand, advertising might 
make it easier for consumers to find the firms offering the best prices. In this case, 
it would make markets more competitive and firms’ demand curves more elastic, 
which would lead to lower prices.
In an article published in The Journal of Law and Economics in 1972, economist 
Lee Benham tested these two views of advertising. In the United States during the 
1960s, the various state governments had vastly different rules about advertising by 
optometrists. Some states allowed advertising for eyeglasses and eye examinations. 
Many states, however, prohibited it. For example, the Florida law read as follows:
It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to . . . advertise either 
 directly or indirectly by any means whatsoever any definite or indefinite price 
or credit terms on prescriptive or corrective lens, frames, complete prescrip-
tive or corrective glasses, or any optometric service. . . . This section is passed 
in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare, and its provisions shall be 
liberally construed to carry out its objects and purposes.
Professional optometrists enthusiastically endorsed these restrictions on advertising.
Benham used the differences in state law as a natural experiment to test the 
two views of advertising. The results were striking. In those states that prohibited 
 advertising, the average price paid for a pair of eyeglasses was $33, or $256 in 2015 
dollars. In states that did not restrict advertising, the average price was $26, or $202 
in 2015 dollars. Thus, advertising reduced average prices by more than 20 percent. 
In the market for eyeglasses, and probably in many other markets as well, advertis-
ing fosters competition and leads to lower prices for consumers. ●

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
16-3b Advertising as a Signal of Quality
Many types of advertising contain little apparent information about the product 
being advertised. Consider a firm introducing a new breakfast cereal. The firm 
might saturate the airwaves with advertisements showing some actor eating the 
cereal and exclaiming how wonderful it tastes. How much information does the 
advertisement really provide?
The answer is more than you might think. Defenders of advertising argue that 
even advertising that appears to contain little hard information may in fact tell 
consumers something about product quality. The willingness of the firm to spend 
a large amount of money on advertising can itself be a signal to consumers about 
the quality of the product being offered.
Consider the problem facing two firms—General Mills and Kellogg. Each com-
pany has just come up with a recipe for a new cereal, which it would sell for $3 a 
box. To keep things simple, let’s assume that the marginal cost of making cereal is 
zero, so the $3 is all profit. Each company knows that if it spends $10 million on 
advertising, it will get 1 million consumers to try its new cereal. And each company 
knows that if consumers like the cereal, they will buy it not once but many times. 
First consider General Mills’ decision. Based on market research, General Mills 
knows that its cereal tastes like shredded newspaper with sugar on top. Advertis-
ing would sell one box to each of the 1 million consumers, but consumers would 
quickly learn that the cereal is not very good and stop buying it. General Mills 
 decides it is not worth spending $10 million on advertising to get only $3  million 
in sales. So it does not bother to advertise. It sends its cooks back to the test kitchen 
to come up with a better recipe. 
Kellogg, on the other hand, knows that its cereal is great. Each person who tries 
it will buy a box a month for the next year. Thus, the $10 million in advertising 
will bring in $36 million in sales. Advertising is profitable here because Kellogg 
has a good product that consumers will buy repeatedly. Thus, Kellogg chooses to 
advertise.
Now that we have considered the behavior of the two firms, let’s consider the 
behavior of consumers. We began by asserting that consumers are inclined to try 
a new cereal that they see advertised. But is this behavior rational? Should a con-
sumer try a new cereal just because the seller has chosen to advertise it?
In fact, it may be completely rational for consumers to try new products that 
they see advertised. In our story, consumers decide to try Kellogg’s new cereal 
because Kellogg advertises. Kellogg chooses to advertise because it knows that 
its cereal is quite good, while General Mills chooses not to advertise because it 
knows that its cereal is not good at all. By its willingness to spend money on 
 advertising, Kellogg signals to consumers the quality of its cereal. Each consumer 
thinks, quite sensibly, “Boy, if the Kellogg Company is willing to spend so much 
money  advertising this new cereal, it must be really good.” 
What is most surprising about this theory of advertising is that the content 
of the advertisement is irrelevant. Kellogg signals the quality of its product by 
its willingness to spend money on advertising. What the advertisements say is 
not as important as the fact that consumers know ads are expensive. By contrast, 
cheap advertising cannot be effective at signaling quality to consumers. In our 
 example, if an advertising campaign cost less than $3 million, both General Mills 
and  Kellogg would use it to market their new cereals. Because both good and bad 
cereals would be advertised, consumers could not infer the quality of a new cereal 
from the fact that it is advertised. Over time, consumers would learn to ignore 
such cheap advertising.

331
CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
This theory can explain why firms pay famous actors large amounts of money 
to make advertisements that, on the surface, appear to convey no information at 
all. The information is not in the advertisement’s content but simply in its exis-
tence and expense.
16-3c Brand Names
Advertising is closely related to the existence of brand names. In many markets, 
there are two types of firms. Some firms sell products with widely recognized 
brand names, while other firms sell generic substitutes. For example, in a typical 
drugstore, you can find Bayer aspirin on the shelf next to generic aspirin. In a 
typical grocery store, you can find Pepsi next to less familiar colas. Most often, the 
firm with the brand name spends more on advertising and charges a higher price 
for its product. 
Just as there is disagreement about the economics of advertising, there is dis-
agreement about the economics of brand names. Let’s consider both sides of the 
debate.
Critics argue that brand names cause consumers to perceive differences that do 
not really exist. In many cases, the generic good is almost indistinguishable from the 
brand-name good. Consumers’ willingness to pay more for the brand-name good, 
these critics assert, is a form of irrationality fostered by advertising.  Economist 
 Edward Chamberlin, one of the early developers of the theory of  monopolistic 
 competition, concluded from this argument that brand names were bad for the 
economy. He proposed that the government discourage their use by refusing to 
 enforce the exclusive trademarks that companies use to identify their products.
More recently, economists have defended brand names as a useful way for 
consumers to ensure that the goods they buy are of high quality. There are two 
 related arguments. First, brand names provide consumers with information about 
quality when quality cannot be easily judged in advance of purchase. Second, 
brand names give firms an incentive to maintain high quality because firms have a 
financial stake in maintaining the reputation of their brand names.
To see how these arguments work in practice, consider a famous brand name: 
McDonald’s. Imagine that you are driving through an unfamiliar town and want 
to stop for lunch. You see a McDonald’s and a local restaurant next to it. Which 
do you choose? The local restaurant may offer better food at lower prices, but you 
have no way of knowing that. By contrast, McDonald’s offers a consistent product 
across many cities. Its brand name is useful to you as a way of judging the quality 
of what you are about to buy.
Is it rational for  consumers 
to be impressed that 
 Jennifer Aniston is 
 endorsing this product?

332
PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
The McDonald’s brand name also ensures that the company has an incentive to 
maintain quality. For example, if some customers were to become ill from spoiled 
food sold at a McDonald’s, the news would be disastrous for the company. 
McDonald’s would lose much of the valuable reputation that it has built up with 
years of expensive advertising. As a result, it would lose sales and profit not only 
in the outlet that sold the bad food but also in many other McDonald’s outlets 
throughout the country. By contrast, if some customers were to become ill from 
bad food at a local restaurant, that restaurant might have to close down, but the 
lost profits would be much smaller. Hence, McDonald’s has a greater incentive to 
ensure that its food is safe.
The debate over brand names thus centers on the question of whether consum-
ers are rational in preferring brand names to generic substitutes. Critics argue 
that brand names are the result of an irrational consumer response to advertising. 
Defenders argue that consumers have good reason to pay more for brand-name 
products because they can be more confident in the quality of these products.

16-4 Conclusion
Monopolistic competition is true to its name: It is a hybrid of monopoly and compe-
tition. Like a monopoly, each monopolistic competitor faces a downward-sloping 
demand curve and, as a result, charges a price above marginal cost. As in a perfectly 
competitive market, there are many firms, and entry and exit drive the profit of each 
monopolistic competitor toward zero in the long run. Table 1 summarizes these lessons.

CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
Because monopolistically competitive firms produce differentiated  products, 
each firm advertises to attract customers to its own brand. To some extent, 
 advertising manipulates consumers’ tastes, promotes irrational brand loyalty, and 
impedes competition. To a larger extent, advertising provides information, estab-
lishes brand names of reliable quality, and fosters competition. 
The theory of monopolistic competition seems to describe many markets in the 
economy. It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that the theory does not yield 
simple and compelling advice for public policy. From the standpoint of the eco-
nomic theorist, the allocation of resources in monopolistically competitive mar-
kets is not perfect. Yet from the standpoint of a practical policymaker, there may 
be little that can be done to improve it.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
SUMMARY
• A monopolistically competitive market is character-
ized by three attributes: many firms, differentiated 
products, and free entry and exit.
• The long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically com-
petitive market differs from that in a perfectly com-
petitive market in two related ways. First, each firm 
in a monopolistically competitive market has excess 
 capacity. That is, it chooses a quantity that puts it 
on the downward-sloping portion of the average-  
total-cost curve. Second, each firm charges a price 
above marginal cost.
• Monopolistic competition does not have all the 
 desirable properties of perfect competition. There is 
the standard deadweight loss of monopoly caused 
by the markup of price over marginal cost. In addition, 
the number of firms (and thus the variety of products) 
can be too large or too small. In practice, the ability of 
policymakers to correct these inefficiencies is limited.
• The product differentiation inherent in monopolistic 
competition leads to the use of advertising and brand 
names. Critics of advertising and brand names argue 
that firms use them to manipulate consumers’ tastes 
and to reduce competition. Defenders of advertising 
and brand names argue that firms use them to inform 
consumers and to compete more vigorously on price 
and product quality.

CHAPTER 16   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
6. Sparkle is one of the many firms in the market for 
toothpaste, which is in long-run equilibrium.
a. Draw a diagram showing Sparkle’s demand 
curve, marginal-revenue curve, average-total-cost 
curve, and marginal-cost curve. Label Sparkle’s 
profit-maximizing output and price.
b. What is Sparkle’s profit? Explain.
c. On your diagram, show the consumer surplus 
derived from the purchase of Sparkle toothpaste. 
Also show the deadweight loss relative to the 
 efficient level of output.
d. If the government forced Sparkle to produce the 
efficient level of output, what would happen 
to the firm? What would happen to Sparkle’s 
customers?
7. Consider a monopolistically competitive market with 
N firms. Each firm’s business opportunities are  
described by the following equations:
Demand: Q 5 100/N 2 P
Marginal Revenue: MR 5 100/N 2 2Q
 
Total Cost: TC 5 50 1 Q2
 
Marginal Cost: MC 5 2Q
a. How does N, the number of firms in the market, 
affect each firm’s demand curve? Why?
b. How many units does each firm produce? 
(The answers to this and the next two  
questions depend on N.)
c. What price does each firm charge?
d. How much profit does each firm make?
e. In the long run, how many firms will exist in this 
market?
8. The market for peanut butter in Nutville is monop-
olistically competitive and in long-run equilibrium. 
One day, consumer advocate Skippy Jif discovers that 
all brands of peanut butter in Nutville are identical. 
Thereafter, the market becomes perfectly competitive 
and again reaches its long-run equilibrium. Using 
an appropriate diagram, explain whether each of the 
following variables increases, decreases, or stays the 
same for a typical firm in the market.
a. price
b. quantity
c. average total cost
d. marginal cost
e. profit
9. For each of the following pairs of firms, explain which 
firm would be more likely to engage in advertising.
a. a family-owned farm or a family-owned 
restaurant
b. a manufacturer of forklifts or a manufacturer of cars
c. a company that invented a very comfortable razor 
or a company that invented a less comfortable razor
10. Sleek Sneakers Co. is one of many firms in the market 
for shoes.
a. Assume that Sleek is currently earning short-run 
economic profit. On a correctly labeled diagram, 
show Sleek’s profit-maximizing output and price, 
as well as the area representing profit.
b. What happens to Sleek’s price, output, and profit 
in the long run? Explain this change in words, and 
show it on a new diagram.
c. Suppose that over time consumers become more 
focused on stylistic differences among shoe 
brands. How would this change in attitudes affect 
each firm’s price elasticity of demand? In the long 
run, how will this change in demand affect Sleek’s 
price, output, and profit? 
d. At the profit-maximizing price you identified 
in part (c), is Sleek’s demand curve elastic or 
 inelastic? Explain.

I
f you play tennis, you have probably used balls from one of four producers: 
Penn, Wilson, Prince, or Dunlop Slazenger (two brands from the same com-
pany). These four firms make almost all the tennis balls sold in the United 
States. Together they determine the quantity of tennis balls produced and, given 
the market demand curve, the price at which tennis balls are sold.
The market for tennis balls is an example of an oligopoly. The essence of an 
oligopolistic market is that there are only a few sellers. As a result, the actions of 
any one seller in the market can have a large impact on the profits of all the other 
sellers. Oligopolistic firms are interdependent in a way that competitive firms 
are not. Our goal in this chapter is to see how this interdependence 
shapes the firms’ behavior and what problems it raises 
for  public policy.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
The analysis of oligopoly offers an opportunity to introduce game theory, the 
study of how people behave in strategic situations. By “strategic” we mean a situ-
ation in which a person, when choosing among alternative courses of action, must 
consider how others might respond to the action she takes. Strategic thinking is 
crucial not only in checkers, chess, and tic-tac-toe but also in many business deci-
sions. Because oligopolistic markets have only a small number of firms, each firm 
must act strategically. Each firm knows that its profit depends on both how much 
it produces and how much the other firms produce. In making its production de-
cision, each firm in an oligopoly should consider how its decision might affect the 
production decisions of the other firms in the market.
Game theory is not necessary for understanding competitive or monopoly mar-
kets. In a market that is either perfectly competitive or monopolistically competi-
tive, each firm is so small compared to the market that strategic interactions with 
other firms are not important. In a monopolized market, strategic interactions are 
absent because the market has only one firm. But, as we will see, game theory is 
useful for understanding oligopolies and many other situations in which a small 
number of players interact with one another. Game theory helps explain the strat-
egies that people choose, whether they are playing tennis or selling tennis balls.

in strategic situations
17-1 Markets with Only a Few Sellers
Because an oligopolistic market has only a small group of sellers, a key feature of 
oligopoly is the tension between cooperation and self-interest. The oligopolists 
are best off when they cooperate and act like a monopolist—producing a small 
quantity of output and charging a price above marginal cost. Yet because each oli-
gopolist cares only about its own profit, there are powerful incentives at work that 
hinder a group of firms from maintaining the cooperative outcome. 
17-1a A Duopoly Example
To understand the behavior of oligopolies, let’s consider an oligopoly with only 
two members, called a duopoly. Duopoly is the simplest type of oligopoly. Oligop-
olies with three or more members face the same problems as duopolies, so we do 
not lose much by starting with the simpler case.
Imagine a town in which only two residents, Jack and Jill, own wells that pro-
duce water safe for drinking. Each Saturday, Jack and Jill decide how many gal-
lons of water to pump, bring the water to town, and sell it for whatever price the 
market will bear. To keep things simple, suppose that Jack and Jill can pump as 
much water as they want without cost. That is, the marginal cost of water equals 
zero.
Table 1 shows the town’s demand schedule for water. The first column shows 
the total quantity demanded, and the second column shows the price. If the two 
well owners sell a total of 10 gallons of water, water goes for $110 a gallon. If they 
sell a total of 20 gallons, the price falls to $100 a gallon. And so on. If you graphed 
these two columns of numbers, you would get a standard downward-sloping 
 demand curve.
The last column in Table 1 shows total revenue from the sale of water. It equals 
the quantity sold times the price. Because there is no cost to pumping water, the 
total revenue of the two producers equals their total profit.
Let’s now consider how the organization of the town’s water industry affects 
the price of water and the quantity sold.

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
17-1b Competition, Monopolies, and Cartels
Before considering the price and quantity of water that results from the duopoly 
of Jack and Jill, let’s discuss briefly what the outcome would be if the water mar-
ket were either perfectly competitive or monopolistic. These two polar cases are 
natural benchmarks. 
If the market for water were perfectly competitive, the production decisions 
of each firm would drive price to equal marginal cost. Because we have assumed 
that the marginal cost of pumping additional water is zero, the equilibrium price 
of water under perfect competition would be zero as well. The equilibrium quan-
tity would be 120 gallons. The price of water would reflect the cost of producing 
it, and the efficient quantity of water would be produced and consumed.
Now consider how a monopoly would behave. Table 1 shows that total profit 
is maximized at a quantity of 60 gallons and a price of $60 a gallon. A profit-
maximizing monopolist, therefore, would produce this quantity and charge this 
price. As is standard for monopolies, price would exceed marginal cost. The  result 
would be inefficient, because the quantity of water produced and consumed 
would fall short of the socially efficient level of 120 gallons.
What outcome should we expect from our duopolists? One possibility is that 
Jack and Jill get together and agree on the quantity of water to produce and the 
price to charge for it. Such an agreement among firms over production and price 
is called collusion, and the group of firms acting in unison is called a cartel. Once 
a cartel is formed, the market is in effect served by a monopoly and we can apply 
our analysis from Chapter 15. That is, if Jack and Jill collude, they will agree on 
the monopoly outcome because that outcome maximizes their total profit. Our 
two producers produce a total of 60 gallons, which sell at a price of $60 a gallon. 
Once again, price exceeds marginal cost, and the outcome is socially inefficient.
A cartel must agree not only on the total level of production but also on the 
amount produced by each member. In our case, Jack and Jill must agree on how to

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
split the monopoly production of 60 gallons. Each member of the cartel will want 
a larger share of the market because a larger market share means larger profit. If 
Jack and Jill agree to split the market equally, each produces 30 gallons, the price 
is $60 a gallon, and each earns a profit of $1,800.
17-1c The Equilibrium for an Oligopoly
Oligopolists would like to form cartels and earn monopoly profits, but that is 
 often impossible. Squabbling among cartel members over how to divide the profit 
in the market can make agreement among members difficult. In addition, anti-
trust laws prohibit explicit agreements among oligopolists as a matter of public 
policy. Even talking about pricing and production restrictions with competitors 
can be a criminal offense. Let’s therefore consider what happens if Jack and Jill 
decide separately how much water to produce.
At first, one might expect Jack and Jill to reach the monopoly outcome on their 
own, because this outcome maximizes their joint profit. In the absence of a bind-
ing agreement, however, the monopoly outcome is unlikely. To see why, imagine 
that Jack expects Jill to produce only 30 gallons (half of the monopoly quantity). 
Jack would reason as follows:
“I could produce 30 gallons as well. In this case, a total of 60 gallons of water 
would be sold at a price of $60 a gallon. My profit would be $1,800 (30 gallons 3  
$60 a gallon). Alternatively, I could produce 40 gallons. In this case, a total of 
70 gallons of water would be sold at a price of $50 a gallon. My profit would be 
$2,000 (40 gallons 3 $50 a gallon). Even though total profit in the market would fall, 
my profit would be higher, because I would have a larger share of the market.”
Of course, Jill might reason the same way. If so, Jack and Jill would each bring 
40 gallons to town. Total sales would be 80 gallons, and the price would fall to $40. 
Thus, if the duopolists individually pursue their own self-interest when deciding 
how much to produce, they produce a total quantity greater than the monopoly 
quantity, charge a price lower than the monopoly price, and earn total profit less 
than the monopoly profit.
Although the logic of self-interest increases the duopoly’s output above the 
monopoly level, it does not push the duopolists all the way to the competitive 
allocation. Consider what happens when each duopolist produces 40 gallons. The 
price is $40, and each duopolist makes a profit of $1,600. In this case, Jack’s self- 
interested logic leads to a different conclusion:
“Right now, my profit is $1,600. Suppose I increase my production to 50 gal-
lons. In this case, a total of 90 gallons of water would be sold, and the price would 
be $30 a gallon. Then my profit would be only $1,500. Rather than increasing pro-
duction and driving down the price, I am better off keeping my production at 
40 gallons.”
The outcome in which Jack and Jill each produce 40 gallons looks like some sort 
of equilibrium. In fact, this outcome is called a Nash equilibrium. (It is named af-
ter Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and economic theorist John Nash, whose 
life was portrayed in the book and movie A Beautiful Mind.) A Nash equilibrium
is a situation in which economic actors interacting with one another each choose 
their best strategy given the strategies that the others have chosen. In this case, 
given that Jill is producing 40 gallons, the best strategy for Jack is also to produce 
40 gallons. Similarly, given that Jack is producing 40 gallons, the best strategy for 
Jill is also to produce 40 gallons. Once they reach this Nash equilibrium, neither 
Jack nor Jill has an incentive to make a different decision.

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
This example illustrates the tension between cooperation and 
self-interest. Oligopolists would be better off cooperating and 
reaching the monopoly outcome. Yet because they each pursue 
their own self-interest, they do not end up reaching the monop-
oly outcome and, thus, fail to maximize their joint profit. Each 
oligopolist is tempted to raise production and capture a larger 
share of the market. As each of them tries to do this, total pro-
duction rises, and the price falls. 
At the same time, self-interest does not drive the market all 
the way to the competitive outcome. Like monopolists, oligopo-
lists are aware that increasing the amount they produce reduces 
the price of their product, which in turn affects profits. There-
fore, they stop short of following the competitive firm’s rule of 
producing up to the point where price equals marginal cost.
In summary, when firms in an oligopoly individually choose pro-
duction to maximize profit, they produce a quantity of output greater 
than the level produced by monopoly and less than the level produced 
by perfect competition. The oligopoly price is less than the monopoly 
price but greater than the competitive price (which equals marginal 
cost).
17-1d  How the Size of an Oligopoly Affects  
the Market Outcome 
We can use the insights from this analysis of duopoly to discuss 
how the size of an oligopoly is likely to affect the outcome in 
a market. Suppose, for instance, that John and Joan suddenly 
discover water sources on their property and join Jack and Jill in 
the water oligopoly. The demand schedule in Table 1 remains the same, but now 
more producers are available to satisfy this demand. How would an increase in 
the number of sellers from two to four affect the price and quantity of water in the 
town?
If the sellers of water could form a cartel, they would once again try to maxi-
mize total profit by producing the monopoly quantity and charging the monopoly 
price. Just as when there were only two sellers, the members of the cartel would 
need to agree on production levels for each member and find some way to enforce 
the agreement. As the cartel grows larger, however, this outcome is less likely. 
Reaching and enforcing an agreement becomes more difficult as the size of the 
group increases. 
If the oligopolists do not form a cartel—perhaps because the antitrust laws 
prohibit it—they must each decide on their own how much water to produce. To 
see how the increase in the number of sellers affects the outcome, consider the 
decision facing each seller. At any time, each well owner has the option to raise 
production by one gallon. In making this decision, the well owner weighs the fol-
lowing two effects:
•
The output effect: Because price is above marginal cost, selling one more gallon 
of water at the going price will raise profit.
•
The price effect: Raising production will increase the total amount sold, which 
will lower the price of water and lower the profit on all the other gallons 
sold.
“Behavior in many complex and seemingly intractable strategic 
settings can be understood more clearly by working out what 
each party in the game will choose to do if they realize that the 
other parties will be solving the same problem. This insight has 
helped us understand behavior as diverse as military conflicts, 
price setting by competing firms and penalty kicking in soccer.”

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
If the output effect is larger than the price effect, the well owner will increase pro-
duction. If the price effect is larger than the output effect, the owner will not raise 
production. (In fact, in this case, it is profitable to reduce production.) Each oli-
gopolist continues to increase production until these two marginal effects exactly 
balance, taking the other firms’ production as given.
Now consider how the number of firms in the industry affects the marginal 
analysis of each oligopolist. The larger the number of sellers, the less each seller 
is concerned about her own impact on the market price. That is, as the oligopoly 
grows in size, the magnitude of the price effect falls. When the oligopoly grows 
very large, the price effect disappears altogether. In this extreme case, the produc-
tion decision of an individual firm no longer affects the market price. Each firm 
takes the market price as given when deciding how much to produce and, there-
fore increases production as long as price is above marginal cost. 
We can now see that a large oligopoly is essentially a group of competitive 
firms. A competitive firm considers only the output effect when deciding how 
much to produce: Because a competitive firm is a price taker, the price effect is 
 absent. Thus, as the number of sellers in an oligopoly grows larger, an oligopolistic 
 market looks more and more like a competitive market. The price approaches marginal cost, 
and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient level.
This analysis of oligopoly offers a new perspective on the effects of interna-
tional trade. Imagine that Toyota and Honda are the only automakers in  Japan, 
Volkswagen and BMW are the only automakers in Germany, and Ford and 
 General Motors are the only automakers in the United States. If these nations pro-
hibited international trade in autos, each would have an auto oligopoly with only 
two members, and the market outcome would likely depart substantially from 
the competitive ideal. With international trade, however, the car market is a world 
market, and the oligopoly in this example has six members. Allowing free trade 
increases the number of producers from which each consumer can choose, and 
this increased competition keeps prices closer to marginal cost. Thus, the theory 
of oligopoly provides another reason, in addition to the theory of comparative 
 advantage discussed in Chapter 3, why countries can benefit from free trade.
QuickQuiz
If the members of an oligopoly could agree on a total quantity to produce, 
what quantity would they choose? • If the oligopolists do not act together 
but instead make production decisions individually, do they produce a total quantity more or 
less than in your answer to the previous question? Why?
17-2 The Economics of Cooperation
As we have seen, oligopolies would like to reach the monopoly outcome.  Doing 
so, however, requires cooperation, which at times is difficult to establish and 
maintain. In this section we look more closely at the problems that arise when 
cooperation among actors is desirable but difficult. To analyze the economics of 
cooperation, we need to learn a little about game theory.
In particular, we focus on a “game” called the prisoners’ dilemma, which pro-
vides insight into why cooperation is difficult. Many times in life, people fail to 
cooperate with one another even when cooperation would make them all better 
off. An oligopoly is just one example. The story of the prisoners’ dilemma con-
tains a general lesson that applies to any group trying to maintain cooperation 
among its members.

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
17-2a The Prisoners’ Dilemma 
The prisoners’ dilemma is a story about two criminals who have been captured by 
the police. Let’s call them Bonnie and Clyde. The police have enough evidence to 
convict Bonnie and Clyde of the minor crime of carrying an unregistered gun, so 
that each would spend a year in jail. The police also suspect that the two criminals 
have committed a bank robbery together, but they lack hard evidence to convict 
them of this major crime. The police question Bonnie and Clyde in separate rooms 
and offer each of them the following deal:
“Right now, we can lock you up for 1 year. If you confess to the bank robbery 
and implicate your partner, however, we’ll give you immunity and you can go 
free. Your partner will get 20 years in jail. But if you both confess to the crime, we 
won’t need your testimony and we can avoid the cost of a trial, so you will each 
get an intermediate sentence of 8 years.”
If Bonnie and Clyde, heartless bank robbers that they are, care only about their 
own individual sentences, what would you expect them to do? Figure 1 shows 
their choices. Each prisoner has two strategies: confess or remain silent. The sen-
tence each prisoner gets depends on the strategy he or she chooses and the strat-
egy chosen by his or her partner in crime. 
Consider first Bonnie’s decision. She reasons as follows: “I don’t know what 
Clyde is going to do. If he remains silent, my best strategy is to confess, because 
then I’ll go free rather than spending a year in jail. If he confesses, my best strat-
egy is still to confess, because then I’ll spend 8 years in jail rather than 20. So, 
regardless of what Clyde does, I am better off confessing.”
In the language of game theory, a strategy is called a dominant strategy if 
it is the best strategy for a player to follow regardless of the strategies pursued 
by other players. In this case, confessing is a dominant strategy for Bonnie. She 
spends less time in jail if she confesses, regardless of whether Clyde confesses or 
remains silent.
Now consider Clyde’s decision. He faces the same choices as Bonnie, and he 
reasons in much the same way. Regardless of what Bonnie does, Clyde can reduce 
his jail time by confessing. In other words, confessing is also a dominant strategy 
for Clyde.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
In the end, both Bonnie and Clyde confess, and both spend 8 years in jail. This 
outcome is a Nash equilibrium: Each criminal is choosing the best strategy avail-
able, given the strategy the other is following. Yet, from their standpoint, the out-
come is terrible. If they had both remained silent, both of them would have been 
better off, spending only 1 year in jail on the gun charge. Because each pursues his 
or her own interests, the two prisoners together reach an outcome that is worse 
for each of them.
You might have thought that Bonnie and Clyde would have foreseen this sit-
uation and planned ahead. But even with advanced planning, they would still 
run into problems. Imagine that, before the police captured Bonnie and Clyde, 
the two criminals had made a pact not to confess. Clearly, this agreement would 
make them both better off if they both lived up to it, because they would each 
spend only 1 year in jail. But would the two criminals in fact remain silent, sim-
ply because they had agreed to? Once they are being questioned separately, the 
logic of self-interest takes over and leads them to confess. Cooperation between 
the two prisoners is difficult to maintain, because cooperation is individually 
irrational.
17-2b Oligopolies as a Prisoners’ Dilemma
What does the prisoners’ dilemma have to do with markets and imperfect compe-
tition? It turns out that the game oligopolists play in trying to reach the monop-
oly outcome is similar to the game that the two prisoners play in the prisoners’ 
dilemma.
Consider again the choices facing Jack and Jill. After prolonged negotiation, 
the two suppliers of water agree to keep production at 30 gallons so that the price 
will be kept high and together they will earn the maximum profit. After they 
agree on production levels, however, each of them must decide whether to coop-
erate and live up to this agreement or to ignore it and produce at a higher level. 
Figure 2 shows how the profits of the two producers depend on the strategies 
they choose.
Suppose you are Jack. You might reason as follows: “I could keep production 
at 30 gallons as we agreed, or I could raise my production and sell 40 gallons. If 
Jill lives up to the agreement and keeps her production at 30 gallons, then I earn

chooses to sell.

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
a profit of $2,000 by selling 40 gallons and $1,800 by selling 30 gallons. In this 
case, I am better off with the higher-level production. If Jill fails to live up to the 
agreement and produces 40 gallons, then I earn $1,600 by selling 40 gallons and 
$1,500 by selling 30 gallons. Once again, I am better off with higher production. 
So, regardless of what Jill chooses to do, I am better off reneging on our agreement 
and producing at the higher level.”
Producing 40 gallons is a dominant strategy for Jack. Of course, Jill reasons in 
exactly the same way, and so both produce at the higher level of 40 gallons. The 
result is the inferior outcome (from Jack and Jill’s standpoint) with low profits for 
each of the two producers.
This example illustrates why oligopolies have trouble maintaining monop-
oly profits. The monopoly outcome is jointly rational, but each oligopolist has 
an  incentive to cheat. Just as self-interest drives the prisoners in the prisoners’ 
 dilemma to confess, self-interest makes it difficult for the oligopolists to maintain 
the cooperative outcome with low production, high prices, and monopoly profits.
OPEC AND THE WORLD OIL MARKET
Our story about the town’s market for water is fictional, but if we 
change water to crude oil, and Jack and Jill to Iran and Iraq, the 
story is close to being true. Much of the world’s oil is produced by 
a few countries, mostly in the Middle East. These countries together make up an 
 oligopoly. Their decisions about how much oil to pump are much the same as Jack 
and Jill’s decisions about how much water to pump.
The countries that produce most of the world’s oil have formed a cartel, called 
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As originally 
formed in 1960, OPEC included Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. 
By 1973, eight other nations had joined: Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab 
Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador, and Gabon. These countries control about 
three-fourths of the world’s oil reserves. Like any cartel, OPEC tries to raise the 
price of its product through a coordinated reduction in quantity produced. OPEC 
tries to set production levels for each of the member countries.
The problem that OPEC faces is much the same as the problem that Jack and Jill 
face in our story. The OPEC countries would like to maintain a high price for oil. 
But each member of the cartel is tempted to increase its production to get a larger 
share of the total profit. OPEC members frequently agree to reduce production but 
then cheat on their agreements. 
OPEC was most successful at maintaining cooperation and high prices in the 
period from 1973 to 1985. The price of crude oil rose from $3 a barrel in 1972 to 
$11 in 1974 and then to $35 in 1981. But in the mid-1980s, member countries  began 
arguing about production levels, and OPEC became ineffective at maintaining 
 cooperation. By 1986 the price of crude oil had fallen back to $13 a barrel. 
In recent years, the members of OPEC have continued to meet regularly, but 
they have been less successful at reaching and enforcing agreements. As a result, 
fluctuations in oil prices have been driven more by the natural forces of supply 
and demand than by the cartel’s artificial restrictions on production. While this lack 
of cooperation among OPEC nations has reduced the profits of the oil-producing 
nations below what they might have been, it has benefited consumers around the 
world. ●

17-2c Other Examples of the Prisoners’ Dilemma
We have seen how the prisoners’ dilemma can be used to understand the problem 
facing oligopolies. The same logic applies to many other situations as well. Here 
we consider two examples in which self-interest prevents cooperation and leads 
to an inferior outcome for the parties involved.
Arms Races  In the decades after World War II, the world’s two superpowers—
the United States and the Soviet Union—were engaged in a prolonged competi-
tion over military power. This topic motivated some of the early work on game 
theory. The game theorists pointed out that an arms race is much like the prison-
ers’ dilemma. 
To see why, consider the decisions of the United States and the Soviet Union 
about whether to build new weapons or to disarm. Each country prefers to have 
more arms than the other because a larger arsenal would give it more influence in 
world affairs. But each country also prefers to live in a world safe from the other 
country’s weapons.
Figure 3 shows the deadly game. If the Soviet Union chooses to arm, the United 
States is better off doing the same to prevent the loss of power. If the Soviet Union 
chooses to disarm, the United States is better off arming because doing so would 
make it more powerful. For each country, arming is a dominant strategy. Thus, 
each country chooses to continue the arms race, resulting in the inferior outcome 
with both countries at risk.
Throughout the Cold War era from about 1945 to 1991, the United States and 
the Soviet Union attempted to solve this problem through negotiation and agree-
ments over arms control. The problems that the two countries faced were similar 
to those that oligopolists encounter in trying to maintain a cartel. Just as oligopo-
lists argue over production levels, the United States and the Soviet Union argued 
over the amount of arms that each country would be allowed. And just as cartels 
have trouble enforcing production levels, the United States and the Soviet Union 
each feared that the other country would cheat on any agreement. In both arms 
races and oligopolies, the relentless logic of self-interest drives the participants 
toward the noncooperative outcome, which is worse for both parties.
FIGURE 3

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
Common Resources  In Chapter 11 we saw that people tend to overuse common 
resources. One can view this problem as an example of the prisoners’ dilemma.
Imagine that two oil companies—Exxon and Texaco—own adjacent oil fields. 
Under the fields is a common pool of oil worth $12 million. Drilling a well to 
 recover the oil costs $1 million. If each company drills one well, each will get half 
of the oil and earn a $5 million profit ($6 million in revenue minus $1 million in 
costs).
Because the pool of oil is a common resource, the companies will not use it 
 efficiently. Suppose that either company could drill a second well. If one company 
has two of the three wells, that company gets two-thirds of the oil, which yields 
a profit of $6 million. The other company gets one-third of the oil, for a profit of 
$3 million. Yet if each company drills a second well, the two companies again split 
the oil. In this case, each bears the cost of a second well, so profit is only $4 million 
for each company.
Figure 4 shows the game. Drilling two wells is a dominant strategy for each 
company. Once again, the self-interest of the two players leads them to an inferior 
outcome.
17-2d The Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Welfare of Society
The prisoners’ dilemma describes many of life’s situations, and it shows that 
cooperation can be difficult to maintain, even when cooperation would make 
both players in the game better off. Clearly, this lack of cooperation is a problem 
for those involved in these situations. But is lack of cooperation a problem from 
the standpoint of society as a whole? The answer depends on the circumstances.
In some cases, the noncooperative equilibrium is bad for society as well as the 
players. In the arms-race game in Figure 3, both the United States and the Soviet 
Union end up at risk. In the common-resources game in Figure 4, the extra wells 
dug by Texaco and Exxon are pure waste. In both cases, society would be better 
off if the two players could reach the cooperative outcome.
By contrast, in the case of oligopolists trying to maintain monopoly profits, 
lack of cooperation is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole. The 
monopoly outcome is good for the oligopolists, but it is bad for the consumers 
FIGURE 4
A Common-Resources Game

oil from a common pool, the profit that 
each earns depends on both the number

of the product. As we first saw in Chapter 7, the competitive outcome is best for 
society because it maximizes total surplus. When oligopolists fail to cooperate, 
the quantity they produce is closer to this optimal level. Put differently, the invis-
ible hand guides markets to allocate resources efficiently only when markets are 
competitive, and markets are competitive only when firms in the market fail to 
cooperate with one another.
Similarly, consider the case of the police questioning two suspects. Lack of 
cooperation between the suspects is desirable, for it allows the police to convict 
more criminals. The prisoners’ dilemma is a dilemma for the prisoners, but it can 
be a boon to everyone else. 
17-2e Why People Sometimes Cooperate
The prisoners’ dilemma shows that cooperation is difficult. But is it impossible? 
Not all prisoners, when questioned by the police, decide to turn in their partners 
in crime. Cartels sometimes manage to maintain collusive arrangements, despite 
the incentive for individual members to defect. Very often, players can solve the 
prisoners’ dilemma because they play the game not once but many times.
To see why cooperation is easier to enforce in repeated games, let’s return to 
our duopolists, Jack and Jill, whose choices were given in Figure 2. Jack and Jill 
would like to agree to maintain the monopoly outcome in which each produces 
30 gallons. Yet, if Jack and Jill are to play this game only once, neither has any 
incentive to live up to this agreement. Self-interest drives each of them to renege 
and choose the dominant strategy of 40 gallons.
Now suppose that Jack and Jill know that they will play the same game every 
week. When they make their initial agreement to keep production low, they can 
also specify what happens if one party reneges. They might agree, for instance, 
that once one of them reneges and produces 40 gallons, both of them will produce 
40 gallons forever after. This penalty is easy to enforce, for if one party is produc-
ing at a high level, the other has every reason to do the same. 
The threat of this penalty may be all that is needed to maintain cooperation. 
Each person knows that defecting would raise his or her profit from $1,800 to 
$2,000. But this benefit would last for only one week. Thereafter, profit would fall 
to $1,600 and stay there. As long as the players care enough about future profits, 
they will choose to forgo the one-time gain from defection. Thus, in a game of 
repeated prisoners’ dilemma, the two players may well be able to reach the coop-
erative outcome.
THE PRISONERS’ DILEMMA TOURNAMENT
Imagine that you are playing a game of prisoners’ dilemma with a 
person being “questioned” in a separate room. Moreover, imagine 
that you are going to play not once but many times. Your score at the 
end of the game is the total number of years in jail. You would like to make this 
score as small as possible. What strategy would you play? Would you begin by 
confessing or remaining silent? How would the other player’s actions affect your 
subsequent decisions about confessing?
Repeated prisoners’ dilemma is a complicated game. To encourage cooperation, 
players must penalize each other for not cooperating. Yet the strategy described 
earlier for Jack and Jill’s water cartel—defect forever as soon as the other player 
 defects—is not very forgiving. In a game repeated many times, a strategy that  allows 
players to return to the cooperative outcome after a period of noncooperation may 
be preferable.

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
To see what strategies work best, political scientist Robert Axelrod held a tourna-
ment. People entered by submitting computer programs designed to play repeated 
prisoners’ dilemma. Each program then played the game against all the other pro-
grams. The “winner” was the program that received the fewest total years in jail.
The winning program turned out to be a simple strategy called tit-for-tat. 
 According to tit-for-tat, a player should start by cooperating and then do whatever 
the other player did last time. Thus, a tit-for-tat player cooperates until the other 
player defects; then she defects until the other player cooperates again. In other 
words, this strategy starts out friendly, penalizes unfriendly players, and forgives 
them if warranted. To Axelrod’s surprise, this simple strategy did better than all the 
more complicated strategies that people had sent in. 
The tit-for-tat strategy has a long history. It is essentially the biblical strategy of 
“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The prisoners’ dilemma tournament sug-
gests that this may be a good rule of thumb for playing some of the games of life. ●

prisoners’ choices and explain which outcome is likely. • What does the 
prisoners’ dilemma teach us about oligopolies?
17-3 Public Policy toward Oligopolies
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that governments can some-
times improve market outcomes. This principle applies directly to oligopolistic 
markets. As we have seen, cooperation among oligopolists is undesirable from the 
standpoint of society as a whole because it leads to production that is too low and 
prices that are too high. To move the allocation of resources closer to the  social 
 optimum, policymakers should try to induce firms in an oligopoly to compete 
rather than cooperate. Let’s consider how policymakers do this and then examine 
the controversies that arise in this area of public policy.
17-3a Restraint of Trade and the Antitrust Laws
One way that policy discourages cooperation is through the common law. Nor-
mally, freedom of contract is an essential part of a market economy. Businesses 
and households use contracts to arrange mutually advantageous trades. In doing 
this, they rely on the court system to enforce contracts. Yet, for many centuries, 
judges in England and the United States have deemed agreements among com-
petitors to reduce quantities and raise prices to be contrary to the public good. 
They have therefore refused to enforce such agreements.
The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 codified and reinforced this policy:
Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, is declared to be illegal. . . . Every person who shall monopolize, or 
attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person or persons 
to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, 
or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand 
dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punish-
ments, in the discretion of the court.

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
The Sherman Act elevated agreements among oligopolists from unenforceable 
contracts to criminal conspiracies. 
The Clayton Act of 1914 further strengthened the antitrust laws. According to 
this law, if a person could prove that she was damaged by an illegal arrangement 
to restrain trade, that person could sue and recover three times the damages she 
sustained. The purpose of this unusual rule of triple damages is to encourage pri-
vate lawsuits against conspiring oligopolists. 
Today, both the U.S. Justice Department and private parties have the authority 
to bring legal suits to enforce the antitrust laws. As we discussed in  Chapter 15, 
these laws are used to prevent mergers that would lead to excessive market power 
in any single firm. In addition, these laws are used to prevent oligopolists from 
acting together in ways that would make their markets less competitive.
AN ILLEGAL PHONE CALL
Firms in oligopolies have a strong incentive to collude in order to 
reduce production, raise prices, and increase profits. The great 
18th-century economist Adam Smith was well aware of this poten-
tial market failure. In The Wealth of Nations he wrote, “People of the same trade sel-
dom meet together, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the  public, 
or in some diversion to raise prices.” 
To see a modern example of Smith’s observation, consider the following excerpt 
of a phone conversation between two airline executives in the early 1980s. The call 
was reported in the New York Times on February 24, 1983. Robert Crandall was pres-
ident of American Airlines, and Howard Putnam was president of Braniff Airways, 
a major airline at the time.
 
crandall:  I think it’s dumb as hell . . . to sit here and pound the @#$% 
out of each other and neither one of us making a #$%& dime.
 
putnam: Do you have a suggestion for me?
 
crandall:  Yes, I have a suggestion for you. Raise your $%*& fares  
20 percent. I’ll raise mine the next morning.
 
putnam: Robert, we . . . 
 
crandall: You’ll make more money, and I will, too.
 
putnam: We can’t talk about pricing!
 
crandall:  Oh @#$%, Howard. We can talk about any &*#@ thing we 
want to talk about.
Putnam was right: The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits competing executives 
from even talking about fixing prices. When Putnam gave a tape of this conversa-
tion to the Justice Department, the Justice Department filed suit against Crandall. 
Two years later, Crandall and the Justice Department reached a settlement in 
which Crandall agreed to various restrictions on his business activities, including 
his contacts with officials at other airlines. The Justice Department said that the 
terms of settlement would “protect competition in the airline industry, by prevent-
ing American and Crandall from any further attempts to monopolize passenger 
airline service on any route through discussions with competitors about the prices 
of airline services.” ●
17-3b Controversies over Antitrust Policy
Over time, much controversy has centered on what kinds of behavior the anti-
trust laws should prohibit. Most commentators agree that price-fixing agreements 
CASE

351
CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
among competing firms should be illegal. Yet the antitrust laws have been used 
to condemn some business practices whose effects are not obvious. Here we con-
sider three examples.
Resale Price Maintenance  One example of a controversial business practice is 
 resale price maintenance. Imagine that Superduper Electronics sells Blu-ray disc 
players to retail stores for $50. If Superduper requires the retailers to charge 
customers $75, it is said to engage in resale price maintenance. Any retailer that 
charged less than $75 would violate its contract with Superduper.
At first, resale price maintenance might seem anticompetitive and, therefore, 
detrimental to society. Like an agreement among members of a cartel, it prevents 
the retailers from competing on price. For this reason, the courts have at times 
viewed resale price maintenance as a violation of the antitrust laws.
Yet some economists defend resale price maintenance on two grounds. First, 
they deny that it is aimed at reducing competition. If Superduper Electronics 
wanted to exert its market power, it would do so by raising the wholesale price 
rather than controlling the resale price. Moreover, Superduper has no incentive to 
discourage competition among its retailers. Indeed, because a cartel of retailers 
sells less than a group of competitive retailers, Superduper would be worse off if 
its retailers were a cartel.
Second, economists believe that resale price maintenance has a legitimate goal. 
Superduper may want its retailers to provide customers a pleasant showroom and 
a knowledgeable sales force. Yet, without resale price maintenance, some custom-
ers would take advantage of one store’s service to learn about the Blu-ray player’s 
special features and then buy the item at a discount retailer that does not provide 
this service. Good customer service can be viewed as a public good among the 
retailers that sell Superduper products. As we discussed in Chapter 11, when one 
person provides a public good, others are able to enjoy it without paying for it. 
In this case, discount retailers would free ride on the service provided by other 
retailers, leading to less service than is desirable. Resale price maintenance is one 
way for Superduper to solve this free-rider problem.
The example of resale price maintenance illustrates an important principle: 
Business practices that appear to reduce competition may in fact have legitimate  purposes. 
This principle makes the application of the antitrust laws all the more difficult. 
The economists, lawyers, and judges in charge of enforcing these laws must 
 determine what kinds of behavior public policy should prohibit as impeding 
competition and reducing economic well-being. Often that job is not easy.
Predatory Pricing  Firms with market power normally use that power to raise 
prices above the competitive level. But should policymakers ever be concerned 
that firms with market power might charge prices that are too low? This question 
is at the heart of a second debate over antitrust policy.
Imagine that a large airline, call it Coyote Air, has a monopoly on some route. 
Then Roadrunner Express enters and takes 20 percent of the market, leaving 
Coyote with 80 percent. In response to this competition, Coyote starts slashing 
its fares. Some antitrust analysts argue that Coyote’s move could be anticompet-
itive: The price cuts may be intended to drive Roadrunner out of the market so 
Coyote can recapture its monopoly and raise prices again. Such behavior is called 
predatory pricing.
Although predatory pricing is a common claim in antitrust suits, some econo-
mists are skeptical of this argument and believe that predatory pricing is rarely,

352
PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
if ever, a profitable business strategy. Why? For a price war to drive out a rival, 
prices have to be driven below cost. Yet if Coyote starts selling cheap tickets at a 
loss, it had better be ready to fly more planes, because low fares will attract more 
customers. Roadrunner, meanwhile, can respond to Coyote’s predatory move by 
cutting back on flights. As a result, Coyote ends up bearing more than 80 percent 
of the losses, putting Roadrunner in a good position to survive the price war. As 
in the old Roadrunner–Coyote cartoons, the predator suffers more than the prey.
Economists continue to debate whether predatory pricing should be a concern 
for antitrust policymakers. Various questions remain unresolved. Is predatory 
pricing ever a profitable business strategy? If so, when? Are the courts capable of 
telling which price cuts are competitive and thus good for consumers and which 
are predatory? There are no simple answers.
Tying  A third example of a controversial business practice is tying. Suppose 
that Makemoney Movies produces two new films—The Avengers and Hamlet. If 
Makemoney offers theaters the two films together at a single price, rather than 
separately, the studio is said to be tying its two products. 
When the practice of tying movies was challenged, the Supreme Court banned 
it. The court reasoned as follows: Imagine that The Avengers is a blockbuster and 
Hamlet is an unprofitable art film. Then the studio could use the high demand for 
The Avengers to force theaters to buy Hamlet. It seemed that the studio could use 
tying as a mechanism for expanding its market power.
Many economists are skeptical of this argument. Imagine that theaters are will-
ing to pay $20,000 for The Avengers and nothing for Hamlet. Then the most that a 
theater would pay for the two movies together is $20,000—the same as it would 
pay for The Avengers by itself. Forcing the theater to accept a worthless movie as 
part of the deal does not increase the theater’s willingness to pay. Makemoney 
cannot increase its market power simply by bundling the two movies together.
Why, then, does tying exist? One possibility is that it is a form of price discrim-
ination. Suppose there are two theaters. City Theater is willing to pay $15,000 for 
The Avengers and $5,000 for Hamlet. Country Theater is just the opposite: It is will-
ing to pay $5,000 for The Avengers and $15,000 for Hamlet. If Makemoney charges 
separate prices for the two films, its best strategy is to charge $15,000 for each 
film, and each theater chooses to show only one film. Yet if Makemoney  offers 
the two movies as a bundle, it can charge each theater $20,000 for the  movies. 
Thus, if different theaters value the films differently, tying may allow the stu-
dio to  increase profit by charging a combined price closer to the buyers’ total 
 willingness to pay.
Tying remains a controversial business practice. The Supreme Court’s argu-
ment that tying allows a firm to extend its market power to other goods is not 
well founded, at least in its simplest form. Yet economists have proposed more 
elaborate theories for how tying can impede competition. Given our current eco-
nomic knowledge, it is unclear whether tying has adverse effects for society as a 
whole. 
THE MICROSOFT CASE
A particularly important and controversial antitrust case was the 
U.S. government’s suit against the Microsoft Corporation, filed 
in 1998. The case certainly did not lack drama. It pitted one of the

world’s richest men (Bill Gates) against one of the world’s most powerful regu-
latory agencies (the U.S. Justice Department). Testifying for the government was 
a prominent economist (MIT professor Franklin Fisher). Testifying for Microsoft 
was another prominent economist (MIT professor Richard Schmalensee). At stake 
was the future of one of the world’s most valuable companies (Microsoft) in one 
of the economy’s fastest-growing industries (computer software). 
A central issue in the Microsoft case involved tying—in particular, whether  
Microsoft should be allowed to integrate its Internet browser into its Windows  
operating system. The government claimed that Microsoft was bundling these two 
products together to expand its market power in computer operating systems into 
the unrelated market of Internet browsers. Allowing Microsoft to incorporate such 
products into its operating system, the government argued, would deter other soft-
ware companies from entering the market and offering new products.
Microsoft responded by pointing out that putting new features into old prod-
ucts is a natural part of technological progress. Cars today include CD players and 
air conditioners, which were once sold separately, and cameras come with built-in 
flashes. The same is true with operating systems. Over time, Microsoft has added 
many features to Windows that were previously stand-alone products. This has 
made computers more reliable and easier to use because consumers can be confi-
dent that the pieces work together. The integration of Internet technology, Microsoft 
argued, was the natural next step.
One point of disagreement concerned the extent of Microsoft’s market power. 
Noting that more than 80 percent of new personal computers used a Microsoft 
operating system, the government argued that the company had substantial mo-
nopoly power, which it was trying to expand. Microsoft replied that the software 
market is always changing and that Microsoft’s Windows was constantly being 
challenged by competitors, such as the Apple Mac and Linux operating systems. 
It also argued that the low price it charged for Windows—about $50, or only 
3 percent of the price of a typical computer—was evidence that its market power 
was severely limited.
Like many large antitrust suits, the Microsoft case became a legal morass. In 
November 1999, after a long trial, Judge Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had 
great monopoly power and that it had illegally abused that power. In June 2000, 
after hearings on possible remedies, he ordered that Microsoft be broken up into 
two companies—one that sold the operating system and one that sold applica-
tions software. A year later, an appeals court overturned Jackson’s breakup order 
and handed the case to a new judge. In September 2001, the Justice Department 
 announced that it no longer sought a breakup of the company and wanted to settle 
the case quickly. 
A settlement was finally reached in November 2002. Microsoft accepted some 
restrictions on its business practices, and the government accepted that a browser 
would remain part of the Windows operating system. But the settlement did not 
end Microsoft’s antitrust troubles. In recent years, the company has contended 
with several private antitrust suits, as well as suits brought by the European Union 
 alleging a variety of anticompetitive behaviors. ●

PART V   FIRM BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY
Oligopolies would like to act like monopolies, but self-interest drives them 
toward competition. Where oligopolies end up on this spectrum depends on the 
number of firms in the oligopoly and how cooperative the firms are. The story of 
the prisoners’ dilemma shows why oligopolies can fail to maintain cooperation, 
even when cooperation is in their best interest.
Policymakers regulate the behavior of oligopolists through the antitrust laws. 
The proper scope of these laws is the subject of ongoing debate. Although price 
fixing among competing firms clearly reduces economic welfare and should 
be illegal, some business practices that appear to reduce competition may have 
legitimate if subtle purposes. As a result, policymakers need to be careful when 
they use the substantial powers of the antitrust laws to place limits on firm 
behavior.
Google may be the next big target for 
antitrust regulators.
EU Files Formal Antitrust Charges 
against Google
T
he European Commission took direct aim 
at  Google Inc. Wednesday, charging the 
 Internet-search giant with skewing results to 
favor its comparison-shopping service. But the 
formal complaint may only be the opening salvo 
in a broader assault that prompts big changes 
at Google. 
European antitrust chief Margrethe 
 Vestager said she continues to examine other 
 domains, such as travel and local services, 
where  Google is accused of favoring its own 
services over those of others. She also opened 
a second front, intensifying a separate probe 
of Google’s conduct with its Android mobile- 
operating system.
If history is a guide, the European case against 
Google will grow. The bloc’s last big case against a 
U.S. tech firm began with charges against Microsoft 
Corp. in 2000 related to computer servers. The com-
mission later added charges against Microsoft for 
bundling its media player, and Web browser, with its 
Windows operating system.
The charges could lead to billions of euros 
in fines and requirements for Google to change 
its business practices. Microsoft ultimately paid 
€2.2 billion ($2.3 billion). But people inside and 
outside Microsoft say the case also altered the 
company’s culture, making it less brash and 
more cautious. 
“There are certain things you know you 
can’t do that other companies can do,” said 
Jean-François Bellis, a lawyer who represented 
 Microsoft against the EU. Being labeled “domi-
nant,” as the EU labeled Google on Wednesday, 
means executives now must worry about pleas-
ing regulators, as well as users.
Inside Google on Wednesday, “the amount 
of concern over [antitrust enforcement] is enor-
mous,” said one person close to the company….
The complaint marked the first time a regu-
lator has filed formal antitrust charges against 
Google. U.S. regulators closed their own investiga-
tion into Google’s search practices two years ago 
after the company agreed to voluntary changes.
That European regulators decided to move 
against Google when their U.S. counterparts 
held back reflects in part the company’s higher 
market share on the continent, but also differ-
ent legal standards. Unlike the U.S., European 
antitrust law protects competitors, as well as 
consumers. ■

CHAPTER 17   OLIGOPOLY
• Oligopolists maximize their total profits by forming a 
cartel and acting like a monopolist. Yet, if oligopolists 
make decisions about production levels individually, 
the result is a greater quantity and a lower price than 
under the monopoly outcome. The larger the number 
of firms in the oligopoly, the closer the quantity and 
price will be to the levels that would prevail under per-
fect competition.
• The prisoners’ dilemma shows that self-interest can 
prevent people from maintaining cooperation, even 
when cooperation is in their mutual interest. The logic 
of the prisoners’ dilemma applies in many situations, 
including arms races, common-resource problems, and 
oligopolies.
• Policymakers use the antitrust laws to prevent oligop-
olies from engaging in behavior that reduces competi-
tion. The application of these laws can be controversial, 
because some behavior that can appear to reduce com-
petition may in fact have legitimate business purposes.

4. Consider trade relations between the United States 
and Mexico. Assume that the leaders of the two coun-
tries believe the payoffs to alternative trade policies 
are as follows:

Mexico’s
Decision
a. What is the dominant strategy for the United 
States? For Mexico? Explain.
b. Define Nash equilibrium. What is the Nash equilib-
rium for trade policy?
c. In 1993, the U.S. Congress ratified the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, in which the 
United States and Mexico agreed to reduce trade 
barriers simultaneously. Do the perceived payoffs 
shown here justify this approach to trade policy? 
Explain.
d. Based on your understanding of the gains from 
trade (discussed in Chapters 3 and 9), do you 
think that these payoffs actually reflect a nation’s 
welfare under the four possible outcomes?
5. Synergy and Dynaco are the only two firms in a spe-
cific high-tech industry. They face the following payoff 
matrix as they decide upon the size of their research 
budget:

a. Does Synergy have a dominant strategy? Explain.
b. Does Dynaco have a dominant strategy? Explain.
c. Is there a Nash equilibrium for this scenario?  
Explain. (Hint: Look closely at the definition of 
Nash equilibrium.)
6. You and a classmate are assigned a project on which 
you will receive one combined grade. You each want 
to receive a good grade, but you also want to avoid 
hard work. In particular, here is the situation:
• If both of you work hard, you both get an A, which 
gives each of you 40 units of happiness.
• If only one of you works hard, you both get a B, 
which gives each of you 30 units of happiness.
• If neither of you works hard, you both get a D, 
which gives each of you 10 units of happiness.
• Working hard costs 25 units of happiness.
a. Fill in the payoffs in the following decision box:
Your Decision
Work

b. What is the likely outcome? Explain your answer.
c. If you get this classmate as your partner on a 
 series of projects throughout the year, rather than 
only once, how might that change the outcome 
you predicted in part (b)? 
d. Another classmate cares more about good grades: 
She gets 50 units of happiness for a B and 80 units 
of happiness for an A. If this classmate were your 
partner (but your preferences were unchanged), 
how would your answers to parts (a) and (b) 
change? Which of the two classmates would you 
prefer as a partner? Would she also want you as a 
partner?
7. A case study in the chapter describes a phone conver-
sation between the presidents of American Airlines 
and Braniff Airways. Let’s analyze the game between 
the two companies. Suppose that each company can 
charge either a high price for tickets or a low price. If 
one company charges $300, it earns low profit if the 
other company also charges $300 and high profit if 
the other company charges $600. On the other hand, 
if the company charges $600, it earns very low profit if 
the other company charges $300 and medium profit 
if the other company also charges $600. 
a. Draw the decision box for this game.
b. What is the Nash equilibrium in this game? 
Explain.
c. Is there an outcome that would be better than the 
Nash equilibrium for both airlines? How could it 
be achieved? Who would lose if it were achieved?

8. Two athletes of equal ability are competing for a prize 
of $10,000. Each is deciding whether to take a danger-
ous performance-enhancing drug. If one athlete takes 
the drug and the other does not, the one who takes the 
drug wins the prize. If both or neither take the drug, 
they tie and split the prize. Taking the drug imposes 
health risks that are equivalent to a loss of X dollars.
a. Draw a 2 3 2 payoff matrix describing the 
 decisions the athletes face.
b. For what X is taking the drug the Nash 
equilibrium?
c. Does making the drug safer (that is, lowering X) 
make the athletes better or worse off? Explain.
9. Little Kona is a small coffee company that is consid-
ering entering a market dominated by Big Brew. Each 
company’s profit depends on whether Little Kona 
enters and whether Big Brew sets a high price or a low 
price:
Big Brew
Enter
High Price
Brew makes
$3 million
Kona makes
$2 million
Kona loses
$1 million
Kona makes
zero
Kona makes
zero
Brew makes
$1 million
Brew makes
$7 million
Brew makes
$2 million
Low Price
Don’t
Enter
Little
Kona
a. Does either player in this game have a dominant 
strategy?
b. Does your answer to part (a) help you figure out 
what the other player should do?
c. What is the Nash equilibrium? Is there only one?
d. Big Brew threatens Little Kona by saying, “If you 
enter, we’re going to set a low price, so you had 
better stay out.” Do you think Little Kona should 
believe the threat? Why or why not? 
e. If the two firms could collude and agree on how 
to split the total profits, what outcome would they 
pick?

CHAPTER

The Markets for the Factors 
of Production

hen you finish school, your income will be determined largely by what kind 
of job you take. If you become a computer programmer, you will earn more 
than if you become a gas station attendant. This fact is not surprising, but it 
is not obvious why it is true. No law requires that computer programmers be paid 
more than gas station attendants. No ethical principle says that programmers are 
more deserving. What then determines which job will pay you the higher wage?
Your income, of course, is a small piece of a larger economic picture. In 2015, 
the total income of all U.S. residents (a statistic called national income) was about 
$16 trillion. People earned this income in various ways. Workers earned 
about two-thirds of it in the form of wages and fringe benefits. 
The rest went to landowners and to the owners of

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
capital—the economy’s stock of equipment and structures—in the form of rent, 
profit, and interest. What determines how much goes to  workers? To landown-
ers? To the owners of capital? Why do some  workers earn higher wages than oth-
ers, some landowners higher rental income than  others, and some capital owners 
greater profit than others? Why, in particular, do computer programmers earn 
more than gas station attendants?
The answers to these questions, like most in economics, hinge on supply and 
demand. The supply and demand for labor, land, and capital determine the prices 
paid to workers, landowners, and capital owners. To understand why some peo-
ple have higher incomes than others, therefore, we need to look more deeply at 
the markets for the services they provide. That is our job in this and the next two 
chapters.
This chapter provides the basic theory for the analysis of factor markets. As 
you may recall from Chapter 2, the factors of production are the inputs used to 
produce goods and services. Labor, land, and capital are the three most important 
factors of production. When a computer firm produces a new software program, it 
uses programmers’ time (labor), the physical space on which its offices are  located 
(land), and an office building and computer equipment (capital). Similarly, when 
a gas station sells gas, it uses attendants’ time (labor), the physical space (land), 
and the gas tanks and pumps (capital). 
In many ways factor markets resemble the markets for goods and services we 
analyzed in previous chapters, but they are different in one important way: The 
demand for a factor of production is a derived demand. That is, a firm’s demand 
for a factor of production is derived from its decision to supply a good in another 
market. The demand for computer programmers is inseparably linked to the sup-
ply of computer software, and the demand for gas station attendants is insepara-
bly linked to the supply of gasoline. 
In this chapter, we analyze factor demand by considering how a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm decides how much of any factor to buy. We begin our 
analysis by examining the demand for labor. Labor is the most important factor of 
production, because workers receive most of the total income earned in the U.S. 
economy. Later in the chapter, we will see that our analysis of the labor market 
also applies to the markets for the other factors of production.
The basic theory of factor markets developed in this chapter takes a large step 
toward explaining how the income of the U.S. economy is distributed among 
workers, landowners, and owners of capital. Chapter 19 builds on this analysis 
to examine in more detail why some workers earn more than others. Chapter 20

18-1 The Demand for Labor 
Labor markets, like other markets in the economy, are governed by the forces of 
supply and demand. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In panel (a), the supply and 
demand for apples determine the price of apples. In panel (b), the supply and 
 demand for apple pickers determine the price, or wage, of apple pickers.
As we have already noted, labor markets are different from most other mar-
kets because labor demand is a derived demand. Most labor services, rather than 
being final goods ready to be enjoyed by consumers, are inputs into the produc-
tion of other goods. To understand labor demand, we need to focus on the firms

that hire the labor and use it to produce goods for sale. By examining the link be-
tween the production of goods and the demand for labor to make those goods, we 
gain insight into the determination of equilibrium wages. 
18-1a The Competitive Profit-Maximizing Firm
Let’s look at how a typical firm, such as an apple producer, decides what quantity 
of labor to demand. The firm owns an apple orchard and each week decides how 
many apple pickers to hire to harvest its crop. After the firm makes its hiring deci-
sion, the workers pick as many apples as they can. The firm then sells the apples, 
pays the workers, and keeps what is left as profit.
We make two assumptions about our firm. First, we assume that our firm is com-
petitive both in the market for apples (where the firm is a seller) and in the market 
for apple pickers (where the firm is a buyer). A competitive firm is a price taker. 
Because there are many other firms selling apples and hiring apple pickers, a single 
firm has little influence over the price it gets for apples or the wage it pays apple 
pickers. The firm takes the price and the wage as given by market conditions. It 
only has to decide how many apples to sell and how many workers to hire.
Second, we assume that the firm is profit-maximizing. Thus, the firm does not 
directly care about the number of workers it employs or the number of apples it 
produces. It cares only about profit, which equals the total revenue from the sale 
of apples minus the total cost of producing them. The firm’s supply of apples and 
its demand for workers are derived from its primary goal of maximizing profit.
18-1b The Production Function and the Marginal Product of Labor
To make its hiring decision, a firm must consider how the size of its workforce  affects 
the amount of output produced. In our example, the apple producer must consider 
how the number of apple pickers affects the quantity of apples it can harvest and

sell. Table 1 gives a numerical example. Column (1) shows the number of workers. 
Column (2) shows the quantity of apples the workers harvest each week.
These two columns of numbers describe the firm’s ability to produce apples. 
Recall that economists use the term production function to describe the relation-
ship between the quantity of the inputs used in production and the quantity of 
output from production. Here the “input” is the apple pickers and the “output” 
is the apples. The other inputs—the trees themselves, the land, the firm’s trucks 
and tractors, and so on—are held fixed for now. This firm’s production function 
shows that if the firm hires 1 worker, that worker will pick 100 bushels of apples 
per week. If the firm hires 2 workers, the 2 workers together will pick 180 bushels 
per week. And so on.
Figure 2 graphs the data on labor and output presented in Table 1. The number 
of workers is on the horizontal axis, and the amount of output is on the vertical 
axis. This figure illustrates the production function.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that rational 
people think at the margin. This idea is the key to understanding how firms  decide 
what quantity of labor to hire. To take a step toward this decision, column (3) 
in Table 1 shows the marginal product of labor, the increase in the amount of 
output produced by an additional unit of labor. When the firm increases the num-
ber of workers from 1 to 2, for example, the amount of apples produced rises 
from 100 to 180 bushels. Therefore, the marginal product of the second worker is 
80 bushels.
Notice that as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor 
declines. That is, the production process exhibits diminishing marginal product. 
At first, when only a few workers are hired, they can pick the low-hanging fruit. 
As the number of workers increases, additional workers have to climb higher up 
the ladders to find apples to pick. Hence, as more and more workers are hired, 
each additional worker contributes less to the production of apples. For this rea-
son, the production function in Figure 2 becomes flatter as the number of workers 
rises.

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
18-1c  The Value of the Marginal Product  
and the Demand for Labor
Our profit-maximizing firm is concerned not about apples themselves but rather about 
the money it can make by producing and selling them. As a result, when deciding how 
many workers to hire to pick apples, the firm considers how much profit each worker 
will bring in. Because profit is total revenue minus total cost, the profit from an addi-
tional worker is the worker’s contribution to revenue minus the worker’s wage.
To find the worker’s contribution to revenue, we must convert the marginal 
product of labor (which is measured in bushels of apples) into the value of the mar-
ginal product (which is measured in dollars). We do this using the price of apples. 
To continue our example, if a bushel of apples sells for $10 and if an additional 
worker produces 80 bushels of apples, then the worker produces $800 of revenue.
The value of the marginal product of any input is the marginal product of that 
input multiplied by the market price of the output. Column (4) in Table 1 shows 
the value of the marginal product of labor in our example, assuming the price 
of apples is $10 per bushel. Because the market price is constant for a competi-
tive firm while the marginal product declines with more workers, the value of the 
marginal product diminishes as the number of workers rises. Economists some-
times call this column of numbers the firm’s marginal revenue product: It is the extra 
revenue the firm gets from hiring an additional unit of a factor of production.
Now consider how many workers the firm will hire. Suppose that the market 
wage for apple pickers is $500 per week. In this case, as you can see in Table 1, 
the first worker that the firm hires is profitable: The first worker yields $1,000 in 
revenue, or $500 in profit. Similarly, the second worker yields $800 in additional 
revenue, or $300 in profit. The third worker produces $600 in additional revenue, 
or $100 in profit. After the third worker, however, hiring workers is unprofitable. 
The fourth worker would yield only $400 of additional revenue. Because the 
worker’s wage is $500, hiring the fourth worker would mean a $100 reduction in 
profit. Thus, the firm hires only 3 workers.

ward because the marginal product of labor diminishes as the number of workers

rises. The figure also includes a horizontal line at the market wage. To maximize 
profit, the firm hires workers up to the point where these two curves cross. Below 
this level of employment, the value of the marginal product exceeds the wage, so 
hiring another worker increases profit. Above this level of employment, the value 
of the marginal product is less than the wage, so the marginal worker is unprofit-
able. Thus, a competitive, profit-maximizing firm hires workers up to the point at which 
the value of the marginal product of labor equals the wage.
Now that we understand the profit-maximizing hiring strategy for a com-
petitive firm, we can offer a theory of labor demand. Recall that a firm’s labor-
demand curve tells us the quantity of labor that a firm decides to hire at any given 
wage. Figure 3 shows that the firm makes that decision by choosing the quan-
tity of labor at which the value of the marginal product equals the wage. As a 
result, the value-of-marginal-product curve is the labor-demand curve for a competitive, 
profit-maximizing firm.
18-1d What Causes the Labor-Demand Curve to Shift?
We now understand that the labor-demand curve reflects the value of the mar-
ginal product of labor. With this insight in mind, let’s consider a few of the things 
that might cause the labor-demand curve to shift.
The Output Price  The value of the marginal product is marginal product times 
the price of the firm’s output. Thus, when the output price changes, the value 
of the marginal product changes, and the labor-demand curve shifts. An increase 
in the price of apples, for instance, raises the value of the marginal product of each 
worker who picks apples and, therefore, increases labor demand from the firms 
that supply apples. Conversely, a decrease in the price of apples reduces the value 
of the marginal product and decreases labor demand. 
Technological Change  Between 1960 and 2015, the output a typical U.S. worker 
produced in an hour rose by 195 percent. Why? The most important reason is 
FIGURE 3
The Value of the Marginal Product  
of Labor
This figure shows how the value of 
the marginal product (the marginal 
product times the price of the output) 
depends on the number of workers. 
The curve slopes downward because 
of diminishing marginal product. For 
a competitive, profit-maximizing firm, 
this value-of-marginal-product curve is 
also the firm’s labor-demand curve.

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
technological progress: Scientists and engineers are constantly figuring out new 
and better ways of doing things. This has profound implications for the labor mar-
ket. Advances in technology typically raise the marginal product of labor, which in 
turn increases the demand for labor and shifts the labor-demand curve to the right. 
It is also possible for technological change to reduce labor demand. The inven-
tion of a cheap industrial robot, for instance, could conceivably reduce the mar-
ginal product of labor, shifting the labor-demand curve to the left. Economists 
call this labor-saving technological change. History suggests, however, that most 
technological progress is instead labor-augmenting. For example, a carpenter 
with a nail gun is more productive than a carpenter with only a hammer. Labor-
augmenting technological advance explains persistently rising employment in the 
face of rising wages: Even though wages (adjusted for inflation) increased by 165 
percent from 1960 to 2015, firms nonetheless more than doubled the amount of 
labor they employed.
The Supply of Other Factors  The quantity of one factor of production that is 
available can affect the marginal product of other factors. The productivity of 
apple pickers depends, for instance, on the availability of ladders. If the supply 
Input Demand and Output Supply:  
Two Sides of the Same Coin
I
n Chapter 14, we saw how a competitive, profit-maximizing firm de-
cides how much of its output to sell: It chooses the quantity of output 
at which the price of the good equals the marginal cost of production. 
We have just seen how such a firm decides how much labor to hire: It 
chooses the quantity of labor at which the wage equals the value of the 
marginal product. Because the production function links the quantity of 
inputs to the quantity of output, you should not be surprised to learn that 
the firm’s decision about input demand is closely linked to its decision 
about output supply. In fact, these two decisions are two sides of the 
same coin.
To see this relationship more fully, let’s consider how the marginal 
product of labor (MPL) and marginal cost (MC ) are related. Suppose an 
additional worker costs $500 and has a marginal product of 50 bush-
els of apples. In this case, producing 50 more bushels costs $500; the 
marginal cost of a bushel is $500/50, or $10. More generally, if W is 
the wage, and an extra unit of labor produces MPL units of output, then 
the marginal cost of a unit of output is MC 5 W  / MPL.
This analysis shows that diminishing marginal product is closely 
related to increasing marginal cost. When the apple orchard grows 
crowded with workers, each additional worker adds less to the pro-
duction of apples (MPL falls). Similarly, when the apple firm is pro-
ducing a large quantity of apples, the orchard is already crowded with 
workers, so it is more costly to produce an additional bushel of apples  
(MC rises). 
Now consider our cri-
terion for profit maximiza-
tion. We determined earlier 
that a profit-maximizing 
firm chooses the quantity 
of labor so that the value of 
the marginal product (P 3 MPL) 
equals the wage (W  ). We can write this mathematically as
P 3 MPL 5 W.
If we divide both sides of this equation by MPL, we obtain
P 5 W  / MPL.
We just noted that W  / MPL equals marginal cost, MC. Therefore, we can 
substitute to obtain
P 5 MC.
This equation states that the price of the firm’s output equals the mar-
ginal cost of producing a unit of output. Thus, when a competitive firm 
hires labor up to the point at which the value of the marginal product 
equals the wage, it also produces up to the point at which the price 
equals marginal cost. Our analysis of labor demand in this chapter is 
just another way of looking at the production decision we first saw in 
Chapter 14. ■

of ladders declines, the marginal product of apple pickers will decline as well, 
 reducing the demand for apple pickers. We consider the linkage among the  factors 
of production more fully later in the chapter.

18-2 The Supply of Labor
Having analyzed labor demand in detail, let’s turn to the other side of the market 
and consider labor supply. A formal model of labor supply is included in Chapter 
21, where we develop the theory of household decision making. Here we infor-
mally discuss the decisions that lie behind the labor-supply curve.
18-2a The Trade-off between Work and Leisure
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs. 
Probably no trade-off in a person’s life is more obvious or more important than 
the trade-off between work and leisure. The more hours you spend working, 
the fewer hours you have to watch TV, browse social media, enjoy dinner with 
friends, or pursue your favorite hobby. The trade-off between labor and leisure 
lies behind the labor-supply curve.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the cost of something is what 
you give up to get it. What do you give up to get an hour of leisure? You give up 
an hour of work, which in turn means an hour of wages. Thus, if your wage is $15 
per hour, the opportunity cost of an hour of leisure is $15. And when you get a 
raise to $20 per hour, the opportunity cost of enjoying leisure goes up.
The labor-supply curve reflects how workers’ decisions about the labor- leisure 
trade-off respond to a change in that opportunity cost. An upward-sloping 
labor-supply curve means that an increase in the wage induces workers to increase 
the quantity of labor they supply. Because time is limited, more work means less 
leisure. That is, workers respond to the increase in the opportunity cost of leisure 
by taking less of it.
It is worth noting that the labor-supply curve need not be upward-sloping. 
Imagine you got that raise from $15 to $20 per hour. The opportunity cost of 
leisure is now greater, but you are also richer than you were before. You might 
 decide that with your extra wealth you can now afford to enjoy more leisure. That 
is, at the higher wage, you might choose to work fewer hours. If so, your labor- 
supply curve would slope backward. In Chapter 21, we discuss this possibility in 
terms of conflicting effects on your labor-supply decision (called the income and 
substitution effects). For now, we ignore the possibility of backward-sloping labor 
supply and assume that the labor-supply curve is upward-sloping.
18-2b What Causes the Labor-Supply Curve to Shift?
The labor-supply curve shifts whenever people change the amount they want to 
work at a given wage. Let’s now consider some of the events that might cause 
such a shift.
Changes in Tastes   In 1950, 34 percent of women were employed at paid jobs or 
looking for work. By 2015, that number had risen to 57 percent. Although there

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
are many explanations for this development, one of them is changing tastes, or 
attitudes toward work. Sixty-five years ago, it was the norm for women to stay 
at home and raise their children. Today, the typical family size 
is smaller, and more mothers choose to work. The result is an 
increase in the supply of labor.
Changes in Alternative Opportunities  The supply of labor 
in any one labor market depends on the opportunities avail-
able in other labor markets. If the wage earned by pear pick-
ers suddenly rises, some apple pickers may choose to switch 
occupations, causing the supply of labor in the market for apple 
pickers to fall.
Immigration  Movement of workers from region to region, 
or country to country, is another important source of shifts in 
labor supply. When immigrants come to the United States, for 
instance, the supply of labor in the United States increases and 
the supply of labor in the immigrants’ home countries falls. In 
fact, much of the policy debate about immigration centers on 
its effect on labor supply and, thereby, equilibrium wages in the 
labor market.

18-3  Equilibrium in the Labor 
Market
So far we have established two facts about how wages are deter-
mined in competitive labor markets:
• The wage adjusts to balance the supply and demand for 
labor. 
• The wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor. 
At first, it might seem surprising that the wage can do both of 
these things at once. In fact, there is no real puzzle here, but un-
derstanding why there is no puzzle is an important step toward 
understanding wage determination.
Figure 4 shows the labor market in equilibrium. The wage 
and the quantity of labor have adjusted to balance supply and 
demand. When the market is in this equilibrium, each firm has 
bought as much labor as it finds profitable at the equilibrium 
wage. That is, each firm has followed the rule for profit maxi-
mization: It has hired workers until the value of the marginal 
product equals the wage. Hence, the wage must equal the value 
of the marginal product of labor once it has brought supply and 
demand into equilibrium.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
This brings us to an important lesson: Any event that changes the supply or  demand 
for labor must change the equilibrium wage and the value of the marginal product by the 
same amount because these must always be equal. To see how this works, let’s consider 
some events that shift these curves. 
18-3a Shifts in Labor Supply
Suppose that immigration increases the number of workers willing to pick apples. 
As Figure 5 shows, the supply of labor shifts to the right from S1 to S2. At the ini-
tial wage W1, the quantity of labor supplied now exceeds the quantity demanded. 
This surplus of labor puts downward pressure on the wage of apple pickers, and 
the fall in the wage from W1 to W2 makes it profitable for firms to hire more work-
ers. As the number of workers employed in each apple orchard rises, the marginal 
product of a worker falls, and so does the value of the marginal product. In the 
new equilibrium, both the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor 
are lower than they were before the influx of new workers.
An episode from Israel, studied by MIT economist Joshua Angrist, illustrates 
how a shift in labor supply can alter the equilibrium in a labor market. During 
most of the 1980s, many thousands of Palestinians regularly commuted from their 
homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to jobs in Israel, primar-
ily in the construction and agriculture industries. In 1988, however, political un-
rest in these occupied areas induced the Israeli government to take steps that, as 
a by-product, reduced this supply of workers. Curfews were imposed, work per-
mits were checked more thoroughly, and a ban on overnight stays of Palestinians 
in Israel was enforced more rigorously. The economic impact of these steps was 
exactly as theory predicts: The number of Palestinians with jobs in Israel fell by 
half, while those who continued to work in Israel enjoyed wage increases of about 
50 percent. With a reduced number of Palestinian workers in Israel, the value of 
the marginal product of the remaining workers was much higher.
When considering the economics of immigration, keep in mind that the econ-
omy consists not of a single labor market but rather a variety of labor markets for 
FIGURE 4

Like all prices, the price of labor 
(the wage) depends on supply and 
demand. Because the demand curve

FIGURE 5
A Shift in Labor Supply
When labor supply increases from  
S1 to S2, perhaps because of an 
 immigration wave of new workers, the 
equilibrium wage falls from W1 to W2. 
At this lower wage, firms hire more 
labor, so employment rises from L1 to 
L2. The change in the wage reflects a 
change in the value of the marginal 
product of labor: With more workers, 
the added output from an extra worker 
is smaller.

different kinds of workers. A wave of immigration may lower wages in those labor 
markets in which the new immigrants seek work, but it could have the opposite 
effect in other labor markets. For example, if the new immigrants look for jobs as 
apple pickers, the supply of apple pickers increases and the wage of apple pickers 
declines. But suppose the new immigrants are physicians who use some of their 
income to buy apples. In this case, the wave of immigration increases the supply of 
physicians but increases the demand for apples and thus apple pickers. As a result, 
the wages of physicians decline, and the wages of apple pickers rise. The linkages 
among various markets—sometimes called general equilibrium  effects—make ana-
lyzing the full effect of immigration more complex than it first appears. 
18-3b Shifts in Labor Demand
Now suppose that an increase in the popularity of apples causes their price to rise. 
This price increase does not change the marginal product of labor for any given 
number of workers, but it does raise the value of the marginal product. With a 
higher price for apples, hiring more apple pickers is now profitable. As Figure 6 
shows, when the demand for labor shifts to the right from D1 to D2, the equilibrium 
wage rises from W1 to W2 and equilibrium employment rises from L1 to L2. Once 
again, the wage and the value of the marginal product of labor move together.
This analysis shows that prosperity for firms in an industry is often linked to 
prosperity for workers in that industry. When the price of apples rises, apple pro-
ducers make greater profit and apple pickers earn higher wages. When the price 
of apples falls, apple producers earn smaller profit and apple pickers earn lower 
wages. This lesson is well known to workers in industries with highly volatile 
prices. Workers in oil fields, for instance, know from experience that their earn-
ings are closely linked to the world price of crude oil.
From these examples, you should now have a good understanding of how 
wages are set in competitive labor markets. Labor supply and labor demand to-
gether determine the equilibrium wage, and shifts in the supply or demand curve

Here is an interview with Pia 
Orrenius, a senior economist at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who 
studies immigration.
Q: What can you tell us about the size 
of the immigrant population in the United 
States?
A: Immigrants make up about 13.3 per-
cent of the overall population, which means 
about 42 million foreign-born live in the 
United States. The commonly accepted 2014 
estimate for the unauthorized portion of the 
foreign-born population is 11.3 million. Immi-
grants come from all parts of the world, but 
we’ve seen big changes in their origins. In the 
1950s and 1960s, 75 percent of immigrants 
were from Europe. Today, over 80 percent are 
from Latin America and Asia. Inflows are also 
much larger today, with 1 million to 2 million 
newcomers entering each year, although lev-
els were significantly depressed in the after-
math of the Great Recession of 2007–2009, 
when the housing bust led to a significant 
decline in illegal immigration.
What’s interesting about the United 
States is how our economy has been able to 
absorb immigrants and put them to work. 
U.S. immigrants are much more likely to be 
working compared with immigrants in other 
developed countries. This is partly because 
we don’t set high entry-level wages or have 
cumbersome hiring and firing rules. In this 
type of flexible system, there are more job 
openings. Workers have more opportunities. 
Of course, entry-level wages are also lower, 
but immigrants at least get their foot in 
the door.
Being in the workforce allows immigrants 
to interact with the rest of society. They learn 
the language faster, pay taxes and become 
stakeholders.
Q: Where do immigrants fit into the U.S. 
economy?
A: U.S. immigrants are diverse in eco-
nomic terms. We rely on them to fill both high- 
and low-skilled jobs. Some immigrants do 
medium-skilled work, but more than anything 
else they’re found on the low and the high 
ends of the education distribution. 
The economic effects of immigration are 
positive, but the fiscal impact depends on 
the group. We have a very important group 
of high-skilled immigrants. We rely on them 
to fill high-level jobs in health and STEM 
[science, technology, engineering, and math-
ematics] occupations. Each year, over one-
third of Ph.D.s in science and engineering are 
awarded to students who were born abroad. 
Moreover, research shows that foreign-born 
workers in STEM fields are more innovative 
and entrepreneurial than their U.S.-born 
counterparts, which boosts productivity 
growth.
High-skilled immigration also contributes 
positively to government finances. People 
tend to focus on undocumented or low-skilled 
immigrants when discussing immigration 
and often do not recognize the tremendous 
contributions of high-skilled immigrants.

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
Q: What about the low-skilled immigration?
A: With low-skilled immigration, the eco-
nomic benefits of the added labor, such as 
lower prices for consumers and higher returns 
to capital, have to be balanced against the 
fiscal impact, which is likely negative. The 
fiscal impact is the difference between what 
families contribute in taxes and what they use 
up in the form of publicly provided services. 
What makes the fiscal issue more difficult 
is the distribution of the burden. The federal 
government reaps much of the revenue from 
immigrants who work and pay employment 
taxes. State and local governments realize 
less of that benefit and have to pay more 
of the costs associated with low-skilled 
 immigration— usually education and health 
expenses.
Q: Does it matter whether the immigration 
is legal or not?
A: Illegal immigration has helped fuel the 
U.S. economy for many years. Five percent of 
the U.S. workforce is made up of unautho-
rized workers—the outcome of decades of 
robust labor demand and, until recently, lax 
enforcement. Nevertheless, from an economic 
and fiscal perspective, it makes more sense 
to differentiate among immigrants of various 
skill levels than it does to focus on legal 
status.
The economic benefits of low-skilled im-
migrants aren’t typically going to depend on 
how they entered the United States. Unau-
thorized immigrants may pay less in taxes, 
but they’re also ineligible for most public 
programs. Lacking legal status doesn’t mean 
these immigrants have a worse fiscal impact. 
In fact, a low-skilled unauthorized immigrant 
likely creates less fiscal burden than a low-
skilled legal immigrant because the undocu-
mented get almost no government benefits. 
Q: How does immigration affect jobs and 
earnings for the native-born population?
A: Labor economists have looked long and 
hard at this question, namely how immigra-
tion has affected the wages of Americans, 
particularly the low-skilled who lack a high 
school degree. One reason we worry about this 
is that the real wages of less-educated U.S. 
men have been falling since the late 1970s. 
The studies tend to show that little of the 
decline is due to immigration. The consensus 
seems to be that wages overall are about  
1 to 3 percent lower today as a result of 
 immigration, although some scholars find 
larger effects for low-skilled workers. Still, 
labor economists think it’s a bit of a puzzle 
that they haven’t been able to systematically 
identify larger adverse wage effects.
The reason may be the way the economy 
is constantly adjusting to the inflow of immi-
grants. On a geographical basis, for example, 
a large influx of immigrants into an area 
tends to encourage an inflow of physical cap-
ital or a change in technology or production 
processes which puts new workers to use. So 
you have an increase in labor supply, but you 
also have an increase in labor demand, and 
the wage effects are ameliorated. ■

for labor cause the equilibrium wage to change. At the same time, profit maximi-
zation by the firms that demand labor ensures that the equilibrium wage always 
equals the value of the marginal product of labor.

PRODUCTIVITY AND WAGES 
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that our stan-
dard of living depends on our ability to produce goods and services. 
We can now see how this principle works in the market for labor. In 
particular, our analysis of labor demand shows that wages equal productivity as 
measured by the value of the marginal product of labor. Put simply, highly pro-
ductive workers are highly paid, and less productive workers are less highly paid.
This lesson is key to understanding why workers today are better off than work-
ers in previous generations. Table 2 presents some data on growth in productivity 
and growth in real wages (that is, wages adjusted for inflation). From 1960 to 2015, 
productivity as measured by output per hour of work grew about 2.0 percent per 
year. Real wages grew at 1.8 percent—almost the same rate. With a growth rate of 
2 percent per year, productivity and real wages double about every 35 years.
Productivity growth varies over time. Table 2 also shows the data for three 
shorter periods that economists have identified as having very different

productivity experiences. Around 1973, the U.S. economy experienced a signif-
icant slowdown in productivity growth that lasted until 1995. The cause of this 
productivity slowdown is yet to be fully explained, but the link between produc-
tivity and real wages is exactly as standard theory predicts. The slowdown in pro-
ductivity growth from 2.7 to 1.4 percent per year coincided with a slowdown in 
real wage growth from 2.7 to 1.2 percent per year. 
Productivity growth picked up again about 1995, and many observers hailed 
the arrival of the “new economy.” This productivity acceleration is most often 
attributed to the spread of computers and information technology. As theory pre-
dicts, growth in real wages picked up as well. From 1995 to 2015, productivity grew 
by 2.1 percent per year and real wages grew by 1.8 percent per year.
The bottom line: Both theory and history confirm the close connection between 
productivity and real wages. ●

Monopsony
O
n the preceding pages, we built our analysis of the labor market with 
the tools of supply and demand. In doing so, we assumed that the 
labor market was competitive. That is, we assumed that there were many 
buyers and sellers of labor, so each buyer or seller had a negligible effect 
on the wage.
Yet that assumption doesn’t always apply. Imagine that the labor 
market in a small town is dominated by a single, large employer. That 
employer can exert a large influence on the going wage, and it can use 
its market power to alter the outcome in the labor market. Such a market 
in which there is a single buyer is called a monopsony.
A monopsony (a market with one buyer) is in many ways similar to 
a monopoly (a market with one seller). Recall from Chapter 15 that a 
 monopoly firm produces less of the good than would a competitive firm; 
by reducing the quantity offered for sale, the monopoly firm moves 
along the product’s demand curve, raising the price and also its profit. 
Similarly, a monopsony 
firm in a labor market 
hires fewer workers than 
would a competitive firm; 
by reducing the number of 
jobs available, the monop-
sony firm moves along the labor 
supply curve, reducing the wage it pays and raising its profit. Thus, both 
monopolists and monopsonists reduce economic activity in a market 
below the socially optimal level. In both cases, the existence of market 
power distorts the outcome and causes deadweight losses. 
This book does not present the formal model of monopsony because 
monopsonies are rare. In most labor markets, workers have many pos-
sible employers, and firms compete with one another to attract workers. 
In this case, the model of supply and demand is the best one to use. ■

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
18-4  The Other Factors of Production:  
Land and Capital
We have seen how firms decide how much labor to hire and how these deci-
sions determine workers’ wages. At the same time that firms are hiring workers, 
they are also deciding about other inputs to production. For example, our apple-
producing firm might have to choose the size of its apple orchard and the number 
of ladders for its apple pickers. We can think of the firm’s factors of production as 
falling into three categories: labor, land, and capital.
The meaning of the terms labor and land is clear, but the definition of capital is 
somewhat tricky. Economists use the term capital to refer to the stock of equip-
ment and structures used for production. That is, the economy’s capital represents 
the accumulation of goods produced in the past that are being used in the present 
to produce new goods and services. For our apple firm, the capital stock includes 
the ladders used to climb the trees, the trucks used to transport the apples, the 
buildings used to store the apples, and even the trees themselves.
18-4a Equilibrium in the Markets for Land and Capital 
What determines how much the owners of land and capital earn for their contri-
bution to the production process? Before answering this question, we need to dis-
tinguish between two prices: the purchase price and the rental price. The purchase 
price of land or capital is the price a person pays to own that factor of production 
indefinitely. The rental price is the price a person pays to use that factor for a lim-
ited period of time. It is important to keep this distinction in mind because, as we 
will see, these prices are determined by somewhat different economic forces. 
Having defined these terms, we can now apply the theory of factor demand that 
we developed for the labor market to the markets for land and capital. Because the 
wage is the rental price of labor, much of what we have learned about wage deter-
mination applies also to the rental prices of land and capital. As Figure 7  illustrates,

Supply and demand determine the compensation paid to the owners of land, as shown 
in panel (a), and the compensation paid to the owners of capital, as shown in panel (b). 
The demand for each factor, in turn, depends on the value of the marginal product of 
that factor.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
the rental price of land, shown in panel (a), and the rental price of capital, shown 
in panel (b), are determined by supply and demand. Moreover, the demand for 
land and capital is determined just like the demand for labor. That is, when our 
apple-producing firm is deciding how much land and how many ladders to rent, 
it follows the same logic as when deciding how many workers to hire. For both 
land and capital, the firm increases the quantity hired until the value of the factor’s 
marginal product equals the factor’s price. Thus, the demand curve for each factor 
reflects the marginal productivity of that factor. 
We can now explain how much income goes to labor, how much goes to land-
owners, and how much goes to the owners of capital. As long as the firms using 
the factors of production are competitive and profit-maximizing, each factor’s 
rental price must equal the value of the marginal product for that factor. Labor, 
land, and capital each earn the value of their marginal contribution to the production 
process.
Now consider the purchase price of land and capital. The rental price and the 
purchase price are related: Buyers are willing to pay more for a piece of land or 
capital if it produces a valuable stream of rental income. And as we have just seen, 
the equilibrium rental income at any point in time equals the value of that factor’s 
marginal product. Therefore, the equilibrium purchase price of a piece of land or 
capital depends on both the current value of the marginal product and the value 
of the marginal product expected to prevail in the future.
What Is Capital Income?
L
abor income is an easy concept to understand: It is the paycheck that 
workers get from their employers. The income earned by capital, how-
ever, is less obvious.
In our analysis, we have been implicitly assuming that households 
own the economy’s stock of capital—ladders, drill presses, warehouses, 
and so on—and rent it to the firms that use it. Capital income, in this 
case, is the rent that households receive for the use of their capital. This 
assumption simplified our analysis of how capital owners are compen-
sated, but it is not entirely realistic. In fact, firms usually own the capital 
they use, and therefore, they receive the earnings from this capital.
These earnings from capital, however, are paid to households even-
tually in a variety of forms. Some of the earnings are paid in the form of 
interest to those households that have lent money to firms. Bondholders 
and bank depositors are two examples of recipients of interest. Thus, 
when you receive interest on your bank account, that income is part of 
the economy’s capital income.
In addition, some of the earnings from capital are paid to house-
holds in the form of dividends. Dividends are payments by a firm to the 
firm’s stockholders. A stockholder is a person who has bought a share in 
the ownership of the firm 
and, therefore, is entitled 
to a portion of the firm’s 
profits.
A firm does not have 
to pay out all its earnings to 
households in the form of inter-
est and dividends. Instead, it can retain some earnings within the firm 
and use these earnings to buy additional capital. Unlike dividends, these 
 retained earnings do not yield a direct cash payment to the firm’s stock-
holders, but the stockholders benefit from them nonetheless. Because 
retained earnings increase the amount of capital the firm owns, they tend 
to increase future earnings and, thereby, the value of the firm’s stock. 
These institutional details are interesting and important, but they 
do not alter our conclusion about the income earned by the owners of 
 capital. Capital is paid according to the value of its marginal  product, 
regardless of whether this income is transmitted to households in 
the form of interest or dividends or whether it is kept within firms as 
 retained earnings. ■

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
18-4b Linkages among the Factors of Production
We have seen that the price paid for any factor of production—labor, land, or 
 capital—equals the value of the marginal product of that factor. The marginal 
product of any factor, in turn, depends on the quantity of that factor that is avail-
able. Because of diminishing marginal product, a factor in abundant supply has 
a low marginal product and thus a low price, and a factor in scarce supply has a 
high marginal product and a high price. As a result, when the supply of a factor 
falls, its equilibrium price rises. 
When the supply of any factor changes, however, the effects are not limited 
to the market for that factor. In most situations, factors of production are used 
together in a way that makes the productivity of each factor depend on the quan-
tities of the other factors available for use in the production process. Therefore, 
when some event changes the supply of any one factor of production, it will typi-
cally affect not only the earnings of that factor but also the earnings of all the other 
factors as well.
For example, suppose a hurricane destroys many of the ladders that workers 
use to pick apples from the orchards. What happens to the earnings of the vari-
ous factors of production? Most obviously, when the supply of ladders falls, the 
equilibrium rental price of ladders rises. Those owners who were lucky enough to 
avoid damage to their ladders now earn a higher return when they rent out their 
ladders to the firms that produce apples. 
Yet the effects of this event do not stop at the ladder market. Because there are 
fewer ladders with which to work, the workers who pick apples have a smaller 
marginal product. Thus, the reduction in the supply of ladders reduces the de-
mand for the labor of apple pickers, and this shift in demand causes the equilib-
rium wage to fall. 
This story shows a general lesson: An event that changes the supply of any factor of 
production can alter the earnings of all the factors. The change in earnings of any fac-
tor can be found by analyzing the impact of the event on the value of the marginal 
product of that factor.

STUDY
THE ECONOMICS OF THE BLACK DEATH 
In 14th-century Europe, the bubonic plague wiped out about 
one-third of the population within a few years. This event, called the 
Black Death, provides a grisly natural experiment to test the theory 
of factor markets that we have just developed. Consider the effects of the Black 
Death on those who were lucky enough to survive. What do you think happened 
to the wages earned by workers and the rents earned by landowners?
To answer this question, let’s examine the effects of a reduced population on 
the marginal product of labor and the marginal product of land. With a smaller 
supply of workers, the marginal product of labor rises. (This is diminishing mar-
ginal product working in reverse.) Thus, we would expect the Black Death to raise 
wages.
Because land and labor are used together in production, a smaller supply of 
workers also affects the market for land, the other major factor of production in me-
dieval Europe. With fewer workers available to farm the land, an additional unit of 
land produced less additional output. In other words, the marginal product of land 
fell. Thus, we would expect the Black Death to lower rents.
In fact, both predictions are consistent with the historical evidence. Wages 
 approximately doubled during this period, and rents declined 50 percent or more. 
Workers who survived 
the plague were lucky in 
more ways than one.

18-5 Conclusion
This chapter has explained how labor, land, and capital are compensated for the 
roles they play in the production process. The theory developed here is called the 
neoclassical theory of distribution. According to the neoclassical theory, the amount 
paid to each factor of production depends on the supply and demand for that 
factor. The demand, in turn, depends on that particular factor’s marginal produc-
tivity. In equilibrium, each factor of production earns the value of its marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services.
The neoclassical theory of distribution is widely accepted. Most economists 
begin with the neoclassical theory when trying to explain how the U.S. econo-
my’s $16 trillion of income is distributed among the economy’s various members. 
In the following two chapters, we consider the distribution of income in more 
detail. As you will see, the neoclassical theory provides the framework for this 
discussion.
Even at this point, you can use the theory to answer the question that  began 
this chapter: Why are computer programmers paid more than gas station at-
tendants? It is because programmers can produce a good of greater market 
value than can gas station attendants. People are willing to pay dearly for 
a good computer game, but they are willing to pay little to have their gas 
pumped and their windshield washed. The wages of these workers reflect the 
market prices of the goods they produce. If people suddenly got tired of using 
computers and decided to spend more time driving, the prices of these goods 
would change, and so would the equilibrium wages of these two groups of 
workers.

income is paid to workers, as opposed to owners of 
capital and land?

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
• The economy’s income is distributed in the mar-
kets for the factors of production. The three most 
important factors of production are labor, land, and 
capital.
• The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived 
 demand that comes from firms that use the factors 
to produce goods and services. Competitive, profit- 
maximizing firms hire each factor up to the point 
at which the value of the factor’s marginal product 
equals its price.
• The supply of labor arises from individuals’ trade-
off between work and leisure. An upward-sloping 
labor-supply curve means that people respond to 
an increase in the wage by working more hours and 
 enjoying less leisure. 
• The price paid to each factor adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for that factor. Because factor 
demand reflects the value of the marginal product of 
that factor, in equilibrium each factor is compensated 
according to its marginal contribution to the produc-
tion of goods and services.
• Because factors of production are used together, the 
marginal product of any one factor depends on the 
quantities of all factors that are available. As a result, 
a change in the supply of one factor alters the equilib-
rium earnings of all the factors.

d. How many robots should the firm rent?  
Explain.
5. The nation of Ectenia has 20 competitive apple or-
chards, all of which sell apples at the world price of 
$2 per apple. The following equations describe the 
production function and the marginal product of labor 
in each orchard:
Q 5 100L 2 L2
MPL 5 100 2 2L,
 
 where Q is the number of apples produced in a day, 
L is the number of workers, and MPL is the marginal 
product of labor.
a. What is each orchard’s labor demand as a function 
of the daily wage W? What is the market’s labor 
demand?
b. Ectenia has 200 workers who supply their labor 
inelastically. Solve for the wage W. How many 
workers does each orchard hire? How much profit 
does each orchard owner make?
c. Calculate what happens to the income of workers 
and orchard owners if the world price doubles to 
$4 per apple.
d. Now suppose the price is back at $2 per apple, 
but a hurricane destroys half the orchards. Calcu-
late how the hurricane affects the income of each 
worker and of each remaining orchard owner. 
What happens to the income of Ectenia as a 
whole?

CHAPTER 18   THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
6. Your enterprising uncle opens a sandwich shop that 
employs 7 people. The employees are paid $12 per hour, 
and a sandwich sells for $6. If your uncle is maximizing 
his profit, what is the value of the marginal product of 
the last worker he hired? What is that worker’s mar-
ginal product?
7. Leadbelly Co. sells pencils in a perfectly competitive 
product market and hires workers in a perfectly compet-
itive labor market. Assume that the market wage rate for 
workers is $150 per day.
a. What rule should Leadbelly follow to hire the 
 profit-maximizing amount of labor?
b. At the profit-maximizing level of output, the mar-
ginal product of the last worker hired is 30 boxes 
of pencils per day. Calculate the price of a box of 
pencils.
c. Draw a diagram of the labor market for pencil work-
ers (as in Figure 4 of this chapter) next to a diagram 
of the labor supply and demand for Leadbelly Co. (as 
in Figure 3). Label the equilibrium wage and quantity 
of labor for both the market and the firm. How are 
these diagrams related?
d. Suppose some pencil workers switch to jobs in the 
growing computer industry. On the side-by-side 
 diagrams from part (c), show how this change  
affects the equilibrium wage and quantity of labor 
for both the pencil market and for Leadbelly. How 
does this change affect the marginal product of labor 
at Leadbelly?
8. Policymakers sometimes propose laws requiring firms to 
give workers certain fringe benefits, such as health insur-
ance or paid parental leave. Let’s consider the effects of 
such a policy on the labor market.
a. Suppose that a law required firms to give each 
worker $3 of fringe benefits for every hour that the 
worker is employed by the firm. How does this law 
affect the marginal profit that a firm earns from each 
worker at a given cash wage? How does the law 
 affect the demand curve for labor? Draw your  answer 
on a graph with the cash wage on the vertical axis.
b. If there is no change in labor supply, how would this 
law affect employment and wages?
c. Why might the labor-supply curve shift in  response to 
this law? Would this shift in labor supply raise or lower 
the impact of the law on wages and employment?
d. As discussed in Chapter 6, the wages of some work-
ers, particularly the unskilled and inexperienced, are 
kept above the equilibrium level by minimum-wage 
laws. What effect would a fringe-benefit mandate 
have for these workers? 
9. Some economists believe that the U.S. economy as a 
whole can be modeled with the following production 
function, called the Cobb–Douglas production function:
Y 5 AK1/3L2/3,
 
 where Y is the amount of output, K is the amount of 
capital, L is the amount of labor, and A is a parameter 
that measures the state of technology. For this production 
function, the marginal product of labor is
MPL 5 (2/3) A(K/L)1/3.
 
 Suppose that the price of output P is 2, A is 3, K is 
1,000,000, and L is 1,000. The labor market is competitive, 
so labor is paid the value of its marginal product.
a. Calculate the amount of output produced Y and the 
dollar value of output PY.
b. Calculate the wage W and the real wage W/P. (Note: 
The wage is labor compensation measured in dol-
lars, whereas the real wage is labor compensation 
 measured in units of output.)
c. Calculate the labor share (the fraction of the value of 
output that is paid to labor), which is (WL)/(PY).
d. Calculate what happens to output Y, the wage W, 
the real wage W/P, and the labor share (WL)/(PY) in 
each of the following scenarios:
 
  i. Inflation increases P from 2 to 3.
 
 ii. Technological progress increases A from 3 to 9.
 
iii.  Capital accumulation increases K from 1,000,000 
to 8,000,000.
 
 iv. A plague decreases L from 1,000 to 125.
e. Despite many changes in the U.S. economy over 
time, the labor share has been relatively stable. Is 
this observation consistent with the Cobb–Douglas 
 production function? Explain.

n the United States today, the typical physician earns about $200,000 a year, the 
typical police officer about $60,000, and the typical fast-food cook about $20,000. 
These examples illustrate the large differences in earnings in our economy. 
These differences explain why some people live in mansions, ride in limousines, 
and vacation on the French Riviera, while other people live in small apartments, 
ride the bus, and vacation in their own backyards.
Why do earnings vary so much from person to person? Chapter 18, which  
developed the basic neoclassical theory of the labor market, offers an answer to 
this question. There we saw that wages are governed by labor supply and labor 
demand. Labor demand, in turn, reflects the marginal productivity of labor. 
In equilibrium, each worker is paid the value of her marginal 
contribution to the economy’s production of goods and 
services.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
This theory of the labor market, though widely accepted by economists, is only 
the beginning of the story. To understand the wide variation in earnings that we 
observe, we must go beyond this general framework and examine more precisely 
what determines the supply and demand for different types of labor. That is our 
goal in this chapter. 
19-1 Some Determinants of Equilibrium Wages
Workers differ from one another in many ways, as do jobs. In this section, we 
consider how the characteristics of workers and jobs affect labor supply, labor 
 demand, and equilibrium wages. 
19-1a Compensating Differentials
When a worker is deciding whether to take a job, the wage is only one of many 
job attributes that the worker takes into account. Some jobs are easy, fun, and safe, 
while others are hard, dull, and dangerous. The better the job as gauged by these 
nonmonetary characteristics, the more people there are who are willing to do the 
job at any given wage. In other words, the supply of labor for easy, fun, and safe 
jobs is greater than the supply of labor for hard, dull, and dangerous jobs. As a 
result, “good” jobs will tend to have lower equilibrium wages than “bad” ones. 
For example, imagine you are looking for a summer job in a local beach com-
munity. Two kinds of jobs are available. You can take a job as a beach-badge 
checker, or you can take a job as a garbage collector. The beach-badge checkers 
take leisurely strolls along the beach during the day and check to make sure the 
tourists have bought the required beach permits. The garbage collectors wake up 
before dawn to drive dirty, noisy trucks around town to pick up garbage. Which 
job would you want? If the two jobs paid the same wage, most people would 
prefer the badge-checker job. To induce people to become garbage collectors, the 
town has to offer higher wages to garbage collectors than to beach-badge checkers. 
Economists use the term compensating differential to refer to a difference in 
wages that arises from nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs. Compensat-
ing differentials are prevalent in the economy. Here are some examples:
• Coal miners are paid more than other workers with similar levels of educa-
tion. Their higher wage compensates them for the dirty and dangerous  
nature of coal mining, as well as the long-term health problems that coal 
miners experience. 
• Workers who work the night shift at factories are paid more than similar 
workers who work the day shift. The higher wage compensates them for 
having to work at night and sleep during the day, a lifestyle that most people 
find undesirable.
• Professors are paid less than lawyers and doctors, who have similar amounts 
of education. The higher wages of lawyers and doctors compensate them for 
missing out on the great intellectual and personal satisfaction that professors’ 
jobs offer. (Indeed, teaching economics is so much fun that it is surprising 
economics professors are paid anything at all!)

CHAPTER 19   EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
19-1b Human Capital
As we discussed in the previous chapter, the word capital usually refers to an econ-
omy’s stock of equipment and structures. The capital stock includes the farmer’s 
tractor, the manufacturer’s factory, and the teacher’s chalkboard. The essence of 
capital is that it is a factor of production that itself has been produced.
There is another type of capital that, while less tangible than physical capital, 
is just as important to the economy’s production. Human capital is the accumula-
tion of investments in people. The most important type of human capital is edu-
cation. Like all forms of capital, education represents an expenditure of resources 
at one time to raise productivity in the future. But unlike an investment in other 
forms of capital, an investment in education is tied to a specific person, and this 
linkage is what makes it human capital.
Not surprisingly, workers with more human capital earn more on average than 
those with less human capital. College graduates in the United States, for exam-
ple, earn almost twice as much as those with only a high school diploma. This 
large difference has been documented in many countries around the world. It 
tends to be even larger in less developed countries, where educated workers are 
in scarce supply.
From the perspective of supply and demand it is easy to see why educa-
tion raises wages. Firms—the demanders of labor—are willing to pay more for 
highly educated workers because these workers have higher marginal products. 
 Workers—the suppliers of labor—are willing to pay the cost of becoming edu-
cated only if there is a reward for doing so. In essence, the difference in wages 
between highly educated workers and less educated workers may be considered 
a compensating differential for the cost of becoming educated.

CASE 
STUDY
THE INCREASING VALUE OF SKILLS
“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.” Like many adages, this 
one is not always true, but it has been in recent years. Many studies 
have documented that the earnings gap between workers with high 
skills and workers with low skills has increased over the past several 
decades.
Table 1 presents data on the average earnings of college graduates and of high 
school graduates without any additional education. These data show the increase 
in the financial reward from education. In 1974, a man on average earned 42 per-
cent more with a college degree than without one; by 2014, this figure had risen to 
81 percent. For a woman, the reward for attending college rose from a 35 percent 
increase in earnings in 1974 to a 71 percent increase in 2014. The incentive to stay in 
school is as great today as it has ever been.
Why has the gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers widened in 
recent years? No one knows for sure, but economists have proposed two hypothe-
ses to explain this trend. Both hypotheses suggest that the demand for skilled labor 
has risen over time relative to the demand for unskilled labor. The shift in demand 
has led to a corresponding change in the wages of both groups, which in turn has 
led to greater inequality.

386
PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
The first hypothesis is that international trade has altered the relative demand 
for skilled and unskilled labor. In recent years, the amount of trade with other 
countries has increased substantially. As a percentage of total U.S. production of 
goods and services, imports have risen from 8 percent in 1974 to 17 percent in 
2014, and exports have risen from 8 percent in 1974 to 14 percent in 2014. Because 
 unskilled labor is plentiful and cheap in many foreign countries, 
the United States tends to import goods produced with unskilled 
labor and export goods produced with skilled labor. Thus, when 
international trade expands, the domestic demand for skilled 
labor rises and the domestic demand for unskilled labor falls.
The second hypothesis is that changes in technology have 
 altered the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor. 
Consider, for instance, the introduction of computers. Comput-
ers raise the demand for the skilled workers who can use them 
and reduce the demand for the unskilled workers whose jobs 
are replaced by them. For example, many companies now rely 
more on computer databases, and less on filing cabinets, to keep 
business records. This change raises the demand for computer 
programmers and reduces the demand for filing clerks. Thus, as 
more firms use computers, the demand for skilled labor rises and 
the demand for unskilled labor falls. Economists call this phe-
nomenon skill-biased technological change.
Economists debate the importance of trade, technology, 
and other forces on the changing distribution of wages. There 
is likely not a single answer as to why income inequality has 
increased. Increasing international trade and skill-biased techno-
logical change may share responsibility for the changes we have 
observed in recent decades. In the next chapter, we discuss the 
issue of increasing inequality in more detail. ●

CHAPTER 19   EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
An economist makes the case for  
increased spending. 
Throw More Money  
at Education
By Noah Smith 
I
t’s become almost conventional wisdom that 
throwing more money at public education 
doesn’t produce results. But what if conven-
tional wisdom is wrong?
A new paper from economists C. Kirabo 
Jackson, Rucker Johnson and Claudia Per-
sico suggests that it is. To disentangle cor-
relation from causation, they look at periods 
from 1955 through 1985 when courts ordered 
governments to spend more on schools, from 
kindergarten through 12th grade. They then 
track how students in those areas did, up 
through 2011. The result is a very detailed 
long-term picture of the effect of spending 
more money on education.
The economists find that spending works. 
Specifically, they find that a 10 percent  
increase in spending, on average, leads chil-
dren to complete 0.27 more years of school, 
to make wages that are 7.25 percent higher 
and to have a substantially reduced chance 
of falling into poverty. These are long-term, 
durable results. Conclusion: throwing money 
at the problem works.
Here’s the hitch: The authors find that 
the benefits of increased spending are much 
stronger for poor kids than for wealthier ones. 
So if you, like me, are in the upper portion of 
the U.S. income distribution, you may be read-
ing this and thinking: “Why should I be paying 
more for some poor kid to be educated?” After 
all, why should one person pay the cost while 
another reaps the benefits?
Well, let me try to answer that. There are 
several good reasons.
First, if you’re an upper-income American, 
you probably do derive some direct benefit. When 
poor Americans become better workers, it doesn’t 
just boost their wages. It also boosts the profit-
ability of the companies where they work. If you 
own stock in such a company (and I hope you do), 
the value of those shares will go up if American 
worker productivity increases.
There might be even bigger, though less 
direct, effects from having a more-educated 
populace. The more industries can use U.S. 
workers instead of Chinese workers, the more 
industries will base their production in the U.S. 
This will feed local economies, boosting the 
profits of stores and other service businesses. 
That also feeds into your stock portfolio.
If you own your own business, you might 
need to hire some low-income people. If 
those people are better readers, better at  
doing simple math, more efficient at everyday 
tasks, and just more productive in general, 
that cuts down on the time and money you 
need to spend fixing their mistakes.
Next, having more educated poor people 
makes for a better civil society. Suppose you live 
in, say, Chicago, or some other city that hasn’t 
enjoyed as big a drop in crime as New York or 
Los Angeles. I bet you don’t enjoy having to worry 
about driving or walking through unsafe neigh-
borhoods. I also bet you would like to walk around 
downtown without fear of getting mugged. It 
might also be nice not to have to live behind the 
isolating walls of a gated community.
One way to reduce crime, of course, is to pay 
for more police and increase incarceration rates. 
But another way is to improve education. Econ-
omists Lance Lochner and Enrico Moretti found 
in 2003 that education decreases crime. An ed-
ucated populace is a well-socialized populace. 
There is also the fact that better education leads 
to higher wages for poor people, reducing the in-
centive for them to engage in crime.
At the risk of sounding grandiose, let 
me go even further: Education is really the 
difference between a cohesive society and a 
collection of people who happen to live next 
to each other. This was understood well by 
Fukuzawa Yukichi, Japan’s version of Ben 
Franklin. After Japan opened up to the West 
in the mid-1800s, Fukuzawa volunteered for 
Japan’s first diplomatic mission to the U.S. He 
returned convinced that universal education 
was the key to transforming Japan into the 
equal of the Western nations. His ideas were 
influential, and Japan to this day has one of 
the world’s best education systems.
Detractors of our public education system 
point out that the U.S. already spends as much 
on public education as many other developed 
countries—5.5 percent of gross domestic 
product, compared with only 3.5 percent in 
 Japan, 4.9 percent in Canada, 5 percent in 
South Korea and 5.9 percent in Finland. Many 
view increased education spending as a give-
away to powerful and greedy teachers’ unions.
But maybe the U.S. spends more because it 
needs to spend more. The U.S. has more inequal-
ity and more poor people than those countries. 
Just as some countries naturally need to spend 
more on health care than others, the U.S. might 
naturally need more education spending.
The argument for more education spending, 
of course, isn’t at odds with the need to make 
our schools more efficient. Education-reform 
movements such as charter schools—which 
are also effective mainly for poor kids—don’t 
clash with the idea of higher spending. We can 
do both, and each may help the other.
So this is one problem the U.S. really 
should consider throwing more money at. ■

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
19-1c Ability, Effort, and Chance
Why do major league baseball players get paid more than minor league players? 
Certainly, the higher wage is not a compensating differential. Playing in the major 
leagues is not a less pleasant job than playing in the minor leagues; in fact, the 
opposite is true. The major leagues do not require more years of schooling or more 
experience. To a large extent, players in the major leagues earn more because they 
have greater natural ability. 
Natural ability is important for workers in all occupations. Because of heredity 
and upbringing, people differ in their physical and mental attributes. Some peo-
ple are strong, others weak. Some people are smart, others less so. Some people 
are outgoing, others awkward in social situations. These and many other personal 
characteristics determine how productive workers are and, therefore, play a role 
in determining the wages they earn.
Closely related to ability is effort. Some people work hard; others are lazy. We 
should not be surprised to find that those who work hard are more productive 
and earn higher wages. To some extent, firms reward hard work directly by pay-
ing people based on what they produce. Salespeople, for instance, are often paid 
a percentage of the sales they make. At other times, hard work is rewarded less 
directly in the form of a higher annual salary or a bonus.
Chance also plays a role in determining wages. If a person attended a trade 
school to learn how to repair televisions with vacuum tubes and then found this 
skill made obsolete by the invention of solid-state electronics, she would end up 
earning a low wage compared to others with similar years of training. The low 
wage of this worker is due to chance—a phenomenon that economists recognize 
but do not shed much light on.
How important are ability, effort, and chance in determining wages? It is hard 
to say because these factors are difficult to measure. But indirect evidence sug-
gests that they are very important. When labor economists study wages, they 
relate a worker’s wage to those variables that can be measured, such as years of 
schooling, years of experience, age, and job characteristics. All of these measured 
variables affect a worker’s wage as theory predicts, but they account for less than 
half of the variation in wages in our economy. Because so much of the variation 
in wages is left unexplained, omitted variables—including ability, effort, and 
chance— must play an important role.
CASE 
STUDY
THE BENEFITS OF BEAUTY 
People differ in many ways, one of which is physical attractiveness. 
The actress Emma Stone, for instance, is a beautiful woman. In part 
for this reason, her movies attract large audiences. Not surprisingly, 
the large audiences mean a large income for Ms. Stone.
How prevalent are the economic benefits of beauty? Labor economists Daniel 
Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle tried to answer this question in a study published in 
the December 1994 issue of the American Economic Review. Hamermesh and Biddle 
examined data from surveys of individuals in the United States and Canada. The 
interviewers who conducted the survey were asked to rate each respondent’s phys-
ical appearance. Hamermesh and Biddle then examined how much the wages of 
the respondents depended on the standard determinants—education, experience, 
and so on—and how much they depended on physical appearance.

CHAPTER 19   EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
Hamermesh and Biddle found that beauty pays. People who are deemed more 
attractive than average earn 5 percent more than people of average looks, and peo-
ple of average looks earn 5 to 10 percent more than people considered less attrac-
tive than average. Similar results were found for men and women.
What explains these differences in wages? There are several ways to interpret 
the “beauty premium.”
One interpretation is that good looks are a type of innate ability determining 
productivity and wages. Some people are born with the physical attributes of a 
movie star; other people are not. Good looks are useful in any job in which work-
ers present themselves to the public—such as acting, sales, and waiting on tables. 
In this case, an attractive worker is more valuable to the firm than an unattractive 
worker. The firm’s willingness to pay more to attractive workers reflects its custom-
ers’ preferences.
A second interpretation is that reported beauty is an indirect measure of other 
types of ability. How attractive a person appears depends on more than just  
heredity. It also depends on dress, hairstyle, personal demeanor, and other attri-
butes that a person can control. Perhaps a person who successfully projects an 
 attractive image in a survey interview is more likely to be an intelligent person who 
succeeds at other tasks as well.
A third interpretation is that the beauty premium is a type of discrimination, a 
topic to which we return later. ●
19-1d An Alternative View of Education: Signaling
Earlier we discussed the human-capital view of education, according to which 
schooling raises workers’ wages because it makes them more productive. 
 Although this view is widely accepted, some economists have proposed an alter-
native theory, which emphasizes that firms use educational attainment as a way 
of sorting between high-ability and low-ability workers. According to this alter-
native view, when people earn a college degree, for instance, they do not become 
more productive, but they do signal their high ability to prospective employers. 
Because it is easier for high-ability people to earn a college degree than it is for 
low-ability people, more high-ability people get college degrees. As a result, it is 
rational for firms to interpret a college degree as a signal of ability.
The signaling theory of education is similar to the signaling theory of adver-
tising discussed in Chapter 16. In the signaling theory of advertising, the adver-
tisement itself contains no real information, but the firm signals the quality of its 
product to consumers by its willingness to spend money on advertising. In the 
signaling theory of education, schooling has no real productivity benefit, but the 
worker signals her innate productivity to employers by her willingness to spend 
years at school. In both cases, an action is being taken not for its intrinsic bene-
fit but because the willingness to take that action conveys private information to 
someone observing it.
Thus, we now have two views of education: the human-capital theory and 
the signaling theory. Both views can explain why more educated workers tend 
to earn more than less educated ones. According to the human-capital view, 
 education makes workers more productive; according to the signaling view, edu-
cation is correlated with natural ability. But the two views have radically different 
predictions for the effects of policies that aim to increase educational attainment. 
 According to the human-capital view, increasing educational levels for all work-
ers would raise all workers’ productivity and thereby their wages. According to 
Good looks pay.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
the signaling view, education does not enhance productivity, so raising all work-
ers’ educational levels would not affect wages. 
Most likely, the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. The bene-
fits of education are probably a combination of the productivity-enhancing effects 
of human capital and the productivity-revealing effects of signaling. The relative 
size of these two effects is an open question.
19-1e The Superstar Phenomenon
Although most actors earn little and often take jobs as waiters to support them-
selves, Robert Downey, Jr., earns millions of dollars for each film he makes. Simi-
larly, while most people who play tennis do it as a hobby, Maria Sharapova earns 
millions on the pro tour. Downey and Sharapova are superstars in their fields, 
and their great public appeal is reflected in astronomical incomes.
Why do Downey and Sharapova earn so much? It is not surprising that in-
comes differ within occupations. Good carpenters earn more than mediocre car-
penters, and good plumbers earn more than mediocre plumbers. People vary in 
ability and effort, and these differences lead to differences in income. Yet the best 
carpenters and plumbers do not earn the many millions that are common among 
the best actors and athletes. What explains the difference?
To understand the tremendous incomes of Downey and Sharapova, we must 
examine the special features of the markets in which they sell their services.  
Superstars arise in markets that have two characteristics:
• Every customer in the market wants to enjoy the good supplied by the best 
producer. 
• The good is produced with a technology that makes it possible for the best 
producer to supply every customer at low cost.
If Robert Downey, Jr., is the best actor around, then everyone will want to see his 
next movie; seeing twice as many movies by an actor half as talented is not a good 
substitute. Moreover, it is possible for everyone to enjoy a performance by  Robert 
Downey, Jr. Because it is easy to make multiple copies of a film, Downey can pro-
vide his service to millions of people simultaneously. Similarly, because tennis 
matches are broadcast on television, millions of fans can enjoy the extraordinary 
athletic skills of Maria Sharapova.
We can now see why there are no superstar carpenters and plumbers. Other 
things being equal, everyone prefers to employ the best carpenter, but a carpenter, 
unlike a movie actor, can provide her services to only a limited number of cus-
tomers. Although the best carpenter will be able to command a somewhat higher 
wage than the average carpenter, the average carpenter will still be able to earn a 
good living.
19-1f  Above-Equilibrium Wages: Minimum-Wage Laws, Unions, 
and Efficiency Wages
Most analyses of wage differences among workers are based on the equilibrium 
model of the labor market—that is, wages are assumed to adjust to balance labor 
supply and labor demand. But this assumption does not always apply. For some 
workers, wages are set above the level that brings supply and demand into equi-
librium. Let’s consider three reasons this might be so.

391
CHAPTER 19   EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
One reason for above-equilibrium wages is minimum-wage laws, as we first 
saw in Chapter 6. Most workers in the economy are not affected by these laws 
because their equilibrium wages are well above the legal minimum. But for some 
workers, especially the least skilled and experienced, minimum-wage laws raise 
wages above the level they would earn in an unregulated labor market.
A second reason that wages might rise above their equilibrium level is the mar-
ket power of labor unions. A union is a worker association that bargains with 
employers over wages and working conditions. Unions often raise wages above 
the level that would prevail in their absence, perhaps because they can threaten to 
withhold labor from the firm by calling a strike. Studies suggest that union work-
ers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar, nonunion workers.
A third reason for above-equilibrium wages is based on the theory of efficiency 
wages. This theory holds that a firm can find it profitable to pay high wages 
 because doing so increases the productivity of its workers. In particular, high 
wages may reduce worker turnover, increase worker effort, and raise the quality 
of workers who apply for jobs at the firm. If this theory is correct, then some firms 
may choose to pay their workers more than they would normally earn.
Above-equilibrium wages, whether caused by minimum-wage laws, unions, 
or efficiency wages, have similar effects on the labor market. In particular, push-
ing a wage above the equilibrium level raises the quantity of labor supplied and 
reduces the quantity of labor demanded. The result is a surplus of labor, or un-
employment. The study of unemployment and the public policies aimed to deal 
with it is usually considered a topic within macroeconomics, so it goes beyond the 
scope of this chapter. But it would be a mistake to ignore these issues completely 
when analyzing earnings. Although most wage differences can be understood 
while maintaining the assumption of equilibrium in the labor market, above-equi-
librium wages play a role in some cases.

why more educated workers earn more than less educated workers.
19-2 The Economics of Discrimination
Another source of differences in wages is discrimination. Discrimination occurs 
when the marketplace offers different opportunities to similar individuals who 
differ only by race, ethnic group, sex, age, or other personal characteristics. Dis-
crimination reflects some people’s prejudice against certain groups in society. Dis-
crimination is an emotionally charged topic that often generates heated debate, 
but economists try to study the topic objectively to separate myth from reality.
19-2a Measuring Labor-Market Discrimination
How much does discrimination in labor markets affect the earnings of different 
groups of workers? This question is important, but answering it is not easy.
There is no doubt that different groups of workers earn substantially different 
wages, as Table 2 demonstrates. The median black man in the United States is 
paid 20 percent less than the median white man, and the median black woman 
is paid 17 percent less than the median white woman. The differences by sex are 
also significant. The median white woman is paid 21 percent less than the median 
white man, and the median black woman is paid 18 percent less than the median

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
black man. Taken at face value, these differentials look like evidence that employ-
ers discriminate against blacks and women.
Yet there is a potential problem with this inference. Even in a labor market 
free of discrimination, different people have different wages. People differ in 
the amount of human capital they have and in the kinds of work they are able 
and willing to do. The wage differences we observe in an economy are, to some 
extent, attributable to the determinants of equilibrium wages we discussed in 
the preceding section. Simply observing differences in wages among broad 
groups—whites and blacks, men and women—does not prove that employers 
discriminate.
Consider, for example, the role of human capital. In 2014, among men aged 
25 and older, 32 percent of the white population had a college degree, compared 
with 20 percent of the black population. Among women aged 25 and older, 32 
percent of the white population had a college degree, compared with 24 percent 
of the black population. Thus, at least some of the difference between the wages 
of whites and the wages of blacks can be traced to differences in educational 
attainment.
Moreover, human capital may be more important in explaining wage differ-
entials than years of schooling suggest. Historically, public schools in predomi-
nantly black areas have been of lower quality—as measured by expenditure, class 
size, and so on—than public schools in predominantly white areas. If we could 
measure the quality as well as the quantity of education, the differences in human 
capital among these groups would appear even larger.
Human capital acquired in the form of job experience can also help explain 
wage differences. In particular, women are more likely to interrupt their careers to 
raise children. Among the population aged 25 to 44 (when many people have chil-
dren at home), only about 75 percent of women are in the labor force, compared 
to about 90 percent of men. As a result, female workers, especially at older ages, 
tend to have less job experience than male workers. 
Yet another source of wage differences is compensating differentials. Men 
and women do not always choose the same type of work, and this fact may help 
 explain some of the earnings differential between men and women. For exam-
ple, women are more likely to be secretaries, and men are more likely to be truck

drivers. The relative wages of secretaries and truck drivers depend in part on the 
working conditions of each job. Because these nonmonetary aspects are hard to 
measure, it is difficult to gauge the practical importance of compensating differen-
tials in explaining the wage differences that we observe. 
In the end, the study of wage differences among groups does not establish any 
clear conclusion about the prevalence of discrimination in U.S. labor markets. 
Most economists believe that some of the observed wage differentials are attribut-
able to discrimination, but there is no consensus about how much. The only con-
clusion about which economists are in consensus is a negative one: Because the 
differences in average wages among groups in part reflect differences in human 
capital and job characteristics, they do not by themselves say anything about how 
much discrimination there is in the labor market. 
Of course, differences in human capital among groups of workers may also 
reflect a kind of discrimination. The less rigorous curriculums historically offered 
to female students, for instance, can be considered a discriminatory practice. Sim-
ilarly, the inferior schools historically available to black students may be traced to 
prejudice on the part of city councils and school boards. But this kind of discrim-
ination occurs long before the worker enters the labor market. In this case, the 
disease is political, even if the symptom is economic.
CASE 
STUDY
IS EMILY MORE EMPLOYABLE THAN LAKISHA?
Although measuring the extent of discrimination from labor- market 
outcomes is hard, some compelling evidence for the existence of 
such discrimination comes from a creative “field experiment.” Econ-
omists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan answered more 
than 1,300 help-wanted ads run in Boston and Chicago newspapers by sending 
in nearly 5,000 fake résumés. Half of the résumés had names that were common 
in the African-American community, such as Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones. 
The other half had names that were more common among the white popula-
tion, such as Emily Walsh and Greg Baker. Otherwise, the résumés were similar. 
The results of this experiment were published in the American Economic Review in  
September 2004. 
The researchers found large differences in how employers responded to the 
two groups of résumés. Job applicants with white names received about 50 per-
cent more calls from interested employers than applicants with African-American 
names. The study found that this discrimination occurred for all types of employ-
ers, including those who claimed to be an “Equal Opportunity Employer” in their 
help-wanted ads. The researchers concluded that “racial discrimination is still a 
prominent feature of the labor market.” ●
19-2b Discrimination by Employers
Let’s now turn from measurement to the economic forces that lie behind dis-
crimination in labor markets. If one group in society receives a lower wage than  
another group, even after controlling for human capital and job characteristics, 
who is to blame for this differential?
The answer is not obvious. It might seem natural to blame employers for dis-
criminatory wage differences. After all, employers make the hiring decisions that 
determine labor demand and wages. If some groups of workers earn lower wages 
than they should, then it seems that employers are responsible. Yet many econ-
omists are skeptical of this easy answer. They believe that competitive, market

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
economies provide a natural antidote to employer discrimination. That antidote is 
called the profit motive.
Imagine an economy in which workers are differentiated by their hair color. 
Blondes and brunettes have the same skills, experience, and work ethic. Yet 
 because of discrimination, employers prefer to hire workers with brunette hair. 
Thus, the demand for blondes is lower than it otherwise would be. As a result, 
blondes earn a lower wage than brunettes. 
How long can this wage differential persist? In this economy, there is an easy 
way for a firm to beat out its competitors: It can hire blonde workers. By hiring 
blondes, a firm pays lower wages and thus has lower costs than firms that hire 
brunettes. Over time, more and more “blonde” firms enter the market to take 
 advantage of this cost advantage. The existing “brunette” firms have higher costs 
and, therefore, begin to lose money when faced with the new competitors. These 
losses induce the brunette firms to go out of business. Eventually, the entry of 
blonde firms and the exit of brunette firms cause the demand for blonde workers 
to rise and the demand for brunette workers to fall. This process continues until 
the wage differential disappears. 
Put simply, business owners who care only about making money are at an 
 advantage when competing against those who also care about discriminating. As 
a result, firms that do not discriminate tend to replace those that do. In this way, 
competitive markets have a natural remedy for employer discrimination.
CASE 
STUDY
SEGREGATED STREETCARS AND THE PROFIT MOTIVE
In the early 20th century, streetcars in many southern cities were seg-
regated by race. White passengers sat in the front of the streetcars, 
and black passengers sat in the back. What do you suppose caused 
and maintained this discriminatory practice? And how was this prac-
tice viewed by the firms that ran the streetcars?
In a 1986 article in the Journal of Economic History, economic historian Jennifer 
Roback looked at these questions. Roback found that the segregation of races on 
streetcars was the result of laws that required such segregation. Before these laws 
were passed, racial discrimination in seating was rare. It was far more common to 
segregate smokers and nonsmokers. 
Moreover, the firms that ran the streetcars often opposed the laws requiring 
racial segregation. Providing separate seating for different races raised the firms’ 
costs and reduced their profits. One railroad company manager complained to the 
city council that, under the segregation laws, “the company has to haul around a 
good deal of empty space.”
Here is how Roback describes the situation in one southern city:
The railroad company did not initiate the segregation policy and was not at all 
eager to abide by it. State legislation, public agitation, and a threat to arrest the 
president of the railroad were all required to induce them to separate the races 
on their cars. . . . There is no indication that the management was motivated 
by belief in civil rights or racial equality. The evidence indicates their primary 
 motives were economic; separation was costly. . . . Officials of the company 
may or may not have disliked blacks, but they were not willing to forgo the 
profits necessary to indulge such prejudice.

CHAPTER 19   EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
The story of southern streetcars illustrates a general lesson: Business owners 
are usually more interested in making profits than in discriminating against a par-
ticular group. When firms engage in discriminatory practices, the ultimate source 
of the discrimination often lies not with the firms themselves but elsewhere. In 
this particular case, the streetcar companies segregated whites and blacks because 
discriminatory laws, which the companies opposed, required them to do so. ●
19-2c Discrimination by Customers and Governments 
The profit motive is a strong force acting to eliminate discriminatory wage dif-
ferentials, but there are limits to its corrective abilities. Two important limiting 
factors are customer preferences and government policies.
 To see how customer preferences for discrimination can affect wages, con-
sider again our imaginary economy with blondes and brunettes. Suppose that 
restaurant owners discriminate against blondes when hiring waiters. As a result, 
blonde waiters earn lower wages than brunette waiters. In this case, a restaurant 
can open up with blonde waiters and charge lower prices. If customers care only 
about the quality and price of their meals, the discriminatory firms will be driven 
out of business, and the wage differential will disappear.
On the other hand, it is possible that customers prefer being served by brunette 
waiters. If this discriminatory preference is strong, the entry of blonde restau-
rants need not succeed in eliminating the wage differential between brunettes 
and blondes. That is, if customers have discriminatory preferences, a competitive 
market is consistent with a discriminatory wage differential. An economy with 
such discrimination would contain two types of restaurants. Blonde restaurants 
would hire blondes, have lower costs, and charge lower prices. Brunette restau-
rants would hire brunettes, have higher costs, and charge higher prices. Custom-
ers who did not care about the hair color of their waiters would be attracted to the 
lower prices at the blonde restaurants. Bigoted customers would go to the bru-
nette restaurants and would pay for their discriminatory preference in the form of 
higher prices.
Another way for discrimination to persist in competitive markets is for the 
government to mandate discriminatory practices. If, for instance, the government 
passed a law stating that blondes could wash dishes in restaurants but could not 
work as waiters, then a wage differential could persist in a competitive market. 
The example of segregated streetcars in the previous case study is one example of 
government-mandated discrimination. Similarly, before South Africa abandoned 
its formal policy of racial segregation called apartheid in 1990, blacks were pro-
hibited from working in some jobs. Discriminatory governments pass such laws 
to suppress the normal equalizing force of free and competitive markets. 
To sum up: Competitive markets contain a natural remedy for employer discrimina-
tion. The entry of firms that care only about profit tends to eliminate discriminatory wage 
differentials. These wage differentials persist in competitive markets only when customers 
are willing to pay to maintain the discriminatory practice or when the government man-
dates it.

DISCRIMINATION IN SPORTS
As we have seen, measuring discrimination is often difficult. To 
 determine whether one group of workers is discriminated against, a 
researcher must correct for differences in the productivity between 
that group and other workers in the economy. Yet in most firms, it is

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
difficult to measure a particular worker’s contribution to the production of goods 
and services.
One type of firm in which such measurements are easier is the sports team. 
Professional teams have many objective measures of productivity. In baseball, for 
 instance, we can measure a player’s batting average, the frequency of home runs, 
the number of stolen bases, and so on.
Studies of sports teams suggest that racial discrimination has, in fact, been com-
mon and that much of the blame lies with customers. One study, published in the 
Journal of Labor Economics in 1988, examined the salaries of basketball players and 
found that black players earned 20 percent less than white players of comparable 
ability. The study also found that attendance at basketball games was larger for 
teams with a greater proportion of white players. One interpretation of these facts 
is that, at least at the time of the study, customer discrimination made black players 
less profitable than white players for team owners. In the presence of such cus-
tomer discrimination, a discriminatory wage gap can persist, even if team owners 
care only about profit.
A similar situation once existed for baseball players. A study using data from 
the late 1960s showed that black players earned less than comparable white play-
ers. Moreover, fewer fans attended games pitched by blacks than games pitched by 
whites, even though black pitchers had better records than white pitchers. Studies 
of more recent salaries in baseball, however, have found no evidence of discrimina-
tory wage differentials.
Another study, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1990, examined 
the market prices of old baseball cards. This study found similar evidence of dis-
crimination. The cards of black hitters sold for 10 percent less than the cards of 
comparable white hitters, and the cards of black pitchers sold for 13 percent less 
than the cards of comparable white pitchers. These results suggest customer dis-
crimination among baseball fans. ●

19-3 Conclusion
In competitive markets, workers earn a wage equal to the value of their marginal 
contribution to the production of goods and services. There are, however, many 
things that affect the value of the marginal product. Firms pay more for work-
ers who are more talented, more diligent, more experienced, and more educated 
 because these workers are more productive. Firms pay less to those workers 
against whom customers discriminate because these workers contribute less to 
revenue. 
The theory of the labor market we have developed in the last two chapters 
 explains why some workers earn higher wages than other workers. The theory 
does not say that the resulting distribution of income is equal, fair, or desirable in 
any way. That is the topic we take up in Chapter 20.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
• Workers earn different wages for many reasons. One 
reason is that wage differentials play a role compen-
sating workers for job attributes. Other things being 
equal, workers in hard, unpleasant jobs are paid more 
than workers in easy, pleasant jobs.
• Workers with more human capital are paid more than 
workers with less human capital. The return to accu-
mulating human capital is high and has increased over 
the past several decades.
• Although years of education, experience, and job char-
acteristics affect earnings as theory predicts, much 
variation in earnings cannot be explained by things 
that economists can easily measure. The unexplained 
variation in earnings is largely attributable to natural 
ability, effort, and chance.
• Some economists have suggested that more educated 
workers earn higher wages not because education 
raises productivity but because workers with high nat-
ural ability use education as a way to signal their high 
ability to employers. If this signaling theory is correct, 
then increasing the educational attainment of all work-
ers would not raise the overall level of wages.
• Wages are sometimes pushed above the level that 
brings supply and demand into balance. Three 
 explanations of above-equilibrium wages are mini-
mum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages.
• Some differences in earnings are attributable to dis-
crimination based on race, sex, or other factors. Mea-
suring the amount of discrimination is difficult, 
however, because one must correct for differences in 
human capital and job characteristics.

adult workers.

positive influence on wages. Explain why this might 
occur.
4. At some colleges and universities, economics profes-
sors receive higher salaries than professors in some 
other fields.
a. Why might this be true?
• Competitive markets tend to limit the impact of dis-
crimination on wages. If the wages of a group of work-
ers are lower than those of another group for reasons 
not related to marginal productivity, then nondiscrim-
inatory firms will be more profitable than discrimina-
tory firms. Profit-maximizing behavior, therefore, can 
reduce discriminatory wage differentials. Discrimina-
tion persists in competitive markets, however, if cus-
tomers are willing to pay more to discriminatory firms 
or if the government passes laws requiring firms to 
discriminate.

CHAPTER 19   EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION
b. Some other colleges and universities have a policy 
of paying equal salaries to professors in all fields. 
At some of these schools, economics professors 
have lighter teaching loads than professors in 
some other fields. What role do the differences in 
teaching loads play?
5. Imagine that someone offered you a choice: You could 
spend four years studying at the world’s best uni-
versity, but you would have to keep your attendance 
there a secret. Or you could be awarded an official de-
gree from the world’s best university, but you couldn’t 
actually attend. Which choice do you think would 
enhance your future earnings more? What does your 
answer say about the debate over signaling versus hu-
man capital in the role of education?
6. When recording devices were first invented more than 
100 years ago, musicians could suddenly supply their 
music to large audiences at low cost. How do you 
suppose this development affected the income of the 
best musicians? How do you suppose it affected the 
income of average musicians?
7. A current debate in education is whether teachers 
should be paid on a standard pay scale based solely 
upon their years of training and teaching experience, 
or whether part of their salary should be based upon 
their performance (called “merit pay”).
a. Why might merit pay be desirable?
b. Who might be opposed to a system of merit pay?
c. What is a potential challenge of merit pay?
d. A related issue: Why might a school district de-
cide to pay teachers significantly more than the 
salaries offered by surrounding districts?
8. When Alan Greenspan (who would later become 
chairman of the Federal Reserve) ran an economic 
consulting firm in the 1960s, he primarily hired  
female economists. He once told the New York Times,  
“I always valued men and women equally, and I 
found that because others did not, good women 
economists were cheaper than men.” Is Greenspan’s 
behavior profit-maximizing? Is it admirable or despi-
cable? If more employers were like Greenspan, what 
would happen to the wage differential between men 
and women? Why might other economic consulting 
firms at the time not have followed Greenspan’s busi-
ness strategy?

Income Inequality  
and Poverty
CHAPTER
20
T
he great British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once summarized alter-
native economic systems as follows: “The inherent vice of capitalism is the 
unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of socialism is the equal 
sharing of miseries.” Churchill’s quip draws attention to two important facts. 
First, nations that use market mechanisms to allocate resources usually achieve 
greater prosperity than those that do not. This is the result of Adam Smith’s invis-
ible hand in action. Second, the prosperity that market economies produce is not 
shared equally. Incomes can differ greatly between those at the top and those at 
the bottom of the economic ladder. The gap between rich and poor is a fasci-
nating and important topic of study—for the comfortable rich, for 
the struggling poor, and for the aspiring and worried 
middle class.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
From the previous two chapters, you should have some understanding about 
why different people have different incomes. A person’s earnings depend on the 
supply and demand for that person’s labor, which in turn depend on natural abil-
ity, human capital, compensating differentials, discrimination, and so on. Because 
labor earnings make up about two-thirds of the total income in the U.S. economy, 
the factors that determine wages are also largely responsible for determining how 
the economy’s total income is distributed among the various members of society. 
In other words, they determine who is rich and who is poor. 
In this chapter, we discuss the distribution of income—a topic that raises some 
fundamental questions about the role of economic policy. One of the Ten Principles 
of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that governments can sometimes improve 
market outcomes. This possibility is particularly important when considering the 
distribution of income. The invisible hand of the marketplace allocates resources 
efficiently but does not necessarily allocate them fairly. As a result, many econo-
mists—though not all—believe that the government should redistribute income to 
achieve greater equality. In doing so, however, the government runs into another 
of the Ten Principles of Economics: People face trade-offs. When the government  
enacts policies to make the distribution of income more equal, it distorts incen-
tives, alters behavior, and makes the allocation of resources less efficient.
Our discussion of the distribution of income proceeds in three steps. First, we 
assess how much inequality there is in our society. Second, we consider some 
different views about the role that government should play in altering the dis-
tribution of income. Third, we discuss various public policies aimed at helping 
society’s poorest members. 
20-1 The Measurement of Inequality
We begin our study of the distribution of income by addressing four questions of 
measurement:
• How much inequality is there in our society? 
• How many people live in poverty? 
• What problems arise in measuring the amount of inequality?
• How often do people move between income classes?
These measurement questions are the natural starting point from which to  discuss 
public policies aimed at changing the distribution of income.
20-1a U.S. Income Inequality
Imagine that you lined up all the families in the economy according to their  annual 
income. Then you divided the families into five equal groups, called quintiles. 
Table 1 shows the income ranges for each quintile, as well as for the top 5 percent. 
You can use this table to find where your family lies in the income distribution. 
For examining differences in the income distribution over time, economists 
find it useful to present the income data as in Table 2. This table shows the share 
of total income that each group of families received in selected years. In 2014, the 
bottom quintile received 3.6 percent of all income and the top quintile received 
48.9 percent of all income. In other words, even though all the quintiles include 
the same number of families, the top quintile has more than thirteen times as 
much income as the bottom quintile.

CHAPTER 20   INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY 
The last column in the table shows the share of total income received by the 
very richest families. In 2014, the top 5 percent of families received 20.8 percent 
of all income, which was greater than the total income of the poorest 40 percent.
Table 2 also shows the distribution of income in various years beginning in 
1935. At first glance, the distribution of income appears to have been remarkably 
stable over time. Throughout the past several decades, the bottom quintile has 
received about 4 to 5 percent of income, while the top quintile has received about 
40 to 50 percent of income. Closer inspection of the table reveals some trends in 
the degree of inequality. From 1935 to 1970, the distribution gradually became 
more equal. The share of the bottom quintile rose from 4.1 to 5.4 percent, and 
the share of the top quintile fell from 51.7 to 40.9 percent. In more recent years, 
this trend has reversed itself. From 1970 to 2014, the share of the bottom quintile 
fell from 5.4 to 3.6 percent, and the share of the top quintile rose from 40.9 to 
48.9 percent. 
In Chapter 19, we discussed some explanations for this recent rise in inequality. 
Increases in international trade with low-wage countries and changes in technol-
ogy have tended to reduce the demand for unskilled labor and raise the demand 
for skilled labor. As a result, the wages of unskilled workers have fallen relative 
to the wages of skilled workers, and this change in relative wages has increased 
inequality in family incomes.

countries, data are not available. Even when they are, not every country collects 
data in the same way; for example, some countries collect data on individual 
incomes, whereas other countries collect data on family incomes, and still oth-
ers collect data on expenditure and use it as a crude measure of income. As a 
result, whenever we find a difference between two countries, we can never be 
sure whether it reflects a true difference in the economies or merely a difference in 
the way data are collected.
With this warning in mind, consider Figure 1, which compares inequality in 
twenty major countries. The inequality measure used here is the quintile ratio, 
which is the income of the richest quintile divided by the income of the poorest 
quintile. The most equality is found in Sweden, where the top quintile receives 3.7 
times as much income as the bottom quintile. The least equality is found in South 
Africa, where the top group receives 28.5 times as much income as the bottom 
group. All countries have significant disparities between rich and poor, but the 
degree of inequality varies substantially around the world.
When countries are ranked by inequality, the United States ends up with more 
inequality than the typical country. The United States has substantially greater 
income disparity than most other economically advanced countries, such as Japan 
and Germany. But it has a more equal income distribution than some developing 
countries, such as South Africa and Brazil. The United States has about the same 
degree of inequality as China, the world’s most populous nation.

CHAPTER 20   INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY 
Source: New York Times, July 20, 2014.
A global perspective reveals some good 
news about inequality.
Income Inequality Is Not Rising 
Globally. It’s Falling.
By Tyler Cowen
I
ncome inequality has surged as a political and 
economic issue, but the numbers don’t show 
that inequality is rising from a global perspec-
tive. Yes, the problem has become more acute 
within most individual nations, yet income 
 inequality for the world as a whole has been 
falling for most of the last 20 years. It’s a fact 
that hasn’t been noted often enough.
The finding comes from a recent investi-
gation by Christoph Lakner, a consultant at 
the World Bank, and Branko Milanovic, senior 
scholar at the Luxembourg Income Study Center. 
And while such a framing may sound startling 
at first, it should be intuitive upon reflection. 
The economic surges of China, India and some 
other nations have been among the most egali-
tarian developments in history.
Of course, no one should use this obser-
vation as an excuse to stop helping the less 
fortunate. But it can help us see that higher 
income inequality is not always the most rel-
evant problem, even for strict egalitarians. 
Policies on immigration and free trade, for 
 example, sometimes increase inequality within 
a nation, yet can make the world a better place 
and often decrease inequality on the planet as 
a whole.
International trade has drastically reduced 
poverty within developing nations, as evidenced 
by the export-led growth of China and other 
countries. Yet contrary to what many economists 
had promised, there is now good evidence that 
the rise of Chinese exports has held down the 
wages of some parts of the American middle 
class. This was demonstrated in a recent paper 
by the economists David H. Autor of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn of 
the Center for Monetary and Financial Studies in 
Madrid, and Gordon H. Hanson of the University 
of California, San Diego. 
At the same time, Chinese economic 
growth has probably raised incomes of the 
top 1 percent in the United States, through 
exports that have increased the value of 
companies whose shares are often held by 
wealthy  Americans. So while Chinese growth 
has added to income inequality in the United 
States, it has also increased prosperity and 
income equality globally.
The evidence also suggests that immigra-
tion of low-skilled workers to the United States 
has a modestly negative effect on the wages 
of American workers without a high school 
 diploma, as shown, for instance, in research 
by George Borjas, a Harvard economics pro-
fessor. Yet that same immigration greatly ben-
efits those who move to wealthy countries like 
the United States. (It probably also helps top 
 American earners, who can hire household and 
child-care workers at cheaper prices.) Again, 
income inequality within the nation may rise but 
global inequality probably declines, especially if 
the new arrivals send money back home.
From a narrowly nationalist point of view, 
these developments may not be auspicious for 
the United States. But that narrow viewpoint is 
the main problem. We have evolved a political 
debate where essentially nationalistic concerns 
have been hiding behind the gentler cloak of 
egalitarianism. To clear up this confusion, one 
recommendation would be to preface all discus-
sions of inequality with a reminder that global 
inequality has been falling and that, in this 
regard, the world is headed in a fundamentally 
better direction.
The message from groups like Occupy Wall 
Street has been that inequality is up and that 
capitalism is failing us. A more correct and 
nuanced message is this: Although significant 
economic problems remain, we have been living 
in equalizing times for the world—a change 
that has been largely for the good. That may not 
make for convincing sloganeering, but it’s the 
truth.
A common view is that high and rising 
inequality within nations brings political 
trouble, maybe through violence or even revo-
lution. So one might argue that a nationalistic 
perspective is important. But it’s hardly obvi-
ous that such predictions of political turmoil 
are true, especially for aging societies like the 
United States that are showing falling rates 
of crime. 
Furthermore, public policy can adjust to 
 accommodate some egalitarian concerns. We can 
improve our educational system, for example.
Still, to the extent that political worry 
about rising domestic inequality is justified, 
it suggests yet another reframing. If our 
 domestic politics can’t handle changes in 
income distribution, maybe the problem isn’t 
that capitalism is fundamentally flawed but 
rather that our political institutions are inflex-
ible. Our politics need not collapse under the 
pressure of a world that, over all, is becoming 
wealthier and fairer. ■

20-1c The Poverty Rate
A commonly used gauge of the distribution of income is the poverty rate. The 
poverty rate is the percentage of the population whose family income falls below 
an absolute level called the poverty line. The poverty line is set by the federal 
government at roughly three times the cost of providing an adequate diet. This 
line depends on family size and is adjusted every year to account for changes in 
the level of prices. 
To get some idea about what the poverty rate tells us, consider the data for 2014. 
In that year, the median family in the United States had an income of $66,632, and 
the poverty line for a family of four was $24,230. The poverty rate was 14.8 per-
cent. In other words, 14.8 percent of the U.S. population were members of families 
with incomes below the poverty line for their family size. 
Figure 2 shows the poverty rate since 1959, when the official data begin. You 
can see that the poverty rate fell from 22.4 percent in 1959 to a low of 11.1  percent 
in 1973. This decline is not surprising, as average income in the economy  (adjusted 
for inflation) rose more than 50 percent during this period. Because the pov-
erty line is an absolute rather than a relative standard, more families are pushed 
above the poverty line as economic growth pushes the entire income distribution 
upward. As John F. Kennedy once put it, a rising tide lifts all boats.
Since the early 1970s, however, the economy’s rising tide has left some boats 
behind. Despite continued growth in average income, the poverty rate has not 
declined below the level reached in 1973. This lack of progress in reducing pov-
erty in recent decades is closely related to the increasing inequality we saw in 
Table 2. Although economic growth has raised the income of the typical family, 
the increase in inequality has prevented the poorest families from sharing in this 
greater economic prosperity.
Poverty is an economic malady that affects all groups within the population, 
but it does not affect all groups with equal frequency. Table 3 shows the poverty 
rates for several groups, and it reveals three striking facts:
• Poverty is correlated with race. Blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as 
likely to live in poverty as whites.

CHAPTER 20   INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY 
• Poverty is correlated with age. Children are more likely than average to be 
members of poor families, and the elderly are less likely than average to be 
poor. 
• Poverty is correlated with family composition. Families headed by a single 
mother are about five times as likely to live in poverty as families headed by 
a married couple.
These three facts have described American society for many years, and they show 
which people are most likely to be poor. These effects also work together: Almost 
half the children in black and Hispanic female-headed households live in poverty.
20-1d Problems in Measuring Inequality
Although data on the income distribution and the poverty rate give us some 
idea about the degree of inequality in our society, interpreting these data is not 
always straightforward. The data are based on households’ annual incomes. 
What people care about, however, is not their incomes but their ability to main-
tain a good standard of living. For at least three reasons, data on the income dis-
tribution and the poverty rate give an incomplete picture of inequality in living 
standards. 
In-Kind Transfers   Measurements of the distribution of income and the poverty 
rate are based on families’ monetary income. Through various government pro-
grams, however, the poor receive many nonmonetary items, including free food, 
housing vouchers, and medical services. Transfers given to the poor in the form of 
goods and services rather than cash are called in-kind transfers. Standard mea-
surements of the degree of inequality do not include these in-kind transfers. 
Because in-kind transfers are received mostly by the poorest members of 
 society, the failure to include in-kind transfers as part of income greatly affects 
the measured poverty rate. According to a study by the Census Bureau, if in-kind 
transfers were included in income at their market value, the number of families in 
poverty would be about 10 percent lower than the standard data indicate. 
The Economic Life Cycle  Incomes vary predictably over people’s lives. A young 
worker, especially one in school, has a low income. Income rises as the worker 
gains maturity and experience, peaks at around age 50, and then falls sharply 
when the worker retires at around age 65. This regular pattern of income variation 
is called the life cycle.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
Because people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle changes in 
 income, their standard of living in any year depends more on lifetime income 
than on that year’s income. The young often borrow, perhaps to go to school or 
to buy a house, and then repay these loans later when their incomes rise. People 
have their highest saving rates when they are middle-aged. Because people can 
save in anticipation of retirement, the large declines in incomes at retirement need 
not lead to similar declines in the standard of living. This normal life cycle pattern 
causes inequality in the distribution of annual income, but it does not necessarily 
represent true inequality in living standards. 
Transitory versus Permanent Income  Incomes vary over people’s lives not only 
because of predictable life cycle variation but also because of random and transi-
tory forces. One year a frost kills off the Florida orange crop, and Florida orange 
growers see their incomes fall temporarily. At the same time, the Florida frost 
drives up the price of oranges, and California orange growers see their incomes 
temporarily rise. The next year the reverse might happen.
Just as people can borrow and save to smooth out life cycle variation in income, 
they can also borrow and save to smooth out transitory variation in income. To the 
extent that a family saves in good years and borrows (or depletes its savings) in bad 
years, transitory changes in income need not affect its standard of living. A family’s 
ability to buy goods and services depends largely on its permanent income, which 
is its normal, or average, income. 
To gauge inequality of living standards, the distribution of permanent  income 
is more relevant than the distribution of annual income. Many economists  believe 
that people base their consumption on their permanent income; as a  result, 
 inequality in consumption is one gauge of inequality of permanent income.  
Because permanent income and consumption are less affected by transitory 
changes in income, they are more equally distributed than is current income.

CASE 
STUDY
ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF INEQUALITY 
A 2008 study by Michael Cox and Richard Alm of the Federal  Reserve 
Bank of Dallas shows how different measures of inequality lead to 
dramatically different results. Cox and Alm compared American 
households in the top fifth of the income distribution to those in the
bottom fifth to see how far apart they are. 
According to Cox and Alm, the richest fifth of U.S. households in 2006 had an 
 average income of $149,963, while the poorest fifth had an average income of $9,974. 
Thus, the top group had about 15 times as much income as the bottom group.
The gap between rich and poor shrinks a bit if taxes are taken into account. 
 Because the tax system is progressive, the top group paid a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than did the bottom group. Cox and Alm found that the richest 
fifth had 14 times as much after-tax income as the poorest fifth.
The gap shrinks more if one looks at consumption rather than income. House-
holds having an unusually good year are more likely to be in the top group and are 
likely to save a high fraction of their incomes. Households having an unusually bad 
year are more likely to be in the bottom group and are more likely to consume out 
of their savings. According to Cox and Alm, the consumption of the richest fifth 
was only 3.9 times as much as the consumption of the poorest fifth. 
The consumption gap becomes smaller still if one corrects for differences in the 
number of people in the household. Because larger families are more likely to have

two earners, they are more likely to find themselves near the top of the income 
distribution. But they also have more mouths to feed. Cox and Alm reported that 
households in the top fifth had an average of 3.1 people, while those in the bottom 
fifth had an average of 1.7 people. As a result, consumption per person in the rich-
est fifth of households was only 2.1 times consumption per person in the poorest 
fifth. 
These data show that inequality in material standards of living is much smaller 
than inequality in annual income. ●
20-1e Economic Mobility
People sometimes speak of “the rich” and “the poor” as if these groups con-
sisted of the same families year after year. But this is not at all the case. Economic 
 mobility, the movement of people between income classes, is significant in the 
U.S. economy. Movements up the income ladder can be due to good luck or hard 
work, and movements down the ladder can be due to bad luck or laziness. Some 
of this mobility reflects transitory variation in income, while some reflects more 
persistent changes in income.
Because family income changes over time, temporary poverty is more common 
than the poverty rate suggests, but persistent poverty is less common. In a typical 
10-year period, about one in four families falls below the poverty line in at least one 
year. Yet fewer than 3 percent of families are poor for 8 or more years. Because it is 
likely that the temporarily poor and the persistently poor face different problems, 
policies that aim to combat poverty need to distinguish between these groups.
Another way to gauge economic mobility is the persistence of economic success 
from generation to generation. Economists who have studied this topic find that 
having an above-average income carries over from parents to children, but the per-
sistence is far from perfect, indicating substantial mobility among income classes. If 
a father earns 20 percent above his generation’s average income, his son will most 
likely earn 8 percent above his generation’s average income. There is only a small 
correlation between the income of a grandfather and the income of his grandson. 
One result of this intergenerational economic mobility is that the U.S. economy 
is filled with self-made millionaires (as well as with heirs who have squandered 
the fortunes they inherited). According to one study, about four out of five mil-
lionaires made their money on their own, often by starting and building a busi-
ness or by climbing the corporate ladder. Only one in five millionaires inherited 
his fortune.

What does the poverty rate measure? • Describe three potential problems 
in interpreting the measured poverty rate.
20-2 The Political Philosophy of Redistributing Income
We have just seen how the economy’s income is distributed and have considered 
some of the problems in interpreting measured inequality. This discussion was 
positive in the sense that it merely described the world as it is. We now turn to the 
normative question facing policymakers: What should the government do about 
economic inequality?
This question is not just about economics. Economic analysis alone cannot tell 
us whether policymakers should try to make our society more egalitarian. Our 
views on this question are, to a large extent, a matter of political philosophy. Yet

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
because the government’s role in redistributing income is central to so many 
 debates over economic policy, let’s digress from economic science to consider a bit 
of political philosophy.
20-2a Utilitarianism
A prominent school of thought in political philosophy is utilitarianism. The 
founders of utilitarianism are the English philosophers Jeremy Bentham (1748–
1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). To a large extent, the goal of utilitarians is 
to apply the logic of individual decision making to questions concerning morality 
and public policy. 
The starting point of utilitarianism is the notion of utility—the level of hap-
piness or satisfaction that a person receives from his circumstances. Utility is a 
measure of well-being and, according to utilitarians, is the ultimate objective of 
all public and private actions. The proper goal of the government, they claim, is to 
maximize the sum of utility achieved by everyone in society. 
The utilitarian case for redistributing income is based on the assumption of 
diminishing marginal utility. It seems reasonable that an extra dollar of  income 
provides a poor person with more additional utility than an extra dollar 
would provide to a rich person. In other words, as a person’s income rises, the  
extra well-being derived from an additional dollar of income falls. This plausible 
 assumption, together with the utilitarian goal of maximizing total utility, implies 
that the government should try to achieve a more equal distribution of income.
The argument is simple. Imagine that Peter and Paul are the same, except 
that Peter earns $80,000 and Paul earns $20,000. In this case, taking a dollar from  
Peter to pay Paul will reduce Peter’s utility and raise Paul’s utility. But because of 
diminishing marginal utility, Peter’s utility falls by less than Paul’s utility rises. 
Thus, this redistribution of income raises total utility, which is the utilitarian’s 
objective.
At first, this utilitarian argument might seem to imply that the govern-
ment should continue to redistribute income until everyone in society has  
exactly the same income. Indeed, that would be the case if the total amount of 
 income—$100,000 in our example—were fixed. But in fact, it is not. Utilitari-
ans  reject complete equalization of incomes because they accept one of the Ten 
 Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives.
To take from Peter to pay Paul, the government must pursue policies that  
redistribute income. The U.S. federal income tax and welfare system are examples. 
Under these policies, people with high incomes pay high taxes, and people with 
low incomes receive income transfers. These income transfers are phased out: As 
a person earns more, he receives less from the government. Yet when Peter faces 
a higher income tax rate and Paul faces a system of phased-out transfers, both 
have less incentive to work hard, because each gets to keep only a fraction of any  
additional earnings. As they both work less, society’s income falls, and so does 
total utility. The utilitarian government has to balance the gains from greater 
equality against the losses from distorted incentives. To maximize total utility, 
therefore, the government stops short of making society fully egalitarian.
A famous parable sheds light on the utilitarian’s logic. Imagine that Peter and 
Paul are thirsty travelers trapped at different places in the desert. Peter’s oasis has 
a lot of water; Paul’s has only a little. If the government could transfer water from 
one oasis to the other without cost, it would maximize total utility from water by 
equalizing the amount in the two places. But suppose that the government has 
only a leaky bucket. As it tries to move water from one place to the other, some of

the water is lost in transit. In this case, a utilitarian government might still try to 
move some water from Peter to Paul, depending on the size of Paul’s thirst and 
the size of the bucket’s leak. But with only a leaky bucket at its disposal, a utilitar-
ian government will stop short of trying to reach complete equality.
20-2b Liberalism
A second way of thinking about inequality might be called liberalism. Philoso-
pher John Rawls develops this view in his book A Theory of Justice. This book was 
first published in 1971, and it quickly became a classic in political philosophy. 
Rawls begins with the premise that a society’s institutions, laws, and policies 
should be just. He then takes up the natural question: How can we, the members 
of society, ever agree on what justice means? It might seem that every person’s 
point of view is inevitably based on his particular circumstances—whether he 
is talented or less talented, diligent or lazy, educated or less educated, born to 
a wealthy family or a poor one. Could we ever objectively determine what a just 
society would look like?
To answer this question, Rawls proposes the following thought experiment. 
Imagine that before any of us is born, we all get together in the beforelife (the 
pre-birth version of the afterlife) for a meeting to design the rules that will govern 
society. At this point, we are all ignorant about the station in life each of us will 
end up filling. In Rawls’s words, we are sitting in an “original position” behind a 
“veil of ignorance.” In this original position, Rawls argues, we can choose a just 
set of rules for society because we must consider how those rules will affect every 
person. As Rawls puts it, “Since all are similarly situated and no one is able to 
design principles to favor his particular conditions, the principles of justice are the 
result of fair agreement or bargain.” Designing public policies and institutions in 
this way allows us to be objective about what policies are just. 
Rawls then considers what public policy designed behind this veil of igno-
rance would try to achieve. In particular, he considers what income distribution 
a person would consider fair if that person did not know whether he would 
end up at the top, bottom, or middle of the distribution. Rawls argues that a 
person in the original position would be chiefly concerned about the possibility 
of  being at the bottom of the income distribution. In designing public policies, 
therefore, we should aim to raise the welfare of the worst-off person in society. 
That is, rather than maximizing the sum of everyone’s utility, as a utilitarian 
would do, Rawls would strive to maximize the minimum utility. Rawls’s rule is 
called the maximin criterion.
Because the maximin criterion emphasizes the least fortunate person in soci-
ety, it justifies public policies aimed at equalizing the distribution of income. By 
transferring income from the rich to the poor, society raises the well-being of the 
least fortunate. The maximin criterion would not, however, lead to a completely 
egalitarian society. If the government promised to equalize incomes completely, 
people would have no incentive to work hard, society’s total income would 
fall substantially, and the least fortunate person would be worse off. Thus, the 
maximin criterion still allows disparities in income because such disparities can 
 improve incentives and thereby raise society’s ability to help the poor. Nonethe-
less, because Rawls’s philosophy puts weight on only the least fortunate members 
of society, it calls for more income redistribution than does utilitarianism.
Rawls’s views are controversial, but the thought experiment he proposes 
has much appeal. In particular, this thought experiment allows us to consider 
the  redistribution of income as a form of social insurance. That is, from the 
liberalism

perspective of the original position behind the veil of ignorance, income redis-
tribution is like an insurance policy. Homeowners buy fire insurance to protect 
themselves from the risk of their house burning down. Similarly, when we as a 
society choose policies that tax the rich to supplement the incomes of the poor, we 
are all insuring ourselves against the possibility that we might have been mem-
bers of poor families. Because people generally dislike risk, we should be happy 
to have been born into a society that provides us this insurance. 
It is not at all clear, however, that rational people behind the veil of igno-
rance would truly be so risk averse that they would follow the maximin crite-
rion.  Indeed, because a person in the original position might end up anywhere in 
the distribution of outcomes, he might treat all possible outcomes equally when 
designing public policies. In this case, the best policy behind the veil of ignorance 
would be to maximize the average utility of members of society, and the resulting 
notion of justice would be more utilitarian than Rawlsian.
20-2c Libertarianism
A third view of inequality is called libertarianism. The two views we have consid-
ered so far—utilitarianism and liberalism—both view the total income of society 
as a shared resource that a social planner can freely redistribute to achieve some 
social goal. By contrast, libertarians argue that society itself earns no income—
only individual members of society earn income. According to libertarians, the 
government should not take from some individuals and give to others to achieve 
any particular distribution of income. 
For instance, philosopher Robert Nozick writes the following in his famous 
1974 book Anarchy, State, and Utopia:
We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by 
someone who now makes last minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting. 
There is no central distribution, no person or group entitled to control all the 
resources, jointly deciding how they are to be doled out. What each person gets, 
he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a gift. In a 
free society, diverse persons control different resources, and new holdings arise 
out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons.
Whereas utilitarians and liberals try to judge what amount of inequality is 
 desirable in a society, Nozick denies the validity of this very question.
The libertarian alternative to evaluating economic outcomes is to evaluate 
the process by which these outcomes arise. When the distribution of income is 
achieved unfairly—for instance, when one person steals from another—the gov-
ernment has the right and duty to remedy the problem. But as long as the process 
determining the distribution of income is just, the resulting distribution is fair, no 
matter how unequal.
Nozick criticizes Rawls’s liberalism by drawing an analogy between the dis-
tribution of income in society and the distribution of grades in a course. Suppose 
you were asked to judge the fairness of the grades in the economics course you are 
now taking. Would you imagine yourself behind a veil of ignorance and choose 
a grade distribution without knowing the talents and efforts of each student? Or 
would you ensure that the process of assigning grades to students is fair without 
regard for whether the resulting distribution is equal or unequal? For the case of 
grades at least, the libertarian emphasis on process over outcomes is compelling.
Libertarians conclude that equality of opportunities is more important than 
equality of incomes. They believe that the government should enforce individual 
libertarianism

according to which the 
government should  punish 
crimes and enforce 
voluntary agreements but

rights to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to use his talents and 
achieve success. Once these rules of the game are established, the government has 
no reason to alter the resulting distribution of income.

20-3 Policies to Reduce Poverty
As we have just seen, political philosophers hold various views about what role 
the government should take in altering the distribution of income. Political debate 
among the larger population of voters reflects a similar disagreement. Despite these 
continuing debates, most people believe that, at the very least, the government 
should try to help those most in need. According to a popular metaphor, the govern-
ment should provide a “safety net” to prevent any citizen from falling too far. 
Poverty is one of the most difficult problems that policymakers face. Poor fam-
ilies are more likely than the overall population to experience homelessness, drug 
dependence, health problems, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, unemployment, and 
low educational attainment. Members of poor families are more likely both to 
commit crimes and to be victims of crimes. Although it is hard to separate the 
causes of poverty from the effects, there is no doubt that poverty is associated 
with various economic and social ills. 
Suppose that you were a policymaker in the government and your goal was to 
reduce the number of people living in poverty. How would you achieve this goal? 
Here we examine some of the policy options that you might consider. Each of 
these options helps some people escape poverty, but none of them is perfect, and 
deciding upon the best combination to use is not easy. 
20-3a Minimum-Wage Laws
Laws setting a minimum wage that employers can pay workers are a perennial 
source of debate. Advocates view the minimum wage as a way of helping the 
working poor without any cost to the government. Critics view it as hurting those 
it is intended to help.
The minimum wage is easily understood using the tools of supply and 
demand, as we first saw in Chapter 6. For workers with low levels of skill and 
experience, a high minimum wage forces the wage above the level that balances 
supply and demand. It therefore raises the cost of labor to firms and reduces the 
quantity of labor that those firms demand. The result is higher unemployment 
among those groups of workers affected by the minimum wage. Those workers 
who remain employed benefit from a higher wage, but those who might have 
been employed at a lower wage are worse off.
The magnitude of these effects depends crucially on the elasticity of labor 
demand. Advocates of a high minimum wage argue that the demand for unskilled 
labor is relatively inelastic so that a high minimum wage depresses employment 
only slightly. Critics of the minimum wage argue that labor demand is more elas-
tic, especially in the long run when firms can adjust employment and production 
more fully. They also note that many minimum-wage workers are teenagers from 
middle-class families so that a high minimum wage is imperfectly targeted as a 
policy for helping the poor.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
20-3b Welfare
One way for the government to raise the living standards of the poor is to supplement 
their incomes. The primary way the government does this is through the welfare 
system. Welfare is a broad term that encompasses various government programs. 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a program that assists families 
with children and no adult able to support the family. In a typical family receiving 
such assistance, the father is absent and the mother is at home raising small children. 
Another welfare program is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides as-
sistance to the poor who are sick or disabled. Note that for both of these welfare pro-
grams, a poor person cannot qualify for assistance simply by having a low income. 
He must also establish some additional “need,” such as small children or a disability. 
A common criticism of welfare programs is that they create incentives for peo-
ple to become “needy.” For example, these programs may encourage families to 
break up, for many families qualify for financial assistance only if the father is 
absent. The programs may also encourage illegitimate births, for many poor, sin-
gle women qualify for assistance only if they have children. Because poor, single 
mothers are such a large part of the poverty problem and because welfare pro-
grams seem to raise the number of poor, single mothers, critics of the welfare sys-
tem assert that these policies exacerbate the very problems they are supposed to 
cure. As a result of these arguments, the welfare system was revised in a 1996 law 
that limited the amount of time recipients could stay on welfare.
How severe are these potential problems with the welfare system? No one 
knows for sure. Proponents of the welfare system point out that being a poor, 
single mother on welfare is a difficult existence at best, and they do not believe 
that many people would choose such a life if it were not thrust upon them. More-
over, trends over time do not support the view that the decline of the two-parent 
family is largely a symptom of the welfare system, as the system’s critics some-
times claim. Since the early 1970s, welfare benefits (adjusted for inflation) have 
declined, yet the percentage of children living with only one parent has risen.
20-3c Negative Income Tax
Whenever the government chooses a system to collect taxes, it affects the dis-
tribution of income. This is clearly true in the case of a progressive income tax, 
whereby high-income families pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes 
than do low-income families. As we discussed in Chapter 12, equity across  
income groups is an important goal in the design of a tax system.
Many economists have advocated supplementing the income of the poor using 
a negative income tax. According to this policy, every family would report its  
income to the government. High-income families would pay a tax based on their 
incomes. Low-income families would receive a subsidy. In other words, they 
would “pay” a “negative tax.” 
For example, suppose the government used the following formula to compute 
a family’s tax liability:
Taxes owed = (1/3 of income) – $10,000.
In this case, a family that earned $60,000 would pay $10,000 in taxes, and a fam-
ily that earned $90,000 would pay $20,000 in taxes. A family that earned $30,000 
would owe nothing. And a family that earned $15,000 would “owe” −$5,000. In 
other words, the government would send this family a check for $5,000.
Under a negative income tax, poor families would receive financial assistance 
without having to demonstrate need. The only qualification required to receive

415
CHAPTER 20   INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY 
assistance would be a low income. Depending on one’s point of view, this feature 
can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. On the one hand, a negative income 
tax does not encourage illegitimate births and the breakup of families, as critics 
of the welfare system believe current policy does. On the other hand, a negative 
 income tax would subsidize not only the unfortunate but also those who are sim-
ply lazy and, in some people’s eyes, undeserving of government support. 
One actual tax provision that works much like a negative income tax is the Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC). This credit allows poor working families to receive  
income tax refunds greater than the taxes they paid during the year. Because the 
EITC applies only to the working poor, it does not discourage recipients from work-
ing, as other antipoverty programs may. For the same reason, however, it also does 
not help alleviate poverty due to unemployment, sickness, or other inability to work. 
20-3d In-Kind Transfers
Another way to help the poor is to provide them directly with some of the goods 
and services they need to raise their living standards. For example, charities 
provide the needy with food, clothing, shelter, and toys at Christmas. The gov-
ernment gives poor families food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assis-
tance Program, or SNAP. This program, which replaced a similar one called food 
stamps, gives low-income families a plastic card, like a debit card, that can be 
used to buy food at stores. The government also gives many poor people health-
care through a program called Medicaid. 
Is it better to help the poor with these in-kind transfers or with direct cash 
 payments? There is no clear answer. 
Advocates of in-kind transfers argue that such transfers ensure that the poor 
get what they need most. Among the poorest members of society, alcohol and 
drug addiction is more common than it is in society as a whole. By providing the 
poor with food and shelter, society can be more confident that it is not helping to 
support such addictions. This is one reason in-kind transfers are more politically 
popular than cash payments to the poor.
Advocates of cash payments, on the other hand, argue that in-kind transfers 
are inefficient and disrespectful. The government does not know what goods and 
services the poor need most. Many of the poor are ordinary people down on their 
luck. Despite their misfortune, they are in the best position to decide how to raise 
their own living standards. Rather than giving the poor in-kind transfers of goods 
and services that they may not want, it may be better to give them cash and allow 
them to buy what they think they need most.
20-3e Antipoverty Programs and Work Incentives
Many policies aimed at helping the poor can have the unintended effect of dis-
couraging the poor from escaping poverty on their own. To see why, consider the 
following example. Suppose that a family needs an income of $20,000 to maintain 
a reasonable standard of living. And suppose that, out of concern for the poor, the 
government promises to guarantee every family that income. Whatever a family 
earns, the government makes up the difference between that income and $20,000. 
What effect would you expect this policy to have?
The incentive effects of this policy are obvious: Any person who would make 
under $20,000 by working has little incentive to find and keep a job. For every 
dollar that the person would earn, the government would reduce the income 
supplement by a dollar. In effect, the government taxes 100 percent of additional 
earnings. An effective marginal tax rate of 100 percent is surely a policy with a 
large deadweight loss.

social safety nets than the United 
States, but they also have very different 
tax systems.
Combating Inequality May 
Require Broader Tax
By Eduardo Porter
R
arely have we experienced such a con-
fluence of arguments in favor of raising 
taxes on the rich. After a hard-won re- election 
fought mainly over taxes and spending, 
 President Obama arguably has a mandate 
from voters to tap the wealthy to address our 
budget woes. 
[Author’s note: Shortly after this article 
was written, President Obama did indeed sign 
into law an increase in taxes on high incomes. 
These higher tax rates went into effect in 
2013.]…
Yet while raising more taxes from the win-
ners in the globalized economy is a start, and 
may help us dig out of our immediate fiscal 
hole, it is unlikely to be enough to address 
our long-term needs. The experience of many 
other developed countries suggests that pay-
ing for a government that could help the poor 
and the middle class cope in our brave new 
globalized world will require more money from 
the middle class itself. 
Many Americans may find this hard to  
believe, but the United States already has one 
of the most progressive tax systems in the 
developed world, according to several stud-
ies, raising proportionately more revenue from 
the wealthy than other advanced countries 
do. Taxes on American households do more to 
redistribute resources and reduce inequality 
than the tax codes of most other rich nations. 
But taxation provides only half the picture 
of public finance. Despite the progressivity of 
our taxes, according to a study of public fi-
nances across the industrial countries in the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, we also have one of the least 
effective governments at combating income 
inequality. There is one main reason: our tax 
code does not raise enough money. 
This paradox underscores two crucial les-
sons we could learn from the experience of our 
peers around the globe. The first is that the 
government’s success at combating income 
inequality is determined less by the progres-
sivity of either the tax code or the benefits 
than by the amount of tax revenue that the 
government can spend on programs that ben-
efit the middle class and the poor. 
The second is that very progressive tax 
codes are not very effective at raising money. 
The corollary—suggested by Peter Lindert 
of the University of California, Davis in his 
2004 book Growing Public—is that insisting 
on highly progressive taxes that draw most 
revenue from the rich may result in more  
inequality than if we relied on a flatter, more 
“regressive” tax schedule to raise money from 
everybody and pay for a government that 
could help every American family attain a 
 decent standard of living. 
Consider government aid for families.  
According to the O.E.C.D. study, our Tem-
porary Assistance for Needy Families is the 
most progressive program of cash benefits for 
families among 22 advanced countries, accu-
rately targeted to serve the poor. 
But American family cash benefits are 
the least effective at reducing inequality. The 
reason is that they are so meager. The entire 
budget for cash assistance for families in 
the United States amounts to one-tenth of 
1 percent of the nation’s economic output. 
The average across the O.E.C.D. nations is 
11 times bigger. Even including tax breaks 
and direct government services, we spend a 
much smaller share of our economic output 
on family assistance than almost any other 
advanced nation. 
International Differences in Income 
Redistribution
IN THE NEWS
The adverse effects of this high effective tax rate can persist over time. A person 
discouraged from working loses the on-the-job training that a job might offer. In 
addition, his children miss the lessons learned by observing a parent with a full-
time job, and this may adversely affect their own ability to find and hold a job. 
The antipoverty program we have been discussing is hypothetical, but it is not 
as unrealistic as it might first appear. Welfare, Medicaid, SNAP, and the EITC are 
all programs aimed at helping the poor, and they are all tied to family income. As 
a family’s income rises, the family becomes ineligible for these programs. When 
all these programs are taken together, it is common for families to face  effective 
marginal tax rates that are very high. Sometimes the effective marginal tax rates 
even exceed 100 percent so that poor families are worse off when they earn more. 
By trying to help the poor, the government discourages those families from

The same pattern can be found across a 
range of government programs. The reason is 
always the same: their relatively small size. 
Over all, government cash benefits in the 
United States—including pensions, disability, 
unemployment insurance and the like—con-
tribute about 10 percent to household income, 
on average, according to the study. The aver-
age across industrial nations is twice that. 
Our budget reveals a core philosophical 
difference with other advanced countries. 
In the big-government social democracies 
like those of Western Europe, government is  
expected to guarantee a set of universal pub-
lic services—from health care to child care to 
pensions—that are considered basic rights 
of citizenry. To pay for this minimum welfare 
package, everybody is expected to contribute 
proportionately into the pot. 
Government in the United States has a 
different goal. Benefits are narrower. Social  
Security and Medicare follow a universal service 
template, but only for older Americans. Other 
social spending is aimed carefully to benefit the 
poor. Financed through a more progressive tax 
code, it looks more like charity than a universal 
right. On top of that, our philosophical stance 
virtually ensures a small government. 
Progressive taxes make it hard to raise 
money because they distort people’s behav-
ior. They encourage taxpayers to reduce their 
tax liability rather than to increase their pre-
tax income. High corporate taxes encourage 
companies to avoid them. High taxes on cap-
ital income also encourage avoidance and 
capital flight. High income tax rates on top 
earners can discourage work and investment, 
too. So trying to raise a lot of money with 
our progressive tax code would probably not 
achieve the goal and could damage economic 
growth. 
Big-government social democracies, 
by contrast, rely on flatter taxes to finance 
their public spending, like gas taxes and 
value-added taxes on consumption. The 
Nordic countries, for instance, have very 
low tax rates on capital income relative to 
income from work. And they have relatively 
high taxes on consumption. In Denmark, 
consumption tax revenue amounts to about 
11 percent of the nation’s economy. In the 
United States, sales taxes and excise taxes 
on cigarettes and other items amount to 
roughly 4 percent. 
Liberal Democrats have long opposed 
them because they fall much more heavily 
on the poor, who spend a larger share of their 
incomes than the rich. But these taxes have 
one big positive feature: they are difficult to 
avoid and produce fewer disincentives to work 
or invest. That means they can be used to 
raise much more revenue. 
Public finances are under strain today 
on both sides of the Atlantic, as govern-
ments struggle to cope with our long global 
recession and the aging of the baby boom 
generation. In Southern Europe, the pressure  
to pare back universal welfare systems is  
intense. In the United States, political lead-
ers on both sides of the partisan divide have  
realized that even our relatively meager pack-
age of social goods cannot be sustained with 
our slim tax take. 
But the United States has one option that 
most of Europe’s flailing economies do not. Its 
tax revenue is so low, comparatively, that it 
has more space to raise it. A more efficient, 
flatter tax schedule would allow us to do so 
without hindering economic activity. 
Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who served in 
the administrations of Ronald Reagan and 
George H. W. Bush, told me last week that he 
thought federal tax revenue could increase to 
22 percent of the nation’s economic output, well 
above its historical average of 18.5 percent, 
without causing economic harm. If President 
Obama tries to go down this road, however, he 
may have to build a flatter tax code. 
“We should reform the tax system, no 
question,” William Gale, a tax policy expert 
at the Brookings Institution and co-director of 
the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, wrote in an 
e-mail. “We are going to need to move beyond 
the current set of tax instruments to raise the 
needed revenues—a VAT and/or a carbon 
tax seem like the obvious ways to go.” And  
Mr. Bartlett also pointed out: “We can’t get all 
the revenue we need from the rich. Eventually, 
 everyone will have to pay more.” ■
working. According to critics of antipoverty programs, these programs alter work 
attitudes and create a “culture of poverty.”
It might seem that there is an easy solution to this problem: Reduce benefits to 
poor families more gradually as their incomes rise. For example, if a poor family 
loses 30 cents of benefits for every dollar it earns, then it faces an effective mar-
ginal tax rate of 30 percent. This effective tax reduces work effort to some extent, 
but it does not eliminate the incentive to work completely. 
The problem with this solution is that it greatly increases the cost of programs 
to combat poverty. If benefits are phased out gradually as a poor family’s income 
rises, then families just above the poverty level will also be eligible for substantial 
benefits. The more gradual the phase-out, the more families are eligible, and the 
more the program costs. Thus, policymakers face a trade-off between burdening

the poor with high effective marginal tax rates and burdening taxpayers with 
costly programs to reduce poverty.
There are various other ways to reduce the work disincentive of antipoverty 
programs. One is to require any person collecting benefits to accept a govern-
ment-provided job—a system sometimes called workfare. Another possibility is to 
provide benefits for only a limited period of time. This route was taken in the 1996 
welfare reform bill, which imposed a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare recipients. 
When President Clinton signed the bill, he explained his policy as follows: “Wel-
fare should be a second chance, not a way of life.”
QuickQuiz
List three policies aimed at helping the poor, and discuss the pros and 
cons of each.
People have long reflected on the distribution of income in society. Plato, the 
 ancient Greek philosopher, concluded that in an ideal society the income of the 
richest person would be no more than four times the income of the poorest per-
son. Although the measurement of inequality is difficult, it is clear that our society 
has much more inequality than Plato recommended.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that govern-
ments can sometimes improve market outcomes. There is little consensus, how-
ever, about how this principle should be applied to the distribution of income. 
Philosophers and policymakers today do not agree on how much income inequal-
ity is desirable, or even whether public policy should aim to alter the distribution 
of income. Much of public debate reflects this disagreement. Whenever taxes are 
raised, for instance, lawmakers argue over how much of the tax hike should fall 
on the rich, the middle class, and the poor.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people face trade-offs. This 
principle is important to keep in mind when thinking about economic inequal-
ity. Policies that penalize the successful and reward the unsuccessful reduce the 
incentive to succeed. Thus, policymakers face a trade-off between equality and 
efficiency. The more equally the pie is divided, the smaller the pie becomes. This 
is the one lesson concerning the distribution of income about which almost every-
one agrees.

CHAPTER 20   INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY 
• Data on the distribution of income show a wide dispar-
ity in U.S. society. The richest fifth of families earns more 
than twelve times as much income as the poorest fifth.
• Because in-kind transfers, the economic life cycle, transi-
tory income, and economic mobility are so important for 
understanding variation in income, it is difficult to gauge 
the degree of inequality in our society using data on the 
distribution of income in a single year. When these other 
factors are taken into account, they tend to suggest that 
economic well-being is more equally distributed than is 
annual income.
• Political philosophers differ in their views about the role 
of government in altering the distribution of income. 
Utilitarians (such as John Stuart Mill) would choose 
the distribution of income that maximizes the sum of 
utility of everyone in society. Liberals (such as John 
Rawls) would determine the distribution of income as if 
we were behind a “veil of ignorance” that prevented us 
from knowing our stations in life. Libertarians (such as 
Robert Nozick) would have the government enforce indi-
vidual rights to ensure a fair process but then would not 
be concerned about inequality in the resulting distribu-
tion of income. 
• Various policies aim to help the poor—minimum-wage 
laws, welfare, negative income taxes, and in-kind trans-
fers. While these policies help alleviate poverty, they also 
have unintended side effects. Because financial assistance 
declines as income rises, the poor often face very high  
effective marginal tax rates, which discourage poor fami-
lies from escaping poverty on their own.

PART VI   THE ECONOMICS OF LABOR MARKETS
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
1. Does the richest fifth of the U.S. population earn closer 
to three, six, or twelve times the income of the poorest 
fifth?
2. What has happened to the income share of the richest 
fifth of the U.S. population over the past 40 years?
3. What groups in the U.S. population are most likely to 
live in poverty?
4. When gauging the amount of inequality, why do 
transitory and life cycle variations in income cause 
difficulties? 
5. How would a utilitarian, a liberal, and a libertar-
ian each determine how much income inequality is 
permissible?
6. What are the pros and cons of in-kind (rather than 
cash) transfers to the poor?
7. Describe how antipoverty programs can discourage 
the poor from working. How might you reduce this 
disincentive? What are the disadvantages of your 
 proposed policy?
PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS
1. Table 2 shows that income inequality in the United 
States has increased since 1970. Some factors contrib-
uting to this increase were discussed in Chapter 19. 
What are they?
2. Table 3 shows that the percentage of children in fam-
ilies with income below the poverty line far exceeds 
the percentage of the elderly in such families. How 
might the allocation of government money across 
different social programs have contributed to this 
 phenomenon?
3. This chapter discusses the importance of economic 
mobility.
a. What policies might the government pursue to 
 increase economic mobility within a generation?
b. What policies might the government pursue to 
 increase economic mobility across generations?
c. Do you think we should reduce spending on 
 current welfare programs to increase spending on 
programs that enhance economic mobility? What 
are some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
doing so?
4. Consider two communities. In one community, 
ten families have incomes of $100,000 each and ten 
 families have incomes of $20,000 each. In the other 
community, ten families have incomes of $200,000 
each and ten families have incomes of $22,000 each.
a. In which community is the distribution of  
income more unequal? In which community is  
the  problem of poverty likely to be worse?
b. Which distribution of income would Rawls 
 prefer? Explain.
c. Which distribution of income do you prefer? 
Explain. 
d. Why might someone have the opposite 
preference?
5. This chapter uses the analogy of a “leaky bucket” to 
explain one constraint on the redistribution of income.
a. What elements of the U.S. system for redistribut-
ing income create the leaks in the bucket?  
Be specific.
b. Do you think that Republicans or Democrats gen-
erally believe that the bucket used for redistribut-
ing income is leakier? How does that belief affect 
their views about the amount of income redistri-
bution that the government should undertake?

CHAPTER 20   INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY 
6. Suppose there are two possible income distributions 
in a society of ten people. In the first distribution, nine 
people have incomes of $30,000 and one person has an 
income of $10,000. In the second distribution, all ten 
people have incomes of $25,000.
a. If the society had the first income distribution, 
what would be the utilitarian argument for redis-
tributing income?
b. Which income distribution would Rawls consider 
more equitable? Explain.
c. Which income distribution would Nozick 
 consider more equitable? Explain.
7. The poverty rate would be substantially lower if the 
market value of in-kind transfers were added to fam-
ily income. The largest in-kind transfer is Medicaid, 
the government health program for the poor. Let’s say 
the program costs $10,000 per recipient family.
a. If the government gave each recipient family a 
$10,000 check instead of enrolling them in the 
Medicaid program, do you think that most of 
these families would spend that money to pur-
chase health insurance? Why? (Recall that the 
poverty level for a family of four is about $23,000.)
b. How does your answer to part (a) affect your view 
about whether we should determine the poverty 
rate by valuing in-kind transfers at the price the 
government pays for them? Explain.
c. How does your answer to part (a) affect your 
view about whether we should provide assistance 
to the poor in the form of cash transfers or in-kind 
transfers? Explain.
8. Consider two of the income security programs in the 
United States: Temporary Assistance for Needy Fam-
ilies (TANF) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
a. When a woman with children and very low  
income earns an extra dollar, she receives less in 
TANF benefits. What do you think is the effect 
of this feature of TANF on the labor supply of 
low-income women? Explain.
b. The EITC provides greater benefits as low- 
income workers earn more income (up to a 
point). What do you think is the effect of this 
program on the labor supply of low-income indi-
viduals? Explain.
c. What are the disadvantages of eliminating TANF 
and allocating the savings to the EITC?

The Theory of  
Consumer Choice
CHAPTER
21
W
hen you walk into a store, you are confronted with thousands of goods that 
you might buy. Because your financial resources are limited, however, you 
cannot buy everything that you want. You therefore consider the prices of 
the various goods offered for sale and buy a bundle of goods that, given your 
 resources, best suits your needs and desires.
In this chapter, we develop a theory that describes how consumers make deci-
sions about what to buy. Thus far in this book, we have summarized consumers’ 
decisions with the demand curve. As we have seen, the demand curve for a good

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
reflects consumers’ willingness to pay for that good. When the price rises, con-
sumers are willing to pay for fewer units, so the quantity demanded falls. We now 
look more deeply at the decisions that lie behind the demand curve. The theory of 
consumer choice presented in this chapter provides a more complete understand-
ing of demand, just as the theory of the competitive firm in Chapter 14 provides a 
more complete understanding of supply.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face 
trade-offs. The theory of consumer choice examines the trade-offs that people face 
as consumers. When a consumer buys more of one good, she can afford less of 
other goods. When she spends more time enjoying leisure and less time work-
ing, she has lower income and therefore lower consumption. When she spends 
more of her income in the present and saves less of it, she reduces the amount she 
will be able to consume in the future. The theory of consumer choice examines 
how consumers facing these trade-offs make decisions and how they respond to 
changes in their environment.
After developing the basic theory of consumer choice, we apply it to three 
questions about household decisions. In particular, we ask:
• Do all demand curves slope downward?
• How do wages affect labor supply?
• How do interest rates affect household saving?
At first, these questions might seem unrelated. But as we will see, we can use the 
theory of consumer choice to address each of them. 
21-1 The Budget Constraint: What the Consumer Can Afford 
Most people would like to increase the quantity or quality of the goods they con-
sume—to take longer vacations, drive fancier cars, or eat at better restaurants. 
People consume less than they desire because their spending is constrained, or lim-
ited, by their income. We begin our study of consumer choice by examining this 
link between income and spending.
To keep things simple, we examine the decision facing a consumer who buys 
only two goods: pizza and Pepsi. Of course, real people buy thousands of dif-
ferent kinds of goods. Assuming there are only two goods greatly simplifies the 
problem without altering the basic insights about consumer choice.
We first consider how the consumer’s income constrains the amount she 
spends on pizza and Pepsi. Suppose the consumer has an income of $1,000 per 
month and spends her entire income on pizza and Pepsi. The price of a pizza is 
$10, and the price of a liter of Pepsi is $2. 
The table in Figure 1 shows some of the many combinations of pizza and Pepsi 
that the consumer can buy. The first row in the table shows that if the consumer 
spends all her income on pizza, she can eat 100 pizzas during the month, but she 
would not be able to buy any Pepsi at all. The second row shows another possible 
consumption bundle: 90 pizzas and 50 liters of Pepsi. And so on. Each consump-
tion bundle in the table costs exactly $1,000.
The graph in Figure 1 illustrates the consumption bundles that the consumer 
can choose. The vertical axis measures the number of liters of Pepsi, and the 
horizontal axis measures the number of pizzas. Three points are marked on this

figure. At point A, the consumer buys no Pepsi and consumes 100 pizzas. At point 
B, the consumer buys no pizza and consumes 500 liters of Pepsi. At point C, the 
consumer buys 50 pizzas and 250 liters of Pepsi. Point C, which is exactly at the 
middle of the line from A to B, is the point at which the consumer spends an equal 
amount ($500) on pizza and Pepsi. These are only three of the many combinations 
of pizza and Pepsi that the consumer can choose. All the points on the line from A 
to B are possible. This line, called the budget constraint, shows the consumption 
bundles that the consumer can afford. In this case, it shows the trade-off between 
pizza and Pepsi that the consumer faces.
The slope of the budget constraint measures the rate at which the consumer can 
trade one good for the other. Recall that the slope between two points is  calculated 
as the change in the vertical distance divided by the change in the  horizontal dis-
tance (“rise over run”). From point A to point B, the vertical distance is 500  liters, 
and the horizontal distance is 100 pizzas. Thus, the slope is 5 liters per pizza. 
 (Actually, because the budget constraint slopes downward, the slope is a negative 
number. But for our purposes we can ignore the minus sign.)
Notice that the slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the two 
goods—the price of one good compared to the price of the other. A pizza costs five 
times as much as a liter of Pepsi, so the opportunity cost of a pizza is 5 liters of 
Pepsi. The budget constraint’s slope of 5 reflects the trade-off the market is offer-
ing the consumer: 1 pizza for 5 liters of Pepsi.
QuickQuiz

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
Our goal in this chapter is to understand how consumers make choices. The bud-
get constraint is one piece of the analysis: It shows the combinations of goods the 
consumer can afford given her income and the prices of the goods. The consum-
er’s choices, however, depend not only on her budget constraint but also on her 
preferences regarding the two goods. Therefore, the consumer’s preferences are 
the next piece of our analysis. 
21-2a Representing Preferences with Indifference Curves
The consumer’s preferences allow her to choose among different bundles of pizza 
and Pepsi. If you offer the consumer two different bundles, she chooses the bun-
dle that best suits her tastes. If the two bundles suit her tastes equally well, we say 
that the consumer is indifferent between the two bundles. 
Just as we have represented the consumer’s budget constraint graphically, 
we can also represent her preferences graphically. We do this with indifference 
curves. An indifference curve shows the various bundles of consumption that 
make the consumer equally happy. In this case, the indifference curves show the 
combinations of pizza and Pepsi with which the consumer is equally satisfied. 
Figure 2 shows two of the consumer’s many indifference curves. The consumer 
is indifferent among combinations A, B, and C because they are all on the same 
curve. Not surprisingly, if the consumer’s consumption of pizza is reduced, say, 
from point A to point B, consumption of Pepsi must increase to keep her equally 
happy. If consumption of pizza is reduced again, from point B to point C, the 
amount of Pepsi consumed must increase yet again.
The slope at any point on an indifference curve equals the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to substitute one good for the other. This rate is called the 
marginal rate of substitution (MRS). In this case, the marginal rate of substitution 
measures how much Pepsi the consumer requires to be compensated for a one-
unit reduction in pizza consumption. Notice that because the indifference curves 
are not straight lines, the marginal rate of substitution is not the same at all 
points on a given indifference curve. The rate at which a consumer is willing to 
trade one good for the other depends on the amounts of the goods she is already 
consuming. In other words, the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade pizza

The Consumer’s Preferences
The consumer’s preferences are repre-
sented with indifference curves, which 
show the combinations of pizza and Pepsi 
that make the consumer equally satisfied. 
Because the consumer prefers more of 
a good, points on a higher indifference 
curve (I2) are preferred to points on a 
lower indifference curve (I1). The mar-
ginal rate of substitution (MRS) shows 
the rate at which the consumer is willing 
to trade Pepsi for pizza. It measures the 
quantity of Pepsi the consumer must be 
given in exchange for 1 pizza.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
for Pepsi depends on whether she is hungrier or thirstier, which in turn depends 
on her current consumption of pizza and Pepsi.
The consumer is equally happy at all points on any given indifference curve, 
but she prefers some indifference curves to others. Because she prefers more 
consumption to less, higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. In 
Figure 2, any point on curve I2 is preferred to any point on curve I1.
A consumer’s set of indifference curves gives a complete ranking of the consum-
er’s preferences. That is, we can use the indifference curves to rank any two bundles 
of goods. For example, the indifference curves tell us that point D is preferred to 
point A because point D is on a higher indifference curve than point A. (That con-
clusion may be obvious, however, because point D offers the consumer both more 
pizza and more Pepsi.) The indifference curves also tell us that point D is preferred 
to point C because point D is on a higher indifference curve. Even though point D 
has less Pepsi than point C, it has more than enough extra pizza to make the con-
sumer prefer it. By seeing which point is on the higher indifference curve, we can 
use the set of indifference curves to rank any combination of pizza and Pepsi.
21-2b Four Properties of Indifference Curves
Because indifference curves represent a consumer’s preferences, they have certain 
properties that reflect those preferences. Here we consider four properties that 
describe most indifference curves:
•
Property 1: Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones. People usually 
prefer to consume more rather than less. This preference for greater quanti-
ties is reflected in the indifference curves. As Figure 2 shows, higher indif-
ference curves represent larger quantities of goods than lower indifference 
curves. Thus, the consumer prefers being on higher indifference curves. 
•
Property 2: Indifference curves are downward-sloping. The slope of an indiffer-
ence curve reflects the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one 
good for the other. In most cases, the consumer likes both goods. Therefore, 
if the quantity of one good is reduced, the quantity of the other good must 
increase for the consumer to be equally happy. For this reason, most indiffer-
ence curves slope downward.
• Property 3: Indifference curves do not cross. To see why this is true, suppose 
that two indifference curves did cross, as in Figure 3. Then, because point A 
FIGURE 3

 Indifference Curves
A situation like this can never happen. 
According to these indifference curves, 
the consumer would be equally  satisfied 
at points A, B, and C, even though 
point C has more of both goods than 
point A.

is on the same indifference curve as point B, the two points would make the 
consumer equally happy. In addition, because point B is on the same indif-
ference curve as point C, these two points would make the consumer equally 
happy. But these conclusions imply that points A and C would also make the 
consumer equally happy, even though point C has more of both goods. This 
contradicts our assumption that the consumer always prefers more of both 
goods to less. Thus, indifference curves cannot cross.
•
Property 4: Indifference curves are bowed inward. The slope of an indifference 
curve is the marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the consumer 
is willing to trade off one good for the other. The marginal rate of substitu-
tion (MRS)  usually depends on the amount of each good the consumer is 
currently consuming. In particular, because people are more willing to trade 
away goods that they have in abundance and less willing to trade away 
goods of which they have little, the indifference curves are bowed inward 
toward the graph’s origin. As an example, consider Figure 4. At point A, 
because the consumer has a lot of Pepsi and only a little pizza, she is very 
hungry but not very thirsty. To induce the consumer to give up 1 pizza, she 
has to be given 6 liters of Pepsi: The MRS is 6 liters per pizza. By contrast, at 
point B, the consumer has little Pepsi and a lot of pizza, so she is very thirsty 
but not very hungry. At this point, she would be willing to give up 1 pizza 
to get 1 liter of Pepsi: The MRS is 1 liter per pizza. Thus, the bowed shape of 
the indifference curve reflects the consumer’s greater willingness to give up a 
good that she already has a lot of.
21-2c Two Extreme Examples of Indifference Curves
The shape of an indifference curve reveals the consumer’s willingness to trade 
one good for the other. When the goods are easy to substitute for each other, the 
indifference curves are less bowed; when the goods are hard to substitute, the 
FIGURE 4
Bowed Indifference Curves
Indifference curves are usually bowed 
inward. This shape implies that the 
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) 
depends on the quantity of the two goods 
the consumer is currently consuming. At 
point A, the consumer has little pizza and 
much Pepsi, so she requires a lot of extra 
Pepsi to induce her to give up one of the 
pizzas: The MRS is 6 liters of Pepsi per 
pizza. At point B, the consumer has much 
pizza and little Pepsi, so she requires 
only a little extra Pepsi to induce her to 
give up one of the pizzas: The MRS is  
1 liter of Pepsi per pizza.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
indifference curves are very bowed. To see why this is true, let’s consider the 
extreme cases.
Perfect Substitutes  Suppose that someone offered you bundles of nickels and 
dimes. How would you rank the different bundles?
Most likely, you would care only about the total monetary value of each bun-
dle. If so, you would always be willing to trade 2 nickels for 1 dime. Your mar-
ginal rate of substitution between nickels and dimes would be a fixed number: 
MRS = 2, regardless of the number of nickels and dimes in the bundle. 
We can represent your preferences for nickels and dimes with the indifference 
curves in panel (a) of Figure 5. Because the marginal rate of substitution is con-
stant, the indifference curves are straight lines. In this extreme case of straight 
indifference curves, we say that the two goods are perfect substitutes.
Perfect Complements  Suppose now that someone offered you bundles of shoes. 
Some of the shoes fit your left foot, others your right foot. How would you rank 
these different bundles?
In this case, you might care only about the number of pairs of shoes. In other 
words, you would judge a bundle based on the number of pairs you could 
assemble from it. A bundle of 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes yields only 5 pairs. 
Getting 1 more right shoe has no value if there is no left shoe to go with it. 
We can represent your preferences for right and left shoes with the indifference 
curves in panel (b) of Figure 5. In this case, a bundle with 5 left shoes and 5 right 
shoes is just as good as a bundle with 5 left shoes and 7 right shoes. It is also just 
as good as a bundle with 7 left shoes and 5 right shoes. The indifference curves, 
therefore, are right angles. In this extreme case of right-angle indifference curves, 
we say that the two goods are perfect complements.

two goods with straight-
line indifference curves
When two goods are easily substitutable, such as nickels and dimes, the indifference curves 
are straight lines, as shown in panel (a). When two goods are strongly complementary, such 
as left shoes and right shoes, the indifference curves are right angles, as shown in panel (b).

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
In the real world, of course, most goods are neither perfect substitutes (like 
nickels and dimes) nor perfect complements (like right shoes and left shoes). 
More typically, the indifference curves are bowed inward, but not so bowed that 
they become right angles.
QuickQuiz
Draw some indifference curves for pizza and Pepsi. Explain the four prop-
erties of these indifference curves.
21-3 Optimization: What the Consumer Chooses
The goal of this chapter is to understand how a consumer makes choices. We have 
the two pieces necessary for this analysis: the consumer’s budget constraint (how 
much she can afford to spend) and the consumer’s preferences (what she wants to 
spend it on). Now we put these two pieces together and consider the consumer’s 
decision about what to buy. 
21-3a The Consumer’s Optimal Choices
Once again, consider our pizza and Pepsi example. The consumer would like to 
end up with the best possible combination of pizza and Pepsi for her—that is, the 
combination on her highest possible indifference curve. But the consumer must 
also end up on or below her budget constraint, which measures the total resources 
available to her.
Figure 6 shows the consumer’s budget constraint and three of her many 
indifference curves. The highest indifference curve that the consumer can reach 
(I2 in the figure) is the one that just barely touches her budget constraint. The 
point at which this indifference curve and the budget constraint touch is called 
the optimum. The consumer would prefer point A, but she cannot afford that point 
because it lies above her budget constraint. The consumer can afford point B, but 
that point is on a lower indifference curve and, therefore, provides the consumer 
less satisfaction. The optimum represents the best combination of pizza and Pepsi 
available to the consumer.
FIGURE 6
The Consumer’s Optimum
The consumer chooses the point on her budget 
constraint that lies on the highest indifference 
curve. At this point, called the optimum, the 
marginal rate of substitution equals the relative 
price of the two goods. Here the highest indif-
ference curve the consumer can reach is I2.  
The consumer prefers point A, which lies on 
indifference curve I3, but she cannot afford this 
bundle of pizza and Pepsi. By contrast, point B 
is affordable, but because it lies on a lower indif-
ference curve, the consumer does not prefer it.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
Notice that, at the optimum, the slope of the indifference curve equals the slope 
of the budget constraint. We say that the indifference curve is tangent to the bud-
get constraint. The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitu-
tion between pizza and Pepsi, and the slope of the budget constraint is the relative 
price of pizza and Pepsi. Thus, the consumer chooses consumption of the two goods so 
that the marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price.
In Chapter 7, we saw how market prices reflect the marginal value that con-
sumers place on goods. This analysis of consumer choice shows the same result in 
another way. In making her consumption choices, the consumer takes the relative 
price of the two goods as given and then chooses an optimum at which her mar-
ginal rate of substitution equals this relative price. The relative price is the rate 
at which the market is willing to trade one good for the other, whereas the mar-
ginal rate of substitution is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one 
good for the other. At the consumer’s optimum, the consumer’s valuation of the 
Utility: An Alternative Way to Describe Preferences 
and Optimization
W
e have used indifference curves to represent the consumer’s pref-
erences. Another common way to represent preferences is with the 
concept of utility. Utility is an abstract measure of the satisfaction or 
happiness that a consumer receives from a bundle of goods. Economists 
say that a consumer prefers one bundle of goods to another if one pro-
vides more utility than the other. 
Indifference curves and utility are closely related. Because the con-
sumer prefers points on higher indifference curves, bundles of goods on 
higher indifference curves provide higher utility. Because the consumer 
is equally happy with all points on the same indifference curve, all these 
bundles provide the same utility. You can think of an indifference curve 
as an “equal-utility” curve.
The marginal utility of any good is the increase in utility that the 
consumer gets from an additional unit of that good. Most goods are  
assumed to exhibit diminishing marginal utility : The more of the good 
the consumer already has, the lower the marginal utility provided by an 
extra unit of that good.
The marginal rate of substitution between two goods depends on 
their marginal utilities. For example, if the marginal utility of good 
X is twice the marginal utility of good Y, then a person would need 
2 units of good Y to compensate for losing 1 unit of good X, and the 
MRS equals 2. More generally, the marginal rate of substitution (and 
thus the slope of the indifference curve) equals the marginal utility 
of one good divided by the marginal utility of the other good.
Utility analysis provides another way to describe consumer optimi-
zation. Recall that, at the consumer’s optimum, the marginal rate of 
 substitution equals the ratio of prices.  That is,
MRS = PX/PY.
Because the marginal rate 
of substitution equals the 
ratio of marginal utilities, 
we can write this condition 
for optimization as
MUX/MUY = PX/PY.
Now rearrange this expression to become
MUX/PX = MUY/PY.
This equation has a simple interpretation: At the optimum, the marginal 
utility per dollar spent on good X equals the marginal utility per dol-
lar spent on good Y.  If this equality did not hold, the consumer could  
increase utility by spending less on the good that provided lower mar-
ginal utility per dollar and more on the good that provided higher mar-
ginal utility per dollar.
When economists discuss the theory of consumer choice, they 
sometimes express the theory using different words. One economist 
might say that the goal of the consumer is to maximize utility. Another 
economist might say that the goal of the consumer is to end up on the 
highest possible indifference curve. The first economist would conclude 
that at the consumer’s optimum, the marginal utility per dollar is 
the same for all goods, whereas the second would conclude that the 
indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint. In essence, these 
are two ways of saying the same thing. ■

two goods (as measured by the marginal rate of substitution) equals the market’s 
valuation (as measured by the relative price). As a result of this consumer optimi-
zation, market prices of different goods reflect the value that consumers place on 
those goods.
21-3b How Changes in Income Affect the Consumer’s Choices
Now that we have seen how the consumer makes a consumption decision, let’s 
examine how this decision responds to changes in the consumer’s income. To be 
specific, suppose that income increases. With higher income, the consumer can 
afford more of both goods. The increase in income, therefore, shifts the budget 
constraint outward, as in Figure 7. Because the relative price of the two goods has 
not changed, the slope of the new budget constraint is the same as the slope of the 
initial budget constraint. That is, an increase in income leads to a parallel shift in 
the budget constraint.
The expanded budget constraint allows the consumer to choose a better 
combination of pizza and Pepsi, one that is on a higher indifference curve. Given 
the shift in the budget constraint and the consumer’s preferences as represented 
by her indifference curves, the consumer’s optimum moves from the point labeled 
“initial optimum” to the point labeled “new optimum.”
Notice that, in Figure 7, the consumer chooses to consume more Pepsi and 
more pizza. The logic of the model does not require increased consumption 
of both goods in response to increased income, but this situation is the most 
common. As you may recall from Chapter 4, if a consumer wants more of a 
good when her income rises, economists call it a normal good. The indifference 
curves in Figure 7 are drawn under the assumption that both pizza and Pepsi 
are normal goods.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
Figure 8 shows an example in which an increase in income induces the 
consumer to buy more pizza but less Pepsi. If a consumer buys less of a good 
when her income rises, economists call it an inferior good. Figure 8 is drawn 
under the assumption that pizza is a normal good and Pepsi is an inferior good. 
Although most goods in the world are normal goods, there are some inferior 
goods as well. An example is bus rides. As income increases, consumers are more 
likely to own cars or take taxis and less likely to ride the bus. Bus rides, therefore, 
are an inferior good.
21-3c How Changes in Prices Affect the Consumer’s Choices
Let’s now use this model of consumer choice to consider how a change in the 
price of one of the goods alters the consumer’s choices. Suppose, in particular, 
that the price of Pepsi falls from $2 to $1 per liter. It is no surprise that the lower 
price expands the consumer’s set of buying opportunities. In other words, a fall in 
the price of any good shifts the budget constraint outward.
Figure 9 considers more specifically how the fall in price affects the budget 
constraint. If the consumer spends her entire $1,000 income on pizza, then the 
price of Pepsi is irrelevant. Thus, point A in the figure stays the same. Yet if the 
consumer spends her entire income of $1,000 on Pepsi, she can now buy 1,000 
liters rather than only 500. Thus, the endpoint of the budget constraint moves 
from point B to point D. 
Notice that in this case the outward shift in the budget constraint changes its 
slope. (This differs from what happened previously when prices stayed the same 
but the consumer’s income changed.) As we have discussed, the slope of the budget 
constraint reflects the relative price of pizza and Pepsi. Because the price of Pepsi 
has fallen to $1 from $2, while the price of pizza has remained $10, the consumer 
can now trade a pizza for 10 rather than 5 liters of Pepsi. As a result, the new budget 
constraint has a steeper slope.

A good is inferior if the consumer

less Pepsi.

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
How such a change in the budget constraint alters the consumption of both 
goods depends on the consumer’s preferences. For the indifference curves drawn 
in this figure, the consumer buys more Pepsi and less pizza.
21-3d Income and Substitution Effects
The impact of a change in the price of a good on consumption can be decomposed 
into two effects: an income effect and a substitution effect. To see what these two 
effects are, consider how our consumer might respond when she learns that the 
price of Pepsi has fallen. She might reason in the following ways:
• “Great news! Now that Pepsi is cheaper, my income has greater purchasing 
power. I am, in effect, richer than I was. Because I am richer, I can buy both 
more pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the income effect.)
• “Now that the price of Pepsi has fallen, I get more liters of Pepsi for every 
pizza that I give up. Because pizza is now relatively more expensive, I should 
buy less pizza and more Pepsi.” (This is the substitution effect.) 
Which statement do you find more compelling?
In fact, both of these statements make sense. The decrease in the price of Pepsi 
makes the consumer better off. If pizza and Pepsi are both normal goods, the 
consumer will want to spread this improvement in her purchasing power over 
both goods. This income effect tends to make the consumer buy more pizza and 
more Pepsi. Yet at the same time, consumption of Pepsi has become less expensive 
relative to consumption of pizza. This substitution effect tends to make the 
consumer choose less pizza and more Pepsi.
Now consider the result of these two effects working at the same time. The 
consumer certainly buys more Pepsi because the income and substitution effects 
both act to increase purchases of Pepsi. But for pizza, the income and substitution 
effects work in opposite directions. As a result, whether the consumer buys more

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
or less pizza is not clear. The outcome could go either way, depending on the sizes 
of the income and substitution effects. Table 1 summarizes these conclusions.
We can interpret the income and substitution effects using indifference curves. 
The income effect is the change in consumption that results from the movement to a new 
indifference curve. The substitution effect is the change in consumption that results from 
moving to a new point on the same indifference curve with a different marginal rate of 
substitution. 
Figure 10 shows graphically how to decompose the change in the consumer’s 
decision into the income effect and the substitution effect. When the price of Pepsi 
falls, the consumer moves from the initial optimum, point A, to the new optimum, 
point C. We can view this change as occurring in two steps. First, the consumer 
moves along the initial indifference curve, I1, from point A to point B. The consumer

down into an income effect and a substi-

movement along an indifference curve to

substitution—is shown here as the change 
from point A to point B along indifference 
curve I1. The income effect—the shift to a 
higher indifference curve—is shown here 
as the change from point B on indifference 
curve I1 to point C on indifference curve I2.

is equally happy at these two points, but at point B, the marginal rate of substitution 
reflects the new relative price. (The dashed line through point B is parallel to the 
new budget constraint and thus reflects the new relative price.) Next, the consumer 
shifts to the higher indifference curve, I2, by moving from point B to point C. Even 
though point B and point C are on different indifference curves, they have the same 
marginal rate of substitution. That is, the slope of the indifference curve I1 at point B 
equals the slope of the indifference curve I2 at point C.
The consumer never actually chooses point B, but this hypothetical point is 
useful to clarify the two effects that determine the consumer’s decision. Notice that 
the change from point A to point B represents a pure change in the marginal rate of 
substitution without any change in the consumer’s welfare. Similarly, the change 
from point B to point C represents a pure change in welfare without any change 
in the marginal rate of substitution. Thus, the movement from A to B shows the 
substitution effect, and the movement from B to C shows the income effect. 
21-3e Deriving the Demand Curve
We have just seen how changes in the price of a good alter the consumer’s budget 
constraint and, therefore, the quantities of the two goods that she chooses to buy. 
The demand curve for any good reflects these consumption decisions. Recall that 
a demand curve shows the quantity demanded of a good for any given price. We 
can view a consumer’s demand curve as a summary of the optimal decisions that 
arise from her budget constraint and indifference curves.
For example, Figure 11 considers the demand for Pepsi. Panel (a) shows that 
when the price of a liter falls from $2 to $1, the consumer’s budget constraint shifts 
outward. Because of both income and substitution effects, the consumer increases 
her purchases of Pepsi from 250 to 750 liters. Panel (b) shows the demand curve

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
that results from this consumer’s decisions. In this way, the theory of consumer 
choice provides the theoretical foundation for the consumer’s demand curve.
It may be comforting to know that the demand curve arises naturally from the 
theory of consumer choice, but this exercise by itself does not justify developing 
the theory. There is no need for a rigorous, analytic framework just to establish 
that people respond to changes in prices. The theory of consumer choice is, 
however, useful in studying various decisions that people make as they go about 
their lives, as we see in the next section.

and a substitution effect.
21-4 Three Applications
Now that we have developed the basic theory of consumer choice, let’s use 
it to shed light on three questions about how the economy works. These three 
questions might at first seem unrelated. But because each question involves 
household decision making, we can address it with the model of consumer 
behavior we have just developed.
21-4a Do All Demand Curves Slope Downward?
Normally, when the price of a good rises, people buy less of it. This typical 
behavior, called the law of demand, is reflected in the downward slope of the 
demand curve.
As a matter of economic theory, however, demand curves can sometimes slope 
upward. In other words, consumers can sometimes violate the law of demand 
and buy more of a good when the price rises. To see how this can happen, consider 
Figure 12. In this example, the consumer buys two goods—meat and potatoes. 
FIGURE 12
A Giffen Good
In this example, when the price of potatoes 
rises, the consumer’s optimum shifts from 
point C to point E. In this case, the con-
sumer responds to a higher price of potatoes 
by buying less meat and more potatoes.

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
Initially, the consumer’s budget constraint is the line from point A to point B. The 
optimum is point C. When the price of potatoes rises, the budget constraint shifts 
inward and is now the line from point A to point D. The optimum is now point E. 
Notice that a rise in the price of potatoes has led the consumer to buy a larger 
quantity of potatoes.
Why is the consumer responding in this strange way? In this example, potatoes 
are a strongly inferior good; that is, potatoes are a good that a person buys 
a lot less of when her income rises and a lot more of when her income falls. In 
Figure 12, the increase in the price of potatoes makes the consumer poorer; that 
is, the higher price puts her on a lower indifference curve. Because she is poorer 
and potatoes are an inferior good, the income effect makes her want to buy less 
meat and more potatoes. At the same time, because the potatoes have become 
more expensive relative to meat, the substitution effect makes the consumer want 
to buy more meat and fewer potatoes. If the income effect is much larger than the 
substitution effect, as it is in this example, the consumer responds to the higher 
price of potatoes by buying less meat and more potatoes.
Economists use the term Giffen good to describe a good that violates the law 
of demand. (The term is named for economist Robert Giffen, who first noted this 
possibility.) In this example, potatoes are a Giffen good. Giffen goods are inferior 
goods for which the income effect dominates the substitution effect. Therefore, 
they have demand curves that slope upward.
CASE 
STUDY
THE SEARCH FOR GIFFEN GOODS 
Have any actual Giffen goods ever been observed? Some historians 
suggest that potatoes were a Giffen good during the Irish potato 
famine of the 19th century. Potatoes were such a large part of people’s
diet that when the price of potatoes rose, the change had a large income effect. 
People responded to their reduced living standard by cutting back on the luxury 
of meat and buying more of the staple food of potatoes. Thus, it is argued that a 
higher price of potatoes actually raised the quantity of potatoes demanded.
A study by Robert Jensen and Nolan Miller, published in the American Economic 
Review in 2008, produced similar but more concrete evidence for the existence of 
Giffen goods. These two economists conducted a field experiment for five months 
in the Chinese province of Hunan. They gave randomly selected households 
vouchers that subsidized the purchase of rice, a staple in local diets, and used 
surveys to measure how consumption of rice responded to changes in the price. 
They found strong evidence that poor households exhibited Giffen behavior. 
Lowering the price of rice with the subsidy voucher caused households to reduce 
their consumption of rice, and removing the subsidy had the opposite effect. Jensen 
and Miller wrote, “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous empirical 
evidence of Giffen behavior.”
Thus, the theory of consumer choice allows demand curves to slope upward, 
and sometimes that strange phenomenon actually occurs. As a result, the law 
of demand we first saw in Chapter 4 is not completely reliable. It is safe to say, 
however, that Giffen goods are very rare. ●
21-4b How Do Wages Affect Labor Supply?
So far, we have used the theory of consumer choice to analyze how a person 
allocates income between two goods. We can apply the same theory to analyze 
how a person allocates time. People spend some of their time enjoying leisure and

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
some of it working so they can afford to buy consumption goods. The essence of 
the time-allocation problem is the trade-off between leisure and consumption.
Consider the decision facing Kayla, a freelance software designer. Kayla is 
awake for 100 hours per week. She spends some of this time enjoying leisure—
playing Minecraft, watching The Bachelor on television, and reading this textbook. 
She spends the rest of this time at her computer developing software. For 
every hour she works developing software, she earns $50, which she spends on 
consumption goods—food, clothing, and music downloads. Her hourly wage 
of $50 reflects the trade-off Kayla faces between leisure and consumption. For 
every hour of leisure she gives up, she works one more hour and gets $50 of 
consumption.
Figure 13 shows Kayla’s budget constraint. If she spends all 100 hours enjoying 
leisure, she has no consumption. If she spends all 100 hours working, she earns a 
weekly consumption of $5,000 but has no time for leisure. If she works a 40-hour 
week, she enjoys 60 hours of leisure and has weekly consumption of $2,000.
Figure 13 uses indifference curves to represent Kayla’s preferences for 
consumption and leisure. Here consumption and leisure are the two “goods” 
between which Kayla is choosing. Because Kayla always prefers more leisure 
and more consumption, she prefers points on higher indifference curves to 
points on lower ones. At a wage of $50 per hour, Kayla chooses a combination of 
consumption and leisure represented by the point labeled “optimum.” This is the 
point on the budget constraint that is on the highest possible indifference curve, I2.
Now consider what happens when Kayla’s wage increases from $50 to $60 
per hour. Figure 14 illustrates two possible outcomes. In each case, the budget 
constraint, shown in the left graphs, shifts outward from BC1 to BC2. In the process, 
the budget constraint becomes steeper, reflecting the change in relative price: At 
the higher wage, Kayla earns more consumption for every hour of leisure that she 
gives up.
Kayla’s preferences, as represented by her indifference curves, determine how 
her choice regarding consumption and leisure responds to the higher wage. In 
both panels, consumption rises. Yet the response of leisure to the change in the

wage is different in the two cases. In panel (a), Kayla responds to the higher wage 
by enjoying less leisure. In panel (b), Kayla responds by enjoying more leisure.
Kayla’s decision between leisure and consumption determines her supply of 
labor because the more leisure she enjoys, the less time she has left to work. In 
each panel of Figure 14, the right graph shows the labor-supply curve implied by 
Kayla’s decision. In panel (a), a higher wage induces Kayla to enjoy less leisure

The two panels of this figure show how a person might respond to an increase in the wage. 
The graphs on the left show the consumer’s initial budget constraint, BC1, and new budget 
constraint, BC2, as well as the consumer’s optimal choices over consumption and leisure. The 
graphs on the right show the resulting labor-supply curve. Because hours worked equal total 
hours available minus hours of leisure, any change in leisure implies an opposite change in the 
quantity of labor supplied. In panel (a), when the wage rises, consumption rises and leisure 
falls, resulting in a labor-supply curve that slopes upward. In panel (b), when the wage rises, 
both consumption and leisure rise, resulting in a labor-supply curve that slopes backward.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
and work more, so the labor-supply curve slopes upward. In panel (b), a higher 
wage induces Kayla to enjoy more leisure and work less, so the labor-supply 
curve slopes “backward.” 
At first, the backward-sloping labor-supply curve is puzzling. Why would 
a person respond to a higher wage by working less? The answer comes from 
considering the income and substitution effects of a higher wage.
Consider first the substitution effect. When Kayla’s wage rises, leisure becomes 
more expensive relative to consumption, and this encourages Kayla to substitute 
away from leisure and toward consumption. In other words, the substitution 
effect induces Kayla to work more in response to higher wages, which tends to 
make the labor-supply curve slope upward.
Now consider the income effect. When Kayla’s wage rises, she moves to 
a higher indifference curve. She is now better off than she was. As long as 
consumption and leisure are both normal goods, she tends to want to use this 
increase in well-being to enjoy both higher consumption and greater leisure. In 
other words, the income effect induces her to work less, which tends to make the 
labor-supply curve slope backward. 
In the end, economic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether an 
increase in the wage induces Kayla to work more or less. If the substitution effect 
is greater than the income effect, she works more. If the income effect is greater 
than the substitution effect, she works less. The labor-supply curve, therefore, 
could be either upward- or backward-sloping.
CASE 
STUDY
 IN COME EFFECTS ON LABOR SUPPLY: HISTORICAL TRENDS, LOTTERY  
WINNERS, AND THE CARNEGIE CONJECTURE
The idea of a backward-sloping labor-supply curve might at first 
seem like a mere theoretical curiosity, but in fact it is not. Evidence
indicates that the labor-supply curve, considered over long periods, does indeed 
slope backward. A hundred years ago, many people worked six days a week. 
Today, five-day workweeks are the norm. At the same time that the length of the 
workweek has been falling, the wage of the typical worker (adjusted for inflation) 
has been rising.
Here is how economists explain this historical pattern: Over time, advances 
in technology raise workers’ productivity and, thereby, the demand for labor. 
This increase in labor demand raises equilibrium wages. As wages rise, so does 
the reward for working. Yet rather than responding to this increased incentive by 
working more, most workers choose to take part of their greater prosperity in the 
form of more leisure. In other words, the income effect of higher wages dominates 
the substitution effect.
Further evidence that the income effect on labor supply is strong comes from 
a very different kind of data: winners of lotteries. Winners of large prizes in the 
lottery see large increases in their incomes and, as a result, large outward shifts in 
their budget constraints. Because the winners’ wages have not changed, however, 
the slopes of their budget constraints remain the same. There is, therefore, no 
substitution effect. By examining the behavior of lottery winners, we can isolate the 
income effect on labor supply.
The results from studies of lottery winners are striking. Of those winners who 
win more than $50,000, almost 25 percent quit working within a year and another 
9 percent reduce the number of hours they work. Of those winners who win more 
than $1 million, almost 40 percent stop working. The income effect on labor supply 
of winning such a large prize is substantial.

Similar results were found in a 1993 study, published in the Quarterly Journal of 
Economics, of how receiving a bequest affects a person’s labor supply. The study 
found that a single person who inherits more than $150,000 is four times as likely 
to stop working as a single person who inherits less than $25,000. This finding 
would not have surprised the 19th-century industrialist Andrew Carnegie. 
Carnegie warned that “the parent who leaves his son enormous wealth generally 
deadens the talents and energies of the son, and tempts him to lead a less 
useful and less worthy life than he otherwise would.” That is, Carnegie viewed 
the income effect on labor supply to be substantial and, from his paternalistic 
perspective, regrettable. During his life and at his death, Carnegie gave much of 
his vast fortune to charity. ●
21-4c How Do Interest Rates Affect Household Saving?
An important decision that every person faces is how much income to consume 
today and how much to save for the future. We can use the theory of consumer 
choice to analyze how people make this decision and how the amount they save 
depends on the interest rate their savings will earn.
Consider the decision facing Saul, a worker planning for retirement. To keep 
things simple, let’s divide Saul’s life into two periods. In the first period, Saul is 
young and working. In the second period, he is old and retired. When young, Saul 
earns $100,000. He divides this income between current consumption and saving. 
When he is old, Saul will consume what he has saved, including the interest that 
his savings have earned.
Suppose the interest rate is 10 percent. Then for every dollar that Saul saves 
when young, he can consume $1.10 when old. We can view “consumption when 
young” and “consumption when old” as the two goods that Saul must choose 
between. The interest rate determines the relative price of these two goods. 
Figure 15 shows Saul’s budget constraint. If he saves nothing, he consumes 
$100,000 when young and nothing when old. If he saves everything, he consumes 
nothing when young and $110,000 when old. The budget constraint shows these 
and all the intermediate possibilities.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
Figure 15 uses indifference curves to represent Saul’s preferences for 
consumption in the two periods. Because Saul prefers more consumption in both 
periods, he prefers points on higher indifference curves to points on lower ones. 
Given his preferences, Saul chooses the optimal combination of consumption in 
both periods of life, which is the point on the budget constraint that is on the 
highest possible indifference curve. At this optimum, Saul consumes $50,000 
when young and $55,000 when old.
Now consider what happens when the interest rate increases from 10 to 
20 percent. Figure 16 shows two possible outcomes. In both cases, the budget 
constraint shifts outward and becomes steeper. At the new, higher interest rate, 
Saul gets more consumption when old for every dollar of consumption that he 
gives up when young.
The two panels show the results given different preferences by Saul. In both 
cases, consumption when old rises. Yet the response of consumption when young 
to the change in the interest rate is different in the two cases. In panel (a), Saul 
responds to the higher interest rate by consuming less when young. In panel (b), 
Saul responds by consuming more when young. 
Saul’s saving is his income when young minus the amount he consumes when 
young. In panel (a), an increase in the interest rate reduces consumption when 
young, so saving must rise. In panel (b), an increase in the interest rate induces 
Saul to consume more when young, so saving must fall. 
The case shown in panel (b) might at first seem odd: Saul responds to an 
increase in the return to saving by saving less. But this behavior is not as peculiar 
as it might seem. We can understand it by considering the income and substitution 
effects of a higher interest rate.

both periods rises. The result is a decrease in saving when young.

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
Consider first the substitution effect. When the interest rate rises, consumption 
when old becomes less costly relative to consumption when young. Therefore, the 
substitution effect induces Saul to consume more when old and less when young. 
In other words, the substitution effect induces Saul to save more. 
Now consider the income effect. When the interest rate rises, Saul moves 
to a higher indifference curve. He is now better off than he was. As long as 
consumption in both periods consists of normal goods, he tends to want to use 
this increase in well-being to enjoy higher consumption in both periods. In other 
words, the income effect induces him to save less. 
The result depends on both the income and substitution effects. If the 
substitution effect of a higher interest rate is greater than the income effect, Saul 
saves more. If the income effect is greater than the substitution effect, Saul saves 
less. Thus, the theory of consumer choice says that an increase in the interest rate 
could either encourage or discourage saving.
This ambiguous result is interesting from the standpoint of economic theory, 
but it is disappointing from the standpoint of economic policy. It turns out that an 
important issue in tax policy hinges in part on how saving responds to interest rates. 
Some economists have advocated reducing the taxation of interest and other capital 
income, arguing that such a policy change would raise the after-tax interest rate 
that savers can earn and thereby encourage people to save more. Other economists 
have argued that because of offsetting income and substitution effects, such a tax 
change might not increase saving and could even reduce it. Unfortunately, research 
has not led to a consensus about how interest rates affect saving. As a result, there 
remains disagreement among economists about whether changes in tax policy 
aimed to encourage saving would, in fact, have the intended effect.

21-5 Conclusion: Do People Really Think This Way?
The theory of consumer choice describes how people make decisions. As we have 
seen, it has broad applicability. It can explain how a person chooses between pizza 
and Pepsi, work and leisure, consumption and saving, and so on. 
At this point, however, you might be tempted to look upon the theory of 
consumer choice with some skepticism. After all, you are a consumer. You decide 
what to buy every time you walk into a store. And you know that you do not 
decide by writing down budget constraints and indifference curves. Doesn’t this 
knowledge about your own decision making provide evidence against the theory?
The answer is no. The theory of consumer choice does not try to present a literal 
account of how people make decisions. It is a model. And as we first discussed in 
Chapter 2, models are not intended to be completely realistic.
The best way to view the theory of consumer choice is as a metaphor for 
how consumers make decisions. No consumer (except an occasional economist) 
goes through the explicit optimization envisioned in the theory. Yet consumers 
are aware that their choices are constrained by their financial resources. And 
given those constraints, they do the best they can to achieve the highest level 
of satisfaction. The theory of consumer choice tries to describe this implicit, 
psychological process in a way that permits explicit, economic analysis.

CHAPTER 21   THE THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE 
Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the test of a theory is in its 
applications. In the last section of this chapter, we applied the theory of consumer 
choice to three practical issues about the economy. If you take more advanced 
courses in economics, you will see that this theory provides the framework for 
much additional analysis.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
SUMMARY
• A consumer’s budget constraint shows the possible 
combinations of different goods she can buy given 
her income and the prices of the goods. The slope of 
the budget constraint equals the relative price of the 
goods.
• The consumer’s indifference curves represent her 
preferences. An indifference curve shows the various 
bundles of goods that make the consumer equally 
happy. Points on higher indifference curves are preferred 
to points on lower indifference curves. The slope of 
an indifference curve at any point is the consumer’s 
marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which the 
consumer is willing to trade one good for the other.
• The consumer optimizes by choosing the point on her 
budget constraint that lies on the highest indifference 
curve. At this point, the slope of the indifference curve 
(the marginal rate of substitution between the goods) 
equals the slope of the budget constraint (the relative 
price of the goods), and the consumer’s valuation 
of the two goods (measured by the marginal rate of 
substitution) equals the market’s valuation (measured 
by the relative price).

448
PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
• When the price of a good falls, the impact on the 
consumer’s choices can be broken down into an income 
effect and a substitution effect. The income effect is the 
change in consumption that arises because a lower 
price makes the consumer better off. The substitution 
effect is the change in consumption that arises because 
a price change encourages greater consumption of the 
good that has become relatively cheaper. The income 
effect is reflected in the movement from a lower to a 
higher indifference curve, whereas the substitution 
effect is reflected by a movement along an indifference 
curve to a point with a different slope.
• The theory of consumer choice can be applied in 
many situations. It explains why demand curves can 
potentially slope upward, why higher wages could 
either increase or decrease the quantity of labor 
supplied, and why higher interest rates could either 
increase or decrease saving.

E
conomics is a study of the choices that people make and the resulting interac-
tions they have with one another. As the preceding chapters demonstrate, the 
field has many facets. Yet it would be a mistake to think that all the facets we 
have seen make up a finished jewel, perfect and unchanging. Like all scientists, 
economists are always looking for new areas to study and new phenomena to 
explain. This final chapter on microeconomics offers an assortment of three top-
ics at the discipline’s frontier to show how economists are trying to expand their 
 understanding of human behavior and society. 
The first topic is the economics of asymmetric information. In many  different 
situations, some people are better informed than others, and 
the imbalance in information affects the choices they 
make and how they deal with one another. 
CHAPTER
22
Frontiers of Microeconomics

452
PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
Thinking about this asymmetry can shed light on many aspects of the world, from 
the market for used cars to the custom of gift giving.
The second topic we examine in this chapter is political economy. Throughout 
this book, we have seen many examples in which markets fail and government 
policy can potentially improve matters. But “potentially” is a necessary qualifier: 
Whether this potential is realized depends on how well our political institutions 
work. The field of political economy uses the tools of economics to understand 
the functioning of government.
The third topic in this chapter is behavioral economics. This field brings some 
insights from psychology into the study of economic issues. It offers a view of 
 human behavior that is more subtle and complex than the one found in conven-
tional economic theory, a view that may be more realistic.
This chapter covers a lot of ground. To do so, it offers not full helpings of these 
three topics but, instead, a taste of each. One goal of this chapter is to show a few of 
the directions economists are heading in their effort to expand knowledge of how 
the economy works. Another is to whet your appetite for more courses in economics.
22-1 Asymmetric Information 
“I know something you don’t know.” This statement is a common taunt among 
children, but it also conveys a deep truth about how people sometimes interact 
with one another. Many times in life, one person knows more about what is going 
on than another. A difference in access to knowledge that is relevant to an interac-
tion is called an information asymmetry.
Examples abound. A worker knows more than his employer about how much 
effort he puts into his job. A seller of a used car knows more than the buyer about 
the car’s condition. The first is an example of a hidden action, whereas the second 
is an example of a hidden characteristic. In each case, the uninformed party (the 
employer, the car buyer) would like to know the relevant information, but the 
informed party (the worker, the car seller) may have an incentive to conceal it.
Because asymmetric information is so prevalent, economists have devoted 
much effort in recent decades to studying its effects. Let’s discuss some of the 
insights that this study has revealed.
22-1a Hidden Actions: Principals, Agents, and Moral Hazard
Moral hazard is a problem that arises when one person, called the agent, is per-
forming some task on behalf of another person, called the principal. If the prin-
cipal cannot perfectly monitor the agent’s behavior, the agent tends to undertake 
less effort than the principal considers desirable. The phrase moral hazard refers to 
the risk, or “hazard,” of inappropriate or otherwise “immoral” behavior by the 
agent. In such a situation, the principal tries various ways to encourage the agent 
to act more responsibly.
The employment relationship is the classic example. The employer is the prin-
cipal, and the worker is the agent. The moral-hazard problem is the temptation 
of imperfectly monitored workers to shirk their responsibilities. Employers can 
respond to this problem in various ways:
• Better monitoring. Employers may plant hidden video cameras to record 
workers’ behavior. The aim is to catch irresponsible actions that might occur 
when supervisors are absent.

CHAPTER 22   FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
•
High wages. According to efficiency-wage theories (discussed in Chapter 19), 
some employers may choose to pay their workers a wage above the level 
that balances supply and demand in the labor market. A worker who earns 
an above-equilibrium wage is less likely to shirk because if he is caught and 
fired, he might not be able to find another high-paying job.
•
Delayed payment. Firms can delay part of a worker’s compensation, so if 
the worker is caught shirking and is fired, he suffers a larger penalty. One 
example of delayed compensation is the year-end bonus. Similarly, a firm 
may choose to pay its workers more later in their lives. Thus, the wage 
increases that workers get as they age may reflect not just the benefits of  
experience but also a response to moral hazard.
Employers can use any combination of these various mechanisms to reduce the 
problem of moral hazard.
Corporate Management
M
uch production in the modern economy takes place within corpo-
rations. Like other firms, corporations buy inputs in markets for 
the factors of production and sell their output in markets for goods and 
services. Also like other firms, they are guided in their decisions by the 
objective of profit maximization. But a large corporation has to deal with 
some issues that do not arise in, say, a small family-owned business.
What is distinctive about a corporation? From a legal standpoint, a 
corporation is an organization that is granted a charter recognizing it as 
a separate legal entity, with its own rights and responsibilities distinct 
from those of its owners and employees. From an economic standpoint, 
the most important feature of the corporate form of organization is the 
separation of ownership and control. One group of people, called the 
shareholders, own the corporation and share in its profits. Another group 
of people, called the managers, are employed by the corporation to make 
decisions about how to deploy the corporation’s resources.
The separation of ownership and control creates a principal-agent 
problem. In this case, the shareholders are the principals and the 
managers are the agents. The chief executive officer and other man-
agers, who are in the best position to know the available business 
opportunities, are charged with the task of maximizing profits for 
the shareholders. But ensuring that they carry out this task is not  
always easy. The managers may have goals of their own, such as taking 
life easy, having a plush office and a private jet, throwing lavish parties, 
or presiding over a large business empire. The managers’ goals may not 
always coincide with the shareholders’ goal of profit maximization.
The corporation’s board of directors is responsible for hiring 
and firing the top management. The board monitors the managers’ 
performance, and it de-
signs their compensation 
packages. These packages 
often include incentives 
aimed at aligning the inter-
ests of shareholders with the 
interests of management. Managers 
might be given bonuses based on performance or options to buy the 
company’s stock, which are more valuable if the company performs well.
Note, however, that the directors are themselves agents of the share-
holders. The existence of a board overseeing management only shifts the 
principal-agent problem. The issue then becomes how to ensure that the 
board of directors fulfills its own legal obligation of acting in the best 
interest of the shareholders. If the directors become too friendly with 
management, they may not provide the required oversight.
The corporation’s principal-agent problem became big news around 
2005. The top managers of several prominent companies, including 
 Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom, were found to be engaging in activities 
that enriched themselves at the expense of their shareholders. In these 
cases, the actions were so extreme as to be criminal, and the corporate 
managers were not just fired but also sent to prison. Some shareholders 
sued the directors for failing to monitor management sufficiently.
Fortunately, criminal activity by corporate managers is rare. But in 
some ways, it is only the tip of the iceberg. Whenever ownership and 
control are separated, as they are in most large corporations, there is an 
inevitable tension between the interests of shareholders and the inter-
ests of management. ■

There are also many examples of moral hazard beyond the workplace. A home-
owner with fire insurance will likely buy too few fire extinguishers because the home-
owner bears the cost of the extinguisher while the insurance company receives much 
of the benefit. A family may live near a river with a high risk of flooding because the 
family enjoys the scenic views, while the government bears the cost of disaster relief 
after a flood. Many regulations are aimed at addressing the problem: An insurance 
company may require homeowners to buy fire extinguishers, and the government 
may prohibit building homes on land with high risk of flooding. But the insurance 
company does not have perfect information about how cautious homeowners are, and 
the government does not have perfect information about the risk that families under-
take when choosing where to live. As a result, the problem of moral hazard persists.
22-1b  Hidden Characteristics: Adverse Selection and  
the Lemons Problem
Adverse selection is a problem that arises in markets in which the seller knows 
more about the attributes of the good being sold than the buyer does. In such 
a situation, the buyer runs the risk of being sold a good of low quality. That is, 
the “selection” of goods sold may be “adverse” from the standpoint of the unin-
formed buyer.
The classic example of adverse selection is the market for used cars. Sellers of 
used cars know their vehicles’ defects while buyers often do not. Because owners 
of the worst cars are more likely to sell them than are the owners of the best cars, 
buyers are worried about getting a “lemon.” As a result, many people avoid buying 
vehicles in the used car market. This lemons problem can explain why a used car 
only a few weeks old sells for thousands of dollars less than a new car of the same 
type. A buyer of the used car might surmise that the seller is getting rid of the car 
quickly because the seller knows something about it that the buyer does not.
A second example of adverse selection occurs in the labor market. According 
to another efficiency-wage theory, workers vary in their abilities, and they know 
their own abilities better than do the firms that hire them. When a firm cuts the 
wage it pays, the more talented workers are more likely to quit, knowing they will 
be able to find employment elsewhere. Conversely, a firm may choose to pay an 
above-equilibrium wage to attract a better mix of workers. 
A third example of adverse selection occurs in markets for insurance. For exam-
ple, buyers of health insurance know more about their own health problems than 
do insurance companies. Because people with greater hidden health problems 
are more likely to buy health insurance than are other people, the price of health  
insurance reflects the costs of a sicker-than-average person. As a result, people 
with average health may observe the high price of insurance and decide not to 
buy it.
When markets suffer from adverse selection, the invisible hand does not neces-
sarily work its magic. In the used car market, owners of good cars may choose to 
keep them rather than sell them at the low price that skeptical buyers are willing to 
pay. In the labor market, wages may be stuck above the level that balances supply 
and demand, resulting in unemployment. In insurance markets, buyers with low 
risk may choose to remain uninsured because the policies they are offered fail to  
reflect their true characteristics. Advocates of government-provided health insur-
ance sometimes point to the problem of adverse selection as one reason not to trust 
the private market to provide the right amount of health insurance on its own.

CHAPTER 22   FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
22-1c Signaling to Convey Private Information
Although asymmetric information is sometimes a motivation for public policy, it 
also motivates some individual behavior that otherwise might be hard to explain. 
Markets respond to problems of asymmetric information in many ways. One of 
them is signaling, which refers to actions taken by an informed party for the sole 
purpose of credibly revealing his private information. 
We have seen examples of signaling in previous chapters. As we saw in 
 Chapter 16, firms may spend money on advertising to signal to potential cus-
tomers that they have high-quality products. As we saw in Chapter 19, students 
may earn college degrees merely to signal to potential employers that they are 
high-ability individuals, rather than to increase their productivity. These two 
 examples of signaling (advertising, education) may seem very different, but  
below the surface, they are much the same: In both cases, the informed party (the 
firm, the student) uses the signal to convince the uninformed party (the customer, 
the employer) that the informed party is offering something of high quality.
What does it take for an action to be an effective signal? Obviously, it must be 
costly. If a signal were free, everyone would use it and it would convey no infor-
mation. For the same reason, there is another requirement: The signal must be less 
costly, or more beneficial, to the person with the higher-quality product. Other-
wise, everyone would have the same incentive to use the signal, and the signal 
would reveal nothing.
Consider again our two examples. In the advertising case, a firm with a good 
product reaps a larger benefit from advertising because customers who try the 
product once are more likely to become repeat customers. Thus, it is rational for 
the firm with a good product to pay for the cost of the signal (advertising), and it 
is rational for the customer to use the signal as a piece of information about the 
product’s quality. In the education case, a talented person can get through school 
more easily than a less talented one. Thus, it is rational for the talented person to 
pay for the cost of the signal (education), and it is rational for the employer to use 
the signal as a piece of information about the person’s talent.
The world is replete with instances of signaling. Magazine ads sometimes  
include the phrase “as seen on TV.” Why does a firm selling a product in a mag-
azine choose to stress this fact? One possibility is that the firm is trying to convey 
its willingness to pay for an expensive signal (a spot on television) in the hope 
that you will infer that its product is of high quality. For the same reason, gradu-
ates of elite schools are always sure to put that fact on their résumés.

CASE 
STUDY
GIFTS AS SIGNALS
A man is debating what to give his girlfriend for her birthday. 
“I know,” he says to himself, “I’ll give her cash. After all, I don’t 
know her tastes as well as she does, and with cash, she can buy any-
thing she wants.” But when he hands her the money, she is offended. Convinced 
he doesn’t really love her, she breaks off the relationship.
What’s the economics behind this story?
In some ways, gift giving is a strange custom. As the man in our story suggests, 
people typically know their own preferences better than others do, so we might 
expect everyone to prefer cash to in-kind transfers. If your employer substituted 
merchandise of his choosing for your paycheck, you would likely object to this 
means of payment. But your reaction is very different when someone who (you 
hope) loves you does the same thing.

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
One interpretation of gift giving is that it reflects asymmetric information and 
signaling. The man in our story has private information that the girlfriend would 
like to know: Does he really love her? Choosing a good gift for her is a signal of 
his love. Certainly, the act of picking out a gift, rather than giving cash, has the 
right characteristics to be a signal. It is costly (it takes time), and its cost depends 
on private information (how much he loves her). If he really loves her, choosing a 
good gift is easy because he is thinking about her all the time. If he doesn’t love her, 
finding the right gift is more difficult. Thus, giving a gift that suits his girlfriend is 
one way for him to convey the private information of his love for her. Giving cash 
shows that he isn’t even bothering to try.
The signaling theory of gift giving is consistent with another observation: Peo-
ple care most about the custom when the strength of affection is most in question. 
Thus, giving cash to a girlfriend or boyfriend is usually a bad move. But when col-
lege students receive a check from their parents, they are less often offended. The 
parents’ love is less likely to be in doubt, so the recipient probably won’t interpret 
the cash gift as a signal of insufficient affection. ●
22-1d Screening to Uncover Private Information
When an informed party takes actions to reveal private information, the phenom-
enon is called signaling. When an uninformed party takes actions to induce the 
 informed party to reveal private information, the phenomenon is called screening.
Some screening is common sense. A person buying a used car may ask that it 
be checked by an auto mechanic before the sale. A seller who refuses this request 
reveals his private information that the car is a lemon. The buyer may decide to 
offer a lower price or to look for another car.
Other examples of screening are more subtle. For example, consider a firm that 
sells car insurance. The firm would like to charge a low premium to safe driv-
ers and a high premium to risky drivers. But how can it tell them apart? Drivers 
know whether they are safe or risky, but the risky ones won’t admit it. A driver’s 
history is one piece of information (which insurance companies in fact use), but 
because of the intrinsic randomness of car accidents, history is an imperfect indi-
cator of future risk.
The insurance company might be able to sort out the two kinds of drivers by 
offering different insurance policies that would induce the drivers to separate 
themselves. One policy would have a high premium and cover the full cost of 
any accidents that occur. Another policy would have low premiums but would 
have, say, a $1,000 deductible. (That is, the driver would be responsible for the 
first $1,000 of damage, and the insurance company would cover the remaining 
risk.) Notice that the deductible is more of a burden for risky drivers because they 
are more likely to have an accident. Thus, with a large enough deductible, the 
low-premium policy with a deductible would attract the safe drivers, while the 
high-premium policy without a deductible would attract the risky drivers. Faced 
with these two policies, the two kinds of drivers would reveal their private infor-
mation by choosing different insurance policies.
22-1e Asymmetric Information and Public Policy
We have examined two kinds of asymmetric information: moral hazard and 
 adverse selection. And we have seen how individuals may respond to the prob-
lem with signaling or screening. Now let’s consider what the study of asymmetric 
information suggests about the proper scope of public policy.

CHAPTER 22   FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
The tension between market success and market failure is central in microeco-
nomics. We learned in Chapter 7 that the equilibrium of supply and demand is 
efficient in the sense that it maximizes the total surplus that society can obtain 
in a market. Adam Smith’s invisible hand seemed to reign supreme. This con-
clusion was then tempered with the study of externalities (Chapter 10), public 
goods (Chapter 11), imperfect competition (Chapters 15 through 17), and poverty 
(Chapter 20). In those chapters, we saw that government can sometimes improve 
market outcomes.
The study of asymmetric information gives us a new reason to be wary of 
markets. When some people know more than others, the market may fail to put  
resources to their best use. People with high-quality used cars may have trou-
ble selling them because buyers will be afraid of getting a lemon. People with 
few health problems may have trouble getting low-cost health insurance because 
insurance companies lump them together with those who have significant (but 
hidden) health problems.
Asymmetric information may call for government action in some cases, but 
three facts complicate the issue. First, as we have seen, the private market can 
sometimes deal with information asymmetries on its own using a combination 
of signaling and screening. Second, the government rarely has more information 
than the private parties. Even if the market’s allocation of resources is not ideal, it 
may be the best that can be achieved. That is, when there are information asym-
metries, policymakers may find it hard to improve upon the market’s admittedly 
imperfect outcome. Third, the government is itself an imperfect institution—a 
topic we take up in the next section.
QuickQuiz
A person who buys a life insurance policy pays a certain amount per year 
and receives for his family a much larger payment in the event of his 
death. Would you expect buyers of life insurance to have higher or lower death rates than the 
average person? How might this be an example of moral hazard? Of adverse selection? How 
might a life insurance company deal with these problems?
22-2 Political Economy
As we have seen, markets left on their own do not always reach a desirable allo-
cation of resources. When we judge the market’s outcome to be either inefficient 
or inequitable, there may be a role for the government to step in and improve the 
situation. Yet before we embrace an activist government, we need to consider one 
more fact: The government is also an imperfect institution. The field of political 
economy (sometimes called the field of public choice) uses the methods of eco-
nomics to study how government works.
22-2a The Condorcet Voting Paradox
Most advanced societies rely on democratic principles to set government policy. 
When a city is deciding between two locations to build a new park, for example, 
we have a simple way to choose: The majority gets its way. Yet for most policy 
issues, the number of possible outcomes far exceeds two. A new park could be 
placed in many possible locations. In this case, as the 18th-century French polit-
ical theorist Marquis de Condorcet famously noted, democracy might run into 
some problems trying to choose the best outcome.

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
For example, suppose there are three possible outcomes, labeled A, B, and C, 
and there are three voter types with the preferences shown in Table 1. The mayor 
of our town wants to aggregate these individual preferences into preferences for 
society as a whole. How should he do it?
At first, he might try some pairwise votes. If he asks voters to choose first 
between B and C, voter types 1 and 2 will vote for B, giving B the majority. If he 
then asks voters to choose between A and B, voter types 1 and 3 will vote for A, 
giving A the majority. Observing that A beats B, and B beats C, the mayor might 
conclude that A is the voters’ clear choice.
But wait: Suppose the mayor then asks voters to choose between A and C. In 
this case, voter types 2 and 3 vote for C, giving C the majority. That is, under pair-
wise majority voting, A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. Normally, we expect 
preferences to exhibit a property called transitivity: If A is preferred to B, and B 
is preferred to C, then we would expect A to be preferred to C. The Condorcet 
paradox is that democratic outcomes do not always obey this property. Pairwise 
voting might produce transitive preferences for society in some cases, but as our 
example in the table shows, it cannot be counted on to do so.
One implication of the Condorcet paradox is that the order in which things are 
voted on can affect the result. If the mayor suggests choosing first between A and 
B and then comparing the winner to C, the town ends up choosing C. But if the 
voters choose first between B and C and then compare the winner to A, the town 
ends up with A. And if the voters choose first between A and C and then compare 
the winner to B, the town ends up with B.
The Condorcet paradox teaches two lessons. The narrow lesson is that when 
there are more than two options, setting the agenda (that is, deciding the order in 
which items are voted on) can have a powerful influence over the outcome of a 
democratic election. The broad lesson is that majority voting by itself does not tell 
us what outcome a society really wants.
22-2b Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem
Since political theorists first noticed Condorcet’s paradox, they have spent much 
energy studying existing voting systems and proposing new ones. For example, 
as an alternative to pairwise majority voting, the mayor of our town could ask 
each voter to rank the possible outcomes. For each voter, we could give 1 point 
for last place, 2 points for second to last, 3 points for third to last, and so on. The 
outcome that receives the most total points wins. With the preferences in Table 1, 
outcome B is the winner. (You can do the arithmetic yourself.) This voting method 
is called a Borda count for the 18th-century French mathematician and political

theorist, Jean-Charles de Borda, who devised it. It is often used in polls that rank 
sports teams.
Is there a perfect voting system? Economist Kenneth Arrow took up this ques-
tion in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values. Arrow started by defining 
what a perfect voting system would be. He assumes that individuals in society 
have preferences over the various possible outcomes: A, B, C, and so on. He then 
assumes that society wants a voting system to choose among these outcomes that 
satisfies several properties:
• Unanimity: If everyone prefers A to B, then A should beat B.
• Transitivity: If A beats B, and B beats C, then A should beat C.
• Independence of irrelevant alternatives: The ranking between any two out-
comes A and B should not depend on whether some third outcome C is also 
available.
• No dictators: There is no person who always gets his way, regardless of every-
one else’s preferences.
These all seem like desirable properties of a voting system. Yet Arrow proved, 
mathematically and incontrovertibly, that no voting system can satisfy all these prop-
erties. This amazing result is called Arrow’s impossibility theorem.
The mathematics needed to prove Arrow’s theorem is beyond the scope of this 
book, but we can get some sense of why the theorem is true from a couple of 
examples. We have already seen the problem with the method of majority rule. 
The Condorcet paradox shows that majority rule fails to produce a ranking of out-
comes that always satisfies transitivity. 
As another example, the Borda count fails to satisfy the independence of irrel-
evant alternatives. Recall that, using the preferences in Table 1, outcome B wins 
with a Borda count. But suppose that suddenly C disappears as an alternative. 
If the Borda count method is applied only to outcomes A and B, then A wins. 
(Once again, you can do the arithmetic on your own.) Thus, eliminating alter-
native C changes the ranking between A and B. This change occurs because the 
result of the Borda count depends on the number of points that A and B receive, 
and the number of points depends on whether the irrelevant alternative, C, is also 
available.
Arrow’s impossibility theorem is a deep and disturbing result. It doesn’t say 
that we should abandon democracy as a form of government. But it does say that 
no matter what voting system society adopts for aggregating the preferences of its 
members, it will in some way be flawed as a mechanism for social choice.
22-2c The Median Voter Is King
Despite Arrow’s theorem, voting is how most societies choose their leaders and 
public policies, often by majority rule. The next step in studying government is 
to examine how governments run by majority rule work. That is, in a democratic 
society, who determines what policy is chosen? In some cases, the theory of dem-
ocratic government yields a surprisingly simple answer. 
Let’s consider an example. Imagine that society is deciding how much money 
to spend on some public good, such as the army or the national parks. Each voter 
has his own most preferred budget, and he always prefers outcomes closer to his 
most preferred value to outcomes farther away. Thus, we can line up voters from 
those who prefer the smallest budget to those who prefer the largest. Figure 1 is 
an example. Here there are 100 voters, and the budget size varies from zero to $20

billion. Given these preferences, what outcome would you expect democracy to 
produce?
According to a famous result called the median voter theorem, majority rule 
will produce the outcome most preferred by the median voter. The median voter is 
the voter exactly in the middle of the distribution. In this example, if you take the 
line of voters ordered by their preferred budgets and count 50 voters from either 
end of the line, you will find that the median voter wants a budget of $10 billion. 
By contrast, the average preferred outcome (calculated by adding the preferred 
outcomes and dividing by the number of voters) is $9 billion, and the modal out-
come (the one preferred by the greatest number of voters) is $15 billion.
The median voter rules the day because his preferred outcome beats any other 
proposal in a two-way race. In our example, more than half the voters want $10 
billion or more, and more than half want $10 billion or less. If someone proposes, 
say, $8 billion instead of $10 billion, everyone who prefers $10 billion or more 
will vote with the median voter. Similarly, if someone proposes $12 billion instead 
of $10 billion, everyone who wants $10 billion or less will vote with the median 
voter. In either case, the median voter has more than half the voters on his side.
What about the Condorcet voting paradox? It turns out that when the voters 
are picking a point along a line and each voter aims for his own most preferred 
point, the Condorcet paradox cannot arise. The median voter’s most preferred 
outcome beats all challengers.
One implication of the median voter theorem is that if two political parties are 
each trying to maximize their chance of election, they will both move their posi-
tions toward the median voter. Suppose, for example, that the Democratic Party 
advocates a budget of $15 billion, while the Republican Party advocates a budget 
of $10 billion. The Democratic position is more popular in the sense that $15 bil-
lion has more proponents than any other single choice. Nonetheless, the Republi-
cans get more than 50 percent of the vote: They will attract the 20 voters who want 
$10 billion, the 15 voters who want $5 billion, and the 25 voters who want zero.

CHAPTER 22   FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
If the Democrats want to win, they will move their platform toward the median 
voter. Thus, this theory can explain why the parties in a two-party system are sim-
ilar to each other: They are both moving toward the median voter.
Another implication of the median voter theorem is that minority views are 
not given much weight. Imagine that 40 percent of the population want a lot of 
money spent on the national parks and 60 percent want nothing spent. In this 
case, the median voter’s preference is zero, regardless of the intensity of the mi-
nority’s view. Rather than reaching a compromise that takes everyone’s prefer-
ences into account, majority rule looks only to the person in the exact middle of 
the distribution. Such is the logic of democracy.
22-2d Politicians Are People Too
When economists study consumer behavior, they assume that consumers buy the 
bundle of goods and services that gives them the greatest level of satisfaction. 
When economists study firm behavior, they assume that firms produce the quan-
tity of goods and services that yields the greatest level of profits. What should 
they assume when they study people involved in the practice of politics?
Politicians also have objectives. It would be nice to assume that political lead-
ers are always looking out for the well-being of society as a whole, that they are 
aiming for an optimal combination of efficiency and equality. Nice, perhaps, but 
not realistic. Self-interest is as powerful a motive for political actors as it is for 
consumers and firm owners. Some politicians, motivated by a desire for reelec-
tion, are willing to sacrifice the national interest to solidify their base of voters. 
Others are motivated by simple greed. If you have any doubt, you should look 
at the world’s poor nations, where corruption among government officials is a 
common impediment to economic development.
This book is not the place to develop a theory of political behavior. But when 
thinking about economic policy, remember that this policy is made not by a 
benevolent king (or even by benevolent economists) but by real people with their 
own all-too-human desires. Sometimes they are motivated to further the national 
interest, but sometimes they are motivated by their own political and financial 
ambitions. We shouldn’t be surprised when economic policy fails to resemble the 
ideals derived in economics textbooks.

A public school district is deciding on the school budget and the resulting

a ratio of 9:1, 25 percent want a ratio of 10:1, 15 percent want a ratio of 11:1, and 
40  percent want a ratio of 12:1. If the district uses majority-rule voting, what outcome 
would you expect the district to end up with? Explain.
22-3 Behavioral Economics
Economics is a study of human behavior, but it is not the only field that can make 
that claim. The social science of psychology also sheds light on the choices that 
people make in their lives. The fields of economics and psychology usually pro-
ceed independently, in part because they address a different range of questions. 
But recently, a field called behavioral economics has emerged in which econo-
mists are making use of basic psychological insights. Let’s consider some of these 
insights here.

22-3a People Aren’t Always Rational
Economic theory is populated by a particular species of organism, sometimes called 
Homo economicus. Members of this species are always rational. As firm owners, they 
maximize profits. As consumers, they maximize utility (or equivalently, pick the point 
on the highest indifference curve). Given the constraints they face, they rationally 
weigh all the costs and benefits and always choose the best possible course of action.
Real people, however, are Homo sapiens. Although in many ways they resemble 
the rational, calculating people assumed in economic theory, they are far more 
complex. They can be forgetful, impulsive, confused, emotional, and shortsighted. 
These imperfections of human reasoning are the bread and butter of psycholo-
gists, but until recently, economists have neglected them.
Herbert Simon, one of the first social scientists to work at the boundary of eco-
nomics and psychology, suggested that humans should be viewed not as ratio-
nal maximizers but as satisficers. Instead of always choosing the best course of  
action, they make decisions that are merely good enough. Similarly, other econ-
omists have suggested that humans are only “near rational” or that they exhibit 
“bounded rationality.”
Studies of human decision making have tried to detect systematic mistakes 
that people make. Here are a few of the findings:
• People are overconfident. Imagine that you were asked some numerical ques-
tions, such as the number of African countries in the United Nations, the 
height of the tallest mountain in North America, and so on. Instead of being 
asked for a single estimate, however, you were asked to give a 90 percent 
confidence interval—a range such that you were 90 percent confident the 
true number falls within it. When psychologists run experiments like this, 
they find that most people give ranges that are too small: The true number 
falls within their intervals far less than 90 percent of the time. That is, most 
people are too sure of their own abilities.
• People give too much weight to a small number of vivid observations. Imagine that 
you are thinking about buying a car of brand X. To learn about its reliability, 
you read Consumer Reports, which has surveyed 1,000 owners of car X. Then 
you run into a friend who owns car X, and he tells you that his car is a lemon. 
How do you treat your friend’s observation? If you think rationally, you will 
realize that he has only increased your sample size from 1,000 to 1,001, which 
does not provide much new information. But because your friend’s story is 
so vivid, you may be tempted to give it more weight in your decision making 
than you should.
• People are reluctant to change their minds. People tend to interpret evidence to 
confirm beliefs they already hold. In one study, subjects were asked to read 
and evaluate a research report on whether capital punishment deters crime. 
After reading the report, those who initially favored the death penalty said 
they were more certain of their view, and those who initially opposed the 
death penalty also said they were more certain of their view. The two groups 
interpreted the same evidence in exactly opposite ways. This behavior is 
sometimes called confirmation bias.
Think about decisions you have made in your own life. Do you exhibit some of 
these traits?
A hotly debated issue is whether deviations from rationality are important for 
understanding economic phenomena. An intriguing example arises in the study 
of 401(k) plans, the tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts that some firms

offer their workers. In some firms, workers can choose to participate in the plan 
by filling out a simple form. In other firms, workers are automatically enrolled 
and can opt out of the plan by filling out a simple form. It turns out many more 
workers participate in the second case than in the first. If workers were perfectly 
rational maximizers, they would choose the optimal amount of retirement sav-
ing, regardless of the default offered by their employer. In fact, workers’ behavior 
appears to exhibit substantial inertia. Understanding their behavior seems easier 
once we abandon the model of rational man.
Why, you might ask, is economics built on the rationality assumption when 
psychology and common sense cast doubt on it? One answer is that the assump-
tion, even if not exactly true, may be true enough that it yields reasonably accu-
rate models of behavior. For example, when we studied the differences between 
competitive and monopoly firms, the assumption that firms rationally maximize 
profit yielded many important and valid insights. Incorporating complex psycho-
logical deviations from rationality into the story might have added realism, but 
it also would have muddied the waters and made those insights harder to find. 
Recall from Chapter 2 that economic models are not meant to replicate reality but 
are supposed to show the essence of the problem at hand.
Another reason economists often assume rationality may be that economists 
are themselves not rational maximizers. Like most people, they are overconfident 
and reluctant to change their minds. Their choice among alternative theories of 
human behavior may exhibit excessive inertia. Moreover, economists may be con-
tent with a theory that is not perfect but is good enough. The model of rational 
man may be the theory of choice for a satisficing social scientist.
22-3b People Care about Fairness 
Another insight about human behavior is best illustrated with an experiment 
called the ultimatum game. The game works like this: Two volunteers (who are 
otherwise strangers to each other) are told that they are going to play a game and 
could win a total of $100. Before they play, they learn the rules. The game begins 
with a coin toss, which is used to assign the volunteers to the roles of player A and 
player B. Player A’s job is to propose a division of the $100 prize between himself 
and the other player. After player A makes his proposal, player B decides whether 
to accept or reject it. If he accepts it, both players are paid according to the pro-
posal. If player B rejects the proposal, both players walk away with nothing. In 
either case, the game then ends.
Before proceeding, stop and think about what you would do in this situation. 
If you were player A, what division of the $100 would you propose? If you were 
player B, what proposals would you accept?
Conventional economic theory assumes in this situation that people are ratio-
nal wealth maximizers. This assumption leads to a simple prediction: Player A 
should propose that he gets $99 and player B gets $1, and player B should accept 
the proposal. After all, once the proposal is made, player B is better off accepting 
it as long as he gets something out of it. Moreover, because player A knows that 
accepting the proposal is in player B’s interest, player A has no reason to offer him 
more than $1. In the language of game theory (discussed in Chapter 17), the 99–1 
split is the Nash equilibrium.
Yet when experimental economists ask real people to play the ultimatum 
game, the results differ from this prediction. People in player B’s role usually 
reject proposals that give them only $1 or a similarly small amount. Anticipating 
this, people in the role of player A usually propose giving player B much more 
than $1. Some people will offer a 50–50 split, but it is more common for player A

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
to propose giving player B an amount such as $30 or $40, keeping the larger share 
for himself. In this case, player B usually accepts the proposal.
What’s going on here? The natural interpretation is that people are driven in part 
by some innate sense of fairness. A 99–1 split seems so wildly unfair to many people 
that they reject it, even to their own detriment. By contrast, a 70–30 split is still unfair, 
but it is not so unfair that it induces people to abandon their normal self-interest.
Throughout our study of household and firm behavior, the innate sense of fair-
ness has not played any role. But the results of the ultimatum game suggest that 
A leading behavioral economist makes 
the case for his field.
The Importance of Irrelevance
By Richard H. Thaler
E
arly in my teaching career I managed to get 
most of the students in my class mad at me. 
A midterm exam caused the problem.
I wanted the exam to sort out the stars, 
the average Joes and the duds, so it had to be 
hard and have a wide dispersion of scores. I 
succeeded in writing such an exam, but when 
the students got their results they were in an 
uproar. Their principal complaint was that the 
average score was only 72 points out of 100.
What was odd about this reaction was that I 
had already explained that the average numer-
ical score on the exam had absolutely no effect 
on the distribution of letter grades. We employed 
a curve in which the average grade was a B+, 
and only a tiny number of students received 
grades below a C. I told the class this, but it 
had no effect on the students’ mood. They still 
hated my exam, and they were none too happy 
with me either. As a young professor worried 
about keeping my job, I wasn’t sure what to do.
Finally, an idea occurred to me. On the next 
exam, I raised the points available for a perfect 
score to 137. This exam turned out to be harder 
than the first. Students got only 70 percent of the 
answers right but the average numerical score was 
96 points. The students were delighted!
I chose 137 as a maximum score for two 
reasons. First, it produced an average well into 
the 90s, and some students scored above 100, 
generating a reaction approaching ecstasy. 
Second, because dividing by 137 is not easy to 
do in your head, I figured that most students 
wouldn’t convert their scores into percentages.
Striving for full disclosure, in subsequent 
years I included this statement in my course 
syllabus: “Exams will have a total of 137 points 
rather than the usual 100. This scoring system 
has no effect on the grade you get in the course, 
but it seems to make you happier.” And, indeed, 
after I made that change, I never got a com-
plaint that my exams were too hard.
In the eyes of an economist, my students 
were “misbehaving.” By that I mean that their 
behavior was inconsistent with the idealized 
model at the heart of much of economics.  
Rationally, no one should be happier about a 
score of 96 out of 137 (70 percent) than 72 out 
of 100, but my students were. And by realizing 
this, I was able to set the kind of exam I wanted 
but still keep the students from grumbling.
This illustrates an important problem with 
traditional economic theory. Economists dis-
count any factors that would not influence the 
thinking of a rational person. These things are 
supposedly irrelevant. But unfortunately for the 
theory, many supposedly irrelevant factors do 
matter.
Economists create this problem with their 
insistence on studying mythical creatures of-
ten known as Homo economicus. I prefer to call 
them “Econs”—highly intelligent beings that 
are capable of making the most complex of 
calculations but are totally lacking in emotions. 
Think of Mr. Spock in “Star Trek.” In a world of 
Econs, many things would in fact be irrelevant.
No Econ would buy a larger portion of what-
ever will be served for dinner on Tuesday because 
he happens to be hungry when shopping on Sun-
day. Your hunger on Sunday should be irrelevant in 
choosing the size of your meal for Tuesday. An Econ 
would not finish that huge meal on Tuesday, even 
though he is no longer hungry, just because he had 
paid for it. To an Econ, the price paid for an item 
in the past is not relevant in making the decision 
about how much of it to eat now.
An Econ would not expect a gift on the day of 
the year in which she happened to get married, or 
be born. What difference do these arbitrary dates 
make? In fact, Econs would be perplexed by the 
idea of gifts. An Econ would know that cash is 
the best possible gift; it allows the recipient to 
buy whatever is optimal. But unless you are mar-
ried to an economist, I don’t advise giving cash  
on your next anniversary. Come to think of it, 
even if your spouse is an economist, this is not 
a great idea.
Of course, most economists know that the 
people with whom they interact do not resemble 
Econs. In fact, in private moments, economists are 
often happy to admit that most of the people they 
know are clueless about economic matters. But for  
decades, this realization did not affect the way most 
economists did their work. They had a justification:

CHAPTER 22   FRONTIERS OF MICROECONOMICS
perhaps it should. For example, in Chapters 18 and 19, we discussed how wages 
were determined by labor supply and labor demand. Some economists have sug-
gested that the perceived fairness of what a firm pays its workers should also 
enter the picture. Thus, when a firm has an especially profitable year, workers 
(like player B) may expect to be paid a fair share of the prize, even if the standard 
equilibrium does not dictate it. The firm (like player A) might well decide to give 
workers more than the equilibrium wage for fear that the workers might other-
wise try to punish the firm with reduced effort, strikes, or even vandalism.
markets. To defenders of economics orthodoxy, mar-
kets are thought to have magic powers.
There is a version of this magic market argu-
ment that I call the invisible hand wave. It goes 
something like this. “Yes, it is true that my spouse 
and my students and members of Congress don’t 
understand anything about economics, but when 
they have to interact with markets . . . .” It is at 
this point that the hand waving comes in. Words 
and phrases such as high stakes, learning and 
arbitrage are thrown around to suggest some of 
the ways that markets can do their magic, but it 
is my claim that no one has ever finished making 
the argument with both hands remaining still.
Hand waving is required because there is 
nothing in the workings of markets that turns 
otherwise normal human beings into Econs. For 
example, if you choose the wrong career, select 
the wrong mortgage or fail to save for retire-
ment, markets do not correct those failings. 
In fact, quite the opposite often happens. It is 
much easier to make money by catering to con-
sumers’ biases than by trying to correct them.
Perhaps because of undue acceptance of invis-
ible-hand-wave arguments, economists have been 
ignoring supposedly irrelevant factors, comforted 
by the knowledge that in markets these factors just 
wouldn’t matter. Alas, both the field of econom-
ics and society are much worse for it. Supposedly 
irrelevant factors, or SIFs, matter a lot, and if we 
economists recognize their importance, we can do 
our jobs better. Behavioral economics is, to a large 
extent, standard economics that has been modified 
to incorporate SIFs.
SIFs matter in more important domains than 
keeping students happy with test scores. Consider 
defined-contribution retirement plans like 401(k)’s. 
Econs would have no trouble figuring out how much 
to save for retirement and how to invest the money, 
but mere humans can find it quite tough. So knowl-
edgeable employers have incorporated three SIFs in 
their plan design: they automatically enroll employ-
ees (who can opt out), they automatically increase 
the saving rate every year, and they offer a sensible 
default investment choice like a target date fund. 
These features significantly improve the outcomes 
of plan participants, but to economists they are 
SIFs because Econs would just figure out the right 
thing to do without them.
These retirement plans also have a suppos-
edly relevant factor: Contributions and capital 
appreciation are tax-sheltered until retirement. 
This tax break was created to induce people to 
save more. But guess what: A recent study using 
Danish data has compared the relative effec-
tiveness of the SIFs and a similar tax subsidy 
offered in Denmark. The authors attribute only  
1 percent of the saving done in the Danish plans 
to the tax breaks. The other 99 percent comes from 
the automatic features.
They conclude: “In sum, the findings of our 
study call into question whether tax subsidies 
are the most effective policy to increase retire-
ment savings. Automatic enrollment or default 
policies that nudge individuals to save more 
could have larger impacts on national saving at 
lower social cost.” Irrelevant indeed!
Notice that the irrelevant design features 
that do all the work are essentially free, whereas 
a tax break is quite expensive. The Joint Eco-
nomic Committee estimates that the United 
States tax break will cost the government $62 
billion in 2015, a number that is predicted to 
grow rapidly. Furthermore, most of these tax 
benefits accrue to affluent taxpayers.
Here is another example. In the early years 
of the Obama administration, Congress passed 
a law giving taxpayers a temporary tax cut and 
the administration had to decide how to carry 
it out. Should taxpayers be given a lump sum 
check, or should the extra money be spread out 
over the year via regular paychecks?
In a world of Econs this choice would be 
irrelevant. A $1,200 lump sum would have the 
same effect on consumption as monthly pay-
checks that are $100 larger. But while most 
middle-class taxpayers spend almost their 
entire paycheck every month, if given a lump 
sum they are more likely to save some of it or 
pay off debts. Since the tax cut was intended to 
stimulate spending, I believe the administration 
made a wise choice in choosing to spread it out.
The field of behavioral economics has been 
around for more than three decades, but the 
application of its findings to societal problems 
has only recently been catching on. Fortunately, 
economists open to new ways of thinking are 
finding novel ways to use supposedly irrelevant 
factors to make the world a better place. ■

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
22-3c People Are Inconsistent over Time
Imagine some dreary task, such as doing your laundry, shoveling snow off your 
driveway, or filling out your income tax forms. Now consider the following 
questions:
 1. Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task right now or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task tomorrow?
 2. Would you prefer (A) to spend 50 minutes doing the task in 90 days or (B) to 
spend 60 minutes doing the task in 91 days?
When asked questions like these, many people choose B for question 1 and A for 
question 2. When looking ahead to the future (as in question 2), they minimize the 
amount of time spent on the dreary task. But faced with the prospect of doing the 
task immediately (as in question 1), they choose to put it off.
In some ways, this behavior is not surprising: Everyone procrastinates from 
time to time. But from the standpoint of the theory of rational man, it is puzzling. 
Suppose that in response to question 2, a person chooses to spend 50 minutes in 
90 days. Then, when the 90th day arrives, we allow him to change his mind. In 
effect, he then faces question 1, so he opts for doing the task the next day. But why 
should the mere passage of time affect the choices he makes?
Many times in life, people make plans for themselves, but then they fail to  
follow through. A smoker promises himself that he will quit, but within a few 
hours of smoking his last cigarette, he craves another and breaks his promise.  
A person trying to lose weight promises that he will stop eating dessert, but 
when the waiter brings the dessert cart, the diet goes out the window. In both 
cases, the desire for instant gratification induces the decision maker to abandon 
his past plans.
Some economists believe that the consumption–saving decision is an import-
ant instance in which people exhibit this inconsistency over time. For many peo-
ple, spending provides a type of instant gratification. Saving, like passing up the 
cigarette or the dessert, requires a sacrifice in the present for a reward in the dis-
tant future. And just as many smokers wish they could quit and many overweight 
individuals wish they ate less, many consumers wish they saved more of their in-
come. According to one survey, 76 percent of Americans said they were not saving 
enough for retirement.
An implication of this inconsistency over time is that people should try to find 
ways to commit their future selves to following through on their plans. A smoker 
trying to quit may throw away his cigarettes, and a person on a diet may put a 
lock on the refrigerator. What can a person who saves too little do? He should find 
some way to lock up his money before he spends it. Some retirement accounts, 
such as 401(k) plans, do exactly that. A worker can agree to have some money 
taken out of his paycheck before he ever sees it. The money is deposited in an 
account that can be used before retirement only with a penalty. Perhaps that is one 
reason these retirement accounts are so popular: They protect people from their 
own desires for instant gratification.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
22-4 Conclusion
This chapter examined the frontier of microeconomics. You may have noticed that 
we sketched out ideas rather than fully developing them. This is no accident. One 
reason is that you might study these topics in more detail in advanced courses. 
Another reason is that these topics remain active areas of research and, therefore, 
are still being fleshed out.
To see how these topics fit into the broader picture, recall the Ten Principles of 
Economics from Chapter 1. One principle states that markets are usually a good 
way to organize economic activity. Another principle states that governments can 
sometimes improve market outcomes. As you study economics, you can more 
fully appreciate the truth of these principles as well as the caveats that go with 
them. The study of asymmetric information should make you more wary of mar-
ket outcomes. The study of political economy should make you more wary of 
government solutions. And the study of behavioral economics should make you 
wary of any institution that relies on human decision making, including both the 
market and the government.
If there is a unifying theme to these topics, it is that life is messy. Information 
is imperfect, government is imperfect, and people are imperfect. Of course, you 
knew this long before you started studying economics, but economists need to 
understand these imperfections as precisely as they can if they are to explain, and 
perhaps even improve, the world around them.

PART VII   TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
• In many economic transactions, information is asym-
metric. When there are hidden actions, principals may 
be concerned that agents suffer from the problem of 
moral hazard. When there are hidden characteris-
tics, buyers may be concerned about the problem of 
adverse selection among the sellers. Private markets 
sometimes deal with asymmetric information with sig-
naling and screening.
• Although government policy can sometimes improve 
market outcomes, governments are themselves imper-
fect institutions. The Condorcet paradox shows that 
majority rule fails to produce transitive preferences for 
society, and Arrow’s impossibility theorem shows that 
no voting system will be perfect. In many situations, 
democratic institutions will produce the outcome  
desired by the median voter, regardless of the prefer-
ences of the rest of the electorate. Moreover, the indi-
viduals who set government policy may be motivated 
by self-interest rather than the national interest.
• The study of psychology and economics reveals that 
human decision making is more complex than is  
assumed in conventional economic theory. People are 
not always rational, they care about the fairness of eco-
nomic outcomes (even to their own detriment), and 
they can be inconsistent over time.

Buying a DVD costs $15, which the roommates split 
equally, so each pays $3 per movie.
a. What is the efficient number of movies to watch 
(that is, the number that maximizes total surplus)?
b. From the standpoint of each roommate, what is 
the preferred number of movies?
c. What is the preference of the median roommate?
d. If the roommates held a vote on the efficient out-
come versus the median voter’s preference, how 
would each person vote? Which outcome would 
get a majority?
e. If one of the roommates proposed a different 
number of movies, could his proposal beat the 
winner from part (d) in a vote?
f. Can majority rule be counted on to reach efficient 
outcomes in the provision of public goods?
9. Two ice-cream stands are deciding where to set 
up along a 1-mile beach. The people are uniformly 
 located along the beach, and each person sitting on the 
beach buys exactly 1 ice-cream cone per day from the 
nearest stand. Each ice-cream seller wants the maxi-
mum number of customers. Where along the beach 
will the two stands locate? Of which result in this 
chapter does this outcome remind you?
10. The government is considering two ways to help the 
needy: giving them cash or giving them free meals at 
soup kitchens. 
a. Give an argument, based on the standard theory 
of the rational consumer, for giving cash. 
b. Give an argument, based on asymmetric informa-
tion, for why the soup kitchen may be better than 
the cash handout.
c. Give an argument, based on behavioral econom-
ics, for why the soup kitchen may be better than 
the cash handout.

hen you finish school and start looking for a full-time job, your experience 
will, to a large extent, be shaped by prevailing economic conditions. In 
some years, firms throughout the economy are expanding their production 
of goods and services, employment is rising, and jobs are easy to find. In other 
years, firms are cutting back production, employment is declining, and finding a 
good job takes a long time. Not surprisingly, any college graduate would rather 
enter the labor force in a year of economic expansion than in a year of economic 
contraction.
Because the health of the overall economy profoundly affects all of us, 
changes in economic conditions are widely reported by the

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
media. Indeed, it is hard to pick up a newspaper, check an online news service, 
or turn on the TV without seeing some newly reported statistic about the econ-
omy. The statistic might measure the total income of everyone in the economy 
(gross domestic product, or GDP), the rate at which average prices are rising or 
falling (inflation/deflation), the percentage of the labor force that is out of work 
(unemployment), total spending at stores (retail sales), or the imbalance of trade 
between the United States and the rest of the world (the trade deficit). All these 
statistics are macroeconomic. Rather than telling us about a particular household, 
firm, or market, they tell us something about the entire economy. 
As you may recall from Chapter 2, economics is divided into two branches: 
 microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of how 
 individual households and firms make decisions and how they interact with one 
another in markets. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. 
The goal of macroeconomics is to explain the economic changes that affect many 
households, firms, and markets simultaneously. Macroeconomists address a broad 
variety of questions: Why is average income high in some countries and low in 
others? Why do prices sometimes rise rapidly while at other times they are more 
stable? Why do production and employment expand in some years and contract 
in others? What, if anything, can the government do to promote rapid growth in 
incomes, low inflation, and stable employment? These questions are all macroeco-
nomic in nature because they concern the workings of the entire economy.
Because the economy as a whole is a collection of many households and many 
firms interacting in many markets, microeconomics and macroeconomics are 
closely linked. The basic tools of supply and demand, for instance, are as central 
to macroeconomic analysis as they are to microeconomic analysis. Yet studying 
the economy in its entirety raises some new and intriguing challenges.
In this and the next chapter, we discuss some of the data that economists and 
policymakers use to monitor the performance of the overall economy. These data 
reflect the economic changes that macroeconomists try to explain. This chapter 
considers gross domestic product, which measures the total income of a nation. GDP 
is the most closely watched economic statistic because it is thought to be the sin-
gle best measure of a society’s economic well-being.
microeconomics
the study of how house-
holds and firms make 
decisions and how they

phenomena, including

and economic growth
23-1 The Economy’s Income and Expenditure
If you were to judge how a person is doing economically, you might first look at 
her income. A person with a high income can more easily afford life’s necessi-
ties and luxuries. It is no surprise that people with higher incomes enjoy higher 
standards of living—better housing, better healthcare, fancier cars, more opulent 
vacations, and so on. 
The same logic applies to a nation’s overall economy. When judging whether 
the economy is doing well or poorly, it is natural to look at the total income that 
everyone in the economy is earning. That is the task of gross domestic product. 
GDP measures two things at once: the total income of everyone in the economy and 
the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDP can per-
form the trick of measuring both total income and total expenditure because these two 
things are the same. For an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure.
Why is this true? An economy’s income is the same as its expenditure because 
every transaction has two parties: a buyer and a seller. Every dollar of spending 
by some buyer is a dollar of income for some seller. Suppose, for instance, that 
Karen pays Doug $100 to mow her lawn. In this case, Doug is a seller of a ser-
vice and Karen is a buyer. Doug earns $100 and Karen spends $100. Thus, the

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
transaction contributes equally to the economy’s income and to its expenditure. 
GDP, whether measured as total income or total expenditure, rises by $100.
Another way to see the equality of income and expenditure is with the circu-
lar-flow diagram in Figure 1. As you may recall from Chapter 2, this diagram 
describes all the transactions between households and firms in a simple econ-
omy. It simplifies matters by assuming that all goods and services are bought by 
households and that households spend all of their income. In this economy, when 
households buy goods and services from firms, these expenditures flow through 
the markets for goods and services. When the firms use the money they receive 
from sales to pay workers’ wages, landowners’ rent, and firm owners’ profit, this 
income flows through the markets for the factors of production. Money continu-
ously flows from households to firms and then back to households.
GDP measures this flow of money. We can compute it for this economy in one of 
two ways: by adding up the total expenditure by households or by adding up the total 
income (wages, rent, and profit) paid by firms. Because all expenditure in the economy 
ends up as someone’s income, GDP is the same regardless of how we compute it.
The actual economy is, of course, more complicated than the one illustrated 
in Figure 1. Households do not spend all of their income; they pay some of it to 
the government in taxes, and they save some for use in the future. In addition, 
households do not buy all goods and services produced in the economy; some 
goods and services are bought by governments, and some are bought by firms 
that plan to use them in the future to produce their own output. Yet the basic les-
son remains the same: Regardless of whether a household, government, or firm 
buys a good or service, the transaction always has a buyer and a seller. Thus, for 
the economy as a whole, expenditure and income are the same. 
QuickQuiz
What two things does GDP measure? How can it measure two things at once?
FIGURE 1
The Circular-Flow Diagram
Households buy goods and services 
from firms, and firms use their 
revenue from sales to pay wages to 
workers, rent to landowners, and profit 
to firm owners. GDP equals the total 
amount spent by households in the 
market for goods and services. It also 
equals the total wages, rent, and profit 
paid by firms in the markets for the 
factors of production.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
Having discussed the meaning of gross domestic product in general terms, let’s 
be more precise about how this statistic is measured. Here is a definition of GDP 
that focuses on GDP as a measure of total expenditure: 
r (SPTTEPNFTUJDQSPEVDU	(%1
 is the market value of all final goods and ser-
vices produced within a country in a given period of time.
This definition might seem simple enough. But in fact, many subtle issues arise 
when computing an economy’s GDP. Let’s therefore consider each phrase in this 
definition with some care.
23-2a “GDP Is the Market Value . . .”
You have probably heard the adage “You can’t compare apples and oranges.” Yet 
GDP does exactly that. GDP adds together many different kinds of products into a 
single measure of the value of economic activity. To do this, it uses market prices. 
Because market prices measure the amount people are willing to pay for different 
goods, they reflect the value of those goods. If the price of an apple is twice the 
price of an orange, then an apple contributes twice as much to GDP as does an 
orange. 
23-2b “. . . of All . . .”
GDP tries to be comprehensive. It includes all items produced in the economy and 
sold legally in markets. GDP measures the market value of not just apples and 
oranges but also pears and grapefruit, books and movies, haircuts and healthcare, 
and so on. 
GDP also includes the market value of the housing services provided by the 
economy’s stock of housing. For rental housing, this value is easy to calculate—
the rent equals both the tenant’s expenditure and the landlord’s income. Yet many 
people own their homes and, therefore, do not pay rent. The government includes 
this owner-occupied housing in GDP by estimating its rental value. In effect, 
GDP is based on the assumption that the owner is renting the house to herself. 
The  imputed rent is included both in the homeowner’s expenditure and in her 
 income, so it adds to GDP.
There are some products, however, that GDP excludes because measuring them 
is difficult. GDP excludes most items produced and sold illicitly, such as illegal 
drugs. It also excludes most items that are produced and consumed at home and, 
therefore, never enter the marketplace. Vegetables you buy at the grocery store are 
part of GDP; vegetables you grow in your garden are not.
These exclusions from GDP can at times lead to paradoxical results. For exam-
ple, when Karen pays Doug to mow her lawn, that transaction is part of GDP. But 
suppose Doug and Karen marry. Even though Doug may continue to mow Kar-
en’s lawn, the value of the mowing is now left out of GDP because Doug’s service 
is no longer sold in a market. Thus, their marriage reduces GDP.
23-2c “. . . Final . . .”
When International Paper makes paper, which Hallmark then uses to make a 
greeting card, the paper is called an intermediate good and the card is called a final 
good. GDP includes only the value of final goods. This is done because the value 
gross domestic product 
(GDP)
the market value of all 
final goods and services 
produced within a coun-
try in a given period of 
time

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
of intermediate goods is already included in the prices of the final goods. Adding 
the market value of the paper to the market value of the card would be double 
counting. That is, it would (incorrectly) count the paper twice. 
An important exception to this principle arises when an intermediate good is 
produced and, rather than being used, is added to a firm’s inventory of goods for 
use or sale at a later date. In this case, the intermediate good is taken to be “final” 
for the moment, and its value as inventory investment is included as part of GDP. 
Thus, additions to inventory add to GDP, and when the goods in inventory are 
later used or sold, the reductions in inventory subtract from GDP. 
23-2d “. . . Goods and Services . . .”
GDP includes both tangible goods (food, clothing, cars) and intangible services 
(haircuts, housecleaning, doctor visits). When you buy a CD by your favorite 
band, you are buying a good, and the purchase price is part of GDP. When you 
pay to hear a concert by the same band, you are buying a service, and the ticket 
price is also part of GDP.
23-2e “. . . Produced . . .”
GDP includes goods and services currently produced. It does not include transac-
tions involving items produced in the past. When Ford produces and sells a new 
car, the value of the car is included in GDP. But when one person sells a used car 
to another person, the value of the used car is not included in GDP.
23-2f “. . . Within a Country . . .”
GDP measures the value of production within the geographic confines of a coun-
try. When a Canadian citizen works temporarily in the United States, her produc-
tion is part of U.S. GDP. When an American citizen owns a factory in Haiti, the 
production at her factory is not part of U.S. GDP. (It is part of Haiti’s GDP.) Thus, 
items are included in a nation’s GDP if they are produced domestically, regardless 
of the nationality of the producer.
23-2g “. . . In a Given Period of Time.”
GDP measures the value of production that takes place within a specific interval 
of time. Usually, that interval is a year or a quarter (3 months). GDP measures the 
economy’s flow of income, as well as its flow of expenditure, during that interval.
When the government reports the GDP for a quarter, it usually presents GDP 
“at an annual rate.” This means that the figure reported for quarterly GDP is the 
amount of income and expenditure during the quarter multiplied by 4. The gov-
ernment uses this convention so that quarterly and annual figures on GDP can be 
compared more easily.
In addition, when the government reports quarterly GDP, it presents the data 
after they have been modified by a statistical procedure called seasonal adjustment. 
The unadjusted data show clearly that the economy produces more goods and 
services during some times of the year than during others. (As you might guess, 
December’s holiday shopping season is a high point.) When monitoring the con-
dition of the economy, economists and policymakers often want to look beyond 
these regular seasonal changes. Therefore, government statisticians adjust the 
quarterly data to take out the seasonal cycle. The GDP data reported in the news 
are always seasonally adjusted.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
Other Measures of Income
W
hen the U.S. Department of Commerce computes the nation’s GDP, 
it also computes various other measures of income to get a more 
complete picture of what’s happening in the economy. These other mea-
sures differ from GDP by excluding or including certain categories of 
income. What follows is a brief description of five of these income mea-
sures, ordered from largest to smallest.
t Gross national product (GNP) is the total income earned by a 
nation’s permanent residents (called nationals). It differs from 
GDP in that it includes income that our citizens earn abroad and 
excludes income that foreigners earn here. For example, when a 
Canadian citizen works temporarily in the United States, her pro-
duction is part of U.S. GDP, but it is not part of U.S. GNP. (It is part 
of Canada’s GNP.) For most countries, including the United States, 
domestic residents are responsible for most domestic production, 
so GDP and GNP are quite close.
t Net national product (NNP) is the total income of a nation’s residents 
(GNP) minus losses from depreciation. Depreciation is the wear and 
tear on the economy’s stock of equipment and structures, such as 
trucks rusting and old computer models becoming obsolete. In the 
national income accounts prepared by the Department of Commerce, 
depreciation is called the “consumption of fixed capital.”
t National income is the total income earned by a nation’s resi-
dents in the production of goods and services. It is almost iden-
tical to net national product. These two measures differ because 
of the statistical discrepancy that arises from problems in data 
collection.
t Personal income 
i s  t h e  i n c o m e 
that households 
and noncorporate 
 businesses receive. 
Unlike national  income, 
it excludes retained earnings, 
which is income that corporations have earned but have not paid 
out to their owners. It also subtracts indirect business taxes (such 
as sales taxes), corporate income taxes, and contributions for  
social insurance (mostly Social Security taxes). In addition, per-
sonal income includes the interest income that households receive 
from their holdings of government debt and the income that house-
holds receive from government transfer programs, such as welfare 
and Social Security.
t Disposable personal income is the income that households and 
noncorporate businesses have left after satisfying all their obli-
gations to the government. It equals personal income minus per-
sonal taxes and certain nontax payments (such as traffic tickets).
Although the various measures of income differ in detail, they  
almost always tell the same story about economic conditions. When GDP 
grows rapidly, these other measures of income usually grow rapidly. And 
when GDP falls, these other measures usually fall as well. For monitoring 
fluctuations in the overall economy, it does not matter much which mea-
sure of income we use. ■
FYI
e
Now let’s repeat the definition of GDP:
r Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and ser-
vices produced within a country in a given period of time.
This definition focuses on GDP as total expenditure in the economy. But don’t 
forget that every dollar spent by a buyer of a good or service becomes a dollar of 
income to the seller of that good or service. Therefore, in addition to applying this 
definition, the government adds up total income in the economy. The two ways 
of calculating GDP give almost exactly the same answer. (Why “almost”? The two 
measures should be precisely the same, but data sources are not perfect. The dif-
ference between the two calculations of GDP is called the statistical discrepancy.) 
It should be apparent that GDP is a sophisticated measure of the value of eco-
nomic activity. In advanced courses in macroeconomics, you will learn more 
about the subtleties that arise in its calculation. But even now you can see that 
each phrase in this definition is packed with meaning.

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
23-3 The Components of GDP
Spending in an economy takes many forms. At any moment, the Smith family 
may be having lunch at Burger King; Ford may be building a car factory; the 
U.S. Navy may be procuring a submarine; and British Airways may be buying 
an airplane from Boeing. GDP includes all of these various forms of spending on 
domestically produced goods and services.
To understand how the economy is using its scarce resources, economists 
study the composition of GDP among various types of spending. To do this, GDP 
(which we denote as Y) is divided into four components: consumption (C), invest-
ment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX):
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
This equation is an identity—an equation that must be true because of how the 
variables in the equation are defined. In this case, because each dollar of expendi-
ture included in GDP is placed into one of the four components of GDP, the total 
of the four components must be equal to GDP. Let’s look at each of these four 
components more closely.
23-3a Consumption
$POTVNQUJPO is spending by households on goods and services, with the excep-
tion of purchases of new housing. Goods include durable goods, such as automo-
biles and appliances, and nondurable goods, such as food and clothing. Services 
include such intangible items as haircuts and medical care. Household spending 
on education is also included in consumption of services (although one might  
argue that it would fit better in the next component). 
23-3b Investment
*OWFTUNFOU is the purchase of goods (called capital goods) that will be used in the 
future to produce more goods and services. Investment is the sum of purchases 
of business capital, residential capital, and inventories. Business capital includes 
business structures (such as a factory or office building), equipment (such as a 
worker’s computer), and intellectual property products (such as the software that 
runs the computer). Residential capital includes the landlord’s apartment build-
ing and a homeowner’s personal residence. By convention, the purchase of a new 
house is the one type of household spending categorized as investment rather 
than consumption.
As mentioned earlier, the treatment of inventory accumulation is noteworthy. 
When Apple produces a computer and adds it to its inventory instead of selling it, 
Apple is assumed to have “purchased” the computer for itself. That is, the national 
income accountants treat the computer as part of Apple’s investment spending. (If 
Apple later sells the computer out of inventory, Apple’s inventory investment will 
then be negative, offsetting the positive expenditure of the buyer.) Inventories are 
treated this way because one aim of GDP is to measure the value of the economy’s 
production, and goods added to inventory are part of that period’s production.
Notice that GDP accounting uses the word investment differently from how 
you might hear the term in everyday conversation. When you hear the word 
investment, you might think of financial investments, such as stocks, bonds, and 
mutual funds—topics that we study later in this book. By contrast, because GDP 
measures expenditure on goods and services, here the word investment means 
consumption

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
Some nations are debating what 
to include in their national income 
accounts.
No Sex, Please, We’re French
By Zachary Karabell 
T
he government of France has just made 
what on the face of it appears to be a 
nonannouncement announcement: It will 
not include illegal drugs and prostitution in 
its official calculation of the country’s gross  
domestic product.
What made the announcement odd was 
that it never has included such activities, nor 
have most countries. Nor do most governments 
announce what they do not plan to do. (“The 
U.S. government has no intention of sending 
a man to Venus.”) Yet the French decision 
comes in the wake of significant pressure from 
neighboring countries and from the European 
Union to integrate these activities into national 
accounts and economic output. That raises a 
host of questions: Should these activities be 
included, and if those are, why not others? And 
what exactly are we measuring—and why?
Few numbers shape our world today more 
than GDP. It has become the alpha and omega 
of national success, used by politicians and 
pundits as the primary gauge of national 
strength and treated as a numerical proxy for 
greatness or the lack thereof.
Yet GDP is only a statistic, replete with 
the limitations of all statistics. Created as 
an outgrowth of national accounts that were 
themselves only devised in the 1930s, GDP 
was never an all-inclusive measure, even as it 
is treated as such. Multiple areas of economic 
life were left out, including volunteer work and 
domestic work.
Now Eurostat, the official statistical 
agency of the European Union, is leading the 
drive to include a host of illegal activities in 
national calculations of GDP, most notably 
prostitution and illicit drugs. The argument, 
as a United Nations commission laid out in 
2008, is fairly simple: Prostitution and illicit 
drugs are significant economic activities, and 
if they’re not factored into economic statistics, 
then we’re looking at an incomplete picture—
which in turn will make it that much harder 
to craft smart policy. Additionally, different

services by local, state, 
and federal governments
purchases of goods (such as business capital, residential structures, and invento-
ries) that will be used to produce other goods and services in the future. 
23-3c Government Purchases
(PWFSONFOUQVSDIBTFT include spending on goods and services by local, state, 
and federal governments. It includes the salaries of government workers as well 
as expenditures on public works. Recently, the U.S. national income accounts have 
switched to the longer label government consumption expenditure and gross investment, 
but in this book, we will use the traditional and shorter term government purchases.
The meaning of government purchases requires a bit of clarification. When the 
government pays the salary of an Army general or a schoolteacher, that salary 
is part of government purchases. But when the government pays a Social Secu-
rity benefit to a person who is elderly or an unemployment insurance benefit to 
a worker who was recently laid off, the story is very different: These are called 
transfer payments because they are not made in exchange for a currently produced 
good or service. Transfer payments alter household income, but they do not 
reflect the economy’s production. (From a macroeconomic standpoint, transfer 
payments are like negative taxes.) Because GDP is intended to measure income 
from, and expenditure on, the production of goods and services, transfer pay-
ments are not counted as part of government purchases.

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
countries have different laws: In the Nether-
lands, for instance, prostitution is legal, as 
is marijuana. Those commercial transactions 
(or at least those that are recorded and taxed) 
are already part of Dutch GDP. Not including 
them in Italy’s or Spain’s GDPs can thus make 
it challenging to compare national numbers.
That is why Spain, Italy, Belgium, and the 
U.K. have in recent months moved to include 
illegal drugs and nonlicensed sex trade in their 
national accounts. The U.K. Office for National 
Statistics in particular approached its mandate 
with wonkish seriousness, publishing a 20-
page précis of its methodology that explained 
how it would, say, calculate the dollar amount 
of prostitution (police records help) or deal with 
domestically produced drugs versus imported 
drugs. The result, which will be formally an-
nounced in September, will be an additional 10 
billion pounds added to Great Britain’s GDP.
France, however, has demurred. A nation 
with a clichéd reputation for a certain savoir 
faire when it comes to sex and other nocturnal 
activities has decided (or at least its bureau-
crats have) that in spite of an EU directive, 
it will not calculate the effects of illegal  
activities that are often nonconsensual or 
nonvoluntary. That is clearly the case for some 
prostitution—one French minister stated that 
“street prostitution” is largely controlled by 
the Mafia—and the same could be reason-
ably said of the use of some hard drugs, given 
their addictive nature.
There is undeniably a strong moralistic 
component in the French decision. By aver-
ring that because they are not voluntary or 
consensual these exchanges should not be 
included in GDP, the French government is 
placing a moral vision of what society should 
be ahead of an economic vision of what soci-
ety is. That in turn makes an already messy 
statistic far messier, and that serves no one’s 
national interests. . . .
With all of GDP’s limitations, adding a 
new moral dimension would only make the 
number that much less useful. After all, why 
stop at not including prostitution because it 
degrades women? Why not refuse to measure 
coal production because it degrades the envi-
ronment? Why not leave out cigarette usage 
because it causes cancer? The list of possible 
exclusions on this basis is endless.
If GDP is our current best metric for national 
output, then at the very least it should attempt 
to include all measurable output. The usually 
moralistic United States has actually been 
 including legal prostitution in Nevada and now 
marijuana sales and consumption in Colorado, 
California, and Washington without any strong 
objections based solely on the argument that 
these are commercial exchanges that constitute 
this fuzzy entity we call “the economy.”…
Not measuring drugs and sex won’t make 
them go away, but it will hobble efforts to 
understand the messy latticework of our eco-
nomic lives, all in a futile attempt to excise 
what we do not like. ■

CASE 
STUDY
THE COMPONENTS OF U.S. GDP 
Table 1 shows the composition of U.S. GDP in 2015. In this year, the 
GDP of the United States was almost $18 trillion. Dividing this num-
ber by the 2015 U.S. population of 321 million yields GDP per person 
(sometimes called GDP per capita). In 2015 the income and expendi-
ture of the average American was $55,882.
Consumption made up 68 percent of GDP, or $38,218 per person. Investment 
was $9,402 per person. Government purchases were $9,919 per person. Net exports 
were −$1,657 per person. This number is negative because Americans spent more 
on foreign goods than foreigners spent on American goods.
to a buyer in another country, such as Boeing’s sale of an airplane to British Air-
ways, increases net exports.
The net in net exports refers to the fact that imports are subtracted from exports. 
This subtraction is made because other components of GDP include imports of 
goods and services. For example, suppose that a household buys a $40,000 car from 
Volvo, the Swedish carmaker. This transaction increases consumption by $40,000 
because car purchases are part of consumer spending. It also reduces net exports 
by $40,000 because the car is an import. In other words, net exports include goods 
and services produced abroad (with a minus sign) because these goods and ser-
vices are included in consumption, investment, and government purchases (with 
a plus sign). Thus, when a domestic household, firm, or government buys a good 
or service from abroad, the purchase reduces net exports, but because it also raises 
consumption, investment, or government purchases, it does not affect GDP.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
23-4 Real versus Nominal GDP
As we have seen, GDP measures the total spending on goods and services in all 
markets in the economy. If total spending rises from one year to the next, at least 
one of two things must be true: (1) the economy is producing a larger output of 
goods and services, or (2) goods and services are being sold at higher prices. When 
studying changes in the economy over time, economists want to separate these 
two effects. In particular, they want a measure of the total quantity of goods and 
services the economy is producing that is not affected by changes in the prices of 
those goods and services. 
To do this, economists use a measure called real GDP. Real GDP answers a 
hypothetical question: What would be the value of the goods and services pro-
duced this year if we valued these goods and services at the prices that prevailed 
in some specific year in the past? By evaluating current production using prices 
that are fixed at past levels, real GDP shows how the economy’s overall produc-
tion of goods and services changes over time.
To see more precisely how real GDP is constructed, let’s consider an example.
23-4a A Numerical Example
Table 2 shows some data for an economy that produces only two goods: hot dogs 
and hamburgers. The table shows the prices and quantities produced of the two 
goods in the years 2016, 2017, and 2018.
To compute total spending in this economy, we would multiply the quantities 
of hot dogs and hamburgers by their prices. In the year 2016, 100 hot dogs are sold 
at a price of $1 per hot dog, so expenditure on hot dogs equals $100. In the same 
year, 50 hamburgers are sold for $2 per hamburger, so expenditure on hamburg-
ers also equals $100. Total expenditure in the economy—the sum of expenditure 
on hot dogs and expenditure on hamburgers—is $200. This amount, the produc-
tion of goods and services valued at current prices, is called OPNJOBM(%1.

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
The table shows the calculation of nominal GDP for these 3 years. Total spend-
ing rises from $200 in 2016 to $600 in 2017 and then to $1,200 in 2018. Part of this 
rise is attributable to the increase in the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers, 
and part is attributable to the increase in the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers.
To obtain a measure of the amount produced that is not affected by changes in 
prices, we use SFBM(%1, which is the production of goods and services valued at 
constant prices. We calculate real GDP by first designating 1 year as a base year. We 
then use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in the base year to compute the 
value of goods and services in all the years. In other words, the prices in the base 
year provide the basis for comparing quantities in different years.
Suppose that we choose 2016 to be the base year in our example. We can then 
use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 2016 to compute the value of goods 
and services produced in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Table 2 shows these calculations. 
To compute real GDP for 2016, we use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 
2016 (the base year) and the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers produced in 
2016. (Thus, for the base year, real GDP always equals nominal GDP.) To com-
pute real GDP for 2017, we use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 2016 
(the base year) and the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers produced in 2017. 
Similarly, to compute real GDP for 2018, we use the prices in 2016 and the quan-
tities in 2018. When we find that real GDP has risen from $200 in 2016 to $350 
in 2017 and then to $500 in 2018, we know that the increase is attributable to an 
increase in the quantities produced because the prices are being held fixed at 
base-year levels.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
To sum up: Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy’s produc-
tion of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value on the 
economy’s production of goods and services. Because real GDP is not affected by changes 
in prices, changes in real GDP reflect only changes in the amounts being produced. 
Thus, real GDP is a measure of the economy’s production of goods and services. 
Our goal in computing GDP is to gauge how well the overall economy is per-
forming. Because real GDP measures the economy’s production of goods and ser-
vices, it reflects the economy’s ability to satisfy people’s needs and desires. Thus, 
real GDP is a better gauge of economic well-being than is nominal GDP. When 
economists talk about the economy’s GDP, they usually mean real GDP rather 
than nominal GDP. And when they talk about growth in the economy, they mea-
sure that growth as the percentage change in real GDP from one period to another.
23-4b The GDP Deflator
As we have just seen, nominal GDP reflects both the quantities of goods and ser-
vices the economy is producing and the prices of those goods and services. By 
contrast, by holding prices constant at base-year levels, real GDP reflects only the 
quantities produced. From these two statistics, we can compute a third, called the 
GDP deflator, which reflects only the prices of goods and services.
The (%1EFGMBUPS is calculated as follows:
GDP deflator 5 Nominal GDP
Real GDP
3 100.
Because nominal GDP and real GDP must be the same in the base year, the GDP 
deflator for the base year always equals 100. The GDP deflator for subsequent 
years measures the change in nominal GDP from the base year that cannot be 
attributable to a change in real GDP.
The GDP deflator measures the current level of prices relative to the level of 
prices in the base year. To see why this is true, consider a couple of simple exam-
ples. First, imagine that the quantities produced in the economy rise over time but 
prices remain the same. In this case, both nominal and real GDP rise at the same 
rate, so the GDP deflator is constant. Now suppose, instead, that prices rise over 
time but the quantities produced stay the same. In this second case, nominal GDP 
rises but real GDP remains the same, so the GDP deflator rises. Notice that, in 
both cases, the GDP deflator reflects what’s happening to prices, not quantities. 
Let’s now return to our numerical example in Table 2. The GDP deflator is com-
puted at the bottom of the table. For the year 2016, nominal GDP is $200 and real 
GDP is $200, so the GDP deflator is 100. (The deflator is always 100 in the base 
year.) For the year 2017, nominal GDP is $600 and real GDP is $350, so the GDP 
deflator is 171. 
Economists use the term inflation to describe a situation in which the economy’s 
overall price level is rising. The inflation rate is the percentage change in some 
measure of the price level from one period to the next. Using the GDP deflator, the 
inflation rate between two consecutive years is computed as follows:
Inflation rate in year 2 5
GDP deflator in year 2 2 GDP deflator in year 1
GDP deflator in year 1
3 100.
Because the GDP deflator rose in year 2017 from 100 to 171, the inflation rate is 
100 3 (171 2 100)/100, or 71 percent. In 2018, the GDP deflator rose to 240 from 
171 the previous year, so the inflation rate is 100 3 (240 2 171)/171, or 40 percent. 
The GDP deflator is one measure that economists use to monitor the average level 
of prices in the economy and thus the rate of inflation. The GDP deflator gets its name

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
CASE 
STUDY
A HALF CENTURY OF REAL GDP
Now that we know how real GDP is defined and measured, let’s look 
at what this macroeconomic variable tells us about the recent history 
of the United States. Figure 2 shows quarterly data on real GDP for 
the U.S. economy since 1965. 
The most obvious feature of these data is that real GDP grows over time. The real 
GDP of the U.S. economy in 2015 was more than four times its 1965 level. Put differently, 
the output of goods and services produced in the United States has grown on average 
about 3 percent per year. This continued growth in real GDP enables most Americans to 
enjoy greater economic prosperity than their parents and grandparents did.
A second feature of the GDP data is that growth is not steady. The upward climb 
of real GDP is occasionally interrupted by periods during which GDP declines, 
called recessions. Figure 2 marks recessions with shaded vertical bars. (There is no 
ironclad rule for when the official business cycle dating committee will declare 
that a recession has occurred, but an old rule of thumb is two consecutive quar-
ters of falling real GDP.) Recessions are associated not only with lower incomes but 
also with other forms of economic distress: rising unemployment, falling profits, 
increased bankruptcies, and so on.
Much of macroeconomics is aimed at explaining the long-run growth and short-
run fluctuations in real GDP. As we will see in the coming chapters, we need dif-
ferent models for these two purposes. Because the short-run fluctuations represent 
deviations from the long-run trend, we first examine the behavior of key macro-
economic variables, including real GDP, in the long run. Then in later chapters, we 
build on this analysis to explain short-run fluctuations. ●
because it can be used to take inflation out of nominal GDP—that is, to “deflate” nom-
inal GDP for the rise that is due to increases in prices. We examine another measure of 
the economy’s price level, called the consumer price index, in the next chapter, where 
we also describe the differences between the two measures.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
GDP measures the economy’s total 
output. Labor productivity measures 
output per unit of labor input. If 
GDP is incorrectly measured, so is 
productivity.
Silicon Valley Doesn’t Believe 
U.S. Productivity Is Down
By Timothy Aeppel 
M
OUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—Google Inc. chief 
economist Hal Varian is an evangelist for 
Silicon Valley’s contrarian take on America’s 
productivity slump.
Swiveling to a large screen on the desk 
behind him, Mr. Varian types in a search 
for the most commonly asked question 
on the subject economists elsewhere are 
wringing their hands over. Up pops, “What is 
productivity?” 
See, he says, vindicated: “Most people 
don’t know what it even means.”
To Mr. Varian and other wealthy brains 
in the world’s most innovative neighborhood, 
productivity means giving people and com-
panies tools to do things better and faster. 
By that measure, there is an explosion under 
way, thanks to the shiny gadgets, apps and 
digital geegaws spewing out of Silicon Valley.
Official U.S. figures tell a different story. 
For a decade, economic output per hour 
worked—the federal government’s formula 
for productivity—has barely budged…. Pro-
ductivity matters, economists point out, be-
cause at a 2% annual growth rate, it takes 35 
years to double the standard of living; at 1%, 
it takes 70. Low productivity growth slows the 
economy and holds down wages.
The 68-year-old Mr. Varian, dressed in a 
purple hoodie and khaki pants, says the U.S. 
doesn’t have a productivity problem, it has a 
measurement problem, a sound bite shaping 
up as the gospel according to Silicon Valley.
“There is a lack of appreciation for what’s 
happening in Silicon Valley,” he says, “because 
we don’t have a good way to measure it.”
One measurement problem is that a lot 
of what originates here is free or nearly free.

Define real GDP and nominal GDP. Which is a better measure of eco-
nomic well-being? Why?
23-5  Is GDP a Good Measure of Economic 
Well-Being?
Earlier in this chapter, GDP was called the single best measure of the economic 
well-being of a society. Now that we know what GDP is, we can evaluate this 
claim.
As we have seen, GDP measures both the economy’s total income and the 
economy’s total expenditure on goods and services. Thus, GDP per person tells us 
the  income and expenditure of the average person in the economy. Because most 
people would prefer to receive higher income and enjoy higher expenditure, GDP 
per person seems a natural measure of the economic well-being of the average 
individual. 
Yet some people dispute the validity of GDP as a measure of well-being. When 
Senator Robert Kennedy was running for president in 1968, he gave a moving 
critique of such economic measures:
[Gross domestic product] does not allow for the health of our children, the 
quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty 
of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public 
debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our courage,

arranged with friends. To find each other in 
the sprawling park nearby, he and his pals 
used an app that tracked their location, 
allowing them to meet up quickly. The same 
tool can track the movement of workers in a 
warehouse, office or shopping mall.
“Obviously that’s a productivity enhance-
ment,” Mr. Varian says. “But I doubt that gets 
measured anywhere.”
Consider the efficiency of hailing a taxi 
with an app on your mobile phone, or finding 
someone who will meet you at the airport and 
rent your car while you’re away, a new service 
in San Francisco. Add in online tools that 
instantly translate conversations or help 
locate organ donors—the list goes on and on. 
Surely, Mr. Varian says, they also make the 
U.S. more productive….
One problem with the government’s pro-
ductivity measure, Mr. Varian says, is that it 
is based on gross domestic product, the tally 
of goods and services produced by the U.S. 
economy. GDP was conceived in the 1930s, 
when economists worried mostly about how 
much, for example, steel and grain were pro-
duced—output easy to measure compared 
with digital goods and services.
Technological improvements and time-
saving apps are trickier. For one thing, it is 
tough to capture the full impact of quality 
improvements. For example, if a newer model 
car breaks down less often than older models 
but costs the same, the consumers’ gain can 
get lost in the ether….
The U.S. Labor Department has sought 
to update its GDP measure over the years to  
include more intangibles, such as adjusting 
for higher quality. Productivity measures of 
computer chips, for example, are periodically 
updated to account for faster speeds. But 
critics say the process lags behind badly….
Silicon Valley’s complaints echo earlier 
eras. The introduction in the last century of 
indoor plumbing and household appliances 
drastically increased the efficiency of per-
forming domestic chores. But since domestic 
labor isn’t counted in GDP either, the time 
saved hauling water or washing clothes by 
hand didn’t show up in productivity numbers.
However, these timesaving technolo-
gies—among other factors—eventually led 
to the flood of women into the workforce start-
ing in the 1960s, which, in turn, sent U.S. 
output soaring. 
Mr. Varian is convinced something similar 
will happen again. At the heart of his argument 
is the Internet search, cutting short the time to, 
say, learn how to grow geraniums or find the 
best Mexican restaurant—a free tool that pro-
vides uncounted value at home and at work…. 
“To be fair,” he says, “as we adopt technologies 
that save time in these nonmarket activities, 
that frees up time for market-based activities 
which will show up in GDP.” ■

nor our wisdom, nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in 
short, except that which makes life worthwhile, and it can tell us everything 
about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.
Much of what Robert Kennedy said is correct. Why, then, do we care about GDP?
The answer is that a large GDP does in fact help us to lead good lives. GDP 
does not measure the health of our children, but nations with larger GDP can 
afford better healthcare for their children. GDP does not measure the quality of 
their education, but nations with larger GDP can afford better educational sys-
tems. GDP does not measure the beauty of our poetry, but nations with larger 
GDP can afford to teach more of their citizens to read and enjoy poetry. GDP does 
not take account of our intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, or devotion to 
country, but all of these laudable attributes are easier to foster when people are 
less concerned about being able to afford the material necessities of life. In short, 
GDP does not directly measure those things that make life worthwhile, but it does 
measure our ability to obtain many of the inputs for a worthwhile life. 
GDP is not, however, a perfect measure of well-being. Some things that con-
tribute to a good life are left out of GDP. One is leisure. Suppose, for instance, that 
everyone in the economy suddenly started working every day of the week, rather 
than enjoying leisure on weekends. More goods and services would be produced, 
and GDP would rise. But despite the increase in GDP, we should not conclude 
that everyone would be better off. The loss from reduced leisure would offset the 
gain from producing and consuming a greater quantity of goods and services.
Because GDP uses market prices to value goods and services, it excludes the 
value of almost all activity that takes place outside markets. In particular, GDP

omits the value of goods and services produced at home. When a chef prepares a 
delicious meal and sells it at her restaurant, the value of that meal is part of GDP. 
But if the chef prepares the same meal for her family, the value she has added to 
the raw ingredients is left out of GDP. Similarly, child care provided in day-care 
centers is part of GDP, whereas child care by parents at home is not. Volunteer 
work also contributes to the well-being of those in society, but GDP does not re-
flect these contributions. 
Another thing that GDP excludes is the quality of the environment. Imag-
ine that the government eliminated all environmental regulations. Firms could 
then produce goods and services without considering the pollution they create,

Nations Seek Success Beyond 
GDP 
By Mark Whitehouse 
M
oney isn’t everything. But in measuring 
the success of nations, it isn’t easy to 
find a substitute.
Political leaders are increasingly  expressing 
dissatisfaction with gross domestic  product—a 
monetary measure of all the goods and services 
a country produces—as a gauge of a nation’s 
success in raising living standards. 
In November, British Prime Minister David 
Cameron announced plans to build measures 
of national well-being that would take into 
account factors such as peoples’ life satis-
faction, following a similar effort by French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Their efforts cut to the core of what eco-
nomics is supposed to be about: What makes 
us better off? How can we all have more of it? 
Anyone hoping for a clear-cut answer, though, 
is likely to be disappointed.
“There is more to life than GDP, but it will 
be hard to come up with a single measure 
to replace it and we are not sure that a sin-
gle measure is the answer,” said Paul Allin,  
director of the Measuring National Well-Being 
Project at the U.K.’s Office of National Statis-
tics. “Maybe we live in a multidimensional 
world and we have to get used to handling a 
reasonable number of bits of information.” 
After a session on creating a national suc-
cess indicator at the annual meeting of the 
American Economic Association on Friday, Carol 
Graham, fellow at the Brookings Institution, 
summed up the situation thus: “It’s like a new 
science. There’s still a lot of work to be done.”
For much of the past four decades, econ-
omists have puzzled over a paradox that cast 
doubt on GDP as the world’s main indicator 
of success. 
People in richer countries didn’t appear to 
be any happier than people in poor countries. 
In research beginning in the 1970s, University 
of Pennsylvania economist Richard Easterlin 
found no evidence of a link between countries’ 
income—as measured by GDP per person—
and peoples’ reported levels of happiness. 
More recent research suggests GDP isn’t 
quite so bad. Using more data and different 
statistical techniques, three economists at 
the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton 
School—Daniel Sacks, Betsey Stevenson 
and Justin Wolfers—found that a given per-
centage increase in GDP per person tends to 
coincide with a similar increase in reported 
well-being. The correlation held across differ-
ent countries and over time. 
Still, for measuring the success of pol-
icy, GDP is far from ideal. Making everybody 
work 120 hours a week could radically boost 
a country’s GDP per capita, but it wouldn’t 
make people happier. Removing pollution 
limits could boost GDP per hour worked, but 
wouldn’t necessarily lead to a world we’d 
want to live in. 
One approach is to enhance GDP with 
other objective factors such as inequality, lei-
sure and life expectancy. In a paper presented 
Saturday at the American Economic Associa-
tion meeting, Stanford economists Peter Kle-
now and Charles Jones found that doing so 
can make a big difference. 
By their calculation, accounting for longer 
life expectancy, additional leisure time and 
lower levels of inequality makes living stan-
dards in France and Germany look almost the 
same as those in the U.S., which otherwise 
leads the pack by a large margin. 
Mr. Klenow points out that the calculation 
is fraught with difficulties. For one, many 
countries have poor data on crucial factors 
such as life expectancy.

and GDP might rise. Yet well-being would most likely fall. The deterioration 
in the quality of air and water would more than offset the gains from greater 
production.
GDP also says nothing about the distribution of income. A society in which 
100 people have annual incomes of $50,000 has GDP of $5 million and, not sur-
prisingly, GDP per person of $50,000. So does a society in which 10 people earn 
$500,000 and 90 suffer with nothing at all. Few people would look at those two 
situations and call them equivalent. GDP per person tells us what happens 
to the average person, but behind the average lies a large variety of personal 
experiences.
Source: Peter Klenow and Charles Jones, Stanford University. Data are for 2000.
For the purpose of comparing well-being 
across countries, asking people how they feel 
might be better than monetary measures. 
Angus Deaton, an economist at Princeton 
University, notes that placing values on the 
extremely different goods and services con-
sumed in the U.S. and, say, Tajikistan, can 
be impossible to do in a comparable way. Just 
asking people about their situation could be 
much easier and no less accurate.
Surveys already play a meaningful role in 
the way many countries assess their perfor-
mance, from consumer confidence in the U.S. 
to the Netherlands’s Life Situation Index, which 
accounts for factors such as relationships 
and community involvement. 
As part of its effort to gauge well-being, 
the U.K. plans to add more subjective ques-
tions to its household surveys.
But surveys can also send misleading policy 
signals. Mr. Wolfers, for example, has found that 
surveys of women’s subjective well-being in the 
U.S. suggest that they are less happy than they 
were four decades ago, despite improvements in 
wages, education and other objective measures. 
That, he says, doesn’t mean the feminist move-
ment should be reversed. Rather, it could be re-
lated to rising expectations or greater frankness 
among the women interviewed.
Peoples’ true preferences are often re-
vealed more by what they do than by what 
they say. Surveys suggest people with chil-
dren tend to be less happy than those with-
out, yet people keep having children—and 
nobody would advocate mass sterilization to 
improve overall well-being.
“What we care about in the world is not just 
happiness,” says Mr. Wolfers. “If you measure 
just one part of what makes for a full life you’re 
going to end up harming the other parts.”
For the time being, that leaves policy 
makers to choose the measures of success 
that seem most appropriate for the task at 
hand. That’s not ideal, but it’s the best eco-
nomics has to offer. ■

GDP and the Quality of

The table shows GDP per

measures of the quality 
of life for twelve major 
countries.
Source: Human Development Report 2015, 
United Nations. Real GDP is for 2014, 
expressed in 2011 dollars. Average years 
of schooling is among adults 25 years 
and older.
In the end, we can conclude that GDP is a good measure of economic well-
being for most—but not all—purposes. It is important to keep in mind what GDP 
includes and what it leaves out.
CASE 
STUDY
INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN GDP AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE
One way to gauge the usefulness of GDP as a measure of economic 
well-being is to examine international data. Rich and poor countries 
have vastly different levels of GDP per person. If a large GDP leads 
to a higher standard of living, then we should observe GDP to be strongly cor-
related with various measures of the quality of life. And, in fact, we do. 
Table 3 shows twelve large nations ranked in order of GDP per person. The table 
also shows life expectancy at birth, the average years of schooling among adults, 
and an index of life satisfaction based on asking people to gauge how they feel 
about their lives on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 being the best). These data show 
a clear pattern. In rich countries, such as the United States and Germany, people 
can expect to live to about 80, have about 13 years of schooling, and rate their life 
satisfaction at about 7. In poor countries, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, people 
typically die about 10 years earlier, have less than half as much schooling, and rate 
their life satisfaction about 2 points lower on the 10-point scale. 
Data on other aspects of the quality of life tell a similar story. Countries with low 
GDP per person tend to have more infants with low birth weight, higher rates of 
infant mortality, higher rates of maternal mortality, and higher rates of child mal-
nutrition. They also have lower rates of access to electricity, paved roads, and clean 
drinking water. In these countries, fewer school-age children are actually in school, 
those who are in school must learn with fewer teachers per student, and illiteracy 
among adults is more common. The citizens of these nations tend to have fewer 
televisions, fewer telephones, and fewer opportunities to access the Internet. Inter-
national data leave no doubt that a nation’s GDP per person is closely associated 
with its citizens’ standard of living. ●

CHAPTER 23   MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 
23-6 Conclusion
In this chapter we learned how economists measure the total income of a nation. 
Measurement is, of course, only a starting point. Much of macroeconomics is 
aimed at revealing the long-run and short-run determinants of a nation’s gross 
domestic product. Why, for example, is GDP higher in the United States and 
 Japan than in India and Nigeria? What can the governments of the poorest coun-
tries do to promote more rapid GDP growth? Why does GDP in the United States 
rise rapidly in some years and fall in others? What can U.S. policymakers do to 
reduce the severity of these fluctuations in GDP? These are the questions we will 
take up shortly. 
At this point, it is important to acknowledge the significance of just measur-
ing GDP. We all get some sense of how the economy is doing as we go about our 
lives. But the economists who study changes in the economy and the policymak-
ers who formulate economic policies need more than this vague sense—they need 
concrete data on which to base their judgments. Quantifying the behavior of the 
economy with statistics such as GDP is, therefore, the first step to developing a 
science of macroeconomics.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
1. Explain why an economy’s income must equal its 
expenditure.
2. Which contributes more to GDP—the production of 
an economy car or the production of a luxury car? 
Why?
3. A farmer sells wheat to a baker for $2. The baker uses 
the wheat to make bread, which is sold for $3. What is 
the total contribution of these transactions to GDP?
4. Many years ago, Peggy paid $500 to put together a re-
cord collection. Today, she sold her albums at a garage 
sale for $100. How does this sale affect current GDP?
5. List the four components of GDP. Give an example of 
each.
6. Why do economists use real GDP rather than nominal 
GDP to gauge economic well-being?
7. In the year 2017, the economy produces 100 loaves of 
bread that sell for $2 each. In the year 2018, the econ-
omy produces 200 loaves of bread that sell for $3 each. 
Calculate nominal GDP, real GDP, and the GDP defla-
tor for each year. (Use 2017 as the base year.) By what 
percentage does each of these three statistics rise from 
one year to the next?
8. Why is it desirable for a country to have a large GDP? 
Give an example of something that would raise GDP 
and yet be undesirable.
r Because every transaction has a buyer and a seller, the 
total expenditure in the economy must equal the total 
income in the economy. 
r Gross domestic product (GDP) measures an econo-
my’s total expenditure on newly produced goods and 
services and the total income earned from the produc-
tion of these goods and services. More precisely, GDP 
is the market value of all final goods and services pro-
duced within a country in a given period of time.
r GDP is divided among four components of expendi-
ture: consumption, investment, government purchases, 
and net exports. Consumption includes spending on 
goods and services by households, with the exception 
of purchases of new housing. Investment includes 
spending on business capital, residential capital, and 
inventories. Government purchases include spending 
on goods and services by local, state, and federal gov-
ernments. Net exports equal the value of goods and 
services produced domestically and sold abroad (ex-
ports) minus the value of goods and services produced 
abroad and sold domestically (imports).
r Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the econ-
omy’s production of goods and services. Real GDP 
uses constant base-year prices to value the economy’s 
production of goods and services. The GDP deflator—
calculated from the ratio of nominal to real GDP—
measures the level of prices in the economy.
r GDP is a good measure of economic well-being be-
cause people prefer higher to lower incomes. But it is 
not a perfect measure of well-being. For example, GDP 
excludes the value of leisure and the value of a clean 
environment.

not include spending on transfer payments such as 
Social Security. Thinking about the definition of GDP, 
explain why transfer payments are excluded. 
4. As the chapter states, GDP does not include the value 
of used goods that are resold. Why would including 
such transactions make GDP a less informative mea-
sure of economic well-being?

deflator for each year, using 2016 as the base year.
b. Compute the percentage change in nominal GDP, 
real GDP, and the GDP deflator in 2017 and 2018 
from the preceding year. For each year, identify 
the variable that does not change. Explain why 
your answer makes sense.

f. Was the growth rate of nominal GDP higher or 
lower than the growth rate of real GDP? Explain.
8. Revised estimates of U.S. GDP are usually released 
by the government near the end of each month. Find 
a newspaper article that reports on the most recent 
release, or read the news release yourself at http://
www.bea.gov, the website of the U.S. Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis. Discuss the recent changes in real and 
nominal GDP and in the components of GDP.

into bread, which she sells to consumers for $180. Con-
sumers eat the bread.
a. What is GDP in this economy? Explain.
b. Value added is defined as the value of a producer’s 
output minus the value of the intermediate goods 
that the producer buys to make the output. Assum-
ing there are no intermediate goods beyond those 
described above, calculate the value added of each of 
the three producers.
c. What is total value added of the three producers in 
this economy? How does it compare to the econo-
my’s GDP? Does this example suggest another way 
of calculating GDP?
10. Goods and services that are not sold in markets, such 
as food produced and consumed at home, are generally 
not included in GDP. Can you think of how this might 
cause the numbers in the second column of Table 3 to be 
misleading in a comparison of the economic well-being of 
the United States and India? Explain.
11. The participation of women in the U.S. labor force has 
risen dramatically since 1970.
a. How do you think this rise affected GDP?
b. Now imagine a measure of well-being that includes 
time spent working in the home and taking leisure. 
How would the change in this measure of well-being 
compare to the change in GDP?
c. Can you think of other aspects of well-being  
that are associated with the rise in women’s  
labor-force participation? Would it be practical to 
construct a measure of well-being that includes 
these aspects?
12. One day, Barry the Barber, Inc., collects $400 for hair-
cuts. Over this day, his equipment depreciates in value 
by $50. Of the remaining $350, Barry sends $30 to the 
government in sales taxes, takes home $220 in wages, 
and retains $100 in his business to add new equipment 
in the future. From the $220 that Barry takes home, he 
pays $70 in income taxes. Based on this information, 
compute  Barry’s contribution to the following measures 
of income.
a. gross domestic product
b. net national product
c. national income
d. personal income
e. disposable personal income

I
n 1931, as the U.S. economy was suffering through the Great Depression, the 
New York Yankees paid famed baseball player Babe Ruth a salary of $80,000. 
At the time, this pay was extraordinary, even among the stars of baseball. 
According to one story, a reporter asked Ruth whether he thought it was right 
that he made more than President Herbert Hoover, who had a salary of $75,000. 
Ruth replied, “I had a better year.”
In 2015, the average salary earned by major league baseball players was about 
$4 million, and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was paid $31 
million. At first, this fact might lead you to think that baseball has become 
vastly more lucrative over the past eight decades. But as everyone 
knows, the prices of goods and services have also risen.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
In 1931, a nickel would buy an ice-cream cone and a quarter would buy a ticket 
at the local movie theater. Because prices were so much lower in Babe Ruth’s day 
than they are today, it is not clear whether Ruth enjoyed a higher or lower stan-
dard of living than today’s players. 
In the preceding chapter, we looked at how economists use gross domestic 
product (GDP) to measure the quantity of goods and services that the economy is 
producing. This chapter examines how economists measure the overall cost of liv-
ing. To compare Babe Ruth’s salary of $80,000 to salaries from today, we need to 
find some way of turning dollar figures into meaningful measures of purchasing 
power. That is exactly the job of a statistic called the consumer price index, or sim-
ply the CPI. After seeing how the CPI is constructed, we discuss how we can use 
such a price index to compare dollar figures from different points in time.
The CPI is used to monitor changes in the cost of living over time. When the 
CPI rises, the typical family has to spend more money to maintain the same stan-
dard of living. Economists use the term inflation to describe a situation in which 
the economy’s overall price level is rising. The inflation rate is the percentage 
change in the price level from the previous period. The preceding chapter showed 
how economists can measure inflation using the GDP deflator. The inflation rate 
you are likely to hear on the nightly news, however, is calculated from the CPI, 
which better reflects the goods and services bought by consumers.
As we will see in the coming chapters, inflation is a closely watched aspect of 
macroeconomic performance and is a key variable guiding macroeconomic pol-
icy. This chapter provides the background for that analysis by showing how econ-
omists measure the inflation rate using the CPI and how this statistic can be used 
to compare dollar figures from different times. 
24-1 The Consumer Price Index
The consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and 
services bought by a typical consumer. Every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), which is part of the Department of Labor, computes and reports the CPI. In 
this section, we discuss how the CPI is calculated and what problems arise in its 
measurement. We also consider how this index compares to the GDP deflator, another 
measure of the overall level of prices, which we examined in the preceding chapter.
24-1a How the CPI Is Calculated
When the BLS calculates the CPI and the inflation rate, it uses data on the prices of 
thousands of goods and services. To see exactly how these statistics are constructed, 
let’s consider a simple economy in which consumers buy only two goods: hot dogs 
and hamburgers. Table 1 shows the five steps that the BLS follows.
 1. Fix the basket. Determine which prices are most important to the typical 
consumer. If the typical consumer buys more hot dogs than hamburgers, 
then the price of hot dogs is more important than the price of hamburgers 
and, therefore, should be given greater weight in measuring the cost of 
living. The BLS sets these weights by surveying consumers to find the basket 
of goods and services bought by the typical consumer. In the example in the 
table, the typical consumer buys a basket of 4 hot dogs and 2 hamburgers.
2. Find the prices. Find the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket at 
each point in time. The table shows the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers for 
three different years.

CHAPTER 24   MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING
3. Compute the basket’s cost. Use the data on prices to calculate the cost of 
the basket of goods and services at different times. The table shows this 
calculation for each of the three years. Notice that only the prices in this 
calculation change. By keeping the basket of goods the same (4 hot dogs and 
2 hamburgers), we are isolating the effects of price changes from the effects of 
any quantity changes that might be occurring at the same time.
4. Choose a base year and compute the index. Designate one year as the base year, the 
benchmark against which other years are to be compared. (The choice of base 
year is arbitrary. The index is used to measure percentage changes in the cost 
of living, and these changes are the same regardless of the choice of base year.) 
Once the base year is chosen, the index is calculated as follows:
Consumer price index 5
Price of basket of goods and services in current year
Price of basket in base year
3 100.
That is, the price of the basket of goods and services in each year is divided by 
the price of the basket in the base year, and this ratio is then multiplied by 100. 
The resulting number is the CPI.
In the example in Table 1, 2016 is the base year. In this year, the basket of 
hot dogs and hamburgers costs $8. Therefore, to calculate the CPI, the price of 
the basket in each year is divided by $8 and multiplied by 100. The CPI is 100 
in 2016. (The index is always 100 in the base year.) The CPI is 175 in 2017. This 
means that the price of the basket in 2017 is 175 percent of its price in the base 
year. Put differently, a basket of goods that costs $100 in the base year costs

$175 in 2017. Similarly, the CPI is 250 in 2018, indicating that the price level in 
2018 is 250 percent of the price level in the base year.
5. Compute the inflation rate. Use the CPI to calculate the inflation rate, which is 
the percentage change in the price index from the preceding period. That is, 
the inflation rate between two consecutive years is computed as follows:
Inflation rate in year 2 5
CPI in year 2 2 CPI in year 1
CPI in year 1
3 100.
As shown at the bottom of Table 1, the inflation rate in our example is 75 per-
cent in 2017 and 43 percent in 2018.
Although this example simplifies the real world by including only two goods, it 
shows how the BLS computes the CPI and the inflation rate. The BLS collects and 
processes data on the prices of thousands of goods and services every month and, 
by following the five foregoing steps, determines how quickly the cost of living for 
the typical consumer is rising. When the BLS makes its monthly announcement of 
the CPI, you can usually hear the number on the evening television news or see it 
in the next day’s newspaper.
In addition to the CPI for the overall economy, the BLS calculates several 
other price indexes. It reports the index for some narrow categories of goods and 
services, such as food, clothing, and energy. It also calculates the CPI for all goods

the price index from the

What’s in the CPI’s Basket?
W
hen constructing the consumer price index, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics tries to include all the goods and services that the typi-
cal consumer buys. Moreover, it tries to weight these goods and services  
according to how much consumers buy of each item. 
Figure 1 shows the breakdown of consumer spending into the major 
categories of goods and services. By far the largest category is housing, 
which makes up 42 percent of the typical consumer’s budget. This category 
includes the cost of shelter (33 percent), fuel and utilities (5 percent), and 
household furnishings and operation (4 percent). The next largest category, 
at 16 percent, is transportation, which includes spending on cars, gaso-
line, buses, subways, and so on. The next category, at 15 percent, is food 
and beverages; this includes food at home (8 percent), food away from 
home (6 percent), and alcoholic beverages (1 percent). Next are medical 
care at 8 percent, education and communication at 7 percent, and recre-
ation at 6 percent. Apparel, which includes clothing, footwear, and jewelry, 
makes up 3 percent of the typical consumer’s budget.
Also included in the figure, at 3 percent of spending, is a category 
for other goods and services. This is a catchall for consumer purchases 
(such as cigarettes, haircuts, and funeral expenses) that do not naturally 
fit into the other categories. ■

CHAPTER 24   MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING
and services excluding food and energy, a statistic called the core CPI. Because 
food and energy prices show substantial short-run volatility, the core CPI better 
reflects ongoing inflation trends. Finally, the BLS also calculates the producer 
price index (PPI), which measures the cost of a basket of goods and services 
bought by firms rather than consumers. Because firms eventually pass on their 
costs to consumers in the form of higher consumer prices, changes in the PPI are 
often thought to be useful in predicting changes in the CPI. 
24-1b Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living
The goal of the consumer price index is to measure changes in the cost of living. 
In other words, the CPI tries to gauge how much incomes must rise to maintain a 
constant standard of living. The CPI, however, is not a perfect measure of the cost of 
living. Three problems with the index are widely acknowledged but difficult to solve.
The first problem is called substitution bias. When prices change from one year 
to the next, they do not all change proportionately: Some prices rise more than 
others. Consumers respond to these differing price changes by buying less of the 
goods whose prices have risen by relatively large amounts and by buying more 
of the goods whose prices have risen less or perhaps even have fallen. That is, 
consumers substitute toward goods that have become relatively less expensive. 
If a price index is computed assuming a fixed basket of goods, it ignores the 
possibility of consumer substitution and, therefore, overstates the increase in the 
cost of living from one year to the next.
Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine that in the base year, apples are 
cheaper than pears, so consumers buy more apples than pears. When the BLS 
constructs the basket of goods, it will include more apples than pears. Suppose 
that next year pears are cheaper than apples. Consumers will naturally respond to 
the price changes by buying more pears and fewer apples. Yet when computing 
the CPI, the BLS uses a fixed basket, which in essence assumes that consumers 
continue buying the now expensive apples in the same quantities as before. For 
this reason, the index will measure a much larger increase in the cost of living 
than consumers actually experience.
The second problem with the CPI is the introduction of new goods. When a new 
good is introduced, consumers have more variety from which to choose, and this 
in turn reduces the cost of maintaining the same level of economic well-being. To 
see why, consider a hypothetical situation: Suppose you could choose between a 
$100 gift certificate at a large store that offered a wide array of goods and a $100 
gift certificate at a small store with the same prices but a more limited selection. 
Which would you prefer? Most people would pick the store with greater variety. 
In essence, the increased set of possible choices makes each dollar more valuable. 
The same is true with the evolution of the economy over time: As new goods are 
introduced, consumers have more choices, and each dollar is worth more. But 
because the CPI is based on a fixed basket of goods and services, it does not reflect 
the increase in the value of the dollar that arises from the introduction of new 
goods.
Again, let’s consider an example. When the iPod was introduced in 2001, 
consumers found it more convenient to listen to their favorite music. Devices 
to play music were available previously, but they were not nearly as portable 
and versatile. The iPod was a new option that increased consumers’ set of 
opportunities. For any given number of dollars, the introduction of the iPod made 
people better off; conversely, achieving the same level of economic well-being 
required a smaller number of dollars. A perfect cost-of-living index would have 
reflected the introduction of the iPod with a decrease in the cost of living. The CPI,

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
however, did not decrease in response to the introduction of the iPod. Eventually, 
the BLS revised the basket of goods to include the iPod, and subsequently, the 
index reflected changes in iPod prices. But the reduction in the cost of living 
associated with the initial introduction of the iPod never showed up in the index. 
The third problem with the CPI is unmeasured quality change. If the quality of a 
good deteriorates from one year to the next while its price remains the same, the 
value of a dollar falls, because you are getting a lesser good for the same amount 
of money. Similarly, if the quality rises from one year to the next, the value of 
a dollar rises. The BLS does its best to account for quality change. When the 
quality of a good in the basket changes—for example, when a car model has more 
horsepower or gets better gas mileage from one year to the next—the Bureau 
adjusts the price of the good to account for the quality change. It is, in essence, 
The web is providing alternative ways 
to collect data on the overall level of 
prices.
Do We Need Google to Measure 
Inflation? 
By Annie Lowrey
A
t some 23,000 retailers and businesses 
in 90 U.S. cities, hundreds of government 
workers find and mark down prices on very pre-
cise products. And I’m not kidding when I say 
“very precise.”
Say the relevant worker is finding the 
price for a motel room. She might write a 
report like this: Occupancy—two adults; 
Type of accommodation—deluxe room; Room 
classification/location—ocean view, room 306; 
Time of stay—weekend; Length of stay—one 
night; Bathroom facilities—one full bathroom; 
Kitchen facilities—none; Television—one, 
includes free movie channel; Telephone—one 
telephone, free local calls; Air-conditioned—
yes; Meals included—breakfast; Parking—free 
self parking; Transportation—Transportation 
to airport, no charge; Recreation facilities—an 
indoor and an outdoor pool, a private beach, 
three tennis courts, and an exercise room.
This mind-numbingly tedious process 
goes on for a dizzying panoply of items: 
wine, takeaway meals, bedroom furniture, 
surgical procedures, pet dogs, college tuition, 
cigarettes, haircuts, funerals. When all of the 
prices are marked down, the workers submit 
forms that are collated, checked, and input into 
massive spreadsheets. Then the government 
boils all those numbers down to one. It weights 
certain prices, taking into account that 
consumers spend more on rent than cereal, for 
instance. It considers product improvements 
and changes in spending habits. Then it comes 
up with a master number showing how much 
a customer’s spending needed to increase 
to buy the same goods, month-on-month. 
That number is the Consumer Price Index, the 
government’s main gauge of inflation. 
Each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
goes through all that hassle because knowing 
the rate of inflation is such an important measure 
of economic health—and it’s important to 
the government’s own budget. High inflation? 
Savers panic, watching the spending power of 
their accounts erode. Deflation? Everyone saves, 
awaiting cheaper prices in a few months. And 
wildly changing inflation makes it difficult for 
businesses and consumers to make economic 
decisions. Moreover, the government needs 
to know the rate of inflation to index certain 
payments, like Social Security benefits or interest 
payments on TIPS bonds.
But just because the government expends 
so much energy determining the rate of inflation 
does not mean it is tallying it in the smartest or 
most accurate way. The reigning methodology 
is, well, clunky. It costs Washington around 
$234 million a year to get all those people to 
go and bear witness to a $1.57 price increase 
in a packet of tube socks and then to massage 
those individual data points down to one number. 
Moreover, there is a weekslong lag between 
the checkers tallying up the numbers and the 
government announcing the changes: The 
inflation measure comes out only 12 times a year, 
though prices change, sometimes dramatically, 
all the time. Plus, the methodology is archaic, 
given that we live in the Internet age. Prices 
are easily available online and a lot of shopping 
happens on the Web rather than in stores. 
But there might be a better way. In the 
last few months, economists have come up 
with new methods for calculating inflation 
at Internet speed—nimbler, cheaper, faster, 
and perhaps even more accurate than 
Washington’s. The first comes from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In

CHAPTER 24   MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING
trying to compute the price of a basket of goods of constant quality. Despite these 
efforts, changes in quality remain a problem because quality is hard to measure.
There is still much debate among economists about how severe these 
measurement problems are and what should be done about them. Several studies 
written during the 1990s concluded that the CPI overstated inflation by about 1 
percentage point per year. In response to this criticism, the BLS adopted several 
technical changes to improve the CPI, and many economists believe that the bias 
is now only about half as large as it once was. The issue is important because 
many government programs use the CPI to adjust for changes in the overall 
level of prices. Recipients of Social Security, for instance, get annual increases in 
benefits that are tied to the CPI. Some economists have suggested modifying these 
programs to correct for the measurement problems by, for instance, reducing the 
magnitude of the automatic benefit increases.
2007, economists Roberto Rigobon and 
Alberto Cavallo started tracking prices online 
and inputting them into a massive database. 
Then, last month, they unveiled the Billion 
Prices Project, an inflation measure based on 
5 million items sold by 300 online retailers in 
70 countries. (For the United States, the BPP 
collects about 500,000 prices.) 
The BPP’s inflation measure is markedly 
different from the government’s. The economists 
just average all the prices culled online, 
meaning the basket of goods is whatever you 
can buy on the Web. (Some things, like books, 
are most often bought online. Some items, like 
cats, are not.) Plus, the researchers do not 
weight certain items’ prices, even if they tend 
to make up a bigger proportion of household 
spending. 
Still, thus far, the BPP has tracked the CPI 
closely. And the online-based measure has 
additional advantages. It comes out daily, giving 
a better sense of inflation’s direction. It also lets 
researchers examine minute, day-to-day price 
changes. For instance, this month Rigobon and 
Cavallo noted that Black Friday discounts “had a 
smaller effect on average prices in 2010 than in 
2009,” contrary to reports of deeper discounting 
this year. And it has already produced some 
academic insights. For instance, Cavallo found 
that retailers change prices less often, but more, 
percentage-wise, than economists previously 
thought. 
A second inflation measure comes from 
Web behemoth Google and is a pet project of 
the company’s chief economist, Hal Varian. 
As reported by the Financial Times, earlier 
this year, Varian decided to use Google’s 
vast database of Web prices to construct the 
“Google Price Index,” a constantly updated 
measure of price changes and inflation. (The 
idea came to him when he was searching for 
a pepper grinder online.) Google has not yet 
decided whether it will publish the price index, 
and has not released its methodology. But 
Varian said that his preliminary index tracked 
CPI closely, though it did show periods of 
deflation—the worrisome incidence of prices 
actually falling—where the CPI did not. 
The new indices lead to the big question of 
whether the government needs to update its 
methods to account for changes in the economy—
taking new pricing trends into consideration, 
rejiggering its formula, updating more frequently. 
The answer might be yes. (Economists have 
reformed the CPI before.) But the CPI and its 
Stone Age method of calculation boasts one huge 
benefit: It’s a stable, tested measure, consistent 
over time, since its methodology doesn’t change 
much. Moreover, and somewhat remarkably, the 
Google and Billion Prices Project indices actually 
seem to confirm the accuracy of the old-fashioned 
CPI, tracking it closely rather than showing it to 
be off-base. 
Ultimately, there is a good argument for 
more inflation measures, not just better or 
newer ones. The government already calculates 
a number of rates of inflation to give a fuller 
picture of price changes, the value of money, and 
the economy. Most notably, the BLS publishes a 
“core inflation” number, a measure of inflation 
outside volatile food and energy prices. There are 
dozens of other measures, as well. The new Web-
based yardsticks provide even more alternatives 
and opportunities to examine the accuracy of the 
CPI—and to make new findings. That means, 
for now, those detective-like government rubes 
painstakingly checking prices on clipboards get 
to stay in work. ■

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
24-1c The GDP Deflator versus the Consumer Price Index
In the preceding chapter, we examined another measure of the overall level of 
prices in the economy—the GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal 
GDP to real GDP. Because nominal GDP is current output valued at current prices 
and real GDP is current output valued at base-year prices, the GDP deflator 
reflects the current level of prices relative to the level of prices in the base year.
Economists and policymakers monitor both the GDP deflator and the CPI to 
gauge how quickly prices are rising. Usually, these two statistics tell a similar 
story. Yet two important differences can cause them to diverge.
The first difference is that the GDP deflator reflects the prices of all goods and 
services produced domestically, whereas the CPI reflects the prices of all goods and 
services bought by consumers. For example, suppose that the price of an airplane 
produced by Boeing and sold to the Air Force rises. Even though the plane is 
part of GDP, it is not part of the basket of goods and services bought by a typical 
consumer. Thus, the price increase shows up in the GDP deflator but not in 
the CPI. 
As another example, suppose that Volvo raises the price of its cars. Because 
Volvos are made in Sweden, the car is not part of U.S. GDP. But U.S. consumers 
buy Volvos, so the car is part of the typical consumer’s basket of goods. Hence, a 
price increase in an imported consumption good, such as a Volvo, shows up in the 
CPI but not in the GDP deflator.
This first difference between the CPI and the GDP deflator is particularly 
important when the price of oil changes. The United States produces some oil, 
but much of the oil we use is imported. As a result, oil and oil products such as 
gasoline and heating oil make up a much larger share of consumer spending than 
of GDP. When the price of oil rises, the CPI rises by much more than does the GDP 
deflator.
The second and subtler difference between the GDP deflator and the CPI 
concerns how various prices are weighted to yield a single number for the overall 
level of prices. The CPI compares the price of a fixed basket of goods and services 
to the price of the basket in the base year. Only occasionally does the BLS change 
the basket of goods. By contrast, the GDP deflator compares the price of currently 
produced goods and services to the price of the same goods and services in the base 
year. Thus, the group of goods and services used to compute the GDP deflator 
changes automatically over time. This difference is not important when all prices 
are changing proportionately. But if the prices of different goods and services are 
changing by varying amounts, the way we weight the various prices matters for 
the overall inflation rate. 
Figure 2 shows the inflation rate as measured by both the GDP deflator and 
the CPI for each year since 1965. You can see that sometimes the two measures 
diverge. When they do diverge, it is possible to go behind these numbers and 
explain the divergence with the two differences we have discussed. For example, 
in 1979 and 1980, CPI inflation spiked up more than the GDP deflator largely 
because oil prices more than doubled during these two years. Yet divergence 
between these two measures is the exception rather than the rule. In the 1970s, 
both the GDP deflator and the CPI show high rates of inflation. In the late 1980s, 
1990s, and the first decade of the 2000s, both measures show low rates of inflation.

CHAPTER 24   MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING
24-2  Correcting Economic Variables for the 
Effects of Inflation
The purpose of measuring the overall level of prices in the economy is to allow 
us to compare dollar figures from different times. Now that we know how price 
indexes are calculated, let’s see how we might use such an index to compare a 
dollar figure from the past to a dollar figure in the present.
24-2a Dollar Figures from Different Times
We first return to the issue of Babe Ruth’s salary. Was his salary of $80,000 in 1931 
high or low compared to the salaries of today’s players?
To answer this question, we need to know the level of prices in 1931 and the 
level of prices today. Part of the increase in baseball salaries compensates players 
for higher prices today. To compare Ruth’s salary to those of today’s players, we 
need to inflate Ruth’s salary to turn 1931 dollars into today’s dollars.
The formula for turning dollar figures from year T into today’s dollars is the 
following:
Amount in todayrs dollars 5 Amount in year T dollars 3
Price level today
Price level in year T.
A price index such as the CPI measures the price level and thus determines the 
size of the inflation correction.
Let’s apply this formula to Ruth’s salary. Government statistics show a CPI of 
15.2 for 1931 and 237 for 2015. Thus, the overall level of prices has risen by a factor

of 15.6 (calculated from 237/15.2). We can use these numbers to measure Ruth’s 
salary in 2015 dollars, as follows:
Salary in 2015 dollars 5 Salary in 1931 dollars 3 Price level in 2015
Price level in 1931
5 $80,000 3 237
15.2
5 $1,247,368.
We find that Babe Ruth’s 1931 salary is equivalent to a salary today of over 
$1.2 million. That is a good income, but it is only a third of the average player’s 
salary today and only 4 percent of what the Dodgers pay Clayton Kershaw. 
Various forces, including overall economic growth and the increasing income 
shares earned by superstars, have substantially raised the living standards of the 
best athletes.
Let’s also examine President Hoover’s 1931 salary of $75,000. To translate 
that figure into 2015 dollars, we again multiply the ratio of the price levels in the 
two years. We find that Hoover’s salary is equivalent to $75,000 3 (237/15.2), or 
$1,169,408 in 2015 dollars. This is well above President Barack Obama’s salary of 
$400,000. It seems that President Hoover did have a pretty good year after all.
Mr. Index Goes to Hollywood
W
hat is the most popular movie of all time? The answer might 
surprise you.
Movie popularity is usually gauged by box office receipts. By 
that measure, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the number-one 
movie of all time with domestic receipts of $923 million, followed 
by Avatar ($761 million) 
a n d  Ti t a n i c  ( $ 6 5 9 
million). But this ranking 
ignores an obvious but 
important fact: Prices, 
including those of movie 
tickets, have been rising 
over time. Inflation gives an advantage to newer films.
When we correct box office receipts for the effects of inflation, the 
story is very different. The number-one movie is now Gone with the Wind 
($1,758 million), followed by the original Star Wars ($1,550 million) and 
The Sound of Music ($1,239 million). Star Wars: The Force Awakens falls 
to number 11. 
Gone with the Wind was released in 1939, before everyone had 
televisions in their homes. In the 1930s, about 90 million Americans 
went to the cinema each week, compared to about 25 million today. 
But the movies from that era don’t show up in conventional popularity 
rankings because ticket prices were only a quarter. And indeed, in the 
ranking based on nominal box office receipts, Gone with the Wind does 
not make the top 100 films. Scarlett and Rhett fare a lot better once we 
correct for the effects of inflation. ■

CASE 
STUDY
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE COST OF LIVING
When you graduate from college, you may well have several job offers 
from which to choose. Not surprisingly, some jobs pay more than 
others. If the jobs are located in different places, however, be careful 
when comparing them. The cost of living varies not only over time but 
also over geography. What seems like a larger paycheck might not turn out to be so 
once you take into account regional differences in the prices of goods and services.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis has used the data collected for the CPI to 
compare prices around the United States. The resulting statistic is called regional 
price parities. Just as the CPI measures variation in the cost of living from year to 
year, regional price parities measure variation in the cost of living from state to state.
Figure 3 shows the regional price parities for 2013. For example, living in the 
state of New York costs 115.3 percent of what it costs to live in the typical place in 
the United States (that is, New York is 15.3 percent more expensive than average).

506
PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
Living in Mississippi costs 86.8 percent of what it costs to live in the typical place 
(that is, Mississippi is 13.2 percent less expensive than average).
What accounts for these differences? It turns out that the prices of goods, such 
as food and clothing, explain only a small part of these regional differences. Most 
goods are tradable: They can be easily transported from one state to another. 
As a consequence of regional trade, large price disparities are unlikely to persist 
for long. 
Services explain a larger part of these regional differences. A haircut, for example, 
can cost more in one state than another. If barbers were willing to move to where the 
price of a haircut is high, or if customers were willing to fly across the country in search 
of cheap haircuts, then the prices of haircuts across regions might well converge. But 
because transporting haircuts is so costly, large price disparities can persist.
Housing services are particularly important for understanding regional 
differences in the cost of living. Such services represent a large share of a typical 
consumer’s budget. Moreover, once built, a house or apartment building can’t 
easily be moved, and the land on which it sits is completely immobile. As a result, 
differences in housing costs can be persistently large. For example, rents in New 
York are almost twice what they are in Mississippi.
Keep these facts in mind when it comes time to compare job offers. Look not only 
at the dollar salaries but also at the local prices of goods and services, especially 
housing. ● 
24-2b Indexation
As we have just seen, price indexes are used to correct for the effects of inflation 
when comparing dollar figures from different times. This type of correction shows 
up in many places in the economy. When some dollar amount is automatically 
corrected for changes in the price level by law or contract, the amount is said to be 
indexed for inflation.
For example, many long-term contracts between firms and unions include partial 
or complete indexation of the wage to the CPI. Such a provision, called a cost-of-
living allowance (or COLA), automatically raises the wage when the CPI rises.
Indexation is also a feature of many laws. Social Security benefits, for instance, are 
adjusted every year to compensate the elderly for increases in prices. The brackets 
of the federal income tax—the income levels at which the tax rates change—are also 
indexed for inflation. There are, however, many ways in which the tax system is not 
indexed for inflation, even when perhaps it should be. We discuss these issues more 
fully when we discuss the costs of inflation later in this book.
24-2c Real and Nominal Interest Rates
Correcting economic variables for the effects of inflation is particularly important, 
and somewhat tricky, when we look at data on interest rates. The very concept 
of an interest rate necessarily involves comparing amounts of money at different 
points in time. When you deposit your savings in a bank account, you give the 
bank some money now, and the bank returns your deposit with interest in the 
future. Similarly, when you borrow from a bank, you get some money now, but 
you will have to repay the loan with interest in the future. In both cases, to fully 
understand the deal between you and the bank, it is crucial to acknowledge that 
future dollars could have a different value than today’s dollars. That is, you have 
to correct for the effects of inflation.
Let’s consider an example. Suppose Sally Saver deposits $1,000 in a bank 
account that pays an annual interest rate of 10 percent. A year later, after Sally has

CHAPTER 24   MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING
accumulated $100 in interest, she withdraws her $1,100. Is Sally $100 richer than 
she was when she made the deposit a year earlier?
The answer depends on what we mean by “richer.” Sally does have $100 more 
than she had before. In other words, the number of dollars in her possession has 
risen by 10 percent. But Sally does not care about the amount of money itself: She 
cares about what she can buy with it. If prices have risen while her money was 
in the bank, each dollar now buys less than it did a year ago. In this case, her 
purchasing power—the amount of goods and services she can buy—has not risen 
by 10 percent. 
To keep things simple, let’s suppose that Sally is a movie fan and buys only 
DVDs. When Sally made her deposit, a DVD cost $10. Her deposit of $1,000 was 
equivalent to 100 DVDs. A year later, after getting her 10 percent interest, she has 
$1,100. How many DVDs can she buy now? It depends on what has happened to 
the price of a DVD. Here are some examples:
r Zero inflation: If the price of a DVD remains at $10, the amount she can buy 
has risen from 100 to 110 DVDs. The 10 percent increase in the number of 
dollars means a 10 percent increase in her purchasing power.
r Six percent inflation: If the price of a DVD rises from $10 to $10.60, then the 
number of DVDs she can buy has risen from 100 to approximately 104. Her 
purchasing power has increased by about 4 percent. 
r Ten percent inflation: If the price of a DVD rises from $10 to $11, she can 
still buy only 100 DVDs. Even though Sally’s dollar wealth has risen, her 
purchasing power is the same as it was a year earlier. 
r Twelve percent inflation: If the price of a DVD increases from $10 to $11.20, 
the number of DVDs she can buy has fallen from 100 to approximately 98.  
Even with her greater number of dollars, her purchasing power has 
decreased by about 2 percent.
And if Sally were living in an economy with deflation—falling prices—another 
possibility could arise:
r Two percent deflation: If the price of a DVD falls from $10 to $9.80, then the 
number of DVDs she can buy rises from 100 to approximately 112. Her pur-
chasing power increases by about 12 percent.
These examples show that the higher the rate of inflation, the smaller the increase 
in Sally’s purchasing power. If the rate of inflation exceeds the rate of interest, her 
purchasing power actually falls. And if there is deflation (that is, a negative rate of 
inflation), her purchasing power rises by more than the rate of interest.
To understand how much a person earns in a savings account, we need to 
consider both the interest rate and the change in prices. The interest rate that 
measures the change in dollar amounts is called the nominal interest rate, and 
the interest rate corrected for inflation is called the real interest rate. The nominal 
interest rate, the real interest rate, and inflation are related approximately as follows:
Real interest rate 5 Nominal interest rate 2 Inflation rate.
The real interest rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and the 
rate of inflation. The nominal interest rate tells you how fast the number of dollars 
in your bank account rises over time, while the real interest rate tells you how fast 
the purchasing power of your bank account rises over time.

INTEREST RATES IN THE U.S. ECONOMY
Figure 4 shows real and nominal interest rates in the U.S. economy 
since 1965. The nominal interest rate in this figure is the rate on three-
month Treasury bills (although data on other interest rates would be 
similar). The real interest rate is computed by subtracting the rate of 
inflation from this nominal interest rate. Here the inflation rate is measured as the 
percentage change in the CPI.
One feature of this figure is that the nominal interest rate almost always exceeds 
the real interest rate. This reflects the fact that the U.S. economy has experienced 
rising consumer prices in almost every year during this period. By contrast, if you 
look at data for the U.S. economy during the late 19th century or for the Japanese 
economy in some recent years, you will find periods of deflation. During deflation, 
the real interest rate exceeds the nominal interest rate. 
The figure also shows that because inflation is variable, real and nominal interest 
rates do not always move together. For example, in the late 1970s, nominal interest 
rates were high. But because inflation was very high, real interest rates were low. 
Indeed, during much of the 1970s, real interest rates were negative, for inflation 
eroded people’s savings more quickly than nominal interest payments increased 
them. By contrast, in the late 1990s, nominal interest rates were lower than they 
had been two decades earlier. But because inflation was much lower, real interest 
rates were higher. In the coming chapters, we will examine the economic forces that 
determine both real and nominal interest rates. ●

CHAPTER 24   MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING
overall level of prices have been the norm. Such inflation reduces the purchasing 
power of each unit of money over time. When comparing dollar figures from 
different times, it is important to keep in mind that a dollar today is not the same 
as a dollar 20 years ago or, most likely, 20 years from now.
This chapter has discussed how economists measure the overall level of prices 
in the economy and how they use price indexes to correct economic variables 
for the effects of inflation. Price indexes allow us to compare dollar figures from 
different points in time and, therefore, get a better sense of how the economy is 
changing. 
The discussion of price indexes in this chapter, together with the preceding 
chapter’s discussion of GDP, is only the first step in the study of macroeconomics. 
We have not yet examined what determines a nation’s GDP or the causes and 
effects of inflation. To do that, we need to go beyond issues of measurement. 
Indeed, that is our next task. Having explained how economists measure 
macroeconomic quantities and prices in the past two chapters, we are now ready 
to develop the models that explain movements in these variables.
Here is our strategy in the upcoming chapters. First, we look at the long-run 
determinants of real GDP and related variables, such as saving, investment, real 
interest rates, and unemployment. Second, we look at the long-run determinants 
of the price level and related variables, such as the money supply, inflation, and 
nominal interest rates. Last of all, having seen how these variables are determined 
in the long run, we examine the more complex question of what causes short-run 
fluctuations in real GDP and the price level. In all of these chapters, the measurement 
issues we have just discussed will provide the foundation for the analysis.

PART VIII   THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS
r The consumer price index (CPI) shows the cost of 
a basket of goods and services relative to the cost of 
the same basket in the base year. The index is used  
to measure the overall level of prices in the economy. 
The percentage change in the CPI measures the 
inflation rate.
r The CPI is an imperfect measure of the cost of living 
for three reasons. First, it does not take into account 
consumers’ ability to substitute toward goods that 
become relatively cheaper over time. Second, it does 
not take into account increases in the purchasing 
power of the dollar due to the introduction of new 
goods. Third, it is distorted by unmeasured changes 
in the quality of goods and services. Because of these 
measurement problems, the CPI overstates true 
inflation.
r Like the CPI, the GDP deflator measures the overall 
level of prices in the economy. The two price indexes 
usually move together, but there are important 
differences. The GDP deflator differs from the CPI 
because it includes goods and services produced 
rather than goods and services consumed. As a result, 
imported goods affect the CPI but not the GDP deflator. 
In addition, while the CPI uses a fixed basket of goods, 
the GDP deflator automatically changes the group of 
goods and services over time as the composition of 
GDP changes. 
r Dollar figures from different times do not represent a 
valid comparison of purchasing power. To compare a 
dollar figure from the past to a dollar figure today, the 
older figure should be inflated using a price index. 
r Various laws and private contracts use price indexes 
to correct for the effects of inflation. The tax laws, 
however, are only partially indexed for inflation.
r A correction for inflation is especially important when 
looking at data on interest rates. The nominal interest 
rate is the interest rate usually reported; it is the rate 
at which the number of dollars in a savings account 
increases over time. By contrast, the real interest rate 
takes into account changes in the value of the dollar 
over time. The real interest rate equals the nominal 
interest rate minus the rate of inflation.

a. Using a method similar to the CPI, compute 
the percentage change in the overall price level. 
Use 2017 as the base year and fix the basket at 1 
karaoke machine and 3 CDs.
b. Using a method similar to the GDP deflator, 
compute the percentage change in the overall 
price level. Also use 2017 as the base year.
c. Is the inflation rate in 2018 the same using the two 
methods? Explain why or why not.
6. Which of the problems in the construction of the 
CPI might be illustrated by each of the following 
situations? Explain.
a. the invention of cell phones
b. the introduction of air bags in cars
c. increased personal computer purchases in 
response to a decline in their price
d. more scoops of raisins in each package of Raisin 
Bran
e. greater use of fuel-efficient cars after gasoline 
prices increase
7. A dozen eggs cost $0.88 in January 1980 and $2.11 
in January 2015. The average wage for production 
workers was $7.58 per hour in January 1980 and 
$19.64 in January 2015.
a. By what percentage did the price of eggs rise?
b. By what percentage did the wage rise?
c. In each year, how many minutes did a worker 
have to work to earn enough to buy a  
dozen eggs?
d. Did workers’ purchasing power in terms of eggs 
rise or fall?
8. The chapter explains that Social Security benefits are 
increased each year in proportion to the increase in 
the CPI, even though most economists believe that the 
CPI overstates actual inflation.
a. If the elderly consume the same market basket 
as other people, does Social Security provide the 
elderly with an improvement in their standard of 
living each year? Explain.
b. In fact, the elderly consume more healthcare com-
pared to younger people, and healthcare costs 
have risen faster than overall inflation. What 
would you do to determine whether the elderly 
are actually better off from year to year?

9. Suppose that a borrower and a lender agree on the 
nominal interest rate to be paid on a loan. Then infla-
tion turns out to be higher than they both expected.
a. Is the real interest rate on this loan higher or lower 
than expected?
b. Does the lender gain or lose from this 
unexpectedly high inflation? Does the borrower 
gain or lose?
c. Inflation during the 1970s was much higher 
than most people had expected when the decade 
began. How did this affect homeowners who 
obtained fixed-rate mortgages during the 1960s? 
How did it affect the banks that lent the money?

hen you travel around the world, you see tremendous variation in the 
standard of living. The average income in a rich country, such as the United 
States, Japan, or Germany, is about ten times the average income in a poor 
country, such as India, Nigeria, or Nicaragua. These large differences in income 
are reflected in large differences in the quality of life. People in richer countries 
have better nutrition, safer housing, better healthcare, and longer life expectancy 
as well as more automobiles, more telephones, and more computers. 
Even within a country, there are large changes in the standard of living over 
time. In the United States over the past century, average income as measured 
by real gross domestic product (GDP) per person has grown by 
about 2 percent per year. Although 2 percent might

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
seem small, this rate of growth implies that average income doubles every 35 
years. Because of this growth, most Americans enjoy much greater economic 
prosperity than did their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. 
Growth rates vary substantially from country to country. From 2000 to 2014, 
GDP per person in China grew at a rate of 11 percent per year, accumulating to 
a 357 percent increase in average income. A country experiencing such rapid 
growth can, in one generation, go from being among the poorest in the world to 
being among the richest. By contrast, in the same time span, income per person in 
Zimbabwe fell by a total of 13 percent, leaving the typical citizen mired in poverty.
What explains these diverse experiences? How can rich countries maintain 
their high standard of living? What policies can poor countries pursue to promote 
more rapid growth and join the developed world? These are among the most 
important questions in macroeconomics. As the Nobel-Prize-winning economist 
Robert Lucas put it, “The consequences for human welfare in questions like these 
are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think 
about anything else.”
In the previous two chapters, we discussed how economists measure mac-
roeconomic quantities and prices. We can now begin to study the forces that  
determine these variables. As we have seen, an economy’s GDP measures both 
the total income earned in the economy and the total expenditure on the econ-
omy’s output of goods and services. The level of real GDP is a good gauge of 
economic prosperity, and the growth of real GDP is a good gauge of economic 
progress. In this chapter we focus on the long-run determinants of the level and 
growth of real GDP. Later, we study the short-run fluctuations of real GDP around 
its long-run trend.
We proceed here in three steps. First, we examine international data on real 
GDP per person. These data will give you some sense of how much the level and 
growth of living standards vary around the world. Second, we examine the role 
of productivity—the amount of goods and services produced for each hour of a 
worker’s time. In particular, we see that a nation’s standard of living is deter-
mined by the productivity of its workers, and we consider the factors that deter-
mine a nation’s productivity. Third, we consider the link between productivity 
and the economic policies that a nation pursues.
25-1 Economic Growth around the World
As a starting point for our study of long-run growth, let’s look at the experiences 
of some of the world’s economies. Table 1 shows data on real GDP per person for 
thirteen countries. For each country, the data span over a century of history. The 
first and second columns of the table present the countries and time periods. (The 
time periods differ somewhat from country to country because of differences in 
data availability.) The third and fourth columns show estimates of real GDP per 
person more than a century ago and for a recent year.
The data on real GDP per person show that living standards vary widely from 
country to country. Income per person in the United States, for instance, is now 
about four times that in China and about ten times that in India. The poorest 
countries have average levels of income not seen in the developed world for many 
decades. The typical resident of Pakistan in 2014 had about the same real income 
as the typical resident of the United Kingdom in 1870. The typical Bangladeshi in 
2014 had considerably less real income than a typical American in 1870.

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
The last column of the table shows each country’s growth rate. The growth 
rate measures how rapidly real income per person grew in the typical year. In 
the United States, for example, where real income per person was $4,264 in 1870 
and $55,860 in 2014, the growth rate was 1.80 percent per year. This means that 
if real income per person, beginning at $4,264, were to increase by 1.80 percent 
for each of 144 years, it would end up at $55,860. Of course, income did not rise 
exactly 1.80 percent every year: Some years it rose by more, other years it rose by 
less, and in still other years it fell. The growth rate of 1.80 percent per year ignores 
short-run fluctuations around the long-run trend and represents an average rate 
of growth for real income per person over many years. 
The countries in Table 1 are ordered by their growth rate from the most to the 
least rapid. Here you can see the large variety in growth experiences. High on 
the list are Brazil and China, which went from being among the poorest nations 
in the world to being among middle-income nations. Also high on the list is 
Japan, which went from being a middle-income nation to being among the richest 
nations. 
Near the bottom of the list you can find Pakistan and Bangladesh, which 
were among the poorest nations at the end of the nineteenth century and remain 
so today. At the bottom of the list is the United Kingdom. In 1870, the United 
Kingdom was the richest country in the world, with average income about 20 
percent higher than that of the United States and more than twice Canada’s. 
Today, average income in the United Kingdom is 30 percent below that of the 
United States and 10 percent below Canada’s.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
These data show that the world’s richest countries have no guarantee they will 
stay the richest and that the world’s poorest countries are not doomed to remain 
forever in poverty. But what explains these changes over time? Why do some 
countries zoom ahead while others lag behind? These are precisely the questions 
that we take up next.
QuickQuiz
What has been the approximate long-run growth rate of real GDP per person 
in the United States? Name a country that has had faster growth and a 
country that has had slower growth.
Are You Richer Than the Richest American?
A
merican Heritage magazine once published a list of the richest 
Americans of all time. The number 1 spot went to John D. 
Rockefeller, the oil entrepreneur who lived from 1839 to 1937. According 
to the magazine’s calculations, his wealth would today be the equivalent 
of about $200 billion, almost three times that of Bill Gates, the software 
entrepreneur who is today’s richest American.
Despite his great wealth, Rockefeller did not enjoy many of the 
conveniences that we now take for granted. He couldn’t watch television, 
play video games, surf the Internet, or send e-mail. During the heat of 
summer, he couldn’t cool his home 
with air-conditioning. For much of his 
life, he couldn’t travel by car or plane, 
and he couldn’t use a telephone to 
call friends or family. If he became ill, 
he couldn’t take advantage of many 
medicines, such as antibiotics, that 
doctors today routinely use to prolong 
and enhance life.
Now consider: How 
m u c h  m o n e y  w o u l d 
someone have to pay you 
to give up for the rest of 
your life all the modern 
conveniences that Rockefeller 
lived without? Would you do it for $200 
billion? Perhaps not. And if you wouldn’t, is it fair to say that you are 
better off than John D. Rockefeller, allegedly the richest American ever?
The preceding chapter discussed how standard price indexes, which 
are used to compare sums of money from different points in time, fail to 
fully reflect the introduction of new goods in the economy. As a result, 
the rate of inflation is overestimated. The flip side of this observation 
is that the rate of real economic growth is underestimated. Pondering 
Rockefeller’s life shows how significant this problem might be. Because 
of tremendous technological advances, the average American today is 
arguably “richer” than the richest American a century ago, even if that 
fact is lost in standard economic statistics. ■

25-2 Productivity: Its Role and Determinants 
Explaining why living standards vary so much around the world is, in one sense, 
very easy. The answer can be summarized in a single word—productivity. But in 
another sense, the international variation in living standards is deeply puzzling. 
To explain why incomes are so much higher in some countries than in others, we 
must look at the many factors that determine a nation’s productivity.
25-2a Why Productivity Is So Important
Let’s begin our study of productivity and economic growth by developing a 
simple model based loosely on Daniel Defoe’s famous novel Robinson Crusoe
about a sailor stranded on a desert island. Because Crusoe lives alone, he

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
catches his own fish, grows his own vegetables, and makes his own clothes. 
We can think of Crusoe’s activities—his production and consumption of 
fish, vegetables, and clothing—as a simple economy. By examining Crusoe’s 
economy, we can learn some lessons that also apply to more complex and 
realistic economies.
What determines Crusoe’s standard of living? In a word, productivity, the 
quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input. If Crusoe 
is good at catching fish, growing vegetables, and making clothes, he lives well. If 
he is bad at doing these things, he lives poorly. Because Crusoe gets to consume 
only what he produces, his living standard is tied to his productivity.
In the case of Crusoe’s economy, it is easy to see that productivity is the key 
determinant of living standards and that growth in productivity is the key 
determinant of growth in living standards. The more fish Crusoe can catch per 
hour, the more he eats at dinner. If Crusoe finds a better place to catch fish, his 
productivity rises. This increase in productivity makes Crusoe better off: He 
can eat the extra fish, or he can spend less time fishing and devote more time to 
making other goods he enjoys.
Productivity’s key role in determining living standards is as true for nations 
as it is for stranded sailors. Recall that an economy’s GDP measures two things 
at once: the total income earned by everyone in the economy and the total 
expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDP can measure 
these two things simultaneously because, for the economy as a whole, they must 
be equal. Put simply, an economy’s income is the economy’s output. 
Like Crusoe, a nation can enjoy a high standard of living only if it can 
produce a large quantity of goods and services. Americans live better than 
Nigerians because American workers are more productive than Nigerian 
workers. The Japanese have enjoyed more rapid growth in living standards 
than Argentineans because Japanese workers have experienced more rapid 
growth in productivity. Indeed, one of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1 is that a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to 
produce goods and services.
Hence, to understand the large differences in living standards we observe 
across countries or over time, we must focus on the production of goods and 
services. But seeing the link between living standards and productivity is only 
the first step. It leads naturally to the next question: Why are some economies so 
much better at producing goods and services than others?
25-2b How Productivity Is Determined
Although productivity is uniquely important in determining Robinson Crusoe’s 
standard of living, many factors determine Crusoe’s productivity. Crusoe will be 
better at catching fish, for instance, if he has more fishing poles, if he has been 
trained in the best fishing techniques, if his island has a plentiful fish supply, 
or if he invents a better fishing lure. Each of these determinants of Crusoe’s 
productivity—which we can call physical capital, human capital, natural resources, 
and technological knowledge—has a counterpart in more complex and realistic 
economies. Let’s consider each factor in turn. 
Physical Capital per Worker  Workers are more productive if they have tools 
with which to work. The stock of equipment and structures used to produce 
goods and services is called physical capital, or just capital. For example, 
productivity
the quantity of goods and 
services produced from 
each unit of labor input
physical capital
the stock of equipment 
and structures that are 
used to produce goods 
and services

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Statistics
G
eorge Bernard Shaw once said, “It is the mark of a truly intelligent 
person to be moved by statistics.” Most of us, however, have trouble 
being moved by data on GDP—until we see with our own eyes what 
these statistics represent. 
The three photos on these pages show a typical family from each of 
three countries—the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Mali. Each family was 
photographed outside their home, together with all their material possessions. 
These nations have very different standards of living, as judged by 
these photos, GDP, or other statistics. 
•  The United Kingdom is an advanced economy. In 2014, its income per 
person was $39,040. A baby born in the United Kingdom can expect 
a relatively healthy childhood: Only 4 out of 1,000 children die before 
reaching age 5. Almost the entire population has access to modern 
sanitation facilities, such as a bathroom and sewer system, to safely 
remove human waste. Educational attainment is high: Among indi-
viduals of college age, 60 percent are enrolled in higher education. 
• Mexico is a mid-
dle-income country. 
In 2014, its income 
per person was 
$16,640. About 13 out 
of 1,000 children die 
before age 5. About 85 percent 
have access to modern sanitation. Among those of college age, 30 
percent are enrolled. 
•  Mali is a poor country. In 2014, its income per person was only 
$1,510. Life is often cut short: 115 out of 1,000 children die before 
age 5. Only 25 percent of the population has access to modern san-
itation. And educational attainment in Mali is low: Among those of 
college age, only 7 percent are enrolled. 
Economists who study economic growth try to understand what causes 
such large differences in the standard of living. ■

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
when woodworkers make furniture, they use saws, lathes, and drill presses. 
More tools allow the woodworkers to produce their output more quickly and 
more accurately: A worker with only basic hand tools can make less furniture 
each week than a worker with sophisticated and specialized woodworking 
equipment. 
As you may recall, the inputs used to produce goods and services—labor, 
capital, and so on—are called the factors of production. An important feature of 
capital is that it is a produced factor of production. That is, capital is an input 
into the production process that in the past was an output from the production 
process. The woodworker uses a lathe to make the leg of a table. Earlier, the lathe 
itself was the output of a firm that manufactures lathes. The lathe manufacturer 
in turn used other equipment to make its product. Thus, capital is a factor of 
production used to produce all kinds of goods and services, including more 
capital.
Human Capital per Worker  A second determinant of productivity is human 
capital. Human capital is the economist’s term for the knowledge and skills that 
workers acquire through education, training, and experience. Human capital 
includes the skills accumulated in early childhood programs, grade school, high 
school, college, and on-the-job training for adults in the labor force. 
Education, training, and experience are less tangible than lathes, bulldozers, 
and buildings, but human capital is similar to physical capital in many ways. 
Like physical capital, human capital raises a nation’s ability to produce goods 
and services. Also like physical capital, human capital is a produced factor of 
production. Producing human capital requires inputs in the form of teachers, 
libraries, and student time. Indeed, students can be viewed as “workers” who 
have the important job of producing the human capital that will be used in future 
production.
Natural Resources per Worker  A third determinant of productivity is natural 
resources. Natural resources are inputs into production that are provided by 
nature, such as land, rivers, and mineral deposits. Natural resources take two 
forms: renewable and nonrenewable. A forest is an example of a renewable 
resource. When one tree is cut down, a seedling can be planted in its place to be 
harvested in the future. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource. Because oil 
is produced by nature over many millions of years, there is only a limited supply. 
Once the supply of oil is depleted, it is impossible to create more.
Differences in natural resources are responsible for some of the differences in 
standards of living around the world. The historical success of the United States 
was driven in part by the large supply of land well suited for agriculture. Today, 
some countries in the Middle East, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are rich 
simply because they happen to be on top of some of the largest pools of oil in the 
world. 
Although natural resources can be important, they are not necessary for an 
economy to be highly productive in producing goods and services. Japan, for 
instance, is one of the richest countries in the world, despite having few natural 
resources. International trade makes Japan’s success possible. Japan imports 
many of the natural resources it needs, such as oil, and exports its manufactured 
goods to economies rich in natural resources.

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
Technological Knowledge  A fourth determinant of productivity is technological 
knowledge—the understanding of the best ways to produce goods and services. 
A hundred years ago, most Americans worked on farms because farm technology 
required a high input of labor to feed the entire population. Today, thanks to 
advances in farming technology, a small fraction of the population can produce 
enough food to feed the entire country. This technological change made labor 
available to produce other goods and services.
Technological knowledge takes many forms. Some technology is common 
knowledge—after one person uses it, everyone becomes aware of it. For example, 
once Henry Ford successfully introduced assembly-line production, other 
carmakers quickly followed suit. Other technology is proprietary—it is known 
only by the company that discovers it. Only the Coca-Cola Company, for instance, 
knows the secret recipe for making its famous soft drink. Still other technology is 
proprietary for a short time. When a pharmaceutical company discovers a new 
drug, the patent system gives that company a temporary right to be its exclusive 
manufacturer. When the patent expires, however, other companies are allowed to 
make the drug. All these forms of technological knowledge are important for the 
economy’s production of goods and services.
It is worthwhile to distinguish between technological knowledge and human 
capital. Although they are closely related, there is an important difference. 
technological knowledge
society’s understanding of 
the best ways to produce 
goods and services
The Production Function
E
conomists often use a production function to describe the relationship 
between the quantity of inputs used in production and the quantity of 
output from production. For example, suppose Y denotes the quantity of 
output, L the quantity of labor, K the quantity of physical capital, H the 
quantity of human capital, and N the quantity of natural resources. Then 
we might write
Y 5 AF(L, K, H, N),
where F( ) is a function that shows how the inputs are combined to 
produce output. A is a variable that reflects the available production 
technology. As technology improves, A rises, so the economy produces 
more output from any given combination of inputs.
Many production functions have a property called constant returns 
to scale. If a production function has constant returns to scale, then 
doubling all inputs causes the amount of output to double as well. 
Mathematically, we write that a production function has constant 
returns to scale if, for any positive number x,
xY 5 AF(xL, xK, xH, xN ).
A doubling of all inputs 
would be represented in 
this equation by x 5 2. The 
right side shows the inputs 
doubling, and the left side 
shows output doubling.
Production functions with constant 
returns to scale have an interesting and useful implication. To see this 
implication, set x 5 1/L so that the preceding equation becomes
Y/L 5 AF(1, K/L, H/L, N/L).
Notice that Y/L is output per worker, which is a measure of productivity. 
This equation says that labor productivity depends on physical capital 
per worker (K/L), human capital per worker (H/L), and natural resources 
per worker (N/L). Productivity also depends on the state of technology, as 
reflected by the variable A. Thus, this equation provides a mathematical 
summary of the four determinants of productivity we have just 
discussed. ■

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
Technological knowledge refers to society’s understanding about how the 
world works. Human capital refers to the resources expended transmitting this 
understanding to the labor force. To use a relevant metaphor, technological 
knowledge is the quality of society’s textbooks, whereas human capital is the 
amount of time that the population has devoted to reading them. Workers’ 
productivity depends on both.
CASE 
STUDY
ARE NATURAL RESOURCES A LIMIT TO GROWTH?
Today, the world’s population is over 7 billion, more than four 
times what it was a century ago. At the same time, many people 
are enjoying a much higher standard of living than did their great-
grandparents. A perennial debate concerns whether this growth in 
population and living standards can continue in the future.
Many commentators have argued that natural resources will eventually limit 
how much the world’s economies can grow. At first, this argument might seem 
hard to ignore. If the world has only a fixed supply of nonrenewable natural 
resources, how can population, production, and living standards continue to grow 
over time? Eventually, won’t supplies of oil and minerals start to run out? When 
these shortages start to occur, won’t they stop economic growth and, perhaps, even 
force living standards to fall? 
Despite the apparent appeal of such arguments, most economists are less 
concerned about such limits to growth than one might guess. They argue that 
technological progress often yields ways to avoid these limits. If we compare the 
economy today to the economy of the past, we see various ways in which the use of 
natural resources has improved. Modern cars have better gas mileage. New houses 
have better insulation and require less energy to heat and cool. More efficient oil 
rigs waste less oil in the process of extraction. Recycling allows some nonrenewable 
resources to be reused. The development of alternative fuels, such as ethanol 
instead of gasoline, allows us to substitute renewable for nonrenewable resources.
Seventy years ago, some conservationists were concerned about the excessive 
use of tin and copper. At the time, these were crucial commodities: Tin was used 
to make many food containers, and copper was used to make telephone wire. 
Some people advocated mandatory recycling and rationing of tin and copper so 
that supplies would be available for future generations. Today, however, plastic has 
replaced tin as a material for making many food containers, and phone calls often 
travel over fiber-optic cables, which are made from sand. Technological progress 
has made once crucial natural resources less necessary.
But are all these efforts enough to permit continued economic growth? One way 
to answer this question is to look at the prices of natural resources. In a market 
economy, scarcity is reflected in market prices. If the world were running out of 
natural resources, then the prices of those resources would be rising over time. But 
in fact, the opposite is more often true. Natural resource prices exhibit substantial 
short-run fluctuations, but over long spans of time, the prices of most natural 
resources (adjusted for overall inflation) are stable or falling. It appears that our 
ability to conserve these resources is growing more rapidly than their supplies are 
dwindling. Market prices give no reason to believe that natural resources are a limit 
to economic growth. ●

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
25-3 Economic Growth and Public Policy
So far, we have determined that a society’s standard of living depends on its 
ability to produce goods and services and that its productivity in turn depends 
on physical capital per worker, human capital per worker, natural resources 
per worker, and technological knowledge. Let’s now turn to the question faced 
by policymakers around the world: What can government policy do to raise 
productivity and living standards?
25-3a Saving and Investment
Because capital is a produced factor of production, a society can change the 
amount of capital it has. If today the economy produces a large quantity of new 
capital goods, then tomorrow it will have a larger stock of capital and be able to 
produce more goods and services. Thus, one way to raise future productivity is to 
invest more current resources in the production of capital.
One of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people 
face trade-offs. This principle is especially important when considering the 
accumulation of capital. Because resources are scarce, devoting more resources 
to producing capital requires devoting fewer resources to producing goods and 
services for current consumption. That is, for society to invest more in capital, it 
must consume less and save more of its current income. The growth that arises 
from capital accumulation is not a free lunch: It requires that society sacrifice 
consumption of goods and services in the present to enjoy higher consumption in 
the future. 
The next chapter examines in more detail how an economy’s financial markets 
coordinate saving and investment. It also examines how government policies 
influence the amount of saving and investment that take place. At this point, it 
is important to note that encouraging saving and investment is one way that a 
government can encourage growth and, in the long run, raise an economy’s 
standard of living. 
25-3b Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect
Suppose that a government pursues policies that raise the nation’s saving 
rate—the percentage of GDP devoted to saving rather than consumption. What 
happens? With the nation saving more, fewer resources are needed to make 
consumption goods and more resources are available to make capital goods. As 
a result, the capital stock increases, leading to rising productivity and more rapid 
growth in GDP. But how long does this higher rate of growth last? Assuming that 
the saving rate remains at its new, higher level, does the growth rate of GDP stay 
high indefinitely or only for a period of time?
The traditional view of the production process is that capital is subject to 
diminishing returns: As the stock of capital rises, the extra output produced 
from an additional unit of capital falls. In other words, when workers already 
have a large quantity of capital to use in producing goods and services, giving 
them an additional unit of capital increases their productivity only slightly. This 
is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows how the amount of capital per worker 
determines the amount of output per worker, holding constant all the other 
determinants of output (such as natural resources and technological knowledge). 
Because of diminishing returns, an increase in the saving rate leads to higher 
growth only for a while. As the higher saving rate allows more capital to be 
accumulated, the benefits from additional capital become smaller over time, and 
diminishing returns
the property whereby the 
benefit from an extra unit 
of an input declines as 
the quantity of the input 
increases

526
PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
so growth slows down. In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a higher level of 
productivity and income but not to higher growth in these variables. Reaching this long 
run, however, can take quite a while. According to studies of international data 
on economic growth, increasing the saving rate can lead to substantially higher 
growth for a period of several decades.
The property of diminishing returns to capital has another important 
implication: Other things being equal, it is easier for a country to grow fast if it 
starts out relatively poor. This effect of initial conditions on subsequent growth 
is sometimes called the catch-up effect. In poor countries, workers lack even 
the most rudimentary tools and, as a result, have low productivity. Thus, small 
amounts of capital investment can substantially raise these workers’ productivity. 
By contrast, workers in rich countries have large amounts of capital with which 
to work, and this partly explains their high productivity. Yet with the amount of 
capital per worker already so high, additional capital investment has a relatively 
small effect on productivity. Studies of international data on economic growth 
confirm this catch-up effect: Controlling for other variables, such as the percentage 
of GDP devoted to investment, poor countries tend to grow at faster rates than 
rich countries.
This catch-up effect can help explain some otherwise puzzling facts. Here’s an 
example: From 1960 to 1990, the United States and South Korea devoted a similar 
share of GDP to investment. Yet over this time, the United States experienced only 
mediocre growth of about 2 percent, while South Korea experienced spectacular 
growth of more than 6 percent. The explanation is the catch-up effect. In 1960, 
South Korea had GDP per person less than one-tenth the U.S. level, in part 
because previous investment had been so low. With a small initial capital stock, 
the benefits to capital accumulation were much greater in South Korea, and this 
gave South Korea a higher subsequent growth rate.

This figure shows how the amount of 
capital per worker influences the amount

as the amount of capital increases 
because of diminishing returns to capital.

527
CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
This catch-up effect shows up in other aspects of life. When a school gives an 
end-of-year award to the “Most Improved” student, that student is usually one 
who began the year with relatively poor performance. Students who began the 
year not studying find improvement easier than students who always worked 
hard. Note that it is good to be “Most Improved,” given the starting point, but it is 
even better to be “Best Student.” Similarly, economic growth over the last several 
decades has been much more rapid in South Korea than in the United States, but 
GDP per person is still higher in the United States.
25-3c Investment from Abroad
So far, we have discussed how policies aimed at increasing a country’s saving rate 
can increase investment and, thereby, long-term economic growth. Yet saving by 
domestic residents is not the only way for a country to invest in new capital. The 
other way is investment by foreigners. 
Investment from abroad takes several forms. Ford Motor Company might 
build a car factory in Mexico. A capital investment that is owned and operated by 
a foreign entity is called foreign direct investment. Alternatively, an American might 
buy stock in a Mexican corporation (that is, buy a share in the ownership of the 
corporation), and the corporation can use the proceeds from the stock sale to build 
a new factory. An investment that is financed with foreign money but operated by 
domestic residents is called foreign portfolio investment. In both cases, Americans 
provide the resources necessary to increase the stock of capital in Mexico. That is, 
American saving is being used to finance Mexican investment.
When foreigners invest in a country, they do so because they expect to earn a 
return on their investment. Ford’s car factory increases the Mexican capital stock 
and, therefore, increases Mexican productivity and Mexican GDP. Yet Ford takes 
some of this additional income back to the United States in the form of profit. 
Similarly, when an American investor buys Mexican stock, the investor has a right 
to a portion of the profit that the Mexican corporation earns.
Investment from abroad, therefore, does not have the same effect on all 
measures of economic prosperity. Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is 
the income earned within a country by both residents and nonresidents, whereas 
gross national product (GNP) is the income earned by residents of a country both 
at home and abroad. When Ford opens its car factory in Mexico, some of the 
income the factory generates accrues to people who do not live in Mexico. As a 
result, foreign investment in Mexico raises the income of Mexicans (measured by 
GNP) by less than it raises the production in Mexico (measured by GDP).
Nonetheless, investment from abroad is one way for a country to grow. Even 
though some of the benefits from this investment flow back to the foreign owners, 
this investment does increase the economy’s stock of capital, leading to higher 
productivity and higher wages. Moreover, investment from abroad is one way 
for poor countries to learn the state-of-the-art technologies developed and used 
in richer countries. For these reasons, many economists who advise governments 
in less developed economies advocate policies that encourage investment from 
abroad. Often, this means removing restrictions that governments have imposed 
on foreign ownership of domestic capital.
An organization that tries to encourage the flow of capital to poor countries is 
the World Bank. This international organization obtains funds from the world’s 
advanced countries, such as the United States, and uses these resources to make 
loans to less developed countries so that they can invest in roads, sewer systems, 
schools, and other types of capital. It also offers the countries advice about how

the funds might best be used. The World Bank and its sister organization, the 
International Monetary Fund, were set up after World War II. One lesson from 
the war was that economic distress often leads to political turmoil, international 
tensions, and military conflict. Thus, every country has an interest in promoting 
economic prosperity around the world. The World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund were established to achieve that common goal.
25-3d Education
Education—investment in human capital—is at least as important as investment 
in physical capital for a country’s long-run economic success. In the United States, 
each year of schooling has historically raised a person’s wage by an average of 
about 10 percent. In less developed countries, where human capital is especially 
scarce, the gap between the wages of educated and uneducated workers is even 
larger. Thus, one way government policy can enhance the standard of living is to 
provide good schools and to encourage the population to take advantage of them.
Investment in human capital, like investment in physical capital, has an 
opportunity cost. When students are in school, they forgo the wages they could 
have earned as members of the labor force. In less developed countries, children 
often drop out of school at an early age, even though the benefit of additional 
schooling is very high, simply because their labor is needed to help support the 
family.
Some economists have argued that human capital is particularly important 
for economic growth because human capital conveys positive externalities. An 
externality is the effect of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. 
An educated person, for instance, might generate new ideas about how best to 
produce goods and services. If these ideas enter society’s pool of knowledge so 
that everyone can use them, then the ideas are an external benefit of education. In 
this case, the return from schooling for society is even greater than the return for 
the individual. This argument would justify the large subsidies to human-capital 
investment that we observe in the form of public education. 
One problem facing some poor countries is the brain drain—the emigration 
of many of the most highly educated workers to rich countries, where these 
workers can enjoy a higher standard of living. If human capital does have positive 
externalities, then this brain drain makes those people left behind even poorer. 
This problem offers policymakers a dilemma. On the one hand, the United States 
and other rich countries have the best systems of higher education, and it would 
seem natural for poor countries to send their best students abroad to earn higher 
degrees. On the other hand, those students who have spent time abroad may 
choose not to return home, and this brain drain will reduce the poor nation’s stock 
of human capital even further.
25-3e Health and Nutrition
The term human capital usually refers to education, but it can also be used to 
describe another type of investment in people: expenditures that lead to a healthier 
population. Other things being equal, healthier workers are more productive. The 
right investments in the health of the population provide one way for a nation to 
increase productivity and raise living standards.
According to the late economic historian Robert Fogel, improved health 
from better nutrition has been a significant factor in long-run economic growth. 
Fogel estimated that in Great Britain in 1780, about one in five people were so 
malnourished that they were incapable of manual labor. Among those who could

529
CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
work, insufficient caloric intake substantially reduced the work effort they could 
put forth. As nutrition improved, so did workers’ productivity.
Fogel studied these historical trends in part by looking at the height of 
the population. Short stature can be an indicator of malnutrition, especially 
during gestation and the early years of life. Fogel found that as nations develop 
economically, people eat more and the population gets taller. From 1775 to 1975, 
the average caloric intake in Great Britain rose by 26 percent and the height of the 
average man rose by 3.6 inches. Similarly, during the spectacular economic growth 
in South Korea from 1962 to 1995, caloric consumption rose by 44 percent and 
average male height rose by 2 inches. Of course, a person’s height is determined 
by a combination of genetics and environment. But because the genetic makeup 
of a population is slow to change, such increases in average height are most likely 
due to changes in the environment—nutrition being the obvious explanation.
Moreover, studies have found that height is an indicator of productivity. 
Looking at data on a large number of workers at a point in time, researchers have 
found that taller workers tend to earn more. Because wages reflect a worker’s 
productivity, this finding suggests that taller workers tend to be more productive. 
The effect of height on wages is especially pronounced in poorer countries, where 
malnutrition is a bigger risk. 
Fogel won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993 for his work in economic 
history, which includes not only his studies of nutrition but also his studies of 
American slavery and the role of railroads in the development of the American 
economy. In the lecture he gave when he was awarded the prize, he surveyed the 
evidence on health and economic growth. He concluded that “improved gross 
nutrition accounts for roughly 30 percent of the growth of per capita income in 
Britain between 1790 and 1980.”
Today, malnutrition is fortunately rare in developed nations such as Great 
Britain and the United States. (Obesity is a more widespread problem.) But for 
people in developing nations, poor health and inadequate nutrition remain 
obstacles to higher productivity and improved living standards. The United 
Nations estimates that almost a third of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is 
undernourished.
The causal link between health and wealth runs in both directions. Poor 
countries are poor in part because their populations are not healthy, and their 
populations are not healthy in part because they are poor and cannot afford 
adequate healthcare and nutrition. It is a vicious circle. But this fact opens the 
possibility of a virtuous circle: Policies that lead to more rapid economic growth 
would naturally improve health outcomes, which in turn would further promote 
economic growth.
25-3f Property Rights and Political Stability
Another way policymakers can foster economic growth is by protecting property 
rights and promoting political stability. This issue goes to the very heart of how 
market economies work.
Production in market economies arises from the interactions of millions of 
individuals and firms. When you buy a car, for instance, you are buying the 
output of a car dealer, a car manufacturer, a steel company, an iron ore mining 
company, and so on. This division of production among many firms allows the 
economy’s factors of production to be used as effectively as possible. To achieve 
this outcome, the economy has to coordinate transactions among these firms, as 
well as between firms and consumers. Market economies achieve this coordination

530
PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
through market prices. That is, market prices are the instrument with which the 
invisible hand of the marketplace brings supply and demand into balance in each 
of the many thousands of markets that make up the economy.
An important prerequisite for the price system to work is an economy-wide 
respect for property rights. Property rights refer to the ability of people to exercise 
authority over the resources they own. A mining company will not make the 
effort to mine iron ore if it expects the ore to be stolen. The company mines the 
ore only if it is confident that it will benefit from the ore’s subsequent sale. For 
this reason, courts serve an important role in a market economy: They enforce 
property rights. Through the criminal justice system, the courts discourage theft. 
In addition, through the civil justice system, the courts ensure that buyers and 
sellers live up to their contracts.
Those of us in developed countries tend to take property rights for granted, 
but those living in less developed countries understand that a lack of property 
rights can be a major problem. In many countries, the system of justice does not 
work well. Contracts are hard to enforce, and fraud often goes unpunished. In 
more extreme cases, the government not only fails to enforce property rights but 
actually infringes upon them. To do business in some countries, firms are expected 
to bribe government officials. Such corruption impedes the coordinating power of 
markets. It also discourages domestic saving and investment from abroad. 
One threat to property rights is political instability. When revolutions and 
coups are common, there is doubt about whether property rights will be respected 
in the future. If a revolutionary government might confiscate the capital of some 
businesses, as was often true after communist revolutions, domestic residents 
have less incentive to save, invest, and start new businesses. At the same time, 
foreigners have less incentive to invest in the country. Even the threat of revolution 
can act to depress a nation’s standard of living.
Thus, economic prosperity depends in part on political prosperity. A country 
with an efficient court system, honest government officials, and a stable 
constitution will enjoy a higher economic standard of living than a country with a 
poor court system, corrupt officials, and frequent revolutions and coups.
25-3g Free Trade
Some of the world’s poorest countries have tried to achieve more rapid economic 
growth by pursuing inward-oriented policies. These policies attempt to increase 
productivity and living standards within the country by avoiding interaction 
with the rest of the world. Domestic firms often advance the infant-industry 
argument, claiming they need protection from foreign competition to thrive and 
grow. Together with a general distrust of foreigners, this argument has at times 
led policymakers in less developed countries to impose tariffs and other trade 
restrictions.
Most economists today believe that poor countries are better off pursuing 
outward-oriented policies that integrate these countries into the world economy. 
International trade in goods and services can improve the economic well-being of 
a country’s citizens. Trade is, in some ways, a type of technology. When a country 
exports wheat and imports textiles, the country benefits as if it had invented a 
technology for turning wheat into textiles. A country that eliminates trade 
restrictions will, therefore, experience the same kind of economic growth that 
would occur after a major technological advance. 
The adverse impact of inward orientation becomes clear when one considers 
the small size of many less developed economies. The total GDP of Argentina,

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
for instance, is about that of Houston, Texas. Imagine what would happen if the 
Houston city council were to prohibit city residents from trading with people 
living outside the city limits. Without being able to take advantage of the gains 
from trade, Houston would need to produce all the goods it consumes. It would 
also have to produce all its own capital goods, rather than importing state-of-
the-art equipment from other cities. Living standards in Houston would fall 
immediately, and the problem would likely only get worse over time. This is 
precisely what happened when Argentina pursued inward-oriented policies 
throughout much of the 20th century. In contrast, countries that pursued outward-
oriented policies, such as South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, enjoyed high rates 
of economic growth.
The amount that a nation trades with others is determined not only by government 
policy but also by geography. Countries with natural seaports find trade easier than 
countries without this resource. It is not a coincidence that many of the world’s major 
cities, such as New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong, are located next to oceans. 
Similarly, because landlocked countries find international trade more difficult, they 
tend to have lower levels of income than countries with easy access to the world’s 
waterways. For example, countries with more than 80 percent of their population 
living within 100 kilometers of a coast have an average GDP per person about four 
times as large as countries with less than 20 percent of their population living near 
a coast. The critical importance of access to the sea helps explain why the African 
continent, which contains many landlocked countries, is so poor.
25-3h Research and Development
The primary reason that living standards are higher today than they 
were a century ago is that technological knowledge has advanced. 
The telephone, the transistor, the computer, and the internal 
combustion engine are among the thousands of innovations that 
have improved the ability to produce goods and services. 
Most technological advances come from private research by 
firms and individual inventors, but there is also a public interest 
in promoting these efforts. To a large extent, knowledge is a 
public good: That is, once one person discovers an idea, the idea 
enters society’s pool of knowledge and other people can freely 
use it. Just as government has a role in providing a public good 
such as national defense, it also has a role in encouraging the 
research and development of new technologies.
The U.S. government has long played a role in the creation 
and dissemination of technological knowledge. A century ago, 
the government sponsored research about farming methods and 
advised farmers how best to use their land. More recently, the U.S. 
government, through the Air Force and NASA, has supported 
aerospace research; as a result, the United States is a leading maker 
of rockets and planes. The government continues to encourage 
advances in knowledge with research grants from the National 
Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health and with 
tax breaks for firms engaging in research and development.
Yet another way in which government policy encourages 
research is through the patent system. When a person or firm 
creates an innovative product, such as a new drug, the inventor 
can apply for a patent. If the product is deemed truly original, 
“Future innovations worldwide will not be transformational 
enough to promote sustained per-capita economic growth rates 
in the United States and western Europe over the next century 
as high as those over the past 150 years.”

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
When economists look ahead to future tech-
nological progress, their crystal ball is often 
foggy.
Has All the Important Stuff  
Already Been Invented?
By Timothy Aeppel 
R
obert Gordon, a curmudgeonly 73-year-old 
economist, believes our best days are over. 
After a century of life-changing innovations 
that spurred growth, he says, human progress 
is slowing to a crawl. 
Joel Mokyr, a cheerful 67-year-old 
economist, imagines a coming age of new 
inventions, including gene therapies to prolong 
our life span and miracle seeds that can feed 
the world without fertilizers.
These big-name colleagues at 
Northwestern University represent opposite 
poles in the debate over the future of the 21st 
century economy: rapid innovation driven 
by robotic manufacturing, 3-D printing and 
cloud computing, versus years of job losses, 
stagnant wages and rising income inequality.
The divergent views are more than 
academic. For many Americans, the recession 
left behind the scars of lost jobs, lower wages 
and depressed home prices. The question is 
whether tough times are here for good. The 
answer depends on who you ask. 
“I think the rate of innovation is just 
getting faster and faster,” Mr. Mokyr said over 
noodles and spicy chicken at a Thai restaurant 
near the campus where he and Mr. Gordon have 
taught for four decades. 
“What’s the evidence of that?” snapped  
Mr. Gordon. “There isn’t any.”
The men get along fine when talk is limited 
to, say, faculty gossip. About the future, 
though, they bicker constantly. When Mr. Mokyr 
described life-prolonging medical advances, 
Mr. Gordon cut in: “Extending life without 
curing Alzheimer’s means people who can walk 
but can’t think.”
Mr. Gordon landed at Northwestern from 
the University of Chicago in the fall of 1973, 
a year before Mr. Mokyr arrived there from 
Yale after finishing his Ph.D. Their tit-for-tat 
repartee makes them popular speakers—for 
economists, at least…. 
The professors headlined a Bank of Korea 
event in Seoul earlier this month. “We always 
go mano-a-mano,” Mr. Mokyr said. “But we 
often end up talking about different things. 
Bob’s a macroeconomist, I’m an economic 
historian.”
Mr. Mokyr has long studied how new tools 
have led to economic breakthroughs. For 
example, how the development of telescopes 
allowed for rapid advances in astronomy. 
History makes him certain his colleague is 
wrong.
Mr. Gordon’s ideas, in fact, fly in the 
face of modern economic orthodoxy. Since 
Nobel economist Robert Solow first argued 
in the 1950s that growth was driven by new 
technology, most economists have embraced 
the idea. Progress may be uneven, according to 
this view, but there is no reason to expect the 
world to run out of ideas.
“Bob says the low-hanging fruit has been 
picked, because we won’t invent indoor plumbing 
again,” Mr. Mokyr said. In speeches, Mr. Gordon 
often displays images of a flush toilet and iPhone 
and asks: Which would you give up? 
Mr. Mokyr said many economists before 
Mr. Gordon have proclaimed the end of 
progress, but these pessimists have always 
been proven wrong. It was a popular theme 
during the Depression, he said, but modern 
economists now recognize the 1930s as a 
period of rapid technological progress with 
such advances as the development of jet 
engines and radar. 
Today, Mr. Mokyr said, fast computing 
is a new tool that will open the way to new 
inventions in the future. 
The darkness of Mr. Mokyr’s family history 
contrasts with his optimism for the future. 
His parents were Dutch Jews who survived the 
Holocaust. His father, a civil servant, died of 
cancer when Mr. Mokyr was a year old. He was 
raised by his mother in a small apartment in 
the port city of Haifa in Israel. “My mother was 
not an optimist,” he said. “She had lived a very 
tough life.”
Mr. Gordon, the more famous of the two 
men, has the credentials to buck conventional

wisdom. His parents and a brother were Ph.D. 
economists. His father, an expert on business 
cycles, taught at the University of California, 
Berkeley, for decades…. 
If anything, his family should have made 
him an optimist. Mr. Gordon’s father grew 
up grindingly poor, at one point supporting 
three younger brothers after his own father 
died; his eventual success mirrored the larger 
transformation of the U.S. into the world’s 
richest country. 
“His generation saw the move from 
crowded tenements in the 1920s to suburbia 
in the 1950s—with everyone having a yard 
and a car,” Mr. Gordon said, a leap showing 
how much progress has since slowed. 
Mr. Gordon sees a hobbled U.S. economy 
ahead. Americans are getting older, leaving 
too few workers to support the aging 
population. The problem is even worse in 
other Western economies.
An aging citizenry is among a list of 
troubles, including the declining share of 
working-age men with jobs; stagnant rates 
of Americans earning college degrees; jobs 
lost abroad and high government debt. The 
biggest obstacle, he said, is growing income 
inequality.
To compensate, Mr. Gordon said, 
economies need technological advances. The 
problem is that the biggest breakthroughs—
like electrification or the discovery of 
antibiotics—are behind us. Electricity 
changed how people lived and worked, and 
it spawned hundreds of new industries. 
The technology that allowed people to 
communicate instantly or travel quickly over 
long distances were 19th- and 20th-century 
innovations. 
More recent inventions—including the 
Internet—won’t pack the same punch, he 
said: “The rapid progress made over the past 
250 years could well turn out to be a unique 
episode in human history.”
Cellphones, he said, are just a refinement 
of the telephone. “Look at what an ideal 
kitchen looked like in 1955—it’s not that 
different than today,” Mr. Gordon said. “It’s 
nothing like moving from clothes lines to 
clothes dryers.”…
Mr. Gordon said his ideas began taking 
shape between semesters at graduate school. 
He worked during the summer of 1965 for a 
team of economists analyzing the dazzling 
productivity growth that began around 1920 
and ran through World War II and the postwar 
boom.
Except for an upturn in the 1990s, growth 
has been tepid ever since. 
“Everyone has looked for a big 
overarching factor to explain this,” he said. 
“But it occurred to me, it could be as simple 
as that we’d run out of the great inventions.”
Mr. Gordon said his ideas evolved from 
there. In 2000, he published a paper saying 
that computer technology, hailed as the driver 
of the “new economy,” was far less impressive 
than earlier big inventions. He generated 
more controversy with a 2012 academic paper 
titled “Is U.S. Economic Growth Over?”
The paper included a dire prediction: 
The economy will grow less than half as fast 
as the remarkable 2% average it notched 
between 1870 and 2007. “Americans got used 
to their standard of living doubling from that 
of their parents. No more,” he told investment 
managers in Germany this year.
If he is right, the standard of living for the 
average American—measured in per capita 
income—will in the future take 78 years to 
double, compared with the 35 years it took 
between 1972 and 2007….
Much of Mr. Gordon’s work focuses on 
an economy’s output. Mr. Mokyr, meanwhile, 
is more interested in how new inventions 
improve the quality of life in ways that 
don’t show up in traditional measures: new 
medicines that treat chronic pain or allow 
older people to stay active years longer. A hip 
replacement, he said, let him keep riding his 
bike to and from work.
“For Bob, it’s all about the measure of 
input and output—especially output,” said 
Mr. Mokyr. That is why the aging population 
is such a big problem for Mr. Gordon, since 
retired people stop producing.
Mr. Gordon countered that many of the 
innovations Mr. Mokyr anticipates—such 
as new technology to clean air and water 
pollution—will solve problems created by 
past economic growth. Those shouldn’t be 
counted the same way as breakthroughs that 
add to output, he said. 
“Maybe the problem is that we didn’t 
measure growth in the past correctly,”  
Mr. Mokyr retorted, “because we didn’t 
account for the costs.”
The two men agree on one point. “One of 
the main missions I have in life is to point 
out to my students how lucky they are to be 
born in the 20th century,” Mr. Mokyr said. 
“Compared to what life was like 100 or 200 
years ago, we’re incredibly fortunate.” ■

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
the government awards the patent, which gives the inventor the exclusive right 
to make the product for a specified number of years. In essence, the patent gives 
the inventor a property right over her invention, turning her new idea from a 
public good into a private good. By allowing inventors to profit from their 
inventions—even if only temporarily—the patent system enhances the incentive 
for individuals and firms to engage in research.
25-3i Population Growth
Economists and other social scientists have long debated how population affects 
a society. The most direct effect is on the size of the labor force: A large population 
means more workers to produce goods and services. The tremendous size of the 
Chinese population is one reason China is such an important player in the world 
economy.
At the same time, however, a large population means more people to consume 
those goods and services. So while a large population means a larger total output 
of goods and services, it need not mean a higher standard of living for the typical 
citizen. Indeed, both large and small nations are found at all levels of economic 
development.
Beyond these obvious effects of population size, population growth interacts with 
the other factors of production in ways that are more subtle and open to debate.
Stretching Natural Resources  Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834), an English 
minister and early economic thinker, is famous for his book called An Essay on 
the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society. In it, he 
offered what may be history’s most chilling forecast. Malthus argued that an ever-
increasing population would continually strain society’s ability to provide for 
itself. As a result, mankind was doomed to forever live in poverty.
Malthus’s logic was simple. He began by noting that “food is necessary to the 
existence of man” and that “the passion between the sexes is necessary and will 
remain nearly in its present state.” He concluded that “the power of population 
is infinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for 
man.” According to Malthus, the only check on population growth was “misery 
and vice.” Attempts by charities or governments to alleviate poverty were 
counterproductive, he argued, because they merely allowed the poor to have 
more children, placing even greater strains on society’s productive capabilities. 
Malthus may have correctly described the world at the time when he lived, 
but fortunately, his dire forecast was far off the mark. The world population has 
increased about sixfold over the past two centuries, but living standards around 
the world are on average much higher. As a result of economic growth, chronic 
hunger and malnutrition are less common now than they were in Malthus’s day. 
Modern famines occur from time to time but are more often the result of an unequal 
income distribution or political instability than inadequate food production.
Where did Malthus go wrong? As we discussed in a case study earlier in this 
chapter, growth in human ingenuity has offset the effects of a larger population. 
Pesticides, fertilizers, mechanized farm equipment, new crop varieties, and other 
technological advances that Malthus never imagined have allowed each farmer 
to feed ever greater numbers of people. Even with more mouths to feed, fewer 
farmers are necessary because each farmer is much more productive.
Diluting the Capital Stock  Whereas Malthus worried about the effects of 
population on the use of natural resources, some modern theories of economic

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
growth emphasize its effects on capital accumulation. According to these theories, 
high population growth reduces GDP per worker because rapid growth in the 
number of workers forces the capital stock to be spread more thinly. In other 
words, when population growth is rapid, each worker is equipped with less 
capital. A smaller quantity of capital per worker leads to lower productivity and 
lower GDP per worker. 
This problem is most apparent in the case of human capital. Countries with 
high population growth have large numbers of school-age children. This places 
a larger burden on the educational system. It is not surprising, therefore, that 
educational attainment tends to be low in countries with high population growth.
The differences in population growth around the world are large. In developed 
countries, such as the United States and those in Western Europe, the population 
has risen only about 1 percent per year in recent decades and is expected to rise 
even more slowly in the future. By contrast, in many poor African countries, 
population grows at about 3 percent per year. At this rate, the population doubles 
every 23 years. This rapid population growth makes it harder to provide workers 
with the tools and skills they need to achieve high levels of productivity.
Rapid population growth is not the main reason that less developed countries 
are poor, but some analysts believe that reducing the rate of population growth 
would help these countries raise their standards of living. In some countries, 
this goal is accomplished directly with laws that regulate the number of children 
families may have. For example, from 1980 to 2015, China allowed only one 
child per family; couples who violated this rule were subject to substantial fines. 
In countries with greater freedom, the goal of reduced population growth is 
accomplished less directly by increasing awareness of birth control techniques. 
Another way in which a country can influence population growth is to apply 
one of the Ten Principles of Economics: People respond to incentives. Bearing 
a child, like any decision, has an opportunity cost. When the opportunity cost 
rises, people will choose to have smaller families. In particular, women with the 
opportunity to receive a good education and desirable employment tend to want 
fewer children than those with fewer opportunities outside the home. Hence, 
policies that foster equal treatment of women may be one way for less developed 
economies to reduce the rate of population growth and, perhaps, raise their 
standards of living.
Promoting Technological Progress  Rapid population growth may depress 
economic prosperity by reducing the amount of capital each worker has, but 
it may also have some benefits. Some economists have suggested that world 
population growth has been an engine of technological progress and economic 
prosperity. The mechanism is simple: If there are more people, then there are more 
scientists, inventors, and engineers to contribute to technological advance, which 
benefits everyone.
Economist Michael Kremer provided some support for this hypothesis in an 
article titled “Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million b.c. to 
1990,” which was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1993. Kremer 
began by noting that over the broad span of human history, world growth rates 
have increased with world population. For example, world growth was more 
rapid when the world population was 1 billion (which occurred around the 
year 1800) than when the population was only 100 million (around 500 b.c.). 
This fact is consistent with the hypothesis that a larger population induces more 
technological progress.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
Kremer’s second piece of evidence comes from comparing regions of the 
world. The melting of the polar icecaps at the end of the Ice Age around 10,000 b.c. 
flooded the land bridges and separated the world into several distinct regions that 
could not communicate with one another for thousands of years. If technological 
progress is more rapid when there are more people to discover things, then larger 
regions should have experienced more rapid growth.
According to Kremer, that is exactly what happened. The most successful 
region of the world in 1500 (when Columbus reestablished contact) comprised the 
“Old World” civilizations of the large Eurasia-Africa region. Next in technological 
development were the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, followed 
by the hunter-gatherers of Australia, and then the primitive people of Tasmania, 
who lacked even fire-making and most stone and bone tools. 
To figure out what policies work in 
developing nations, economists are 
increasingly turning to randomized 
controlled experiments.
What It Takes to Lift Families 
Out of Poverty
By Michaeleen Doucleff
E
ighteen years ago, Dean Karlan was a fresh, 
bright-eyed graduate student in economics 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He wanted to answer what seemed like a sim-
ple question:
“Does global aid work?” Karlan says.
He was reading a bunch of studies on the 
topic. But none of them actually answered the 
question. “We were tearing our hair out reading 
these papers because it was frustrating,” he 
says. “[We] never really felt like the papers 
were really satisfactory.”
One problem was that no one was actually 
testing global aid programs—methodically—
to see if they really changed people’s lives 
permanently. “They haven’t been taking the 
scientific method to problems of poverty,” he 
says.
Take, for instance, a charity that gives a 
family a cow. The charity might check on the 
family a year later and say, “Wow! The family is 
doing so much better with this cow. Cows must 
be the reason.”
But maybe it wasn’t the cow that improved 
the family’s life. Maybe it had a bumper crop 
that year or property values went up in the 
neighborhood. Researchers really weren’t doing 
those experiments, Karlan says.
So he and a bunch of his colleagues had 
a radical idea: Test aid with the same method 
doctors use to test drugs (that is, randomized 
control trials).
The idea is quite simple. Give some 
families aid but others nothing. Then follow 
both groups, and see if the aid actually made a 
difference in the long run.
Karlan, who’s now a professor at Yale 
University, says many people were skeptical.  
“I have many conversations with people who 
say, ‘You want to do what? Why would you want 
to do that?’ ”
One issue is that some families go home 
empty-handed, with no aid. So the idea seems 
unethical. But Karlan disagrees. “The whole 
point of this is to help more people,” he says. 
“If we find out what works and what doesn’t, 
in five years we can have a much bigger 
impact.”
So Karlan and collaborators around the world, 
including those at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty 
Action Lab at MIT and the nonprofit Innovations 
for Poverty Action, decided to try out the idea with 
one of the toughest problems out there: helping 
families get out of extreme poverty.
An anti-poverty program in Bangladesh, 
called BRAC, looked like it was successful. 
It seemed to help nearly 400,000 families 
who were living off less than $1.25 each day. 
So Karlan and his colleagues wanted to test 
the program and see if it could work in other 
countries.

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
The smallest isolated region was Flinders Island, a tiny island between 
Tasmania and Australia. With the smallest population, Flinders Island had the 
fewest opportunities for technological advance and, indeed, seemed to regress. 
Around 3000 b.c., human society on Flinders Island died out completely. 
A large population, Kremer concluded, is a prerequisite for technological 
advance.
QuickQuiz
Describe three ways a government policymaker can try to raise the growth 
in living standards in a society. Are there any drawbacks to these policies?
They teamed up with a network of 
researchers and nonprofits in six developing 
countries. They went to thousands of 
communities and found the poorest families.
Then they divided the families into two 
groups. They gave half the families nothing. 
And the other half a whole smorgasbord of aid 
for one to two years. They gave them:
1.  Some livestock for making money, 
such as goats for milk, bees for honey, 
or guinea pigs for selling. “Depending 
on the site, there were different things 
specifically appropriate for that con-
text,” Karlan says.
2.  Training about how to raise the 
livestock
3.  Food or cash so they wouldn’t eat the 
livestock
4. A savings account
5.  Help with their health—both physical 
and mental
Karlan and his colleagues reported the 
results of the massive experiment in the 
journal Science this week.
So what did they find? Well, the strategy 
worked pretty well in five of the six countries 
they tried it in. Families who got the aid 
started making a little more money, and they 
had more food to eat.
“We see mental health go up. Happiness 
go up. We even saw things like female power 
increase,” Karlan says.
But here’s what sets this study apart from 
the rest: Families continued to make a bit 
more money even a year after the aid stopped.
“People were stuck. They give them 
this big push, and they seem to be on a 
sustained increased income level,” says 
Justin Sandefur, an economist at the Center 
for Global Development in Washington, who 
wasn’t involved in the study.
“What I found exciting and unique about 
this study is that the impact of the aid was 
durable and sustainable,” he added.
The results suggest that the right kind of 
aid does help people in multiple places. It lifted 
the families up just a little bit so they could 
finally start inching out of extreme poverty.
But we shouldn’t get too excited yet. These 
people are still very poor, says Sarah Baird, an 
economist at George Washington University.
The effect of the aid was actually quite 
small, she says. Families’ incomes and food 
consumption together went up by only a small 
amount — about 5 percent, on average, 
when compared with the control group.
And it’s still unknown how long this 
bump will last. The researchers looked at the 
change only a year after the aid stopped.
“Moving poverty is hard,” Baird says. 
“The fact that they [Karlan and colleagues] 
were able to move it, and it was sustainable 
after a year, I think is important.”
The findings are a leap forward, she says, 
because it shows charities and governments 
a basic strategy that often works.
And even a little bit of extra money can 
make a huge difference in these peoples’ 
lives, she says. It can help them send their 
kids to school. Or even just give them a little 
more hope. ■

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
In this chapter, we have discussed what determines the standard of living in a 
nation and how policymakers can endeavor to raise it through policies that 
promote economic growth. Most of this chapter is summarized in one of the 
Ten Principles of Economics: A country’s standard of living depends on its ability 
to produce goods and services. Policymakers who want to encourage growth 
in living standards must aim to increase their nation’s productive ability by 
encouraging rapid accumulation of the factors of production and ensuring that 
these factors are employed as effectively as possible.
Economists differ in their views on the role of government in promoting 
economic growth. At the very least, government can lend support to the invisible 
hand by maintaining property rights and political stability. More controversial is 
whether government should target and subsidize specific industries that might be 
especially important for technological progress. There is no doubt that these issues 
are among the most important in economics. The success of one generation’s 
policymakers in learning and heeding the fundamental lessons about economic 
growth determines what kind of world the next generation will inherit.

CHAPTER 25   PRODUCTION AND GROWTH
• Economic prosperity, as measured by GDP per person, 
varies substantially around the world. The average 
income in the world’s richest countries is more than 
ten times that in the world’s poorest countries. Because 
growth rates of real GDP also vary substantially, the 
relative positions of countries can change dramatically 
over time. 
• The standard of living in an economy depends on 
the economy’s ability to produce goods and services. 
Productivity, in turn, depends on the physical capital, 
human capital, natural resources, and technological 
knowledge available to workers.
• Government policies can try to influence the 
economy’s growth rate in many ways: by encouraging 
saving and investment, encouraging investment from 
abroad, fostering education, promoting good health, 
maintaining property rights and political stability, 
allowing free trade, and promoting the research and 
development of new technologies.
• The accumulation of capital is subject to diminishing 
returns: The more capital an economy has, the less 
additional output the economy gets from an extra unit 
of capital. As a result, although higher saving leads to 
higher growth for a period of time, growth eventually 
slows down as capital, productivity, and income rise. 
Also because of diminishing returns, the return to 
capital is especially high in poor countries. Other 
things being equal, these countries can grow faster 
because of the catch-up effect. 
• Population growth has a variety of effects on economic 
growth. On the one hand, more rapid population 
growth may lower productivity by stretching the 
supply of natural resources and by reducing the 
amount of capital available for each worker. On the 
other hand, a larger population may enhance the 
rate of technological progress because there are more 
scientists and engineers.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
1. Most countries, including the United States, import 
substantial amounts of goods and services from other 
countries. Yet the chapter says that a nation can enjoy 
a high standard of living only if it can produce a 
large quantity of goods and services itself. Can you 
reconcile these two facts?
2. Suppose that society decided to reduce consumption 
and increase investment.
a. How would this change affect economic growth?
b. What groups in society would benefit from this 
change? What groups might be hurt?
3. Societies choose what share of their resources to 
devote to consumption and what share to devote to 
investment. Some of these decisions involve private 
spending; others involve government spending.
a. Describe some forms of private spending that 
represent consumption and some forms that 
represent investment. The national income 
accounts include tuition as a part of consumer 
spending. In your opinion, are the resources you 
devote to your education a form of consumption 
or a form of investment? 
b. Describe some forms of government spending 
that represent consumption and some forms that 
represent investment. In your opinion, should we 
view government spending on health programs 
as a form of consumption or investment? Would 
you distinguish between health programs for the 
young and health programs for the elderly?
4. What is the opportunity cost of investing in capital? 
Do you think a country can overinvest in capital? 
What is the opportunity cost of investing in human 
capital? Do you think a country can overinvest in 
human capital? Explain.
5. In the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s, investors 
from the Asian economies of Japan and China made 
significant direct and portfolio investments in the 
United States. At the time, many Americans were 
unhappy that this investment was occurring.
a. In what way was it better for the United States  
to receive this foreign investment than not to 
receive it?
b. In what way would it have been better still for 
Americans to have made this investment?
6. In many developing nations, young women have 
lower enrollment rates in secondary school than do 
young men. Describe several ways in which greater 
educational opportunities for young women could 
lead to faster economic growth in these countries.
7. The International Property Right Index scores 
countries based on the legal and political environment 
and how well property rights are protected. Go online 
and find a recent ranking. Choose three countries with 
high scores and three countries with low scores. Then 
find estimates of GDP per person in each of these 
six countries. What pattern do you find? Give two 
possible interpretations of the pattern.
8. International data show a positive correlation between 
income per person and the health of the population.
a. Explain how higher income might cause better 
health outcomes.
b. Explain how better health outcomes might cause 
higher income.
c. How might the relative importance of your two 
hypotheses be relevant for public policy?
9. The great 18th-century economist Adam Smith wrote, 
“Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest 
degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but 
peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of 
justice: all the rest being brought about by the natu-
ral course of things.” Explain how each of the three 
conditions Smith describes would promote economic 
growth.

magine that you have just graduated from college (with a degree in economics, 
of course) and you decide to start your own business—an economic forecasting 
firm. Before you make any money selling your forecasts, you have to incur 
substantial costs to set up your business. You have to buy computers with which 
to make your forecasts, as well as desks, chairs, and filing cabinets to furnish 
your new office. Each of these items is a type of capital that your firm will use to 
produce and sell its services. 
How do you obtain the funds to invest in these capital goods? Perhaps you 
are able to pay for them out of your past savings. More likely, however, like 
most entrepreneurs, you do not have enough money of your own

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
to finance the start of your business. As a result, you have to get the money you 
need from other sources. 
There are various ways to finance these capital investments. You could borrow 
the money, perhaps from a bank or from a friend or relative. In this case, you 
would promise not only to return the money to the lender at a later date but also 
to pay the lender interest for the use of the money. Alternatively, you could con-
vince someone to provide the money you need for your business in exchange for 
a share of your future profits, whatever they might happen to be. In either case, 
your investment in computers and office equipment is being financed by some-
one else’s saving.
The financial system consists of the institutions that help to match one per-
son’s saving with another person’s investment. As we discussed in the previous 
chapter, saving and investment are key ingredients to long-run economic growth: 
When a country saves a large portion of its GDP, more resources are available for 
investment in capital, and higher capital raises a country’s productivity and liv-
ing standard. The previous chapter, however, did not explain how the economy 
coordinates saving and investment. At any time, some people want to save some 
of their income for the future and others want to borrow to finance investments in 
new and growing businesses. What brings these two groups of people together? 
What ensures that the supply of funds from those who want to save balances the 
demand for funds from those who want to invest? 
This chapter examines how the financial system works. First, we discuss the 
large variety of institutions that make up the financial system in our economy. 
Second, we examine the relationship between the financial system and some key 
macroeconomic variables—notably saving and investment. Third, we develop a 
model of the supply and demand for funds in financial markets. In the model, the 
interest rate is the price that adjusts to balance supply and demand. The model 
shows how various government policies affect the interest rate and, thereby, soci-
ety’s allocation of scarce resources.

26-1 Financial Institutions in the U.S. Economy
At the broadest level, the financial system moves the economy’s scarce resources 
from savers (people who spend less than they earn) to borrowers (people who 
spend more than they earn). Savers save for various reasons—to put a child 
through college in several years or to retire comfortably in several decades. 
Similarly, borrowers borrow for various reasons—to buy a house in which to live 
or to start a business with which to make a living. Savers supply their money to 
the financial system with the expectation that they will get it back with interest 
at a later date. Borrowers demand money from the financial system with the 
knowledge that they will be required to pay it back with interest at a later date. 
The financial system is made up of various financial institutions that help 
coordinate the actions of savers and borrowers. As a prelude to analyzing the 
economic forces that drive the financial system, let’s discuss the most important 
of these institutions. Financial institutions can be grouped into two categories: 
financial markets and financial intermediaries. We consider each category in turn.
26-1a Financial Markets
Financial markets are the institutions through which a person who wants to save 
can directly supply funds to a person who wants to borrow. The two most important 
financial markets in our economy are the bond market and the stock market.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
The Bond Market  When Intel, the giant maker of computer chips, wants to borrow 
to finance construction of a new factory, it can borrow directly from the public. It 
does this by selling bonds. A bond is a certificate of indebtedness that specifies the 
obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond. Put simply, a bond is an IOU. 
It identifies the time at which the loan will be repaid, called the date of maturity, and 
the rate of interest that will be paid periodically until the loan matures. The buyer of 
a bond gives his money to Intel in exchange for this promise of interest and eventual 
repayment of the amount borrowed (called the principal). The buyer can hold the 
bond until maturity, or he can sell the bond at an earlier date to someone else.
There are millions of different bonds in the U.S. economy. When large 
corporations, the federal government, or state and local governments need to 
borrow to finance the purchase of a new factory, a new jet fighter, or a new school, 
they usually do so by issuing bonds. If you look at The Wall Street Journal or the 
business section of your local newspaper, you will find a listing of the prices and 
interest rates on some of the most important bond issues. These bonds differ 
according to three significant characteristics. 
The first characteristic is a bond’s term—the length of time until the bond 
matures. Some bonds have short terms, such as a few months, while others have 
terms as long as 30 years. (The British government has even issued a bond that 
never matures, called a perpetuity. This bond pays interest forever, but the principal 
is never repaid.) The interest rate on a bond depends, in part, on its term. Long-term 
bonds are riskier than short-term bonds because holders of long-term bonds have 
to wait longer for repayment of principal. If a holder of a long-term bond needs his 
money earlier than the distant date of maturity, he has no choice but to sell the bond 
to someone else, perhaps at a reduced price. To compensate for this risk, long-term 
bonds usually pay higher interest rates than short-term bonds.
The second important characteristic of a bond is its credit risk—the probability 
that the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal. Such a failure to 
pay is called a default. Borrowers can (and sometimes do) default on their loans by 
declaring bankruptcy. When bond buyers perceive that the probability of default 
is high, they demand a higher interest rate as compensation for this risk. Because 
the U.S. government is considered a safe credit risk, government bonds tend to 
pay low interest rates. By contrast, financially shaky corporations raise money by 
issuing junk bonds, which pay very high interest rates. Buyers of bonds can judge 
credit risk by checking with various private agencies that evaluate the credit risk 
of different bonds. For example, Standard & Poor’s rates bonds from AAA (the 
safest) to D (those already in default).
The third important characteristic of a bond is its tax treatment—the way the tax 
laws treat the interest earned on the bond. The interest on most bonds is taxable 
income; that is, the bond owner has to pay a portion of the interest he earns in 
income taxes. By contrast, when state and local governments issue bonds, called 
municipal bonds, the bond owners are not required to pay federal income tax on 
the interest income. Because of this tax advantage, bonds issued by state and local 
governments typically pay a lower interest rate than bonds issued by corporations 
or the federal government.
The Stock Market  Another way for Intel to raise funds to build a new 
semiconductor factory is to sell stock in the company. Stock represents ownership 
in a firm and is, therefore, a claim to the profits that the firm makes. For example, if 
Intel sells a total of 1,000,000 shares of stock, then each share represents ownership 
of 1/1,000,000 of the business.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
The sale of stock to raise money is called equity finance, whereas the sale of bonds 
is called debt finance. Although corporations use both equity and debt finance to 
raise money for new investments, stocks and bonds are very different. The owner 
of shares of Intel stock is a part owner of Intel, while the owner of an Intel bond 
is a creditor of the corporation. If Intel is very profitable, the stockholders enjoy 
the benefits of these profits, whereas the bondholders get only the interest on their 
bonds. And if Intel runs into financial difficulty, the bondholders are paid what 
they are due before stockholders receive anything at all. Compared to bonds, 
stocks offer the holder both higher risk and potentially higher return.
After a corporation issues stock by selling shares to the public, these shares 
trade among stockholders on organized stock exchanges. In these transactions, 
the corporation itself receives no money when its stock changes hands. The most 
important stock exchanges in the U.S. economy are the New York Stock Exchange 
and the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated 
Quotations). Most of the world’s countries have their own stock exchanges on 
which the shares of local companies trade. 
The prices at which shares trade on stock exchanges are determined by the 
supply of and demand for the stock in these companies. Because stock represents 
ownership in a corporation, the demand for a stock (and thus its price) reflects 
people’s perception of the corporation’s future profitability. When people 
become optimistic about a company’s future, they raise their demand for its 
stock and thereby bid up the price of a share of stock. Conversely, when people’s 
expectations of a company’s prospects decline, the price of a share falls.
Various stock indexes are available to monitor the overall level of stock 
prices. A stock index is computed as an average of a group of stock prices. The 
most famous stock index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has been 
computed regularly since 1896. It is now based on the prices of the stocks of thirty 
major U.S. companies, such as General Electric, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Boeing, 
Apple, and Wal-Mart. Another well-known stock index is the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index, which is based on the prices of the stocks of 500 major companies. 
Because stock prices reflect expected profitability, these stock indexes are watched 
closely as possible indicators of future economic conditions. 
26-1b Financial Intermediaries
Financial intermediaries are financial institutions through which savers can 
indirectly provide funds to borrowers. The term intermediary reflects the role of 
these institutions in standing between savers and borrowers. Here we consider 
two of the most important financial intermediaries: banks and mutual funds.
Banks  If the owner of a small grocery store wants to finance an expansion of his 
business, he probably takes a strategy quite different from that of Intel. Unlike 
Intel, a small grocer would find it difficult to raise funds in the bond and stock 
markets. Most buyers of stocks and bonds prefer to buy those issued by larger, 
more familiar companies. The small grocer, therefore, most likely finances his 
business expansion with a loan from a local bank.
Banks are the financial intermediaries with which people are most familiar. 
A primary job of banks is to take in deposits from people who want to save 
and use these deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow. Banks pay 
depositors interest on their deposits and charge borrowers slightly higher interest 
on their loans. The difference between these rates of interest covers the banks’ 
costs and returns some profit to the owners of the banks.

545
CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Besides being financial intermediaries, banks play another important role in the 
economy: They facilitate purchases of goods and services by allowing people to 
write checks against their deposits and to access those deposits with debit cards. 
In other words, banks help create a special asset that people can use as a medium 
of exchange. A medium of exchange is an item that people can easily use to engage 
in transactions. A bank’s role in providing a medium of exchange distinguishes it 
from many other financial institutions. Stocks and bonds, like bank deposits, are a 
possible store of value for the wealth that people have accumulated in past saving, 
but access to this wealth is not as easy, cheap, and immediate as just writing a 
check or swiping a debit card. For now, we ignore this second role of banks, but 
we will return to it when we discuss the monetary system later in the book.
Mutual Funds  A financial intermediary of increasing importance in the U.S. 
economy is the mutual fund. A mutual fund is an institution that sells shares to the 
public and uses the proceeds to buy a selection, or portfolio, of various types of stocks, 
bonds, or both stocks and bonds. The shareholder of the mutual fund accepts all the 
risk and return associated with the portfolio. If the value of the portfolio rises, the 
shareholder benefits; if the value of the portfolio falls, the shareholder suffers the loss. 
The primary advantage of mutual funds is that they allow people with small 
amounts of money to diversify their holdings. Buyers of stocks and bonds are 
well advised to heed the adage: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Because the

Key Numbers for Stock Watchers
W
hen following the stock of any company, you should keep an eye 
on three key numbers. These numbers are reported on the financial 
pages of some newspapers, and you can easily obtain them online as 
well (such as at Yahoo! Finance):
•  Price. The single most important piece of information about a stock 
is the price of a share. News services usually present several prices. 
The “last” price is the price at which the stock more recently traded. 
The “previous close” is the price of the last transaction that occurred 
before the stock exchange closed on its previous day of trading. A 
news service may also give the “high” and “low” prices over the past 
day of trading and, sometimes, over the past year as well. It may also 
report the change from the previous day’s closing price.
• Dividend. Corporations pay out some of their profits to their stock-
holders; this amount is called the dividend. (Profits not paid out 
are called retained earnings and are used by the corporation for 
additional investment.) News services often report the dividend 
paid over the previous year for each share of stock. They some-
times report the dividend yield, which is the dividend expressed as 
a percentage of the stock’s price. 
•  Price-earnings ratio. A corporation’s earnings, or account-
ing profit, is the amount of revenue it receives for the sale 
of its products minus its costs of production as measured by 
its accountants. 
 Earnings per share is 
the company’s total 
earnings divided by 
the number of shares 
of stock outstanding. 
The price-earnings ratio, 
often called the P/E, is the price of a corporation’s stock divided 
by the amount the corporation earned per share over the past 
year. Historically, the typical price-earnings ratio is about 15. 
A higher P/E indicates that a corporation’s stock is expensive 
relative to its recent earnings; this might indicate either that 
people expect earnings to rise in the future or that the stock is 
overvalued.  Conversely, a lower P/E indicates that a corporation’s 
stock is cheap relative to its recent earnings; this might indicate 
either that people expect earnings to fall or that the stock is 
undervalued.
Why do news services report all these data? Many people who invest 
their savings in stock follow these numbers closely when deciding which 
stocks to buy and sell. By contrast, other stockholders follow a buy-and-
hold strategy: They buy the stock of well-run companies, hold it for long 
periods of time, and do not respond to the daily fluctuations. ■

546
PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
value of any single stock or bond is tied to the fortunes of one company, holding a 
single kind of stock or bond is very risky. By contrast, people who hold a diverse 
portfolio of stocks and bonds face less risk because they have only a small stake 
in each company. Mutual funds make this diversification easy. With only a few 
hundred dollars, a person can buy shares in a mutual fund and, indirectly, become 
the part owner or creditor of hundreds of major companies. For this service, the 
company operating the mutual fund charges shareholders a fee, usually between 
0.25 and 2.0 percent of assets each year.
A second advantage claimed by mutual fund companies is that mutual funds 
give ordinary people access to the skills of professional money managers. The 
managers of most mutual funds pay close attention to the developments and 
prospects of the companies in which they buy stock. These managers buy the 
stock of companies they view as having a profitable future and sell the stock 
of companies with less promising prospects. This professional management, it 
is argued, should increase the return that mutual fund depositors earn on their 
savings.
Financial economists, however, are often skeptical of this argument. With 
thousands of money managers paying close attention to each company’s 
prospects, the price of a company’s stock is usually a good reflection of the 
company’s true value. As a result, it is hard to “beat the market” by buying 
good stocks and selling bad ones. In fact, mutual funds called index funds, which 
buy all the stocks in a given stock index, perform somewhat better on average 
than mutual funds that take advantage of active trading by professional money 
managers. The explanation for the superior performance of index funds is that 
they keep costs low by buying and selling very rarely and by not having to pay 
the salaries of professional money managers.
26-1c Summing Up
The U.S. economy contains a large variety of financial institutions. In addition 
to the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds, there are also 
pension funds, credit unions, insurance companies, and even the local loan shark. 
These institutions differ in many ways. When analyzing the macroeconomic role 
of the financial system, however, it is more important to keep in mind that, despite 
their differences, these financial institutions all serve the same goal: directing the 
resources of savers into the hands of borrowers.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
26-2  Saving and Investment in the National 
Income Accounts
Events that occur within the financial system are central to understanding 
developments in the overall economy. As we have just seen, the institutions that 
make up this system—the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual 
funds—have the role of coordinating the economy’s saving and investment. 
And as we saw in the previous chapter, saving and investment are important 
determinants of long-run growth in GDP and living standards. As a result, 
macroeconomists need to understand how financial markets work and how 
various events and policies affect them.
As a starting point for analyzing financial markets, we discuss the key 
macroeconomic variables that measure activity in these markets. Our emphasis 
here is not on behavior but on accounting. Accounting refers to how various 
numbers are defined and added up. A personal accountant might help an 
individual add up his income and expenses. A national income accountant does 
the same thing for the economy as a whole. The national income accounts include, 
in particular, GDP and the many related statistics.
The rules of national income accounting include several important identities. 
Recall that an identity is an equation that must be true because of the way the 
variables in the equation are defined. Identities are useful to keep in mind, for they 
clarify how different variables are related to one another. Here we consider some 
accounting identities that shed light on the macroeconomic role of financial markets.
26-2a Some Important Identities
Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is both total income in an economy 
and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDP 
(denoted as Y) is divided into four components of expenditure: consumption (C), 
investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). We write
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
This equation is an identity because every dollar of expenditure that shows up 
on the left side also shows up in one of the four components on the right side. 
Because of the way each of the variables is defined and measured, this equation 
must always hold.
In this chapter, we simplify our analysis by assuming that the economy we 
are examining is closed. A closed economy is one that does not interact with other 
economies. In particular, a closed economy does not engage in international 
trade in goods and services, nor does it engage in international borrowing and 
lending. Actual economies are open economies—that is, they interact with other 
economies around the world. Nonetheless, assuming a closed economy is 
a useful simplification with which we can learn some lessons that apply to all 
economies. Moreover, this assumption applies perfectly to the world economy 
(for interplanetary trade is not yet common).
Because a closed economy does not engage in international trade, imports and 
exports are exactly zero. Therefore, net exports (NX) are also zero. We can now 
simplify the identity as
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G.

548
PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
This equation states that GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, and 
government purchases. Each unit of output sold in a closed economy is consumed, 
invested, or bought by the government.
To see what this identity can tell us about financial markets, subtract C and G 
from both sides of this equation. We then obtain
Y 2 C 2 G 5 I.
The left side of this equation (Y 2 C 2 G) is the total income in the economy that 
remains after paying for consumption and government purchases: This amount is 
called national saving, or just saving, and is denoted S. Substituting S for Y − C − G, 
we can write the last equation as 
S 5 I.
This equation states that saving equals investment.
To understand the meaning of national saving, it is helpful to manipulate the 
definition a bit more. Let T denote the amount that the government collects from 
households in taxes minus the amount it pays back to households in the form 
of transfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare). We can then write 
national saving in either of two ways:
S 5 Y 2 C 2 G
or
S 5 (Y 2 T 2 C) 1 (T 2 G).
These equations are the same because the two T’s in the second equation cancel 
each other, but each reveals a different way of thinking about national saving. In 
particular, the second equation separates national saving into two pieces: private 
saving (Y 2 T 2 C) and public saving (T 2 G). 
Consider each of these two pieces. Private saving is the amount of income that 
households have left after paying their taxes and paying for their consumption. In 
particular, because households receive income of Y, pay taxes of T, and spend C 
on consumption, private saving is Y 2 T 2 C. Public saving is the amount of tax 
revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending. The government 
receives T in tax revenue and spends G on goods and services. If T exceeds G, the 
government runs a budget surplus because it receives more money than it spends. 
This surplus of T 2 G represents public saving. If the government spends more than 
it receives in tax revenue, then G is larger than T. In this case, the government runs a 
budget deficit, and public saving (T 2 G) is a negative number.
Now consider how these accounting identities are related to financial markets. 
The equation S = I reveals an important fact: For the economy as a whole, saving 
must be equal to investment. Yet this fact raises some important questions: What 
mechanisms lie behind this identity? What coordinates those people who are 
deciding how much to save and those people who are deciding how much to 
invest? The answer is the financial system. The bond market, the stock market, 
banks, mutual funds, and other financial markets and intermediaries stand 
between the two sides of the S = I equation. They take in the nation’s saving and 
direct it to the nation’s investment.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
26-2b The Meaning of Saving and Investment
The terms saving and investment can sometimes be confusing. Most people 
use these terms casually and sometimes interchangeably. By contrast, the 
macroeconomists who put together the national income accounts use these terms 
carefully and distinctly.
Consider an example. Suppose that Larry earns more than he spends and 
deposits his unspent income in a bank or uses it to buy some stock or a bond 
from a corporation. Because Larry’s income exceeds his consumption, he adds to 
the nation’s saving. Larry might think of himself as “investing” his money, but a 
macroeconomist would call Larry’s act saving rather than investment.
In the language of macroeconomics, investment refers to the purchase of new 
capital, such as equipment or buildings. When Moe borrows from the bank to 
build himself a new house, he adds to the nation’s investment. (Remember, the 
purchase of a new house is the one form of household spending that is investment 
rather than consumption.) Similarly, when the Curly Corporation sells some 
stock and uses the proceeds to build a new factory, it also adds to the nation’s 
investment.
Although the accounting identity S = I shows that saving and investment are 
equal for the economy as a whole, this does not have to be true for every individual 
household or firm. Larry’s saving can be greater than his investment, and he can 
deposit the excess in a bank. Moe’s saving can be less than his investment, and he 
can borrow the shortfall from a bank. Banks and other financial institutions make 
these individual differences between saving and investment possible by allowing 
one person’s saving to finance another person’s investment.

26-3 The Market for Loanable Funds
Having discussed some of the important financial institutions in our economy 
and the macroeconomic role of these institutions, we are ready to build a model of 
financial markets. Our purpose in building this model is to explain how financial 
markets coordinate the economy’s saving and investment. The model also gives 
us a tool with which we can analyze various government policies that influence 
saving and investment.
To keep things simple, we assume that the economy has only one financial 
market, called the market for loanable funds. All savers go to this market to 
deposit their saving, and all borrowers go to this market to take out their loans. 
Thus, the term loanable funds refers to all income that people have chosen to save 
and lend out, rather than use for their own consumption, and to the amount that 
investors have chosen to borrow to fund new investment projects. In the market 
for loanable funds, there is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving 
and the cost of borrowing.
The assumption of a single financial market, of course, is not realistic. As 
we have seen, the economy has many types of financial institutions. But as we 
discussed in Chapter 2, the art in building an economic model is simplifying the 
world in order to explain it. For our purposes here, we can ignore the diversity of 
financial institutions and assume that the economy has a single financial market.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
26-3a Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds
The economy’s market for loanable funds, like other markets in the economy, is 
governed by supply and demand. To understand how the market for loanable 
funds operates, therefore, we first look at the sources of supply and demand in 
that market.
The supply of loanable funds comes from people who have some extra income 
they want to save and lend out. This lending can occur directly, such as when 
a household buys a bond from a firm, or it can occur indirectly, such as when a 
household makes a deposit in a bank, which then uses the funds to make loans. In 
both cases, saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds.
The demand for loanable funds comes from households and firms who wish to 
borrow to make investments. This demand includes families taking out mortgages 
to buy new homes. It also includes firms borrowing to buy new equipment or 
build factories. In both cases, investment is the source of the demand for loanable funds.
The interest rate is the price of a loan. It represents the amount that borrowers 
pay for loans and the amount that lenders receive on their saving. Because a high 
interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, the quantity of loanable funds 
demanded falls as the interest rate rises. Similarly, because a high interest rate 
makes saving more attractive, the quantity of loanable funds supplied rises as the 
interest rate rises. In other words, the demand curve for loanable funds slopes 
downward, and the supply curve for loanable funds slopes upward.
Figure 1 shows the interest rate that balances the supply and demand for 
loanable funds. In the equilibrium shown, the interest rate is 5 percent, and the 
quantity of loanable funds demanded and the quantity of loanable funds supplied 
both equal $1,200 billion. 
The adjustment of the interest rate to the equilibrium level occurs for the usual 
reasons. If the interest rate were lower than the equilibrium level, the quantity 
of loanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity of loanable funds 
demanded. The resulting shortage of loanable funds would encourage lenders to 
FIGURE 1
The Market for Loanable Funds
The interest rate in the economy adjusts 
to balance the supply and demand for 
loanable funds. The supply of loanable 
funds comes from national saving, 
including both private saving and public 
saving. The demand for loanable funds 
comes from firms and households 
that want to borrow for purposes of 
investment. Here the equilibrium interest 
rate is 5 percent, and $1,200 billion 
of loanable funds are supplied and 
demanded.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
raise the interest rate they charge. A higher interest rate would encourage saving 
(thereby increasing the quantity of loanable funds supplied) and discourage 
borrowing for investment (thereby decreasing the quantity of loanable funds 
demanded). Conversely, if the interest rate were higher than the equilibrium level, 
the quantity of loanable funds supplied would exceed the quantity of loanable 
funds demanded. As lenders compete for the scarce borrowers, interest rates 
would be driven down. In this way, the interest rate approaches the equilibrium 
level at which the supply and demand for loanable funds exactly balance. 
Recall that economists distinguish between the real interest rate and the 
nominal interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the monetary return to saving 
and the monetary cost of borrowing. It is the interest rate as usually reported. The 
real interest rate is the nominal interest rate corrected for inflation; it equals the 
nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Because inflation erodes the value 
of money over time, the real interest rate more accurately reflects the real return 
to saving and the real cost of borrowing. Therefore, the supply and demand for 
loanable funds depend on the real (rather than nominal) interest rate, and the 
equilibrium in Figure 1 should be interpreted as determining the real interest rate 
in the economy. For the rest of this chapter, when you see the term interest rate, 
you should remember that we are talking about the real interest rate.
This model of the supply and demand for loanable funds shows that financial 
markets work much like other markets in the economy. In the market for milk, for 
instance, the price of milk adjusts so that the quantity of milk supplied balances 
the quantity of milk demanded. In this way, the invisible hand coordinates the 
behavior of dairy farmers and the behavior of milk drinkers. Once we realize that 
saving represents the supply of loanable funds and investment represents the 
demand, we can see how the invisible hand coordinates saving and investment. 
When the interest rate adjusts to balance supply and demand in the market for 
loanable funds, it coordinates the behavior of people who want to save (the 
suppliers of loanable funds) and the behavior of people who want to invest (the 
demanders of loanable funds).
We can now use this analysis of the market for loanable funds to examine 
various government policies that affect the economy’s saving and investment. 
Because this model is just supply and demand in a particular market, we analyze 
any policy using the three steps discussed in Chapter 4. First, we decide whether 
the policy shifts the supply curve or the demand curve. Second, we determine the 
direction of the shift. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how 
the equilibrium changes.
26-3b Policy 1: Saving Incentives
Many economists and policymakers have advocated increases in how much 
people save. Their argument is simple. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in 
Chapter 1 is that a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce 
goods and services. And as we discussed in the preceding chapter, saving is an 
important long-run determinant of a nation’s productivity. If the United States 
could somehow raise its saving rate, more resources would be available for capital 
accumulation, GDP would grow more rapidly, and over time, U.S. citizens would 
enjoy a higher standard of living.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives. 
Many economists have used this principle to suggest that the low rate of saving 
is at least partly attributable to tax laws that discourage saving. The U.S. federal 
government, as well as many state governments, collects revenue by taxing

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
income, including interest and dividend income. To see the effects of this policy, 
consider a 25-year-old who saves $1,000 and buys a 30-year bond that pays an 
interest rate of 9 percent. In the absence of taxes, the $1,000 grows to $13,268 
when the individual reaches age 55. Yet if that interest is taxed at a rate of, say, 
33 percent, the after-tax interest rate is only 6 percent. In this case, the $1,000 grows 
to only $5,743 over the 30 years. The tax on interest income substantially reduces 
the future payoff from current saving and, as a result, reduces the incentive for 
people to save. 
In response to this problem, some economists and lawmakers have proposed 
reforming the tax code to encourage greater saving. For example, one proposal is 
to expand eligibility for special accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 
that allow people to shelter some of their saving from taxation. Let’s consider the 
effect of such a saving incentive on the market for loanable funds, as illustrated in 
Figure 2. We analyze this policy following our three steps.
First, which curve would this policy affect? Because the tax change would 
alter the incentive for households to save at any given interest rate, it would affect 
the quantity of loanable funds supplied at each interest rate. Thus, the supply of 
loanable funds would shift. The demand for loanable funds would remain the 
same because the tax change would not directly affect the amount that borrowers 
want to borrow at any given interest rate. 
Second, which way would the supply curve shift? Because saving would be 
taxed less heavily than under current law, households would increase their saving 
by consuming a smaller fraction of their income. Households would use this 
additional saving to increase their deposits in banks or to buy more bonds. The 
supply of loanable funds would increase, and the supply curve would shift to the 
right from S1 to S2, as shown in Figure 2.
Finally, we can compare the old and new equilibria. In the figure, the increased 
supply of loanable funds reduces the interest rate from 5 percent to 4 percent. The 
lower interest rate raises the quantity of loanable funds demanded from $1,200 
billion to $1,600 billion. That is, the shift in the supply curve moves the market 
FIGURE 2
Saving Incentives Increase the Supply of

A change in the tax laws to encourage 
Americans to save more would shift the 
supply of loanable funds to the right from 
S1 to S2. As a result, the equilibrium 
interest rate would fall, and the lower 
interest rate would stimulate investment. 
Here the equilibrium interest rate falls 
from 5 percent to 4 percent, and the 
equilibrium quantity of loanable funds 
saved and invested rises from $1,200 
billion to $1,600 billion.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
equilibrium along the demand curve. With a lower cost of borrowing, households 
and firms are motivated to borrow more to finance greater investment. Thus, if a 
reform of the tax laws encouraged greater saving, the result would be lower interest rates 
and greater investment. 
This analysis of the effects of increased saving is widely accepted among 
economists, but there is less consensus about what kinds of tax changes should 
be enacted. Many economists endorse tax reform aimed at increasing saving to 
stimulate investment and growth. Yet others are skeptical that these tax changes 
would have much effect on national saving. These skeptics also doubt the equity 
of the proposed reforms. They argue that, in many cases, the benefits of the tax 
changes would accrue primarily to the wealthy, who are least in need of tax relief. 
26-3c Policy 2: Investment Incentives
Suppose that Congress passed a tax reform aimed at making investment more 
attractive. In essence, this is what Congress does when it institutes an investment 
tax credit, which it does from time to time. An investment tax credit gives a tax 
advantage to any firm building a new factory or buying a new piece of equipment. 
Let’s consider the effect of such a tax reform on the market for loanable funds, as 
illustrated in Figure 3.
First, would the law affect supply or demand? Because the tax credit would 
reward firms that borrow and invest in new capital, it would alter investment at 
any given interest rate and, thereby, change the demand for loanable funds. By 
contrast, because the tax credit would not affect the amount that households save 
at any given interest rate, it would not affect the supply of loanable funds.
Second, which way would the demand curve shift? Because firms would have 
an incentive to increase investment at any interest rate, the quantity of loanable 
funds demanded would be higher at any given interest rate. Thus, the demand 
curve for loanable funds would move to the right, as shown by the shift from D1
to D2 in the figure.
FIGURE 3
Investment Incentives Increase the 
Demand for Loanable Funds
If the passage of an investment tax 
credit encouraged firms to invest more, 
the demand for loanable funds would 
increase. As a result, the equilibrium 
interest rate would rise, and the higher 
interest rate would stimulate saving. 
Here, when the demand curve shifts 
from D1 to D2, the equilibrium interest 
rate rises from 5 percent to 6 percent, 
and the equilibrium quantity of loanable 
funds saved and invested rises from 
$1,200 billion to $1,400 billion.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
Third, consider how the equilibrium would change. In Figure 3, the increased 
demand for loanable funds raises the interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent, and 
the higher interest rate in turn increases the quantity of loanable funds supplied 
from $1,200 billion to $1,400 billion, as households respond by increasing the 
amount they save. This change in household behavior is represented here as 
a movement along the supply curve. Thus, if a reform of the tax laws encouraged 
greater investment, the result would be higher interest rates and greater saving.
26-3d Policy 3: Government Budget Deficits and Surpluses
A perpetual topic of political debate is the status of the government budget. 
Recall that a budget deficit is an excess of government spending over tax revenue. 
Governments finance budget deficits by borrowing in the bond market, and 
the accumulation of past government borrowing is called the government debt. 
A budget surplus, an excess of tax revenue over government spending, can be used 
to repay some of the government debt. If government spending exactly equals tax 
revenue, the government is said to have a balanced budget.
Imagine that the government starts with a balanced budget and then, because 
of an increase in government spending, starts running a budget deficit. We can 
analyze the effects of the budget deficit by following our three steps in the market 
for loanable funds, as illustrated in Figure 4. 
First, which curve shifts when the government starts running a budget 
deficit? Recall that national saving—the source of the supply of loanable funds—
is composed of private saving and public saving. A change in the government 
budget balance represents a change in public saving and, therefore, in the supply 
of loanable funds. Because the budget deficit does not influence the amount that 
households and firms want to borrow to finance investment at any given interest 
rate, it does not alter the demand for loanable funds.
Second, which way does the supply curve shift? When the government runs a 
budget deficit, public saving is negative, and this reduces national saving. In other 
words, when the government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it reduces 
FIGURE 4
The Effect of a Government Budget Deficit
When the government spends more than 
it receives in tax revenue, the resulting 
budget deficit lowers national saving. 
The supply of loanable funds decreases, 
and the equilibrium interest rate rises. 
Thus, when the government borrows to 
finance its budget deficit, it crowds out 
households and firms that otherwise 
would borrow to finance investment. 
Here, when the supply curve shifts from 
S1 to S2, the equilibrium interest rate 
rises from 5 percent to 6 percent, and the 
equilibrium quantity of loanable funds 
saved and invested falls from $1,200 
billion to $800 billion.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
the supply of loanable funds available to finance investment by households and 
firms. Thus, a budget deficit shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left 
from S1 to S2, as shown in Figure 4.
Third, we can compare the old and new equilibria. In the figure, when the 
budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds, the interest rate rises from 
5 percent to 6 percent. This higher interest rate then alters the behavior of the 
households and firms that participate in the loan market. In particular, many 
demanders of loanable funds are discouraged by the higher interest rate. Fewer 
families buy new homes, and fewer firms choose to build new factories. The fall 
in investment because of government borrowing is called crowding out and is 
represented in Figure 4 by the movement along the demand curve from a quantity 
of $1,200 billion in loanable funds to a quantity of $800 billion. That is, when the 
government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it crowds out private borrowers 
who are trying to finance investment.
Thus, the most basic lesson about budget deficits follows directly from their 
effects on the supply and demand for loanable funds: When the government reduces 
national saving by running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises and investment falls. 
Because investment is important for long-run economic growth, government 
budget deficits reduce the economy’s growth rate.
Why, you might ask, does a budget deficit affect the supply of loanable funds, 
rather than the demand for them? After all, the government finances a budget deficit 
by selling bonds, thereby borrowing from the private sector. Why does increased 
borrowing by the government shift the supply curve, whereas increased borrowing 
by private investors shifts the demand curve? To answer this question, we need to 
examine more precisely the meaning of “loanable funds.” The model as presented 
here takes this term to mean the flow of resources available to fund private investment; 
thus, a government budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds. If, instead, we 
had defined the term “loanable funds” to mean the flow of resources 
available from private saving, then the government budget deficit 
would increase demand rather than reduce supply. Changing the 
interpretation of the term would cause a semantic change in how 
we described the model, but the bottom line from the analysis 
would be the same: In either case, a budget deficit increases the 
interest rate, thereby crowding out private borrowers who are 
relying on financial markets to fund private investment projects.
So far, we have examined a budget deficit that results from 
an increase in government spending, but a budget deficit that 
results from a tax cut has similar effects. A tax cut reduces 
public saving, T 2 G. Private saving, Y 2 T 2 C, might increase 
because of lower T, but as long as households respond to the 
lower taxes by consuming more, C increases, so private saving 
rises by less than public saving declines. Thus, national saving 
(S 5 Y 2 C 2 G), the sum of public and private saving, declines. 
Once again, the budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable 
funds, drives up the interest rate, and crowds out borrowers 
trying to finance capital investments. 
Now that we understand the impact of budget deficits, we 
can turn the analysis around and see that government budget 
surpluses have the opposite effects. When the government 
collects more in tax revenue than it spends, it saves the 
difference by retiring some of the outstanding government 
crowding out
a decrease in investment 
that results from 
government borrowing
“Sustained tax and spending policies that boost consumption  
in ways that reduce the saving rate are likely to lower long-run 
 living standards.”

debt. This budget surplus, or public saving, contributes to national saving. 
Thus, a budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest 
rate, and stimulates investment. Higher investment, in turn, means greater capital 
accumulation and more rapid economic growth.
CASE 
STUDY
THE HISTORY OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT
How indebted is the U.S. government? The answer to this question 
varies substantially over time. Figure 5 shows the debt of the U.S. 
federal government expressed as a percentage of U.S. GDP. It shows 
that the government debt has fluctuated from zero in 1836 to 107 
percent of GDP in 1945.
The behavior of the debt-to-GDP ratio is one gauge of what’s happening with the 
government’s finances. Because GDP is a rough measure of the government’s tax 
base, a declining debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that the government indebtedness is 
shrinking relative to its ability to raise tax revenue. This suggests that the government 
is, in some sense, living within its means. By contrast, a rising debt-to-GDP ratio 
means that the government indebtedness is increasing relative to its ability to raise 
tax revenue. It is often interpreted as meaning that fiscal policy—government 
spending and taxes—cannot be sustained forever at current levels.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Throughout history, the primary cause of fluctuations in government debt 
has been war. When wars occur, government spending on national defense rises 
substantially to pay for soldiers and military equipment. Taxes sometimes rise 
as well but typically by much less than the increase in spending. The result is a 
budget deficit and increasing government debt. When the war is over, government 
spending declines and the debt-to-GDP ratio starts declining as well.
There are two reasons to believe that debt financing of war is an appropriate 
policy. First, it allows the government to keep tax rates smooth over time. Without 
debt financing, tax rates would have to rise sharply during wars, and this would 
cause a substantial decline in economic efficiency. Second, debt financing of wars 
shifts part of the cost of wars to future generations, who will have to pay off the 
government debt. This is arguably a fair distribution of the burden, for future 
generations get some of the benefit when one generation fights a war to defend the 
nation against foreign aggressors. 
One large increase in government debt that cannot be explained by war is the 
increase that occurred beginning around 1980. When President Ronald Reagan took 
office in 1981, he was committed to smaller government and lower taxes. Yet he 
found cutting government spending to be more difficult politically than cutting taxes. 
The result was the beginning of a period of large budget deficits that continued not 
only through Reagan’s time in office but also for many years thereafter. As a result, 
government debt rose from 26 percent of GDP in 1980 to 48 percent of GDP in 1993. 
Because government budget deficits reduce national saving, investment, and 
long-run economic growth, the rise in government debt during the 1980s troubled 
many economists and policymakers. When Bill Clinton moved into the Oval Office 
in 1993, deficit reduction was his first major goal. Similarly, when the Republicans 
took control of Congress in 1995, deficit reduction was high on their legislative 
agenda. Both of these efforts substantially reduced the size of the government 
budget deficit. In addition, a booming economy in the late 1990s brought in even 
more tax revenue. Eventually, the federal budget turned from deficit to surplus, 
and the debt-to-GDP ratio declined significantly for several years.
This fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio, however, stopped during the presidency of 
George W. Bush, as the budget surplus turned back into a budget deficit. There were 
three main reasons for this change. First, President Bush signed into law several major 
tax cuts, which he had promised during the 2000 presidential campaign. Second, in 
2001, the economy experienced a recession (a reduction in economic activity), which 
automatically decreased tax revenue and increased government spending. Third, 
there were increases in government spending on homeland security following the 
September 11, 2001 attacks and on the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Truly dramatic increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio started occurring in 2008, as the 
economy experienced a financial crisis and a deep recession. (The accompanying 
FYI box addresses this topic briefly, but we will study it more fully in coming 
chapters.) The recession automatically increased the budget deficit, and several 
policy measures enacted during the Bush and Obama administrations aimed at 
combating the recession reduced tax revenue and increased government spending 
even more. From 2009 to 2012, the federal government’s budget deficit averaged 
about 9 percent of GDP, levels not seen since World War II. The borrowing to 
finance these deficits led to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 39 percent in 
2008 to 70 percent in 2012. After 2012, as the economy recovered, the budget deficits 
shrank, and the increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio became smaller. ●

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
26-4 Conclusion
Financial Crises
I
n 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy and many other major economies 
around the world experienced a financial crisis, which in turn led to 
a deep downturn in economic activity. We will examine these events 
in detail later in this book. But because this chapter introduces the 
financial system, let’s discuss briefly the key elements of financial 
crises.
The first element of a financial crisis is a large decline in some 
asset prices. In 2008 and 2009, that asset was real estate. The price of 
housing, after experiencing a boom earlier in the decade, fell by about 30 
percent over just a few years. Such a large decline in real estate prices 
had not been seen in the United States since the 1930s.
The second element of a financial crisis is widespread insolvencies 
at financial institutions. (A company is insolvent when its debts exceed 
the value of its assets.) In 2008 and 2009, many banks and other 
financial firms had in effect placed bets on real estate prices by holding 
mortgages backed by that real estate. When house prices fell, large 
numbers of homeowners stopped repaying their loans. These defaults 
pushed several major financial institutions toward bankruptcy.
The third element of a financial crisis is a decline in confidence 
in financial institutions. Although some deposits in banks are 
insured by government policies, not all are. As insolvencies mounted, 
every financial institution became a possible candidate for the next 
bankruptcy. Individuals and firms with uninsured deposits in those 
institutions pulled out their money. Facing a rash of withdrawals, banks 
started selling off assets (sometimes at reduced “fire-sale” prices) and 
cut back on new lending.
The fourth element 
of a financial crisis is a 
credit crunch. With many 
financial institutions facing 
difficulties, prospective 
borrowers had trouble getting 
loans, even if they had profitable 
investment projects. In essence, the financial system had trouble 
performing its normal function of directing the resources of savers into 
the hands of borrowers with the best investment opportunities.
The fifth element of a financial crisis is an economic downturn. 
With people unable to obtain financing for new investment projects, 
the overall demand for goods and services declined. As a result, for 
reasons we discuss more fully later in the book, national income fell and 
unemployment rose.
The sixth and final element of a financial crisis is a vicious circle. 
The economic downturn reduced the profitability of many companies 
and the value of many assets. Thus, we started over again at step one, 
and the problems in the financial system and the economic downturn 
reinforced each other.
Financial crises, such as the one of 2008 and 2009, can have severe 
consequences. Fortunately, they do end. Financial institutions eventually 
get back on their feet, perhaps with some help from government policy, 
and they return to their normal function of financial intermediation. ■

g
“Neither a borrower nor a lender be,” Polonius advises his son in Shakespeare’s 
Hamlet. If everyone followed this advice, this chapter would have been 
unnecessary. 
Few economists would agree with Polonius. In our economy, people borrow 
and lend often, and usually for good reason. You may borrow one day to start 
your own business or to buy a home. And people may lend to you in the hope 
that the interest you pay will allow them to enjoy a more prosperous retirement. 
The financial system’s job is to coordinate all this borrowing and lending activity.
In many ways, financial markets are like other markets in the economy. The 
price of loanable funds—the interest rate—is governed by the forces of supply 
and demand, just as other prices in the economy are. And we can analyze shifts in 
supply or demand in financial markets as we do in other markets. One of the Ten 
Principles of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good 
way to organize economic activity. This principle applies to financial markets as 
well. When financial markets bring the supply and demand for loanable funds

into balance, they help allocate the economy’s scarce resources to their most 
efficient uses.
In one way, however, financial markets are special. Financial markets, unlike 
most other markets, serve the important role of linking the present and the future. 
Those who supply loanable funds—savers—do so because they want to convert 
some of their current income into future purchasing power. Those who demand 
loanable funds—borrowers—do so because they want to invest today in order to 
have additional capital in the future to produce goods and services. Thus, well-
functioning financial markets are important not only for current generations but 
also for future generations who will inherit many of the resulting benefits. 
• The U.S. financial system is made up of many types 
of financial institutions, such as the bond market, 
the stock market, banks, and mutual funds. All these 
institutions act to direct the resources of households 
that want to save some of their income into the hands 
of households and firms that want to borrow.
• National income accounting identities reveal some 
important relationships among macroeconomic 
variables. In particular, for a closed economy, national 
saving must equal investment. Financial institutions 
are the mechanism through which the economy 
matches one person’s saving with another person’s 
investment.
• The interest rate is determined by the supply and 
demand for loanable funds. The supply of loanable 
funds comes from households that want to save 
1. Elaine wants to buy and operate an ice-cream truck 
but doesn’t have the financial resources to start the 
business. She borrows $10,000 from her friend 
George, to whom she promises an interest rate of  
7 percent, and gets another $20,000 from her friend 
Jerry, to whom she promises a third of her profits.

a. George is a stockholder, and Elaine is a bondholder.
b. George is a stockholder, and Jerry is a bondholder.
c. Jerry is a stockholder, and Elaine is a bondholder.
d. Jerry is a stockholder, and George is a bondholder.

spends, and households consume more than they get 
in after-tax income, then
a. private and public saving are both positive.
b. private and public saving are both negative.
c. private saving is positive, but public saving is negative.
d. private saving is negative, but public saving is 
positive.

KEY CONCEPTS
1. What is the role of the financial system? Name and 
describe two markets that are part of the financial 
system in the U.S. economy. Name and describe two 
financial intermediaries.
2. Why is it important for people who own stocks and 
bonds to diversify their holdings? What type of 
financial institution makes diversification easier?
3. What is national saving? What is private saving? 
What is public saving? How are these three variables 
related?
4. What is investment? How is it related to national 
saving in a closed economy?
5. Describe a change in the tax code that might increase 
private saving. If this policy were implemented, how 
would it affect the market for loanable funds?
6. What is a government budget deficit? How does it  
affect interest rates, investment, and economic 
growth?
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
some of their income and lend it out. The demand 
for loanable funds comes from households and firms 
that want to borrow for investment. To analyze how 
any policy or event affects the interest rate, one must 
consider how it affects the supply and demand for 
loanable funds.
• National saving equals private saving plus public 
saving. A government budget deficit represents 
negative public saving and, therefore, reduces national 
saving and the supply of loanable funds available 
to finance investment. When a government budget 
deficit crowds out investment, it reduces the growth of 
productivity and GDP.
1. For each of the following pairs, which bond would 
you expect to pay a higher interest rate? Explain.
a. a bond of the U.S. government or a bond of an 
Eastern European government
b. a bond that repays the principal in year 2020 or a 
bond that repays the principal in year 2040
c. a bond from Coca-Cola or a bond from a software 
company you run in your garage
d. a bond issued by the federal government or a 
bond issued by New York State
2. Many workers hold large amounts of stock issued by 
the firms at which they work. Why do you suppose 
companies encourage this behavior? Why might a 
person not want to hold stock in the company where 
he works? 
3. Explain the difference between saving and investment 
as defined by a macroeconomist. Which of the 
following situations represent investment and which 
represent saving? Explain.
a. Your family takes out a mortgage and buys a new 
house.
b. You use your $200 paycheck to buy stock in AT&T.
c. Your roommate earns $100 and deposits it in his 
account at a bank.
d. You borrow $1,000 from a bank to buy a car to use 
in your pizza delivery business.

CHAPTER 26   SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
4. Suppose GDP is $8 trillion, taxes are $1.5 trillion, 
private saving is $0.5 trillion, and public saving is  
$0.2 trillion. Assuming this economy is closed, 
calculate consumption, government purchases, 
national saving, and investment. 
5. Economists in Funlandia, a closed economy, have 
collected the following information about the 
economy for a particular year: 
Y 5 10,000
C 5 6,000 
T 5 1,500 
G 5 1,700 
 The economists also estimate that the investment 
function is: 
I 5 3,300 2 100r, 
 where r is the country’s real interest rate, expressed as 
a percentage. Calculate private saving, public saving, 
national saving, investment, and the equilibrium real 
interest rate. 
6. Suppose that Intel is considering building a new chip-
making factory. 
a. Assuming that Intel needs to borrow money in the 
bond market, why would an increase in interest 
rates affect Intel’s decision about whether to build 
the factory?
b. If Intel has enough of its own funds to finance 
the new factory without borrowing, would an 
increase in interest rates still affect Intel’s decision 
about whether to build the factory? Explain.
7. Three students have each saved $1,000. Each has 
an investment opportunity in which he or she can 
invest up to $2,000. Here are the rates of return on the 
students’ investment projects:
Harry 
5 percent
Ron 
8 percent
Hermione  20 percent
a. If borrowing and lending are prohibited, so each 
student uses only personal saving to finance his or 
her own investment project, how much will each 
student have a year later when the project pays its 
return?
b. Now suppose their school opens up a market for 
loanable funds in which students can borrow and 
lend among themselves at an interest rate r. What 
would determine whether a student would choose 
to be a borrower or lender in this market?
c. Among these three students, what would be the 
quantity of loanable funds supplied and quantity 
demanded at an interest rate of 7 percent? At  
10 percent?
d. At what interest rate would the loanable funds 
market among these three students be in 
equilibrium? At this interest rate, which student(s) 
would borrow and which student(s) would lend?
e. At the equilibrium interest rate, how much does 
each student have a year later after the investment 
projects pay their return and loans have been  
repaid? Compare your answers to those you gave 
in part (a). Who benefits from the existence of 
the loanable funds market—the borrowers or the 
lenders? Is anyone worse off?
8. Suppose the government borrows $20 billion more 
next year than this year.
a. Use a supply-and-demand diagram to analyze 
this policy. Does the interest rate rise or fall? 
b. What happens to investment? To private saving? 
To public saving? To national saving? Compare 
the size of the changes to the $20 billion of extra 
government borrowing.
c. How does the elasticity of supply of loanable 
funds affect the size of these changes? 
d. How does the elasticity of demand for loanable 
funds affect the size of these changes?
e. Suppose households believe that greater govern-
ment borrowing today implies higher taxes to pay 
off the government debt in the future. What does 
this belief do to private saving and the supply of 
loanable funds today? Does it increase or decrease 
the effects you discussed in parts (a) and (b)?
9. This chapter explains that investment can be increased 
both by reducing taxes on private saving and by  
reducing the government budget deficit.
a. Why is it difficult to implement both of these 
policies at the same time?
b. What would you need to know about private sav-
ing to judge which of these two policies would be 
a more effective way to raise investment?

The Basic Tools of Finance
CHAPTER
27
S
ometime in your life, you will deal with the economy’s financial system. You 
will deposit your savings in a bank account, or you will take out a loan to 
cover tuition or to buy a house. After you have a job, your employer will start 
a retirement account for you, and you will decide whether to invest the funds in 
stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. If you try to put together your own 
portfolio, you will have to decide between investing in established companies 
such as General Electric or newer ones such as Twitter. And in the media, you 
will hear reports about whether the stock market is up or down, together with the 
often feeble attempts to explain why the market behaves as it does.
If you reflect for a moment on the many financial decisions you 
will make during your life, you will see two related 
 elements in almost all of them: time and risk.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
As we saw in the preceding two chapters, the financial system coordinates the 
economy’s saving and investment, which in turn are crucial determinants of eco-
nomic growth. Most fundamentally, the financial system concerns decisions and 
actions we undertake today that will affect our lives in the future. But the future 
is unknown. When a person decides to allocate some saving, or a firm decides 
to undertake an investment, the decision is based on a guess about the likely 
result. The actual result, however, could end up being very different from what 
was expected.
This chapter introduces some tools that help us understand the decisions that 
people make as they participate in financial markets. The field of finance devel-
ops these tools in great detail, and you may choose to take courses that focus on 
this topic. But because the financial system is so important to the functioning of 
the economy, many of the basic insights of finance are central to understanding 
how the economy works. The tools of finance can also help you think through 
some of the decisions that you will make in your own life.
This chapter takes up three topics. First, we discuss how to compare sums of 
money at different points in time. Second, we discuss how to manage risk. Third, 
we build on our analysis of time and risk to examine what determines the value of 
an asset, such as a share of stock.

people make decisions 
regarding the allocation 
of resources over time 
and the handling of risk
27-1 Present Value: Measuring the Time Value of Money 
Imagine that someone offers to give you $100 today or $100 in 10 years. Which 
would you choose? This is an easy question. Getting $100 today is better because 
you can always deposit the money in a bank, still have it in 10 years, and earn 
interest on the $100 along the way. The lesson: Money today is more valuable than 
the same amount of money in the future.
Now consider a harder question: Imagine that someone offers you $100 today 
or $200 in 10 years. Which would you choose? To answer this question, you need 
some way to compare sums of money from different points in time. Economists 
do this with a concept called present value. The present value of any future sum 
of money is the amount today that would be needed, at current interest rates, to 
produce that future sum.
To learn how to use the concept of present value, let’s work through a couple of 
simple examples: 
Question: If you put $100 in a bank account today, how much will it be worth in 
N years? That is, what will be the future value of this $100?
Answer: Let’s use r to denote the interest rate expressed in decimal form (so an 
interest rate of 5 percent means r = 0.05). Suppose that interest is paid annually 
and that it remains in the bank account to earn more interest—a process called 
compounding. Then the $100 will become 
(1 1 r) 3 $100 
after 1 year, 
(1 1 r) 3 (1 1 r) 3 $100 5 (1 1 r)2 3 $100 
after 2 years, 
(1 1 r) 3 (1 1 r) 3 (1 1 r) 3 $100 5 (1 1 r)3 3 $100 
after 3 years, . . .
(1 1 r)N 3 $100 
after N years. 
For example, if we are investing at an interest rate of 5 percent for 10 years, then 
the future value of the $100 will be (1.05)10 3 $100, or $163.
present value
the amount of money 
today that would be 
needed, using prevailing 
interest rates, to produce 
a given future amount of 
money

the future that an amount 
of money today will yield, 
given prevailing interest 
rates

CHAPTER 27   THE BASIC TOOLS OF FINANCE
Question: Now suppose you are going to be paid $200 in N years. What is 
the present value of this future payment? That is, how much would you have to 
deposit in a bank right now to yield $200 in N years?
 Answer: To answer this question, just turn the previous answer on its head. In 
the last question, we computed a future value from a present value by multiplying 
by the factor (1 1 r)N. To compute a present value from a future value, we divide by 
the factor (1 1 r)N. Thus, the present value of $200 in N years is $200/(1 1 r)N. If that 
amount is deposited in a bank today, after N years it will become (1 1 r)N 3 [$200/
(1 1 r)N], which equals $200. For instance, if the interest rate is 5 percent, the present 
value of $200 to be paid in 10 years is $200/(1.05)10, or $123. This means that $123 
deposited today in a bank account that earned 5 percent would produce $200 after 
10 years.
This illustrates the general formula: 
• If r is the interest rate, then an amount X to be received in N years has a 
present value of X/(1 1 r)N. 
Because the possibility of earning interest reduces the present value below the 
amount X, the process of finding a present value of a future sum of money is 
called discounting. This formula shows precisely how much future sums should 
be discounted.
Let’s now return to our earlier question: Should you choose $100 today or $200 
in 10 years? Based on our calculation of present value using an interest rate of 
5 percent, you should prefer the $200 in 10 years. The future $200 has a present 
value of $123, which is greater than $100. You are better off waiting for the future 
sum.
Notice that the answer to our question depends on the interest rate. If the 
interest rate were 8 percent, then the $200 in 10 years would have a present value 
of $200/(1.08)10, which is only $93. In this case, you should take the $100 today. 
Why should the interest rate matter for your choice? The answer is that the higher 
the interest rate, the more you can earn by depositing your money in a bank, so 
the more attractive getting $100 today becomes.
The concept of present value is useful in many applications, including the 
decisions that companies face when evaluating investment projects. For instance, 
imagine that General Motors is thinking about building a new factory. Suppose 
that the factory will cost $100 million today and will yield the company $200 
million in 10 years. Should General Motors undertake the project? You can see that 
this decision is exactly like the one we have been studying. To make its decision, 
the company should compare the present value of the $200 million return to the 
$100 million cost. 
The company’s decision, therefore, will depend on the interest rate. If the 
interest rate is 5 percent, then the present value of the $200 million return from the 
factory is $123 million, and the company will choose to pay the $100 million cost. 
By contrast, if the interest rate is 8 percent, then the present value of the return 
is only $93 million, and the company will decide to forgo the project. Thus, the 
concept of present value helps explain why investment—and thus the quantity of 
loanable funds demanded—declines when the interest rate rises.
Here is another application of present value: Suppose you win a million-
dollar lottery and are given a choice between $20,000 a year for 50 years (totaling 
$1,000,000) or an immediate payment of $400,000. Which would you choose?

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
To make the right choice, you need to calculate the present value of the stream 
of payments. Let’s suppose the interest rate is 7 percent. After performing 50 
calculations similar to those above (one calculation for each payment) and adding 
up the results, you would learn that the present value of this million-dollar 
prize at a 7 percent interest rate is only $276,000. You are better off picking the 
immediate payment of $400,000. The million dollars may seem like more money, 
but the future cash flows, once discounted to the present, are worth far less.
QuickQuiz
The interest rate is 7 percent. What is the present value of $150 to be 
received in 10 years?
The Magic of Compounding and the Rule of 70
S
uppose you observe that one country has an average growth rate 
of 1 percent per year, while another has an average growth rate of 
3 percent per year. At first, this might not seem like a big deal. What 
difference can 2 percent make? 
The answer is: a big difference. Growth rates that seem small when 
written in percentage terms are large after they are compounded for 
many years. 
Consider an example. Suppose that two college graduates—Elliot 
and Darlene—both take their first jobs at the age of 22 earning $30,000 
a year. Elliot lives in an economy where all incomes grow at 1 percent 
per year, while Darlene lives in one where incomes grow at 3 percent per 
year. Straightforward calculations show what happens. Forty years later, 
when both are 62 years old, Elliot earns $45,000 a year, while Darlene 
earns $98,000. Because of that difference of 2 percentage points in the 
growth rate, Darlene’s salary is more than twice Elliot’s.
An old rule of thumb, called the rule of 70, is helpful in understanding 
growth rates and the effects of compounding. According to the rule of 70, 
if some variable grows at a rate of x percent per year, then that variable 
doubles in approximately 70/x years. In Elliot’s economy, incomes grow 
at 1 percent per year, so it takes about 70 years for incomes to double. In 
Darlene’s economy, incomes 
grow at 3 percent per year, 
so it takes about 70/3, or 
23, years for incomes to 
double.
The rule of 70 applies not 
only to a growing economy but also to 
a growing savings account. Here is an example: In 1791, Ben Franklin died 
and left $5,000 to be invested for a period of 200 years to benefit medical 
students and scientific research. If this money had earned 7 percent per 
year (which would, in fact, have been possible), the investment would have 
doubled in value every 10 years. Over 200 years, it would have doubled 20 
times. At the end of 200 years of compounding, the investment would have 
been worth 220 × $5,000, which is about $5 billion. (In fact, Franklin’s 
$5,000 grew to only $2 million over 200 years because some of the money 
was spent along the way.)
As these examples show, growth rates and interest rates 
compounded over many years can lead to some spectacular results. That 
is probably why Albert Einstein once called compounding “the greatest 
mathematical discovery of all time.” ■

27-2 Managing Risk
Life is full of gambles. When you go skiing, you risk breaking your leg in a fall. 
When you drive to work, you risk a car accident. When you put some of your 
savings in the stock market, you risk a fall in stock prices. The rational response to 
this risk is not necessarily to avoid it at any cost but to take it into account in your 
decision making. Let’s consider how a person might do that.
27-2a Risk Aversion
Most people are risk averse. This means more than that people dislike bad things 
happening to them. It means that they dislike bad things more than they like 
comparable good things.

CHAPTER 27   THE BASIC TOOLS OF FINANCE
For example, suppose a friend offers you the following opportunity. She will 
toss a coin. If it comes up heads, she will pay you $1,000. But if it comes up tails, 
you will have to pay her $1,000. Would you accept the bargain? You wouldn’t if 
you were risk averse. For a risk-averse person, the pain of losing the $1,000 would 
exceed the pleasure from winning $1,000.
Economists have developed models of risk aversion using the concept of utility, 
which is a person’s subjective measure of well-being or satisfaction. Every level of 
wealth provides a certain amount of utility, as shown by the utility function in 
Figure 1. But the function exhibits the property of diminishing marginal utility: 
The more wealth a person has, the less utility she gets from an additional dollar. 
Thus, in the figure, the utility function gets flatter as wealth increases. Because 
of diminishing marginal utility, the utility lost from losing the $1,000 bet is more 
than the utility gained from winning it. As a result, people are risk averse.
Risk aversion provides the starting point for explaining various things we 
observe in the economy. Let’s consider three of them: insurance, diversification, 
and the risk-return trade-off.
27-2b The Markets for Insurance
One way to deal with risk is to buy insurance. The general feature of insurance 
contracts is that a person facing a risk pays a fee to an insurance company, which 
in return agrees to accept all or part of the risk. There are many types of insurance. 
Car insurance covers the risk of your being in an auto accident, fire insurance 
covers the risk that your house will burn down, health insurance covers the risk 
that you might need expensive medical treatment, and life insurance covers the 
risk that you will die and leave your family without your income. There is also 
insurance against the risk of living too long: For a fee paid today, an insurance 
company will pay you an annuity—a regular income every year until you die.
In a sense, every insurance contract is a gamble. It is possible that you will not 
be in an auto accident, that your house will not burn down, and that you will 
not need expensive medical treatment. In most years, you will pay the insurance 
company the premium and get nothing in return except peace of mind. Indeed, 
FIGURE 1
The Utility Function
This utility function shows how utility, 
a subjective measure of satisfaction, 
depends on wealth. As wealth rises, the 
utility function becomes flatter, reflecting 
the property of diminishing marginal 
utility. Because of diminishing marginal 
utility, a $1,000 loss decreases utility by 
more than a $1,000 gain increases it.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
the insurance company is counting on the fact that most people will not make 
claims on their policies; otherwise, it couldn’t pay out large claims to the unlucky 
few and still stay in business.
From the standpoint of the economy as a whole, the role of insurance is not 
to eliminate the risks inherent in life but to spread them around more efficiently. 
Consider fire insurance, for instance. Owning fire insurance does not reduce the 
risk of losing your home in a fire. But if that unlucky event occurs, the insurance 
company compensates you. The risk, rather than being borne by you alone, is 
shared among the thousands of insurance-company shareholders. Because people 
are risk averse, it is easier for 10,000 people to bear 1/10,000 of the risk than for 
one person to bear the entire risk herself.
The markets for insurance suffer from two types of problems that impede their 
ability to spread risk. One problem is adverse selection: A high-risk person is more 
likely to apply for insurance than a low-risk person because a high-risk person 
would benefit more from insurance protection. A second problem is moral hazard: 
After people buy insurance, they have less incentive to be careful about their 
risky behavior because the insurance company will cover much of the resulting 
losses. Insurance companies are aware of these problems, but they cannot fully 
guard against them. An insurance company cannot perfectly distinguish between 
high-risk and low-risk customers, and it cannot monitor all of its customers’ 
risky behavior. The price of insurance reflects the actual risks that the insurance 
company will face after the insurance is bought. The high price of insurance is 
why some people, especially those who know themselves to be low-risk, decide 
against buying it and, instead, endure some of life’s uncertainty on their own.
27-2c Diversification of Firm-Specific Risk
In 2002, Enron, a large and once widely respected company, went bankrupt amid 
accusations of fraud and accounting irregularities. Several of the company’s top 
executives were prosecuted and ended up going to prison. The saddest part of 
the story, however, involved thousands of lower-level employees. Not only did 
they lose their jobs but many lost their life savings as well. The employees had 
put about two-thirds of their retirement funds in Enron stock, which became 
worthless.
If there is one piece of practical advice that finance offers to risk-averse people, 
it is this: “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” You may have heard this before, 
but finance has turned this folk wisdom into a science. It goes by the name 
diversification.
The market for insurance is one example of diversification. Imagine a town 
with 10,000 homeowners, each facing the risk of a house fire. If someone starts 
an insurance company and each person in town becomes both a shareholder and 
a policyholder of the company, they all reduce their risk through diversification. 
Each person now faces 1/10,000 of the risk of 10,000 possible fires, rather than the 
entire risk of a single fire in her own home. Unless the entire town catches fire at 
the same time, the downside that each person faces is much smaller.
When people use their savings to buy financial assets, they can also reduce risk 
through diversification. A person who buys stock in a company is placing a bet 
on the future profitability of that company. That bet is often quite risky because 
companies’ fortunes are hard to predict. Microsoft evolved from a start-up by 
some geeky teenagers into one of the world’s most valuable companies in only 
a few years; Enron went from one of the world’s most respected companies to an 
almost worthless one in only a few months. Fortunately, a shareholder need not

CHAPTER 27   THE BASIC TOOLS OF FINANCE
tie her own fortune to that of any single company. Risk can be reduced by placing 
a large number of small bets, rather than a small number of large ones.
Figure 2 shows how the risk of a portfolio of stocks depends on the number of 
stocks in the portfolio. Risk is measured here with a statistic called the standard 
deviation, which you may have learned about in a math or statistics class. The 
standard deviation measures the volatility of a variable—that is, how much the 
variable is likely to fluctuate. The higher the standard deviation of a portfolio’s 
return, the more volatile its return is likely to be, and the riskier it is that someone 
holding the portfolio will fail to get the return that she expected. 
The figure shows that the risk of a stock portfolio falls substantially as the 
number of stocks increases. For a portfolio with a single stock, the standard 
deviation is 49 percent. Going from 1 stock to 10 stocks eliminates about half 
the risk. Going from 10 to 20 stocks reduces the risk by another 10 percent. As 
the number of stocks continues to increase, risk continues to fall, although the 
reductions in risk after 20 or 30 stocks are small.
Notice that it is impossible to eliminate all risk by increasing the number of 
stocks in the portfolio. Diversification can eliminate firm-specific risk—the 
uncertainty associated with the specific companies. But diversification cannot 
eliminate market risk—the uncertainty associated with the entire economy, which 
affects all companies traded on the stock market. For example, when the economy 
goes into a recession, most companies experience falling sales, reduced profit, and 
low stock returns. Diversification reduces the risk of holding stocks, but it does 
not eliminate it.
27-2d The Trade-off between Risk and Return
One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people face trade-offs. 
The trade-off that is most relevant for understanding financial decisions is the 
trade-off between risk and return. 
As we have seen, there are risks inherent in holding stocks, even in a diversified 
portfolio. But risk-averse people are willing to accept this uncertainty because 
they are compensated for doing so. Historically, stocks have offered much higher 
firm-specific risk
risk that affects only a 
single company
market risk
risk that affects all 
companies in the stock 
market
FIGURE 2
Diversification Reduces Risk
This figure shows how the risk of a 
portfolio, measured here with a statistic 
called the standard deviation, depends 
on the number of stocks in the portfolio. 
The investor is assumed to put an equal 
percentage of her portfolio in each of the 
stocks. Increasing the number of stocks 
reduces, but does not eliminate, the 
amount of risk in a stock portfolio.

rates of return than alternative financial assets, such as bonds and bank savings 
accounts. Over the past two centuries, stocks offered an average real return of 
about 8 percent per year, while short-term government bonds paid a real return of 
only 3 percent per year.
When deciding how to allocate their savings, people have to decide how much 
risk they are willing to undertake to earn a higher return. For example, consider a 
person choosing how to allocate her portfolio between two asset classes: 
• The first asset class is a diversified group of risky stocks, with an average 
return of 8 percent and a standard deviation of 20 percent. (You may recall 
from a math or statistics class that a normal random variable stays within 2 
standard deviations of its average about 95 percent of the time. Thus, while 
actual returns are centered around 8 percent, they typically vary from a gain 
of 48 percent to a loss of 32 percent.) 
• The second asset class is a safe alternative, with a return of 3 percent and a 
standard deviation of zero. The safe alternative can be either a bank savings 
account or a government bond.
Figure 3 illustrates the trade-off between risk and return. Each point in this figure 
represents a particular allocation of a portfolio between risky stocks and the safe 
asset. The figure shows that the more the individual puts into stocks, the greater 
both the risk and the return are.
Acknowledging the risk-return trade-off does not, by itself, tell us what a 
person should do. The choice of a particular combination of risk and return 
depends on a person’s risk aversion, which reflects her own preferences. But it is 
important for stockholders to recognize that the higher average return that they 
enjoy comes at the price of higher risk.

CHAPTER 27   THE BASIC TOOLS OF FINANCE
27-3 Asset Valuation 
Now that we have developed a basic understanding of the two building blocks 
of finance—time and risk—let’s apply this knowledge. This section considers 
a simple question: What determines the price of a share of stock? As with most 
prices, the answer is supply and demand. But that is not the end of the story. To 
understand stock prices, we need to think more deeply about what determines a 
person’s willingness to pay for a share of stock. 
27-3a Fundamental Analysis
Let’s imagine that you have decided to put 60 percent of your savings into stock, 
and to achieve diversification, you have decided to buy twenty different stocks. If 
you open up the newspaper, you will find thousands of stocks listed. How should 
you pick the twenty for your portfolio? 
When you buy stock, you are buying shares in a business. To decide which 
businesses you want to own, it is natural to consider two things: the value of that 
share of the business and the price at which the shares are being sold. If the price 
is less than the value, the stock is said to be undervalued. If the price is more than 
the value, the stock is said to be overvalued. If the price and the value are equal, the 
stock is said to be fairly valued. When choosing twenty stocks for your portfolio, 
you should prefer undervalued stocks. In these cases, you are getting a bargain by 
paying less than the business is worth.
This is easier said than done. Learning the price is easy: You can just look it up. 
Determining the value of the business is the hard part. The term fundamental 
analysis refers to the detailed analysis of a company to estimate its value. Many 
Wall Street firms hire stock analysts to conduct such fundamental analysis and 
offer advice about which stocks to buy.
The value of a stock to a stockholder is what she gets out of owning it, which 
includes the present value of the stream of dividend payments and the final sale 
price. Recall that dividends are the cash payments that a company makes to its 
shareholders. A company’s ability to pay dividends, as well as the value of the 
stock when the stockholder sells her shares, depends on the company’s ability 
to earn profits. Its profitability, in turn, depends on a large number of factors: the 
demand for its product, how much competition it faces, how much capital it has in 
place, whether its workers are unionized, how loyal its customers are, what kinds 
of government regulations and taxes it faces, and so on. The goal of fundamental 
analysis is to take all these factors into account to determine how much a share of 
stock in the company is worth.
If you want to rely on fundamental analysis to pick a stock portfolio, there are 
three ways to do it. One way is to do all the necessary research yourself, such as by 
reading through companies’ annual reports. A second way is to rely on the advice 
of Wall Street analysts. A third way is to buy shares in a mutual fund, which has 
a manager who conducts fundamental analysis and makes the decision for you.
27-3b The Efficient Markets Hypothesis
There is another way to choose twenty stocks for your portfolio: Pick them 
randomly by, for instance, putting the stock pages on your bulletin board and 
throwing darts at them. This may sound crazy, but there is reason to believe 
that it won’t lead you too far astray. That reason is called the efficient markets 
hypothesis.
fundamental analysis
the study of a company’s 
accounting statements 
and future prospects to 
determine its value
efficient markets 
hypothesis
the theory that asset 
prices reflect all publicly 
available information 
about the value of an 
asset

572
PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
To understand this theory, the starting point is to acknowledge that each company 
listed on a major stock exchange is followed closely by many money managers, 
such as the individuals who run mutual funds. Every day, these managers monitor 
news stories and conduct fundamental analysis to try to determine the stock’s 
value. Their job is to buy a stock when its price falls below its fundamental value 
and to sell it when its price rises above its fundamental value.
The second piece to the efficient markets hypothesis is that the equilibrium of 
supply and demand sets the market price. This means that, at the market price, 
the number of shares being offered for sale exactly equals the number of shares 
that people want to buy. In other words, at the market price, the number of people 
who think the stock is overvalued exactly balances the number of people who 
think it’s undervalued. As judged by the typical person in the market, all stocks 
are fairly valued all the time.
According to this theory, the stock market exhibits informational efficiency: It 
reflects all available information about the value of the asset. Stock prices change 
when information changes. When good news about the company’s prospects 
becomes public, the value and the stock price both rise. When the company’s 
prospects deteriorate, the value and price both fall. But at any moment in time, the 
market price is the best guess of the company’s value based on available information.
One implication of the efficient markets hypothesis is that stock prices should 
follow a random walk. This means that changes in stock prices are impossible to 
predict from available information. If, based on publicly available information, a 
person could predict that a stock price would rise by 10 percent tomorrow, then 
the stock market must be failing to incorporate that information today. According 
to this theory, the only thing that can move stock prices is news that changes the 
market’s perception of the company’s value. But news must be unpredictable—
otherwise, it wouldn’t really be news. For the same reason, changes in stock prices 
should be unpredictable. 
If the efficient markets hypothesis is correct, then there is little point in spending 
many hours studying the business page to decide which twenty stocks to add to 
your portfolio. If prices reflect all available information, no stock is a better buy 
than any other. The best you can do is to buy a diversified portfolio.

RANDOM WALKS AND INDEX FUNDS
The efficient markets hypothesis is a theory about how financial 
markets work. The theory may not be completely true: As we discuss 
in the next section, there is reason to doubt that stockholders are 
always rational and that stock prices are informationally efficient at 
every moment. Nonetheless, the efficient markets hypothesis does much better as 
a description of the world than you might expect.

CHAPTER 27   THE BASIC TOOLS OF FINANCE
There is much evidence that stock prices, even if not exactly 
a random walk, are very close to it. For example, you might 
be tempted to buy stocks that have recently risen and avoid 
stocks that have recently fallen (or perhaps just the opposite). 
But statistical studies have shown that following such trends (or 
bucking them) fails to outperform the market. The correlation 
between how well a stock does one year and how well it does 
the following year is about zero.
Some of the best evidence in favor of the efficient markets 
hypothesis comes from the performance of index funds. 
An index fund is a mutual fund that buys all the stocks in 
a given stock index. The performance of these funds can be 
compared with that of actively managed mutual funds, where a 
professional portfolio manager picks stocks based on extensive 
research and alleged expertise. In essence, an index fund buys 
all stocks, whereas active funds are supposed to buy only the 
best stocks.
In practice, active managers usually fail to beat index funds. For 
example, in the 15-year period ending February 2016, 81 percent of 
stock mutual funds performed worse than a broadly based index 
fund holding all stocks traded on U.S. stock exchanges. Over this 
period, the average annual return on stock funds fell short of the 
return on the index fund by 0.89 percentage points. Most active 
portfolio managers failed to beat the market because they trade more frequently, 
incurring more trading costs, and because they charge greater fees as compensation for 
their alleged expertise.
What about the 19 percent of managers who did beat the market? Perhaps they 
are smarter than average, or perhaps they were luckier. If you have 5,000 people 
flipping coins ten times, on average about 5 will flip ten heads; these 5 might claim 
an exceptional coin-flipping skill, but they would have trouble replicating the feat. 
Similarly, studies have shown that mutual fund managers with a history of superior 
performance usually fail to maintain it in subsequent periods.
The efficient markets hypothesis says that it is impossible to beat the market. 
The accumulation of many studies of financial markets confirms that beating the 
market is, at best, extremely difficult. Even if the efficient markets hypothesis is not 
an exact description of the world, it contains a large element of truth. ●
27-3c Market Irrationality 
The efficient markets hypothesis assumes that people buying and selling stock 
rationally process the information they have about the stock’s underlying value. 
But is the stock market really that rational? Or do stock prices sometimes deviate 
from reasonable expectations of their true value?
There is a long tradition suggesting that fluctuations in stock prices are partly 
psychological. In the 1930s, economist John Maynard Keynes suggested that asset 
markets are driven by the “animal spirits” of investors—irrational waves of optimism 
and pessimism. In the 1990s, as the stock market soared to new heights, Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan questioned whether the boom reflected “irrational exuberance.” Stock 
prices did subsequently fall, but whether the exuberance of the 1990s was irrational 
given the information available at the time remains debatable. Whenever the price of 
an asset rises above what appears to be its fundamental value, the market is said to be 
experiencing a speculative bubble.
“In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor 
can expect to do better by choosing a well-diversified, low-cost 
index fund than by picking a few stocks.”

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
The possibility of speculative bubbles in the stock market arises in part because 
the value of the stock to a stockholder depends not only on the stream of dividend 
payments but also on the final sale price. Thus, a person might be willing to pay 
more than a stock is worth today if she expects another person to pay even more for 
it tomorrow. When evaluating a stock, you have to estimate not only the value of the 
business but also what other people will think the business is worth in the future.
There is much debate among economists about the frequency and importance 
of departures from rational pricing. Believers in market irrationality point out 
(correctly) that the stock market often moves in ways that are hard to explain on 
the basis of news that might alter a rational valuation. Believers in the efficient 
markets hypothesis point out (correctly) that it is impossible to know the correct, 
rational valuation of a company, so one should not quickly jump to the conclusion 
that any particular valuation is irrational. Moreover, if the market were irrational, 
a rational person should be able to take advantage of this fact; yet as the previous 
case study discussed, beating the market is nearly impossible.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
27-4 Conclusion
This chapter has developed some of the basic tools that people should (and often do) 
use as they make financial decisions. The concept of present value reminds us that a 
dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and it gives us a way to compare 
sums of money at different points in time. The theory of risk management reminds us 
that the future is uncertain and that risk-averse people can take precautions to guard 
against this uncertainty. The study of asset valuation tells us that the stock price of any 
company should reflect its expected future profitability.
Although most of the tools of finance are well established, there is more 
controversy about the validity of the efficient markets hypothesis and whether 
stock prices are, in practice, rational estimates of a company’s true worth. Rational 
or not, the large movements in stock prices that we observe have important 
macroeconomic implications. Stock market fluctuations often go hand in hand 
with fluctuations in the economy more broadly. We revisit the stock market when 
we study economic fluctuations later in the book.

CHAPTER 27   THE BASIC TOOLS OF FINANCE
5. The benefit of diversification when constructing a 
portfolio is that it can eliminate
a. speculative bubbles.
b. risk aversion.
c. firm-specific risk.
d. market risk.
6. According to the efficient markets hypothesis, 
a. changes in stock prices are impossible to predict 
from public information.
b. excessive diversification can reduce an investor’s 
expected portfolio returns.
c. the stock market moves based on the changing 
animal spirits of investors.
d. actively managed mutual funds should give higher 
returns than index funds.
• Because savings can earn interest, a sum of money 
today is more valuable than the same sum of money in 
the future. A person can compare sums from different 
times using the concept of present value. The present 
value of any future sum is the amount that would 
be needed today, given prevailing interest rates, to 
produce that future sum.
• Because of diminishing marginal utility, most people 
are risk averse. Risk-averse people can reduce risk by 
buying insurance, diversifying their holdings, and 
choosing a portfolio with lower risk and lower return. 
• The value of an asset equals the present value of 
the cash flows the owner will receive. For a share 
of stock, these cash flows include the stream of 
dividends and the final sale price. According to the 
efficient markets hypothesis, financial markets process 
available information rationally, so a stock price 
always equals the best estimate of the value of the 
underlying business. Some economists question the 
efficient markets hypothesis, however, and believe that 
irrational psychological factors also influence asset 
prices.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
1. According to an old myth, Native Americans sold the 
island of Manhattan about 400 years ago for $24. If 
they had invested this amount at an interest rate of  
7 percent per year, how much, approximately, would 
they have today?
2. A company has an investment project that would cost 
$10 million today and yield a payoff of $15 million in 
4 years.
a. Should the firm undertake the project if the 
interest rate is 11 percent? 10 percent? 9 percent?  
8 percent? 
b. Can you figure out the exact cutoff for the interest 
rate between profitability and nonprofitability?
3. Bond A pays $8,000 in 20 years. Bond B pays $8,000 
in 40 years. (To keep things simple, assume these are 
zero-coupon bonds, which means the $8,000 is the 
only payment the bondholder receives.)
a. If the interest rate is 3.5 percent, what is the value 
of each bond today? Which bond is worth more? 
Why? (Hint: You can use a calculator, but the rule 
of 70 should make the calculation easy.)
b. If the interest rate increases to 7 percent, what is 
the value of each bond? Which bond has a larger 
percentage change in value?
c. Based on the example above, complete the two 
blanks in this sentence: “The value of a bond 
[rises/falls] when the interest rate increases, and 
bonds with a longer time to maturity are  
[more/less] sensitive to changes in the interest rate.”
4. Your bank account pays an interest rate of 8 percent. 
You are considering buying a share of stock in XYZ 
Corporation for $110. After 1, 2, and 3 years, it will 
pay a dividend of $5. You expect to sell the stock after 
3 years for $120. Is XYZ a good investment? Support 
your answer with calculations.
5. For each of the following kinds of insurance, give an 
example of behavior that can be called moral hazard 
and another example of behavior that can be called 
adverse selection.
a. health insurance
b. car insurance
c. life insurance
6. Which kind of stock would you expect to pay the 
higher average return: stock in an industry that is 
very sensitive to economic conditions (such as an 
automaker) or stock in an industry that is relatively 
insensitive to economic conditions (such as a water 
company)? Why?
7. A company faces two kinds of risk. A firm-specific 
risk is that a competitor might enter its market and 
take some of its customers. A market risk is that the 
economy might enter a recession, reducing sales. 
Which of these two risks would more likely cause the 
company’s shareholders to demand a higher return? 
Why?
8. When company executives buy and sell stock based 
on private information they obtain as part of their 
jobs, they are engaged in insider trading.
a. Give an example of inside information that might 
be useful for buying or selling stock.
b. Those who trade stocks based on inside 
information usually earn very high rates of 
return. Does this fact violate the efficient markets 
hypothesis?
c. Insider trading is illegal. Why do you suppose 
that is?
9. Jamal has a utility function U 5 W1/2, where W is his 
wealth in millions of dollars and U is the utility he 
obtains from that wealth. In the final stage of a game 
show, the host offers Jamal a choice between (A) $4 
million for sure, or (B) a gamble that pays $1 million 
with probability 0.6 and $9 million with probability 0.4. 
a. Graph Jamal’s utility function. Is he risk averse? 
Explain.
b. Does A or B offer Jamal a higher expected 
prize? Explain your reasoning with appropriate 
calculations. (Hint: The expected value of a 
random variable is the weighted average of the 
possible outcomes, where the probabilities are the 
weights.)
c. Does A or B offer Jamal a higher expected utility? 
Again, show your calculations.
d. Should Jamal pick A or B? Why?

osing a job can be the most distressing economic event in a person’s life. Most 
people rely on their labor earnings to maintain their standard of living, and 
many people also get a sense of personal accomplishment from working. A job 
loss means a lower living standard in the present, anxiety about the future, and 
reduced self-esteem. It is not surprising, therefore, that politicians campaigning 
for office often speak about how their proposed policies will help create jobs.
In previous chapters, we have seen some of the forces that determine the level 
and growth of a country’s standard of living. A country that saves and invests a 
high fraction of its income, for instance, enjoys more rapid growth in its cap-
ital stock and GDP than a similar country that saves and  invests 
less. An even more obvious determinant of a country’s

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
standard of living is the amount of unemployment it typically experiences. People 
who would like to work but cannot find a job are not contributing to the econo-
my’s production of goods and services. Although some degree of unemployment 
is inevitable in a complex economy with thousands of firms and millions of work-
ers, the amount of unemployment varies substantially over time and across coun-
tries. When a country keeps its workers as fully employed as possible, it achieves 
a higher level of GDP than it would if it left many of its workers idle.
This chapter begins our study of unemployment. The problem of unemploy-
ment can be divided into two categories: the long-run problem and the short-
run problem. The economy’s natural rate of unemployment refers to the amount of 
unemployment that the economy normally experiences. Cyclical unemployment
refers to the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate, 
and it is closely associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity. 
Cyclical unemployment has its own explanation, which we defer until we study 
short-run economic fluctuations later in this book. In this chapter, we discuss the 
determinants of an economy’s natural rate of unemployment. As we will see, the 
designation natural does not imply that this rate of unemployment is desirable. 
Nor does it imply that it is constant over time or impervious to economic policy.  
It just means that this unemployment does not go away on its own even in the 
long run.
We begin the chapter by looking at some of the relevant facts that describe 
 unemployment. In particular, we examine three questions: How does the gov-
ernment measure the economy’s rate of unemployment? What problems arise in 
interpreting the unemployment data? How long are the unemployed typically 
without work?
We then turn to the reasons economies always experience some unemploy-
ment and the ways in which policymakers can help the unemployed. We discuss 
four explanations for the economy’s natural rate of unemployment: job search, 
 minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages. As we will see, long-run 
 unemployment does not arise from a single problem that has a single solution. 
Instead, it reflects a variety of related problems. As a result, there is no easy way 
for policymakers to reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment and, at 
the same time, to alleviate the hardships experienced by the unemployed.
28-1 Identifying Unemployment
Let’s start by examining more precisely what the term unemployment means. 
28-1a How Is Unemployment Measured?
Measuring unemployment is the job of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 
which is part of the Department of Labor. Every month, the BLS produces data on 
unemployment and on other aspects of the labor market, including types of em-
ployment, length of the average workweek, and the duration of unemployment. 
These data come from a regular survey of about 60,000 households, called the 
Current Population Survey.
Based on the answers to survey questions, the BLS places each adult (age 16 
and older) in each surveyed household into one of three categories: 
r Employed: This category includes those who worked as paid employees, 
worked in their own business, or worked as unpaid workers in a family

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
member’s business. Both full-time and part-time workers are counted. This 
category also includes those who were not working but who had jobs from 
which they were temporarily absent because of, for example, vacation,  
illness, or bad weather.
r Unemployed: This category includes those who were not employed, were 
available for work, and had tried to find employment during the previous 
four weeks. It also includes those waiting to be recalled to a job from which 
they had been laid off.
r Not in the labor force: This category includes those who fit neither of the first 
two categories, such as full-time students, homemakers, and retirees.
Figure 1 shows the breakdown into these categories for January 2016.
Once the BLS has placed all the individuals covered by the survey in a cate-
gory, it computes various statistics to summarize the state of the labor market. 
The BLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed: 
Labor force 5 Number of employed 1 Number of unemployed.
The BLS defines the unemployment rate as the percentage of the labor force that 
is unemployed:
Unemployment rate 5
Number of unemployed
Labor force
3 100.
The BLS computes unemployment rates for the entire adult population and for 
specific groups defined by race, gender, and so on.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
The BLS uses the same survey to produce data on labor-force participation. The 
labor-force participation rate measures the percentage of the total adult popula-
tion of the United States that is in the labor force:
Labor-force participation rate 5
Labor force
Adult population 3 100.
This statistic tells us the fraction of the population that has chosen to participate 
in the labor market. The labor-force participation rate, like the unemployment 
rate, is computed for both the entire adult population and more specific groups.
To see how these data are computed, consider the figures for January 2016. At 
that time, 150.5 million people were employed, and 7.8 million people were un-
employed. The labor force was
Labor force 5 150.5 1 7.8 5 158.3 million.
The unemployment rate was
Unemployment rate 5 (7.8/158.3) 3 100 5 4.9 percent.
Because the adult population was 252.4 million, the labor-force participation rate 
was
Labor-force participation rate 5 (158.3/252.4) 3 100 5 62.7 percent.
Hence, in January 2016, almost two-thirds of the U.S. adult population were par-
ticipating in the labor market, and 4.9 percent of those labor-market participants 
were without work.
Table 1 shows the statistics on unemployment and labor-force participation for 
various groups within the U.S. population. Three comparisons are most appar-
ent. First, women of prime working age (25 to 54 years old) have lower rates of 
labor-force participation than men, but once in the labor force, men and women 
have similar rates of unemployment. Second, prime-age blacks have similar rates 
of labor-force participation as prime-age whites, but they have much higher rates

of unemployment. Third, teenagers have much lower rates of labor-force partic-
ipation and much higher rates of unemployment than older workers. More gen-
erally, these data show that labor-market experiences vary widely among groups 
within the economy.
The BLS data on the labor market also allow economists and policymakers to 
monitor changes in the economy over time. Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate 
in the United States since 1960. The figure shows that the economy always has some 
unemployment and that the amount changes from year to year. The normal rate 
of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates is called the 
natural rate of unemployment, and the deviation of unemployment from its natu-
ral rate is called cyclical unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment shown 
in the figure is a series estimated by economists at the Congressional Budget Office. 
For 2015, they estimated a natural rate of 4.9 percent, close to the actual unemploy-
ment rate of 5.3 percent. Later in this book, we discuss short-run economic fluctua-
tions, including the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural 
rate. In the rest of this chapter, however, we ignore the short-run fluctuations and 
examine why there is always some unemployment in market economies.

LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE U.S.

Women’s role in American society has changed dramatically over the 
past century. Social commentators have pointed to many causes for 
this change. In part, it is attributable to new technologies, such as the 
washing machine, clothes dryer, refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher, which have 
reduced the amount of time required to complete routine household tasks. In part, it

is attributable to improved birth control, which has reduced the number of children 
born to the typical family. This change in women’s role is also partly attributable to 
changing political and social attitudes, which in turn may have been facilitated by 
the advances in technology and birth control. Together these developments have 
had a profound impact on society in general and on the economy in particular.
Nowhere is that impact more obvious than in data on labor-force participation. 
Figure 3 shows the labor-force participation rates of men and women in the United 
States since 1950. Just after World War II, men and women had very different roles 
in society. Only 33 percent of women were working or looking for work, in contrast 
to 87 percent of men. Since then, this difference in participation rates has gradually 
diminished, as growing numbers of women have entered the labor force and some 
men have left it. Data for 2015 show that 57 percent of women were in the labor 
force, in contrast to 69 percent of men. As measured by labor-force participation, 
men and women are now playing a more equal role in the economy.
The increase in women’s labor-force participation is easy to understand, but the 
fall in men’s may seem puzzling. There are several reasons for this decline. First, 
young men now stay in school longer than their fathers and grandfathers did. 
Second, older men now retire earlier and live longer. Third, with more women 
employed, more fathers now stay at home to raise their children. Full-time students, 
retirees, and stay-at-home dads are all counted as being out of the labor force. ●
28-1b Does the Unemployment Rate Measure What We Want It To?
Measuring the amount of unemployment in the economy might seem a straight-
forward task, but it is not. While it is easy to distinguish between a person with a 
full-time job and a person who is not working at all, it is much harder to distinguish 
between a person who is unemployed and a person who is not in the labor force.

force. It shows that, over the past 60 years, women have entered the labor force and men

Note: The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines terms as follows: 
t Marginally attached workers are persons who currently are neither working nor looking 
for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work 
sometime in the recent past. 
t Discouraged workers are marginally attached workers who have given a job-market-
related reason for not currently looking for a job. 
t Persons employed part-time for economic reasons are those who want and are available 
for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.
Movements into and out of the labor force are, in fact, common. More than 
one-third of the unemployed are recent entrants into the labor force. These 
entrants include young workers looking for their first jobs. They also include, in 
greater numbers, older workers who had previously left the labor force but have 
now returned to look for work. Moreover, not all unemployment ends with the 
job seeker finding a job. Almost half of all spells of unemployment end when the 
unemployed person leaves the labor force.
Because people move into and out of the labor force so often, statistics on 
unemployment are difficult to interpret. On the one hand, some of those who 
report being unemployed may not, in fact, be trying hard to find a job. They may 
be calling themselves unemployed because they want to qualify for a government 
program that gives financial assistance to the unemployed or because they are 
working but paid “under the table” to avoid taxes on their earnings. It may be 
more accurate to view these individuals as out of the labor force or, in some 
cases, employed. On the other hand, some of those who report being out of the 
labor force may want to work. These individuals may have tried to find a job 
and may have given up after an unsuccessful search. Such individuals, called 
discouraged workers, do not show up in unemployment statistics, even though 
they are truly workers without jobs. 
Because of these and other problems, the BLS calculates several other measures 
of labor underutilization, in addition to the official unemployment rate. These 
alternative measures are presented in Table 2. In the end, it is best to view the offi-
cial unemployment rate as a useful but imperfect measure of joblessness.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
28-1c How Long Are the Unemployed without Work?
In judging how serious the problem of unemployment is, one question to con-
sider is whether unemployment is typically a short-term or long-term condition. 
If unemployment is short-term, one might conclude that it is not a big problem. 
Workers may require a few weeks between jobs to find the openings that best suit 
their tastes and skills. Yet if unemployment is long-term, one might conclude that 
it is a serious problem. Workers unemployed for many months are more likely to 
suffer economic and psychological hardship. 
Because the duration of unemployment can affect our view about how big a 
problem unemployment is, economists have devoted much energy to studying 
data on the duration of unemployment spells. In this work, they have uncov-
ered a result that is important, subtle, and seemingly contradictory: Most spells of 
unemployment are short, but most unemployment observed at any given time is  
long-term.
To see how this statement can be true, consider an example. Suppose that you 
visited the government’s unemployment office every week for a year to survey 
the unemployed. Each week you find that there are four unemployed workers. 
Three of these workers are the same individuals for the whole year, while the 
fourth person changes every week. Based on this experience, would you say that 
unemployment is typically short-term or long-term?
Some simple calculations help answer this question. In this example, you meet 
a total of 55 unemployed people over the course of a year; 52 of them are unem-
ployed for one week, and 3 are unemployed for the full year. This means that 
52/55, or 95 percent, of unemployment spells end in one week. Yet whenever 
you walk into the unemployment office, three of the four people you meet will be  
unemployed for the entire year. So, even though 95 percent of unemployment 
spells end in one week, 75 percent of the unemployment observed at any moment 
is attributable to those individuals who are unemployed for a full year. In this 
example, as in the world, most spells of unemployment are short, but most unem-
ployment observed at any given time is long-term.
This subtle conclusion implies that economists and policymakers must be care-
ful when interpreting data on unemployment and when designing policies to 
help the unemployed. Most people who become unemployed will soon find jobs. 
Yet most of the economy’s unemployment problem is attributable to the relatively 
few workers who are jobless for long periods of time.
28-1d Why Are There Always Some People Unemployed?
We have discussed how the government measures the amount of unemployment, 
the problems that arise in interpreting unemployment statistics, and the findings 
of labor economists on the duration of unemployment. You should now have a 
good idea about what unemployment is.
This discussion, however, has not explained why economies experience unem-
ployment. In most markets in the economy, prices adjust to bring quantity supplied 
and quantity demanded into balance. In an ideal labor market, wages would adjust 
to balance the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor demanded. This 
adjustment of wages would ensure that all workers are always fully employed.
Of course, reality does not resemble this ideal. There are always some workers 
without jobs, even when the overall economy is doing well. In other words, the 
unemployment rate never falls to zero; instead, it fluctuates around the natural

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
The Jobs Number
W
hen the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces the unemployment 
rate at the beginning of every month, it also announces the num-
ber of jobs the economy has gained or lost. As an indicator of short-run 
economic trends, the jobs number gets as much attention as the unem-
ployment rate.
Where does the jobs number come from? You might guess that 
it comes from the same survey of 60,000 households that yields the  
unemployment rate. And indeed the household survey does produce data 
on total employment. The jobs number that gets the most attention, how-
ever, comes from a separate survey of 160,000 business establishments, 
which have over 40 million workers on their payrolls. The results from 
the establishment survey are announced at the same time as the results 
from the household survey.
Both surveys yield information about total employment, but the  
results are not always the same. One reason is that the establishment 
survey has a larger sample, which makes it more reliable. Another 
reason is that the surveys 
are not measuring exactly 
the same thing. For exam-
ple, a person who has two 
part-time jobs at different 
companies would be counted 
as one employed person in the house-
hold survey but as two jobs in the establishment survey. As another 
example, a person running his own small business would be counted 
as employed in the household survey but would not show up at all in 
the establishment survey, because the establishment survey counts only 
employees on business payrolls.
The establishment survey is closely watched for its data on jobs, but 
it says nothing about unemployment. To measure the number of unem-
ployed, we need to know how many people without jobs are trying to find 
them. The household survey is the only source of that information. ■

d
rate of unemployment. To understand this natural rate, the remaining sections of 
this chapter examine the reasons actual labor markets depart from the ideal of full 
employment.
To preview our conclusions, we will find that there are four ways to explain 
unemployment in the long run. The first explanation is that it takes time for 
workers to search for the jobs that are best suited for them. The unemployment 
that results from the process of matching workers and jobs is sometimes called 
frictional unemployment, and it is often thought to explain relatively short spells 
of unemployment.
The next three explanations for unemployment suggest that the number of 
jobs available in some labor markets may be insufficient to give a job to every-
one who wants one. This occurs when the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the 
quantity demanded. Unemployment of this sort is sometimes called structural 
unemployment, and it is often thought to explain longer spells of unemployment. 
As we will see, this kind of unemployment results when wages are set above the 
level that brings supply and demand into equilibrium. We will examine three pos-
sible reasons for an above-equilibrium wage: minimum-wage laws, unions, and 
efficiency wages.

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
28-2 Job Search 
One reason economies always experience some unemployment is job search. Job 
search is the process of matching workers with appropriate jobs. If all workers 
and all jobs were the same, so that all workers were equally well suited for all 
jobs, job search would not be a problem. Laid-off workers would quickly find new 
jobs that were well suited for them. But in fact, workers differ in their tastes and 
skills, jobs differ in their attributes, and information about job candidates and job 
vacancies is disseminated slowly among the many firms and households in the 
economy. 
28-2a Why Some Frictional Unemployment Is Inevitable
Frictional unemployment is often the result of changes in the demand for labor 
among different firms. When consumers decide that they prefer Ford to General 
Motors cars, Ford increases employment and General Motors lays off workers. 
The former General Motors workers must now search for new jobs, and Ford 
must decide which new workers to hire for the various jobs that have opened up. 
The result of this transition is a period of unemployment.
Similarly, because different regions of the country produce different goods, 
employment can rise in one region while it falls in another. Consider, for 
instance, what happens when the world price of oil falls. Oil-producing firms in 
Texas and North Dakota respond to the lower price by cutting back on produc-
tion and employment. At the same time, cheaper gasoline stimulates car sales, so 
auto-producing firms in Michigan and Ohio raise production and employment. 
The opposite happens when the world price of oil rises. Changes in the compo-
sition of demand among industries or regions are called sectoral shifts. Because it 
takes time for workers to search for jobs in the new sectors, sectoral shifts tempo-
rarily cause unemployment.
Changing patterns of international trade are also a source of frictional unem-
ployment. In Chapter 3, we learned that nations export goods for which they have 
a comparative advantage and import goods for which other nations have a com-
parative advantage. Comparative advantage, however, need not be stable over 
time. As the world economy evolves, nations may find themselves importing and 
exporting different goods than they have in the past. Workers will therefore need 
to move among industries. As they make this transition, they may find them-
selves unemployed for a period of time. 
Frictional unemployment is inevitable simply because the economy is always 
changing. For example, in the U.S. economy from 2004 to 2014, employment fell by 
838,000 in construction and 2.1 million in manufacturing.  During the same period, 
employment rose by 321,000 in mining, 629,000 in computer systems design, 1.9 
million in food services, and 2.6 million in healthcare. This churning of the labor 
force is normal in a well-functioning and dynamic economy. Because workers tend 
to move toward those industries in which they are most valuable, the long-run 
result of the process is higher productivity and higher living standards. But along 
the way, workers in declining industries find themselves out of work and search-
ing for new jobs. The result is some amount of frictional unemployment.
28-2b Public Policy and Job Search
Even if some frictional unemployment is inevitable, the precise amount is not. The 
faster information spreads about job openings and worker availability, the more 
rapidly the economy can match workers and firms. The Internet, for instance, may 
job search
the process by which 
workers find appropriate 
jobs given their tastes 
and skills

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
help facilitate job search and reduce frictional unemployment. In addition, public 
policy may play a role. If policy can reduce the time it takes unemployed workers 
to find new jobs, it can reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment.
Government programs try to facilitate job search in various ways. One way 
is through government-run employment agencies, which give out information 
about job vacancies. Another way is through public training programs, which 
aim to ease workers’ transition from declining to growing industries and to help 
disadvantaged groups escape poverty. Advocates of these programs believe that 
they make the economy operate more efficiently by keeping the labor force more 
fully employed and that they reduce the inequities inherent in a constantly chang-
ing market economy.
Critics of these programs question whether the government should get  
involved with the process of job search. They argue that it is better to let the pri-
vate market match workers and jobs. In fact, most job search in our economy takes 
place without intervention by the government. Newspaper ads, online job sites, 
college career offices, headhunters, and word of mouth all help spread informa-
tion about job openings and job candidates. Similarly, much worker education is 
done privately, either through schools or through on-the-job training. These critics 
contend that the government is no better—and most likely worse—at disseminat-
ing the right information to the right workers and deciding what kinds of worker 
training would be most valuable. They claim that these decisions are best made 
privately by workers and employers. 
28-2c Unemployment Insurance
One government program that increases the amount of frictional unemploy-
ment, without intending to do so, is unemployment insurance. This program is  
designed to offer workers partial protection against job loss. The unemployed 
who quit their jobs, were fired for cause, or just entered the labor force are not 
eligible. Benefits are paid only to the unemployed who were laid off because their 
previous employers no longer needed their skills. The terms of the program vary 
over time and across states, but a typical worker covered by unemployment in-
surance in the United States receives 50 percent of his former wages for 26 weeks. 
While unemployment insurance reduces the hardship of unemployment, it 
also increases the amount of unemployment. The explanation is based on one of 
the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. Because 
unemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed 
devote less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive 
job offers. In addition, because unemployment insurance makes unemployment 
less onerous, workers are less likely to seek guarantees of job security when they 
negotiate with employers over the terms of employment.
Many studies by labor economists have analyzed the incentive effects of unem-
ployment insurance. One study examined an experiment run by the state of Illinois 
in 1985. When unemployed workers applied to collect unemployment insurance 
benefits, the state randomly selected some of them and offered each a $500 bonus if 
they found new jobs within 11 weeks. This group was then compared to a control 
group not offered the incentive. The average spell of unemployment for the group 
offered the bonus was 7 percent shorter than the average spell for the control group. 
This experiment shows that the design of the unemployment insurance system 
influences the effort that the unemployed devote to job search.
Several other studies examined search effort by following a group of workers 
over time. Unemployment insurance benefits, rather than lasting forever, usually

that partially protects 
workers’ incomes when 
they become unemployed

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
run out after 6 months or 1 year. These studies found that when the unemployed 
become ineligible for benefits, the probability of their finding a new job rises 
markedly. Thus, receiving unemployment insurance benefits does reduce the 
search effort of the unemployed.
Even though unemployment insurance reduces search effort and raises unem-
ployment, we should not necessarily conclude that the policy is bad. The program 
does achieve its primary goal of reducing the income uncertainty that workers 
face. In addition, when workers turn down unattractive job offers, they have the 
opportunity to look for jobs that better suit their tastes and skills. Some econo-
mists argue that unemployment insurance improves the ability of the economy to 
match each worker with the most appropriate job.
The study of unemployment insurance shows that the unemployment rate is 
an imperfect measure of a nation’s overall level of economic well-being. Most 
economists agree that eliminating unemployment insurance would reduce the 
amount of unemployment in the economy. Yet economists disagree on whether 
economic well-being would be enhanced or diminished by this change in policy.

frictional unemployment? Is this unemployment undesirable? What public 
policies might affect the amount of unemployment caused by this price change?
28-3 Minimum-Wage Laws
Having seen how frictional unemployment results from the process of matching 
workers and jobs, let’s now examine how structural unemployment results when 
the number of jobs is insufficient for the number of workers. 
To understand structural unemployment, we begin by reviewing how  
minimum-wage laws can cause unemployment. Minimum wages are not the pre-
dominant reason for unemployment in our economy, but they have an important 
effect on certain groups with particularly high unemployment rates. Moreover, the 
analysis of minimum wages is a natural place to start because, as we will see, it can 
be used to understand some of the other reasons for structural unemployment.
Figure 4 reviews the basic economics of a minimum wage. When a mini-
mum-wage law forces the wage to remain above the level that balances supply 
and demand, it raises the quantity of labor supplied and reduces the quantity of 
labor demanded compared to the equilibrium level. There is a surplus of labor. 
Because there are more workers willing to work than there are jobs, some workers 
are unemployed.
While minimum-wage laws are one reason unemployment exists in the U.S. 
economy, they do not affect everyone. The vast majority of workers have wages 
well above the legal minimum, so the law does not prevent most wages from 
adjusting to balance supply and demand. Minimum-wage laws matter most for 
the least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force, such as teenag-
ers. Their equilibrium wages tend to be low and, therefore, are more likely to fall 
below the legal minimum. It is only among these workers that minimum-wage 
laws explain the existence of unemployment.
Figure 4 is drawn to show the effects of a minimum-wage law, but it also 
illustrates a more general lesson: If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any 
reason, the result is unemployment. Minimum-wage laws are just one reason wages

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
may be “too high.” In the remaining two sections of this chapter, we consider two 
other reasons wages may be kept above the equilibrium level: unions and effi-
ciency wages. The basic economics of unemployment in these cases is the same 
as that shown in Figure 4, but these explanations of unemployment can apply to 
many more of the economy’s workers.
At this point, however, we should stop and notice that the structural unem-
ployment that arises from an above-equilibrium wage is, in an important sense, 
different from the frictional unemployment that arises from the process of job 
search. The need for job search is not due to the failure of wages to balance labor 
supply and labor demand. When job search is the explanation for unemployment, 
workers are searching for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills. By contrast, 
when the wage is above the equilibrium level, the quantity of labor supplied 
exceeds the quantity of labor demanded, and workers are unemployed because 
they are waiting for jobs to open up.

In this labor market, supply and demand

equilibrium wage, the quantity of labor 
supplied and the quantity of labor  
demanded both equal LE. By contrast, if 
the wage is forced to remain above the 
equilibrium level, perhaps because of a 
minimum-wage law, the quantity of labor 
supplied rises to LS and the quantity of 
labor demanded falls to LD. The result-
ing surplus of labor, LS – LD, represents 
unemployment.

WHO EARNS THE MINIMUM WAGE?
In 2015, the Department of Labor released a study of which work-
ers reported earnings at or below the minimum wage in 2014, when 
the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour. (A reported wage below the 
minimum is possible because some workers are exempt from the stat-
ute, because enforcement is imperfect, and because some workers round down 
when reporting their wages on surveys.) Here is a summary of the findings:
r In 2014, 77 million workers were paid at hourly rates (as opposed to being on 
salary or self-employed), representing about half of the labor force. Among

hourly paid workers, about 4 percent reported wages at or below the prevail-
ing federal minimum. Thus, the minimum wage directly affects about  
2 percent of all workers.
r Minimum-wage workers are more likely to be female. Among hourly paid 
workers, 5 percent of women had wages at or below the minimum wage, 
compared with 3 percent of men.
r Minimum-wage workers tend to be young. Among employed teenagers 
(ages 16 to 19) paid by the hour, about 15 percent earned the minimum wage 
or less, compared with 3 percent of hourly paid workers age 25 and older.  
r Minimum-wage workers tend to be less educated. Among hourly paid work-
ers age 16 and older, about 7 percent of those without a high school diploma 
earned the minimum wage or less, compared with about 4 percent of those 
who completed a high school diploma (but did not attend college) and about 
2 percent for those who had obtained a college degree.
An economist who studies the minimum 
wage says there are better ways to help 
the working poor.
Why Market Forces Will Over-
whelm a Higher Minimum Wage
By David Neumark
T
he slogans are everywhere: Fight for 15; 
 People Not Profits; One Job Should Be 
Enough. Worsening income inequality and the 
persistence of poverty have spurred a movement 
to raise the minimum wage, at both the national 
and state levels. Some West Coast cities have 
already voted to boost their minimum wage to 
$15, or more than double the federal standard. 
And Los Angeles is now considering a similarly 
aggressive move.
The labor market problems that these higher 
minimum wages are intended to fix are very 
real. But would a higher wage floor address the 
underlying problems? A large body of research 
shows that the answer is almost certainly no, 
and that there are better solutions, although 
they are harder for policymakers to embrace.
There are several reasons why workers’ wages 
are currently too low to provide what many view 
as an acceptable standard of living. One big fac-
tor is that technological changes have increased 
the value of higher-skilled work and reduced the 
value of lower-skilled work. Globalization, mean-
while, has brought many lower-skilled American 
workers into greater competition with their coun-
terparts in other countries.
Simply requiring employers to pay $15 won’t 
provide much ballast against these market 
forces. In fact, data indicate that minimum 
wages are ineffective at delivering benefits to 
poor or low-income families, and that many of 
the benefits flow to higher-income families. 
That’s because minimum wages target low 
wages rather than low family incomes. And 
many minimum-wage workers are not poor or 
even in low-income families; nearly a quarter 
are teenagers who will eventually find bet-
ter-paid jobs. Moreover, most poor families have 
no workers at all. 
As a result, for every $5 in higher wages 
that a higher minimum imposes on employers, 
only about $1 goes to poor families, whereas 
roughly twice as much goes to families with  
incomes above the median. 
Higher minimum wages also reduce employ-
ment for the least-skilled workers. Certainly not 
every one of the hundreds of studies on the topic 
confirms this conclusion. But there are also 
studies claiming that humans have not contrib-
uted to climate change, and that supply-side 
economics did not contribute to massive bud-
get deficits. The most comprehensive survey of 
minimum wage studies, which I conducted with 
William Wascher of the Federal Reserve System, 
found that two-thirds of studies point to nega-
tive employment effects, as do over 80% of the 
more credible studies. 
Yet another reason to be wary of raising the 
minimum wage is that modest job loss over-
all may mask much steeper job loss among 
the least skilled. Economists use the phrase  
“labor-labor substitution” to describe employ-
ers responding to a higher minimum wage by 
replacing their lowest-skilled workers with high-
er-skilled workers, whom they are more willing 
to hire at the higher minimum.
Based on my research, I think it is likely that 
a $15 minimum wage in Los Angeles will lead 
Should the minimum wage be raised  
to $15 an hour?

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
r Minimum-wage workers are more likely to be working part-time. Among 
part-time workers (those who usually work less than 35 hours per week),  
10 percent were paid the minimum wage or less, compared to 2 percent of 
full-time workers.
r The industry with the highest proportion of workers with reported hourly 
wages at or below the minimum wage was leisure and hospitality  
(18 percent). Over half of all workers paid at or below the minimum wage 
were employed in this industry, primarily in food services and drinking  
establishments. For many of these workers, tips supplement the hourly 
wages received.
r The proportion of hourly paid workers earning the prevailing federal  
minimum wage or less has changed substantially over time. It trended 
downward from 13 percent in 1979, when data collection first began on a 
regular basis, to 2 percent in 2006. It then increased to 4 percent in 2014. This 
recent increase is in part attributable to a legislated increase in the minimum 
wage from $5.15 per hour in 2006 to $7.25 per hour in 2014. ●
some teenagers currently focused on their edu-
cation to take part-time jobs at the new, higher 
minimum, and displace low-skilled workers 
from the jobs they now hold. That seems like a 
bad outcome.
If we really want to help low-skilled workers, 
we need to recognize that the solutions that  
actually work are expensive, difficult to achieve 
or both. 
Guaranteeing a minimally acceptable 
standard of living for those who work entails 
redistribution of some kind. Minimum wage is 
one form of redistribution — although we don’t 
always think of it as such — but it’s a blunt  
instrument. Using the tax system is clearly better.
The Earned Income Tax Credit, for  
instance, targets low-income families very 
well. Research establishes that it provides 
generous government subsidies to these fam-
ilies’ labor market earnings and that it leads 
more people to work, which probably explains 
its  bipartisan support. 
Some decry the EITC as “corporate welfare,” 
because the labor market entry it encourages 
pushes down market wages. But that is pre-
cisely why it increases employment. If it did  
not lower wages, employers would not hire  
additional workers, and those not hired would 
be more dependent on public programs.
Of course we could still do more. We could 
make the EITC more generous, including  
increasing it for those without children who 
a r e  e l i g i b l e 
only for minus-
cule payments. 
More radically, 
we might con-
sider whether all 
low-income fam-
ilies,  irrespective 
of  employment, 
should receive 
m o r e  g e n e r a l 
 income support in 
the form of direct 
cash payments. 
One might think 
of these payments 
as a “public dividend” from the extraordinary 
productivity of the U.S. economy, which has 
permitted those at the top to earn dramatically 
increasing salaries while incomes at the bottom 
have stagnated.
These alternative policies would have 
to be financed by higher taxes, but that’s a 
good thing. Redistribution through taxes is 
paid for by those with the highest incomes. 
In contrast, higher minimum wages are paid 
for by those who happen to own businesses 
in low-wage industries, and the consumers of 
the products of those industries, who are more 
likely to be poor. 
Progressives who want to help low-income 
families by pushing for higher minimum wages 
would do better to channel their energy toward 
methods of redistribution that do less to harm 
the least-skilled, and more to help them.
And assuming that something is going to 
change in response to stagnating incomes, con-
servatives may be happier with the consequences 
of well-designed redistribution policies than the 
kind of high minimum wage floor Los Angeles is 
contemplating. For now, redistribution is a dead 
letter that provokes anguished cries of “social-
ism.” But it doesn’t have to be. ■

PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
28-4 Unions and Collective Bargaining
A union is a worker association that bargains with employers over wages, ben-
efits, and working conditions. Only 11 percent of U.S. workers now belong to 
unions, but unions played a much larger role in the U.S. labor market in the past. 
In the 1940s and 1950s, when union membership was at its peak, about a third of 
the U.S. labor force was unionized.
Moreover, for a variety of historical reasons, unions continue to play a large role 
in many European countries. In Belgium, Norway, and Sweden, for instance, more 
than half of workers belong to unions. In France and Germany, a majority of work-
ers have wages set by collective bargaining by law, even though only some of these 
workers are themselves union members. In these cases, wages are not determined 
by the equilibrium of supply and demand in competitive labor markets.
28-4a The Economics of Unions
A union is a type of cartel. Like any cartel, a union is a group of sellers acting 
together in the hope of exerting their joint market power. Most workers in the 
U.S. economy discuss their wages, benefits, and working conditions with their 
employers as individuals. By contrast, workers in a union do so as a group. The 
process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment is called 
collective bargaining. 
When a union bargains with a firm, it asks for higher wages, better benefits, 
and better working conditions than the firm would offer in the absence of a union. 
If the union and the firm do not reach agreement, the union can organize a with-
drawal of labor from the firm, called a strike. Because a strike reduces production, 
sales, and profit, a firm facing a strike threat is likely to agree to pay higher wages 
than it otherwise would. Economists who study the effects of unions typically 
find that union workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar workers 
who do not belong to unions.
When a union raises the wage above the equilibrium level, it raises the quan-
tity of labor supplied and reduces the quantity of labor demanded, resulting in 
unemployment. Workers who remain employed at the higher wage are better off, 
but those who were previously employed and are now unemployed are worse 
off. Indeed, unions are often thought to cause conflict between different groups 
of workers—between the insiders who benefit from high union wages and the 
outsiders who do not get the union jobs.
The outsiders can respond to their status in one of two ways. Some of them 
remain unemployed and wait for the chance to become insiders and earn the high 
union wage. Others take jobs in firms that are not unionized. Thus, when unions 
raise wages in one part of the economy, the supply of labor increases in other 
parts of the economy. This increase in labor supply, in turn, reduces wages in  
industries that are not unionized. In other words, workers in unions reap the benefit 
of collective bargaining, while workers not in unions bear some of the cost. 
 The role of unions in the economy depends in part on the laws that govern 
union organization and collective bargaining. Normally, explicit agreements 
among members of a cartel are illegal. When firms selling similar products agree 
to set high prices, the agreement is considered a “conspiracy in restraint of trade,” 
and the government prosecutes the firms in civil and criminal court for violating 
the antitrust laws. By contrast, unions are exempt from these laws. The policy-
makers who wrote the antitrust laws believed that workers needed greater market 
power as they bargained with employers. Indeed, various laws are designed to

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
encourage the formation of unions. In particular, the Wagner Act of 1935 prevents 
employers from interfering when workers try to organize unions and requires 
employers to bargain with unions in good faith. The National Labor Relations 
Board (NLRB) is the government agency that enforces workers’ right to unionize.
Legislation affecting the market power of unions is a perennial topic of political 
debate. State lawmakers sometimes debate right-to-work laws, which give workers 
in a unionized firm the right to choose whether to join the union. In the absence 
of such laws, unions can insist during collective bargaining that firms make union 
membership a requirement for employment. At times, lawmakers in Washington 
have debated a proposed law that would prevent firms from hiring permanent 
replacements for workers who are on strike. This law would make strikes more 
costly for firms, thereby increasing the market power of unions. These and similar 
policy decisions will help determine the future of the union movement.
28-4b Are Unions Good or Bad for the Economy?
Economists disagree about whether unions are good or bad for the economy as a 
whole. Let’s consider both sides of the debate.
Critics argue that unions are merely a type of cartel. When unions raise wages 
above the level that would prevail in competitive markets, they reduce the quan-
tity of labor demanded, cause some workers to be unemployed, and reduce the 
wages in the rest of the economy. The resulting allocation of labor is, critics argue, 
both inefficient and inequitable. It is inefficient because high union wages reduce 
employment in unionized firms below the efficient, competitive level. It is inequi-
table because some workers benefit at the expense of other workers.
Advocates contend that unions are a necessary antidote to the market power 
of the firms that hire workers. The extreme case of this market power is the “com-
pany town,” where a single firm does most of the hiring in a geographical region. 
In a company town, if workers do not accept the wages and working conditions 
that the firm offers, they have little choice but to move or stop working. In the 
absence of a union, therefore, the firm could use its market power to pay lower 
wages and offer worse working conditions than would prevail if it had to com-
pete with other firms for the same workers. In this case, a union may balance the 
firm’s market power and protect the workers from being at the mercy of the firm’s 
owners.
Advocates of unions also claim that unions are important for helping firms 
respond efficiently to workers’ concerns. Whenever a worker takes a job, the 
worker and the firm must agree on many attributes of the job in addition to the 
wage: hours of work, overtime, vacations, sick leave, health benefits, promotion 
schedules, job security, and so on. By representing workers’ views on these issues, 
unions allow firms to provide the right mix of job attributes. Even if unions have 
the adverse effect of pushing wages above the equilibrium level and causing  
unemployment, they have the benefit of helping firms keep a happy and produc-
tive workforce. 
In the end, there is no consensus among economists about whether unions are 
good or bad for the economy. Like many institutions, their influence is probably 
beneficial in some circumstances and adverse in others.

28-5 The Theory of Efficiency Wages
A fourth reason economies always experience some unemployment—in addition 
to job search, minimum-wage laws, and unions—is suggested by the theory of 
efficiency wages. According to this theory, firms operate more efficiently if wages 
are above the equilibrium level. Therefore, it may be profitable for firms to keep 
wages high even in the presence of a surplus of labor.
In some ways, the unemployment that arises from efficiency wages is similar 
to the unemployment that arises from minimum-wage laws and unions. In all 
three cases, unemployment is the result of wages above the level that balances the 
quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor demanded. Yet there is also 
an important difference. Minimum-wage laws and unions prevent firms from 
lowering wages in the presence of a surplus of workers. Efficiency-wage theory 
states that such a constraint on firms is unnecessary in many cases because firms 
may be better off keeping wages above the equilibrium level.
Why should firms want to keep wages high? This decision may seem odd at 
first, for wages are a large part of firms’ costs. Normally, we expect profit-maxi-
mizing firms to want to keep costs—and therefore wages—as low as possible. The 
novel insight of efficiency-wage theory is that paying high wages might be profit-
able because they might raise the efficiency of a firm’s workers.
There are several types of efficiency-wage theory. Each type suggests a differ-
ent explanation for why firms may want to pay high wages. Let’s now consider 
four of these types.
28-5a Worker Health
The first and simplest type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between 
wages and worker health. Better-paid workers eat a more nutritious diet, and 
workers who eat a better diet are healthier and more productive. A firm may find 
it more profitable to pay high wages and have healthy, productive workers than 
to pay lower wages and have less healthy, less productive workers.
This type of efficiency-wage theory can be relevant for explaining unemploy-
ment in less developed countries where inadequate nutrition can be a problem. 
In these countries, firms may fear that cutting wages would, in fact, adversely 
influence their workers’ health and productivity. In other words, nutrition 
concerns may explain why firms maintain above-equilibrium wages despite a 
surplus of labor. Worker health concerns are far less relevant for firms in rich 
countries such as the United States, where the equilibrium wages for most work-
ers are well above the level needed for an adequate diet.
28-5b Worker Turnover
A second type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages and 
worker turnover. Workers quit jobs for many reasons: to take jobs at other firms, 
to move to other parts of the country, to leave the labor force, and so on. The 
frequency with which they quit depends on the entire set of incentives they face, 
including the benefits of leaving and the benefits of staying. The more a firm pays 
its workers, the less often its workers will choose to leave. Thus, a firm can reduce 
turnover among its workers by paying them a high wage.
Why do firms care about turnover? The reason is that it is costly for firms to 
hire and train new workers. Moreover, even after they are trained, newly hired 
workers are not as productive as experienced ones. Firms with higher turnover, 
efficiency wages
above-equilibrium wages 
paid by firms to increase 
worker productivity

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
therefore, will tend to have higher production costs. Firms may find it profitable 
to pay wages above the equilibrium level to reduce worker turnover. 
28-5c Worker Quality
A third type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages and 
worker quality. All firms want workers who are talented, and they strive to pick 
the best applicants to fill job openings. But because firms cannot perfectly gauge 
the quality of applicants, hiring has a degree of randomness to it. When a firm 
pays a high wage, it attracts a better pool of workers to apply for its jobs and 
thereby increases the quality of its workforce. If the firm responded to a surplus 
of labor by reducing the wage, the most competent applicants—who are more 
likely to have better alternative opportunities than less competent applicants—
may choose not to apply. If this influence of the wage on worker quality is strong 
enough, it may be profitable for the firm to pay a wage above the level that bal-
ances supply and demand.
28-5d Worker Effort
A fourth and final type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between 
wages and worker effort. In many jobs, workers have some discretion over how 
hard to work. As a result, firms monitor the efforts of their workers, and workers 
caught shirking their responsibilities are fired. But because monitoring is costly 
and imperfect, not all shirkers are caught immediately. A firm in such a circum-
stance is always looking for ways to deter shirking.
One solution is paying wages above the equilibrium level. High wages make 
workers more eager to keep their jobs and thus motivate them to put forward their 
best effort. If the wage were at the level that balanced supply and demand, workers 
would have less reason to work hard because if they were fired, they could quickly 
find new jobs at the same wage. Therefore, firms may raise wages above the equi-
librium level to provide an incentive for workers not to shirk their responsibilities.

CASE 
STUDY 
HENRY FORD AND THE VERY GENEROUS $5-A-DAY WAGE
Henry Ford was an industrial visionary. As founder of the Ford 
Motor Company, he was responsible for introducing modern tech-
niques of production. Rather than building cars with small teams of 
skilled craftsmen, Ford built cars on assembly lines in which unskilled 
workers were taught to perform the same simple tasks over and over again. The 
output of this assembly process was the Model T Ford, one of the most famous 
early automobiles.

596
PART IX   THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN
In 1914, Ford introduced another innovation: the $5 workday. This might not 
seem like much today, but back then $5 was about twice the going wage. It was 
also far above the wage that balanced supply and demand. When the new $5-a-day 
wage was announced, long lines of job seekers formed outside the Ford factories. 
The number of workers willing to work at this wage far exceeded the number of 
workers Ford needed.
Ford’s high-wage policy had many of the effects predicted by efficiency-wage 
theory. Turnover fell, absenteeism fell, and productivity rose. Workers were so 
much more efficient that Ford’s production costs were lower despite higher wages. 
Thus, paying a wage above the equilibrium level was profitable for the firm. An 
historian of the early Ford Motor Company wrote, “Ford and his associates freely 
declared on many occasions that the high-wage policy turned out to be good busi-
ness. By this they meant that it had improved the discipline of the workers, given 
them a more loyal interest in the institution, and raised their personal efficiency.” 
Henry Ford himself called the $5-a-day wage “one of the finest cost-cutting moves 
we ever made.”
Why did it take a Henry Ford to introduce this efficiency wage? Why were other 
firms not already taking advantage of this seemingly profitable business strategy? 
According to some analysts, Ford’s decision was closely linked to his use of the 
assembly line. Workers organized in an assembly line are highly interdependent. If 
one worker is absent or works slowly, other workers are less able to complete their 
own tasks. Thus, while assembly lines made production more efficient, they also 
raised the importance of low worker turnover, high worker effort, and high worker 
quality. As a result, paying efficiency wages may have been a better strategy for the 
Ford Motor Company than for other businesses at the time. ●

above the level that balances quantity of labor supplied and quantity of 
labor demanded.
28-6 Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed the measurement of unemployment and the rea-
sons economies always experience some degree of unemployment. We have seen 
how job search, minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages can all help  
explain why some workers do not have jobs. Which of these four explanations for 
the natural rate of unemployment are the most important for the U.S. economy 
and other economies around the world? Unfortunately, there is no easy way to 
tell. Economists differ in which of these explanations of unemployment they con-
sider most important.
The analysis in this chapter yields an important lesson: Although the economy 
will always have some unemployment, its natural rate does change over time. 
Many events and policies can alter the amount of unemployment the economy 
typically experiences. As the information revolution changes the process of job 
search, as Congress and state legislatures adjust the minimum wage, as workers 
form or quit unions, and as firms change their reliance on efficiency wages, the 
natural rate of unemployment evolves. Unemployment is not a simple problem 
with a simple solution. But how we choose to organize our society can profoundly 
influence how prevalent a problem it is.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
r The unemployment rate is the percentage of those who 
would like to work who do not have jobs. The Bureau 
of Labor Statistics calculates this statistic monthly 
based on a survey of thousands of households.
r The unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of 
joblessness. Some people who call themselves unem-
ployed may actually not want to work, and some peo-
ple who would like to work have left the labor force 
after an unsuccessful search and therefore are not 
counted as unemployed.
r In the U.S. economy, most people who become unem-
ployed find work within a short period of time. None-
theless, most unemployment observed at any given 
time is attributable to the few people who are unem-
ployed for long periods of time.
r One reason for unemployment is the time it takes 
workers to search for jobs that best suit their tastes and 
skills. This frictional unemployment is increased as a 
result of unemployment insurance, a government pol-
icy designed to protect workers’ incomes.
r A second reason our economy always has some  
unemployment is minimum-wage laws. By raising the 
wage of unskilled and inexperienced workers above 
the equilibrium level, minimum-wage laws raise the 
quantity of labor supplied and reduce the quantity 
demanded. The resulting surplus of labor represents 
unemployment.
r A third reason for unemployment is the market power 
of unions. When unions push the wages in unionized 
industries above the equilibrium level, they create a 
surplus of labor. 
r A fourth reason for unemployment is suggested by the 
theory of efficiency wages. According to this theory, 
firms find it profitable to pay wages above the equi-
librium level. High wages can improve worker health, 
lower worker turnover, raise worker quality, and  
increase worker effort.

1. What are the three categories into which the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics divides everyone? How does the BLS 
compute the labor force, the unemployment rate, and 
the labor-force participation rate?
2. Is unemployment typically short-term or long-term? 
Explain.
3. Why is frictional unemployment inevitable? How 
might the government reduce the amount of frictional 
unemployment?
4. Are minimum-wage laws a better explanation for 
structural unemployment among teenagers or among 
college graduates? Why?
5. How do unions affect the natural rate of 
unemployment?
6. What claims do advocates of unions make to argue 
that unions are good for the economy?
7. Explain four ways in which a firm might increase its 
profits by raising the wages it pays.
1. In June 2009, at the trough of the Great Recession, the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that of all adult 
Americans, 140,196,000 were employed, 14,729,000 
were unemployed, and 80,729,000 were not in the  
labor force. Use this information to calculate:
a. the adult population 
b. the labor force
c. the labor-force participation rate
d. the unemployment rate
2. Explain whether each of the following events  
increases, decreases, or has no effect on the unemploy-
ment rate and the labor-force participation rate.  
a. After a long search, Jon finds a job.
b. Tyrion, a full-time college student, graduates and 
is immediately employed.
c. After an unsuccessful job search, Arya gives up 
looking and retires.
d. Daenerys quits her job to become a stay-at-home 
mom.
e. Sansa has a birthday, becomes an adult, but has no 
interest in working.
f. Jaime has a birthday, becomes an adult, and starts 
looking for a job.
g. Cersei dies while enjoying retirement.
h. Jorah dies working long hours at the office.
3. Go to the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(http://www.bls.gov). What is the national unem-
ployment rate right now? Find the unemployment 
rate for the demographic group that best fits a descrip-
tion of you (for example, based on age, sex, and race). 
Is it higher or lower than the national average? Why 
do you think this is so?
4. Between January 2010 and January 2016, U.S.  
employment increased by 12.1 million workers, but 
the number of unemployed workers declined by only 
7.3 million. How are these numbers consistent with 
each other? Why might one expect a reduction in the 
number of people counted as unemployed to be smaller 
than the increase in the number of people employed?
5. Economists use labor-market data to evaluate how 
well an economy is using its most valuable resource—
its people. Two closely watched statistics are the 
unemployment rate and the employment–population 
ratio (calculated as the percentage of the adult popula-
tion that is employed). Explain what happens to each 
of these in the following scenarios. In your opinion,

CHAPTER 28   UNEMPLOYMENT
which statistic is the more meaningful gauge of how 
well the economy is doing?
a. An auto company goes bankrupt and lays off its 
workers, who immediately start looking for new 
jobs.
b. After an unsuccessful search, some of the laid-off 
workers quit looking for new jobs.
c. Numerous students graduate from college but 
cannot find work.
d. Numerous students graduate from college and 
immediately begin new jobs.
e. A stock market boom induces newly enriched 
60-year-old workers to take early retirement.
f. Advances in healthcare prolong the life of many 
retirees.
6. Are the following workers more likely to experience 
short-term or long-term unemployment? Explain.
a. a construction worker who is laid off because of 
bad weather
b. a manufacturing worker who loses his job at a 
plant in an isolated area
c. a stagecoach-industry worker who is laid off  
because of competition from railroads
d. a short-order cook who loses his job when a new 
restaurant opens across the street
e. an expert welder with little formal education who 
loses his job when the company installs automatic 
welding machinery
7. Using a diagram of the labor market, show the effect 
of an increase in the minimum wage on the wage 
paid to workers, the number of workers supplied, the 
number of workers demanded, and the amount of 
unemployment.
8. Consider an economy with two labor markets—one 
for manufacturing workers and one for service work-
ers. Suppose initially that neither is unionized. 
a. If manufacturing workers formed a union, what 
impact would you predict on the wages and em-
ployment in manufacturing? 
b. How would these changes in the manufacturing 
labor market affect the supply of labor in the 
market for service workers? What would happen 
to the equilibrium wage and employment in this 
labor market?
9. Structural unemployment is sometimes said to result 
from a mismatch between the job skills that employers 
want and the job skills that workers have. To explore 
this idea, consider an economy with two industries: 
auto manufacturing and aircraft manufacturing.
a. If workers in these two industries require similar 
amounts of training, and if workers at the begin-
ning of their careers can choose which industry to 
train for, what would you expect to happen to the 
wages in these two industries? How long would 
this process take? Explain.
b. Suppose that one day the economy opens itself to 
international trade and, as a result, starts  
importing autos and exporting aircraft. What 
would happen to the demand for labor in these 
two industries?
c. Suppose that workers in one industry cannot be 
quickly retrained for the other. How would these 
shifts in demand affect equilibrium wages both in 
the short run and in the long run?
d. If for some reason wages fail to adjust to the new 
equilibrium levels, what would occur? 
10. Suppose that Congress passes a law requiring  
employers to provide employees some benefit (such as 
healthcare) that raises the cost of an employee by  
$4 per hour. 
a. What effect does this employer mandate have  
on the demand for labor? (In answering this and 
the following questions, be quantitative when  
you can.)
b. If employees place a value on this benefit exactly 
equal to its cost, what effect does this employer 
mandate have on the supply of labor? 
c. If the wage can freely adjust to balance supply 
and demand, how does this law affect the wage 
and the level of employment? Are employers  
better or worse off? Are employees better or  
worse off?
d. Suppose that, before the mandate, the wage in this 
market was $3 above the minimum wage. In this 
case, how does the employer mandate affect the 
wage, the level of employment, and the level of 
unemployment? 
e. Now suppose that workers do not value the  
mandated benefit at all. How does this alternative 
assumption change your answers to parts (b)  
and (c)?

hen you walk into a restaurant to buy a meal, you get something of value—a 
full stomach. To pay for this service, you might hand the restaurateur 
several worn-out pieces of greenish paper decorated with strange symbols, 
government buildings, and the portraits of famous dead Americans. Or you might 
hand her a single piece of paper with the name of a bank and your signature. 
Or you might show her a plastic card and sign a paper slip. Whether you pay 
by cash, check, or debit card, the restaurateur is happy to work hard to satisfy 
your gastronomical desires in exchange for these pieces of paper, which, in and of 
themselves, are worthless.
Anyone who has lived in a modern economy is familiar with 
this social custom. Even though paper money has no 
intrinsic value, the restaurateur is confident

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
that, in the future, some third person will accept it in exchange for something 
that the restaurateur does value. And that third person is confident that some 
fourth person will accept the money, with the knowledge that yet a fifth person 
will accept the money . . . and so on. To the restaurateur and to other people in 
our society, your cash, check, or debit card receipt represents a claim to goods and 
services in the future.
The social custom of using money for transactions is extraordinarily useful in a 
large, complex society. Imagine, for a moment, that there was no item in the econ-
omy widely accepted in exchange for goods and services. People would have to rely 
on barter—the exchange of one good or service for another—to obtain the things 
they need. To get your restaurant meal, for instance, you would have to offer the 
restaurateur something of immediate value. You could offer to wash some dishes, 
mow her lawn, or give her your family’s secret recipe for meat loaf. An economy 
that relies on barter will have trouble allocating its scarce resources efficiently. In 
such an economy, trade is said to require the double coincidence of wants—the  unlikely 
occurrence that two people each have a good or service that the other wants.
The existence of money makes trade easier. The restaurateur does not care 
whether you can produce a valuable good or service for her. She is happy to  
accept your money, knowing that other people will do the same for her. Such a 
convention allows trade to be roundabout. The restaurateur accepts your money 
and uses it to pay her chef; the chef uses her paycheck to send her child to day 
care; the day care center uses this tuition to pay a teacher; and the teacher hires 
you to mow her lawn. As money flows from person to person in the economy, 
it facilitates production and trade, thereby allowing each person to specialize in 
what she does best and raising everyone’s standard of living.
In this chapter, we begin to examine the role of money in the economy. We 
discuss what money is, the various forms that money takes, how the banking sys-
tem helps create money, and how the government controls the quantity of money 
in circulation. Because money is so important in the economy, we devote much 
effort in the rest of this book to learning how changes in the quantity of money 
affect various economic variables, including inflation, interest rates, produc-
tion, and employment. Consistent with our long-run focus in the previous four 
chapters, in the next chapter we examine the long-run effects of changes in the 
quantity of money. The short-run effects of monetary changes are a more complex 
topic, which we take up later in the book. This chapter provides the background 
for all of this further analysis.
29-1 The Meaning of Money
What is money? This might seem like an odd question. When you read that 
billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has a lot of money, you know what that means: He is 
so rich that he can buy almost anything he wants. In this sense, the term money is 
used to mean wealth.
Economists, however, use the word in a more specific sense: Money is the set 
of assets in the economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services from 
each other. The cash in your wallet is money because you can use it to buy a meal 
at a restaurant or a shirt at a store. By contrast, if you happened to own a large 
share of Facebook, as Mark Zuckerberg does, you would be wealthy, but this asset 
is not considered a form of money. You could not buy a meal or a shirt with this 
wealth without first obtaining some cash. According to the economist’s definition, 
money includes only those few types of wealth that are regularly accepted by 
sellers in exchange for goods and services.

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
29-1a The Functions of Money
Money has three functions in the economy: It is a medium of exchange, a unit of 
account, and a store of value. These three functions together distinguish money 
from other assets in the economy, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and even 
baseball cards. Let’s examine each of these functions of money.
A medium of exchange is an item that buyers give to sellers when they purchase 
goods and services. When you go to a store to buy a shirt, the store gives you the 
shirt and you give the store your money. This transfer of money from buyer to 
seller allows the transaction to take place. When you walk into a store, you are 
confident that the store will accept your money for the items it is selling because 
money is the commonly accepted medium of exchange. 
A unit of account is the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts. 
When you go shopping, you might observe that a shirt costs $50 and a hamburger 
costs $5. Even though it would be accurate to say that the price of a shirt is 10 
hamburgers and the price of a hamburger is 1/10  of a shirt, prices are never quoted 
in this way. Similarly, if you take out a loan from a bank, the size of your future 
loan repayments will be measured in dollars, not in a quantity of goods and 
services. When we want to measure and record economic value, we use money as 
the unit of account. 
A store of value is an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power 
from the present to the future. When a seller accepts money today in exchange 
for a good or service, that seller can hold the money and become a buyer of 
another good or service at another time. Money is not the only store of value in 
the economy: A person can also transfer purchasing power from the present to 
the future by holding nonmonetary assets such as stocks and bonds. The term 
wealth is used to refer to the total of all stores of value, including both money and 
nonmonetary assets.
Economists use the term liquidity to describe the ease with which an asset 
can be converted into the economy’s medium of exchange. Because money is the 
economy’s medium of exchange, it is the most liquid asset available. Other assets 
vary widely in their liquidity. Most stocks and bonds can be sold easily with small 
cost, so they are relatively liquid assets. By contrast, selling a house, a Rembrandt 
painting, or a 1948 Joe DiMaggio baseball card requires more time and effort, so 
these assets are less liquid.
When people decide how to allocate their wealth, they have to balance the 
liquidity of each possible asset against the asset’s usefulness as a store of value. 
Money is the most liquid asset, but it is far from perfect as a store of value. When 
prices rise, the value of money falls. In other words, when goods and services 
become more expensive, each dollar in your wallet can buy less. This link between 
the price level and the value of money is key to understanding how money affects 
the economy, a topic we start to explore in the next chapter.
29-1b The Kinds of Money
When money takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value, it is called 
commodity money. The term intrinsic value means that the item would have 
value even if it were not used as money. One example of commodity money is 
gold. Gold has intrinsic value because it is used in industry and in the making of 
jewelry. Although today we no longer use gold as money, historically gold was a 
common form of money because it is relatively easy to carry, measure, and verify 
for impurities. When an economy uses gold as money (or uses paper money that 
is convertible into gold on demand), it is said to be operating under a gold standard.

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
Another example of commodity money is cigarettes. In prisoner-of-war camps 
during World War II, prisoners traded goods and services with one another 
using cigarettes as the store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. 
Similarly, as the Soviet Union was breaking up in the late 1980s, cigarettes started 
replacing the ruble as the preferred currency in Moscow. In both cases, even 
nonsmokers were happy to accept cigarettes in an exchange, knowing that they 
could use the cigarettes to buy other goods and services.
Money without intrinsic value is called fiat money. A fiat is an order or decree, and 
fiat money is established as money by government decree. For example, compare the 
paper dollars in your wallet (printed by the U.S. government) and the paper dollars 
from a game of Monopoly (printed by the Parker Brothers game company). Why can 
you use the first to pay your bill at a restaurant but not the second? The answer is that 
the U.S. government has decreed its dollars to be valid money. Each paper dollar in 
your wallet reads: “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.”
Although the government is central to establishing and regulating a system 
of fiat money (by prosecuting counterfeiters, for example), other factors are 
also required for the success of such a monetary system. To a large extent, the 
acceptance of fiat money depends as much on expectations and social convention 
as on government decree. The Soviet government in the 1980s never abandoned 
the ruble as the official currency. Yet the people of Moscow preferred to accept 
cigarettes (or even American dollars) in exchange for goods and services because 
they were more confident that these alternative monies would be accepted by 
others in the future.

value that is used as

decree
For many centuries, when societies have 
used a form of commodity money, the 
most common choice has been the gold 
standard. This outcome may have a 
sound scientific basis.
A Chemist Explains Why  
Gold Beat Out Lithium,  
Osmium, Einsteinium...
By Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum 
T
he periodic table lists 118 different chemical 
elements. And yet, for thousands of years, 
humans have really, really liked one of them in 
particular: gold. Gold has been used as money 
for millennia, and its price has been going 
through the roof.
Why gold? Why not osmium, lithium, or 
ruthenium?
We went to an expert to find out: Sanat  
Kumar, a chemical engineer at Columbia  
University. We asked him to take the periodic 
table, and start eliminating anything that 
wouldn’t work as money.
The periodic table looks kind of like a bingo 
card. Each square has a different element in 
it—one for carbon, another for gold, and so on.
Sanat starts with the far-right column of the 
table. The elements there have a really appeal-
ing characteristic: They’re not going to change. 
They’re chemically stable.
But there’s also a big drawback: They’re 
gases. You could put all your gaseous money in 
a jar, but if you opened the jar, you’d be broke. 
So Sanat crosses out the right-hand column.
Then he swings over to the far left-hand col-
umn, and points to one of the elements there: 
Lithium
“If you expose lithium to air, it will cause a 
huge fire that can burn through concrete walls,” 
he says.
Money that spontaneously bursts into flames 
is clearly a bad idea. In fact, you don’t want your 
money undergoing any kind of spontaneous chem-
ical reactions. And it turns out that a lot of the ele-
ments in the periodic table are pretty reactive.
Not all of them burst into flames. But some-
times they corrode, start to fall apart.
So Sanat crosses out another 38 elements, 
because they’re too reactive.
Then we ask him about those two weird 
rows at the bottom of the table. They’re always

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
29-1c Money in the U.S. Economy
As we will see, the quantity of money circulating in the economy, called the money 
stock, has a powerful influence on many economic variables. But before we consider 
why that is true, we need to ask a preliminary question: What is the quantity of 
money? In particular, suppose you were given the task of measuring how much 
money there is in the U.S. economy. What would you include in your measure?
The most obvious asset to include is currency—the paper bills and coins in 
the hands of the public. Currency is clearly the most widely accepted medium of 
exchange in our economy. There is no doubt that it is part of the money stock.
Yet currency is not the only asset that you can use to buy goods and services. 
Many stores also accept personal checks. Wealth held in your checking account is 
almost as convenient for buying things as wealth held in your wallet. To measure 
the money stock, therefore, you might want to include demand deposits—balances 
in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand simply by writing a check 
or swiping a debit card at a store.
Once you start to consider balances in checking accounts as part of the money 
stock, you are led to consider the large variety of other accounts that people hold 
at banks and other financial institutions. Bank depositors usually cannot write 
checks against the balances in their savings accounts, but they can easily transfer 
funds from savings into checking accounts. In addition, depositors in money 
market mutual funds can often write checks against their balances. Thus, these 
other accounts should plausibly be part of the U.S. money stock.

broken out separately from the main table, and 
they have some great names—promethium, 
einsteinium.
But it turns out they’re radioactive—put some 
einsteinium in your pocket, and a year later, you’ll 
be dead.
So we’re down from 118 elements to 30, 
and we’ve come up with a list of three key 
requirements:
1. Not a gas. 
2.  Doesn’t corrode or burst into flames.
3. Doesn’t kill you. 
Now Sanat adds a new requirement: You 
want the thing you pick to be rare. This lets him 
cross off a lot of the boxes near the top of the 
table, because the elements clustered there 
tend to be more abundant.
At the same time, you don’t want to pick an 
element that’s too rare. So osmium—which appar-
ently comes to earth via meteorites—gets the axe.
That leaves us with just five elements: rho-
dium, palladium, silver, platinum and gold. And 
all of them, as it happens, are considered pre-
cious metals.
But even here we can cross things out. Sil-
ver has been widely used as money, of course. 
But it’s reactive—it tarnishes. So Sanat says 
it’s not the best choice.
Early civilizations couldn’t have used rho-
dium or palladium, because they weren’t dis-
covered until the early 1800s.
That leaves platinum and gold, both of 
which can be found in rivers and streams.
But if you were in the ancient world and 
wanted to make platinum coins, you would have 
needed some sort of magic furnace from the 
future. The melting point for platinum is over 
3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Gold happens to melt at a much lower tem-
perature, which made it much easier for pre- 
industrial people to work with.
So we ask Sanat: If we could run the clock 
back and start history again, could things go 
a different way, or would gold emerge again as 
the element of choice?
“For the earth, with every parameter we 
have, gold is the sweet spot,” he says. “It would 
come out no other way.” ■

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
In a complex economy such as ours, it is not easy to draw a line between assets 
that can be called “money” and assets that cannot. The coins in your pocket 
clearly are part of the money stock, and the Empire State Building clearly is not, 
but there are many assets in between these extremes for which the choice is less 
clear. Because different analysts can reasonably disagree about where to draw the 
dividing line between monetary and nonmonetary assets, various measures of 
the money stock are available for the U.S. economy. Figure 1 shows the two most 
commonly used, designated M1 and M2. M2 includes more assets in its measure 
of money than does M1.
For our purposes in this book, we need not dwell on the differences between the 
various measures of money. None of our discussion will hinge on the distinction 
between M1 and M2. The important point is that the money stock for the U.S. 
economy includes not only currency but also deposits in banks and other financial 
institutions that can be readily accessed and used to buy goods and services.

WHERE IS ALL THE CURRENCY?
One puzzle about the money stock of the U.S. economy concerns 
the amount of currency. In January 2016, there was $1.4 trillion of 
currency outstanding. To put this number in perspective, we can 
divide it by 252 million, the number of adults (age 16 and older) in the 
United States. This calculation implies that the average adult holds over $5,500 
of currency. Most people are surprised to learn that our economy has so much 
currency because they carry far less than this in their wallets. 
Who is holding all this currency? No one knows for sure, but there are two 
plausible explanations. 
The first explanation is that much of the currency is held abroad. In foreign 
countries without a stable monetary system, people often prefer U.S. dollars to 
domestic assets. Estimates suggest that over half of U.S. dollars circulate outside 
the United States.
The second explanation is that much of the currency is held by drug dealers, 
tax evaders, and other criminals. For most people in the U.S. economy, currency is 
not a particularly good way to hold wealth. Not only can currency be lost or stolen

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
Why Credit Cards Aren’t Money
I
t might seem natural to include credit cards as part of the economy’s 
stock of money. After all, people use credit cards to make many of their 
purchases. Aren’t credit cards, therefore, a medium of exchange?
At first this argument may seem persuasive, but credit cards are 
excluded from all measures of the quantity of money. The reason is that 
credit cards are not really a method of payment but rather a method of 
deferring payment. When you buy a meal with a credit card, the bank 
that issued the card pays the restaurant what it is due. At a later date, 
you will have to repay the bank (perhaps with interest). When the time 
comes to pay your credit card bill, you will probably do so by writing 
a check against your checking account. The balance in this checking 
account is part of the economy’s stock of money.
Notice that credit cards are different from debit cards, which 
automatically withdraw funds from a bank account to pay for items 
bought. Rather than allowing the user to postpone payment for a 
purchase, a debit card gives the user immediate access to deposits in 
a bank account. In this 
sense, a debit card is more 
similar to a check than to 
a credit card. The account 
balances that lie behind 
debit cards are included in 
measures of the quantity of money.
Even though credit cards are not considered a form of money, they 
are nonetheless important for analyzing the monetary system. People 
who have credit cards can pay many of their bills together at the end of 
the month, rather than sporadically as they make purchases. As a result, 
people who have credit cards probably hold less money on average 
than people who do not have credit cards. Thus, the introduction and 
increased popularity of credit cards may reduce the amount of money 
that people choose to hold. ■

but it also does not earn interest, whereas a bank deposit does. Thus, most people 
hold only small amounts of currency. By contrast, criminals may avoid putting 
their wealth in banks because a bank deposit gives police a paper trail that they can 
use to trace illegal activities. For criminals, currency may be the best store of value 
available. ●

List and describe the three functions of money.
29-2 The Federal Reserve System
Whenever an economy uses a system of fiat money, as the U.S. economy does, 
some agency must be responsible for regulating the system. In the United States, 
that agency is the Federal Reserve, often simply called the Fed. If you look at the 
top of a dollar bill, you will see that it is called a “Federal Reserve Note.” The Fed 
is an example of a central bank—an institution designed to oversee the banking 
system and regulate the quantity of money in the economy. Other major central 
banks around the world include the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the 
European Central Bank. 
29-2a The Fed’s Organization
The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 after a series of bank failures in 1907 
convinced Congress that the United States needed a central bank to ensure 
the health of the nation’s banking system. Today, the Fed is run by its board of 
governors, which has seven members appointed by the president and confirmed 
by the Senate. The governors have 14-year terms. Just as federal judges are given

lifetime appointments to insulate them from politics, Fed governors are given 
long terms to give them independence from short-term political pressures when 
they formulate monetary policy.
Among the seven members of the board of governors, the most important is the 
chair. The chair directs the Fed staff, presides over board meetings, and testifies 
regularly about Fed policy in front of congressional committees. The president 
appoints the chair to a 4-year term. As this book was going to press, the chair of 
the Fed was Janet Yellen, a former economics professor who was appointed to the 
Fed job by President Barack Obama in 2014.
The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Federal Reserve Board in 
Washington, D.C., and twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major 
cities around the country. The presidents of the regional banks are chosen by each 
bank’s board of directors, whose members are typically drawn from the region’s 
banking and business community. 
The Fed has two related jobs. The first is to regulate banks and ensure the health 
of the banking system. This task is largely the responsibility of the regional Federal 
Reserve Banks. In particular, the Fed monitors each bank’s financial condition and 
facilitates bank transactions by clearing checks. It also acts as a bank’s bank. That 
is, the Fed makes loans to banks when banks themselves want to borrow. When 
financially troubled banks find themselves short of cash, the Fed acts as a lender 
of last resort—a lender to those who cannot borrow anywhere else—to maintain 
stability in the overall banking system. 
The Fed’s second and more important job is to control the quantity of money 
that is made available in the economy, called the money supply. Decisions 
by policymakers concerning the money supply constitute monetary policy. 
At the Federal Reserve, monetary policy is made by the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC). The FOMC meets about every six weeks in Washington, 
D.C., to discuss the condition of the economy and consider changes in monetary 
policy.
29-2b The Federal Open Market Committee
The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of the seven members of the 
board of governors and five of the twelve regional bank presidents. All twelve 
regional presidents attend each FOMC meeting, but only five get to vote. Voting 
rights rotate among the twelve regional presidents over time. The president of the 
New York Fed always gets a vote, however, because New York is the traditional 
financial center of the U.S. economy and because all Fed purchases and sales of 
government bonds are conducted at the New York Fed’s trading desk.
Through the decisions of the FOMC, the Fed has the power to increase or 
decrease the number of dollars in the economy. In simple metaphorical terms, you 
can imagine the Fed printing dollar bills and dropping them around the country 
by helicopter. Similarly, you can imagine the Fed using a giant vacuum cleaner to 
suck dollar bills out of people’s wallets. Although in practice the Fed’s methods 
for changing the money supply are more complex and subtle than this, the 
helicopter-vacuum metaphor is a good first step to understanding the meaning of 
monetary policy.
Later in this chapter, we discuss how the Fed actually changes the money 
supply, but it is worth noting here that the Fed’s primary tool is the open-market 
operation—the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds. (Recall that a U.S.

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
government bond is a certificate of indebtedness of the federal government.) If 
the FOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and uses 
them to buy government bonds from the public in the nation’s bond markets. 
After the purchase, these dollars are in the hands of the public. Thus, an open-
market purchase of bonds by the Fed increases the money supply. Conversely, if 
the FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bonds 
from its portfolio to the public in the nation’s bond markets. After the sale, the 
dollars the Fed receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public. Thus, an 
open-market sale of bonds by the Fed decreases the money supply.
Central banks are important institutions because changes in the money 
supply can profoundly affect the economy. One of the Ten Principles of Economics
introduced in Chapter 1 is that prices rise when the government prints too much 
money. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that society faces a short-run 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The power of the Fed rests on 
these principles. For reasons we discuss more fully in the coming chapters, the 
Fed’s policy decisions are key determinants of the economy’s rate of inflation in 
the long run and the economy’s employment and production in the short run. 
Indeed, the Fed’s chair has been called the second most powerful person in the 
United States. 
QuickQuiz
What are the primary responsibilities of the Federal Reserve? If the Fed 
wants to increase the supply of money, how does it usually do so?
29-3 Banks and the Money Supply
So far, we have introduced the concept of “money” and discussed how the Federal 
Reserve controls the supply of money by buying and selling government bonds in 
open-market operations. This explanation of the money supply is correct, but it is 
not complete. In particular, it omits the key role that banks play in the monetary 
system. 
Recall that the amount of money you hold includes both currency (the bills 
in your wallet and coins in your pocket) and demand deposits (the balance in 
your checking account). Because demand deposits are held in banks, the behavior 
of banks can influence the quantity of demand deposits in the economy and, 
therefore, the money supply. This section examines how banks affect the money 
supply and, in doing so, how they complicate the Fed’s job of controlling the 
money supply.
29-3a The Simple Case of 100-Percent-Reserve Banking
To see how banks influence the money supply, let’s first imagine a world without 
any banks at all. In this simple world, currency is the only form of money. To be 
concrete, let’s suppose that the total quantity of currency is $100. The supply of 
money is, therefore, $100.
Now suppose that someone opens a bank, appropriately called First National 
Bank. First National Bank is only a depository institution—that is, it accepts 
deposits but does not make loans. The purpose of the bank is to give depositors 
a safe place to keep their money. Whenever a person deposits some money,

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
the bank keeps the money in its vault until the depositor withdraws it, writes 
a check, or uses a debit card to access her balance. Deposits that banks have 
received but have not loaned out are called reserves. In this imaginary economy, 
all deposits are held as reserves, so this system is called 100-percent-reserve 
banking. 
We can express the financial position of First National Bank with a T-account, 
which is a simplified accounting statement that shows changes in a bank’s assets 
and liabilities. Here is the T-account for First National Bank if the economy’s 
entire $100 of money is deposited in the bank: 
First National Bank
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$100.00
Deposits
$100.00
On the left side of the T-account are the bank’s assets of $100 (the reserves it holds 
in its vaults). On the right side are the bank’s liabilities of $100 (the amount it 
owes to its depositors). Because the assets and liabilities exactly balance, this 
accounting statement is called a balance sheet. 
Now consider the money supply in this imaginary economy. Before First 
National Bank opens, the money supply is the $100 of currency that people are 
holding. After the bank opens and people deposit their currency, the money supply 
is the $100 of demand deposits. (There is no longer any currency outstanding, 
since it is all in the bank vault.) Each deposit in the bank reduces currency and 
raises demand deposits by exactly the same amount, leaving the money supply 
unchanged. Thus, if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply 
of money.
29-3b Money Creation with Fractional-Reserve Banking
Eventually, the bankers at First National Bank may start to reconsider their 
policy of 100-percent-reserve banking. Leaving all that money idle in their vaults 
seems unnecessary. Why not lend some of it out and earn a profit by charging 
interest on the loans? Families buying houses, firms building new factories, and 
students paying for college would all be happy to pay interest to borrow some 
of that money for a while. First National Bank has to keep some reserves so that 
currency is available if depositors want to make withdrawals. But if the flow of 
new deposits is roughly the same as the flow of withdrawals, First National needs 
to keep only a fraction of its deposits in reserve. Thus, First National adopts a 
system called fractional-reserve banking.
The fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves is called the reserve 
ratio. This ratio is influenced by both government regulation and bank policy. As 
we discuss more fully later in the chapter, the Fed sets a minimum amount of 
reserves that banks must hold, called a reserve requirement. In addition, banks may 
hold reserves above the legal minimum, called excess reserves, so they can be more 
confident that they will not run short of cash. For our purpose here, we take the 
reserve ratio as given to examine how fractional-reserve banking influences the 
money supply.

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
Let’s suppose that First National has a reserve ratio of 1/10, or 10 percent. This 
means that it keeps 10 percent of its deposits in reserve and loans out the rest. 
Now let’s look again at the bank’s T-account:
First National Bank
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$10.00
Deposits
$100.00
Loans
90.00
First National still has $100 in liabilities because making the loans did not alter the 
bank’s obligation to its depositors. But now the bank has two kinds of assets: It has $10 
of reserves in its vault, and it has loans of $90. (These loans are liabilities of the people 
borrowing from First National, but they are assets of the bank because the borrowers 
will later repay the loans.) In total, First National’s assets still equal its liabilities.
Once again consider the supply of money in the economy. Before First National 
makes any loans, the money supply is the $100 of deposits. Yet when First National 
lends out some of these deposits, the money supply increases. The depositors still 
have demand deposits totaling $100, but now the borrowers hold $90 in currency. 
The money supply (which equals currency plus demand deposits) equals $190. Thus, 
when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, the banking system creates money.
At first, this creation of money by fractional-reserve banking may seem too 
good to be true: It appears that the bank has created money out of thin air. To 
make this feat seem less miraculous, note that when First National Bank loans 
out some of its reserves and creates money, it does not create any wealth. Loans 
from First National give the borrowers some currency and thus the ability to buy 
goods and services. Yet the borrowers are also taking on debts, so the loans do not 
make them any richer. In other words, as a bank creates the asset of money, it also 
creates a corresponding liability for those who borrowed the created money. At 
the end of this process of money creation, the economy is more liquid in the sense 
that there is more of the medium of exchange, but the economy is no wealthier 
than before.
29-3c The Money Multiplier 
The creation of money does not stop with First National Bank. Suppose the 
borrower from First National uses the $90 to buy something from someone who 
then deposits the currency in Second National Bank. Here is the T-account for 
Second National Bank:
Second National Bank
Assets
Liabilities
Reserves
$  9.00
Deposits
$90.00
Loans
81.00
After the deposit, this bank has liabilities of $90. If Second National also has a 
reserve ratio of 10 percent, it keeps assets of $9 in reserve and makes $81 in loans. 
In this way, Second National Bank creates an additional $81 of money. If this $81 
is eventually deposited in Third National Bank, which also has a reserve ratio of

T-account for Third National Bank:

Reserves
$  8.10
Deposits
$81.00

The process goes on and on. Each time that money is deposited and a bank loan is 
made, more money is created.
How much money is eventually created in this economy? Let’s add it up:
Original deposit                 5 $100.00
First National lending   5 $ 90.00 (5 .9 3 $100.00)
Second National lending 5 $ 81.00 (5 .9 × $90.00)
Third National lending      5 $ 72.90 (5 .9 3 $81.00)

Total money supply 
5 $1,000.00
It turns out that even though this process of money creation can continue forever, 
it does not create an infinite amount of money. If you laboriously add the infinite 
sequence of numbers in the preceding example, you find that the $100 of reserves 
generates $1,000 of money. The amount of money the banking system generates 
with each dollar of reserves is called the money multiplier. In this imaginary 
economy, where the $100 of reserves generates $1,000 of money, the money 
multiplier is 10.
What determines the size of the money multiplier? It turns out that the answer 
is simple: The money multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. If R is the reserve 
ratio for all banks in the economy, then each dollar of reserves generates 1/R 
dollars of money. In our example, R = 1/10, so the money multiplier is 10.
This reciprocal formula for the money multiplier makes sense. If a bank holds 
$1,000 in deposits, then a reserve ratio of 1/10 (10 percent) means that the bank 
must hold $100 in reserves. The money multiplier just turns this idea around: 
If the banking system as a whole holds a total of $100 in reserves, it can have 
only $1,000 in deposits. In other words, if R is the ratio of reserves to deposits at 
each bank (that is, the reserve ratio), then the ratio of deposits to reserves in the 
banking system (that is, the money multiplier) must be 1/R.
This formula shows how the amount of money banks create depends on the 
reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio were only 1/20 (5 percent), then the banking 
system would have 20 times as much in deposits as in reserves, implying a money 
multiplier of 20. Each dollar of reserves would generate $20 of money. Similarly, 
if the reserve ratio were 1/4 (25 percent), deposits would be 4 times reserves, the 
money multiplier would be 4, and each dollar of reserves would generate $4 of 
money. Thus, the higher the reserve ratio, the less of each deposit banks loan out, and the 
smaller the money multiplier. In the special case of 100-percent-reserve banking, the 
reserve ratio is 1, the money multiplier is 1, and banks do not make loans or create 
money.

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
29-3d  Bank Capital, Leverage, and the Financial Crisis  
of 2008–2009
In the previous sections, we have seen a simplified explanation of how banks 
work. But the reality of modern banking is a bit more complicated, and these 
complications played a key role in the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Before 
looking at that crisis, we need to learn a bit more about how banks actually 
function.
In the bank balance sheets you have seen so far, a bank accepts deposits 
and either uses those deposits to make loans or holds them as reserves. More 
realistically, a bank gets financial resources not only from accepting deposits but 
also, like other companies, from issuing equity and debt. The resources that a 
bank obtains from issuing equity to its owners are called bank capital. A bank 
uses these financial resources in various ways to generate profit for its owners. It 
not only makes loans and holds reserves but also buys financial securities, such as 
stocks and bonds. 
Here is a more realistic example of a bank’s balance sheet:
More Realistic National Bank
Assets
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity
Reserves
$200
Deposits
$800
Loans
700
Debt
150
Securities
100
Capital (owners’ equity)
50
On the right side of this balance sheet are the bank’s liabilities and capital (also 
called owners’ equity). This bank obtained $50 of resources from its owners. It also 
took in $800 of deposits and issued $150 of debt. The total of $1,000 was put to use 
in three ways; these are listed on the left side of the balance sheet, which shows 
the bank’s assets. This bank held $200 in reserves, made $700 in bank loans, and 
used $100 to buy financial securities, such as government or corporate bonds. 
The bank decides how to allocate its resources among asset classes based on their 
risk and return, as well as on any regulations (such as reserve requirements) that 
restrict the bank’s choices. 
By the rules of accounting, the reserves, loans, and securities on the left side 
of the balance sheet must always equal, in total, the deposits, debt, and capital 
on the right side of the balance sheet. There is no magic in this equality. It occurs 
because the value of the owners’ equity is, by definition, the value of the bank’s 
assets (reserves, loans, and securities) minus the value of its liabilities (deposits 
and debt). Therefore, the left and right sides of the balance sheet always sum to 
the same total.
Many businesses in the economy rely on leverage, the use of borrowed money 
to supplement existing funds for investment purposes. Indeed, whenever anyone 
uses debt to finance an investment project, she is applying leverage. Leverage is 
particularly important for banks, however, because borrowing and lending are at 
the heart of what they do. To fully understand banking, therefore, it is crucial to 
understand how leverage works. 
The leverage ratio is the ratio of the bank’s total assets to bank capital. In this 
example, the leverage ratio is $1,000/$50, or 20. A leverage ratio of 20 means that 
for every dollar of capital that the bank owners have contributed, the bank has

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
$20 of assets. Of the $20 of assets, $19 are financed with borrowed money—either 
by taking in deposits or issuing debt.
You may have learned in a science class that a lever can amplify a force: 
A boulder that you cannot move with your arms alone will move more easily 
if you use a lever. A similar result occurs with bank leverage. To see how this 
amplification works, let’s continue with this numerical example. Suppose that the 
bank’s assets were to rise in value by 5 percent because, say, some of the securities 
the bank was holding rose in price. Then the $1,000 of assets would now be 
worth $1,050. Because the depositors and debt holders are still owed $950, the 
bank capital rises from $50 to $100. Thus, when the leverage rate is 20, a 5-percent 
increase in the value of assets increases the owners’ equity by 100 percent.
The same principle works on the downside, but with troubling consequences. 
Suppose that some people who borrowed from the bank default on their loans, 
reducing the value of the bank’s assets by 5 percent, to $950. Because the depositors 
and debt holders have the legal right to be paid before the bank owners, the value 
of the owners’ equity falls to zero. Thus, when the leverage ratio is 20, a 5-percent 
fall in the value of the bank’s assets leads to a 100-percent fall in bank capital. If 
the value of assets were to fall by more than 5 percent, the bank’s assets would 
fall below its liabilities. In this case, the bank would be insolvent, and it would be 
unable to pay off its debt holders and depositors in full.
Bank regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital. The goal 
of such a capital requirement is to ensure that banks will be able to pay off their 
depositors (without having to resort to government-provided deposit insurance 
funds). The amount of capital required depends on the kind of assets a bank 
holds. If the bank holds safe assets such as government bonds, regulators require 
less capital than if the bank holds risky assets such as loans to borrowers whose 
credit is of dubious quality.
Economic turmoil can result when banks find themselves with too little capital 
to satisfy capital requirements. An example of this phenomenon occurred in 2008 
and 2009, when many banks realized they had incurred sizable losses on some of 
their assets—specifically, mortgage loans and securities backed by mortgage loans. 
The shortage of capital induced the banks to reduce lending, a phenomenon called 
a credit crunch, which in turn contributed to a severe downturn in economic activity. 
(This event is discussed more fully in Chapter 33.) To address this problem, the U.S. 
Treasury, working together with the Federal Reserve, put many billions of dollars 
of public funds into the banking system to increase the amount of bank capital. As 
a result, it temporarily made the U.S. taxpayer a part owner of many banks. The 
goal of this unusual policy was to recapitalize the banking system so that bank 
lending could return to a more normal level, which in fact occurred by late 2009.

29-4 The Fed’s Tools of Monetary Control
As we have already discussed, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling the 
supply of money in the economy. Now that we understand how banking works, 
we are in a better position to understand how the Fed carries out this job. Because 
banks create money in a system of fractional-reserve banking, the Fed’s control of 
the money supply is indirect. When the Fed decides to change the money supply, 
it must consider how its actions will work through the banking system.

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
The Fed has various tools in its monetary toolbox. We can group the tools into 
two groups: those that influence the quantity of reserves and those that influence 
the reserve ratio and thereby the money multiplier.
29-4a How the Fed Influences the Quantity of Reserves
The first way the Fed can change the money supply is by changing the quantity of 
reserves. The Fed alters the quantity of reserves in the economy either by buying 
or selling bonds in open-market operations or by making loans to banks (or by 
some combination of the two). Let’s consider each of these in turn.
Open-Market Operations  As we noted earlier, the Fed conducts open-market 
operations when it buys or sells government bonds. To increase the money sup-
ply, the Fed instructs its bond traders at the New York Fed to buy bonds from 
the public in the nation’s bond markets. The dollars the Fed pays for the bonds 
increase the number of dollars in the economy. Some of these new dollars are held 
as currency, and some are deposited in banks. Each new dollar held as currency 
increases the money supply by exactly $1. Each new dollar deposited in a bank in-
creases the money supply by more than a dollar because it increases reserves and, 
thereby, the amount of money that the banking system can create.
To reduce the money supply, the Fed does just the opposite: It sells government 
bonds to the public in the nation’s bond markets. The public pays for these bonds 
with its holdings of currency and bank deposits, directly reducing the amount 
of money in circulation. In addition, as people make withdrawals from banks to 
buy these bonds from the Fed, banks find themselves with a smaller quantity of 
reserves. In response, banks reduce the amount of lending, and the process of 
money creation reverses itself.
Open-market operations are easy to conduct. In fact, the Fed’s purchases 
and sales of government bonds in the nation’s bond markets are similar to the 
transactions that any individual might undertake for her own portfolio. (Of 
course, when two individuals engage in a purchase or sale with each other, 
money changes hands, but the amount of money in circulation remains the same.) 
In addition, the Fed can use open-market operations to change the money supply 
by a small or large amount on any day without major changes in laws or bank 
regulations. Therefore, open-market operations are the tool of monetary policy 
that the Fed uses most often. 
Fed Lending to Banks  The Fed can also increase the quantity of reserves in the 
economy by lending reserves to banks. Banks borrow from the Fed when they feel 
they do not have enough reserves on hand, either to satisfy bank regulators, meet 
depositor withdrawals, make new loans, or for some other business reason. 
There are various ways banks can borrow from the Fed. Traditionally, banks 
borrow from the Fed’s discount window and pay an interest rate on that loan called 
the discount rate. When the Fed makes such a loan to a bank, the banking system 
has more reserves than it otherwise would, and these additional reserves allow 
the banking system to create more money.
The Fed can alter the money supply by changing the discount rate. A higher 
discount rate discourages banks from borrowing reserves from the Fed. Thus, 
an increase in the discount rate reduces the quantity of reserves in the banking 
system, which in turn reduces the money supply. Conversely, a lower discount 
rate encourages banks to borrow from the Fed, increasing the quantity of reserves 
and the money supply.

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
At times, the Fed has set up other mechanisms for banks to borrow from it. For 
example, from 2007 to 2010, under the Term Auction Facility, the Fed set a quantity 
of funds it wanted to lend to banks, and eligible banks then bid to borrow those 
funds. The loans went to the highest eligible bidders—that is, to the banks that 
had acceptable collateral and offered to pay the highest interest rate. Unlike at the 
discount window, where the Fed sets the price of a loan and the banks determine 
the quantity of borrowing, at the Term Auction Facility the Fed set the quantity of 
borrowing and competitive bidding among banks determined the price. The more 
funds the Fed made available, the greater the quantity of reserves and the larger 
the money supply.
The Fed lends to banks not only to control the money supply but also to help 
financial institutions when they are in trouble. For example, when the stock 
market crashed by 22 percent on October 19, 1987, many Wall Street brokerage 
firms found themselves temporarily in need of funds to finance the high volume 
of stock trading. The next morning, before the stock market opened, Fed Chair 
Alan Greenspan announced the Fed’s “readiness to serve as a source of liquidity 
to support the economic and financial system.” Many economists believe that 
Greenspan’s reaction to the stock crash was an important reason it had few 
repercussions.
Similarly, in 2008 and 2009, a fall in housing prices throughout the United 
States led to a sharp rise in the number of homeowners defaulting on their 
mortgage loans, and many financial institutions holding those mortgages ran 
into trouble. In an attempt to prevent these events from having broader economic 
ramifications, the Fed provided many billions of dollars in loans to financial 
institutions in distress.
29-4b How the Fed Influences the Reserve Ratio
In addition to influencing the quantity of reserves, the Fed changes the money 
supply by influencing the reserve ratio and thereby the money multiplier. The Fed 
can influence the reserve ratio either through regulating the quantity of reserves 
banks must hold or through the interest rate that the Fed pays banks on their 
reserves. Again, let’s consider each of these policy tools in turn.
Reserve Requirements  One way the Fed can influence the reserve ratio is by 
altering reserve requirements, the regulations that set the minimum amount 
of reserves that banks must hold against their deposits. Reserve requirements 
influence how much money the banking system can create with each dollar of 
reserves. An increase in reserve requirements means that banks must hold more 
reserves and, therefore, can loan out less of each dollar that is deposited. As a re-
sult, an increase in reserve requirements raises the reserve ratio, lowers the money 
multiplier, and decreases the money supply. Conversely, a decrease in reserve re-
quirements lowers the reserve ratio, raises the money multiplier, and increases the 
money supply.
The Fed changes reserve requirements only rarely because such changes 
disrupt the business of banking. When the Fed increases reserve requirements, 
for instance, some banks find themselves short of reserves, even though they have 
seen no change in deposits. As a result, they have to curtail lending until they 
build their level of reserves to the new required level. Moreover, in recent years, 
this particular tool has become less effective because many banks hold excess 
reserves (that is, more reserves than are required).

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
Paying Interest on Reserves  Traditionally, banks did not earn any interest on the 
reserves they held. In October 2008, however, the Fed began paying interest on 
reserves. That is, when a bank holds reserves on deposit at the Fed, the Fed now 
pays the bank interest on those deposits. This change gives the Fed another tool 
with which to influence the economy. The higher the interest rate on reserves, the 
more reserves banks will choose to hold. Thus, an increase in the interest rate on 
reserves will tend to increase the reserve ratio, lower the money multiplier, and 
lower the money supply.
29-4c Problems in Controlling the Money Supply
The Fed’s various tools—open-market operations, bank lending, reserve 
requirements, and interest on reserves—have powerful effects on the money 
supply. Yet the Fed’s control of the money supply is not precise. The Fed must 
wrestle with two problems, each of which arises because much of the money 
supply is created by our system of fractional-reserve banking. 
The first problem is that the Fed does not control the amount of money that 
households choose to hold as deposits in banks. The more money households 
deposit, the more reserves banks have, and the more money the banking system 
can create. The less money households deposit, the less reserves banks have, 
and the less money the banking system can create. To see why this is a problem, 
suppose that one day people lose confidence in the banking system and withdraw 
some of their deposits to hold more currency. When this happens, the banking 
system loses reserves and creates less money. The money supply falls, even 
without any Fed action.
The second problem of monetary control is that the Fed does not control the 
amount that bankers choose to lend. When money is deposited in a bank, it 
creates more money only when the bank loans it out. Because banks can choose 
to hold excess reserves instead, the Fed cannot be sure how much money the 
banking system will create. For instance, suppose that one day bankers become 
more cautious about economic conditions and decide to make fewer loans and 
hold greater reserves. In this case, the banking system creates less money than it 
otherwise would. Because of the bankers’ decision, the money supply falls.
Hence, in a system of fractional-reserve banking, the amount of money in the 
economy depends in part on the behavior of depositors and bankers. Because the 
Fed cannot control or perfectly predict this behavior, it cannot perfectly control 
the money supply. Yet if the Fed is vigilant, these problems need not be large. The 
Fed collects data on deposits and reserves from banks every week, so it quickly 
becomes aware of any changes in depositor or banker behavior. It can, therefore, 
respond to these changes and keep the money supply close to whatever level it 
chooses.

STUDY
BANK RUNS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY
Most likely you have never witnessed a bank run in real life, but you 
may have seen one depicted in movies such as Mary Poppins or It’s a 
Wonderful Life. A bank run occurs when depositors fear that a bank 
may be having financial troubles and “run” to the bank to withdraw 
their deposits. The United States has not seen a major bank run in recent history, 
but in the United Kingdom, a bank called Northern Rock experienced a run in 
2007 and, as a result, was eventually taken over by the government.
Bank runs are a problem for banks under fractional-reserve banking. Because a 
bank holds only a fraction of its deposits in reserve, it cannot satisfy withdrawal

requests from all depositors. Even if the bank is solvent (meaning that its assets 
exceed its liabilities), it will not have enough cash on hand to allow all depositors 
immediate access to all of their money. When a run occurs, the bank is forced to 
close its doors until some bank loans are repaid or until some lender of last resort 
(such as the Fed) provides it with the currency it needs to satisfy depositors.
Bank runs complicate the control of the money supply. An important example of 
this problem occurred during the Great Depression in the early 1930s. After a wave 
of bank runs and bank closings, households and bankers became more cautious. 
Households withdrew their deposits from banks, preferring to hold their money 
in the form of currency. This decision reversed the process of money creation, as 
bankers responded to falling reserves by reducing bank loans. At the same time, 
bankers increased their reserve ratios so that they would have enough cash on hand 
to meet their depositors’ demands in any future bank runs. The higher reserve ratio 
reduced the money multiplier, which further reduced the money supply. From 1929 
to 1933, the money supply fell by 28 percent, without the Federal Reserve taking 
any deliberate contractionary action. Many economists point to this massive fall 
in the money supply to explain the high unemployment and falling prices that 
prevailed during this period. (In future chapters, we examine the mechanisms by 
which changes in the money supply affect unemployment and prices.)
Here’s the story of how the Federal  
Reserve came into being.
The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story 
of How the Fed Was Created
By Roger Lowenstein
A
ccording to opinion surveys, no institu-
tion save the Internal Revenue Service is 
held in lower regard than the Federal Reserve. 
It’s also a font of conspiracy theories stoked 
by radical libertarians, who insist the Fed is 
debauching the currency and will ultimately 
bankrupt the country.
The Fed’s unpopularity would make sense 
if it had, say, failed to intervene and save the 
system during the 2008 financial crisis. But, 
in fact, the Fed did rescue the economy….
Nonetheless, dissatisfaction is alive in 
Congress, where various bills would strip the 
Fed’s autonomy and subject sensitive mone-
tary decisions to the scrutiny of elected poli-
ticians. Some bills would go even further and 
explore a return to the gold standard.
For central bank watchers, this dynamic — 
effective policy rewarded with populist scorn — 
is nothing new. In America, it has always been 
thus.
At Alexander Hamilton’s urging, Congress first 
chartered a national bank — the ur-Fed — in 
1791. However, Thomas Jefferson, who famously 
mistrusted banks (he thought agriculture more 
virtuous), and who was fearful of a strong cen-
tral government, opposed this development. After  
20 years, the Jeffersonians won and Congress let 
the charter expire.
This decision led to disaster: ruinous  
inflation. So Congress chartered a Second 
Bank of the United States, which began in 
1817, providing the growing country with a 
better, more uniform currency and improved 
its public finances. But success couldn’t save 
it. Andrew Jackson despised the Second Bank 
as a tool of East Coast elites, and it too was 
abolished.
For most of the 19th century, the U.S., 
unlike most nations in Europe, did not have 
a lender of last resort. Frequent panics and 
credit shortages were the result. Yet some 
of the very people who could have benefited 
most from a central bank, such as farmers 
who were starved for credit, preferred the 
status quo. Like Jackson and Jefferson before 
them, they were fearful that a government 
bank would tyrannize the people, perhaps in 
cahoots with Wall Street.
After a financial panic in 1907 virtually 
shut down the banking system, reformers 
began to press once more for a central bank. 
But popular mistrust remained so pronounced 
that they were afraid to go public.
This is the point — 105 years ago — 
when the story seems to have been hijacked 
by a future Hollywood scriptwriter.
On a November evening in 1910, a power-
ful senator, Rhode Island Republican Nelson 
W. Aldrich, boarded his private rail car near

CHAPTER 29   THE MONETARY SYSTEM
Today, bank runs are not a major problem for the U.S. banking system or the Fed. 
The federal government now guarantees the safety of deposits at most banks, primarily 
through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Depositors do not make 
runs on their banks because they are confident that, even if their bank goes bankrupt, 
the FDIC will make good on the deposits. The policy of government deposit insurance 
has costs: Bankers whose deposits are guaranteed may have too little incentive to 
avoid bad risks when making loans. But one benefit of deposit insurance is a more 
stable banking system. As a result, most people see bank runs only in the movies. ●
29-4d The Federal Funds Rate
If you read about U.S. monetary policy in the newspaper, you will find much 
discussion of the federal funds rate. This raises several questions:
Q: 
What is the federal funds rate?
A: 
 The federal funds rate is the short-term interest rate that banks charge one 
another for loans. If one bank finds itself short of reserves while another 
bank has excess reserves, the second bank can lend some reserves to the 
first. The loans are temporary—typically overnight. The price of the loan is 
the federal funds rate.

New York. A light snow was falling, muting the 
hushed, conspiratorial tones of his guests, 
which is exactly how Aldrich wanted it.
The reform-minded banker Paul Warburg, 
one of his guests, was toting a hunting rifle, 
but he had no interest in hunting. The party 
also included a member of the powerful  
Morgan bank, as well as an assistant U.S. 
Treasury secretary, and Frank Vanderlip, head 
of the country’s largest bank, National City.
“On what sort of errand are we going?” 
Vanderlip inquired.
“It may be a wild-goose chase; it may the 
biggest thing you and I ever did,” Warburg 
replied.
Masquerading as duck hunters, they dis-
embarked in Brunswick, Ga., and traveled by 
launch to Jekyll Island, home of an exclusive 
club surrounded by pine and palmetto groves. 
Over the course of a week, Aldrich and his 
bankers mapped out a draft of what was to 
become the Federal Reserve Act, changing the 
U.S. economy forever.
Congress was never told that Aldrich’s 
bill had been drafted by Wall Street moguls. 
His bill did not pass, but it was the basis 
of a successor bill, the Federal Reserve Act, 
which Woodrow Wilson signed in 1913. Years 
later, when the Jekyll trip was revealed to 
the public, extremists seized on this strang-
er-than-fiction episode to bolster their claim 
that the Fed was a bankers’ plot against the 
American people. For conspiracy theorists, 
the bankers’ conclave on Jekyll became a 
metaphor for the Fed itself. The obvious irony 
is that, fearing Americans’ irrational suspi-
cion of central banking, Aldrich and his crew 
resorted to a plot that, ultimately, deepened 
the country’s paranoia.
Despite their clandestine tactics, the 
financiers’ motives were actually patriotic. 
Aldrich had visited Europe and studied 
its central banks. He wanted expert help 
to draft an American equivalent. And in  
between sumptuous meals featuring wild 
turkey and freshly scalloped oysters, his 
group of wealthy bankers earnestly wrestled 
with issues that still provoke us today: How 
should power over the economy be appor-
tioned between Washington and localities? 
How should the central bank set interest 
rates and the money supply?
The Federal Reserve today is not per-
fect. But it is more transparent than ever, 
thanks to reforms instituted by the previous 
chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and it is no less 
necessary than was a central bank in 1791. 
Americans’ paranoia is unjustified, just as it 
has always been. ■

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
Q: 
How is the federal funds rate different from the discount rate?
A: 
 The discount rate is the interest rate banks pay to borrow directly from 
the Federal Reserve through the discount window. Borrowing reserves 
from  another bank in the federal funds market is an alternative to borrow-
ing  reserves from the Fed, and a bank short of reserves will typically do 
 whichever is cheaper. In practice, the discount rate and the federal funds 
rate move closely together.
Q: 
Does the federal funds rate matter only for banks?
A: 
 Not at all. Although only banks borrow directly in the federal funds market, 
the economic impact of this market is much broader. Because different parts 
of the financial system are highly interconnected, interest rates on different 
kinds of loans are strongly correlated with one another. So when the federal 
funds rate rises or falls, other interest rates often move in the same direction.
Q: 
What does the Federal Reserve have to do with the federal funds rate?
A: 
 In recent years, the Federal Reserve has set a target goal for the federal funds 
rate. When the Federal Open Market Committee meets approximately  every 
6 weeks, it decides whether to raise or lower that target. 
Q: 
How can the Fed make the federal funds rate hit the target it sets?
A: 
 Although the actual federal funds rate is set by supply and demand in the 
market for loans among banks, the Fed can use open-market operations 
to influence that market. For example, when the Fed buys bonds in open- 
market operations, it injects reserves into the banking system. With more 
reserves in the system, fewer banks find themselves in need of borrowing 
reserves to meet reserve requirements. The fall in demand for borrowing 
reserves decreases the price of such borrowing, which is the federal funds 
rate. Conversely, when the Fed sells bonds and withdraws reserves from the 
banking system, more banks find themselves short of reserves, and they bid 
up the price of borrowing reserves. Thus, open-market purchases lower the 
federal funds rate, and open-market sales raise the federal funds rate.
Q: 
But don’t these open-market operations affect the money supply?
A: 
 Yes, absolutely. When the Fed announces a change in the federal funds rate, it is 
committing itself to the open-market operations necessary to make that change 
happen, and these open-market operations will alter the supply of money.  
Decisions by the FOMC to change the target for the federal funds rate are 
also decisions to change the money supply. They are two sides of the same 
coin. Other things being equal, a decrease in the target for the federal funds 
rate means an expansion in the money supply, and an increase in the target 
for the federal funds rate means a contraction in the money supply.

29-5 Conclusion
Some years ago, a book made the best-seller list with the title Secrets of the Temple: 
How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country. Though no doubt an exaggeration, this 
title did highlight the important role of the monetary system in our daily lives. 
Whenever we buy or sell anything, we are relying on the extraordinarily useful 
social convention called “money.” Now that we know what money is and what 
determines its supply, we can discuss how changes in the quantity of money affect 
the economy. We begin to address that topic in the next chapter.

CHAPTER QuickQuiz
r The term money refers to assets that people regularly 
use to buy goods and services.
r Money serves three functions. As a medium of exchange, 
it is the item used to make transactions. As a unit of 
account, it provides the way to record prices and other 
economic values. As a store of value, it offers a way to 
transfer purchasing power from the present to the future.
r Commodity money, such as gold, is money that has 
intrinsic value: It would be valued even if it were not 
used as money. Fiat money, such as paper dollars, is 
money without intrinsic value: It would be worthless if 
it were not used as money.
r In the U.S. economy, money takes the form of currency 
and various types of bank deposits, such as checking 
accounts. 
r The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United 
States, is responsible for regulating the U.S. monetary 
system. The Fed chair is appointed by the president 
and confirmed by Congress every 4 years. The chair 
is the head of the Federal Open Market Committee, 
which meets about every 6 weeks to consider changes 
in monetary policy.
r Bank depositors provide resources to banks by 
depositing their funds into bank accounts. These deposits 
are part of a bank’s liabilities. Bank owners also provide 
resources (called bank capital) for the bank. Because of 
leverage (the use of borrowed funds for investment), 
a small change in the value of a bank’s assets can lead 
to a large change in the value of the bank’s capital. To 
protect depositors, bank regulators require banks to hold 
a certain minimum amount of capital. 
r The Fed controls the money supply primarily through 
open-market operations: The purchase of government 
bonds increases the money supply, and the sale of 
government bonds decreases the money supply. The 
Fed also uses other tools to control the money supply. 
It can expand the money supply by decreasing the 
discount rate, increasing its lending to banks, lowering 
reserve requirements, or decreasing the interest rate 
on reserves. It can contract the money supply by 
increasing the discount rate, decreasing its lending to 
banks, raising reserve requirements, or increasing the 
interest rate on reserves.
r When individuals deposit money in banks and banks 
loan out some of these deposits, the quantity of money 
in the economy increases. Because the banking system 
influences the money supply in this way, the Fed’s 
control of the money supply is imperfect.

b. Now suppose that BSB’s largest depositor 
withdraws $10 million in cash from her account. If 
BSB decides to restore its reserve ratio by reducing 
the amount of loans outstanding, show its new 
T-account.
c. Explain what effect BSB’s action will have on 
other banks.
d. Why might it be difficult for BSB to take the action 
described in part (b)? Discuss another way for BSB 
to return to its original reserve ratio.
5. You take $100 you had kept under your mattress and 
deposit it in your bank account. If this $100 stays in 
the banking system as reserves and if banks hold 
reserves equal to 10 percent of deposits, by how much 
does the total amount of deposits in the banking 
system increase? By how much does the money 
supply increase? 
6. Happy Bank starts with $200 in bank capital. It then 
accepts $800 in deposits. It keeps 12.5 percent (1/8th) 
of deposits in reserve. It uses the rest of its assets to 
make bank loans.
a. Show the balance sheet of Happy Bank.
b. What is Happy Bank’s leverage ratio?
c. Suppose that 10 percent of the borrowers from 
Happy Bank default and these bank loans become 
worthless. Show the bank’s new balance sheet.
d. By what percentage do the bank’s total assets 
decline? By what percentage does the bank’s 
capital decline? Which change is larger? Why?
7. The Fed conducts a $10 million open-market purchase 
of government bonds. If the required reserve ratio is 
10 percent, what are the largest and smallest possible 
increases in the money supply that could result? 
Explain.
8. Assume that the reserve requirement is 5 percent. 
All other things being equal, will the money supply 
expand more if the Fed buys $2,000 worth of bonds 
or if someone deposits in a bank $2,000 that she had 
been hiding in her cookie jar? If one creates more, how 
much more does it create? Support your thinking.
9. Suppose that the reserve requirement for checking 
deposits is 10 percent and that banks do not hold any 
excess reserves.
a. If the Fed sells $1 million of government bonds, 
what is the effect on the economy’s reserves and 
money supply?
b. Now suppose the Fed lowers the reserve 
requirement to 5 percent, but banks choose to 
hold another 5 percent of deposits as excess 
reserves. Why might banks do so? What is the 
overall change in the money multiplier and the 
money supply as a result of these actions?
10. Assume that the banking system has total reserves of 
$100 billion. Assume also that required reserves are  
10 percent of checking deposits and that banks hold 
no excess reserves and households hold no currency.
a. What is the money multiplier? What is the money 
supply?
b. If the Fed now raises required reserves to  
20 percent of deposits, what are the change in 
reserves and the change in the money supply?
11. Assume that the reserve requirement is 20 percent. 
Also assume that banks do not hold excess reserves 
and there is no cash held by the public. The Fed 
decides that it wants to expand the money supply by 
$40 million. 
a. If the Fed is using open-market operations, will it 
buy or sell bonds?
b. What quantity of bonds does the Fed need to 
buy or sell to accomplish the goal? Explain your 
reasoning.

Money Growth and Inflation
CHAPTER
30
T
oday, if you want to buy an ice-cream cone, you need at least a couple of 
dollars, but that has not always been the case. In the 1930s, my grandmother 
ran a sweet shop in Trenton, New Jersey, where she sold ice-cream cones in 
two sizes. A cone with a small scoop of ice cream cost 3 cents. Hungry customers 
could buy a large scoop for a nickel.
You may not be surprised at the increase in the price of ice cream. In most 
modern economies, most prices tend to rise over time. This increase in the overall 
level of prices is called inflation. Earlier in the book, we examined how economists  

628
PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
measure the inflation rate as the percentage change in the consumer price 
index (CPI), the GDP deflator, or some other index of the overall price level. 
These price indexes show that, in the United States over the past 80 years, prices 
have risen on average 3.6 percent per year. Accumulated over so many years, a 3.6 
percent annual inflation rate leads to a seventeenfold increase in the price level. 
Inflation may seem natural and inevitable to a person who grew up in 
the United States during recent decades, but in fact, it is not inevitable at all. 
There were long periods in the 19th century during which most prices fell—a 
 phenomenon called deflation. The average level of prices in the U.S. economy was 
23 percent lower in 1896 than in 1880, and this deflation was a major issue in 
the presidential election of 1896. Farmers, who had accumulated large debts, suf-
fered when declines in crop prices reduced their incomes and thus their ability to 
pay off their debts. They advocated government policies to reverse the deflation.
Although inflation has been the norm in more recent history, there has been 
substantial variation in the rate at which prices rise. From 2005 to 2015, prices 
rose at an average rate of 1.2 percent per year. By contrast, in the 1970s, prices rose 
by 7.8 percent per year, which meant the price level more than doubled over the 
decade. The public often views such high rates of inflation as a major economic 
problem. In fact, when President Jimmy Carter ran for reelection in 1980, chal-
lenger Ronald Reagan pointed to high inflation as one of the failures of Carter’s 
economic policy. 
International data show an even broader range of inflation experiences. In 
2015, while the inflation rate in the United States was a mere 0.1 percent, it was 
1.5 percent in China, 4.9 percent in India, 15 percent in Russia, and 84 percent in  
Venezuela. And even the high inflation rates in Russia and Venezuela are mod-
erate by some standards. In February 2008, the central bank of Zimbabwe 
announced the inflation rate in its economy had reached 24,000 percent; some in-
dependent estimates put the figure even higher. An extraordinarily high rate of 
inflation such as this is called hyperinflation. 
What determines whether an economy experiences inflation and, if so, how 
much? This chapter answers this question by developing the quantity theory of 
money. Chapter 1 summarized this theory as one of the Ten Principles of Economics: 
Prices rise when the government prints too much money. This insight has a long 
and venerable tradition among economists. The quantity theory was discussed 
by the famous 18th-century philosopher and economist David Hume and was 
advocated more recently by the prominent economist Milton Friedman. This the-
ory can explain moderate inflations, such as those we have experienced in the 
United States, as well as hyperinflations. 
After developing a theory of inflation, we turn to a related question: Why is 
inflation a problem? At first glance, the answer to this question may seem  
obvious: Inflation is a problem because people don’t like it. In the 1970s, when the 
United States experienced a relatively high rate of inflation, opinion polls placed 
inflation as the most important issue facing the nation. President Ford echoed 
this sentiment in 1974 when he called inflation “public enemy number one.” Ford 
wore a “WIN” button on his lapel—for Whip Inflation Now.
But what, exactly, are the costs that inflation imposes on a society? The answer 
may surprise you. Identifying the various costs of inflation is not as straightfor-
ward as it first appears. As a result, although all economists decry hyperinflation, 
some economists argue that the costs of moderate inflation are not nearly as large 
as the public believes.

629
CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
30-1 The Classical Theory of Inflation
We begin our study of inflation by developing the quantity theory of money. This 
theory is often called “classical” because it was developed by some of the earliest 
economic thinkers. Most economists today rely on this theory to explain the long-
run determinants of the price level and the inflation rate.
30-1a The Level of Prices and the Value of Money
Suppose we observe that over some period of time the price of an ice-cream cone 
rises from a nickel to a dollar. What conclusion should we draw from the fact 
that people are willing to give up so much more money in exchange for a cone? 
It is possible that people have come to enjoy ice cream more (perhaps because 
some chemist has developed a miraculous new flavor). But that is probably not 
the case. It is more likely that people’s enjoyment of ice cream has stayed roughly 
the same and that, over time, the money used to buy ice cream has become less 
valuable. Indeed, the first insight about inflation is that it is more about the value 
of money than about the value of goods. 
This insight helps point the way toward a theory of inflation. When the 
consumer price index and other measures of the price level rise, commentators 
are often tempted to look at the many individual prices that make up these price 
indexes: “The CPI rose by 3 percent last month, led by a 20 percent rise in the 
price of coffee and a 30 percent rise in the price of heating oil.” Although this 
approach does contain some interesting information about what’s happening 
in the economy, it also misses a key point: Inflation is an economy-wide 
phenomenon that concerns, first and foremost, the value of the economy’s 
medium of exchange. 
The economy’s overall price level can be viewed in two ways. 
So far, we have viewed the price level as the price of a basket 
of goods and services. When the price level rises, people have to 
pay more for the goods and services they buy. Alternatively, we 
can view the price level as a measure of the value of money. A 
rise in the price level means a lower value of money because each 
dollar in your wallet now buys a smaller quantity of goods and 
services.
It may help to express these ideas mathematically. Suppose P 
is the price level as measured by the consumer price index or the 
GDP deflator. Then P measures the number of dollars needed to 
buy a basket of goods and services. Now turn this idea around: The 
quantity of goods and services that can be bought with $1 equals 
1/P. In other words, if P is the price of goods and services measured 
in terms of money, 1/P is the value of money measured in terms of 
goods and services. 
This mathematics is simplest to understand in an economy that produces 
only a single good, say, ice-cream cones. In that case, P would be the price of a 
cone. When the price of a cone (P) is $2, then the value of a dollar (1/P) is half 
a cone. When the price (P) rises to $3, the value of a dollar (1/P) falls to a third 
of a cone. The actual economy produces thousands of goods and services, so we 
use a price index rather than the price of a single good. But the logic remains the 
same: When the overall price level rises, the value of money falls.

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
30-1b Money Supply, Money Demand, and Monetary Equilibrium
What determines the value of money? The answer to this question, like many in 
economics, is supply and demand. Just as the supply and demand for bananas 
determines the price of bananas, the supply and demand for money determines 
the value of money. Thus, our next step in developing the quantity theory of 
money is to consider the determinants of money supply and money demand.
First consider money supply. In the preceding chapter, we discussed how the 
Federal Reserve, together with the banking system, determines the supply of 
money. When the Fed sells bonds in open-market operations, it receives dollars in 
exchange and contracts the money supply. When the Fed buys government bonds, 
it pays out dollars and expands the money supply. In addition, if any of these 
dollars are deposited in banks, which hold some as reserves and loan out the rest, 
the money multiplier swings into action, and these open-market operations can 
have an even greater effect on the money supply. For our purposes in this chapter, 
we ignore the complications introduced by the banking system and simply take 
the quantity of money supplied as a policy variable that the Fed controls.
Now consider money demand. Most fundamentally, the demand for money 
reflects how much wealth people want to hold in liquid form. Many factors 
influence the quantity of money demanded. The amount of currency that people 
hold in their wallets, for instance, depends on how much they rely on credit 
cards and on whether an automatic teller machine is easy to find. And as we 
will emphasize in Chapter 34, the quantity of money demanded depends on 
the interest rate that a person could earn by using the money to buy an interest-
bearing bond rather than leaving it in his wallet or low-interest checking account.
Although many variables affect the demand for money, one variable stands 
out in importance: the average level of prices in the economy. People hold money 
because it is the medium of exchange. Unlike other assets, such as bonds or stocks, 
people can use money to buy the goods and services on their shopping lists. How 
much money they choose to hold for this purpose depends on the prices of those 
goods and services. The higher prices are, the more money the typical transaction 
requires, and the more money people will choose to hold in their wallets and 
checking accounts. That is, a higher price level (a lower value of money) increases 
the quantity of money demanded.
What ensures that the quantity of money the Fed supplies balances the quantity 
of money people demand? The answer depends on the time horizon being 
considered. Later in this book, we examine the short-run answer and learn that 
interest rates play a key role. The long- run answer, however, is much simpler. In the 
long run, money supply and money demand are brought into equilibrium by the overall level 
of prices. If the price level is above the equilibrium level, people will want to hold 
more money than the Fed has created, so the price level must fall to balance supply 
and demand. If the price level is below the equilibrium level, people will want to 
hold less money than the Fed has created, and the price level must rise to balance 
supply and demand. At the equilibrium price level, the quantity of money that 
people want to hold exactly balances the quantity of money supplied by the Fed.
Figure 1 illustrates these ideas. The horizontal axis of this graph shows the 
quantity of money. The left vertical axis shows the value of money 1/P, and the 
right vertical axis shows the price level P. Notice that the price-level axis on the 
right is inverted: A low price level is shown near the top of this axis, and a high 
price level is shown near the bottom. This inverted axis illustrates that when the 
value of money is high (as shown near the top of the left axis), the price level is 
low (as shown near the top of the right axis).

631
CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
The two curves in this figure are the supply and demand curves for money. The 
supply curve is vertical because the Fed has fixed the quantity of money available. 
The demand curve for money slopes downward, indicating that when the value 
of money is low (and the price level is high), people demand a larger quantity of 
it to buy goods and services. At the equilibrium, shown in the figure as point A, 
the quantity of money demanded balances the quantity of money supplied. This 
equilibrium of money supply and money demand determines the value of money 
and the price level. 
30-1c The Effects of a Monetary Injection
Let’s now consider the effects of a change in monetary policy. To do so, imagine 
that the economy is in equilibrium and then, suddenly, the Fed doubles the supply 
of money by printing some dollar bills and dropping them around the country 
from helicopters. (Or, less dramatically and more realistically, the Fed could inject 
money into the economy by buying some government bonds from the public in 
open-market operations.) What happens after such a monetary injection? How 
does the new equilibrium compare to the old one?
Figure 2 shows what happens. The monetary injection shifts the supply curve 
to the right from MS1 to MS2, and the equilibrium moves from point A to point B. 
As a result, the value of money (shown on the left axis) decreases from 1/2 to 1/4, 
and the equilibrium price level (shown on the right axis) increases from 2 to 4. In 
other words, when an increase in the money supply makes dollars more plentiful, 
the result is an increase in the price level that makes each dollar less valuable.
This explanation of how the price level is determined and why it might change 
over time is called the quantity theory of money. According to the quantity 
theory, the quantity of money available in an economy determines the value of 
money, and growth in the quantity of money is the primary cause of inflation. As 
economist Milton Friedman once put it, “Inflation is always and everywhere a 
monetary phenomenon.” 
FIGURE 1
How the Supply and Demand for Money 
Determine the Equilibrium Price Level
The horizontal axis shows the quantity of 
money. The left vertical axis shows the 
value of money, and the right vertical 
axis shows the price level. The supply 
curve for money is vertical because the 
quantity of money supplied is fixed by 
the Fed. The demand curve for money 
slopes downward because people want 
to hold a larger quantity of money when 
each dollar buys less. At the equilibrium, 
point A, the value of money (on the left 
axis) and the price level (on the right 
axis) have adjusted to bring the quantity 
of money supplied and the quantity of 
money demanded into balance.

30-1d A Brief Look at the Adjustment Process
So far, we have compared the old equilibrium and the new equilibrium after 
an injection of money. How does the economy move from the old to the new 
equilibrium? A complete answer to this question requires an understanding 
of short-run fluctuations in the economy, which we examine later in this book. 
Here, we briefly consider the adjustment process that occurs after a change in the 
money supply.
The immediate effect of a monetary injection is to create an excess supply of 
money. Before the injection, the economy was in equilibrium (point A in Figure 2). 
At the prevailing price level, people had exactly as much money as they wanted. 
But after the helicopters drop the new money and people pick it up off the streets, 
people have more dollars in their wallets than they want. At the prevailing price 
level, the quantity of money supplied now exceeds the quantity demanded.
People try to get rid of this excess supply of money in various ways. They 
might use it to buy goods and services. Or they might use this excess money 
to make loans to others by buying bonds or by depositing the money in a bank 
savings account. These loans allow other people to buy goods and services. In 
either case, the injection of money increases the demand for goods and services.
The economy’s ability to supply goods and services, however, has not changed. 
As we saw in the chapter on production and growth, the economy’s output of 
goods and services is determined by the available labor, physical capital, human 
capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge. None of these is altered 
by the injection of money.
Thus, the greater demand for goods and services causes the prices of goods and 
services to increase. The increase in the price level, in turn, increases the quantity 
of money demanded because people are using more dollars for every transaction. 
Eventually, the economy reaches a new equilibrium (point B in Figure 2) at which 
the quantity of money demanded again equals the quantity of money supplied. 
FIGURE 2
An Increase in the Money 
Supply
When the Fed increases the 
supply of money, the money 
supply curve shifts from MS1  
to MS2. The value of money (on 
the left axis) and the price level 
(on the right axis) adjust  
to bring supply and demand 
back into balance. The 
equilibrium moves from point 
A to point B. Thus, when an 
increase in the money supply 
makes dollars more plentiful, 
the price level increases, making 
each dollar less valuable.

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
In this way, the overall price level for goods and services adjusts to bring money 
supply and money demand into balance.
30-1e The Classical Dichotomy and Monetary Neutrality
We have seen how changes in the money supply lead to changes in the average 
level of prices of goods and services. How do monetary changes affect other 
economic variables, such as production, employment, real wages, and real interest 
rates? This question has long intrigued economists, including David Hume in the 
18th century. 
Hume and his contemporaries suggested that economic variables should be 
divided into two groups. The first group consists of nominal variables—variables 
measured in monetary units. The second group consists of real variables—
variables measured in physical units. For example, the income of corn farmers 
is a nominal variable because it is measured in dollars, whereas the quantity of 
corn they produce is a real variable because it is measured in bushels. Nominal 
GDP is a nominal variable because it measures the dollar value of the economy’s 
output of goods and services; real GDP is a real variable because it measures the 
total quantity of goods and services produced and is not influenced by the current 
prices of those goods and services. The separation of real and nominal variables 
is now called the classical dichotomy. (A dichotomy is a division into two groups, 
and classical refers to the earlier economic thinkers.)
Applying the classical dichotomy is tricky when we turn to prices. Most prices 
are quoted in units of money and, therefore, are nominal variables. When we 
say that the price of corn is $2 a bushel or that the price of wheat is $1 a bushel, 
both prices are nominal variables. But what about a relative price—the price of 
one thing compared to another? In our example, we could say that the price of a 
bushel of corn is 2 bushels of wheat. This relative price is not measured in terms 
of money. When comparing the prices of any two goods, the dollar signs cancel, 
and the resulting number is measured in physical units. Thus, while dollar prices 
are nominal variables, relative prices are real variables.
This lesson has many applications. For instance, the real wage (the dollar wage 
adjusted for inflation) is a real variable because it measures the rate at which 
people exchange goods and services for a unit of labor. Similarly, the real interest 
rate (the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation) is a real variable because it 
measures the rate at which people exchange goods and services today for goods 
and services in the future.
Why separate variables into these groups? The classical dichotomy is useful 
because different forces influence real and nominal variables. According to 
classical analysis, nominal variables are influenced by developments in the 
economy’s monetary system, whereas money is largely irrelevant for explaining 
real variables.
This idea was implicit in our discussion of the real economy in the long run. In 
previous chapters, we examined how real GDP, saving, investment, real interest 
rates, and unemployment are determined without mentioning the existence of 
money. In that analysis, the economy’s production of goods and services depends 
on technology and factor supplies, the real interest rate balances the supply and 
demand for loanable funds, the real wage balances the supply and demand for 
labor, and unemployment results when the real wage is kept above the equilibrium 
level. These conclusions have nothing to do with the quantity of money supplied.
Changes in the supply of money, according to classical analysis, affect nominal 
variables but not real ones. When the central bank doubles the money supply, the

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
price level doubles, the dollar wage doubles, and all other dollar values double. 
Real variables, such as production, employment, real wages, and real interest 
rates, are unchanged. The irrelevance of monetary changes for real variables is 
called monetary neutrality. 
An analogy helps explain monetary neutrality. As the unit of account, money 
is the yardstick we use to measure economic transactions. When a central bank 
doubles the money supply, all prices double, and the value of the unit of account 
falls by half. A similar change would occur if the government were to reduce 
the length of the yard from 36 to 18 inches: With the new, shorter yardstick, all 
measured distances (nominal variables) would double, but the actual distances 
(real variables) would remain the same. The dollar, like the yard, is merely a unit 
of measurement, so a change in its value should not have real effects.
Is monetary neutrality realistic? Not completely. A change in the length of the 
yard from 36 to 18 inches would not matter in the long run, but in the short run, it 
would lead to confusion and mistakes. Similarly, most economists today believe 
that over short periods of time—within the span of a year or two—monetary 
changes affect real variables. Hume himself also doubted that monetary neutrality 
would apply in the short run. (We will study short-run non-neutrality later in the 
book, and this topic will help explain why the Fed changes the money supply 
over time.)
Yet classical analysis is right about the economy in the long run. Over the course 
of a decade, monetary changes have significant effects on nominal variables (such 
as the price level) but only negligible effects on real variables (such as real GDP). 
When studying long-run changes in the economy, the neutrality of money offers a 
good description of how the world works.
30-1f Velocity and the Quantity Equation
We can obtain another perspective on the quantity theory of money by considering 
the following question: How many times per year is the typical dollar bill used to 
pay for a newly produced good or service? The answer to this question is given 
by a variable called the velocity of money. In physics, the term velocity refers to 
the speed at which an object travels. In economics, the velocity of money refers to 
the speed at which the typical dollar bill travels around the economy from wallet 
to wallet.
To calculate the velocity of money, we divide the nominal value of output 
(nominal GDP) by the quantity of money. If P is the price level (the GDP deflator), 
Y the quantity of output (real GDP), and M the quantity of money, then velocity is 
V 5 (P 3 Y)/M.
To see why this makes sense, imagine a simple economy that produces only pizza. 
Suppose that the economy produces 100 pizzas in a year, that a pizza sells for $10, 
and that the quantity of money in the economy is $50. Then the velocity of money is 
V 5 ($10 3 100)/$50
5 20.
In this economy, people spend a total of $1,000 per year on pizza. For this $1,000 
of spending to take place with only $50 of money, each dollar bill must change 
hands on average 20 times per year.

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
With slight algebraic rearrangement, this equation can be rewritten as
M 3 V 5 P 3 Y.
This equation states that the quantity of money (M) times the velocity of money 
(V) equals the price of output (P) times the amount of output (Y). It is called the 
quantity equation because it relates the quantity of money (M) to the nominal 
value of output (P 3 Y). The quantity equation shows that an increase in the 
quantity of money in an economy must be reflected in one of the other three 
variables: The price level must rise, the quantity of output must rise, or the 
velocity of money must fall.
In many cases, it turns out that the velocity of money is relatively stable. For 
example, Figure 3 shows nominal GDP, the quantity of money (as measured by 
M2), and the velocity of money for the U.S. economy since 1960. During this 
period, the money supply and nominal GDP both increased more than thirtyfold. 
By contrast, the velocity of money, although not exactly constant, has not changed

the quantity of money,

and the dollar value of

GDP and the quantity of money have grown dramatically over this period, while velocity has 
been relatively stable.

dramatically. Thus, for some purposes, the assumption of constant velocity is a 
good approximation.
We now have all the elements necessary to explain the equilibrium price level 
and inflation rate. They are as follows:
1. The velocity of money is relatively stable over time.
2. Because velocity is stable, when the central bank changes the quantity of 
money (M), it causes proportionate changes in the nominal value of output  
(P 3 Y). 
 3. The economy’s output of goods and services (Y) is primarily determined by 
factor supplies (labor, physical capital, human capital, and natural resources) 
and the available production technology. In particular, because money is  
neutral, money does not affect output.
 4. With output (Y) determined by factor supplies and technology, when the  
central bank alters the money supply (M) and induces proportional changes in 
the nominal value of output (P 3 Y), these changes are reflected in changes in 
the price level (P). 
 5. Therefore, when the central bank increases the money supply rapidly, the  
result is a high rate of inflation.
These five steps are the essence of the quantity theory of money. 
CASE 
STUDY 
MONEY AND PRICES DURING FOUR HYPERINFLATIONS
Although earthquakes can wreak havoc on a society, they have 
the beneficial by-product of providing much useful data for 
seismologists. These data can shed light on alternative theories and, 
thereby, help society predict and deal with future threats. Similarly, hyperinflations 
offer monetary economists a natural experiment they can use to study the effects 
of money on the economy. 
Hyperinflations are interesting in part because the changes in the money supply 
and price level are so large. Indeed, hyperinflation is generally defined as inflation 
that exceeds 50 percent per month. This means that the price level increases more 
than 100-fold over the course of a year.
The data on hyperinflation show a clear link between the quantity of money and 
the price level. Figure 4 graphs data from four classic hyperinflations that occurred 
during the 1920s in Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Poland. Each graph shows the 
quantity of money in the economy and an index of the price level. The slope of the 
money line represents the rate at which the quantity of money was growing, and 
the slope of the price line represents the inflation rate. The steeper the lines, the 
higher the rates of money growth or inflation.
Notice that in each graph the quantity of money and the price level are almost 
parallel. In each instance, growth in the quantity of money is moderate at first and 
so is inflation. But over time, the quantity of money in the economy starts growing 
faster and faster. At about the same time, inflation also takes off. Then when the 
quantity of money stabilizes, the price level stabilizes as well. These episodes 
illustrate well one of the Ten Principles of Economics: Prices rise when the government 
prints too much money. ●

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
30-1g The Inflation Tax
If inflation is so easy to explain, why do countries experience hyperinflation? That 
is, why do the central banks of these countries choose to print so much money 
that its value is certain to fall rapidly over time?
The answer is that the governments of these countries are using money creation 
as a way to pay for their spending. When the government wants to build roads, 
pay salaries to its soldiers, or give transfer payments to the poor or elderly, it first 
has to raise the necessary funds. Normally, the government does this by levying 
taxes, such as income and sales taxes, and by borrowing from the public by selling 
government bonds. Yet the government can also pay for spending simply by 
printing the money it needs. 
When the government raises revenue by printing money, it is said to levy an 
inflation tax. The inflation tax is not exactly like other taxes, however, because no 
one receives a bill from the government for this tax. Instead, the inflation tax is 
inflation tax
the revenue the 
government raises by 
creating money
FIGURE 4
Money and Prices during 
Four Hyperinflations
This figure shows the quantity of money and the price level during four hyperinflations. 
(Note that these variables are graphed on logarithmic scales. This means that equal vertical 
distances on the graph represent equal percentage changes in the variable.) In each case, the 
quantity of money and the price level move closely together. The strong association between 
these two variables is consistent with the quantity theory of money, which states that growth 
in the money supply is the primary cause of inflation.

subtler. When the government prints money, the price level rises, and the dollars 
in your wallet become less valuable. Thus, the inflation tax is like a tax on everyone 
who holds money. 
The importance of the inflation tax varies from country to country and over time. 
In the United States in recent years, the inflation tax has been a trivial source of 
revenue: It has accounted for less than 3 percent of government revenue. During 
the 1770s, however, the Continental Congress of the fledgling United States 
relied heavily on the inflation tax to pay for military spending. Because the new 
government had a limited ability to raise funds through regular taxes or borrowing, 
printing dollars was the easiest way to pay the American soldiers. As the quantity 
theory predicts, the result was a high rate of inflation: Prices measured in terms of 
the continental dollar rose more than a 100-fold over a few years.
Almost all hyperinflations follow the same pattern as the hyperinflation during 
the American Revolution. The government has high spending, inadequate tax 
revenue, and limited ability to borrow. As a result, it turns to the printing press to 
pay for its spending. The massive increases in the quantity of money lead to massive 
inflation. The inflation ends when the government institutes fiscal reforms—such as 
cuts in government spending—that eliminate the need for the inflation tax.
Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe
D
uring the first decade of the 2000s, the nation of Zimbabwe 
experienced one of history’s most extreme examples of hyperinflation. 
In many ways, the story is common: Large government budget deficits led 
to the creation of large quantities of money and high rates of inflation. 
The hyperinflation ended in April 2009 when the Zimbabwe central bank 
stopped printing the Zimbabwe dollar and the nation started using 
foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the South African rand as 
the medium of exchange.
Estimates vary about how high inflation in Zimbabwe got, but the 
magnitude of the problem is well documented by the denomination of 
the notes being issued by the central bank. Before the hyperinflation 
started, the Zimbabwe dollar was worth a bit more than one U.S. dollar, 
so the denominations of the paper currency were similar to those one 
would find in the United States. A person might carry, for example, a 
10-dollar note in his wallet. In January 2008, however, after years of high 
inflation, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued notes worth 10 million 
Zimbabwe dollars, which was then equivalent to about 4 U.S. dollars. 
But even that did not prove to be large enough. A year later, the central 
bank announced it would issue notes worth 10 trillion Zimbabwe dollars, 
then worth about 3 U.S. dollars. 
As prices rose and the central bank printed ever-larger 
denominations of money, the older, smaller-denomination currency lost 
value and became almost 
worthless. One indication 
of this phenomenon can 
be found on this sign 
from a public restroom in 
Zimbabwe, shown below. ■

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
30-1h The Fisher Effect
According to the principle of monetary neutrality, an increase in the rate of 
money growth raises the rate of inflation but does not affect any real variable. An 
important application of this principle concerns the effect of money on interest 
rates. Interest rates are important variables for macroeconomists to understand 
because they link the economy of the present and the economy of the future 
through their effects on saving and investment.
To understand the relationship between money, inflation, and interest rates, 
recall the distinction between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate. 
The nominal interest rate is the interest rate you hear about at your bank. If you 
have a savings account, for instance, the nominal interest rate tells you how fast 
the number of dollars in your account will rise over time. The real interest rate
corrects the nominal interest rate for the effect of inflation to tell you how fast the 
purchasing power of your savings account will rise over time. The real interest 
rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate:
Real interest rate 5 Nominal interest rate 2 Inflation rate.
For example, if the bank posts a nominal interest rate of 7 percent per year and the 
inflation rate is 3 percent per year, then the real value of the deposits grows by 4 
percent per year.
We can rewrite this equation to show that the nominal interest rate is the sum 
of the real interest rate and the inflation rate: 
Nominal interest rate 5 Real interest rate 1 Inflation rate.
This way of looking at the nominal interest rate is useful because different 
economic forces determine each of the two terms on the right side of this equation. 
As we discussed earlier in the book, the supply and demand for loanable funds 
determine the real interest rate. And according to the quantity theory of money, 
growth in the money supply determines the inflation rate.
Let’s now consider how growth in the money supply affects interest rates. In 
the long run over which money is neutral, a change in money growth should not 
affect the real interest rate. The real interest rate is, after all, a real variable. For the 
real interest rate not to be affected, the nominal interest rate must adjust one-for-
one to changes in the inflation rate. Thus, when the Fed increases the rate of money 
growth, the long-run result is both a higher inflation rate and a higher nominal interest 
rate. This adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate is called the 
Fisher effect, after Irving Fisher (1867–1947), the economist who first studied it.
Keep in mind that our analysis of the Fisher effect has maintained a long-run 
perspective. The Fisher effect need not hold in the short run because inflation may 
be unanticipated. A nominal interest rate is a payment on a loan, and it is typically 
set when the loan is first made. If a jump in inflation catches the borrower and 
lender by surprise, the nominal interest rate they agreed on will fail to reflect 
the higher inflation. But if inflation remains high, people will eventually come 
to expect it, and loan agreements will reflect this expectation. To be precise, 
therefore, the Fisher effect states that the nominal interest rate adjusts to expected 
inflation. Expected inflation moves with actual inflation in the long run, but that 
is not necessarily true in the short run.
The Fisher effect is crucial for understanding changes over time in the nominal 
interest rate. Figure 5 shows the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate in 
Fisher effect

the U.S. economy since 1960. The close association between these two variables 
is clear. The nominal interest rate rose from the early 1960s through the 1970s 
because inflation was also rising during this time. Similarly, the nominal interest 
rate fell from the early 1980s through the 1990s because the Fed got inflation 
under control. In recent years, both the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate 
have been low by historical standards.

30-2 The Costs of Inflation
In the late 1970s, when the U.S. inflation rate reached about 10 percent per year, 
inflation dominated debates over economic policy. And even though inflation 
has been low over the past 20 years, it remains a closely watched macroeconomic 
variable. One study found that inflation is the economic term mentioned most 
often in U.S. newspapers (ahead of second-place finisher unemployment and third-
place finisher productivity).
Inflation is closely watched and widely discussed because it is thought to be a 
serious economic problem. But is that true? And if so, why?

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
30-2a A Fall in Purchasing Power? The Inflation Fallacy
If you ask the typical person why inflation is bad, he will tell you that the answer 
is obvious: Inflation robs him of the purchasing power of his hard-earned dollars. 
When prices rise, each dollar of income buys fewer goods and services. Thus, it 
might seem that inflation directly lowers living standards. 
Yet further thought reveals a fallacy in this answer. When prices rise, buyers of goods 
and services pay more for what they buy. At the same time, however, sellers of goods 
and services get more for what they sell. Because most people earn their incomes by 
selling their services, such as their labor, inflation in incomes goes hand in hand with 
inflation in prices. Thus, inflation does not in itself reduce people’s real purchasing power.
People believe the inflation fallacy because they do not appreciate the principle 
of monetary neutrality. A worker who receives an annual raise of 10 percent tends 
to view that raise as a reward for his own talent and effort. When an inflation rate of 
6 percent reduces the real value of that raise to only 4 percent, the worker might feel 
that he has been cheated of what is rightfully his due. In fact, as we discussed in the 
chapter on production and growth, real incomes are determined by real variables, 
such as physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and the available 
production technology. Nominal incomes are determined by those factors and the 
overall price level. If the Fed were to lower the inflation rate from 6 percent to zero, 
our worker’s annual raise would fall from 10 percent to 4 percent. He might feel 
less robbed by inflation, but his real income would not rise more quickly.
If nominal incomes tend to keep pace with rising prices, why then is inflation 
a problem? It turns out that there is no single answer to this question. Instead, 
economists have identified several costs of inflation. Each of these costs shows 
some way in which persistent growth in the money supply does, in fact, have 
some adverse effect on real variables.
30-2b Shoeleather Costs
As we have discussed, inflation is like a tax on the holders of money. The tax 
itself is not a cost to society: It is only a transfer of resources from households to 
the government. Yet most taxes give people an incentive to alter their behavior to 
avoid paying the tax, and this distortion of incentives causes deadweight losses 
for society as a whole. Like other taxes, the inflation tax also causes deadweight 
losses because people waste scarce resources trying to avoid it.
How can a person avoid paying the inflation tax? Because inflation erodes the 
real value of the money in your wallet, you can avoid the inflation tax by holding 
less money. One way to do this is to go to the bank more often. For example, 
rather than withdrawing $200 every four weeks, you might withdraw $50 once 
a week. By making more frequent trips to the bank, you can keep more of your 
wealth in your interest-bearing savings account and less in your wallet, where 
inflation erodes its value.
The cost of reducing your money holdings is called the shoeleather cost of 
inflation because making more frequent trips to the bank causes your shoes to 
wear out more quickly. Of course, this term is not to be taken literally: The actual 
cost of reducing your money holdings is not the wear and tear on your shoes but 
the time and convenience you must sacrifice to keep less money on hand than you 
would if there were no inflation.
The shoeleather costs of inflation may seem trivial. Indeed, they are in the U.S. 
economy, which has had only moderate inflation in recent years. But this cost is 
magnified in countries experiencing hyperinflation. Here is a description of one 
shoeleather costs

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
person’s experience in Bolivia during its hyperinflation (as reported in the August 
13, 1985, issue of The Wall Street Journal):
When Edgar Miranda gets his monthly teacher’s pay of 25 million pesos, he 
hasn’t a moment to lose. Every hour, pesos drop in value. So, while his wife 
rushes to market to lay in a month’s supply of rice and noodles, he is off 
with the rest of the pesos to change them into black-market dollars.
Mr. Miranda is practicing the First Rule of Survival amid the most 
out-of-control inflation in the world today. Bolivia is a case study of how 
runaway inflation undermines a society. Price increases are so huge that 
the figures build up almost beyond comprehension. In one six-month  
period, for example, prices soared at an annual rate of 38,000 percent. By 
official count, however, last year’s inflation reached 2,000 percent, and this 
year’s is expected to hit 8,000 percent—though other estimates range many 
times higher. In any event, Bolivia’s rate dwarfs Israel’s 370 percent and  
Argentina’s 1,100 percent—two other cases of severe inflation.
It is easier to comprehend what happens to the thirty-eight-year-old  
Mr. Miranda’s pay if he doesn’t quickly change it into dollars. The day he 
was paid 25 million pesos, a dollar cost 500,000 pesos. So he received $50. 
Just days later, with the rate at 900,000 pesos, he would have received $27. 
As this story shows, the shoeleather costs of inflation can be substantial. With the 
high inflation rate, Mr. Miranda does not have the luxury of holding the local 
money as a store of value. Instead, he is forced to convert his pesos quickly into 
goods or into U.S. dollars, which offer a more stable store of value. The time and 
effort that Mr. Miranda expends to reduce his money holdings are a waste of 
resources. If the monetary authority pursued a low-inflation policy, Mr. Miranda 
would be happy to hold pesos, and he could put his time and effort to more 
productive use. In fact, shortly after this article was written, the Bolivian inflation 
rate was reduced substantially with a more restrictive monetary policy.
30-2c Menu Costs
Most firms do not change the prices of their products every day. Instead, firms often 
announce prices and leave them unchanged for weeks, months, or even years. One 
survey found that the typical U.S. firm changes its prices about once a year.
Firms change prices infrequently because there are costs to changing prices. 
Costs of price adjustment are called menu costs, a term derived from a restaurant’s 
cost of printing a new menu. Menu costs include the costs of deciding on new 
prices, printing new price lists and catalogs, sending these new price lists and 
catalogs to dealers and customers, advertising the new prices, and even dealing 
with customer annoyance over price changes.
Inflation increases the menu costs that firms must bear. In the current U.S. 
economy, with its low inflation rate, annual price adjustment is an appropriate 
business strategy for many firms. But when high inflation makes firms’ costs 
rise rapidly, annual price adjustment is impractical. During hyperinflations, for 
example, firms must change their prices daily or even more often just to keep up 
with all the other prices in the economy. 
30-2d Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources
Suppose that the Eatabit Eatery prints a new menu with new prices every January 
and then leaves its prices unchanged for the rest of the year. If there is no inflation,

menu costs

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
economy—would be constant over the course of the year. By contrast, if the 
inflation rate is 12 percent per year, Eatabit’s relative prices will automatically 
fall by 1 percent each month. The restaurant’s relative prices will be high in the 
early months of the year, just after it has printed a new menu, and low in the later 
months. And the higher the inflation rate, the greater is this automatic variability. 
Thus, because prices change only once in a while, inflation causes relative prices 
to vary more than they otherwise would.
Why does this matter? The reason is that market economies rely on relative 
prices to allocate scarce resources. Consumers decide what to buy by comparing 
the quality and prices of various goods and services. Through these decisions, 
they determine how the scarce factors of production are allocated among 
industries and firms. When inflation distorts relative prices, consumer decisions 
are distorted and markets are less able to allocate resources to their best use.
30-2e Inflation-Induced Tax Distortions
Almost all taxes distort incentives, cause people to alter their behavior, and lead 
to a less efficient allocation of the economy’s resources. Many taxes, however, 
become even more problematic in the presence of inflation. The reason is that 
lawmakers often fail to take inflation into account when writing the tax laws. 
Economists who have studied the tax code conclude that inflation tends to raise 
the tax burden on income earned from savings. 
One example of how inflation discourages saving is the tax treatment of capital 
gains—the profits made by selling an asset for more than its purchase price. Suppose 
that in 1988 you used some of your savings to buy stock in IBM for $30 and that in 2016 
you sold the stock for $130. According to the tax law, you have earned a capital gain 
of $100, which you must include in your income when computing how much income 
tax you owe. But because the overall price level doubled from 1988 to 2016, the $30 you 
invested in 1988 is equivalent (in terms of purchasing power) to $60 in 2016. When you 
sell your stock for $130, you have a real gain (an increase in purchasing power) of only 
$70. The tax code, however, does not take account of inflation and assesses you a tax 
on a gain of $100. Thus, inflation exaggerates the size of capital gains and inadvertently 
increases the tax burden on this type of income.
Another example is the tax treatment of interest income. The income tax treats 
the nominal interest earned on savings as income, even though part of the nominal 
interest rate merely compensates for inflation. To see the effects of this policy, 
consider the numerical example in Table 1. The table compares two economies, 
both of which tax interest income at a rate of 25 percent. In Economy A, inflation 
is zero and the nominal and real interest rates are both 4 percent. In this case, the 
25 percent tax on interest income reduces the real interest rate from 4 percent to 
3 percent. In Economy B, the real interest rate is again 4 percent but the inflation 
rate is 8 percent. As a result of the Fisher effect, the nominal interest rate is 12 
percent. Because the income tax treats this entire 12 percent interest as income, 
the government takes 25 percent of it, leaving an after-tax nominal interest rate 
of only 9 percent and an after-tax real interest rate of only 1 percent. In this case, 
the 25 percent tax on interest income reduces the real interest rate from 4 percent 
to 1 percent. Because the after-tax real interest rate provides the incentive to save, 
saving is much less attractive in the economy with inflation (Economy B) than in 
the economy with stable prices (Economy A).
The taxes on nominal capital gains and on nominal interest income are two 
examples of how the tax code interacts with inflation. There are many others. 
Because of these inflation-induced tax changes, higher inflation tends to

discourage people from saving. Recall that the economy’s saving provides the 
resources for investment, which in turn is a key ingredient to long-run economic 
growth. Thus, when inflation raises the tax burden on saving, it tends to depress 
the economy’s long-run growth rate. There is, however, no consensus among 
economists about the size of this effect.
One solution to this problem, other than eliminating inflation, is to index the 
tax system. That is, the tax laws could be rewritten to take account of the effects 
of inflation. In the case of capital gains, for example, the tax code could adjust 
the purchase price using a price index and assess the tax only on the real gain. In 
the case of interest income, the government could tax only real interest income 
by excluding that portion of the interest income that merely compensates for 
inflation. To some extent, the tax laws have moved in the direction of indexation. 
For example, the income levels at which income tax rates change are adjusted 
automatically each year based on changes in the consumer price index. Yet many 
other aspects of the tax laws—such as the tax treatment of capital gains and 
interest income—are not indexed.
In an ideal world, the tax laws would be written so that inflation would not 
alter anyone’s real tax liability. In the real world, however, tax laws are far from 
perfect. More complete indexation would probably be desirable, but it would 
further complicate a tax code that many people already consider too complex. 
30-2f Confusion and Inconvenience
Imagine that we took a poll and asked people the following question: “This year 
the yard is 36 inches. How long do you think it should be next year?” Assuming 
we could get people to take us seriously, they would tell us that the yard should 
stay the same length—36 inches. Anything else would just complicate life 
needlessly.
What does this finding have to do with inflation? Recall that money, as the 
economy’s unit of account, is what we use to quote prices and record debts. 
In other words, money is the yardstick with which we measure economic 
transactions. The job of the Federal Reserve is a bit like the job of the Bureau of

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
Standards—to ensure the reliability of a commonly used unit of measurement. 
When the Fed increases the money supply and creates inflation, it erodes the real 
value of the unit of account.
It is difficult to judge the costs of the confusion and inconvenience that arise 
from inflation. Earlier, we discussed how the tax code incorrectly measures real 
incomes in the presence of inflation. Similarly, accountants incorrectly measure 
firms’ earnings when prices are rising over time. Because inflation causes dollars 
at different times to have different real values, computing a firm’s profit—the 
difference between its revenue and costs—is more complicated in an economy 
with inflation. Therefore, to some extent, inflation makes investors less able to 
sort successful from unsuccessful firms, which in turn impedes financial markets 
in their role of allocating the economy’s saving to alternative types of investment. 
30-2g  A Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation: Arbitrary 
Redistributions of Wealth
So far, the costs of inflation we have discussed occur even if inflation is steady and 
predictable. Inflation has an additional cost, however, when it comes as a surprise. 
Unexpected inflation redistributes wealth among the population in a way that 
has nothing to do with either merit or need. These redistributions occur because 
many loans in the economy are specified in terms of the unit of account—money. 
Consider an example. Suppose that Sam Student takes out a $20,000 loan at a 
7 percent interest rate from Bigbank to attend college. In 10 years, the loan will 
come due. After his debt has compounded for 10 years at 7 percent, Sam will 
owe Bigbank $40,000. The real value of this debt will depend on inflation over 
the decade. If Sam is lucky, the economy will have a hyperinflation. In this case, 
wages and prices will rise so high that Sam will be able to pay the $40,000 debt out 
of pocket change. By contrast, if the economy goes through a major deflation, then 
wages and prices will fall, and Sam will find the $40,000 debt a greater burden 
than he anticipated. 
This example shows that unexpected changes in prices redistribute wealth 
among debtors and creditors. A hyperinflation enriches Sam at the expense of 
Bigbank because it diminishes the real value of the debt; Sam can repay the loan 
in dollars that are less valuable than he anticipated. Deflation enriches Bigbank at 
Sam’s expense because it increases the real value of the debt; in this case, Sam has 
to repay the loan in dollars that are more valuable than he anticipated. If inflation 
were predictable, then Bigbank and Sam could take inflation into account when 
setting the nominal interest rate. (Recall the Fisher effect.) But if inflation is hard 
to predict, it imposes risk on Sam and Bigbank that both would prefer to avoid.
This cost of unexpected inflation is important to consider together with 
another fact: Inflation is especially volatile and uncertain when the average rate of 
inflation is high. This is seen most simply by examining the experience of different 
countries. Countries with low average inflation, such as Germany in the late 20th 
century, tend to have stable inflation. Countries with high average inflation, such 
as many countries in Latin America, tend to have unstable inflation. There are 
no known examples of economies with high, stable inflation. This relationship 
between the level and volatility of inflation points to another cost of inflation. If 
a country pursues a high-inflation monetary policy, it will have to bear not only 
the costs of high expected inflation but also the arbitrary redistributions of wealth 
associated with unexpected inflation.

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
30-2h Inflation Is Bad, but Deflation May Be Worse
In recent U.S. history, inflation has been the norm. But the level of prices has fallen 
at times, such as during the late 19th century and early 1930s. From 1998 to 2012, 
Japan experienced a 4-percent decline in its overall price level. So as we conclude 
our discussion of the costs of inflation, we should briefly consider the costs of 
deflation as well.
Some economists have suggested that a small and predictable amount of 
deflation may be desirable. Milton Friedman pointed out that deflation would 
lower the nominal interest rate (via the Fisher effect) and that a lower nominal 
interest rate would reduce the cost of holding money. The shoeleather costs of 
holding money would, he argued, be minimized by a nominal interest rate close 
to zero, which in turn would require deflation equal to the real interest rate. This 
prescription for moderate deflation is called the Friedman rule.
Yet there are also costs of deflation. Some of these mirror the costs of inflation. 
For example, just as a rising price level induces menu costs and relative-price 
variability, so does a falling price level. Moreover, in practice, deflation is rarely 
as steady and predictable as Friedman recommended. More often, it comes as 
a surprise, resulting in the redistribution of wealth toward creditors and away 
from debtors. Because debtors are often poorer, these redistributions in wealth are 
particularly painful.
Perhaps most important, deflation often arises because of broader macroeconomic 
difficulties. As we will see in future chapters, falling prices result when some event, 
such as a monetary contraction, reduces the overall demand for goods and services 
in the economy. This fall in aggregate demand can lead to falling incomes and rising 
unemployment. In other words, deflation is often a symptom of deeper economic 
problems. 
CASE 
STUDY
THE WIZARD OF OZ AND THE FREE-SILVER DEBATE
As a child, you probably saw the movie The Wizard of Oz, based on a 
children’s book written in 1900. The movie and book tell the story of 
a young girl, Dorothy, who finds herself lost in a strange land far from 
home. You probably did not know, however, that some scholars believe that the 
story is actually an allegory about U.S. monetary policy in the late 19th century.
From 1880 to 1896, the price level in the U.S. economy fell by 23 percent. Because 
this event was unanticipated, it led to a major redistribution of wealth. Most 
farmers in the western part of the country were debtors. Their creditors were the 
bankers in the east. When the price level fell, it caused the real value of these debts 
to rise, which enriched the banks at the expense of the farmers.
According to Populist politicians of the time, the solution to the farmers’ problem 
was the free coinage of silver. During this period, the United States was operating 
with a gold standard. The quantity of gold determined the money supply and, 
thereby, the price level. The free-silver advocates wanted silver, as well as gold, 
to be used as money. If adopted, this proposal would have increased the money 
supply, pushed up the price level, and reduced the real burden of the farmers’ 
debts. 
The debate over silver was heated, and it was central to the politics of the 1890s. 
A common election slogan of the Populists was “We Are Mortgaged. All but 
Our Votes.” One prominent advocate of free silver was William Jennings Bryan,

the Democratic nominee for president in 1896. He is remembered in part for a 
speech at the Democratic Party’s nominating convention in which he said, “You 
shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not 
crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” Rarely since then have politicians waxed so 
poetic about alternative approaches to monetary policy. Nonetheless, Bryan lost the 
election to Republican William McKinley, and the United States remained on the 
gold standard.
L. Frank Baum, author of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was a midwestern 
journalist. When he sat down to write a story for children, he made the characters 
represent protagonists in the major political battle of his time. Here is how economic 
historian Hugh Rockoff, writing in the Journal of Political Economy in 1990, interprets 
the story:
Dorothy: 
Traditional American values
 
Toto: 
Prohibitionist party, also called the Teetotalers
 
Scarecrow: 
Farmers
Tin Woodsman: 
Industrial workers
 
Cowardly Lion: 
William Jennings Bryan
Munchkins: 
Citizens of the East
 
Wicked Witch of the East: 
Grover Cleveland
 Wicked Witch of the West: 
William McKinley
Wizard: 
 Marcus Alonzo Hanna, chairman of the  
Republican Party
Oz: 
Abbreviation for ounce of gold
 
Yellow Brick Road: 
Gold standard
At the end of Baum’s story, Dorothy does find her way home, but it is not by 
just following the yellow brick road. After a long and perilous journey, she learns 
that the wizard is incapable of helping her or her friends. Instead, Dorothy finally 
discovers the magical power of her silver slippers. (When the book was made 
into a movie in 1939, Dorothy’s slippers were changed from silver to ruby. The 
Hollywood filmmakers were more interested in showing off the new technology 
of Technicolor than in telling a story about 19th-century monetary policy.)
The Populists lost the debate over the free coinage of silver, but they eventually 
got the monetary expansion and inflation that they wanted. In 1898, prospectors 
discovered gold near the Klondike River in the Canadian Yukon. Increased 
supplies of gold also arrived from the mines of South Africa. As a result, the 
money supply and the price level started to rise in the United States and in other 
countries operating on the gold standard. Within 15 years, prices in the United 
States were back to the levels that had prevailed in the 1880s, and farmers were 
better able to handle their debts. ●

List and describe six costs of inflation.
30-3 Conclusion
This chapter discussed the causes and costs of inflation. The primary cause of 
inflation is growth in the quantity of money. When the central bank creates money 
in large quantities, the value of money falls quickly. To maintain stable prices, the 
central bank must maintain strict control over the money supply.

PART X   MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN
The costs of inflation are more subtle. They include shoeleather costs, menu 
costs, increased variability of relative prices, unintended changes in tax liabilities, 
confusion and inconvenience, and arbitrary redistributions of wealth. Are these 
costs, in total, large or small? All economists agree that they become huge during 
hyperinflation. But during periods of moderate inflation—when prices rise by 
less than 10 percent per year—the size of these costs is more open to debate.
This chapter presented many of the most important lessons about inflation, 
but the analysis is incomplete. When the central bank reduces the rate of money 
growth, prices rise less rapidly, as the quantity theory suggests. Yet as the economy 
makes the transition to the lower inflation rate, the change in monetary policy will 
likely disrupt production and employment. That is, even though monetary policy 
is neutral in the long run, it has profound effects on real variables in the short 
run. Later in this book we will examine the reasons for short-run monetary non-
neutrality to enhance our understanding of the causes and effects of inflation. 
1. The classical principle of monetary neutrality states 
that changes in the money supply do not influence 
________ variables and is thought most applicable in 
the ________ run.

2. If nominal GDP is $400, real GDP is $200, and the 
money supply is $100, then

c. the price level is 2, and velocity is 2.
d. the price level is 2, and velocity is 4.
3. According to the quantity theory of money, which vari-
able in the quantity equation is most stable over long 
periods of time?

large budget ________, which the central bank  
finances with a substantial monetary ________.
a. deficit, contraction
b. deficit, expansion

CHAPTER 30   MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION
r The overall level of prices in an economy adjusts to 
bring money supply and money demand into balance. 
When the central bank increases the supply of money, 
it causes the price level to rise. Persistent growth in 
the quantity of money supplied leads to continuing 
inflation.
r The principle of monetary neutrality asserts that 
changes in the quantity of money influence nominal 
variables but not real variables. Most economists 
believe that monetary neutrality approximately 
describes the behavior of the economy in the long run.
r A government can pay for some of its spending simply 
by printing money. When countries rely heavily on this 
“inflation tax,” the result is hyperinflation.
r One application of the principle of monetary neutrality 
is the Fisher effect. According to the Fisher effect, when 
the inflation rate rises, the nominal interest rate rises by 
the same amount so that the real interest rate remains 
the same. 
r Many people think that inflation makes them poorer 
because it raises the cost of what they buy. This view 
is a fallacy, however, because inflation also raises 
nominal incomes. 
r Economists have identified six costs of inflation: 
shoeleather costs associated with reduced money 
holdings, menu costs associated with more frequent 
adjustment of prices, increased variability of relative 
prices, unintended changes in tax liabilities due 
to nonindexation of the tax code, confusion and 
inconvenience resulting from a changing unit of 
account, and arbitrary redistributions of wealth 
between debtors and creditors. Many of these costs are 
large during hyperinflation, but the size of these costs 
for moderate inflation is less clear.

money?
b. If the Fed does not respond to this event, what 
will happen to the price level?
c. If the Fed wants to keep the price level stable,

of savings accounts are hurt by the increase in the 
inflation rate?
5. Let’s consider the effects of inflation in an economy 
composed of only two people: Bob, a bean farmer, and 
Rita, a rice farmer. Bob and Rita both always consume 
equal amounts of rice and beans. In 2016, the price of 
beans was $1 and the price of rice was $3.

and the price of rice was $6. What was inflation? 
Was Bob better off, worse off, or unaffected by the 
changes in prices? What about Rita?
b. Now suppose that in 2017 the price of beans 
was $2 and the price of rice was $4. What was 
inflation? Was Bob better off, worse off, or 
unaffected by the changes in prices? What about 
Rita?
c. Finally, suppose that in 2017 the price of beans 
was $2 and the price of rice was $1.50. What 
was inflation? Was Bob better off, worse off, or 
unaffected by the changes in prices? What about 
Rita?

inflation affect the ability of money to serve each of 
these functions?
8. Suppose that people expect inflation to equal 3 
percent, but in fact, prices rise by 5 percent. Describe 
how this unexpectedly high inflation rate would help

a. the government
b. a homeowner with a fixed-rate mortgage
c. a union worker in the second year of a labor 
contract
d. a college that has invested some of its endowment 
in government bonds
9. Explain whether the following statements are true, 
false, or uncertain.
a. “Inflation hurts borrowers and helps lenders, 
because borrowers must pay a higher rate of

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make everyone better off. International 
trade can raise living standards in all countries by allowing each country to 
specialize in producing those goods and services in which it has a comparative 
advantage.
So far, our development of macroeconomics has largely ignored the economy’s 
interaction with other economies around the world. For most questions in macro-
economics, international issues are peripheral. For instance, when we discuss the 
natural rate of unemployment and the causes of inflation, the effects of interna-
tional trade can safely be ignored. Indeed, to keep their models simple, macroeco-
nomists often assume a closed economy—an economy that does not interact with 
other economies.
Yet when macroeconomists study an open economy—an economy that inter-
acts freely with other economies around the world—they encounter a whole set of 
new issues. This chapter and the next provide an introduction to open-economy 
macroeconomics. We begin in this chapter by discussing the key macroeconomic 
variables that describe an open economy’s interactions in world markets. You 
may have noticed mention of these variables—exports, imports, the trade balance, 
and exchange rates—in the news. Our first job is to understand what these data 
mean. In the next chapter, we develop a model to explain how these variables are 
determined and how they are affected by various government policies.
31-1 The International Flows of Goods and Capital
An open economy interacts with other economies in two ways: It buys and sells 
goods and services in world product markets, and it buys and sells capital assets 
such as stocks and bonds in world financial markets. Here we discuss these two 
activities and the close relationship between them.
31-1a The Flow of Goods: Exports, Imports, and Net Exports
Exports are domestically produced goods and services that are sold abroad, and 
imports are foreign-produced goods and services that are sold domestically. When 
Boeing, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer, builds a plane and sells it to Air France, the 
sale is an export for the United States and an import for France. When Volvo, the 
Swedish car manufacturer, makes a car and sells it to a U.S. resident, the sale is an 
import for the United States and an export for Sweden.
The net exports of any country are the difference between the value of its 
exports and the value of its imports:
Net exports 5 Value of country’s exports 2 Value of country’s imports.
The Boeing sale raises U.S. net exports, and the Volvo sale reduces U.S. net 
exports. Because net exports tell us whether a country is, in total, a seller or 
a buyer in world markets for goods and services, net exports are also called 
the trade balance. If net exports are positive, exports are greater than imports, 
indicating that the country sells more goods and services abroad than it buys 
from other countries. In this case, the country is said to run a trade surplus. 
If net exports are negative, exports are less than imports, indicating that the 
country sells fewer goods and services abroad than it buys from other countries. 
In this case, the country is said to run a trade deficit. If net exports are zero,

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
its exports and imports are exactly equal, and the country is said to have 
balanced trade.
In the next chapter, we develop a theory that explains an economy’s trade 
balance, but even at this early stage, it is easy to think of many factors that might 
influence a country’s exports, imports, and net exports. Those factors include the 
following:
• The tastes of consumers for domestic and foreign goods
• The prices of goods at home and abroad
• The exchange rates at which people can use domestic currency to  
buy foreign currencies
• The incomes of consumers at home and abroad
• The cost of transporting goods from country to country
• Government policies toward international trade
As these variables change, so does the amount of international trade.

CASE 
STUDY
THE INCREASING OPENNESS OF THE U.S. ECONOMY
One dramatic change in the U.S. economy over the past six decades 
has been the increasing importance of international trade and 
finance. This change is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the total 
value of goods and services exported to other countries and imported from other 
countries expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product. In the 1950s, 
imports and exports of goods and services were typically between 4 and 5 percent 
of GDP. In recent years, they have been about three times that level. The trading 
partners of the United States include a diverse group of countries. As of 2015, 
the largest trading partner, as measured by imports and exports combined, was 
China, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and the 
United Kingdom.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
The political maneuvering over the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2015  
is a good example of how difficult  
ratifying a trade deal can be.
The Great Trans-Pacific  
Partnership Debate
By Doyle McManus
T
he White House released the text of its new 
trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 
last week, and like any good citizen, I tried my 
best to read it. But the 12-country agreement 
is more than 2,700 pages long, plus annexes, 
and a lot of it sounds like this: “The parties 
shall at all times endeavor to agree on the 
interpretation and application of this agree-
ment, and shall make every attempt through 
cooperation and consultations to arrive at a 
mutually satisfactory resolution.”
And that’s one of the lucid bits. Those 
members of Congress who say they’ve read 
the whole thing? They’re fibbing.
There are three ways a befuddled citizen 
can figure out what to think about a complex 
deal like the TPP.
The first is tribal: Listen for signals from 
the politicians you support and assume 
they’ve made the right decisions. But that’s 
not so easy when it comes to the TPP because 
the agreement divides both parties.
It’s no surprise that President Obama is 
strongly in favor of a deal he and his aides 
just finished negotiating. “It’s an agreement 
that puts American workers first and will help 
middle-class families get ahead,” he said. “It 
includes the strongest commitments on labor 
and the environment of any trade agreement 
in history.” The Democratic presidential can-
didates don’t agree. Bernie Sanders says the 
TPP is “even worse” than he expected. Hillary 
Rodham Clinton opposes it too, and hopes 
you’ll forget that she once called it “the gold 
standard” of trade deals.
Among Republicans, “establishment” 
candidates Jeb Bush and John Kasich support 
the agreement, as do Ben Carson and Marco 
Rubio. But Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have 
said they are opposed.
A second approach is to listen to what in-
terested parties say and choose sides based 
on where your sympathies lie.
Manufacturing workers and their unions 
think another free-trade deal will inevitably 
hurt them. The last half-century of global-
ization has coincided with a massive loss of 
blue-collar jobs; not all of the erosion was 
due to trade, but to labor, the TPP looks like 
more of the same. “A bad deal for American 
workers,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka 
said.
Environmentalists are condemning the 
deal too, mostly because it doesn’t crack 
The Complicated Politics of Trade Agreements
IN THE NEWS
The increase in international trade over the past several decades is partly due 
to improvements in transportation. In 1950, the average merchant ship carried 
less than 10,000 tons of cargo; today, many ships carry more than 100,000 tons. 
The long-distance jet was introduced in 1958 and the wide-body jet in 1967, 
making air transport far cheaper than it had been previously. These developments 
allow goods that once had to be produced locally to be traded around the world. 
Cut flowers grown in Israel are flown to the United States to be sold. Fresh fruits 
and vegetables that can grow only in summer in the United States can now be 
consumed in winter as well because they can be shipped from countries in the 
Southern Hemisphere. 
The increase in international trade has also been influenced by advances in 
telecommunications, which have allowed businesses to reach overseas customers 
more easily. For example, the first transatlantic telephone cable was not laid 
until 1956. As recently as 1966, the technology allowed only 138 simultaneous 
conversations between North America and Europe. Today, because e-mail is such 
a common form of business communication, it is almost as easy to communicate 
with a customer across the world as it is to communicate with one across town. 
Technological progress has also fostered international trade by changing the 
kinds of goods that economies produce. When bulky raw materials (such as steel) 
and perishable goods (such as foodstuffs) were a large part of the world’s output,

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
transporting goods was often costly and sometimes impossible. By contrast, 
goods produced with modern technology are often light and easy to transport. 
Consumer electronics, for instance, have low weight for every dollar of value, 
which makes them easy to produce in one country and sell in another. An even 
more extreme example is the film industry. Once a studio in Hollywood makes 
a movie, it can send copies of the film around the world at almost zero cost. And 
indeed, movies are a major export of the United States.
Governments’ trade policies have also been a factor in increasing international 
trade. As we discussed earlier in this book, economists have long believed that 
free trade between countries is mutually beneficial. Over time, most policymakers 
around the world have come to accept these conclusions. International 
agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have gradually lowered tariffs, 
import quotas, and other trade barriers. As this book was going to press, the 
United States was debating whether to ratify a new trade agreement—the Trans-
Pacific Partnership—which President Obama’s representatives had negotiated 
with eleven other Pacific Rim nations. (See the accompanying In the News box.) 
Thus, the pattern of increasing trade illustrated in Figure 1 is a phenomenon that 
most economists and policymakers endorse and encourage. ●
down on climate change. But this is, after 
all, a trade deal; talks on global warming are  
already underway.
Big business is mostly in favor of the deal, 
although not universally so. Tobacco compa-
nies are unhappy that it deprives them of the 
right to sue countries that restrict trade by lim-
iting cigarette sales. Pharmaceutical compa-
nies complain that they aren’t getting enough 
protection for their patents. (Doctors Without 
Borders thinks they are getting too much.)
Hollywood, Silicon Valley and agribusi-
ness mostly like the deal, which protects 
entertainment copyrights, eases the flow of 
data across borders and opens doors for U.S. 
exports of meat and rice to Asia.  California 
would reap benefits that the Rust Belt  
won’t see.
Now for the final, labor-intensive  
approach: Listen to smart people who don’t 
have a vested interest but are trying to ana-
lyze the deal in a comprehensive way.
For a start, I consulted with Joseph A. 
Massey, a former U.S. trade negotiator with 
China and Japan who has served as an advi-
sor to Republicans and Democrats.
Massey made three points.
First, he said, the TPP’s impact has 
probably been oversold. “It has benefits for 
U.S. export industries, but I think they’re 
modest,” he said. “It’s clearly good for the 
entertainment and tech sectors. But it’s not 
revolutionary.”
Second, he said, the biggest threat to jobs 
in the United States isn’t free-trade agree-
ments; it’s domestic policy. “We’ve neglected 
our own manufacturing sector,” he said. 
“Germany is a party to trade agreements too, 
but they’ve done a much better job at main-
taining a skilled blue-collar workforce. We 
need more incentives for companies to invest 
here, employ American workers and invest in 
their training.”
Third, he noted, the TPP isn’t only about 
trade. It’s also about economic reform, 
higher labor standards and environmental 
protection in developing countries such 
as Vietnam and Malaysia. And it’s a way 
to knit countries on the Pacific Rim into 
a trading system that the United States 
helped design instead of one run by Asia’s 
growing power, China.
Obama hasn’t been subtle about pushing 
that geopolitical argument. “If we don’t pass 
this agreement—if America doesn’t write 
those rules—then countries like China will,” 
he said last week.
To foreign policy strategists, that’s a com-
pelling pitch. To American workers, it’s not.
So are we better off with or without the 
TPP? If Congress ratifies it, that won’t turbo-
charge the U.S. economy. If Congress blocks 
the deal, that won’t stop globalization. And 
like any trade agreement, it creates winners 
and losers.
One political lesson is clear: The biparti-
san consensus that enabled Bill Clinton and 
George W. Bush to pass trade agreements has 
broken down, mostly because, to many Ameri-
cans, their costs have been clearer than their 
benefits.
To win Congress’ approval of the deal—
an important part of Obama’s second-term 
agenda and his legacy—the president still 
has a lot of persuading to do. ■

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
31-1b The Flow of Financial Resources: Net Capital Outflow
So far, we discussed how residents of an open economy participate in world 
markets for goods and services. In addition, residents of an open economy 
participate in world financial markets. A U.S. resident with $25,000 could use that 
money to buy a car from Toyota or, instead, to buy stock in the Toyota Corporation. 
The first transaction would represent a flow of goods, whereas the second would 
represent a flow of capital.
The term net capital outflow refers to the difference between the purchase 
of foreign assets by domestic residents and the purchase of domestic assets by 
foreigners:
Net capital outflow 5 Purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents  
                                 2 Purchase of domestic assets by foreigners.
When a U.S. resident buys stock in Petrobras, the Brazilian energy company, the 
purchase increases the first term on the right side of this equation and, therefore, 
increases U.S. net capital outflow. When a Japanese resident buys a bond issued 
by the U.S. government, the purchase increases the second term on the right side 
of this equation and, therefore, decreases U.S. net capital outflow.
The flow of capital between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world takes 
two forms. If McDonald’s opens up a fast-food outlet in Russia, that is an example 
of foreign direct investment. Alternatively, if an American buys stock in a Russian 
corporation, that is an example of foreign portfolio investment. In the first case, the 
American owner (McDonald’s Corporation) actively manages the investment, 
whereas in the second case, the American owner (the stockholder) has a more 
passive role. In both cases, U.S. residents are buying assets located in another 
country, so both purchases increase U.S. net capital outflow.
The net capital outflow (sometimes called net foreign investment) can be either 
positive or negative. When it is positive, domestic residents are buying more 
foreign assets than foreigners are buying domestic assets. Capital is said to be 
flowing out of the country. When the net capital outflow is negative, domestic 
residents are buying less foreign assets than foreigners are buying domestic assets. 
Capital is said to be flowing into the country. That is, when net capital outflow is 
negative, a country is experiencing a capital inflow. 
We develop a theory to explain net capital outflow in the next chapter. Here 
let’s consider briefly some of the more important variables that influence net 
capital outflow:
• The real interest rates paid on foreign assets
• The real interest rates paid on domestic assets
• The perceived economic and political risks of holding assets abroad
• The government policies that affect foreign ownership of domestic assets
For example, consider U.S. investors deciding whether to buy Mexican 
government bonds or U.S. government bonds. (Recall that a bond is, in effect, an 
IOU of the issuer.) To make this decision, U.S. investors compare the real interest 
rates offered on the two bonds. The higher a bond’s real interest rate, the more 
attractive it is. While making this comparison, however, U.S. investors must also 
take into account the risk that one of these governments might default on its debt 
(that is, not pay interest or principal when it is due), as well as any restrictions

that the Mexican government has imposed, or might impose in the future, on 
foreign investors in Mexico.
31-1c The Equality of Net Exports and Net Capital Outflow
We have seen that an open economy interacts with the rest of the world in two 
ways—in world markets for goods and services and in world financial markets. 
Net exports and net capital outflow each measure a type of imbalance in these 
markets. Net exports measure an imbalance between a country’s exports and 
its imports. Net capital outflow measures an imbalance between the amount of 
foreign assets bought by domestic residents and the amount of domestic assets 
bought by foreigners.
An important but subtle fact of accounting states that, for an economy as a 
whole, net capital outflow (NCO) must always equal net exports (NX):
NCO 5 NX.
This equation holds because every transaction that affects one side of this equation 
affects the other side by exactly the same amount. This equation is an identity—an 
equation that must hold because of how the variables in the equation are defined 
and measured.
To see why this accounting identity is true, let’s consider an example. Imagine 
that you are a computer programmer residing in the United States. One day, you 
write some software and sell it to a Japanese consumer for 10,000 yen. The sale of 
software is an export of the United States, so it increases U.S. net exports. What 
else happens to ensure that this identity holds? The answer depends on what you 
do with the 10,000 yen you are paid.
First, let’s suppose that you simply stuff the yen in your mattress. (We might 
say you have a yen for yen.) In this case, you are using some of your income to 
invest in the Japanese economy. That is, a domestic resident (you) has acquired a 
foreign asset (the Japanese currency). The increase in U.S. net exports is matched 
by an increase in the U.S. net capital outflow.
More realistically, however, if you want to invest in the Japanese economy, you 
won’t do so by holding on to Japanese currency. More likely, you would use the 
10,000 yen to buy stock in a Japanese corporation, or you might buy a Japanese 
government bond. Yet the result of your decision is much the same: A domestic 
resident ends up acquiring a foreign asset. The increase in U.S. net capital outflow 
(the purchase of the Japanese stock or bond) exactly equals the increase in U.S. net 
exports (the sale of software).
Let’s now change the example. Suppose that instead of using the 10,000 yen 
to buy a Japanese asset, you use them to buy a good made in Japan, such as a 
Sony TV. As a result of the TV purchase, U.S. imports increase. Together, the 
software export and the TV import represent balanced trade. Because exports and 
imports increase by the same amount, net exports are unchanged. In this case, no 
American ends up acquiring a foreign asset and no foreigner ends up acquiring a 
U.S. asset, so there is also no impact on U.S. net capital outflow. 
A final possibility is that you go to a local bank to exchange your 10,000 yen 
for U.S. dollars. But this doesn’t change the situation because the bank now 
has to do something with the 10,000 yen. It can buy Japanese assets (a U.S. net 
capital outflow); it can buy a Japanese good (a U.S. import); or it can sell the yen 
to another American who wants to make such a transaction. In the end, U.S. net 
exports must equal U.S. net capital outflow.

660
PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
This example all started when a U.S. programmer sold some software abroad, 
but the story is much the same when Americans buy goods and services from other 
countries. For example, if Walmart buys $50 million of clothing from China and 
sells it to American consumers, something must happen to that $50 million. One 
possibility is that China could use the $50 million to invest in the U.S. economy. 
This capital inflow from China might take the form of Chinese purchases of U.S. 
government bonds. In this case, the purchase of the clothing reduces U.S. net 
exports, and the sale of bonds reduces U.S. net capital outflow. Alternatively, China 
could use the $50 million to buy a plane from Boeing, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer. 
In this case, the U.S. import of clothing balances the U.S. export of aircraft, so net 
exports and net capital outflow are both unchanged. In all cases, the transactions 
have the same effect on net exports and net capital outflow.
We can summarize these conclusions for the economy as a whole. 
• When a nation is running a trade surplus (NX . 0), it is selling more goods 
and services to foreigners than it is buying from them. What is it doing 
with the foreign currency it receives from the net sale of goods and services 
abroad? It must be using it to buy foreign assets. Capital is flowing out of the 
country (NCO . 0).
• When a nation is running a trade deficit (NX , 0), it is buying more goods 
and services from foreigners than it is selling to them. How is it financing the 
net purchase of these goods and services in world markets? It must be selling 
assets abroad. Capital is flowing into the country (NCO , 0).
The international flow of goods and services and the international flow of capital 
are two sides of the same coin.
31-1d  Saving, Investment, and Their Relationship  
to the International Flows
A nation’s saving and investment are crucial to its long-run economic growth. 
As we saw in an earlier chapter, saving and investment are equal in a closed 
economy. But matters are not as simple in an open economy. Let’s now consider 
how saving and investment are related to the international flows of goods and 
capital as measured by net exports and net capital outflow. 
As you may recall, the term net exports appeared earlier in the book when 
we discussed the components of gross domestic product. The economy’s GDP 
(denoted Y) is divided among four components: consumption (C), investment (I), 
government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). We write this as
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
Total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services is the sum of 
expenditure on consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. 
Because each dollar of expenditure is placed into one of these four components, 
this equation is an accounting identity: It must be true because of the way the 
variables are defined and measured. 
Recall that national saving is the income of the nation that is left after paying 
for current consumption and government purchases. National saving (S) equals  
Y 2 C 2 G. If we rearrange the equation to reflect this fact, we obtain
Y 2 C 2 G 5 I 1 NX
S 5 I 1 NX.

661
CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
Because net exports (NX) also equal net capital outflow (NCO), we can write this 
equation as
S 5 
I 
1 
NCO
 
Domestic 
Net capital
Saving 5

.
 
investment 
outflow
This equation shows that a nation’s saving must equal its domestic investment 
plus its net capital outflow. In other words, when a U.S. citizen saves a dollar of 
her income for the future, that dollar can be used to finance the accumulation of 
domestic capital or it can be used to finance the purchase of foreign capital. 
This equation should look somewhat familiar. Earlier in the book, when we 
analyzed the role of the financial system, we considered this identity for the 
special case of a closed economy. In a closed economy, net capital outflow is zero 
(NCO 5 0), so saving equals investment (S 5 I). By contrast, an open economy has 
two uses for its saving: domestic investment and net capital outflow.
As before, we can view the financial system as standing between the two sides 
of this identity. For example, suppose the Garcia family decides to save some of 
its income for retirement. This decision contributes to national saving, the left side 
of our equation. If the Garcias deposit their saving in a mutual fund, the mutual 
fund may use some of the deposit to buy stock issued by General Motors, which 
uses the proceeds to build a factory in Ohio. In addition, the mutual fund may 
use some of the Garcias’ deposit to buy stock issued by Toyota, which uses the 
proceeds to build a factory in Osaka. These transactions show up on the right 
side of the equation. From the standpoint of U.S. accounting, the General Motors 
expenditure on a new factory is domestic investment, and the purchase of Toyota 
stock by a U.S. resident is net capital outflow. Thus, all saving in the U.S. economy 
shows up as investment in the U.S. economy or as U.S. net capital outflow. 
The bottom line is that saving, investment, and international capital flows are 
inextricably linked. When a nation’s saving exceeds its domestic investment, 
its net capital outflow is positive, indicating that the nation is using some of its 
saving to buy assets abroad. When a nation’s domestic investment exceeds its 
saving, its net capital outflow is negative, indicating that foreigners are financing 
some of this investment by purchasing domestic assets.
31-1e  Summing Up
Table 1 summarizes many of the ideas presented so far in this chapter. It describes 
the three possibilities for an open economy: a country with a trade deficit, a 
country with balanced trade, and a country with a trade surplus.
Consider first a country with a trade surplus. By definition, a trade surplus 
means that the value of exports exceeds the value of imports. Because net exports 
are exports minus imports, net exports, NX, are positive. As a result, income,  
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX, must be greater than domestic spending, C 1 I 1 G. But if 
income, Y, is more than spending, C 1 I 1 G, then saving, S 5 Y 2 C 2 G, must be 
more than investment, I. Because the country is saving more than it is investing, 
it must be sending some of its saving abroad. That is, the net capital outflow must 
be positive. 
Similar logic applies to a country with a trade deficit (such as the U.S. economy 
in recent years). By definition, a trade deficit means that the value of exports is 
less than the value of imports. Because net exports are exports minus imports, net 
exports, NX, are negative. Thus, income, Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX, must be less than

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
domestic spending, C 1 I 1 G. But if income, Y, is less than spending, C 1 I 1 G, 
then saving, S 5 Y 2 C 2 G, must be less than investment, I. Because the country 
is investing more than it is saving, it must be financing some domestic investment 
by selling assets abroad. That is, the net capital outflow must be negative. 
A country with balanced trade falls between these cases. Exports equal imports, 
so net exports are zero. Income equals domestic spending, and saving equals 
investment. The net capital outflow equals zero.

CASE 
STUDY
IS THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT A NATIONAL PROBLEM?
You may have heard the press call the United States “the world’s 
largest debtor.” The nation earned that description by borrowing 
heavily in world financial markets during the past three decades to 
finance large trade deficits. Why did the United States do this, and should this 
practice give Americans reason to worry?
To answer these questions, let’s see what the macroeconomic accounting 
identities tell us about the U.S. economy. Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows national 
saving and domestic investment as a percentage of GDP since 1960. Panel (b) shows 
net capital outflow (that is, the trade balance) as a percentage of GDP. Notice that, 
as the identities require, net capital outflow always equals national saving minus 
domestic investment. The figure shows that both national saving and domestic 
investment, as a percentage of GDP, fluctuate substantially over time. Before 1980, 
they tended to fluctuate together, so the net capital outflow was typically small—
between −1 and 1 percent of GDP. Since 1980, national saving has often fallen well 
below domestic investment, leading to sizable trade deficits and substantial inflows 
of capital. That is, the net capital outflow is often a large negative number.
To understand the fluctuations in Figure 2, we need to go beyond these data 
and discuss the policies and events that influence national saving and domestic 
investment. History shows that there is no single cause of trade deficits. Rather, 
they can arise under a variety of circumstances. Here are three prominent historical 
episodes.
Unbalanced fiscal policy: From 1980 to 1987, the flow of capital into the United 
States went from 0.5 to 3.0 percent of GDP. This 2.5 percentage point change is 
largely attributable to a fall in national saving of 2.7 percentage points. This decline 
in national saving, in turn, is often explained by the decline in public saving—
that is, the increase in the government budget deficit. These budget deficits arose 
because President Ronald Reagan cut taxes and increased defense spending, while 
he found his proposed cuts in nondefense spending harder to enact.

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
An investment boom: A different story explains the trade deficits that arose during 
the following decade. From 1991 to 2000, the capital flow into the United States 
went from 0.5 to 3.7 percent of GDP. None of this 3.2 percentage point change is 
attributable to a decline in saving; in fact, saving increased over this time, as the 
government’s budget switched from deficit to surplus. But investment went 
from 15.3 to 19.8 percent of GDP, as the economy enjoyed a boom in information 
technology and many firms were eager to make these high-tech investments.

lower since 1980 than 
it was before 1980. This 
fall in national saving has 
been reflected primarily in 
reduced net capital outflow 
rather than in reduced 
domestic investment.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
An economic downturn and recovery: During the period from 
2000 to 2015, the capital flow into the United States remained 
large. The consistency of this variable, however, stands in stark 
contrast to the remarkable changes in saving and investment. 
From 2000 to 2009, both fell by about 6 percentage points. 
Investment fell because tough economic times made capital 
accumulation less profitable, while national saving fell because 
the government began running extraordinarily large budget 
deficits in response to the downturn. From 2009 to 2015, as the 
economy recovered, these forces reversed themselves, and both 
saving and investment increased by about 3 percentage points.
Are these trade deficits and international capital flows a 
problem for the U.S. economy? There is no easy answer to 
this question. One has to evaluate the circumstances and the 
possible alternatives.
Consider first a trade deficit induced by a fall in saving, as 
occurred during the 1980s. Lower saving means that the nation 
is putting away less of its income to provide for its future. Once 
national saving has fallen, however, there is no reason to deplore 
the resulting trade deficits. If national saving fell without inducing 
a trade deficit, investment in the United States would have to fall. 
This fall in investment, in turn, would adversely affect the growth 
in the capital stock, labor productivity, and real wages. In other 
words, given that U.S. saving has declined, it is better to have 
foreigners invest in the U.S. economy than no one at all.
Now consider a trade deficit induced by an investment 
boom, like the trade deficits of the 1990s. In this case, the 
economy is borrowing from abroad to finance the purchase of 
new capital goods. If this additional capital provides a good 
return in the form of higher production of goods and services, 
then the economy should be able to handle the debt that is being 
accumulated. On the other hand, if the investment projects fail 
to yield the expected returns, the debts will look less desirable, 
at least with the benefit of hindsight.
Just as an individual can go into debt in either a prudent 
or a profligate manner, so can a nation. A trade deficit is not a 
problem in itself, but it can sometimes be a symptom of a problem. ●

31-2  The Prices for International Transactions: Real and 
Nominal Exchange Rates
So far, we have discussed measures of the flow of goods and services and the 
flow of capital across a nation’s border. In addition to these quantity variables, 
macroeconomists also study variables that measure the prices at which these 
international transactions take place. Just as the price in any market serves the 
important role of coordinating buyers and sellers in that market, international 
prices help coordinate the decisions of consumers and producers as they interact

665
CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
in world markets. Here we discuss the two most important international prices: 
the nominal and real exchange rates.
31-2a Nominal Exchange Rates
The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the currency 
of one country for the currency of another. For example, when you go to a bank, 
you might see a posted exchange rate of 80 yen per dollar. If you give the bank 1 
U.S. dollar, you will receive 80 Japanese yen in return; and if you give the bank 
80 Japanese yen, you will receive 1 U.S. dollar. (In actuality, the bank will post 
slightly different prices for buying and selling yen. The difference gives the bank 
some profit for offering this service. For our purposes here, we can ignore these 
differences.) 
An exchange rate can always be expressed in two ways. If the exchange rate is 
80 yen per dollar, it is also 1/80 (5 0.0125) dollar per yen. Throughout this book, 
we always express the nominal exchange rate as units of foreign currency per U.S. 
dollar, such as 80 yen per dollar.
If the exchange rate changes so that a dollar buys more foreign currency, that 
change is called an appreciation of the dollar. If the exchange rate changes so that 
a dollar buys less foreign currency, that change is called a depreciation of the 
dollar. For example, when the exchange rate rises from 80 to 90 yen per dollar, the 
dollar is said to appreciate. At the same time, because a Japanese yen now buys 
less of the U.S. currency, the yen is said to depreciate. When the exchange rate 
falls from 80 to 70 yen per dollar, the dollar is said to depreciate, and the yen is 
said to appreciate. 
At times, you may have heard the media report that the dollar is either “strong” 
or “weak.” These descriptions usually refer to recent changes in the nominal 
exchange rate. When a currency appreciates, it is said to strengthen because it can 
then buy more foreign currency. Similarly, when a currency depreciates, it is said 
to weaken.
For any country, there are many nominal exchange rates. The U.S. dollar can 
be used to buy Japanese yen, British pounds, Mexican pesos, and so on. When 
economists study changes in the exchange rate, they often use indexes that average 
these many exchange rates. Just as the consumer price index turns the many 
prices in the economy into a single measure of the price level, an exchange-rate 
index turns these many exchange rates into a single measure of the international 
value of a currency. So when economists talk about the dollar appreciating or 
depreciating, they often are referring to an exchange-rate index that takes into 
account many individual exchange rates. 
31-2b Real Exchange Rates 
The real exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the goods and 
services of one country for the goods and services of another. For example, if you 
go shopping and find that a pound of Swiss cheese is twice as expensive as a 
pound of American cheese, the real exchange rate is 1/2  pound of Swiss cheese 
per pound of American cheese. Notice that, like the nominal exchange rate, we 
express the real exchange rate as units of the foreign item per unit of the domestic 
item. But in this instance, the item is a good rather than a currency.
Real and nominal exchange rates are closely related. For example, suppose that 
a bushel of American rice sells for $100 and a bushel of Japanese rice sells for 
16,000 yen. What is the real exchange rate between American and Japanese rice? 
To answer this question, we must first use the nominal exchange rate to convert

the prices into a common currency. If the nominal exchange rate is 80 yen per 
dollar, then a price for American rice of $100 per bushel is equivalent to 8,000 yen 
per bushel. American rice is half as expensive as Japanese rice. The real exchange 
rate is 1/2 bushel of Japanese rice per bushel of American rice.
We can summarize this calculation for the real exchange rate with the following 
formula:
Real exchange rate 5
Nominal exchange rate 3 Domestic price

The Euro
Y
ou may have once heard of, or perhaps even 
seen, currencies such as the French franc, the 
German mark, or the Italian lira. These types of 
money no longer exist. During the 1990s, many 
European nations decided to give up their national 
currencies and instead use a common currency 
called the euro. The euro started circulating on 
January 1, 2002, when twelve nations began 
using it as their official money. As of 2016, there 
were nineteen nations using the euro. Several 
European nations, such as the United Kingdom, 
Sweden, and Denmark, have declined joining and 
have kept their own currencies.
Monetary policy for the euro area is set 
by the European Central Bank (ECB), with 
representatives from all of the participating countries. The ECB issues 
the euro and controls the supply of this money, much as the Federal 
Reserve controls the supply of dollars in the U.S. economy.
Why did these countries adopt a common currency? One benefit of 
a common currency is that it makes trade easier. Imagine if each of 
the fifty U.S. states had a different currency. Every time you crossed 
a state border, you would need to change your money and perform the 
kind of exchange-rate calculations discussed in the text. This would be 
inconvenient, and it might deter you from buying goods and services 
outside your own state. The countries of Europe decided that as their 
economies became more integrated, it would be better to avoid this 
inconvenience. 
To some extent, the adoption of a common currency in Europe was 
a political decision based on concerns beyond the scope of standard 
economics. 
Some 
advocates 
of the euro 
wanted to 
reduce 
nationalistic feelings 
and to make Europeans appreciate more fully their 
shared history and destiny. A single money for most 
of the continent, they argued, would help achieve this 
goal.
There are, however, costs of choosing a common 
currency. If the nations of Europe have only one money, 
they can have only one monetary policy. If they disagree 
about what monetary policy is best, they will have to 
reach some kind of agreement, rather than each country going its own 
way. Because adopting a single money has both benefits and costs, 
there is debate among economists about whether Europe’s adoption of 
the euro was a good decision.
From 2010 to 2015, the euro question heated up as several 
European nations dealt with a variety of economic difficulties. Greece, 
in particular, had run up a large government debt and found itself 
facing possible default. As a result, it had to raise taxes and cut back 
government spending substantially. Some observers suggested that 
dealing with these problems would have been easier if the government 
had had an additional tool—a national monetary policy. The possibility 
of Greece’s leaving the euro area and reintroducing its own currency was 
even discussed. In the end, that outcome did not occur, but it remained 
a possibility for the future. ■

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
Using the numbers in our example, the formula applies as follows:
Real exchange rate 5
180 yen/dollar2 3 1$100/bushel of American rice2
16,000 yen/bushel of Japanese rice 
5 
8,000 yen/bushel of American rice
16,000 yen/bushel of Japanese rice
5 1/2  bushel of Japanese rice/bushel of American rice.
Thus, the real exchange rate depends on the nominal exchange rate and on the 
prices of goods in the two countries measured in the local currencies.
Why does the real exchange rate matter? As you might guess, the real exchange 
rate is a key determinant of how much a country exports and imports. When Uncle 
Ben’s, Inc., is deciding whether to buy U.S. rice or Japanese rice to put into its boxes, 
it will ask which rice is cheaper. The real exchange rate gives the answer. As another 
example, imagine that you are deciding whether to take a seaside vacation in Miami, 
Florida, or in Cancún, Mexico. You might ask your travel agent the price of a hotel 
room in Miami (measured in dollars), the price of a hotel room in Cancún (measured 
in pesos), and the exchange rate between pesos and dollars. If you decide where to 
vacation by comparing costs, you are basing your decision on the real exchange rate.
 When studying an economy as a whole, macroeconomists focus on overall 
prices rather than the prices of individual items. That is, to measure the real 
exchange rate, they use price indexes, such as the consumer price index, which 
measure the price of a basket of goods and services. By using a price index for a 
U.S. basket (P), a price index for a foreign basket (P*), and the nominal exchange 
rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies (e), we can compute the overall 
real exchange rate between the United States and other countries as follows: 
Real exchange rate 5 (e 3 P)/P*. 
This real exchange rate measures the price of a basket of goods and services 
available domestically relative to a basket of goods and services available abroad.
As we examine more fully in the next chapter, a country’s real exchange rate is 
a key determinant of its net exports of goods and services. A depreciation (fall) in 
the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goods have become cheaper relative to 
foreign goods. This change encourages consumers both at home and abroad to buy 
more U.S. goods and fewer goods from other countries. As a result, U.S. exports 
rise and U.S. imports fall; both of these changes raise U.S. net exports. Conversely, 
an appreciation (rise) in the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goods have 
become more expensive compared to foreign goods, so U.S. net exports fall.

31-3  A First Theory of Exchange-Rate 
Determination: Purchasing-Power Parity
Exchange rates vary substantially over time. In 1970, a U.S. dollar could be used 
to buy 3.65 German marks or 627 Italian lira. In 1998, as both Germany and Italy 
were getting ready to adopt the euro as their common currency, a U.S. dollar

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
bought 1.76 German marks or 1,737 Italian lira. In other words, over this period, 
the value of the dollar fell by more than half compared to the mark, while it more 
than doubled compared to the lira.
What explains these large and opposite changes? Economists have developed 
many models to explain how exchange rates are determined, each emphasizing 
just some of the many forces at work. Here we develop the simplest theory of 
exchange rates, called purchasing-power parity. This theory states that a unit 
of any given currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all 
countries. Many economists believe that purchasing-power parity describes the 
forces that determine exchange rates in the long run. We now consider the logic 
on which this long-run theory of exchange rates is based, as well as the theory’s 
implications and limitations.
31-3a The Basic Logic of Purchasing-Power Parity
The theory of purchasing-power parity is based on a principle called the law 
of one price. This law asserts that a good must sell for the same price in all 
locations. Otherwise, there would be opportunities for profit left unexploited. 
For example, suppose that coffee beans sold for less in Seattle than in Dallas. A 
person could buy coffee in Seattle for, say, $4 a pound and then sell it in Dallas 
for $5 a pound, making a profit of $1 per pound from the difference in price. The 
process of taking advantage of price differences for the same item in different 
markets is called arbitrage. In our example, as people took advantage of this 
arbitrage opportunity, they would increase the demand for coffee in Seattle 
and increase the supply in Dallas. The price of coffee would rise in Seattle (in 
response to greater demand) and fall in Dallas (in response to greater supply). 
This process would continue until, eventually, the prices were the same in the 
two markets. 
Now consider how the law of one price applies to the international marketplace. 
If a dollar (or any other currency) could buy more coffee in the United States than 
in Japan, international traders could profit by buying coffee in the United States 
and selling it in Japan. This export of coffee from the United States to Japan would 
drive up the U.S. price of coffee and drive down the Japanese price. Conversely, 
if a dollar could buy more coffee in Japan than in the United States, traders could 
buy coffee in Japan and sell it in the United States. This import of coffee into the 
United States from Japan would drive down the U.S. price of coffee and drive up 
the Japanese price. In the end, the law of one price tells us that a dollar must buy 
the same amount of coffee in all countries.
This logic leads us to the theory of purchasing-power parity. According to this 
theory, a currency must have the same purchasing power in all countries. That is, 
a U.S. dollar must buy the same quantity of goods in the United States and Japan, 
and a Japanese yen must buy the same quantity of goods in Japan and the United 
States. Indeed, the name of this theory describes it well. Parity means equality, and 
purchasing power refers to the value of money in terms of the quantity of goods 
it can buy. Purchasing-power parity states that a unit of a currency must have the 
same real value in every country.
31-3b Implications of Purchasing-Power Parity
What does the theory of purchasing-power parity say about exchange rates? It tells 
us that the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries depends 
on the price levels in those countries. If a dollar buys the same quantity of goods in 
the United States (where prices are measured in dollars) as in Japan (where prices 
are measured in yen), then the number of yen per dollar must reflect the prices of 
purchasing-power parity

quantity of goods in all

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
goods in the United States and Japan. For example, if a pound of coffee costs 500 
yen in Japan and $5 in the United States, then the nominal exchange rate must be 
100 yen per dollar (500 yen/$5 5 100 yen per dollar). Otherwise, the purchasing 
power of the dollar would not be the same in the two countries.
To see more fully how this works, it is helpful to use just a bit of mathematics. 
Suppose that P is the price of a basket of goods in the United States (measured in 
dollars), P* is the price of a basket of goods in Japan (measured in yen), and e is 
the nominal exchange rate (the number of yen a dollar can buy). Now consider 
the quantity of goods a dollar can buy at home and abroad. At home, the price 
level is P, so the purchasing power of $1 at home is 1/P. That is, a dollar can buy 
1/P quantity of goods. Abroad, a dollar can be exchanged into e units of foreign 
currency, which in turn have purchasing power e/P*. For the purchasing power of 
a dollar to be the same in the two countries, it must be the case that 
1/P 5 e/P*.
With rearrangement, this equation becomes
 1 5 eP/P*.
Notice that the left side of this equation is a constant and the right side is the 
real exchange rate. Thus, if the purchasing power of the dollar is always the same at 
home and abroad, then the real exchange rate—the relative price of domestic and foreign 
goods—cannot change.
To see the implication of this analysis for the nominal exchange rate, we can 
rearrange the last equation to solve for the nominal exchange rate: 
 e 5 P*/P.
That is, the nominal exchange rate equals the ratio of the foreign price level 
(measured in units of the foreign currency) to the domestic price level (measured 
in units of the domestic currency). According to the theory of purchasing-power parity, 
the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries must reflect the price 
levels in those countries.
A key implication of this theory is that nominal exchange rates change when 
price levels change. As we saw in the preceding chapter, the price level in any 
country adjusts to bring the quantity of money supplied and the quantity of 
money demanded into balance. Because the nominal exchange rate depends on 
the price levels, it also depends on the money supply and demand in each country. 
When a central bank in any country increases the money supply and causes the 
price level to rise, it also causes that country’s currency to depreciate relative to 
other currencies in the world. In other words, when the central bank prints large 
quantities of money, that money loses value both in terms of the goods and services it can 
buy and in terms of the amount of other currencies it can buy.
We can now answer the question that began this section: Why did the U.S. dollar 
lose value compared to the German mark and gain value compared to the Italian 
lira? The answer is that Germany pursued a less inflationary monetary policy than 
the United States, and Italy pursued a more inflationary monetary policy. From 1970 
to 1998, inflation in the United States was 5.3 percent per year. By contrast, inflation 
was 3.5 percent in Germany and 9.6 percent in Italy. As U.S. prices rose relative to 
German prices, the value of the dollar fell relative to the mark. Similarly, as U.S. 
prices fell relative to Italian prices, the value of the dollar rose relative to the lira.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES 
Germany and Italy now have a common currency—the euro. This means that 
the two countries share a single monetary policy and that the inflation rates in the 
two countries will be closely linked. But the historical lessons of the lira and the 
mark will apply to the euro as well. Whether the U.S. dollar buys more or fewer 
euros 20 years from now than it does today depends on whether the European 
Central Bank produces more or less inflation in Europe than the Federal Reserve 
does in the United States.
CASE 
STUDY
THE NOMINAL EXCHANGE RATE DURING A HYPERINFLATION
Macroeconomists can only rarely conduct controlled experiments. Most 
often, they must glean what they can from the natural experiments 
that history gives them. One natural experiment is hyperinflation—the 
high inflation that arises when a government turns to the printing press 
to pay for large amounts of government spending. Because hyperinflations are so 
extreme, they illustrate some basic economic principles with clarity. 
Consider the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s. Figure 3 shows the 
German money supply, the German price level, and the nominal exchange rate 
(measured as U.S. cents per German mark) for that period. Notice that these series 
move closely together. When the supply of money starts growing quickly, the price 
level also takes off, and the German mark depreciates. When the money supply 
stabilizes, so do the price level and the exchange rate. 
The pattern shown in this figure appears during every hyperinflation. It leaves 
no doubt that there is a fundamental link among money, prices, and the nominal 
exchange rate. The quantity theory of money discussed in the previous chapter 
explains how the money supply affects the price level. The theory of purchasing-
power parity discussed here explains how the price level affects the nominal 
exchange rate. ●

Exchange Rate during the German 
Hyperinflation
This figure shows the money 
supply, the price level, and the 
nominal exchange rate (measured 
as U.S. cents per mark) for the 
German hyperinflation from 
January 1921 to December 1924. 
Notice how similarly these three 
variables move. When the quantity 
of money started growing quickly, 
the price level followed and the 
mark depreciated relative to the 
dollar. When the German central 
bank stabilized the money supply, 
the price level and exchange rate 
stabilized as well.

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
31-3c Limitations of Purchasing-Power Parity
Purchasing-power parity provides a simple model of how exchange rates are 
determined. For understanding many economic phenomena, the theory works 
well. In particular, it can explain many long-term trends, such as the depreciation 
of the U.S. dollar against the German mark and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against the Italian lira. It can also explain the major changes in exchange rates that 
occur during hyperinflations.
Yet the theory of purchasing-power parity is not completely accurate. That is, 
exchange rates do not always move to ensure that a dollar has the same real value 
in all countries all the time. There are two reasons the theory of purchasing-power 
parity does not always hold in practice.
The first reason is that many goods are not easily traded. Imagine, for instance, 
that haircuts are more expensive in Paris than in New York. International travelers 
might avoid getting their haircuts in Paris, and some haircutters might move 
from New York to Paris. Yet such arbitrage would be too limited to eliminate the 
differences in prices. Thus, the deviation from purchasing-power parity might 
persist, and a dollar (or euro) would continue to buy less of a haircut in Paris than 
in New York.
The second reason that purchasing-power parity does not always hold is that 
even tradable goods are not always perfect substitutes when they are produced in 
different countries. For example, some consumers prefer German cars, and others 
prefer American cars. Moreover, consumer tastes can change over time. If German 
cars suddenly become more popular, the increase in demand will drive up the 
price of German cars compared to American cars. Despite this difference in prices 
in the two markets, there might be no opportunity for profitable arbitrage because 
consumers do not view the two cars as equivalent.
Thus, both because some goods are not tradable and because some tradable 
goods are not perfect substitutes for their foreign counterparts, purchasing-power 
parity is not a perfect theory of exchange-rate determination. For these reasons, real 
exchange rates fluctuate over time. Nonetheless, the theory of purchasing-power 
parity does provide a useful first step in understanding exchange rates. The basic 
logic is persuasive: As the real exchange rate drifts from the level predicted by 
purchasing-power parity, people have greater incentive to move goods across 
national borders. Even if the forces of purchasing-power parity do not completely 
fix the real exchange rate, they provide a reason to expect that changes in the real 
exchange rate are most often small or temporary. As a result, large and persistent 
movements in nominal exchange rates typically reflect changes in price levels at 
home and abroad.
CASE 
STUDY
THE HAMBURGER STANDARD
When economists apply the theory of purchasing-power parity 
to explain exchange rates, they need data on the prices of a basket 
of goods available in different countries. One analysis of this sort is 
conducted by The Economist, an international newsmagazine. The magazine 
occasionally collects data on a basket of goods consisting of “two all-beef patties, 
special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.” It’s called 
the “Big Mac” and is sold by McDonald’s around the world.
Once we have the prices of Big Macs in two countries denominated in the 
local currencies, we can compute the exchange rate predicted by the theory of 
purchasing-power parity. The predicted exchange rate is the one that makes the 
cost of a Big Mac the same in the two countries. For instance, if the price of a Big

Mac is $5 in the United States and 500 yen in Japan, purchasing-power parity 
would predict an exchange rate of 100 yen per dollar.
How well does purchasing-power parity work when applied using Big Mac 
prices? Here are some examples from January 2016, when the price of a Big Mac 
was $4.93 in the United States:

You can see that the predicted and actual exchange rates are not exactly the same. 
After all, international arbitrage in Big Macs is not easy. Yet the two exchange rates 
are usually in the same ballpark. Purchasing-power parity is not a precise theory of 
exchange rates, but it often provides a reasonable first approximation. ●

31-4 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter has been to develop some basic concepts that 
macroeconomists use to study open economies. You should now understand 
how a nation’s trade balance is related to the international flow of capital and 
how national saving can differ from domestic investment in an open economy. 
You should understand that when a nation is running a trade surplus, it must 
be sending capital abroad, and that when it is running a trade deficit, it must be 
experiencing a capital inflow. You should also understand the meaning of the 
nominal and real exchange rates, as well as the implications and limitations of 
purchasing-power parity as a theory of how exchange rates are determined.
The macroeconomic variables defined here offer a starting point for analyzing 
an open economy’s interactions with the rest of the world. In the next chapter, we 
develop a model that can explain what determines these variables. We can then 
discuss how various events and policies affect a country’s trade balance and the 
rate at which nations make exchanges in world markets. 
1. Comparing the U.S. economy today to that of 1950, 
one finds that today, as a percentage of GDP,
a. exports and imports are both higher.
b. exports and imports are both lower. 
c. exports are higher, and imports are lower.
d. exports are lower, and imports are higher.
2. In an open economy, national saving equals domestic 
investment
a. plus the net outflow of capital abroad.
b. minus the net exports of goods and services.
c. plus the government’s budget deficit.
d. minus foreign portfolio investment.

• Net exports are the value of domestic goods and 
services sold abroad (exports) minus the value of 
foreign goods and services sold domestically (imports). 
Net capital outflow is the acquisition of foreign assets 
by domestic residents (capital outflow) minus the 
acquisition of domestic assets by foreigners (capital 
inflow). Because every international transaction 
involves an exchange of an asset for a good or service, 
an economy’s net capital outflow always equals its net 
exports.
• An economy’s saving can be used either to finance 
investment at home or to buy assets abroad. Thus, 
national saving equals domestic investment plus net 
capital outflow. 
• The nominal exchange rate is the relative price of the 
currency of two countries, and the real exchange rate 
is the relative price of the goods and services of two 
countries. When the nominal exchange rate changes so 
that each dollar buys more foreign currency, the dollar 
is said to appreciate or strengthen. When the nominal 
exchange rate changes so that each dollar buys less 
foreign currency, the dollar is said to depreciate or 
weaken.
• According to the theory of purchasing-power parity, a 
dollar (or a unit of any other currency) should be able 
to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries. 
This theory implies that the nominal exchange rate 
between the currencies of two countries should reflect 
the price levels in those countries. As a result, countries 
with relatively high inflation should have depreciating 
currencies, and countries with relatively low inflation 
should have appreciating currencies.

7. A can of soda costs $1.25 in the United States and  
25 pesos in Mexico. What is the peso–dollar exchange 
rate (measured in pesos per dollar) if purchasing-
power parity holds? If a monetary expansion caused 
all prices in Mexico to double, so that soda rose to 
50 pesos, what would happen to the peso–dollar 
exchange rate?

CHAPTER 31   OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 
8. A case study in the chapter analyzed purchasing-
power parity for several countries using the price of 
Big Macs. Here are data for a few more countries:
Country
Price of a  
Big Mac
Predicted  
Exchange  
Rate
Actual  
Exchange  
Rate
Chile
2,100 pesos
_____ pesos/$
715 pesos/$
Hungary
    900 forints
_____ forints/$
293 forints/$
Czech 
Republic
  75 korunas
_____ korunas/$
  25.1 korunas/$
Brazil
  13.5 real
_____ real/$
   4.02 real/$
Canada
    5.84 C$
_____ C$/$
   1.41 C$/$
a. For each country, compute the predicted exchange 
rate of the local currency per U.S. dollar. (Recall 
that the U.S. price of a Big Mac was $4.93.) 
b. According to purchasing-power parity, what is the 
predicted exchange rate between the Hungarian 
forint and the Canadian dollar? What is the actual 
exchange rate?
c. How well does the theory of purchasing-power 
parity explain exchange rates?
9. Purchasing-power parity holds between the nations 
of Ectenia and Wiknam, where the only commodity is 
Spam.
a. In 2015, a can of Spam costs 4 dollars in Ectenia 
and 24 pesos in Wiknam. What is the exchange 
rate between Ectenian dollars and Wiknamian 
pesos?
b. Over the next 20 years, inflation is expected to be  
3.5 percent per year in Ectenia and 7 percent per 
year in Wiknam. If this inflation comes to pass, 
what will the price of Spam and the exchange  
rate be in 2035? (Hint: Recall the rule of 70 from 
Chapter 27.)
c. Which of these two nations will likely have a 
higher nominal interest rate? Why?
d. A friend of yours suggests a get-rich-quick 
scheme: Borrow from the nation with the lower 
nominal interest rate, invest in the nation with the 
higher nominal interest rate, and profit from the 
interest-rate differential. Do you see any potential 
problems with this idea? Explain.

A Macroeconomic Theory 
of the Open Economy
CHAPTER
32
O
ver the past three decades, the United States has consistently imported more 
goods and services than it has exported. That is, U.S. net exports have been 
negative. While economists debate whether these trade deficits are a problem 
for the U.S. economy, the nation’s business community often has a strong opinion. 
Many business leaders claim that the trade deficits reflect unfair competition 
: Foreign firms are allowed to sell their products in U.S. markets, they contend, 
while foreign governments impede U.S. firms from selling U.S. products abroad.
Imagine that you are the president and you want to end these trade deficits. 
What should you do? Should you try to limit imports, perhaps by imposing a 
quota on textiles from China or cars from Japan? Or should you try to influence 
the nation’s trade deficit in some other way?

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
To understand the factors that determine a country’s trade balance and how 
government policies can affect it, we need a macroeconomic theory that explains 
how an open economy works. The preceding chapter introduced some of the 
key macroeconomic variables that describe an economy’s relationship with other 
economies, including net exports, net capital outflow, and the real and nominal 
exchange rates. This chapter develops a model that identifies the forces that deter-
mine these variables and explains how these variables are related to one another.
To develop this macroeconomic model of an open economy, we build on our 
previous analysis in two ways. First, the model takes the economy’s GDP as 
given. We assume that the economy’s output of goods and services, as measured 
by real GDP, is determined by the supplies of the factors of production and by the 
available production technology that turns these inputs into output. Second, the 
model takes the economy’s price level as given. We assume that the price level 
adjusts to bring the supply and demand for money into balance. In other words, 
this chapter takes as a starting point the lessons learned in previous chapters 
about the determination of the economy’s output and price level.
The goal of the model in this chapter is to highlight the forces that determine 
the economy’s trade balance and exchange rate. In one sense, the model is simple 
: It applies the tools of supply and demand to an open economy. Yet the model 
is also more complicated than others we have seen because it involves looking 
simultaneously at two related markets: the market for loanable funds and the 
market for foreign-currency exchange. After we develop this model of the open 
economy, we use it to examine how various events and policies affect the econ-
omy’s trade balance and exchange rate. We will then be able to determine the 
government policies that are most likely to reverse the trade deficits that the U.S. 
economy has experienced over the past three decades.
32-1  Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds  
and for Foreign-Currency Exchange
To understand the forces at work in an open economy, we focus on supply 
and demand in two markets. The first is the market for loanable funds, which 
coordinates the economy’s saving, investment, and flow of loanable funds abroad 
(called the net capital outflow). The second is the market for foreign-currency 
exchange, which coordinates people who want to exchange the domestic currency 
for the currency of other countries. In this section, we discuss supply and demand 
in each of these markets separately. In the next section, we put these markets 
together to explain the overall equilibrium for an open economy.
32-1a The Market for Loanable Funds
When we first analyzed the role of the financial system in Chapter 26, we made 
the simplifying assumption that the financial system consists of only one market, 
called the market for loanable funds. All savers go to this market to deposit their 
saving, and all borrowers go to this market to get their loans. In this market, there 
is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving and the cost of borrowing.
To understand the market for loanable funds in an open economy, the place to 
start is the identity discussed in the preceding chapter:
S 
5 
I 
1 
NCO
 
Domestic 
Net capital
Saving 5  
1 
.
 
investment 
outflow

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
Whenever a nation saves a dollar of its income, it can use that dollar to finance 
the purchase of domestic capital or to finance the purchase of an asset abroad. 
The two sides of this identity represent the two sides of the market for loanable 
funds. The supply of loanable funds comes from national saving (S), and the 
demand for loanable funds comes from domestic investment (I) and net capital 
outflow (NCO). 
Loanable funds should be interpreted as the domestically generated flow of 
resources available for capital accumulation. The purchase of a capital asset adds 
to the demand for loanable funds, regardless of whether that asset is located at 
home (I) or abroad (NCO). Because net capital outflow can be either positive or 
negative, it can either add to or subtract from the demand for loanable funds that 
arises from domestic investment. When NCO > 0, the country is experiencing a 
net outflow of capital; the net purchase of capital overseas adds to the demand 
for domestically generated loanable funds. When NCO < 0, the country is 
experiencing a net inflow of capital; the capital resources coming from abroad 
reduce the demand for domestically generated loanable funds. 
As we learned in our earlier discussion of the market for loanable funds, the 
quantity of loanable funds supplied and the quantity of loanable funds demanded 
depend on the real interest rate. A higher real interest rate encourages people 
to save and, therefore, raises the quantity of loanable funds supplied. A higher 
interest rate also makes borrowing to finance capital projects more costly; thus, 
it discourages investment and reduces the quantity of loanable funds demanded.
In addition to influencing national saving and domestic investment, the real 
interest rate in a country affects that country’s net capital outflow. To see why, 
consider two mutual funds—one in the United States and one in Germany—
deciding whether to buy a U.S. government bond or a German government bond. 
Each mutual fund manager would make this decision in part by comparing the 
real interest rates in the United States and Germany. When the U.S. real interest 
rate rises, the U.S. bond becomes more attractive to both mutual funds. Thus, an 
increase in the U.S. real interest rate discourages Americans from buying foreign 
assets and encourages foreigners to buy U.S. assets. For both reasons, a high U.S. 
real interest rate reduces U.S. net capital outflow.
We illustrate the market for loanable funds with the familiar supply-and-
demand diagram in Figure 1. As in our earlier analysis of the financial system, the 
supply curve slopes upward because a higher interest rate increases the quantity 
of loanable funds supplied, and the demand curve slopes downward because a 
higher interest rate decreases the quantity of loanable funds demanded. Unlike 
the situation in our previous discussion, however, the demand side of the market 
now represents both domestic investment and net capital outflow. That is, in an 
open economy, the demand for loanable funds comes not only from those who 
want loanable funds to buy domestic capital goods but also from those who want 
loanable funds to buy foreign assets.
The interest rate adjusts to bring the supply and demand for loanable funds 
into balance. If the interest rate were below the equilibrium level, the quantity of 
loanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity demanded. The resulting 
shortage of loanable funds would push the interest rate upward. Conversely, if 
the interest rate were above the equilibrium level, the quantity of loanable funds 
supplied would exceed the quantity demanded. The surplus of loanable funds 
would drive the interest rate downward. At the equilibrium interest rate, the 
supply of loanable funds exactly balances the demand. In other words, at the 
equilibrium interest rate, the amount that people want to save exactly balances the desired 
quantities of domestic investment and net capital outflow.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
32-1b The Market for Foreign-Currency Exchange
The second market in our model of the open economy is the market for foreign-
currency exchange. Participants in this market trade U.S. dollars in exchange for 
foreign currencies. To understand the market for foreign-currency exchange, we 
begin with another identity from the last chapter:
NCO 
5 
NX
Net capital outflow 5 Net exports. 
This identity states that the imbalance between the purchase and sale of capital 
assets abroad (NCO) equals the imbalance between exports and imports of goods 
and services (NX). For example, when the U.S. economy is running a trade surplus 
(NX . 0), foreigners are buying more U.S. goods and services than Americans are 
buying foreign goods and services. What are Americans doing with the foreign 
currency they are getting from this net sale of goods and services abroad? They 
must be buying foreign assets, so U.S. capital is flowing abroad (NCO . 0). 
Conversely, if the United States is running a trade deficit (NX , 0), Americans are 
spending more on foreign goods and services than they are earning from selling 
abroad. Some of this spending must be financed by selling American assets 
abroad, so foreign capital is flowing into the United States (NCO , 0). 
Our model of the open economy treats the two sides of this identity as 
representing the two sides of the market for foreign-currency exchange. Net 
capital outflow represents the quantity of dollars supplied for the purpose 
of buying foreign assets. For example, when a U.S. mutual fund wants to buy 
a Japanese government bond, it needs to change dollars into yen, so it supplies 
dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. Net exports represent the 
quantity of dollars demanded for the purpose of buying U.S. net exports of goods 
and services. For example, when a Japanese airline wants to buy a plane made by 
Boeing, it needs to change its yen into dollars, so it demands dollars in the market 
for foreign-currency exchange.
FIGURE 1
The Market for Loanable Funds
The interest rate in an open economy, 
as in a closed economy, is determined 
by the supply and demand for 
loanable funds. National saving is 
the source of the supply of loanable 
funds. Domestic investment and net 
capital outflow are the sources of the 
demand for loanable funds. At the 
equilibrium interest rate, the amount 
that people want to save exactly 
balances the amount that people want 
to borrow for the purpose of buying 
domestic capital and foreign assets.

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
What price balances the supply and demand in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange? The answer is the real exchange rate. As we saw in the preceding 
chapter, the real exchange rate is the relative price of domestic and foreign goods 
and, therefore, is a key determinant of net exports. When the U.S. real exchange rate 
appreciates, U.S. goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods, making 
U.S. goods less attractive to consumers both at home and abroad. As a result, 
exports from the United States fall, and imports into the United States rise. For both 
reasons, net exports fall. Hence, an appreciation of the real exchange rate reduces 
the quantity of dollars demanded in the market for foreign-currency exchange.
Figure 2 shows supply and demand in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange. The demand curve slopes downward for the reason we just discussed
: A higher real exchange rate makes U.S. goods more expensive and reduces the 
quantity of dollars demanded to buy those goods. The supply curve is vertical 
because the quantity of dollars supplied for net capital outflow does not depend 
on the real exchange rate. (As discussed earlier, net capital outflow depends on 
the real interest rate. When discussing the market for foreign-currency exchange, 
we take the real interest rate and net capital outflow as given.)
It might seem strange at first that net capital outflow does not depend on 
the exchange rate. After all, a higher exchange value of the U.S. dollar not only 
makes foreign goods less expensive for American buyers but also makes foreign 
assets less expensive. One might guess that this would make foreign assets more 
attractive. But remember that an American investor will eventually want to 
FIGURE 2
The Market for Foreign-Currency 
Exchange
The real exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand for foreign-currency 
exchange. The supply of dollars to be exchanged into foreign currency comes from net 
capital outflow. Because net capital outflow does not depend on the real exchange rate, the 
supply curve is vertical. The demand for dollars comes from net exports. Because a lower real 
exchange rate stimulates net exports (and thus increases the quantity of dollars demanded 
to pay for these net exports), the demand curve slopes downward. At the equilibrium real 
exchange rate, the number of dollars people supply to buy foreign assets exactly balances the 
number of dollars people demand to buy net exports.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
turn the foreign asset, as well as any profits earned on it, back into dollars. For 
example, a high value of the dollar makes it less expensive for an American to buy 
stock in a Japanese company, but when that stock pays dividends, those will be 
in yen. As these yen are exchanged for dollars, the high value of the dollar means 
that the dividend will buy fewer dollars. Thus, changes in the exchange rate 
influence both the cost of buying foreign assets and the benefit of owning them, 
and these two effects offset each other. For these reasons, our model of the open 
economy posits that net capital outflow does not depend on the real exchange 
rate, as represented by the vertical supply curve in Figure 2.
The real exchange rate moves to ensure equilibrium in this market. It adjusts to 
balance the supply and demand for dollars just as the price of any good adjusts to 
balance supply and demand for that good. If the real exchange rate were below the 
equilibrium level, the quantity of dollars supplied would be less than the quantity 
demanded. The resulting shortage of dollars would push the value of the dollar 
upward. Conversely, if the real exchange rate were above the equilibrium level, the 
quantity of dollars supplied would exceed the quantity demanded. The surplus 
of dollars would drive the value of the dollar downward. At the equilibrium real 
exchange rate, the demand for dollars by foreigners arising from the U.S. net exports of 
goods and services exactly balances the supply of dollars from Americans arising from U.S. 
net capital outflow.

Purchasing-Power Parity as a Special Case
A
n alert reader of this book might ask: Why are we developing a theory 
of the exchange rate here? Didn’t we already do that in the preceding 
chapter?
As you may recall, the preceding chapter developed a theory of the 
exchange rate called purchasing-power parity. This theory asserts that a 
dollar (or any other currency) must buy the same quantity of goods and 
services in every country. As a result, the real exchange rate is fixed, and 
all changes in the nominal exchange rate between two currencies reflect 
changes in the price levels in the two countries.
The model of the exchange rate developed here is related to the 
theory of purchasing-power parity. According to the theory of purchasing-
power parity, international trade responds quickly to international price 
differences. If goods were cheaper in one country than in another, they 
would be exported from the first country and imported into the second 
until the price difference disappeared. In other words, the theory of 
purchasing-power parity assumes that net exports are highly responsive 
to small changes in the real exchange rate. If net exports were in fact so 
responsive, the demand curve in Figure 2 would be horizontal.
Thus, the theory of 
purchasing-power parity 
can be viewed as a special 
case of the model considered 
here. In that special case, 
the demand curve for foreign-
currency exchange, instead of sloping 
downward, is horizontal at the level of the real exchange rate that 
ensures parity of purchasing power at home and abroad. 
While this special case is a good place to start when studying 
exchange rates, it is far from the end of the story. In practice, foreign 
and domestic goods are not always perfect substitutes, and there are 
costs that impede trade. This chapter, therefore, assumes that the 
demand curve for foreign-currency exchange slopes downward. This 
allows for the possibility that the real exchange rate changes over time, 
as in fact it often does in the real world. ■

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
32-2 Equilibrium in the Open Economy
So far, we have discussed supply and demand in two markets: the market for 
loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. Let’s now consider 
how these markets are related to each other.
32-2a Net Capital Outflow: The Link between the Two Markets
We begin by recapping what we’ve learned so far in this chapter. We have 
been discussing how the economy coordinates four important macroeconomic 
variables: national saving (S), domestic investment (I), net capital outflow (NCO), 
and net exports (NX). Keep in mind the following identities:
S 5 I 1 NCO
and
NCO 5 NX.
In the market for loanable funds, supply comes from national saving (S), demand 
comes from domestic investment (I) and net capital outflow (NCO), and the real 
interest rate balances supply and demand. In the market for foreign-currency 
exchange, supply comes from net capital outflow (NCO), demand comes from net 
exports (NX), and the real exchange rate balances supply and demand.
Net capital outflow is the variable that links these two markets. In the market for 
loanable funds, net capital outflow is a piece of demand. An American who wants 
to buy an asset abroad must finance this purchase by obtaining resources in the U.S. 
market for loanable funds. In the market for foreign-currency exchange, net capital 
outflow is the source of supply. An American who wants to buy an asset in another 
country must supply dollars to exchange them for the currency of that country.
The key determinant of net capital outflow, as we have discussed, is the real interest 
rate. When the U.S. interest rate is high, owning U.S. assets is more attractive, and 
U.S. net capital outflow is low. Figure 3 shows this negative relationship between the 
FIGURE 3
How Net Capital Outflow Depends on the 
Interest Rate
Because a higher domestic real interest 
rate makes domestic assets more 
attractive, it reduces net capital outflow. 
Note the position of zero on the horizontal 
axis: Net capital outflow can be positive 
or negative. A negative value of net 
capital outflow means that the economy 
is experiencing a net inflow of capital.

interest rate and net capital outflow. This net-capital-outflow curve is the link between 
the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange.
32-2b Simultaneous Equilibrium in Two Markets 
We can now put all the pieces of our model together in Figure 4. This figure shows 
how the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange 
jointly determine the important macroeconomic variables of an open economy.
Panel (a) of the figure shows the market for loanable funds (taken from Figure 1). 
As before, national saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds. Domestic 
investment and net capital outflow are the source of the demand for loanable 
funds. The equilibrium real interest rate (r1) brings the quantity of loanable funds 
supplied and the quantity of loanable funds demanded into balance.
FIGURE 4
The Real Equilibrium in an Open Economy
In panel (a), the supply and demand for loanable funds determine the real interest 
rate. In panel (b), the interest rate determines net capital outflow, which provides 
the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. In panel (c), 
the supply and demand for dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange 
determine the real exchange rate.

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
Panel (b) of the figure shows net capital outflow (taken from Figure 3). The 
interest rate comes from panel (a) and then determines net capital outflow. A 
higher interest rate at home makes domestic assets more attractive, and this in 
turn reduces net capital outflow. Therefore, the net-capital-outflow curve in panel (b) 
slopes downward.
Panel (c) of the figure shows the market for foreign-currency exchange (taken 
from Figure 2). Because foreign assets must be purchased with foreign currency, the 
quantity of net capital outflow from panel (b) determines the supply of dollars to be 
exchanged into foreign currencies. The real exchange rate does not affect net capital 
outflow, so the supply curve is vertical. The demand for dollars comes from net 
exports. Because a depreciation of the real exchange rate increases net exports, the 
demand curve for foreign-currency exchange slopes downward. The equilibrium 
real exchange rate (E1) brings into balance the quantity of dollars supplied and the 
quantity of dollars demanded in the market for foreign-currency exchange.
The two markets shown in Figure 4 determine two relative prices: the real 
interest rate and the real exchange rate. The real interest rate determined in 
panel (a) is the price of goods and services in the present relative to goods and 
services in the future. The real exchange rate determined in panel (c) is the price 
of domestic goods and services relative to foreign goods and services. These two 
relative prices adjust simultaneously to balance supply and demand in these two 
markets. As they do so, they determine national saving, domestic investment, 
net capital outflow, and net exports. We can use this model to see how all these 
variables change when some policy or event causes one of these curves to shift.
QuickQuiz
In the model of the open economy just developed, two markets determine 
two relative prices. What are the markets? What are the two relative prices?
Disentangling Supply and Demand
S
uppose the owner of an apple orchard decides to consume some of his 
own apples. Does this decision represent an increase in the demand 
for apples or a decrease in the supply? Either answer is defensible, and 
as long as we are careful in our subsequent analysis, nothing important 
will hinge on which answer we choose. Sometimes how we divide things 
between supply and demand is a bit arbitrary.
In the macroeconomic model of the open economy developed in this 
chapter, the division of transactions between “supply” and “demand” 
is also a bit arbitrary. This is true both in the market for loanable funds 
and in the market for foreign-currency exchange.
Consider first the market for loanable funds. The model treats the 
net capital outflow as part of the demand for loanable funds. Yet instead 
of writing S 5 I 1 NCO, we could just as easily have written S 2 NCO 5 I . 
When the equation is rewritten in this way, a capital outflow looks like a 
reduction in the supply of loanable funds. Either way would have worked. 
The first interpretation (S 5 I  1 NCO) emphasizes loanable funds 
generated domestically whether used at home or abroad. The second 
interpretation (S 2 NCO 5 I) emphasizes loanable funds available 
for domestic investment 
whether generated at home 
or abroad. The difference 
is more semantic than 
substantive.
Similarly, consider the 
market for foreign-currency exchange. 
In our model, net exports are the source of the demand for dollars, 
and net capital outflow is the source of the supply. Thus, when a U.S. 
resident imports a car made in Japan, our model treats that transaction 
as a decrease in the quantity of dollars demanded (because net 
exports fall) rather than an increase in the quantity of dollars supplied. 
Similarly, when a Japanese citizen buys a U.S. government bond, our 
model treats that transaction as a decrease in the quantity of dollars 
supplied (because net capital outflow falls) rather than an increase in 
the quantity of dollars demanded. This definition of terms may seem 
somewhat unnatural at first, but it will prove useful when analyzing the 
effects of various policies. ■

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
32-3  How Policies and Events Affect an Open Economy
Having developed a model to explain how key macroeconomic variables are 
determined in an open economy, we can now use the model to analyze how 
changes in policy and other events alter the economy’s equilibrium. As we 
proceed, keep in mind that our model is just supply and demand in two markets 
: the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. 
When using the model to analyze any event, we can apply the three steps outlined 
in Chapter 4. First, we determine which of the supply and demand curves the 
event affects. Second, we determine the direction in which the curves shift. Third, 
we use the supply-and-demand diagrams to examine how these shifts alter the 
economy’s equilibrium. 
32-3a Government Budget Deficits
When we first discussed the supply and demand for loanable funds earlier in 
the book, we examined the effects of government budget deficits, which occur 
when government spending exceeds government revenue. Because a government 
budget deficit represents negative public saving, it reduces national saving (the 
sum of public and private saving). Thus, a government budget deficit reduces the 
supply of loanable funds, drives up the interest rate, and crowds out investment.
Now let’s consider the effects of a budget deficit in an open economy. First, 
which curve in our model shifts? As in a closed economy, the initial impact of 
the budget deficit is on national saving and, therefore, on the supply curve for 
loanable funds. Second, in which direction does this supply curve shift? Again 
as in a closed economy, a budget deficit represents negative public saving, so it 
reduces national saving and shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left. 
This is shown as the shift from S1 to S2 in panel (a) of Figure 5.
Our third and final step is to compare the old and new equilibria. Panel (a) 
shows the impact of a U.S. budget deficit on the U.S. market for loanable funds. 
With fewer funds available for borrowers in U.S. financial markets, the interest 
rate rises from r1 to r2 to balance supply and demand. Faced with a higher interest 
rate, borrowers in the market for loanable funds choose to borrow less. This 
change is represented in the figure as the movement from point A to point B along 
the demand curve for loanable funds. In particular, households and firms reduce 
their purchases of capital goods. As in a closed economy, budget deficits crowd 
out domestic investment. 
In an open economy, however, the reduced supply of loanable funds has additional 
effects. Panel (b) shows that the increase in the interest rate from r1 to r2 reduces net 
capital outflow. (This fall in net capital outflow is also part of the decrease in the 
quantity of loanable funds demanded in the movement from point A to point B in 
panel (a).) Because saving kept at home now earns higher rates of return, investing 
abroad is less attractive, and domestic residents buy fewer foreign assets. Higher 
interest rates also attract foreign investors, who want to earn the higher returns on 
U.S. assets. Thus, when budget deficits raise interest rates, both domestic and foreign 
behaviors cause U.S. net capital outflow to fall. 
Panel (c) shows how budget deficits affect the market for foreign-currency 
exchange. Because net capital outflow is reduced, Americans need less foreign 
currency to buy foreign assets and, therefore, supply fewer dollars in the market 
for foreign-currency exchange. The supply curve for dollars shifts leftward 
from S1 to S2. The reduced supply of dollars causes the real exchange rate to 
appreciate from E1 to E2. That is, the dollar becomes more valuable compared to 

687
CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
foreign currencies. This appreciation, in turn, makes U.S. goods more expensive 
compared to foreign goods. Because people both in the United States and abroad 
switch their purchases away from the more expensive U.S. goods, exports from 
the United States fall and imports into the United States rise. For both reasons, 
U.S. net exports fall. Hence, in an open economy, government budget deficits raise real 
interest rates, crowd out domestic investment, cause the currency to appreciate, and push 
the trade balance toward deficit. 
FIGURE 5
The Effects of a Government 
Budget Deficit
When the government runs a budget deficit, it reduces the supply of loanable funds from S1 
to S2 in panel (a). The interest rate rises from r1 to r2 to balance the supply and demand for 
loanable funds. In panel (b), the higher interest rate reduces net capital outflow. Reduced 
net capital outflow, in turn, reduces the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange from S1 to S2 in panel (c). This fall in the supply of dollars causes the real 
exchange rate to appreciate from E1 to E2. The appreciation of the exchange rate pushes the 
trade balance toward deficit.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
An important example of this lesson occurred in the United States in the 1980s. 
Shortly after Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the fiscal policy of 
the U.S. federal government changed dramatically. The president and Congress 
enacted large cuts in taxes, but they did not cut government spending by nearly 
as much. The result was a large budget deficit. Our model of the open economy 
predicts that such a policy should have led to a trade deficit, and in fact it did, as 
we saw in a case study in the preceding chapter. Because the budget deficit and 
trade deficit during this period were so closely related in both theory and practice, 
they were nicknamed the twin deficits. We should not, however, view these twins 
as identical, for many factors beyond fiscal policy can influence the trade deficit.
32-3b Trade Policy
A trade policy is a government policy that directly influences the quantity of 
goods and services that a country imports or exports. Trade policy takes various 
forms, usually with the purpose of supporting a particular domestic industry. 
One common trade policy is a tariff, a tax on imported goods. Another is an 
import quota, a limit on the quantity of a good produced abroad that can be sold 
domestically. 
Let’s consider the macroeconomic impact of trade policy. Suppose that the U.S. 
auto industry, concerned about competition from Japanese automakers, convinces 
the U.S. government to impose a quota on the number of cars that can be imported 
from Japan. In making their case, lobbyists for the auto industry assert that the 
trade restriction would shrink the size of the U.S. trade deficit. Are they right? 
Our model, illustrated in Figure 6, offers an answer.
The first step in analyzing the trade policy is to determine which curve shifts. 
The initial impact of the import restriction is, not surprisingly, on imports. Because 
net exports equal exports minus imports, the policy also affects net exports. And 
because net exports are the source of demand for dollars in the market for foreign-
currency exchange, the policy affects the demand curve in this market.
The second step is to determine the direction in which this demand curve 
shifts. Because the quota restricts the number of Japanese cars sold in the United 
States, it reduces imports at any given real exchange rate. Net exports, which 
equal exports minus imports, will therefore rise for any given real exchange rate. 
Because foreigners need dollars to buy U.S. net exports, there is an increased 
demand for dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. This increase in 
the demand for dollars is shown in panel (c) of Figure 6 as the shift from D1 to D2.
The third step is to compare the old and new equilibria. As we can see in 
panel (c), the increase in the demand for dollars causes the real exchange rate to 
appreciate from E1 to E2. Because nothing has happened in the market for loanable 
funds in panel (a), there is no change in the real interest rate. Because there is no 
change in the real interest rate, there is also no change in net capital outflow, shown 
in panel (b). And because there is no change in net capital outflow, there can be no 
change in net exports, even though the import quota has reduced imports.
It might seem puzzling that net exports stay the same while imports fall. This 
puzzle is resolved by noting the change in the real exchange rate: When the dollar 
appreciates in value in the market for foreign-currency exchange, domestic goods 
become more expensive relative to foreign goods. This appreciation encourages 
imports and discourages exports, and both of these changes work to offset the 
direct increase in net exports due to the import quota. In the end, an import quota 
reduces both imports and exports, but net exports (exports minus imports) are 
unchanged.

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
We have thus come to a surprising implication: Trade policies do not affect the trade 
balance. That is, policies that directly influence exports or imports do not alter net 
exports. This conclusion seems less surprising if one recalls the accounting identity:
NX 5 NCO 5 S 2 I.
Net exports equal net capital outflow, which equals national saving minus 
domestic investment. Trade policies do not alter the trade balance because they 
FIGURE 6
The Effects of an Import Quota
When the U.S. government imposes a quota on the import of Japanese cars, nothing happens 
in the market for loanable funds in panel (a) or to net capital outflow in panel (b). The only 
effect is a rise in net exports (exports minus imports) for any given real exchange rate. As a 
result, the demand for dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange rises, as shown by 
the shift from D1 to D2 in panel (c). This increase in the demand for dollars causes the value 
of the dollar to appreciate from E1 to E2. This appreciation of the dollar tends to reduce net 
exports, offsetting the direct effect of the import quota on the trade balance.

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
do not alter national saving or domestic investment. For given levels of national 
saving and domestic investment, the real exchange rate adjusts to keep the trade 
balance the same, regardless of the trade policies the government puts in place.
Although trade policies do not affect a country’s overall trade balance, 
these policies do affect specific firms, industries, and countries. When the U.S. 
government imposes an import quota on Japanese cars, General Motors has less 
competition from abroad and will sell more cars. At the same time, because the 
dollar has appreciated in value, Boeing, the U.S. aircraft maker, will find it harder 
to compete with Airbus, the European aircraft maker. U.S. exports of aircraft 
will fall, and U.S. imports of aircraft will rise. In this case, the import quota on 
Japanese cars will increase net exports of cars and decrease net exports of planes. 
In addition, it will increase net exports from the United States to Japan and 
decrease net exports from the United States to Europe. The overall trade balance 
of the U.S. economy, however, stays the same.
The effects of trade policies are, therefore, more microeconomic than 
macroeconomic. Although advocates of trade policies sometimes suggest 
(contrary to what our model predicts) that these policies can alter a country’s 
trade balance, they are usually more motivated by concerns about particular 
firms or industries. One should not be surprised, for instance, to hear an 
executive from General Motors advocating import quotas for Japanese cars. 
Economists usually oppose such trade policies. Free trade allows economies to 
specialize in doing what they do best, making residents of all countries better 
off. Trade restrictions interfere with these gains from trade and, thus, reduce 
overall economic well-being.
32-3c Political Instability and Capital Flight
In 1994, political instability in Mexico, including the assassination of a 
prominent political leader, made world financial markets nervous. People 
began to view Mexico as a much less stable country than they had previously 
thought. They decided to pull some of their assets out of Mexico and move 
these funds to the United States and other “safe havens.” Such a large and 
sudden movement of funds out of a country is called capital flight. To see the 
implications of capital flight for the Mexican economy, we again follow our 
three steps for analyzing a change in equilibrium, but this time, we apply our 
model of the open economy from the perspective of Mexico rather than the 
United States.
Consider first which curves in our model capital flight affects. When investors 
around the world observe political problems in Mexico, they decide to sell some 
of their Mexican assets and use the proceeds to buy U.S. assets. This act increases 
Mexican net capital outflow and, therefore, affects both markets in our model. 
Most obviously, it affects the net-capital-outflow curve, and this in turn influences 
the supply of pesos in the market for foreign-currency exchange. In addition, 
because the demand for loanable funds comes from both domestic investment 
and net capital outflow, capital flight affects the demand curve in the market for 
loanable funds. 
Now consider the direction in which these curves shift. When net capital 
outflow increases, there is greater demand for loanable funds to finance these 
purchases of capital assets abroad. Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 7 shows, the 
demand curve for loanable funds shifts to the right from D1 to D2. In addition, 
because net capital outflow is higher for any interest rate, the net-capital-outflow 
curve also shifts to the right from NCO1 to NCO2, as in panel (b).

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
To see the effects of capital flight on the Mexican economy, we compare the 
old and new equilibria. Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows that the increased demand for 
loanable funds causes the interest rate in Mexico to rise from r1 to r2. Panel (b) shows 
that Mexican net capital outflow increases. (Although the rise in the interest rate 
does make Mexican assets more attractive, this only partly offsets the impact of 
FIGURE 7
The Effects of Capital Flight
If people decide that Mexico is a risky place to keep their savings, they will move their 
capital to safe havens such as the United States, resulting in an increase in Mexican net 
capital outflow. Consequently, the demand for loanable funds in Mexico rises from D1 to D2, 
as shown in panel (a), driving up the Mexican real interest rate from r1 to r2. Because net 
capital outflow is higher for any interest rate, that curve also shifts to the right from NCO1 to 
NCO2 in panel (b). At the same time, in the market for foreign-currency exchange, the supply 
of pesos rises from S1 to S2, as shown in panel (c). This increase in the supply of pesos 
causes the peso to depreciate from E1 to E2, so the peso becomes less valuable compared to 
other currencies.

capital flight on net capital outflow.) Panel (c) shows that the increase in net capital 
outflow raises the supply of pesos in the market for foreign-currency exchange from 
S1 to S2. That is, as people try to get out of Mexican assets, there is a large supply 
of pesos to be converted into dollars. This increase in supply causes the peso to 
depreciate from E1 to E2. Thus, capital flight from Mexico increases Mexican interest rates 
and decreases the value of the Mexican peso in the market for foreign-currency exchange. 
This is exactly what was observed in 1994. From November 1994 to March 1995, the 
interest rate on short-term Mexican government bonds rose from 14 percent to 70 
percent, and the peso depreciated in value from 29 to 15 U.S. cents per peso.
An economist tries to decode the polit-
ical rhetoric about the exchange rate.

the U.S. economy was struggling to 
recover from a deep recession, but the 
insights here are timeless.)
Needed: Plain Talk about the 
Dollar
By Christina D. Romer
A
t a recent news conference, Ben S.  
Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, 
was asked about the falling dollar. He par-
ried the question, saying that the Treasury 
 secretary was the government’s spokesman 
on the  exchange rate—and, of course, that 
the United States favors a strong dollar. 
Listening to that statement, I flashed 
back to one of my first experiences as an 
adviser to Barack Obama. In November 2008, 
I was sharing a cab in Chicago with Larry 
Summers, the former Treasury secretary and 
a fellow economic adviser to the president-
elect. To help prepare me for the interviews 
and the hearings to come, Larry graciously 
asked me questions and critiqued my 
answers. 
When he asked about the exchange rate 
for the dollar, I began: “The exchange rate 
is a price much like any other price, and is 
determined by market forces.” 
“Wrong!” Larry boomed. “The exchange 
rate is the purview of the Treasury. The United 
States is in favor of a strong dollar.” 
For the record, my initial answer was 
much more reasonable. Our exchange rate is 
just a price—the price of the dollar in terms 
of other currencies. It is not controlled by 
anyone. And a high price for the dollar, which 
is what we mean by a strong dollar, is not 
always desirable. 
Some countries, like China, essentially 
fix the price of their currency. But since the 
early 1970s, the United States has let the 
dollar’s value move in response to changes 
in the supply and demand of dollars in the 
foreign exchange market. The Treasury no 
more determines the price of the dollar than 
the Department of Energy determines the price 
of gasoline. Both departments have a small 
reserve that they can use to combat market 
instability, but neither has the resources or the 
mandate to hold the relevant price away from 
its market equilibrium value for very long. 
In practice, all that “the exchange rate 
is the purview of the Treasury” means is 
that no official other than the Treasury 
secretary is supposed to talk about it (and 
even he isn’t supposed to say very much). 
That strikes me as a shame. Perhaps if 
government officials could talk about the 
exchange rate forthrightly, there would be 
more understanding of the issues and more 
rational policy discussions. 
Such discussions would start with some 
basic economics. The desire to trade with 
other countries or invest in them is what 
gives rise to the market for foreign exchange. 
You need euros to travel in Spain or to buy a 
German government bond, so you need a way 
to exchange currencies. 
The supply of dollars to the foreign exchange 
market comes from Americans who want to buy 
goods, services or assets from abroad. The 
demand for dollars comes from foreigners who 
want to buy from the United States. 
Anything that increases the demand 
for dollars or reduces the supply drives up 
the dollar’s price. Anything that lowers the 
demand for dollars or raises the supply 
causes the dollar to weaken. 
Consider two examples. Suppose American 
entrepreneurs create many products that 
foreigners want to buy, and start many companies 
they want to invest in. That will increase the 
demand for dollars and so cause the dollar’s price 
to rise. Such innovation will also make Americans 
want to buy more goods and assets in the United 
States—and fewer abroad. The supply of dollars 
to the foreign exchange market will fall, further 
strengthening the dollar. This example describes 
Is a Strong Currency Always in a Nation’s 
Interest?

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
very well the conditions of the late 1990s—when 
the dollar was indeed strong. 
Now suppose the United States runs a 
large budget deficit that causes domestic 
interest rates to rise. Higher American interest 
rates make both foreigners and Americans 
want to buy more American bonds and fewer 
foreign bonds. Thus the demand for dollars 
increases and the supply decreases. The price 
of the dollar will again rise. 
This example describes conditions in the 
early 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan’s 
tax cuts and military buildup led to large deficits. 
Those deficits, along with the anti-inflationary 
policies of the Fed, where Paul A. Volcker was 
then the chairman, led to high American interest 
rates. The dollar was very strong in this period. 
Both developments—brilliant American 
innovation and troublesome American 
budget deficits—caused the dollar to 
strengthen. Yet one is clearly a positive for 
the American economy, the other a negative. 
The point is that there is no universal good 
or bad direction for the dollar to move. The 
desirability of any shift in the exchange rate 
depends on why the dollar is moving. 
It also depends on the state of the 
economy. At full employment, a strong dollar 
is good for standards of living. A high price 
for the dollar means that our currency buys a 
lot in foreign countries. 
But in a depressed economy, it isn’t so clear 
that a strong dollar is desirable. A weaker dollar 
means that our goods are cheaper relative to 
foreign goods. That stimulates our exports and 
reduces our imports. Higher net exports raise 
domestic production and employment. Foreign 
goods are more expensive, but more Americans 
are working. Given the desperate need for jobs, 
on net we are almost surely better off with a 
weaker dollar for a while. 
Fed policy is determined by inflation and 
unemployment in the United States. But if 
Mr. Bernanke could discuss the exchange 
rate openly, he would probably tell you that 
one way any monetary expansion helps a 
distressed economy is by weakening the 
dollar. That is taught in every introductory 
economics course, yet the Fed is asked to 
pretend it isn’t true. 
Likewise, fiscal policy is determined by 
domestic considerations. But trimming our 
budget deficit, as we should over the coming 
years, would also weaken the dollar. And that, 
in turn, would blunt the negative impact of 
deficit reduction on employment and output 
in the short run. 
Strangely, every politician seems to 
understand that it would be desirable for the 
dollar to weaken against one particular currency: 
the Chinese renminbi. For years, China has 
deliberately accumulated United States Treasury 
bonds to keep the dollar’s value high in renminbi 
terms. The United States would export more and 
grow faster if China allowed the dollar’s price 
to fall. Congress routinely threatens retaliation 
if China doesn’t take steps that amount to 
weakening the dollar. 
But in the very next breath, the same 
members of Congress shout about the 
importance of a strong dollar. If a decline in 
its value relative to the renminbi would be 
beneficial, a fall relative to the currency of 
many countries would help even more in the 
current situation. 
To say this openly risks being branded 
not just an extremist but possibly  
un-American. Perhaps it is time for a more 
adult conversation. The exchange rate is 
the purview of market economics, not of the 
Treasury or strong-dollar ideologues. ■

These price changes that result from capital flight influence some key 
macroeconomic quantities. The depreciation of the currency makes exports 
cheaper and imports more expensive, pushing the trade balance toward surplus. 
At the same time, the increase in the interest rate reduces domestic investment, 
slowing capital accumulation and economic growth.
Capital flight has its largest impact on the country from which capital is 
fleeing, but it also affects other countries. When capital flows out of Mexico into 
the United States, for instance, it has the opposite effect on the U.S. economy as it 
has on the Mexican economy. In particular, the rise in Mexican net capital outflow

PART XI   THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES
coincides with a fall in U.S. net capital outflow. As the peso depreciates in value 
and Mexican interest rates rise, the dollar appreciates in value and U.S. interest 
rates fall. The size of this impact on the U.S. economy is small, however, because 
the economy of the United States is much larger than that of Mexico.
The events that we have been describing in Mexico could happen to any 
economy in the world, and, in fact, they do from time to time. In 1997, the world 
learned that the banking systems of several Asian economies, including Thailand, 
South Korea, and Indonesia, were at or near the point of bankruptcy, and this 
news induced capital to flee from these nations. In 1998, the Russian government 
defaulted on its debt, prompting international investors to take whatever money 
they could and run. A similar (but more complicated) set of events unfolded in 
Argentina in 2002. In each of these cases of capital flight, the results were much as 
our model predicts: rising interest rates and a falling currency. 
CAPITAL FLOWS FROM CHINA
According to our analysis of capital flight, a nation that experiences 
an outflow of capital sees its currency weaken in foreign exchange 
markets, and this depreciation in turn increases the nation’s net 
exports. The country into which the capital is flowing sees its currency 
strengthen, and this appreciation pushes its trade balance toward deficit.
With these lessons in mind, consider this question: Suppose a nation’s 
government, as a matter of policy, encourages capital to flow to another country, 
perhaps by making foreign investments itself. What effects would this policy 
have? The answer is much the same: Other things being equal, it leads to a 
weaker currency and a trade surplus for the nation encouraging the capital 
outflows and a stronger currency and a trade deficit for the recipient of those 
capital flows.
This analysis sheds light on a policy dispute between the United States and 
China. The Chinese government has sometimes tried to depress the value of its 
currency, the renminbi, in foreign exchange markets to promote its export industries. 
It did this by accumulating foreign assets, including substantial amounts of U.S 
government bonds. From 2000 to 2014, China’s total reserves of foreign assets rose 
from $160 billion to about $4 trillion.
The U.S. government at times objected to China’s interventions in foreign 
exchange markets. By holding down the value of the renminbi, the policy 
made Chinese goods less expensive, which in turn contributed to the U.S. 
trade deficit and hurt American producers who made products that compete 
with imports from China. Because of these effects, the U.S. government 
encouraged China to stop influencing the exchange value of its currency 
with government-sponsored capital flows. Some members of Congress even 
went so far as to advocate tariffs on Chinese imports unless China ceased its 
“currency manipulation.”
Yet the impact of the Chinese policy on the U.S. economy was not all bad. 
American consumers of Chinese imports benefited from lower prices. In addition, 
the inflow of capital from China reduced U.S. interest rates, which in turn increased 
investment in the U.S. economy. To some extent, the Chinese government was 
financing U.S. economic growth. The Chinese policy of investing in the U.S. 
economy created winners and losers among Americans. All things considered, the 
net impact on the U.S. economy was probably small. 
The harder question concerns the motives behind the policy: Why were 
the Chinese leaders interested in producing for export and investing abroad

rather than producing for domestic consumption and 
investing at home? One possibility is that China wanted 
to accumulate a reserve of foreign assets on which it could 
draw in emergencies—a kind of national “rainy-day fund.” 
Indeed, in 2015, as the Chinese economy started to falter, 
the Chinese government started to spend some of the fund, 
causing its reserves of foreign assets to fall by about $500 
billion. ●

32-4 Conclusion
International economics is a topic of increasing importance. 
More and more, American citizens are buying goods produced 
abroad and producing goods to be sold overseas. Through 
mutual funds and other financial institutions, they borrow and 
lend in world financial markets. As a result, a full analysis of 
the U.S. economy requires an understanding of how the U.S. 
economy interacts with other economies in the world. This 
chapter has provided a basic model for thinking about the macroeconomics of 
open economies.
The study of international economics is valuable, but we should be careful 
not to exaggerate its importance. Policymakers and commentators are often 
quick to blame foreigners for problems facing the U.S. economy. By contrast, 
economists more often view these problems as homegrown. For example, 
politicians often discuss foreign competition as a threat to American living 
standards, while economists are more likely to lament the low level of national 
saving. Low saving impedes growth in capital, productivity, and living 
standards, regardless of whether the economy is open or closed. Foreigners are 
a convenient target for politicians because blaming foreigners provides a way 
to avoid responsibility without insulting any domestic constituency. Whenever 
you hear popular discussions of international trade and finance, therefore, it is 
especially important to separate myth from reality. The tools you have learned 
in the past two chapters should help in that endeavor.
“Economic analysis can identify whether countries are using 
their exchange rates to benefit their own people at the expense 
of their trading partners’ welfare.”

• Two markets are central to the macroeconomics 
of open economies: the market for loanable funds 
and the market for foreign-currency exchange. In 
the market for loanable funds, the real interest rate 
adjusts to balance the supply of loanable funds (from 
national saving) and the demand for loanable funds 
(for domestic investment and net capital outflow). 
In the market for foreign-currency exchange, the real 
exchange rate adjusts to balance the supply of dollars 
(from net capital outflow) and the demand for dollars 
(for net exports). Because net capital outflow is part of 
the demand for loanable funds and because it provides 
the supply of dollars for foreign-currency exchange, it 
is the variable that connects these two markets.
• A policy that reduces national saving, such as a 
government budget deficit, reduces the supply of 
loanable funds and drives up the interest rate. The higher 
interest rate reduces net capital outflow, which reduces 
the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange. The dollar appreciates, and net exports fall.
• Although restrictive trade policies, such as tariffs or 
quotas on imports, are sometimes advocated as a way 
to alter the trade balance, they do not necessarily have 
that effect. A trade restriction increases net exports for 
any given exchange rate and, therefore, increases the 
demand for dollars in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange. As a result, the dollar appreciates in value, 
making domestic goods more expensive relative to 
foreign goods. This appreciation offsets the initial 
impact of the trade restriction on net exports. 
• When investors change their attitudes about holding 
assets of a country, the ramifications for the country’s 
economy can be profound. In particular, political 
instability can lead to capital flight, which tends 
to increase interest rates and cause the currency to 
depreciate.

CHAPTER 32   A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY
1. Japan generally runs a significant trade surplus. 
Do you think this is most related to high foreign 
demand for Japanese goods, low Japanese demand 
for foreign goods, a high Japanese saving rate 
relative to Japanese investment, or structural 
barriers against imports into Japan? Explain your 
answer.
2. Suppose that Congress is considering an 
investment tax credit, which subsidizes domestic 
investment. 
a. How does this policy affect national saving, domestic 
investment, net capital outflow, the interest rate, the 
exchange rate, and the trade balance?
b. Representatives of several large exporters oppose 
the policy. Why might that be the case?
3. The chapter notes that the rise in the U.S. trade 
deficit during the 1980s was due largely to the 
rise in the U.S. budget deficit. On the other hand, 
the popular press sometimes claims that the 
increased trade deficit resulted from a decline in 
the quality of U.S. products relative to foreign 
products.
a. Assume that U.S. products did decline in relative 
quality during the 1980s. How did this affect net 
exports at any given exchange rate?
b. Draw a three-panel diagram to show the effect of 
this shift in net exports on the U.S. real exchange 
rate and trade balance.
c. Is the claim in the popular press consistent with 
the model in this chapter? Does a decline in the 
quality of U.S. products have any effect on our 
standard of living? (Hint: When we sell our goods 
to foreigners, what do we receive in return?)
4. An economist discussing trade policy in The New 
Republic wrote: “One of the benefits of the United 
States removing its trade restrictions [is] the gain to 
U.S. industries that produce goods for export. Export 
industries would find it easier to sell their goods 
abroad—even if other countries didn’t follow our 
example and reduce their trade barriers.” Explain in 
words why U.S. export industries would benefit from 
a reduction in restrictions on imports to the United 
States. 
5. Suppose the French suddenly develop a strong taste 
for California wines. Answer the following questions 
in words and with a diagram.
a. What happens to the demand for dollars in the 
market for foreign-currency exchange?
b. What happens to the value of the dollar in the 
market for foreign-currency exchange?
c. What happens to U.S. net exports?
6. A senator renounces his past support for 
protectionism: “The U.S. trade deficit must be 
reduced, but import quotas only annoy our trading 
partners. If we subsidize U.S. exports instead, we can 
reduce the deficit by increasing our competitiveness.” 
Using a three-panel diagram, show the effect of an 
export subsidy on net exports and the real exchange 
rate. Do you agree with the senator?
7. Suppose the United States decides to subsidize the 
export of U.S. agricultural products, but it does not 
increase taxes or decrease any other government 
spending to offset this expenditure. Using a three-
panel diagram, show what happens to national 
saving, domestic investment, net capital outflow, the 
interest rate, the exchange rate, and the trade balance. 
Also explain in words how this U.S. policy affects the 
amount of imports, exports, and net exports. 
8. Suppose that real interest rates increase across Europe. 
Explain how this development will affect U.S. net 
capital outflow. Then explain how it will affect U.S. net 
exports by using a formula from the chapter and by 
drawing a diagram. What will happen to the U.S. real 
interest rate and real exchange rate?
9. Suppose that Americans decide to increase their saving.
a. If the elasticity of U.S. net capital outflow with 
respect to the real interest rate is very high, will 
this increase in private saving have a large or 
small effect on U.S. domestic investment?
b. If the elasticity of U.S. exports with respect to the 
real exchange rate is very low, will this increase in 
private saving have a large or small effect on the 
U.S. real exchange rate?

conomic activity fluctuates from year to year. In most years, the production of 
goods and services rises. Because of increases in the labor force, increases in 
the capital stock, and advances in technological knowledge, the economy can 
produce more and more over time. This growth allows everyone to enjoy a higher 
standard of living. On average, over the past half century, the production of the 
U.S. economy as measured by real GDP has grown by about 3 percent per year.
In some years, however, instead of expanding, the economy contracts. Firms 
find themselves unable to sell all the goods and services they have to offer, so

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
they reduce production. Workers are laid off, unemployment becomes wide-
spread, and factories are left idle. With the economy producing fewer goods and 
services, real GDP and other measures of income decline. Such a period of falling 
incomes and rising unemployment is called a recession if it is relatively mild and 
a  depression if it is more severe. 
An example of such a downturn occurred in 2008 and 2009. From the fourth 
quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, real GDP for the U.S. economy fell 
by 4.2 percent. The rate of unemployment rose from 4.4 percent in May 2007 to 
10.0 percent in October 2009—the highest level in more than a quarter century. 
Not surprisingly, students graduating during this time found that desirable jobs 
were hard to come by.
What causes short-run fluctuations in economic activity? What, if anything, 
can public policy do to prevent periods of falling incomes and rising unemploy-
ment? When recessions and depressions occur, how can policymakers reduce 
their length and severity? These are the questions we take up now.
The variables that we study are largely those we have seen in previous chapters. 
They include GDP, unemployment, interest rates, and the price level. Also familiar 
are the policy instruments of government spending, taxes, and the money supply.  
What differs from our earlier analysis is the time horizon. So far, our goal has 
been to explain the behavior of these variables in the long run. Our goal now is to 
explain their short-run deviations from long-run trends. In other words, instead 
of focusing on the forces that explain economic growth from generation to gener-
ation, we are now interested in the forces that explain economic fluctuations from 
year to year.
There is some debate among economists about how best to analyze short-run 
fluctuations, but most economists use the model of aggregate demand and aggre-
gate supply. Learning how to use this model for analyzing the short-run effects 
of various events and policies is the primary task ahead. This chapter introduces 
the model’s two pieces: the aggregate-demand curve and the aggregate-supply 
curve. Before turning to the model, however, let’s look at some of the key facts 
that  describe the ups and downs of the economy.

33-1  Three Key Facts about Economic Fluctuations
Short-run fluctuations in economic activity have occurred in all countries 
throughout history. As a starting point for understanding these year-to-year 
fluctuations, let’s discuss some of their most important properties.
33-1a  Fact 1: Economic Fluctuations Are Irregular  
and Unpredictable
Fluctuations in the economy are often called the business cycle. As this term suggests, 
economic fluctuations correspond to changes in business conditions. When real 
GDP grows rapidly, business is good. During such periods of economic expansion, 
most firms find that customers are plentiful and that profits are growing. When 
real GDP falls during recessions, businesses have trouble. During such periods of 
economic contraction, most firms experience declining sales and dwindling profits. 
The term business cycle is somewhat misleading because it suggests 
that economic fluctuations follow a regular, predictable pattern. In fact, 
economic fluctuations are not at all regular, and they are almost impossible 
to predict with much accuracy. Panel (a) of Figure 1 shows the real GDP of the

Notice that real GDP and 
investment spending 
decline during recessions, 
while unemployment rises.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
U.S. economy since 1972. The shaded areas represent times of recession. As 
the figure shows, recessions do not come at regular intervals. Sometimes 
recessions are close together, such as the recessions of 1980 and 1982. Sometimes 
the economy goes many years without a recession. The longest period 
in U.S. history without a recession was the economic expansion from 1991  
to 2001.
33-1b  Fact 2: Most Macroeconomic Quantities Fluctuate  
Together
Real GDP is the variable most commonly used to monitor short-run changes in 
the economy because it is the most comprehensive measure of economic activity. 
Real GDP measures the value of all final goods and services produced within a 
given period of time. It also measures the total income (adjusted for inflation) of 
everyone in the economy.
It turns out, however, that for monitoring short-run fluctuations, it does not 
really matter which measure of economic activity one looks at. Most macroeco-
nomic variables that measure some type of income, spending, or production 
fluctuate closely together. When real GDP falls in a recession, so do personal 
income, corporate profits, consumer spending, investment spending, industrial 
production, retail sales, home sales, auto sales, and so on. Because recessions are 
economy-wide phenomena, they show up in many sources of macroeconomic 
data.
Although many macroeconomic variables fluctuate together, they fluctuate 
by different amounts. In particular, as panel (b) of Figure 1 shows, investment 
spending varies greatly over the business cycle. Even though investment averages 
about one-sixth of GDP, declines in investment account for about two-thirds of 
the declines in GDP during recessions. In other words, when economic conditions 
deteriorate, much of the decline is attributable to reductions in spending on new 
factories, housing, and inventories.
33-1c Fact 3: As Output Falls, Unemployment Rises
Changes in the economy’s output of goods and services are strongly correlated 
with changes in the economy’s utilization of its labor force. In other words, when 
real GDP declines, the rate of unemployment rises. This fact is hardly surprising: 
When firms choose to produce a smaller quantity of goods and services, they lay 
off workers, expanding the pool of unemployed. 
Panel (c) of Figure 1 shows the unemployment rate in the U.S. economy since 
1972. Once again, the shaded areas in the figure indicate periods of recession. 
The figure shows clearly the impact of recessions on unemployment. In each of 
the recessions, the unemployment rate rises substantially. When the recession 
ends and real GDP starts to expand, the unemployment rate gradually declines. 
Because there are always some workers between jobs, the unemployment rate 
never approaches zero. Instead, it fluctuates around its natural rate of about 5 or 
6 percent.

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Describing what happens to economies as they fluctuate over time is easy. 
Explaining what causes these fluctuations is more difficult. Indeed, compared 
to the topics we have studied in previous chapters, the theory of economic 
fluctuations remains controversial. In this chapter, we begin to develop the 
model that most economists use to explain short-run fluctuations in economic 
activity.
33-2a The Assumptions of Classical Economics
In previous chapters, we developed theories to explain what determines most 
important macroeconomic variables in the long run. Chapter 25 explained the 
level and growth of productivity and real GDP. Chapters 26 and 27 explained 
how the financial system works and how the real interest rate adjusts to 
balance saving and investment. Chapter 28 explained why there is always 
some unemployment in the economy. Chapters 29 and 30 explained the 
monetary system and how changes in the money supply affect the price level, 
the inflation rate, and the nominal interest rate. 
All of this previous analysis was based on two related ideas: the classical 
dichotomy and monetary neutrality. Recall that the classical dichotomy is the 
separation of variables into real variables (those that measure quantities or relative 
prices) and nominal variables (those measured in terms of money). According 
to classical macroeconomic theory, changes in the money supply affect nominal 
variables but not real variables. As a result of this monetary neutrality, Chapters 
25 through 28 were able to examine the determinants of real variables (real GDP, 
the real interest rate, and unemployment) without introducing nominal variables 
(the money supply and the price level).  
In a sense, money does not matter in a classical world. If the quantity of 
money in the economy were to double, everything would cost twice as much, 
and everyone’s income would be twice as high. But so what? The change would 
be nominal (by the standard meaning of “nearly insignificant”). The things that 
people really care about—whether they have a job, how many goods and services 
they can afford, and so on—would be exactly the same. 
This classical view is sometimes described by the saying, “Money is a veil.” 
That is, nominal variables may be the first things we see when we observe an 
economy because economic variables are often expressed in units of money. But 
what’s important are the real variables and the economic forces that determine 
them. According to classical theory, to understand these real variables, we need to 
look behind the veil. 
33-2b The Reality of Short-Run Fluctuations
Do these assumptions of classical macroeconomic theory apply to the world 
in which we live? The answer to this question is of central importance to 
understanding how the economy works. Most economists believe that classical theory 
describes the world in the long run but not in the short run. 
Consider again the impact of money on the economy. Most economists believe 
that, beyond a period of several years, changes in the money supply affect prices 
and other nominal variables but do not affect real GDP, unemployment, and other 
real variables—just as classical theory says. When studying year-to-year changes

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
in the economy, however, the assumption of monetary neutrality is no longer 
appropriate. In the short run, real and nominal variables are highly intertwined, 
and changes in the money supply can temporarily push real GDP away from its 
long-run trend.
Even the classical economists themselves, such as David Hume, realized 
that classical economic theory did not hold in the short run. From his 
vantage point in 18th-century England, Hume observed that when the 
money supply expanded after gold discoveries, it took some time for prices 
to rise, and in the meantime, the economy enjoyed higher employment and 
production.
To understand how the economy works in the short run, we need a new 
model. This new model can be built using many of the tools we developed 
in previous chapters, but it must abandon the classical dichotomy and the 
neutrality of money. We can no longer separate our analysis of real variables 
such as output and employment from our analysis of nominal variables such 
as money and the price level. Our new model focuses on how real and nominal 
variables interact. 
33-2c The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
Our model of short-run economic fluctuations focuses on the behavior of two 
variables. The first variable is the economy’s output of goods and services, as 
measured by real GDP. The second is the average level of prices, as measured by 
the CPI or the GDP deflator. Notice that output is a real variable, whereas the price 
level is a nominal variable. By focusing on the relationship between these two 
variables, we are departing from the classical assumption that real and nominal 
variables can be studied separately. 
We analyze fluctuations in the economy as a whole with the model of 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply, which is illustrated in Figure 2. On the 
vertical axis is the overall price level in the economy. On the horizontal axis is the 
overall quantity of goods and services produced in the economy. The aggregate-
demand curve shows the quantity of goods and services that households, firms,

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
the government, and customers abroad want to buy at each price level. The 
aggregate-supply curve shows the quantity of goods and services that firms 
produce and sell at each price level. According to this model, the price level and 
the quantity of output adjust to bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
into balance.
It is tempting to view the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
as nothing more than a large version of the model of market demand and market 
supply introduced in Chapter 4. But in fact, this model is quite different. When we 
consider demand and supply in a specific market—ice cream, for instance—the 
behavior of buyers and sellers depends on the ability of resources to move from 
one market to another. When the price of ice cream rises, the quantity demanded 
falls because buyers will use their incomes to buy products other than ice cream. 
Similarly, a higher price of ice cream raises the quantity supplied because firms 
that produce ice cream can increase production by hiring workers away from 
other parts of the economy. This microeconomic substitution from one market to 
another is impossible for the economy as a whole. After all, the quantity that our 
model is trying to explain—real GDP—measures the total quantity of goods and 
services produced by all firms in all markets. To understand why the aggregate-
demand curve slopes downward and why the aggregate-supply curve slopes 
upward, we need a macroeconomic theory that explains the total quantity of goods 
and services demanded and the total quantity of goods and services supplied. 
Developing such a theory is our next task.

33-3 The Aggregate-Demand Curve
The aggregate-demand curve tells us the quantity of all goods and services 
demanded in the economy at any given price level. As Figure 3 illustrates, the 
aggregate-demand curve slopes downward. This means that, other things being 
equal, a decrease in the economy’s overall level of prices (from, say, P1 to P2) raises 
the quantity of goods and services demanded (from Y1 to Y2). Conversely, an 
increase in the price level reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded.
33-3a Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward
Why does a change in the price level move the quantity of goods and services 
demanded in the opposite direction? To answer this question, it is useful to recall 
that an economy’s GDP (which we denote as Y) is the sum of its consumption (C), 
investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX):
Y 5 C 1 I 1 G 1 NX.
Each of these four components contributes to the aggregate demand for goods 
and services. For now, we assume that government spending is fixed by policy. 
The other three components of spending—consumption, investment, and net 
exports—depend on economic conditions and, in particular, on the price level. 
Therefore, to understand the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve, 
we must examine how the price level affects the quantity of goods and services 
demanded for consumption, investment, and net exports.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
The Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect  Consider the money that 
you hold in your wallet and your bank account. The nominal value of this money 
is fixed: One dollar is always worth one dollar. Yet the real value of a dollar is not 
fixed. If a candy bar costs one dollar, then a dollar is worth one candy bar. If the 
price of a candy bar falls to 50 cents, then one dollar is worth two candy bars. 
Thus, when the price level falls, the dollars you are holding rise in value, which 
increases your real wealth and your ability to buy goods and services. 
This logic gives us the first reason the aggregate-demand curve slopes 
downward. A decrease in the price level raises the real value of money and makes 
consumers wealthier, which in turn encourages them to spend more. The increase in 
consumer spending means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, 
an increase in the price level reduces the real value of money and makes consumers 
poorer, which in turn reduces consumer spending and the quantity of goods and services 
demanded. 
The Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect  The price level is one 
determinant of the quantity of money demanded. When the price level is lower, 
households do not need to hold as much money to buy the goods and services 
they want. Therefore, when the price level falls, households try to reduce their 
holdings of money by lending some of it out. For instance, a household might 
use its excess money to buy interest-bearing bonds. Or it might deposit its 
excess money in an interest-bearing savings account, and the bank would use 
these funds to make more loans. In either case, as households try to convert some 
of their money into interest-bearing assets, they drive down interest rates. (The 
next chapter analyzes this process in more detail.)
Interest rates, in turn, affect spending on goods and services. Because a lower 
interest rate makes borrowing less expensive, it encourages firms to borrow 
FIGURE 3
The Aggregate-Demand Curve
A fall in the price level from P1 to P2 
increases the quantity of goods and 
services demanded from Y1 to Y2. There 
are three reasons for this negative 
relationship. As the price level falls, 
real wealth rises, interest rates fall, 
and the exchange rate depreciates. 
These effects stimulate spending on 
consumption, investment, and net 
exports. Increased spending on any 
or all of these components of output 
means a larger quantity of goods and 
services demanded.

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
more to invest in new plants and equipment, and it encourages households to 
borrow more to invest in new housing. (A lower interest rate might also stimulate 
consumer spending, especially spending on large durable purchases such as 
cars, which are often bought on credit.) Thus, a lower interest rate increases the 
quantity of goods and services demanded.
This logic gives us the second reason the aggregate-demand curve slopes 
downward. A lower price level reduces the interest rate, encourages greater spending 
on investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. 
Conversely, a higher price level raises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, 
and decreases the quantity of goods and services demanded.
The Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Effect  As we have 
just discussed, a lower price level in the United States lowers the U.S. interest 
rate. In response to the lower interest rate, some U.S. investors will seek higher 
returns by investing abroad. For instance, as the interest rate on U.S. government 
bonds falls, a mutual fund might sell U.S. government bonds to buy German 
government bonds. As the mutual fund tries to convert its dollars into euros to 
buy the German bonds, it increases the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-
currency exchange. 
The increased supply of dollars to be turned into euros causes the dollar to 
depreciate relative to the euro. This leads to a change in the real exchange rate—
the relative price of domestic and foreign goods. Because each dollar buys fewer 
units of foreign currencies, foreign goods become more expensive relative to 
domestic goods. 
The change in relative prices affects spending, both at home and abroad. 
Because foreign goods are now more expensive, Americans buy less from other 
countries, causing U.S. imports of goods and services to decrease. At the same 
time, because U.S. goods are now cheaper, foreigners buy more from the United 
States, so U.S. exports increase. Net exports equal exports minus imports, so 
both of these changes cause U.S. net exports to increase. Thus, the fall in the real 
exchange value of the dollar leads to an increase in the quantity of goods and 
services demanded.
This logic yields the third reason the aggregate-demand curve slopes 
downward. When a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the real 
value of the dollar declines in foreign exchange markets. This depreciation stimulates U.S. 
net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. Conversely, 
when the U.S. price level rises and causes U.S. interest rates to rise, the real value of the 
dollar increases, and this appreciation reduces U.S. net exports and the quantity of goods 
and services demanded.
Summing Up  There are three distinct but related reasons a fall in the price level 
increases the quantity of goods and services demanded: 
 1. Consumers are wealthier, which stimulates the demand for consumption 
goods. 
 2. Interest rates fall, which stimulates the demand for investment goods. 
 3. The currency depreciates, which stimulates the demand for net exports. 
The same three effects work in reverse: When the price level rises, decreased 
wealth depresses consumer spending, higher interest rates depress investment 
spending, and a currency appreciation depresses net exports.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Here is a thought experiment to hone your intuition about these effects. Imagine 
that one day you wake up and notice that, for some mysterious reason, the prices 
of all goods and services have fallen by half, so the dollars you are holding are 
worth twice as much. In real terms, you now have twice as much money as you 
had when you went to bed the night before. What would you do with the extra 
money? You could spend it at your favorite restaurant, increasing consumer 
spending. You could lend it out (by buying a bond or depositing it in your bank), 
reducing interest rates and increasing investment spending. Or you could invest 
it overseas (by buying shares in an international mutual fund), reducing the 
real exchange value of the dollar and increasing net exports. Whichever of these 
three responses you choose, the fall in the price level leads to an increase in the 
quantity of goods and services demanded. This is what the downward slope of 
the aggregate-demand curve represents.
It is important to keep in mind that the aggregate-demand curve (like all 
demand curves) is drawn holding “other things equal.” In particular, our three 
explanations of the downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve assume that 
the money supply is fixed. That is, we have been considering how a change in 
the price level affects the demand for goods and services, holding the amount 
of money in the economy constant. As we will see, a change in the quantity of 
money shifts the aggregate-demand curve. At this point, just keep in mind that 
the aggregate-demand curve is drawn for a given quantity of the money supply.
33-3b Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Might Shift
The downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve shows that a fall in the price 
level raises the overall quantity of goods and services demanded. Many other 
factors, however, affect the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given 
price level. When one of these other factors changes, the quantity of goods and 
services demanded at every price level changes and the aggregate-demand curve 
shifts.
Let’s consider some examples of events that shift aggregate demand. We can 
categorize them according to the component of spending that is most directly 
affected.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption  Suppose Americans suddenly 
become more concerned about saving for retirement and, as a result, reduce their 
current consumption. Because the quantity of goods and services demanded at 
any price level is lower, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left. Conversely, 
imagine that a stock market boom makes people wealthier and less concerned 
about saving. The resulting increase in consumer spending means a greater 
quantity of goods and services demanded at any given price level, so the 
aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
Thus, any event that changes how much people want to consume at a given 
price level shifts the aggregate-demand curve. One policy variable that has this 
effect is the level of taxation. When the government cuts taxes, it encourages 
people to spend more, so the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. When 
the government raises taxes, people cut back on their spending and the aggregate-
demand curve shifts to the left.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment  Any event that changes how much 
firms want to invest at a given price level also shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve. For instance, imagine that the computer industry introduces a faster

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
line of computers and many firms decide to invest in new computer systems. 
Because the quantity of goods and services demanded at any price level is higher, 
the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms become 
pessimistic about future business conditions, they may cut back on investment 
spending, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
Tax policy can also influence aggregate demand through investment. For 
example, an investment tax credit (a tax rebate tied to a firm’s investment 
spending) increases the quantity of investment goods that firms demand at 
any given interest rate and therefore shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the 
right. The repeal of an investment tax credit reduces investment and shifts the 
aggregate-demand curve to the left. 
Another policy variable that can influence investment and aggregate demand 
is the money supply. As we discuss more fully in the next chapter, an increase in 
the money supply lowers the interest rate in the short run. This decrease in the 
interest rate makes borrowing less costly, which stimulates investment spending 
and thereby shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, a decrease 
in the money supply raises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, 
and thereby shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left. Many economists 
believe that throughout U.S. history, changes in monetary policy have been an 
important source of shifts in aggregate demand.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases  The most direct way 
that policymakers shift the aggregate-demand curve is through government 
purchases. For example, suppose Congress decides to reduce purchases of new 
weapons systems. Because the quantity of goods and services demanded at any 
price level is lower, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left. Conversely, if 
state governments start building more highways, the result is a greater quantity of 
goods and services demanded at any price level, so the aggregate-demand curve 
shifts to the right.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports  Any event that changes net exports 
for a given price level also shifts aggregate demand. For instance, when Europe 
experiences a recession, it buys fewer goods from the United States. This reduces 
U.S. net exports at every price level and shifts the aggregate-demand curve for 
the U.S. economy to the left. When Europe recovers from its recession, it starts 
buying U.S. goods again and the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
Net exports can also change because international speculators cause 
movements in the exchange rate. Suppose, for instance, that these speculators lose 
confidence in foreign economies and want to move some of their wealth into the 
U.S. economy. In doing so, they bid up the value of the U.S. dollar in the foreign 
exchange market. This appreciation of the dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive 
compared to foreign goods, which depresses net exports and shifts the aggregate-
demand curve to the left. Conversely, speculation that causes a depreciation of the 
dollar stimulates net exports and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right.
Summing Up  In the next chapter, we analyze the aggregate-demand curve in more 
detail. There we examine more precisely how the tools of monetary and fiscal policy 
can shift aggregate demand and whether policymakers should use these tools for that 
purpose. At this point, however, you should have some idea about why the aggregate-
demand curve slopes downward and what kinds of events and policies can shift this 
curve. Table 1 summarizes what we have learned so far.

curve. In which direction would this event shift the curve?
TABLE 1
The Aggregate-Demand 
Curve: Summary
Why Does the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slope Downward?
1.  The Wealth Effect: A lower price level increases real wealth, which stimulates spending 
on consumption.
2.  The Interest-Rate Effect: A lower price level reduces the interest rate, which stimulates 
spending on investment. 
3.  The Exchange-Rate Effect: A lower price level causes the real exchange rate to 
depreciate, which stimulates spending on net exports.
Why Might the Aggregate-Demand Curve Shift?
1.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption: An event that causes consumers to spend 
more at a given price level (a tax cut, a stock market boom) shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve to the right. An event that causes consumers to spend less at a given price level (a 
tax hike, a stock market decline) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
2.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment: An event that causes firms to invest more at a 
given price level (optimism about the future, a fall in interest rates due to an increase in 
the money supply) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. An event that causes 
firms to invest less at a given price level (pessimism about the future, a rise in interest 
rates due to a decrease in the money supply) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left. 
3.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases: An increase in government 
purchases of goods and services (greater spending on defense or highway construction) 
shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. A decrease in government purchases 
on goods and services (a cutback in defense or highway spending) shifts the aggregate-
demand curve to the left.
4.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports: An event that raises spending on net 
exports at a given price level (a boom overseas, speculation that causes an exchange-
rate depreciation) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. An event that reduces 
spending on net exports at a given price level (a recession overseas, speculation that 
causes an exchange-rate appreciation) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
33-4 The Aggregate-Supply Curve
The aggregate-supply curve tells us the total quantity of goods and services that 
firms produce and sell at any given price level. Unlike the aggregate-demand curve, 
which always slopes downward, the aggregate-supply curve shows a relationship 
that depends crucially on the time horizon examined. In the long run, the aggregate-
supply curve is vertical, whereas in the short run, the aggregate-supply curve slopes upward. 
To understand short-run economic fluctuations, and how the short-run behavior 
of the economy deviates from its long-run behavior, we need to examine both the 
long-run aggregate-supply curve and the short-run aggregate-supply curve. 
33-4a  Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Is Vertical in the Long Run
What determines the quantity of goods and services supplied in the long run? We 
implicitly answered this question earlier in the book when we analyzed the process 
of economic growth. In the long run, an economy’s production of goods and services

713
CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
(its real GDP) depends on its supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources and on the 
available technology used to turn these factors of production into goods and services. 
When we analyzed these forces that govern long-run growth, we did not need 
to make any reference to the overall level of prices. We examined the price level 
in a separate chapter, where we saw that it was determined by the quantity of 
money. We learned that if two economies were identical except that one had 
twice as much money in circulation, the price level would be twice as high in 
the economy with more money. But since the amount of money does not affect 
technology or the supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources, the output of 
goods and services in the two economies would be the same.
Because the price level does not affect the long-run determinants of real GDP, 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, as in Figure 4. In other words, 
in the long run, the economy’s labor, capital, natural resources, and technology 
determine the total quantity of goods and services supplied, and this quantity 
supplied is the same regardless of what the price level happens to be.
The vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve is a graphical representation of 
the classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality. As we have already discussed, 
classical macroeconomic theory is based on the assumption that real variables 
do not depend on nominal variables. The long-run aggregate-supply curve is 
consistent with this idea because it implies that the quantity of output (a real 
variable) does not depend on the level of prices (a nominal variable). As noted 
earlier, most economists believe this principle works well when studying the 
economy over a period of many years but not when studying year-to-year 
changes. Thus, the aggregate-supply curve is vertical only in the long run.
33-4b Why the Long-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift
Because classical macroeconomic theory predicts the quantity of goods and 
services produced by an economy in the long run, it also explains the position 
of the long-run aggregate-supply curve. The long-run level of production is 
FIGURE 4
The Long-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve
In the long run, the quantity of output 
supplied depends on the economy’s 
quantities of labor, capital, and natural 
resources and on the technology for 
turning these inputs into output. 
Because the quantity supplied does 
not depend on the overall price level, 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve is

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
sometimes called potential output or full-employment output. To be more precise, 
we call it the natural level of output because it shows what the economy 
produces when unemployment is at its natural, or normal, rate. The natural level 
of output is the rate of production toward which the economy gravitates in the 
long run. 
Any change in the economy that alters the natural level of output shifts the 
long-run aggregate-supply curve. Because output in the classical model depends 
on labor, capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge, we can 
categorize shifts in the long-run aggregate-supply curve as arising from these 
four sources. 
Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor  Imagine that an economy experiences an 
increase in immigration. Because there would be a greater number of workers, the 
quantity of goods and services supplied would increase. As a result, the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve would shift to the right. Conversely, if many workers left 
the economy to go abroad, the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to 
the left.
The position of the long-run aggregate-supply curve also depends on 
the natural rate of unemployment, so any change in the natural rate of 
unemployment shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve. For example, if 
Congress were to raise the minimum wage substantially, the natural rate of 
unemployment would rise and the economy would produce a smaller quantity 
of goods and services. As a result, the long-run aggregate-supply curve would 
shift to the left. Conversely, if a reform of the unemployment insurance system 
were to encourage unemployed workers to search harder for new jobs, the 
natural rate of unemployment would fall and the long-run aggregate-supply 
curve would shift to the right.
Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital  An increase in the economy’s capital 
stock increases productivity and, thereby, the quantity of goods and services 
supplied. As a result, the long-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right. 
Conversely, a decrease in the economy’s capital stock decreases productivity and 
the quantity of goods and services supplied, shifting the long-run aggregate-
supply curve to the left. 
Notice that the same logic applies regardless of whether we are discussing 
physical capital such as machines and factories or human capital such as college 
degrees. An increase in either type of capital will raise the economy’s ability to 
produce goods and services and, thus, shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
to the right. 
Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources  An economy’s production 
depends on its natural resources, including its land, minerals, and weather. The 
discovery of a new mineral deposit shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve to 
the right. A change in weather patterns that makes farming more difficult shifts 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.
In many countries, crucial natural resources are imported. A change in the 
availability of these resources can also shift the aggregate-supply curve. For 
example, as we discuss later in this chapter, events occurring in the world oil 
market have historically been an important source of shifts in aggregate supply 
for the United States and other oil-importing nations.

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Shifts Arising from Changes in Technological Knowledge  Perhaps the most 
important reason that the economy today produces more than it did a generation 
ago is that our technological knowledge has advanced. The invention of the 
computer, for instance, has allowed us to produce more goods and services from 
any given amounts of labor, capital, and natural resources. As computer use has 
spread throughout the economy, it has shifted the long-run aggregate-supply 
curve to the right.
Although not literally technological, many other events act like changes in 
technology. For instance, opening up international trade has effects similar to 
inventing new production processes because it allows a country to specialize in 
higher-productivity industries; therefore, it also shifts the long-run aggregate-
supply curve to the right. Conversely, if the government passes new regulations 
preventing firms from using some production methods, perhaps to address 
worker safety or environmental concerns, the result is a leftward shift in the long-
run aggregate-supply curve.
Summing Up  Because the long-run aggregate-supply curve reflects the classical 
model of the economy we developed in previous chapters, it provides a new 
way to describe our earlier analysis. Any policy or event that raised real GDP 
in previous chapters can now be described as increasing the quantity of goods 
and services supplied and shifting the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the 
right. Any policy or event that lowered real GDP in previous chapters can now be 
described as decreasing the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifting 
the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. 
33-4c  Using Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply to Depict 
Long-Run Growth and Inflation
Having introduced the economy’s aggregate-demand curve and the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve, we now have a new way to describe the economy’s long-
run trends. Figure 5 illustrates the changes that occur in an economy from decade 
to decade. Notice that both curves are shifting. Although many forces influence 
the economy in the long run and can in theory cause such shifts, the two most 
important forces in practice are technology and monetary policy. Technological 
progress enhances an economy’s ability to produce goods and services, and 
the resulting increases in output are reflected in continual shifts of the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve to the right. At the same time, because the Fed increases 
the money supply over time, the aggregate-demand curve also shifts to the right. 
As the figure illustrates, the result is continuing growth in output (as shown by 
increasing Y) and continuing inflation (as shown by increasing P). This is just 
another way of representing the classical analysis of growth and inflation we 
conducted in earlier chapters.
The purpose of developing the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply, however, is not to dress our previous long-run conclusions in new 
clothing. Instead, it is to provide a framework for short-run analysis, as we will 
see in a moment. As we develop the short-run model, we keep the analysis simple 
by omitting the continuing growth and inflation shown by the shifts in Figure 5. 
But always remember that long-run trends are the background on which short-
run fluctuations are superimposed. The short-run fluctuations in output and the price 
level that we will be studying should be viewed as deviations from the long-run trends of 
output growth and inflation.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
33-4d  Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward  
in the Short Run
The key difference between the economy in the short run and in the long run is 
the behavior of aggregate supply. The long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical 
because, in the long run, the overall level of prices does not affect the economy’s 
ability to produce goods and services. By contrast, in the short run, the price 
level does affect the economy’s output. That is, over a period of a year or two, an 
increase in the overall level of prices in the economy tends to raise the quantity of 
goods and services supplied, and a decrease in the level of prices tends to reduce 
the quantity of goods and services supplied. As a result, the short-run aggregate-
supply curve slopes upward, as shown in Figure 6. 
Why do changes in the price level affect output in the short run? Macro-
economists have proposed three theories for the upward slope of the short-run

Long-Run Growth and Inflation in 
the Model of Aggregate Demand 
and Aggregate Supply
As the economy becomes better able to produce goods and services over time, 
primarily because of technological progress, the long-run aggregate-supply curve 
shifts to the right. At the same time, as the Fed increases the money supply, the 
aggregate-demand curve also shifts to the right. In this figure, output grows from 
Y1990 to Y2000 and then to Y2010 and the price level rises from P1990 to P2000 and then 
to P2010. Thus, the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply offers a new 
way to describe the classical analysis of growth and inflation.

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
aggregate-supply curve. In each theory, a specific market imperfection causes the 
supply side of the economy to behave differently in the short run than it does in 
the long run. The following theories differ in their details, but they share a common 
theme: The quantity of output supplied deviates from its long-run, or natural, level when 
the actual price level in the economy deviates from the price level that people expected to 
prevail. When the price level rises above the level that people expected, output rises 
above its natural level, and when the price level falls below the expected level, 
output falls below its natural level.
The Sticky-Wage Theory  The first explanation of the upward slope of the short-
run aggregate-supply curve is the sticky-wage theory. This theory is the simplest 
of the three approaches to aggregate supply, and some economists believe it 
highlights the most important reason why the economy in the short run differs 
from the economy in the long run. Therefore, it is the theory of short-run aggregate 
supply that we emphasize in this book. 
According to this theory, the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward 
because nominal wages are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions. 
In other words, wages are “sticky” in the short run. To some extent, the slow 
adjustment of nominal wages is attributable to long-term contracts between 
workers and firms that fix nominal wages, sometimes for as long as 3 years. In 
addition, this prolonged adjustment may be attributable to slowly changing social 
norms and notions of fairness that influence wage setting. 
An example can help explain how sticky nominal wages can result in a short-
run aggregate-supply curve that slopes upward. Imagine that a year ago a firm 
expected the price level today to be 100, and based on this expectation, it signed 
a contract with its workers agreeing to pay them, say, $20 an hour. In fact, the 
price level turns out to be only 95. Because prices have fallen below expectations, 
the firm gets 5 percent less than expected for each unit of its product that it sells. 
The cost of labor used to make the output, however, is stuck at $20 per hour. 
Production is now less profitable, so the firm hires fewer workers and reduces 
FIGURE 6
The Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve
In the short run, a fall in the price level 
from P1 to P2 reduces the quantity 
of output supplied from Y1 to Y2. 
This positive relationship could be 
due to sticky wages, sticky prices, or 
misperceptions. Over time, wages, 
prices, and perceptions adjust, so this 
positive relationship is only temporary.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
the quantity of output supplied. Over time, the labor contract will expire, and the 
firm can renegotiate with its workers for a lower wage (which they may accept 
because prices are lower), but in the meantime, employment and production will 
remain below their long-run levels.
The same logic works in reverse. Suppose the price level turns out to be 105 and 
the wage remains stuck at $20. The firm sees that the amount it is paid for each 
unit sold is up by 5 percent, while its labor costs are not. In response, it hires more 
workers and increases the quantity of output supplied. Eventually, the workers 
will demand higher nominal wages to compensate for the higher price level, but 
for a while, the firm can take advantage of the profit opportunity by increasing 
employment and production above their long-run levels.
In short, according to the sticky-wage theory, the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve slopes upward because nominal wages are based on expected prices and do 
not respond immediately when the actual price level turns out to be different from 
what was expected. This stickiness of wages gives firms an incentive to produce 
less output when the price level turns out lower than expected and to produce 
more when the price level turns out higher than expected. 
The Sticky-Price Theory  Some economists have advocated another approach 
to explaining the upward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve, called 
the sticky-price theory. As we just discussed, the sticky-wage theory emphasizes 
that nominal wages adjust slowly over time. The sticky-price theory emphasizes 
that the prices of some goods and services also adjust sluggishly in response to 
changing economic conditions. This slow adjustment of prices occurs in part 
because there are costs to adjusting prices, called menu costs. These menu costs 
include the cost of printing and distributing catalogs and the time required to 
change price tags. As a result of these costs, prices as well as wages may be sticky 
in the short run.
To see how sticky prices explain the aggregate-supply curve’s upward slope, 
suppose that each firm in the economy announces its prices in advance based 
on the economic conditions it expects to prevail over the coming year. Suppose 
further that after prices are announced, the economy experiences an unexpected 
contraction in the money supply, which (as we have learned) will reduce the 
overall price level in the long run. What happens in the short run? Although 
some firms reduce their prices quickly in response to the unexpected change in 
economic conditions, many other firms want to avoid additional menu costs. As 
a result, they temporarily lag behind in cutting their prices. Because these lagging 
firms have prices that are too high, their sales decline. Declining sales, in turn, 
cause these firms to cut back on production and employment. In other words, 
because not all prices adjust immediately to changing conditions, an unexpected 
fall in the price level leaves some firms with higher-than-desired prices, and these 
higher-than-desired prices depress sales and induce firms to reduce the quantity 
of goods and services they produce. 
Similar reasoning applies when the money supply and price level turn out to 
be above what firms expected when they originally set their prices. While some 
firms raise their prices quickly in response to the new economic environment, 
other firms lag behind, keeping their prices at the lower-than-desired levels. These 
low prices attract customers, which induces these firms to increase employment 
and production. Thus, during the time these lagging firms are operating with 
outdated prices, there is a positive association between the overall price level and 
the quantity of output. This positive association is represented by the upward 
slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve.

719
CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
The Misperceptions Theory  A third approach to explaining the upward slope of 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve is the misperceptions theory. According to this 
theory, changes in the overall price level can temporarily mislead suppliers about 
what is happening in the individual markets in which they sell their output. As a 
result of these short-run misperceptions, suppliers respond to changes in the level 
of prices, and this response leads to an upward-sloping aggregate-supply curve.
To see how this might work, suppose the overall price level falls below the 
level that suppliers expected. When suppliers see the prices of their products fall, 
they may mistakenly believe that their relative prices have fallen; that is, they may 
believe that their prices have fallen compared to other prices in the economy. For 
example, wheat farmers may notice a fall in the price of wheat before they notice 
a fall in the prices of the many items they buy as consumers. They may infer from 
this observation that the reward for producing wheat is temporarily low, and they 
may respond by reducing the quantity of wheat they supply. Similarly, workers 
may notice a fall in their nominal wages before they notice that the prices of the 
goods they buy are also falling. They may infer that the reward for working is 
temporarily low and respond by reducing the quantity of labor they supply. In 
both cases, a lower price level causes misperceptions about relative prices, and 
these misperceptions induce suppliers to respond to the lower price level by 
decreasing the quantity of goods and services supplied. 
Similar misperceptions arise when the price level is above what was expected. 
Suppliers of goods and services may notice the price of their output rising and 
infer, mistakenly, that their relative prices are rising. They would conclude that it 
is a good time to produce. Until their misperceptions are corrected, they respond 
to the higher price level by increasing the quantity of goods and services supplied. 
This behavior results in a short-run aggregate-supply curve that slopes upward.
Summing Up  There are three alternative explanations for the upward slope 
of the short-run aggregate-supply curve: (1) sticky wages, (2) sticky prices, 
and (3) misperceptions about relative prices. Economists debate which of these 
theories is correct, and it is possible that each contains an element of truth. For 
our purposes in this book, the similarities of the theories are more important than 
the differences. All three theories suggest that output deviates in the short run 
from its natural level when the actual price level deviates from the price level that 
people had expected to prevail. We can express this mathematically as follows:
 
Quantity 
 
Natural 
 
   Actual 
 
Expected 
 
of output  
= 
level of 
+ 
a  price 
– 
price 
 
supplied

   level 
 
level
where a is a number that determines how much output responds to unexpected 
changes in the price level.
Notice that each of the three theories of short-run aggregate supply 
emphasizes a problem that is likely to be temporary. Whether the upward slope 
of the aggregate-supply curve is attributable to sticky wages, sticky prices, or 
misperceptions, these conditions will not persist forever. Over time, nominal 
wages will become unstuck, prices will become unstuck, and misperceptions 
about relative prices will be corrected. In the long run, it is reasonable to assume 
that wages and prices are flexible rather than sticky and that people are not 
confused about relative prices. Thus, while we have several good theories to 
explain why the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward, they are all 
consistent with a long-run aggregate-supply curve that is vertical.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
33-4e Why the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift
The short-run aggregate-supply curve tells us the quantity of goods and services 
supplied in the short run for any given level of prices. This curve is similar to the long-
run aggregate-supply curve, but it is upward-sloping rather than vertical because 
of sticky wages, sticky prices, and misperceptions. Thus, when thinking about what 
shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve, we have to consider all those variables 
that shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve. In addition, we have to consider a 
new variable—the expected price level—that influences the wages that are stuck, the 
prices that are stuck, and the perceptions about relative prices that may be flawed.
Let’s start with what we know about the long-run aggregate-supply curve. 
As we discussed earlier, shifts in the long-run aggregate-supply curve normally 
arise from changes in labor, capital, natural resources, or technological knowl-
edge. These same variables shift the short-run aggregate-supply curve. For ex-
ample, when an increase in the economy’s capital stock increases productivity, 
the economy is able to produce more output, so both the long-run and short-run 
aggregate-supply curves shift to the right. When an increase in the minimum 
wage raises the natural rate of unemployment, the economy has fewer employed 
workers and thus produces less output, so both the long-run and short-run aggre-
gate-supply curves shift to the left.
The important new variable that affects the position of the short-run aggre-
gate-supply curve is the price level that people expected to prevail. As we have 
discussed, the quantity of goods and services supplied depends, in the short run, 
on sticky wages, sticky prices, and misperceptions. Yet wages, prices, and per-
ceptions are set based on the expected price level. So when people change their 
expectations of the price level, the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts.
To make this idea more concrete, let’s consider a specific theory of aggregate 
supply—the sticky-wage theory. According to this theory, when workers and firms 
expect the price level to be high, they are likely to reach a bargain with a higher 
level of nominal wages. Higher wages raise firms’ costs, and for any given actual 
price level, higher costs reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied. Thus, 
when the expected price level rises, wages are higher, costs increase, and firms 
produce a smaller quantity of goods and services at any given actual price level. 
Thus, the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left. Conversely, when the 
expected price level falls, wages are lower, costs decline, firms increase output at 
any given price level, and the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right.
A similar logic applies in each theory of aggregate supply. The general lesson is 
the following: An increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and 
services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. A decrease in 
the expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-
run aggregate-supply curve to the right. As we will see in the next section, the influence 
of expectations on the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve plays a key 
role in explaining how the economy makes the transition from the short run to the 
long run. In the short run, expectations are fixed and the economy finds itself at the 
intersection of the aggregate-demand curve and the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve. In the long run, if people observe that the price level is different from what 
they expected, their expectations adjust and the short-run aggregate-supply curve 
shifts. This shift ensures that the economy eventually finds itself at the intersection 
of the aggregate-demand curve and the long-run aggregate-supply curve.
You should now have some understanding about why the short-run aggregate-
supply curve slopes upward and what events and policies can cause this curve to 
shift. Table 2 summarizes our discussion.

The Short-Run Aggregate-
Supply Curve: Summary
Why Does the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Slope Upward?
1.  The Sticky-Wage Theory: An unexpectedly low price level raises the real wage, which 
causes firms to hire fewer workers and produce a smaller quantity of goods and services. 
2.  The Sticky-Price Theory: An unexpectedly low price level leaves some firms with higher-
than-desired prices, which depresses their sales and leads them to cut back production.
3.  The Misperceptions Theory: An unexpectedly low price level leads some suppliers to 
think their relative prices have fallen, which induces a fall in production.
Why Might the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Shift?
1.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor: An increase in the quantity of labor available 
(perhaps due to a fall in the natural rate of unemployment) shifts the aggregate-supply 
curve to the right. A decrease in the quantity of labor available (perhaps due to a rise in 
the natural rate of unemployment) shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the left.
2.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital: An increase in physical or human capital shifts 
the aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease in physical or human capital shifts 
the aggregate-supply curve to the left.
3.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources: An increase in the availability of 
natural resources shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease in the 
availability of natural resources shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the left. 
4.  Shifts Arising from Changes in Technology: An advance in technological knowledge shifts 
the aggregate-supply curve to the right. A decrease in the available technology (perhaps 
due to government regulation) shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the left.
5.  Shifts Arising from Changes in the Expected Price Level: A decrease in the expected 
price level shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. An increase in the 
expected price level shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.
33-5 Two Causes of Economic Fluctuations
Now that we have introduced the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply, we have the basic tools we need to analyze fluctuations in economic 
activity. In particular, we can use what we have learned about aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply to examine the two basic causes of short-run fluctuations
: shifts in aggregate demand and shifts in aggregate supply.
To keep things simple, we assume the economy begins in long-run equilibrium, 
as shown in Figure 7. Output and the price level are determined in the long run 
by the intersection of the aggregate-demand curve and the long-run aggregate-
supply curve, shown as point A in the figure. At this point, output is at its natural 
level. Because the economy is always in a short-run equilibrium, the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve passes through this point as well, indicating that the 
expected price level has adjusted to this long-run equilibrium. That is, when an 
economy is in its long-run equilibrium, the expected price level must equal the 
actual price level so that the intersection of aggregate demand with short-run

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
aggregate supply is the same as the intersection of aggregate demand with long-
run aggregate supply.
33-5a The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Demand
Suppose that a wave of pessimism suddenly overtakes the economy. The cause 
might be a scandal in the White House, a crash in the stock market, or the 
outbreak of war overseas. Because of this event, many people lose confidence in 
the future and alter their plans. Households cut back on their spending and delay 
major purchases, and firms put off buying new equipment. 
What is the macroeconomic impact of such a wave of pessimism? In answering 
this question, we can follow the three steps we used in Chapter 4 when analyzing 
supply and demand in specific markets. First, we determine whether the event 
affects aggregate demand or aggregate supply. Second, we determine the 
direction that the curve shifts. Third, we use the diagram of aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply to compare the initial and the new equilibrium. The new 
wrinkle is that we need to add a fourth step: We have to keep track of a new short-
run equilibrium, a new long-run equilibrium, and the transition between them. 
Table 3 summarizes the four steps to analyzing economic fluctuations.
FIGURE 7
The Long-Run Equilibrium
The long-run equilibrium of the 
economy is found where the aggregate-
demand curve crosses the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve (point A).  
When the economy reaches this 
long-run equilibrium, the expected 
price level will have adjusted to equal 
the actual price level. As a result, 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve 
crosses this point as well.

723
CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
The first two steps are straightforward. First, because the wave of pessimism 
affects spending plans, it affects the aggregate-demand curve. Second, because 
households and firms now want to buy a smaller quantity of goods and services 
for any given price level, the event reduces aggregate demand. As Figure 8 shows, 
the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left from AD1 to AD2.
With this figure, we can perform step three: By comparing the initial and the new 
equilibrium, we can see the effects of the fall in aggregate demand. In the short run, 
the economy moves along the initial short-run aggregate-supply curve, AS1, going 
from point A to point B. As the economy moves between these two points, output 
falls from Y1 to Y2 and the price level falls from P1 to P2. The falling level of output 
indicates that the economy is in a recession. Although not shown in the figure, 
firms respond to lower sales and production by reducing employment. Thus, the 
pessimism that caused the shift in aggregate demand is, to some extent, self-fulfilling: 
Pessimism about the future leads to falling incomes and rising unemployment.
Now comes step four—the transition from the short-run equilibrium to the 
new long-run equilibrium. Because of the reduction in aggregate demand, the 
price level initially falls from P1 to P2. The price level is thus below the level that 
people were expecting (P1) before the sudden fall in aggregate demand. People 
can be surprised in the short run, but they will not remain surprised. Over time, 
their expectations catch up with this new reality, and the expected price level falls 
as well. The fall in the expected price level alters wages, prices, and perceptions, 
which in turn influences the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. 
For example, according to the sticky-wage theory, once workers and firms come 
to expect a lower level of prices, they start to strike bargains for lower nominal 
wages; the reduction in labor costs encourages firms to hire more workers and 
expand production at any given level of prices. Thus, the fall in the expected price 
level shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right from AS1 to AS2
in Figure 8. This shift allows the economy to approach point C, where the new 
aggregate-demand curve (AD2) crosses the long-run aggregate-supply curve. 
FIGURE 8
A Contraction in Aggregate Demand
A fall in aggregate demand is represented 
with a leftward shift in the aggregate-
demand curve from AD1 to AD2. In the 
short run, the economy moves from point A 
to point B. Output falls from Y1 to Y2, and 
the price level falls from P1 to P2. Over time, 
as the expected price level adjusts, the 
short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to 
the right from AS1 to AS2, and the economy 
reaches point C, where the new aggregate-
demand curve crosses the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve. In the long run, the 
price level falls to P3, and output returns to 
its natural level, Y1.

The economy has corrected itself: The decline in output is reversed in the long 
run, even without action by policymakers. Although the wave of pessimism has 
reduced aggregate demand, the price level has fallen sufficiently (to P3) to offset 
the shift in the aggregate-demand curve, and people have come to expect this new 
lower price level as well. Thus, in the long run, the shift in aggregate demand 
is reflected fully in the price level and not at all in the level of output. In other 
words, the long-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand is a nominal change (the 
price level is lower) but not a real change (output is the same).
What should policymakers do when faced with a sudden fall in aggregate 
demand? In this analysis, we assumed they did nothing. Another possibility is 
that, as soon as the economy heads into recession (moving from point A to point B), 
policymakers could take action to increase aggregate demand. As we noted earlier, 
an increase in government spending or an increase in the money supply would 
increase the quantity of goods and services demanded at any price and, therefore, 
would shift the aggregate-demand curve to the right. If policymakers act with 
sufficient speed and precision, they can offset the initial shift in aggregate demand, 
return the aggregate-demand curve to AD1, and bring the economy back to point A. 
If the policy is successful, the painful period of depressed output and employment 
can be reduced in length and severity. The next chapter discusses in more detail 
the ways in which monetary and fiscal policy influence aggregate demand, as well 
as some of the practical difficulties in using these policy instruments. 
To sum up, this story about shifts in aggregate demand has three important lessons:
• In the short run, shifts in aggregate demand cause fluctuations in the 
economy’s output of goods and services.
• In the long run, shifts in aggregate demand affect the overall price level but 
do not affect output.
• Because policymakers influence aggregate demand, they can potentially 
mitigate the severity of economic fluctuations. 
Monetary Neutrality Revisited
A
ccording to classical economic theory, money is neutral. That is, 
changes in the quantity of money affect nominal variables such 
as the price level but not real variables such as output. Earlier in this 
chapter, we noted that most economists accept this conclusion as a 
description of how the economy works in the long run but not in the short 
run. With the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, we can 
illustrate this conclusion and explain it more fully.
Suppose that the Federal Reserve reduces the quantity of money in 
the economy. What effect does this change have? As we discussed, the 
money supply is one determinant of aggregate demand. The reduction in 
the money supply shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
The analysis looks just like Figure 8. Even though the cause of the 
shift in aggregate demand is different, we would observe the same 
effects on output and the price level. In the short run, both output and 
the price level fall. The economy experiences a recession. But over time, 
the expected price level falls as 
well. Firms and workers respond 
to their new expectations by, for 
instance, agreeing to lower nominal 
wages. As they do so, the short-
run aggregate-supply curve shifts 
to the right. Eventually, the economy finds itself back on the long-run 
aggregate-supply curve.
Figure 8 shows when money matters for real variables and when 
it does not. In the long run, money is neutral, as represented by the 
movement of the economy from point A to point C. But in the short 
run, a change in the money supply has real effects, as represented by 
the movement of the economy from point A to point B. An old saying 
summarizes the analysis: “Money is a veil, but when the veil flutters, 
real output sputters.” ■

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
TWO BIG SHIFTS IN AGGREGATE DEMAND: THE GREAT 
DEPRESSION AND WORLD WAR II
At the beginning of this chapter, we established three key facts about 
economic fluctuations by looking at data since 1972. Let’s now take
a longer look at U.S. economic history. Figure 9 shows data since 1900 
on the percentage change in real GDP over the previous 3 years. In an average 
3-year period, real GDP grows about 10 percent—a bit more than 3 percent per 
year. The business cycle, however, causes fluctuations around this average. Two 
episodes jump out as being particularly significant: the large drop in real GDP in 
the early 1930s and the large increase in real GDP in the early 1940s. Both of these 
events are attributable to shifts in aggregate demand.
The economic calamity of the early 1930s is called the Great Depression, and it is 
by far the largest economic downturn in U.S. history. Real GDP fell by 27 percent 
from 1929 to 1933, and unemployment rose from 3 percent to 25 percent. At the 
same time, the price level fell by 22 percent over these 4 years. Many other coun-
tries experienced similar declines in output and prices during this period. 
Economic historians continue to debate the causes of the Great Depression, but 
most explanations center on a large decline in aggregate demand. What caused 
aggregate demand to contract? Here is where the disagreement arises. 
Many economists place primary blame on the decline in the money supply: 
From 1929 to 1933, the money supply fell by 28 percent. As you may recall from our 
discussion of the monetary system, this decline in the money supply was due to 
problems in the banking system. As households withdrew their money from finan-
cially shaky banks and bankers became more cautious and started holding greater 
reserves, the process of money creation under fractional-reserve banking went into 
reverse. The Fed, meanwhile, failed to offset this fall in the money multiplier with 
expansionary open-market operations. As a result, the money supply declined. 
Many economists blame the Fed’s failure to act for the Great Depression’s severity.

Over the course of U.S. economic history, two fluctuations stand out as especially large. 
During the early 1930s, the economy went through the Great Depression, when the 
production of goods and services plummeted. During the early 1940s, the United States 
entered World War II and the economy experienced rapidly rising production. Both of 
these events are usually explained by large shifts in aggregate demand.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Other economists have suggested alternative reasons for the collapse in aggre-
gate demand. For example, stock prices fell about 90 percent during this period, 
depressing household wealth and thereby consumer spending. In addition, the 
banking problems may have prevented some firms from obtaining the financ-
ing they wanted for new projects and business expansions, reducing investment 
spending. It is possible that all these forces may have acted together to contract 
aggregate demand during the Great Depression.
The second significant episode in Figure 9—the economic boom of the early 
1940s—is easier to explain. The cause of this event was World War II. As the 
United States entered the war overseas, the federal government had to  devote 
more resources to the military. Government purchases of goods and services  
increased almost fivefold from 1939 to 1944. This huge expansion in aggregate 
demand almost doubled the economy’s production of goods and services and led 
to a 20 percent increase in the price level (although widespread government price 
controls limited the rise in prices). Unemployment fell from 17 percent in 1939 to 
about 1 percent in 1944—the lowest level in U.S. history. ●
THE GREAT RECESSION OF 2008–2009
In 2008 and 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a financial crisis and 
a severe downturn in economic activity. In many ways, it was the 
worst macroeconomic event in more than half a century.
The story of this downturn begins a few years earlier with a substantial boom in the 
housing market. The boom was, in part, fueled by low interest rates. In the aftermath of 
the recession of 2001, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to historically low lev-
els. Low interest rates helped the economy recover, but by making it less expensive to 
get a mortgage and buy a home, they also contributed to a rise in housing prices.
In addition to low interest rates, various developments in the mortgage market 
made it easier for subprime borrowers—those borrowers with a higher risk of default 
based on their income and credit history—to get loans to buy homes. One develop-
ment was securitization, the process by which a financial institution (specifically, a 
mortgage originator) makes loans and then (with the help of an investment bank) 
bundles them together into financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities. 
These mortgage-backed securities were then sold to other institutions (such as banks 
and insurance companies), which may not have fully appreciated the risks in these 
securities. Some economists blame inadequate regulation for these high-risk loans. 
Others blame misguided government policy: Certain policies encouraged this high-
risk lending to make the goal of homeownership more attainable for low-income 
families. Together, these many forces drove up housing demand and housing prices. 
From 1995 to 2006, average housing prices in the United States more than doubled.
The high price of housing, however, proved unsustainable. From 2006 to 2009, 
housing prices nationwide fell about 30 percent. Such price fluctuations should not 
necessarily be a problem in a market economy. After all, price movements are how 
markets equilibrate supply and demand. In this case, however, the price decline 
had two related repercussions that caused a sizable fall in aggregate demand.
The first repercussion was a substantial rise in mortgage defaults and home fore-
closures. During the housing boom, many homeowners had bought their homes 
with mostly borrowed money and minimal down payments. When housing prices 
declined, these homeowners were underwater (they owed more on their mortgages 
than their homes were worth). Many of these homeowners stopped repaying their 
loans. The banks servicing the mortgages responded to these defaults by taking 
the houses away in foreclosure procedures and then selling them off. The banks’

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
goal was to recoup whatever they could from the bad loans. As you might have 
expected from your study of supply and demand, the increase in the number of 
homes for sale exacerbated the downward spiral of house prices. As house prices 
fell, spending on the construction of housing also collapsed.
A second repercussion was that the various financial institutions that owned 
mortgage-backed securities suffered huge losses. In essence, by borrowing large 
sums to buy high-risk mortgages, these companies had bet that house prices would 
keep rising; when this bet turned bad, they found themselves at or near the point of 
bankruptcy. Because of these large losses, many financial institutions did not have 
funds to loan out and the ability of the financial system to channel resources to 
those who could best use them was impaired. Even creditworthy customers found 
themselves unable to borrow to finance investment spending.
As a result of all these events, the economy experienced a large contractionary 
shift in aggregate demand. Real GDP and employment both fell sharply. The intro-
duction to this chapter has already cited the figures, but they are worth repeating: 
Real GDP declined by 4.2 percent between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the sec-
ond quarter of 2009, and the rate of unemployment rose from 4.4 percent in May 
2007 to 10.0 percent in October 2009. This experience served as a vivid reminder 
that deep economic downturns and personal hardship they cause are not a relic of 
history but a constant risk in the modern economy.
As the crisis unfolded, the U.S. government responded in a variety of ways. 
Three policy actions—all aimed in part at returning aggregate demand to its previ-
ous level—are most noteworthy. 
First, the Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in September 
2007 to about zero in December 2008. The Federal Reserve also started buying mort-
gage-backed securities and other private loans in open-market operations. By purchas-
ing these instruments from the banking system, the Fed provided banks with additional 
funds in the hope that the banks would makes loans more readily available. 
Second, in an even more unusual move in October 2008, Congress appropriated 
$700 billion for the Treasury to use to rescue the financial system. Much of this money 
was used for equity injections into banks. That is, the Treasury put funds into the 
banking system, which the banks could use to make loans and otherwise continue 
their normal operations; in exchange for these funds, the U.S. government became a 
part owner of these banks, at least temporarily. The goal of this policy was to stem the 
crisis on Wall Street and make it easier for businesses and individuals to obtain loans.
Finally, when Barack Obama became president in January 2009, his first major ini-
tiative was a large increase in government spending. After a relatively brief congres-
sional debate over the form of the legislation, the new president signed a $787 billion 
stimulus bill on February 17, 2009. This policy move is discussed more fully in the 
next chapter when we consider the impact of fiscal policy on aggregate demand.
The recovery from this recession officially began in June 2009. But it was, by 
historical standards, only a meager recovery. From the second quarter of 2009 to 
the fourth quarter of 2015, real GDP growth averaged only 2.1 percent per year, 
well below the average rate of growth over the past half century of about 3 per-
cent. Although unemployment fell to 5.0 percent by the end of 2015, much of the 
 decline was attributable to individuals leaving the labor force rather than finding 
jobs. In December 2015, the employment-to-population ratio was only 1.3 percent-
age points higher than at its trough during the Great Recession and was more than 
3 percentage points lower than before the downturn began.
Which, if any, of the many policy moves were most important for ending the reces-
sion? And what other policies might have promoted a more robust recovery? These are 
surely questions that macroeconomic historians will debate in the years to come. ●

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Since the financial crisis and Great 
Recession of 2008–2009, economists 
have asked themselves how this 
episode should change the field of 
macroeconomics.
Olivier Blanchard’s Five  
Lessons for Economists from 
the Financial Crisis
By David Wessel
W
hat did the worst financial crisis and 
deepest recession in 75 years teach 
academic economists and policymakers 
on whose watch it happened? At a recent 
London School of Economics forum, con-
vened to honor Bank of England Governor 
Mervyn King, Olivier Blanchard offered some 
answers.
Mr. Blanchard, 64 years old, is well  
positioned to offer such reconsideration. An 
internationally prominent macroeconomist, 
he spent 25 years on the MIT faculty before 
becoming chief economist at the International 
Monetary Fund in September 2008, just before 
the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Here are Mr. Blanchard’s five lessons 
in his own words, lightly edited by The Wall 
Street Journal’s David Wessel:
#1: Humility is in order.
The Great Moderation [the economically 
tranquil period from 1987 to 2007] convinced 
too many of us that the large-economy 
crisis—a financial crisis, a banking crisis—
was a thing of the past. It wasn’t going to 
happen again, except maybe in emerging 
markets. History was marching on.
My generation, which was born after World 
War II, lived with the notion that the world 
was getting to be a better and better place. 
We knew how to do things better, not only in 
economics but in other fields as well. What we 
have learned is that’s not true. History repeats 
itself. We should have known.
#2: The financial system matters— a lot.
It’s not the first time that we’re 
confronted with what [former U.S. Defense 
Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld called “unknown 
unknowns,” things that happened that 
we hadn’t thought about. There is another 
example in macroeconomics:
The oil shocks of the 1970s during which 
we were students and we hadn’t thought 
about it. It took a few years, more than a few 
years, for economists to understand what was 
going on. After a few years, we concluded that 
we could think of the oil shock as yet another 
macroeconomic shock. We did not need to 
understand the plumbing. We didn’t need to 
understand the details of the oil market. When 
there’s an increase in the price of energy or 
materials, we can just integrate it into our 
macro models—the implications of energy 
prices on inflation and so on.
This is different. What we have learned 
about the financial system is that the problem 
is in the plumbing and that we have to 
understand the plumbing. Before I came to 
the Fund, I thought of the financial system 
as a set of arbitrage equations. Basically the 
Federal Reserve would choose one interest 
rate, and then the expectations hypothesis 
would give all the rates everywhere else with 
premia which might vary, but not very much. 
It was really easy. I thought of people on Wall 
Street as basically doing this for me so I didn’t 
have to think about it.
What we have learned is that that’s not 
the case. In the financial system, a myriad 
of distortions or small shocks build on each 
other. When there are enough small shocks, 
enough distortions, things can go very 
bad. This has fundamental implications 
for macroeconomics. We do macro on the 
assumption that we can look at aggregates 
in some way and then just have them interact 
in simple models. I still think that’s the way to 
go, but this shows the limits of that approach. 
When it comes to the financial system, it’s 
very clear that the details of the plumbing 
matter.
#3 Interconnectedness matters.
This crisis started in the U.S. and across 
the ocean in a matter of days and weeks. Each 
crisis, even in small islands, potentially has 
effects on the rest of the world. The complexity 
of the cross border claims by creditors and 
by debtors clearly is something that many 
of us had not fully realized: the cross border 
movements triggered by the risk-on/risk-off 
movements, which countries are safe havens, 
and when and why? Understanding this has 
become absolutely essential. What happens in 
one part of the world cannot be ignored by the 
rest of the world. The fact that we all spend so

much time thinking about Cyprus in the last 
few days is an example of that.
It’s also true on the trade side. We used 
to think if one country was doing badly, then 
exports to that country would do badly and 
therefore the exporting countries would do 
badly. In our models, the effect was relatively 
small. One absolutely striking fact of the crisis 
is the collapse of trade in 2009. Output went 
down. Trade collapsed. Countries which felt 
they were not terribly exposed through trade 
turned out to be enormously exposed.
#4 We don’t know if macro-prudential 
tools work.
It’s very clear that the traditional monetary 
and fiscal tools are just not good enough to 
deal with the very specific problems in 
the financial system. This has led to the 
development of macro-prudential tools, 
which may or may not become the third leg of 
macroeconomic policies.
[Macro-prudential tools allow a central 
bank to restrain lending in specific sectors 
without raising interest rates for the whole 
economy, such as increasing the minimum 
down payment required to get a mortgage, 
which reduces the loan-to-value ratio.] In 
principle, they can address specific issues 
in the financial sector. If there is a problem 
somewhere you can target the tool at the 
problem and not use the policy interest rate, 
which basically is kind of an atomic bomb 
without any precision.
The big question here is: How reliable are 
these tools? How much can they be used? 
The answer—from some experiments before 
the crisis with loan-to-value ratios and 
during the crisis with variations in cyclical 
bank capital ratios or loan-to-value ratios or 
capital controls, such as in Brazil—is this: 
They work but they don’t work great. People 
and institutions find ways around them. In the 
process of reducing the problem somewhere 
you tend to create distortions elsewhere.
#5 Central bank independence wasn’t 
designed for what central banks are 
now asked to do.
There is two-way interaction between 
monetary 
policy 
and 
macro-prudential 
tools. When [Fed chair] Ben Bernanke does 
expansionary monetary policy, quantitative 
easing, and interest rates on many assets 
are close to zero, there’s a tendency by many 
players to take risks to increase their rate of 
return. Some of this risk actually we want 
them to take. Some we don’t want them to 
take. That is the interaction of monetary policy 
on the financial system.
You also have it the other way around. If 
you use macro-prudential tools to, say, slow 
down the building in the housing sector you 
have an effect on aggregate demand, which is 
going to decrease output.
The question is: How do you organize 
the use of these tools? It makes sense to 
have them under the same roof. In practice 
this means the central bank. But that poses 
questions not only about coordination between 
the two functions, but also about central bank 
independence.
One of the major achievements of the 
last 20 years is that most central banks have 
become independent of elected governments. 
Independence was given because the 
mandate and the tools were very clear. The 
mandate was primarily inflation, which 
can be observed over time. The tool was 
some short-term interest rate that could be 
used by the central bank to try to achieve 
the inflation target. In this case, you can 
give some independence to the institution 
in charge of this because the objective is 
perfectly well defined, and everybody can 
basically observe how well the central bank 
does..
If you think now of central banks as having 
a much larger set of responsibilities and a 
much larger set of tools, then the issue of 
central bank independence becomes much 
more difficult. Do you actually want to give the 
central bank the independence to choose loan-
to-value ratios without any supervision from 
the political process? Isn’t this going to lead 
to a democratic deficit in a way in which the 
central bank becomes too powerful? I’m sure 
there are ways out. Perhaps there could be 
independence with respect to some dimensions 
of monetary policy—the traditional ones—
and some supervision for the rest or some 
interaction with a political process. ■

cost of producing food products. Or a war in the Middle East might interrupt the 
shipping of crude oil, driving up the cost of producing oil products.
To analyze the macroeconomic impact of such an increase in production costs, 
we follow the same four steps as always. First, which curve is affected? Because 
production costs affect the firms that supply goods and services, changes in

730
PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
production costs alter the position of the aggregate-supply curve. Second, in 
which direction does the curve shift? Because higher production costs make selling 
goods and services less profitable, firms now supply a smaller quantity of output 
for any given price level. Thus, as Figure 10 shows, the short-run aggregate-
supply curve shifts to the left, from AS1 to AS2. (Depending on the event, the long-
run aggregate-supply curve might also shift. To keep things simple, however, we 
will assume that it does not.)
The figure allows us to perform step three of comparing the initial and the 
new equilibrium. In the short run, the economy goes from point A to point B, 
moving along the existing aggregate-demand curve. The output of the economy 
falls from Y1 to Y2, and the price level rises from P1 to P2. Because the economy is 
experiencing both stagnation (falling output) and inflation (rising prices), such an 
event is sometimes called stagflation.
Now consider step four—the transition from the short-run equilibrium to the 
long-run equilibrium. According to the sticky-wage theory, the key issue is how 
stagflation affects nominal wages. Firms and workers may at first respond to the 
higher level of prices by raising their expectations of the price level and setting 
higher nominal wages. In this case, firms’ costs will rise yet again, and the short-
run aggregate-supply curve will shift farther to the left, making the problem 
of stagflation even worse. This phenomenon of higher prices leading to higher 
wages, in turn leading to even higher prices, is sometimes called a wage-price spiral. 
At some point, this spiral of ever-rising wages and prices will slow. The low 
level of output and employment will put downward pressure on workers’ wages 
because workers have less bargaining power when unemployment is high. As 
nominal wages fall, producing goods and services becomes more profitable and 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right. As it shifts back toward 
AS1, the price level falls and the quantity of output approaches its natural level. In 
stagflation

the long run, the economy returns to point A, where the aggregate-demand curve 
crosses the long-run aggregate-supply curve.
This transition back to the initial equilibrium assumes, however, that aggregate 
demand is held constant throughout the process. In the real world, that may not be 
the case. Policymakers who control monetary and fiscal policy might attempt to offset 
some of the effects of the shift in the short-run aggregate-supply curve by shifting the 
aggregate-demand curve. This possibility is shown in Figure 11. In this case, changes 
in policy shift the aggregate-demand curve to the right, from AD1 to AD2—exactly 
enough to prevent the shift in aggregate supply from affecting output. The economy 
moves directly from point A to point C. Output remains at its natural level, and the 
price level rises from P1 to P3. In this case, policymakers are said to accommodate the 
shift in aggregate supply. An accommodative policy accepts a permanently higher 
level of prices to maintain a higher level of output and employment. 
To sum up, this story about shifts in aggregate supply has two important lessons:
• Shifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession 
(falling output) and inflation (rising prices). 
• Policymakers who can influence aggregate demand can potentially mitigate 
the adverse impact on output but only at the cost of exacerbating the 
problem of inflation.

OIL AND THE ECONOMY
Some of the largest economic fluctuations in the U.S. economy since 
1970 have originated in the oil fields of the Middle East. Crude oil 
is a key input into the production of many goods and services, and 
much of the world’s oil comes from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Middle 
Eastern countries. When some event (usually political in origin) reduces the

Accommodating an Adverse  
Shift in Aggregate Supply
Faced with an adverse shift in 
aggregate supply from AS1 to AS2, 
policymakers who can influence 
aggregate demand might try to shift 
the aggregate-demand curve to the 
right from AD1 to AD2. The economy 
would move from point A to point C. 
This policy would prevent the supply 
shift from reducing output in the 
short run, but the price level would 
permanently rise from P1 to P3.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
supply of crude oil flowing from this region, the price of oil rises around the 
world. Firms in the United States that produce gasoline, tires, and many other 
products experience rising costs, and they find it less profitable to supply their 
output of goods and services at any given price level. The result is a leftward shift 
in the aggregate-supply curve, which in turn leads to stagflation.
The first episode of this sort occurred in the mid-1970s. The countries with 
large oil reserves got together as members of OPEC, the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC is a cartel—a group of sellers that at-
tempts to thwart competition and reduce production to raise prices. And in-
deed, oil prices rose substantially. From 1973 to 1975, oil approximately doubled 
in price. Oil-importing countries around the world experienced simultaneous 
inflation and recession. The U.S. inflation rate as measured by the CPI exceeded 
10 percent for the first time in decades. Unemployment rose from 4.9 percent in 
1973 to 8.5 percent in 1975.
Almost the same thing happened a few years later. In the late 1970s, the OPEC 
countries again restricted the supply of oil to raise the price. From 1978 to 1981, 
the price of oil more than doubled. Once again, the result was stagflation. Infla-
tion, which had subsided somewhat after the first OPEC event, again rose above 
10 percent per year. But because the Fed was not willing to accommodate such a 
large rise in inflation, a recession was soon to follow. Unemployment rose from 
about 6 percent in 1978 and 1979 to about 10 percent a few years later.
The world market for oil can also be a source of favorable shifts in aggre-
gate supply. In 1986, squabbling broke out among members of OPEC. Mem-
ber countries reneged on their agreements to restrict oil production. In the 
world market for crude oil, prices fell by about half. This fall in oil prices 
reduced costs to U.S. firms, which now found it more profitable to supply 
goods and services at any given price level. As a result, the aggregate-supply 
The Origins of the Model of Aggregate Demand  
and Aggregate Supply
N
ow that we have a preliminary 
understanding of the model of 
aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply, it is worthwhile to step 
back from it and consider its 
history. How did this model of 
short-run fluctuations develop? 
The answer is that this model, to 
a large extent, is a by-product of 
the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Economists and policymakers at 
the time were puzzled about what 
had caused this calamity and were 
uncertain about how to deal with it.
In 1936, economist John Maynard Keynes published a book titled The 
General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, which attempted to 
explain short-run economic fluctuations in general and the Great Depression 
in particular. Keynes’s primary message was that recessions and depressions 
can occur because of inadequate aggregate demand for goods and services. 
Keynes had long been a 
critic of classical economic 
theory—the theory we examined 
earlier in the book—because it 
could explain only the long-run 
effects of policies. A few years before offering The General Theory, Keynes 
had written the following about classical economics:
The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run 
we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a 
task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us when the storm 
is long past, the ocean will be flat.
Keynes’s message was aimed at policymakers as well as economists. 
As the world’s economies suffered with high unemployment, Keynes 
advocated policies to increase aggregate demand, including government 
spending on public works. 
In the next chapter, we examine in detail how policymakers can use 
the tools of monetary and fiscal policy to influence aggregate demand. 
The analysis in the next chapter, as well as in this one, owes much to the 
legacy of John Maynard Keynes. ■

curve shifted to the right. The U.S. economy experienced the opposite of 
stagflation: Output grew rapidly, unemployment fell, and the inflation rate 
reached its lowest level in many years.
In recent years, the world market for oil has not been as important a source of 
economic fluctuations for the U.S. economy. Part of the reason is that conservation 
efforts, changes in technology, and the availability of alternative energy sources 
have reduced the economy’s dependence on oil. The amount of oil used to produce 
a unit of real GDP has declined by more than 50 percent since the OPEC shocks 
of the 1970s. As a result, the economic impact of any change in oil prices on the  
U.S. economy is much smaller today than it was in the past. (Of course, some na-
tions rely on oil exports as a major source of their income, and this makes oil prices 
crucial for them, but that is another story.) ●

Suppose that the election of a popular presidential candidate suddenly 
increases people’s confidence in the future. Use the model of aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply to analyze the effect on the economy.
33-6 Conclusion
This chapter has achieved two goals. First, we have discussed some of the 
important facts about short-run fluctuations in economic activity. Second, we 
have introduced a basic model to explain those fluctuations, called the model of 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply. We continue our study of this model 
in the next chapter to understand more fully what causes fluctuations in the 
economy and how policymakers might respond to these fluctuations.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
• All societies experience short-run economic fluc-
tuations around long-run trends. These fluctuations are 
irregular and largely unpredictable. When recessions 
occur, real GDP and other measures of income, 
spending, and production fall, while unemployment 
rises.
• Classical economic theory is based on the assumption 
that nominal variables such as the money supply and 
the price level do not influence real variables such as 
output and employment. Most economists believe that 
this assumption is accurate in the long run but not in 
the short run. Economists analyze short-run economic 
fluctuations using the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply. According to this model, the output 
of goods and services and the overall level of prices 
adjust to balance aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply.
• The aggregate-demand curve slopes downward for 
three reasons. The first is the wealth effect: A lower 
price level raises the real value of households’ money 
holdings, which stimulates consumer spending. The 
second is the interest-rate effect: A lower price level 
reduces the quantity of money households demand; 
as households try to convert money into interest-
bearing assets, interest rates fall, which stimulates 
investment spending. The third is the exchange-rate 
effect: As a lower price level reduces interest rates, the 
dollar depreciates in the market for foreign-currency 
exchange, which stimulates net exports.
• Any event or policy that raises consumption, 
investment, government purchases, or net exports at 
a given price level increases aggregate demand. Any 
event or policy that reduces consumption, investment, 
government purchases, or net exports at a given price 
level decreases aggregate demand.
• The long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical. In the 
long run, the quantity of goods and services supplied 
depends on the economy’s labor, capital, natural 
resources, and technology but not on the overall level 
of prices. 
• Three theories have been proposed to explain the 
upward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. 
According to the sticky-wage theory, an unexpected fall 
in the price level temporarily raises real wages, which 
induces firms to reduce employment and production. 
According to the sticky-price theory, an unexpected 
fall in the price level leaves some firms with prices that 
are temporarily too high, which reduces their sales 
and causes them to cut back production. According 
to the misperceptions theory, an unexpected fall in the 
price level leads suppliers to mistakenly believe that 
their relative prices have fallen, which induces them 
to reduce production. All three theories imply that 
output deviates from its natural level when the actual 
price level deviates from the price level that people 
expected.
• Events that alter the economy’s ability to produce 
output, such as changes in labor, capital, natural 
resources, or technology, shift the short-run aggregate-
supply curve (and may shift the long-run aggregate-
supply curve as well). In addition, the position of the 
short-run aggregate-supply curve depends on the 
expected price level. 
• One possible cause of economic fluctuations is a shift 
in aggregate demand. When the aggregate-demand 
curve shifts to the left, for instance, output and 
prices fall in the short run. Over time, as a change in 
the expected price level causes wages, prices, and 
perceptions to adjust, the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve shifts to the right. This shift returns the economy 
to its natural level of output at a new, lower price level.
• A second possible cause of economic fluctuations 
is a shift in aggregate supply. When the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left, the effect 
is falling output and rising prices—a combination 
called stagflation. Over time, as wages, prices, and 
perceptions adjust, the short-run aggregate-supply 
curve shifts back to the right, returning the price level 
and output to their original levels.

CHAPTER 33   AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
1. Name two macroeconomic variables that decline 
when the economy goes into a recession. Name one 
macroeconomic variable that rises during a recession.
2. Draw a diagram with aggregate demand, short-run 
aggregate supply, and long-run aggregate supply. Be 
careful to label the axes correctly.
3. List and explain the three reasons the aggregate-
demand curve slopes downward.
4. Explain why the long-run aggregate-supply curve is 
vertical.
5. List and explain the three theories for why the short-
run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward.
6. What might shift the aggregate-demand curve to the 
left? Use the model of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply to trace through the short-run and long-run 
effects of such a shift on output and the price level. 
7. What might shift the aggregate-supply curve to 
the left? Use the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply to trace through the short-run and 
long-run effects of such a shift on output and the price 
level. 
1. Suppose the economy is in a long-run equilibrium.
a. Draw a diagram to illustrate the state of the 
economy. Be sure to show aggregate demand, 
short-run aggregate supply, and long-run 
aggregate supply.
b. Now suppose that a stock market crash causes 
aggregate demand to fall. Use your diagram 
to show what happens to output and the price 
level in the short run. What happens to the 
unemployment rate? 
c. Use the sticky-wage theory of aggregate supply 
to explain what will happen to output and the 
price level in the long run (assuming no change 
in policy). What role does the expected price level 
play in this adjustment? Be sure to illustrate your 
analysis in a graph.
2. Explain whether each of the following events will 
increase, decrease, or have no effect on long-run 
aggregate supply.
a. The United States experiences a wave of 
immigration.
b. Congress raises the minimum wage to $15 per hour.
c. Intel invents a new and more powerful computer 
chip.
d. A severe hurricane damages factories along the 
East Coast.
3. Suppose an economy is in long-run equilibrium.
a. Use the model of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply to illustrate the initial 
equilibrium (call it point A). Be sure to include 
both short-run and long-run aggregate supply.
b. The central bank raises the money supply by  
5 percent. Use your diagram to show what 
happens to output and the price level as the 
economy moves from the initial to the new short-
run equilibrium (call it point B).
c. Now show the new long-run equilibrium (call it 
point C). What causes the economy to move from 
point B to point C?
d. According to the sticky-wage theory of aggregate 
supply, how do nominal wages at point A 
compare to nominal wages at point B? How do 
nominal wages at point A compare to nominal 
wages at point C?
e. According to the sticky-wage theory of aggregate 
supply, how do real wages at point A compare to 
real wages at point B? How do real wages at point 
A compare to real wages at point C?
f. Judging by the impact of the money supply on 
nominal and real wages, is this analysis consistent 
with the proposition that money has real effects in 
the short run but is neutral in the long run? 
4. In 1939, with the U.S. economy not yet fully recovered 
from the Great Depression, President Roosevelt 
proclaimed that Thanksgiving would fall a week 
earlier than usual so that the shopping period before 
Christmas would be longer. Explain what President 
Roosevelt might have been trying to achieve, using the 
model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.
5. Explain why the following statements are false.
a. “The aggregate-demand curve slopes downward 
because it is the horizontal sum of the demand 
curves for individual goods.”
b. “The long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical 
because economic forces do not affect long-run 
aggregate supply.”
c. “If firms adjusted their prices every day, then 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve would be 
horizontal.”
d. “Whenever the economy enters a recession, its 
long-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left.”

6. For each of the three theories for the upward slope 
of the short-run aggregate-supply curve, carefully 
explain the following:
a. how the economy recovers from a recession and 
returns to its long-run equilibrium without any 
policy intervention
b. what determines the speed of that recovery
7. The economy begins in long-run equilibrium. Then 
one day, the president appoints a new chair of the 
Federal Reserve. This new chairman is well known for 
her view that inflation is not a major problem for an 
economy. 
a. How would this news affect the price level that 
people would expect to prevail?
b. How would this change in the expected price 
level affect the nominal wage that workers and 
firms agree to in their new labor contracts?
c. How would this change in the nominal wage 
affect the profitability of producing goods and 
services at any given price level?
d. How does this change in profitability affect the 
short-run aggregate-supply curve?
e. If aggregate demand is held constant, how does 
this shift in the aggregate-supply curve affect the 
price level and the quantity of output produced?
f. Do you think this Fed chairman was a good 
appointment?
8. Explain whether each of the following events shifts 
the short-run aggregate-supply curve, the aggregate-
demand curve, both, or neither. For each event that 
does shift a curve, draw a diagram to illustrate the 
effect on the economy.
a. Households decide to save a larger share of their 
income.
b. Florida orange groves suffer a prolonged period 
of below-freezing temperatures.
c. Increased job opportunities overseas cause many 
people to leave the country.
9. For each of the following events, explain the short-run 
and long-run effects on output and the price level, 
assuming policymakers take no action.
a. The stock market declines sharply, reducing 
consumers’ wealth.
b. The federal government increases spending on 
national defense.
c. A technological improvement raises productivity.
d. A recession overseas causes foreigners to buy 
fewer U.S. goods.

diagram to show the short-run effect of this 
optimism on the economy. Label the new levels of 
prices and real output. Explain in words why the 
aggregate quantity of output supplied changes.
b. Now use the diagram from part (a) to show the 
new long-run equilibrium of the economy. (For 
now, assume there is no change in the long-
run aggregate-supply curve.) Explain in words 
why the aggregate quantity of output demanded 
changes between the short run and the long run.

I
magine that you are a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the 
group at the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy. You observe that the 
president and Congress have agreed to raise taxes. How should the Fed re-
spond to this change in fiscal policy? Should it expand the money supply, contract 
the money supply, or leave it unchanged?
To answer this question, you need to consider the impact of monetary and 
fiscal policy on the economy. In the preceding chapter, we used the model

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
fluctuations. We saw that shifts in the aggregate-demand curve or the aggregate- 
supply curve cause fluctuations in the economy’s overall output of goods and 
services and its overall level of prices. As we noted in the previous chapter, both 
monetary and fiscal policy influence aggregate demand. Thus, a change in one 
of these policies can lead to short-run fluctuations in output and prices. Policy-
makers will want to anticipate this effect and, perhaps, adjust the other policy 
in response.
In this chapter, we examine in more detail how the government’s policy tools 
influence the position of the aggregate-demand curve. These tools include mon-
etary policy (the supply of money set by the central bank) and fiscal policy (the 
levels of government spending and taxation set by the president and Congress). 
We have previously discussed the long-run effects of these policies. In Chapters 25 
and 26, we saw how fiscal policy affects saving, investment, and long-run 
 economic growth. In Chapters 29 and 30, we saw how monetary policy influences 
the price level in the long run. We now look at how these policy tools can shift 
the  aggregate-demand curve and thereby affect macroeconomic variables in the 
short run.
As we have already learned, many factors influence aggregate demand be-
sides monetary and fiscal policy. In particular, desired spending by households 
and firms determines the overall demand for goods and services. When desired 
spending changes, aggregate demand shifts. If policymakers do not respond, 
such shifts in aggregate demand cause short-run fluctuations in output and 
 employment. As a result, monetary and fiscal policymakers sometimes use the 
policy  levers at their disposal to try to offset these shifts in aggregate demand and 
 stabilize the economy. Here we discuss the theory behind these policy actions and 
some of the difficulties that arise in using this theory in practice.
34-1  How Monetary Policy Influences Aggregate Demand
The aggregate-demand curve shows the total quantity of goods and services 
demanded in the economy for any price level. The preceding chapter discussed 
three reasons why the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward: 
• The wealth effect: A lower price level raises the real value of households’ 
money holdings, which are part of their wealth. Higher real wealth stimu-
lates consumer spending and thus increases the quantity of goods and ser-
vices demanded.
• The interest-rate effect: A lower price level reduces the amount of money peo-
ple want to hold. As people try to lend out their excess money holdings, the 
interest rate falls. The lower interest rate stimulates investment spending and 
thus increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. 
• The exchange-rate effect: When a lower price level reduces the interest rate, inves-
tors move some of their funds overseas in search of higher returns. This move-
ment of funds causes the real value of the domestic currency to fall in the market 
for foreign-currency exchange. Domestic goods become less expensive relative to 
foreign goods. This change in the real exchange rate stimulates spending on net 
exports and thus increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.
These three effects occur simultaneously to increase the quantity of goods and 
services demanded when the price level falls and to decrease it when the price 
level rises.

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
Although all three effects work together to explain the downward slope of the 
aggregate-demand curve, they are not of equal importance. Because money hold-
ings are a small part of household wealth, the wealth effect is the least important 
of the three. In addition, because exports and imports represent only a small frac-
tion of U.S. GDP, the exchange-rate effect is not large for the U.S. economy. (This 
effect is more important for smaller countries, which typically export and import 
a higher fraction of their GDP.) For the U.S. economy, the most important reason for 
the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve is the interest-rate effect. 
To better understand aggregate demand, we now examine the short-run deter-
mination of interest rates in more detail. Here we develop the theory of liquidity 
preference. This theory of interest rates helps explain the downward slope of the 
aggregate-demand curve, as well as how monetary and fiscal policy can shift this 
curve. By shedding new light on aggregate demand, the theory of liquidity pref-
erence expands our understanding of what causes short-run economic fluctua-
tions and what policymakers can potentially do about them.
34-1a The Theory of Liquidity Preference
In his classic book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John May-
nard Keynes proposed the theory of liquidity preference to explain the factors that 
determine an economy’s interest rate. The theory is, in essence, an  application of 
supply and demand. According to Keynes, the interest rate adjusts to balance the 
supply of and demand for money.
You may recall that economists distinguish between two interest rates: The nom-
inal interest rate is the interest rate as usually reported, and the real interest rate is 
the interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation. When there is no inflation, the 
two rates are the same. But when borrowers and lenders expect prices to rise over 
the course of the loan, they agree to a nominal interest rate that exceeds the real 
interest rate by the expected rate of inflation. The higher nominal interest rate com-
pensates for the fact that they expect the loan to be repaid in less valuable dollars.
Which interest rate are we now trying to explain with the theory of liquidity pref-
erence? The answer is both. In the analysis that follows, we hold constant the ex-
pected rate of inflation. This assumption is reasonable for studying the economy 
in the short run, because expected inflation is typically stable over short periods of 
time. In this case, nominal and real interest rates differ by a constant. When the nom-
inal interest rate rises or falls, the real interest rate that people expect to earn rises or 
falls by a similar amount. For the rest of this chapter, when we discuss changes in 
the interest rate, these changes refer to both the real and nominal interest rates.
Let’s now develop the theory of liquidity preference by considering the supply 
and demand for money and how each depends on the interest rate. 
Money Supply  The first piece of the theory of liquidity preference is the supply of 
money. As we first discussed in Chapter 29, the money supply in the U.S. economy 
is controlled by the Federal Reserve. The Fed alters the money supply primarily by 
changing the quantity of reserves in the banking system through the purchase and 
sale of government bonds in open-market operations. When the Fed buys govern-
ment bonds, the dollars it pays for the bonds are typically deposited in banks, and 
these dollars are added to bank reserves. When the Fed sells government bonds, 
the dollars it receives for the bonds are withdrawn from the banking system, and 
bank reserves fall. These changes in bank reserves, in turn, lead to changes in 
banks’ ability to make loans and create money. Thus, by buying and selling bonds 
in open-market operations, the Fed alters the supply of money in the economy.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
In addition to open-market operations, the Fed can influence the money supply 
using a variety of other tools. One option is for the Fed to change how much it 
lends to banks. For example, a decrease in the discount rate (the interest rate at 
which banks can borrow reserves from the Fed) encourages more bank borrow-
ing, which increases bank reserves and thereby the money supply. Conversely, an 
increase in the discount rate discourages bank borrowing, which decreases bank 
reserves and the money supply. The Fed also alters the money supply by changing 
reserve requirements (the amount of reserves banks must hold against deposits) 
and by changing the interest rate it pays banks on the reserves they are holding.
These details of monetary control are important for the implementation of Fed 
policy, but they are not crucial for the analysis in this chapter. Our goal here is 
to examine how changes in the money supply affect the aggregate demand for 
goods and services. For this purpose, we can ignore the details of how Fed policy 
is implemented and assume that the Fed controls the money supply directly. In 
other words, the quantity of money supplied in the economy is fixed at whatever 
level the Fed decides to set it. 
Because the quantity of money supplied is fixed by Fed policy, it does not de-
pend on other economic variables. In particular, it does not depend on the interest 
rate. Once the Fed has made its policy decision, the quantity of money supplied 
is the same, regardless of the prevailing interest rate. We represent a fixed money 
supply with a vertical supply curve, as in Figure 1.

According to the theory of liquidity preference, the interest rate adjusts to bring the quan-
tity of money supplied and the quantity of money demanded into balance. If the interest 
rate is above the equilibrium level (such as at r1), the quantity of money people want to 
hold (Md
1) is less than the quantity the Fed has created, and this surplus of money puts 
downward pressure on the interest rate. Conversely, if the interest rate is below the equi-
librium level (such as at r2), the quantity of money people want to hold (Md
2) is greater 
than the quantity the Fed has created, and this shortage of money puts upward pressure 
on the interest rate. Thus, the forces of supply and demand in the market for money push 
the interest rate toward the equilibrium interest rate, at which people are content holding 
the quantity of money the Fed has created.

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
Money Demand  The second piece of the theory of liquidity preference is the 
demand for money. As a starting point for understanding money demand, recall 
that an asset’s liquidity refers to the ease with which that asset can be converted 
into the economy’s medium of exchange. Because money is the economy’s me-
dium of exchange, it is by definition the most liquid asset available. The liquidity 
of money explains the demand for it: People choose to hold money instead of 
other assets that offer higher rates of return because money can be used to buy 
goods and services.
Although many factors determine the quantity of money demanded, the one 
emphasized by the theory of liquidity preference is the interest rate. The reason is 
that the interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money. That is, when you 
hold wealth as cash in your wallet, instead of as an interest-bearing bond, you 
lose the interest you could have earned. An increase in the interest rate raises the 
cost of holding money and, as a result, reduces the quantity of money demanded. 
A decrease in the interest rate reduces the cost of holding money and raises the 
quantity demanded. Thus, as shown in Figure 1, the money demand curve slopes 
downward.
Equilibrium in the Money Market  According to the theory of liquidity prefer-
ence, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money. There 
is one interest rate, called the equilibrium interest rate, at which the quantity of 
money demanded exactly balances the quantity of money supplied. If the interest 
rate is at any other level, people will try to adjust their portfolios of assets and, as 
a result, drive the interest rate toward the equilibrium.
For example, suppose that the interest rate is above the equilibrium level, 
such as r1 in Figure 1. In this case, the quantity of money that people want to 
hold, Md
1, is less than the quantity of money that the Fed has supplied. Those 
people who are holding the surplus of money will try to get rid of it by buying 
interest- bearing bonds or by depositing it in interest-bearing bank accounts. Be-
cause bond issuers and banks prefer to pay lower interest rates, they respond to 
this surplus of money by lowering the interest rates they offer. As the interest 
rate falls, people become more willing to hold money until, at the equilibrium 
interest rate, people are happy to hold exactly the amount of money the Fed has 
supplied.
Conversely, at interest rates below the equilibrium level, such as r2 in Figure 1, 
the quantity of money that people want to hold, Md
2, is greater than the quantity of 
money that the Fed has supplied. As a result, people try to increase their holdings 
of money by reducing their holdings of bonds and other interest-bearing assets. 
As people cut back on their holdings of bonds, bond issuers find that they have 
to offer higher interest rates to attract buyers. Thus, the interest rate rises until it 
reaches the equilibrium level.
34-1b The Downward Slope of the Aggregate-Demand Curve
Having seen how the theory of liquidity preference explains the economy’s equi-
librium interest rate, we now consider the theory’s implications for the aggre-
gate demand for goods and services. As a warm-up exercise, let’s begin by using 
the theory to reexamine a topic we already understand—the interest-rate effect 
and  the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve. In particular, suppose 
that the overall level of prices in the economy rises. What happens to the interest 
rate that balances the supply and demand for money, and how does that change 
affect the quantity of goods and services demanded?

742
PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
As we discussed in Chapter 30, the price level is one determinant of the quan-
tity of money demanded. At higher prices, more money is exchanged every time 
a good or service is sold. As a result, people will choose to hold a larger quantity 
of money. That is, a higher price level increases the quantity of money demanded 
for any given interest rate. Thus, an increase in the price level from P1 to P2 shifts 
the money demand curve to the right from MD1 to MD2, as shown in panel (a) of 
Figure 2.
Notice how this shift in money demand affects the equilibrium in the money 
market. For a fixed money supply, the interest rate must rise to balance money 
supply and money demand. Because the higher price level has increased the 
amount of money people want to hold, it has shifted the money demand curve 
to the right. Yet the quantity of money supplied is unchanged, so the interest rate 
must rise from r1 to r2 to discourage the additional demand. 
This increase in the interest rate has ramifications not only for the money market 
but also for the quantity of goods and services demanded, as shown in panel (b). At 
Interest Rates in the Long Run and the Short Run
I
n an earlier chapter, we said that the interest rate adjusts to balance the 
supply of loanable funds (national saving) and the demand for loanable 
funds (desired investment). Here we just said that the interest rate adjusts 
to balance the supply of and demand for money. Can we reconcile these 
two theories? 
To answer this question, we need to focus on three macroeconomic 
variables: the economy’s output of goods and services, the interest rate, 
and the price level. According to the classical macroeconomic theory we 
developed earlier in the book, these variables are determined as follows:
  1.  Output is determined by the supplies of capital and labor and the 
available production technology for turning capital and labor into 
output. (We call this the natural level of output.)
  2.  For any given level of output, the interest rate adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for loanable funds. 
  3.  Given output and the interest rate, the price level adjusts to balance the 
supply and demand for money. Changes in the supply of money lead to 
proportionate changes in the price level.
These are three of the essential propositions of classical economic theory. 
Most economists believe that these propositions do a good job of describ-
ing how the economy works in the long run.
Yet these propositions do not hold in the short run. As we discussed in the 
preceding chapter, many prices are slow to adjust to changes in the money 
supply; this fact is reflected in a short-run aggregate-supply curve that is 
upward-sloping rather than vertical. As a result, in the short run, the overall 
price level cannot, by itself, move to balance the supply of and demand for 
money. This stickiness of the price level requires the interest rate to move to 
bring the money market into equilibrium. These changes in the interest rate, 
in turn, affect the aggre-
gate demand for goods 
and services. As aggre-
gate demand fluctuates, 
the economy’s output 
of goods and services 
moves away from the level determined by factor supplies and technology. 
To think about the operation of the economy in the short run (day to 
day, week to week, month to month, or quarter to quarter), it is best to keep 
in mind the following logic:
  1.  The price level is stuck at some level (based on previously formed 
expectations) and, in the short run, is relatively unresponsive to 
changing economic conditions.
  2.  For any given (stuck) price level, the interest rate adjusts to balance 
the supply of and demand for money.
  3.  The interest rate that balances the money market influences the 
quantity of goods and services demanded and thus the level of 
output. 
Notice that this precisely reverses the order of analysis used to study the 
economy in the long run.
The two different theories of the interest rate are useful for different 
purposes. When thinking about the long-run determinants of the interest 
rate, it is best to keep in mind the loanable-funds theory, which high-
lights the importance of an economy’s saving propensities and investment 
 opportunities. By contrast, when thinking about the short-run determi-
nants of the interest rate, it is best to keep in mind the liquidity-preference 
theory, which highlights the importance of monetary policy. ■

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
a higher interest rate, the cost of borrowing and the return to saving are greater. 
Fewer households choose to borrow to buy a new house, and those who do buy 
smaller houses, so the demand for residential investment falls. Fewer firms choose 
to borrow to build new factories and buy new equipment, so business investment 
falls. Thus, when the price level rises from P1 to P2, increasing money demand 
from MD1 to MD2 and raising the interest rate from r1 to r2, the quantity of goods 
and services demanded falls from Y1 to Y2. 
This analysis of the interest-rate effect can be summarized in three steps: 
(1) A higher price level raises money demand. (2) Higher money demand leads 
to a higher interest rate. (3) A higher interest rate reduces the quantity of goods 
and services demanded. The same logic works for a decline in the price level: A 
lower price level reduces money demand, which leads to a lower interest rate, 
and this in turn increases the quantity of goods and services demanded. The 
result of this analysis is a negative relationship between the price level and the 
quantity of goods and services demanded, as illustrated by a downward-sloping 
 aggregate-demand curve.
34-1c Changes in the Money Supply
So far, we have used the theory of liquidity preference to explain more fully 
how the total quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy changes 
as the price level changes. That is, we have examined movements along a 
downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve. The theory also sheds light, how-
ever, on some of the other events that alter the quantity of goods and services 
demanded. Whenever the quantity of goods and services demanded changes for 
any given price level, the aggregate-demand curve shifts.

 Because the interest rate is the cost of borrowing, the increase in the interest rate reduces 
the quantity of goods and services demanded from Y1 to Y2. This negative relationship 
 between the price level and quantity demanded is represented with a downward-sloping 
 aggregate-demand curve, as in panel (b).

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
One important variable that shifts the aggregate-demand curve is monetary 
policy. To see how monetary policy affects the economy in the short run, sup-
pose that the Fed increases the money supply by buying government bonds in 
open-market operations. (Why the Fed might do this will become clear later, after 
we understand the effects of such a move.) Let’s consider how this monetary in-
jection influences the equilibrium interest rate for a given price level. This will tell 
us what the injection does to the position of the aggregate-demand curve.
As panel (a) of Figure 3 shows, an increase in the money supply shifts the 
money supply curve to the right from MS1 to MS2. Because the money demand 
curve has not changed, the interest rate falls from r1 to r2 to balance money supply 
and money demand. That is, the interest rate must fall to induce people to hold the 
additional money the Fed has created, restoring equilibrium in the money market. 
Once again, the interest rate influences the quantity of goods and services de-
manded, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 3. The lower interest rate reduces the cost 
of borrowing and the return to saving. Households spend more on new homes, 
stimulating the demand for residential investment. Firms spend more on new 
factories and new equipment, stimulating business investment. As a result, the 
quantity of goods and services demanded at a given price level, P, rises from Y1
to Y2. Of course, there is nothing special about P: The monetary injection raises 
the quantity of goods and services demanded at every price level. Thus, the entire 
aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
To sum up: When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and 
increases the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting 
the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, when the Fed contracts the money 
supply, it raises the interest rate and reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded 
for any given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
34-1d The Role of Interest-Rate Targets in Fed Policy
How does the Federal Reserve affect the economy? Our discussion here and ear-
lier in the book has treated the money supply as the Fed’s policy instrument. 
When the Fed buys government bonds in open-market operations, it increases the 
money supply and expands aggregate demand. When the Fed sells government 
bonds in open-market operations, it decreases the money supply and contracts 
aggregate demand.
Discussions of Fed policy often treat the interest rate, rather than the money 
supply, as the Fed’s policy instrument. Indeed, in recent years, the Federal Reserve 
has conducted policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate—the interest rate 
that banks charge one another for short-term loans. This target is reevaluated ev-
ery six weeks at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The 
FOMC has chosen to set a target for the federal funds rate, rather than for the 
money supply, as it did at times in the past.
There are several related reasons for the Fed’s decision to use the federal funds 
rate as its target. One is that the money supply is hard to measure with sufficient 
precision. Another is that money demand fluctuates over time. For any given 
money supply, fluctuations in money demand would lead to fluctuations in inter-
est rates, aggregate demand, and output. By contrast, when the Fed announces a 
target for the federal funds rate, it essentially accommodates the day-to-day shifts 
in money demand by adjusting the money supply accordingly.
The Fed’s decision to target an interest rate does not fundamentally alter our anal-
ysis of monetary policy. The theory of liquidity preference illustrates an important 
principle: Monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money supply or in terms 
of the interest rate. When the FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate of, say, 6 
percent, the Fed’s bond traders are told: “Conduct whatever open-market opera-
tions are necessary to ensure that the equilibrium interest rate is 6 percent.” In other 
words, when the Fed sets a target for the interest rate, it commits itself to adjusting 
the money supply to make the equilibrium in the money market hit that target.
As a result, changes in monetary policy can be viewed either in terms of changing 
the interest rate target or in terms of changing the money supply. When you read in 
the newspaper that “the Fed has lowered the federal funds rate from 6 to 5 percent,” 
you should understand that this occurs only because the Fed’s bond traders are do-
ing what it takes to make it happen. To lower the federal funds rate, the Fed’s bond 
traders buy government bonds, and this purchase increases the money supply and 
lowers the equilibrium interest rate (just as in Figure 3). Similarly, when the FOMC 
raises the target for the federal funds rate, the bond traders sell government bonds, 
and this sale decreases the money supply and raises the equilibrium interest rate. 
The lessons from this analysis are simple: Changes in monetary policy aimed at 
expanding aggregate demand can be described either as increasing the money supply or as 
lowering the interest rate. Changes in monetary policy aimed at contracting aggregate de-
mand can be described either as decreasing the money supply or as raising the interest rate.
CASE 
STUDY
WHY THE FED WATCHES THE STOCK MARKET (AND VICE VERSA)
“The stock market has predicted nine out of the past five recessions.” 
So quipped Paul Samuelson, the famed economist (and textbook au-
thor). Samuelson was right that the stock market is highly volatile and 
can give wrong signals about the economy. But fluctuations in stock prices are 
often a sign of broader economic developments. The economic boom of the 1990s, 
for example, appeared not only in rapid GDP growth and falling unemployment 
but also in rising stock prices, which increased about fourfold during this decade.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Similarly, the deep recession of 2008 and 2009 was reflected in falling stock prices: 
From November 2007 to March 2009, the stock market lost about half its value.
How should the Fed respond to stock market fluctuations? The Fed has no rea-
son to care about stock prices in themselves, but it does have the job of monitoring 
and responding to developments in the overall economy, and the stock market is a 
piece of that puzzle. When the stock market booms, households become wealthier, 
and this increased wealth stimulates consumer spending. In addition, a rise in stock 
prices makes it more attractive for firms to sell new shares of stock, and this stimu-
lates investment spending. For both reasons, a booming stock market expands the 
aggregate demand for goods and services.
As we discuss more fully later in the chapter, one of the Fed’s goals is to stabilize 
aggregate demand, because greater stability in aggregate demand means greater 
stability in output and the price level. To promote stability, the Fed might respond 
to a stock market boom by keeping the money supply lower and interest rates 
higher than it otherwise would. The contractionary effects of higher interest rates 
would offset the expansionary effects of higher stock prices. In fact, this analysis 
does describe Fed behavior: Real interest rates were kept high by historical stan-
dards during the stock market boom of the late 1990s.
The opposite occurs when the stock market falls. Spending on consumption and 
investment tends to decline, depressing aggregate demand and pushing the econ-
omy toward recession. To stabilize aggregate demand, the Fed would increase the 
money supply and lower interest rates. And indeed, that is what it typically does. 
For example, on October 19, 1987, the stock market fell by 22.6 percent—one of 
the biggest one-day drops in history. The Fed responded to the market crash by 
increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. The federal funds rate 
fell from 7.7 percent at the beginning of October to 6.6 percent at the end of the 
month. In part because of the Fed’s quick action, the economy avoided a recession. 
Similarly, as we discussed in a case study in the preceding chapter, the Fed also 
reduced interest rates during the economic downturn and stock market decline 
of 2008 and 2009, but this time monetary policy was not sufficient to avert a deep 
recession.
While the Fed keeps an eye on the stock market, stock market participants also 
keep an eye on the Fed. Because the Fed can influence interest rates and economic 
activity, it can alter the value of stocks. For example, when the Fed raises interest 
rates by reducing the money supply, it makes owning stocks less attractive for two 
reasons. First, a higher interest rate means that bonds, the alternative to stocks, are 
earning a higher return. Second, the Fed’s tightening of monetary policy reduces 
the demand for goods and services, which reduces profits. As a result, stock prices 
often fall when the Fed raises interest rates. ●
QuickQuiz
Use the theory of liquidity preference to explain how a decrease in the 
money supply affects the equilibrium interest rate. How does this change 
in monetary policy affect the aggregate-demand curve?
34-1e The Zero Lower Bound
As we have just seen, monetary policy works through interest rates. This con-
clusion raises a question: What if the Fed’s target interest rate has fallen as far 
as it can? In the recession of 2008 and 2009, the federal funds rate fell to about 
zero. In this situation, what, if anything, can monetary policy do to stimulate the 
economy?

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
Some economists describe this situation as a liquidity trap. According to the the-
ory of liquidity preference, expansionary monetary policy works by reducing inter-
est rates and stimulating investment spending. But if interest rates have already 
fallen to around zero, monetary policy may no longer be effective. Nominal in-
terest rates cannot fall much below zero: Rather than making a loan at a negative 
nominal interest rate, a person would just hold cash. In this environment, expan-
sionary monetary policy raises the supply of money, making the public’s asset 
portfolio more liquid, but because interest rates can’t fall any further, the extra 
liquidity might not have any effect. Aggregate demand, production, and employ-
ment may be “trapped” at low levels.
Other economists are skeptical about the relevance of liquidity traps and be-
lieve that a central bank continues to have tools to expand the economy, even after 
its interest rate target hits its lower bound of zero. One possibility is that the cen-
tral bank could commit itself to keeping interest rates low for an extended period 
of time. Such a policy is sometimes called forward guidance. Even if the central 
bank’s current target for the interest rate cannot fall any further, the promise that 
interest rates will remain low may help stimulate investment spending. 
A second possibility is that the central bank could conduct expansionary 
open-market operations with a larger variety of financial instruments.  Normally, 
the Fed conducts expansionary open-market operations by buying  short-term 
government bonds. But it could also buy mortgages, corporate debt, and 
 longer-term government bonds and thereby lower the interest rates on these kinds 
of loans. The Federal Reserve actively pursued this last option in the aftermath of 
the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. This type of unconventional  monetary policy 
is sometimes called quantitative easing because it increases the quantity of bank 
reserves.
Some economists have suggested that the possibility of hitting the zero lower 
bound for interest rates justifies setting the target rate of inflation well above 
zero. Under zero inflation, the real interest rate, like the nominal interest, can 
never fall below zero. But if the normal rate of inflation is, say, 4 percent, then 
the central bank can easily push the real interest rate to negative 4 percent by 
lowering the nominal interest rate toward zero. Thus, moderate inflation gives 
monetary policymakers more room to stimulate the economy when needed, re-
ducing the risk of hitting the zero lower bound and having the economy fall into 
a liquidity trap.
34-2  How Fiscal Policy Influences Aggregate Demand
The government can influence the behavior of the economy not only with mon-
etary policy but also with fiscal policy. Fiscal policy refers to the government’s 
choices regarding the overall level of government purchases and taxes. Earlier 
in the book, we examined how fiscal policy influences saving, investment, and 
growth in the long run. In the short run, however, the primary effect of fiscal pol-
icy is on the aggregate demand for goods and services.
34-2a Changes in Government Purchases
When policymakers change the money supply or the level of taxes, they shift 
the aggregate-demand curve indirectly by influencing the spending decisions of 
firms or households. By contrast, when the government alters its own purchases 
of goods and services, it shifts the aggregate-demand curve directly.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Suppose, for instance, that the U.S. Department of Defense places a $20 billion 
order for new fighter planes with Boeing, the large aircraft manufacturer. This 
order raises the demand for the output produced by Boeing, which induces the 
company to hire more workers and increase production. Because Boeing is part 
of the economy, the increase in the demand for Boeing planes means an increase 
in the total quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level. As a 
 result, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.
By how much does this $20 billion order from the government shift the 
 aggregate-demand curve? At first, one might guess that the aggregate-demand 
curve shifts to the right by exactly $20 billion. It turns out, however, that this is not 
the case. There are two macroeconomic effects that cause the size of the shift in 
aggregate demand to differ from the change in government purchases. The first—
the multiplier effect—suggests the shift in aggregate demand could be larger than 
$20 billion. The second—the crowding-out effect—suggests the shift in aggregate 
demand could be smaller than $20 billion. We now discuss these two effects in turn. 
34-2b The Multiplier Effect
When the government buys $20 billion of goods from Boeing, that purchase has 
repercussions. The immediate impact of the higher demand from the government 
is to raise employment and profits at Boeing. Then, as the workers see higher 
earnings and the firm owners see higher profits, they respond to this increase in 
income by raising their own spending on consumer goods. As a result, the gov-
ernment purchase from Boeing raises the demand for the products of many other 
firms in the economy. Because each dollar spent by the government can raise the 
aggregate demand for goods and services by more than a dollar, government 
 purchases are said to have a multiplier effect on aggregate demand.
This multiplier effect continues even after this first round. When consumer 
spending rises, the firms that produce these consumer goods hire more people and 
experience higher profits. Higher earnings and profits stimulate consumer spend-
ing once again and so on. Thus, there is positive feedback as higher demand leads to 
higher income, which in turn leads to even higher demand. Once all these effects are 
added together, the total impact on the quantity of goods and services demanded 
can be much larger than the initial impulse from higher government spending. 
Figure 4 illustrates the multiplier effect. The increase in government purchases 
of $20 billion initially shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right from AD1
to AD2 by exactly $20 billion. But when consumers respond by increasing their 
spending, the aggregate-demand curve shifts still further to AD3.
This multiplier effect arising from the response of consumer spending can be 
strengthened by the response of investment to higher levels of demand. For in-
stance, Boeing might respond to the higher demand for planes by deciding to buy 
more equipment or build another plant. In this case, higher government demand 
spurs higher demand for investment goods. This positive feedback from demand 
to investment is sometimes called the investment accelerator.
34-2c A Formula for the Spending Multiplier
Some simple algebra permits us to derive a formula for the size of the multiplier 
effect that arises when an increase in government purchases induces increases in 
consumer spending. An important number in this formula is the marginal propen-
sity to consume (MPC)—the fraction of extra income that a household consumes 
rather than saves. For example, suppose that the marginal propensity to consume 
is ¾. This means that for every extra dollar that a household earns, the household

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
spends $0.75 (¾ of the dollar) and saves $0.25. With an MPC of ¾, when the work-
ers and owners of Boeing earn $20 billion from the government contract, they in-
crease their consumer spending by ¾ × $20 billion, or $15 billion.
To gauge the impact on aggregate demand of a change in government pur-
chases, we follow the effects step-by-step. The process begins when the govern-
ment spends $20 billion, which implies that national income (earnings and profits) 
also rises by this amount. This increase in income in turn raises consumer spend-
ing by MPC × $20 billion, which raises the income for the workers and owners of 
the firms that produce the consumption goods. This second increase in income 
again raises consumer spending, this time by MPC × (MPC × $20 billion). These 
feedback effects go on and on. 
To find the total impact on the demand for goods and services, we add up all 
these effects:
Change in government purchases = 
   $20 billion
First change in consumption 
= MPC   × $20 billion
Second change in consumption 
= MPC2 × $20 billion
Third change in consumption 
= MPC3 × $20 billion

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
This multiplier tells us the demand for goods and services that each dollar of gov-
ernment purchases generates.
To simplify this equation for the multiplier, recall from math class that this ex-
pression is an infinite geometric series. For x between −1 and +1,
1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . = 1 / (1 − x).
In our case, x = MPC. Thus, 
Multiplier = 1/(1 − MPC).
For example, if MPC is ¾, the multiplier is 1/(1 − ¾), which is 4. In this case, the 
$20 billion of government spending generates $80 billion of demand for goods 
and services.
This formula for the multiplier shows that the size of the multiplier depends on 
the marginal propensity to consume. While an MPC of ¾ leads to a multiplier of 
4, an MPC of ½ leads to a multiplier of only 2. Thus, a larger MPC means a larger 
multiplier. To see why this is true, remember that the multiplier arises because 
higher income induces greater spending on consumption. With a larger MPC, 
consumption responds more to a change in income, and so the multiplier is larger.
34-2d Other Applications of the Multiplier Effect
Because of the multiplier effect, a dollar of government purchases can generate 
more than a dollar of aggregate demand. The logic of the multiplier effect, how-
ever, is not restricted to changes in government purchases. Instead, it applies to 
any event that alters spending on any component of GDP—consumption, invest-
ment, government purchases, or net exports.
For example, suppose that a recession overseas reduces the demand for U.S. 
net exports by $10 billion. This reduced spending on U.S. goods and services de-
presses U.S. national income, which reduces spending by U.S. consumers. If the 
marginal propensity to consume is ¾ and the multiplier is 4, then the $10 billion 
fall in net exports leads to a $40 billion contraction in aggregate demand.
As another example, suppose that a stock market boom increases households’ 
wealth and stimulates their spending on goods and services by $20 billion. This 
extra consumer spending increases national income, which in turn generates even 
more consumer spending. If the marginal propensity to consume is ¾ and the 
multiplier is 4, then the initial impulse of $20 billion in consumer spending trans-
lates into an $80 billion increase in aggregate demand.
The multiplier is an important concept in macroeconomics because it shows 
how the economy can amplify the impact of changes in spending. A small initial 
change in consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports can 
end up having a large effect on aggregate demand and, therefore, the economy’s 
production of goods and services.
34-2e The Crowding-Out Effect
The multiplier effect seems to suggest that when the government buys $20 billion 
of planes from Boeing, the resulting expansion in aggregate demand is necessarily 
larger than $20 billion. Yet another effect works in the opposite direction. While 
an increase in government purchases stimulates the aggregate demand for goods 
and services, it also causes the interest rate to rise, which reduces investment 
spending and puts downward pressure on aggregate demand. The reduction in 

751
CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
aggregate demand that results when a fiscal expansion raises the interest rate is 
called the crowding-out effect.
To see why crowding out occurs, let’s consider what happens in the money 
market when the government buys planes from Boeing. As we have discussed, 
this increase in demand raises the incomes of the workers and owners of this firm 
(and, because of the multiplier effect, of other firms as well). As incomes rise, 
households plan to buy more goods and services and, as a result, choose to hold 
more of their wealth in liquid form. That is, the increase in income caused by the 
fiscal expansion raises the demand for money. 
The effect of the increase in money demand is shown in panel (a) of Figure 
5. Because the Fed has not changed the money supply, the vertical supply curve 
remains the same. When the higher level of income shifts the money demand 
curve to the right from MD1 to MD2, the interest rate must rise from r1 to r2 to keep 
supply and demand in balance.
The increase in the interest rate, in turn, reduces the quantity of goods and 
services demanded. In particular, because borrowing is more expensive, the de-
mand for residential and business investment goods declines. In other words, as 
the increase in government purchases increases the demand for goods and ser-
vices, it may also crowd out investment. This crowding-out effect partially off-
sets the impact of government purchases on aggregate demand, as illustrated in 
panel (b) of Figure 5. The increase in government purchases initially shifts the 
 aggregate-demand curve from AD1 to AD2, but once crowding out takes place, the 
aggregate-demand curve drops back to AD3.

causes the equilibrium interest rate to rise from r1 to r2. Panel (b) shows the effects on aggregate 
demand. The initial impact of the increase in government purchases shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve from AD1 to AD2. Yet because the interest rate is the cost of borrowing, the increase in the 
interest rate tends to reduce the quantity of goods and services demanded, particularly for invest-
ment goods. This crowding out of investment partially offsets the impact of the fiscal expansion on 
aggregate demand. In the end, the aggregate-demand curve shifts only to AD3.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
To sum up: When the government increases its purchases by $20 billion, the aggregate 
demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than $20 billion depending on the 
sizes of the multiplier and crowding-out effects. The multiplier effect makes the shift 
in aggregate demand greater than $20 billion. The crowding-out effect pushes the 
aggregate-demand curve in the opposite direction and, if large enough, could re-
sult in an aggregate-demand shift of less than $20 billion.
34-2f Changes in Taxes
The other important instrument of fiscal policy, besides the level of government 
purchases, is the level of taxation. When the government cuts personal income 
taxes, for instance, it increases households’ take-home pay. Households will 
save some of this additional income, but they will also spend some of it on con-
sumer goods. Because it increases consumer spending, the tax cut shifts the ag-
gregate-demand curve to the right. Similarly, a tax increase depresses consumer 
spending and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
The size of the shift in aggregate demand resulting from a tax change is also 
affected by the multiplier and crowding-out effects. When the government cuts 
taxes and stimulates consumer spending, earnings and profits rise, which further 
stimulates consumer spending. This is the multiplier effect. At the same time, 
higher income leads to higher money demand, which tends to raise interest rates. 
Higher interest rates make borrowing more costly, which reduces investment 
spending. This is the crowding-out effect. Depending on the sizes of the multi-
plier and crowding-out effects, the shift in aggregate demand could be larger or 
smaller than the tax change that causes it.
How Fiscal Policy Might Affect Aggregate Supply
S
o far, our discussion of fiscal policy has stressed how changes in gov-
ernment purchases and changes in taxes influence the quantity of 
goods and services demanded. Most economists believe that the short-
run macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy work primarily through aggre-
gate demand. Yet fiscal policy can potentially influence the quantity of 
goods and services supplied as well.
For instance, consider the effects of tax changes on aggregate sup-
ply. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that people 
respond to incentives. When government policymakers cut tax rates, 
workers get to keep more of each dollar they earn, so they have a greater 
incentive to work and produce goods and services. If they respond to this 
incentive, the quantity of goods and services supplied will be greater at 
each price level, and the aggregate-supply curve will shift to the right. 
Some economists, called supply siders, have argued that the influence 
of tax cuts on aggregate supply is large. According to some supply siders, 
the influence is so large that a cut in tax rates will stimulate enough addi-
tional production and income that tax revenue will actually increase. This 
is certainly a theoretical possibility, but most economists do not consider 
it the normal case. While the 
supply-side effects of taxes 
are important to consider, 
they are usually not large 
enough to cause tax revenue 
to rise when tax rates fall.
Like changes in taxes, changes 
in government purchases can also potentially affect aggregate supply. 
Suppose, for instance, that the government increases expenditure on a 
form of government-provided capital, such as roads. Roads are used by 
private businesses to make deliveries to their customers; an increase in 
the quantity of roads  increases these businesses’ productivity. Hence, 
when the government spends more on roads, it increases the quantity of 
goods and services supplied at any given price level and, thus, shifts the 
aggregate-supply curve to the right. This effect on aggregate supply is 
probably more important in the long run than in the short run, however, 
because it takes time for the government to build new roads and put 
them into use. ■

753
CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
In addition to the multiplier and crowding-out effects, there is another import-
ant determinant of the size of the shift in aggregate demand that results from a 
tax change: households’ perceptions about whether the tax change is permanent 
or temporary. For example, suppose that the government announces a tax cut of 
$1,000 per household. In deciding how much of this $1,000 to spend, households 
must ask themselves how long this extra income will last. If they expect the tax 
cut to be permanent, they will view it as adding substantially to their financial re-
sources and, therefore, increase their spending by a large amount. In this case, the 
tax cut will have a large impact on aggregate demand. By contrast, if households 
expect the tax change to be temporary, they will view it as adding only slightly to 
their financial resources and, therefore, will increase their spending by only a small 
amount. In this case, the tax cut will have a small impact on aggregate demand.
An extreme example of a temporary tax cut was the one announced in 1992. In 
that year, President George H. W. Bush faced a lingering recession and an upcom-
ing reelection campaign. He responded to these circumstances by announcing a 
reduction in the amount of income tax that the federal government was withhold-
ing from workers’ paychecks. Because legislated income tax rates did not change, 
however, every dollar of reduced withholding in 1992 meant an extra dollar of 
taxes due on April 15, 1993, when income tax returns for 1992 were to be filed. 
Thus, this “tax cut” actually represented only a short-term loan from the govern-
ment. Not surprisingly, the impact of the policy on consumer spending and ag-
gregate demand was relatively small.

34-3 Using Policy to Stabilize the Economy
We have seen how monetary and fiscal policy can affect the economy’s aggregate 
demand for goods and services. These theoretical insights raise some important 
policy questions: Should policymakers use these instruments to control aggregate 
demand and stabilize the economy? If so, when? If not, why not?
34-3a The Case for Active Stabilization Policy
Let’s return to the question that began this chapter: When the president and 
 Congress raise taxes, how should the Federal Reserve respond? As we have seen, 
the level of taxation is one determinant of the position of the aggregate-demand 
curve. When the government raises taxes, aggregate demand will fall, depress-
ing production and employment in the short run. If the Federal Reserve wants to 
prevent this adverse effect of the fiscal policy, it can expand aggregate demand by 
increasing the money supply. A monetary expansion would reduce interest rates, 
stimulate investment spending, and expand aggregate demand. If monetary pol-
icy is set appropriately, the combined changes in monetary and fiscal policy could 
leave the aggregate demand for goods and services unaffected.
This analysis is exactly the sort followed by members of the Federal Open 
 Market Committee. They know that monetary policy is an important determinant 
of aggregate demand. They also know that there are other important determinants 
as well, including fiscal policy set by the president and Congress. As a result, the 
FOMC watches the debates over fiscal policy with a keen eye.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
This response of monetary policy to the change in fiscal policy is an example of 
a more general phenomenon: the use of policy instruments to stabilize aggregate 
demand and, as a result, production and employment. Economic stabilization has 
been an explicit goal of U.S. policy since the Employment Act of 1946. This act 
states that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government 
to . . . promote full employment and production.” In essence, the government has 
chosen to hold itself accountable for short-run macroeconomic performance.
The Employment Act has two implications. The first, more modest, implication 
is that the government should avoid being a cause of economic fluctuations. Thus, 
most economists advise against large and sudden changes in monetary and fis-
cal policy, for such changes are likely to cause fluctuations in aggregate demand. 
Moreover, when large changes do occur, it is important that monetary and fiscal 
policymakers be aware of and respond to each others’ actions.
The second, more ambitious, implication of the Employment Act is that the 
government should respond to changes in the private economy to stabilize aggre-
gate demand. The act was passed not long after the publication of Keynes’s The 
General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, which has been one of the most 
influential books ever written about economics. In it, Keynes emphasized the key 
role of aggregate demand in explaining short-run economic fluctuations. Keynes 
In the global economic downturn of 
2008 and 2009, governments around 
the world turned to fiscal policy to 
prop up aggregate demand. This epi-
sode ignited a debate about the size of 
the multipliers, which remains a topic 
of much research.
Much Ado about Multipliers
I
t is the biggest peacetime fiscal expansion in 
history. Across the globe countries have coun-
tered the recession by cutting taxes and by 
boosting government spending. The G20 group 
of economies, whose leaders meet this week in 
Pittsburgh, have introduced stimulus packages 
worth an average of 2% of GDP this year [2009] 
and 1.6% of GDP in 2010. Coordinated action on 
this scale might suggest a consensus about the 
effects of fiscal stimulus. But economists are in 
fact deeply divided about how well, or indeed 
whether, such stimulus works. 
The debate hinges on the scale of the “fis-
cal multiplier.” This measure, first formalised 
in 1931 by Richard Kahn, a student of John 
Maynard Keynes, captures how effectively tax 
cuts or increases in government spending 
stimulate output. A multiplier of one means 
that a $1 billion increase in government 
spending will increase a country’s GDP by $1 
billion.
The size of the multiplier is bound to vary 
according to economic conditions. For an 
economy operating at full capacity, the fiscal 
multiplier should be zero. Since there are no 
spare resources, any increase in government 
demand would just replace spending else-
where. But in a recession, when workers and 
factories lie idle, a fiscal boost can increase 
overall demand. And if the initial stimulus 
triggers a cascade of expenditure among con-
sumers and businesses, the multiplier can be 
well above one. 
The multiplier is also likely to vary accord-
ing to the type of fiscal action. Government 
spending on building a bridge may have a 
bigger multiplier than a tax cut if consumers 
save a portion of their tax windfall. A tax cut 
targeted at poorer people may have a bigger 
impact on spending than one for the affluent, 
since poorer folk tend to spend a higher share 
of their income.
Crucially, the overall size of the fiscal 
multiplier also depends on how people react 
to higher government borrowing. If the gov-
ernment’s actions bolster confidence and re-
vive animal spirits, the multiplier could rise 
as demand goes up and private investment 
is “crowded in.” But if interest rates climb 
in response to government borrowing then 
some private investment that would otherwise 
have occurred could get “crowded out.” And if 
consumers expect higher future taxes in order 
to finance new government borrowing, they 
could spend less today. All that would reduce 
the fiscal multiplier, potentially to below zero.

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
claimed that the government should actively stimulate aggregate demand when 
aggregate demand appeared insufficient to maintain production at its full-em-
ployment level. 
Keynes (and his many followers) argued that aggregate demand fluctuates be-
cause of largely irrational waves of pessimism and optimism. He used the term “an-
imal spirits” to refer to these arbitrary changes in attitude. When pessimism reigns, 
households reduce consumption spending and firms reduce investment spending. 
The result is reduced aggregate demand, lower production, and higher unemploy-
ment. Conversely, when optimism reigns, households and firms  increase spending. 
The result is higher aggregate demand, higher production, and inflationary pres-
sure. Notice that these changes in attitude are, to some extent, self-fulfilling.
In principle, the government can adjust its monetary and fiscal policy in 
response to these waves of optimism and pessimism and, thereby, stabilize the 
economy. For example, when people are excessively pessimistic, the Fed can 
expand the money supply to lower interest rates and expand aggregate demand. 
When they are excessively optimistic, it can contract the money supply to raise 
interest rates and dampen aggregate demand. Former Fed Chairman William 
McChesney Martin described this view of monetary policy very simply: “The 
Federal  Reserve’s job is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.”
Different assumptions about the impact 
of higher government borrowing on interest 
rates and private spending explain wild vari-
ations in the estimates of multipliers from 
today’s stimulus spending. Economists in 
the Obama administration, who assume that 
the federal funds rate stays constant for a 
four-year period, expect a multiplier of 1.6 for 
government purchases and 1.0 for tax cuts 
from America’s fiscal stimulus. An alterna-
tive assessment by John Cogan, Tobias Cwik, 
John Taylor and Volker Wieland uses models 
in which interest rates and taxes rise more 
quickly in response to higher public borrow-
ing. Their multipliers are much smaller. They 
think America’s stimulus will boost GDP by 
only one-sixth as much as the Obama team 
expects. 
When forward-looking models disagree 
so dramatically, careful analysis of previous 
fiscal stimuli ought to help settle the debate. 
Unfortunately, it is extremely tricky to iso-
late the impact of changes in fiscal policy. 
One approach is to use microeconomic case 
studies to examine consumer behaviour in 
response to specific tax rebates and cuts. 
These studies, largely based on tax changes 
in America, find that permanent cuts have 
a bigger impact on consumer spending than 
temporary ones and that consumers who find 
it hard to borrow, such as those close to their 
credit-card limit, tend to spend more of their 
tax windfall. But case studies do not measure 
the overall impact of tax cuts or spending in-
creases on output. 
An alternative approach is to try to 
tease out the statistical impact of changes 
in government spending or tax cuts on GDP. 
The difficulty here is to isolate the effects 
of fiscal-stimulus measures from the rises 
in social-security spending and falls in tax 
revenues that naturally accompany reces-
sions. This empirical approach has narrowed 
the range of estimates in some areas. It has 
also yielded interesting cross-country com-
parisons. Multipliers are bigger in closed 
economies than open ones (because less of 
the stimulus leaks abroad via imports). They 
have traditionally been bigger in rich coun-
tries than emerging ones (where investors 
tend to take fright more quickly, pushing in-
terest rates up). But overall economists find 
as big a range of multipliers from empirical 
estimates as they do from theoretical models. 
To add to the confusion, the post-war ex-
periences from which statistical analyses are 
drawn differ in vital respects from the current 
situation. Most of the evidence on multipliers 
for government spending is based on military 
outlays, but today’s stimulus packages are 
heavily focused on infrastructure. Interest 
rates in many rich countries are now close to 
zero, which may increase the potency of, as 
well as the need for, fiscal stimulus. Because 
of the financial crisis relatively more people 
face borrowing constraints, which would in-
crease the effectiveness of a tax cut. At the 
same time, highly indebted consumers may 
now be keen to cut their borrowing, leading to 
a lower multiplier. And investors today have 
more reason to be worried about rich coun-
tries’ fiscal positions than those of emerging 
markets. 
Add all this together and the truth is that 
economists are flying blind. They can make 
relative judgments with some confidence. 
Temporary tax cuts pack less punch than per-
manent ones, for instance. Fiscal multipliers 
will probably be lower in heavily indebted 
economies than in prudent ones. But poli-
cymakers looking for precise estimates are 
 deluding themselves. ■

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
CASE 
STUDY
KEYNESIANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE
When a reporter in 1961 asked President John F. Kennedy why he ad-
vocated a tax cut, Kennedy replied, “To stimulate the economy. Don’t 
you remember your Economics 101?” Kennedy’s policy was, in fact, 
based on the analysis of fiscal policy we have developed in this chapter. His goal 
was to enact a tax cut, which would raise consumer spending, expand aggregate 
demand, and increase the economy’s production and employment.
In choosing this policy, Kennedy was relying on his team of economic advisers. 
This team included such prominent economists as James Tobin and Robert Solow, 
both of whom would later win Nobel Prizes for their contributions to the field. As 
students in the 1940s, these economists had closely studied John Maynard Keynes’s 
General Theory, which was then only a few years old. When the Kennedy advisers 
proposed cutting taxes, they were putting Keynes’s ideas into action.
Although tax changes can have a potent influence on ag-
gregate demand, they have other effects as well. In particular, 
by changing the incentives that people face, taxes can alter the 
aggregate supply of goods and services. Part of the Kennedy 
proposal was an investment tax credit, which gives a tax break 
to firms that invest in new capital. Higher investment would not 
only stimulate aggregate demand immediately but also increase 
the economy’s productive capacity over time. Thus, the short-
run goal of increasing production through higher aggregate 
demand was coupled with a long-run goal of increasing pro-
duction through higher aggregate supply. And indeed, when 
the tax cut Kennedy proposed was finally enacted in 1964, it 
helped usher in a period of robust economic growth.
Since the 1964 tax cut, policymakers have from time to time 
used fiscal policy as a tool for controlling aggregate demand. 
For example, when President Barack Obama moved into the 
Oval Office in 2009, he faced an economy in the midst of a reces-
sion. One of his first policy initiatives was a stimulus bill, called 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which 
included substantial increases in government spending. The In 
the News box on the preceding two pages discusses some of the 
debate over this policy initiative. ●
34-3b The Case against Active Stabilization Policy
Some economists argue that the government should avoid ac-
tive use of monetary and fiscal policy to try to stabilize the 
economy. They claim that these policy instruments should be 
set to achieve long-run goals, such as rapid economic growth 
and low inflation, and that the economy should be left to deal 
with short-run fluctuations on its own. These economists 
may admit that monetary and fiscal policy can stabilize the 
economy in theory, but they doubt whether it can do so in 
practice.
The primary argument against active monetary and fiscal 
policy is that these policies affect the economy with a long lag. 
As we have seen, monetary policy works by changing interest 
rates, which in turn influence investment spending. But many 
Economic Stimulus
ASK THE EXPERTS
“Because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 
than it would have been without the stimulus bill.”
“Taking into account all of the ARRA’s economic conse-
quences—including the economic costs of raising taxes to pay 
for the spending, its effects on future spending, and any other 
likely future effects—the benefits of the stimulus will end up 
exceeding its costs.”

CHAPTER 34   THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND
firms make investment plans far in advance. Thus, most economists believe that it 
takes at least 6 months for changes in monetary policy to have much effect on out-
put and employment. Moreover, once these effects occur, they can last for several 
years. Critics of stabilization policy argue that because of this lag, the Fed should 
not try to fine-tune the economy. They claim that the Fed often reacts too late to 
changing economic conditions and, as a result, ends up being a cause of rather 
than a cure for economic fluctuations. These critics advocate a passive monetary 
policy, such as slow and steady growth in the money supply.
Fiscal policy also works with a lag, but unlike the lag in monetary policy, the 
lag in fiscal policy is largely attributable to the political process. In the United 
States, most changes in government spending and taxes must go through con-
gressional committees in both the House and the Senate, be passed by both 
legislative bodies, and then be signed by the president. Completing this pro-
cess can take months or, in some cases, years. By the time the change in fiscal 
policy is passed and ready to implement, the condition of the economy may 
have changed.
These lags in monetary and fiscal policy are a problem in part because  economic 
forecasting is so imprecise. If forecasters could accurately predict the condition of 
the economy a year in advance, then monetary and fiscal policymakers could look 
ahead when making policy decisions. In this case, policymakers could stabilize 
the economy despite the lags they face. In practice, however, major recessions and 
depressions arrive without much advance warning. The best that policymakers 
can do is to respond to economic changes as they occur.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
34-3c Automatic Stabilizers
All economists—both advocates and critics of stabilization policy—agree that the 
lags in implementation reduce the efficacy of policy as a tool for short-run stabili-
zation. The economy would be more stable, therefore, if policymakers could find 
a way to avoid some of these lags. In fact, they have. Automatic stabilizers are 
changes in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand when the economy goes 
into a recession without policymakers having to take any deliberate action.
The most important automatic stabilizer is the tax system. When the economy 
goes into a recession, the amount of taxes collected by the government falls auto-
matically because almost all taxes are closely tied to economic activity. The per-
sonal income tax depends on households’ incomes, the payroll tax depends on 
workers’ earnings, and the corporate income tax depends on firms’ profits. Be-
cause incomes, earnings, and profits all fall in a recession, the government’s tax 
revenue falls as well. This automatic tax cut stimulates aggregate demand and, 
thereby, reduces the magnitude of economic fluctuations.
Some government spending also acts as an automatic stabilizer. In particular, 
when the economy goes into a recession and workers are laid off, more people 
apply for unemployment insurance benefits, welfare benefits, and other forms 
of income support. This automatic increase in government spending stimulates 
aggregate demand at exactly the time when aggregate demand is insufficient to 
maintain full employment. Indeed, when the unemployment insurance system 
was first enacted in the 1930s, economists who advocated this policy did so in 
part because of its power as an automatic stabilizer.
The automatic stabilizers in the U.S. economy are not sufficiently strong to pre-
vent recessions completely. Nonetheless, without these automatic stabilizers, output 
and employment would probably be more volatile than they are. For this reason, 
many economists oppose a constitutional amendment that would require the federal 
government always to run a balanced budget, as some politicians have proposed. 
When the economy goes into a recession, taxes fall, government spending rises, and 
the government’s budget moves toward deficit. If the government faced a strict bal-
anced-budget rule, it would be forced to look for ways to raise taxes or cut spending 
in a recession. In other words, a strict balanced-budget rule would eliminate the au-
tomatic stabilizers inherent in our current system of taxes and government spending.

34-4 Conclusion
Before policymakers make any change in policy, they need to consider all the ef-
fects of their decisions. Earlier in the book, we examined classical models of the 
economy, which describe the long-run effects of monetary and fiscal policy. There 
we saw how fiscal policy influences saving, investment, and long-run growth and 
how monetary policy influences the price level and the inflation rate.
In this chapter, we examined the short-run effects of monetary and fiscal pol-
icy. We saw how these policy instruments can change the aggregate demand for 
goods and services and alter the economy’s production and employment in the

short run. When Congress reduces government spending to balance the budget, 
it needs to consider both the long-run effects on saving and growth and the short-
run effects on aggregate demand and employment. When the Fed reduces the 
growth rate of the money supply, it must take into account the long-run effect on 
inflation as well as the short-run effect on production. In all parts of government, 
policymakers must keep in mind both long-run and short-run goals.
• In developing a theory of short-run economic fluctu-
ations, Keynes proposed the theory of liquidity pref-
erence to explain the determinants of the interest rate. 
According to this theory, the interest rate adjusts to bal-
ance the supply and demand for money. 
• An increase in the price level raises money demand 
and increases the interest rate that brings the money 
market into equilibrium. Because the interest rate rep-
resents the cost of borrowing, a higher interest rate re-
duces investment and, thereby, the quantity of goods 
and services demanded. The downward-sloping 
aggregate-demand curve expresses this negative re-
lationship between the price level and the quantity 
demanded.
• Policymakers can influence aggregate demand with 
monetary policy. An increase in the money supply re-
duces the equilibrium interest rate for any given price 
level. Because a lower interest rate stimulates invest-
ment spending, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to 
the right. Conversely, a decrease in the money supply 
raises the equilibrium interest rate for any given price 
level and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.

QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS
• Policymakers can also influence aggregate demand 
with fiscal policy. An increase in government pur-
chases or a cut in taxes shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve to the right. A decrease in government purchases 
or an increase in taxes shifts the aggregate-demand 
curve to the left.
• When the government alters spending or taxes, the 
resulting shift in aggregate demand can be larger 
or smaller than the fiscal change. The multiplier ef-
fect tends to amplify the effects of fiscal policy on 
aggregate demand. The crowding-out effect tends 
to dampen the effects of fiscal policy on aggregate 
demand.
• Because monetary and fiscal policy can influence 
aggregate demand, the government sometimes uses 
these policy instruments in an attempt to stabilize 
the economy. Economists disagree about how active 
the government should be in this effort. According 
to advocates of active stabilization policy, changes in 
attitudes by households and firms shift aggregate de-
mand; if the government does not respond, the result 
is undesirable and unnecessary fluctuations in output 
and employment. According to critics of active stabi-
lization policy, monetary and fiscal policy work with 
such long lags that attempts at stabilizing the econ-
omy often end up being destabilizing.

pay interest on checking deposits, which they could 
not do previously.
a. If we define money to include checking deposits, 
what effect did this legislation have on money 
 demand? Explain.
b. If the Federal Reserve had maintained a constant 
money supply in the face of this change, what 
would have happened to the interest rate? What 
would have happened to aggregate demand and 
aggregate output?
c. If the Federal Reserve had maintained a constant 
market interest rate (the interest rate on nonmone-
tary assets) in the face of this change, what change 
in the money supply would have been necessary? 
What would have happened to aggregate demand 
and aggregate output?
7. Suppose economists observe that an increase in 
 government spending of $10 billion raises the total 
 demand for goods and services by $30 billion.
a. If these economists ignore the possibility of 
crowding out, what would they estimate the mar-
ginal propensity to consume (MPC) to be?
b. Now suppose the economists allow for crowding 
out. Would their new estimate of the MPC be 
larger or smaller than their initial one?
8. An economy is operating with output that is $400 
billion below its natural level, and fiscal policymakers 
want to close this recessionary gap. The central bank 
agrees to adjust the money supply to hold the interest 
rate constant, so there is no crowding out. The mar-
ginal propensity to consume is 4/5, and the price level 
is completely fixed in the short run. In what direction 
and by how much would government spending need 
to change to close the recessionary gap? Explain your 
thinking.
9. Suppose government spending increases. Would the 
effect on aggregate demand be larger if the Federal 
Reserve held the money supply constant in response 
or if the Fed were committed to maintaining a fixed 
interest rate? Explain.
10. In which of the following circumstances is expan-
sionary fiscal policy more likely to lead to a short-run 
increase in investment? Explain.
a. When the investment accelerator is large or when 
it is small?
b. When the interest sensitivity of investment is large 
or when it is small?
11. Consider an economy described by the following 
equations:
Y = C + I + G
C = 100 + 0.75(Y − T)
I = 500 – 50 r
G = 125
T = 100
where Y is GDP, C is consumption, I is invest-
ment, G is government purchases, T is taxes, and 
r is the interest rate. If the economy were at full

employment (that is, at its natural rate), GDP would 
be 2,000.
a. Explain the meaning of each of these equations. 
b. What is the marginal propensity to consume in 
this economy?
c. Suppose the central bank’s policy is to adjust 
the money supply to maintain the interest rate 
at 4 percent, so r = 4. Solve for GDP. How does it 
compare to the full-employment level?
d. Assuming no change in monetary policy, what 
change in government purchases would restore 
full employment?
e. Assuming no change in fiscal policy, what 
change in the interest rate would restore full 
employment?

CHAPTER

The Short-Run Trade-off  
between Inflation and 
Unemployment
T
wo closely watched indicators of economic performance are inflation and 
unemployment. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data on these 
variables each month, policymakers are eager to hear the news. Some com-
mentators have added together the inflation rate and the unemployment rate to 
produce a misery index, which they use to gauge the health of the economy. 
How are these two measures of economic performance related to each other? 
Earlier in the book, we discussed the long-run determinants of unemployment 
and the long-run determinants of inflation. We saw that the natural rate of

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
unemployment depends on various features of the labor market, such as mini-
mum-wage laws, the market power of unions, the role of efficiency wages, and 
the effectiveness of job search. By contrast, the inflation rate depends primarily on 
growth in the money supply, which a nation’s central bank controls. In the long 
run, therefore, inflation and unemployment are largely unrelated problems.
In the short run, just the opposite is true. One of the Ten Principles of Economics
discussed in Chapter 1 is that society faces a short-run trade-off between infla-
tion and unemployment. If monetary and fiscal policymakers expand aggregate 
demand and move the economy up along the short-run aggregate-supply curve, 
they can expand output and reduce unemployment for a while, but only at the 
cost of a more rapidly rising price level. If policymakers contract aggregate de-
mand and move the economy down the short-run aggregate-supply curve, they 
can reduce inflation, but only at the cost of temporarily lower output and higher 
unemployment.
In this chapter, we examine the inflation–unemployment trade-off more closely. 
The relationship between inflation and unemployment has attracted the attention 
of some of the most brilliant economists of the last half century. The best way to 
understand this relationship is to see how thinking about it has evolved. As we 
will see, the history of thought regarding inflation and unemployment since the 
1950s is inextricably connected to the history of the U.S. economy. These two his-
tories will show why the trade-off between inflation and unemployment holds in 
the short run, why it does not hold in the long run, and what issues the trade-off 
raises for economic policymakers. 
35-1 The Phillips Curve
“Probably the single most important macroeconomic relationship is the Phillips 
curve.” These are the words of economist George Akerlof from the lecture he gave 
when he received the Nobel Prize in 2001. The Phillips curve is the short-run 
relationship between inflation and unemployment. We begin our story with the 
discovery of the Phillips curve and its migration to America.
35-1a Origins of the Phillips Curve
In 1958, economist A. W. Phillips published an article in the British journal  
Economica that would make him famous. The article was titled “The Relationship 
between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages in the United 
Kingdom, 1861–1957.” In it, Phillips showed a negative correlation between the rate 
of unemployment and the rate of inflation. That is, Phillips showed that years with 
low unemployment tend to have high inflation, and years with high unemployment 
tend to have low inflation. (Phillips examined inflation in nominal wages rather 
than inflation in prices. For our purposes, the distinction is not important because 
these two measures of inflation usually move together.) Phillips concluded that 
two important macroeconomic variables—inflation and unemployment—were 
linked in a way that economists had not previously appreciated.
Although Phillips’s discovery was based on data for the United Kingdom, 
researchers quickly extended his finding to other countries. Two years after 
Phillips published his article, economists Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow 
published an article in the American Economic Review called “Analytics of Anti-
Inflation Policy” in which they showed a similar negative correlation between 
inflation and unemployment in data for the United States. They reasoned that this

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
correlation arose because low unemployment was associated with high aggregate 
demand, which in turn put upward pressure on wages and prices throughout 
the economy. Samuelson and Solow dubbed the negative association between 
inflation and unemployment the Phillips curve. Figure 1 shows an example of a 
Phillips curve like the one found by Samuelson and Solow.
As the title of their paper suggests, Samuelson and Solow were interested in 
the Phillips curve because they believed it held important lessons for policymak-
ers. In particular, they suggested that the Phillips curve offers policymakers a 
menu of possible economic outcomes. By altering monetary and fiscal policy to 
influence aggregate demand, policymakers could choose any point on this curve. 
Point A offers high unemployment and low inflation. Point B offers low unem-
ployment and high inflation. Policymakers might prefer both low inflation and 
low unemployment, but the historical data as summarized by the Phillips curve 
indicate that this combination is impossible. According to Samuelson and Solow, 
policymakers face a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, and the Phil-
lips curve illustrates that trade-off.
35-1b  Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply,  
and the Phillips Curve
The model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply provides an easy expla-
nation for the menu of possible outcomes described by the Phillips curve. The 
Phillips curve shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that arise in the 
short run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy along the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve. As we saw in the preceding two chapters, an increase in the 
aggregate demand for goods and services leads, in the short run, to a larger out-
put of goods and services and a higher price level. Larger output means greater 
employment and, thus, a lower rate of unemployment. In addition, a higher price 
level translates into a higher rate of inflation. Thus, shifts in aggregate demand 
push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions in the short run—a 
relationship illustrated by the Phillips curve.
To see more fully how this works, let’s consider an example. To keep the 
numbers simple, imagine that the price level (as measured, for instance, by the 
FIGURE 1
The Phillips Curve
The Phillips curve illustrates a negative  
association between the inflation rate and 
the unemployment rate. At point A, inflation 
is low and unemployment is high. At point B, 
inflation is high and unemployment is low.

consumer price index) equals 100 in the year 2020. Figure 2 shows two possible 
outcomes that might occur in the year 2021 depending of the strength of aggre-
gate demand. One outcome occurs if aggregate demand is high, and the other 
occurs if aggregate demand is low. Panel (a) shows these two outcomes using the 
model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Panel (b) illustrates the same 
two outcomes using the Phillips curve.
Panel (a) of the figure shows what happens to output and the price level in the 
year 2021. If the aggregate demand for goods and services is low, the economy 
experiences outcome A. The economy produces output of 15,000, and the price 
level is 102. By contrast, if aggregate demand is high, the economy experiences 
outcome B. Output is 16,000, and the price level is 106. This is an example of a 
familiar conclusion: Higher aggregate demand moves the economy to an equilib-
rium with higher output and a higher price level.
Panel (b) shows what these two possible outcomes mean for unemployment 
and inflation. Because firms need more workers when they produce a greater output 
of goods and services, unemployment is lower in outcome B than in outcome A. In 
this example, when output rises from 15,000 to 16,000, unemployment falls from 
7 percent to 4 percent. Moreover, because the price level is higher at outcome B 
than at outcome A, the inflation rate (the percentage change in the price level 
from the previous year) is also higher. In particular, since the price level was 100 
in the year 2020, outcome A has an inflation rate of 2 percent and outcome B has 
an  inflation rate of 6 percent. The two possible outcomes for the economy can 
be compared either in terms of output and the price level (using the model of

aggregate demand and aggregate supply) or in terms of unemployment and infla-
tion (using the Phillips curve). 
Because monetary and fiscal policy can shift the aggregate-demand curve, they 
can move an economy along the Phillips curve. Increases in the money supply, 
increases in government spending, or cuts in taxes expand aggregate demand 
and move the economy to a point on the Phillips curve with higher inflation and 
lower unemployment. Decreases in the money supply, cuts in government spend-
ing, or increases in taxes contract aggregate demand and move the economy to a 
point on the Phillips curve with lower inflation and higher unemployment. In this 
sense, the Phillips curve offers policymakers a menu of combinations of inflation 
and unemployment.

gate supply to show how policy can move the economy from a point on 
this curve with high inflation to a point with low inflation.
Although the Phillips curve seems to offer policymakers a menu of inflation–
unemployment outcomes, it raises a crucial question: Does this set of possible 
choices remain the same over time? In other words, is the downward-sloping 
Phillips curve a stable relationship on which policymakers can rely? Economists 
took up this issue in the late 1960s, shortly after Samuelson and Solow had intro-
duced the Phillips curve into the macroeconomic policy debate.
35-2a The Long-Run Phillips Curve
In 1968, economist Milton Friedman published a paper in the American Economic 
Review based on an address he had recently given as president of the American 
Economic Association. The paper, titled “The Role of Monetary Policy,” contained 
sections on “What Monetary Policy Can Do” and “What Monetary Policy Cannot 
Do.” Friedman argued that one thing monetary policy cannot do, other than for a 
short time, is lower unemployment by raising inflation. At about the same time, 
another economist, Edmund Phelps, also published a paper denying the existence 
of a long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Both Friedman and Phelps based their conclusions on classical principles of 
macroeconomics. Classical theory points to growth in the money supply as the 
primary determinant of inflation. But classical theory also states that monetary 
growth does not affect real variables such as output and employment; it merely 
alters all prices and nominal incomes proportionately. In particular, monetary 
growth does not influence those factors that determine the economy’s unemploy-
ment rate, such as the market power of unions, the role of efficiency wages, or the 
process of job search. As a result, Friedman and Phelps concluded that, in the long 
run, the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment would not be related.
Here, in his own words, is Friedman’s view about what the Federal Reserve 
can hope to accomplish for the economy in the long run:
 The monetary authority controls nominal quantities—directly, the quantity of its 
own liabilities [currency plus bank reserves]. In principle, it can use this control 
to peg a nominal quantity—an exchange rate, the price level, the nominal level 
of national income, the quantity of money by one definition or another—or to 
peg the change in a nominal quantity—the rate of inflation or deflation, the

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
rate of growth or decline in nominal national income, the rate of growth of 
the quantity of money. It cannot use its control over nominal quantities to peg 
a real quantity—the real rate of interest, the rate of unemployment, the level 
of real national income, the real quantity of money, the rate of growth of real 
national income, or the rate of growth of the real quantity of money.
According to Friedman, monetary policymakers face a long-run Phillips curve 
that is vertical, as in Figure 3. If the Fed increases the money supply slowly, the 
inflation rate is low and the economy finds itself at point A. If the Fed increases 
the money supply quickly, the inflation rate is high and the economy finds itself 
at point B. In either case, the unemployment rate tends toward its normal level, 
called the natural rate of unemployment. The vertical long-run Phillips curve illus-
trates the conclusion that unemployment does not depend on money growth and 
inflation in the long run.
The vertical long-run Phillips curve is, in essence, one expression of the clas-
sical idea of monetary neutrality. Previously, we expressed monetary neutrality 
with a vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve. Figure 4 shows that the verti-
cal long-run Phillips curve and the vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve are 
two sides of the same coin. In panel (a) of this figure, an increase in the money 
supply shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right from AD1 to AD2. As a 
result of this shift, the long-run equilibrium moves from point A to point B. The 
price level rises from P1 to P2, but because the aggregate-supply curve is ver-
tical, output remains the same. In panel (b), more rapid growth in the money 
supply raises the inflation rate by moving the economy from point A to point B. 
But because the Phillips curve is vertical, the rate of unemployment is the same 
at these two points. Thus, the vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve and 
the vertical long-run Phillips curve both imply that monetary policy influences 
nominal variables (the price level and the inflation rate) but not real variables 
(output and unemployment). In the long run, regardless of the monetary policy 
pursued by the Fed, output is at its natural level and unemployment is at its 
natural rate.
FIGURE 3
The Long-Run Phillips Curve
According to Friedman and Phelps, 
there is no trade-off between inflation 
and  unemployment in the long run. 
Growth in the money supply deter-
mines the inflation rate. Regardless of 
the inflation rate, the unemployment 
rate gravitates toward its natural rate. 
As a result, the long-run  Phillips curve 
is vertical.

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
35-2b The Meaning of “Natural”
What is so “natural” about the natural rate of unemployment? Friedman and 
Phelps used this adjective to describe the unemployment rate toward which the 
economy gravitates in the long run. Yet the natural rate of unemployment is not 
necessarily the socially desirable rate of unemployment. Nor is the natural rate of 
unemployment constant over time. 
For example, suppose that a newly formed union uses its market power to 
raise the real wages of some workers above the equilibrium level. The result is an 
excess supply of workers and, therefore, a higher natural rate of unemployment. 
This unemployment is natural not because it is good but because it is beyond the 
influence of monetary policy. More rapid money growth would reduce neither the 
market power of the union nor the level of unemployment; it would lead only to 
more inflation.
Although monetary policy cannot influence the natural rate of unemployment, 
other types of policy can. To reduce the natural rate of unemployment, policy-
makers should look to policies that improve the functioning of the labor mar-
ket. Earlier in the book, we discussed how various labor-market policies, such as 
minimum-wage laws, collective-bargaining laws, unemployment insurance, and 
job-training programs, affect the natural rate of unemployment. A policy change 
that reduced the natural rate of unemployment would shift the long-run Phillips 
curve to the left. In addition, because lower unemployment means more workers 
are producing goods and services, the quantity of goods and services supplied 
would be larger at any given price level and the long-run aggregate-supply curve

to point B. The price level rises from P1 to P2, while output remains the same. Panel (b) 
shows the long-run Phillips curve, which is vertical at the natural rate of unem-
ployment. In the long run, expansionary monetary policy moves the economy from 
lower inflation (point A) to higher inflation (point B) without changing the rate of 
unemployment.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
would shift to the right. The economy could then enjoy lower unemployment and 
higher output for any given rate of money growth and inflation. 
35-2c Reconciling Theory and Evidence
At first, Friedman and Phelps’s conclusion that there is no long-run trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment might not seem persuasive. Their argument 
was based on an appeal to theory, specifically classical theory’s prediction of 
monetary neutrality. By contrast, the negative correlation between inflation and 
unemployment documented by Phillips, Samuelson, and Solow was based on 
actual evidence from the real world. Why should anyone believe that policymakers 
faced a vertical Phillips curve when the world seemed to offer a downward-
sloping one? Shouldn’t the findings of Phillips, Samuelson, and Solow lead us to 
reject monetary neutrality?
Friedman and Phelps were well aware of these questions, and they offered 
a way to reconcile classical macroeconomic theory with the finding of a down-
ward-sloping Phillips curve in data from the United Kingdom and the United 
States. They claimed that a negative relationship between inflation and unem-
ployment exists in the short run but that it cannot be used by policymakers as 
a menu of outcomes in the long run. Policymakers can pursue expansionary 
monetary policy to achieve lower unemployment for a while, but eventually, 
unemployment will return to its natural rate. In the long run, more expansionary 
monetary policy leads only to higher inflation.
Friedman and Phelps’s work was the basis of our discussion of the difference 
between the short-run and long-run aggregate-supply curves in Chapter 33. As 
you may recall, the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, indicating that the 
price level does not influence quantity supplied in the long run. But the short-run 
aggregate-supply curve slopes upward, indicating that an increase in the price 
level raises the quantity of goods and services that firms supply. According to the 
sticky-wage theory of aggregate supply, for instance, nominal wages are set in 
advance based on the price level that workers and firms expected to prevail. When 
prices are higher than expected, firms have an incentive to increase production and 
employment; when prices are lower than expected, firms reduce production and 
employment. Yet because the expected price level and nominal wages will even-
tually adjust, the positive relationship between the actual price level and quantity 
supplied exists only in the short run.
Friedman and Phelps applied this same logic to the Phillips curve. Just as 
the aggregate-supply curve slopes upward only in the short run, the trade-off 
 between inflation and unemployment holds only in the short run. And just as the 
long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, the long-run Phillips curve is also 
vertical. Once again, expectations are the key for understanding how the short 
run and the long run are related.
Friedman and Phelps introduced a new variable into the analysis of the 
inflation–unemployment trade-off: expected inflation. Expected inflation measures 
how much people expect the overall price level to change. Because the expected 
price level affects nominal wages, expected inflation is one factor that determines 
the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. In the short run, the Fed 
can take expected inflation (and, thus, the short-run aggregate-supply curve) as 
already determined. When the money supply changes, the aggregate-demand 
curve shifts and the economy moves along a given short-run aggregate-supply 
curve. In the short run, therefore, monetary changes lead to unexpected fluctua-
tions in output, prices, unemployment, and inflation. In this way, Friedman and

771
CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
Phelps explained the downward-sloping Phillips curve that Phillips, Samuelson, 
and Solow had documented. 
The Fed’s ability to create unexpected inflation by increasing the money 
 supply exists only in the short run. In the long run, people come to expect 
 whatever inflation rate the Fed chooses to produce and nominal wages will 
adjust to keep pace with inflation. As a result, the long-run aggregate-supply 
curve is vertical. Changes in aggregate demand, such as those due to changes 
in the money  supply, affect neither the economy’s output of goods and services 
nor the number of workers that firms need to hire to produce those goods and 
services. Friedman and Phelps concluded that unemployment returns to its nat-
ural rate in the long run.
35-2d The Short-Run Phillips Curve
The analysis of Friedman and Phelps can be summarized by the following 
equation:
Unemployment 
Natural rate of 
Actual 
Expected
rate 
=   unemployment −    a  inflation −  inflation
This equation (which is, in essence, another expression of the aggregate-supply 
equation we have seen previously) relates the unemployment rate to the natural 
rate of unemployment, actual inflation, and expected inflation. In the short run, 
expected inflation is given, so higher actual inflation is associated with lower 
unemployment. (The variable a is a parameter that measures how much unem-
ployment responds to unexpected inflation.) In the long run, people come to 
expect whatever inflation the Fed produces, so actual inflation equals expected 
inflation, and unemployment is at its natural rate.
This equation implies there can be no stable short-run Phillips curve. Each 
short-run Phillips curve reflects a particular expected rate of inflation. (To be pre-
cise, if you graph the equation, you’ll find that the downward-sloping short-run 
Phillips curve intersects the vertical long-run Phillips curve at the expected rate 
of inflation.) When expected inflation changes, the short-run Phillips curve shifts.
According to Friedman and Phelps, it is dangerous to view the Phillips curve 
as a menu of options available to policymakers. To see why, imagine an economy 
that starts with low inflation, with an equally low rate of expected inflation, and 
with unemployment at its natural rate. In Figure 5, the economy is at point A. 
Now suppose that policymakers try to take advantage of the trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment by using monetary or fiscal policy to expand  
aggregate demand. In the short run, when expected inflation is given, the econ-
omy goes from point A to point B. Unemployment falls below its natural rate, 
and the actual inflation rate rises above expected inflation. As the economy moves 
from point A to point B, policymakers might think they have achieved perma-
nently lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation—a bargain that, if pos-
sible, might be worth making.
This situation, however, will not persist. Over time, people get used to this 
higher inflation rate, and they raise their expectations of inflation. When expected 
inflation rises, firms and workers start taking higher inflation into account when 
setting wages and prices. The short-run Phillips curve then shifts to the right, as 
shown in the figure. The economy ends up at point C, with higher inflation than 
at point A but with the same level of unemployment. Thus, Friedman and Phelps 
concluded that policymakers face only a temporary trade-off between inflation 
a
b

772
PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
and unemployment. In the long run, expanding aggregate demand more rapidly 
will yield higher inflation without any reduction in unemployment.
35-2e The Natural Experiment for the Natural-Rate Hypothesis
Friedman and Phelps had made a bold prediction in 1968: If policymakers try 
to take advantage of the Phillips curve by choosing higher inflation to reduce 
unemployment, they will succeed at reducing unemployment only temporarily. 
This view—that unemployment eventually returns to its natural rate, regardless 
of the rate of inflation—is called the natural-rate hypothesis. A few years after 
Friedman and Phelps proposed this hypothesis, monetary and fiscal policy-
makers inadvertently created a natural experiment to test it. Their laboratory was 
the U.S. economy.
Before we examine the outcome of this test, however, let’s look at the data that 
Friedman and Phelps had when they made their prediction in 1968. Figure 6 shows 
the unemployment and inflation rates for the period from 1961 to 1968. These data 
trace out an almost perfect Phillips curve. As inflation rose over these 8 years, 
unemployment fell. The economic data from this era seemed to confirm that 
policymakers faced a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 
The apparent success of the Phillips curve in the 1960s made the prediction of 
Friedman and Phelps all the bolder. In 1958, Phillips had suggested a negative 
association between inflation and unemployment. In 1960, Samuelson and Solow 
had shown that it existed in U.S. data. Another decade of data had confirmed 
the relationship. To some economists at the time, it seemed ridiculous to claim 
that the historically reliable Phillips curve would start shifting once policymakers 
tried to take advantage of it.
In fact, that is exactly what happened. Beginning in the late 1960s, the govern-
ment followed policies that expanded the aggregate demand for goods and ser-
vices. In part, this expansion was due to fiscal policy: Government spending rose 
as the Vietnam War heated up. In part, it was due to monetary policy: Because the 
natural-rate hypothesis
the claim that unemploy-
ment eventually returns 
to its normal, or natural, 
rate, regardless of the 
rate of inflation
FIGURE 5
How Expected Inflation Shifts the  
Short-Run Phillips Curve
The higher the expected rate of inflation, the 
higher the curve representing the short-run 
trade-off between inflation and unemploy-
ment. At point A, expected inflation and 
actual inflation are equal at a low rate and 
unemployment is at its natural rate. If the Fed 
pursues an expansionary monetary policy, the 
economy moves from point A to point B in 
the short run. At point B, expected inflation 
is still low, but actual inflation is high. Unem-
ployment is below its natural rate. In the long 
run, expected inflation rises, and the economy 
moves to point C. At point C, expected infla-
tion and actual inflation are both high, and 
unemployment is back to its natural rate.

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
Fed was trying to hold down interest rates in the face of expansionary fiscal pol-
icy, the money supply (as measured by M2) rose about 13 percent per year during 
the period from 1970 to 1972, compared to 7 percent per year in the early 1960s. 
As a result, inflation stayed high (about 5 to 6 percent per year in the late 1960s 
and early 1970s, compared to about 1 to 2 percent per year in the early 1960s). But 
as Friedman and Phelps had predicted, unemployment did not stay low.
Figure 7 displays the history of inflation and unemployment from 1961 to 1973. 
It shows that the simple negative relationship between these two variables started 
to break down around 1970. In particular, as inflation remained high in the early 
1970s, people’s expectations of inflation caught up with reality, and the unem-
ployment rate reverted to the 5 percent to 6 percent range that had prevailed in 
the early 1960s. Notice that the history illustrated in Figure 7 resembles the theory 
of a shifting short-run Phillips curve shown in Figure 5. By 1973, policymakers 
had learned that Friedman and Phelps were right: There is no trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment in the long run.

35-3 Shifts in the Phillips Curve: The Role of Supply Shocks
Friedman and Phelps had suggested in 1968 that changes in expected inflation 
shift the short-run Phillips curve, and the experience of the early 1970s convinced 
most economists that Friedman and Phelps were right. Within a few years, how-
ever, the economics profession would turn its attention to a different source of 
shifts in the short-run Phillips curve: shocks to aggregate supply. 
This time, the change in focus came not from two American economics pro-
fessors but from a group of Arab sheiks. In 1974, the Organization of Petroleum 

774
PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to exert its market power as a cartel in the 
world oil market to increase its members’ profits. The countries of OPEC, 
including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq, restricted the amount of crude oil they 
pumped and sold on world markets. Within a few years, this reduction in supply 
caused the world price of oil to almost double.
A large increase in the world price of oil is an example of a supply shock. A 
supply shock is an event that directly affects firms’ costs of production and thus 
the prices they charge; it shifts the economy’s aggregate-supply curve and, as a 
result, the Phillips curve. For example, when an oil price increase raises the cost 
of producing gasoline, heating oil, tires, and many other products, it reduces the 
quantity of goods and services supplied at any given price level. As panel (a) of 
Figure 8 shows, this reduction in supply is represented by the leftward shift in the 
aggregate-supply curve from AS1 to AS2. Output falls from Y1 to Y2, and the price 
level rises from P1 to P2. The economy experiences stagflation—the combination of 
falling output (stagnation) and rising prices (inflation).
This shift in aggregate supply is associated with a similar shift in the short-
run Phillips curve, shown in panel (b). Because firms need fewer workers to pro-
duce the smaller output, employment falls and unemployment rises. Because the 
price level is higher, the inflation rate—the percentage change in the price level 
from the previous year—is also higher. Thus, the shift in aggregate supply leads 
to higher unemployment and higher inflation. The short-run trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment shifts to the right from PC1 to PC2. 
Confronted with an adverse shift in aggregate supply, policymakers face a dif-
ficult choice between fighting inflation and fighting unemployment. If they con-
tract aggregate demand to fight inflation, they will raise unemployment further. 
If they expand aggregate demand to fight unemployment, they will raise inflation 
further. In other words, policymakers face a less favorable trade-off between infla-
tion and unemployment than they did before the shift in aggregate supply: They

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
have to live with a higher rate of inflation for a given rate of unemployment, a 
higher rate of unemployment for a given rate of inflation, or some combination of 
higher unemployment and higher inflation.
Faced with such an adverse shift in the Phillips curve, policymakers will ask 
whether the shift is temporary or permanent. The answer depends on how people 
adjust their expectations of inflation. If people view the rise in inflation due to the 
supply shock as a temporary aberration, expected inflation will not change and 
the Phillips curve will soon revert to its former position. But if people believe the 
shock will lead to a new era of higher inflation, then expected inflation will rise 
and the Phillips curve will remain at its new, less desirable position. 
In the United States during the 1970s, expected inflation did rise substantially. 
This rise in expected inflation was partly attributable to the Fed’s decision 
to accommodate the supply shock with higher money growth. (Recall that 
policymakers are said to accommodate an adverse supply shock when they respond 
to it by increasing aggregate demand in an effort to keep output from falling.) 
Because of this policy decision, the recession that resulted from the supply shock 
was smaller than it otherwise might have been, but the U.S. economy faced an 
unfavorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment for many years. The 
problem was compounded in 1979 when OPEC once again started to exert its 
market power, more than doubling the price of oil. Figure 9 shows inflation and 
unemployment in the U.S. economy during this period.
In 1980, after two OPEC supply shocks, the U.S. economy had an inflation 
rate of more than 9 percent and an unemployment rate of about 7 percent. This 
combination of inflation and unemployment was not at all near the trade-off that 
seemed possible in the 1960s. (In the 1960s, the Phillips curve suggested that an

Panel (a) shows the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. When the 
 aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left from AS1 to AS2, the equilibrium moves from point A 
to point B. Output falls from Y1 to Y2, and the price level rises from P1 to P2. Panel (b) shows 
the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The adverse shift in aggregate 
supply moves the economy from a point with lower unemployment and lower inflation  
(point A) to a point with higher unemployment and higher inflation (point B). The short-
run Phillips curve shifts to the right from PC1 to PC2. Policymakers now face a worse set of 
 options for inflation and unemployment.

unemployment rate of 7 percent would be associated with an inflation rate of 
only 1 percent. Inflation of more than 9 percent was unthinkable.) With the misery 
index in 1980 near a historic high, the public was widely dissatisfied with the per-
formance of the economy. Largely because of this dissatisfaction, President Jimmy 
Carter lost his bid for reelection in November 1980 and was replaced by Ronald 
Reagan. Something had to be done, and soon it would be.

35-4 The Cost of Reducing Inflation
In October 1979, as OPEC was imposing adverse supply shocks on the world’s 
economies for the second time in a decade, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker decided 
that the time for action had come. Volcker had been appointed chairman by 
President Carter only two months earlier, and he had taken the job knowing that 
inflation had reached unacceptable levels. As guardian of the nation’s monetary 
system, he felt he had little choice but to pursue a policy of disinflation. Disinflation
is a reduction in the rate of inflation, and it should not be confused with deflation, 
a reduction in the price level. To draw an analogy to a car’s motion, disinflation is 
like slowing down, whereas deflation is like going in reverse. Chairman Volcker, 
along with many other Americans, wanted the economy’s rising level of prices to 
slow down.
Volcker had no doubt that the Fed could reduce inflation through its ability to 
control the quantity of money. But what would be the short-run cost of disinfla-
tion? The answer to this question was much less certain.

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
35-4a The Sacrifice Ratio
To reduce the inflation rate, the Fed has to pursue contractionary monetary policy. 
Figure 10 shows some of the effects of such a decision. When the Fed slows the 
rate at which the money supply is growing, it contracts aggregate demand. The 
fall in aggregate demand, in turn, reduces the quantity of goods and services that 
firms produce, and this fall in production leads to a rise in unemployment. The 
economy begins at point A in the figure and moves along the short-run Phillips 
curve to point B, which has lower inflation and higher unemployment. Over time, 
as people come to understand that prices are rising more slowly, expected infla-
tion falls, and the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward. The economy moves 
from point B to point C. Inflation is lower than it was initially at point A, and 
unemployment is back at its natural rate. 
Thus, if a nation wants to reduce inflation, it must endure a period of high 
unemployment and low output. In Figure 10, this cost is represented by the move-
ment of the economy through point B as it travels from point A to point C. The 
size of this cost depends on the slope of the Phillips curve and how quickly expec-
tations of inflation adjust to the new monetary policy.
Many studies have examined the data on inflation and unemployment to 
estimate the cost of reducing inflation. The findings of these studies are often 
summarized in a statistic called the sacrifice ratio. The sacrifice ratio is the num-
ber of percentage points of annual output lost in the process of reducing inflation 
by 1 percentage point. A typical estimate of the sacrifice ratio is 5. That is, for each 
percentage point that inflation is reduced, 5 percent of annual output must be sac-
rificed in the transition.
Such estimates surely must have made Paul Volcker apprehensive as he con-
fronted the task of reducing inflation. Inflation was running at almost 10 percent 
per year. To reach moderate inflation of, say, 4 percent per year would mean re-
ducing inflation by 6 percentage points. If each percentage point costs 5 percent

points of annual output

Disinflationary Monetary Policy  
in the Short Run and Long Run
When the Fed pursues contractionary 
monetary policy to reduce inflation, 
the economy moves along a short-run 
 Phillips curve from point A to point B.  
Over time, expected inflation falls, 
and the short-run Phillips curve shifts 
 downward. When the economy reaches 
point C, unemployment is back at its 
natural rate.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
of the economy’s annual output, then reducing inflation by 6 percentage points 
would require sacrificing 30 percent of annual output.
According to studies of the Phillips curve and the cost of disinflation, this sac-
rifice could be paid in various ways. An immediate reduction in inflation would 
depress output by 30 percent for a single year, but that outcome was surely too 
harsh even for an inflation hawk like Paul Volcker. It would be better, many  
argued, to spread out the cost over several years. If the reduction in inflation took 
place over 5 years, for instance, then output would have to average only 6 percent 
below trend during that period to add up to a sacrifice of 30 percent. An even 
more gradual approach would be to reduce inflation slowly over a decade so that 
output would have to be only 3 percent below trend. Whatever path was chosen, 
however, it seemed that reducing inflation would not be easy.
35-4b  Rational Expectations and the Possibility  
of Costless Disinflation
Just as Paul Volcker was pondering how costly reducing inflation might be, a 
group of economics professors was leading an intellectual revolution that would 
challenge the conventional wisdom on the sacrifice ratio. This group included 
such prominent economists as Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, and Robert Barro. 
Their revolution was based on a new approach to economic theory and policy 
called rational expectations. According to the theory of rational expectations, 
people optimally use all the information they have, including information about 
government policies, when forecasting the future. 
This new approach has had profound implications for many areas of macroeco-
nomics, but none is more important than its application to the trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment. As Friedman and Phelps had first emphasized, 
expected inflation is an important variable that explains why there is a trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment in the short run but not in the long run. 
How quickly the short-run trade-off disappears depends on how quickly peo-
ple adjust their expectations of inflation. Proponents of rational expectations ex-
panded upon the Friedman-Phelps analysis to argue that when economic policies 
change, people adjust their expectations of inflation accordingly. The studies of 
inflation and unemployment that had tried to estimate the sacrifice ratio had 
failed to take account of the direct effect of the policy regime on expectations. As a 
result, estimates of the sacrifice ratio were, according to the rational-expectations 
theorists, unreliable guides for policy.
In a 1981 paper titled “The End of Four Big Inflations,” Thomas Sargent 
described this new view as follows:
 An alternative “rational expectations” view denies that there is any inherent 
momentum to the present process of inflation. This view maintains that firms 
and workers have now come to expect high rates of inflation in the future and 
that they strike inflationary bargains in light of these expectations. However, it 
is held that people expect high rates of inflation in the future precisely because 
the government’s current and prospective monetary and fiscal policies warrant 
those expectations. . . . An implication of this view is that inflation can be 
stopped much more quickly than advocates of the “momentum” view have 
indicated and that their estimates of the length of time and the costs of stopping 
inflation in terms of forgone output are erroneous. . . . This is not to say that 
it would be easy to eradicate inflation. On the contrary, it would require more 
than a few temporary restrictive fiscal and monetary actions. It would require a

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
change in the policy regime. . . . How costly such a move would be in terms of 
forgone output and how long it would be in taking effect would depend partly 
on how resolute and evident the government’s commitment was.
According to Sargent, the sacrifice ratio could be much smaller than suggested by 
previous estimates. Indeed, in the most extreme case, it could be zero: If the gov-
ernment made a credible commitment to a policy of low inflation, people would be 
rational enough to lower their expectations of inflation immediately. The short-run 
Phillips curve would shift downward, and the economy would reach low inflation 
quickly without the cost of temporarily high unemployment and low output.
35-4c The Volcker Disinflation
As we have seen, when Paul Volcker faced the prospect of reducing inflation from 
its peak of about 10 percent, the economics profession offered two conflicting pre-
dictions. One group of economists offered estimates of the sacrifice ratio and con-
cluded that reducing inflation would have great cost in terms of lost output and 
high unemployment. Another group offered the theory of rational expectations 
and concluded that reducing inflation could be much less costly and, perhaps, 
could even have no cost at all. Who was right?
Figure 11 shows inflation and unemployment from 1979 to 1987. As you can 
see, Volcker did succeed at reducing inflation. Inflation came down from almost 
10 percent in 1981 and 1982 to about 4 percent in 1983 and 1984. Credit for this 
reduction in inflation goes completely to monetary policy. Fiscal policy at this time 
was acting in the opposite direction: The increases in the budget deficit during the 
Reagan administration were expanding aggregate demand, which tends to raise 
inflation. The fall in inflation from 1981 to 1984 is attributable to the tough anti-
inflation policies of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.
The figure shows that the Volcker disinflation did come at the cost of high 
unemployment. In 1982 and 1983, the unemployment rate was about 10 percent—
about 4 percentage points above its level when Paul Volcker was appointed Fed 
FIGURE 11

This figure shows annual data from 1979 
to 1987 on the unemployment rate and on

unemployment in 1982 and 1983. Note 
that the points labeled A, B, and C in this

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
chairman. At the same time, the production of goods and services as measured 
by real GDP was well below its trend level. The Volcker disinflation produced a  
recession that was, at the time, the deepest the United States had experienced 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Does this episode refute the possibility of costless disinflation as suggested by 
the rational-expectations theorists? Some economists have argued that the answer 
to this question is a resounding yes. Indeed, the pattern of disinflation shown in 
Figure 11 is similar to the pattern predicted in Figure 10. To make the transition 
from high inflation (point A in both figures) to low inflation (point C), the econ-
omy had to experience a painful period of high unemployment (point B).
Yet there are two reasons not to reject the conclusions of the rational-expectations 
theorists so quickly. First, even though the Volcker disinflation did impose a cost 
of temporarily high unemployment, the cost was not as large as many econo-
mists had predicted. Most estimates of the sacrifice ratio based on the Volcker 
disinflation are smaller than estimates that had been obtained from previous data. 
Perhaps Volcker’s tough stand on inflation did have some direct effect on expecta-
tions, as the rational-expectations theorists claimed.
Second, and more important, even though Volcker announced that he would 
aim monetary policy to lower inflation, much of the public did not believe him. 
Because few people thought Volcker would reduce inflation as quickly as he did, 
expected inflation did not fall immediately; as a result, the short-run Phillips curve 
did not shift down as quickly as it might have. Some evidence for this hypothesis 
comes from the forecasts made by commercial forecasting firms: Their forecasts of 
inflation fell more slowly in the 1980s than did actual inflation. Thus, the Volcker 
disinflation does not necessarily refute the rational-expectations view that credible 
disinflation can be costless. It does show, however, that policymakers cannot count 
on people to immediately believe them when they announce a policy of disinflation.
35-4d The Greenspan Era
Since the OPEC inflation of the 1970s and the Volcker disinflation of the 1980s, the 
U.S. economy has experienced relatively mild fluctuations in inflation and unem-
ployment. Figure 12 shows inflation and unemployment from 1984 to 2005. This 
period is called the Greenspan era, after Alan Greenspan who in 1987 followed 
Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
This period began with a favorable supply shock. In 1986, OPEC members started 
arguing over production levels, and their long-standing agreement to restrict sup-
ply broke down. Oil prices fell by about half. As the figure shows, this favorable 
supply shock led to falling inflation and falling unemployment from 1984 to 1986.
Throughout the Greenspan era, the Fed was careful to avoid repeating the pol-
icy mistakes of the 1960s, when excessive aggregate demand pushed unemploy-
ment below the natural rate and raised inflation. When unemployment fell and 
inflation rose in 1989 and 1990, the Fed raised interest rates and contracted aggre-
gate demand, leading to a small recession in 1991 and 1992. Unemployment then 
rose above most estimates of the natural rate, and inflation fell once again.
The rest of the 1990s witnessed a period of economic prosperity. Inflation grad-
ually drifted downward, approaching zero by the end of the decade. Unemploy-
ment also drifted downward, leading many observers to believe that the natural 
rate of unemployment had fallen. Part of the credit for this good economic per-
formance goes to Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed, for low inflation 
can be achieved only with prudent monetary policy. But good luck in the form of 
favorable supply shocks is also part of the story.

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
In 2001, however, the economy ran into problems. The end of the dot-com stock 
market bubble, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and corporate accounting scandals all 
depressed aggregate demand. Unemployment rose as the economy experienced 
its first recession in a decade. But a combination of expansionary monetary and 
fiscal policies helped end the downturn, and by early 2005, unemployment was 
close to most estimates of the natural rate.
In 2005, President Bush nominated Ben Bernanke to follow Alan Greenspan as 
the chairman of the Fed. Bernanke was sworn in on February 1, 2006. In 2009, Ber-
nanke was reappointed by President Obama. At the time of his initial nomination, 
Bernanke said, “My first priority will be to maintain continuity with the policies 
and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years.” 
35-4e  A Financial Crisis Takes Us for a Ride  
along the Phillips Curve 
Ben Bernanke may have hoped to continue the policies of the Greenspan era and 
to enjoy the relative calm of those years, but his wishes would not be fulfilled. 
During his first few years on the job, the new Fed chairman faced some significant 
and daunting economic challenges.
As we have seen in previous chapters, the main challenge arose from prob-
lems in the housing market and financial system. From 1995 to 2006, the U.S. 
housing market boomed and average U.S. house prices more than doubled. But 
this housing boom proved unsustainable, and from 2006 to 2009 house prices 
fell by about one-third. This large fall led to declines in household wealth and 
difficulties for many financial institutions that had bet (through the purchase of 
mortgage-backed securities) that house prices would continue to rise. The result-
ing financial crisis resulted in a large decline in aggregate demand and a steep 
increase in unemployment.
We have already looked at the story of the crisis and the policy responses to it 
in previous chapters, but Figure 13 shows what these events meant for inflation

 unemployment were relatively small.

and unemployment. From 2007 to 2010, as the decline in aggregate demand raised 
unemployment from below 5 percent to about 10 percent, it also reduced the rate 
of inflation from about 3 percent to about 1 percent. In essence, the economy rode 
down the short-run Phillips curve.
From 2010 to 2015, the economy slowly recovered. Unemployment fell back to 
about 5 percent, while the rate of inflation remained between 1 and 2 percent. One 
notable feature of this period is that the very low inflation of 2009 and 2010 does not 
appear to have substantially reduced expected inflation and shifted the short-run 
Phillips curve downward. Instead, expected inflation appears to have remained 
steady at about 2 percent, which kept the short-run Phillips curve relatively stable. 
A common explanation for this phenomenon is that the Federal Reserve had, over 
the previous 20 years, established a lot of credibility in its commitment to keep 
inflation at about 2 percent. As a result, expected inflation and the position of the 
short-run Phillips curve reacted less to the dramatic short-run events.

This chapter has examined how economists’ thinking about inflation and unem-
ployment has evolved. We have discussed the ideas of many of the best econ-
omists of the 20th century: from the Phillips curve of Phillips, Samuelson, and 
Solow, to the natural-rate hypothesis of Friedman and Phelps, to the rational-
expectations theory of Lucas, Sargent, and Barro. Six members of this group won 
Nobel Prizes for their work in economics.
Although the trade-off between inflation and unemployment has generated 
much intellectual turmoil, certain principles have developed that command

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
consensus. Here is how Milton Friedman expressed the relationship between 
inflation and unemployment in 1968:
 There is always a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment; 
there is no permanent tradeoff. The temporary tradeoff comes not from 
inflation per se, but from unanticipated inflation, which generally means, 
from a rising rate of inflation. The widespread belief that there is a permanent 
tradeoff is a sophisticated version of the confusion between “high” and “rising” 
that we all recognize in simpler forms. A rising rate of inflation may reduce 
unemployment, a high rate will not.
But how long, you will say, is “temporary”? . . . I can at most venture a 
personal judgment, based on some examination of the historical evidence, 
that the initial effects of a higher and unanticipated rate of inflation last for 
something like two to five years.
Today, about a half century later, this statement still summarizes the view of most 
macroeconomists.

PART XII   SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS
SUMMARY
KEY CONCEPTS
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
PROBLEMS AND APPLICATIONS 
r The Phillips curve describes a negative relationship 
between inflation and unemployment. By expanding 
aggregate demand, policymakers can choose a point 
on the Phillips curve with higher inflation and lower 
unemployment. By contracting aggregate demand, 
policymakers can choose a point on the Phillips curve 
with lower inflation and higher unemployment.
r The trade-off between inflation and unemployment 
described by the Phillips curve holds only in the short 
run. In the long run, expected inflation adjusts to 
changes in actual inflation, and the short-run Phillips 
curve shifts. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve is 
vertical at the natural rate of unemployment.
r The short-run Phillips curve also shifts because of 
shocks to aggregate supply. An adverse supply shock, 
such as an increase in world oil prices, gives policy-
makers a less favorable trade-off between inflation and 
unemployment. That is, after an adverse supply shock, 
policymakers have to accept a higher rate of inflation 
for any given rate of unemployment or a higher rate of 
unemployment for any given rate of inflation.
r When the Fed contracts growth in the money supply 
to reduce inflation, it moves the economy along the 
short-run Phillips curve, which results in temporarily 
high unemployment. The cost of disinflation depends 
on how quickly expectations of inflation fall. Some 
economists argue that a credible commitment to low 
inflation can reduce the cost of disinflation by inducing 
a quick adjustment of expectations.

describe the four situations listed here. Label the point 
that shows the position of the economy in each case.
a. Actual inflation is 5 percent, and expected inflation 
is 3 percent.
b. Actual inflation is 3 percent, and expected inflation 
is 5 percent.
c. Actual inflation is 5 percent, and expected inflation 
is 5 percent.
d. Actual inflation is 3 percent, and expected inflation 
is 3 percent.
2. Illustrate the effects of the following developments on 
both the short-run and long-run Phillips curves. Give 
the economic reasoning underlying your answers.
a. a rise in the natural rate of unemployment
b. a decline in the price of imported oil
c. a rise in government spending
d. a decline in expected inflation
3. Suppose that a fall in consumer spending causes a 
recession.
a. Illustrate the immediate change in the economy 
using both an aggregate-supply/aggregate- 
demand diagram and a Phillips-curve diagram.

CHAPTER 35   THE SHORT-RUN TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
On both graphs, label the initial long-run equilib-
rium as point A and the resulting short-run equi-
librium as point B. What happens to inflation and 
unemployment in the short run?
b. Now suppose that over time expected inflation 
changes in the same direction that actual infla-
tion changes. What happens to the position of 
the short-run Phillips curve? After the recession 
is over, does the economy face a better or worse 
set of inflation–unemployment combinations? 
Explain.
4. Suppose the economy is in a long-run equilibrium.
a. Draw the economy’s short-run and long-run 
Phillips curves.
b. Suppose a wave of business pessimism reduces 
aggregate demand. Show the effect of this shock 
on your diagram from part a. If the Fed under-
takes expansionary monetary policy, can it return 
the economy to its original inflation rate and origi-
nal unemployment rate?
c. Now suppose the economy is back in long-run 
equilibrium and then the price of imported oil 
rises. Show the effect of this shock with a new 
diagram like that in part a. If the Fed undertakes 
expansionary monetary policy, can it return the 
economy to its original inflation rate and origi-
nal unemployment rate? If the Fed undertakes 
contractionary monetary policy, can it return the 
economy to its original inflation rate and original 
unemployment rate? Explain why this situation 
differs from that in part b.
5. The inflation rate is 10 percent, and the central bank 
is considering slowing the rate of money growth 
to reduce inflation to 5 percent. Economist Milton 
believes that expectations of inflation change quickly 
in response to new policies, whereas economist James 
believes that expectations are very sluggish. Which 
economist is more likely to favor the proposed change 
in monetary policy? Why? 
6. Suppose the Federal Reserve’s policy is to maintain 
low and stable inflation by keeping unemployment 
at its natural rate. However, the Fed believes that the 
natural rate of unemployment is 4 percent when the 
actual natural rate is 5 percent. If the Fed based its 
 policy decisions on its belief, what would happen to 
the economy? How might the Fed come to realize that 
its belief about the natural rate was mistaken?
7. Suppose the Federal Reserve announced that it would 
pursue contractionary monetary policy to reduce the 
inflation rate. Would the following conditions make 
the ensuing recession more or less severe? Explain.
a. Wage contracts have short durations.
b. There is little confidence in the Fed’s determina-
tion to reduce inflation.
c. Expectations of inflation adjust quickly to actual 
inflation.
8. As described in the chapter, the Federal Reserve in 
2008 faced a decrease in aggregate demand caused 
by the housing and financial crises and a decrease in 
short-run aggregate supply caused by rising commod-
ity prices. 
a. Starting from a long-run equilibrium, illustrate the 
effects of these two changes using both an aggre-
gate-supply/aggregate-demand diagram and a 
Phillips-curve diagram. On both diagrams, label 
the initial long-run equilibrium as point A and 
the resulting short-run equilibrium as point B. For 
each of the following variables, state whether it 
rises or falls or whether the impact is ambiguous: 
output, unemployment, the price level, the infla-
tion rate.
b. Suppose the Fed responds quickly to these shocks 
and adjusts monetary policy to keep unemploy-
ment and output at their natural rates. What 
action would it take? On the same set of graphs 
from part a, show the results. Label the new 
 equilibrium as point C.
c. Why might the Fed choose not to pursue the 
course of action described in part b?

t is hard to follow the news without finding some politician or editorial writer 
advocating a change in economic policy. The president should raise taxes to 
reduce the budget deficit, or he should stop worrying about the budget deficit. 
The Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy, or 
it should avoid such moves in order not to risk higher inflation. Congress should 
reform the tax system to promote faster economic growth, or it should reform 
the tax system to achieve a more equal distribution of income. Such economic 
issues are central to the continuing political debate in the United States and other 
countries around the world.

PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
Previous chapters have developed the tools that economists use to analyze 
the behavior of the economy as a whole and the impact of policies on the econ-
omy. This final chapter considers six classic questions about macroeconomic pol-
icy. Economists have long debated these questions, and they will likely continue 
to do so for years to come. The knowledge you have accumulated in this course 
provides the foundation upon which we can discuss these important, unsettled 
issues. It should help you choose a side in these debates or, at least, help you see 
why choosing a side is so difficult.
36-1  Should Monetary and Fiscal Policymakers Try  
to Stabilize the Economy?
In the preceding three chapters, we saw how changes in aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply can lead to short-run fluctuations in production and employ-
ment. We also saw how monetary and fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand 
and, thereby, influence these fluctuations. But even if policymakers can influence 
short-run economic fluctuations, does that mean they should? Our first debate 
concerns whether monetary and fiscal policymakers should use the tools at their 
disposal in an attempt to smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle.
36-1a Pro: Policymakers Should Try to Stabilize the Economy
Left on their own, economies fluctuate. When households and firms become 
pessimistic, for instance, they cut back on spending, and this reduces the aggregate 
demand for goods and services. The fall in aggregate demand, in turn, reduces the 
production of goods and services. Firms lay off workers, and the unemployment 
rate rises. Real GDP and other measures of income fall. Rising unemployment and 
falling income help confirm the pessimism that initially generated the economic 
downturn. 
Such a recession has no benefit for society—it represents a sheer waste of 
resources. Workers who lose their jobs because of declining aggregate demand 
would rather be working. Business owners whose factories are idle during a 
recession would rather be producing valuable goods and services and selling 
them at a profit. 
There is no reason for society to suffer through the booms and busts of the busi-
ness cycle. Macroeconomic theory shows policymakers how to reduce the sever-
ity of economic fluctuations. By “leaning against the wind” of economic change, 
monetary and fiscal policy can stabilize aggregate demand and, thereby, pro-
duction and employment. When aggregate demand is inadequate to ensure full 
employment, policymakers should boost government spending, cut taxes, and 
expand the money supply. When aggregate demand is excessive, risking higher 
inflation, policymakers should cut government spending, raise taxes, and reduce 
the money supply. Such policy actions put macroeconomic theory to its best use 
by leading to a more stable economy, which benefits everyone. 
36-1b Con: Policymakers Should Not Try to Stabilize the Economy
Monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the economy in theory, but 
there are substantial obstacles to the use of such policies in practice. 
One problem is that monetary and fiscal policies do not affect the economy 
immediately but instead work with a long lag. Monetary policy affects aggre-
gate demand primarily by changing interest rates, which in turn affect spending,

particularly residential and business investment. But many households and 
firms set their spending plans in advance. As a result, it takes time for changes in  
interest rates to alter the aggregate demand for goods and services. Many studies 
indicate that changes in monetary policy have little effect on aggregate demand 
until about 6 months after the change is made.
Fiscal policy works with a lag because of the long political process that governs 
changes in spending and taxes. To make any change in fiscal policy, a bill must go 
through congressional committees, pass both the House and the Senate, and be 
signed by the president. It can take years to propose, pass, and implement a major 
change in fiscal policy.
Because of these long lags, policymakers who want to stabilize the economy 
need to look ahead to economic conditions that are likely to prevail when their 
actions will take effect. Unfortunately, economic forecasting is highly imprecise, 
in part because macroeconomics is such a primitive science and in part because 
the shocks that cause economic fluctuations are intrinsically unpredictable. Thus, 
when policymakers change monetary or fiscal policy, they must rely on educated 
guesses about future economic conditions.
Too often, policymakers trying to stabilize the economy end up having the oppo-
site effect. Economic conditions can easily change between the time a policy action 
begins and the time it takes effect. Because of this, policymakers can inadvertently 
exacerbate rather than mitigate the magnitude of economic fluctuations. Some econ-
omists have claimed that many of the major economic fluctuations in history, includ-
ing the Great Depression of the 1930s, can be traced to destabilizing policy actions. 
A rule that all physicians learn early in their training is “first, do no harm.” The 
human body has natural restorative powers. Confronted with a sick patient and 
an uncertain diagnosis, often a doctor should do nothing but leave the patient’s 
body to its own devices. Intervening in the absence of reliable knowledge merely 
risks making matters worse. 
The same can be said about treating an ailing economy. It might be desirable if 
policymakers could eliminate all economic fluctuations, but that is not a realistic

36-2  Should the Government Fight Recessions with  
Spending Hikes Rather Than Tax Cuts?
When George W. Bush became president in 2001, the economy was slipping into a 
recession. He responded by cutting tax rates. When Barack Obama became pres-
ident in 2009, the economy was in the middle of the Great Recession, the worst 
economic downturn in many decades. He responded with a stimulus package that 
offered some tax reductions but also included substantial increases in government 
spending. The contrast between these two policies illustrates a classic question 
of macroeconomics: Which instrument of fiscal policy—government spending or 
taxes—is better for reducing the severity of economic downturns?
36-2a  Pro: The Government Should Fight Recessions  
with Spending Hikes
John Maynard Keynes transformed economics when he wrote The General The-
ory of Employment, Interest and Money in the midst of the Great Depression of the 
1930s, the worst economic downturn in U.S. history. Since then, economists have 
understood that the fundamental problem during recessions is inadequate aggre-
gate demand. When firms are unable to sell a sufficient quantity of goods and 
services, they reduce production and employment. The key to ending recessions 
is to restore aggregate demand to a level consistent with full employment of the 
economy’s labor force.
To be sure, monetary policy is the first line of defense against economic down-
turns. By increasing the money supply, the central bank reduces interest rates. 
Lower interest rates in turn reduce the cost of borrowing to finance investment 
projects, such as new factories and new housing. Increased spending on invest-
ment adds to aggregate demand and helps to restore normal levels of production 
and employment.
Fiscal policy provides an additional tool to combat recessions. When the govern-
ment cuts taxes, it increases households’ disposable income, which encourages them 
to increase spending on consumption. When the government buys goods and ser-
vices, it adds directly to aggregate demand. Moreover, these fiscal actions can have 
multiplier effects: Higher aggregate demand leads to higher incomes, which in turn 
induces additional consumer spending and further increases in aggregate demand.
Fiscal policy is particularly useful when the tools of monetary policy lose their 
effectiveness. During the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, for example, the 
Federal Reserve cut its target interest rate to about zero. The Fed cannot reduce  
interest rates below zero, because people would hold onto their cash rather than 
lending it out at a negative interest rate. Thus, once interest rates are at zero, the 
Fed loses its most powerful tool for stimulating the economy. In this circumstance, 
it is natural for the government to turn to fiscal policy—taxes and government 
spending—to prop up aggregate demand.

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
Traditional Keynesian analysis indicates that increases in government pur-
chases are a more potent tool than decreases in taxes. When the government gives 
a dollar in tax cuts to a household, part of that dollar may be saved rather than 
spent. (That is especially true if households view the tax reduction as temporary 
rather than permanent.) The part of the dollar that is saved does not contribute to 
the aggregate demand for goods and services. By contrast, when the government 
spends a dollar buying a good or service, that dollar immediately and fully adds 
to aggregate demand.
In 2009, economists in the Obama administration used a conventional macro-
economic model to calculate the magnitude of these effects. According to their 
computer simulations, each dollar of tax cuts increases GDP by $0.99, whereas 
each dollar of government purchases increases GDP by $1.59. Thus, increases in 
government spending offer a bigger “bang for the buck” than decreases in taxes. 
For this reason, the policy response in 2009 featured fewer federal tax cuts and 
more increases in federal spending.
Policymakers focused on three kinds of spending. First, there was spending 
on “shovel-ready” projects. These were public works projects such as repairs to 
highways and bridges on which construction could begin immediately, putting 
the unemployed back to work. Second, there was federal aid to state and local 
governments. Because many of these governments are constitutionally required 
to run balanced budgets, falling tax revenues during recessions can make it neces-
sary for them to lay off teachers, police, and other public workers; federal aid pre-
vented that outcome or, at least, reduced its severity. Third, there were increased 
payments to the jobless through the unemployment insurance system. Because 
the unemployed are often financially stretched, they were thought to be likely 
to spend rather than save this extra income. Thus, these transfer payments were 
thought to contribute more to aggregate demand—and thereby production and 
employment—than tax cuts would. According to the macroeconomic model used 
by the Obama administration, the $800 billion stimulus package would create or 
save more than 3 million jobs by the end of the president’s second year in office.
It is impossible to know for sure what effect the stimulus in fact had. Because 
we get only one run at history, we cannot observe what would have happened 
without the stimulus package. Yet one thing is clear: While the economic down-
turn of 2008–2009 was severe, it could have been worse. In the Great Depression 
of the 1930s, real GDP fell by 27 percent and unemployment reached 25 percent. In 
the Great Recession, real GDP fell by only 4 percent and unemployment reached 
only 10 percent. As judged by either GDP or unemployment, the Great Recession 
did not approach the magnitude of the Great Depression. 
36-2b Con: The Government Should Fight Recessions with Tax Cuts
There is a long tradition of using tax policy to stimulate a moribund economy. 
President Kennedy proposed a tax reduction as one of his major economic initia-
tives; it eventually passed under President Johnson in 1964. President Reagan also 
signed into law significant tax cuts when he became president in 1981. Both of 
these tax reductions were soon followed by robust economic growth.
Tax cuts have a powerful influence on both aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply. They increase aggregate demand by increasing households’ disposable 
income, as emphasized in traditional Keynesian analysis. But they can also 
increase aggregate demand by altering incentives. For example, if the tax 
reductions take the form of an expanded investment tax credit, they can induce 
increased spending on investment goods. Because investment spending is the 

794
PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
most volatile component of GDP over the business cycle, stimulating investment 
is a key to ending recessions. Policymakers can target investment specifically with 
well-designed tax policy.
At the same time that tax cuts increase aggregate demand, they can also 
increase aggregate supply. When the government reduces marginal tax 
rates, workers keep a higher fraction of any income they earn. As a result, the 
unemployed have a greater incentive to search for jobs, and the employed have 
a greater incentive to work longer hours. Increased aggregate supply, along with 
the increased aggregate demand, means that the production of goods and services 
can expand without putting upward pressure on the rate of inflation.
There are various problems with increasing government spending during  
recessions. First of all, consumers understand that higher government spending, 
together with the government borrowing needed to finance it, will likely lead to 
higher taxes in the future. The anticipation of those future taxes will induce con-
sumers to cut back spending today. Moreover, like most taxes, those in the future 
are likely to cause a variety of deadweight losses. As businesses look ahead to a 
more highly distorted future economy, they may reduce their expectations of fu-
ture profits and reduce investment spending today. Because of these various effects, 
government-spending multipliers may be smaller than is conventionally believed.
It is also far from clear whether the government can spend money both wisely 
and quickly. Large government spending projects often require years of planning, 
as policymakers and voters weigh the costs and benefits of the many alternative 
courses of action. By contrast, when unemployment soars during recessions, the 
need for additional aggregate demand is immediate. If the government increases 
spending quickly, it may end up buying things of little public value. But if it tries 
to be careful and deliberate in planning its expenditures, it may fail to increase 
aggregate demand in a timely fashion. 
Tax cuts have the advantage of decentralizing spending decisions, rather than 
relying on a centralized and highly imperfect political process. Households spend 
their disposable income on things they value. Firms spend their investment dol-
lars on projects they expect to be profitable. By contrast, when the government 
tries to spend large sums of money fast, subject to various political pressures, it 
may end up building “bridges to nowhere.” Ill-conceived public projects may  
employ some workers, but they create little lasting value. Moreover, they will 
leave future generations of taxpayers with significant additional debts. In the end, 
the short-run benefits of additional aggregate demand from increased govern-
ment spending may fail to compensate for the long-run costs.

36-3  Should Monetary Policy Be Made by Rule Rather  
Than by Discretion?
As we learned in the chapter on the monetary system, the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee sets monetary policy in the United States. The committee meets 
about every 6 weeks to evaluate the state of the economy. Based on this evaluation 
and forecasts of future economic conditions, it chooses whether to raise, lower, 
or leave unchanged the level of short-term interest rates. The Fed then adjusts

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
the money supply to reach that interest-rate target, which will normally remain 
unchanged until the next meeting.
The Federal Open Market Committee operates with almost complete discre-
tion over how to conduct monetary policy. The laws that created the Fed give the  
institution only vague recommendations about what goals it should pursue. A 
1977 amendment to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act said the Fed “shall maintain 
long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the 
economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively 
the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term inter-
est rates.” But the act does not specify how to weight these various goals, nor does 
it tell the Fed how to pursue whatever objective it might choose.
Some economists are critical of this institutional design. Our next debate over 
macroeconomic policy, therefore, focuses on whether the Federal Reserve should 
have its discretionary powers reduced and, instead, be committed to following a 
rule for how it conducts monetary policy.
36-3a Pro: Monetary Policy Should Be Made by Rule
Discretion in the conduct of monetary policy has two problems. The first is that 
it does not limit incompetence and abuse of power. When the government sends  
police into a community to maintain civic order, it gives them strict guidelines 
about how to carry out their job. Because police have great power, allowing them to 
exercise that power however they wanted would be dangerous. Yet when the gov-
ernment gives central bankers the authority to maintain economic order, it gives 
them few guidelines. Monetary policymakers are allowed undisciplined discretion.
One example of the abuse of power is that central bankers are sometimes 
tempted to use monetary policy to affect the outcome of elections. Suppose that 
the vote for the incumbent president is based on economic conditions at the time 
he is up for reelection. A central banker sympathetic to the incumbent might be 
tempted to pursue expansionary policies just before the election to stimulate pro-
duction and employment, knowing that the resulting inflation will not show up 
until after the election. Thus, to the extent that central bankers ally themselves 
with politicians, discretionary policy can lead to economic fluctuations that reflect 
the electoral calendar. Economists call such fluctuations the political business cycle. 
Prior to the election of 1972, for instance, President Richard Nixon pressured Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns to pursue a more expansionary monetary 
policy, presumably to bolster Nixon’s reelection chances.
The second and subtler problem with discretionary monetary policy is that it 
might lead to more inflation than is desirable. Central bankers, knowing that there 
is no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, often announce 
that their goal is zero inflation. Yet they rarely achieve price stability. Why? Per-
haps it is because, once the public forms expectations of inflation, policymakers 
face a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. They are tempted 
to renege on their announcement of price stability to achieve lower unemploy-
ment. This discrepancy between announcements (what policymakers say they are 
going to do) and actions (what they subsequently in fact do) is called the time 
inconsistency of policy. Because policymakers are so often time inconsistent, people 
are skeptical when central bankers announce their intentions to reduce the rate of 
inflation. As a result, people always expect more inflation than monetary policy-
makers claim they are trying to achieve. Higher expectations of inflation, in turn, 
shift the short-run Phillips curve upward, making the short-run trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment less favorable than it otherwise might be.

796
PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
One way to avoid these two problems with discretionary policy is to commit 
the central bank to a policy rule. For example, suppose that Congress passed a 
law requiring the Fed to increase the money supply by exactly 3 percent per 
year. (Why 3 percent? Because real GDP grows on average about 3 percent per 
year, and because money demand grows with real GDP, 3 percent growth in the 
money supply is roughly the rate necessary to produce long-run price stability.) 
Such a law would eliminate incompetence and abuse of power on the part of 
the Fed, and it would make the political business cycle impossible. In addition, 
policy could no longer be time inconsistent. People would now believe the Fed’s 
announcement of low inflation because the Fed would be legally required to pursue 
a low-inflation monetary policy. With low expected inflation, the economy would 
face a more favorable short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
Other rules for monetary policy are also possible. A more active rule might 
allow some feedback from the state of the economy to changes in monetary pol-
icy. For example, a more active rule might require the Fed to increase monetary 
growth by 1 percentage point for every percentage point that unemployment 
rises above its natural rate. Regardless of the precise form of the rule, committing 
the Fed to some rule would yield advantages by limiting incompetence, abuse of 
power, and time inconsistency in the conduct of monetary policy. 
36-3b Con: Monetary Policy Should Not Be Made by Rule
There may be pitfalls with discretionary monetary policy, but there is also an 
important advantage to it: flexibility. The Fed has to confront various circum-
stances, not all of which can be foreseen. In the 1930s, banks failed in record num-
bers. In the 1970s, the price of oil skyrocketed around the world. In October 1987, 
the stock market fell by 22 percent in a single day. From 2007 to 2009, house prices 
dropped, home foreclosures soared, and the financial system experienced signifi-
cant problems. The Fed must decide how to respond to these shocks to the econ-
omy. A designer of a policy rule could not possibly consider all the contingencies 
and specify in advance the right policy response. It is better to appoint good people 
to conduct monetary policy and then give them the freedom to do the best they can.
Moreover, the alleged problems with discretion are largely hypothetical. The 
practical importance of the political business cycle, for instance, is far from clear. 
While it is true that Nixon tried to pressure Burns in 1972, it is not clear that he 
succeeded: Interest rates rose significantly during the election year. Moreover, in 
some cases, just the opposite seems to occur. President Jimmy Carter appointed 
Paul Volcker to head the Federal Reserve in 1979. Nonetheless, in October of that 
year, Volcker switched to a contractionary monetary policy to combat the high 
rate of inflation that he had inherited from his predecessor. The predictable result 
of Volcker’s decision was a recession, and the predictable result of the recession 
was a decline in Carter’s popularity. Rather than using monetary policy to help 
the president who had appointed him, Volcker took actions he thought were in 
the national interest, even though they contributed to Carter’s defeat by Ronald 
Reagan in the November 1980 election.
The practical importance of time inconsistency is also far from clear. Although 
most people are skeptical of central-bank announcements, central bankers can 
achieve credibility over time by backing up their words with actions. In the 1990s 
and 2000s, the Fed achieved and maintained a low rate of inflation, despite the 
ever-present temptation to take advantage of the short-run trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment. This experience shows that low inflation does not 
require that the Fed be committed to a policy rule.

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
Any attempt to replace discretion with a rule must confront the difficult task of 
specifying a precise rule. Despite much research examining the costs and benefits 
of alternative rules, economists have not reached consensus about what a good 
rule would be. Until there is consensus, society has little choice but to give central 
bankers discretion to conduct monetary policy as they see fit. 
QuickQuiz
Give an example of a monetary policy rule. Why might your rule be better

Inflation Targeting
O
ver the past few decades, many central banks around the world have 
adopted a policy called inflation targeting. Sometimes this takes the 
form of a central bank announcing its intentions regarding the inflation 
rate over the next few years. At other times it takes the form of a national 
law that specifies an inflation goal for the central bank. 
Inflation targeting is not a commitment to an ironclad rule. In all the 
countries that have adopted inflation targeting, central banks are left 
with a fair amount of discretion. Inflation targets are usually set as a 
range—an inflation rate of 1 to 3 percent, for example—rather than a 
particular number. Thus, the central bank can choose where in the range 
it wants to be. Moreover, the central bank is sometimes allowed to adjust 
its target for inflation, at least temporarily, if some event (such as a 
shock to world oil prices) pushes inflation outside the target range.
Although inflation targeting leaves the central bank with some discre-
tion, the policy does constrain how that discretion is used. When a central 
bank is told simply to “do the right thing,” it is hard to hold the central 
bank accountable, because people can argue forever about what is right. 
By contrast, when a central bank has an inflation target, the public can 
more easily judge whether the central bank is meeting its goals. Inflation 
targeting does not tie the hands of the central bank, but it does increase 
the transparency and accountability of monetary policy. In a sense, infla-
tion targeting is a compromise in the debate over rules versus discretion.
Compared with other 
central banks around the 
world, the Federal Reserve 
was slow to adopt a policy 
of inflation targeting, al-
though some commentators 
had long suggested that the 
Fed had an implicit inflation target of about 2 percent. In January 2012, 
the Federal Open Market Committee made the policy more explicit. Its 
press release read as follows:
The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by mon-
etary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a 
longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee judges that inflation at 
the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent 
over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. 
Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep 
longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering 
price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing 
the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face 
of significant economic disturbances. ■
36-4 Should the Central Bank Aim for Zero Inflation?
One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1, and developed more 
fully in the chapter on money growth and inflation, is that prices rise when the 
government prints too much money. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics dis-
cussed in Chapter 1, and developed more fully in the preceding chapter, is that 
society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Put to-
gether, these two principles raise a question for policymakers: How much infla-
tion should the central bank be willing to tolerate? Our next debate is whether 
zero is the right target for the inflation rate.

PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
36-4a Pro: The Central Bank Should Aim for Zero Inflation
Inflation confers no benefit on society, but it imposes several real costs. As we 
have discussed, economists have identified six costs of inflation:
• Shoeleather costs associated with reduced money holdings 
• Menu costs associated with more frequent adjustment of prices 
• Increased variability of relative prices 
• Unintended changes in tax liabilities due to nonindexation of the tax code 
• Confusion and inconvenience resulting from a changing unit of account
• Arbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with dollar-denominated debts 
Some economists argue that these costs are small, at least for moderate rates of 
inflation, such as the 3 percent inflation experienced in the United States during 
the 1990s and 2000s. But other economists claim these costs can be substantial, 
even for moderate inflation. Moreover, there is no doubt that the public dislikes 
inflation. When inflation heats up, opinion polls identify inflation as one of the 
nation’s leading problems.
The benefits of zero inflation have to be weighed against the costs of achiev-
ing it. Reducing inflation usually requires a period of high unemployment and 
low output, as illustrated by the short-run Phillips curve. But this disinflationary 
recession is only temporary. Once people come to understand that policymakers 
are aiming for zero inflation, expectations of inflation will fall and the short-run 
trade-off will improve. Because expectations adjust, there is no trade-off between 
inflation and unemployment in the long run. 
Reducing inflation is, therefore, a policy with temporary costs and permanent 
benefits. Once the disinflationary recession is over, the benefits of zero inflation 
persist into the future. If policymakers are farsighted, they should be willing to 
incur the temporary costs for the permanent benefits. This was precisely the cal-
culation made by Paul Volcker in the early 1980s, when he tightened monetary 
policy and reduced inflation from about 10 percent in 1980 to about 4 percent in 
1983. Although in 1982 unemployment reached its highest level since the Great 
Depression, the economy eventually recovered from the recession, leaving a leg-
acy of low inflation. Today, Volcker is considered a hero among central bankers.
Moreover, the costs of reducing inflation need not be as large as some econo-
mists claim. If the Fed announces a credible commitment to zero inflation, it can 
directly influence expectations of inflation. Such a change in expectations can 
improve the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, allowing 
the economy to reach lower inflation at a reduced cost. The key to this strategy 
is credibility: People must believe that the Fed is actually going to carry through 
on its announced policy. Congress could help in this regard by passing legislation 
that makes price stability the Fed’s primary goal. Such a law would decrease the 
cost of achieving zero inflation without reducing any of the resulting benefits.
One advantage of a zero-inflation target is that zero provides a more natural 
focal point for policymakers than any other number. Suppose, for instance, that 
the Fed were to announce that it would keep inflation at 3 percent—the rate expe-
rienced during much of the previous two decades. Would the Fed really stick to 
that 3 percent target? If events inadvertently pushed inflation up to 4 or 5 percent, 
why wouldn’t it just raise the target? There is, after all, nothing special about the 
number 3. By contrast, zero is the only number for the inflation rate at which the 
Fed can claim that it has achieved price stability and fully eliminated the costs of 
inflation.

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
36-4b Con: The Central Bank Should Not Aim for Zero Inflation
Price stability may be desirable, but the benefits of zero inflation compared to 
moderate inflation are small, whereas the costs of reaching zero inflation are 
large. Estimates of the sacrifice ratio suggest that reducing inflation by 1 per-
centage point requires giving up about 5 percent of one year’s output. Reduc-
ing inflation from, say, 4 percent to zero requires a loss of 20 percent of a year’s 
output. People might dislike inflation of 4 percent, but it is not at all clear that 
they would (or should) be willing to pay 20 percent of a year’s income to get 
rid of it.
The social costs of disinflation are even larger than this 20 percent figure 
 suggests, for the lost income is not spread equitably over the population. When 
the economy goes into recession, all incomes do not fall proportionately. Instead, 
the fall in aggregate income is concentrated on those workers who lose their 
jobs. The vulnerable workers are often those with the least skills and experience. 
Hence, much of the cost of reducing inflation is borne by those who can least 
 afford to pay it. 
Economists can list several costs of inflation, but there is no professional con-
sensus that these costs are substantial. The shoeleather costs, menu costs, and 
others that economists have identified do not seem great, at least for moderate 
rates of inflation. It is true that the public dislikes inflation, but the public may be 
 misled into believing the inflation fallacy—the view that inflation erodes living 
standards. Economists understand that living standards depend on productiv-
ity, not monetary policy. Because inflation in nominal incomes goes hand in hand 
with inflation in prices, reducing inflation would not cause real incomes to rise 
more rapidly. 
Moreover, policymakers can reduce many of the costs of inflation without 
 actually reducing inflation. They can eliminate the problems associated with the 
nonindexed tax system by rewriting the tax laws to take account of the effects 
of inflation. They can also reduce the arbitrary redistributions of wealth between 
creditors and debtors caused by unexpected inflation by issuing indexed gov-
ernment bonds, as the Clinton administration did in 1997. Such an act insulates 
holders of government debt from inflation. In addition, by setting an example, 
the policy might encourage private borrowers and lenders to write debt contracts 
indexed for inflation.
Reducing inflation might be desirable if it could be done at no cost, as some 
economists argue is possible. Yet this trick seems hard to carry out in practice. 
When economies reduce their rate of inflation, they almost always experience a 
period of high unemployment and low output. It is risky to believe that the cen-
tral bank could achieve credibility so quickly as to make disinflation painless.
Indeed, a disinflationary recession can potentially leave permanent scars on 
the economy. Firms in all industries reduce their spending on new plants and 
equipment substantially during recessions, making investment the most volatile 
component of GDP. Even after the recession is over, the smaller stock of capital 
reduces productivity, incomes, and living standards below the levels they other-
wise would have achieved. In addition, when workers become unemployed in 
recessions, they lose job skills, permanently reducing their value as workers. 
A little bit of inflation may even be a good thing. Some economists believe that 
inflation “greases the wheels” of the labor market. Because workers resist cuts 
in nominal wages, a fall in real wages is more easily accomplished with a rising 
price level. Inflation thus makes it easier for real wages to adjust to changes in 
labor-market conditions.

PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
How do central bankers choose a rate 
of inflation to target?
The Goal of 2% Inflation, 
Rethought 
By Neil Irwin 
S
ometimes, decisions that shape the world’s 
economic future are made with great pomp 
and gain widespread attention. Other times, 
they are made through a quick, unanimous vote 
by members of the New Zealand Parliament who 
were eager to get home for Christmas.
That is what happened 25 years ago this 
Sunday, when New Zealand became the first 
country to set a formal target for how much 
prices should rise each year—zero to 2 percent 
in its initial action. The practice was so success-
ful in making the high inflation of the 1970s and 
’80s a thing of the past that all of the world’s 
most advanced nations have emulated it in one 
form or another. A 2 percent inflation target is 
now the norm across much of the world, having 
become virtually an economic religion….
Yet even as the idea of a 2 percent target 
has become the orthodoxy, a worrying possibility 
is becoming clear: What if it’s wrong? What if it 
is one of the reasons that the global economy 
has been locked in five years of slow growth?
Some economists are beginning to consider 
the possibility that 2 percent inflation at all 
times leaves central banks with too little flexibil-
ity to adequately fight a deep economic malaise.
To understand that thinking, it’s worth  
understanding how New Zealand’s 2 percent tar-
get became so entrenched in the world economic 
order to begin with. The story starts in that South-
ern Hemisphere nation in the summer of 1989, 
with a kiwi farmer and banker named Don Brash.
When Mr. Brash stepped down as man-
aging director of the New Zealand Kiwifruit 
Authority to lead the country’s central bank in 
1988, he was taking the helm of an economy 
that had been through a rough two decades, 
with high inflation and disappointing growth.
Mr. Brash tells the story of an uncle who 
sold an apple orchard in 1971 and put the 
money into long-term government bonds to 
finance his retirement, only to see inflation 
wipe out 90 percent of his life savings by the 
time the bonds matured.
In the years before Mr. Brash took the 
helm of the central bank—the Reserve Bank 
of New Zealand—his predecessor had made 
progress in bringing down inflation and 
making the bank more independent from the 
whims of politicians. But that independence 
had not been codified in law.
That’s what the Reserve Bank Act of 1989 
was supposed to do. It directed the finance min-
ister and the head of the central bank to arrive at 
a formal target for how high inflation should be, 
and granted the central bank political indepen-
dence to guide interest rates to achieve that infla-
tion level. The head of the central bank could be 
dismissed for failure to reach the inflation goal.
For David Caygill, New Zealand’s finance 
minister at the time, the essential part of the 
law was establishing the bank’s independence 
from the political process. “Inflation targeting 
wasn’t from our point of view the main point 
of the act,” he said in an interview this month.
The debate over the legislation was con-
tentious. Labor unions feared that focusing so 
pointedly on inflation would lead to higher unem-
ployment. Some business interests agreed…. 
Ultimately, however, the leaders of the  
majority party in Parliament decided to brush 
off the concerns. It helped the cause that one of 
the bill’s strongest opponents was laid up in the 
hospital. And Christmas was around the corner.
Once the law was enacted, though, there 
was the difficult question of what the inflation 
target should be. Zero percent? Two percent? 
Five percent?
Mr. Brash and Mr. Caygill got a head start 
on an answer from an offhand comment made 
during a television interview in 1988. Roger 
Douglas, Mr. Caygill’s predecessor as finance 
minister, had been seeking to dissuade New 
Zealanders from thinking that the central bank 
would be content with high inflation, and so 
he said in an interview that he was aiming for  
inflation of around zero to 1 percent.
“It was almost a chance remark,” Mr. Brash  
said in a recent interview. “The figure was 
plucked out of the air to influence the public’s 
expectations.”
With Mr. Douglas’s figures as a starting point, 
Mr. Brash and Mr. Caygill agreed that it would be 
best to expand the range to give them more room 
to maneuver, but only a bit. New Zealand would 
aim for inflation between zero and 2 percent.
Not surprisingly, the passage of a law 
to reform the central bank governance of an 
archipelago of 3.4 million people received no 
coverage in the major American papers. But 
across the close-knit world of global central 
bankers, people started to notice the Kiwis’ 
monetary policy experiment.
At the time, the idea of a central bank 
simply announcing how much inflation it was 
aiming for was an almost radical idea. After 
all, central bankers had long considered a 
certain man-behind-the-curtain mystique as 
one of their tools of power.
The inflation goal may have reduced that 
mystique, but it created a kind of magic of 
its own. Merely by announcing its goals for 
inflation, and giving the central bank the 
independent authority to reach that goal, 
New Zealand made that result a reality. In 
negotiations over wages or making plans 
for price increases, businesses and labor 
unions across New Zealand started assum-
ing that inflation would indeed be around 2 
percent. It thus became self-fulfilling, with 
wages and prices rising more slowly.
Inflation was 7.6 percent at the end of 
1989 when the law was passed. By the end 
of 1991, it was 2 percent. Mr. Brash did a 
bit of a global campaigning, describing 
New Zealand’s success to his fellow central 
bankers at a conference in Jackson Hole, 
Wyo.—and to anyone else who would listen.

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
One by one, more countries adopted 
the approach. Canada, grappling with per-
sistently high inflation, set an inflation tar-
get of 2 percent in 1991. Countries including 
Sweden and Britain soon followed….
But the more that countries set about 
announcing a target, the more keen was the 
discussion about the actual number.
One view was that zero inflation should be 
the goal—that a dollar today should have the 
same buying power as a dollar in a decade, or 
two or three. That was the view embraced by, 
among others, Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed 
chairman. Alan Greenspan, Mr. Volcker’s suc-
cessor at the Fed, argued that inflation needed 
to be low enough that it didn’t have to be fac-
tored into business decisions.
Either of those approaches would imply 
that a proper target would be zero, or perhaps 
0.5 percent or 1 percent, given the difficulty 
of measuring inflation precisely.
But there was an alternate view—that keep-
ing inflation that low might be dangerous. And 
the person mounting that argument most force-
fully within the Federal Reserve in the 1990s was 
a Fed governor named Janet L. Yellen.
Behind the oversize doors of the Federal 
Reserve’s boardroom on Constitution Avenue 
in Washington, the fight over whether the 
world’s largest economy should emulate the 
likes of Canada and New Zealand took place 
in 1995 and 1996.
Ms. Yellen, who now runs the institution, 
worried that announcing an inflation target 
would make the Fed focus only on inflation and 
neglect its responsibilities to bolster growth and 
jobs. She worried that zero inflation could par-
alyze the economy, particularly during slumps, 
and felt that some inflation was necessary.
“To my mind the most important argument 
for some low inflation rate is the ‘greasing-the-
wheels argument,’” Ms. Yellen said in a closed-
door meeting of Fed policy makers in July 1996.
When businesses run into rough times, they 
may be inclined to cut workers’ pay. But in prac-
tice, that doesn’t happen much. Even in a severe 
downturn, businesses are more likely to cut hours, 
conduct layoffs or keep positions vacant than cut 
pay. That’s one reason recessions tend to lead to 
higher unemployment instead of lower wages.
Inflation helps deal with this problem. 
When there is a bit of inflation, employers 
can hold workers’ pay steady during a down-
turn yet have it decline in inflation-adjusted 
terms. Inflation creates an adjustment mech-
anism: An assembly line worker may keep 
making exactly $20 an hour through a down-
turn, but in inflation-adjusted terms that pay 
falls by 2 percent a year, which could make 
the factory less likely to resort to layoffs.
In that 1996 debate, another argument that 
Ms. Yellen raised against a zero percent target 
was particularly prescient. The higher the level 
of inflation, the more that central banks can 
stimulate the economy during a downturn.
Imagine that there is a severe recession and 
the Fed cuts interest rates to zero, so that when 
you put money in the bank you get no return. If 
there is no inflation, your money will retain its 
purchasing power and be worth the same when 
you withdraw it. But if there is inflation, the 
value of your money sitting in the bank becomes 
steadily less valuable, meaning that you have 
more incentive to spend or invest it.
“A little inflation permits real interest rates 
to become negative on the rare occasions when 
required to counter a recession,” Ms. Yellen 
said in 1996. “This could be important.”
She, along with her colleagues across the 
world of central banking, had no idea just 
how important.
Ms. Yellen’s argument—that some infla-
tion would help grease the economy’s wheels 
and give central banks more flexibility to 
respond to a downturn—prevailed, in the 
sense that 2 percent became the widespread 
target of global central banks.
But even as that target was embraced, 
signs started to emerge that it wasn’t high 
enough to avoid the kinds of problems that 
Ms. Yellen and others had described.
Starting in the late 1990s, Japan found itself 
stuck in a pattern of falling prices, or deflation, 
even after it cut interest rates all the way to zero. 
The United States suffered a mild recession in 
2001, and the Fed cut interest rates to 1 percent 
to help spur a recovery. Then came the global  
financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, spurring a 
steep downturn across the planet and causing 
central banks to slash interest rates.
All of this has quite a few smart econo-
mists wondering whether the central bank-
ers got the target number wrong. If they had 
set it a bit higher, perhaps at 3 or 4 percent, 
they might have been better able to combat 
the Great Recession because they could cut 
inflation-adjusted interest rates by more.
“Should policy makers therefore aim for a 
higher target inflation rate in normal times, in 
order to increase the room for monetary policy to 
react to such shocks?” asked  Olivier Blanchard, 
the chief economist of the  International Mone-
tary Fund, in a 2010 paper with two co-authors. 
“To be concrete, are the net costs of inflation 
much higher at, say, 4 percent than at 2 percent, 
the current target range?”…
Such a shift would come at a cost. At 2 per-
cent inflation, it is easy to enter into many finan-
cial transactions without really having to adjust 
for inflation. At 2 percent  inflation, the value of 
a dollar falls by half over 35 years, whereas at 
4 percent it falls in half every 18 years. On the 
other hand, inflation also hovered in the range 
of 3 to 4 percent through the mid-1980s, hardly 
 remembered as an economic nightmare.
A shift in the target, furthermore, could 
well cause disruptions in financial markets 
and potentially a sharp, sudden rise in lon-
ger-term interest rates that could slow growth.
Current central bankers view the cost of 
raising the target as too high to pay. The Fed’s 
vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, reasserted 
his support of a 2 percent target earlier this 
month. And Ms. Yellen has given no indication 
that she wishes to rethink the target. ■

PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
In addition, inflation allows for the possibility of negative real interest rates. 
Nominal interest rates can never fall below zero, because lenders can always hold 
on to their money rather than lending it out at a negative return. If inflation is 
zero, real interest rates can also never be negative. However, if inflation is posi-
tive, then a cut in nominal interest rates below the inflation rate produces nega-
tive real interest rates. Sometimes the economy may need negative real interest 
rates to provide sufficient stimulus to aggregate demand—an option ruled out by 
zero inflation.
In light of all these arguments, why should policymakers put the economy 
through a costly and inequitable disinflationary recession to achieve zero infla-
tion? Economist Alan Blinder, who was once vice chairman of the Federal  Reserve, 
argued in his book Hard Heads, Soft Hearts that policymakers should not make this 
choice:
The costs that attend the low and moderate inflation rates experienced in the 
United States and in other industrial countries appear to be quite modest—
more like a bad cold than a cancer on society. . . . As rational individuals, we 
do not volunteer for a lobotomy to cure a head cold. Yet, as a collectivity, we 
routinely prescribe the economic equivalent of lobotomy (high unemployment) 
as a cure for the inflationary cold.
Blinder concludes that it is better to learn to live with moderate inflation.

36-5 Should the Government Balance Its Budget?
A persistent macroeconomic debate concerns the government’s finances. 
Whenever the government spends more than it collects in tax revenue, it cov-
ers this budget deficit by issuing government debt. In our study of financial 
markets, we saw how budget deficits affect saving, investment, and interest 
rates. But how big a problem are budget deficits? Our next debate concerns 
whether fiscal policymakers should make balancing the government’s budget 
a high priority.
36-5a Pro: The Government Should Balance Its Budget
The U.S. federal government is far more indebted today than it was three decades 
ago. In 1980, the federal debt was $712 billion; in 2015, it was $13.1 trillion. If we 
divide today’s debt by the size of the population, we learn that each person’s 
share of the government debt is about $41,000.
The most direct effect of the government debt is to place a burden on future 
generations of taxpayers. When these debts and accumulated interest come due, 
future taxpayers will face a difficult choice. They can choose some combination 
of higher taxes and less government spending to make resources available to pay 
off the debt and accumulated interest. Or, instead, they can delay the day of reck-
oning and put the government into even deeper debt by borrowing once again to 
pay off the old debt and interest. In essence, when the government runs a budget 
deficit and issues government debt, it allows current taxpayers to pass the bill for 
some of their government spending on to future taxpayers. Inheriting such a large 
debt will lower the living standard of future generations.

803
CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
In addition to this direct effect, budget deficits have various macroeconomic 
 effects. Because budget deficits represent negative public saving, they lower 
 national saving (the sum of private and public saving). Reduced national sav-
ing causes real interest rates to rise and investment to fall. Reduced investment 
leads over time to a smaller stock of capital. A lower capital stock reduces labor 
 productivity, real wages, and the economy’s production of goods and services. 
Thus, when the government increases its debt, future generations are born into an 
economy with lower incomes as well as higher taxes.
There are, nevertheless, situations in which running a budget deficit is justi-
fiable. Throughout history, the most common cause of increased government 
debt has been war. When a military conflict raises government spending tempo-
rarily, it is reasonable to finance this extra spending by borrowing. Otherwise, 
taxes during wartime would have to rise precipitously. Such high tax rates would 
greatly distort the incentives faced by those who are taxed, leading to large dead-
weight losses. In addition, such high tax rates would be unfair to current citizens 
who are making the sacrifice of fighting the war to ensure security and freedom 
not only for themselves but also for future generations. 
Similarly, it is reasonable to allow a budget deficit during a temporary down-
turn in economic activity. When the economy goes into a recession, tax revenue 
falls automatically because the income tax and the payroll tax are levied on mea-
sures of income. If the government tried to balance its budget during a recession, 
it would have to raise taxes or cut spending at a time of high unemployment. 
Such a policy would tend to depress aggregate demand at precisely the time it 
needed to be stimulated and, therefore, would tend to increase the magnitude of 
economic fluctuations.
Yet not all budget deficits can be justified as a result of war or recession. U.S. 
government debt as a percentage of GDP increased from 26 percent in 1980 to 50 
percent in 1995. During this period, the United States experienced neither a major 
military conflict nor a major economic downturn. Yet the government consistently 
ran a sizable budget deficit, largely because the president and Congress found it 
easier to increase government spending than to increase taxes. 
The budget deficits that the U.S. government has run in recent years can, per-
haps, be rationalized by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the effects of the 
recessions in 2001 and 2008–2009. But it is imperative that this deficit not signal a 
return to the unsustainable fiscal policy of an earlier era. As the economy recovers 
from the most recent recession and unemployment returns to its natural rate, the 
government should bring spending in line with tax revenue. Compared to the 
alternative of ongoing budget deficits, a balanced budget means greater national 
saving, investment, and economic growth. It means that future college graduates 
will enter a more prosperous economy.
36-5b Con: The Government Should Not Balance Its Budget
The problem of government debt is often exaggerated. Although the government 
debt does represent a tax burden on younger generations, it is not large compared 
to the average person’s lifetime income. The debt of the U.S. federal government 
is about $41,000 per person. A person who works 40 years for $50,000 a year will 
earn $2 million over his lifetime. His share of the government debt represents 
only about 2 percent of his lifetime resources. 
Moreover, it is misleading to view the effects of budget deficits in isolation. 
The budget deficit is just one piece of a large picture of how the government 
chooses to raise and spend money. In making these decisions about fiscal policy, 
“What?!? My share of 
the  government debt is 
$41,000?”

804
PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
policymakers affect different generations of taxpayers in many ways. The govern-
ment’s budget deficit or surplus should be considered together with these other 
policies.
For example, suppose the government reduces the budget deficit by cut-
ting spending on public investments, such as education. Does this policy make 
younger generations better off? The government debt will be smaller when they 
enter the labor force, which means a smaller tax burden. Yet if they are less edu 
cated than they could be, their productivity and incomes will be lower. Many  
estimates of the return from schooling (the increase in a worker’s wage that re-
sults from an additional year in school) find that it is quite large. Reducing the 
budget deficit rather than funding more education spending could, all things con-
sidered, make future generations worse off.
Single-minded concern about the budget deficit is also dangerous because it 
draws attention away from various other policies that redistribute income across 
generations. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. federal government 
raised Social Security benefits for the elderly. It financed this higher spending 
by increasing the payroll tax on the working-age population. This policy redis-
tributed income away from younger generations toward older generations, even 
though it did not affect the government debt. Thus, the budget deficit is only a 
small part of the larger issue of how government policy affects the welfare of dif-
ferent generations.
To some extent, forward-looking parents can reverse the adverse effects of gov-
ernment debt. Parents can offset the impact simply by saving and leaving a larger 
bequest. The bequest would enhance their children’s ability to bear the burden 
of future taxes. Some economists claim that people do in fact behave this way. If 
this were true, higher private saving by parents would offset the public dissaving 
of budget deficits; as a result, deficits would not affect the economy. Most econo-
mists doubt that parents are so farsighted, but some people probably do act this 
way, and anyone could. Deficits give people the opportunity to consume at the 
expense of their children, but deficits do not require them to do so. If the govern-
ment debt were actually a great problem facing future generations, some parents 
would help to solve it.
Critics of budget deficits sometimes assert that the government debt cannot 
continue to rise forever, but in fact, it can. Just as a bank evaluating a loan appli-
cation would compare a person’s debts to his income, we should judge the bur-
den of the government debt relative to the size of the nation’s income. Population 
growth and technological progress cause the total income of the U.S. economy to 
grow over time. As a result, the nation’s ability to pay the interest on the govern-
ment debt grows over time as well. As long as the government debt grows more 
slowly than the nation’s income, there is nothing to prevent the government debt 
from growing forever.
Some numbers can put this into perspective. The real output of the U.S. econ-
omy grows on average about 3 percent per year. If the inflation rate is 2 percent 
per year, then nominal income grows at a rate of 5 percent per year. The govern-
ment debt, therefore, can rise by 5 percent per year without increasing the ratio of 
debt to income. In 2015, the federal government debt was $13.1 trillion; 5 percent 
of this figure is $655 billion. As long as the federal budget deficit is smaller than 
$655 billion, the policy is sustainable. 
To be sure, very large budget deficits cannot persist forever. From 2009 to 2012, 
the federal budget deficit was over $1 trillion every year, but this astonishing num-
ber was driven by extraordinary circumstances: a major financial crisis, a deep

economic downturn, and the policy responses to these events. No one suggests 
that a deficit of this magnitude can continue. But zero is the wrong target for fiscal 
policymakers. As long as the deficit is only moderate in size, there will never be 
a day of reckoning that forces government borrowing to end or the economy to 
collapse.

36-6 Should the Tax Laws Be Reformed to Encourage Saving?
A nation’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services. 
This was one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1. As we saw in the 
chapter on production and growth, a nation’s productive capability, in turn, is 
determined largely by how much it saves and invests for the future. Our last 
debate is whether policymakers should reform the tax laws to encourage greater 
saving and investment. 
36-6a Pro: The Tax Laws Should Be Reformed to Encourage Saving
A nation’s saving rate is a key determinant of its long-run economic prosperity. 
When the saving rate is higher, more resources are available for investment in 
new plant and equipment. A larger stock of plant and equipment, in turn, raises 
labor productivity, wages, and incomes. It is, therefore, no surprise that interna-
tional data show a strong correlation between national saving rates and measures 
of economic well-being.
Another of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people 
respond to incentives. This lesson should apply to people’s decisions about how 
much to save. If a nation’s laws make saving attractive, people will save a higher 
fraction of their incomes, and this higher saving will lead to a more prosperous 
future.
Unfortunately, the U.S. tax system discourages saving by taxing the return to 
saving quite heavily. For example, consider a 25-year-old worker who saves $1,000 
of his income to have a more comfortable retirement at the age of 70. If he buys 
a bond that pays an interest rate of 10 percent, the $1,000 will accumulate at the 
end of 45 years to $72,900 in the absence of taxes on interest. But suppose he faces 
a marginal tax rate on interest income of 40 percent, which is typical for many 
workers once federal and state income taxes are added together. In this case, his 
after-tax interest rate is only 6 percent, and the $1,000 will accumulate at the end 
of 45 years to only $13,800. That is, accumulated over this long span of time, the 
tax rate on interest income reduces the benefit of saving $1,000 from $72,900 to 
$13,800—or by about 80 percent.
The tax code further discourages saving by taxing some forms of capital in-
come twice. Suppose a person uses some of his saving to buy stock in a corpora-
tion. When the corporation earns a profit from its capital investments, it first pays 
tax on this profit in the form of the corporate income tax. If the corporation pays 
out the rest of the profit to the stockholder in the form of dividends, the stock-
holder pays tax on this income a second time in the form of the individual in-
come tax. This double taxation substantially reduces the return to the stockholder, 
thereby reducing the incentive to save.

Taxing Capital and Labor
ASK THE EXPERTS
“One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor 
income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that pol-
icymakers find hard to categorize as ‘capital’ rather than ‘labor’.”
“Despite relabeling concerns, taxing capital income at a per-
manently lower rate than labor income would result in higher 
average long-term prosperity, relative to an alternative that 
generated the same amount of tax revenue by permanently tax-
ing capital and labor income at equal rates instead.”

The tax laws again discourage saving if a person wants to 
leave his accumulated wealth to his children (or anyone else) 
rather than consuming it during his lifetime. Parents can 
bequeath some money to their children tax-free, but if the 
bequest becomes large, the estate tax rate can be as high as 
40 percent. To a large extent, concern about national saving is 
motivated by a desire to ensure economic prosperity for future 
generations. It is odd, therefore, that the tax laws discourage 
the most direct way in which one generation can help the next. 
In addition to the tax code, many other policies and insti-
tutions in our society reduce the incentive for households to 
save. Some government benefits, such as welfare and Med-
icaid, are means-tested; that is, the benefits are reduced for 
those who in the past have been prudent enough to save some 
of their income. Colleges and universities grant financial aid as 
a function of the wealth of the students and their parents. Such 
a policy is like a tax on wealth and, as such, discourages stu-
dents and parents from saving.
There are various ways in which the tax code could provide an 
incentive to save, or at least reduce the disincentive that house-
holds now face. Already the tax laws give preferential treat-
ment to some types of retirement saving. When a taxpayer puts 
income into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), for in-
stance, that income and the interest it earns are not taxed until the 
funds are withdrawn at retirement. The tax code gives a similar 
tax advantage to retirement accounts that go by other names, 
such as 401(k), 403(b), and profit-sharing plans. There are, how-
ever, limits to who is eligible to use these plans and, for those who 
are eligible, limits on the amount that can be put in them. More-
over, because there are penalties for withdrawal before retirement 
age, these retirement plans provide little incentive for other types 
of saving, such as saving to buy a house or pay for college. A small 
step to encourage greater saving would be to expand the ability of 
households to use such tax-advantaged savings accounts.
A more comprehensive approach would be to reconsider 
the entire basis by which the government collects revenue. 
The centerpiece of the U.S. tax system is the income tax. 
A dollar earned is taxed the same whether it is spent or saved. 
An alternative advocated by many economists is a consump-
tion tax. Under a consumption tax, a household pays taxes 
only on the basis of what it spends. Income that is saved is 
exempt from taxation until the saving is later withdrawn and 
spent on consumption goods. In essence, a consumption tax 
automatically puts all saving into a tax-advantaged savings 
account, much like an IRA. A switch from income to consump-
tion taxation would greatly increase the incentive to save.

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
burden fairly. The problem with proposals to increase the incentive to save is that 
they increase the tax burden on those who can least afford it.
It is undeniable that high-income households save a greater fraction of their 
income than low-income households. As a result, any tax change that favors 
people who save will also tend to favor people with high income. Policies such 
as tax-advantaged retirement accounts may seem appealing, but they lead to a 
less egalitarian society. By reducing the tax burden on the wealthy who can take 
 advantage of these accounts, they force the government to raise the tax burden 
on the poor. 
Moreover, tax policies designed to encourage saving may not be effective at 
achieving that goal. Economic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether 
a higher rate of return would increase saving. The outcome  depends on the relative 
size of two conflicting forces, called the substitution effect and the income effect. On 
the one hand, a higher rate of return raises the benefit of saving: Each dollar saved 
today produces more consumption in the future. This substitution effect tends to  
increase saving. On the other hand, a higher rate of return lowers the need for saving: 
A household has to save less to achieve any target level of consumption in the 
future. This income effect tends to reduce saving. If the substitution and income 
effects approximately cancel each other, as some studies suggest, then saving will 
not change when lower taxation of capital income raises the rate of return.
There are ways to increase national saving other than by giving tax breaks to 
the rich. National saving is the sum of private and public saving. Instead of trying 
to alter the tax code to  encourage greater private saving, policymakers can simply 
raise public saving by reducing the budget deficit, perhaps by raising taxes on the 
wealthy. This offers a direct way of raising national saving and increasing prosper-
ity for future generations.
Indeed, once public saving is taken into account, tax provisions to encourage 
saving might backfire. Tax changes that reduce the taxation of capital income 
reduce government revenue and, thereby, lead to a larger budget deficit. To 
increase national saving, such a change in the tax code must stimulate private 
saving by more than the decline in public saving. If this is not the case, so-called 
saving incentives can potentially make matters worse.

36-7 Conclusion
This chapter has considered six classic debates over macroeconomic policy. For 
each, it began with a controversial proposition and then offered the arguments pro 
and con. If you find it hard to choose a side in these debates, you may find some 
comfort in the fact that you are not alone. The study of economics does not always 
make it easy to choose among alternative policies. Indeed, by clarifying the inevi-
table trade-offs that policymakers face, it can make the choice more difficult. 
Difficult choices, however, have no right to seem easy. When you hear politi-
cians or commentators proposing something that sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is. If they sound like they are offering you a free lunch, you should look 
for the hidden price tag. Few if any policies come with benefits but no costs. By 
helping you see through the fog of rhetoric so common in political discourse, the 
study of economics should make you a better participant in our national debates.

PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
CHAPTER QuickQuiz
1. Approximately how long does it take a change in mon-
etary policy to influence aggregate demand?
a. 1 month
b. 6 months
c. 2 years
d. 5 years
2. According to traditional Keynesian analysis, which 
of the following will increase aggregate demand the 
most?
a. $100 billion increase in taxation
b. $100 billion decrease in taxation
c. $100 billion increase in government spending
d. $100 billion decrease in government spending
3. Advocates for setting monetary policy by rule rather 
than discretion often argue that
a. central bankers with discretion are tempted to 
renege on their announced commitments to low 
inflation.
b. central bankers following a rule will be more re-
sponsive to the needs of the political process.
c. fiscal policy is a much better tool for economic 
stabilization than is monetary policy.
d. it is sometimes useful to give the economy a burst 
of surprise inflation.
4. Which of the following is NOT an argument for main-
taining a positive rate of inflation?
a. It permits real interest rates to be negative.
b. It allows real wages to fall without cuts in nominal 
wages.
c. It increases the variability of relative prices.
d. It would be costly to reduce inflation to zero.
5. Throughout U.S. history, what has been the most 
common cause of substantial increases in government 
debt?
a. recessions
b. wars
c. financial crises
d. tax cuts
6. Advocates of taxing consumption rather than income 
argue that
a. a consumption tax is a better automatic  
stabilizer. 
b. taxing consumption does not cause any dead-
weight losses.
c. the rich consume a higher fraction of income than 
the poor.
d. the current tax code discourages people from 
saving.
• Advocates of active monetary and fiscal policies 
view the economy as inherently unstable and believe 
that policy can manage aggregate demand to offset 
the inherent instability. Critics of active monetary 
and fiscal policies emphasize that policy affects the 
economy with a lag and that our ability to forecast  
future economic conditions is poor. As a result,  
attempts to stabilize the economy can end up being 
destabilizing.
• Advocates of increased government spending to 
fight recessions argue that because tax cuts may 
be saved rather than spent, direct government  
spending does more to increase aggregate 
demand, which is key to promoting production 
and employment. Critics of spending hikes argue 
that tax cuts can expand both  aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply and that hasty increases in 
government spending may lead to wasteful public  
projects. 
• Advocates of rules for monetary policy argue that dis-
cretionary policy can suffer from incompetence, the 
abuse of power, and time inconsistency. Critics of rules 
for monetary policy argue that discretionary policy 
is more flexible in responding to changing economic 
circumstances.
• Advocates of a zero-inflation target emphasize 
that inflation has many costs and few if any bene-
fits. Moreover, the cost of eliminating inflation— 
depressed output and employment—is only 
temporary. Even this cost can be reduced if the 
central bank announces a credible plan to reduce 
inflation, thereby directly lowering expectations of 
inflation. Critics of a zero- inflation target claim that 
moderate inflation imposes only small costs on soci-
ety, whereas the recession necessary to reduce infla-
tion is quite costly. The critics also point out several 
ways in which moderate inflation may be helpful to 
an economy.

SUMMARY

CHAPTER 36   SIX DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW
1. What causes the lags in the effect of monetary and fis-
cal policies on aggregate demand? What are the impli-
cations of these lags for the debate over active versus 
passive policy?
2. According to traditional Keynesian analysis, why does 
a tax cut have a smaller effect on GDP than a similarly 
sized increase in government spending? Why might 
the opposite be the case? 
3. What might motivate a central banker to cause a  
political business cycle? What does the political busi-
ness cycle imply for the debate over policy rules?
4. Explain how credibility might affect the cost of reduc-
ing inflation.
5. Why are some economists against a target of zero 
inflation?
6. Explain two ways in which a government budget defi-
cit hurts a future worker.
7. What are two situations in which most economists 
view a budget deficit as justifiable?
8. Some economists say that the government can con-
tinue running a budget deficit forever. How is that 
possible?
9. Some income from capital is taxed twice. Explain.
10. What adverse effect might be caused by tax incentives 
to increase saving?
• Advocates of a balanced government budget argue 
that budget deficits impose an unjustifiable burden 
on future generations by raising their taxes and low-
ering their incomes. Critics of a balanced government 
budget argue that the deficit is only one small piece of 
fiscal policy. Single-minded concern about the budget 
deficit can obscure the many ways in which policy, in-
cluding various spending programs, affects different 
generations.
• Advocates of tax incentives for saving point out that 
our society discourages saving in many ways, such 
as by heavily taxing capital income and by reducing 
benefits for those who have accumulated wealth. 
They endorse reforming the tax laws to encourage 
saving, perhaps by switching from an income tax 
to a consumption tax. Critics of tax incentives for 
saving argue that many proposed changes to stim-
ulate saving would primarily benefit the wealthy, 
who do not need a tax break. They also argue that 
such changes might have only a small effect on pri-
vate saving. Raising public saving by decreasing 
the government’s budget deficit would provide a 
more direct and equitable way to increase national 
saving.
1. The chapter suggests that the economy, like the 
 human body, has “natural restorative powers.”
a. Illustrate the short-run effect of a fall in aggregate 
demand using an aggregate-demand/ aggregate-
supply diagram. What happens to total  output, 
income, and employment?
b. If the government does not use stabilization policy, 
what happens to the economy over time?  Illustrate 
this adjustment on your diagram. Does it generally 
occur in a matter of months or a  matter of years?
c. Do you think the “natural restorative powers” of 
the economy mean that policymakers should be 
passive in response to the business cycle?
2. Policymakers who want to stabilize the economy 
must decide how much to change the money supply, 
government spending, or taxes. Why is it difficult for 
policymakers to choose the appropriate strength of 
their actions?
3. The problem of time inconsistency applies to fiscal 
policy as well as to monetary policy. Suppose the 
 government announced a reduction in taxes on 
 income from capital investments, like new factories.
a. If investors believed that capital taxes would 
remain low, how would the government’s action 
affect the level of investment?

PART XIII   FINAL THOUGHTS
b. After investors have responded to the announced 
tax reduction, does the government have an 
 incentive to renege on its policy? Explain.
c. Given your answer to part b, would investors 
 believe the government’s announcement? What 
can the government do to increase the credibility 
of announced policy changes?
d. Explain why this situation is similar to the 
time-inconsistency problem faced by monetary 
policymakers.
4. Chapter 2 explains the difference between positive 
analysis and normative analysis. In the debate 
about whether the central bank should aim for 
zero inflation, which areas of disagreement involve 
positive statements and which involve normative 
judgments?
5. Why are the benefits of reducing inflation permanent 
and the costs temporary? Why are the costs of  
increasing inflation permanent and the benefits tem-
porary? Use Phillips-curve diagrams in your answer. 
6. Suppose the federal government cuts taxes and 
 increases spending, raising the budget deficit to  
12 percent of GDP. If nominal GDP is rising 5 percent 
per year, are such budget deficits sustainable forever? 
Explain. If budget deficits of this size are maintained 
for 20 years, what is likely to happen to your taxes 
and your children’s taxes in the future? Can you 
personally do something today to offset this future 
effect?
7. Explain how each of the following policies redistrib-
utes income across generations. Is the redistribution 
from young to old or from old to young?
a. an increase in the budget deficit
b. more generous subsidies for education loans
c. greater investments in highways and bridges
d. an increase in Social Security benefits
8. What is the fundamental trade-off that society faces if 
it chooses to save more? How might the government 
increase national saving?
