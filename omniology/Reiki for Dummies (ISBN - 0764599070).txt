About the Author
Nina L. Paul, PhD, has worked in the field of science and health communica-
tion for over 20 years. She started down this path at SUNY Purchase, where
she received her bachelor’s degree in biology and performed research in the
field of neuroimmunology. She also published articles for her college news-
paper on scientific research topics.
After working in medical publishing at Rockefeller University Press (Journal of
Clinical Investigation), she received her master’s degree and PhD in infectious

University.
After leaving Yale, Nina pursued postdoctoral research in London and Oxford,
England. Nina’s research focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

Nina believes in a multifaceted approach to health. She became a master of
Reiki, which is a universal life-force energy that is transmitted through the
hands. She is both a practitioner and a teacher of Reiki and uses Reiki as a way
to help herself and others. Check out Nina’s Web site at www.ninapaul.info.

Center in Truth or Consequences (T or C), New Mexico and still provides
Reiki training and healing to many; Rose Kennedy and Jane Alderson who
were my first Reiki teachers.
In Oregon: Kathleen McKevitt on the Oregon coast taught me about master-
ing Reiki.
In New York: Kathie Lipinski, with whom I learned to teach Reiki and pass
attunements to others.

he touch of a hand is increasingly recognized as being important and also
absent in much of modern medicine. Reiki as an alternative and comple-
mentary therapy provides the soothing comfort of human touch. This can
make a world of difference to someone in pain. Reiki is the energy of love that
never ends. You can experience the bliss of Reiki as a recipient and receive
healing that is channeled through another. Or you can learn Reiki yourself to
boost your personal growth and enlightenment.
Reiki has gained in popularity as more people seek solutions to personal and
global problems. You might have tried meditation and yoga or even massage.
Reiki is a natural partner to these and other healing practices. The person 
to thank for the Reiki healing system is a Japanese man named Mikao Usui
(1865–1926). He developed the original Reiki system that has blossomed into
a multitude of worldwide branches. What is common to all Reiki systems is
the channeling of the Reiki life-force energy.
Reiki comes from a higher source — call it God, higher power, creator, or
spirit. A series of simple initiations turns on your Reiki “light switch,” which
gives you the lifelong ability to channel Reiki energy. The benefit you get from
Reiki and how much you can help others depend on how often and with what
intent you use Reiki. The more you use Reiki, the more you get out of it.
Reiki connects you with the ultimate source of healing at all levels. If you
desire peace, consciousness, healing, or enlightenment, then Reiki is for you.
About This Book
Reiki may not seem like a down-to-earth subject, but this is a down-to-earth
book about Reiki. The open-access style of the For Dummies series makes this
comprehensive book on Reiki pleasant to navigate and use.
Reading this book doesn’t make you a Reiki practitioner, but you can use this
book as a reference and guide as you use Reiki in your own life and to help
others.

Offering a worldwide perspective
Reiki is practiced all over the globe, and the Reiki techniques presented in this
book include those commonly used from both Western and Japanese lineages.
Many classes and sessions today incorporate techniques from both types 
of Reiki. Japanese Reiki is becoming more popular as previously unknown
Japanese practitioners present their version of Reiki in Japan, and in the West.
So both Western and Japanese Reiki classes are taught worldwide.
The most well-known Reiki lineage passed from Mikao Usui to Chujiro Hayashi
to Hawayo Takata of Hawaii. The students of Takata then taught more students,
who became the major source of so-called Western Reiki. My Reiki teachers
came from this initial lineage.
I include a discussion of chakra-energy systems even though these weren’t
part of Usui’s original teaching. I think this information helps you to see how
the Reiki energy system fits into other energy systems that are used today.
Illustrating symbols and positions
You find the four basic Reiki symbols and some additional nontraditional
Reiki symbols illustrated in this book. This information was previously con-
sidered secret — to be revealed only after paying a teacher. More and more
authors of Reiki material choose to include this information and make the
distinction between sacred and secret. The Reiki symbols are sacred. I hope
that you take the information on the symbols along with other information in
this book in the manner in which it is offered: with deep respect for the
people who have come before me, and those who come after me in Reiki.
You find ample illustrations of not only the Reiki symbols but also the Reiki
hand positions (for treating yourself or treating another).
If you find a discrepancy between a symbol or illustrations here and what you
are taught, I suggest you follow the guidance of your Reiki teacher.
Examining personal stories
Reiki is miraculous in that it can help you transform illness or difficulties in
your life. But the exact nature of the miracles that Reiki provides differs from
person to person. Reiki may help one person recover from cancer, and
another may reach a place of peace and die. One person may find that his
marriage is rejuvenated, and another may decide to live apart from his mate.

Reiki For Dummies 

Because of the individuality of the response to Reiki, I don’t include Reiki mir-
acle stories. What may work in one way for you will work in a different way
for someone else. I don’t want you to read that one woman overcame her
infertility with Reiki and think it will work for you that way too. Instead, maybe
you’re meant to adopt a child who is waiting for you somewhere. You get the
picture? Reiki will bring you to your highest outcome, whatever that might be.
In terms of my own story, Reiki is a major tool that helps me in every single
area. But this book is not about me; like Reiki, this book is coming through
me. I add my personal experience where I think it can help the reader in his
life. I also include a few other personal stories, in sidebars, to give you a
sense of the variety of responses to Reiki.
Conventions Used in This Book
Different Reiki practitioners use different terminology to cover the topics of
Reiki, and here are the terms I’ve chosen to use in this book:
 The person who receives Reiki is called the Reiki recipient.
 The person who gives Reiki is called the Reiki practitioner.
 Higher power, God, or Universal Energy is called spirit.
 Because a Reiki recipient or practitioner can be male or female, I use
both the he and she pronouns throughout the text.
You’ll also notice some changes in text font to get your attention:
 The first time I define a term in the chapter, I italicize the word.
 I use boldface to emphasize action steps.
 When I list Web addresses, I use monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
Go ahead and read the chapters that interest you. Or, if you’re using this
book for a Reiki class, read the chapters your teacher recommends. What
you do with the other chapters is your own business. What’s nice is that you
have the information on your bookshelf when you need it.
3
Introduction

Also, note that the information presented in sidebars is incidental to the main
chapter and you can skip them if you want.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you, the reader of this book, fall into at least one of the follow-
ing categories:
 You’re curious to find out more about Reiki.
 You’re considering trying Reiki for yourself or a family member.
 You’re looking into taking Reiki classes.
 You want a book to guide you through classes and the beginning of your
Reiki practice.
You might be one of the following:
 A skeptic who is open minded: “I’ll reserve final judgment until I’ve read
the book or tried it out.”
 A newbie to Reiki: “I want to know more about Reiki. Bring it on.”
 A New-Age aficionado: “I’m open to just about anything. I want to add
Reiki to the techniques I already use.”
I’m assuming that you also may be saying, “I’m smart, but I really don’t know
much about this subject and don’t want to spend too much effort getting the
information I need to know.” In order for you to get this most from this book,
I’d like to assume that you’re doing the following:
 Keeping an open mind to the possibility that Reiki can help you
 Seeing whatever concept you have of God, higher power, universal
energy, or spirit as the source of Reiki energy
 Using Reiki to build upon and supplement your own personal growth
and healing practices
 Being ready to make some changes in your life and let Reiki help you 
do that
 Taking what you like from the book (and Reiki) and leaving the rest
Reiki can work for everyone, even someone who doesn’t believe in it. The
only person for whom Reiki doesn’t work is the person who doesn’t want
Reiki. And that’s okay, if that’s you. Come back if you change your mind.

How This Book Is Organized
Reiki information is separated into the following parts so you can easily find
what you need.
Part I: Discovering Reiki
I provide Reiki basics and background information in this section. The system
of Reiki is traced from Mikao Usui’s founding of Reiki in Japan to developing
Reiki branches all over the world. Though Reiki is an “energy medicine” with
similarities to other systems, Reiki has distinctive features that separate it
from other energy-healing techniques. The Reiki principles, which were delin-
eated by Usui, are another common feature of all Reiki branches, and they
have their own chapter in this part.
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself
To experience Reiki is to know a feeling of bliss. Everyone deserves this feel-
ing of absolute harmony, which will keep you coming back for more. Anyone
in your family can use Reiki at any age for any cause. Even your pets will
appreciate a Reiki treatment to help them with an illness or just as a general
energy boost. In this part, find out what a Reiki session feels like and what
you can expect. Hint: Expect the unexpected!
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki
Going farther with Reiki means taking Reiki classes, and I explain the many
varieties in this part. I include information about the Reiki symbols (2nd-
degree Reiki and beyond), techniques to channel and use the Reiki energy 
to help others, and methods to give yourself Reiki. As a fun addition to this
part, I include information on adding crystals to a Reiki practice.
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others
When you have your Reiki practice under your belt, you’ll want to contribute
to the well-being of others on either a volunteer or professional basis. This
part describes how to structure a Reiki session and start using Reiki profes-
sionally. You may want to join or start your own Reiki shares or circles or
5
Introduction

bring Reiki to your local hospital. Reiki has the ability to pass through time
and space, so you find out how to use Reiki to heal events all over the world,
and even in the past or future. Reiki is a natural companion to many thera-
peutic treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, massage, psy-
chotherapy, and chiropractic work, so practitioners from these other
therapies can find ways to use Reiki to help their patients and clients.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This traditional part of the Dummies series lists information in accessible
lists of ten. You find uses for Reiki in everyday life, tips to apply Reiki for per-
sonal growth, a list of Reiki myths, and ten extra nontraditional Reiki-inspired
symbols.
After the Part of Tens, I provide an appendix of Web sites, books, and other
contact information to help you go farther with Reiki. That same appendix
includes the International Association of Reiki Professionals Code of Ethics.
After the appendix is a glossary of Reiki terms in one convenient place.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the little drawings in the margins of the book that are designed to
draw your attention to certain topics. They serve as guides to the type of
information being provided.
I use this icon to accentuate information that is most important to a particu-
lar topic. The remember icon highlights the take-home information.
I don’t use this icon often, but if you see it, you know that I’m giving you
some nonessential information. You don’t have to read it, but of course, if
you’re hungry for everything there is to know about Reiki, feel free to savor
every word.
The Tip icon flags especially useful, practical information that can enhance
your Reiki experience or practice.
6
Reiki For Dummies 

Reiki doesn’t involve any danger, so warnings are very few in this book. But if
you see this icon, you should pay particular attention to the instructions to
avoid harming yourself or others.
Where to Go from Here
The beauty of this book, like all For Dummies books, is that you can start
reading any place you like. You can flip through the pages and see what page
opens up first, or you can scan the Table of Contents for chapters of interest.
You can always read from Chapter 1 and continue onward, though I don’t
assume you’ll read every single chapter or that you’ll read the chapters in
order. If you’re totally new to Reiki, I suggest Chapter 1 for an overview of
Reiki. Then you may want to jump to Chapters 5 and 6 to see what Reiki can
do for you. I wish you a bountiful healing journey with Reiki!

Reiki For Dummies 

Part I
Discovering Reiki

In this part . . .
R
eiki is a natural and simple way to achieve healing at
all levels: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
Reiki is a Japanese word for “spiritual energy,” and the
system of Reiki has evolved since it was founded by Mikao
Usui in Japan. As Reiki has evolved through changes made
by different Reiki masters, it still retains its essence: to
provide healing to all who seek it.
This part includes basic information on what Reiki is and
what it is not. You also find out about the founders of
Reiki. In addition, I explain the five underlying principles
of Reiki and how this energy system compares and con-
trasts with other types of energy healing.

Chapter 1
Reiki: The Art of Channeling 
Life-Force Energy
In This Chapter
 Getting a basic idea of what Reiki is — and isn’t
 Finding out about Reiki’s spiritual foundations
 Looking at Reiki as energy
 Discovering the origins of Reiki
 Seeing ways to experience Reiki
 Selecting a practitioner or teacher
 Listing the benefits of Reiki
 Revealing the symbols
 Merging New Age with Reiki
You are deeply relaxed while lying on the Reiki table, as the practitioner
lays her hands on different parts of your body. Impressed that this
gentle laying on of hands can bring you such peace and joy, you want to know
more about it. You’ve come to the right place, because this book is a guide to
the basic practice of Reiki.
In this book, I describe how to use Reiki to heal yourself and your family
members, and even treat people who are far away. Reiki techniques can also
be used for your pets, your food, and the earth. The more you use Reiki, the
more uses you’ll find for it. In this chapter, you’ll find out how Reiki works,
where Reiki comes from, and what help Reiki can give you. You can even dis-
cover how to channel the Reiki energy yourself so that you have a lifelong
tool to use for yourself and others.
In this chapter you get a taste of what Reiki is all about!

Discovering What Reiki Is and Isn’t
Reiki is popping up all over the place, but lots of folks are still confused about
what Reiki is exactly. In the context used in this book, Reiki is both:
 A healing system that channels universal life-force energy: This
system was originally developed by Mikao Usui in the early 1900s in
Japan. For more on Reiki’s beginning, see “Exploring the History of
Reiki,” later in this chapter, and also Chapter 3.
 The name of the energy itself: Rei means spiritual wisdom, and ki
means energy, so Reiki means spiritual energy. See Figure 1-1, which
illustrates the word Reiki in Japanese characters.
Some people use the word Reiki as a verb, as in “I will Reiki him.” What they
are saying is, “I will give Reiki to him.”
Reiki is available to everyone. Anyone of any age or illness level can receive
Reiki. Even newborn babies or people at the end of life can benefit from the
relaxation that Reiki provides. See Chapter 6 to find out how every member
of your family, including your pets, can use and benefit from Reiki.
What Reiki is
In short, Reiki gives you what you need, whether it’s a release of tension or
an energy boost, or both. To help you more fully understand what Reiki gives
you, here are some terms used to describe Reiki:
 Gentle: Reiki’s touch is soft and light.
 Harmless: Reiki can have only positive results.
 Natural: You don’t need any equipment or tools.
 Healing: The highest level of healing is the goal of Reiki.
 Balancing: Reiki will balance your energy levels.
 Relaxing: The top reason to try Reiki is to feel the bliss of deep 
relaxation.
 Energizing: If you’re drained of energy, Reiki will revive you.
12
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

What Reiki isn’t
Knowing what Reiki isn’t is as important as knowing what it is:
 Reiki is not religious. Reiki is totally nondenominational. You can prac-
tice any religion (or none) and still use and benefit from Reiki. Founder
Mikao Usui was influenced by the religions of his country, Shintoism and
Figure 1-1:
The
Japanese
characters
for Reiki.
13
Chapter 1: Reiki: The Art of Channeling Life-Force Energy

Buddhism. But Reiki isn’t associated with any religion, and people of all
faiths and beliefs are Reiki practitioners. Reiki isn’t New Age either (see
the section “Combining New Age and Reiki,” later in this chapter).
 Reiki is not massage or reflexology. Reiki is an energy-healing system
and not a manipulative system (hands moving the body). Reiki is dis-
tinct from reflexology and massage. But Reiki is sometimes confused
with other hands-on healing arts, especially reflexology. I’m not sure
why; maybe it’s because they both begin with the letter r.
Understanding the Spiritual 
Foundation of Reiki
Okay, I know in the previous section I say that Reiki isn’t a religion, but it is
spiritual. The distinction between spirituality and religion has caused a lot of
confusion with regard to Reiki. These concepts are overlapping but separate.
Here’s what I mean:
Spirituality is the belief in your connection with the divine, no matter whether
you call it a higher power, God, spirit, soul, or even the stars. The purpose of
spiritual development is to improve this connection and see the divinity
within yourself and all around you.
Religion provides guidance on how to develop yourself spiritually. It tells you
what the divine looks like and gives you frameworks of texts, places of wor-
ship, and guides to support you.
You can be part of a religion and not have a spiritual connection. You can
have a spiritual connection and not belong to a religion.
Reiki provides a means for spiritual growth. No matter what your religious
background, you’ll find that the principles are relevant and don’t conflict with
your religious practice. In fact, Reiki should enhance your personal religious
connection. The spiritual aspects of Reiki enable you to do the following:
 Connect to a higher source: You use prayer and meditation to connect
to God or the higher power of your own beliefs. Spiritual connection pro-
vides the never-ending supply of Reiki energy.
 Channel the higher energy: Reiki healing energy is not from the practi-
tioner but comes through the practitioner from God or another higher
power.
14
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

 Keep spiritually healthy: Just as you maintain your physical health with
nutritious food, fresh air, and exercise, you also need to maintain your
spiritual health. Prayer, meditation, quiet times, and spiritual exercise
(doing kind acts) can help in this regard. Reiki uses the following spiri-
tual tools: Reiki principles, meditation (see Chapter 9), and symbols and
chanting (see Chapter 8).
Examining the Energy of Reiki
Reiki is a system of energy healing. You don’t actually need to understand
how the energy of the body works in order to use or benefit from Reiki, but 
it helps to know the basis for the way that Reiki works, which is examined in
the following sections.
Defining universal energy
As a child, did you ever gaze at the stars with wonder and awe? The sun, 
the moon, the stars, and all the different life forms on our planet radiate an
energy that is called a universal energy. Because this is the energy that ani-
mates humans and other living beings, it’s called the universal life-force
energy. This energy is known by different names. You can call it universal life-
force energy, love, God, or spirit. For consistency throughout the book, I use
the term spirit.
Reiki is a system that allows you to tap into and benefit from this universal
energy.
Detecting subtle energy
When I talk about subtle energy, I am referring to the energy of Reiki and 
also the energy fields that are associated with your body. When something 
is subtle, it doesn’t necessarily scream its presence, so you must get quiet 
to feel its presence. (In Chapter 2, I describe other types of subtle energy 
systems.)
Meditation is frequently used during Reiki training and before giving Reiki 
so you can get quiet enough to sense the presence of the Reiki energy (see
Chapter 9).
15
Chapter 1: Reiki: The Art of Channeling Life-Force Energy

The energy field surrounding the human body is also called an aura, and it
can be sensed with the hands, visualized with the eyes (with some practice),
and photographed with special techniques (see Chapter 2).
Scientific instruments have been developed that can detect these subtle ener-
gies, which are also called biomagnetic forces. Some studies can even detect
the subtle energy coming off an energy practitioner’s hands (see Chapter 2).
When you receive a Reiki session, the energy may not feel subtle at all as you
feel the heat from the Reiki practitioner’s hands and perhaps waves rushing
through your body. Each person senses the Reiki energy differently, and with
time, your sensations will change. After you’re attuned (initiated) into Reiki
energy yourself, you may feel Reiki more keenly. And the Reiki practitioner
might sense the emanations of life-force energy from the Reiki recipient.
Certain Reiki techniques utilize the ability to sense energy (see Chapter 10).
But don’t worry; you can still practice Reiki with the standard hand positions
even if you don’t sense anything.
16
Part I: Discovering Reiki 
Universal Reiki — with humor and humanity
One of my Reiki teachers wanted me to empha-
size here that Reiki is practiced all the world
over and that he thought there should be more
humor with Reiki. On that note, he provided the
following stories:
“My Italian barber wanted me to give him Reiki
for his sore shoulder, which fortunately hadn’t led
to lopsided haircuts but, on the other hand,
wasn’t helping his singing any. Appreciative of
Reiki help, he nevertheless wondered why we
didn’t do it like his grandmother (a contemporary
of Mikao Usui; see Chapter 3), who had learned
it from her grandmother. On invited demonstra-
tion, he moved his hands faster than most Reiki
practitioners usually do, but the same good feel-
ing was there, with a flavor of Italian sunshine.”
“Charlie, a Native American Reiki student, gently
advised me one day that in his tribe what we
called Reiki was a way of life and part of the cul-
ture he grew up with — no special training or
certificates needed. Soon after, sorrowfully, we
gave Charlie a farewell Reiki session, his coura-
geous fight against terminal illness having run its
course. Yet, he appeared two weeks later at Reiki
circle, barely standing, and without prearrange-
ment, we all bowed to him as he entered, much
as we would have done to Mikao Usui. Charlie
then showed us one final, powerful ‘Reiki’ treat-
ment, Native American-style, hands moving
above the body, accompanied by a high-voiced
Indian chanting that made my hair stand on end
and my heart leap. Charlie died two weeks later,
but his special message will not be forgotten.
With Reiki, we are all connected; the world is
one.”

Even if you don’t feel Reiki energy, it still works.
Understanding how Reiki works
As an energy-healing system, Reiki works to heal you at the level of your
energy to the root of any disease, imbalance, or disharmony.
Though looking at the energy fields emitted by the body is becoming more
popular now with the advent of alternative medicine and New Age philoso-
phies, energy healing is actually quite ancient. Traditional Chinese medicine,
Ayurvedic medicine, and other cultures have identified and classified this
energy that runs throughout the body (see Chapter 2 for a discussion of
chakras and meridians).
As a healing energy, Reiki is considered to be positive (no harm can come
from Reiki) and intelligent (the energy heals what is needed even if you don’t
consciously know what you need). The recipient draws the right amount of
energy to just the place where it’s needed. Frequently a practitioner will feel
her hands “drawn” like a magnet to a certain place. In this way, the practi-
tioner is the channel of the universal life-force energy.
Distinguishing Reiki from other 
forms of energy healing
Energy healing is part of many different cultures. Whether it be acupuncture
or the laying on of hands, the use of energy to treat illness is part of human
history. See the sidebar “Universal Reiki — with humor and humanity,” in this
chapter.
Reiki offers a way to achieve spiritual and personal growth and also to heal
others. But Reiki is not the only system with these goals. Two systems that
are commonly confused with Reiki are:
 Johrei: The founder of Johrei, Mokichi Okada, was a contemporary of
Mikao Usui (founder of Reiki) in Japan. The Johrei spiritual movement
encompasses more than hands-on spiritual healing and advocates indi-
vidual spiritual development so that everyone can reach “paradise on
earth.” Visit the Web site www.johrei.com for more information.
17
Chapter 1: Reiki: The Art of Channeling Life-Force Energy

 Therapeutic touch: In 1972, Dr. Dolores Krieger, RN, and Dora Kunz
developed the healing system called therapeutic touch. This energy-
healing system involves similar features to Reiki and is taught as a 12-
hour workshop. Therapeutic touch requires compassion and desire 
to develop experience through practice and focus. Therapeutic 
touch is commonly practiced within the nursing profession. See
www.therapeutic-touch.org/ for more information.
Here are other types of energy healing:
 Acupuncture
 Polarity therapy
 Pranic healing
 Prayer
 Qigong
Reiki is distinct from these other practices through its use of symbols (see
Chapter 8) and the attunement process (see Chapter 7).
Exploring the History of Reiki
I want to clarify some misconceptions about the history of Reiki. Even though
other hands-on, spiritual, and energy-healing methods have ancient origins,
the practice of Reiki is from 20th century Japan. Mikao Usui was born in 1865,
and he taught Reiki in the early 1900s onward. He claimed that his system
was unique.
Beware of old or false information, which is still present in older books or
Web sites. New information has come in the last few years from Reiki histori-
ans who have visited Japan and interviewed Japanese Reiki practitioners and
found Mikao Usui’s memorial stone (see Chapter 3 for details about Reiki his-
tory and Chapter 20, which deals with Reiki myths).
When Mikao Usui first developed his system for spiritual healing, he called it
Usui Reiki Ryoho, which means the Usui method for spiritual healing. As this
system was passed on and taught in the West, the name of the system was
called simply Reiki. Reiki has exploded into different branches, with varia-
tions on Usui’s original system. I cover the background of Reiki in Japan and
18
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

the evolution into Western forms in Chapter 3. I also describe different Reiki
branches (Western and Japanese) and the concept of lineage in Reiki.
When you study Reiki, you can trace your lineage back to Mikao Usui through
the listing of teachers. Lineage is discussed in more depth in Chapter 3.
The common element of all schools or branches of Reiki is the ability to chan-
nel universal life-force energy.
Getting Connected with Reiki
Reiki allows you to feel deeply relaxed, calm, and peaceful. The gentle touch
of the practitioner’s hands serves to transmit the higher-level healing energy
to you. Anyone of any age, religion, or health status can benefit from Reiki.
You can experience Reiki from the perspective of a recipient or receiver of
Reiki by booking Reiki sessions with a qualified practitioner. Or you can
decide to become initiated into Reiki and begin your Reiki studies. This sec-
tion briefly discusses both experiences.
19
Chapter 1: Reiki: The Art of Channeling Life-Force Energy
Where Reiki can take you
If you’re really ready to grow, really ready to
change, and really ready to heal, Reiki can aid
your progress toward wholeness. Reiki opens
you up to receive the blessings of the universal
life-force energy.
You may find yourself growing in ways you never
imagined. Or rather, you may find yourself return-
ing to a place of peace, feeling of love, sense of
calm, and purpose of being that you forgot you
ever had.
You will make some changes in your life. They
may be small subtle changes, like being nice to
a co-worker or letting a car pass you on the
highway. You may change how you eat or what
you wear.
You’ll notice coincidences popping up. People
show up to help you, or situations change just
when you need them. You’re more in the flow of
the universe (from receiving the universal life-
force energy) or at least more aware of the flow.
You trust that life will be okay, that you will be
okay, and that Reiki can help you. As you con-
tinue your life’s journey, you know that you can
always use Reiki, on a daily basis, especially as
life takes its twists and turns.
Reiki takes you to a safe place, Reiki takes you
to your truth, and Reiki takes you home.

Trying a Reiki session
Experiencing a first Reiki session is the point of entry for most folks to either
deciding to use Reiki regularly or to go farther and find out how to give a
Reiki session.
I list the ways that Reiki can help your entire family in Chapter 6. To find out
exactly what you can expect from a Reiki session, look at Chapter 5.
Becoming initiated into Reiki’s uses
Utilizing Reiki is as simple to learn as 1-2-3 — the three different levels of
Reiki training.
 First-degree Reiki: This 1st-level class starts your Reiki flow. You find
out about Reiki history and how to use Reiki to heal yourself. I cover
self-healing with Reiki in Chapter 11.
 Second-degree Reiki: One step up from the 1st degree you find out 
how to use three Reiki symbols and send Reiki long distance. After this
degree, you can become a Reiki practitioner. Chapter 13 describes how
to give a Reiki session, and Chapter 15 covers long-distance Reiki.
 Third-degree Reiki: This level is frequently divided into two parts, with
the first focusing on the fourth Reiki symbol and learning Master’s level
techniques. The last level covers how to teach Reiki to others.
Chapter 7 gives you the lowdown on Reiki training: which classes you should
take, what you will learn, and how to prepare for your attunements.
When you study Reiki, you find out the following:
 The history of Reiki
 The basics of energy healing
 How to use Reiki to heal yourself and others
 How to use a set of symbols that connect to the Reiki energy (see
Chapter 8)
 How to teach Reiki to others
20
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

You also receive one or more attunements. An attunement is an initiation
process whereby your ability to channel the Reiki energy is activated.
Choosing a Reiki Practitioner or Master
You may be looking for someone to give you a treatment or someone to teach
you Reiki. Here are two ways Reiki professionals identify themselves:
 A Reiki practitioner (RP) is someone who practices Reiki. This means
the person has studied at least the 2nd level of Reiki and has learned to
give Reiki treatments to others.
 A Reiki Master (RM) is a person who has completed the Master level
of Reiki. The Reiki Master may also be a Reiki Master Teacher (RMT), in
which case the person can also teach Reiki.
Note that a Reiki Master is also a Reiki practitioner.
To receive a Reiki session, you may be treated by someone who is either a
Reiki practitioner or a Reiki Master. If you want to find out how to use Reiki
(see the section “Becoming initiated into Reiki’s uses,” earlier in this chap-
ter), you need to find a Reiki Master Teacher.
To find a practitioner or teacher who is a good match for you, consider the
questions I pose in Chapters 5 and 7. Because this person will be transmitting
Reiki energy to you, which is a sacred process, you want to find someone you
can trust. You can often find such a person through a friend’s recommenda-
tion or through following your own instincts about someone you have a good
feeling about.
Experiencing the Benefits of Reiki
Each of you has different reasons for wanting to learn about Reiki right now.
What you might need from Reiki today may change next week or next year.
But whatever your reasons for needing Reiki, know that Reiki always provides
help in a safe and natural way.

Healing a physical illness
If you or a family member is suffering with a physical illness, Reiki can help
you by providing deep relaxation. Reiki helps you in the following ways when
you’re in pain or dealing with illness:
 Gives you a break from the pain
 Enhances the healing effects (and reduces the side effects) of any med-
ications (conventional or alternative) you are taking
 Reduces the time you need to heal after surgery
 Promotes your body’s own internal healing system
More and more doctors, nurses, and hospitals are providing Reiki services
(and other energy-healing systems like therapeutic touch) for their patients.
Read more about how Reiki combines with different healing therapies in
Chapter 16.
Healing the emotions
Reiki has a special symbol just to heal the emotions and promote harmony 
(I cover the symbols in Chapter 8). The gentle healing that Reiki provides
works well with psychotherapy, massage, medication, and any other treat-
ments you use for emotional problems. Reiki specifically helps on the emo-
tional level in the following ways:
 Helps you release stuck or buried emotions: You may cry or have 
memories come up during a Reiki session. The release helps you feel
cleansed, and when memories come up, this may be an indication of
something that needs further healing.
 Gives you a pure sense of love: Reiki energy is the energy of love. Love
contains the power of the universe and brings forth a sense of whole-
ness and connection.
Relaxation is probably the primary reason that people try Reiki. I find that
when I have a Reiki session, I sigh deeply as the tension that I have been car-
rying around is released. The more you relax, the more your body accepts
the Reiki energy.
If you need to relax, Reiki is a healthier choice than using alcohol, drugs,
sugar, or other substances.

Getting insights or inspiration
If you’re feeling stuck or looking for resolution of a specific issue, Reiki can
help. While you’re having a Reiki session, you may experience an Aha! moment.
You have a realization or insight that answers a question or solves a problem.
Even if you don’t get inspiration during the session, your practitioner may
give you some feedback that she coincidentally picked up during the session.
Or you may find that the solution comes to you in your dreams or unexpect-
edly in the next few days.
Going farther in spiritual development
When you know you need to evolve in your spiritual growth or you want to
feel closer to spirit or act from the level of your soul, a Reiki session can defi-
nitely help. Reiki training will take you even farther and give you the tools to
grow spiritually. The attunement or initiation process removes energy blocks
that keep you stuck.
Reiki helps you evolve as a person and also helps you grow in consciousness.
Some people say not to study Reiki unless you are ready to change. The way I
see it, change is less painful than being stuck in old patterns that keep repeat-
ing and repeating and repeating. Reiki can be like the kick in the pants that
moves you to the next level spiritually.
Looking at the Reiki Symbols
The symbols are a distinctive and empowering feature of the Reiki system 
of healing. Four symbols are taught in the 2nd and 3rd degree Reiki training
classes. These symbols act as keys to connect the student with the Reiki
energy for life. When you are initiated into the Reiki system, the symbols and
Reiki energy are transmitted together during the attunement process. Forever
after, if you think of, draw out, or say the name of the symbol, the associated
aspect of the Reiki energy is called forth.
In past years, some Reiki teachers sought to keep the symbols secret as a
way to protect their value and keep them “pure.” However, an increasing
number of authors of books and Web sites revealed the symbols to the
public. I too have decided to provide clear information about the symbols 
in Chapter 8 so that you have all the information you need for a beginning
practice of Reiki right at your fingertips.
23
Chapter 1: Reiki: The Art of Channeling Life-Force Energy

Drawing the symbols correctly can be one of the more stressful aspects for a
new Reiki student. Two of the Reiki symbols are actually Japanese charac-
ters, which for the Westerner can be a little tricky to memorize how to draw.
Memorizing how to draw the symbols may be required during Reiki training.
Use the illustrations in Chapter 8 to help you practice drawing the symbols.
In Chapter 21, I show you some additional symbols that are not part of tradi-
tional Reiki but may be taught in nontraditional classes.
When you’re using the symbols, your intention is more important than an
exact replication of a symbol.
Combining New Age and Reiki
Reiki combines very well with New Age practices and beliefs. Reiki was used
in Japan before the New Age began in the West. People who use Reiki today
may or may not also embrace New Age ideology.

Part I: Discovering Reiki 
Manifesting with Reiki
A definition of manifesting is “to bring into
form.” You may have an idea of what you want
(lose weight, finish college, or run a marathon,
for example), but you may feel it will never
happen. Here are some tips on manifesting in
general and how Reiki can be used along with
manifesting:
 Think positively about the subject. That
means letting go of your fear or belief it won’t
happen. Believe it will happen. Believe in
miracles. A prayer I like on that note is “This
or something better.”
 Picture or visualize the event happening.
 Put light, sparkles, or Reiki symbols around
the picture of the event.
 Imagine that all parties involved experience
happiness and joy. What this means is that
you don’t try to manifest something that will
cause pain to anyone.
You can use any Reiki symbols or just imagine
the Reiki energy penetrating and surrounding
the situation. Do this manifestation work as part
of your meditation, write it in your journal, write
it out and post it on your wall, or carry it in your
wallet. Send Reiki to the situation as often as
possible.
The double Cho Ku Rei symbol (see Chapter 21)
is frequently used for manifestation purposes.

Some branches of Reiki combine certain New Age practices with Reiki. If you
investigate Reiki on the Internet or elsewhere, you might read about Reiki and
aliens or Reiki and dolphins. I don’t include that material in this book, but
that doesn’t mean it isn’t true or valuable!
I do include information on Reiki and crystals (see Chapter 12) and other
Western techniques that some people may consider New Age. As with all
things, take what you like and leave the rest. You’ll find that Reiki is compati-
ble with all religions, practices, or beliefs.

T
his chapter is about energy: the energy of Reiki and the energy of your
own body. The Japanese word Reiki actually means spiritual energy or
universal life-force energy. The way that Reiki works is to energize and har-
monize your body’s own energy. Modern science is catching up with ancient
traditions in seeing the human body as a wondrous interweaving of energy.
This chapter provides you with a road map of some of the ways to describe
and find the energy systems in the body. I also discuss the nature of Reiki
energy healing.
Describing Subtle Energy
The classical definition of energy is from Physics 101: the ability to perform
work. Energy comes in different forms, including chemical, electrical, light,
magnetic, mechanical, and nuclear energy.
The energy that is discussed in terms of Reiki or the body’s energy fields is
called subtle energy. The word subtle on its own means faint or difficult to
grasp, as in a subtle aroma. The energy field that surrounds the human body
is also called a biomagnetic or electromagnetic energy.

Even though the subtle energies may be faint, you still notice them. Here are
a few ways you may be aware of your subtle energy:
 If you’ve ever felt that someone was staring at you
 If you’ve ever walked into a room and sensed that something was not
quite right
 If you’ve ever felt that someone was standing too close to you, even
though you weren’t touching
Here’s an exercise to help you feel the subtle energy of your body:
1. Hold your hands out from your body, palms facing each other.
2. Try putting your hands together — slowly.
As they get closer but not touching, can you feel different sensations?
3. Try moving your hands closer together and then apart.
As you move back and forth, you can feel the energy sensations.
Subtle energy has been measured by scientists with an instrument called a
SQUID. Now don’t worry about animal rights here. SQUID stands for super-
conducting quantum interference devices. This device can measure
extremely small magnetic fields.
Different cultures have different names for subtle life-force energy in the
body, as described in Table 2-1.

Discovering Your Body’s 
Energy Anatomy
Modern-day science and medicine focus on the body as a complex machine
composed of interacting parts. The old childhood song you might have sung
with the lyrics “The thighbone is connected to the hipbone and the hipbone
is connected to the. . . .” tells one piece of the story of our bodies.
You can see your body with your eyes, but imagine that there is an energy in
and around your body that you can’t see with your eyes. Some of you are
quite comfortable believing and talking about energy you can’t see with your
eyes. Perhaps you can sense (with your sixth sense) or just “know” with your
intuition that this energy exists.
Others of you are more skeptical or suspicious of anything you can’t see.
Admittedly, even though I am scientifically trained, I am one of those people
who just “senses” that the body is really made of and is surrounded by
energy. I don’t need scientific proof to know about energy. But it’s good to
know that scientific research backs up the theory that the body is made of
energy.
Einstein’s famous equation, E=MC2, expresses perfectly that matter (the
body) is equal to energy. All you have to do to convert matter to energy (in
Einstein’s equation) is multiply a fixed number (the constant, c) and square
that number to get the numerical representation of the matter in energy form.
I’ll leave the details of Einstein’s equation to physicists, but what this pro-
found equation says is that matter and energy are the same thing. So, your
body, which you can touch and feel, is matter, and it is also energy.
Knowing the body’s physical 
and energetic anatomy
Because Reiki is concerned with treating the energy of the body, it helps to
know both the physical anatomy (see Figure 2-1) and the energy anatomy of
the body. Even without the information present in Figure 2-1, you’re probably
already familiar with the location and workings of your body’s organs, so 
this section focuses mainly on your body’s energy fields. But do make sure 
29
Chapter 2: Navigating Your Body’s Subtle Energy Systems

to have a basic familiarity with the organs of the body. That way, if you have a
Reiki recipient who tells you he is healing from hepatitis C, you’ll know that
you should spend some time treating the person’s right abdomen just below
the ribs.
The energy system of the body has its own organization and so-called energy
anatomy, just like the physical system. The anatomy of the body’s energy
fields (see Figure 2-2) has been described as follows:
 Energetic layers of the body:
• Physical: What you can see and dissect of the human body
• Etheric: The energy field associated with the physical body
• Emotional: The energy field in charge of emotions and feelings
• Mental: Your thoughts and intellect
• Spiritual: Your connection with spirit and the divine

These descriptions of the body’s layers are simplified for the purposes
of this book. The spiritual body, for example, can extend far out in many
layers, especially for people who have developed this part of themselves
through meditation and other spiritual practice. But I want to give the
general idea that the body exists at multiple interacting levels.
 Aura, which contains all these energy layers.
 Meridians, which serve as an energy highway system throughout the
body.
 Chakras, which act as energy centers in the body. A central column of
energy runs through the body and connects the chakras.
If you view the body this way, you can look at the chakras as organs and the
meridians as blood vessels or lymphatic vessels that transport information.
These parts of your body’s energy anatomy are described in more detail later
in this chapter.

Sensing your body’s electromagnetic 
field: The aura
Aura is the term for the overall energy structure associated with an object in
addition to the physical body of the object. Aura is the energy field that sur-
rounds, penetrates, and extends outward from your body. The aura is illus-
trated in Figure 2-2 and it contains all the energy bodies. All objects, living or
otherwise, have an aura. 
Much has been written about auras in terms of colors and changes that
occur.
32
Part I: Discovering Reiki 
Reiki is an energy medicine
The basic premise of energy medicine is that dis-
ease is a function of some imbalance in any of
the energy bodies that translates down (through
the chakras and meridians) into illness in the
physical body.
The National Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines energy
medicine as a domain in complementary 
and alternative medicine (CAM). The concepts
behind energy medicine are that energy fields
can be used to improve your health by directly
treating or diagnosing imbalances in the body
and its energy fields.
NCCAM separates forms of energy medicine
into two parts:
 Veritable: Able to be measured. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) therapy, sound
therapy, and light therapy (lasers) are
examples.
 Putative: Not able to be measured. Reiki,
acupuncture, Qigong, Ayurvedic medicine,
homeopathy, and therapeutic touch are
examples.
Just because the energy that is given off by 
the putative forms of energy healing can’t be
measured doesn’t mean that these techniques
don’t have value. When studying a form of
energy medicine, scientists carry out two types
of studies:
 Measuring the energy
 Determining the effectiveness of the 
treatment
Acupuncture is proven to effectively treat cer-
tain medical conditions, but scientists are still
unsure about its subtle energy.
Reiki is well documented to help many people in
anecdotal (individual) stories, and further stud-
ies are needed to prove its effectiveness in
groups of people (see Chapter 16).

 Some people can see auras. Psychics and clairvoyants can see color,
shapes, and sizes of auras. You can learn to see auras too (check out 
the next section, “Seeing your aura”).
 Changes in the aura precede physical illness in the physical body.
 Healing of the physical body must also include healing of the aura, or
the disease will recur.
 A type of photography called Kirlian photography captures the aura on
film so that you can visualize it.
If you want to see a picture of the aura of fingertips before and after a Reiki
session, check out www.kirlian.org/kirlian/session.htm.
Seeing your aura
If you can see the aura, you’ll be more likely to believe in it. Your Reiki
teacher may take you through some exercises to sense auras. One exercise
you can do is as follows:
1. Hold your hand in front of you.
If possible, use a blank or white background.
2. Look softly at your fingers; try to close your eyes half way.
3. Take your attention to the space surrounding each finger.
Move your eyes out a little until you see a color or line. Close to your
body, the aura may appear purplish grey or yellow.
It takes a little practice, but keep focusing on the space surrounding your
hand. After you get the hang of it, you’ll want to keep practicing.
Remember this is a subtle energy. When you think you see something, you
have! Trust your impression! Now you can practice seeing auras on yourself
in the mirror or on other people. Remember to look softly.
Have you ever looked at old religious paintings? The saint’s gold halo in reli-
gious paintings is actually a golden colored aura.
Reiki and the aura
When you get a Reiki treatment, the energy treats your entire system, includ-
ing your aura. For that reason, Reiki can be beamed from across the room or
performed with hands above your body (see Chapter 10). The aura is fre-
quently treated before and/or after a Reiki session (see Chapter 13).
33
Chapter 2: Navigating Your Body’s Subtle Energy Systems

Because the aura holds energy of all sorts, a Reiki practitioner might want to
do an aura cleansing both before and after the Reiki session. I see it in terms
of being like a car wash, where the Reiki session is like a car wash. The aura
cleansing before the session is like performing a prewash to remove the
heavy dirt before performing the regular Reiki session. The aura cleansing
after the session is like performing a waxing to keep in and protect the 
“good” energy that you now have.
Pinpointing the acupuncture 
system: The meridians
Mikao Usui, the founder of Reiki, was aware of the acupuncture system,
which has been used in China for thousands of years. Acupuncture uses nee-
dles to stimulate tiny points of energy in the body. Acupuncture points are
like traffic signals that light the way of main thoroughfares for energy move-
ment throughout the body, which are called meridians.
Listing the meridians
The body has 12 main meridians that transport energy to the organs and sys-
tems of the body. The meridians crisscross through the body from head to
toe and exchange information with one another. Imagine that these meridians
are running all through the body: front, back, side, head, feet, and hands.
To give you an idea of the different meridians, consider that each is associated
with different organ systems. Remember, though, that each organ system is
“fed” by more than one meridian and that each meridian is associated with
more than one organ. Here is a list of the major meridians:
 Bladder
 Circulation-sex/pericardium
 Gallbladder
 Heart
 Kidney
 Large intestine
 Liver
 Lung
34
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

 Small intestine
 Spleen
 Stomach
 Triple warmer (endocrine glands)
There are also two systems called central meridian and governing merid-
ian that are used in the Hui Yin breath or microcosmic orbit described in
Chapter 9. By holding your tongue at the roof of your mouth and squeezing
the muscles of your perineum, you can enhance the energy flow coming out
of your hands or breath for use during Reiki procedures (attunements or
treatments).
Treating the meridians
Treatment of the meridians, whether by acupuncture, acupressure, or 
Reiki, seeks to remove energy blocks so that the energy may flow smoothly.
Because the meridians are interconnected, balance and harmony between
the meridians are essential. An acupuncture or acupressure practitioner
plans which acupuncture points he will treat. When you have Reiki treat-
ments, the healing energy will facilitate healing, but the practitioner doesn’t
necessarily know much about meridians because this information isn’t part
of standard Reiki training (see Chapter 7).
Any practitioners of energy healing, including Reiki healers, will find it worth-
while to study the meridians and even consider professional study if they feel
called to do so.
Locating your energy centers: The chakras
Chakra is an Indian Sanskrit word that means spinning wheel of energy, vortex,
or energy center. The human body has multiple chakras that transform infor-
mation between the different levels of the body, including the spiritual,
mental, emotional, and physical. For example, if you have emotional issues
involving your heart chakra, the issues could be transformed into heart 
disease by way of the heart chakra. Similarly, if you’re in a state of feeling
unconditional love and forgiveness, your heart chakra transforms that energy
to a healthy heart and circulation. Table 2-2 describes the chakras and the
parts of the body and issues that they govern.

Seven major chakras have been identified. If you refer to Figure 2-2, you can
see the placement of these chakras in the body:
 The first chakra is located at the base of your spine going down through
the perineum, which is the region between the anus and the genitals.
 The second chakra is located between the navel and pubic bone.
 The third chakra is between your diaphragm (the bottom of your rib
cage) and navel.
 The fourth chakra is in the center of the chest.
 The fifth chakra is at the base of the throat.
 The sixth chakra is in the center of the forehead.
 The seventh chakra is just above the top of the head.
36
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

Each chakra manages a flow of energy between the physical, etheric, emo-
tional, mental, and spiritual bodies. When your body is healthy, energy flows
along the meridians and chakras. But when there is an energy block, the
nearby meridians and chakras don’t get the energy flow. If this energy block
is not cleared, disease of nearby organs can occur.
The good news is that Reiki healing can open blocked chakras. When you 
perform a Reiki session, you can sense the energy of the chakra on both the
front and back of the body (except for the crown chakra).
Ultimately, the source of energy flow comes from outside of the body and
extends upward to the heavens for higher spiritual energy and below the
body for earth energy. The chakras serve to bring in energy from outside the
body, and when the chakras are open and flowing, this energy comes in and
supplies the body with energy.
The association of any chakra with a particular organ, system, or gland is 
not a hard-and-fast rule. For example, the lungs could be associated with the
throat chakra or the heart chakra. Use your intuition to determine which
chakra is affected if you’re working on a particular problem.
Detecting Your Subtle Energy 
System with Reiki
You may be wondering how it’s possible to sense your subtle energy system
if conventional equipment can’t see or measure it.
Whether you are the provider or recipient of Reiki energy, you’ll probably
sense the Reiki energy during the session. The recipient should relax and not
worry about trying to sense anything during the treatment (see Chapter 5). 
If you’re giving Reiki, you can train yourself to detect this energy by using 
the following techniques:
 With your hands: During a Reiki session, the practitioner’s hands not
only transmit spiritual energy but also receive certain information from
the recipient. This information may be tingles, heat, visualizations, or
other signs that give the practitioner feedback on where to treat and
when to stop. The more you use your hands in treating others, the more
sensitive you’ll be to this information.
37
Chapter 2: Navigating Your Body’s Subtle Energy Systems

 With your intuition: Even without touching someone, you can sense the
person’s energy.
• You can gaze gently and see the person’s aura, which may provide
information on the person’s energy systems.
• The connection made during distant Reiki (see Chapter 15) or by
scanning Reiki (see Chapter 10) may enable you to pick up on cer-
tain energy information.
• Meditation and visualization also enable you to sense where any
energy disruptions are occurring.
 With a pendulum: You can use a pendulum as a diagnostic tool to see
whether a chakra is open or closed (or somewhere in between). When 
a chakra’s energy is flowing, the pendulum is open; when energy is not
flowing, it is closed. You can find pendulums in stores that sell crystals
(see Chapter 12). I suggest that you find out about pendulum use from
your Reiki teacher. You predetermine the signs for “yes” (or open) and
“no” (or closed) by “asking” the pendulum what a yes looks like and
then what a no looks like. With practice, you can obtain repeatable
results.
When you use a pendulum and find that a chakra is closed, do some Reiki on
that chakra and then check it again.
If you’re working with anyone’s energy system in any way, you must have the
person’s permission first. You then have the responsibility to treat the work
and any information you obtain with the highest degree of integrity and com-
passion for that person. See Chapter 13 for a discussion of the ethics of doing
healing work with Reiki.

he main character in the history of Reiki is Mikao Usui, a Japanese
Buddhist who founded a healing system later called Reiki. After Usui, var-
ious Japanese and Western Reiki practitioners have interpreted and modified
the system. Like the growth of any healthy tree, Reiki has developed many
branches.
What unites the branches of Reiki is that the main trunk is from Mikao Usui.
After that, all Reiki branches diverge from the original to a greater or lesser
extent.
Every Western branch of Reiki, which means most of the Reiki taught around
the world, comes from Hawayo Takata, who learned from Chujiro Hayashi,
who learned from Mikao Usui. In this chapter, I give an overview of Reiki 
history by describing the contributions of Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, 
and Hawayo Takata and how branches of Reiki have evolved. Knowing the
history and branches of Reiki helps you determine which Reiki systems are
best for you.

If you studied Reiki more than a few years ago, read this chapter to brush up
on your knowledge of Reiki history. Much of what used to be taught just a few
years ago is now considered myth. Knowledge about Reiki history continues
to grow as more information becomes available from Japanese sources.
The essence of Reiki is the same, no matter who teaches it or how they do it.
Reiki is a system of healing that is easy to learn. The availability of so many
types of Reiki today means that Reiki is available to all who seek it.
Mikao Usui: Founder of Reiki
The history of Reiki (see Table 3-1) begins with Mikao Usui, who was born in
1865 in Japan. During his lifetime, he practiced Tendai Buddhism and studied
Japanese martial arts. He is also known to have studied history, medicine,
and spiritual practices from other cultures, including Christianity.
What makes Usui’s story truly extraordinary is that his drive to pursue his
spiritual truth led him to discover Reiki, which has in turn helped so many
people around the world.
Usui himself was a great healer and was reported to have helped many 
victims of the 1923 earthquake in Japan, which hit the cities of Tokyo and
Yokohama.

Finding Reiki on the mountaintop
In 1922 Mikao Usui went on a spiritual pilgrimage to Mount Kurama, which 
is near Kyoto, Japan. He fasted and meditated for 21 days while on the moun-
taintop. This was his own retreat from the world during which time he sought
spiritual enlightenment. During this time of meditation and retreat, Usui had 
a profound experience, during which he “received” enlightenment and the
system of Reiki.
Clearly Usui had a significant spiritual experience that influenced his personal
life and his teaching of Reiki. His experience on Mount Kurama is included on
his memorial stone. Hawayo Takata also talked about Usui’s experience on
Mount Kurama, although she embellished it with stories of him receiving
“bubbles” containing the Reiki symbols.
Teaching Reiki to others
Mikao Usui began imparting his spiritual experiences to others in the early
1900s. Hands-on healing and spiritual healing were popular in Japan at this
time. After his enlightenment on Mount Kurama, Usui refined his teachings to
a system that more closely resembles the Reiki that is taught today.
41
Chapter 3: Exploring Reiki’s Roots and Branches

The aim of Usui’s teaching was to provide students with tools for their own
spiritual enlightenment and healing. Usui’s system of healing included the 
following:
 Reiki Principles (see Chapter 4)
 Reiki hand positions (see Chapter 10)
 Meditation (see Chapter 9)
 Symbols and mantras (see Chapter 8)
 Attunement (initiation) process (see Chapter 7)
Because Usui’s system of healing has changed with each successive teacher, 
I can provide the information on Usui’s method only as it is commonly prac-
ticed today rather than as Usui once taught it. Some seek the holy grail of
Reiki: the original teachings of Mikao Usui. The problem is that no one sys-
tem of teaching will ever be found because Mikao Usui is known to have
varied his teachings depending on the student (see the section “Letting Reiki
Branches Differ,” later in this chapter).
Some of Usui’s teachings (or derivations of his teachings) are found in a
Japanese teaching manual called Usui Reiki Hikkei, which has been trans-
lated from the Japanese (see Frank Arjava Petter’s books in the Appendix).
Despite the historic detail of whether this manual was written by Usui him-
self or someone else soon after his death, this manual does provide insight
into early Reiki teaching. It contains the following:
 Reiki Principles (see Chapter 4), which were called “the secret method
to invite happiness.”
 “Usui’s Message about Reiki,” in which he introduces the concept of 
his teachings to the general public (see the sidebar “Introducing Reiki 
to the public”).
 Healing Guide, a series of hand positions that was probably developed
by Chujiro Hayashi (see the section “Exploring the Medical Approach:
Chujiro Hayashi,” later in this chapter); for a Western derivation of 
these positions, see Chapter 10.
 Meiji Emperor’s Poems (called gyosi in Japanese), short poems on
topics such as nature that were recited as a way to focus the mind.
 Usui’s answers to students’ questions.

Part I: Discovering Reiki 

Remember that Mikao Usui taught more than 75 years ago — before the age
of the course syllabus or computers. He taught individually to each student,
which makes it impossible to re-create his teachings exactly. What can be
done is to follow the essence of Reiki as best as possible.
Mikao Usui’s legacy
Mikao Usui died in 1926. By the time of his death, he is thought to have
trained around 2,000 students overall, including 21 who achieved the Master
Teacher level. Some well-known teacher students of Mikao Usui include the
following:

Chapter 3: Exploring Reiki’s Roots and Branches
Introducing Reiki to the public
From the Usui Reiki Hikkei, a Japanese Reiki
manual attributed to Mikao Usui.
“From ancient times whenever someone devel-
ops a secret method the one would teach this
to the people among family, as a legacy for the
later generations of the family living. That idea,
not to open to the public and keep that sacred
method in the family, is really the past century’s
bad custom.
“In modern days we have to live together. That’s
going to be the basis of happiness, earnestly
wanting social progress.
“That’s why I definitely won’t allow to keep this
for myself. Our Reiki Ryoho is a creative idea,
which no one has developed before and there
is nothing like this in this world. Therefore I am
going to open this idea to anybody for the
people’s benefit and welfare.
“And everyone will receive the blessing from
God. With this, expect everyone to have soul
and oneness.
“Our Reiki Ryoho is an original therapy method
using the power based on Reiki, which is a uni-
versal power in the universe.
“With this, first for human beings themselves to
be strong and healthy. Then to improve the
thoughts, to be mild and healthy, and human life
to be pleasant.
“Nowadays inside and outside of living we need
improvement and restructuring away from ill-
ness and suffering, many fellows have worrying
mind out of illness and accident.
“I dare to openly teach this method.”

Arjeva Petter in his books listed in the Appendix.

 Toshishiro Eguchi: A friend of Mikao Usui who learned Usui’s system
and also taught his own palm healing (tenohira) system at Usui’s center.
Eguchi continued to teach and was a famous healer in Japan with his
center, Tenohira Ryoji Kenkyo Kai. Eguchi published two books: in 1930,
Tenohira Ryoji Nyumon (An Introduction to Healing with the Palms) and
Tenohira Ryoji Wo Kataru (A Tale of Healing with the Palms of the Hands)
in 1954.
 Chujiro Hayashi: Created the system Hayashi Reiki Kenkyu Kai (see the
later section “Exploring the Medical Approach: Chujiro Hayashi”).
 Kaji Tomita: Became a famous healer and author in Japan. He called 
his hand-healing system Tomita Teate Ryoho. His book was called Reiki
To Jinjutsu – Tomita Ryu Teate Ryoho (Reiki and Humanitarian Work –
Tomita Ryu Hand Healing).
 Juzaburo Ushida and Kanichi Taketomi: Both past presidents of the
Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai, a Japanese Reiki society that has been active
since the time of Mikao Usui (or just after his death). It started as a
group of naval officers who had studied with Mikao Usui and continues
to be active. However, the Gakkai has remained a secretive society that
is closed to foreigners and has not revealed the methods it uses.
Note that even among Usui’s original students, creation of individually modi-
fied Reiki branches took place!
Reiki before Mikao Usui
Some Reiki teachers have suggested that Mikao Usui is not so much the
founder of Reiki but that he refound Reiki, which is an ancient form of heal-
ing. Here are two versions of these theories:
 Reiki is an ancient healing energy that had become lost, and Usui chan-
neled this lost ancient energy while meditating on Mount Kurama.
Some groups also feel justified to channel their own versions of Reiki
healing, symbols, and attunement methods.
 Reiki came from Buddhist texts, and Mikao Usui found these texts in his
research.
Certainly Buddhism influenced Mikao Usui’s system. Usui himself was a
lay Buddhist priest (which meant he could live with his family) and lived
in a country that practiced Buddhism and Shintoism. Development of
the symbols was certainly influenced by Buddhism (see Chapter 8 for
more about the symbols).
44
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

Mikao Usui called his system unique, and thus far no researcher has been
able to prove that Usui’s system of natural healing comes from any particular
Buddhist text or ancient civilization. Mikao Usui found a way to a universal
truth: that healing and enlightenment are possible and that everyone is capa-
ble of this healing and enlightenment. Usui developed his system of Reiki pre-
cisely because he wanted to share with others what he had found.
Exploring the Medical Approach: 
Chujiro Hayashi
Chujiro Hayashi was one of Mikao Usui’s students who had a huge influence
on the further development of Reiki. When Chujiro Hayashi studied with
Mikao Usui, he was a retired naval medical officer. Hayashi was able to spend
ten months learning Reiki from Mikao Usui before Usui died in 1926.
Dr. Hayashi, a surgeon, brought a medical approach to the practice of Reiki
with his knowledge of anatomy and medicine. He prepared a manual of hand
positions that treated different illnesses. He set up the first Reiki clinic, which
brought Reiki healing into a medical model of treatments. His clinic was able
to treat at least eight people simultaneously on separate mats or futons, with
two practitioners working on each recipient.
In his system of teaching Reiki, Dr. Hayashi developed the process of passing
on Reiki to students by using symbols and mantras during the attunement
process (see Chapter 7), the modern attunement process used by branches
of Western Reiki.
Chujiro Hayashi, though a retired naval officer, was a man of peace. As World
War II approached, he knew that Japan would go to war and that he would be
called back to duty. So at the age of 40, he decided to end his life rather than
be forced to kill people in military action. The branch of Reiki that he devel-
oped was called Hayashi Reiki Kenkyu Kai; his wife Chie Hayashi continued
this branch after he died. As far as I know, this branch has not survived, 
but his teachings continued through his two most well-known Reiki Master
students:
 Hawayo Takata: Dr. Hayashi took the important step to train the
Hawaiian woman Hawayo Takata (see the following section). Dr. Hayashi
was thus pivotal in the spread of Reiki to the West.
 Chiyoko Yamaguchi: Chiyoko Yamaguchi, who died in 2003, and her son
taught Jikiden Reiki, and one of her former students teaches Komyo
Reiki Kai (see the Appendix for contact information about these two
Reiki branches.)
45
Chapter 3: Exploring Reiki’s Roots and Branches

Bringing Reiki from East 
to West: Hawayo Takata
Hawayo Takata plays a critical role in Reiki history because she single-
handedly transferred Reiki from Japan to the West. Though Hawayo Takata
was an American citizen born in the then territory of Hawaii, she was of
Japanese heritage, so she was able to walk in both Eastern and Western
worlds.
Hawayo Takata was born on Christmas Eve 1900 and named for her birth-
place of Hawaii. Her parents emigrated from Japan and worked hard to make
a modest living in Hawaii. To take care of personal business and health mat-
ters, Hawayo Takata traveled to Japan in 1935.
46
Part I: Discovering Reiki 
Passing Reiki on
For decades, Hawayo Takata practiced Reiki in
Hawaii and the mainland United States. In 1976
she trained her first Reiki Master and ended up
training 22 Reiki Masters before she died in 1980.
Here are Takata’s Reiki Masters:

Mary McFadyen
Paul Mitchell

Hawayo Takata’s students, and their succession
of students, brought Reiki to the United States,
the Western world, and other countries, includ-
ing Japan. Some of Hawayo Takata’s students
are still living, and I provide their Web sites in
the Appendix.

Learning Reiki for herself
Just before Hawayo Takata was about to have surgery, she had a premonition
that a nonsurgical solution for her health was possible. It turns out that the
receptionist at the clinic was Chie Hayashi, who directed Hawayo Takata to
her husband’s Reiki clinic.
After six months of treatments, Hawayo Takata was cured. She was so
impressed with the Reiki method that she was able to persuade Chujiro
Hayashi to teach it to her. She studied with Chujiro Hayashi and then brought
the system back to her native Hawaii. Chujiro Hayashi and his daughter fol-
lowed her to Hawaii to help Hawayo Takata set up a Reiki practice.
Takata’s tall tales
Many of the stories about Reiki history told by Hawayo Takata (a natural story-
teller) and her students and subsequently repeated in many books are now
known to be untrue. I mention some of these myths in Chapter 20.
A generation of Reiki students learned old versions of Reiki history told by
Takata, with compelling twists and turns involving Jesus and his healing abili-
ties, Christianity, Buddhist sutras, beggars, life-saving events, college presi-
dents, and bubbles of Reiki symbols appearing on Mount Kurama.
In today’s world, the old story of Reiki is no longer necessary to keep Reiki
alive (see the sidebar “The true role of Hawayo Takata”).
47
Chapter 3: Exploring Reiki’s Roots and Branches
The true role of Hawayo Takata
Despite her role in creating Reiki myths (see
Chapter 20), Hawayo Takata wanted Reiki to
survive in the Western world. When the dust
settles, I believe that time will show Hawayo
Takata to be the Reiki heroine that she truly was.
Imagine that Hawayo Takata managed to pre-
serve a Japanese healing method in Hawaii, the
very state that was bombed by the Japanese at
Pearl Harbor!
Hawayo Takata had to fight discrimination on
both sides. The Japanese saw her as an
American. Even today, the Usui Reiki Ryoho
Gakkai doesn’t train foreigners or admit them as
members of their organization. It’s a miracle that
Chujiro Hayashi (see the section “Exploring the
Medical Approach: Chujiro Hayashi” in this
chapter) even trained her and helped her with
her Reiki practice!
Her work brought Reiki to the West, and stu-
dents of her system even brought Reiki back to
Japan.

Reiki in Japan and the West
When Hawayo Takata (see the section “Bringing Reiki from East to West:
Hawayo Takata,” earlier in this chapter) died, none of her students were
aware that Reiki existed in Japan. Her Masters students tried to put together
their notes from the different teachings that Takata had given each of them.
Some of her students wrote books or created new Reiki branches.
Reiki in Japan
After Mikao Usui died in 1926, followers of his system in Japan went on qui-
etly without much public notice.
People in the West who studied Reiki weren’t even aware that Reiki had sur-
vived in Japan. It appears that Japanese Reiki was lying in wait like a dormant
seed. In 1985, Mieko Mitsui, a student of Barbara Weber Ray, returned to
Japan and began to teach some levels of Reiki (see Table 3-1 and Figure 3-1).
Japanese people were eager to study Reiki, and other Reiki teachers from the
West also came to Japan to teach Reiki.
Eventually, the increased interest in Reiki stimulated some Japanese-trained
Reiki practitioners and teachers to come out of hiding and begin teaching
their methods!
Japanese and Western Reiki today
Today a distinction is made between Japanese Reiki, in some branches possi-
bly more faithful to Mikao Usui’s original style, and Western Reiki, which has
been altered by changes made by Chujiro Hayashi, Hawayo Takata, and even
further by successive Reiki teachers.
Japanese Reiki is now being studied in the West as Reiki students yearn to
discover the roots of Reiki. As information on Japanese Reiki techniques
becomes available, Western branches of Reiki are incorporating this informa-
tion into their teachings.
In Japan, students of Reiki are also studying both Japanese and Western styles
of Reiki. Teachers of Western-style Reiki continue to go to Japan and teach.
In the rest of this book, I present methods from both Japanese and Western
branches (see Figure 3-1). In this figure, note that each branch derives from
Mikao Usui and one of his students. Each branch is represented by a circle.

Looking at Reiki Branch Lineage
As I mention throughout this chapter, there are many Reiki branches, which
each teach a form of Reiki. My focus in this book is on branches that show a
direct lineage back to Mikao Usui. Refer to Figure 3-1 to get an idea of the way
that different branches have diverged.
The concept of lineage in Reiki just means who taught whom. All Reiki stu-
dents, practitioners, or teachers of the Usui Reiki are linked to one another
because all are connected to Mikao Usui.
Tracing your Reiki lineage means looking back from teacher to teacher, going
all the way back to Mikao Usui.
Not everyone is concerned with lineage. If you want to know how your branch
of Reiki or your teacher links back to Mikao Usui, ask your teacher to provide
this information.

Each Reiki branch has a founder. Technically, Mikao Usui is the ultimate
founder. When a Reiki Master changes the teachings, he usually renames the
teachings, calls it a Reiki branch, and calls himself the founder.
In the Appendix, I give contact information on 25 different Reiki branches,
which represent most but not all Reiki branches that exist. Of these, 16 are
more directly derived from Mikao Usui, and I list the lineage that connects
each of these branches to Mikao Usui.
You can also find those branches that aren’t directly derived from Mikao Usui,
but are related, in the Appendix. These branches are actually more like off-
shoots of the original Reiki tree rather than branches.
Japanese Usui Reiki branches
Here are the major branches of Reiki in Japan that I am aware of. You can find
Web site information for these branches in the Appendix. The lineage for each
branch starts with Mikao Usui and continues to the current founder or teacher
of that branch.
 Gendai Reiki Ho: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Kanichi Taketomi, Kimiko
Koyama, Hiroshi Doi. Founder: Hiroshi Doi
 Jikiden Reiki: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Chiyoko Yamaguchi,
Tadao Yamaguchi. Founders: Chiyoko Yamaguchi and Tadao Yamaguchi
 Komyo Reiki Kai: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Chiyoko
Yamaguchi, Hyakuten Inamoto. Founder: Hyakuten Inamoto
 Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Juzaburo Ushida,
Kanichi Taketomi, Yoshiharu Watanabe, Toyoichi Wanami, Kimiko
Koyama, Masataki Kondo. Founder: Mikao Usui. This organization seeks
to preserve Mikao Usui’s teachings, but unfortunately is restrictive in
terms of both its membership and the information it gives out.
 Usui Reiki Ryoho: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Kanichi Taketomi, Kimiko
Koyama, Hiroshi Doi. Founder: Hiroshi Doi
Japanese-style Usui Reiki
The following two branches were taught by Japanese Reiki practitioners to
Western students, who are the founders of these branches:
52
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

 Usui-Teate: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Suzuki san, Chris Marsh. Founder: Chris
Marsh. Also called “Method to Achieve Personal Perfection.”
 Usui-Do: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Toshishiro Eguchi, Yuji Onuki, Dave King.
Founders: Dave King (Canada) and Melissa Riggall (deceased), who pre-
sented this system based on Eguchi’s work.
Western Usui Reiki branches
The main branches of Western Reiki all derive from Hawayo Takata:
 The Radiance Technique (Authentic Reiki): Lineage: Mikao Usui Chujiro
Hayashi, Hawayo Takata, Barbara Weber Ray. Founder: Barbara Weber
Ray, who claims that she is the sole successor to Hawayo Takata.
 Usui Shiki Ryoho: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Hawayo Takata.
The Reiki Alliance is a group that formed after Hawayo Takata died. Both
the Reiki Alliance and Phyllis Lei Furamoto (who is Hawayo Takata’s
granddaughter) claim that Furamoto is the true successor to Hawayo
Takata. Many independent Reiki Masters (including myself) have studied
under this system but are not necessarily part of the Reiki Alliance.
 Usui/Tibetan Reiki: Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Hawayo
Takata, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, Carrell Ann Farmer, Leah Smith, William
Lee Rand. Founder: William Lee Rand (United States). This is my lineage
for my Reiki Master training with one of William Rand’s students, Kathie
Lipinski.
Additional information on other branches of Reiki as well as other non-Usui
(post-Usui) forms of Reiki is listed in the Appendix.
Choosing a Reiki Branch for Yourself
No one school or branch of Reiki is the best or truly speaks for all of Reiki. I
suggest that you take the following steps before choosing a Reiki branch:
 Check out what types of Reiki classes are available in your location.
 Speak to Reiki practitioners whom you know. Ask them what they liked
and disliked about their classes or teachers.
53
Chapter 3: Exploring Reiki’s Roots and Branches

 Try out a Reiki session with a teacher you’re considering (either a pri-
vate session or a Reiki circle).
 Go to a Reiki circle or share in your community and get exposed to many
teachers at once.
 Speak to potential Reiki teachers and ask them the questions I suggest in
Chapter 7.
Letting Reiki Branches Differ
Despite questions and even some differences of opinion among branches on
aspects of Reiki practice, the system of Reiki not only survives but thrives!
The intrinsic power of Reiki goes beyond any disagreements over different
interpretations. The differences between Reiki branches are similar to differ-
ences in branches of religions, where each has different practices but ulti-
mately has the same goal.
Variety of practice is almost built in to the way that Reiki was taught and
passed on by Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, and Hawayo Takata. Refer to
Figure 3-1 to note the evolution of different branches of Reiki. Here, I examine
the similarities and differences between Usui and Takata:
 Both Usui and Takata trained each student differently:
• Usui based his teachings on what he felt would be best for each
student and the student’s particular spiritual level. For example,
some students got symbols and some did not.
• Takata didn’t allow students to take notes. When they got together
after she died, the students were shocked to find they had each
been given different variations of the teachings.
 Neither Usui nor Takata clearly appointed a successor:
• Controversy apparently exists among Japanese Master students of
Mikao Usui. The Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai claims to be the official
society started by Mikao Usui. Other students of Mikao Usui who
have been interviewed by Western Reiki historians dispute this
claim.
• When Hawayo Takata died, she didn’t have a clear successor.
Eventually Barbara Weber Ray (the Radiance technique) and
Phyllis Lei Furumoto (Hawayo Takata’s granddaughter) each
claimed to be the successor. Furumoto was called the “lineage
bearer” and “grandmaster” by the Reiki Alliance.
54
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

The lack of either a consistent and universal teaching or creation of one 
official school to carry on each of their Reiki systems led the successors of
Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, and Hawayo Takata to each create their own
versions or branches of Reiki practice. Because of these differences, different
branches have some differences of interpretation of the Reiki system and
practice.
The benefit of no obvious successor to Reiki is that there are many varieties
from which to choose and learn!
Reiki belongs to everyone. No one person or branch is the sole lineage
bearer.
Picturing the Future of Reiki
Like a carpet of wildflowers, Reiki has spread to different countries with dif-
ferent branches and different versions. Like any new natural form, some ver-
sions will thrive, and some will die out. Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, and
Hawayo Takata have left the world with so many different Reiki seeds, they
ensure that some will germinate fruitfully.
The way for Reiki to survive is to practice the Reiki Principles (see Chapter 4).
The future of Reiki will take care of itself.

Looking at the Reiki Principles
In This Chapter
 Using Reiki as a tool for spiritual growth
 Listing the Reiki Principles
 Living with the Reiki Principles
A
n important feature of Reiki, which is sometimes overlooked, is that
Reiki was designed as a potent tool for personal and spiritual growth,
and to this end, it’s important to know the five Reiki Principles.
The five Reiki Principles form the cornerstone of what is essentially a Reiki
spiritual practice. All branches of Reiki derived from Mikao Usui’s teachings
(see Chapter 3 for information about Reiki branches) use some version of the
Reiki Principles. Whether they’re called Reiki Principles, Reiki Precepts, or
Reiki Ideals, these five statements are used as guidelines to right living and
spiritual development. When you use the Reiki Principles, you’re following
directly in the footsteps of Mikao Usui. In this chapter, I describe the Reiki
principles: what they are and how to use them.
It’s not enough to just read the Reiki Principles and just turn the page. To get
the full benefit and value of Reiki, you must aim to live by the Reiki Principles.
Don’t worry — they express universal truths that would be approved by any
religion!
Describing the Reiki Principles
The Reiki Principles are so important and so intrinsic to the practice of Reiki
that they are engraved on Mikao Usui’s tombstone (see the sidebar “Reiki prin-
ciples from Mikao Usui’s memorial stone”). Before Usui’s memorial stone was
discovered and available in English, the Reiki Principles were taught in differ-
ent versions by different teachers. Hawayo Takata taught the Reiki Principles,
and her students continue to pass these on.

Don’t worry if you have different forms of the Reiki Principles. Teachers from
varying Reiki lineages (see Chapter 3) may present the principles in slightly
different versions or translations (from the Japanese original). But the mean-
ing of all versions is essentially the same.
The Reiki Principles are five simple statements describing how to live — just
for today:
 Just for today, don’t get angry.
 Just for today, don’t worry.
 Just for today, be grateful.
 Just for today, be honest in your work.
 Just for today, be kind to yourself and others.
58
Part I: Discovering Reiki 
Reiki Principles from Mikao Usui’s memorial stone
Hawayo Takata (see Chapter 3) and also her 
students taught the Reiki Principles. When Reiki
historian Frank Arjava Petter located the memo-
rial to Reiki founder Mikao Usui in Tokyo, he
translated and published this information. The
following excerpt was taken from the full Usui
Memorial written by Juzaburo Ushido and
Masayuki Okada in February 1927. The translation
was by Masano Kobayashi, Chetna Kobayashi,
and Frank Arjava Petter (Source: Reiki Fire by
Frank Arjava Petter, 1997, Lotus Light, Twin Lakes,
Wisconsin).
“Reiki not only heals diseases, but also amplifies
innate abilities, balances the spirit, makes the
body healthy, and thus helps achieve happiness.
To teach this to others you should follow the five
principles of the Meiji Emperor and contemplate
them in your heart.
They should be spoken daily, once in the morn-
ing and once in the evening.
1. Don’t get angry today.
2. Don’t worry today.
3. Be grateful today.
4. Work hard today (meditative practice).
5. Be kind to others today.
The ultimate goal is to understand the ancient
secret method for gaining happiness (Reiki) and
thereby discover an all-purpose cure for many
ailments. If these principles are followed, you will
achieve the great tranquil mind of the ancient
sages. To begin spreading the Reiki system, it is
important to start from a place close to you (your-
self), don’t start from something distant such as
philosophy or logic.
Sit still and in silence every morning and every
evening with your hands folded in the Gassho or
Namaste. Follow the great principles, and be
clean and quiet. Work on your heart and do
things from the quiet space inside of you.
Anyone can access Reiki, because it begins
within yourself!”
It is believed that Usui knew of the five princi-
ples from the Meiji Emperor of Japan or from a
book of his time that listed similar principles:
Kenzon no Gebri by Bizan Suzuki, published in
Japan in 1914.

Staying in the present: Just for today
The most important part of the Reiki Principles is the beginning statement:
just for today.
Today is really where it’s at. Yesterday is over, and tomorrow hasn’t happened
yet. If your thoughts and energy are in the past or future, there’s little time
left to experience the present. When you’re not in today, that’s when you feel
that life is passing you by.
Spending too much time reminiscing, looking at old photos, and wondering
“what if?” is living in the past. Sitting with your daily planner, fixing for your
future, worrying about next year, next month, or even tomorrow is living in
the future.
Staying in today is like balancing a seesaw. Spending too much time wander-
ing in the past or in the future will take you away from today.
Here are some tips to help stay in the present moment:
 Take note of your senses: Ask yourself what you see, feel, hear, smell,
and taste.
 Be with someone you love or an object of beauty like a sunset or a
flower. Just focus on your love and merge with that.
 Spend time with young children!
 Try breathing exercises or meditation (see Chapter 9) to help focus on
the present moment.
Seeing the present moment as a gift (or a present) makes every experience a
joy to unwrap!
When receiving or giving Reiki, being fully present also allows the Reiki
energy to be at its brightest and highest intensity.
Going through the five Reiki Principles
In this section I list the five Reiki Principles and give you some ways to think
about how to use these principles.
Don’t get angry
Everyone feels anger at one time or another. Triggers for anger occur when
someone does you wrong, hurts your feelings, or challenges your security.

The goal of this Reiki Principle is to express your anger in a way that doesn’t
hurt anyone (including yourself). Anger that isn’t properly channeled leads to
violence, war, crime, stress, and disease.
Anger that is properly channeled can be used to further your personal growth.
The anger is a signal that you have an imbalance or conflict that needs to be
addressed (see the steps later in this section). You can transform your anger
by making changes in your thinking or actions.
Not getting angry doesn’t mean to push away your anger. Suppressed anger
can come back to bite you (and others). Like a smoldering flame, anger that
is submerged will arise again, perhaps even stronger and more destructive.
Here are steps you can take to help you transform your anger:
1. See the anger.
You can’t do anything about your anger if you don’t first recognize that
you are angry.
2. Take a timeout.
Count to ten, breathe deeply, and think about the situation before reacting.
Avoid knee-jerk reactions. Don’t send angry e-mails or shout angry words.
If the anger dissipates on its own; then let it go! If you still feel angry, you
must go deeper to see what’s going on.
3. Decide what the anger means.
Anger frequently masks other emotions, such as fear. For example, you
might be angry with your husband for quitting his job because you fear
being poor. Your fear about financial insecurity is what’s underneath the
anger.
4. Take action.
If you fear financial insecurity, maybe you need to spend less or find
ways to bring in more money. If someone in your life is making you angry
on a regular basis, maybe you need to spend less time with that person.
Feeling angry isn’t pleasant. Sometimes, you may be tempted to drown the
anger in food, alcohol, or other addictive substances. You can’t run from the
anger. Use it instead to lead you farther in your spiritual journey. If you take
your anger and meditate on it, you’ll find a message for you. Your anger is
actually a great teacher to lead you to your truth.
Learning to recognize and transform your anger from a knee-jerk reaction
to calm action takes dedicated practice. You probably can’t change from
Ms. Angry Lady to Ms. Calm Lady overnight. But you can follow the “just for
today” idea to change your thinking and behavior. Slowly but surely, your
anger will diminish.
60
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

If you find that you can’t resolve your anger on your own, find a therapist,
counselor, or spiritual advisor who can help you.
Don’t worry
A worrier is a person who worries about bad things that may happen. The irony
is that worry drains the body and mind of the energy it actually needs to deal
with any crisis! The best way to prepare for life’s situations — and life always
thrusts some sort of challenge — is to be in optimum condition in mind, body,
and spirit.
Here are some tips to reduce worry:
 Live in the present. Worry is always about how past events might catch
up with you and how future events might hurt you. What about right now?
 Distract yourself from the worry. Talk to a friend, laugh at a movie, or
get involved with your life. You can wash your kitchen floor, pet your
dog, or go for a walk.
 Take action. If you’re worried about a person or situation, take any action
that can help. For example, if you’re worried about your son’s health,
perhaps you can find a new doctor or make him healthy food to eat.
 Pray. Constant worry denotes a lack of trust. Work to strengthen your
connection with spirit. Pray about or send distant Reiki (see Chapter 15)
to whatever worries you have.
 Let go of the worry. After you’ve taken any necessary action and prayed
or sent distant Reiki, it’s time to let go! To help yourself let go, try living
in the present and distracting yourself.
Most of the time what you worry about never happens! Practicing the Reiki
Principles regularly will keep you in better shape to handle what problems do
arise in your life.
Be grateful
Appreciating what you have, no matter what it is, is essential for happiness.
Here are some tips to help you keep an attitude of gratitude:
 Keep a gratitude list or journal. Write down everything from the small-
est things (like your teeth or a hot bath) on up to the larger things, such
as the love of your life.
 Give thanks before or after each meal. Thank the animals or plants that
give their life energy, the farmers and suppliers, and the people who pre-
pare your food.
 Make gratitude a habit. When you go to bed at night, take mental note
of what you’re thankful for in the day that has just ended.
61
Chapter 4: Looking at the Reiki Principles

Cultivating an attitude of gratitude helps develop humility because you’re
acknowledging that you’re dependent on help from other people and spirit.
Be honest in your work
Work is how you connect with the world around you and provide for the
exchange of resources (money) that allows you to stay warm and well fed.
Sometimes this Reiki Principle is stated as “work hard.”
Here are some questions to ask yourself about this Reiki Principle:
 Am I honest in my dealings with my employers and clients? Am I work-
ing with integrity, or am I trying to cheat my employer?
 Am I following my true calling? Many people are searching to know
what their best job is. The best job is to do the utmost with what you’re
doing right now. If and when it’s time to change, your inner voice will let
you know. Following the nudging of your inner voice can be scary because
many people fear change. (You can practice self-Reiki to help with these
fears; see Chapter 11.)
 Am I honoring myself in my work? Working hard doesn’t mean abusing
yourself. Knowing when to work late and when to take a rest is part of
the art of living.
 Am I using my gifts and talents? Work is more than paid 9-to-5 employ-
ment. You might also volunteer, raise children, and keep a home. You may
have many different skills and abilities and use different ones at different
times and situations. For example, you might be a gifted musician and
play music with friends on weekends.
The type of work you do is not as important as your attitude and dedication
to the project. And remember: just for today.
Be kind to yourself and others
The ultimate test when practicing a spiritual life is acceptance of and love for
yourself and others. Being kind acknowledges that spirit is present in every
living being. I had the opportunity to visit Japan for a scientific conference
before I studied Reiki. One thing that impressed me was that people whom I
passed in the street bowed to me, and I bowed to them. I was told that the
concept behind this practice is that “the spirit in me sees the spirit in you.”
As a starting point for having more compassion in your life, you can try these
suggestions:
 Practice random acts of kindness. This great concept couples the act
of compassion with humility. You need not tell anyone what you have
done, but it helps you anyway. An act of kindness can range from let-
ting someone go ahead of you in the supermarket line to giving an
anonymous financial gift. You can deposit coins in expired parking
meters!
62
Part I: Discovering Reiki 

 Listen to people. Showing love for others is to give them what they
want, not what you think they want.
 Start by being kind to yourself. You can’t really love others if you don’t
love yourself. By loving yourself, you also demonstrate to others how
you expect to be treated.
By practicing this and the other Reiki Principles, you begin to see all beings
as manifestations of spirit. Even if you have petty disagreements with some-
one else, being kind means practicing from the deeper knowledge that love is
behind all people, even if they’re not aware of it. The funny thing about culti-
vating loving thoughts is that they have a way of growing and making the
world a place filled with love and light.
Love is the essence of Reiki.
Incorporating the Reiki Principles 
into Your Daily Life
After you read about the Reiki Principles, you may think, “Okay, I’ve read them,
now what?” The principles are deceptively simple, but it actually takes effort
to consistently live by these principles day in and day out. Spiritual growth is
a lifelong process.
Some teachers may ask you to make a promise to uphold the Reiki Principles
before or after receiving an attunement (which open you to the Reiki energy;
see Chapter 7 for more about attunements). It’s up to you to decide how and
when you will use the Reiki Principles in your life.
The most important part of the Reiki Principles states “just for today.” 
Do the best you can to practice these principles today. Tomorrow will be
another today, and you can start over again.
63
Chapter 4: Looking at the Reiki Principles
Saying it in Japanese
The Reiki Principles were originally intended to be
chanted (in Japanese, of course) in the morning
and in the evening. This practice was not included
in Hawayo Takata’s teachings, or Western Reiki.
For the purists out there who want to hear or
say the Reiki Principles in Japanese, check out
one of these Web sites:
 www.Reiki.org/Japanese
Techniques/5Principles.html
 www.reikidharma.com/en/Reiki/en_
Reiki_pri_low.html
Soon, you’ll be able to say the Reiki Principles
in Japanese by yourself!

Here are some ways to use the Reiki Principles on a daily basis:
 Remind yourself of the principles by reading them silently or aloud
and thinking or writing about each of the five Reiki Principles at least
once a day. (Learn to recite them in Japanese by consulting the sidebar
“Saying it in Japanese.”)
 Put up a copy of the Reiki Principles in a prominent place in your home
or office.
 Some Reiki people use the Gassho meditation (see Chapter 9), putting
the hands in a prayer position in front of the heart, when reciting the
Reiki Principles.
The more time and effort you put into the Reiki Principles, the more peace
and serenity you will find.
Additional Versions of Reiki Principles
Here are two other Reiki Principles from other versions that I feel deserve
some mention.
Just for today, be humble
The principle “be grateful” is sometimes interpreted as “be humble.” I like this
version because it reminds me to release my ego, which can prevent Reiki
from flowing.
64
Part I: Discovering Reiki 
Reiki Principles from Hawayo Takata
Here is a variation on the Reiki Principles that
was taught by Hawayo Takata to her students:
Just for today, do not anger
Just for today, do not worry
Honor your teachers, your father and
mother, and your neighbors; count your
blessings; and show appreciation for 
your food
Earn your living honestly
Be kind to everything that has life
From Reiki: Hawayo Takata’s Story by Helen
Haberly, 1990, Archedigm.

To be humble is to have humility, which is an absence of pride or arrogance.
I see humility as recognizing your place in the universe: not too small and not
too big. Here are a few other ways to look at this principle:
 To be humble is to understand that any gift or power that you possess
comes from a higher source.
 To be humble is to know that you’re not better or worse than any other
human being or Reiki practitioner.
Having humility gives you a safe place to rest. You don’t need to be better
than anyone, and you don’t need to compete. Realizing that you’re a channel
for a higher power takes the need to control out of your hands. If you are a
Reiki practitioner, you have no control of how your energy work will help
others. You do the work and leave the outcome to a higher power.
I like this principle. It puts me right in the place I need to be!
Honor your parents, teachers, elders
Hawayo Takata and her students added these versions to the Reiki Principles.
One of my Reiki teachers gave me “Honor your parents, teachers, elders.”
In the sidebar version (“Reiki Principles from Hawayo Takata”), it is “Honor
your teachers, your father and mother, and your neighbors; count your bless-
ings; and show appreciation for your food.”
This principle brings in the biblical commandment to honor your parents and
adds teachers and others to the statement.
Perhaps Hawayo Takata adapted this principle to fit the story of Reiki she
devised to enable Reiki to fit into the Christian Western culture during World
War II, when anti-Japanese sentiments ran high.
Use the version of the Reiki Principles that feels right to you.

T
he best way to find out about Reiki is to try it! Go to
your local healing center, beauty salon, or complemen-
tary health practitioner and ask about Reiki. Once you find
a Reiki practitioner or a Reiki circle, you begin the journey
of healing. The chapters in Part II tell you what you need to
do to begin exploring the benefits of Reiki.
The noise and distraction of the outside world stop when
you’re receiving Reiki. As the Reiki practitioner channels
the beautiful healing energy of Reiki, you might feel your-
self floating as you enter a deeper and deeper state of
relaxation. You might even fall asleep! The benefits of Reiki
continue after the session as the relaxation continues.
The Reiki benefits don’t stop with you. Your entire family
can use Reiki to relax and to enhance the healing of med-
ical, emotional, or stress-related problems. Even your pets
can enjoy the benefits of Reiki.
Whether or not you go on to become a Reiki practitioner,
you’ll always come back to the essence of Reiki: receiving
the healing energy yourself.

R
eceiving Reiki is a delightful experience. The more you relax and let
yourself absorb the Reiki energy, the more you’ll get out of it. You might
experience Reiki in a professional, one-on-one session, or you might attend a
Reiki circle and receive shorter treatments there. You might find out about
Reiki from a friend or relative who then extends an informal offer to give you
a Reiki treatment in your home.
In this chapter, I go through the Reiki session from the point of view of the
recipient, describing what to expect while receiving Reiki, what to look for
in a practitioner, and what you can do to most benefit from Reiki. If you
want to know more about what the practitioner is doing, you can ask her or
read Chapter 13, which describes the session from the point of view of the
practitioner.

Finding the Right Reiki 
Practitioner for You
Reiki practitioners come in all ages, shapes, and sizes. You can even give
Reiki to yourself if you have studied Reiki (see Chapters 7 and 11). Here are
two types of Reiki practitioners you’ll encounter:
 A friend or family member who practices Reiki: You might find out
about Reiki from a friend or relative who then extends an informal offer
to give you a Reiki treatment in your home.
 A professional Reiki practitioner: You generally pay for these services,
which are provided in a specially designated location. Professionalism in
Reiki is growing as more practitioners establish businesses where they
provide Reiki (see Chapter 17).
The difference between a professional Reiki session and a freebie session
from a friend is like the difference between a chef’s meal cooked at home or
cooked in his restaurant. Both are exquisite but are prepared in different
environments.
A Reiki practitioner is a professional just like a massage therapist, chiro-
practor, or even a doctor. The Reiki practitioner has spent time learning his
trade and polishing his skills. In the future, health insurers may cover Reiki
services.
Locating a professional practitioner
If you’re ready to try a private Reiki session, how can you find a good practi-
tioner? You can find Reiki in a beauty salon, a chiropractor’s office, a village
hall, or a private office. Try these suggestions:
70
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 
A first Reiki experience
A young man who came to a Reiki circle that I
attended wrote this of his first experience lying
on the Reiki table:
“I was a bit nervous, as I didn’t know what was
going on. However, within the first five minutes,
I was able to detach from reality, let go, and not
only enjoy but feel, truly feel, the energy, magic,
and life that was transpiring around me, through
me, and around me. Magic, truly magic. I have
not felt that safe, free, good, and pure in a long
time, like five years at least.”

 Get personal recommendations. Nothing beats a positive reference
from someone who’s actually been to a Reiki practitioner. Ask your
friends and family and your health care practitioners, including massage
therapists, chiropractors, and psychologists, if they can recommend a
Reiki practitioner.
 Go to your local Reiki circles that are open to the public. Individual
Reiki practitioners or groups of Reiki practitioners may run regular Reiki
circles or host special Reiki events in your neighborhood. These public
events give you the opportunity to try out Reiki and ask about Reiki
practitioners in your area. The sessions are usually shorter than the
usual private session, and you may have more than one person working
on you. Read more about Reiki circles in Chapter 14.
 Look in your local newspaper. They may have ads or news stories
about Reiki practitioners.
 Call your local hospital. Some hospitals run Reiki programs or have
Reiki practitioners on staff.
Interviewing your potential practitioner
After you have the names of some professional Reiki practitioners, you can
contact them by phone or in person to see which one appears to best meet
your needs. Ask them the following questions:
 What level of Reiki are you? A professional Reiki practitioner should
have studied 2nd-degree Reiki or beyond. Read more about degrees of
Reiki in Chapter 7. Although people with 1st-degree Reiki training may
treat family members or within the setting of a Reiki circle, they don’t
have the experience to treat professionally.
 What healing systems do you use alongside Reiki, if any? Find out
whether they use other systems of healing, such as reflexology or polar-
ity therapy. Some massage therapists or other healers combine Reiki
with other healing arts. Let the practitioner know if you want a combined
session (which sometimes costs more) or want to receive only Reiki.
 What do you see as the value of Reiki, especially for me? This ques-
tion is important because it gives insight into the practitioner’s view on
how Reiki can help you. See whether the answer meshes with how you
feel about receiving Reiki.
 How many sessions do they think I will need? This answer gives you
further insight into the practitioner’s perspective on how Reiki works.
Some practitioners recommend a series of appointments, especially for
dealing with long-term illness or stress. Others take a more laid-back
approach and leave it to you to decide.
71
Chapter 5: Getting the Reiki Treatment

 How long have you have practiced Reiki? It helps if the practitioner
has been working on her own healing with Reiki or another healing
modality for at least a year if not decades! However, I’m a firm believer in
quality over quantity when it comes to practicing Reiki, as some people
work on healing for years to get to the same place as another person can
get in a year.
On a practical note, consider these questions for yourself:
 Is the location of Reiki convenient for you? The closer to home, the
easier it will be for you to get there.
 Can you afford the price of the Reiki? You’ll be more likely to repeat
your Reiki experience if you can pay the fee. If the cost is too high, speak
to the practitioner. Some Reiki professionals use a sliding fee scale.
 Can the practitioner travel to your home or office? Some Reiki practi-
tioners, like their massage therapist counterparts, take traveling Reiki
tables and travel to a location of your choice. Doing so frequently involves
a greater cost, as the price of the session includes travel expenditures.
However, this service is useful if you are homebound.
 Do you feel comfortable with this person? This, for me, is the most
important thing. For you to be able to relax, you need to have some
basic trust that the person knows what she is doing and treats you
with respect.
Trust your gut (your intuition) when choosing a Reiki practitioner. If some-
one “feels” right to you, then she is, no matter what the answers to any 
questions might be. On the same note, if someone “feels” wrong, then that
person isn’t the right one for you, no matter how well recommended the
person might be.
Preparing Yourself for Your 
First Reiki Session
Approach Reiki in a light-hearted way in order to relax and enjoy yourself. I
think you’ll be impressed with how well you feel at the end of the session.
Doing a bit of reflection before the session can help you focus and get in the
Reiki frame of mind. If you can, write down all the things you want the Reiki
session to accomplish. Your list might read something like:
72
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 

 To get rid of this headache
 To make my neck feel better
 To improve my relationship with my daughter
 To stop worrying about my marriage
By knowing what you want to get out of the session, you set the focus to
achieve just that. The practitioner might ask you, “What are your intentions
for this session?” By thinking ahead of time, you’ll know exactly what it is
you need.
I sit in my car for a couple of minutes before going to receive a Reiki session,
taking the time to breathe and meditate. Doing so helps me to be more focused
and relaxed when I enter the Reiki room.
Try not to have a heavy meal or lots of caffeine just before a session. You are
going to relax and receive energy. If your stomach is digesting or your body is
speeding, you may not feel so ready to lie down and receive a little bliss.
Exploring a Reiki Session 
from Beginning to End
Every Reiki session is unique, and the exact steps of each session depend on
the practitioner and the recipient. Given that, you’ll find a general structure
to the Reiki treatment that varies slightly from practitioner to practitioner.
The length of an average full Reiki session performed by one person is one
hour, but check with your practitioner to be sure. You might have a shorter
session, especially if Reiki is performed at a Reiki circle with more than one
practitioner (see Chapter 14).
You might lie on your back for the entire session or start on one side and be
given a gentle reminder midway to turn over.
What to expect before the session
Reiki begins when you meet and greet — or connect with — the practitioner.
Tell your practitioner if anything is troubling you so that she can address that
issue. This is the time to set intention by saying something like “I’m hoping to
relieve tension and get rid of this headache.”
73
Chapter 5: Getting the Reiki Treatment

Entering the Reiki room
Each room is different depending on the personality of the practitioner and
whether this room is dedicated to Reiki or used for different purposes.
The room can be dark, with candlelight providing the only light, or bright
with sunshine. Music may be softly playing, and you may see crystals and
flowering plants sitting on shelves or spiritual artwork hanging on the walls.
Or the room may be simple and unadorned.
Take in the relaxing ambience that is present. Breathe in the peace that is the
true purpose of your Reiki session.
Filling out forms
Your Reiki practitioner may ask you to fill in some forms before the session,
and you may have to sign some forms for legal purposes. These forms usually
ask for your name, contact information, and information about any health
issues and medications you take. The forms may include disclaimers stating
the following:
 The practitioner is not a physician and is not licensed by the state.
 Reiki serves only as a method of relaxation and stress reduction.
Some providers also ask you to commit to your part of the healing process
(see the section “Committing Yourself to Healing with Reiki,” later in this
chapter).
Lying down on the table
Most practitioners use a sturdy table that allows you to feel supported and
allows the practitioner to stand or sit while gently putting his hands on you.
If you’re short like me, you might need to use a stool to climb up on the table!
Staying comfortable
You remain fully clothed during a Reiki session, but you’ll want to take off your
shoes, tight belts, watches, eyeglasses, or outer clothing that is restrictive to
your comfort. At a spa, you may receive a robe to relax in. The practitioner
typically offers pillows to place under your neck or legs for comfort, or a blan-
ket to stay warm.
Speak up at any time during the session if you’re uncomfortable or too cold,
or if you need a tissue or want the music turned off. It’s your time to relax, so
make sure the environment is right for you!
74
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 

Undergoing the Reiki session
The Reiki session is a sacred time during which you are receiving the Reiki
energy. The practitioner might say some prayers out loud or silently to aid
her spiritual connection and good intentions for your session.
Reiki comes through the Reiki practitioner, so she prepares herself to be a
clear and open channel for the Reiki to flow to you.
The practitioner will move her hands to different parts of your body as a
way to direct the Reiki. At times her hands will lie on your body, and other
times they’ll hover above your body. You may feel a sensation of heat coming
from the practitioner’s hands. Don’t worry — this feeling is normal, but if it’s
uncomfortable for you, tell the practitioner.
Relaxing during the session
The Reiki session is a delicious experience during which you can close your
eyes and know that you have an hour of freedom. The telephone, traffic, e-mails,
or the doorbell won’t disturb you.
You may drift off into a dreamlike state or even fall asleep. Don’t worry if you
do. You’re supposed to be relaxing, so whatever you do is right for you. Try
not to judge yourself or any thoughts you might have. Just let it all flow.
Experiencing the sensations of Reiki
Each person experiences Reiki in his or her own way. You may feel tingles
or shivers during Reiki. Energy waves are passing through your body, and
everyone experiences what this feels like in a different way. I list some other
sensations you may experience during the Reiki session in Table 5-1.

75
Chapter 5: Getting the Reiki Treatment

Your intuition is heightened during a Reiki session, which is like being in the
state between waking and sleeping, so don’t be surprised if you get a dreamy
message from beyond! You may get a fleeting image or memory. You may get
insights to some long-standing problem, similar to what you might experience
during meditation or daydreaming.
There is no right or wrong, or good or bad, in anything you feel during the
Reiki session. Please just let yourself be!
Approaching the end of your session
You’ll know the session is ending when the practitioner taps you on your
shoulder or tells you, “Take your time getting up from the table.”
Don’t rush off the table. Just as you might take a little time when you wake up
in the morning before hopping out of bed, you need a little time now. You may
feel lightheaded or woozy, so you want to go slowly to avoid tripping over
your feet.
Session accomplished: After 
the Reiki session
After the session is over, you’ll put on your shoes, pay the practitioner, and
talk about your experience. The practitioner will probably ask you, “How do
you feel?” You may have some questions or comments. Sometimes the practi-
tioner will have feedback for you, such as “You look more relaxed now” or
“I sensed that you really took in the Reiki energy.” You may decide to book
another appointment.
Getting grounded
Don’t go off too soon after the session, especially if you’re driving. Take the
time to get grounded and come back to the world. You may need to sit for a
while, breathe deeply, or take a little walk to feel more grounded.
Detoxing
The relaxation process might set off a detoxification process, which is just
the removal of stuck toxins in your body. One of the ways that Reiki works is
by removing any energy blocks in your body. As stagnant energy makes its
way out of the body, unwanted toxins will leave through your urine, phlegm,
feces, or sweat. Drinking lots of water helps the process of detoxification.
Just as it’s recommended to drink water after a massage, you should also
drink water after a Reiki session.
76
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 

Maintaining that good feeling
After a Reiki session, you’ll feel good. If you can, try to keep this feeling of
relaxation going as long as you can. Take a stroll in nature, sip tea quietly in
your garden, or take a relaxing bath.
Capturing the Aha! moment
You may get inspirational messages from your Reiki session that you need to
capture on paper so you don’t forget them! Try to bring paper and a pen to
your sessions so you can write down any thoughts before they slip away. For
example, you may get an insight into a long-standing problem or get an idea
to help you at work.
What you think are your important issues when you walk into the Reiki ses-
sion may well change after the session. The insights you gather during the
session may lead you to deeper issues to address. Be thankful for the gifts of
healing and clarity that Reiki bestows upon you and be gentle on yourself as
you travel your healing path.
Probably the most important insight to gather from a Reiki session is love
and acceptance of yourself, as the sacred being that you are.
Repeating Your Reiki Experience
For most people, one Reiki session isn’t enough to satisfactorily change life-
long habits, illnesses, or thought patterns. If you’ve been a worrier type of
person all your life, one Reiki session will certainly help you. But when the
next crisis hits, will you have the ability to react in a calm way?
If you have a serious illness, multiple Reiki sessions stand a better chance
of helping you in the recovery process. For example, if you have a form of
cancer and are receiving chemotherapy, consider scheduling Reiki weekly
during this time, or schedule one Reiki session before or after each chemo
session. The more often you receive Reiki, the more it can help you cope with
the stress of your health problem.
Your Reiki practitioner will suggest how often you should visit him, or you
may have an idea of what would feel best for you. Sometimes you can get a
discount by booking multiple sessions at one time. During a stressful period
of your life, weekly sessions can keep you feeling bright-eyed and bushy-
tailed. If things are rolling along nicely, then consider monthly sessions to
keep yourself tuned up.
77
Chapter 5: Getting the Reiki Treatment

If you’re keen on Reiki but can’t get to a practitioner regularly, consider learn-
ing Reiki yourself to supplement your sessions by giving Reiki to yourself
(see Chapter 11).
Try a different Reiki practitioner if you’re not sure about the first one. Use the
suggestions I provide in the section “Finding the Right Reiki Practitioner for
You,” earlier in this chapter.
Using Reiki in Tandem 
with Other Therapies
For many ailments, you may need to use the services of more than one type
of practitioner, in addition to your Reiki practitioner. For example, you may
want to also see a psychotherapist, a massage therapist, a nutritionist, or
a medical doctor. For example, I have been feeling stressed by my father’s
death and feeling achy while sitting at the computer. A Reiki session beauti-
fully restores my balance and heals at a deep energy level. But I still visit my
chiropractor to help my body adjust on a physical level. I find that using dif-
ferent practitioners as needed brings out the best level of healing.
Reiki combines well with all the healing arts, whether they’re complementary
treatments, such as massage, or conventional medical treatments, such as
surgery or chemotherapy. Chapter 16 describes ways of combining Reiki with
other types of treatments.
78
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 
Reiki was love at first sleep
A friend in London had just learned Reiki and
offered to give me a session. I traveled to her flat,
and she performed Reiki on her sofa. I quickly
fell asleep. All that I recalled was that Reiki was
relaxing.
A year later, I got the opportunity to learn Reiki
myself while living in New Mexico. I was fortu-
nate to be living near an active Reiki community
that had Reiki circles twice a week. I experienced
Reiki from many people who lived or passed
through the area. From these gracious people, I
learned so much about Reiki — mostly that I
loved it!
I never tire of Reiki, and it helps me come into
my self. I can get lost in the everyday world of
busyness. Reiki brings me the feeling of awak-
ening from a deep relaxing sleep. I am refreshed
and ready for the challenges and joys of life.

Committing Yourself to 
Healing with Reiki
Healing with Reiki is not a completely passive process. It may seem passive
because during the Reiki session you’re lying on the table with your eyes
closed, receiving the energy transmitted through the practitioner. But you
can take action before and after the Reiki session to make the most of what
Reiki has to offer on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels.
The Reiki practitioner, and the Reiki itself, are tools you use as you grow and
heal in your life. No matter how gifted the healer or how powerful the Reiki,
you participate in the healing process by being open to growth and change.
One way that Reiki works is by helping you to be open to such change. You may
not want to change at first, but eventually as you truly desire to feel better
within yourself, you may see that certain changes will help. You may notice
changes in the following areas of your life:
 Your thought patterns: Reiki gives you insight into your underlying
thoughts and beliefs that may hold you back from achieving your goals.
Constant negative thinking brings about negative results. Positive think-
ing brings about positive results.
 Your physical lifestyle: Destructive behavior or lifestyle choices conflict
with growth and healing. For example, you may want to consider your
eating and exercise habits and possible addictive behavior. As you allow
more healing through Reiki into your life, your behaviors become health-
ier. You don’t have to force the change; you’ll want to change.
 Your relationships: How you interact with others can bring joy or grief
to yourself and people around you. Reiki can help you become calmer so
that you have more patience and tolerance with others (and yourself).
 Your job: Your paid work and other activities are another place for you to
express your true self and contribute to the world. As you become more
in touch with your inner self through Reiki, you might change your job
or your relationship to your work.
How far you go with Reiki depends on how you follow up on your Reiki ses-
sions. As a result of Reiki, you may get a thought that smoking is hurting you
or you have to start singing. To really benefit from Reiki, take the insights you
get while on the Reiki table and put them into action.

 Giving Reiki to your pets
R
eiki is a gentle universal energy and can be used for anyone of any age.
Children are particularly open to Reiki energy, and older adults can ben-
efit from the relaxing Reiki touch. Even furry, feathery, or finned family pets
can use a little Reiki! In this chapter, I describe the many ways that Reiki can
benefit you and your family members.
In this chapter, I also describe how you can be helped by the typical Reiki
session, as outlined in Chapter 5. But Reiki is flexible, and there are other
ways to give Reiki in situations where a lie-down, one-hour, hands-on ses-
sion isn’t possible. These techniques include using hands above the
body (see Chapter 10), beaming the Reiki from the other side of the room
(see Chapter 10), or even sending Reiki from another location altogether
(see Chapter 15).
Everyone responds to Reiki in his own way. You may be surprised when the
person you least expect turns out to love Reiki the most.

Helping Yourself with Reiki
Reiki is a gentle healing energy. Your body can use this energy for just about
anything it needs. Here are some common reasons to use Reiki:
 You’re stressed out and need some tender loving care.
 You’re taking doctor-prescribed medications and want to reduce or elim-
inate the side effects of these drugs.
 You’re low on energy or feel blah or unmotivated and need a pick-me-up.
 You haven’t been sleeping well.
 You feel stuck emotionally or mentally and want some insights on how
to move forward.
 You just want a delicious treat for your body, mind, and spirit.
You can think of Reiki as a dose of love. When you receive a Reiki session,
you’ll feel the effects that love can give you. This isn’t love from any partic-
ular person; it’s just the essence of love and how that can heal you.
How can Reiki help you? In oh so many ways. Reiki helps you to do the 
following:
 Relax: The desire to feel more relaxed is the main reason people try
Reiki. If you’re feeling anxious, stressed, or tense, Reiki can help you feel
calmer. When you’re feeling relaxed, your body is better able to handle
life’s ups and downs. Because Reiki aids relaxation, it can help you cope
with and heal from any problem or illness.
 Handle a physical illness: Another main reason people try Reiki is to help
overcome disease or pain. Your body is made of energy (see Chapter 2),
and Reiki helps balance your energy and remove any blocks to the flow
of energy. Reiki works not only to reduce anxiety, lessen pain, and relax
you but also works at the underlying cause of disease. I discuss how
Reiki works alongside conventional and alternative medical treatments
in Chapter 16.
In a family situation, Reiki helps to heal everything from minor scrapes
and bruises to the flu or even major accidents or long-standing illnesses.
At the very least, Reiki relaxes you enough so that you can have a better
attitude toward your illness, which helps you get better quicker.
82
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 

 Handle an emotional upset: After you suffer a loss, such as the death of
a loved one or the end of relationship, you can surely benefit from the
boost that Reiki can provide. Here are some examples of times to try
Reiki:
• When you suffer an emotional shock, such as the loss of a rela-
tive or friend: I know of a woman who benefited from Reiki after
she lost her fiancé to a sudden tragic death. Reiki was one of the
methods she used to help herself cope with this loss and rebuild
her life.
• During life transitions: Changes in life, even positive changes, can
be stressful. Moving home, starting a new job, or having a baby
can stir up the emotional pot, and Reiki can help you make sense
of your situation and feel ready for change.
• If you’re in emotional burnout: Perhaps you’re taking care of an
elderly parent, trying to be supermom to young children, or work-
ing two jobs to make ends meet. If you feel like you’re at the end of
your rope or about to fall apart, Reiki can help.
• When you’re making decisions: Suppose that you have a major
life decision to make and you feel stuck. You may be trying to
figure out whether to change a relationship or job or what course
of action to take for a business venture. Perhaps you want some
clarity about what to do about a physical ailment. Reiki helps
you relax, and while you’re relaxing, the answer just might come
to you!
 Feel spiritually connected: As you relax with Reiki, you detach from
your everyday cares and worries. Now you can hear the still voice inside
of you. You can feel peace. You’re connecting with your higher self and
with spirit. Also, some people find that Reiki helps their intuitive process,
so you just might awaken your inner psychic!
Cycling through Life with Reiki
When you use Reiki to deal with life — yours or someone else’s — it’s like
turning up the frequency on a radio a notch. Things are a little lighter and a
little brighter. These are the effects of a subtle energy such as Reiki. Any time
of life, from beginning to end and everything in between, can blossom from
Reiki.
83
Chapter 6: Letting Your Entire Family Experience Reiki

Starting with pregnancy
With pregnancy comes a slew of physical changes in the mother’s body
as the baby develops and grows. Both mother and child benefit from the
gentle energy that Reiki provides. Reiki offers some specific benefits during
pregnancy:
 Reiki doesn’t require any physical manipulation of the body. Reiki uses a
gentle touch directly on the body or even above the body.
 Reiki can be performed above blankets and in any position, so mothers-
to-be can make themselves comfortable in a sitting or lying position.
 Reiki can be performed at any time during pregnancy.
 The baby can also be treated with Reiki with hands directly on the
mother’s belly or with Reiki hands hovering above. When a baby starts
getting Reiki, he may respond, so watch out for moving and kicking!
84
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 
Reiki at the beginning of life
Here are two people’s accounts of how Reiki
can be used before and during birth.
Anita tells the story of the birth of a healthy son
to her and her husband, aided by Rachel, a Reiki
practitioner, and the medical staff: “When I
found out that I was pregnant, I was a little con-
cerned because of my age (42). I began to
receive Reiki every Friday until the birth of my
son. My delivery was difficult and very painful.
Although the Reiki could not completely take
away the pain, it helped me be sure that my son
was 100 percent okay, and I knew he was
healthy and safe. I trusted Rachel. I felt very
connected to God during this time, and I know
that the energy was working for the highest
good for all of us. I believe that if I had not
received Reiki during the delivery of my son, I
would have not made it through the miracle of
birth. My son is healthy, bright, and full of
energy. He asks me for Reiki all the time. He is
really a Reiki baby; he even attends a Reiki
circle on Friday nights. Reiki has truly been a gift
from above.”
Rachel, the Reiki practitioner, shares her story:
“Reiki has helped me in many aspects of my life
and also has given me such beautiful gifts. I
have had the privilege to administer Reiki to
several women during their pregnancies and
the delivery of two. From the day that Anita
knew she was pregnant, I and our circle of
practitioners gave her Reiki weekly, and I was
present during the delivery of her son. With
each of Anita’s contractions, I felt the energy
even stronger and felt more connected to Anita
and her child. Her delivery was quite difficult,
and they wanted to do a C-section. Reiki helped
her have a regular delivery.”

The purpose of Reiki is to bring out the highest good for the people being
treated, which means both mother and child!
Cherishing childhood with Reiki
Reiki and children are natural partners. Children intuitively understand the
subtle energy of Reiki (see Chapter 2 for info about subtle energy). For moth-
ers, fathers, grandparents, and any guardian or caretaker of children, learning
Reiki lets them give energy to their children.
A mother’s touch is a particularly powerful healing force for children. If a
mother is attuned to Reiki (meaning she has become a channel for Reiki
energy; see Chapter 7), she’ll transmit Reiki through her touch. The same
is true for fathers and all who care for children!
Receiving Reiki
You can give Reiki to newborn infants, toddlers, or school-age children. Reiki
can help your child do the following:
 Relax before exams or tryouts
 Relax before starting a new school
 Cope with a loss of a family member
 Fight a cold or flu
 Heal sprains or broken bones
 Relax when a new baby arrives or before or after a move to a new town
Generally, younger children require a shorter Reiki period than adults.
(This is true of animals also.) But, if a child is ill, then she might absorb
Reiki for a longer period.
Children don’t express themselves in the same way as adults, but they also
feel stress and emotional turmoil. Reiki can be very helpful for emotional or
physical ailments.
Practicing Reiki
Some children express an interest in learning Reiki too. They may be attracted
to it after receiving a Reiki session, or they may follow your progress as you
learn Reiki and want to learn alongside you.
85
Chapter 6: Letting Your Entire Family Experience Reiki

If you are a Reiki Master teacher, then you can attune children as feels appro-
priate. Start with 1st-level Reiki and see how the child responds. You should
modify any class for children because they don’t need to learn all the history
or methodology at this point.
When children are attuned to Reiki, they can help give Reiki to a family
member, friend, or pet who is sick. Doing so empowers children by letting
them contribute to the well-being of others.
Traipsing through the teenage 
years with Reiki
Reiki has a lot to offer teens going through the trials and tribulations of grow-
ing up into adulthood. Some teens show a great deal of interest in Reiki. They
may be interested in spiritual or healing pursuits or just may want to join Dad
in his Reiki studies.
Receiving Reiki
Teens may benefit from a Reiki session that is as long as that for an adult (see
Chapter 5), but always respect their wishes if they want a shorter session.
Actually, that advice applies to anyone of any age.
Reiki really works well with teenagers. They need the relief from the stress of
all the changes in their bodies and feelings.
Practicing Reiki
Teenagers may express an interest in studying Reiki. Depending on their
maturity and level of interest, they can study Reiki alongside adults.
Ask the Reiki teacher to meet the teen to determine the best type of training.
See Chapter 7 to read about Reiki training and how to find a Reiki teacher.
Some Reiki teachers give special classes for children or teens in addition to
classes for adults.
Learning Reiki can be quite empowering for young adults because they can use
it to boost their energy and deal with the trials and tribulations of teenage
years. Reiki may be just the thing to help them through relationship, school,
and family woes. When teens see all that Reiki can do (see Chapters 18 and 19),
they’ll probably agree that this therapy is pretty cool.
86
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 

Teenagers enjoy giving Reiki on a volunteer basis. Whether at a Reiki circle
(see Chapter 14) or an animal clinic, a Reiki-trained teenager is eager to add
her hands alongside others.
Gracing the senior years with Reiki
Reiki can ease the aging process by helping adults stay calm in the face of
changing health and lifestyle situations. Because Reiki is so gentle, it can be
used no matter what the health situation. In Chapter 16, I describe how Reiki
complements different health treatments.
Receiving Reiki
Adults may have more aches and pains or have to deal with increasing num-
bers of health issues as they age. Reiki can be very useful to help elders stay
relaxed and help the body’s internal resources work better. Any time is a
good time to get a Reiki session, but Reiki may be especially beneficial for
people who
 Are undergoing a life transition such as divorce, the death of a spouse, a
move, or retirement. Reiki brings a feeling of calm and of being centered.
 Are worried and stressed. Reiki brings relaxation.
 Have an illness. As people age, healing takes longer. Reiki may speed up
the healing process (see Chapter 16).
 Want a pick-me-up. Everyone deserves to experience an energy boost, or
even some moments of bliss.
87
Chapter 6: Letting Your Entire Family Experience Reiki
Reiki in the family
When more than one person in the family has
some Reiki training, you can share Reiki experi-
ences with each other. You can attend Reiki cir-
cles or retreats (see Chapter 14), work on
Grandma as a Reiki team, and share your
adventures learning about Reiki together.
Don’t be disappointed if your child or mate loses
interest in Reiki after a while. They may not share
the same level of interest in Reiki as you do, but
that doesn’t mean they don’t like Reiki or you!
Let each person in your family use Reiki in the
way that’s comfortable for her. Not everyone is
destined to practice Reiki every single day or
even weekly or monthly. Remember that after
people are trained, they are “attuned” to Reiki for
life. They can always use Reiki — if they want to.

Reiki can be a breather during a difficult time!
Practicing Reiki
In your own senior years, you may have more time on your hands. The chil-
dren have grown up and moved on, and your work may have slowed down.
This is a perfect time to learn Reiki.
You may find that you want to learn Reiki for one of the following reasons:
 To help yourself deal with illness: You can give yourself Reiki treatments
(see Chapter 11).
 To help your spouse or friend with an illness: As a caretaker of another,
Reiki is a valuable aid (see Chapter 16).
 To help yourself grow spiritually: Reiki opens your energy channels,
allowing you to see more clearly. Read about energy systems in the
body in Chapter 2 and personal growth with Reiki in Chapter 19.
 As a tool for manifestation: You’ll feel empowered by using Reiki to help
you achieve your goals. A friend of mine used Reiki to help empower her
goal of moving out of her family home that she had lived in for 36 years.
She used the manifestations techniques (see a sidebar on the topic in
Chapter 1) to pave the way to move into her first home of her own at the
age of 66!
Check out Chapter 7 to find out about Reiki classes and teachers. Your
wisdom and experience gained over the years will certainly aid you as a
Reiki practitioner.
88
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 
Energy is ageless and forever
Reiki knows no age limitations and is as useful in
the last stages of life as it is at the beginning. It’s
a shame that many people fear the aging process
and see it only as a loss of health and opportunity.
Many forget the wisdom and depth of perception
that is a blessing of age and experience.
As long as you are here on earth, you have the
opportunity to experience and share love and joy.
It can be a simple act, such as enjoying the smile
of a child or the feel of a warm breeze. If you are
feeling down, a change in perspective can open
you to feel better within yourself. Reiki can pro-
vide this type of change by helping you connect
to an inner sense of calm, peace, and bliss.
Reiki works with energy, which is the part of you
that never dies. Reiki connects you to your soul
and spirit. Reiki helps you deal gracefully with
whatever challenges come your way by helping
you connect with the deeper part of yourself
that never dies.

Concluding life with Reiki
Just as Reiki is valuable during entry into life during birth, Reiki is also help-
ful at the end-of-life transition. Hospitals, hospices, and nursing homes are
becoming knowledgeable about Reiki because of the value this treatment
has for patients and their families (see Chapter 16). See the sidebar “Reiki at
the end of life: A personal journey” for my own Reiki experience with loved
ones near death. To read about how hospitals and hospices use Reiki, see
Chapter 16.
89
Chapter 6: Letting Your Entire Family Experience Reiki
Reiki at the end of life: A personal journey
I was honored to be able to use Reiki with both
of my parents at the end of their lives.
My mother was unconscious after suffering a
severe intracerebral hemorrhage and was on
life-support systems. When I heard of her situ-
ation, I sent distant Reiki (see Chapter 15) while
flying on the airplane to get to her. As she lay
in the intensive care unit, I was able to use
Reiki on areas of her body that were free from
machinery, especially her hands and feet.
Although the Reiki didn’t keep her alive, it
helped me feel that I could do something to
ease her situation.
My dad died at home, just days after signing on
with hospice. He was conscious until moments
before his death and requested Reiki from me
hours before his death. My dad was a strong,
proud man. I don’t remember him ever staying
home from work, and he enjoyed robust health
until he got older and his heart and lungs devel-
oped disease. He was interested in the fact that
I did Reiki, but he never wanted to try it. As his
illness progressed, he talked about trying Reiki
but was never ready to do so. When drugs no
longer helped him, he finally was ready to try
Reiki. He wanted to start with someone other
than me, so we found George, an older gentle-
man with enthusiasm for Reiki. George brought
light and hope to my dad’s bedroom. My dad
was able to let go of his oxygen for the duration
of the session and a short time afterward. After
the session, my dad was quiet and looked
peaceful and contemplative.
The next day was to be my dad’s last. His 
condition was worsening, and I offered him
Reiki, which he accepted two different times.
He particularly wanted the peace that Reiki
offered.
I was next to my Dad when he moved toward his
death. I gently let my hands transmit Reiki as my
sister and I spoke words of love.
My sister asked me afterward if Reiki hastened
my dad’s death. I don’t know about that, but I do
know it brought him peace. I believe it also
aided his transition to the next world.
I was amazed that my dad had finally accepted
Reiki, a gentle, beautiful energy. This was a gift
not only for him but also for my family and me.

From an energy perspective, energy is never destroyed, but it does change
form. Death is a transition from life on earth as we know it to the afterlife.
Reiki aids this transition by transmitting the pure energy of love, which gives
relief and peace.
Using Reiki for the Family Pet
Animals also benefit from Reiki. Whether you have cats, dogs (see Figure 6-1),
birds, fish, or ferrets, you can use Reiki to help your pets. Don’t forget your
horse or other large animals, who also benefit from Reiki.
Any animal that receives regular grooming from a human is probably recep-
tive to being touched for Reiki. If you want to give Reiki to an animal who is
not usually touched, such as fish or wild animals, use techniques where you
give Reiki from afar, such as beaming (see Chapter 10) and distant Reiki (see
Chapter 15).

Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 

Knowing when and where 
to go for Reiki
Reiki works well with animals for the same reasons it works well on children
and people of all ages. Have you ever noticed that when you pet an animal, he
rolls over to receive more or looks at you with lovey-dovey eyes or sighs?
Animals respond to your loving touch and intention. Reiki is another way to
help your animals feel better.
You can give Reiki to animals in the following situations:
 When they are ill: Reiki helps the healing process and works with any
type of medical intervention.
 When they are young or old: You can use Reiki on an animal of any age
or situation.
 When they have been through a trauma: Animals can use loving energy
after they’ve experienced any type of abuse, loss, or move, or if they
seem to exhibit depression or other behavioral disorder. Even if you
don’t know what the problem is, you can use Reiki to help.
Finding the right pet practitioner
If your pet can travel, you can take him to a Reiki clinic. You may find that a
pet trainer, pet groomer, or breeder also offers Reiki services. Here are some
suggestions for finding a Reiki practitioner for your animal friend:
 Any Reiki practitioner can give Reiki to your pet, although some practi-
tioners specialize in giving Reiki to animals.
 Animal lovers who work as animal handlers or in veterinarian’s offices
are taking Reiki training so they can use Reiki in their work. Some Reiki
practitioners specialize in treating animals or even a particular type of
animal.
 In some cities, you may find Reiki clinics for pets! Obviously, you need to
have an animal who can travel and behave among other animals.
 You can learn Reiki yourself (see Chapter 7) so you can help your 
animals.
91
Chapter 6: Letting Your Entire Family Experience Reiki

Listening to animals
Animals differ in their responsiveness to Reiki depending on their illness, per-
sonality, and how well they know you. Here’s how you can read an animal to
determine how to administer Reiki:
 An animal may screech, fly, growl, hiss, or run away as a way of telling
you it doesn’t want to be touched. In that case, you can use distant Reiki
or beaming techniques.
 An animal may let you perform hands-on Reiki but then shift positions or
look at you funny. Move your hands a few inches above the body and
continue Reiki, if you feel that it’s still needed.
 An animal may tell you it wants Reiki by coming near you when you are
giving Reiki to yourself or someone else.
 If you’re lucky, an animal will move itself so you can give Reiki exactly
where it’s needed.
Follow all the suggestions and guidelines for a session with animals just as
you would for your most beloved relative. Read Chapters 9, 10, and 13 before
treating an animal.
92
Part II: Experiencing Reiki for Yourself 
Reiki and the horse named Bandit
Bandit was a beloved horse who was instru-
mental in a therapeutic program to help children
and adults with special needs. One day, he had
an accident in which he landed on his side and
dislocated some of his spine. He was unable to
move, and his heartbroken owner didn’t know if
she would have to have him euthanized. She
wanted to know how to help this horse who had
helped so many.
A group of Reiki practitioners, including one
who specialized in massage and Reiki for
horses, gave Reiki three times a day for quite
some time in order to get Bandit into the trailer
so he could go to the vet for a bone scan to
assess the damage. If his damage was severe,
humane euthanasia was the only option.
The good news was that Bandit’s injuries could
be healed, so his Reiki treatments continued.
When the treatments stopped, Bandit was
reportedly not only healed but was also better
than before the treatments! He had a bigger
stride after treatment than before.
Nine years later, Bandit did have to be eutha-
nized because of old age and complications of
emphysema. But his owner and other friends
gave him Reiki at the end of his life, and he
reportedly leaned into the Reiki practitioners’
hands so as to suck up the Reiki energy.
Bandit’s owner is a Reiki practitioner who uses
Reiki to help all the horses that she uses in her
program.

Using different techniques
If you feel comfortable or get an intuitive message to get closer to an animal,
you can then try performing Reiki with your hands hovering above the pet
(see Chapter 10). You can eventually move into an actual hands-on session.
Adapt the techniques used for humans to animals. Because animals can’t give
their express permission for you to perform Reiki, make sure you approach
any animal in a slow and respectful manner when starting to give Reiki. Doing
so gives the animal the opportunity to understand what you are doing and
lets the animal make his feelings known.
You may want to start by beaming Reiki to the animal from across the room
(see Chapter 10) or sending distant Reiki (see Chapter 15). These techniques
may be sufficient for treating an animal.
Intention is the single most important factor in the success of a Reiki treat-
ment. Intend or pray for the highest level of healing for the animal and that
you be a pure channel of Reiki energy. Healing is not from you, but through
you. Be clear about your role as a Reiki healer and why you are treating the
animal. See Chapters 9 and 13 for more information about preparations
before and after a Reiki session.
Here are the general techniques to use on animals:
 Distant Reiki: This type of Reiki can be performed from anywhere, so
you don’t need to be near the animal to do this. See Chapter 15 for tips
on performing Reiki from afar. You can use this technique to treat any
trauma an animal might have suffered in the past or to help the animal
with any event in the future.
 Beaming Reiki from across the room: When you are with the animal,
start with beaming to connect with the animal from a safe distance. You
and Rover then get a chance to connect with each other before moving
closer. See Chapter 10 for more information. I have used this method of
healing for animals in zoos or aquariums.
 Reiki with hands hovering over the body: Some pets tolerate this type
of Reiki for a longer period of time than hands-on Reiki. See Chapter 10
for more information. My cat tolerates hands-on healing for just so long.
When I get “the look,” I move my hands off the body.
 Hands-on Reiki: Adapt the standard hand positions for humans (see
Chapter 10) to your pet. Some animals are much smaller, but the basic
idea of anatomy is the same.
 Group Reiki: For larger animals, especially horses or large dogs, a few
people can perform Reiki simultaneously, sending much love and healing
at once. See Chapter 14 for more information on group healing.
93
Chapter 6: Letting Your Entire Family Experience Reiki

Giving Reiki to a sick animal helps the human companions of animals as
much as it helps the animals themselves.
As is the case for humans, Reiki healing sometimes leads to a curing of an
animal’s illness, but it may also lead to a peaceful death. Reiki doesn’t change
the natural order of events, but it enhances the experience by giving a dose
of love.

n Part III, you advance in your knowledge of Reiki so
you can start helping yourself and others.
To get attuned to the Reiki energy, start studying with a
Reiki Master Teacher. I describe how to find a Reiki class,
the different levels of Reiki training, and what you might
expect from your classes. This part covers the Reiki sym-
bols, techniques to connect you with the Reiki energy, and
techniques (mostly different hand positions) for treating
others.
Don’t forget to put yourself first! You can best help people
with Reiki after you learn to use it on yourself, so this part
explains how to give yourself a Reiki treatment.
Many practitioners use crystals as a special add-on to
Reiki, so I discuss that topic, too.

B
y taking a Reiki class, you’ll be initiated to the Reiki spiritual energy and
also learn techniques so you can use Reiki to help yourself and others.
Consider Reiki training when you’re ready to move forward with Reiki.
Reiki training is usually separated into three successive levels, but the classes
themselves come in different shapes and sizes. In this chapter, I discuss what
to look for in a Reiki teacher and class, how classes are organized, and what to
do to maximize your experience before you get to class and after you take the
class.
From the 1st-degree Reiki level, you gain the ability to channel Reiki energy
and treat yourself and your family members. You can stop there, or you can
advance farther so that you can treat other people, use Reiki symbols, and
give other people Reiki attunements (initiations).
After you’ve been initiated with Reiki, your ability to channel Reiki lasts for
life, and you’ll find that the more you use it, the stronger it gets.

Examining Reasons to Study Reiki
People study Reiki for a variety of reasons. You may simply have a strong 
personal desire to learn Reiki, or perhaps you want to join your sister or 
husband in their Reiki adventures. The benefits of Reiki are as endless as
the energy supply itself. Here are some of the reasons that you may want to
study Reiki:
 To enhance your personal growth: You may already meditate or practice
yoga or T’ai Chi and want to learn the methods of Reiki to supplement
your spiritual practice. Or you may be new to conscious spiritual growth.
Wherever you are, you’ll find help with Reiki. See Chapter 19 to find out
about using Reiki for personal growth.
 To heal yourself of a chronic illness: At the very least, Reiki can help
you deal with anxiety or stress and help you calm down or sleep at
night. See Chapter 16 for information about combining Reiki with other
therapies.
 To help a sick or ailing relative: Find out how to give a Reiki session in
Chapter 13.
 To use Reiki in your healthcare practice as a
• Nurse
• Doctor
• Psychotherapist
• Massage therapist
• Other healing practitioner
 To use Reiki for your pets: You can give your beloved pet some Reiki
just as you would for a child or friend. Read about using Reiki with ani-
mals in Chapter 6.
 To use Reiki in your animal care practice: You can use Reiki whether
you work in a veterinary clinic or at a zoo or aquarium.
 To run your own Reiki business: If you want to eventually have a
Reiki business of your own, start by taking the classes and finding 
out as much as you can about Reiki and being a Reiki practitioner
(see Chapter 13).
For all of you, taking a Reiki class will help you achieve your goals. I wager
that it will also help you in other ways that you may not have even imagined.
For as you receive the Reiki energy attunement, or initiation (see the section
“Answering Questions about Attunements,” later in this chapter), your energy
levels are heightened, and change and growth are inevitable!

Asking the Right Questions about 
Reiki Classes and Teachers
You can find Reiki teachers by the same methods you would use to find a
Reiki practitioner (see Chapter 5).
To find a Reiki teacher, ask your friends, family, and massage therapist or chi-
ropractor if they have a personal recommendation. Visit a local Reiki circle
(see Chapter 14) to meet prospective teachers, and check out the resources
in the appendix.
The International Association of Reiki Professionals (IARP) has a Reiki teacher
code of ethics that’s listed in the appendix. Use this list to give you an idea of
an ideal teacher and Reiki learning experience.
In deciding which teacher is for you, start by determining what it is that you
want to get out of Reiki training.
The types of questions to ask a potential teacher depend on your motive for
learning Reiki. If you’re on a spiritual quest, you may be looking for different
qualities than if you want to use Reiki in your medical practice.
Consider these questions for a prospective teacher:
 What is your experience practicing and teaching Reiki?
Experience is measured not only by years but also by the level of inter-
est and commitment to the practice. For example, a person can teach
one class a year or one a month. A teacher can give sessions to family
members or have a full-time Reiki practice. Other things may also matter
to you. For example, you may want to know whether your Reiki teacher
is involved in Reiki circles, shares, or hospital visits or whether your
teacher is also a nurse or healthcare practitioner.
 What is your Reiki branch and lineage?
Reiki has many different branches that differ from each other, especially in
the way that Reiki is taught and passed on. The lineage is the “genealogy”
of your teacher traced back to Mikao Usui (see Chapter 3 for a discus-
sion of lineage). Though all Reiki branches channel the same energy, the
way that Reiki is practiced can differ. Your teacher uses the methods in
which she has been trained.
 Can I contact you after the class?
A teacher is hopefully willing to answer your burning questions after the
class and provides an e-mail address or telephone number.
99
Chapter 7: Seeking Reiki Training and Classes

Ask questions about the class itself:
 Can I get a class outline?
Look for a class that provides plenty of time for hands-on work where you
practice Reiki techniques. You want to get enough practical experience to
take away with you. Also make sure the class has a question-and-answer
period.
 Are there any prerequisites for this class?
Some teachers won’t let you take 2nd-degree Reiki with them, for exam-
ple, if your 1st-degree Reiki was with another teacher.
 How long does it take to complete the class?
Is this a one-day class or a weekend? How many sessions will you
attend?
 How many students are in the class?
You may have a private class in which you’re the only student, or you
may be in a large class. As long as you’re able to ask any questions you
might have and get hands-on practice of Reiki techniques, the number of
people in the class is not a huge issue. Personally, I prefer smaller classes
with between two and eight students.
Consider the costs and benefits to you.
 What can I do with Reiki after this class?
If you have a specific goal in mind, such as practicing Reiki on others or
teaching Reiki, ask the teacher if the class will adequately prepare you.
 What type of certificate will I receive?
Different branches of Reiki and indeed teachers within branches
provide different types of certificates. Generally, you receive separate
certificates for the three separate levels of Reiki training. Make sure
100
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 
When the student is ready, the teacher appears
When you’re conscious about working with
spiritual energy, you’ll recognize coincidences
more and more. For example, teachers always
show up when they’re needed. I have found
the statement that “when the student is ready,
the teacher appears” to be true for me.
Sometimes I don’t realize that I am ready to
learn something until it appears right under
my nose!
In some cases, the teacher is a life situation or
challenge. In other cases, a person suddenly
shows up, just when you need him. If you’re
ready to learn Reiki, you’ll find a teacher.

you’ll get a certificate at the successful completion of the class. Find out
what you need to do to get the certificate.
 What is the cost of the class?
Find out the exact cost of the class. Does the teacher only accept cash
or also credit cards? Do you have to pay a deposit in advance? Can you
get a refund if you can’t attend the class?
Add any other questions that are important to you.
Knowing the Reiki Classes 
and Certification
The first thing to know about Reiki classes and certification is that standards
differ among Reiki branches and individual Reiki teachers. Unlike healing
therapies such as massage or nursing, there are currently no state-mandated
requirements or licensing procedures for Reiki. As a result, Reiki is more
freely available, but it also means that comparing courses isn’t easy. Still,
Table 7-1 gives you an idea of Reiki class levels (or degrees) and what to
expect from them.
Certification in Reiki means that the teacher has printed his own certificate,
or it is available from a particular branch of Reiki. This is not a state-level 
certification but simply means that you have a piece of paper saying you 
finished a class.

Chapter 7: Seeking Reiki Training and Classes

Read Chapter 3 to find out about Reiki branches and lineages. Talk to people
you know who are Reiki practitioners and see which branch you would like to
study under.
Different types of Reiki courses
When you start looking for a Reiki class, you’ll find all sorts of possibilities.
Here are the types of classes you’ll find:
 Traditional in-person classes: Here you will get the benefit of meeting
the teacher and other students and learning in a classroom setting. You
can watch the teacher perform Reiki and discuss issues and questions
as they come up in person. The classes range in length:
• Weekend: Some teachers give all three degrees of Reiki in two- or
three-day workshops. This class is geared for the busy person who
wants to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible.
• Longer periods of time: These classes vary from weeks to months
to years to complete all levels of Reiki. The period between levels
of Reiki (see the section “Looking at individual Reiki levels,” later
in this chapter) allows you to incorporate the energy and informa-
tion of each class before moving to the next.
The cost of these classes varies by teacher, but they are generally in the
range of hundreds of dollars rather than thousands of dollars.
 Long-distance classes: The benefit here is lower cost, or even free
attunements. But you miss the benefits of an in-person teacher-student
relationship. Here are the types of distance classes:
• Video: Some teachers send attunements through a video that you
can watch at home. The advantage of a video is that you can watch
it repeatedly.
• Internet or telephone long distance: You can obtain long-distance
attunements over the telephone or Internet. Many attunements
obtained this way are free or low cost, which is the major appeal.
The quality for all classes varies. Follow the suggestions in the section
“Asking the Right Questions about Reiki Classes and Teachers,” earlier in
this chapter.
102
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

If you can afford it, in-person classes win hands down over long-distance
classes because you get to see the teacher perform and discuss Reiki, learn
how to draw and pronounce the Reiki symbols, and get experience in giving
a Reiki session — all with the guidance of the teacher right beside you! You
also get to meet other Reiki students and practice on each other. In addition,
you learn the all-important ethics of Reiki practice.
When you want to practice Reiki professionally in any way, in-person classes
are the ticket. Reiki may be simple, but using Reiki with integrity means doing
your honorable best to have the training and experience to do so.
What you put into your training is what you get out of it.
Preparing for your Reiki class
To get the most out of your Reiki training, follow your teacher’s suggestions,
which probably include some variation on the following:
 Read any materials you teacher has prepared or suggests. This goes
without saying, right?
 Read through this book. The more you prepare, the better able you’ll be
to understand what is presented in class.
 Meditate or take walks through nature. Connect with your spiritual side.
 Think about what you want to get out of the class. When you know what
you want, you can set that intention rolling.
 Avoid alcohol, illegal drugs, and nicotine for at least a day or week
before class.
 Try to eat lightly and avoid stimulants such as caffeine or sugar on the
day before and day of the class.
You’re trying to keep your body somewhat pure to get the most out of the
attunement process.
Looking at individual Reiki levels
Here is a rundown of the different levels of Reiki classes and what you can
expect in each of the three levels.
103
Chapter 7: Seeking Reiki Training and Classes

Reiki 1st-degree course
This class is your entry to Reiki. You receive one or more attunements to the
Reiki energy. I describe attunements in the section “Answering Questions
about Attunements,” later in this chapter. Now your channel to Reiki energy
is open!
You find out the basics about Reiki so you can help yourself (with self-Reiki),
help family members, and know enough about the history to explain to others
what Reiki is and where it came from.
Topics
Here are the standard topics covered in most 1st-degree courses:
 What Reiki is and what Reiki can do: This class covers the basics of
Reiki, including some of the information in Chapters 1 and 2.
 The history of Reiki: You find out about Mikao Usui and other Reiki
founders as described in Chapter 3.
 The lineage of Reiki: Your teacher may provide a handout showing
how you are now connected by a series of different teachers back to
Mikao Usui.
No Reiki symbols are taught in 1st-degree Reiki.
Techniques
You’ll find out about the following techniques in 1st-degree Reiki:
 Self-Reiki hand positions: Not only will you learn how to give yourself
Reiki, but you’ll also be advised to do so on a daily basis after the class.
See Chapter 11 for info about self-Reiki.
 Reiki hand positions to treat others: You’ll practice the basic hand posi-
tions on other students in the class (see Chapter 10 for illustrations of
Reiki hand positions and techniques).
First-degree Reiki may be taught on its own or in combination with the 2nd-
degree course. In some cases, your teacher will ask you to wait between
classes so the attunement can do its work before you move on to the next
level.
104
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Reiki 2nd-degree course
You enroll for the second level of Reiki training when you want to know more
about Reiki and become a practitioner. This training advances your spiritual
growth and trains you to provide Reiki to others in person or at a distance.
Topics
If the following topics weren’t covered in your first-level class, they surely
will be discussed at the second level of Reiki training:
 Designing a Reiki healing session
 Understanding the ethics of treating others
 Performing distant Reiki
For information about performing a Reiki session and maintaining a code of
honor in your work, see Chapter 13.
Reiki symbols
Many people study 2nd-level Reiki because they want to use the Reiki sym-
bols. The following symbols are taught:
 Power symbol: Cho Ku Rei
 Mental and Emotional symbol: Sei Hei Ki
 Distance symbol: Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen
You find out how to draw these symbols and how to use them in Chapter 8.
Techniques
You find out how to use the symbols when you channel Reiki. You use these
for two techniques:
 Distant Reiki treatments (see Chapter 15)
 Self-treatment and treating others
After taking a 2nd-degree Reiki course, you’re usually considered to be a Reiki
practitioner.
105
Chapter 7: Seeking Reiki Training and Classes

Reiki 3rd-degree course: Master course
The Master level of Reiki is sometimes split into two levels of classes: IIIa and
IIIb or Advanced Reiki Techniques (ART) and Master Teacher. Each Reiki
branch or school may use different names to denote the two levels.
Some schools of Reiki require waiting six months or more between 2nd-degree
Reiki and the Master course or between the ART and Master Teacher courses.
The idea behind waiting is that you integrate your experience from the earlier
course so you’re better prepared for the later course.
Topics
Master’s level topics include the following:
 Becoming a Reiki Master
 Mastering yourself
 Finding out how to teach Reiki
 Going farther with Reiki
Reiki symbols
You learn to use the Master’s level symbol Dai Ko Myo. In some branches of
Reiki, you may also learn the Raku, Tibetan Dai Ko Myo (Dumo), or Tibetan
Fire Symbol. I describe these nontraditional Reiki symbols in Chapter 21.
Techniques
You discover how to perform all levels of attunement and how to teach Reiki
classes.
In each of the Reiki levels, your teacher will include additional techniques,
such as some that I explain throughout the book. As the additional material
varies widely, it’s best to check with your teacher beforehand.
Defining Reiki Master
A full Reiki Master, which is sometimes called a Reiki Master Teacher, is
simply someone who has studied the Master Reiki symbol and has been
trained to give attunements to others. Nowadays, training to become a Reiki
Master takes anywhere from one day to a few days and in some cases a year
or longer.
106
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

In the past, becoming a Master took longer, but recent developments in Reiki
provide training more quickly. For this reason, what you can expect in a Reiki
Master differs widely.
A true Reiki Master understands that the word Master is about mastering
themselves. A Reiki Master helps other people to follow the path of mastering
themselves. Ultimately, each person is responsible for his or her own healing
and spiritual growth. You can find a Reiki Master to help you, but your jour-
ney is your own. If you become a Reiki Master, you are given the tools to
empower yourself, but what you do with them and how you help others is
up to you.
In some ways the name Master is unfortunate because it implies a mastery
that does not always exist and which for many is a lifetime endeavor. The
word teacher is probably more appropriate.
Some Reiki schools differentiate between Reiki Master and Reiki Master
Teacher. In many cases, the term Reiki Master implies that the person is also
a teacher. Unfortunately, there is no consistency in these designations among
schools of Reiki. Ask your teacher if you have any questions about the titles.
Answering Questions about Attunements
The Reiki attunements are a form of initiation that opens you to a higher
vibration of energy and gives you the ability to channel Reiki energy. What
this means is that your body has been tuned into the high-level Reiki energy.
With each successive attunement, you receive a higher or finer level of energy.
After you have been attuned, you are open to the Reiki energy for life.
The attunement is the most mysterious and intriguing part of Reiki (after the
symbols). In the following sections, I answer some of your questions.
Do I need to receive an attunement 
to access this high-level energy?
No. But few people are naturally attuned to this energy. Very spiritual people
(think monks and saints) through their spiritual practice may already access
this energy.
107
Chapter 7: Seeking Reiki Training and Classes

Practitioners of other energy work, such as T’ai Chi or Qigong, may also 
utilize this type of energy, but it may take years or decades of practice to 
consistently reach this energy.
What is unique about Reiki is that it opens your energy channels to receive
this high-level energy quickly and with no effort on your part.
What about repeating attunements?
By all means, you can repeat the attunement process. In Western Reiki, the
attunement process is considered complete and permanent. You are opened
to the Reiki energy of each level, and no further attunements are necessary.
But repeat attunements can be performed and are helpful, especially if you
haven’t been using Reiki for a while.
By using Reiki regularly after the attunement, you keep the channels open
and growing.
In the traditional Japanese Reiki branches, a different type of attunement
called a reiju is performed. This more subtle type of attunement is intended
to be performed regularly. It can be likened more to osmosis, in which the
energy of the recipient is elevated just by being in the presence of the Reiki
Master who intends for your channels to open.
What will happen to me 
during the attunement?
Like a Reiki session, you can experience a number of different sensations
during the attunement (see Chapter 5 for more about experiencing a Reiki
session).
I am a visually oriented person, and at different attunements, I have “seen”
fire and water, symbols, or spiritual masters or just felt blissful. Other people
hear things, see colors, or feel different sensations. It is a personal mystical
experience.
If you have asked for a message from the attunement, an answer to your
question may come during the time of the attunement or just afterward.
108
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

What happens after the attunement?
The period after an attunement (especially the first attunement of a particu-
lar level) is considered a time of cleansing and change. This is a period when
the rest of you (your thoughts, behavior, and so on) will catch up with the
higher level of spiritual energy you are now channeling.
For you to be ready to channel high-level energy, any blocks in you are
removed or minimized. You can liken an attunement to a bulldozer coming in
and removing any blocks to the Reiki energy being channeled through you.
Many teachers suggest that this cleansing period occurs over a period of 21
days. In Reiki, this number derives from the number of days that Mikao Usui
meditated and fasted on Mount Kurama (see Chapter 3). You will have your
own period of cleansing.
You may find that the period after an attunement feels like a detoxification
period, so drink a lot of water and get enough rest.

Discovering the Reiki Symbols
In This Chapter
 Seeing the significance of the symbols in Reiki
 Discovering how to draw and say the Usui Reiki symbols
 Uncovering each Usui Reiki Symbol
 Connecting to the symbols
 Going beyond the Usui Reiki symbols
A
distinctive feature of Reiki is the use of a set of symbols to help the
practitioner connect with universal healing energy. By symbol, I mean
an image or word that evokes the Reiki energy. The symbols work as keys
that unlock the flow of Reiki energy.
Although you don’t absolutely need the symbols to access Reiki energy, they
are useful tools, especially if you’re new to Reiki or energy healing.
Reiki founder Mikao Usui (see Chapter 3) designated four different symbols;
the first three symbols are taught in 2nd-degree Reiki training, and the
fourth Master’s symbol is taught in 3rd-degree Reiki training (see Chapter 7).
Nowadays, you are initiated to the symbols during what is called the attune-
ment process.
In this chapter I discuss the use of symbols in Reiki and present the four Usui
Reiki symbols. I hope to answer some of your burning questions about this
hot topic.

If you’re interested in alternative or nontraditional Reiki symbols, check out
Chapter 21.
After you’re attuned to Reiki with the symbols, those symbols will forever
be linked in your consciousness to Reiki. Reiki flows whether or not you 
consciously use the symbols. As you develop in your Reiki practice, you
can decide for yourself how often and where and when you use the 
symbol.
Understanding Reiki Symbols
The symbols themselves are listed in Table 8-1 and further described later in
this chapter. In this section I describe the significance of the symbols to the
Reiki system.
The two most important things to know about the Reiki symbols are
 Reiki can do no harm. If someone wants to do harm, he can’t do so with
the Reiki symbols or energy.
 Reiki symbols connect you with the Reiki energy. Each Reiki symbol
takes you to the Reiki energy by way of different “entrances” to the
“house of Reiki energy.”
Symbols are used in two different ways to connect with Reiki energy:
 During the attunement or initiation process: The teacher uses symbols
to pass the symbols and energy linked together to you. You receive an
attunement at every level of Reiki training (see Chapter 7).
 During a Reiki session: The practitioner uses the symbols to focus and
bring forth the Reiki energy (see the section “Activating the Reiki
Symbols,” later in this chapter).
Making it easy to connect
Mikao Usui specifically developed this system of using the Reiki symbols to
make it easier to access Reiki energy.
112
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Here’s a brief explanation of how the symbols work. During your Reiki attune-
ment (see Chapter 7), the symbols are joined with Reiki energy and presented
as a linked form. Thus you receive the symbols embedded with the associ-
ated Reiki energy. So any time in the future that you call up the Reiki symbol,
the attached Reiki energy is also called.
This type of association is used by the subconscious mind all the time.
When a taste or smell reminds you of something else, you say it conjures
up the idea of something else. Mikao Usui designed the Reiki system to use
the symbols to conjure up the Reiki energy.
When you’re an advanced student of Reiki, you may find that you don’t use
the symbols so much because you connect directly to the energy. Whichever
way you go, with or without the symbols, you are connected to the energy.
Looking at the background of the symbols
Here’s a little Reiki history for you: Mikao Usui originally taught Reiki without
the use of symbols, but he added them for some of his students as a way to
help them understand and connect to the Reiki energy. The lineages after
Usui of Chujiro Hayashi and Hawayo Takata both use symbols in their teach-
ings and branches of Reiki (see Chapter 3), and the symbols are integral to
the attunement process. Most Reiki practitioners in the world are from these
lineages.
In Japan, some Reiki practitioners use a different type of attunement that
doesn’t use symbols. This type of initiation is called a reiju. I describe 
attunements and reiju in Chapter 7.
Mikao Usui chose the four Reiki symbols because he was familiar with them.
They are either little pictures or true symbols, or characters (words) also
used in Japanese, which are called kanji.
 The first two symbols (Cho Ku Rei and Sei Hei Ki) are actual symbols
(mystical images) from Buddhist or Shinto traditions. They also have
assigned Japanese names.
 The last two symbols (Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen and Dai Ko Myo) are Japanese
kanji, which are Chinese characters (words) used in Japanese. Each of
these symbols has many possible meanings, depending on how you inter-
pret the individual characters.
113
Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols

Using symbols without an attunement
Maybe you haven’t taken a Reiki class. You may wonder about the value of
symbols without receiving an attunement to them. In most cases, the symbol
will just look like an interesting drawing. You probably won’t connect with
the symbol as Reiki energy because you haven’t been through the initiation
or attunement process. If you have done lots of meditation or energy work,
you may be able to sense the energy of the symbols and somehow connect
yourself to Reiki through the symbols.
Yes, it’s theoretically possible to attune yourself to the Reiki symbols. But
that’s almost like saying you could learn medicine by reading a medical book.
In both cases, something would be missing, namely the careful passing on of
tradition from teacher to student and quality assurance that the information
was indeed correct.
Although the symbols are interesting drawings and have historical and 
possibly mystical significance, you need an attunement from a Reiki
teacher for the symbols to be able to truly connect you to Reiki energy
(see Chapter 7).
Some of you may prefer to wait until class to see the symbols, saving the
excitement for then. If you haven’t yet learned the Reiki symbols and want
to wait until after you take your Reiki class (see Chapter 7), skip this chapter
and Chapter 21, which lists nontraditional symbols.
114
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 
Looking at symbolology
A symbol is a representation of something else.
An example of a symbol is the use of the eagle
to represent the United States. Road signs and
maps use symbols to represent bridges, hills,
and roads. Humans have used symbols from the
days of cave dwelling. Cave drawings used
series of symbols to tell a story.
The Reiki symbols as drawings are two-
dimensional squiggles on a page. Because
they represent a deeper energy, you may feel a
chill or sense of recognition or other sign or
response when you first encounter a Reiki
symbol.
Symbols tap into the deeper consciousness that
is beyond words. When encountering a Reiki or
other sacred symbol, the energy you receive
transcends the lines on the page. You may sense
the energy that is associated with this symbol
from the years of its use in metaphysical prac-
tices and more recently by thousands of Reiki
practitioners, or you may pick up some vibra-
tions when hearing its name. The cross is a
great example of a spiritual symbol with a long
history of use. Two examples of the transcen-
dence of sound are Hindu and Gregorian chants.
When you listen to these chants, the words are
less important than the sounds they make.

Removing the secrecy
Symbols were originally kept secret by Hawayo Takata to in an attempt to
keep them sacred. Now many people in Reiki speak of keeping the symbols
sacred but not secret.
For me it was a breath of fresh air when the symbols were freely published and
not confined to secrecy. I was excited to find the symbols clearly drawn and
explained in Diane Stein’s book, Essential Reiki (published by The Crossing
Press), as well as material from authors of other books and Web sites, some
of which are listed in the appendix.
It is with respect for all Reiki Masters and practitioners past and present as
well as the potential for Reiki to help so many that I provide the Reiki sym-
bols, shown in Table 8-1.

Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols

Taking a Close Look at the 
Four Reiki Symbols
In this section I give information on the four different symbols that were used
by Mikao Usui. Use this information along with the summary in Table 8-1.
The Western description of what the symbols “do” is slightly different than
the Japanese description. And in the Western traditions of Reiki, each symbol
is called by its name, whereas in Japanese traditions of Reiki, each symbol is
called by its number: first, second, and so on.
I believe you will find your own uses for these symbols, which will change
over time as you continue to use Reiki.
Cho Ku Rei
This first symbol, Cho Ku Rei (pronounced cho koo ray), is called the Power
symbol (Figure 8-1). This symbol does the following:
 Focuses energy
 Connects you to the earth
 Purifies physical or visible objects such as parts of the body or inani-
mate objects
 Adds power when used alongside other symbols
1

Figure 8-1:
Cho Ku Rei,
the Power
symbol.
116
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Use this symbol to do the following:
 Feel connected to your body, or grounded
 Protect yourself or loved ones
 Heal physical illness or pain
 Purify or cleanse a room, car, or food
Some say that using this symbol is like turning on the light switch to the Reiki
energy. It has a grounding or solid feeling as it connects you to the earth. The
focusing feature is activated when you use the symbol in a specific location,
thereby focusing the energy there. See Chapter 18 for more examples of how
to use the Cho Ku Rei to protect yourself in everyday situations.
Cho Ku Rei is an ancient symbol found in Japan and may have Buddhist or
Shinto origins. The exact meaning of this phrase as intended by Mikao Usui is
not known, but one translation is “put the power here.”
Sei Hei Ki
The second Reiki symbol, Sei Hei Ki, is pronounced say hay key (see Figure 8-2).
The mental or emotional symbol does the following:
 Purifies and heals feelings and emotions
 Empowers the heart
 Promotes a sense of balance
Use this symbol for the following purposes:
 To heal emotional or psychological problems such as depression 
or grief
 To bring a feeling of love and forgiveness for self and in relationships
 To change your habits or heal addictions
The Sei Hei Ki symbol is the same as a form used for meditation in Tendai
Buddhism, which is the form that Mikao Usui practiced. The words Sei Hei Ki
can be translated to mean “one’s natural disposition” or habit; another trans-
lation is “emotional composure.”
Sei Hei Ki originated from a “seed syllable” or meditative form called Hrih in
Sanskrit or Kiriku in Shinto. The symbol calls upon the Buddhist deity Amida
Nyorai, who is the Buddha of Infinite Light and Life.
117
Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols

The difficulty in knowing the translations of symbols 1 and 2 stems from the
fact that the Japanese characters have to be implied from the sounds of the
symbol’s mantra. Remember that the symbol itself is not a Japanese charac-
ter, but a squiggly drawing that has been assigned Japanese-sounding words.
Just like the sound of the word “to” can also be written “too,” each sound can
represent more than one character.
Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen
The third Reiki symbol, Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen, is pronounced hahn shah zey
show nen. This symbol, also known as the Distance symbol, is a set of actual
Japanese characters (see Figure 8-3). This symbol is a more complicated
symbol and mantra, so some people have to take a bit more time learning
to say it or memorizing how to draw it.

Practice drawing this symbol for your 2nd-degree Reiki class, but remember
that afterward you can always look at a copy of the symbol when you use it.
Also, the more you practice, the easier it gets!
The Distance healing symbol does the following:
 Removes the illusion of space and time
 Connects to spirit
 Brings a unity of all beings

Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols

Use this symbol to do the following:
 Send Reiki at a distance (see Chapter 15)
 Connect with God or spirit
 Connect with the higher self (soul) in yourself or others
Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen is a set of Japanese words, so it can be translated as a
Japanese sentence. But each “word” has many meanings, so the sentence can
be translated or interpreted in different ways. One way it can be translated is
“right consciousness is the basis of everything.”
Dai Ko Myo
The Master symbol, Dai Ko Myo (pronounced die ko mio), is part of the train-
ing to become a Reiki Master.
Note that what is drawn in Figure 8-4 is now considered the most authentic
form of the Usui Dai Ko Myo. Some differences are thought to be from brush
stroke by calligraphers. Various other versions of this symbol have been pub-
lished and taught. Remember that the intention behind the symbol is much
more important than a difference in a particular stroke of the kanji.
The Dai Ko Myo means the following:
 Mastership
 Empowerment
Dai Ko Myo is similar to Cho Ku Rei with perhaps a more subtle energy that is
connected to the higher self. You use the Master symbol for the following:
 To pass Reiki attunements
 During Reiki treatments
 During meditation
Like the Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen, Usui Dai Ko Myo is a form of Japanese words
that can be translated in a few ways, one of which is “great bright light.”
In Chapter 21, you find two alternative Master symbols.

Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols

Memorizing the Reiki Symbols
When you first find out how to use the Reiki symbols, you’ll refer to this book
or your teacher’s handouts regularly. But one goal of Reiki training is for you
to be able to remember the image and name of each symbol so that you can
use it as needed.
Drawing the symbols
When you study the symbols (see Chapter 7), your teacher might emphasize
how to draw the symbol. This emphasis has evolved from the fact that
Japanese characters (kanji) are written in a certain order:
 From top to bottom
 From left to right
The Distance and Master symbols are Japanese kanji, and a certain order is
taught for drawing them. An order is also taught for the Power and Emotional
symbols. When you look at Figures 8-1 through 8-4 for the symbols, note that
arrows are used to guide you in the direction of your pen. Start with the first
stroke at number 1 on the figure and proceed from there.
My personal feeling is not to worry too much about drawing the symbol
exactly right or in exactly the right order. Just try your best. Watch out for
variations: Different books have slightly different instructions for drawing
the symbols.
You can have fun learning to draw the symbols by using colored pencils, felt-
tip markers, or watercolors.
Saying the names of the symbols
In addition to learning to draw the symbol, you need to know how to say its
name. I provide a pronunciation guide for each of the four Usui symbols in
their respective sections, earlier in this chapter. Whereas the Japanese system
of Reiki calls the symbol by number (symbol 1, symbol 2, and so on), the
Western system uses a Japanese name. This Japanese name is called a jumon
or kotodama, which are two different Japanese words for chanted words or
syllables, which you might call a mantra. The mantra, like the image of the
symbol, carries the Reiki energy.
122
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

What is more important about saying these names is not the dictionary 
definition of what they mean, but the actual sound or vibrations made
when pronouncing them.
If you want further explanation, consider the Sanskrit word om as an exam-
ple. Just as the sound of the mantra om is also the name of a symbol (see
Chapter 21), om is also an evocative sound on its own without even visu-
alizing the graphic symbol. Likewise, the mantra associated with each Reiki
symbol can also evoke the Reiki energy. Both the image and the sound of the
image’s name are linked to Reiki energy.
Activating the Reiki Symbols
In the preceding sections, I suggest some specific ways to use each of the
Reiki symbols. But you may use any symbol in any situation. After you’re
attuned to a particular symbol, maintain your connection to this symbol by
using it during meditation and self-Reiki treatments and when treating others
with Reiki. The more you try different symbols in different situations, the
more you realize what works best for you.
To activate the symbol, all you need to do is think of it. It will be in the form
of “seeing” or drawing the image of the symbol and saying its name.
Visualizing the symbols
Here are some ways you can visualize the symbols in Reiki:
 Draw the symbol in your palm before performing Reiki. Some practition-
ers draw each symbol in their palm and say its name three times while
clapping their hands three times to seal in the energy.
 Draw the symbol in the air.
 See the symbol in your mind’s eye (visualize the symbol on your closed
eyelids).
 Draw the symbol on the roof of your mouth with your tongue.
 Imagine the symbol in your eyes or on your breath as you send the
Reiki energy with that symbol along with your eye vision or your 
breath.
123
Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols

You can imagine a symbol entering a body part and enveloping the cells with
its energy. Visualize a Reiki symbol (Cho Ku Rei, for example) inside a tumor,
symbolically replacing disease with health.
Get creative with the symbols and put yourself inside of the symbol. Imagine
the symbol expanding and holding you. The symbols are happy to expand
and bend to help you out!
Using the sounds of symbols
A symbol’s name can be chanted aloud, but most practitioners say the names
silently to themselves while using the symbol.
Say the name of the symbol three times. There is a power to saying something
three times. What comes to my Western mind is Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz,
clicking her shoes together three times and saying three times, “There’s no
place like home.” Frank Baum, the author of The Wizard of Oz, presumably
understood the power of three.
When you say the symbol’s name, for example, Cho Ku Rei, that is like a
mantra bringing forth the associated energy.
Looking at More Symbols, 
Reiki and Otherwise
Besides the four Usui Reiki symbols described in this chapter, a number of
additional symbols are used in different Reiki branches. I list some nontradi-
tional symbols in Chapter 21.
You may encounter additional symbols from the following sources:
 Other Reiki branches: Karuna Reiki, Tera Mai Reiki, Seichim, and other
branches of Reiki use additional symbols.
 Your own religious or spiritual practice: You may want to use the cross,
the star of David, or other religious symbols.
 Your own psychic or intuitive processes: You may “see” new symbols
while dreaming, meditating, or getting a Reiki attunement. In Chapter 21,
I provide an example of a personal symbol that I received.
124
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Don’t get caught up in a frenzy to obtain more and better symbols. The Usui
Reiki symbols work! Follow your intuition and see if it’s right for you to keep
studying and acquiring more symbols through new attunements and Reiki
classes.
125
Chapter 8: Discovering the Reiki Symbols
A favorite Reiki symbol
Reiki Master Theresa Sarin considers the
Tibetan Dai Ko Myo her favorite symbol and has
shared the following story about how she uses
this symbol:
“Each morning I stand in front of my Sacred
Space, a table with crystals, angels and some
statues of saints, as I face the rising sun. I allow
the morning sun to bathe and enfold me as I
breathe in the sun’s newly risen energy. I then
sign the Tibetan Master Reiki symbol over
myself, becoming the symbol itself. I let it fill me
and surround me as I silently chant the symbol’s
name three times. I then recite this poem:
Great Being of Light,
Shine your Light here all day and night,
Great Being of Light,
Shine your Light here all day and night,
Great Being of Light,
Shine your Love here all day and night.
I stay open to receive all the Light this Master
symbol brings, allowing it to fill and charge me
so that I may begin my day full of Light and Love.
I then ask that Reiki continually express itself
through me throughout the day, helping me to
accomplish my divine purpose and presence on
earth. Finally, I end my morning prayer giving
thanks for my many blessings.”

Chapter 9
Getting Ready to Channel 
Reiki Energy
In This Chapter
 Getting connected to Reiki energy
 Using prayer and intention
 Connecting to Reiki energy through meditation
 Being guided by intuition
R
eiki works kind of like electricity, so think of yourself as the electrical
cord through which the Reiki flows. When you get initiated (attuned)
during a Reiki class (see Chapter 7), it’s like being plugged in to the Reiki
source. Now when you put your hands on yourself or someone else, Reiki just
flows. You have the ability to increase how much Reiki light shines through
you by clearing and opening yourself to channel even greater amounts of
Reiki energy.
This chapter is about connecting with the Reiki energy. Most people use some
form of meditation, prayer, or intention to power up and focus the Reiki flow.
I describe techniques you can use to connect to and focus the Reiki energy.
You can use these methods to increase the levels of Reiki energy you can chan-
nel. Use this chapter to help yourself prepare before giving Reiki to yourself
and especially before treating others.
The Reiki energy comes through you, but it’s not your energy. This is a subtle
but important distinction. If you try to use your own energy to heal another,
you’ll find yourself feeling depleted. The value of using Reiki is that you’re
accessing an infinite source of power that not only goes through you to heal
others but also renews you along the way!

Connecting with the Reiki Energy
Your spiritual connection is always there, but it may be drowned out by the
noise of the world. Like a buried treasure, you can get to the Reiki energy if
you set your intention to do so!
To connect with the Reiki energy, it helps to do the following:
 Take time to connect. Just as being busy, doing errands, or reading the
newspaper can keep you from communicating with your family, they can
also keep you from connecting spiritually. A quick way to connect with
higher energy is to make some time to do one of the following:
• Get quiet. Just turn off the noise of radio, television, and cell
phones and sit quietly.
• Listen to music. Sacred sounds can get right to the heart of the
matter and let your spirit soar. But use whatever music moves you.
• Be with nature. Plants and animals communicate through still-
ness. Take a walk through the park or spend time with your cat.
 Pay attention. The more attention that you pay to your spiritual con-
nection, the stronger it becomes. During meditation in particular, you
are paying attention to the spiritual union, sensing connection in the
silence.
Many religions use prayer and meditation for spiritual connection. The system
of Reiki healing doesn’t have specific prayers, but you can create your own
(see the next section, “Combining Prayer and Intention with Reiki”). Meditation
goes hand in hand with Reiki and is covered in the section “Meditating to
Connect with Reiki Energy,” later in this chapter.
128
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 
Stepping out of the way
You become a better channel of the Reiki energy
when you can put away all of your own precon-
ceptions, issues, judgments, and needs and just
focus on the energy itself.
So if you need to make someone better, you’ll be
less likely to help them. This is because your
focus is on you and your need to help, instead
of focusing on being a Reiki channel.
Try to let go of your needs and just work on letting
the energy flow; then both you and the recipient
of Reiki will probably feel better!

Some people explain prayer as taking time to talk to spirit and meditation
as taking the time to listen. In both cases, you’re stoking the fires of your 
spiritual connection, which is directly linked to channeling Reiki energy.
The more connected you are spiritually, the easier it is to connect with
Reiki energy.
Reiki is the energy of light and love, and being spiritually connected in terms
of Reiki means recognizing that you are connected to this powerful source of
light and love.
Combining Prayer and 
Intention with Reiki
Whether you call it “asking in prayer” or “stating in intention,” both are great
ways to start a Reiki session. The most important thing is that the prayer feels
right to you. You can devise a prayer that you use all the time or create a dif-
ferent one for each situation.
Here are some examples of prayers to use before giving Reiki:
Thank you [name for God, saints, angels, or spirit guides that you work
with] for your presence today at this Reiki healing session for [name of
Reiki recipient].
I pray that [name of Reiki recipient] receives the highest good from
today’s Reiki session.
I pray that I may be a clear and open Reiki channel for the pure flow of
Reiki.
I pray that I give and receive Reiki with love, acceptance, and 
compassion.
I pray that I am guided to bring the highest level of healing possible for
[name of Reiki recipient].
I pray that [Reiki recipient] and I are surrounded and protected by the
light and love of Reiki.
You can use this as a prayer or remove the “I pray that” wording and use the
statements as positive affirmations.
129
Chapter 9: Getting Ready to Channel Reiki Energy

Any prayer you use before a Reiki session demonstrates that you’re doing the
following:
 Clarifying the goals of treatment: Before the start of the session, for-
mally state what the goal of the treatment is. This clarifies the focus
(sets the intention) for the Reiki session. See Chapter 19 to read more
about setting intention.
 Letting go of control: Out go judgment or expectations of what the ses-
sion will be. You’re giving that power over to the Reiki energy.
 Asking for guidance: You will receive guidance during the session.
It’s up to you to trust this guidance and follow your intuition.
 Asking for protection: I like to ask for protection for myself and the
Reiki recipient. Doing so sets the intention for a safe working environ-
ment and keeps away any energy that is less than positive. I describe
techniques for energy clearing and protection in Chapter 13.
Meditating to Connect 
with Reiki Energy
While meditating, you’re creating the space and time for detachment from the
distractions of the world so that you may become conscious of your spiritual
connection. During meditation, you receive peace and inspiration. Meditating
has so many benefits, including providing stress release and creating balance
and harmony.
You can use meditation as part of your personal spiritual practice or just
before performing Reiki. Because Reiki practice is about receiving this spiri-
tual energy and passing it through you, meditation has a close relationship
to Reiki.
130
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 
Meditation to meet your Reiki guides
Some Western Reiki teachers take you on a
meditation to meet your Reiki guides. It’s believed
that everyone has spirit guides watching over
and helping out. You might envision these fig-
ures as saints, gods, angels, or masters from
your own religion. After you become attuned to
the Reiki energy, you might sense or request the
help of other guides such as Mikao Usui, Chujiro
Hayashi, or Hawayo Takata (for info about them,
see Chapter 3).
You may experience that certain guides come
to you specifically to aid you in Reiki. The pur-
pose of a meditation to meet your Reiki guides is
to introduce yourself to these beings.

Two important features of meditation are sitting and breathing. Make sure
you’re comfortable in your sitting position. Take a few deep breaths to
release tension and then let your natural in-and-out breathing take place.
Many spiritual practices, including Reiki, recommend daily meditation. You
can use any form of meditation that is comfortable for you. Mikao Usui rec-
ommended meditating on the Reiki Principles (see Chapter 4). See Chapter 19
for more about meditation and Reiki.
Prayerful hands: Gassho
Gassho is a Japanese term that represents a hand position and can also be
used as the basis of a meditation. The Gassho (with or without bowing) is
used in Zen and other forms of Buddhism. People of all religions in Japan and
other Eastern countries use the Gassho hand position as a sign of greeting,
gratitude, or respect or even to make a request. The hand position may be
combined with bowing. Gassho is similar to the Indian Namaste hand posi-
tion (which you may know if you practice Yoga).
Gassho hand position
Put your palms together in prayer position, and you have performed the
Gassho! During Gassho, your hands may be placed in front of your chest
(see Figure 9-1), your lips and nose, or your forehead (see Figure 9-2).
Figure 9-1:
Gassho
hand
position at
chest level.
131
Chapter 9: Getting Ready to Channel Reiki Energy

Use the Gassho hand position before and after a Reiki meditation or 
session.
Gassho meditation
Sit with your eyes closed and hands in the Gassho position. Focus on the
point where your middle fingers are touching.
Breathing meditation: Joshin Kokyu Ho
Joshin Kokyu Ho is the Japanese method (Ho) of breathing (Kokyu) to focus
or cleanse the mind (Joshin). This method brings breath down to the belly,
which is called the hara in Japanese. (See the sidebar “Breathing to the belly,”
in this chapter.) To use this technique, follow these steps:
Figure 9-2:
Gassho

132
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

1. Sit or stand comfortably.
2. Use the Gassho position to start and then close your eyes.
3. Move your hands to your thighs with palms upward to receive the
energy as you breathe in.
4. Breathe in through your nose.
Imagine the energy entering your body from the top of your head (seventh
chakra, the crown) and traveling down to your belly (second chakra,
the hara). You might visualize the energy as white light coming through
your body.
5. Hold the energy in your belly and then let the breath out through
your mouth.
Imagine the energy (white light) within your body leaving through every
pore on your skin.
6. Continue the cycle of breathing in and out (Steps 4 and 5) until you
feel you’re an open channel for the Reiki energy.
7. End the exercise with a simple Gassho (see the earlier sections on
Gassho).
Be careful with breathing exercises if you have any medical issues like high
blood pressure. Follow the wisdom of your body (intuition) to know when a
technique is right (or not) for you.
133
Chapter 9: Getting Ready to Channel Reiki Energy
Gassho architecture
In Japan, Gassho means more than a hand posi-
tion in Reiki. It’s also the name for a type of large
farmhouse built in the 17th century. These
delightful houses have steep thatched roofs that
mimic the shape of the hands in Gassho, with
palms touching each other. The Gassho house
is large and has many levels, allowing extended
families to live in one home. Frequently, the top
floor was used to grow silkworms or make
washi paper (traditional Japanese paper made
from the bark of mountain trees).
The Gassho farmhouses are located in geo-
graphic areas with lots of winter snow. The
steeply sloping roof helps the snow to fall off,
thus saving the house from snow damage.

Focusing technique: Seishin Toitsu
A variation or addition to Joshin Kokyu Ho, Seishin Toitsu (“creating a uni-
fied mind”) takes the energy of the breath and brings it to the hands. Seishin
Toitsu has many meanings in Japanese, but the simplest is “concentration.”
This technique helps to concentrate the Reiki energy and is thus useful to
perform before a Reiki session. To perform Seishin Toitsu, follow these steps:
1. Sit or stand comfortably.
2. Use the Gassho position to start and then close your eyes.
3. Move your hands to your thighs with palms upward to receive the
energy as you breathe in.
4. Breathe in through your nose.
Imagine the energy entering your hands. Bring the breath energy up
your arms to your shoulders and down to your belly (hara).
5. Breathe out, through your mouth.
Imagine the energy within your body going from your hara, up your
body to your shoulders and out your hands.
6. Continue the cycle of breathing in and out (Steps 4 and 5), feeling
the pulse of energy through your hands until you feel the energy is
flowing freely.
7. End the exercise with a simple Gassho (see the earlier sections on
Gassho).
This technique helps to sensitize your hands, which is very helpful before
starting a Reiki session. Your hands will be flowing with Reiki energy and
“aching” to get started!
Hatsurei Ho is an advanced Japanese Reiki technique that combines Kenyoku
Ho (see Chapter 13), Joshin Kokyu Ho, and Seishin Toitsu.
Chakra meditation
In Western Reiki, incorporating chakras into Reiki work is common. The body
has seven major chakras, from the root (perineum) up to the crown (the top
of the head). To review the individual chakras and their relationship to the
body’s energy, see Chapter 2.
134
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Working with your chakras helps you to sense energy in yourself and others.
The more you work with chakras, the easier it is to activate them and keep
them in balance.
Meditating on chakras is usually performed as a group during a Reiki circle
(see Chapter 14) or in Reiki classes (see Chapter 7), but you can also try it
on your own. By meditating on your chakras, you become familiar with the
energies of each chakra and help to keep your energy flowing.
1. Get comfortable in your seat.
2. Take a few deep breaths to let go of tension.
Focus on your breath — in and out.
3. Take your attention to your root chakra (perineum).
Visualize the color red and stay at your root chakra for a few minutes.
Feel yourself connected to the inside of the earth.
4. Move to your sacral chakra (between your navel and your genitals).
Visualize the color orange. Stay at your sacral chakra for a few minutes.
Feel yourself bathed in creative juices.
5. Move to your solar plexus chakra (above your navel and below
your chest).
Visualize the color yellow. Stay at your solar plexus for a few minutes.
Feel the power of your inner fire.
6. Move to your heart chakra (the center of your chest).
Visualize the color green. Stay at your heart chakra for a few minutes.
Experience love and compassion.
7. Go to your throat chakra.
Visualize the color bright blue. Stay with your throat chakra for a few
minutes. Let your expressive vibrations flow.
8. Go to your third eye chakra (at the center of your forehead).
Visualize the color indigo (purple). Keep your focus on your third eye
for a few minutes. See your vision expanding.
9. Go to your crown chakra (the top of your head).
Visualize the color violet (purple-red). Stay at your crown chakra for a
few minutes. Connect with spirit.
135
Chapter 9: Getting Ready to Channel Reiki Energy

10. Let the energy flow out from your crown and down over your body.
As the energy comes down from your crown, it surrounds you in a shim-
mering protective light.
11. Take your attention back to the root chakra and feel the energy flow
up through the chakras to the crown of your head.
12. Repeat Steps 10 and 11, feeling the energy flow up through your
chakras and down and around you.
When the energy is flowing, you can let go of thought and enjoy the sen-
sations of peace and light.
While you meditate, you can touch each chakra or let one or both hands
hover near the chakra.
Contracting the Hui Yin
The Hui Yin technique helps to concentrate the Reiki energy in the body
before giving or even during a Reiki session. It is used during some medita-
tions given in advanced Reiki classes.
At your perineum (the space between the genitals and anus) is a Chinese
energy point called the Hui Yin. Reiki Masters from some Western branches
use advanced exercises (Violet Breath) and meditations (Hui Yin meditation)
involving this Chinese energy point. And some Japanese exercises also con-
tract this point (see the information on Koki Ho in Chapter 10).
The idea here is that the Reiki energy can escape through the Hui Yin point.
When you contract it (squeeze the muscles in your perineum), the energy
flow in your body is stronger. Contracting the Hui Yin is the same feeling as
performing Kegel exercises (recommended for women).
To preserve more energy in your body and thus increase the level of Reiki
energy that flows through your hands, follow these tips:
 Keep your tongue at the tip of your mouth.
 Squeeze your Hui Yin (perineum, first chakra between your anus and
sex organs).
Feel the sensations of Reiki energy in your hands. When you squeeze the per-
ineum, you probably feel a stronger sense of energy in your palms.
136
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

You can perform a circuit of energy going down the down the front of your
body and up the back of your body. This is part of the microcosmic orbit
that helps to increase the levels of energy in your body.
Receiving Guidance through Intuition
You are being guided during a Reiki session, and you receive that guidance
through your intuition. You may experience intuition as a gut feeling, instinct,
or insight. You may not even realize what’s happening, but you get a thought
to “move to the next position” or “put your hands over the heart.” This is the
type of intuition I am talking about here.
137
Chapter 9: Getting Ready to Channel Reiki Energy
Breathing to the belly
Reiki meditation or focusing exercises bring the
energy of the breath down to the belly, which is
considered to be the seat of energy in Japanese
and Chinese traditions.
The breath
You breathe all the time (I hope). But you may not
be aware of your breath. Meditation helps you
focus on breathing. As you pay attention to each
breath, in and out, in and out, everything else
fades away. In this quiet space, you can focus on
bringing the universal life-force energy through
each breath.
Though your breath enters through your nose,
you might imagine the energy of the breath
entering through the top of your head, at the
crown chakra. You can visualize the energy as
white or gold light coming through your crown.
The belly
Lurking within your belly is a seat of many trea-
sures. In Japanese and Chinese traditions, the
belly is considered the center of energy, or ki in
Japanese and qi or chi in Chinese. This is the
area below your navel and above the pubic bone,
about 2 inches below the navel. Two Japanese
terms are used to denote the belly: hara and
tanden. Hara just means belly. Tanden is called
dantien or tantien in Chinese and means ball of
energy, or energy field.
The belly is also the seat of the second chakra
in the Indian tradition.
The Reiki breathing techniques, Joshin Kokyu
Ho and Seishin Toitsu, help to focus the energy
by bringing it down to the hara and out through
the pores of the skin.
If you practice karate, Qigong, or T’ai Chi, you
will also hear of these terms for this energetic
center in the belly.

As you develop confidence in using intuition, it becomes your most important
tool in knowing exactly how to format the Reiki session for each person to cater
to their individual needs. Two Reiki techniques rely on intuition: Reiji Ho and
Byosen Reikan Ho (see Chapter 10). For Reiji Ho, you are guided where to put
your hands next. For Byosen Reikan Ho, your hands are guided to parts of the
body that have “disease” or need Reiki. Both of these techniques require that
you follow your inner knowing or intuition to know where to place your
hands during a Reiki session.
Guided by spirit: Reiji Ho
This Japanese method (Ho) prepares you to be guided (ji) by spirit (Rei). Use
this method to increase your awareness of Reiki guidance (intuition).
1. Stand and put your hands in the Gassho position (refer to Figure 9-1).
Set your intention: to connect with Reiki.
2. When you feel that you’ve connected with the Reiki energy, bring your
hands (still folded) up to your forehead and rest there for a moment
(refer to Figure 9-2).
You and your hands are now ready to start a Reiki session! Trust that
your hands are guided to go to the right positions.
3. At the end of the Reiki session, when you no longer feel guided to put
your hands on any part of the recipient’s body or aura, conclude with
a Gassho.
This simple exercise powerfully sets the stage for intuition to flow.
Developing your intuition
Intuition isn’t one of those subjects taught in high school, or college for that
matter. The word itself suggests you get tuition, or instruction, from inside
yourself: in-tuition. You can develop your intuition the way you develop any
skill: practice and more practice.
Here is a great way to develop your intuition for use during Reiki. Find an open-
minded Reiki partner (perhaps one of your classmates from Reiki training)
138
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

who is open to this exercise. You’re going to practice using intuition on this
friend.
1. Start by meditating, praying, and connecting with spirit.
Everything written about in this chapter helps you to open the “space
in your mind” so an inspiration can come through. State something like
“My intuition tells me exactly what to do during this Reiki session. I receive
and trust my guidance.”
2. Perform Reiki with an intuitive approach.
Use the Reiji Ho technique or Byosen Reikan Ho (see Chapter 10). Don’t
move your hands until you get a message telling you where to go next. If
you don’t know, then use your
• Inner vision: Close your eyes and see if an image comes to mind.
You might see a picture of a right shoulder.
• Sensations: See if you feel in your own body a tingling sensation.
If you feel a new sensation (that is, not your own long-term knee
problem) that seems to have just arisen, then put your hands on
the recipient’s body in that place.
• Thoughts: You might get a thought, such as this: “Put your hands
on the jawbone.”
• Sound: You might hear or sense the word “breathing,” in which
case you can focus Reiki on the nose and lungs.
If nothing comes to you, then just pick the next position out of a hat.
Imagine you are reaching into a hat with pieces of paper with different
body parts listed. Pick out a piece of paper. What does it say? Go there.
3. Ask the recipient for feedback.
You might say, “I don’t know why, but I got the signal to put my hands on
your left elbow.” And the person might tell you, “I banged my elbow on
the car door this morning!”
The more you’re open to intuition and follow it, the better you’ll become at
using and interpreting your intuition.
When you’re able to trust yourself and follow your intuition, Reiki sessions
may not be what you were expecting, but they’ll help the recipients. They
may even ask you how you knew to put your hands in just the right place.

Chapter 9: Getting Ready to Channel Reiki Energy

Integrity goes hand in hand with intuition. Read Chapters 10 and 13 so you
know how to give a Reiki session before you put your hands on anyone. If you
feel confused about intuition, then just use the standard hand positions listed
in Chapter 10. In particular, read the section about ethics and boundaries in
Chapter 13.
To read about using intuition in your personal life, see Chapter 19. Messages
come every day all the time. The real measure of growth is being able to hear
those messages and then follow them.

A
fter you have the Reiki energy flowing (see Chapter 9), you’re probably
eager to share this energy with others. Start by practicing to use the
hand positions on yourself (see Chapter 11). Then you’re most of the way
toward being ready to treat others because the hand positions you use on
yourself are very similar to those used on others.
This chapter provides you with Reiki techniques to use when you give Reiki
to another person. The main course of the session is the set of standard hand
positions, and 19 positions are illustrated and described. You can also use
Japanese intuitive techniques and methods to give Reiki without even touch-
ing the body.
The techniques provided here are starting points or suggestions. Learning to
use Reiki techniques is like learning how to draw. After you master the tech-
niques, you can develop your own unique style. In Chapter 13, I explain how
to develop your own Reiki style and put together the Reiki session.

Examining Full-Body Hand Positions
The hand positions described in this section derive from Hawayo Takata and
her successors (all of whom you can read about in Chapter 3). Your teacher
may provide a shorter or longer version of this set of hand positions.
Other hand positions, which were used by Mikao Usui and Chujiro Hayashi,
are now available in published translations from the Japanese originals
(see the resources in the appendix). In many cases, these positions are simi-
lar to or overlap the Western hand positions that are more commonly used.
The treatment manuals from Usui and Hayashi have specific recommenda-
tions for problems with different organs. 
Ultimately, the best way to perform Reiki is to use any set of hand positions
or techniques as the starting point for an intuitive session in which your
hands are guided by spirit to go exactly where they are needed (see the 
section “Knowing Where to Go and When to Leave,” later in this chapter).
Here’s a set of guidelines to consider before delving into the positions:
 Start with the recipient on her back on a massage table. If you need to
work on a chair or on the stomach, modify instructions as needed.
 Stand or sit while performing Reiki; do whatever is most comfortable
for you.
 Make sure you have access to walk around (or sit next to) the massage
table.
 Modify the instructions in this chapter as needed if you are working on
someone who is smaller than average, such as a child, or larger than
average, such as a professional basketball player.
 Try to keep your fingers together for all Reiki positions.
 Move gently from one position to another.
 Study up on human anatomy and chakra locations; you can consult the
illustrations of the human body and chakras in Chapter 2.
 Follow all ethical considerations when working with your hands on
someone, as mentioned in Chapter 13.
Disease, problems, and pain usually have multiple causes and multiple effects.
The full-body Reiki treatment is valuable because it covers the range of differ-
ent meridian pathways, chakras, and parts of the body. 
142
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

In the descriptions of the 19 hand positions that follow, I include general
information on how to position your hands and which organs, conditions,
and chakras are helped by each position. Note that only some of the hand
positions directly treat the seven major chakras.
Starting at the head
Reiki treatment generally starts at the head. Head positions are good for
recipients who have colds, tension headaches, sinus infections, allergies, 
earaches, migraines, and toothaches and need stress release. The head 
positions also establish a sense of balance in not only the head area but
also through the whole body. Because these positions treat the brain, they
also affect the rest of the body.
The positions used on the head are among the most important of all hand
positions.
1. Eyes and face (see Figure 10-1): Place your hands over the recipient’s
closed eyes with your hands to each side of the nose and fingers rest-
ing on the cheekbones. Your thumbs rest on the third eye.
Figure 10-1:
Reiki hand
positions for
the eyes
and face.
143
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

Some people use a tissue to protect the eyes. Treating here relaxes the
recipient and takes them into the Reiki experience, which is like being
between waking and sleeping.
This position opens the third eye (sixth) chakra, which helps improve
issues of vision, both through the eyes and intuitively. The sixth chakra
is associated with the pituitary gland, lower brain, nervous system, ears,
nose, and eyes.
2. Top of the head (see Figure 10-2): Place your hands over the top 
of the head with your wrists touching and fingers pointing down
toward the ears.
You may want to move your hands away from the hair and hover over
the crown. You may not want to spend too much time here, but stay long
enough to ensure that the crown area is open. 
This position opens the crown (seventh) chakra, which aids the recipient
in feeling spiritually connected and is associated with the upper brain
and pineal gland.
Figure 10-2:
Reiki hand
positions for
the top of
the head.
144
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

3. Temples (see Figure 10-3): Rest your hands on both sides of the fore-
head, between the eyebrows and the hairline, with the fingers lightly
touching the cheekbones.
This position aids in balancing the brain, relieves headaches, and helps
to connect spiritually. You might sense the throbbing of blood vessels in
this tender area.
4. Ears (see Figure 10-4): Put your hands over the ears.
This position promotes equilibrium, treats the inner and outer ears and
the jaws, and quiets a busy mind.
5. Beneath the head (Figure 10-5): Place your hands under the head.
Do this by rolling the head to one side, putting one hand underneath,
holding the head with that hand while you roll the head to the other
side, and put your other hand beneath. Try to hold the bottom of the
head, medulla oblongata, so your fingers are just touching the top of
the neck.
This relaxing position treats the sixth chakra (third eye) and also treats
the back of the head.

Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Moving down the front of the body
The throat and neck positions serve as the transition to the trunk of the
body. You are probably still standing or sitting behind the recipient as you
perform the next three hand positions.
6. Throat (see Figure 10-6): Let your fingers touch each other as you cup
the bottom of the throat with your hands. Be gentle and keep your
hands around but not touching the throat.
This hand position, which helps the thyroid and parathyroid gland,
vocal cords, larynx, and lymph nodes, treats the throat (fifth) chakra
that controls the throat and neck. This is the seat of expression and
communication. Use treatment here to help the recipient speak up,
speak his mind, speak for himself, and speak his truth. It’s good for
writer’s block too!
Figure 10-6:

the throat.

your touch
is light,
not tight.
147
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

This position is not for everyone because some people are squeamish
about having someone else’s hands near their throat. You can try keep-
ing your hands about a hand’s width away from the throat.
7. Collarbone (see Figure 10-7): Rest your hands on the sides of the neck
with your fingers pointing toward the center of the chest.
This position gives Reiki to the thymus area, which is between the
throat and heart chakras. The thymus gland is important for immune
function.
Figure 10-7:
Reiki hand
positions

collarbone.
148
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

For this next position, place yourself either behind or on the side of the recip-
ient (it all depends on the logistics of your height, their height, and how far
you can stretch!).
8. Back of the neck and front of the heart (see Figure 10-8): Put your left
hand beneath the neck area and your right hand over the top of the
center heart area.
This position combines treatment of the back of the neck with the heart.
You are treating two areas simultaneously: the throat chakra and the
heart chakra, which helps with expression from the heart, or speaking
one’s truth. This position is good for treating high blood pressure; actu-
ally, any position on the neck helps with high blood pressure.
Figure 10-8:
Reiki hand
positions for
the back of
the neck and

the heart.
149
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

For the next four positions, stand (or sit) on either side of the Reiki 
recipient.
9. Heart (see Figure 10-9): Place your hands in a T, one hand placed hori-
zontally above the breasts and one hand between the breasts placed
vertically.
Treating the heart (fourth) chakra controls all things having to do with
the circulatory system, including the heart, veins, and arteries; the lungs
(which are related to both heart and throat chakras); the breasts; and
the thymus gland. Opening the heart chakra with Reiki increases the
flow of love, air, and nurturing that can be received and given. When the
heart chakra is open and flowing, the recipient experiences forgiveness
and a sense of love and compassion.
Figure 10-9:
Reiki hand
positions for
the heart.
150
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

With the next three positions on the abdomen, you can use your hands as
in Figure 10-10, with your hands one in front of each other in a line, or as in
Figure 10-11, with your hands next to each other, thumb to thumb.
10. Upper abdomen (see Figure 10-10): Put your hands in a line under-
neath the chest area.
This position treats the digestive organs (stomach, liver, gallbladder, and
intestines) as well as the spleen.
The solar plexus, or pit of the stomach (third chakra), is treated by
both positions 10 and 11. The third chakra is associated with power
and self-esteem and the pancreas gland. Treat the solar plexus to help
with diabetes, liver disease, and gastrointestinal disorders.
Figure 10-10:
Reiki hand
positions for
the upper
abdomen.
151
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

11. Middle abdomen (see Figure 10-11): Move your hands down about
one hand width below position 10 to treat the middle part of the
abdomen. Place one hand on top of the navel and the other hand
below the navel.
This position treats the pancreas, gallbladder, and large and small
intestines.
12. Lower abdomen and sacral area (see Figure 10-12): Place your hands
on the lower abdomen, one in front of the other, with your hands and
arms away from the genital region. Or instead, you can place your
hands in a slight V shape.
Figure 10-11:
Reiki hand
positions for
the middle
abdomen.
152
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

This position treats the sacral (second) chakra, reproductive organs,
bladder, and pelvic area. The belly is called the hara in Japanese and is
considered to be the seat of the body’s energy. The second chakra is
associated with sexuality and creativity. The reproductive organs,
which have energetic centers here, represent creation of all types,
from babies to books. Emotions are commonly stored in the second
chakra, which can lead to problems in the reproductive system and
lower back. 
At this point, you may want to include treatment of the root (first)chakra.
For some recipients (if you know them well or have discussed beforehand),
you can treat a bit lower on the pelvic area, taking care to avoid the genitals.
Or you can treat with your hands above the body (see the section “Using Reiki
without Touching the Body,” later in this chapter).
Figure 10-12:
Reiki hand
positions for
the lower
abdomen.
153
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

Treating the root (first) chakra covers the bladder, the tailbone (coccyx), and
sciatic nerves; is associated with the adrenal glands; and is related to issues
of sexuality, feeling supported, and feeling connected to the earth (grounded).
Like a tree, you need good roots (chakra) to provide sustenance and support
from prevailing winds. Sexual issues are generally associated with both the
first and second chakras.
Switching to the back of the body
To work on the back, you have to ask the recipient to turn over. The person
may be deeply resting, so this can take a minute to achieve. The recipient
lies on her stomach, with her head resting on a pillow or on a special neck
rest that is attached to the massage table. You stand or sit at the side of the
table.
When the recipient has complaints about back problems, treating the back
can be very helpful. Another benefit of working on the back is to access some
of the chakras more easily from behind.
Note that some people have longer backs, so you may need to add an extra
hand position or two to cover the entire back!
13. Upper shoulders (see Figure 10-13): Put your hands on the top of the
shoulders, under the neck.
Reiki helps relieve some of the tension and neck and shoulder aches,
which are common in this region. You are also giving treatment to
the back of the throat (sixth) chakra here, when your hands are near
the neck.
14. Shoulder blades (see Figure 10-14): Take your hands down a few
inches to rest on the top of the shoulder blades on the back of the
heart area.
This position treats the back of the heart (fourth) chakra, the heart,
and the lungs.

Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

15. Waist area (see Figure 10-15): Place your hands on the back of the
waist area.
This position treats the kidneys, the adrenal glands, and the back of the
solar plexus (third) chakra.
16. Lower back (Figure 10-16): Rest your hands on the hollow of the lower
back just above the buttocks.
This area is another place of tension for many people. This position
helps release tension in the lower back and treats the sacral (second)
chakra.
Some practitioners treat the buttocks, which gives Reiki to the root
(first) chakra. Use this position with discretion (and permission) or
treat with your hands above the body.
Figure 10-15:
Reiki hand
positions for
the waist.
156
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Don’t forget the legs and feet!
The original standard hand positions didn’t formally include the legs and
feet. Most people, including myself, like to be treated on the legs, ankles,
and feet. You can perform these positions while the recipient is lying on
her stomach or on her back. You stand to the sides of the table when
treating the knees, but you can stand or sit at the base of the table when
holding the feet or ankles. As always, try to make yourself comfortable
when working.
17. Knees (see Figure 10-17): Hold the knees on either side: top or 
bottom. 
A nice treatment for knees is to cup them underneath with one hand and
put the other hand on top. Many people have pain in their knees from
overexertion or injury.
18. Ankles (see Figure 10-18): Put one hand on the back of each ankle.
Figure 10-16:
Reiki hand
positions
for the
lower back.
157

158
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Doing so helps to balance the energy of the right and left legs. You can
also work on one ankle at a time by holding the top of the ankle with one
hand and the bottom of the ankle with the other hand. 
19. Soles of the feet (see Figure 10-19): Place your hands firmly on the
back of the feet.
Some people don’t like to have their feet touched, but if you hold firmly
on the bottom of the feet, most people can tolerate that. This position
brings the Reiki energy down to the feet, which helps ground and bal-
ance the energy in the body.
Balance the treatment on both sides of the body. For example, if you treat the
right ankle, then treat the left ankle at the same time or afterward.
Figure 10-19:
Reiki hand
positions for
the feet.
159
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

Considering additional Reiki positions
The positions that I discuss in the preceding sections cover most of the body,
but you may feel that additional positions are useful.
 Shoulder and hand: Hold the left shoulder with one hand and the left
hand with another. Repeat on the right side.
 As your intuition tells you: You may feel drawn to treat the wrists,
elbows, upper arm, thighs, side of the hips, or sides of the abdomen.
It all depends on the information you get from the recipient before and
during the session and from your intuition.
 Over the recipient’s hands: She might have her hands folded over
her abdomen. Instead of moving her hands, you can put your hands
over hers.
Respect the recipient’s boundaries. If you feel that the first chakra (genitals)
or breasts need treatment, perform Reiki with your hands well above the
body (see the section “Using Reiki without Touching the Body,” later in this
chapter).
Knowing Where to Go and When to Leave
When you’re new at Reiki healing, you may wonder how to know where to put
your hands and when it’s time to move to the next position.
One way of Reiki knowing is to decipher the Reiki sensations in your hands.
As you perform Reiki more frequently, you may start to sense the following:
 Tingling, pulling, or heat in your hands as they pass over certain
areas of the body: You feel these sensations in some areas but not
others. See the section “Byosen Reikan Ho: Scanning the body,” 
later in this chapter.
 A sense of energy passing through your hands to the position you are
holding on the body, almost as if a magnet is holding your hands in
place: The recipient is “drawing” the Reiki energy to her.
160
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Your hands hold the key to knowing what to do during a Reiki session.
Deciding on hand placement
The beauty of using the standard hand positions is that you don’t have to
question where to put your hands; you just follow the numbers of the hand
positions! Another way to perform Reiki is to use an intuitive approach to
decide hand placement. Most practitioners use a combination of standard
positions and intuitive techniques. And you want to remain flexible. For exam-
ple, if someone has a liver problem, place your hands directly over the liver
in addition to or rather than a standard hand position.
Following your intuition, which just means inner knowing, or the sensations
in your hands to determine where to put your hands during a Reiki session is
the subject of the next two techniques.
Guided by spirit: Reiji Ho
This Japanese method (Ho) prepares you to be guided (ji) by spirit (Rei).
Use this method to increase your awareness of Reiki guidance (intuition).
1. Stand and put your hands in the Gassho position (see the figure in
Chapter 9).
Set your intention: to connect with Reiki.
2. When you feel that you’ve connected with the Reiki energy, bring
your hands (still folded) up to your forehead and rest there for a
moment (see the figure in Chapter 9).
You and your hands are now ready to start a Reiki session! Trust that
your hands are guided to go to the right positions.
3. At the end of the Reiki session, when you no longer feel guided to put
your hands on any part of the recipient’s body or aura, conclude with
a Gassho.
This simple exercise powerfully sets the stage for intuition to flow. Use it
alone during a session or alongside the other techniques described in this
chapter.
161
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

Byosen Reikan Ho: Scanning the body
Use Byosen Reikan Ho to sense where the recipient’s body needs to heal.
With your hands held above the recipient’s body, move your hands over the
surface of the body. (See Figure 10-20.) Note any changes in sensation, which
might be temperature changes of hot or cold, a tingling, pain, or itchiness.
When you feel this change, keep your hands in this area (either on the recipi-
ent’s body or just above) and apply Reiki energy.
You can use this technique before a treatment, in which case you scan to get
information that you will use during treatment. If you scan during the Reiki
session itself, keep your hands above the body while scanning and stop to
give Reiki when you sense it is needed.
Byosen means illness, Reikan means intuition or inspiration, and Ho means
method.
Figure 10-20:

162
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Moving on
The next part of the art of performing Reiki is to know when to pick your
hands up from one position and move them to the next position. You can use
a clock to help you, or you can decide on a certain number of breaths; for
example, you may choose to spend three minutes or nine breaths in each
position. Or you can use your intuition and observation to sense when it’s
time to move on.
The following signs let you know it’s time to move on to the next hand 
position:
 The sensation that led you there has ended. This could be a tingling or
heat sensation.
 You get an intuitive message to go somewhere else.
 The recipient sighs or alters her position.
These signs let you know the energy has been received in that area.
Despite all I’ve said about hand placement, it helps to know that Reiki energy
knows exactly where to go. So you can rest assured that wherever your hands
are or wherever they go is perfectly fine! Reiki will flow.
If you find that the recipient flinches or seems uncomfortable with certain
positions, ask the person about it or simply move your hands to give Reiki
above the body, or move to another position.
Using Reiki without Touching the Body
A very useful aspect of Reiki is that it can be performed without any contact
with the recipient’s body. Reiki works with your hands on the body or above
the body, because the energy associated with your body, your aura (see
Chapter 2), extends beyond the physical body. You can send Reiki with your
hands hovering over an area of the body.
163
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

The hands-off techniques give you more options for treating others. You can
use these techniques as part of a regular Reiki session or as the main course
of treatment for people who can’t or don’t want to be touched.
Use the hands-off technique when treating any areas you can’t touch, such as
burns or the genital area.
Beaming Reiki energy 
from across the room
Sending energy across the room is similar to distant Reiki (see Chapter 15)
except that the person is still in the same room as you. You can stand away
from the recipient and hold your hands up at shoulder level. Feel the Reiki
energy leave your hands and treat the recipient’s entire body and aura at
once. You can also use beaming to treat a particular area on the body.
This technique is useful for children or pets who may not let you get near
them for hands-on or even hands-just-above-the-body treatment.
Using your breath and your eyes
The following two techniques come in handy when you’re working on some-
one and have your hands on one place but feel the need to also send Reiki to
another place. You can send Reiki through your eyes (or breath) to reach the
third place (the first and second being where your hands are). In this way,
your breath and your eyes are extra “hands of Reiki.” You can use the follow-
ing techniques during a normal Reiki session, when treating objects, and with
long-distance healing (see Chapter 15).
Gyosi Ho
The Gyosi Ho method of healing is done by staring. Here’s how to use it:
1. Connect with the object or person to whom you want to send Reiki
through the eyes.
Do this by gazing softly.
164
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

2. Stare at the spot where you are sending the Reiki and let the energy
flow from your eyes.
You can visualize Reiki symbols (Chapter 8) in your eyes and follow
your gaze.
3. When you finish focusing on one area, return your eyes to a 
soft gaze.
You can now look at another spot to send Reiki.
Koki Ho
Koki Ho is a method of healing done with the breath. Here’s how to use it:
1. Prepare yourself by concentrating the Reiki energy in your body
(see Chapter 9 for techniques).
You can follow the procedures for Gassho or contracting the Hui Yin
(See Chapter 9).
2. Breathe in and bring your breath down into your belly.
This is also called hara breathing (hara is Japanese for belly). 
3. Imagine or draw with your tongue the Cho Ku Rei (or another symbol)
on the inside of your mouth.
4. As you exhale, blow the symbol or Reiki energy toward the part of the
recipient’s body you want to treat.
Balancing Chakras with Reiki
The chakras are a set of seven major energy centers that encompass the
physical, mental, and spiritual layers of the energy body (see Chapter 2).
The standard hand positions listed in the earlier section “Examining Full-
Body Hand Positions” cover all the chakras.
Some practitioners give the chakras emphasis, knowing that having a balanced
chakra will bring many of the organs into balance as well. When treating the
chakras, you can use the any of the techniques outlined in this chapter and
the rest of the book. Byosen scanning of the chakras allows you to sense with
165
Chapter 10: Healing Others with Reiki Positions and Techniques

your hands where there is an imbalance in one of the chakras (see the section
“Byosen Reikan Ho: Scanning the body,” earlier in this chapter). To treat a
chakra, you can do any of the following:
 Send Reiki directly to the chakra with your hands above or touching
the body.
 Send Reiki with your eyes or your breath.
 Use your hands in the front and back of the chakra (separately or 
simultaneously).
 Move your hands as you hold them above the chakra: Move them in
a clockwise and/or counterclockwise position or tap the air above the
chakra.
 When working on all the chakras, start with the first and move up to the
seventh chakra.
 Try connecting chakras by holding two at one time, for example, the
heart chakra and the sacral chakra.
The ideas I list here are suggestions. Use your intuition while treating the
chakras.

Applying Reiki to Yourself
In This Chapter
 Exploring the benefits of self-Reiki
 Getting ready for self-Reiki
 Finding out the hand positions
B
efore you try to help others through Reiki, using Reiki on yourself is an
important and essential step. By doing self-Reiki, you’ll see the truth
and value of two age-old pieces of advice, “Healer, heal thyself” and “Practice
makes perfect.” And the benefits to you of regular self-Reiki sessions are great
indeed.
The regular self-application of Reiki enables you to heal your body, mind,
emotions, and spirit. Healing resolves issues, illness, and blocks so you can
experience enlightenment, joy, or even bliss!
Self-Reiki is covered in the first level of Reiki training, after you have received
your first attunements (initiations) to the Reiki energy flow (see Chapter 7).
In this chapter, I discuss the importance of making time for yourself and
describe the standard hand positions to use as a basis for a Reiki self-
treatment. 
Putting Yourself First
If you don’t put yourself first when it comes to Reiki, no one else will. You
probably know how important relaxing and taking care of yourself are for
your health, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you actually take the time
you need for relaxation and stress release. You’ll discover, however, that find-
ing ways to fit Reiki into your schedule makes good sense.

Most 1st degree Reiki classes teach self-Reiki, and many teachers suggest or
even require a 21-day (3-week) practice of self-Reiki (see Chapter 7). This 21-
day cycle is just about enough time to develop a new habit, so by practicing
self-Reiki for the 3 weeks, you give yourself a new life-enhancing practice.
Twenty-one was also the number of days that Mikao Usui spent meditating on
Mount Kurama, where he had his revelation about Reiki!
Discovering the benefits of self-Reiki
Like any Reiki session, self-Reiki gives you the benefit of the universal energy
flowing into your body. Reiki can help you relax, remove tension, and heal
your body, mind, and spirit. By doing Reiki daily, you can help maintain a
high level of health.
During self-Reiki, you might enter the dreamlike state of meditation and find
that you see images or get another form of inspiration. Write down any ideas
that come to you during your sessions (see Chapter 19 for more info on keep-
ing a Reiki journal). You can also keep track of any health benefits you find
while performing Reiki regularly.
Self-Reiki also prepares you to be a better Reiki practitioner for others. By
treating yourself before treating others you do the following:
 Open yourself to be a clearer and more open Reiki channel
 Put yourself in the mind-set that’s more likely to receive intuitive 
information
 Set the intention to honor yourself
To get the full benefit of the relaxation and healing that Reiki brings, try to
give yourself Reiki on a regular basis. Like all things, the more attention and
time you give to your self-Reiki, the more benefit you get. Because self-Reiki
keeps your energy running smoothly, you can look at self-Reiki as a form of
preventive medicine.
Creating ways to incorporate self-Reiki
It’s up to you to make the time and effort to give yourself Reiki — no one will
do it for you (unless you book a Reiki session with another practitioner; see
Chapter 5).
168
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

Here are some ways to incorporate self-Reiki into your day:
 Schedule self-Reiki sessions in your appointment book.
 Give yourself Reiki every morning before getting out of bed.
 Give yourself Reiki every night before going to sleep.
The time you allot for self-Reiki can vary. You can give yourself a luxurious
hour-long session of about three to five minutes per position. Another option
is to devise a shorter session for yourself that runs 15 minutes.
Preparing to Give Yourself Reiki
Just as you would prepare to give a Reiki session for someone else (see
Chapters 9 and 13), you can set the stage for a special experience for yourself
and boost the levels of Reiki you’re channeling. You can do several things in
advance of self-Reiki in order to enhance the experience:
 Use one or more of the meditation and focusing techniques listed in
Chapter 9, such as Joshin Kokyu Ho and Seishin Toitsu, before treating
yourself.
 Use intention (to set the Reiki energy flowing), intuition (to know where
to put your hands and when to move them), and integrity (to remember
to treat yourself with the utmost of respect).
 Make your personal self-Reiki session special by setting the stage with
music, candlelight, aromatherapy, or any other relaxing or sensual plea-
sure. Do for yourself what you would do for others!
169
Chapter 11: Applying Reiki to Yourself
Giving yourself a quickie Reiki session 
You can give yourself a quick spot of Reiki as
needed! Some people call this “spot Reiki” or a
Reiki mini-session. You don’t perform a full ses-
sion but use Reiki on an as-needed basis. So if
you trip and hurt your foot, you can sit down and
give your foot Reiki for a few minutes.
If you’re feeling stressed, you can give yourself
Reiki while waiting in line at the supermarket —
as long as you do so discreetly! You can just
touch your chest or your hand, which won’t look
out of the ordinary. Or use Reiki if you are suf-
fering with sleeplessness in the middle of the
night, taking a bath, or talking to a friend on the
telephone. Whenever you feel the urge, you can
put one hand on a part of your body and intend
the Reiki to flow.

Treating Yourself with Reiki
Use the hand positions described in this section when giving yourself a full
self-Reiki session. An advantage of giving Reiki to yourself, as opposed to
being in a spa or clinic, is that you can choose where and when to perform
the Reiki. A full session lasts about an hour, but you can add or subtract min-
utes to fit your own needs and schedule. If you have less time, skip some of
the hand positions. If you have more time, you can linger on each position or
add more positions (see the section “Being creative with positions,” later in
this chapter).
In terms of what to wear, you can be in your pajamas or your work clothes, as
long as you’re comfortable. Removing any heavy jewelry, glasses, a watch, or
belt is always a good idea. You can be seated in a comfortable chair or lying
on your bed. 
You can use your self-Reiki sessions for relaxation purposes or for healing of
a serious illness. In either case, the more time and effort you dedicate to
practicing self-Reiki, the more you get out of it.
Listing the self-Reiki hand positions
If you’re a beginner to self-Reiki, I suggest you go through the following 
15 positions in the given order, for a set amount of time on each position: 
30 seconds to 5 minutes each, depending on how much time you have.
After practicing this series of self-Reiki positions once or twice, you can read
Chapter 10 to get more detailed information about the benefits of each hand
position and tips on knowing when to move to the next position.
One note on carrying out the hand positions: Your fingers can be touching or
not touching. Although some Reiki experts give rules on such things, I feel
that using the most comfortable position for you is the best approach.
Starting at the head
Start your session by placing your hands on your head and face:
1. Eyes: Begin your self-Reiki session by covering your eyes with your
hands, with your fingers on either side of your nose and fingers
pointed upwards. Breathe deeply as you begin to relax into the self-
Reiki session. (See Figure 11-1.)
170
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

2. Top of your head: Gently cover your crown at the top of your head
with fingers pointing toward each other and just touching. (See 
Figure 11-2.)
3. Back of your head: You can use two variations for working at the back
of your head. For the first position, put your hands on the back of
your head with fingers facing upward and pointer (second) fingers
just touching (see Figure 11-3). For the alternate position, place your
left hand at the base of your head and your right hand just above,
with each hand facing toward the opposite ear while gripping the
head.
Use the position that feels most comfortable for your arms. Both of
these positions are very calming.
4. Side of your face: Hold your hands on the side of your face with fin-
gers pointing upward. See (Figure 11-4.)
Your hands are resting on the sides of your cheeks just before your ears.
This position relieves facial tension and is good if you have dental pain.
An optional position here is to hold your hands with fingers facing
upward over your ears.

Moving down the front of the body
From your face, you gracefully move your hands down your body to give
Reiki to your throat, chest, and abdomen.
5. Throat (see Figure 11-5): Treat your neck by cupping your hands
around your throat.
Hold your wrists together and let your fingers form a ring around your
neck.
6. Throat and heart (see Figure 11-6): Place your left hand over your
throat and your right hand over your heart.
You can also use the opposite hand formation, if that feels better to you! 
Figure 11-4:

hands to the

Chapter 11: Applying Reiki to Yourself

7. Upper chest (see Figure 11-7): Place both hands on your chest area
above your breasts, with fingers facing each other.
8. Upper abdomen: Place your hands just under your breasts, on your
upper stomach, with fingers facing each other. (See Figure 11-8.)
Positions 7 and 8 are close to your heart chakra, but you can also cover
your breasts directly when you work on yourself.
9. Middle abdomen: Place your hands on your abdomen, with hands 
on either side of your navel, with fingers facing each other. (See
Figure 11-9.)

10. Lower abdomen: Put your hands with fingertips just touching, in a V
shape pointing downward over your belly. (See Figure 11-10.)
Switching to the back
Which positions you reach on your back, and how you reach them, depends
on your flexibility! Do the best you can to reach some areas of your back.
11. Shoulders: To reach your shoulders, put your hands behind your head
and down onto your shoulders. (See Figure 11-11.)
An optional position here for the very flexible is to reach behind your
heart area, in the middle of your shoulder blades.
12. Waist: Reach around and put your hands on your middle back around
the back of your waist. (See Figure 11-12.)
13. Lower back: Move your hands to rest on your lower back, parallel to
your hips. (See Figure 11-13.)

Don’t forget the legs and feet
Some people leave out their legs and feet, but you should include them if you
have problems with these parts of your body. And it helps to feel that the ses-
sion really covers your entire body when you include the legs and feet. 
Treating your legs and feet is probably easiest if you sit in a chair and bring
one leg up at a time to reach your hands. Or if you lie down, you can bend
your legs to reach your knees.
The last two positions aren’t illustrated, but I know that you know where they
are. I leave it to you to find a way to give Reiki to your ankles and feet,
because how you hold these positions really depends on your flexibility.
14. Knees: Cover your knees with your hands (see Figure 11-14).
15. Ankles: Place your hand around your ankle.
16. Feet: Reach to your feet and hold the bottom of each foot.
You can hold each foot one at a time.

Chapter 11: Applying Reiki to Yourself

Being creative with positions
Use the standard hand positions as a starting point to discover what works
best for you. When you feel comfortable with the positions I describe earlier,
you may want to branch out with other positions.
Here are some ideas that work for me, but everyone is different so use what
works for you.
 Treat yourself from the front and back of your body simultaneously.
Here’s what I mean:
• Put one hand on the front of your neck by your throat and another
hand on the back of your neck. This position allows the throat
chakra energy to really expand!
• If you’re limber, you can put one hand in front of your heart and
one behind your heart on your back.
• Another great position is to put one hand in front of your belly and
one on your lower back.
• You can nurture your knee with one hand cupping it from behind
and another hand gently soothing it on the top.
Figure 11-14:

the knees.
180
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

 You can also add positions covering or hovering over your breast (heart
chakra) and/or groin (root chakra). Neither of these is considered a stan-
dard position because of sensitivity toward inappropriate touching of
sexual organs. But when you’re working on yourself, you can give your-
self a boost in these areas.
 Add other positions as you need or like, such as on your wrists, arms,
thighs, or ankles.
Check out Chapter 10, which describes how to give a Reiki session to some-
one else, for more ideas on using Reiki. It’s always good to try new hand posi-
tions on yourself first.
181
Chapter 11: Applying Reiki to Yourself
Treating yourself for illness
Self-Reiki is especially invaluable for people
who have chronic illnesses like cancer, which
may have complex causes and effects in the
body that need sustained treatment over a
period of time. Some hospitals offer Reiki train-
ing to their patients as a form of take-home self-
care. When you can give yourself Reiki, you’ll
be able to schedule an appointment with your-
self daily.
If you’re dealing with a serious or long-term ill-
ness, you also will probably want to visit a Reiki
practitioner for complementary support of any
medical treatment you are undertaking.
You may also want to learn Reiki so that you can
give healing energy to yourself between ses-
sions with your practitioner.

In This Chapter
 Digging into the history and healing power of crystals
 Finding out about crystals, rocks, and gems
 Choosing the right crystals for you
 Cleansing crystals
 Programming crystals
 Using crystals in Reiki
T
he ancient art of crystal healing relies on the subtle energy emanations of
different crystals (see Chapter 2 for info about subtle energy). Crystals
are used nowadays in medical machinery and quartz watches, as well as to
adorn the body as jewelry. Crystal healing is increasingly recognized as a
useful complementary medicine.
The use of crystals for healing is a separate practice from that of Reiki, but
many Reiki practitioners like to have crystals on hand and may use them
alongside Reiki. Using crystals with Reiki is like having an extra pair of hands!
Crystals are the mineral formations from deep within the earth. They come in
different shapes and colors. You’ve probably seen clusters of crystal quartz
or lavender-colored amethysts and been amazed by their intricate beauty.
Each crystal has its own special energy.
Crystals are a sparkling expression of the beauty of nature. You can’t help but
admire their quality of color, form, and sometimes even the scale. Wonder,
awe, admiration, and inspiration come from observing or being in the pres-
ence of crystals. For a person who is skeptical whether crystals impart any
magical qualities, just liking beautiful objects is a reason to have crystals in
the Reiki room, or anywhere else for that matter.

You don’t need to use crystals to practice Reiki, but because many Reiki prac-
titioners combine these two forms of energy work, I present information you
can use if you want to try your hand with crystals.
Exploring the Healing Power of Crystals
Just look at a crystal and see where it leads. You may find that crystals trig-
ger a feeling, memory, or journey of some sort. Even if you’re not sure about
the metaphysical properties of mineral crystals, crystals can be useful for a
variety of other reasons:
 People need certain minerals (the substances from which crystals are
made) to survive. Iron, potassium, magnesium, and other minerals are
essential for cellular activity.
 People wear gems or precious stones as jewelry and adornment. Think
of wedding rings, birthstones, and earrings.
 Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners use minerals along with
botanical and animal product herbs.
184
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 
Are you crystal crazy?
A basic elementary school lesson teaches stu-
dents how to classify matter into one of the
three kingdoms: animal, plant, or mineral. In this
scheme, animals and plants are considered to
be alive, while minerals are considered inert
and lifeless. However, as with plants and pets,
people who love crystals tend to collect strays
and new crystals when they travel.
Are you one of those people who feel that crys-
tals are special and have their own unique
subtle energies? Here’s a fun quiz to see
whether you’re a closet crystal hugger:
 Have you ever found yourself gazing into a
crystal, entranced by its beauty?
 Do you collect rocks and carry them from
place to place when you move?
 Do you have a lot of crystal jewelry?
 Have you gone digging for crystals?
 Is your house being taken over by members
of the mineral kingdom? (If you’ve become a
rockhound or crystal collector, this is a real
possibility.)
If you’ve answered yes to any of these ques-
tions, you’re probably caught by the crystal
spell. But remember that you don’t need to
acquire a lot of crystals to enjoy them!

You may want to use crystals the next time you meditate. Try holding a crys-
tal or gazing at it during meditation.
Sensing the energy of crystals
Just as you have an aura and transmit your own unique energy (see Chapter 2),
crystals also have their own energy. Each type of mineral, such as a diamond
or amethyst, has its own signature energy. Within each type, the individual
stones may also have slight variations.
When you’re choosing jewelry for example, you might look at two similar
malachite earrings, but one pair will look better to you. That’s the lure of a
particular crystal — you’re intuitively drawn to the exact crystal that you
need for a particular situation.
Each crystal emits an energy. You can sense this energy the same way you
sense energy with Reiki.
Knowing the lore of crystals
People have believed in the power of crystals for centuries and many are fas-
cinated by the lore, or stories, associated with crystals. Many ancient cul-
tures have used minerals, crystals, or gems, including the Egyptians, Chinese,
Indians, and Native Americans.
Some people believe that certain crystals or gemstones (a precious form of
crystal) can do the following:
 Enhance perception (think of a crystal ball)
 Give protection
 Heal disease
Information that is available on different crystals and their healing powers for
different ailments is based on the centuries of information gleaned from
ancient cultures.
Reiki and crystals can go hand in hand, working together to aid intuition and
healing. In terms of healing, they both work at all levels of the body and the
aura (see Chapter 2).
185
Chapter 12: Reiki Rocks! Using Crystals with Reiki

Table 12-1 shows how crystals are associated with the chakras (discussed in
Chapter 2) and some of the symbolic rulerships they’re thought to have.
Take this table as fun reading and a starting point when looking at associa-
tions of certain crystals with each chakra. The color association is a good
place to start when you use crystals, but each crystal is more complex than
just a color. For example, clear quartz contains all the colors and works at
every level of healing. The same thing can be said of the more expensive dia-
monds. Now you know why I include quartz and diamond along with the sev-
enth chakra, which is traditionally associated with violet.

Distinguishing between Crystals, 
Rocks, and Gems
When you decide to use crystals along with Reiki, it helps to know just what
type of stone you have or which type of stone to look for. Here’s some back-
ground on where crystals come from and which ones are gems.
You might sense the earth as solid, but deep within our planet, molten lava or
magma bubbles away. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanoes
result from the constant activity and eventual release of pressure from the
steam of hot magma.
Thankfully, the earth’s surface is a solid layer that contains mountains, rocks,
sand, and crystals. If you went on a hike through desert mountains, where
the earth’s crust is more revealed due to the absence of abundant plant life,
you might find the following:
 Elements: The chemical components of the earth are called elements.
Silver, gold, and iron are examples of elements that on their own make
up crystals. The chemical symbols for these elements are Ag for silver,
Au for gold, and Fe for iron.
 Minerals: Most minerals are made from combinations of elements. Two
or more elements combine to form a mineral. Chalcedony, for example,
is a type of mineral formed by the chemical elements silicon (Si) and
oxygen (O2) to form silicon dioxide (SiO2). Other elements may combine
with the silicon dioxide to give other minerals different colors. Red chal-
cedony is formed from silicon dioxide plus iron.
187
Chapter 12: Reiki Rocks! Using Crystals with Reiki
Making rainbows with cut glass crystal
Wedding registries and fine drinking glasses
may come to mind when you think of crystal. Or
you may think of those beautiful sparkly cut-
glass crystals that throw rainbows all over the
room in bright sunshine (or moonlight for that
matter). Although crystal glasses that have a
musical ring and rainbow-producing glass crys-
tal balls are beautiful, they’re entirely different
from the mineral crystals that are the subject of
this chapter. I learned Reiki in a studio that had
crystals hanging in windows with plants. These
elements created a beautiful ambience for the
Reiki clinics that were held twice weekly.
While glass crystal is beautiful, it doesn’t have
the same energy properties as the crystals that
come from minerals of the earth.

 Crystals: The repeated arrangement of minerals into distinct geometric
shapes is called a crystal. The geometric pattern or shape is unique to
each type of crystal. Crystals are fascinating because of this beautifully
ordered construction.
 Rocks: A rock or stone is a hard substance formed from minerals or 
petrified life forms. Crystals are frequently found within rocks.
 Gems: A gem is a crystal stone (or pearl) that is considered precious
due to its ability to be cut, polished, and used in jewelry or other prod-
ucts. Diamonds, emeralds, and pearls are examples of gems.
Some gems come from living things rather than minerals. This category
includes pearls, coral, amber, and jet. Like their mineral counterparts, these
remnants of life also emit a subtle energy, and though they are not really crys-
tals, they are included in the practice of crystal healing.
I focus on crystals for the remainder of this chapter. But remember that crys-
tals are made of minerals, which are made of elements. Crystals are some-
times considered gems (which will make them more expensive to obtain),
and crystals are found in rocks.
Many crystals used for healing purposes are reasonably priced, including the
powerful clear quartz crystal that is used to amplify healing. Herkimer dia-
monds, for example (which aren’t really diamonds but a type of quartz found
mainly in Herkimer County, New York) are clear stones. Colored types of
quartz are also available, including smoky quartz and rose quartz.
Finding the Right Crystals for You
Crystals are widely available at specialist stores and on the Web. You may
even find some crystals when you go out hiking (although this depends on
where you go and whether taking crystals or rocks home with you is legal).
Considering the crystal’s shape
Crystals vary as a result of different alignments of elements in the geometric
lattice shape that forms the crystal. In addition, each crystal is found in dif-
ferent outer forms, either as a result of natural formation or from cutting the
natural stone. Here are the different shapes of crystals:
188
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

 Crystal ball: The ball-shaped crystal is famous in lore as the medium of
the gypsy fortuneteller. The practice of using a crystal ball to see
through time is called scrying.
 Wand: You can use crystals in a wand shape for Reiki healing. Try pro-
gramming the wand with Reiki energy (see the section “Giving Your
Crystal a Reiki Charge,” later in this chapter). One idea is to “draw” the
symbols by using the crystal wand as a pencil over the part of the body
you want to send healing to.
 Points: Many crystals end in points. During healing, the point can be
turned toward the recipient to bring in energy and turned away from the
recipient to draw out energy.
You can find crystal shapes with many other names, including double-
terminated, cluster, geode, egg, and pyramid. The same healing energy is
found in a crystal no matter whether it is polished or unpolished, cut in one
particular shape, or uncut.
Don’t be confused by the plethora of crystals that are available. Instead, use
your intuition to lead you to the right crystal to use alongside Reiki healing
and your intention will lead you to use it in the right way.
Choosing which crystal to use
If you’re considering using crystals for your own Reiki healing or the healing
of others, try one of these methods to choose which crystal to use:
 Energy scanning: Use your hands to sense the energy of the different
crystals. This technique is similar to the technique used to scan before
giving a Reiki treatment (see Chapter 10).
 Meditation: Close your eyes and see which, if any, of your crystals come
to mind.
 Pendulum: Some people use a crystal pendulum to get a message, such
as yes or no for a particular crystal (see Chapter 2).
If you’re working with a Reiki recipient, you can ask the person to pick a crys-
tal. The person will intuitively pick the crystal he or she needs at that time.
Know that whichever crystal you do use is the right one. Trust your intuition
and the inherent wisdom of the crystal and the healing process as a whole.
189
Chapter 12: Reiki Rocks! Using Crystals with Reiki

Before using crystals in healing, apply the same principles you would use in a
regular Reiki session. Use integrity, intuition, and intention. Say a prayer of
healing intent before choosing and using your crystals.
Staying Crystal Clear: Cleaning 
a Crystal’s Energy
Crystals have their own special intrinsic energies. Most crystals also take on
the energies of people or situations around them. A crystal that has taken on
other energies may have less effect of its own, or you may even detect some
of the negative energies of others.
The importance of cleansing and charging your crystals is really part of con-
necting with your crystal and asking for its highest potential for healing.
If you use crystals for healing yourself or others or if the crystals have been
sitting around your house for a while, you’ll want to clean them. Just like
washing your countertop between meals or painting your walls to freshen
them up, your crystals need regular cleaning attention. If you want your crys-
tals to help you as much as possible, they deserve the best treatment, so
keep them clean.
Knowing how to cleanse your crystal
Crystals need to be cleaned to remove dust and dirt, fingerprints, and even
energy imprints from people or situations. Take care when cleaning to avoid
harming a delicate crystal. Check with an expert in crystals or a crystal book
(see the Appendix) to find out more about how to clean individual crystals.
Here are some things to use to clean your crystals:
 Distilled water: Sprinkle or run the crystals under pure water.
 Sunlight: Set your crystals (except amethyst, which may fade) in bright
cleansing sunlight.
 Moonlight: Let your crystal absorb the power of the moon.
 Salt: Cover your crystals with salt. Discard this salt when you’re 
finished.
190
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

 Incense: Pass the crystal through the smoke of a cleansing incense such
as sage; this technique is called smudging.
 Soil: Some folks bury crystals in the soil to remove particularly negative
energy. You can wrap the crystals in cotton or another natural material
before putting them into the ground.
 Reiki: You can use Reiki to cleanse your crystal. Put the crystal in your
hands and use the Cho Ku Rei, or power, symbol (see Chapter 8 for info
about Reiki symbols). Or try the Japanese technique of Jakikiri Joka Ho.
Jakikiri Joka Ho: Another way 
to clean crystals
This Japanese Reiki method, Jakikiri Joka Ho, breaks away negative energy
for cleaning inanimate objects. The meaning behind the name of this method
can be broken down like so:
 Jaki means “bad energy.”
 Kiri means “to cut.”
 Joka means “purification.”
 Ho means “method.”
Use this method on crystals (or any other nonliving object) by doing the 
following:
1. Hold the crystal in your left or nondominant hand.
2. Set your intention to cleanse the crystal of all negative energy.
3. Hold your dominant hand over the crystal and perform three quick
chops (like a karate chop) in the air just over the crystal.
The crystal is now ready to be programmed or charged with energy.
If you want, you can perform Gassho with your hands in a prayer position
(see Chapter 9) before and after this technique.
191
Chapter 12: Reiki Rocks! Using Crystals with Reiki

Giving Your Crystal a Reiki Charge
Crystals have their own intrinsic energy, but they also respond to the Reiki
symbols (see Chapter 8). In crystal therapy-speak, adding an energy to a
crystal is called charging it. Another word you may hear is programming your
crystal, which could mean adding a Reiki symbol or adding an intention, such
as healing or manifesting abundance.
By charging your crystal with Reiki, you embed the crystal with Reiki, which
can then be transmitted (and amplified) through the crystal.
Before giving Reiki, make sure the crystal is cleansed (see “Staying Crystal
Clear: Cleaning a Crystal’s Energy,” earlier in the chapter).
You can give any Reiki energy or symbol to a crystal by holding the crystal in
your hands and sending Reiki out through your hands while visualizing the
symbol and saying the symbol’s name three times out loud or to your self:
 Give the Power symbol (Cho Ku Rei) for basic empowerment. Even if
you’ve used Cho Ku Rei for cleansing, I would give the symbol’s energy
again.
 Give the Distance symbol (Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen) if you will use the crys-
tal for distance healing.
 If you’re a Reiki Master Teacher, you can even give your crystal an
attunement so that it is a Master Teacher too!
After the Reiki crystal is charged, it will send the Reiki symbol continuously.
When placed in a room, a crystal charged with the Power symbol Cho Ku Rei
will continuously send that cleansing energy into the room.
If you haven’t been initiated into the symbols yet (see Chapter 8), you can
send Reiki through your hands to the crystal without using the symbols. And
if the crystal is too big to place in your hands, just put your hand or hands
over the crystal and send Reiki that way.
An advanced Western Reiki technique is to construct a healing grid with crys-
tals. The grid is simply a set of crystals lined up in a determined formation
(such as a circle or octagon). Reiki practitioners charge a set of quartz crys-
tals with Reiki symbols and use these crystals to construct a healing grid that
continuously sends Reiki as distant healing to loved ones who have their
192
Part III: Becoming Well-Versed in Reiki 

photos placed on the grid. You could place pieces of paper with someone’s
name or other objects within the circle of quartz crystals. By using the Reiki-
charged stones as well as an intention of healing, you set a powerful healing
in motion.
Bringing Crystals to the Reiki Table
After you have some crystals at hand and you’ve cleansed and charged them
with Reiki energy, you can use them to aid in the Reiki session.
You might think of Reiki energy as coming from heaven and crystal energy as
coming from earth. In that way, Reiki and crystals complement each other
during a Reiki treatment.
Knowing which crystals to use
As you use crystals more often, you’ll gain the confidence and experience to
choose which crystals to use for treating different ailments. If you haven’t
used crystals before, you may run into a lot of advice from different people
telling you which crystals are right for you. However, if you check in with
your intuition regularly, you’ll know which crystal is right. If you should be
using a different stone, you’ll know that too. If you read enough books and
speak to enough people, you’ll hear differing information about which crys-
tals to use. For that reason, developing your own intuition and the confidence
to follow it is key.
Each of the chakras (see Chapter 2) is associated with different colors. You
can choose crystals with these colors to help treat energy imbalances in a
particular chakra (refer to Table 12-1).
You might start your journey with crystals with a set of chakra-balancing
stones that contains a set of seven polished crystals associated with each of
the chakras. Try holding each of these crystals and meditating with it to see
how the energies differ.
When you determine that a certain chakra is unbalanced, you can use a crys-
tal associated with that chakra during your treatment. For example, you can
use rose quartz to treat the heart chakra.
193
Chapter 12: Reiki Rocks! Using Crystals with Reiki

Placing the crystals during a Reiki session
The crystals are helpers in the process of Reiki healing. You can choose from
many ways to bring them into your session:
 Wear crystal jewelry so that the energy is coming through you and is
around you while you treat with Reiki.
 Keep crystals in the room. In this way the energy is always flowing to
keep Reiki energy strong.
 Put crystals under the table. While you work on the top of the table, the
crystal can send energy through the bottom of the table. I place crystals
under strategic locations, such as the heart chakra.
 Give the recipient a crystal or two to hold. This lends a sense of comfort.
 Place crystals on the recipient’s body or just around the body. For exam-
ple, you can place a rose quartz in the middle of the chest on the heart
chakra and clear quartz above the head. Use Table 12-1 to get some
ideas of crystals to use at different chakras.
Continuing with the theme of the healing grid, described earlier in this chap-
ter, another advanced technique is to place cleansed and charged crystals
around a Reiki recipient in a grid. What this means is that a set of stones is
placed at designated positions on or around the recipient’s body. This tech-
nique combines Reiki with crystal healing techniques. If you want to work
with crystals in this way, I suggest you seek out a teacher who includes crys-
tals in the Reiki course or find a specific course in using crystals with Reiki.
Use Chapter 7 for suggestions on how to find a teacher and course: You’ll
have to inquire specially to see who offers classes that include crystals.

Sharing Reiki 
with Others

In this part . . .
You’re ready to take the techniques you found out
about in Part III and begin to channel the Reiki energy
to help others. I tell you how to design a Reiki session of
your own from start to finish, and I describe community
events like Reiki shares and circles, where you can give
and receive Reiki with other Reiki practitioners and also
bring Reiki to your community. This is a great way to meet
other people interested in Reiki and practice your new
skills. If your Reiki recipient is far away, use the long-
distance techniques that I explain to send Reiki across
both time and space — pretty amazing stuff.
I also describe how to combine Reiki with other forms of
healing, including medicine, massage and other body work,
and therapeutic work. Increasingly, Reiki is used in medical
situations, including emergency medicine and before and
after surgery to augment the medical treatments.
When you’re ready to start your own Reiki practice, check
out the final chapter in this part for tips and advice on
things to consider to make your practice a success.

Chapter 13
Putting Together a Reiki 
Healing Session
In This Chapter
 Discovering your personal style
 Getting yourself and the space ready for Reiki
 Combining different healing practices
 Practicing with integrity
 Working through a session from start to finish
 Being guided during the session
 Keeping negative energy away
A
Reiki session is like a live performance. Each one is different, and each
requires that you, as the Reiki practitioner, be something of a “live
wire,” because you are the actor through which the Reiki energy flows. The
Reiki recipient is your receiver, or audience. For a successful “show,” you
must set the stage for healing and prepare yourself to let the energy flow
through you.
Just as you would read a script before reading the lines of a play, read
Chapter 9 to discover how to prepare yourself to channel the energy and
Chapter 10 to review the positions and techniques to use.
This chapter is about what it’s like to work one on one with someone in an
individual session. Your role is to be open and ready for the Reiki to come
through you. You set the stage by getting the room ready for Reiki. You guide
the recipient through your attitude and kindness. By maintaining a sense of
nonjudgment and love, you give the recipient a sense of ease and relaxation.

A Reiki practitioner doesn’t control the outcome of healing. The intention of
Reiki is to provide the highest level of healing. Spirit determines the form that
the healing takes.
Finding Your Reiki Style
Before starting a Reiki session, get a feel for your own personal style of work-
ing with Reiki. Each Reiki practitioner has his or her own style of working.
You may learn from your Reiki teacher, but eventually you make the tech-
niques your own. Here are some tips on developing your own style:
 Become knowledgeable about different Reiki techniques (listed through-
out the book).
 Go to different Reiki circles and participate (see Chapter 14). You’ll dis-
cover what you like best as you experience different techniques.
 Try out different techniques. You can use the techniques in this chapter
or vary the symbols you use (see Chapter 8). Practice the meditation
and focusing techniques in Chapter 9.
 Combine your knowledge of Reiki techniques with your developing 
intuition. In this way, you give each recipient a uniquely tailored Reiki
session.
Preparing Yourself to Give Reiki
The more time you spend preparing yourself before giving Reiki, the calmer
you’ll be, and the more pleasant the experience will be for you and the
receiver. Here are some ways to become ready to give Reiki:
 Consider your clothing. Be sure that you’re comfortable and that your
jewelry or clothing won’t get in the way of the treatment.
 Wash your hands and brush your teeth. You are working near some-
one’s body and their nostrils. Personal hygiene is important so the recip-
ient isn’t distracted by what you had for lunch. Washing your hands is a
good step to take before any Reiki session and in between sessions.
 Become present and connected to Reiki energy. Detach from what you
were doing before the session and get in the spirit of the Reiki session to
come. Just taking a few deep breaths and connecting for a few minutes
will help you feel centered, grounded, and connected. I discuss tech-
niques to increase your Reiki flow more thoroughly in Chapter 9.
198
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Come to the Reiki session with a clean body and spirit. This advice may seem
obvious, but don’t perform Reiki if you are under the influence of alcohol or
illegal drugs. Some people avoid caffeine and nicotine before a session. These
substances overload the body and may reduce your ability to channel energy.
Getting Your Surroundings Ready
The Reiki room needs to be clean, neat, and quiet so that you can create a
comfortable space where healing can occur. The following advice can help
you create such a room:
 Locate an appropriate space. The best option is to have a dedicated
room for Reiki that you can set up and leave it as you like. If you use a
room that does double duty for other tasks, try to keep clutter and other
distractions to a minimum.
 Play soft gentle music. Music is soothing and can help you and the
recipient relax and take in the Reiki energy. Have a selection of different
types of music: instrumental, New Age, chanting, or anything else you
find that helps you get in the Reiki mood.
 Have the following supplies on hand:
• Tissues
• Drinking water and cups
• Pillows and blankets
 Use candles and incense with discretion. Candles are good at setting a
mood, but the smoke from incense or candles can irritate some people.
Some recipients may be sensitive to certain fragrances, so ask before
burning such objects.
 Create a spot where recipients can hang their jackets and store their
personal belongings.
 Keep the room clean and vacuumed. Keep clutter to a minimum (see
more info about this topic in Chapter 18).
 Keep the room energetically cleaned. Use plants, crystals (see 
Chapter 12), sunshine, and air purifiers.
199
Chapter 13: Putting Together a Reiki Healing Session

Before a session, you may want to open a window, burn some incense (but
watch for lingering smoke), say a prayer, or otherwise clear the room of stag-
nant energy. (See the section “Cleansing the Reiki room,” later in this chapter,
for more information on clearing energy.)
Merging Different Healing Practices
If you have professional training in other healing modalities, by all means
combine them in your practice. Tell the person beforehand which healing
practices you will use. If the recipient wants only Reiki, respect that wish.
Chapter 16 describes how to combine different healing techniques with Reiki.
If you don’t have professional training or proper licenses to practice other
healing techniques, then don’t use them. You can practice massage on your
husband in the privacy of your home. But if you incorporate massage into
your Reiki session and you aren’t licensed to do so, you risk legal action.
Familiarize yourself with the legal aspects of Reiki, which I discuss briefly in
Chapter 17, but you really need to consult experts who are knowledgeable
about the laws where you live.
Considering Ethics and Boundaries
The relationship between Reiki giver and Reiki receiver is based on trust. The
recipient must be able to feel comfortable and trust that you will do her no
harm.
To treat a recipient with due respect goes beyond not purposefully harming
her. You must also follow these guidelines:
 Never touch a recipient’s private parts. Don’t touch the genitals, the
breast area, or the buttocks.
 Be clear about your intentions. State your intentions to yourself, to
spirit, and to the recipient. See Chapter 9 to read about intention and
prayer in Reiki.
 Avoid making promises. Don’t say that Reiki will cure a disease. Are you
really sure of that? Don’t keep someone from pursuing other types of
healthcare. See Chapter 16 to read about other types of healthcare.
200
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

The higher your level of integrity, the better the Reiki session will be. The
recipient will pick up on your high level of ethical integrity and is more likely
to trust you and the Reiki healing.
The International Association of Reiki Professionals has produced an excel-
lent Code of Ethics (see the Appendix) that you can use as checklist to make
sure that your own ethics are in order.
Recognizing that each person 
or situation is unique
From your training and experience you develop a personal style for giving a
Reiki treatment, but you should alter this for each recipient. For example, a
person who has problems with movement won’t be able to comfortably turn
over in the middle of the session. If someone comes to you with a specific
issue, you may modify or at least incorporate information about this issue
into your session. For example, you may need to repeat the intention to heal
or change the order or course of your treatment.
To help you determine appropriate Reiki usages, Table 13-1 shows when to
use different Reiki techniques. Some of these techniques are discussed later
in this chapter.

Chapter 13: Putting Together a Reiki Healing Session

Like all things in life, balance is essential. Be flexible enough to alter your
style to fit the Reiki recipient. But also maintain the style and structure of a
session that you need to keep Reiki flowing for you. Life would be boring if
each of us were exactly the same.
Sharing information with others
The Reiki recipient may reveal information to you about herself or others.
This information is confidential, so you shouldn’t repeat it to anyone else.
During meditation or Reiki sessions, you enter a quiet and sacred space. At
these times, messages may come for you or the Reiki recipient. An important
ethical issue is how much information to share with the recipient and when
to share it.
Use your intuition to guide you on what is appropriate. This matter is per-
sonal, and some people are open to receiving intuitive information and
others are not.
When you treat another person, you’re doing sacred work, so it’s best to err
on the side of not hurting anyone else. Sometimes the practitioner wants to
show off his psychic or intuitive abilities, or is excited to share information
received during a session. Before sharing any information with the recipient,
ask yourself, “Will sharing this information help?”
Respecting boundaries
The responsibility for healing lies squarely with the person who is receiving
Reiki. When the recipient asks you for Reiki, she is asking for help with her
own healing process. Your job is to be a conduit for this energy. Knowing
your role in the healing process, and staying within those boundaries, is
important for you and the recipient.
Boundaries get muddled when the practitioner takes on the responsibility for
healing someone else or when the practitioner doesn’t take care of her own
healing needs.
202
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Sometimes healers get confused about how to help people. In the desire to be
of service, you may get tangled up in other people’s affairs or go beyond your
comfort zone. If that happens, pull back and look at yourself. See where you
need more healing or self-love. Decide how much time you can give before or
after a session for telephone calls or consultation. Be clear with recipients
who need more time and energy than you can give and refer them to other
professionals as needed.
The greatest gift that you, as a teacher or healer, can give to others is to be
healthy yourself. When you have worked through your own issues and
removed your own energy blocks, the light and love you can then channel is
obvious to others.
Having confidence in your abilities as a Reiki practitioner lessens the need to
have to prove to anyone how good you are or the need to fix others. You can
gain confidence by working on your own healing and practicing the tech-
niques offered in this book.
Reiki is a limitless energy that flows through the practitioner. If you feel
depleted after a Reiki session, then you’re trying too hard. After a Reiki ses-
sion, you should feel enlivened by the Reiki energy that has been flowing
through you.
Going through the Session
The Reiki session has a beginning, middle, and end, just like three acts of a
play. The beginning sets the stage, the middle holds the energy, and the end
closes things off nicely. How you run things depends on how much time you
have. The average session lasts about one hour, but you may schedule
shorter or longer periods.
Starting the session
The way that you start the session sets the tone for the Reiki healing. After
you calm yourself and clear the room of clutter and stuck energy (see the
section “Cleaning and Protecting,” later in this chapter), you’re ready to
begin.
203
Chapter 13: Putting Together a Reiki Healing Session

This is the time to connect with your recipient and prepare the person for the
Reiki session. The following tips can help you prepare the recipient for Reiki:
 Make sure the person is comfortable on the table. Add bolsters, pillows,
or blankets as needed.
 If the recipient is new to Reiki, explain what you will do during the ses-
sion and what she can expect (recipients can expect to feel very
relaxed).
 Ask whether the recipient has a particular intention or need for this
Reiki session.
 Say a prayer or intention for the session, such as “We come together for
the highest level of Reiki healing today.”
 Use the aura cleansing technique (see the section “Exploring the tech-
nique of aura cleansing,” later in the chapter) to prepare the recipient
for Reiki.
Start with Byosen scanning (see Chapter 10), Reiji Ho (see Chapter 10), or go
right to the first hand position of the standard Reiki session (see Chapter 10).
Taking notes mid-session
Watch the clock and about midway through the session ask the person to
turn over if you will also be working on the other side of the body. Most prac-
titioners start by working on the front of the body while the recipient lies on
her back. But choose the positions that work best in each situation. If the
recipient is having back troubles, you may want to focus entirely on the back,
with the recipient lying on her stomach.
At this midway point, you can note whether you’re running fast or slow and
change the amount of time on any hand position. By using your intuition (see
the section “Receiving Guidance through Intuition,” later in this chapter), you
can determine whether you need to change the course of the treatment. For
example, you may be running slow and sense that the person needs more
time on the heart area, so you decide to reduce the amount of time spent on
the knees and ankles. Or you make a note to yourself to come back to the
heart when you finish working on the abdomen.
Ending the session
The session ends when you feel that the recipient has taken as much energy
as possible or you must stop because of the time on the clock. Be sure to do
the following at the close of the session:
204
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

 Seal in the Reiki and protect the recipient. When you end the session,
perform an aura cleansing (see the section “Exploring the technique of
aura cleansing,” later in this chapter) to seal in the Reiki you have just
given. You can also say a prayer of closing, such as this one:
“Thank you spirit for providing Reiki healing to [insert name of recipi-
ent] today. May she take away only that which is for her highest good.
May she be cleared of any stagnant or lower energy, which is now trans-
formed to light. May [insert name of recipient] be bathed in light and
protected as she integrates the healing performed today.”
 Cleanse and protect yourself. You do this by using Kenyoku Ho, or dry
bathing (see the section “Using the Kenyoku Ho technique,” later in this
chapter).
 Make sure the client is grounded. Reiki can make the recipient feel
spacey. It’s kind of like the feeling when you just wake up from a good
dream, and you don’t necessarily want to wake up and get out of bed!
You can help the client by holding on to the client’s feet at the end of the
session. Make sure the recipient sits for a while or walks around before
exiting.
 Share feedback with one another as appropriate. The recipient may
have questions about the session or want to share some thoughts or
reactions. You might share information such as “You seem much more
relaxed now.” Remember to take care in presenting information or giving
advice to someone else (I discuss this in the section, “Sharing informa-
tion with others,” earlier in this chapter). If you’re not a therapist or
doctor, don’t give psychological or medical advice.
 Plan for another session. You can give the recipient a business card or
make an appointment for a future date.
 Receive payment. If you didn’t get paid at the beginning of the session,
you can do so now.
Receiving Guidance through Intuition
You are being guided during a Reiki session. You receive that guidance through
your intuition. You may experience intuition as a gut feeling, instinct, or
insight. You may not even realize what’s happening, but you get a thought to
“move to the next position” or “put your hands over the heart.” This is the
type of intuition I am talking about in this situation.
205
Chapter 13: Putting Together a Reiki Healing Session

As you develop confidence in using intuition, it becomes your most impor-
tant tool in knowing exactly how to format the Reiki session for each person
to cater to their individual needs. Two Reiki techniques rely on intuition: Reiji
Ho and Byosen Reikan Ho (see Chapter 10). For Reiji Ho, you are guided
where to put your hands next. For Byosen Reikan Ho, your hands are guided
to parts of the body that have disease or need Reiki. Both of these techniques
require that you follow your inner knowing or intuition to know where to
place your hands during a Reiki session.
A great way to develop your intuition is to practice giving an intuitive Reiki
session with an open-minded Reiki partner (perhaps one of your classmates
from Reiki training). Don’t move your hands until you get a “message” telling
you where to go next. An intuitive message might come in one of the follow-
ing ways:
 Inner vision: Close your eyes and see whether an image comes to mind.
For example, you might see a picture of a right shoulder.
 Sensations: See whether you feel in your own body a tingling sensation.
If you feel a new sensation (meaning that it’s not your own long-term
knee problem but something that seems to have just arisen), then put
your hands on the recipient’s body in that place.
 Thoughts: You may get a thought such as “put your hands on the 
jawbone.”
 Sound: You may hear or sense the word “breathing,” in which case you
can focus Reiki on the nose and lungs.
If nothing comes to you, just pick the next position out of a hat. Imagine that
you are reaching into a hat with pieces of paper with different body parts
listed. Pick out a piece of paper. What does it say? Go there.
Ask the recipient for feedback: You might say, “I don’t know why, but I got 
the signal to put my hands on your left elbow. And the person might tell you,
“I banged my elbow on the car door this morning!”
The more you’re open to intuition and follow it, the better you’ll become at
using and interpreting your intuition.
When you’re able to trust yourself and follow your intuition, Reiki sessions
may not be what you were expecting, but they’ll help the recipients. They
may even ask you how you knew to put your hands in just the right place. See
Chapter 9 for more information.
206
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Cleaning and Protecting
As a Reiki practitioner, you don’t have to worry about blood or body fluids as
doctors or dentists do. But you are getting close to another person, and
during the releasing that goes along with Reiki, some of the stagnant energy
may be released.
You don’t need to be frightened of stagnant energy, which is also called “neg-
ative energy” or “lower-vibration energy.” Stagnant energy shows up in lots of
places for lots of reasons, such as in a sickroom that hasn’t seen sunlight or
fresh air for a while or a crowded supermarket where you can barely move
through the aisles.
The solution for a Reiki practitioner is to be conscious of protecting yourself,
the Reiki recipient, and the room from “picking up” or keeping any negative
energy. And you want to clear away any stray negative energy that has landed
on you or in the room. Use these techniques to keep everything fresh as a
daisy:
 Aura cleansing to protect the recipient before and after a Reiki session
 Kenyoku Ho to protect you after a Reiki session
 Power symbol protection (see the section “Protecting yourself,” later in
this chapter) and cleansing (see the section “Cleansing the Reiki room,”
later in this chapter) before a Reiki session
Exploring the technique of aura cleansing
Have you ever noticed the freshness of the air after a heavy rain — when the
sun comes out and a rainbow forms in the sky? After a Reiki session, you feel
that sort of freshness. Any energy that is inside of you that is stuck or dense
will wash away. By performing an aura cleansing, you protect against any low
energy coming back. The aura is the energy field surrounding the body. Read
more about the aura in Chapter 2.
Follow these steps to cleanse the aura:
1. With the Reiki recipient lying down in a comfortable position, keep
your hands above the body and sweep your hands from the top of the
head slowly down the body to below the toes.
2. Repeat Step 1 two more times.
207
Chapter 13: Putting Together a Reiki Healing Session

By working on the aura before starting treatment, you remove some of the
resistance to the Reiki. Consider it similar to the prewash cycle at a carwash
or on a washing machine.
After the Reiki session, cleansing the aura helps seal in the balancing that has
just been given and protects the aura from picking up more “debris.” You can
compare this step to applying a wax or other product to a car to protect it
after you wash it.
Using the Kenyoku Ho technique
The Kenyoku Ho, or dry bathing, technique, taught by Mikao Usui, refers to
the process of cleaning yourself without water. Ho means method, and
Kenyoku means dry bathing.
With the intention of cleansing, you take your right hand and clear your left
side and then with your left side you clear the right hand. Follow these steps:
1. Starting with your right hand over your left upper chest near the
shoulder, run your hand across your chest toward your right hip and
fling energy off your hip.
2. Repeat the process with your left hand over your right upper chest
near the shoulder. Run your hand across your chest toward your left
hip and fling energy off your hip.
3. Repeat this process two more times.
Or you may choose this method:
1. Put your right hand over your left upper chest and run your hand up
over your shoulder and down your left arm, flinging the energy off
your fingers.
2. Put your left hand over your right upper chest and run your hand up
over your shoulder and down your right arm, flinging the energy off
your fingers.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 two more times.
Here’s one last method:
208
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

1. Put your right hand on your left inner wrist and fling the energy over
your palm and off your fingertips.
2. Put your left hand on your right inner wrist and fling the energy over
your palm and off your fingertips.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 two more times.
Use any or all these methods to remove energy from yourself after a Reiki
session.
Protecting yourself
The Power symbol Cho Ku Rei (Chapter 8) is cleansing and protective. Use it
before a Reiki session to keep any stray energy from being attracted to you.
Here are two techniques involving the Power symbol that you can use to pro-
tect yourself before performing Reiki.
 Draw the Cho Ku Rei with your fingers or entire hand on each of your
chakras, starting with the first chakra and work your way up to the top
of your head (the seventh chakra). (I discuss chakras in Chapter 2.) As
you draw the Cho Ku Rei, say the name to yourself or out loud three
times.
 Draw a large Cho Ku Rei with your fingers or entire hand over your chest
area, incorporating your throat (fifth chakra) down to your solar plexus
(third chakra). Say the name Cho Ku Rei three times as you draw the
symbol.
You can also set an intention, such as “I am protected as I perform this Reiki
session.” You can use this intention in addition to the Power symbol protec-
tion or on its own if you find yourself in a rush.
Cleansing the Reiki room
Before performing a Reiki session, cleanse the room of any lingering energy
by drawing the Reiki symbol Cho Ku Rei (Power symbol) with your fingers or
entire hand and saying its name three times. Here are two different ways to
use Cho Ku Rei in a room:
209
Chapter 13: Putting Together a Reiki Healing Session

 Put Cho Ku Rei in every corner of the room. If you can’t see or reach
every corner, you can intend that the Cho Ku Rei energy reach each
corner by staring at the corner, tapping your hand towards that corner,
or blowing the energy toward that corner. Remember to get both the top
and bottom corners. This technique takes longer but is good for rooms
with lots of stagnant energy.
 Send Cho Ku Rei to the ceiling, floor, and all four walls. This quicker
method is good to use before a Reiki session in a room that is otherwise
kept energetically clean.
You can also set the intention: “This room is cleansed, purified, and ready for
Reiki healing today.” You can do this in addition to using the power symbol or
by itself if you’re really in a rush.

Chapter 14
Experiencing Reiki in a Group
In This Chapter
 Discovering group Reiki events
 Feeling the power of group Reiki
 Considering a Reiki retreat
 Introducing Reiki to the public
You can experience Reiki in ways other than a one-on-one session or 
in a class setting. Reiki practitioners and teachers organize different
group events to spread the word about Reiki to the public, share Reiki with
others, and provide a continuing education and support system for Reiki
practitioners.
A Reiki event such as a Reiki circle or share is a great way to meet up with
other people interested in Reiki. You can discover more about Reiki firsthand,
find a Reiki teacher, exchange Reiki sessions with others, and share Reiki with
your local community.
In this chapter, I explain the different types of Reiki events and list the rea-
sons they might interest you. I also describe how being with a group
enhances the effects of Reiki. This chapter also addresses how both someone
who has never experienced Reiki and someone who has recently trained in
Reiki may benefit from attending a Reiki event.
Participating in Reiki Events
Reiki events are generally targeted to one of the following:
 The general public: This group includes anyone who is interested in
Reiki.
 Reiki professionals: This group consists of those who have had some
level of Reiki training.

If you’re not sure whom the event is for, ask the organizer. Note also that
many events are open to both the general public and Reiki professionals.
To define what type of Reiki events to look for, I provide a variety of terms for
different Reiki events:
 Reiki circle means a group of people coming together to experience the
healing power of Reiki. The word “circle” implies that at some point, the
group sits or stands in a circle. In general, Reiki circles are open to the
general public. Reiki circles are sometimes called healing circles or Reiki
healing circles.
 Reiki share or Reiki exchange refers to the sharing of Reiki healing
among practitioners. The terms Reiki circle and Reiki share are 
sometimes used interchangeably, so check with the organizers to be
sure. A Reiki exchange implies that both people in the exchange are
practitioners.
 Reiki talks or workshops are generally for Reiki practitioners of all or
some level (see Chapter 7) and provide continuing education on sub-
jects such as crystals or additional techniques.
 Reiki retreats are group events in which a group of Reiki practitioners
get together to have a retreat. Reiki talks and group Reiki are usually
part of the program.
 Reiki clinic is usually in the setting of a healthcare or healing facility
and focuses on bringing Reiki to the general public, usually in the form
of one-on-one healing.
Finding Reiki events
To find out about local Reiki events, check your local newspapers or commu-
nity bulletin boards (such as those at libraries and healthcare centers) or ask
alternative health practitioners. Two general types of groups sponsor Reiki
events:
 Local Reiki groups or organizations: A sponsor may be one lone Reiki
practitioner in your town or a city- or state-wide organization of Reiki
practitioners from different branches. Many Reiki events are somewhere
in between and are organized by a handful of practitioners who live in a
given town.
 Reiki branches: A particular Reiki branch may sponsor an event.
Usually, people from all Reiki branches are welcomed at such events.
212
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

The cost of Reiki events varies. Some local Reiki events are free of charge or
accept donations. Generally, Reiki talks, shares, and circles are priced reason-
ably so that many people can attend.
Larger-scale events that attract people farther afield are usually advertised in
Reiki-specific resources like magazines, Web sites, newsletters, or e-mail lists
(see the Appendix for more information on resources).
After you begin training in Reiki, join a local or regional Reiki organization.
One of the many benefits is notification about Reiki events. Check out 
the Appendix and ask your Reiki teacher to find out about organizations 
near you.
What to expect
Each Reiki event is unique, but it usually includes one of more of the follow-
ing activities:
 Talks or presentations: The topic might be Reiki in general for the gen-
eral public or a specific topic of interest to Reiki professionals.
 Meditation, passing energy, and distance healing: See the sections
“Meditating in a Reiki group,” “Passing energy around in a circle,” and
“Sending distant Reiki as a group,” later in this chapter. Reiki circles,
shares, exchanges, and retreats usually include these Reiki spiritual
practices.
 Reiki healing sessions: Reiki tables are usually provided, and you
receive treatment from one or more Reiki practitioners. See the sidebar
“Experiencing group Reiki” and the later section “Harnessing the Power
of Group Reiki.” All Reiki events except Reiki talks include some form of
Reiki healing sessions.
Reaping the benefits
In addition to giving or receiving Reiki, Reiki events offer other benefits. For
example, you get the opportunity to do the following:
 Meet other people in the Reiki community
 Learn new things about Reiki
213
Chapter 14: Experiencing Reiki in a Group

 Make new friends
 Find a Reiki practitioner or teacher
 Obtain Reiki clients for your business (if you’re a practitioner)
Anyone who has trained from 1st-degree Reiki onward (see Chapter 7 
for a discussion of Reiki training) can participate in an exchange of informa-
tion and healing with other Reiki professionals or help bring Reiki to the 
community.
In terms of offering Reiki to the public, some circles allow anyone to partici-
pate in group Reiki, and others require that you have finished 2nd-degree
Reiki training. Each group has its own guidelines for who can perform Reiki.
In some cases, photocopies of your training certificate (see Chapter 7) are
required if the group doesn’t know you.
Allow yourself to receive Reiki. Even if you feel you want to give Reiki to
others, remember that you deserve to receive Reiki too.
Harnessing the Power of Group Reiki
When Reiki practitioners and interested members of the public experience
Reiki together, the intentions for healing and spiritual connection cause the
energy levels to soar, providing a boost to everyone present.
Giving group Reiki sessions
Imagine the energy you feel when one person performs Reiki. Now multiply
that by many people performing Reiki. You get the idea. When more than one
practitioner lays hands on a recipient, that is group Reiki. The Japanese term
for group Reiki is Shu Chu Reiki.
When groups of Reiki practitioners get together, energy levels are high, and
the experience can be joyful and fun. Performing Reiki with other practition-
ers is a great way for new Reiki practitioners to gain confidence and experi-
ence. You can also learn new tricks by watching how other practitioners
carry out a session.
The usual Reiki session involves one practitioner treating one recipient.
When you have multiple practitioners and multiple recipients, there are many
possible configurations for giving Reiki:
214
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

 Multiple Reiki tables with one person giving the Reiki to each recipient
 Two or more Reiki tables, but with two or more people giving the Reiki
to each recipient
 One Reiki table with all practitioners giving Reiki to one recipient at a
time
Group Reiki is the same as any other Reiki session. Before performing Reiki,
make sure to prepare the room for Reiki and set your intention for the session
(see Chapters 9 and 13).
The layout of hands for group Reiki depends on the number of practitioners
performing Reiki. See Figure 14-1 for an example of the layout of hands during
group Reiki.
Here are some ideas for group Reiki:
 One person may act as the leader and work on the head areas. This
person is usually the one to indicate when the Reiki session has ended
(unless you are using a set amount of time, such as 15 minutes).
 One person can work on the left side of the recipient, and another
person works on the right side, mirroring the same positions. For exam-
ple, each person can hold the shoulder and hand of the opposite side of
the body.
 When many people are performing Reiki on one person, finding a place
to put your hands can be difficult! If that is the case, you can beam Reiki
to the recipient and move yourself a little farther away from the crowded
table. Another option is to give Reiki to some of the practitioners who
are performing Reiki on the recipient.
215
Chapter 14: Experiencing Reiki in a Group
Experiencing group Reiki
People often come away from group Reiki very
pleased with the experience.
For example, Joe of Southern California reports
that he felt incredibly relaxed and soothed at his
first Reiki session. He found a Reiki circle and
experienced a few people placing their hands
on his body. He immediately drifted off in a
dreamlike state. He had a vision of his grandfa-
ther’s home, with a green lawn and flowering
plants. This image brought him a sense of com-
fort and peace. Having come to the Reiki circle
an open-minded skeptic, he left more convinced
of the value of Reiki.
Karl was planning on having heart surgery in a
few days. He attended a Reiki circle and invited
all of his Reiki friends. It was standing room only
as every person attending put his or her hands
on Karl’s body. What an energetic send-off
before surgery! Karl felt relaxed and peace-
ful and knew that he had done all he could 
to prepare for the operation. His surgery was
successful.

Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Meditating in a Reiki group
Most group Reiki circles start with a brief (or not so brief) meditation, which
is always a powerful experience. In most cases, it is a guided meditation,
which means that one of the group members leads by talking everyone
through the meditation. You close your eyes, get comfortable in your chair or
seat on the floor, and take a few deep breaths. The meditation helps get folks
centered and spiritually connected before beginning the Reiki.
Passing energy around in a circle
Here’s the circle part of Reiki circle. You don’t need to be a Reiki practitioner
to pass or run energy. All you have to do is visualize energy or white light
passing through you. The group leader guides you through this technique.
Here’s a summary of the technique for passing energy in a Reiki circle 
(in which everyone is either standing or sitting):
1. Hold hands with the person on your left and right.
Your left hand is on the bottom facing upward and your right hand is on
the top facing downward.
2. Sense the energy coming from the person on your left into your left
hand and through you out of your right hand to the person on your
right.
3. Imagine the energy passing around the circle in a counterclockwise
position.
You might sense a pulse of energy going around the circle.
Sometimes the leader will tell you to switch hand positions and send the
energy in the opposite direction.
Variations of this technique are used in both Western and Japanese Reiki.
Reiki Mawashi is the name of the technique in Japanese, which means “to
pass on spiritual energy.”
Sending distant Reiki as a group
Another part of a Reiki circle or Reiki share is praying or sending Reiki to
others who are not present. (I describe this form of Reiki, known as distant
Reiki, in Chapter 15.) Each group has its own preferences, but generally, all
217
Chapter 14: Experiencing Reiki in a Group

the people at the meeting can say the names of people to whom they want to
send Reiki. Another method is to write down the name of a person to send
Reiki to and put it in a box or in another designated area. Then the group as a
whole sends distant Reiki to all the people mentioned.
Reiki circles can send distant Reiki to the earth, political leaders, or troubled
areas or situations.
Receiving a group Reiki session
A highlight of Reiki circles and shares is the giving of Reiki to people who
want it. Generally, the Reiki session is shorter at a Reiki circle than at a pri-
vate session (which I describe in Chapter 13). Because the energy is more
intense when you have more than one practitioner working on a person, the
session can be completed more quickly.
Group Reiki is an incredibly powerful experience, and I recommend that you
give it a try! The energy sensations can feel much stronger than during a
normal Reiki session. You probably won’t know which practitioner has what
hands where because people change position. But you’ll feel so wonderful
that you won’t care anyway!
Group Reiki can be a great way to get a surge of Reiki energy to remove stuck
energy or start the healing process for long-standing illnesses.
By attending the same group regularly, you get to know the practitioners and
get a level of trust that will allow you to feel secure enough to release deep-
seated emotional blocks.
Going on a Reiki Retreat
A retreat is a time away from your normal activities when you can get quiet
and work on your spiritual connection. Reiki fits in perfectly with a retreat sit-
uation. Retreats can be as short as a day or a weekend.
Different Reiki branches or regional Reiki societies organize retreats yearly or
more often. You can get all the benefits of a Reiki circle: meeting new people,
learning new techniques, and finding time for your spiritual growth. The
218
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

retreat is like a longer version of a Reiki circle, with quiet time added in.
Check with the individual organizers to see if you need to have Reiki training
to attend the organized retreat and, if so, which level of training is required.
Another possibility is to attend a retreat organized by your spiritual or reli-
gious group and use Reiki in addition to the meditation and quiet times that
are included in the retreat.
To find out about retreat schedules, I suggest that you ask your network of
Reiki pals (Reiki teachers, practitioners, and friends) and check Reiki maga-
zines and organizations (listed in the Appendix). For retreats that are not spe-
cific to Reiki, you have a wide choice. Start by considering a particular
spiritual practice, such as Buddhist or Christian retreats, which are most
commonly found. Or consider a retreat at a particular location. You’ll find
books and magazines devoted to these topics at your bookstore and library.
You might even find a retreat center in your locale by looking in the phone
book.
If you can’t make it to an organized Reiki retreat, make your own by schedul-
ing a quiet time to focus on Reiki. You can schedule quiet time at home or
away and spend time meditating, giving yourself Reiki (see Chapter 11), read-
ing spiritual books, and being in nature.
The origins of Reiki retreat go back to Mikao Usui, who took a 21-day retreat
of meditation and fasting that led to his enlightenment; this spiritual retreat
was documented on his memorial stone (see Chapter 3).
Taking Reiki to the Community
A group of Reiki practitioners can organize events at places within the com-
munity, which is a great way to introduce people to Reiki. After you have
commitments from enough practitioners and found enough portable Reiki
tables and a place to hold the circle, you’re ready to go! You may find that
even people who have never even heard of Reiki before you advertised your
circle will be interested enough to attend.
Here are some different categories of organizations and events that may offer
Reiki healing circles or that may let you present a Reiki talk or healing event:
219
Chapter 14: Experiencing Reiki in a Group

 Health-related: Hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, health fairs, and
health food stores
 Religious or spiritual: Places of worship or spiritual meetings
 Metaphysical: Metaphysical bookstores and New Age fairs
 Animal-related: Animal shows and meets, farming events, holistic pet
stores, veterinary offices
 Community: Libraries, schools, and universities
If you want to bring Reiki to lots of different types of people, I suggest you
join an existing Reiki circle (See “Finding Reiki events”) or start your own.

R
eiki just flows when you place your hands on yourself or on someone
else. But what if the person you want to heal is on the other side of the
earth? A valuable Reiki technique called distant Reiki allows you to channel
the Reiki energy and send it to anyone, anywhere.
Call it distant Reiki, long-distance Reiki, healing in absentia, or nonlocal or
remote healing, this powerful technique lets you send Reiki anywhere in the
world. Distant Reiki techniques are taught in 2nd-degree Reiki training and
use the Reiki symbols. In fact, the third Reiki symbol is called the Distance
symbol or the Connection symbol because it allows Reiki energy to cross any
boundaries of space and time.
In this chapter, I describe different methods you can use to send distant
Reiki. After you use distant Reiki to heal at a distance, you may want to 
try other creative uses of Reiki healing, including the following:
 Going forward and backward in time
 Healing specific situations
 Healing specific places
As you can see, Reiki can heal many situations. I particularly enjoy using
most of the techniques described in this chapter because of the breadth 
they add to my Reiki practice. It’s like Reiki is at my fingertips always, 
available to help wherever and whenever it’s needed.

Like a Prayer: Understanding 
How Reiki Can Be Sent
Most people understand the concept of sending a prayer long distance. You
can pray for someone in the same room or far away. Like prayer, Reiki can be
sent in any situation. Also like prayer, Reiki can transcend space and time.
After you study 2nd-degree Reiki, you learn how to perform distant Reiki (see
Chapter 7 for more about Reiki training). Follow all the guidelines for distant
Reiki as you would for regular Reiki sessions, including the following:
 Use your integrity to make sure the Reiki is being sent in good faith
(preferable to have permission).
 Use your intention for the Reiki energy to be transmitted to a particular
person, place, time, or situation. Intend for the highest level of good for
the recipient and for protection for you and the recipient.
 Use your intuition to know how to structure the long-distance Reiki 
session.
For a powerful group experience sending distant Reiki, check out a Reiki
circle or share, which sends distant Reiki to individuals and situations by
placing them figuratively in the middle of the circle. See Chapter 14 for 
information about Reiki circles and Reiki in the community.
Sending Reiki to people who are far away
The basic and most common use of the distant Reiki technique (see the sec-
tion “Performing the Distant Reiki Session,” later in this chapter) is to send
Reiki long distance. The recipient may be in the hospital or in another coun-
try. The distance doesn’t matter because Reiki can transcend any distance.
When you send distant Reiki, you can also set the time it is received. For exam-
ple, you can send Reiki to an overseas relative at 8 p.m. your time and intend
for the Reiki to be received at 9 a.m. her time. In this way, you combine the fea-
tures of crossing both time and space during the distant Reiki session.
Sending Reiki to the future
Going into the future lets you send Reiki ahead to important events such as
exams, competitions, job interviews, or dental appointments. Because you
may not be available at a particular time to send Reiki to someone (or even
222
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

yourself), this technique comes in handy as a way to preset the Reiki to flow.
When you send the Reiki, you can state the time and place and person who is
to receive the Reiki and the situation if you know that information.
For example, if you want to send Reiki to someone who is about to have
surgery and you know the time and place of surgery, state something like
this: “This Reiki healing is intended for Melinda Jones that she may receive
the highest level of healing and care during her heart operation at 10 a.m.
Monday at Francis Hospital. May she respond well to the surgery and heal
quickly and fully.”
Some people like to send the Reiki to the patient before and after the surgery
and to the surgeon for the time of surgery. I suggest you follow the sugges-
tions that your teacher gives you and use your intuition to find the best pro-
cedure for any situation.
Sending Reiki to the past
The ability to send healing backward in time allows you to help heal previous
experiences. No, unfortunately this doesn’t mean you can alter history, but
you can heal what results from it.
Because people tend to hold onto past experiences, both good and bad, much
of the healing done in the present time or now is actually healing the leftovers
from the past. For example, suppose that you have been suffering for years
from neck pain from a past car accident. You can return to the scene of the
accident — in your imagination — and send Reiki to yourself and anyone else
involved. Doing so requires good use of imagination and visualization.
Set your clear intention for the specific past experience or time period you
want to focus on for the Reiki session.
Sending Reiki to different 
places and situations
Out of necessity or a desire to heal, practitioners have found creative ways to
use Reiki. For example, Reiki is an excellent way for people to send immedi-
ate healing energy to any situation, near or far.
Note that you should apply all techniques of intention, integrity, and protec-
tion as described in this chapter when sending Reiki to a place or situation.
223
Chapter 15: Sending Reiki Where Needed

Helping to heal the earth with distant Reiki
Just like the crystals discussed in Chapter 12, the earth itself is receptive to
healing with Reiki. Natural disasters that harm the earth include fires, volca-
noes, and tidal waves. The earth is also affected by the actions of humans,
including pollution and destruction of rain forests. The earth includes the
rocks and minerals, soil and sand, plants and trees, and animals of all types.
For all to coexist peacefully, a balance exists which mirrors our own individ-
ual energy systems.
The earth provides every need we have for sustenance. If you feel the call,
send Reiki energy to the earth. You can send Reiki to the earth in a general
way, and the energy can be taken where needed. Or you can send Reiki to
specific places on earth, such as a continent, ocean, forest, or wherever you
are drawn to send the energy.
Helping to heal conflicts on earth
You can use Reiki to heal anything, including inanimate objects (see more
about this in Chapter 18) or even situations, such as the following:
 Traffic accidents: When you hear of an accident or pass an accident on
the road, you can send Reiki to all the people involved.
 Wars: With an intention of resolution and peace, you can send Reiki to
the victims of war, who are many.
 Political situations: During contentious elections, you can send Reiki so
that the differences among political parties of different ideologies are
healed soon after the election.
 Natural disasters: When a tsunami, earthquake, or tornado strikes com-
munities or countries, you can send Reiki to those situations immedi-
ately upon hearing the news.
The techniques to send Reiki to any of these situations are the same as any
distant Reiki session. You may wonder what the ethics are when sending
Reiki to a situation. Because getting permission from all parties in a war or
natural disaster is impossible, you can intend that Reiki go to all who want it.
You’re not sending Reiki to any particular individual but making this healing
energy available to those who need it.
I’ve heard it said that the news, which can be pretty horrible at times, pro-
vides a template of people and situations that need prayer or healing. If you
want to practice sending distant Reiki and don’t know where to start, just
open the newspaper.
224
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Getting Permission to Send Distant Reiki
When you work on someone in person, you have implied permission to do
Reiki or else the person wouldn’t be there! Distant Reiki presents a challenge
of making sure the recipient wants to receive the Reiki you want to offer.
This Reiki technique touches on important ethical issues of healing and
boundaries between the healer and person being healed, which I discuss 
further in Chapter 13. The keyword is integrity, which should be maintained
in distant Reiki just as it is with face-to-face Reiki.
The decision of whether to heal and how to receive such healing lies entirely
with the individual. Don’t force your intention to channel healing on someone
else. If your offer of Reiki is refused by one person, you can always find some-
one who does want to receive the Reiki healing energy.
225
Chapter 15: Sending Reiki Where Needed
Reiki on a larger scale
The Reiki community comes together and uses
Reiki during times of personal, national, and inter-
national need. In most of this chapter, I describe
individual situations. But Reiki is also valuable
when a larger-scale need for healing exists.
Reiki and September 11, 2001
On the morning of September 11, 2001, when I
heard about the unfolding events, including the
destruction of the Twin Towers (which I had
seen go up during my childhood) in New York, I
felt drawn to send Reiki. Months later when I
visited the actual site of destruction in lower
Manhattan, I sent Reiki to the site. When I flew
over the area and could see where the towers
used to stand, I sent Reiki from the airplane. I
was able to “sense” the towers perhaps as an
amputee still feels a lost limb.
I know that many Reiki practitioners and Reiki
circles around the globe sent energy around
this terrorist attack.
Reiki and the December 2004 tsunami
I sent Reiki as soon as I heard of the tsunami in
Southeast Asia, and looking at the images on
television, I sent Reiki energy to those locations.
I took a globe (I had a children’s beach ball of
the earth) and held my hand over the parts of
the world affected. I also printed out a map of
the region and beamed Reiki that way.
William Rand of the International Center for
Reiki Training (see the appendix for more infor-
mation) sent out an e-mail to his e-mail newslet-
ter subscribers requesting that they send Reiki
to the region.
At every Reiki circle I attended, energy was sent
to the victims of the devastating tsunami.
Reiki and 2005
London terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina,
2005
As this book goes to print, Reiki practitioners
around the world are sending Reiki healing to all
those affected by these devastating events.

Receiving consent from the recipient
Generally, you should give Reiki long distance only after you receive a clear
request from the person who will receive the Reiki. This request can be in 
the form of a written or verbal request, such as “You can send Reiki to me
anytime” or “Please send me Reiki so my knee heals from this surgery.”
The request for Reiki is like a green light, giving you the okay to send Reiki 
to this person, following the manner of the person’s instructions. If the call
for Reiki is for a specific situation, you must inquire before sending Reiki for
another situation. A general call for Reiki at anytime is a permanent green
light — unless you later hear otherwise from the person.
Sometimes you’ll receive a request for Reiki on another’s behalf. If you aren’t
sure of the person’s consent, you can take one of the following courses of
action:
 Choose not to send Reiki. This is the easiest and clearest course of
action to take. You have a firm resolve that you send Reiki only when
directly requested.
 Connect with the person and get an intuitive consent. Meditate and get
a picture in your mind of the person whom you want to connect with.
You are connecting with the purpose of finding out by way of your intu-
ition if the person is open to receiving Reiki from you. You might get an
image of the person or sense an energy. Ask the question in your mind:
“Do you want to receive long-distance Reiki from me?” If you get a clear
yes or no, then proceed accordingly.
I generally don’t send Reiki to individuals who don’t request it. But if I
get a request on another person’s behalf (“please help my father, son, or
sister”), I use the intuitive approach to see if I can proceed. In one case, 
I connected with a friend’s sister and heard: “I can do it on my own; I 
can take of myself. I don’t need your help, thank you very much.” When 
I told my friend this, she told me it sounded very much like her sister. I
did not send Reiki in this instance.
You might get a response such as “Okay, whatever” from a teenage boy
or “Please, anything to help” from an elderly person in pain. In these
cases, send Reiki to the person.
 Send Reiki with a specific intent that it flows only where it is desired.
You can send Reiki without explicit approval, but first make clear in your
mind that, if the person in question doesn’t want Reiki, the energy will
go to the earth or to some other person who wants it. You might say, “I
am sending this energy to John, but if he doesn’t want or need it, let it go
to someone who does need it.”
226
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

You may have strong feelings one way or another about getting permission to
send Reiki. Follow what feels right for you.
All over the world, people pray for one another without necessarily asking if
the recipient wants that prayer. Some practitioners use this logic to send
Reiki without getting permission. But most agree that the path of most
integrity requires getting permission.
Sharing what you learn with the recipient
Using long-distance healing requires you to connect with another person (or
situation) and helps build your intuitive skills because intuition is your only
sense of what is happening. I discuss intuition and Reiki in Chapter 9.
While performing distant Reiki, you’re using your intuitive senses and may
therefore receive intuitive information about the recipient. If you feel that the
recipient would value and want this information, by all means tell the person.
As discussed in Chapter 13, use discretion, respect, and confidentiality with
all information received during a Reiki session.
Getting Prepared for Distant Reiki
After you get the hang of sending distant Reiki, you’ll be able to send the
energy in a variety of environments. But to get started, find a quiet place and
time where you won’t be interrupted. You need to focus on the following:
 Grounding yourself and connecting with spirit: Just like an in-person
Reiki session, you need to make that spiritual connection so that you are
in the best position to channel Reiki. Read Chapter 9 for tips on prepar-
ing to channel Reiki.
 Channeling the Reiki energy: You are not sending your own energy, but
channeling Reiki energy. Make sure you feel the flow of Reiki before con-
necting with the recipient.
 Connecting with the recipient: After your channels are open and you’re
transmitting the Reiki energy, picture the recipient (See the section
“Using visuals for the distant session,” later in this chapter) and send
the Reiki energy.
 Keeping energy clean between yourself and the recipient: Make sure
to use any techniques you would normally use in a face-to-face Reiki ses-
sion. In particular, remember to disconnect from the session and wash
your hands or use the other techniques described in Chapter 13. Setting
intention is also important for protection of energy. The point is to keep
your energy to yourself and other people’s energy to themselves.
227
Chapter 15: Sending Reiki Where Needed

Performing the Distant Reiki Session
When you study 2nd-degree Reiki (see Chapter 7), your teacher will provide
you with techniques to use. The first few times you perform distant Reiki, it’s
best to follow the same procedure as an in-person Reiki session and your
teacher’s instructions or the technique outlined in the section “The distant
Reiki technique,” later in this chapter. But as you grow in confidence, you can
use intuition to guide you more and more.
Using visuals for the distant session
Because you don’t have the recipient in front of you, you need to find a way
to “see” what is going on during the session. You can choose from different
things to help you visualize or represent the distant Reiki recipient in your
mind.
You can use a substitute prop to represent the recipient:
 A teddy bear: Use the teddy bear as a replacement for the individual
and hold the teddy bear and give it Reiki.
 Your knee: The top of your knee can represent the person’s head, and
you can move your hands around your leg to give Reiki to different parts
of their body.
You can picture the recipient by using one of the following:
 A photograph: You can stare at the photo, or you can hold the image
between your hands and send it Reiki.
On the back of the photograph, write the person’s name, date of birth,
profession, or any other information that you can get to help you focus
on the person during the healing.
 Your imagination: Visualize the person in your mind. You may see the
person as a vague mass of energy (like the aura described in Chapter 2)
or have a clear picture of the person’s body lying on a Reiki table.
I have used all these techniques. I find a teddy bear to be too small for my
hands and generally use the imagination technique. But I am known to have 
a very vivid imagination! Try these techniques out for yourself and see what
works for you.
In distant Reiki, your intuition or imagination is particularly valuable because
you won’t be receiving information directly at that time. You can’t see with
your eyes whether the person is sighing, crying, smiling, or coughing.
228
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

The distant Reiki technique
Here is the basic method I was taught to perform distant Reiki.
1. First obtain permission (see the section “Getting Permission to Send
Distant Reiki,” earlier in this chapter)
2. Visualize and say the names of the following symbols aloud three
times each:
• Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen (Distance symbol)
• Sei Hei Ki (Emotional symbol)
• Cho Ku Rei (Power symbol)
3. Say the name of the receiving person three times.
4. Picture the recipient in your mind.
5. Repeat Step 2.
6. Begin the Reiki session exactly as you would in person.
See “Using visuals for the distant session” to determine which method
you will use during this distant Reiki session. In your mind’s eye, visual-
ize what you’re doing.
7. Cleanse the aura (see Chapter 13).
8. Use the standard Reiki hand positions (see Chapter 10).
For a full session, start at position 1 and end at position 19.
9. End the session with an aura clearing (Chapter 13).
10. Cleanse yourself with dry bathing (Kenyoku Ho) as described in
Chapter 13.
Because different teachers provide different variations on Reiki techniques,
you may encounter advice for this method that’s different from what’s shown
here.
Mikao Usui used distant healing methods, which he called Enkaku Chiryo Ho.
(Enkaku translates to “remote or sending,” Chiryo to “treatment,” and Ho to
“method.”) This method uses the visualizing technique of photographs, if
available, to send Reiki to people at a distance, even if the distance is just
another room in the same building.
Creating the session structure
Just as you develop your own style of performing Reiki for a regular Reiki 
session (see Chapter 13), you can also develop your own style of performing
229

distant Reiki. You can use any of the techniques outlined in Chapter 10 or 13
during a distant Reiki session. In place of the full session I describe in the 
section “The distant Reiki technique,” earlier in this chapter, you can do the
following:
 Use a brief spot treatment of places that need attention.
 Work with the aura or other sense of energy you have of the person. You
may feel that one part of the person’s aura or a particular chakra (see
Chapter 2) is out of whack or needs smoothing and you can send Reiki
to that area.
As for an in-person session, continue to send Reiki until you sense that what
is needed at this time has been achieved. So if you sense that the recipient’s
energy is askew near the hip area (the second chakra), continue sending
Reiki in your mind until you feel that the skew has been healed. You may
sense that the area of the body is pulsing with energy as if it’s now plumped
up with Reiki energy, or you may sigh yourself, which signals that a shift has
occurred.
For your first few distant Reiki sessions, use your friends and family and elicit
their feedback. Their response to your distance treatment can help you with
future distant Reiki sessions.
Using Distant Reiki to Heal Yourself
You can use distant Reiki for yourself in the following ways:
 Sending to yourself in the present time: While sitting in meditation, you
can imagine yourself and send Reiki to yourself.
 Going to the past: As you recall or feel stuck by prior events in your life,
make the decision to send Reiki to these situations. When you heal your
past wounds, you get the benefit now.
 Going to the future: Try sending Reiki to your future self. Go one month
or even years into the future. You can think of a certain event of the
future such as a vacation, retirement, wedding or just send to the future
with no event or time frame in mind.
You may receive a message when you send Reiki to yourself. When I send Reiki
to a future self, I usually receive a positive message. It’s as if my future self is
more evolved and more loving than I am now and “she” wants to help me!
You can use any technique on yourself. In fact, it’s best to put yourself first in
order to learn and practice any technique but also so that you gain the bene-
fit of Reiki healing.

Sending Reiki to Many at Once
Many Reiki practitioners use distant Reiki regularly and have multiple
requests for healing. Different techniques allow you to send healing regularly
to more than one person:
 Reiki box: Write down the names of the people or situations you are
sending healing to and put the paper with the names into a box. Reiki
the box regularly and you send Reiki to all requests inside the box! Note
that you can use a beautiful ceramic bowl or any other object as long as
it’s intended for Reiki.
 Crystal grid: You charge the crystals with Reiki energy and place them
in a set pattern and with a specific intention. Crystals are used to
enhance the energy sent at a distance. (You can read more about crys-
tals in Chapter 12.)
 Boards with photos and names of people to be healed: Use a bulletin
board or any other type of surface where you can attach the names or
photos of people requesting Reiki. You can beam the energy to the
requests on the board. Read about Reiki beaming in Chapter 13.
231
Chapter 15: Sending Reiki Where Needed
Using Reiki to connect from a distance
I had a friend from the southwest United States
who regularly sent e-mails to a group of people.
I occasionally sent e-mail to him too. One day,
my e-mail was bounced, so I tried it again, but it
still didn’t go through.
I became concerned, because I knew that
“George” had a heart condition. I did an Internet
search for his name and found an article of some-
one with the same name receiving an artificial
heart. Was this my friend George? I found a pic-
ture of a man in bed with all sorts of apparatus,
downloaded this picture onto my computer, and
sent distant Reiki. Whether or not it was my
friend, this person could use Reiki, I sensed. Over
many months, I never deleted that picture from
my computer, and I occasionally tried out the
e-mail address, but it was always returned.
One day as I was writing this book, I got an e-mail
from George! Yes, the man in the picture was
him, and yes, he did have an artificial heart and
then a heart transplant but is recovering now. I
was delighted to hear of this miracle! I feel that
Reiki helped me feel connected to him, even
when I was distant and wasn’t exactly sure what
was going on. Did Reiki help him? It surely made
a contribution, no matter how small, that, along
with the medical help he received and prayers
from others, gave him more time on Earth. We
truly are all connected. We just forget it much of
the time. Distant Reiki is a way to sense the con-
nection among all people.

R
eiki is a gentle spiritual energy that heals. It provides relaxation, stress
release, and a soothing touch. Reiki energy brings about the highest
good and can be used to enhance the effects of any other treatment. In this
chapter, I describe how to use Reiki as a powerful tool in your healthcare
toolbox to complement any other healing practices.
Discovering How Reiki Heals
Reiki supports your innate healing abilities. Your body has a marvelous abil-
ity to heal and protect itself from harm. Sometimes, though, this inner healing
ability just doesn’t work and what results is pain or illness, or to put it
another way, dis-ease.
Seeing Reiki as energy medicine
From the perspective of energy medicine, any dis-ease is caused by an imbal-
ance in your body’s energy. The energy imbalance, which could be caused by
an energy block or stagnation of energy, ultimately manifests physically or
emotionally as pain or disease.

Conventional medicine treats symptoms and sometimes the biological cause
of the problem. Energy medicine treats the underlying pattern of energy that
makes you susceptible to disease. Reiki restores your body to harmony so it
can self-heal and restore itself to health.
Reiki is a high-level intelligent energy that has the ability to balance the subtle
energies of your body at every level: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual
(see Chapter 2). No matter where your disease has occurred in terms of an
energy imbalance or where the disease has manifested, Reiki gets to the root
of the problem, which ultimately solves the problem.
The practitioner’s role is to help the Reiki energy. The recipient is always in
charge (even at a subconscious level) because Reiki only flows to the place
where it is needed. The intrinsic wisdom of the body “knows” to pull in Reiki
energy. The observant Reiki practitioner will feel the pull of the recipient’s
energy by sensing “I have to put my hands over there.”
Supporting the healing process with Reiki
So what does the harmony that Reiki provides do for the person who is expe-
riencing disease? Reports from individual Reiki recipients indicate that they
experience the following after one or a series of Reiki sessions:
 Relief of muscle tension, pain, anxiety, and stress
 Quicker healing from tissue damage from surgery or radiation
 Fewer side effects from medications such as chemotherapy
 Positive attitude and feeling more energetic
 Better ability to focus and concentrate
Deciding on how many Reiki sessions to have depends on your individual
needs (see Chapter 5). While you get some benefit after just one Reiki treat-
ment, longer-term illnesses probably require longer-term treatment.
I now describe two ways that Reiki helps, which could provide support for all
types of illnesses; reducing stress and removing energy blocks.
Using Reiki to reduce stress
The application of Reiki reduces the effects of stress, which is a major factor
in many illnesses. Reiki can lessen tensions, relieve sleep problems, improve
breathing, and make it easier to smile. When relaxed, the body has a better
chance to perform its own healing miracles.
A friend from London with chronic health issues said, “I use Reiki on myself —
it’s been one of the only things that has helped me over the last few years —
to relax and to reestablish sleep patterns.”
234
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Releasing energy blocks
Reiki heals at a deep level by removing energy blocks. As old stuck energy is
released, channels within the body open up. This release of stuck energy may
bring about crying, coughing, sighing, or other physical manifestations. After
releasing stuck energy, Reiki recipients report the following effects:
 A weight has been lifted.
 Dreams are more vivid or yield interesting information.
 Insights to difficult issues or problems may occur.
Each person receives the amount of Reiki healing that is best for the person
at the time.
In the days of Mikao Usui and Chujiro Hayashi (see Chapter 3), people attended
daily Reiki clinics for months at a time to receive treatments. Today, most
people receive Reiki less often and use Reiki as an adjunct to other types of
healthcare.
The conventional medical system aims to provide life-saving interventions 
in the forms of medicines, surgeries, and other treatments. When you have 
a heart condition, cancer, manic depression, or other serious condition, it
would be foolhardy or even life threatening to shun or postpone these treat-
ments in the face of a serious illness.
Reiki is not a substitute for medical or psychological attention. If you have a
serious condition, you must pursue life-saving medical or psychological inter-
vention first, and then consider adding Reiki treatments. If you postpone nec-
essary medical treatment, you risk your disease getting worse.
Now that I’ve told you all that Reiki can do for you, I must also tell you what
you should not rely on Reiki to do:
 Diagnose: Although a Reiki practitioner may get some insights into a
recipient’s problems, this doesn’t qualify the practitioner to make a diag-
nosis. To find out about an illness, visit a medical practitioner who can
run a battery of tests to provide clinical information.
 Cure: Reiki doesn’t promise to cure a disease, but it will certainly help
you achieve a feeling of peace and serenity. In conjunction with other
medical treatment (see the section “Adding Reiki to the healing tool-
box,” later in this chapter), healing can be achieved, which in some
cases means a cure.
Healing doesn’t necessarily mean a cure. In some situations, healing means
simply to be at peace, whether that is during the recuperative process or
even the dying process. The Reiki practitioner can only assure the availability
of healing energy; he can’t control the outcome of healing.
235
Chapter 16: Combining Reiki with Other Health Practices

Integrating Reiki into Medical Care
The fact that Reiki is becoming more accepted in hospitals and other health-
care settings is exciting. Reiki has so much to offer as part of a healthcare
package. In this section I describe how Reiki fits in with conventional medical
care as well as alternative medical care. Actually, all medical care of every
type is now being called integrative medicine, which puts it all together in a
healthy package.
Adding Reiki to the healing toolbox
Maintaining good health is a full-time job. Many tools, including Reiki, con-
tribute to well-being. Health requires self-care and a balancing act of the 
following:
 Rest and sleep
 Food and drink
 Movement and play
236
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 
Steps for the healing journey
You might use Reiki as a one-time stress release
or engage the use of a Reiki practitioner (see
Chapter 5) as a long-term partner in healing a
health issue. To get the most from Reiki in your
efforts to heal, try the following:
 Determine your health goals. What are you
trying to achieve with this treatment? To get
over back pain? To recover from surgery? To
be able to run again? When you have specific
goals, you know what you’re working toward.
 Pay attention. When you try Reiki or any
other treatment, see how it makes you feel
and note whether it is helping. If not, con-
sider trying something else.
 Be willing to change. Reiki as an empower-
ment tool may bring to your attention changes
that you need to make. For example, you may
need to get more sleep or exercise. Or you
may need to eat less at night. If you don’t
make changes, then nothing else changes. Or
put another way, if nothing changes, then
nothing changes.
 Be persistent. You may need to go through
this list over and over again. Healing is a huge
endeavor and may require more than pills or
surgery can give you. You may need to rede-
fine your health goals, try something again,
note the effects, and make more changes,
over and over again.
Don’t give up on the road to healing — which is
also the road of self-discovery and enlighten-
ment. Every challenge that comes before you
can teach you great things.

 Work and chores
 Community and spirituality
 Intimacy and connection with others
Creating a good balance of these parts of your life is related to your physical,
mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. If you find that your life lacks the
balance that promotes good health and your health is suffering, you may
need to seek professional help for the following:
 Diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions
 Medicines or supplements
 Surgical procedures
 Reiki or other energy work such as acupuncture, Qigong, and homeopathy
 Bodywork such as massage, chiropractic, or physical therapy
 Talk therapy and emotional release work
 Addiction recovery treatment
Reiki works with all the self-care and professional-care tools that I mention in
this section.
Reiki and healthcare professionals
Nurses and doctors are learning Reiki and using it in their clinical practice.
Other healthcare practitioners such as emergency medical technicians, mas-
sage therapists, and other types of “bodyworkers,” social workers, and other
types of mental health practitioners are also learning Reiki to add to their
toolbox to heal others.
When a doctor or nurse who has learned Reiki places their hand on a patient,
Reiki flows. I think this is the way medicine was always meant to be prac-
ticed. It is the healthcare professionals who are leading the way to bringing
Reiki into the hospitals, clinics, and into the healthcare system in general so
that patients can have a choice of different tools for their health.
Healthcare professionals who are also Reiki practitioners are also working on
designing and carrying out studies to find out which diseases can most bene-
fit from Reiki treatment.

Reiki and different healthcare conditions
When you consider that Reiki reduces stress and that stress is a factor in so
many illnesses, it makes sense that Reiki can help so many illnesses. I list
below some of the different conditions where individuals have reported 
benefiting from Reiki.
 Addictions
 AIDS/HIV
 Arthritis
 Attention deficit disorder
 Autism
 Back pain
 Burns
 Cancer: breast, colon, endometrial, lung, throat; leukemia
 Crohn’s disease
 Depression
 Diabetes
 Endometriosis
 Fibromyalgia
 Heart condition
 Hepatitis C
 High blood pressure
 Hypothyroidism
 Insomnia
 Irritable bowel syndrome
 Kidney stone
 Lupus
 Migraines
 Multiple sclerosis
 Neck pain
 Stroke
 TMJ (TemporoMandibular Joint Disorders)
 Toothache
 Uterine fibroids
238
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

This list gives you an idea that Reiki is applicable to many different disorders.
Reiki can provide supportive healing for these and many other medical 
conditions.
Reiki in hospitals
The benefits of Reiki have not gone unnoticed by the medical profession.
Increasing numbers of hospitals are offering Reiki to their patients. In some
cases, the regular medical and nursing staffs provide Reiki, and in other
cases, separate units or volunteers provide Reiki.
Ask your doctor and other medical staff to see whether the following treat-
ments are available in your hospital:
 Inpatient Reiki treatment before or after medical procedures
 Outpatient Reiki treatment
 Reiki training so you can give Reiki to yourself when you get home
When looking to see if your hospital offers Reiki, you can check to see if they
have a department or section that deals with integrative medicine or mind-
body medicine.
Reiki and medicines
Reiki helps the body use any medications, including pharmaceuticals, over-
the-counter medications, herbs, or supplements. You can perform Reiki on
the pills or vials of medication or give a Reiki treatment to the person who is
on medication. Reiki helps by
 Reducing the negative side effects of medication
 Promoting the positive effects of medication
You may wonder how Reiki can do these seemingly miraculous things. Reiki
is an “intelligent” energy that aims to provide the highest good. The highest
good is to benefit from the medicine as quickly as possible. Reiki can help
that happen.
Don’t discontinue any medication until directed to do so by a healthcare pro-
fessional. If a change of medication seems warranted, check with the profes-
sional who prescribed it.
239
Chapter 16: Combining Reiki with Other Health Practices

Examining Reiki medical studies
Most of the information on the usefulness of Reiki in medical situations is
from anecdotal evidence. An anecdote is a story from one person such as:
My sister didn’t have to have her knee replacement surgery after she tried
Reiki!
This anecdotal evidence, or story, is interesting but there is no evidence that
other people who try Reiki will have the same result.
Previously, most people studying Reiki didn’t have the resources or experience
to perform controlled scientific studies on groups of people who try Reiki.
Reiki is a subtle energy, and its effects may also be subtle compared with
other types of treatments. As someone who went to graduate school in epi-
demiology, which is the study of diseases, I would like to also point out that 
it takes special methodology in terms of both study design and analysis to
“prove” a treatment or cause for any disease and it is common to find that
studies differ in their results. Given all of that, I believe that soon the medical
studies will prove what Reiki practitioners see all the time: the miracles of
healing that Reiki can provide.
Four different Reiki clinical trials are currently registered on the Web site of
the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) 
at http://nccam.nih.gov/ (see the appendix for more information):

Reiki in the waiting room
Joy, a friend of mind who is a Reiki Master told
me, “I gave Reiki to my husband as he was wait-
ing to have an angiogram, which helped him to
relax and not to tighten up before his procedure.
I noticed there was another woman giving Reiki
to her husband. Then I was sent to a second
waiting room where I introduced myself to Lisa
(who turned out to also be a Reiki practitioner).
After two hours went by, Lisa received a page to
pick up the phone. She was advised that her hus-
band had to receive a quadruple bypass. Lisa
became hysterical, and I immediately offered her
Reiki, which helped her to become calmer. So
Reiki is not only for the patient but also to support
their families.”
The synchronicity and connection that Reiki 
can bring continued between these two fami-
lies. Joy soon discovered that her husband 
also needed quadruple bypass surgery. When
Joy and her husband attended the pre-op
appointment, they met Lisa again, and she told
them that her husband had come through his
surgery successfully. Joy’s husband had
surgery the next day, after receiving lots of Reiki
energy, and he too is recuperating well. Reiki
can help the healing process for the entire
family.

 Efficacy of Reiki in the treatment of fibromyalgia
 Effects of Reiki on painful neuropathy and cardiovascular risk factors
 Reiki/energy healing in prostate cancer
 The use of Reiki for patients with advanced AIDS
The results from these and other studies should help you understand which
illnesses or conditions can best benefit from Reiki from a clinically relevant
standpoint.
Because Reiki is an energy medicine, some practitioners also look at studies
on other forms of energy medicine such as therapeutic touch, Qigong, and
polarity therapy. Any illness or condition that responds to another form of
energy medicine may also respond well to Reiki.
I supply resources to investigate studies on Reiki and medicine in the 
appendix.
Using Different Reiki Techniques 
for Illness or Pain
When you use Reiki to treat a specific illness or pain, you can take a variety of
approaches in the way you conduct the Reiki session:
 Perform the standard hand positions on front and back of the body 
(see Chapter 10). By doing so, you know that all parts of the body are
covered.
 Use your knowledge of anatomy to focus energy on the body part in
question (see Chapter 2 for an illustration of the body). The study of
human anatomy aids you in your Reiki practice.
 Decide which chakra energy center is associated with the problem and
focus on that chakra (see Chapter 2 for a description of the seven-
chakra system).
 Use your intuition to know exactly where to place your hands. Read
about the Reiji Ho approach (see Chapter 10), in which you use your
intuitive skill, and the scanning technique (see Chapter 10) in which 
you let your hands sense the areas of the body needing attention.
 Follow The Original Reiki Handbook of Dr. Mikao Usui, written by Mikao
Usui and Frank Arjava Petter, which gives some advice on how to treat
certain illnesses (for more information, see the appendix).
You may use any combination of the techniques above to treat a physical ill-
ness in conjunction with the pursuit of necessary medical care.
241
Chapter 16: Combining Reiki with Other Health Practices

Reiki energy flows to the parts of the body where it is needed. Even when you
don’t know exactly where to put your hands, intend for Reiki to heal for the
highest good, and that is exactly what will happen!
Observe the situation. If someone is ill, try using Reiki, but if it doesn’t seem
to be helping, then add another technique to the healing toolbox.
Using Reiki in Special Situations
What is wonderful about Reiki is its ease of use. You don’t need special equip-
ment — just a pair of hands from someone who has studied Reiki (see
Chapter 7). Because you can give Reiki with just the touch of a hand or even
send it from across the room (see Chapter 10), Reiki can be used in many dif-
ferent situations.
Reiki in first-aid situations
In a situation requiring first aid, after you perform necessary measures and
call for professional medical care, you can use Reiki to help calm down
anyone who is injured and promote quicker healing. For example, if someone
sprains their ankle, you can give them ice and also apply Reiki.
If you are sitting in the emergency waiting room, you can apply Reiki while
waiting (see the sidebar: “Reiki in the waiting room”). In the case of serious
accidents, apply Reiki after you have called emergency services and while
you are waiting for the ambulance. While the ambulance crew is working on
the person, stand back and beam Reiki from across the room (see Chapter
10) or send distant Reiki (see Chapter 15).
Reiki and surgery
Reiki can be helpful both before and after surgery. Before surgery, Reiki helps
your body prepare for the operation to come. The better the condition before
surgery, the quicker you will heal and recover. After surgery, Reiki helps the
body recuperate.
Surgery acts on a physical level to repair or remove damaged tissue. Reiki
helps on an energy level to help the surgical patient relax, reduce anxiety, and
prepare the patient for the changes that surgery brings.
Some people like to send distant Reiki to the surgeon and surgical team or for
the best outcome for the person undergoing the surgery (see Chapter 15 for
more about distant Reiki).

Reiki during labor and birth
Reiki provides a gentle touch during the emotional and special time of child-
birth. A husband, mother, or best friend may want to learn Reiki and be pre-
pared to help the mother-to-be through labor. Or a staff member who assists
in the birth may also be a Reiki practitioner. See Chapter 6 for a story about
how Reiki helped during a difficult birth to give the mother peace of mind
despite the pain of contractions and fear of bleeding.
Reiki brings a spiritual energy to the sacred process of birth.
Reiki and chemotherapy or radiation
The methods used to kill cancer cells can also wreak havoc on the healthy
cells. Chemotherapy and radiation are effective in killing different types of
cancer, but they can also cause difficult-to-manage side effects like insomnia,
nausea, and fatigue.
Reiki works to keep your body balanced during chemotherapy or radiation
therapy. By using Reiki before the start of anticancer treatment and during
the treatment process, the body’s inner harmony is better maintained. This
can help lessen side effects and reduce the time it takes to recover fully.
Reiki around the time of death
As a gentle and noninvasive treatment for people at the end of their life, Reiki
is often used in hospitals, nursing homes, and hospice situations. Reiki helps
the person accept their situation and lessens pain and anxiety. The use of
Reiki also brings about a sense of calmness and peace, which brings relief to
both patients and their family at this time of transition.
More and more hospice nurses and other people who work with people at
the end-of-life are receiving Reiki training. I was encouraged to find out that
our assigned hospice nurse (who met my dad only the day before he died)
had studied first-level Reiki. The Long Island Reiki Association had a presen-
tation on “Reiki at the End of Life,” which I attended a few months before my
dad died. I heard the stories of various people who had used Reiki, including
nurses who helped their patients die with dignity and peace. See Chapter 6
for my experience with using Reiki around the time of death for both of my
parents.
243
Chapter 16: Combining Reiki with Other Health Practices

Matching Reiki with Bodywork
Any type of treatment that uses a hands-on approach is a natural partner for
Reiki. When the hands are placed on the body for massage, physical therapy,
chiropractic work or other types of bodywork, they can also transmit Reiki.
Reiki works at the level of the body’s energy, and the massage or physical
therapy work on the muscles and joints themselves. Together, these treat-
ments can help the recipient work through deeply held patterns of strain or
pain.
Some classifications of bodywork include Reiki as a type of bodywork, pre-
sumably because Reiki involves hands on the body. But Reiki doesn’t involve
movement of muscle or manipulation and is better classified as “energy
work.”
One problem with different classifications is that all healing deals with the
same underlying problems, but each form of bodywork approaches healing
from a different angle.
Bodywork and energy work together make a winning combination. As a mas-
sage therapist, chiropractor, or other type of bodyworker you can use Reiki
in any of the ways discussed in Chapters 11 and 13.
I start you off on your journey combining Reiki with your bodywork practice
with these suggestions:
 If the person is sitting: Put your hands on the person’s shoulders and
stand quietly for a few minutes while giving Reiki energy. Or you can
hold your hands gently on the crown chakra.
 If the person is lying: You can use any of the hand positions listed in
Chapter 10. On the front of the body, try holding your hands over the
heart chakra and the sacral chakra. On the back of the body, hold the
neck (back of the throat chakra) and the lower back (sacral chakra)
simultaneously.
 Before and after the session: Use the aura cleansing technique to
“sweep” away energy before and after your session.
I’m sure you will enjoy using Reiki to enhance your work.
When the client is relaxed with Reiki, the bodywork part of the treatment is
easier and more effective. Reiki also helps seal in the change in body struc-
ture and movement to better effect longer-term improvements.
244
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Using Reiki with Counseling
A therapist friend who is also a Reiki practitioner says, “your issues are in
your tissues,” where tissues refers to the components of the body. This is the
basis of mind-body medicine: What is in your mind is in your body and what
is in your body is in your mind. She realizes the limitations of talk therapy on
its own and recommends Reiki to some of her clients. She is not alone. More
mental health practitioners realize the value of bodywork and energy work in
the resolution and transformation of emotional issues. Therapists who know
Reiki may give Reiki to clients, or they may recommend a Reiki practitioner to
their clients.
Reiki works to release energy blocks and can help release and bring to light
long-standing blocks (see the section “Releasing energy blocks,” earlier in
this chapter).
If you’re seeing a mental health counselor, schedule an appointment the day
after a Reiki session. Issues are likely to come up during a Reiki session that
you’ll want to discuss as soon as possible with your therapist. Although Reiki
helps to bring up issues, a trained mental health practitioner will be able to
then help you work through the insights and feelings that are raised.
Reiki brings in a gentle, loving touch that also helps to heal broken hearts
and mend unimaginable hurts.
Using Reiki to Change Habits 
and Heal Addictions
Whereas a habit can be simply annoying or bothersome, an addiction is
downright dangerous. You can be addicted to anything from food to pills to
245
Chapter 16: Combining Reiki with Other Health Practices
Combining Reiki and massage
I admit it: I love to receive a good massage. And
I particularly love it when a practitioner com-
bines massage and Reiki. I’ve reached the point
where a massage without some type of energy
work feels like something is missing.
On the other hand, I once had a Reiki session
during which the practitioner told me, “You
need a massage for your shoulders.” That Reiki
practitioner wasn’t licensed to practice mas-
sage, but she sensed that I needed more than
what Reiki could give me — at least in terms of
my shoulder tension.

cigarettes to sex. Alcoholism, drug addictions, eating disorders, and gambling
addictions are notoriously difficult — but not impossible — to overcome.
Reiki has a role in helping to overcome habits and addiction by reducing the
effects of stress and promoting overall well-being.
Overcoming addictions
Reiki has great potential to help people with addictions heal while they’re
also trying other therapies, regardless of which of the following they’re doing:
 Going to an inpatient treatment center
 Seeking psychiatric or psychological help
 Attending a 12-step recovery program
Reiki can help people with addictions do the following:
 Stay calm during the withdrawal period
 Provide them with new ways of coping with the ups and downs of life
 Connect to spirit and a feeling of bliss (without suffering a hangover the
next day)
Trying a technique for 
addictions and habits
If a Reiki recipient has a habit or addiction he wants to heal or you are work-
ing on your own habit or addiction, you can try this healing technique, which
is also called deprogramming method and mental technique.
1. Choose a time to perform the technique to remove addictions and
change habits.
You can use this technique during a Reiki session (see Chapter 13) or a
self-Reiki session (see Chapter 11).
If you use this technique outside of a Reiki session, make sure the recipi-
ent has already relaxed and is open to receiving Reiki by performing an
aura cleansing (see Chapter 13) or meditating (see Chapter 9) before
using this technique.

2. Make an affirmation stating the intention to heal. Here are some
examples:
• I am free of nicotine addiction.
• I treat myself with loving kindness.
• I enjoy nutritious life-enhancing foods.
3. Put one hand on the upper forehead and one hand low on the back of
the head over the bump, or occipital ridge, just above the neck.
4. Imagine the first three Reiki symbols (Chapter 8) and say each name
out loud or to yourself: Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen, Sei Hei Ki, and Cho 
Ku Rei.
5. Say the affirmation in your mind or out loud three times. Keep your
hands in position until you feel the affirmation has “taken.”
For this technique, experiment with your hands to see which hand position
feels the strongest (for me, it’s the right hand on my forehead and left on the
back of the head).
If you use this technique without symbols, that method is similar to the
Japanese technique called Nentatsu Ho, or method for sending thought. The
Japanese technique Seiheki Chiryo Ho (healing habits technique) is almost
identical to this technique, except that the Distance symbol isn’t used.
The single most important tool you have is your intention to heal yourself.
Repeated use of this technique or any of its variants is necessary for success.
Getting substances out of your body takes time. You need at least a month to
change your behavior to a new habit, and you need more than that to learn
new ways of coping without a substance or habit.

Chapter 17
Becoming a Professional 
Reiki Healer
In This Chapter
 Going the professional route with Reiki
 Working with integrity
 Making a business plan
 Participating in the Reiki community
You may decide to take Reiki beyond using it for just yourself and your
family and enter the world of professional healing. Some people give
Reiki on a volunteer basis, and others use Reiki healing to create part or all of
their income. In any case, practitioners must follow the highest level of
integrity in their work.
In this chapter, I discuss what it means to be a Reiki healer and things to con-
sider as you build a successful practice. Even volunteer work is a business of
sorts — it just doesn’t charge for services. The same standards of practice
that I discuss in this chapter apply for Reiki volunteer work; you just don’t
have to concern yourself with receiving money from individuals.
Making a Business out of Reiki
I know that reading the words “Reiki” and “business” in the same sentence
will upset some people. Some folks aren’t happy that anyone charges for a
healing therapy such as Reiki. In this world, however, healers of all types
charge for their services, whether they’re massage therapists, doctors, or
chiropractors. It makes sense that someone who practices Reiki also needs to
make a living.

To make a business out of Reiki, you have the following options:
 You can add Reiki to your existing therapeutic practice (see Chapter 16).
This works if you’re already a professional such as a social worker,
nurse, or physical therapist and want to include Reiki as part of the 
services you offer.
 You can work as an employee providing Reiki at a healthcare or healing
center.
 You can start a small business providing Reiki on either a part-time or
full-time basis.
Because most people are in the third category — wanting to provide Reiki as
a self-employed practitioner — that will be the focus of this chapter.
When you are self-employed, it’s up to you to pay taxes and report any earn-
ings to the tax office in your state or country. Employ an accountant to help
you with financial issues such as taxes. Consulting your local tax office can
provide very useful information on setting up a small business, bookkeeping,
deductions, self-employment, and other tax issues.
Maintaining High Standards
It’s essential to keep your intentions clear: to be a pure channel for Reiki
energy and maintain the highest level of integrity and healthy boundaries
(see Chapter 13). When Reiki practitioners hold to high standards of practice,
more people are likely to consider Reiki as a potential treatment.
Some Reiki practitioners have an overwhelming desire to heal others. Other
people like to use Reiki but don’t feel comfortable calling themselves a healer.
Between these extremes is a healthy balance of knowing your limitations but
also knowing your skills as a healer.
The role models of healers in our society range from religious figures to your
family doctor. Mikao Usui is a role model for Reiki practitioners, and he mod-
eled humility, flexibility, and personal growth.
The road to becoming a healer is longer than a three-day Master Reiki class.
250
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

From my own experience as both a Reiki practitioner and Reiki recipient and
thereby observing many Reiki practitioners in action, I suggest the following:
 Get training and more training. You’ll feel more confident as a practi-
tioner when you know you have the knowledge and skills you need. But
don’t use this to feed your insecurity, as in always feeling you are never
enough. You are enough, and you deserve to allow yourself the skills to
be the best you can be.
 Use a mentor or other professional feedback. Seek support from your
Reiki teacher or other professional healers. Most healing professions
have supervision for new healers to address issues that inevitably arise.
 Join professional organizations. These groups offer a way to stay in
touch with other Reiki healers and find out about new issues that can
affect you.
 Follow the laws in your state. You should not only keep informed but
also stay on the right side of the law. In some cases, this means changing
the way you practice so that you follow the law of the land. See the sec-
tion “Knowing the legal issues of practicing Reiki,” later in this chapter.
 Practice from the highest level of integrity. Know your place as a
healer. See Chapter 13 for the details about ethics and boundaries.
 Ask for feedback. When you teach or give a Reiki session, you can ask
the students or recipients for feedback, either verbally or in the form of
a questionnaire.
 Continue your own healing. First and foremost, you must heal yourself.
This task is ongoing and gives you the experience and compassion to
help others. See Chapter 19 to read about personal growth and Reiki.
 Plan your classes or sessions. Think through the syllabus for your class
or content of your Reiki session. Incorporate any changes that arise
from feedback from your mentor or students.
 Respect money. Professionals charge their clients for their time and ser-
vices. You have spent time and energy to gain the abilities to use Reiki.
Charge enough for your services so that you’re compensated enough
not only to survive but also to live fruitfully.
Most of you have other roles in addition to your role as a Reiki practitioners.
For example, I am a Reiki practitioner and also a writer. You might be a nurse,
doctor, massage therapist, artist, insurance salesman, mother, or teacher.
Your own life experience comes in handy because the people you see for
Reiki sessions or classes are also incorporating Reiki into their lives. You can
show them how to use Reiki in their lives by your example.
251
Chapter 17: Becoming a Professional Reiki Healer

Remembering that you are 
a facilitator of healing
People come to Reiki because they are ready to raise their energy, solve their
own problems, and remove blocks — they’re ready to heal. They come to you
as a facilitator to help them make the connection to the Reiki energy. In this
sense, you are like the tubing through which Reiki energy flows.
Keep the Reiki Principles (see Chapter 4) foremost in your mind when prac-
ticing Reiki, and consider this principle: Just for today, I will be humble.
Knowing your place as a Reiki professional
In addition to the boundaries I discuss in Chapter 13, remember the following:
 Distinguish your professional and personal relationships. If you make
friends with your clients and your friends become your clients, the rela-
tionships can get muddled very quickly. Are you going to be able to con-
tinue to get paid and maintain a professional atmosphere around
someone who has become your friend? When you have clients who are
also friends, you must work even harder to maintain professional bound-
aries (See Chapter 13). Otherwise, if things get messy, you could lose
your client or, even worse, your friend.
 Don’t practice medicine or massage unless you are licensed to do 
so. Don’t give advice about what people should eat or what herbs to
take. You can advise them to consult a nutritionist or doctor or acupunc-
turist. Beyond that, you are there only to practice Reiki.
Planning Your Reiki Business
As a professional Reiki practitioner, you need to establish a place to do Reiki
and set prices for your work, among other things. These things are all part of
your business plan. The more effort you put into a business plan, the more
you’ll get out of it. Here are some suggestions to consider in your business
plan:
 Set your goals for your Reiki business. What do you want to achieve?
Do you have a financial goal? Do you want to serve a certain number of
recipients? Teach a certain number of courses? Be as specific as possi-
ble. You can also set up one-year, three-year, and five-year plans.
252
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

 Make a list of supplies needed. Supplies include everything from a mas-
sage table to tissues and paper towels to a water cooler.
 Plan a marketing strategy. How are you planning to attract clients or
students?
• Think of the people you’re trying to attract. Where do they live?
How old are they?
• Consider planning a word-of-mouth campaign through telephone
or e-mails.
• Promote yourself by introducing yourself at local businesses, such
as health food stores, massage salons, spas, and chiropractors’
offices.
• Develop a Web site.
• Write a print or e-mail newsletter.
• Speak at local establishments.
• Sponsor an open house or other promotional event to attract
clients or students.
 Plan for advertising. Decide whether you’ll advertise in newspapers,
magazines, or newsletters or on the radio or the Internet.
 Create promotional material. Either do it yourself or hire a professional
artist or printing company to produce flyers, brochures, and business
cards.
 Decide how you’ll process and manage money. You need to set up a
business checking account, bookkeeping strategies, and credit card
accounts (to receive payment).
This list may seem long, but planning a business is a big job. Take it step by
step and note how other complementary and alternative therapists are suc-
ceeding (or not) in your area. Learn from other people’s mistakes.
Getting business assistance
When starting your new business, plan ahead as much as possible. Consult a
professional accountant or small business analyst for advice.
Also, you must know what money you have to invest in your business and
what type of income you need to make. By setting your financial goals, you
will have an idea of your target.
253
Chapter 17: Becoming a Professional Reiki Healer

If you’re one of those people who hates to talk or think about money, it’s time
to get over that attitude if you want to make a go of your business of helping
people heal through Reiki.
Knowing the legal issues of practicing Reiki
Reiki is a relatively new treatment, and the legal and political worlds have not
yet decided how to deal with it. Here are the two most important issues to
consider:
 Liability insurance: It makes good business sense to have some sort of
insurance. Your local Reiki organization should be able to inform you of
options in your area.
 What you are legally able to do: In some locations, it’s illegal to prac-
tice any type of bodywork (including Reiki) unless you have a massage
license. Consult your local Reiki association, state health department, or
a lawyer for advice.
Pricing your services fairly
As you set up shop, you need to come up with the prices for your services.
You may decide on a sliding scale fee or other special rates that you want to
offer.
Check out the usual rates for Reiki sessions and classes in your area and also
find out the cost for a local massage. Generally, the price of a Reiki sessions
and a massage are similar, though Reiki is sometimes priced a little lower.
You need to be able to cover all your costs and also provide yourself with
adequate compensation for your time and efforts.
Finding the perfect healing space
You don’t need much for Reiki, but you do need to provide a space for heal-
ing to occur. Location is critical because you want to be easily accessible to
the people who will come for Reiki. Sometimes the location that will reach
the most people is in the middle of a city! Read more about space for Reiki
sessions in Chapter 13.
254
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 

Depending on how often you teach Reiki, you can rent a space to use occa-
sionally or use your home or a public space, such as a room you can rent at
your local library or community center. Also consider spaces where yoga
classes are taught. The size of the room depends on how many students you
have in your class.
Using your home as your Reiki space has pros and cons. Here are the pros:
 Convenience
 Less expensive than other options
 Use as a tax deduction (speak to an accountant about this)
 Control over noise and other disturbances
255
Chapter 17: Becoming a Professional Reiki Healer
Considering the Reiki table
Most Reiki tables are simply massage tables
adapted to use for Reiki. First consider the fol-
lowing features of a Reiki table.
 Weight of the table: Will you be leaving your
table in one spot or carrying it around from
place to place? Consider a lighter weight
table if you’ll be frequently moving it around.
Each extra pound of table can make a dif-
ference to your arms and shoulders!
 Faceplate: When the Reiki recipient is lying
on her stomach, you may want to use a face-
plate, which is an appendage to the table that
holds the face. Although massage therapists
need to have the face properly supported
during the pressure of massage, a faceplate
is optional during Reiki, and not all Reiki prac-
titioners use the faceplate.
 Table legs: Because the Reiki practitioner
may sit while performing Reiki at the head
and foot of the Reiki recipient, it’s useful to
have a table with legroom. Some massage
tables come with legroom, or the company
may offer a special end plate to adapt the
table for Reiki use.
Here are some tips for finding a Reiki table of
your own:
 If you see a table you like at a Reiki share
(see Chapter 14), ask the practitioner for the
name of the brand.
 Check out your local massage supply shop.
 Ask your Reiki Master or other Reiki friends.
 Check out the classified ads in newspapers.
 You can find tables through many of the
Reiki resources listed in the Appendix and
by doing a search for “Reiki table” on the
Web.
 Popular brands of tables include Earthlite,
Stronglight, and Astra Lite.
Then you have the fun part of picking out the color
or getting a nice cover for your table! Consider
what will enhance your client’s experience.

Using your home as your Reiki space also has its downside:
 Possible disruption to your family
 Loss of privacy
 Concerns about security
 Loss of space in your home for personal use
Sometimes Reiki space within a home also may appear less professional
when family knickknacks are on display or the telephone is ringing for your
children.
256
Part IV: Sharing Reiki with Others 
Considering your Reiki classes from start to finish
If you want to teach Reiki as part of your prac-
tice, think about how you will present your
classes. Also consider the following:
 Which classes will you teach?
 What are the prerequisites?
 Where will you teach?
 How long is each class?
 What is the cost?
See Chapter 7 for ideas on how to plan your
Reiki classes. Here are other things you should
consider doing:
 Creating Reiki class outlines: Create a
course syllabus that includes how each day
of class will proceed, including topics to be
covered, attunements, and lunch breaks.
 Producing Reiki course materials: You can
use this book or another source as your
class materials, or you can produce your
own materials. Remember that you can’t
just photocopy information from different
books and pass it to your students. Doing so
can be considered copyright infringement!
You’re better off choosing certain books for
your students to purchase and supplement-
ing as necessary with material that you
prepare yourself.
 Designing certificates: Follow your Reiki
Master Teacher’s suggestions for produc-
ing certificates. You may have a seal and
may need to purchase certificates and use
a fine pen or your computer to individualize
each certificate.
Your Reiki teacher should teach you how to pre-
pare a Reiki class. But like developing your own
style when giving Reiki (see Chapter 13), you’ll
also develop your own style when teaching
Reiki.

Getting the right equipment
You don’t need much equipment for Reiki, but you do need the following
items:
 Reiki table: This item is the same as a massage table except that a Reiki
table has room to put your legs under the front and back of the table
when sitting at a chair.
 Chairs: You need a chair to sit on when giving Reiki, and if you have
room, you may want to provide a chair for the recipient to rest in after
the session.
 Bolsters and pillows: You put these items under the recipient’s head
and/or knees during a session.
 Music system: Your sound system can be simple or more elaborate but
all you need is a low volume during a session or class.
If you want, you can add extras like plants, rugs, and wall hangings to person-
alize the space.
Being Part of the Reiki Community
The advantages of joining your local Reiki circle are many (see Chapter 14 for
a discussion of Reiki circles, shares, and retreats). As a professional Reiki
practitioner, you can
 Network with other Reiki practitioners.
 Find new clients or mentors.
 Share your information with others.
 Work with others in your community to raise awareness of Reiki healing.
Dealing with the competition
If you’re feeling competitive about or fearful of other Reiki practitioners, that
is a sign that you need to get a better business plan or do some Reiki on your-
self to deal with fears of abundance.
257
Chapter 17: Becoming a Professional Reiki Healer

Here are some affirmations to work with:
“There is enough for everyone. There is enough to go around.”
“I am guided to develop my Reiki practice by spirit and the power of
Reiki.”
What you put out into the world is what will come back to you!
Staying up-to-date in the world of Reiki
Even though Mikao Usui developed Reiki in the 1920s, the world of Reiki is
still changing. For example, the history of Reiki taught to most Reiki masters
before 2000 or so probably taught more myth than fact. If you haven’t read a
more recent book on Reiki (like this one) or kept in touch with Reiki associa-
tions, you might have missed the fact that research in Japan has come up
with more accurate information on Reiki history (see Chapter 3 for details
about Reiki history and Chapter 20 for info about Reiki myths). Here are
some reasons to stay current:
 If you don’t keep up with the world of Reiki, you may teach your stu-
dents incorrect information.
 If you don’t keep up with legal issues about Reiki in your state, you may
miss important information that could directly affect you.
 If you don’t keep up with health issues related to Reiki, you may not find
out when Reiki is covered by health insurance (keep your fingers
crossed) or when your local hospital is looking for Reiki practitioners.
Keep current about Reiki by reading Reiki books, magazines, and newsletters
and being part of a Reiki organization. See the Appendix for information on
these resources.

In this part . . .
U
sing Reiki in your life can be fun, genuinely helpful,
and mind-expanding. The Part of Tens gives you
some extra information you can use to take Reiki to the
next level — whatever that means for you.
In this part, you can find out how to use Reiki in your
everyday life, from energizing your food to protecting
your car, and how to use Reiki to expand your personal
growth. You also get a chapter on facts that shatter some
of the myths surrounding Reiki. Finally, I include some
extra non-traditional Reiki symbols for you to check out.

Chapter 18
Ten Uses for Reiki 
in Everyday Situations
In This Chapter
 Using Reiki to energize personal items
 Using Reiki to protect your family, home, and car
 Using Reiki to cleanse the air at home or at work
A
fter you study Reiki I or Reiki II (see Chapter 7), you can begin to use
Reiki in all sorts of situations. Here’s where the word imagination comes
into play. Apply the Reiki energy to energize or protect anything from your
bicycle to your flowers to the food you eat. Or you may want to remove stag-
nant energy and use Reiki to clear the air. This chapter describes ten different
ways to use Reiki in and around your home.
Reiki can do no harm, so you might as well give it a try! In any situation
where you can use prayer, you can use Reiki. In any situation you can think
of, you can use Reiki.
Helping Plants Reach Their Potential
Plants come in all forms — from ground huggers like moss and grass to color-
ful flower and vegetable plants to great big trees! Just like people and animals,
plants are live beings that can benefit from the Reiki energy.

Reiki can help plants grow, flower, and fruit. Now you may be someone who
talks or sings to plants, or you may not. But you’ll find that Reiki will help
your plants, indoor or outdoor, grow and grow and grow. Here are some tips
for using Reiki:
 Use Reiki on seeds before planting.
 Send Reiki to plants before pruning or cutting flowers. (I use this method
to “connect” with the plant and find out the best spot to cut it.)
 Use Reiki on any plant that is ailing.
 Use Reiki on the water before watering plants.
I’ve heard a rumor that if you give Reiki to plants that have insects, the Reiki
will help not only the plant but also the bugs. Supposedly the insects grow in
numbers! This myth illustrates the importance of intention when sending
Reiki. Set your intention to help the plants, and that’s what will happen. As
the plant becomes healthier, it’s more likely to resist insect attack.
Boosting Your Food’s Fortitude
Food nourishes the physical body. Many Reiki practitioners make it a habit to
send Reiki to their food just before they eat. Put your hands around the plate
of food and send it the Power symbol (see Chapter 8). Leave your hands
there while you feel the energy entering and boosting the energy of your
food. You’ll know when to start eating! Here is what Reiki can do:
 Bring out the most of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients in the
food.
 Reduce any harmful qualities of the food, such as pesticides.
As I mention throughout the book, always remember the three i’s of Reiki:
intention, intuition, and integrity. Intend for your food’s energy to be
increased, use your intuition to know how and when to use Reiki and what to
eat and when to stop eating, and have integrity with how you use Reiki and
food. When using Reiki with food, integrity means that you use the best food
you can afford, find, and prepare and then send Reiki to it. You can use Reiki
on a plate of junk food, but it won’t be as healthy as more nutritious fare.
Use Reiki while you prepare food for others. Preparing food with the love of
Reiki is a beautiful gift for yourself and others. You can Reiki your family’s
meals or even your pet’s food bowls!
262
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Shoring Up Your Water
Just as you use Reiki to energize and purify the food you eat, you can use
Reiki on the water you drink. Charge the water with Reiki when you do the
following:
 Take a bath
 Water your plants
 Drink your eight cups of water a day
 Boil water for tea
 Give water to your pets
The earth’s water is constantly recycled. We drink water and get water from
our foods, and then we excrete water in perspiration, urine, and feces. Our
wastewater enters the water cycle and can become part of water that is evap-
orated into clouds, becoming rain or snow that feed streams and lakes and
oceans. Sending Reiki to water is to connect to this stream of life’s necessary
elixir.
If you want to send Reiki to the earth, sending it to the earth’s oceans, rivers,
and lakes, you can help both the physical planet and the people who come
into contact with the water.
Making the Most of Your Medicine
If you take any sort of daily pill, whether it’s a prescribed medication or pain
reliever, consider charging it with Reiki beforehand. I had the experience of
taking a necessary prescription medication and then going for a session with
a Reiki Master. She knew intuitively that I was taking a medication and sug-
gested that I Reiki the pill before swallowing it.
The advantage of using Reiki on prescription or over-the-counter medications
is that you intend to do the following:
 Reduce or eliminate dangerous side effects
 Maximize the healing benefits of the drug
You can also use Reiki on any vitamins, minerals, or herbal supplements you
take. Reiki will boost the healing properties of these nutrients and potions in
the same way it boosts the energy in food itself (see the section “Boosting
Your Food’s Fortitude,” earlier in this chapter).
263
Chapter 18: Ten Uses for Reiki in Everyday Situations

Calming Computer Problems
Reiki works on electronic appliances, including computers. Because I work on
a computer (as I type these words, in fact), I have more experience with this
type of appliance than most others! Do you ever find that your computer
freezes up and just stops working? Or have you experienced lost documents
or other computer problems? Try sending Reiki to your computer when it acts
up. Better yet, send Reiki to it regularly to prevent a problem from occurring.
If you have Reiki I training, just put your hands on an object, intend for the
Reiki energy to flow, and let it happen! If you have Reiki II training, you can
consciously use the Reiki symbols (see Chapter 8) or send Reiki at a distance
(see Chapter 15).
Although Reiki can help your computer and work life run smoothly, remem-
ber that Reiki isn’t a substitute for good computer practices. You need to
save your documents frequently and use a good antivirus software to protect
your computer from viruses, spyware, and other malicious programs. Just as
Reiki works with medicine to bring about a cure or healing, Reiki will help
you on the job to promote the best possible outcome.
Use Reiki on other objects at your workplace. You can use Reiki on your desk,
your mail, your van, your e-mail, your tools, the telephone, your tests, pen-
cils, your stethoscope, your inventory, and even your cash register.
To cleanse inanimate objects, try Jakikiri Joka Ho (see Chapter 12), though
personally, I wouldn’t use this on a computer unless I had assured backups.
But it works for crystals, clothing, and other objects from which you want to
remove any negative energy.
Managing Money with Reiki
Here’s something that everyone seems to want more of. I’m talking about
money in your wallet, bank account, or piggy bank.
You may have the misconception that money is evil. Some people in spiritual
circles think that money is bad. Money itself isn’t good or bad; what humans
do with it or think about it is what brings about problems. Start thinking
more positively about money: how you earned it, what you’re doing with it,
and how other people are connected with it. That bill in your wallet may have
touched the hands of hundreds if not thousands of people!
264
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Use the three i’s when it comes to money: Intend to increase your prosperity,
use your intuition to learn ways to create more abundance in your life or sav-
ings, and use integrity in the way you earn your living.
One of the Reiki Principles (see Chapter 4) states, be honest in your work. To
have integrity means you’re earning your living honestly, and there is no
shame in leading a spiritual life that is rich with abundance. (See Chapter 20
for some info about Reiki and money.)
Send Reiki to your money. Your returns will be worthwhile.
Bolstering Up Your Automobile
Cars and drivers need protection. Whether you’re driving alone at night,
going on vacation with your family, or sending your child to drive alone for
the first time, you can use Reiki to add protection. Here are some tips for
using Reiki for cars and road trips:
 Whether you are a driver or passenger, you can put a Power symbol (see
Chapter 8) in the car before starting the trip. Set an intention for a safe
journey.
 Send Reiki while you’re on the road. Send Reiki to any traffic you
encounter and definitely send Reiki to any roadside accident. You can
also send Reiki to the homes and people you pass by.
You can use these tips not only when traveling by car but also when you
travel by boat, train, bus, or airplane.
If you want to protect your loved ones when they’re traveling without you,
use long-distance Reiki techniques (see Chapter 15).
Cleaning and Clearing Out Clutter
You may sense negative energy as “bad vibes,” which you may feel in a room
where someone has been sick with the flu or a bedroom from a broken mar-
riage. Perhaps you have moved into an apartment and feel some negative
energy from the previous occupants. Whatever the case, use these steps to
cleanse your living area or workspace:
265
Chapter 18: Ten Uses for Reiki in Everyday Situations

1. Clear out clutter and throw away garbage.
I don’t need to tell you that waste has negative energy that needs to be
removed. Clutter gives a clogging effect, so do what you can to eliminate
or manage it.
2. Remove the grime.
Reiki can’t take the place of elbow grease! If your home needs to be
cleaned, then start scrubbing.
3. Open the windows and let in the sunlight.
Fresh air and bright light have a way of energizing and refreshing a space
or item that needs cleansing.
4. Send Reiki into the middle of the room, the four walls, the ceiling, and
the floor.
Use the Power symbol (see Chapter 8) and any others you feel drawn to.
You can use the same techniques you would use to prepare a room for a
Reiki session (see Chapter 13).
Some people send Reiki into every corner of the room. Use your ability to
sense energy or imagine energy and send Reiki repeatedly until the room
feels cleaner.
You can use Reiki along with other energy-clearing techniques such as sound
(drums or clapping, for example) or smoke from sacred herbs (such as sage).
You may have a special crystal to use to bring in positive energy as well (see
Chapter 12). Keep in mind the three i’s of Reiki: Set your intention to clear the
energy; use your intuition to sense when the energy has been cleared; come
from a place of integrity in your use of the room.
Another way to change the energy in a room is to use Feng Shui (check out
Feng Shui For Dummies, by David Daniel Kennedy, published by Wiley).
Protecting Loved Ones
You can send Reiki to people in special situations. For example, use the dis-
tant Reiki technique (see Chapter 15) to send Reiki to your child on his first
day of school or college or to a parent undergoing a medical test or opera-
tion. If your friend is moving, you can send Reiki to help her.
If you have children, you may want to trace or imagine a Power symbol (see
Chapter 8) surrounding them as they leave for school. You can also do this to
a spouse who leaves for work or pets who go outside.
266
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Sending Reiki or giving Reiki to a loved one is a beautiful way to say “I ask the
universe to give you the best in this situation.” The outcome is then out of
your hands, and it’s time to practice the Reiki Principle “do not worry” (see
Chapter 4 for info about the Reiki Principles).
Shielding Your Home
When you leave your home for work or vacation, you can send it the energy
from the Power symbol (see Chapter 8) or any other Reiki symbol you feel
drawn to use. However, keep in mind that using Reiki doesn’t remove from you
the responsibility of locking all your doors and windows, blowing out all your
candles, turning off all appliances, and taking any other sensible precautions.
When I send Reiki as I leave home, it’s as if I’m telling the house and any
beings inside it that I love them and will be back soon! I feel that I can rest
assured that Reiki will protect the home from danger.
Of course, you can use Reiki for protection when you’re home also. If you find
yourself in a dangerous situation when you’re in the house, by all means send
Reiki immediately while also taking the steps to remedy the situation (such
as getting a fire extinguisher or calling 911).

Ten Uses for Reiki as a Tool 
for Personal Growth
In This Chapter
 Using meditation and journaling
 Relying on the Reiki Principles, affirmations, and intuition
 Making your intentions known
 Approaching life with integrity
M
ikao Usui first designed Reiki to be used for spiritual growth, by using
the tools of meditation, becoming attuned to energy, and practicing
the Reiki Principles. Western Reiki has added to the Reiki toolbox with an
emphasis on self-Reiki, journaling, and setting intentions and affirmations.
In this chapter, I list ten different ways to use Reiki for your personal growth.
Personal growth is a lifelong process. I personally experience spiritual growth
as an endless cycle of
 Receiving inspiration: I get new thoughts and ideas when out in nature,
meditating, performing self-Reiki, journaling, or talking with someone
else. Or I may get the idea from a book or lecture.
 Knowing my truth with intuition: By this, I mean becoming aware and
conscious of what is the right action to take. While reading a book, I may
get a moment of clarity about some issue in my life.
 Acting upon inspiration and intuition: I make it my intention to change.
I take action to change something in my lifestyle.
 Coming up against blocks within myself or others: These blocks can
appear as the proverbial brick wall, a stubborn habit, or perhaps as an
illness. Sometimes it is another person who is blocking me; in that case,
I can use this person’s actions as a mirror to see what is inside of me.
 Working though blocks: I use Reiki and meditation to work through
unresolved issues and blocks and continue receiving inspiration to keep
on the spiritual journey.

You’re never alone in this process of growth as spiritual guidance comes in
the guise of teachers, therapists, and other helpers. Don’t forget that many
other spiritual seekers also journey on this path!
Receiving Healing with Reiki
Making the time and effort to receive Reiki is half the battle! Whether you are
new to Reiki or have been practicing Reiki for decades, let yourself experi-
ence the beautiful healing power of a Reiki session. To decide where to go to
receive Reiki, check out Chapter 5. Or make the time for a self-Reiki session, if
you’ve already studied Reiki. Relaxation comes as deep sighs of relief or shift-
ing of the body as the Reiki energy dissolves blocks within our bodies and
beyond (see Chapter 2 for a description of the levels of energy in the body).
I personally experience Reiki as kind of an enhanced meditation, where for
the duration of the session, I won’t be bothered by telephones ringing or
other requests for my attention. During this special time, I can relax into the
table and let go completely. I have experienced healing on the table in the
form of memories coming up and spontaneously resolving. For example, I
have remembered that someone “did me wrong” and then was spontaneously
able to forgive the person. Don’t worry if tears flow or you have a coughing
fit. These reactions are part of the release of internal energy blocks.
As a practitioner, I notice that people come off the Reiki table with a fresh
look in their eyes, and sometimes they look many years younger!
At the very least, a Reiki session will lift some of your stress, and you’ll often
receive inspirational messages that tell you just what you need to hear!
Going Inward with Meditation
Meditation and Reiki go hand in hand. You use meditation in Reiki classes
and before Reiki sessions. You may meditate on your own or with a group of
people at a Reiki share (see Chapter 14). Meditation aids in personal growth
by allowing you to do the following:
 Quiet your mind: Meditation gives relief from the endless cycle of
thought after thought after thought.
 Relax: Relief from endless thinking brings a peaceful feeling. You can
drift into a more blissful state of serenity.
270
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Become conscious: When the mind is quiet, it’s easier to focus on the
present moment — the now.
 Feel your energy flow: During meditation, you’re more likely to sense
the energy within and around your body.
 Connect with spirit: Getting quiet allows you to sense the spiritual
energy within and around you.
Meditation provides a sacred space to become your true self. Read more
about Reiki meditation in Chapter 9.
Honoring the Reiki Principles
Mikao Usui originally intended that the Reiki Principles (which I discuss in
Chapter 4) be recited daily as part of a program of spiritual growth. You
might see the principles as a gentle reminder toward right living. The begin-
ning phrase, “just for today,” points out the importance of focusing on the
present moment:
Just for today,
Don’t get angry
Don’t worry
Be grateful
Be honest in your work
Be kind to yourself and others.
You can’t go wrong studying these profound principles that have as much
meaning today as when they were first written in the early 1900s in Japan.
Getting Attuned to Reiki
Attunement in Reiki terms means initiation, and a Reiki teacher is the one who
carries out an attunement (see Chapter 7). An essential feature of any Reiki
class is receiving the attunement, which distinguishes Reiki from other forms
of energy work. The Reiki Master prepares the way for attunements by creat-
ing a sacred space and taking you through a meditation. The attunement
itself takes just minutes.
One difference between the different Reiki levels is that you receive different
symbols during the attunement process. With each advancement in Reiki
level (1st degree, 2nd degree, and masters), you are attuned to a higher level
of energy.
271
Chapter 19: Ten Uses for Reiki as a Tool for Personal Growth

The Reiki symbols are representations of the Reiki energy that is transmitted
to you during the attunement process. In other words, you receive the energy
of the different symbols (see Chapter 8 for information about Reiki symbols).
Receiving a Reiki attunement opens the path so your personal energy can
vibrate at a higher level. The differences in how you feel before and after an
attunement may be either subtle or obvious, but you can bet they’ll be life
changing.
Keeping a Journal
Writing is a wonderful way to gather your thoughts. You may already have a
journal or other place to keep a record of your spiritual journey. Many folks
record their dreams, inspirations, and personal goals.
Some Reiki teachers ask all of their students to keep a journal during and
after the attunement process. Here are some of the things you can keep in a
Reiki journal:
 Class notes while studying Reiki
 Inspirational messages received during meditation or attunements
 Feelings, sensations, or ideas that come up while receiving a Reiki 
session
 Experiences of your own and your client while giving a Reiki session
 Free writing or journaling (while writing whatever comes to your head,
you may find answers to long-standing problems)
Don’t edit. Don’t judge yourself. A journal is a learning tool to be cherished,
not a place for criticism.
Empowering Your Affirmations 
with Reiki
Thoughts create reality. It’s that simple. If you don’t believe me, just carefully
observe your thoughts and see how they affect what happens in your life.
An affirmation is a type of positive thought that is a confirmation or declaration.
272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

A positive thought leads you to follow your dreams. A negative thought leads
to low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, or anger. It’s pretty much a no-brainer
to decide which type of thought leads to a life of serenity and happiness!
One of the best ways to counteract negative thinking is to give a boost to pos-
itive thoughts, or empower your affirmations. This follows the idea that when
there is darkness, don’t try to fight it; just turn on the light!
To find your own personal affirmations, use your journals, meditation, or
friends to come up with ideas.
Affirmations can be the opposite of the negative thoughts that run through
and create havoc in your life. Here are some examples:
I am worthy.
I am worthy of health.
I am worthy of love.
Affirmations can also be expressions of your dreams and desires:
The world is full of peace and love.
I cherish my new home.
I am connected to God.
Using affirmations is fun and effective. Take these steps to empower your
affirmations:
1. Choose an affirmation.
You might want to write down a few and choose the one that’s most sig-
nificant right now.
2. Write down the affirmation.
Perhaps use a special card, piece of paper, or colored ink.
3. Say the affirmation daily out loud.
Repeating the affirmation gives it more power.
4. For a week or longer, give Reiki to the piece of paper on which you’ve
written the affirmation.
If you haven’t yet studied Reiki, just imagine white light going to the
affirmation.
273
Chapter 19: Ten Uses for Reiki as a Tool for Personal Growth

To add more energy to your affirmation, try the following:
 Use the Reiki symbols to add extra energy to your affirmation.
 Visualize the affirmation in your mind. Envision yourself feeling or being
the affirmation.
 Share your affirmation or goal with another Reiki practitioner. You can
send Reiki to each other’s affirmation!
 Take the paper on which you’ve written your affirmation and embellish
it with pictures, stickers or glitter.
You can manifest your dreams, goals, and intentions by using the same meth-
ods as outlined for affirmations. Write down the goal, such as “I am a success-
ful Reiki practitioner,” and send it Reiki. Empowering your affirmations is
related to two other Reiki practices: manifesting with Reiki (see Chapter 1)
and Reiki mental technique (see Chapter 16).
Check out the section “Setting Your Intentions,” later in the chapter, to read
more about the power of being conscious of your goals and motives.
Giving Reiki to Others
Charity and goodwill are the cornerstones of most religious and spiritual
practices. The act of helping others is essential to maintain good spirits. The
ways to help others with Reiki are many:
 Give a Reiki session to your relative or friend.
 Join a Reiki share (see Chapter 14) and give Reiki to people in the 
community.
 Send distant Reiki to friends and family who request Reiki (see Chapter 15).
 Send distant Reiki to situations like countries at war or to people in hos-
pitals or politicians.
Don’t forget that you can also share Reiki with your pets and send distant
Reiki to animals in zoos or oceans.
Because the Reiki energy is going through you as you send it out, you also get
a benefit when you give Reiki!
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Setting Your Intentions
Your intention, which is a goal or a plan, is considered to be crucial in Reiki.
Set your goal before receiving or giving a Reiki session. The Reiki energy
respects your intention (see Chapter 9 for a discussion of prayer and inten-
tion in Reiki). You’ll really see results when you start setting intentions in
other areas of your life. Here are some examples:
 When you wake up, you can intend to have a great day!
 Before phoning someone, you can intend for the conversation to go
smoothly.
 Before stepping to the podium, intend to give a great speech.
Setting an intention is saying the following things to the universe:
 You’re available for a great day.
 You’re ready for a great conversation with your mother.
 You’re prepared to speak words of wisdom.
The universe can then step up to the plate to make your goals come true.
Set your intentions for a day filled with abundance, love, prosperity, and
health. See the section “Empowering Your Affirmations with Reiki,” earlier in
this chapter, to really give a boost to your positive thoughts.
Letting Your Intuition Blossom
Call it a gut feeling or a sixth sense, but most people experience intuition as
knowing something at a deep subconscious level. Intuition means that you
just know something, even if you don’t have the evidence for it. Most people
have had the experience of calling someone who says, “How funny that you
called. I was just thinking of you!” Or perhaps you’ve experienced knowing
who was calling before you even picked up the phone!
Intuitive information seems to come out of the blue! Many famous discoveries
have been made while someone was in the shower or taking a walk! While the
brain is resting from its usual thinking process, inspiration or intuition has a
better chance to come through.
275
Chapter 19: Ten Uses for Reiki as a Tool for Personal Growth

Just having inspirational or intuitive ideas isn’t enough. For these ideas to
have any value in your life, you must put them into effect. Sometimes follow-
ing inspiration or intuition is more difficult than it seems. A message that
says “quit your job” or “leave this relationship” isn’t so easy to carry out! The
best thing to do is to follow up on your message by meditating regularly and
perhaps seeking spiritual guidance.
You may find that your intuition increases after you start using Reiki. Intuition
in a Reiki session tells you where to place your hands and when a session is
complete. Intuition in life can guide you in so many ways — if only you’re ready
to listen.
Living with Integrity
Integrity means honesty and uprightness. Feeling good in your own skin is
much easier if you’re not carrying guilt about your behavior.
 When you live with integrity, you feel clean and wholesome.
 When you act with integrity, you have nothing to hide.
Integrity helps to keep your Reiki practice clean. You’ll feel good to know
you’re doing your best job, practicing honestly, using the highest level of
ethics, and respecting yourselves and others.
Applying the concept of integrity to your life as a whole is a tall order, but it’s
also beautifully cleansing! For some ideas on how to use integrity with Reiki,
see Chapter 13 and also the appendix, which lists the Code of Ethics of the
International Association of Reiki Professionals.

Chapter 20
Ten Common Myths about Reiki
In This Chapter
 Revealing the truth about Mikao Usui
 Setting the facts straight about Reiki results and payment
 Clarifying the role of Reiki in healing and curing disease
D
ifferent people have taken Reiki, a universal energy available to anyone,
and described it in their own unique way.
Some Reiki myths are stories about Reiki’s history that have been found to be
untrue. Hawayo Takata, who courageously brought Reiki to the West, told
convincing stories about the origins of Reiki that are now known to be false.
Most likely, she invented these tall tales based on a good intention: to help
Reiki spread in a Christian world that had anti-Japanese sentiment (during
the World War II era). As more Reiki researchers uncover the truth of Mikao
Usui and the origins of Reiki in Japan, the true history of Reiki is unfolding.
But if you studied Reiki more than a couple of years ago, you may have heard
some moving but ultimately false stories about Mikao Usui. Make sure to
update yourself on the more accurate history of Reiki that is now available
(see Chapter 3).
Other Reiki falsehoods that are still confusing within the Reiki community
include concern over who can benefit from Reiki, which Reiki branch is the
best, the relationship of Reiki and money, and the relationship of Reiki and
medicine. In this chapter, I expose common Reiki myths and set out to
debunk them one by one.

Mikao Usui Was a Christian Minister
Truth: Mikao Usui was a Buddhist, not a Christian.
This tall tale from Hawayo Takata included the information that Usui was a
Christian minister who had studied in a Western university. Versions of this
myth tell how often Usui preached or even said that Usui was trying to dis-
cover the healing powers of Jesus.
Mikao Usui was a lay Buddhist priest (lay priests could remain at home with
their families), but Usui is well known to have read Christian texts alongside
his Buddhist texts.
The religions of Buddhism and Shintoism coexist in Japan, and Usui probably
incorporated both of these in his personal spiritual beliefs and Reiki teach-
ings. This doesn’t make Reiki a religion (see the section “Reiki Is a Religion,”
later in the chapter).
Dr. Mikao Usui Studied at the 
University of Chicago
Truth: Mikao Usui was a learned man, but he didn’t study formally at any 
university.
Part of the Takata myth was that Usui had studied at the University of
Chicago in the United States and Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan. We
now know this to be untrue, though Mikao Usui was a learned man through
his personal studies.
Though Hawayo Takata called him Dr. Usui, Mikao Usui was not a physician.
Takata may have used the “Dr.” as a Western interpretation for “Sensai,” as he
was called in Japan. Sensai is a title of respect given by a student to a teacher.
278
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You Must Believe in Reiki 
to Benefit from It
Truth: Reiki can help whether you believe in it or not.
Even if you don’t understand how Reiki works or have some skepticism, you
may be surprised to find that Reiki works wonders to bring about relaxation
and calm.
The only time that someone will not benefit from Reiki is when the person
doesn’t want it, whether at a conscious or subconscious level. This situation
does occasionally occur. If someone doesn’t want Reiki, you can’t force the
person to take it at that time. The person may decide he wants Reiki at a later
time.
Note the difference between these two situations:
 Not believing in Reiki: You may be skeptical about Reiki and don’t
believe it really works, but you’re open to giving it a try.
 Not wanting Reiki: You actually resist the energy of Reiki and are not
interested in experiencing it.
This myth was addressed in the first-ever Reiki manual written by Mikao
Usui. Nevertheless, many Reiki practitioners say that you must believe in
Reiki for it to work. You’re probably more open to the miracles of Reiki when
you believe in it. You’re also more likely to come back for a second session or
attribute any improvement in your condition to the Reiki healing.
Many people say “I don’t believe,” because they can’t see Reiki with their
own eyes. But most want to believe and will give Reiki a chance — just in case
it does work!
You Must Pay for Reiki 
for It to Benefit You
Truth: Reiki can benefit you whether you pay for it or not.
Western Reiki has had some controversy over this matter. One of the stories
told by Hawayo Takata (see Chapter 3) was that Mikao Usui came down from
the mountain and came upon a beggar. Usui gave Reiki to the beggar, but
because the beggar didn’t pay for Reiki, he didn’t benefit.
279
Chapter 20: Ten Common Myths about Reiki

Because we now know that the beggar story is untrue, the purpose of the
paying-for-Reiki story has become confused. This tall tale from Takata may
have served the purpose of telling people to always have an “energy
exchange” for their work. The concept is that unless you pay for something,
it doesn’t have value.
Hawayo Takata charged 10,000 American dollars for a Reiki mastership, pre-
sumably as a way to give great value to the Reiki teachings. This practice of
charging $10,000 to study for a Reiki Master continued with Takata’s stu-
dents. Most Reiki teachers today do not charge such a high fee. As more Reiki
Masters have lowered their fees, more people are studying Reiki, and it con-
tinues to spread and help more people.
A balance must be reached in the subject of money and Reiki. Seeing money
as an exchange of value, the recipients of Reiki or Reiki student must pay
what they feel is a fair amount for what you have received. And likewise, the
Reiki practitioner must also feel that he is receiving a fair amount for the serv-
ices rendered.
Do what is comfortable for you. If you can’t afford to pay for Reiki at certain
locations, find a practitioner, Reiki circle, or teacher that you can work with.
You Should Not Charge for Reiki
Truth: You must earn a living somehow.
This statement is the opposite of the myth that says “You must pay for Reiki
for it to benefit you.” Clearly there is some confusion about money in the
Reiki community!
Any statement that has a should carries a red flag. Who is “shoulding” you? 
A group of people within the larger Reiki community has a strong belief that
spiritual healing and teachings be freely given. In my opinion, this belief
stems from a deeper belief that money is evil.
Each Reiki practitioner or teacher must do what is right for him or her.
Because the study and practice of Reiki (see Chapter 7) cost money, you may
very well want to get reimbursed for your efforts. Don’t forget that your time
is also an expense.
280
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The decision about whether to charge and how much you charge for your
time performing or teaching Reiki is up to you. See Chapter 17 for more on
the business of Reiki.
Each practitioner finds his own truth about money. Some healers treat a cer-
tain number of clients at their normal fees and then set a portion of that
income or their time each week to treat or teach at a reduced cost or no cost
for people with fewer financial resources.
There Is Only One Right Form or 
School of Reiki
Truth: Different forms or schools of Reiki can all provide healing and a link to
Mikao Usui’s original teachings.
Read about different Reiki branches or schools of Reiki and you could get a
massive headache. So many branches and so many claims can lead to confu-
sion when they all state that they are the original Reiki or most powerful
Reiki. Any claim to be the only, the best, or the original form of Reiki is false. I
think that even if Mikao Usui were alive today he would have many forms of
teaching, all of which are valid!
Reiki has diverged since its discovery by Mikao Usui. All teachers who have
passed on Reiki have in some way (some more and some less) put their
stamp on the teachings. Teachers add a little here and remove a little there.
Before you know it, Reiki is practiced differently by various groups. I cover
the different branches of Reiki in Chapter 3.
Most Reiki organizations strive to include all branches of Reiki for a sense of
cohesiveness for the future of Reiki.
Ultimately, the choice of which of the many schools of Reiki you work with as
a client, student, or practitioner rests upon which types of Reiki are practiced
in your geographic area. If you have a choice of different types of Reiki, I sug-
gest speaking to and trying out different forms of Reiki and seeing which one
fits. Like Cinderella’s prince carrying the glass slipper, you can find the right
match!
281
Chapter 20: Ten Common Myths about Reiki

Reiki Is a Religion
Truth: Reiki is a spiritual energy system, not a religion.
Religion and spirituality are two different things. Organized religions, such as
Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism, each have a set of
agreed-upon texts, prayers, and practices that individuals follow. Within any
religion, spirituality flourishes by the group prayer, meditation, and connec-
tion with a higher source.
Spirituality can also exist without an organized or formal religion. For exam-
ple, you may feel most spiritual in a forest or on a beach, which is not bound
to any particular religion.
Although Reiki is influenced by its origins in Japan and the religions of Japan,
Buddhism and Shintoism, Reiki itself is not a religion.
Reiki can be practiced and received by people of any religion.
You Know How Reiki Will Heal You
Truth: Healing takes many forms.
When going for healing, people have both reasonable and unreasonable
expectations. In the West, most people want a quick fix; they want to go to a
Reiki practitioner and walk out cured after one session. But it is unreasonable
to expect all your problems to disappear forever after one Reiki session! A
more reasonable approach is to be open to the experience and let go of your
expectations. It is also reasonable to expect to feel better from Reiki, to feel
relaxed, and to want to experience that relaxing feeling again. If you adopt
that attitude, you’re more likely to be impressed with the results.
Do clients heal in one session? Most likely not. Every situation is unique, and
some individuals may experience a miraculous change right away. Most folks
experience healing like the peeling of an onion. When one layer is peeled, the
next layer is revealed. Reiki allows you to uncover the layers to be healed.
If you’re uncomfortable after a Reiki session or with a particular healer, you
may want to speak with the Reiki practitioner or try someone else next time.
You deserve to find a practitioner with whom you are comfortable (see
Chapter 5).
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Reiki Can Cure Anything
Truth: Reiki can help almost anything, but it doesn’t necessarily lead to a
cure.
What is meant by the word cure? Generally, cure means to restore health or
remove a disease. A cure can be temporary, as in the transient removal of
pain, or it can be permanent, as in the disappearance of a tumor. Can I guar-
antee that Reiki will remove your tumor? Absolutely not! (See the next sec-
tion, “Reiki Can Be Used Instead of Medicine.”)
Reiki, however, may offer healing properties that contribute to a cure. Reiki
helps you to heal by relaxing you, allowing your own internal healing system
to function. Stories abound about the wonders of Reiki helping people over-
come every type of ailment. Yet there is no guarantee that a treatment that
“cures” one person will also “cure” another.
Healers know that healing doesn’t necessarily mean restoring health or feel-
ing better. In some cases, people get sicker before they get well. In other
cases, healing means the death of the patient who is in the late or end stages
of illness.
All humans are going to die. In Reiki circles, death is considered to be a tran-
sition to the “other side.”
If Reiki were a cure-all, then people who practice Reiki would never die!
Consider that Mikao Usui, the founder of Reiki, died at age 62 of a stroke. 
In fact, Reiki can be used to help people who are in end-of-life situations 
(see Chapter 16) by providing soothing relaxation.
Reiki Can Be Used Instead of Medicine
Truth: Reiki should be used alongside medicine.
Reiki is considered to be a complementary treatment. If you have a serious
illness, Reiki plus medical treatment provides the best of both worlds —
which you deserve. If you rely on Reiki alone, you might lose valuable time
when you could be saving your life with conventional treatment. With med-
ical treatment alone, you might lose the added benefit of Reiki to boost the
power of your medicines and your internal healing system.
283
Chapter 20: Ten Common Myths about Reiki

I personally believe in respecting the integrity of the person who is ill. If
someone doesn’t want to use conventional medicine, I wouldn’t force the
person to do so. However, as a Reiki practitioner, I must be honest about
what Reiki can and can’t do.
If you postpone life-saving conventional medical treatment while pursuing
the possibility of a cure through Reiki, you might contribute to a person’s
death. Always advise a Reiki client to seek and follow medical diagnosis and
treatment.
In Chapter 16 I describe different ways of using Reiki along with medical care.
Here are ways to use Reiki alongside medicine:
 Have Reiki sessions before and after surgery or medical procedures.
 Use Reiki on your medicine before you take it (see Chapter 18).
 Send distant Reiki to a relative or friend or even yourself for the time of
surgery (see Chapter 15).
 Send Reiki to your healthcare practitioners so they’re in the best frame
of mind to help you.
Be open to healing in whatever way you can!

Ten Non-traditional Reiki Symbols
In This Chapter
 Tibetan Reiki symbols
 Karuna Reiki symbols
 A new Reiki symbol
L
ike most people, you are probably curious about what the different Reiki
symbols look like. In this chapter, I present the images of ten additional
symbols that do not directly derive from Mikao Usui’s teachings. Feast your
eyes on these representations, some of which may be familiar to you from
other sources. If you want to delve further into their use, find a Reiki teacher
who can initiate (give attunements) to these symbols.
Anyone can imagine or channel a symbol. A symbol may appear to you
during meditation, while getting an attunement (see Chapter 7), or while
giving or getting a Reiki session.
Check out Chapter 8 for information about the traditional Reiki symbols.
Mikao Usui designated four traditional different symbols: Cho Ku Rei 
(Power symbol), Sei Hei Ki (Emotional symbol), Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen
(Distance symbol), and Dai Ko Myo (Master symbol). Some of these symbols
listed in this chapter are taught alongside traditional Usui Reiki training in
some Reiki branches. Other symbols are taught in one of the non-Usui Reiki
branches (see the appendix).

Double Cho Ku Rei
The symbols with spirals, like the Cho Ku Rei, can be drawn in two direc-
tions. The Cho Ku Rei is sometimes used in the original counter-clockwise
position alongside the Cho Ku Rei in the reverse position or clockwise 
(Figure 21-1). You may want to experiment with reversed non-traditional Dai
Ko Myo as well.
The double Cho Ku Rei is called Kriya in Karuna Reiki (a non-Usui branch of
Reiki; see the appendix). This symbol brings “thought into form” and is fre-
quently used for manifesting. You can draw or imagine the double Cho Ku Rei
on top of the goals you want to manifest. This is a strong energy that, like the
single Cho Ku Rei, is connected to the earth.
Figure 21-1:
The double
Cho Ku Rei.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Tibetan Dai Ko Myo
Here are two different versions of Dai Ko Myo (see Figure 21-2) that are
called Tibetan or non-traditional Dai Ko Myo. Another name for these sym-
bols is Dumo. I was initiated into each of these versions by different teach-
ers, so I provide them here. The Usui Dai Ko Myo (see Chapter 8) is the
original and traditional symbol. I find I like these symbols more than the
traditional Dai Ko Myo.
Use these symbols in exactly the same way you would use the Usui Dai Ko
Myo: during a Reiki treatment or during meditation. In some schools of Reiki,
these symbols are used alongside or rather than the Usui Dai Ko Myo, which
you find out about in Chapter 8.

Chapter 21: Ten Non-traditional Reiki Symbols

Tibetan Fire Serpent
Some Reiki branches use the Tibetan Fire Serpent (see Figure 21-3) before the
attunement process and before a healing session. The snakelike coils repre-
sent the Kundalini energy, which is visualized as coiled energy at the base of
the spine that surges upward through the body as the coils unwind. The surg-
ing energy of the Fire Serpent cleanses and joins the chakras. (See Chapter 2
for more about chakras.)

Raku
Certain Reiki branches use Raku, a Tibetan symbol (see Figure 21-4), to close
the connection between teacher and student after attunements. Some people
use it at the end of a session to close the energy between practitioner and
healer. Similar to the lightning stroke used in Jakikiri Joka Ho (see Chapter
12), it focuses and grounds (brings into the earth) energy. This symbol is also
incorporated into the Tibetan Dai Ko Myo (Tibetan Master symbol) and in an
elongated form in the Tibetan Fire Serpent.
Figure 21-4:
Raku.

Chapter 21: Ten Non-traditional Reiki Symbols

Zonar
The Zonar symbol (see Figure 21-5) is the letter Z along with an infinity
symbol that is drawn three times. This symbol is thought to work across time
and space, similarly to the Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen (see Chapter 8). Zonar means
infinity or eternity and can be used to heal issues and traumas from the past.
Zonar, Halu, and Harth are the first three symbols used in non-Usui Reiki
branches: Karuna Reiki, Karuna-Ki Reiki, and Tera Mai Reiki. See the appendix
for references on these branches.

Zonar.

Harth
This symbol combines a pyramid and a cross (see Figure 21-6). Harth is the
symbol for the heart and represents infinite love and compassion and means
love, truth, beauty, harmony, and balance. This symbol can be used to heal
relationships and addictions.
Figure 21-6:
Harth.
291
Chapter 21: Ten Non-traditional Reiki Symbols

Halu
The Halu (hay-loo) symbol (see Figure 21-7), an amplification of Zonar, has a Z
and infinity sign embedded within it and also has a pyramid added to the top.
Similar to the Usui symbol Sei Hei Ki, Halu is used for balance and love. Halu
brings about deep healing and dissolves negativity.
Figure 21-7:
Halu.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Antakharana
Various branches of Reiki use the Antakharana symbol (see Figure 21-8) as a
tool for meditation and healing. The symbol has a three-dimensional aspect
and was used in Chinese and Tibetan meditation practices.
There are several variations of the Antakharana symbol. If you stare at the
symbol, you can see that three 7s are attached. I do not personally use this
symbol, but it is supposed to work with the aura and to connect to the higher
self. You can paste a copy of the symbol under a massage table or on your
wall to enhance the effects of Reiki.
Figure 21-8:
Antakharana.

Chapter 21: Ten Non-traditional Reiki Symbols

Om
Om is a Sanskrit symbol (see Figure 21-9) used in different Eastern spiritual
practices, including yoga. Om represents the sound of the universe and is fre-
quently chanted. It sounds like “ah-oh-mm” or “aum.” Some Reiki branches,
including Karuna Reiki, use this symbol. Listening to or chanting the sound
“om” helps to connect spiritually. One of my Reiki masters played om chant-
ing music during the attunement process, and I’ve listened to an om chanting
tape during some of the writing of this book.
Shoshana
To inspire you to be open to your intuition, I present here a symbol (see
Figure 21-10) that I received intuitively one day while walking at the beach. I
drew it in the sand with my fingers. Although this symbol came to me without
an initial name, I sense that the name “Shoshana” fits it because it has “Sh”
sounding curves at its beginning and end. I sense movement in this symbol: a
spinning of the middle bar to anchor it or a twirling of the “S” shapes round
and round. I have used Shoshana, which removes energy blocks in the body,
for myself and others. The word “Shoshana” means lily or flower in Hebrew.

absolutely comprehensive, it will absolutely get you what you need or point
you in the right direction. If I did provide every Reiki resource, then this book

International Association of Reiki
Professionals (IARP) Codes of Ethics
When preparing to teach others or practice Reiki on others, before you do
anything else, you need to consider their views and take them to heart.
That’s why codes of ethics are listed first in this appendix. Several codes
exist, but the IARP ethics codes for both practitioners and teachers are par-
ticularly useful and complete. To join the IARP or find out more about them,
go to www.iarp.org or check out the contact information elsewhere in this
appendix.

IARP Code of Ethics for Reiki Practitioners:
1. Abide by a vow of confidentiality. Any information that is discussed
within the context of a Reiki session is confidential between the client
and the Practitioner.
2. Provide a safe and comfortable area for client sessions and work to pro-
vide an empowering and supportive environment for clients.
3. Always treat clients with the utmost respect and honor.
4. Provide a brief oral or written description of what happens during a ses-
sion and what to expect before a client’s initial session.
5. Be respectful of all other’s Reiki views and paths.
6. Educate clients on the value of Reiki and explain that sessions do not
guarantee a cure, nor are they a substitute for qualified medical or pro-
fessional care. Reiki is one part of an integrated healing or wellness
program.
7. Suggest a consultation or referral to qualified licensed professionals
(medical doctor, social worker, licensed therapist, and so on) when
appropriate.
8. Never diagnose or prescribe. Never suggest that the client change pre-
scribed treatment or interfere with treatment of a licensed healthcare
provider.
9. Never ask clients to disrobe (unless in the context of a licensed mas-
sage therapy session). Be sensitive to the boundary needs of individual
clients. Do not touch the genital area or breasts. Practice hands-off
healing of these areas if treatment is needed.
10. Be actively working on your own healing so as to embody and fully
express the essence of Reiki in everything that you do.
IARP Code of Ethics for Reiki Teachers:
1. Provide a comfortable area for classes and work to provide an empower-
ing and supportive environment for students.
2. Always treat your students with the utmost respect and honor. It is an
honor and a privilege to share Reiki with them.
3. Provide a clear written description of subjects to be taught during each
level of Reiki prior to class and list what the student will be able to do
after taking the class.
4. Be willing to discuss the proportion of time spent on each subject in
class and the amount of practice time available.

5. Be respectful of all other’s Reiki views and paths.
6. Be working to create harmony and friendly cooperation between Reiki
Practitioners and Masters in the community.
7. Act as a beacon within Reiki and in your community by doing the best
job possible.
8. Work to empower your students to heal themselves and to encourage
and assist them in the development of their work with Reiki or their
Reiki practices.
9. Be sensitive to the boundary needs of individual students.
10. Be actively working on your own healing so as to embody and fully
express the essence of Reiki in everything that you do.
Reiki Organizations
Many countries now have their own Reiki organizations. In theory, these
organizations welcome and support all Reiki branches and are thus nonde-
nominational. They are set up to support Reiki practitioners overall or in
certain locations. Due to the “maverick” nature of Reiki, not all Reiki practi-
tioners join these organizations. Use these as a starting point to find accu-
rate information about Reiki where you live. Also check out the later section
on “Reiki Branches.”

Reiki Branches
Reiki in the form that we know it originated with Mikao Usui. After that, each
Reiki Master either tried to follow his understanding of Usui Reiki or designed
his own version. See the information on Reiki branches in Chapter 3 to give you
an idea how these different branches link back to Mikao Usui. Here, I provide
you with Web sites for various Reiki branches. Use this list to research different
branches, find out more about any particular teacher you are considering (if
you know her Reiki branch), and find lists of teachers, in some cases.
Japanese Usui Reiki branches
Here are the major branches of Reiki in Japan that I am aware of and Web site
information for them if available. The lineage for each branch starts with
Mikao Usui and continues to the current founder or teacher of that branch.
 Gendai Reiki Ho. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Kanichi Taketomi, Kimiko
Koyama, Hiroshi Doi. Founder: Hiroshi Doi. Web site www.geocities.
jp/g_reiki or www.gendai.net (both in Japanese)
 Jikiden Reiki. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Chiyoko Yamaguchi,
Tadao Yamaguchi. Founders: Chiyoko Yamaguchi and Tadao Yamaguchi.
Web site http://jikidenreiki.org/
 Komyo Reiki Kai. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Chiyoko
Yamaguchi, Hyakuten Inamoto. Founder: Hyakuten Inamoto. Web site
www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~Reiki (in Japanese)
 Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Juzaburo Ushida,
Kanichi Taketomi, Yoshiharu Watanabe, Toyoichi Wanami, Kimiko
Koyama, Masataki Kondo. Founder: Mikao Usui. This organization seeks
to preserve Mikao Usui’s teachings, but unfortunately is restrictive in
terms of both its membership and the information it gives out.
 Usui Reiki Ryoho. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Kanichi Taketomi, Kimiko
Koyama, Hiroshi Doi. Founder: Hiroshi Doi. See the Gendai Reiki Ho info
earlier in this list.

Appendix: Great Reiki Resources

Japanese-style Usui Reiki
The following two branches were taught by Japanese Reiki practitioners to
Western students, who are the founders of these branches:
 Usui-Teate. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Suzuki san, Chris Marsh. Founder: Chris
Marsh. Also called “Method to Achieve Personal Perfection.” Web site
www.usuireiki.fsnet.co.uk
 Usui-Do. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Toshishiro Eguchi, Yuji Onuki, Dave King.
Founders: Dave King and Melissa Riggall, who presented this system
based on Eguchi’s work. Web site www.usui-do.org
Western Usui Reiki branches
The main branches of Western Reiki all derive from Hawayo Takata:
 The Radiance Technique (Authentic Reiki). Lineage: Mikao Usui Chujiro
Hayashi, Hawayo Takata, Barbara Weber Ray. Founder: Barbara Weber
Ray, who claims that she is the sole successor to Hawayo Takata. Web
site www.trtia.org
 Usui Shiki Ryoho. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Hawayo Takata.
The Reiki Alliance is a group that formed after Hawayo Takata died. Both
the Reiki Alliance and Phyllis Lei Furamoto (who is Hawayo Takata’s
granddaughter) claim that Furamoto is the true successor to Hawayo
Takata. Many independent Reiki Masters (including myself) have studied
under this system but are not necessarily part of the Reiki Alliance.
 Usui/Tibetan Reiki. Lineage: Mikao Usui, Chujiro Hayashi, Hawayo
Takata, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, Carrell Ann Farmer, Leah Smith, William
Lee Rand. Founder: William Lee Rand (United States). This is my lineage
for my Reiki Master training with one of William Rand’s students, Kathie
Lipinski. Web site www.reiki.org

Glossary
Reiki terminology can be a bit confusing and even challenging, so to ease you
through some of the more confusing words and terms, I’ve put together this
glossary. Think of it as a sort of short and helpful dictionary to help you get a
better handle on the Reiki terms, so you aren’t left scratching your head in
bewilderment.
Note: Any word printed in italic and bold type has its own definition in its
own rightful alphabetical place in this glossary.
acupuncture: An ancient Chinese practice that stimulates tiny points of
energy along the meridians.
Advanced Reiki Training (ART): Part of the third-degree Reiki training that is
separated into a separate class by some Reiki branches. You learn the Master
symbol, Dai Ko Myo, and techniques for healing, but not the methods for
teaching.
Antakharana: A nontraditional Reiki symbol used by some branches of Reiki
(especially Usui/Tibetan branches) as a tool for meditation and healing.
attunement: Initiation process that confers upon the recipient the ability to
channel Reiki energy. Attunements are performed by a Reiki Master during
Reiki training. After you receive a Reiki attunement, you have a lifelong con-
nection to the Reiki energy. Further attunements enhance the levels of
energy.
aura: A layer of energy fields around all living beings. The aura is an egg- or
oval-shaped energy structure that can go out many feet from the body and be
different colors, depending on the person and the situation. Some people can
see the aura, and you develop the ability to sense the aura during the prac-
tice of Reiki. 
beaming: The process of sending Reiki when you are in the same room but
standing away from the recipient. 
Byosen Reikan Ho: A Japanese technique for scanning the body with the
hands to detect regions that are ill or in need of Reiki healing.

chakra: An Indian Sanskrit word that means spinning wheel of energy, vortex,
or energy center. The energy centers that convert universal life force energy
to a form easily used by the body are called chakras. There are seven main
chakras that start at the root and move up to the crown.
channel: Someone who is able to let the Reiki energy flow through them. To
channel Reiki, a practitioner takes in Reiki energy for the purpose of letting it
emanate from her hands to the Reiki recipient. A channel is like a tube or con-
duit through which the Reiki energy flows.
channeling: The process of letting Reiki energy flow through you. While the
energy passes through, you get to feel the flow of Reiki too.
chi: Chinese word for energy, sometimes spelled qi. This is the same as
Japanese ki.
Cho Ku Rei: First Usui Reiki symbol that means power or focus.
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): This term is applied to
health therapies that can be used in addition to (complementary) or in lieu of
(alternative) conventional medical techniques. Reiki is a complementary
medicine because it works well alongside other medical treatments. Reiki is
not a substitute for conventional medicine. 
crown chakra: An energy center associated with the upper brain, pineal
gland, and issues of spiritual connection. The crown chakra is the seventh
chakra.
crystals: Objects from the earth that have an ordered formation and emit
their own healing energy. Can be used alongside Reiki for healing purposes.
Dai Ko Myo: Fourth Usui Reiki symbol that means mastership or 
empowerment.
Double Cho Ku Rei: Nontraditional Reiki symbol that is also called Kriya.
Two Cho Ku Reis (one in reverse orientation) face each other. 
energy medicine: A branch of complementary and alternative medicine
that treats or diagnoses the body with energy. Reiki is a type of energy 
medicine that treats the body with subtle energy.
first-degree Reiki: Initial Reiki training level that is also called Reiki I or
Shoden. Reiki history, hand positions, and self-Reiki are taught in this class.
308
Reiki For Dummies

Gassho: (1) A Japanese hand position with palms facing each other and fin-
gers pointed upward. This is also called the prayer position when the hands
are placed in front of the chest. Holding your hands in this position can be
used on its own as the basis for a meditation, as a focusing technique before
or after a Reiki session, or to open or close other types of meditation. (2)
When the hands are in prayer position touching and fingers facing upwards,
this is the Gassho hand position. Gassho is also a form of meditation.
Gyosi Ho: A Japanese Reiki method of healing by staring with the eyes.
Halu: Nontraditional symbol used in non-Usui branches of Reiki.
hand positions: Hawayo Takata developed a set of standard hand positions
that was probably based on Chujiro Hayashi’s original hand positions. By
following these positions, you cover the entire body and the meridians with
Reiki energy.
hara: Japanese word for belly or abdomen. Also called tanden. 
Harth: Nontraditional symbol used in non-Usui branches of Reiki.
Hatsurei Ho: Japanese Reiki technique that combines Kenyoku Ho, Joshin
Kokyu Ho, and Seishin Toitsu.
Hayashi, Chujiro: One of Mikao Usui’s original students, Hayashi was born
in 1880, became a medical doctor, and developed a medical approach to Reiki
treatments. He trained Hawayo Takata, who brought Reiki to the West. 
heart chakra: The fourth chakra is associated with the circulatory system,
thymus gland, and issues of love and compassion.
Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen: Third Usui Reiki symbol that means distance (healing
at a distance) or connection.
Hui Yin contraction: An advanced Reiki process in which you hold the
energy in a circuit within the body by squeezing the muscles between the
genitals and rectum and putting the tongue behind the teeth on the roof of
the mouth. Also called the microcosmic orbit.
intention: The goal or hidden purpose behind a thought or action. This is the
most important aspect behind giving a Reiki session.
intuition: An insight or gut feeling that you know is right. Information that
comes from an inner knowing or inspiration.
