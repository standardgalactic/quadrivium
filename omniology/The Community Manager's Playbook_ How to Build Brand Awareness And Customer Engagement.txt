Introduction
The Power and Value of Community
The world is changing. This has always been true, but we feel it more because 
the pace of change continues to accelerate. Advances in technology have 
pushed the pedal to the metal on every aspect of our lives! The Internet, with 
its social networks and mobile technologies, is turning the world into one big 
neighborhood. People can connect with each other instantly and constantly. 
Location is no longer an issue, and connectivity truly has enabled an engaged 
world.
The Business Landscape Has Changed
The business world is no exception. In every industry, technology is bringing down 
the cost of creating products, accessing markets, and building infrastructure. 
This “leveling of the playing field” allows smaller companies to compete and 
new sources of competition to emerge in other parts of the world. 
This fast pace of evolution is our new reality, and companies are scrambling to 
stay ahead of the competition. 
Community Management Drives Competitive 
Advantage
While technology provides a lot of new tools and opportunities, people 
are inherently still the same. If they feel a personal connection to a brand, 
they will be loyal to it. That’s why communities of customers, employees, 
and shareholders are so important. Thriving communities give companies not 
only a competitive advantage, but an adaptability advantage. They do that by 
tending to the real resource: people.
The stakes are higher than ever with the growth of social media. Greater 
access and transparency puts customers in the driver’s seat. Consumers now 
have the power to research companies before making a buying decision and 
broadcast their opinions to the world. Business mistakes can’t be swept under 
the rug with great PR or ad campaigns anymore.

Introduction 
xiv
Fortunately, brands can also benefit from these changes. From open 
communication on social media to responsive customer service, the digital 
age enables companies to connect with the public. With a few clicks of 
the keyboard, companies can access a wealth of data on their customers’ 
reactions, habits, behaviors, needs, and desires. This information is vital to 
staying relevant in a sea of competitors.
Community management (CM) is more critical than ever in helping businesses 
gain customers and integrate themselves into the daily lives of consumers. It’s 
also a huge liability if businesses ignore their customers and the communities 
that surround them. How, you ask? We’ll take a look at an example from 
lululemon’s community success and then failure in Chapter 1.
The Community Manager’s Playbook is designed to teach you how to build a 
community management strategy that creates a loyal customer following and 
strong competitive advantage for years to come.
Community Management Isn’t Just for 
Community Managers
Community managers can build a career based on the information in this 
book. Since this is a rapidly evolving discipline, pushed along by the advances 
in technology I have mentioned, the role and responsibilities tend to shift from 
company to company.
However, there are universal standards for performing well and measuring 
success in managing modern communities. Whether you’re wondering how 
to prioritize multiple communication channels, how to meet business goals or 
tactically execute for success, this book will address these gaps for you. 
This book is also designed to support founders of startups and business leaders 
who want to understand their customers, drive business growth, and create 
value. This is because community managers aren’t always part of the team 
when a company is just getting started, or has been in business with a more 
traditional marketing approach. In either case, key components of community 
management should become embedded in the early company building stage 
as well as at critical growth points where customer and market feedback is 
crucial for success. Companies can benefit greatly from the discovery and 
validation processes taught throughout the book.
In the same vein, stakeholders involved in assessing investments and ROI, from 
C-level executives and business leaders at larger consumer brands to startup 
founders and venture capitalists, should develop an understanding of community 
management and how it should be integrated into an organization. 

Introduction
xv
Finally, the book speaks to hiring managers or human resource personnel 
who require an understanding of the community management role in their 
organizations. Finding the right person to fill the community manager role 
is never an easy task. Even if you rope in that rare person with the perfect 
experience and background, your company may not have the right tools 
or organizational structure to set that CM up for success. This book tells 
managers what expectations to set, how to benchmark performance, and how 
to develop community managers into stellar brand assets.
A Step-by-Step Guide to Learning, Planning, 
and Doing
I’ve read a lot of business books, and I’ve noticed that the best ones actively 
engage their readers in the subject and set them up for success. That’s what 
inspired The Community Manager’s Playbook. I wanted to share the theories, 
strategies, and tactics that I’ve learned over the years in a fun, invigorating way. 
You can use this book in various ways. It covers theories of community 
management, strategic approaches, execution techniques, and useful tools. 
Numerous hands-on exercises will push you to apply what you’ve learned and 
use it in the real world.
Part I: Learning
Part I is meant to level the playing field. New and junior community managers 
can learn the basics, while readers with more experience can review 
foundational knowledge. And hiring and supervising managers can gain a new 
appreciation for the community management discipline. 
This section explains the fundamentals of community management and the 
community manager’s role—what it is, why community is valuable, what CMs 
do every day, and why it is important to your organization.
Chapter 1 defines community management and the value 
• 
of a CM in today’s business world. 
Chapter 2 describes major CM responsibilities and the 
• 
traits needed to succeed.
Chapter 3 details creating a recruitment and hiring  
• 
process tailored to unique business needs.
Chapter 4 expands community management into broader 
• 
business strategy and shows how it unquestionably  
creates value.

Introduction

Part II: Planning
Part II teaches you how to build a strategic framework for community 
management. It explains how to set goals that connect to big-picture business 
objectives, conduct research, define metrics, and map out a plan for success.
Chapter 5 provides a strategic overview of community 
• 
management aligned with business goals.
Chapter 6 dives into the ABCs of strategy—audience, 
• 
brand, and category—with hands-on exercises.
Chapter 7 leads you through using a powerful tool for 
• 
gaining insights about community members. 
Chapter 8 guides you to create a full strategic plan based 
• 
on what you’ve learned.
Part III: Doing
The final portion of the book, Part III, guides you through tactical execution. 
Chapter 9 explains how to design productive experi-
• 
ments and apply agile methods to your work. 
Chapter 10 is all about metrics that track performance. 
• 
Chapter 11 covers the most useful platforms for engaging 
• 
people and growing your brand. 
Chapter 12 provides knowledge at a tactical level on 
• 
practical ways to maintain and build your community—
and acquire customers. 
Chapter 13 explains how to tell a story about your 
• 
brand—the best way to connect with users at an emo-
tional level. 
Get Ready
By studying this book and applying its principles, you will learn how to 
create a robust and successful community management practice within your 
company. As a founder and consultant who has worked with a ton of startups, 
I understand the need for a bias toward action. This book is jam-packed with 
exercises and prompts to help you build a strategy that meets the business 
needs of your organization, regardless of its size or stage. 
By the end of this book, you will have a community strategy that drives 
bottom-line results for your company. Let’s get started!

What Is 
Community 
Management?
How to Harness the Power and Value of 
Community for any Organization
I know something about you. The fact that you’re reading a book about  
community management tells me that:
1.	 You need to know more about strategic community  
management to improve your business; or
2.	 You have community management responsibilities; or
3.	 You’re interested in getting a job with community  
management responsibilities.
That means this book needs to deliver useful information to 3 different  
audiences, and make it fun. No sweat!
Now I will share something about me. I know a lot about community manage-
ment and develop lots of digital business strategies with community at their 
core, so this book will have a solid theoretical underpinning. But I’m a huge 
believer in the idea that people learn best by doing.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?

That means The Community Manager’s Playbook has a strong bias towards 
action. Have no fear! I’ll ensure we lay a strong strategic foundation for 
­implementation, but unlike purely theoretical business books, you’ll find there 
are questions and exercises throughout the book to reinforce the knowledge. 
You have complete control over the speed and pace of each lesson. All I ask 
is that you use what you learn. Doing so will help you build a better team and 
business. (In fact, the “Learning Pyramid” from the NTL Institute of Applied 
Behavioral Science suggests that at least fifty percent of learning comes from 
direct application . . . now you’re starting to see the performance geek in me.)
To begin, I want to explain core concepts and make sure we’re all on the  
same page.
In this chapter, I’m going to:
1.	 Define community, in both a general sense and as it applies 
to business strategy;
2.	 Explain why people join communities;
3.	 Demonstrate the power of a strong, well-managed 
community;
4.	 Get you up to speed on digital communities; and
5.	 Teach you how to assess the role of community manage-
ment in your own organization.
These are important first steps that will form a strong foundation for your 
community management strategy. Even if you have experience with these  
topics, I encourage you to review them. Share the love and teach others in 
your organization, while reinforcing your own knowledge.
Let’s get started!
What Is Community?
By the broadest definition, community brings individuals together around a 
common purpose, interest, or goal. The most basic type is based on physical 
proximity. For example, people in your neighborhood or hometown are part 
of a community that’s formed around that location.
Other traditional communities are based on shared characteristics. Here are 
a few examples:
Alumni groups are based on a connection to a specific 
• 
college or university.
Sports fans gather to support a team they love.
• 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
5
Churches bring people together around shared beliefs.
• 
Classic car clubs find owners of a particular type of car 
• 
drawn together by their love of that car.
Thought starter
■
■
  Can you think of other types of traditional communities? Do you belong to any?
Once upon a time, face-to-face interaction was the main way to form com-
munities and nurture them. The widespread adoption of the Internet has  
created new ways for people (and businesses interested in those people) to forge  
connections. We’ll dig deeper into the digital landscape later this chapter.
What Defines a Community?
If you’re waiting at a bus stop, you’re not automatically part of a community 
with the other people around you (although shared grumbling about the wait 
could bring you closer!). What makes a community different from random 
groups of people standing near each other?
Engagement. 
A community is an engaged and connected group of individuals in pursuit of 
mutual interests or a shared commonality.
This is why one of the key objectives for community managers is to drive or 
increase engagement.
To define a community, you must first know what brings the people together. 
As you might imagine, there are a number of different reasons and common-
alities that compel people to come together in a physical or virtual commu-
nity setting.
Understanding what moves people to connect and engage is the first step 
towards building a community that attracts, engages, and retains the right 
people for your business.

8 Key Reasons People Join Communities
Here are eight of the most common motivators for a person to join a 
community.
• 
Identity: Communities often form amongst those who 
share a common sense of self. For example, members of 
alumni groups share a past at the same college or uni-
versity. This experience shaped their identity as alumni. 
They join alumni groups to connect with people who 
share this identity.
One of my students manages membership for a private 
• 
club that is only open to alumni of a prestigious top 
university. On a recent survey, members cited the 
organization’s connection to the university as the 
number one reason they joined.
Another example is Lululemon. Despite its recent 
• 
PR troubles (more on that later), the clothing line 
expanded its business exponentially by uniting 
customers around a shared identity as a yoga or 
fitness junkie.
• 
Purpose: People seek a sense of purpose by working to 
achieve something important on a grand scale. The goal 
can be in the form of a social cause, like ending poverty, 
or in the form of political action, like getting a certain 
party elected. Communities form around people with a 
shared purpose.
Groups like the American Cancer Society gather 
• 
members around the purpose of curing cancer. This 
shared goal unites people because it relates directly to 
people’s personal experiences and provides support. 
• 
Intent: Groups also form around shared intentions, which 
is different from purpose. These communities strive 
toward very specific goals like those who join bereave-
ment groups to overcome the grief of losing a loved one 
or those who volunteer for an organization that helps 
the poor.
To compare: a purpose-based community would 
• 
strive to end world hunger, while an intent-based 
community would organize a soup kitchen to make 
an immediate, tangible impact.

The Community Manager’s Playbook

• 
Objectives: Objectives are similar to intent, with specific 
and tangible goals.
For example, I am part of the marathon community. 
• 
This community is united by a common and tangible 
goal: running 26.2 miles. Within this community, 
there are groups who run to raise money for a cure 
for cancer. Those groups are purpose-driven subsets 
inside the objective-driven community.
Objectives 
aren’t 
all 
numbers-driven. Business 
• 
Network International (BNI) is the world’s largest 
business networking community. Members participate 
to gain referrals for their respective businesses and 
find “win-win” scenarios for each other.
• 
Interests/Passions: A shared passion for a specific hobby 
or activity also unites individuals, for example those who 
practice a sport, dance, or engage in one of the arts, like 
theater or comedy.
Nike Plus has built a huge network of running 
• 
enthusiasts globally to bring one set of customers 
together around a common interest through a 
branded motivational platform. As a result, those 
involved engage with Nike every single time they go 
for a run. That creates a sense of brand loyalty that’s 
incredibly valuable for the company in the long term.
• 
Drivers: People can also be pushed together by knowledge 
or “conditions” with shared implications. Market forces 
can drive businesspeople together; natural disasters forge 
a bond among affected individuals; even the loss of a loved 
one can unite the people left behind.
As a New Yorker, I think back to the aftermath of 
• 
Hurricane Sandy. The city organized town hall 
meetings for those affected, particularly catering to 
small business owners in lower Manhattan. In the 
wake of tragedy, community formed.
The driver need not be negative. The same 
• 
phenomenon occurs in positive situations, like 
weddings, recoveries from serious illness, and other 
major milestones.

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?

• 
Behavior: Frequently, motivational systems bring people 
together. Many groups use the power of accountability 
and a peer reinforcement model to help members reach 
their goals. People involved in these communities have 
behaviors that are impacting their day-to-day lives that 
need to be changed. The new behaviors provided by 
these communities can replace the negative ones with 
the support of the group and guidance of community 
leaders.
Alcoholics Anonymous offers a system of sponsors 
• 
and chips. Members earn a sense of pride and 
connection when interacting with other members 
and showing off their tokens.
Weight Watchers, with a daily points system and 
• 
weekly group weigh-ins, enables dieters to celebrate 
with other members as their numbers on the scale 
go down.
• 
Point of View: People with similar attitudes, whether politi-
cal, religious or social, often connect with one another. 
These meetings are not necessarily planned to drive a 
particular outcome, but often just to connect to people 
with similar perspectives.
Liberals and conservatives might attend meetings to 
• 
discuss their political views without working towards 
a concrete agenda.
More specifically, think about Barack Obama’s 
• 
“change we can believe in” campaigns. Citizens 
United via Organizing for Action was not necessarily 
in support of Barack Obama as an individual or of 
specific initiatives he proposed, but in support of the 
perspective he represented. Shared perspectives can 
be a powerful force. 
What Community Means to Business
So, what exactly are the implications of community?
The common theme across all of those categories is that community gathers 
people around an idea, whether it’s a larger purpose, a defined objective, or a 
general point of view. Understanding these motivations will allow you to tap 
into the power of community for your business.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
9
You can start by finding the shared goals or interests of the people you want 
in your community. Within that, you need to define which goals or interests 
make sense and add value to your business.
Earlier, I mentioned the Nike Plus community of runners. Even though creating 
a platform for runners did not immediately or directly drive sales for Nike, 
it connected a group of running enthusiasts and kept them engaged with the 
Nike brand. One can assume that this translated not only to sales in the long 
run but also into customer loyalty. I use my Nike running app 3–5 times a 
week, for example, depending on my training objectives. Think about what 
that kind of frequent customer engagement could do for your business.
Think about the type of product or service your company sells, and what kind 
of community makes sense to support it. Get inspired by brands like Nike and 
think beyond the immediate sale. In today’s economy of access and choice, 
customer preference and loyalty should be coveted as an essential business 
metric. If you build a devoted community following, that will translate to brand 
loyalty.
Small Business Knows Communities
Back in “the olden days” (before digital marketing), one segment of the ­business 
world found a way to capitalize on community: local small businesses. Think 
back and recollect whether any of the small businesses in your hometown 
sponsored local town events or your school sports team. You bet they did!
Roche Bros., the local supermarket in my hometown of Westwood, 
Massachusetts, always donated supplies for school functions and events. By 
maintaining a strong local presence and connecting their brand to that group 
identity, Roche Bros. became the favored supermarket of many parents in the 
community they served.
This basic premise, linking the support of a business to a particular community, 
is the same idea that we use to engage with our communities today.
Note
■
■
  Just as small businesses learned to leverage community in many ways well before  
the Internet arrived, today’s businesses can create and nurture communities. But now they can reach 
even more people effectively using today’s digital tools. Community is an asset. Digital is a lever  
(for distribution). The two, together, make a great pairing.

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?

What Is Community in the Digital Age?
Some things have changed. The rise of the digital age, with global access to the 
Internet, has eliminated the need for physical proximity to build communities. 
Often people are just looking to connect with like-minded individuals or are 
on a fact-finding mission around a new hobby or purpose.
The most powerful part of community has remained the same: the reason 
people join. In fact, the digital age has magnified that power since people can 
search for specific interests and find groups that meet their exact needs more 
easily than they could before. People are forming bonds as strong, and as real, 
as friendships forged in the physical world.
This new level of specificity can be harnessed by your business as well. As you 
work through The Community Manager’s Playbook, you’ll learn how to identify 
and reach the types of people who want what you’re selling. Imagine that: a 
community of people who don’t have to be convinced to become custom-
ers! This is why community management is such a powerful tool when used 
wisely.
3 Types of Online Communities for Business
Let’s continue by breaking down the key types of online communities related 
to business.
1.	 Business to Business: Earlier, I mentioned BNI, the world’s 
largest business networking group. As the name suggests, 
Business to Business (B2B) communities connect people 
with business needs to share information. These include 
independent sellers sharing sales tips, and buyers and  
sellers in an online marketplace exchanging information.
2.	 Employee to Employee: As with B2B communities, 
Employee to Employee communities focus on work 
needs. Employees share best practices and knowledge.
3.	 Business to Consumer: Business to Consumer (B2C) 
communities are the main focus of this book. These 
are the public, front-facing communities that will end up 
driving business and representing your brand. Examples 
include customers on a commerce site sharing common 
interest in a company’s products or brand image and 
people who subscribe to an online information service 
discussing relevant information.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
11
Note
■
■
  Consumer to consumer is another key category of online community. Since these 
communities tend to form organically, often as a way for customers or fans to share stories, tips, or 
information about a brand, traditional community manager tactics concerning brand, best practices, 
and marketing may not apply. These are typically self-governed and companies cannot expect 
to control them. The best way to encourage positive Consumer to Consumer communities is by 
providing excellent customer service and community management in the parts of the Internet your 
company does control. Yet another way that earning consumer loyalty reaps rich rewards!
THE ADVANTAGES OF DIGITAL CHANNELS:  
A CHEATSHEET
So, I keep saying that digital channels have brought great advantages to the community 
discipline, and much of that is because they allow the asset of community to be leveraged. 
If you have a thriving in-person community or you plan to build a digital community, you 
will enjoy these four benefits when you add digital channels into your community mix:
• 
Access: A Direct connection to your audience helps to develop 
creative initiatives with marketing team, and to discover relevant 
trends and/or trendsetters.
• 
Savings: Less expensive marketing and market research—from 
tracking behavior and sentiment to winning customers to entering 
a market or releasing a product.
• 
Consistency: Ease of distribution lowers the bar on a community 
manager’s ability to be more consistent and timely in building and 
retaining the audience relationship.
• 
Speed: The ability to reach your community quickly and frequently 
enables agile ways of working, such as iterating and evolving your 
message and getting real time feedback.
The Power of Community Can Make or Break a 
Business
The importance of community and digital advancements creates a massive 
business opportunity but, I won’t kid you, it’s not easy. Community managers 
have to navigate a vast, rapidly changing landscape that shifts from online to 
offline, (a.k.a. the real world). Thanks to digital channels, the customer jour-
ney has become a whole lot more complicated in the last decade. When I 

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?
12
started my career in marketing (a segue from journalism), we could count the 
media mix in the single digits: print, TV, radio, out of home display (billboards, 
etc.), email, and events. We’ll talk a lot more about understanding where your  
audience lives, and where and how to engage them in Part 2 of the book.
While this complexity introduces challenges, the rewards are high. Businesses 
that dive in can capitalize on existing communities or build their own, which 
creates a deep sense of connection to their brand that might not have been 
there before.
And you really have no choice anyway. Well, that is if you want your custom-
ers to be happy. The days of push-marketing are over. Companies can no  
longer push one-sided ad campaigns and expect customers to blindly 
accept their message. The digital age has turned marketing into a two-way 
conversation.
What does two-way conversation mean? Think about the last time you 
chose a restaurant. Did you check reviews on a site like Yelp or an app like 
Foursquare?
How about buying a product or planning a vacation? Did information on sites 
like Amazon or TripAdvisor factor into your decisions?
Like it or not, customers have a powerful voice in the digital age, especially on 
social media where people are strongly influenced by the opinions of friends 
and family. This is what digital marketers call transparency.
Social media has brought such transparency to the customer relationship that 
businesses have no choice but to respond and tailor their communications. 
Companies who do not embrace this new landscape risk alienating customers 
and losing business to savvy competitors.
This is why a good community management initiative is so important.
Community management is more relevant than ever in helping businesses gain 
and keep their customers. It is the process of inserting a brand into people’s 
daily lives. Community management is the essential connecting glue between 
consumers and brands in this new age of transparency.
If managed properly, communities can forge stronger bonds between custom-
ers and brands. Building this connection, however, is not a passive process. 
Businesses and consumers have an incredible ability to give and get feedback. 
Community management begins from a desire to use that ability to constantly 
improve products and services and show customers that their voices are 
heard.

The Community Manager’s Playbook

THE UGLY BABY SYNDROME
Until recently, advertisers created campaigns, pushed their messages out, and waited 
for the world to respond to their brilliance. There was no way to forecast results. Instead, 
businesses would find out whether an ad campaign was successful after it had run by 
measuring the sales and interest generated afterwards.
The problem with this system was “ugly baby syndrome.”
No one wants to admit their baby is ugly. This applies to creative babies as well. Whether 
the baby is a campaign, brand image, or consumer product, no one wants to admit their 
idea or product isn’t desirable (or that it’s an outright failure). Brand marketers have 
invested so much time and energy into their creation that they do not accept it could be 
ugly, or worse, an abject failure.
What does that have to do with community management?
While the rise of the digital age can be scary (anyone can post poor reviews on sites like 
Yelp or Amazon), it also gives businesses the power to research and understand their 
customers better. Community managers play a large role in collecting and applying this 
type of information. You will learn the tools and techniques to do this later in the book. 
By doing so, you can avoid ugly baby syndrome for your company.
What Happens When You Neglect Community 
Management
Even though it’s clear that online community management should be at the 
top of priority lists for most companies, it often fails to find champions. Many 
promising ideas have fallen flat due to management’s opinion that expanding 
the digital audience is a “trivial” matter or a secondary marketing priority.
The digital audience is far from trivial. In fact, technology has empowered 
these communities and the customers within them because the voice of an 
individual or group can travel across geographic boundaries and social net-
works. Word of mouth is more powerful than ever as new ways to broadcast 
opinions and personal reviews are built every day.
Let’s look at the case of Lululemon, a high-end fitness fashion line with a  
loyal following. In March 2013, a new shipment of their classic yoga pants 
turned out to be so thin that they were see-through. Consumer trust in the 
brand fell.

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?
14
As if that were not enough, in November of the same year, Lululemon founder 
Chip Wilson publically stated that “some women’s bodies just don’t work in 
the pants.” His statement implied that customers who didn’t meet his com-
pany’s physical standards (having thighs that rubbed together, for example) 
should not expect the brand’s yoga pants to provide full coverage.
Wilson’s remarks sparked a massive uproar in what had once been described 
as his “cult-like yoga community.” Members of his brand’s community, in all 
shapes and sizes lashed out via social media, print media and in face-to-face 
conversations.1 Sample Tweets included:
“For a company with an inspiring and empowering mani-
• 
festo promoting self love & pride, this rationale does not 
align . . .”
“Wearing my @lululemon pants tonight to tennis prac-
• 
tice and making sure my thighs rub extra, like they always 
do. Because I have muscles.”
This scandal became a “hot topic” that was discussed by major news services 
and people who hadn’t even heard of the brand before this negative story.
This is a prime example of the power of community.
Lululemon’s revenue had been growing at a rate of well-above 25% per quar-
ter before the scandal. Afterwards, it experienced a big drop in growth, to 
around 20% and below since that statement went public. (See Figure 1-1)

In this scenario, both before and after the scandal hit, community management 
would have played a key role in understanding customers and advising better 
ways of responding. Businesses who ignore or disrespect their communities 
will pay a huge price. The Lululemon case shows that even large brands are 
not exempt from this truth.
What Is a Community Manager?
We’ve been talking about the importance of community management as 
though it were a common function in most companies. It is, of course, not yet 
well established. Community management needs a champion and a shepherd 
within the organization. The champion needs to be in management and the 
shepherd is the community manager.
The name says it all. The role of a community manager is not to control or 
manipulate people, but to manage (that is, facilitate) the communication that 
exists between customers and company. It is about fostering positive connec-
tions and empowering community members to interact with each other and 
with the business in a meaningful way.
How does one person (or team) accomplish that? Well, by reading this book, 
of course!
On a more serious note, community managers have to serve multiple  
constituents. They mediate between customers and the business, delivering 
valuable customer feedback to the company, while responding and reaching 
out to customers. At the same time, community managers must inspire com-
munity members to interact with each other. Think of them as the ultimate 
host. All great hosts are skilled at curating the guest list, the menu, and match-
ing everyone’s tastes and preferences. I found my Italian hosting skills came in 
very handy when I first started as Crunch Fitness’s community supervisor.
Remember earlier in the chapter when I listed the reasons that people join 
and stay in a community? The common thread running through all those  
reasons is a connection to other people. If community members are not con-
necting with each other, it will quickly cease to be a community.
On top of those responsibilities, community managers also help build and 
maintain a company culture that supports customers and community mem-
bers. Why is this important? If people inside your company do not understand 
the needs of your customers, you risk doing business in a way that makes no 
sense to them. Community managers can help everyone on your team under-
stand how customer feedback can improve their own performance, from a 
social media intern to an accountant who may never interact directly with 
customers.

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?
16
Because of these responsibilities, the community manager role is extremely 
multifunctional:
1.	 They overlap with marketers, who specialize in outreach 
and brand messaging.
2.	 They facilitate relationships between employees within 
different departments, much like human resources.
3.	 They often have to work closely with product develop-
ment teams to create products and services based on 
customer feedback.
4.	 Given their understanding of customer interests and  
habits, they can also be incredible resources for sales and 
operations teams.
Complicated, right? Yes and no. While a community manager can do all 
these things, the key to good business is knowing what your company needs. 
Understanding all the different ways that this role can be used will help you 
figure out what type of community manager your business needs or what type 
you want to be.
I’ll go into much more detail in Chapter 2.
Measuring the Value of Community 
Management
For now, just know that a community manager can create significant value for 
your business. I’ve discussed the intangible reasons that community manage-
ment is important. Now let’s make the business and numbers people more 
comfortable with this value equation.
Throughout this book, I will share techniques to measure your impact that 
shows the value of community efforts with bottom-line data. For community 
managers, this knowledge will equip you to make a case for building and pur-
suing your strategy. For entrepreneurs and hiring managers, this knowledge 
will assist you in building a team with quantifiable performance.
Community management is undergoing the same revolution experienced by 
branding. Brand strategy used to be considered the “fluff”—an added bonus 
but not a necessity for business. This was because, unlike a new product with 
measurable revenues, there wasn’t an easy way to measure the success of 
branding. However, there is clearly a high value; very few people would chose 
an unknown brand of soda over Coca Cola or Pepsi.
This is the same sort of intangible value that a good community creates.  
You may not know exactly how to measure it yet, but you already know it when 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
17
you experience it. Did you know that the Campbell’s Soup Company began 
as a community built around exchanging recipes and sharing stories about 
how members prepared meals for their families? Building on that involvement, 
Campbell’s has become one of the largest corporations in the world.
These days, there are new tools and techniques to measure the success of 
both branding and community management. As it turns out, both are very 
important to business success, even though they are often valued at a 4-to-1 
ratio on a business’s balance sheet.
How Community Creates Tangible Value
So let’s make the intangible tangible. I’ve pulled in five different tangible  
activities that can be facilitated through the community principles in this 
book. After each are the tangible business outcomes that you can track value  
creation and/or revenue against.
Complexity gap/customer and stakeholder feedback 
• 
® 
product/offering requirements and feedback
Consumer pain points 
• 
® innovation
Relationship building 
• 
® winning customers/community 
size and retention
Touch point/marketing channels (increased awareness) 
• 
® 
increased purchase intent and sales over time
Internal engagement and connectivity 
• 
® productivity, 
retention of smart people (reduce churn and recruitment 
costs)
What does this all mean?
The complexity gap refers to the increasing amount of data available in the 
world. Community management is extremely useful for closing this “gap,” 
which was cited by IBM on its “Capitalizing on Complexity” study in 2010 as 
the number one problem facing CEOs.
By creating a channel for customer feedback through community management, 
companies can grow their offerings in conjunction with the desires of their 
customers. Ultimately, investment in community management will pay off by 
enabling companies with a rapidly shifting market to see changes in customer 
behavior and preferences and to leverage the insights about customer needs 
to make adjustments in products and offerings to create even more value. 
Similarly, customer feedback acquired by community management will also 
identify consumer “pain points,” areas that can lead to improving a current 
product or service, or even new product creation. Not only does this support 
innovation, it supports targeted innovation that addresses specific customer 

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?
18
needs. That means products and services could be created with a known  
consumer base. It’s the closest thing to a crystal ball that businesses can have!
Additionally, by listening to customer feedback and nurturing relationships, 
community managers can establish a real connection between the consumer 
and the brand. This intangible relationship fosters customer retention and  
loyalty, and it opens the door for referrals. Through this loyalty, community 
management can be linked to a growing customer base and community size. 
This can drive increased awareness of the brand across “touch points” like 
social media sites, blogs, forums and more. The more touch points there are, 
the more likely that a company will gain new customers and increase sales.
Community managers are the ears of the organization. They listen to what 
people are saying about the company. When community managers focus 
on internal communities, they can also generate tangible value. By creating  
connectivity—both in communication between departments and shared com-
pany culture—community managers can facilitate productivity by attracting, 
and retaining smart people. By reducing human resources churn, community 
managers can actually increasing bottom line earnings by driving down recruit-
ment and training costs.
Almost Ready to Dive In . . .
While I hope I have thoroughly convinced you that community management is 
both valuable and necessary, this book was not written to convince business-
people of the benefits of creating an online community.
The Community Manager’s Playbook will:
1.	 Show savvy entrepreneurs who are eager to tackle the 
challenges of creating strategies for content, distribution, 
and the measurement of community growth exactly how 
to do so;
2.	 Provide marketing and communications staff tasked with 
determining profitable new strategies with ways to inte-
grate the principles of community management through 
fresh ideas and methods; and
3.	 Explain to agencies and business executives who need to 
refresh business strategies how to use community man-
agement to drive growth in revenue and reach.
As such, this book assumes that you now understand what community man-
agement is and why it is critical. We’ll now focus on the how.

The Value of Community Management in Your 
Organization
So . . . how do you design and execute a successful CM strategy? Let’s jump in 
and find out!
The specific role of community management in your organization will depend 
on a few different things: organization size and structure, business stage, posi-
tion, prioritization and resource allocation, internal business, and marketing 
integration.
Community managers can serve in different departments: marketing, product 
development, human resources, or their own community department.
EXERCISE
Answer these questions to help define the type of community management needed 
for your business. Take note of questions you cannot answer alone and schedule a 
meeting or discussion with the people who can provide those answers. This information 
will form a solid foundation for building strategic community management.
Question: What does community mean to the management or founding team? To 
frontline employees or stakeholders?
Follow-up Question: Does the meaning change if you ask each stakeholder individually 
versus what arises from a group debate?
Step 1: Consider starting this conversation internally, regardless of the size of your 
team, by asking team members to write down their understanding of community and 
submit it to a central community lead. (That’s probably you, or a person you can identify 
and engage.) Then, compile the answers, preferably on a whiteboard or large sketch 
pad, and have a team meeting to discuss the team’s ideas and come up with a common 
meaning for your community strategy. You’re also looking for buy-in throughout the 
organization.
Step 2: After you’ve got a sense of what community means internally, consider reaching 
out to external stakeholders (vendors, strategic partners, and customers). In this 
exercise, your goal is to unearth what community means for your current customers 
and how they would like to interact with your organization. Focus groups (in person or 
online) or one-on-one interviews are both great ways of uncovering these preferences. 
Once you have a sense of what your customers are looking for from you, consider 
extending the exercise to other stakeholders that communicate with, and impact, your 
organization. You need stakeholder buy-in to make strategic and tactical decisions.

Chapter 1 | What Is Community Management?
20
GOAL: All of this fact-finding will establish your own and the organization’s foundational 
understanding of community management and what is most important to focus on. Your 
end goal should be to find the mutually beneficial connection points for your organization 
and end customers who will make up your community.
It will also help you answer the following:
What are you looking to achieve through community? The answer 
• 
will help you develop creative initiatives with the marketing team to 
discover relevant trends and trendsetters.
What business and marketing goals does the organization expect 
• 
to achieve through community?
Can community contribute to additional business and marketing 
• 
objectives?
Don’t Say It’s Over
Chapter 1 is coming to a close, but our time together is just beginning.  
You’ve learned:
1.	 What community is, in both a general sense and as applied 
to business strategy;
2.	 Why people join communities;
3.	 How powerful communities can be;
4.	 What digital communities are; and
5.	 How to begin assessing the role of community manage-
ment in your own organization.
Now that we know what community means and how it can add value, it’s 
time to define the type of community management that your business needs.  
The next chapter will help you discover what type of community manager 
your business needs or what type of community manager you want to be. 
Let’s go!

Not All 
Communities 
Are Created 
Equal
An Insider’s Perspective
The title community manager (CM) is almost a misnomer. Strong communities 
are not actually “managed” even though the role’s name suggests otherwise. 
Rather, they are empowered and enabled to act according to the best interest 
of the community while remaining true to the shared bond that brought them 
together. Semantics aside, defining the right role and hiring right person as 
community manager, will help engage your audience.
Let’s stick with convention and use the term “community manager.” A person 
in this role can contribute in very different ways depending on the needs of 
an organization and the community within it. This means, a hiring organization  
needs to choose carefully in more ways than one; in addition to filling the role 
with the right person, the organization also needs to clarify what type of 
community management is needed.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal

In the previous chapter, we discussed the background and definition of com-
munity management and why it is important to an organization in a general 
sense. In this chapter, we’ll be taking a deeper dive into how the role of a 
community manager has expanded in the digital age, beyond the initial tasks of 
moderating online forums and organizing in-person events, to include digital 
marketing and social media. We will examine the different forms of com-
munity management and the innate qualities and experiences that are strong 
indicators that a certain person will be successful as a community manager.
For hiring organizations, we’ll also build on the insights you gained from 
Chapter 1’s exercises to define the type of community manager role that 
meets your needs.
For readers who are current or aspiring CMs, we will discuss how to critically 
assess your own skill set and work style, and what steps you can take to 
bridge any gaps in skills and experience needed to be a successful CM.
Background: the Expansion and Scope  
of the CM Role
Let’s take a trip down memory lane and see how community management has 
developed over time. The community manager role originated in:
Event marketing and the non-profit world;
• 
Residential communities (dorms, retirement homes,  
• 
private complexes with shared services like community 
center, activities, laundry, etc.); and
Technology companies (originally driven by online  
• 
support forums popularized by software and software-as-a-
service companies as well as some hardware companies)
Now, if you think that these three things couldn’t be more different, you 
are correct. However, in today’s digitally infused world, the best community 
managers have evolved to include aspects of each of these roles. They have 
combined relationship management (skills needed in the event, non-profit, 
and residential worlds) with technical prowess and process implementation 
(skills originating in the technology world). Essentially building community 
by tying the practices and execution in the physical world to that of the 
digital world.
Personally, I came into community management from the event marketing 
camp. I freelanced on events during my early days as a journalist to make 
some extra cash. (Journalists aren’t known for being big earners.) One of the 
key lessons I took from both was the value of understanding my audience and 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
23
asking the right questions. The better I was able to understand them, the 
more engaged my audience was, and the easier it was to facilitate commu-
nity activities. As such, from the beginning of my community-building days, 
I put a very heavy emphasis on understanding consumer behavior, insight, 
and experience. This came in handy when I took on the founding role of 
“Community Supervisor” at Crunch Fitness’s New York Headquarters at 
the beginning of 2004. 
We can learn a lot by studying the successes and use cases of early approaches 
to both offline and online communities and applying it to modern, digitally 
infused community management. In order to consider the disciplines we can 
learn from, we must first understand the role as it stands today.
What Is a Community Manager Today?
Over the years, community management has morphed into marketing, brand 
management, and social media. Different companies may call the role differ-
ent things so let’s define CM by the actual responsibilities and goals for the 
role. By understanding the key functions, you will understand the best way to 
deliver those functions.
Community manager is a multi-functional, cross-disciplinary role, focused on 
audience management, bridging the gap between the online and the offline 
worlds for the community served. There is also tremendous value in tapping 
the power of community internally for collaboration, learning, and knowledge 
management, especially for marketing, customer service, or product develop-
ment teams. It’s as much about customer and prospect management as it 
is about improving internal communications and sharing knowledge. Ideally, 
this person plays a role in making the customer’s journey feel seamless from 
beginning to end.
Community managers are usually brought on board for one of three scenarios:
1.	 To build a community from scratch;
2.	 To maintain an existing community; or
3.	 To rebuild, recover, or resurrect a community that has 
abandoned a brand
 The online community manager role is a growing and developing profession. People in this position 
work to build, grow and manage communities around a brand, product, or cause.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal
24
In most communities, the community manager is one of the most powerful 
members. His or her position is considered above any other customer service 
or support staff, and is normally recognized by the community as the ultimate 
curator. Present day community management has taken a number of pages 
from the technology “forum moderator” community management approach, 
with the community manger being the highly visible go-to person for the 
community. A community manager can usually hire moderators and forum 
administrators or leverage highly engaged members of the community to fill 
any gaps. Normally, a community manager is an employee of the organization 
and is not a volunteer. But that’s not always the case, and some non-profits or 
professional organizations enlist volunteers to fill this role.
While the term “online community manager” may not have been used at the 
time, the role has existed since online systems first began offering features 
and functions that allowed for community creation. These early efforts, in 
the form of bulletin board systems, had leaders known as system operators 
or “sysops.” The early 1990s saw the growth of mainstream online computer 
services such as Prodigy, CompuServe, and America Online. Prominent fea-
tures of these services included communities, which went by various names, 
like Special Interest Groups, Communities of Interest, and so on, their leaders 
were often referred to as community managers.
Online community managers may serve a variety of roles depending on the 
nature and purpose of their online community, the business, and the brand, 
which may or may not be part of a profit-motivated enterprise. 
DEBUNKING THE MYTHS
What community management is not:
A purely digital marketing and communications role.
• 
Just posting Facebook updates and Tweets all day.
• 
Something that can be added to customer service to triage 
• 
complaints.
A role that can be passed off to the optimization people hiding out 
• 
with the tech team.
A job that should be handed to any “digital native” (meaning 
• 
that, no, not every community manager should be straight out of 
college and under 25).

The Community Manager’s Playbook
25
So what does a community manager really do all day? The folks at Get 
Satisfaction put it succinctly in Figure 2-1, “Inside the Mind of a Community 
Manager,” which describes the different things a community manager has on 
their mind as they’re interacting with, and building, any given community.
Cheerleader: The CM conveys genuine excitement over 
• 
the accomplishments of both company and consumer, 
and inspires future great acts.
Concierge: Good service goes beyond traditional  
• 
customer service. The CM will respond to questions 
and requests from the community that may need to be 
resolved outside the community.
Empathizer: In addition to being intuitive about commu-
• 
nity sentiment, the CM is also cognizant of brewing trends 
that are indicators of future actions and performance.
Gardener: The CM will cultivate the engagement and  
• 
happiness within a community.
Mediavore: The CM is as savvy as the community served. 
• 
This means understanding all the key social media plat-
forms, plus any other channel that is meaningful to  
the brand.
Pinata: The CM is the face of the brand to the public, so 
• 
when things go south, CMs will absorb the majority of 
the reactive criticism, while striving to deliver rewards 
for the community members.
Sculptor: There is a lot of incoming information from 
• 
each individual community member. The CM will take an 
overwhelming amount of raw data and interpret it into 
insights that allow the brand to learn and grow.
Spam Warrior: The CM maintains a happy flock of com-
• 
munity members by protecting them against internet 
trolls and other nefarious online creatures.
Sponge: Since consumer sentiment is a qualitative, rather 
• 
than quantitative scale, a CM should be intuitive enough 
to gauge the feeling of a group.
Traffic Cop: CMs need to understand the full inner workings 
• 
of their companies so they know how to direct incoming 
requests to the right teams and maximize progress.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal
26
Feels like a pretty busy mind doesn’t it? CMs are great multi-taskers and 
able to easily triage, and then prioritize all that is happening. It’s important to 
understand all of the different things that fly through an experienced CM’s 
purview so you can understand not only their point of view but the sheer 
volume of interactivity that happens on an ongoing, real-time basis.
With an understanding of the CMs perspective, let’s look at how to define what 
this will mean for your organization and any current or prospective CMs.
Defining Community Management for Your  
Organization
Now that you understand why communities are generally important to today’s 
businesses, it’s time to identify what your company specifically needs in terms 
of audience and community management. This will point to the best place for 
this team within your organization.
Whether you’re creating an entirely new department or reassessing an exist-
ing department, this is a great opportunity to align your brand, business vision, 
and digital strategy.
We’ve taken a look at all the things that a community manager can be. In 
Chapter 1, we figured out which of these characteristics are most important 
and essential for your company needs. Now, let’s combine these two perspec-
tives (what a community manager can be and what characteristics are most 
important for your company) together to identify how to define the CM role 
properly for your needs—and then staff it correctly.
What Should the Role Look Like? 
Let’s look at the different ways that a community manager can drive value for 
your brand.
In the next chapter, we will dive into the specifics of creating job definitions for the community 
management role that your company needs and discussing how to hire the best person for that job. 
Before we do that, you should understand what your company’s actual needs are, so that you can 
map the job description to those business goals.
The community manager’s tasks can include, but aren’t limited to, creating all 
community content (such as photos, words, videos, and/or other shareable 
media), Facebook posts, blog posts, articles, podcasts, Twitter posts, LinkedIn 
posts, Quora posts, link building, responding to community, escalating issues, 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
27
working as brand advocates, creating social media marketing-led campaigns, 
and engaging with customers.
Keep in mind that these tasks are all done with the goal of maximizing a brand 
or company’s marketing impact and reach.
Primary Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities that form the foundation of a community man-
ager role are outlined below. As you’ll see in the next chapter, this is a good 
starting point for designing a job description. Then you can take the results 
of the Chapter 1 assessment exercises to refine the role and tailor it to the 
needs of your organization.
1.	 Managing customer relationships (acquiring, retaining, 
facilitating, activating):
a.	
Listening, understanding, and advocating for customers.
b.	 Facilitating and managing customer conversations, 
questions, and needs.
c.	 Acting as a conduit between the customer and the 
resources, access, or knowledge they need from your 
company.
d.	 Creating a connection between the customer and 
the brand or product.
2.	 Gathering insights
a.	
Putting the customer first goes a long way towards col-
lecting insights and understanding their needs and wants.
b.	 Identifying opportunities. Because they’re interacting 
with customers non-stop, not only are CMs finding 
actionable insights but they are also able see oppor-
tunities and help prioritize product or service oppor-
tunities or needs, revenue potential etc.
3.	 Acting as connector
a.	
External relationship building (stakeholder, partner 
management).
b.	 Internal glue and conduit (communicating customer 
needs and identified opportunities to the appropriate 
parties).
c.	 Ensuring customers are heard.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal
28
From Figure 2-1, you’ve seen there are a number of things that fly through 
a community manager’s head at a given moment on a day-to-day basis.  
The three most important responsibilities just discussed, however, are meant 
to focus you on the most essential activities CMs must do, regardless of  
the organization.

Who Should the CM Report To?
Should your community manager report to marketing, customer service, 
product development, or even sales? While this role is cross-functional, having 
a community manager report to multiple managers may not be practical. In a 
consumer brand organization, the community manager is likely to report to 
the head of customer service or the marketing director. In a startup, the com-
munity manager is likely to report to the head of product or marketing. While 
in the earlier stages of development, he or she is likely reporting to both and 
the founder, or perhaps the founder alone. At the end of the chapter, you can 
work through an exercise to figure out the right organizational structure for 
your specific business needs.
The Risk of Hiring Without Forethought
If you have the right person in this role, you will see a dramatic uptick in com-
munity and customer satisfaction externally: and internally a reduced demand 
from management to support the CM function. Now that you understand 
how much value a CM can add to your organization, it’s tough-love time. You 
need to give this hiring decision a lot of consideration! It’s an important one 
and, as you’ve seen, has high exposure internally and externally.
Finding the right person to fill the community manager role is not an easy task. 
Recruiters and hiring directors know this. While most businesses and brands 
face this struggle, budding startups and venture capitalists feel an amplified 
burden because they lack the right tools and knowledge to properly onboard 
and further develop a person in this role.
So if you’re a hiring manager, don’t just shuttle this person off to go hang with 
the interns. And if you’ve already been hired or are working as a community 
manager, don’t be afraid to put your hand up and say you need more access 
throughout the organization.
If your boss won’t give you access or doesn’t think it’s necessary, take it upon 
yourself to meet people in different departments, and at all levels of the orga-
nization. In my classroom at General Assembly,1 I like to call this “socializing” 
ideas or “giving ideas oxygen” in order to get buy-in internally or as a way of 
validating your concepts.
Don’t give too much credence to the myth that only recent grads or digital 
natives who know how to navigate social media on a personal basis can handle 
community management. While these groups are familiar with social media 
platforms, it takes experience to represent a professional brand well.

The person tasked with creating and maintaining a new community or maintaining 
an existing community has a tremendous amount of responsibility. Community 
managers are often the first and most significant point of contact for customers 
and community members. Place this team too low in your organizational struc-
ture, and you’ll send the message that your customers are not important.
Note to hiring managers: the community manager owns and often defines the 
brand voice to the public (especially in startups). In larger organizations, the 
community manager uses the voice defined in the brand guide by marketing. 
The brand voice must be consistent and align with the overarching brand 
strategy to ensure success. Your community can also be a great place to get 
audience feedback on how the brand message is perceived and identify oppor-
tunities to further refine.
This role should be taken as seriously as hiring a head of PR or marketing. 
It acts, after all, as a direct conduit to the public and could be first line of 
response in crisis situation. But all too often, this role is not taken seriously 
and often given to junior members without training or a plan for professional 
development. This is a mistake.
 Understand that there’s a lot at stake when you hire a community manager. It’s a risk that could blow 
up in your face if you do not take it seriously or assume anyone with 1,341 friends on Facebook will 
know how to handle the job properly and effectively. Do as much planning and diligence as you would 
when hiring the head of marketing. Placing this level of importance and rigor to the hiring process 
with a role that is often considered junior to mid-level will help you avoid the pitfalls of assuming any 
digital native will be able to do the job.
Factor in the Probability of Change 
While we’re discussing the risks of taking the role of community manager too 
lightly, we should also chat about the probability of change for this role as the 
business changes. Again, we’ll go more in depth in the next chapter to help 
you structure the right role for your needs, but keep the following points in 
mind while defining the organization’s needs for the role:
1.	 Understand that the CM role is evergreen and has to 
change as often as the needs of the company, its audience, 
and its business model change.
2.	 Current team members may need to be “trained up” in 
order to scale the community as it evolves.
3.	 CM team members may need to be transitioned or off-
boarded if their skills are not transferable to a new or 
evolved vision of CM.

The Community Manager’s Playbook

Keep in mind there are two common types of workers (and this goes beyond 
the CM role): builders and maintainers, and these employees act just as you’d 
think they would.
Builders are the ones you want on board when the vision needs to be created 
or illustrated, when hypotheses need to be defined and tested, when the pro-
cess needs to be put in place, and when infrastructure to support scale needs 
to be developed. These are also the people that run for the hills when they 
sense “business as usual.”
Applying this to community, these are people you want driving the community 
bus forward in the beginning or in times of dramatic change or overhaul. They 
can also be leveraged from other areas of marketing to help spearhead com-
munity-building efforts and then be partnered with a maintainer to execute. 
You’ll want to move a builder off a community initiative once the strategy 
has been built, proven, and operationalized. A builder can be a great internal 
asset to then transition to another new initiative within the organization. For 
businesses that have multiple communities or are constantly releasing new 
products, this person may be able to continue to thrive with that degree of 
change if paired with a maintainer to execute the more routine activities that 
are essential to keeping a community running.
Now, as you’d imagine, maintainers are the opposite. While some of them can 
still be agile and adaptable, and thus may appear to be builders, they are truly 
your worker bees who love structure and consistency. They do extremely 
well with defined metrics and operational work flows. These are the types 
that, once a community is set up, you want at the helm to help ensure the 
strategy is enforced and executed daily. With a high volume of communica-
tion these types thrive. But they are also the types that will struggle to get a 
new community off the ground or to pivot a struggling community into a new 
direction.
Beware: it is rare for the two types to be interchangeable, and it’s important 
to know which you need and not to keep either in a position too long if the 
community approach or stage changes.
Much like this clear distinction, there is also a clear distinction between a 
community manager and a social media manager. This difference is not well 
understood. Let’s explore.

Debate: Social Media Manager or  
Community Manager?
There has been much debate in the community management field, especially 
by day-to-day practitioners, about the difference between social media man-
agers and community managers and whether it is a danger to assume that a 
social media manager is the same as a community manager.
In a blog post on the topic, Phil Wride, a community manager at VennComm, 
said, “A community manager could switch to being a social media manager, 
but I’m not so sure it’s as easy to go the other way.”2 That said, a social media 
manager could make the switch, but without people curation and conversa-
tion facilitation skills, they will likely just turn to old school push marketing, 
and communities can sense that lack of authenticity a mile away.
Yes, social media is part of the tactical execution of a community manag-
er’s role today, but it isn’t always the cornerstone of this role and function. 
Community management also requires an abundance of relationship manage-
ment experience (or instincts) and strong writing skills.
In fact, in my first community job, tasked with founding the community depart-
ment out of Crunch’s New York headquarters in 2004, online and social were 
not even initially a part of the job or the department’s mandates. The origi-
nal strategy I deployed to get our community up and running was focused 
around events and partnerships. That was mostly because the value of the 
available digital communications channels (MySpace, online forums, and email) 
were unknown and social media was far from its eventual adoption into the 
marketing mix. Facebook was just being born on Harvard’s campus and nei-
ther YouTube nor Twitter were even in development (hard to believe right?). 
Regardless of the number of online channels to support the community effort, 
the core of the community manager’s role is much the same as it was a little 
over a decade ago when I started in the field.
One easy way to differentiate the roles is to think of social media managers as 
channel managers, and community managers as people managers. Let’s take a 
more in-depth look at each role.
Community Manager
CM’s handle a greater number of people and requests than social media 
managers generally do, across both owned and non-owned channels (platforms 
like Facebook, Twitter, etc.).

community-managers-fight/

The Community Manager’s Playbook

For a community, and certainly a branded one, listening is only the first step. 
Community managers need to respond to customers. If it’s happening in your 
community, it’s your job to hear questions and make sure that comments are 
not going into the black hole of general social media. Just because social 
happens to be one of the most effective ways to amplify community messages 
doesn’t mean the two practices are interchangable. The rest of the com-
munity can see unaddressed concerns or needs, and that affects your brand.
Building strong relationships with consumers is part and parcel of the duties 
of a CM, but what about internal relations? Bringing complaints, insights and 
opportunities from the community back to the right people within your orga-
nization often means working across multiple departments. This is one clear 
differentiation between community and social media. CM’s should look to 
build an internal network of collaborators across departments so that they 
can add value to the external insights they gain. By building this network of 
collaborators in different departments like product, customer support, and 
design, CMs can more quickly (and impactfully) respond to community mem-
bers’ needs when they fall outside of the CM’s department.
Thus, a community manager is normally given spokesperson rights in order 
to address community needs and normally gains credibility as an individual 
member within the community (as opposed to a social media manager that 
is entirely managing social on behalf of the brand and their own likeness is 
normally disguised). These rights are often gained over time as a CM gets to 
know the community and the brand. This calls for a high level of maturity and 
communication skills. There are of course implications to this in the hiring 
process, so if this is something you want your CM to do, take note, as we’ll be 
getting to crafting the roles and responsibilities shortly.
Social Media Manager
The social media manager focuses on owned channels instead of building 
relationships and engagement. The social media manager role is an extension  
of marketing or customer service. In many companies, that’s as far as the 
cross-functionality goes.
Unlike the CM, social media managers are not often using their own voice, 
personality, and opinions. Instead they are more likely to be speaking on 
behalf of the brand or so-called brand representatives. In most cases, they 
need to make sure their interactions fit the brand voice, as opposed to 
developing their own voice that supports the greater brand and community 
message.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal

How Do I Find This Magical Person?
Skills can be acquired, capabilities can be transferred, experience can be gained, 
but the instincts to be a good community manager are innate. At the end of 
the day, the most important thing community managers bring to the table is 
their ability to connect people, ideas, opportunities, and insights (both within 
and outside of the organization). These instincts for the role and the business 
and community that they are working within will look seamless and effort-
less when the right fit is found and developed. This was true for me when 
I was the community supervisor at Crunch. Not only did I have experience 
in journalism, fitness management and marketing, and program development, 
but I also had a personal interest in sports, competition, and group exercise. 
Combined with my personal fitness certifications, I was an authentic ambas-
sador and natural representative for that specific community.
Similarly, Twitch’s director of community and education, Marcus “djWHEAT” 
Graham was asked to join the team in large part because he was a dedicated 
member of the gaming community that Twitch serves. He was therefore the 
perfect liaison between the business and the Twitch fanbase.
We’ll talk more about the different roles a CM can play and how picking a Jack 
or Jill of all trades will play in your organization, in the next chapter, which will 
also guide you through the full hiring process. Let’s take a look at the natural 
qualities needed first.
1. Narrow the Field: Five Qualities That Every CM 
Must Have
No matter how much experience someone has, there are certain innate traits 
that are “must-haves” for a CM. As you begin to hire, these are the qualities 
to vet for in preliminary interviews so that you can determine if they have the 
right work styles and instincts for the CM role in your company.
1.	 Caring: A community manager must genuinely care about 
helping people, resolving issues, and building a sense of 
belonging.
2.	 Connecting: Community building is all about how you 
connect people with each other and the resources they 
need and desire.
3.	 Listening: People need to feel heard and it’s the CM’s job 
to make sure that happens and to build empathy with the 
audience.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
35
4.	 Conversing: Your community manager must be effective 
at starting discussions, especially when first starting out, 
as it can be tough to get a community going.
5.	 Believing: A true believer in the vision of the company, peo-
ple in this position must have their own sense of purpose 
and be invested. They’ll be bringing people together around 
this vision. If they don’t believe it wholeheartedly, they won’t 
be as genuine, and your community will sense this.
6.	 Strategizing: Community building is hard enough, but being 
able to think about it strategically, and determine how it 
affects your company’s success, is even harder. However, 
it is a crucial part of building your community in a mean-
ingful way.
Remember the tough love warning given earlier in the chapter? The CM role 
is not the place to skimp. That said, sometimes there is just no choice. If 
you’ve only planned for a junior role, then these are the qualities that indicate 
a good chance of success in a CM position.
If you found somebody with these five attributes, even with no experience, 
that person could be trained into a successful CM. BUT you need to make 
sure there’s a good environment for learning and the opportunity for teaching 
success in this role (or add strong self-starter to your list of “must-haves”).
 An inexperienced person can succeed as a community manager, but likely only if they reflect the five 
traits in the list above. Why? Because CMs, more than other roles, must have the right work style and 
mindset to do their job well. For someone with a natural work style fit, their instincts will guide them to 
make good decisions that put their community members first and then look to align those decisions 
with the business or organizational objectives.
Depending on the brand and the expectations for the CM, some personality 
characteristics will be more valuable than others. These are different from the 
five qualities presented in the preceding section. Those are non-negotiable 
and needed to succeed in any CM role.
Personality Characteristics
Temperament: Some of the best community managers in the world are people 
who fall in love with everyone they meet.
Culture fit: Hire for someone who fits the company culture naturally, and that 
person will broadcast the brand to the world.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal
36
Positive attitude: Someone who is willing to learn and listen. If everything 
they do is driven by a focus on helping people, they’re headed in the right 
direction.
Intuitive: Tuned in to the unspoken parts of communication and instinctively 
understands how, and when, to react.
Work Style Characteristics
Agile: Can move fast, has a strong ability to multitask, and is able to triage 
priorities (many things can happen at once).
Problem solver: Able to address situations that require a full spectrum of 
approaches.
Self-starter: Has strong sense of when to take ownership and when to ask for 
help (managing up and down).
Communicator: Displays strong communication skills, both with customers 
and internal team.
Creative/conceptual: Skilled at translating many moving pieces and constraints 
into new, valuable solutions, products, or processes.
2. Choose the Right Candidate: Identify the  
Characteristics Needed for the CM role You’ve Defined
Once you’ve narrowed the field to people with the non-negotiable qualities 
above, you’ll have a group of candidates with the innate potential to be good 
community managers. At that point, you’ll need to understand what kind of 
role you’re filling and the specific responsibilities for that role.
Here’s an overview of all the functions that a CM could potentially fill in a 
company. It looks like a lot, but I’ll guide you through exercises at the end of 
this chapter and throughout the next chapter to choose the responsibilities 
that you actually need for your business. It won’t—and shouldn’t be—this 
entire list. Depending on your circumstances, a good CM should be able to 
do the following:
Create content.
• 
Increase online engagement (conversation, shares, click-
• 
throughs).
Integrate initiatives with other marketing campaigns and/or  
• 
initiatives.
Answer customer questions about products and services.
• 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
37
Manage online forums and social networks as extensions 
• 
of your existing customer service efforts.
Validate product ideas, features, and use cases.
• 
Use forums, chats, and platforms to crowd-source  
• 
feedback, requests, and complaints.
Serve in a market research function.
• 
Coordinate with product managers, user experience 
• 
(UX) designers, and engineers.
Generate business development leads.
• 
Support prospects through the sales pipeline.
• 
Create more touch points and conversations with  
• 
partnership and client prospects.
Once you understand which functions your CM will need to fill and which are 
the most critical or add the most value to your audience and business, look 
at the personality characteristics mentioned above and the experience men-
tioned below to weigh uneven candidates against each other to determine 
who’s the best natural fit for the role and the organization.
Experience
Here’s a rundown of the kind of experience you should be looking for.
Education or training: The success of startups who hire based on talent and 
personality have decreased the importance of a college degree, but this 
will vary from brand to brand. People who have studied communications, 
journalism, or marketing will have foundational knowledge of what the CM 
role entails.
Work experience: The amount of experience needed varies depending on 
level of responsibility. Writing a job description, the business of the next chapter, 
will help you assess the level of experience required.
Transferrable skills: One way to gain a CM with valuable work experience is 
to be open to candidates making a career change. Here’s a short list of profes-
sionals who can transcend industries.
Writers who have been displaced by the onset of the 
• 
digital sphere and downturn of the publishing industry.
Marketing/communications professionals with a freelance 
• 
or agency background.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal
38
Publicists who want a different format that makes use of 
• 
their skill set and love the immediacy and timeliness of 
social community interaction.
Customer service representatives across all fields.
• 
Industry context: While we’re on the subject, I should also point out that not 
all CM experience is created equal. Make sure that a candidate with previous 
CM credentials has worked in a relevant field (so they understand how to 
speak to the audience) and developed the skills that are relevant to the role 
you have designed.
For example, if a person worked as a CM for a tech startup, but is vying for a 
role at a large, established, corporate brand, there’s a very different industry 
context. Ask yourself if the gaps can be bridged through training.
A WORD ABOUT EXPERIENCE 
“10 years of social media experience needed…” NOT! I’ve seen this in job descriptions 
and, as someone who has been in the field for more than a decade, most of the folks 
with that much experience aren’t going to take on a community manager role in the 
mid-part of their career. It’s just not realistic. For example, a VP of Customer Experience 
role for a larger organization would be more in line for the few high-demand people with 
that kind of experience. It’s important to keep expectations in line with your budget and 
needs. As I mentioned above, you can create a professional development plan that 
nurtures a junior hire and expands the role over time to suit your needs.
If you define the community manager as a robust, more senior role, you can hire a 
person with more of the traits that have been developed with experience. Alternately, 
if you have to proceed with the community manager as a junior or mid-level role, you 
can prioritize the items on this list for the most immediate needs, and use the remaining 
points to frame a professional development plan for a junior hire. This would ensure 
growth for that role and for your company. #winwin
Exercises
We’ve discussed the evolution of the CM role, the various forms that it can 
take within your organization, and the many qualities that indicate a one-in-a-
million candidate. Let’s put all of that info to good use with a 2-part exercise 
for hiring managers.
Aspiring and current CMs should keep reading as well. I’ve also included 
a section of resources for self-assessment, networking, and professional 
development.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
39
For Hiring Managers
In the first chapter, you progressed through a series of internal organizational 
assessments. Let’s build on that information to prioritize the functions that a 
CM will need to fill to add the most value to your business. In the next chap-
ter, we’ll build on that to create a job description that addresses the specific 
gaps that this position should fill for your organization.
Here are the key insights you should have gained from Chapter 1 exercises (if not,  
go back and do your homework!):
1.	 What community means to various parts of your organization;
2.	 What community means to your customers;
3.	 What are the goals for your organization’s community; and
4.	 How do those goals align with overall business objectives?
Now, go through the list of key CM functions below—it’s the same one that 
appeared a few pages back—and circle the items that both your internal stake-
holders and external community members expect from the CM role.
Create content.
• 
Increase online engagement (conversation, shares, click-
• 
throughs).
Focus on general brand awareness.
• 
Integrate initiatives with other marketing campaigns and 
• 
initiatives.
Answering customer questions about products and services.
• 
Manage online forums and social networks as extension 
• 
of your existing customer service efforts.
Validate product ideas, features, and use cases.
• 
Use forums, chats, and platforms to crowd source feed-
• 
back, requests and complaints.
Serve in a market research function.
• 
Coordinate with product managers, UX designers, and 
• 
engineers.
Generate business development leads.
• 
Support prospects through the sales pipeline.
• 
Create more touch points and conversations with part-
• 
nership and client prospects.

Chapter 2 | Not All Communities Are Created Equal

Which of these functions best feed the business goals defined by the last two 
key insights at the beginning of this exercise? What are the goals for your 
organization’s community? How do those goals align with overall business 
objectives?
If none of the business and community objectives support each other, this is 
a sign that you need to revisit expectations for what the community manage-
ment team should be focused on.
Once all expectations are reasonably aligned, let’s move on to part two of this 
exercise: preliminary planning of the organizational structure for the CM role. 
Depending on which items you have circled, the role should fall mainly under 
one or two different departments as follows:
Marketing: This is both a strategic and responsive role that focuses on increas-
ing brand awareness and engagement.
Create content.
• 
Increase online engagement (conversation, shares,  
• 
click-throughs).
Focus on general brand awareness.
• 
Integrate initiatives with other marketing campaigns  
• 
and initiatives.
Customer Service: This is a highly responsive role that focuses on providing a 
high-quality customer experience.
Answering customer questions about products and services.
• 
Manage online forums and social networks as extension 
• 
of your existing customer service efforts.
Product Management: This is a strategic role that focuses on product testing 
and responsive iteration based on feedback.
Validate product ideas, features, and use cases.
• 
Use forums, chats, and platforms to crowd-source feed-
• 
back, requests and complaints.
Serve in a market research function.
• 
Coordinate with product managers, UX designers, and 
• 
engineers.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
41
Sales: This is an active role that focuses on increasing direct communications 
with potential clients, investors, and partners.
Generate business development leads.
• 
Support prospects through the sales pipeline.
• 
Create more touch points and conversations with  
• 
partnership and client prospects.
For Community Managers
Whether you’re an aspiring CM or already holding the position, it’s important 
to understand your core competencies, how they apply to the job you’re 
doing (or want to be doing), and how to acquire the additional skills that you 
need to do the best job possible.
There are a number of self-assessment tools on the market. Here’s a short list 
of my favorites, covering an array of price points:

Find Your Own Communities
Meetup.com is a great place to find groups centered on your interests. 
Wherever you are based, login and search for CM groups. Don’t just go by 
number of members. Check if the people are engaged by reading the com-
ments for the group and each event (and how often events are planned). There 
are active groups in San Francisco (SF Community Managers) and New York 
(New York CM Meetup and We Support NY) as well as groups in Chicago, 
Austin, Melbourne, and around the rest of the world.
Check LinkedIn and Google+ for online CM communities that you can access 
from anywhere in the world (at least anywhere with internet accessibility!). 
One vibrant community, that I’m personally active in is CMX. You can join the 
CMX Insider mailing list at CMXHub.com to get updates or become an member 
of the Facebook group, where thousands of community managers gather and 
share best practices.

On Twitter, seek out other CMs to soak up the knowledge and lingo from 
people in the trenches every day. Here are a few of my favorite hashtags to 
comb through:
#twitchat
• 
#mobilechat
• 
#cmgrchat
• 
Speaking of social media, use it! Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, 
Whatever Future Cool Thing That Just Launched. This is the world that CMs 
inhabit, so live in it. Get familiar with the different ways people interact on 
each channel. This understanding will guide your communications and strat-
egy, helping you to reach out to your audience with authenticity.
CASE STUDY: CRUNCH
One of the most valuable things that my boss, who headed up Customer Service out 
of Crunch’s Atlanta Call Center, did for me in my first weeks as Crunch’s Community 
Supervisor (working in New York’s HQ) was to introduce me to the regional heads of 
operations and sales, as a resource to help them achieve their goals.
Who wouldn’t want someone in my position helping them achieve their department’s 
objectives and benchmarks? Exactly! With the goal of providing value and helping these 
two executives, by making meaningful contributions towards their goals, we set a weekly 
meeting to discuss operations, sales, and community. Bringing these three initiatives 
together supported the type of prospect and customer engagement in the field that 
Crunch needed to grow. It also helped promote the connectivity at the corporate office 
to help support execution and continuity inside each of the 10 New York locations.
So then what happened? I started engaging internally with the marketing team. Having 
the insight into Crunch’s largest regions’ operational and sales needs, I was able to 
contribute and provide the business lens to our weekly marketing meetings and to my 
own community initiatives.
Why was that so helpful? I know it doesn’t sound like rocket science, but often the 
internal connectivity is hard to get into alignment. And the bigger the organization 
the harder it is. Not only did I understand what my counterparts and higher ups in 
other business departments were trying to achieve and what they needed to do, 
I also built an informal internal community to connect me to the right people before I 
needed them. This gave me tremendous knowledge of the business and helped give 
me the context to piece together insights in the community with business objectives 
and initiatives.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
43
Having a remote boss had its perks and pitfalls. For instance at Crunch, I was reporting 
to Marketing out of Crunch’s New York HQ and to the Customer Service Center out of 
the satellite office in Atlanta, which gave me visibility into both worlds. Furthermore, 
my boss had great reach into regional management and individual club management 
because customer service supported both, and thus I had the access and partnership 
to work with both as well. In hindsight, this may have been originally set up to give me 
a local “boss” in addition to my real boss in Atlanta. For her, I served as the eyes, ears, 
and feet on the ground in HQ. This solution may have originally been for HR purposes 
but it enabled me to be hyper cross-functional.
This Chapter Is History
From its diverse foundation in traditional marketing, technology, and housing 
management; community management has evolved dramatically in the last few 
years. A good CM is worth his or her weight in gold for the seemingly magical 
abilities to turn disasters into triumphs, inspire brand loyalty, and transform 
customers into full-blow evangelists.
Spoiler alert: it’s not magic. The hiring manager, organization, and CM need to 
work together to set realistic goals and expectations, implement a solid plan, 
and continue to grow the role as the needs of the company grow. The first 
step to creating this business alchemy is defining the type of role needed and 
identifying the right candidates to fill that specific role.
This chapter should have equipped you with the know-how to build a strong 
foundation for a highly successful CM. The practical exercises will yield:
For hiring managers
A prioritized list of traits to seek during the interviewing 
• 
process.
A preliminary understanding of the org structure for the 
• 
CM role.
For community managers
Resources for self-assessment to identify key strengths 
• 
to build upon and skills to acquire.
Communities to meet and learn from other CMs.
• 
Armed with this information, it’s time to dive deep into the hiring process.

How to Fill or Secure the Role of a  
Community Manager
Now that you are armed with knowledge of the core personality traits and 
skills that are key to success in a CM role, it’s time to focus on the details.
The first part of this chapter will explore job descriptions geared towards 
the major roles that CMs can play at different types of companies. For hiring 
managers, we’ll dissect the job descriptions to show how each CM variation 
adds value, gauge if that version is the best value for your particular company, 
and compile these insights into a targeted job description that fits your needs. 
For current and would-be CMs, I’ll help you identify the type of CM you are 
or want to be, determine which companies to target (those most likely to be 
hiring for type of CM job you want), and explore ways to bridge any gaps in 
experience or skills.
The second part of this chapter will provide detailed information for the 
recruitment process. Hiring managers will learn how to optimize the hiring 
process by selecting the right resumes, conducting phone pre-screens, and 
identifying must-have traits throughout recruitment efforts. CMs will gain an 
understanding of how to promote key strengths, align them with job descrip-
tions, and prepare thoroughly for every stage of recruitment.
Choose Wisely
As we dive into the topic of hiring, I want to stress again the importance of 
taking your time with this process.
I know how it is for hiring managers: there’s a long list of priorities that were 
due yesterday, and you need to hire someone who can hit the ground running

Chapter 3 | Hired!

to start checking off those tasks. But remember that you’ll only be happy with 
the results if you choose the right someone. The CM role is a high exposure 
position within any company; this person is your ambassador, your spokes-
person, and your conduit to the outside world! Make sure they’re what your 
company really needs, and wants, by taking the time to hire and cultivate the 
right person.
For CM job seekers out there, take a deep breath and hold your ground for 
the right fit. This may mean the right type of CM role, so that you gain the 
experience you need to continue in the direction you want, or the right kind 
of company culture where you are set up for success. Remember: you are an 
asset and vital to the success of your team. To do the best possible job, you 
need to place yourself in the situation that best suits your needs and goals.
Jack or Jill of All Trades?
More than any other job in a modern organization, the CM role is multi-faceted 
and touches most areas of the business. In my experience, the only people in a 
company with more exposure to the entire organization are human resources 
personnel and top-management executives in an established company, or 
members of a founding team in a startup.
In the last chapter we discussed the “The Mind of a Community Manager” and 
the natural traits and instincts you should be looking for in the hiring process. 
Now we’ll look at how those attributes and characteristics link to an actual 
job that needs to be done. Before we dive into specific job descriptions, let’s 
review all the roles that a community manager can be expected to play.
The key responsibilities of an online community manager1 can include:
• 
Platform management. This may mean managing an 
online platform where you host your community. That 
would include setting strategy and coordinating with 
product development. For those who won’t be managing 
a community platform, this means staying current with all 
major social platforms, as well as new products that can 
be utilized for hosting and supporting your community. 
It’s also important to keep up with technological advance-
ments, security breaches, or potential product optimiza-
tions that can be built into your existing platforms.
1Responsibilities inspired by ZDNet blogger Dion Hinchcliffe.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
• 
Project management. You may be responsible for 
projects that are part of a bigger product launch or mar-
keting initiative within your company. This would require 
project management skills to coordinate with other 
teams to meet launch deadlines, stay within project bud-
gets, and support the rest of the initiative.
• 
Product management. Some CMs are an integral 
part of the product development process, especially at a 
tech startup or within a software company. This kind of 
responsibility means looking at bigger picture stuff, like 
the product road map (features and functionality and the 
prioritization of both), product feasibility testing, defining 
what a minimum viable product (MVP) would look like, 
market research inputs (discovery or validation needed 
to confirm product needs), etc. This is where a long-
term vision on product and community can support one 
another.
• 
Customer management. You need to understand and 
know your customers’ needs and how you will address 
them. This entails anticipating and remedying existing 
issues, and collecting what community members are saying 
as part of your “listening surveys” so that you don’t miss 
out on important needs and pain points. This can mean 
interfacing with customer service or relations internally 
or may mean collaborating with a cross functional team 
to bring people together throughout your company, to 
understand the internal needs or gather internal insight 
to address community needs. Although we are focused 
on “online community management,” physical community 
management, via events and other in-person customer 
interactions like in-store, is an important aspect you may 
be involved with.
• 
Professional development. You need to be keeping 
up with your industry (in general) as well as with the CM 
profession specifically. This means keeping up with your 
contacts, in addition to attending events, talks, and other 
industry events. You never know what you don’t know if 
you don’t show up, and these can present opportunities 
to be sure that you are up to date on CM best practices 
and industry trends.

• 
Brand management. You need to support and promote 
the brand in everything you do as a community manager. 
It’s important to remember that this includes managing 
the brand in times of bad PR or in response to criticisms 
or complaints. Driving home the brand promise and how 
you’re upholding this is crucial to how you respond to 
situations in your community.
• 
Advertising and marketing. You’ll need to be listen-
ing to your market and understanding what is going on. 
Know your audience, what they expect from you, and 
how those needs might grow and change.
• 
Staff development. You’ll likely need to grow your CM 
role to that of a team if you’re successful in setting up 
your initiative and proving the business value to the orga-
nization. You’ll need to recruit and hire your team, train 
them, and then ensure they receive ongoing support and 
education to keep your efforts top tier.
• 
Business planning. The things that are necessary to build  
a community will cost your company money (as well as 
make it some!). Being able to plan out the costs and reve-
nues can help you sell your ideas up the line and convince 
higher-ups that the value added is significant enough to 
warrant building your community. The CM may need to 
be a part of the bigger business-planning picture, as the 
in-depth knowledge of the customer the CM has is vital 
to this process. A growing organization needs to stay on 
top of technology thanks to the rate of change in the 
business landscape brought on by technology.
• 
Community management. This is of course core to 
the role but in some organizations, other roles like prod-
uct management may be primary. Keeping a finger on the 
pulse of what is going on in your community is crucial to 
being a community manager. You set the tone for what is 
acceptable, what it means to be in the community, and 
what the identity of the brand is. You need to insure that 
you get the right people to participate, stay engaged, and 
keep them happy.
• 
Content management. You’ll need to develop an under-
standing of each digital platform where you can create com-
munity value (whether it be Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, 
Tumblr, blogs, forums, etc.), make strategic decisions con-
cerning where you want to have a presence, and develop a 
content calendar around those platforms and objectives.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
As you can see, there are a number of responsibilities an online community 
manager must take on these days. If you’re not sure which ones are the most 
important for your organization, go back to the organization prioritization 
exercise in Chapter 1. You’ll also want to note the candidate priorities in 
Chapter 2 and the associated exercise. If you’ve got those two items under 
control, let’s move on to how you can customize the community management 
discipline to fit your organization.
INTERVIEW WITH SHIRLEY CHAN 
HEAD OF CM, CS, AND CONTENT AT QUIRKY
I was first hired as a CM at Quirky and within a couple weeks began building out 
the customer service team. Within a year, I also headed up content and community 
management because the three disciplines were so interconnected. Quirky is a 
community of inventors, a platform where community members can submit ideas 
for products that don’t exist in the real world. The end consumer gets to design and 
essentially validate the product. Think of those ideas you have for products, “If only they 
made ____ to make ____ better…” That’s what Quirky does: it gives normal people the 
ability to join every part of the industrial design process.
As one of the first hires of a rapidly growing startup, I encountered challenges that I 
never imagined and gained tremendous experience and knowledge through it. Initially, 
I was hired to build community relationships across our social media channels and our 
forum, but the role quickly expanded. About two or three weeks into my job, customer 
service demands grew exponentially with the launch of Quirky’s first major product  
(an iPad cover called Cloak that had hidden kickstands and other features designed by 
its community of inventors). In order to properly serve both the inventor community and 
the influx of customers, I became responsible for customer service.
One of the biggest challenges in managing the Quirky community was to set and 
communicate expectations about the collaboration process and the overall product 
development lifecycle. Community members, our inventors, were getting frustrated 
because they expected products to come to market much faster than was realistic 
(product development takes two or more years in traditional corporations, a lifetime 
in the digital era) and to have transparency into the production process. Community 
members were not product development experts, so it fell on Quirky to educate them 
about the complexity of the development cycle and industrial design. Content creation 
was a big part of my solution. Because of this, my role of managing customer service 
and customer relationships expanded again to include content creation and educating 
the public.

Chapter 3 | Hired!
50
Overseeing all three—CM, CS, and content—allowed me to develop a holistic approach. 
I worked with our product development team to create content to educate and explain 
the process to the community. We also used Get Satisfaction to create a community-
driven FAQ. As community members learned more about the Quirky process and  
its complexities, the veterans would help me “onboard” new inventors because they 
wanted to share the knowledge they had gained. We created a self-perpetuating 
education cycle.
As is common in many startups, my goals and metrics were not clearly defined when I 
came on board. I was tasked with increasing the size and quality of the community as 
Quirky grew. We knew success was tied to the collective intelligence of the community 
who helped originate product ideas and evolve them through the design phase of 
production. With the experience I have now, I would use that understanding to define 
clear objectives, strategy, and tactical plans to learn and grow even more.
I learned that customer service is a balance. As a community manager, it is important 
to understand what is making customers upset and how to guide the conversation in a 
positive way that will be healthy for both the community and the brand. There is a lot of 
pressure to make decisions that have a short-term positive effect on fixing an issue, but 
you always need to also consider the bigger picture. It was an incredible learning and 
growing experience for me.
Customizing Community Management for  
Your Company
Although it would be nice to find someone who’s an expert in everything, 
it’s not realistic unless you have budgeted for a highly experienced maven 
to come on board. This doesn’t mean you can’t get someone who will add 
immense value to your company—it just means you have to think critically 
about what it is that you actually need.
Aspiring CMs, don’t despair! You don’t need to be an expert in all these 
aspects. You just need to understand what you do have to offer, which types 
of CM roles you want or are suited for, and how you can grow into a job.
We’ll take it one job description at a time, so I can break it down for you.
Job Descriptions
Each description in this section gives insight into one common way that 
the CM role is defined within organizations. At the end of each description,  
I provide a summary and specific notes that are relevant to hiring managers 
and CMs.

51
The Community Manager’s Playbook
I’ve organized the information this way so that you get the insights at the  
same time as you’re reading each description. These points will tie back to 
earlier lessons covered in Chapter 2, so that you have real-life examples of 
what I meant.
Read the descriptions to see if you naturally gravitate towards any. The sum-
mary and discussion points will break down the reasons for needing or filling 
each function. Compare them with your instinctive choices.

  For our purposes, in this section we are only focusing on full-time, on-site roles. Part-time 
isn’t addressed because you can always scale this role back or split someone’s time within your 
current organization between CM and another role if need be to get started. As you see from the 
responsibilities listed above and the role deep dive in Chapter 2, community manager is a large, 
highly complex role and it’s hard enough to get the job tackled in full-time hours, let alone cutting it 
down to half time.
It’s also best to avoid outsourcing CM. The reasoning is simple: you water down the results and 
your relationship with your community and/or customers. Neither adds or creates value for your 
organization or end goal, so do it right and bring someone on to your core team for this important, 
high-impact, high-touch role.

Takeaways
This type of role is often needed at later-stage startups and requires key func-
tions like driving engagement, producing content, and working with internal 
teams to produce creative marketing initiatives.
Hiring Managers: Do you know who your target audience is, and how a CM 
can support reaching and engaging that audience? If you do, this could be the 
right CM role for your company.
CMs: Which communities are you a part of in your personal life? Highlight 
that type of innate experience when relevant to a job posting (in this case, 
“fashion”).

CM Job #2
Early-stage startup needs CM to combine customer service and 
engagement. Company B is an eCommerce subscription service that relies 
on providing exceptional experiences to grow and maintain its customer base. 
The ideal candidate would engage with community members across a number 
of channels and brainstorm creative ways to ensure overall satisfaction.
Responsibilities:
Answer questions by phone and email about products 
• 
and services.
Resolve customer satisfaction issues with a positive tone.
• 
Act as brand ambassador and keep customers engaged

Takeaways
This role combines skills in customer service, community engagement, and 
performance tracking. It is interesting to note that social media is not included 
in this description (and is likely handled by someone in marketing, so be sure 
to ask and meet the person while interviewing.) This role will likely work 
closely with the marketing team to provide a rich customer experience.
Hiring Managers: This is a junior position, but it will have a huge impact in how 
your company is perceived by its initial customer base. Focus on personal 
judgment, communication skills (both written and spoken), and personality in 
interviews.
CMs: This is a great foot-in-the-door type of role to demonstrate that you 
can engage community members and represent a brand publicly. Highlight any 
customer service roles that you’ve held and let your natural personality shine 
through.

Large corporation needs CM to provide customer service and brand 
experience. Company C has made a corporate commitment to consider-
ing the customer’s perspective in all key decisions. The CM will oversee this 
initiative across the enterprise to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and 
business performance. The person in this position will champion the cus-
tomer by acting as a change agent for internal culture, and by closing the loop 
between customer feedback and company responsiveness.
Responsibilities:
Define and execute on a customer relationship program.
• 
Monitor and engage with community across online 
• 
channels.
Train and manage associates on customer-centric best 
• 
practices relevant to their responsibilities.

• 
and then translate them into actionable items.
Understanding of creative and web production, SEO, and

digital advertising as relates to customer experience.
Takeaways
While this CM role also fills a customer service function, I wanted to show 
how different the needs can be at a large, established corporation instead of 
a startup. This company is highlighting experience in managing customer rela-
tionship programs, which help coordinate efforts in a larger company. The abil-
ity to run workshops shows a commitment to creating a fully customer-centric

culture, by teaching every team how it can add to the customer experience, 
even if it’s not a team that deals directly with customer service.
Hiring Managers: In addition to the innate qualities needed for customer contact 
(personal judgment, communication skills, and personality), focus on candi-
dates’ ability to think strategically by asking how they approached problems 
and arrived at solutions in past projects.
CMs: This role requires more experience than a customer-facing position in 
a startup, because the CM will have to manage the efforts of teams across 
the company to provide cohesive customer support. Highlight your ability to 
think on your feet, identify creative solutions, inspire people from different 
backgrounds, and apply business insights in a strategic manner.

Excellent communication skills.
• 
Takeaways
Company D needs someone with traditional marketing, events planning, and 
social media skills to fill its CM role. The key goal is to build and retain the 
user base. This CM will be asked to test a wide variety of strategies, with a 
strong focus on turning users into evangelists, and learning what works for 
this company, therefore a strong strategic planning background is important.
Hiring Managers: This is a position that needs both an aggressive focus on user 
acquisition and a thoughtful approach to customer retention. When discuss-
ing candidates’ past marketing strategy work, ask about the thought process 
behind the work. This will help you identify people who understand how to 
nurture the user base beyond pure acquisition.
CMs: This is a mid-level role that requires real-world experience building the 
user base. Go beyond listing your experience by explaining your approach to 
identifying key target audiences and gaining traction among those groups.
CM Job #5
Membership organization requires customer experience manage-
ment, online and offline. Company E is seeking a Community Manager to

mission.
Proven track record in online and offline campaigns to 
• 
boost membership engagement.
Proven experience working in a highly collaborative, 
• 
entrepreneurial environment.
Ability to juggle multiple projects with multiple creative 
• 
teams.
Takeaways
This job description captures a lot of what people and companies often think 
of when they hear “community manager” because it involves talking to people 
online (in forums and across social media channels) and offline at events. The 
work involves a lot more strategic thought than merely socializing, but people 
who are good at this make it look natural and effortless. You can tell a bad fit 
by the results: an angry or frustrated community who leaves.
Hiring Managers: This role should be filled by a strategic thinker with strong 
natural social and communication skills. Look for a positive outlook and 
dynamic personality during interviews.
CMs: Because a role like this requires a huge amount of interaction with the 
community, demonstrate the innate qualities needed to excel long-term: be 
outgoing, friendly, social, warm and thoughtful. Tie those qualities to a devel-
oping ability to think strategically, and you will make a strong impression.

Experience with crisis management and liaising with a wide 
• 
range of stakeholders, including clients and other agencies.
Quantitative and qualitative analytical skills to interpret 
• 
data and create actionable recommendations that address 
client goals.
Takeaways
In addition to in-house roles for CMs, digital agencies are increasingly hiring 
to meet demands made by their clients. Unless it’s a very junior role, agency 
positions usually require prior agency experience that has trained candidates 
to juggle multiple priorities and brand styles because they work with multiple 
clients. This requires a strategic understanding of both social media usage and 
brand voice.
Hiring Managers: Luckily, the innate skill set needed for CMs (personal judg-
ment, communication skills, and personality) will also indicate success in cli-
ent-facing roles. Search for variety in writing samples to show ability to switch 
brand voices. In interviews, identify candidates’ ability to think strategically by 

59

asking how they align social media and community management solutions with 
bigger picture business goals.
Community Managers: If you have in-house experience and want to tackle an 
agency role, your biggest hurdle will be demonstrating that you can juggle 
multiple client priorities. Highlight the variety in your work samples, your  
ability to work under pressure with different teams internally, and your  
strategic thinking about how social media and community management help 
achieve bigger picture business goals.

Takeaways
I hope your warning bells are going off because this example was a test! This 
company is asking someone to assume responsibilities in everything from user 
acquisition and social media marketing to business landscape analysis and cus-
tomer service . . . but is only asking for one year of experience.
Unless there is a solid plan to train and professionally develop the person in 
this role, these expectations are way out of line. Mistakes made by a junior 
hire with no structured support can be very public and reflect poorly on the 
brand. Essentially, these types of expectations are like thinking Superwoman 
exists and she not only knows it all, but also does it all. Let’s set our CMs up 
for success, shall we?
Hiring Managers: This is your opportunity to spark internal conversation about 
what expectations really are or should be and revise job description accord-
ingly. Follow the exercises in Chapters 1 and 2 to drive those talks.
If your hands really are tied right now, then look for a career changer with 
good experience in another field and transferrable skills that apply to this role. 
However, you will still need a solid plan in place to train this person and set 
guidelines to ensure that the brand will be represented well. Long-term, the 
exercises in Chapters 1 and 2 should be followed to craft the right CM role 
for your company and align expectations internally.

61
The Community Manager’s Playbook
CMs: Chances are, a company that posts a job description like this will be 
throwing its new hire directly into the deep end to sink or swim. If you are 
hungry to learn and excited by this type of opportunity, highlight your entre-
preneurial instincts to dive in and create process as you go. However, I strongly 
advise you to negotiate for support (training and development budget, regular 
status meetings with relevant stakeholders) and recognition (e.g., increase in 
title, salary, or benefits) based on your performance.
Now Go Write the CM Job Description
Seven job descriptions later, you now should have a strong understanding of 
the good, the bad, and the ugly, when it comes to writing up the role of a CM. 
Hopefully, the additional takeaways and commentary have given you insight 
into the things the seasoned CMs you want to attract to your organization 
are looking for and how to set reasonable and attainable expectations.
One overarching recommendation I would make in having looked at hundreds 
of CM job descriptions would be to include a clear primary and secondary 
objective for how CM is expected to contribute to the organization with 
clear benchmarks and measurements for success. There’s no better way to 
identify the right candidate than to see if they’re confident in achieving the 
organization’s objectives and their confidence in being able to achieve the 
desired outcome.
Hire the Right CM
The first step for hiring managers is to define the type of CM role that’s right 
for your company.
In the job description section, we explored how each potential CM function 
adds specific value. Try reading the descriptions again to see if you naturally 
gravitate towards any. The summary and discussion points will break down 
the reasons for needing each function. Compare those reasons with your 
business objectives. Compile the responsibilities (and related requirements) 
into a targeted job description that fits your needs.
Note: Beware of the “kid in a candy store” tendency to want it all in a CM. 
Even if you have the budget for such a robust role, it may not be money well 
spent if those functions don’t map to business goals. And worst case, as high-
lighted in the last sample job description, it exposes a systemic disconnect 
between expectations and reality.

Chapter 3 | Hired!
62
Note: While defining CM needs, it’s important to also look at the stage of 
your company and community. Organizational needs shift with each stage. For 
example:
In an established community, the focus will be on elevating 
• 
and improving existing activities. The CM will be review-
ing the strategic foundation and assessing past and recent 
tactical execution and performance.
In a new community, the focus will be on discovery and 
• 
validation of the community and its product, service, or 
purpose. The CM will be focused on identifying strategic 
the foundation and planning for tactical execution.
Setting up the CM Role for Success
Building on the CM job description you have just created, it’s time to think 
through the structure that supports it. In Chapter 2, we ran you through 
an exercise for preliminary organizational planning. Where will your CM fit 
into your organization? Did you choose marketing, customer service, product 
development, sales, or some combination of these?
Take a look at your new job description. Do most of the responsibilities align 
with the teams that you have envisioned as owning community management? 
If they do, you’re in great shape! If not, it’s time to have an internal discussion 
about shifting expectations. After all, the description you wrote is mapped 
to long-term business goals. You want to lay the groundwork for setting that 
role up to succeed.

Community management is an emerging and fast-growing profession, espe-
cially given the growth of branded online communities, corporate blogs and

faint of heart. It’s dynamic, fast paced, and multi-disciplinary. Can you hack it?
If you’re a current CM looking for a new role or an aspiring to be CM: You

How to Build Your Credentials and Portfolio
In addition to the advice provided with each specific job description, there 
are a lot of general best practices aspiring and developing CMs can use to get 
noticed. These are actions you can take to develop the skills hiring managers 
will want to see in you.
Strategic approach: Know (or learn) how to conduct an online “listening study” 
(see Chapter 7). Ideally, conduct one to demonstrate your use of the available 
listening tools and your ability to glean actionable insights.
Team collaboration and management experience: If you don’t already have this 
experience, volunteering to run a campaign for a local charity using a combi-
nation of events and social media can provide a nice, trackable portfolio case 
study while showing your ability to manage a project and collaborate with 
internal marketing contacts and volunteers.
Communication skills: Using a sample campaign is a great opportunity to show-
case your communication and conversation facilitation. You could do a pro 
bono project, one for yourself, or mock up a sample to help you create port-
folio pieces if you don’t have a community to use. Be sure to present screen 
shots or examples to reference your experience when you’re interviewing.
Content creation: Create your own blog and social media campaign on the most 
important channels to show your ability to tell a story and build a following. 
It’s also a great approach to talking about your own expertise that you can 
point potential employers to.
Public speaking: Some community managers are called on to do events that 
include making introductions or speaking. Having this experience or taking 
public speaking, stand-up comedy, or improv classes will help your resume 
stand out from the crowd (in addition to being a lot of fun).
Media contacts: If you know what industry you’re targeting, building some rel-
evant blogger or media contacts can give you a nice leg up in the interviewing 
process. One way to get your foot in the door is to begin blogging on a pro 
bono basis. You can look for opportunities via industry websites, Mediabistro 
or Craigslist ads, or by sending in inquiries to smaller publications.

What Do I Need to Know and to Prepare for the 
Interview Process?
There are a couple things that you’ll need to do to prepare. Let’s walk through the 
individual steps and stages of preparation.
Before you respond to a job opportunity: Know what you bring to the table and 
draw connections between your own skills and experience and the needs of 
the audience the community in question serves.
Before you start interviewing for jobs: Brush up on, and work through, scenario 
planning for common online community management happenings as well  
as how those scenarios connect to in-person, mobile, and location (events, 
retail, etc.) experiences.
Before you accept an offer: Agree on what your objectives will be and how 
they’ll serve your audience as well as the business. Define how both your 
performance and that of the community will be evaluated. Make sure 
you understand what the corporate culture is like and whether it is a fit for 
you. Being a CM, you will be highly engaged across the organization; you want 
to feel comfortable with the environment and the people you’ll be collaborat-
ing with.
Toolbox
In collaboration with Jovena Whatmoor,2 an expert in tech recruitment, career 
counseling, and employment branding, we’ve created two sets of tools: one for 
job seekers and one for hiring managers.
For the purposes of this chapter, I felt these “toolboxes” provided more value 
than guided exercises. As with any self-guided materials, you get the most out 
of it when you put a lot in, so I encourage you to do your best. This piece 
lays the foundation for success: you can’t have good community management 
without a good community manager. There’s just no faking it.
Good luck!
Tools for Aspiring CMs
Since you’re new to the game, let’s set you up with the tips and tricks you 
need to know for your cover letter and resume, and some professional devel-
opment next steps to set you on your way.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
Cover letter tips:
Don’t use templates. Write custom cover letters for 
• 
each position (many startups want to see your personal-
ity too).
Map your experience to the key requirements from job 
• 
posting (either reference direct experience or explain 
how you have a transferrable skill).
Eliminate any sentences that do not contain relevant 
• 
information.
Provide links to LinkedIn, your personal blog, and any 
• 
social media accounts that demonstrate you are digital 
savvy (but make sure you check how employer-friendly 
your content is first).
Use a unique design layout (make it relevant to the  
• 
brand style).
Study the company’s site and social presence, then reflect 
• 
their brand voice back in the letter (this shows you can 
do one of the most important parts of the CM job).
Express genuine enthusiasm.
• 
Resume makeover tips:
Include the keywords used in the job posting (a lot of 
• 
companies use third-party hiring sites, which scan resumes 
for keywords before a human ever sees it).
Condense the information to pack a powerful punch: 
• 
cut the fluff and be direct in your language. Quantify and 
qualify your experiences.
Reorganize headings and structure for maximum impact. 
• 
Add some color or descriptors to your headings that 
coach people through your experience and the positions 
on your resume.
Reorganize bullet points. Lead with experiences that are 
• 
most relevant based on what they are asking for.
Professional development tips:
Find a job description that feels like your “dream job.”
• 
Highlight all the responsibilities and requirements.
• 

Chapter 3 | Hired!

Make a list of the gaps in your experience.
• 
Seek out classes, workshops, volunteer experiences, intern-
• 
ships, and other opportunities for bridging those gaps.
If the CM role you want requires a good deal of blog writing or social media 
presence, start doing those things in your personal life to learn how to use 
those tools
Tools for Hiring Managers
The field of CM is just emerging, and hiring managers are always asking me, 
especially in class at General Assembly: how do I hire for this role? Like any 
other recruitment, it’s a process. Let’s walk through the hiring process, inter-
view preparation, and screening candidates. I’ll even throw in some questions 
that I use when vetting a CM for a client at Perks Consulting.
Hiring process:
1.	 Resume review. Contact candidates who match posted 
requirements.
2.	 Phone pre-screen. Use questions below to test candi-
dates for the basic must-have traits.
Why do you want to be a community manager?
• 
Why would you like to do this job at our company?
• 
How many hours does a CM work? You’re looking to 
• 
get a sense of what they expect the general hours to 
be and how they will manage the community during 
their non-office hours. If they don’t get this question, 
ask about 24/7 approaches to foster conversation 
and following up on questions.
What communities have you managed? What was 
• 
your approach?
3.	 In-person interviews. Schedule with direct managers, 
direct co-workers, and indirect co-workers to gauge 
competency and culture fit.
Interview preparation:
Good CM candidates are in high demand in this competi-
• 
tive digital landscape, so interviews often go both ways. 
The best CMs by nature should be inquisitive and ask a 
lot of questions. Expect the candidate to scrutinize you as 
much as she is scrutinizing you.

67
The Community Manager’s Playbook
Represent your company, its mission, and culture fully.
• 
Give the candidate your full attention, whether the inter-
• 
view is taking place on phone or in person.
Start the interview on time.
• 
Be open and helpful if there’s a lag in the conversation. 
• 
(But stay silent after asking a difficult question; don’t let 
the potential CM off the hook.)
Use these interview questions based on the must-have CM traits that are 
important to your organization:
Connector: What role do you play in your friend circle? 
In your family?
Goal: To understand their communication style and the 
role they play in their existing social and professional 
circles. Natural connectors and communication lead-
ers will give you examples of how they’re a connec-
tor without necessarily saying “I’m a connector. Here’s 
how I go about it.”
Conversation starter: Do you network? Participate in 
groups, clubs, or industry associations? Which ones? 
How do they add value? What kind of events do you 
go to?
Ask for examples. How do they approach interacting in 
groups? Walking into a new setting at work or an event?
Perhaps ask, how do you start conversations? Interrupt 
one that’s in motion? Exit? Build or continue one that’s 
losing steam?
Goal: Understand some recent scenarios they’ve been 
in to see if they have the ability to start, interject, and 
carry conversations naturally. Alternatively, do group 
interviews. Group interviews with interactive scenar-
ios can be a great way of weeding out those who are 
natural connectors and communicators against those 
who are not. In these scenarios, I have seen impres-
sive proactive “hosting”-like skills come out from 
candidates I may have dismissed. I’ve also found that 
some of the most outgoing people in a one-on-one 
scenario are not always the ones that thrive in a group 
environment.

Personal Alignment: What are your personal hobbies?
What do you read outside of work-related resources?
What motivates you?
Goal: Here you are trying to discover if this person 
is a good fit for your community (topic, audience, 
purpose).
Summary
We’ve looked at how to set up the community discipline for success, and how 
to hire (or secure) the CM role. Now let’s look at how community manage-
ment adds value across the organization.

How Community 
Creates Business 
Value
Use Community to Leverage Many-to-Many 
Communication 
Part 1 of The Community Manager’s Playbook is designed to give you a solid 
foundation for understanding community management from three key  
perspectives: an executive/founder, a hiring manager, and the actual community 
manager.
So far, we’ve explored the background and history of community management, 
the different ways a community manager could fit into your organization, how 
to develop the right type of role for your business, and how to get hired as a 
community manager.
Woven through this foundation and background is the fact that companies 
now need community to succeed in the digital world. Leveraging the many-
to-many interaction of customers, employees, or other stakeholder groups is 
essential for optimal and efficient engagement. This is a fundamental concept 
to me and my team at Perks Consulting, and it is being adopted by many ven-
ture capital investors in the Valley (California) and even the Alley (New York). 
But some people need convincing.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
70
In this chapter, I explain why strategic community management building is 
vital—no matter what kind of business you own, manage, or work for. Just as 
important, I explain how to leverage it for creating value within your organiza-
tion. You’ll gain an in-depth overview of brand and business alignment because 
I want to show that community is integral to every part of the business build-
ing and management process. By the end of this chapter, you may feel like 
you’ve earned a micro-MBA with a focus on winning through customer and 
stakeholder engagement!
Customer First, but How?
Whether your business sells directly to individuals or serves other companies, 
you have customers. In order to survive and have lasting success as an organi-
zation, you need to take care of those customers.
It’s easy to give lip service to a customer-first philosophy, but many companies 
fall short of delivering on that promise. Usually, it’s not because they don’t 
care, but because they don’t do one or more of the following:
Understand what their customers want and need
• 
Know how to listen for and apply customer feedback 
• 
and/or insights into existing business initiatives
Adapt fast enough to deliver what their customers want 
• 
and need
Community management bridges the gap between a customer-first ­policy 
and the real-world logistics of bringing that policy to life (and for all 
stakeholders).
How do community managers do that? Well, I mentioned earlier that CMs 
are Jacks or Jills of all trades. They work closely with multiple departments 
and often support a wide range of initiatives. Here’s why this is important: 
Think of each department within a company as a separate way to “touch” the 
customer, directly or indirectly. These are the “touch points” of the customer 
journey, and they increase in number and complexity as a business grows.
For example, the customer service and marketing teams are in direct con-
tact with customers every day. Their words and actions make an immediate 
impact on the customer-brand relationship. This type of interaction is often 
considered the easy part of creating a customer-first policy. And community 
is a fantastic vehicle for not only supporting and developing the relationship 
but also delivering on a company’s “customer first” ambitions.
But what about your logistics or operations departments? The people on those 
teams rarely deal directly with customers, and yet their work directly affects 
how well products are made and how quickly customers receive their orders.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
71
If you’re working in a tech startup, your engineers or web development team 
likely never interacts with the public. But the work they produce— website, 
app, or mobile experience—is how most customers will get to know your 
company and determine whether they will pick you over the competition.
As you know, customer expectations have changed, especially in the past 
decade, and thus there is a huge need to incorporate customer feedback into 
every team’s work. While it can’t be everyone’s job to constantly talk to the 
customer, it can be everyone’s job to consistently ask, “Is this activity creating 
value for our customer? Or other stakeholders?” This simple frame of refer-
ence can help teams prioritize what to tackle. Creating an internal culture of 
customer orientation and working from a customer-centric mindset can pay 
huge dividends.
And in today’s super transparent, technology-enabled world, everyone in your 
organization has the ability to engage with your customers and key stake-
holders—and they don’t need anyone’s permission to do so. That’s why com-
munity managers are so important. Community managers translate customer 
comments and reactions into opportunities to create value and mitigate 
risk across the entire organization and in collaboration with all departments 
throughout a business.
In short, community managers take the essence of a customer-oriented  
perspective—doing business with the customer’s best interests and value 
creation in mind—and embeds it deep into an organization’s culture and 
process.

people in all corners of the organization. Heed them well and you will discover many new ways to 
satisfy—and keep—customers.
Think like a Brand. Act like a Startup.™
Community managers can achieve great things only if an organization is struc-
tured to help them succeed. With that in mind, let’s discuss how to shape a 
business for success in today’s digital economy.
I believe that big brands and innovative startups have powerful tools at their 
disposal. However, each side needs something that the other has: brands have 
stability but often move too slowly for our digital age; startups move quickly 
but often forget to address the brand-building work that forms a foundation 
for long-term success.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
72
At my firm, Perks Consulting, we’ve found that striking the balance between 
stability and agility is a must to compete regardless of organizational size, 
structure, or industry. We’ve leveraged our experience working with estab-
lished brands and bootstrap startups to incorporate the best of both brand 
and startup approaches into our core philosophy: Think like a Brand. Act like 
a Startup.
While I don’t have the space to cover the entire methodology, I want to share 
the parts that are most relevant to community management. Thinking like a 
brand is something I’ll also be covering in greater detail as we get into assess-
ing and establishing your strategic foundation in Part 2 of the book. Whether 
you are starting a business or community from scratch, or assessing your 
community initiatives to get to the next level of success, thinking like a brand 
is an essential ingredient to set up your community and organization for suc-
cess. This foundation stems from your business strategy and is brought to life 
through your brand for your customers within the community and the other 
touch points where you interact with your audiences.
A large part of the “Act like a Startup” portion is steeped in digital acumen, 
supported by agile execution. All community execution activities must be 
viewed through this lens in order to focus on the most impactful and mean-
ingful actions that you as a CM or community stakeholder can make at any 
given time.
Acting like a startup, you’ll see, means skillfully navigating an increasingly 
complex digital world—with its ever-larger number of tools, channels, and 
­buzzwords—to help you stay plugged into your community and understand 
the best ways to serve them.
Now that I’ve explained my customer-first philosophy, let’s take a look at how 
this translates into a detailed brand and business building approach.
What Real Community Management  
Looks Like
Community management goes beyond creating ambassadors or advocates for 
a product or rallying them around a common purpose. Communities are also 
valuable for market research, consumer insights, product development, and 
talent recruitment. They can also be used internally for employee engagement 
and knowledge sharing.
What’s more, the connectedness, insight, and sense of belonging that come 
from members of tight-knit communities drive a company’s ability to build or 
maintain relevance for the customer. The same is true for any other stake-
holder audience group you want to engage.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
73
Perks Consulting created a model (Figure 4-1) to visualize how the customer, 
brand, and community relationships support one another and add value to an 
organization. In this chapter, we’ll use the model specifically to address how 
community and community manager interactions add immense value across 
entire organizations.
Figure 4-1.  Bridging customer focus and agility to build a responsive organization
A lot of information is packed into one view, so let’s take it one layer at a time.
Customer: At the Heart of Strategy
Notice that the customer is in the center. Successful companies put the  
customer at the center of everything they do and make it a priority to under-
stand customers’ pain points and needs. By having a deep understanding of 
customers’ behaviors and preferences, a company can predict their needs as 
well as create appropriate solutions in the future. Companies that truly inter-
nalize this mindset ensure their survival.
Many models put the business or the brand at the core of their approach. At 
Perks, the customer informs both the brand and business strategy; thus it is 
not called out as a separate element. Putting your customers at the center 
and constantly learning from them helps create a strong strategic ­foundation. 

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
74
In this model, the brand is the entire organization’s connection point to 
the customer and the marketplace. That’s why you’ll find the “brand” band 
­surrounding the customer.
There are two important parts to developing customer focus: customer 
­experience and the customer journey.
Customer Experience
Customer experience, or CX, refers to the overall impression a customer gets 
from all of the experiences they have with a brand over time. In some contexts, 
CX may mean an individual customer experience, like a single purchase.
The best experiences are authentic, personable, and memorable. In the digital 
economy, monitoring and managing customer experience has become cru-
cially important. Brand has much to do with customer perception; as a result, 
a customer’s perception of their experience reflects positively or negatively 
on the brand.
Community management is about building meaningful relationships with the 
customer. This includes taking the time to understand what a person goes 
through when deciding to purchase the business’s product or service. It is this 
understanding that builds a relationship.
Community management is a huge part of delivering a meaningful and relevant 
customer experience. And poor community or customer management can 
negatively reflect on the brand and affect business performance. It also is a 
platform for not only managing many relationships at once but facilitating the 
many-to-many interactions among your customers.
Because of this, it’s important to have a solid sense of what the customer 
sees, thinks, and does in relation to the brand, and how customers interact 
with each other as well as the brand. A solid understanding of this customer 
experience will help you to empathize with your consumer as you create and 
implement your community strategy.
Customer Journey
The customer journey is about touch points. This journey is ongoing and does 
not end when the customer makes a purchase. You must consider the whole 
journey, from how the customer was acquired, to what actions they took after 
making a purchase, to what they said about the experience.
Much of what a CM does entails placing the customer at the center of the 
brand interactions and supporting the customer through the process.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
75
From Funnel to Ongoing Engagement 
For many years, marketers thought that a funnel was the best representa-
tion of the way people made decisions about where to spend their money. 
Customers began the purchase decision process with numerous potential 
brands in mind—the top of the funnel—and then narrowed the options fur-
ther and further until a final choice fell out at the bottom of the funnel. Post-
purchase, the buyer’s relationship with the brand was limited to the use of the 
product or service itself.
But now, research shows that people don’t just weed out their choices—they 
continue to add or subtract brands from the potential pool of choices based 
on features and benefits and insights they get during an extended evaluation 
that is likely to include engagement with brands and other sources of infor-
mation. After making a purchase, the customer will continue to engage in 
a relationship with the brand, one that may continue over social media and 
experiential sharing.
Digital tools have allowed today’s customer to be more engaged at every 
stage of the engagement process—awareness, discovery, attraction, interac-
tion, purchase, use, and advocacy.
Here’s a personal example of today’s customer engagement process in action: 
I enjoy green juices almost on a daily basis. However, I have a specific brand 
preference. I love Juice Press. How did I become a Juice Press junkie? Let’s 
examine what happened.
Step 1, Awareness: I started seeing Juice Press stores 
pop up all over the city and people carrying the bottles 
around. I saw the brand and heard others in my fitness 
circle talking about it, but I didn’t really know much 
about it.
Step 2, Discovery: After seeing people around the city 
carrying Juice Press bottles, I looked into the com-
pany digitally as well as asking questions of others I 
knew who were drinking Juice Press or green juice in 
general. I discovered that the juice was made with all 
organic, natural ingredients, which persuaded me to 
learn more.
Step 3, Attraction: I’m very into health. (Yes, I’m the kind 
who runs triathlons and marathons for fun.) As I started 
learning more about the brand, I became excited to try 
it. I followed the brand on Twitter and was attracted to 
the company’s approach and simplicity.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
76
Step 4, Interaction: I was walking down Prince Street in 
Soho one day and passed one of their locations, where 
I was offered a free sample. I have tried a lot of green 
juices, but I instantly loved this one!
Step 5, Purchase and regular use: Now that I was in the 
store and had tried the product, I knew I had to start 
making Juice Press part of my regular purchases. The on-
the-spot smoothie bar and ability to customize every-
thing may not have been what got me in the door but it 
was what made me buy into the Juice Press way and ditch 
the competitor I had been frequenting (sorry, Organic 
Avenue). Although this may seem like it should be the 
end of my customer journey, there was one more step.
Step 6, Advocacy: Not only do I love the product, but I 
tell my friends, colleagues, and students about it. I tout 
the fact that you can preorder on Seamless and skip 
the long waits. I tell everyone about their Saturday run-
ning club, where you can take a picture of yourself on 
a Saturday morning run, post to Instagram with the 
hashtags #juicepress and #willrunforjuice, and get a 
complimentary juice. I am a marketer’s dream because 
my customer journey turned me into an advocate. And 
word-of-mouth marketing is still the best form of mar-
keting, perhaps increasingly so in the digital world, but 
it is incredibly difficult to artificially manufacture.
As you can see, instead of a one-time journey through the funnel, people have 
the ability to develop ongoing relationships with brands through social media.
Taking the green juice example, you might tweet at the store or you might 
share photos of you drinking the juice, or you might join their community 
on Facebook. All of this offers companies the opportunity to reach back out 
to you, the customer, almost instantaneously when you’re happy or unhappy. 
And this further builds the customer relationship with the brand through 
community-based efforts. Together, the actions of the customer and company 
create a community dynamic completely unlike anything we’ve experienced in 
the years leading up to the social media wave.
We’ve witnessed a paradigm shift in the way people interact with products 
and services. More and more, the service is the product, and that in and of 
itself has significant implications. Becoming a customer is not just about the 
post-purchase satisfaction—how delicious the juice tastes—but also about 
your experience in line, the atmosphere of the store, and so on. Essentially 
what a company does to execute across the four quadrants (discussed later in 
this chapter) must deliver a consistent experience for the customer.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
77
Because of the emergence of new channels, including social media, the eval-
uation and advocacy phases have taken precedence in the buying process. 
Community influences both of these phases immensely! Potential customers 
use community member reviews, feedback, and interactions as part of the 
evaluation phase and often engage with those already in the community to get 
the real deal before purchasing. And thus the advocacy phase is so important 
for CMs to help facilitate and foster in their communities in order to cement 
customer preference and increase their loyalty!
Note
■
■
  More and more, in the minds of today’s consumers, the service is the product. Think about 
that—long and hard—because customer experience is as important as the quality of the physical 
product.
From a business perspective, investing resources into advocacy gives people 
more opportunities to share their experience and tell others about a product 
or service. As marketers know, it’s this positive word of mouth that truly cre-
ates a buzz.
Additionally, if the customer’s relationship with the brand has become strong 
enough to create a bond, then the customer will repurchase this product 
without restarting the customer journey each time. This increases the cus-
tomer lifetime value (CLV), the revenue generated for a business by a single 
consumer over the period of time they are buying from you.
Discovery and Validation: The Learning Loop
The second layer in the model (Figure 4-1) illustrates a learning loop of dis-
covery and validation, first between the customer and the brand, and then 
between the brand and the greater community within which customers and 
stakeholders engage. By maintaining a clear focus on the customer, businesses 
bubble up ideas and insights that shape the brand and the customer’s experi-
ence of it. This is how your company stays relevant and competitive in the 
digital economy.
By putting the customer at the center, and continually validating the company’s 
mission, vision, and promise (represented by the brand) against the custom-
ers’ needs and wants, this process informs the brand and the customer expe-
rience across all touch points. This is an ongoing process, a “learning loop,” if 
you will, that continuously clarifies who the customer is and the value that the 
company delivers to them by addressing their needs and wants.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
78
Discovery
Discovery is the practice of uncovering or searching for insights to better serve 
your customers. It also is learning about the needs of potential customers or 
new customer segments and audiences you don’t currently serve. You always 
want to be in the process of discovering how to solve problems with your 
products or services. This can help you improve your company’s brand, sug-
gest marketing initiatives, improve existing products, or bubble up ideas for 
future products. All of these activities support a brand’s understanding of its 
customers and ability to make decisions that maintain relevance with current 
customers while advocating for prospective and future customers.
For startup companies, discovery is about identifying problems to solve and 
understanding customer needs. Small companies can’t risk investing in too 
many unproven ideas at once, so discovering the “right problem” is crucial to 
their immediate survival. Startups benefit greatly from connecting closely with 
their target customers.
Larger companies developing new product or service ideas might focus on 
discovering new ways to evolve existing offerings or generate ideas for new 
offerings to maximize the business value of their existing customer base. 
Connecting with their audience is just as important, but an especially large 
brand might find it more of a challenge to connect as closely with its custom-
ers as a smaller, more nimble organization.
In both extremes, discovery is an important way to learn what products or 
services can solve customer problems and add value to their lives. Fostering 
community is therefore an essential market research and insight-incubation 
activity that adds value to current and future business strategies.
TERM DIFFERENTIATION: CUSTOMER VS. AUDIENCE 
VS. COMMUNITY
A customer is an individual buying a company’s product or service.
An audience is a collective group of stakeholders: customers, employees, partners, and 
so forth. Any one of these groups could and should be part of your community. Audience 
should therefore not be confused or seen as interchangeable with customers.
A community is a group of engaged individuals who could be your customers but likely 
includes the broader audience of your stakeholders.
The important principle to remember is that an audience (a loyal and engaged following) 
can, through your work as a CM, be transformed into a powerful community.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
79
Validation
Before building an entire business around one idea, it’s smart to get valida-
tion—confirmation that potential customers have a desire and willingness to 
pay for the product or service being created. Sometimes people make a small 
discovery and go straight to market without validation and iterative refine-
ment during the development process.
You wouldn’t believe how much money goes into starting businesses or cre-
ating solutions that had no or minimal real-world demand. In fact, this is one 
of the reasons why so many startups fail and why large companies’ new R&D 
or innovation initiatives often have hard-to-predict “hit” rates. You know the 
old phrase, “If the shoe fits, wear it.” Well, sometimes the shoe won’t fit, and 
there’s no reason to go along trying to force it on someone’s foot!
There are two primary ways to validate business concepts:
1.	 Reach out to a larger demographic to discover your specific com-
munity niche. You’ll be reading a lot about this in Chapter 
6, but for now, it is sufficient to understand that your audi-
ence is key to good marketing, and that you have to know 
your audience inside and out in order to be an effective 
community manager. You can collect this data through 
online listening, survey data, or focus groups. The hardest 
part is asking the right questions to help you discover your 
audience and their interests. Again, we’ll be helping you 
work through these ideas in the upcoming chapters.
2.	 Address a real-world problem, test interest in your solutions, 
and then determine through a series of experiments the 
market fit. This may be a bit more resource-heavy early 
on, but it’s worked for big companies such as Apple and 
Nike. Each of these companies prides itself on innovation. 
That innovation leads to the internal testing of concepts 
that help grow their businesses. After they’ve developed 
products that solve problems, they move on to figuring 
out the right target communities.
Brand: An Outgrowth and Representation of 
­Customer Desires
Brand, the next concentric circle in Figure 4-1, is an extremely powerful tool. 
And with an ever-crowded marketplace, customer confusion and decision-
making fatigue is at an all-time high! Creating a brand that customers love and 
that delivers on a compelling promise can be the difference between a massive 
success and a false start. The power of brand should radiate throughout all

parts and levels of a business. This power comes from deeply understanding 
the customer and continuously investing in that relationship.
Since the customer’s perception of a company helps define the brand, it makes 
sense to work at understanding that perception and how it evolves over time. 
The beauty of community lies in the interaction: true community management 
is a rich conversation. In stark contrast, advertising or push marketing consists 
of companies saying what they want to say, without any room for feedback and 
learning from the public.
Successful community managers thus strive to create relationships with 
­customers that build advocacy, trust, and loyalty—and that in turn enhance 
the value of the brand.
BRANDING IN THE DIGITAL AGE
The relationship between customers and brands has transformed in recent years 
because of the digital revolution. According to an article by David Edelman in the 
December 2010 Harvard Business Review titled “Branding in the Digital Age: You’re 
Spending Your Money in All the Wrong Places,”1 people act differently when given the 
choices the Internet can provide in a way that wasn’t possible 15 years ago:
But today, consumers are promiscuous in their brand relationships: They 
connect with myriad brands—through new media channels beyond the 
manufacturer’s and the retailer’s control or even knowledge—and evaluate 
a shifting array of them, often expanding the pool before narrowing it. 
After a purchase, these consumers may remain aggressively engaged, 
publicly promoting or assailing the products they’ve bought, collaborating 
in the brands’ development, and challenging and shaping their meaning.
Consumers still want a clear brand promise and offerings they value. 
What has changed is when—at what touch points—they are most open 
to influence, and how you can interact with them at those points.
The increasing availability of digital touch points can have significant impact on the 
customer experience and perception of the brand, requiring brands to pay close 
attention to the experience across every stage of the customer journey. The new goal 
of business is to form a connection with customers that transcends a single purchase, 
and brand embodies this mission.

Seth Godin (digital marketer and bestselling author) defined brand as “the 
set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, 
account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over 
another.“ The true value of a brand is reflected in what people are willing to 
pay for it, or how often they will select it over other available options.
Many people assume that a brand is simply a logo (like the Nike swoosh) or 
a product (like the Apple iPod). It is each of those, but not limited to them; a 
brand is the way to connect with customers.
A strong brand resonates with customers as well as the broader audience 
of stakeholders that companies interact with. People know the Nike logo 
and slogan, but they also know what to expect when they visit the Nike 
website or purchase a pair of Nike shoes. Brand is what a person thinks of—
the emotions and associations—when they hear or see your brand name. 
The logo and slogan are just visual and verbal representations of that brand. 
Nike has an engaged audience online, and many are customers. In the Nike+  
community, the company leverages its brand and audience to support com-
munity initiatives.
A good brand strategy communicates that you know who you are, and who 
your customers and audiences are and what their needs are. Curation and 
understanding of your community is inextricably linked to the perception of 
your brand. The elements that make up the brand strategy emphasize the 
voice and vision of what you’re seeking to accomplish in your community.
The Four Main Business Quadrants
The inner circle of customer and brand, with the insights gleaned from the 
learning loop, informs the four main business quadrants:
1.	 Product & Service
2.	 Marketing & Communications
3.	 Culture & Talent
4.	 Strategy & Operations
By managing each quadrant based on what customers say and do, you build 
strategic stability into your business process from the very beginning. Let’s dig 
deeper into how that works.
Product & Service
Companies create products and services to respond to a need. These external, 
or client-facing, products typically help make the user’s life easier in some way. 
Think of some of the digital products you use on a regular basis: your online 

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
82
banking account, your Twitter app, or your cloud-based computing tools. Most 
of these are products created to help make our lives more efficient. However, 
some products may exist for entertainment only, which also adds value.
In any organization, the product teams are innovating (on either a micro or 
macro level). The goal is to create new products to respond to a need and 
to do so in the most efficient manner possible. Of course, some products 
are better or more useful than others. That is why it’s important to have not 
only strong product teams, but also great community management that can 
uncover customer pain points and validate offerings or features as they are 
developed.
It would be naive to think that an organization’s product has no connection to 
its community. In many cases, the product is at the heart of the community.
Product Development and the Customer-centric Strategy
Many product development teams have come to embrace agile project meth-
odology that includes discovery and validation. Agile execution, integrated 
with all aspects of our model, is used by startups because of their imposed 
resource constraints, and it is often embraced by product and innovation 
teams internally at large companies as well. No matter what the size of the 
organization, the tenets are the same.
Utilizing an agile execution model for product development, teams proto-
type solutions and refine them in response to audience validation of different  
market features. The goal is to bring the problem-solution fit to life for 
the customers, and to get the necessary insight and learning for validation,  
ultimately leading to product or offerings success.
Where Products & Services Intersects with Community Management
Products exist to serve a customer need, and product communities are where 
customers can share common pain points or experiences with brands. Today’s 
consumers will actively engage with brands and are eager to provide their 
insight and input on what is working for them and what isn’t. The influence 
of these customers creates a valuable feedback cycle that product designers, 
managers, and developers can rely upon to gain insight that supports them in 
building superior products. Community managers have an important role to 
play in capturing these insights and sharing them with product development 
teams.

Marketing & Communications
Once you understand the brand and identify its role in the market ecosystem, 
marketing strategy comes into play. The goal is to take the deep understand-
ing of the brand that you have established and figure out how to apply that in 
the bigger context of your market.
Some people find it hard to understand the role that marketing plays in the 
world. We are bombarded with ads and copy every day, and we don’t always 
pay attention to all of it. Because of this constant exposure, marketers have 
only a short amount of time to try to make a memorable statement with their 
message.
But this is why it’s my fundamental belief that marketing is no longer about 
these tireless, in-your-face methods. As marketers, we have to find creative 
new ways to reach and connect with customers and other stakeholders,  
a process that can be challenging but never boring.
Community management and marketing in startups overlap so completely in 
the early stage of startups that CMs often report to the marketing depart-
ment. CMs often fall short when they don’t understand the immediate  
context of marketing, and even more so when there’s a lack of alignment or 
understanding of brand and business. So let’s dive in.
The Goal of Marketing
The goal of marketing is to move the customer through a purchase cycle. 
Developing a marketing strategy means identifying your target market—who 
they are, what they like to do, how they communicate, and their potential 
relationship with your brand, and then communicating with them accordingly. 
It also means identifying your competitors, who they are, what they are doing, 
and the main differences between your product and theirs. A good market-
ing strategy looks at marketing trends to guide decisions about the brand. 
It also serves to help solidify positioning within the marketplace. The brand 
strategy, for example, requires an internal look at the company’s core values, 
while the marketing strategy identifies the brand’s position in the competitive 
landscape.
A good marketing strategy also identifies approaches to reaching the target 
customer. Here, we’re not implementing the actual execution plans. Rather, 
we’re looking at data to help drive the plan we’ll put into effect next. Doing so 
permits a deeper understanding of emerging opportunities and how they can 
drive the growth of your business.
The marketing strategy also focuses on potential areas of expansion such  
as new product lines or other ideas that can help shape the future of your 
company. At its core, it’s a summary of goals that that will drive all your mar-
keting efforts.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value

The essence of marketing is testing strategies and comparing them against 
data in order to come up with plans that your team can implement to help 
grow the business’s reach (and consequently, the bottom line). Typically, this is 
divided into two areas: user acquisition marketing, used to obtain new users 
or buyers, and retention marketing, used to keep the customers you already 
have loyal.
Marketing and the Customer-centric Strategy
Marketing is inherently customer-centric. Really successful marketers know 
their customers so well that their product practically sells itself. Additionally, 
marketers strive to connect customers and other stakeholders in their audi-
ences to the brand. We’ll talk about finding the target audience in much more 
detail in future chapters. For now, it’s important to simply understand that 
marketing explores the relationship between the business and the customer.
THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS OF MARKETING 
In case you’re new to marketing, I’m sharing these marketing commandments to guide 
you. Notice the theme: Customer Orientation!
1. Know thy customer. It’s tough to be a successful marketer if you don’t know your 
customer. Both branding and marketing are all about the relationship with the customer: 
you have to know who you’re selling to before you start trying to sell. If you don’t know 
your customer, online listening is a great place to start. And you’re in luck, because 
we’ve dedicated Chapter 7 to this!
2. The customers come first. You’ve heard the phrase “The customer is always right,” 
haven’t you? But how many times have you been in situations where it seemed like 
the brand’s representatives forgot to honor that phrase? It’s no different in one-click 
publishing than it is in the real world—content creators have the ability to make or break 
the brand.
Digital communications create multiple touch points for the consumer to interact with 
the product. While this can result in a “zero moment of truth” for consumers to form an 
impression of the brand, it also provides a real-time, at-the-source tool for understanding 
the relationship between consumer expectations, product behavior, and brand growth.  
If you keep customers in your sights at all times, you will make the right decisions.
3. Know the product or service’s value, and the problems and pain points it removes 
for your customers. One of the biggest marketing problems is trying to market products 
that don’t deliver the promised value or service. Marketing can’t move a bad product. 
However, the issue goes both ways; marketers also can’t sell a product if they don’t 
understand its value.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
85
If a product has clear differentiation, and that differentiation provides value that 
competing products do not, then this will make the marketing process much easier. 
This is called the value proposition. What value are you offering in exchange for my 
money or time? Why are you better than competing products or brands? If there is no 
clear differentiator, your product may not have a long life. Remember, features tell—but 
benefits sell. Don’t just list features. Instead, be prepared to explain to your target how 
these features can help them improve their lives.
4. Understand your market and competitive landscape. To be a marketer, you have 
to know your market. You have to truly understand what’s happening in your industry, 
and while it may not be the best use of time to try to keep up with every single industry 
development or player, it is extremely important to have your finger on the pulse of 
what’s going on in your industry. Be aware of changes as they occur, so you’re not left 
holding the bill when the market shifts and your business is now a dated remnant of a 
time past.
In order to know your place in your industry, it’s extremely important to know your 
competitors. In fact, you should be routinely investigating your industry through online 
listening, in-person visits (where applicable), and competitor product review.
It’s also important to make sure you identify the right competitors. A competitor analysis 
may show that the brands you thought were your competitors aren’t your competitors at 
all. This will be more apparent when you develop your brand brief in Chapter 6 and do 
your online listening in Chapter 7.
5. Define and carve out a unique position. The key to carving out a unique position is to 
find a whitespace, or competitive position in your industry landscape, that is open and 
ownable—space your competitors don’t already have a claim on and aren’t showing 
signs of moving into. Figure out where the gaps in your market are, and use these to 
your advantage in your positioning. You may be able to differentiate yourself based on 
traditional factors such as price or quality, but if these aren’t where you’re aiming, then 
instead try to differentiate based on things such as customer service, environmental 
contribution, or health factors. There are limitless ways in which you can position your 
brand. The goal here is to figure out what resonates with your potential customers, and 
to own that whitespace.
6. Get visible and build credibility. In marketing, you have to be visible in order to make 
a statement. Some people do this through advertising, but in this day and age, you can 
also do it by creating good content and putting it out there in the world. People need to 
see you and know what you’re doing if you want to make a true impact. Being visible 
builds credibility. And when your brand is visible and credible, you can entice people to 
spend money on your product or service. Finally, once you build credibility, you can start 
building leads—and that’s what can make or break your business.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
86
7. Understand your customer’s needs and align them with your business objectives 
before investing in brand or marketing tools. As I implied before, marketing can do only 
so much. You have to know your customer and know your brand in order to be able to 
establish the relationship that’s needed to market a product or service. Part of this is 
understanding what you customer wants, and aligning your own business’s goals to 
that.
For instance, think of TOMS shoes. The company does great work by donating a pair of 
TOMS to someone in need each time a customer buys shoes. This invests a practical 
purchasing decision with a sense of generosity. People know they can pay about the 
same price for a pair of brand name sneakers, but when they buy TOMS, they’ve fulfilled 
their objectives of doing social good.
When the business objectives are aligned with the customer needs, beautiful things 
start to happen. It’s difficult to force people to change their behaviors, so when your 
business gives customers what they want, it ends up being a winning strategy for the 
brand.
The Convergence of Community Management and Marketing 
Marketing used to shoot for the moon—to align brand and customer fulfill-
ment. But it did so blindly. Remember the days of push marketing? A business 
would mass-circulate information about a product or service, with no possi-
bility for a dialogue with the customer. Marketers using this model eventually 
stumbled badly, because marketing was a one-sided conversation. With those 
days behind us, marketing has become a two-sided dialogue, rooted in gener-
ating more interactions and engagement with customers. And, as a result, the 
goals of marketers and community managers are directly aligned.
For example, the Nike FuelBand gives people a practical way to keep track 
of their workout progress. It allows them to keep up with other friends who 
have FuelBands via social media, and to share workout information with their 
friends. On the one hand, this is marketing: people relaying the Nike brand 
message and forging consumer awareness. On the other hand, this is com-
munity building: fitness junkies connecting with one another and with Nike 
through a product. Both parties (united in many organizations) are looking for 
these interactions.
At its core, marketing, like CM, is about building relationships. And with the 
relationships we build, we want to be able to take a step back and think about 
how we’re connecting people and products. We may not be conquering dis-
eases, but what we are doing is helping people become aware of and develop 
connections with the brands and businesses they love.

MYTHS AND TRUTHS ABOUT MARKETING TODAY
Myth: The logo is the brand.
Truth: The logo is a visual representation of the brand. The brand is the thoughts or 
feelings inspired by seeing the logo, hearing the tagline, and other brand assets.
Myth: Push marketing still works.
Truth: Customers have less tolerance for marketers pushing anything than ever before. 
These days, potential customers seek an authentic relationship with the brand. This is 
made feasible through email, traditional media, social media, and content marketing. 
Customers will put you in your place if you try to push anything on them that is 
inauthentic. Remember, customers are always right, and even when they’re not, they’re 
still at the center of your marketing and brand strategy. So it’s important to try to find 
ways to make them happy.
Myth: Marketers don’t need to know anything about social media.
Truth: Marketers should understand the value of social media inside and out, as more 
and more people are taking to the Internet to express their opinions about their favorite 
and least favorite products and services.
Culture & Talent
A company’s most valuable asset is its employees, and digital means have  
further accelerated the importance of talent acquisition and retention. As 
technology heightens competition and the pace of business, it is more critical 
than ever to have strong and capable people, including people who under-
stand the role of digital methods within an organization. A strong consumer 
brand contributes to making a company a more desirable place to work. But a  
consumer brand does not mean that a company automatically has an employer 
brand, and for many companies, gaining preference with talent is just as impor-
tant as gaining preference with customers. At Perks, we often refer to this 
balancing act as looking to build a pipeline of talent in tandem with your 
pipeline of prospects (and this works at business-to-business and business-to-
consumer enterprises alike).
A business is only as qualified to serve its customers as its employees are 
qualified to keep up with market demands. A business cannot be successful, 
innovative, or smart if it does not have a team that can validate, evolve, and 
innovate.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value

The Role of Human Resources in Culture & Talent
Human Resources (HR) focuses on the hiring and retention of talent that will 
enable the success of the organization. This is a critical component of any 
business: How can an organization fulfill its mission or keep up with customer 
demands without a team of highly capable people?
This burden is much more complicated than it sounds. Hiring talent is to HR 
what selling a customer on a purchase is to marketers. It is about proving 
to an audience (a wave of incoming talent or a target market) that you can 
add value to their lives. Potential employees are attracted to businesses for 
various reasons: brand, culture, intellectual growth, career growth, prestige, 
compensation, and more. HR has a vested interest in protecting the brand 
to preserve a positive perception among employees, or potential employees. 
Employer brand is a reflection of the corporate/product brand as well as a 
reflection of the company as a place to work. Human Resources works to 
ensure that the employee is engaged and able to make a valuable contribution 
to the company. HR is responsible for upholding internal policies and training 
new hires to deliver on the company’s strategy. HR also facilitates continu-
ing education, stimulating programs, and company perks that guide employee 
actions and keep employees productive.
At the same time, HR is dedicated to the individual employees, making sure 
they are satisfied with the company culture and work environment, individual 
growth prospects, good compensation, and have a sense of personal owner-
ship in the business. Given the fast pace of the business world, M&A, incorpo-
ration of new internal tools, and shifting market landscapes, HR has a big role 
to play in helping employees and their organizations navigate transitions.
HR and the Customer-centric Strategy
HR has an important role to play in building an organizational culture that is 
consistent with the company’s brand strategy. Building this consistent culture 
is important to ensure that the customer experience is consistent with the 
brand. In addition, the potential employees’ perception of the brand affects 
HR’s ability to hire the talent that it needs to deliver on its brand promise.
To deliver on brand promise, HR must hire and support employees who will 
effectively implement that promise. The first step in doing so often involves 
vetting candidates for various positions in the organizations. Of course, this 
task involves evaluating the candidate’s brainpower and skill sets, but if you 
think back to your last job interview, you might also remember being thrown 
some “fit” questions—“why this company?” When bringing in new hires, HR 
wants to find individuals who really believe in and fit into the brand mission 
and culture. To actually execute on this brand mission and satisfy the custom-
ers, employees need to have customer insight. Hearing what the customer 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
89
says in real time provides employees an opportunity to see the impact of their 
work and shows them where to direct their energy for maximum results.
For example, the VP of HR at MasterCard partnered with the VP of 
Communications to create a social media listening program called the 
Conversation Suite. Relevant posts, tweets, blog posts, and more are deliv-
ered to employees in real time on a 40-foot LED monitor in the center of 
MasterCard headquarters. This system was developed as part of a larger strat-
egy to “educate, empower, and encourage all the 8,000 MasterCard employ-
ees to become brand ambassadors.”
HR can optimize the employees’ ability to deliver on the company’s brand 
promise by facilitating an atmosphere that keeps top talent wanting to hang 
around (and the new top talent sending in resumes). This internal satisfac-
tion is often driven by the presence of a positive company culture. Culture 
is specific to each organization and is expressed in organizational values that 
promote behaviors such as listening to the customer, staying agile, and col-
laborating to drive innovation and success.
HR also has a role to play in guarding the brand while building it into company 
culture. Customers’ perception of the brand will be influenced by employee 
touch points, such as sales and customer service. If there is no congruence 
between the brand proposition and corporate behavior, customers and poten-
tial employees will soon recognize this and share their thoughts online. There 
is a reason that shoe retailer Zappos has every single hire spend time answer-
ing phones and dealing with customer service requests—it provides unparal-
leled insight into one of the brand’s key advantages.
Tip

  To engender a customer-centric culture, put every employee on the front lines in sales 
or customer service for a day or a week. Employees will soon understand who supports their 
jobs, and act accordingly.
The proliferation of social media and social platforms on the Web provides an 
expanded array of touch points in which employee comments and behaviors 
can contribute to brand image. Good or bad, true or false, these ­comments will 
influence the brand perception in the market. Sites like Glassdoor provide a 
vehicle for employees and prospective employees to share their experiences.
While encouraging employees to take advantage of social media to build ­talent 
communities on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook, HR also has an important role 
to play in monitoring that content. One of its key roles is understanding the 
rights of employees to engage online and establishing policies, and providing 
training on the use of social media. Employees should be brand ambassadors, 
but allowing them to use social media platforms on the company’s behalf 
requires a form of brand management.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value

Here’s an example of the power of brand image in talent. When Marissa 
Mayer, the Google “geek,” came to Yahoo as CEO in July 2012, the number 
of resumes the company received shot up. This wasn’t just about the “cool” 
factor. She invigorated the brand from the inside out, implementing a program 
called PB&J (process, bureaucracy, and jams), to collect employee feedback, 
introducing Friday FYI meetings, and spearheading new innovative projects 
such as a YahooMail revamp and mobile applications. Since Marissa Mayer 
took the job, resumes have supposedly increased fivefold—to 12,000 appli-
cants a week!
Where HR and CM Intersect
When people start thinking about company culture, they often think about 
extraneous things—whether or not there is a pool table or casual Fridays  
(or beer-and-pizza Fridays or Whiskey Wednesdays).
As our Yahoo example suggests, corporate culture requires active steward-
ship. Like customers, employees are a community! And, when they are treated 
as such, by a company culture that drives internal satisfaction and productivity 
along with positive brand image, companies can truly optimize success.
CMs who are focused on customer communities and their knowledge of the 
art of community building make them an incredible asset to the HR team. 
When thinking about collaboration between CMs and HR, decide on three 
things:
1.	 What is it you are trying to build? This question relates back 
to a company’s mission statement to identify the benefits 
the organization provides. To serve the company, HR and 
CM must constantly root their endeavors in this vision.
2.	 What experiences are you trying to generate for customers 
and for employees? Armed with a vision, community man-
agers and Human Resources personnel can work to unite 
the customer and the employee brands. Community 
managers are often the eyes and ears of the customers—
they should know how the customers perceive the brand. 
Human Resources can function as the eyes and ears of 
the employees through initiatives like Yahoo’s PB&J. Both 
CM and HR have the ability to roll out programs and 
events to curate culture. So, working in tandem, the two 
groups can inspire a convergence of brand identity.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
91
3.	 What results are you seeking? Of course, “inspiring a cul-
ture” is a pretty intangible task, so both HR and CM often 
rub up against executives with a bias toward ROI and the 
bottom line. To really prove the value added by a strong 
culture in an organization (when collaborating but also 
in general), it is ideal to identify a definitive benchmark 
for success. This way, you can more concretely say that 
a specific endeavor generated specific results. This “eye 
on the prize” mentality will keep all individuals involved 
really focused on the value-add!
Strategy & Operations
A company’s strategy provides a blueprint for success; it defines the approach 
the company will take to win in the market. Without a strategy, it is difficult 
to focus on the areas that will generate the greatest value and achieve success 
in the market. The core foundations of the strategy include defining the vision, 
mission, and values of the company, which markets the company will play in, 
what pain points its solutions will address for which customers, and how it will 
differentiate itself against the other competition in the market. Without these 
foundations, it is impossible to make informed decisions about the products 
and services the company will offer, the brand definition and messaging that 
will be used to engage customers, the plans to build a vibrant community, and 
even the talent and resources needed to succeed.
The execution of the strategy is dependent on the smooth operations of 
all aspects of the business. This includes many behind-the-scenes processes. 
Think about the finance department, or the people looking after the real estate 
or IT systems, procurement teams, and corporate security. Just because they 
may have little to no direct contact with customers doesn’t mean that they 
don’t influence the customer experience. Think of those telephone loops that 
you have been caught up in, trying to address a billing or support question, or 
a hard-to-find location, or even the data breaches that have been exposed.
Customer-centric Strategy & Operations
Strategy requires making choices—choices about which markets and custom-
ers you will serve. It means focusing on those markets and customers where 
you can establish a unique brand position and create enough value to achieve 
your goals. Making choices requires understanding who your customers are, 
what their needs are, and how you can create value by addressing those needs. 
It also requires understanding who your competitors are and how you will 
differentiate yourself in the market.

Chapter 4 | How Community Creates Business Value
92
We talked about the importance of brand earlier in the chapter. While you 
may define what you want your brand to be, never forget that in reality, your 
brand is defined by the customers—based on their experiences and percep-
tions of your company. Hopefully, the two align, but if not, beware!
Where Strategy & Operations and CM Intersect
Community managers have an important role in providing outside-in perspec-
tive to those working on strategy. They are able to inject the voice of the 
customer in the strategy process. The CM provides a reality check, a coun-
terbalance to the internal teams’ views of what the company should or should 
not be focusing on, which may be seen through rose-colored glasses.
I hope that you are starting to see the pattern here—the customer truly is at 
the heart of everything a business does. And the community manager brings 
a valuable customer perspective to all parts of the business.
Agile Execution and Go-to-Market
Last but not least, the outer layer of the model deals with two key concepts: 
agile execution (internal) and go-to-market strategy (external).
Agile execution is a work style derived from tech startups and web developers. 
Time and resource scarcity provide natural constraints for entrepreneurs, 
forcing them to use an iterative process to find out what will resonate with 
their customers. This ongoing process of “discovery” and “validation” allows 
them to make wise investments and fail fast—or as we like to say, “learn fast.” 
This is a valuable approach for community managers to lead by example in 
their initiatives, as there are so many opportunities to engage internally and 
externally across all stakeholder groups. And as you look for opportunities to 
add value to initiatives across the four quadrants we’ve just reviewed in detail, 
consider how to plan and implement initiatives to strengthen the relationships 
with your community.
With this process, companies move forward quickly with a single course of 
action, instead of being slowed down by planning every minor detail. The 
process is “agile” because there is room to demonstrate progress but still 
course-correct, so that results (including customer feedback) immediately 
inform how the process changes and evolves.
Another term commonly used for this style of working is “iterative imple-
mentation.” Each iteration, sometimes referred to as a “sprint,” is designed 
to prove or disprove an idea, feature, or hypothesis and provides insight into 
its desirability, feasibility, and viability. Moving forward using multiple iterations 
allows individual variables to be tested, and minimizes investments in things 
that don’t work or are not valued by the customer. In the Products & Services 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
93
section, we talked about how product development teams are using an agile 
execution process by prototyping solutions, taking them out for feedback, and 
refining them until they get the right problem-solution fit.
The definition of a go-to-market strategy, affectionately called GTM, is relatively 
simple: bringing a new product or service to customers in a specific market. 
However, GTMs are extremely important for the fate of your business—and 
they are very easy to get wrong. GTM encompasses all the activities involved 
in bringing a product to market, from design and development, to marketing, 
to delivery and customer service. Successful GTM requires coordination and 
collaboration across multiple groups in the organization. It takes all of the 
information and learning from customers, brand, community, and business to 
set up a strong foundation for agile execution and go-to-market. 
Done correctly, this model ensures customer relevance and a strong competi-
tive edge in the marketplace.
This Chapter Is History
This chapter started by introducing the Perks model showing how community 
management adds value to organizations. Customers are at the heart of the 
model, and the brand builds a strong connection between the company and 
its customers. Community managers play an important role in maintaining the 
brand by engaging with customers and leveraging their insights to guide other 
parts of the organization: products and services, marketing and communica-
tions, culture and talent, and strategy and operations.
This commitment to customer focus works for organizations at every size 
and level, and from early-stage business or product development to the day-
to-day tactical management of mature corporations.
Understanding the inner workings of this approach is central to your holistic 
understanding of how community and your role as a CM contributes to busi-
ness. The model presented in this chapter is meant to be a guide for you and 
those you work with (whether you’re managing up or down in your team or 
organization) to ensure equal footing and perspective on how community and 
brand play into the greater organization.
Table 4-1 is a summary of how community management contributes to vari-
ous aspects of the business. It offers, in short form, the benefits of putting this 
chapter’s principles to work.

As a CM, it will often fall to you to build relationships across the parts of  
the business and elevate the role of customer across the organization and 
operational processes. I’ve covered a lot of high-level brand and business 
development concepts with the goal of giving you context for your role.
Focus on consumer insights that add value to the business strategy and  
decision-making capabilities, and you will gain the ability to participate in  
bigger-picture strategy discussions that benefit the community you manage 
and the company you serve.
Now it’s time to get to work!

As you now know, no two communities or roles are exactly the same. By 
learning how to form a strategic foundation based on your unique organiza-
tional purpose or business model, you will empower yourself and your team 
to work smarter and create a better experience for your community.
This foundational understanding is the key to mastering this highly intuitive 
field. You may meet community managers who seem to anticipate the future; 
they’re the people ready with a solution or an answer before anyone else 
realized there was a problem. Once you understand the building blocks of 
strategic community management, you can start to develop a more innate 
“feel” for situations because you know which tools are available to you. A lot 
of this does not come immediately, but with experience, and I’m going to give 
you a solid foundation to build on.
Now that you’ve set up a community manager role and mapped it to big pic-
ture business goals, it’s time to learn what it takes to succeed on a day-to-day 
basis. By the end of this chapter, you will be clear on your own role and be able 
to create a strategic framework for your community.
Getting the Lay of the Land
The lay of the land is a strategy and action based framework that will help you 
understand your community by including what questions need to be answered 
and what inputs need to be gathered from stakeholders internal and external 
to your organization. The first step to building smart strategy is to understand 
the landscape you’re building in. To help you develop this understanding, I will 
walk you through how to assess needs and expectations, both internally and 
externally. Figure 5-1 outlines the 6 key questions you should ask yourself. The 
top row represents the strategic foundation, and the bottom row represents 
the execution tactics.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
99
These are great starting questions, and now I’ll show you how to use them.
Strategy
The top row features three key strategic questions: What, Who, and Why. 
Answers based on your company’s unique needs will pinpoint to whom you 
want to speak, and why, so that you can focus resources on the most effective 
efforts for your business.
After working your way through Part 1, some of these foundational questions 
should look very familiar. You might even be ready to answer them!
Execution
The bottom row features 3 key tactical questions: Where, When, and How. 
They set you up with information to act on, so you can form a plan and begin 
using it effectively. The different chapters in Part 2 will equip you to answer the 
bottom three questions thoroughly.
Together, this information will form the backbone of your company’s com-
munity management efforts.
Let's look at each set of questions more closely.

Strategy: Exploring the Landscape 
In this section, I’ll offer an overview of each question, dive into the process of 
answering them, and follow along as a hypothetical company uses each ques-
tion to build the strategic framework for community management.
Please note
■
■
  The example company is only used to illustrate how to apply this knowledge in a 
real-world situation. Your company will be different, and you will use the process described to create 
answers that are relevant to your business model. Please don’t think of the example as the only right 
way to do things.
I’ll also list the chapter that covers that topic in greater detail so you know 
where to look for more information. This will allow you to build on what 
you know quickly and efficiently. After all, this is The Community Manager’s 
Playbook—we want to get you into the action! So let’s jump in . . .
What Are Your Business Needs?
We’ve been talking about your business requirements throughout Part 1, so 
you may already have formulated an answer. In that case, it’s a good idea to 
review and possibly even ask your manager or other higher-ups if you’re still 
on the same page (particularly if time has passed since your last strategy meet-
ing). You must know the main goal that your actions are targeting, and what 
you are seeking to achieve. All strategy should be centered on this premise, 
and the CM’s own objective should be to keep alignment between business 
requirements and community member needs. Don’t forget community is all 
about the people-to-people relationships and is a two-way street.
If you’re answering this question for the first time, go back to the exercises 
in Chapter 1 for step-by-step guidance. If you’re short on time, you can use 
your company’s mission statement, vision statement, founder or executive 
mandates, annual business planning roadmap, and/or other business planning 
assets to guide you.
Example: Fashion e-commerce company, XYZ Fashion, is an early-stage startup 
that partners with high-end designers to sell exclusive collections. Its business 
needs include expanding the customer base and driving sales. 
Who Is Your Target Audience?
Defining your target audience, and segmenting your audiences if you have 
more than one, is a lot easier than those big words imply. Think about what 
you’re selling, who would use it, and who’s actually going to pay for it.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
101
Sometimes, the buyer can be different from the user, which may make a dif-
ference in the actual target for your message. For example, say you sell toys 
for children. Children are end users of your product, but their parents are the 
ones who have the purchasing power. In that scenario, you have to decide if 
you are targeting the children or the parents as your audience. Or you may 
decide you need a segmented and a targeted approach in order to reach 
your goals. In other words, you may have more than one audience segment 
to address and find that they are on different channels. That allows you to 
segment your audiences and target them with different messages, offers, or 
approaches.
Note
■
■
  Have no fear if consumer insights or target audience identification is new to you. Chapter 6 
will lead you through an exercise to define your target audience. (As you’ll see, the “A” in the ABCs 
of community management is Audience.)
Example: Our company, XYZ Fashion, is researching which groups of people 
already buy and wear the type of high-end fashion that it is selling. Since XYZ 
Fashion offers exclusive styles, but not discounts, its target audience must be 
people who routinely make expensive fashion-related purchases.
Why Are You Building This Community?
Think about the intent and purpose for the community around your brand. 
For some companies, building reputation in a market niche matters more than 
driving sales in the short-term. In those cases, the intent is to gather trendset-
ters in a specific category, win them over with the product or service your 
company provides, and enable them to share their experience with the groups 
that they influence.
Use the first two strategic questions to answer the third question. Once you 
understand your business needs, you can ask yourself how a community can 
serve those needs. Likewise, after you’ve defined your target audience, ask 
yourself whether that audience has the same purpose as your community. This 
is an important step to ensuring that your community strategy is aligned with 
the natural interests of your customers.
Example: XYZ Fashion wants to brand itself as a high-end fashion resource. 
It wants to create a community of fashion-savvy tastemakers to evangelize 
the brand. Since this group of people is naturally interested in learning about 
new trends in fashion, the intent and purpose of the brand and its community 
would be aligned.

Chapter 5 | CM Strategy Orientation and Setup 
102
Tactics: Defining the Landscape 
The next three questions move us from strategic to tactical thinking. You’re 
still mapping out a strategic plan, but now you’re getting into the details of 
how exactly you will act to define and manage your community.
Where Will You Host Your Community?
Once you understand the who and why that defines your audience, the next 
step is to find the right places to connect with them. There are two key com-
ponents to answering this question: knowing where your audience is, and 
knowing what people inside your own company expect from the community 
management team.
The first component, knowing where your audience is, will be examined 
in Chapter 6, ABC’s (Audience Analysis), and Chapter 7, Listening and  
Discovery. Basically, it’s all about understanding your core customer so well 
that you can predict their behavior. Think of it as being a good, thoughtful 
friend.
The second component, knowing what people inside your own com-
pany expect from the community management team, can be answered 
by going through the second exercise found in Chapter 1, What is 
Community Management (Internal Assessment), and combining it with your  
heightened knowledge of how a community can best serve big-picture  
business goals.
Example: The founder of XYZ Fashion assumes that having an online commu-
nity means maintaining a Facebook page and a branded blog. The community 
manager knows that there is a dedicated group of fashion trendsetters on 
Instagram who are very engaged with high-fashion brands. If the founder and 
the community manager do not discuss expectations, they won’t realize they 
had different platforms in mind for the community. Being aligned on expecta-
tions is an important step toward creating and delivering value for the your 
organization.
They proceed by conducting an audience analysis and a listening and dis-
covery study to find out where their target customers are spending the  
most time online. After conducting a listening study of high-fashion  
e-commerce customers, XYZ Fashion decides that Tumblr, Instagram, and 
Pinterest would be the best places to engage their target audience. Both 
the founder and the community manager correct their assumptions by  
getting information directly from the consumers they are acquiring, or  
currently serving.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
103
When Will You Organize Content and  
Community Efforts?
After you know where to find your customers, you need to talk to them. In 
most cases, it’ll be clear that there’s no time like the present to get started 
with your content and community efforts. However, this question digs deeper. 
In asking “when,” we’re talking about your tactical planning, and how it relates 
to your social media cadence and frequency. Assessing this requires under-
standing that your audience may be active at different times of the day, differ-
ent days of the week and even different times of the year. Some customers 
may thrive on endless streams of new content, while others are satisfied with 
smaller doses of interesting articles.
If you have a good understanding of how to talk to your target audience and 
what the message should be, then you will understand the best way to com-
municate within your community. This includes everything from how often 
you post on each channel (e.g., Facebook vs. Twitter vs. Instagram), exactly 
when you post (day of week, time of day, etc.), the voice and tone best suited 
to each channel, and the kind of content mix needed (e.g., original content 
vs. curated content, print vs. digital, podcast vs. video, and so on). Later in the 
book, I’ll cover these terms in greater depth.
The next two chapters, as mentioned, will teach you how to study your audi-
ence and competitive landscape to determine which tactics will become best 
practices for your specific business needs. As community managers, it’s impor-
tant to know what our target audience’s ideal behaviors would be. Sometimes, 
we think of this in terms of an “ask”: What are we asking our target audience 
to do? How do we want them to behave? What would be most beneficial to 
our business? In order to determine what you are asking your target audience 
to do, you can use your answers from the two question prompts we’ve been 
working towards in this chapter: “What are the business needs?” and “Why 
am I building this community?”
In understanding the answers to these questions, we can also discover how 
to answer the “when” question. If we want our customers to visit our site, we 
use analytics to determine what times of day our posts engender the most 
traffic. (We’ll talk more about analytics in a later chapter.) If we want them to 
take advantage of a Black Friday sale, we know that we need to start seed-
ing the event weeks in advance to raise awareness. Knowing that Instagram 
doesn’t easily allow users to link back to e-commerce portals, our message 
shifts when we post on Instagram as opposed to Pinterest, which supports 
those types of track-backs. The goal here is to understand your audience well 
enough to make sure that your community strategy encourages them to com-
plete those tasks that help support the business goals.

Chapter 5 | CM Strategy Orientation and Setup 
104
Example: Now that XYZ Fashion has created Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest 
accounts for its community, it has to decide when its audience will actually pay 
attention to content. Once again, it researches what its customers like to talk 
about, what their competitors are doing, and what trends generate interest. 
Based on their findings, XYZ Fashion decides to post several times a day on 
all its channels, with a mixture of original and curated content on Tumblr and 
Pinterest, but only original content on Instagram.
How Will You Execute This Strategy Tactically?
Strategy is key, but the execution is what the public sees and (hopefully) 
responds to. Chapter 8 will provide you with detailed instructions for building 
a content strategy, including how to measure performance, create brand style 
guidelines, and populate a content calendar. The content strategy is a frame-
work for content and community efforts.
If you think of all the people on your community management team, each 
different social media channel, and each piece of content as a moving part, 
your content strategy (a.k.a. tactical plan) will help you integrate all those 
moving parts. It’s vital to maintaining a consistent way of speaking to your 
community.
Example: Now that XYZ Fashion has decided when to post on Tumblr, 
Pinterest, and Instagram, it needs to create guidelines for how to post in a way 
that’s consistent with its brand. Since the content is centered on high-fashion 
trends and the company is targeting a discerning audience, the brand style 
must create an experience that integrates seamlessly with the high-fashion 
world. One key element of its tactical plan is the content calendar. This tool 
will include a daily posting schedule, event-driven coverage (like New York 
Fashion Week), curated content from partner designers, and a showcase of 
XYZ Fashion’s exclusive offerings.
SMART SHORTCUT: HOW TO ANSWER THE SIX 
QUESTIONS WHEN YOU HAVE NO TIME
In startups, it’s common for community managers to join the company and jump right into 
the last two questions from the chart—“When will you organize content and community 
efforts?” and “How will you tactically execute this strategy?”—without taking the time 
to assess the full strategic background (the full set of six questions). Resist the urge to 
answer just the two action-oriented questions.
Alternatively, schedule time to run through the questions in the section “Getting the Lay 
of the Land” on your own. Even 1-2 hours can make a big difference in the way you work. 
Review all six strategic questions and answer based on your current understanding of 
the business.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
105
Once you’ve done this, you will have captured all of the starting point data and 
assumptions that will guide you. Be sure to include objectives for your team and a 
hypothesis for how to achieve those objectives.
If you can, get feedback on the document from the founder, CEO, CMO, or any key 
stakeholder that you report to. This will provide level-setting information to measure 
whether you are on the same page as other people in your organization and ensure that 
you are working toward the right goals.
Even if you can’t get feedback before you need to act, it’s important to capture your 
baseline assumptions. This will provide a detailed explanation for the actions you take 
and allow you to course-correct if needed. The benefit of a startup environment is that 
you can really learn as you go.
Even If you’ve been at your company for a long time, it’s never too late to start this 
analysis.
One key warning sign that you need to test these questions is that you observe or sense 
that your team is always in “reactive” mode. You see that they are always “surprised” by 
customer situations or are uncomfortable in interactions with their community.
The key goals of this activity are to:
Unearth all the unspoken/hidden expectations so that you 
• 
understand what you’re working with.
Form different hypotheses to test and learn from.
• 
Understand your target audience and how to reach them better.
• 
Ultimately, any initiative you create should help the company get closer to its big picture 
goals. By taking a little time to think strategically, you will improve your ability to do that 
dramatically.
Building the Framework for Success
If you haven’t already, challenge yourself to answer the six questions covered 
in this chapter thoroughly, and pull in other teams to weigh in as needed. 
Collaborating with other relevant teams at this stage will help you set realistic 
goals and expectations for the community management team with solid inter-
nal buy-in. Doing so provides the basics of a strategic action plan.
This is a practical guide, so I understand that you may be bouncing around 
this book based on your own needs. However, if you have been executing the 
exercises in sequential order, you probably have large chunks of information 
about your company and CM needs, giving you a high-level overview. Now 
let’s make that information a lot more actionable (and less overwhelming!) by 
identifying your purpose and setting goals for the CM role.

Chapter 5 | CM Strategy Orientation and Setup 
106
Why Are Purpose and Goals Important?
It’s time to align your community “Why” (Purpose) with your “What” (Goals). 
Let’s discuss why these are important before diving into the exercise.
Purpose
It is important to fully understand the purpose of your community before 
you start because it will guide and clarify the path of your community man-
agement. This type of understanding keeps everyone in the company on the 
same page in their expectations for the CM team. It provides information for 
maintaining alignment with business needs as they change or evolve, and it’s a 
way to ensure that the community management strategy plays a role that adds 
value to high-level business objectives.
For example, we know that community member recommendations of a prod-
uct, service, or solution (such as with Yelp) are more trustworthy and credible 
than a brand or business speaking on its own behalf. Therefore, customer or 
community member insights are more valuable than an endorsement by the 
organization itself; personal testimony always trumps an organization's official 
stance. A CM can facilitate and encourage these personal recommendations.
Example: Tom’s Shoes donates a pair of shoes to a person in need for every 
pair of shoes the company sells. For Tom’s Shoes devotees, the purpose is 
clear. Integrating social good into a commercial brand that helps people in 
need drives the business, creating a community of loyal followers around the 
brand. Further, Tom’s supports initiatives that help serve this purpose, which 
continues to foster the environment that makes Tom’s such a success.
Goals
Community management is about building relationships, but that can be 
viewed as too qualitative or “fuzzy,” so it’s important to define concrete goals. 
If you are a CM, you need to know what you’re running towards so that you 
can focus your energy on the things that get you closer to your goals. If you 
are managing a CM, you need to provide quantitative goals so that you can 
track the progress of your CM towards established targets.
Example: A company’s goals are much more tangible than the company’s pur-
pose. As in the case of Tom’s, the overarching purpose is to help those in need, 
but the brand only succeeds in doing so by selling shoes. Tom’s has to sell a 
certain number of shoes in order to support that purpose. Therefore, Tom’s 
relies on its community to purchase those shoes, and, through careful track-
ing and monitoring, the brand’s marketers can develop baseline goals to indi-

The Community Manager’s Playbook
107
cate the business’s levels of success or failure. These goals may be sales goals, 
community engagement goals, sentiment goals or something else entirely. 
We’ll talk more about how analytics tools can drive community goals later in  
the book.
Now, onward to the exercises. Remember, these will help you validate your 
knowledge and bring real value to your company.
Exercise 1: Setting Purpose and Goals
To capture the goals and purpose of the communities you are managing, start 
by thinking about what you’re looking to achieve through them. This may be 
about the market and brand, not just about the business. For instance, looking 
again to Tom’s, we see the purpose is not just about the business goal of mak-
ing money. If it were, the business leaders would have no reason to donate a 
free pair of shoes to a person in need for every sale. Or, look to a company 
like Lego that prides itself in the notion of “play.” The company may have solid 
business goals on the books, but what really drives the company is a commit-
ment to innovation and creativity in adults and children alike, which are more 
in line with market and brand goals.
Your purpose should ideally be a two-way street that takes into consideration 
the organization’s purpose, as well as the community’s needs. The purpose 
should come from a supportive, value-driven place and should connect to 
value creation and exchange. For example, do you want to create great cus-
tomer service so that customers feel like they have a responsive outlet for 
their issues? Or do you want to make people feel like they are part of some-
thing exclusive so that they keep coming back to the “club?” Identifying the 
role your business plays in fulfilling a community need or desire will help you 
set the tone for everything you are trying to build in this community.
Be sure to also unearth the hidden internal expectations of what the com-
munity wants. Do they expect a blog, presence on all social media channels, an 
active forum, or in-person events? Understanding this will help you develop a 
clear roadmap moving forward and a meaningful community that feels like a 
true, authentic extension of your brand.
In dissecting these tough questions, which will help you understand how your 
business impacts the community that supports it, you will inevitably discover 
the purpose for your community. The purpose of a fitness community might 
be to band together to provide the best, most accurate information about 
health and wellness. Ultimately, the purpose is not necessarily to make money, 
though that might be a clear business goal.

Chapter 5 | CM Strategy Orientation and Setup 
108
To identify your purpose, consider the following:
What does your business stand for? What is it about your 
• 
business that helps make the world a better place for 
people?
Why does what you do matter? In the short-term, the 
• 
long-term, and in between?
What do your company’s employees feel passionate 
• 
about?
What is your business’s “sweet spot”?
• 
What would be the alternatives if your business ceased 
• 
to exist tomorrow? Why is your business better than 
those options?
Once you identify this purpose, you can then ask the more goal-oriented ques-
tion, “What business need does my community solve?” The business need is 
typically much more concrete: your community may offer more leads through 
referral marketing, may be comprised of advocates for your brand, may consist 
of people who are spending money with your brand, or may be embraced by 
people who are engaging on social media. Of course, none of these items are 
important if they don’t serve a greater business goal.
Every company that has a true and inspiring purpose also has a business need 
that its community fulfills. Think of a giant like Apple, which inspires us to 
“Think Different,” worshipped by fanboys out there who will wait in line for 
days just to be the first to purchase a new iPhone. This community that Apple 
has cultivated serves a huge business purpose of helping to generate buzz, 
hype and enthusiasm for new Apple products, a strategy that has proven tre-
mendously successful for the company. And, with that support, the company 
can continue to create and innovate, creating a lasting relationship cycle.
To identify your goals, refer to your answers to these questions from earlier 
in the chapter: 
What are your business needs?
• 
Why are you building this community? Or what do you 
• 
feel is lacking in your current community?
Refine that information by asking:
What does success mean for your organization? Is it 
• 
customer acquisition? Is it increased frequency of sales 
to current customers? Is it more sales? Awareness of a 
cause? Brand name recognition? A loyal brand following?

The Community Manager’s Playbook
109
What do each of your key stakeholders see as success? 
• 
(Remember: the criteria for each might be different and 
even conflicting. It is important to identify these in order 
to build a cohesive strategy.) First, list all of your stake-
holders. Internal stakeholders that may be essential on the 
CM front include Executives, Board Directors, Marketing 
Team, Product Development, etc. Next, list external, influ-
ential stakeholders like vendors, regulators, or legislators. 
Then outline how each would perceive success.
How can your community contribute to accomplishing 
• 
your business objectives? For example, what business 
objectives do you have that are customer or relation-
ship centric? Your goal here is to determine how having 
a deeper, more engaged relationship with your current 
or prospective customers can drive value. Then ask, what 
does having a more engaged community mean to your 
organization? Why does it matter? 
Below, we show some examples of goals that a community manager might 
envision after answering some of these goal-oriented questions. As you can 
see, the primary objectives are the higher-level, overarching goals that will 
have a lasting effect on the bottom line, while the secondary objectives are 
a means to the ends outlined in the primary objectives section. For exam-
ple, developing brand evangelists is one strategy for driving traffic and sales. 
Community-setting objectives include:
Primary Objectives
Drive traffic and sales.
• 
Create a visible hub for your customers.
• 
Provide customer support.
• 
Encourage brand loyalty and trust.
• 
Secondary Objectives
Develop brand evangelists.
• 
Elicit crowd-sourced product and service feedback.
• 
Exercise 2: Create an Empathy Map
The goal of an empathy map is to really know your customers. As the old 
saying goes, “You can’t understand the man until you’ve walked a mile in his 
shoes,” and the empathy map is an attempt to help recreate your customers’ 
experiences.

Chapter 5 | CM Strategy Orientation and Setup 
110
Here, we examine the customer by aiming to identify with his or her needs 
and desires. Take, for example, the category of young moms. If I were a childless 
man, I might have a hard time empathizing with the plights of these women. 
The empathy map strives to cultivate empathy for the customer’s (or poten-
tial customer’s) experiences.
It’s not a perfect science, so interpreting empathy maps can be challenging in 
practice. Ideally, a business would be able to fund numerous focus groups to 
get in-depth insights about customer behaviors. But, because focus groups can 
be expensive, addressing the customer’s needs though empathy maps is often 
a reasonable alternative.
With this exercise, we try to get into the customer’s head. Looking again to 
the young moms example, we want to know what’s on their minds. What are 
they saying about parenting? What matters to them? The traditional soccer 
mom is a very different customer than the new age mom who takes her child 
to yoga and modern dance classes. Essentially, the question becomes, “Who 
are these people, really?”
This map is a very useful tool to help put yourself in the customer’s shoes. It 
will help you embrace the behavior and needs of your customer or commu-
nity member. To do this, don’t start with a hypothesis. Avoiding assumptions is 
one of the hardest aspects of doing an empathy map. If you find yourself doing 
this, at least be aware that you are and try to disassociate yourself from your 
assumptions.

1.	 Think and Feel?
2.	 Say and Do?
3.	 Hear?
4.	 See?
Then for the bottom two sections, ask, “What is my customer’s pain?” Really 
strive to understand this. It is crucial for understanding the last part, “How can 
my company make it a ‘gain’?” For instance, taking the young mother example 
again, if her pain is that she is feeling stressed out in trying to manage her 
family obligations, the gain might be a vacation. Then, as a community manager, 
you could figure out how best to reach her in this capacity. Perhaps the idea 
that stems from this is a campaign that provides a 20% discount on a spa day, 
allowing mom to give herself that vacation she deserves.

Answering these questions is important, because to gain and maintain brand 
relevance you need to have your brand aligned with customer needs. It all 
goes back to the value that you are driving. You need to ultimately understand 
what people’s needs and wants are, and you should be empathetic towards 
those goals.
Don’t Forget Metrics and Resources
We’ve run through a lot of material that often takes months for large com-
panies to review thoroughly. Working quickly is a necessity in today’s business 
landscape, so this chapter showed you how to work fast to get the answers 
you need and how to do it intelligently.
This chapter also equipped you with the framework for a CM strategy. But 
before you pitch it for approval or begin working from it, take the time to put 
your strategy through its paces with these “litmus test” questions.

Are your goals measurable?
For example, a concept like brand awareness sounds nice, but you’ll gain a 
better understanding of what you’re working towards if you break it down 
into measurable goals. An example might be increasing understanding of your 
brand within a target group of people vs. increasing the number of people who 
have heard of your brand. Note that increasing comprehension is different 
from increasing number of people, and it requires different actions. By forc-
ing yourself to be specific at the strategy stage, you are prepared to design a 
plan of action that truly leads to the goals that you want to hit. Ambiguity is 
not good in business, and it is definitely not helpful in building a strong and 
engaged community.
What resources will you need for your plan?
Another way of thinking about this: can you or your CM team execute all the 
parts of your plan, or will you need to collaborate with other teams within 
your company or even buy services? The more resources your plan requires, 
the less likely (or less quickly) you are to get funded. Start simple: prove your-
self, expand intelligently, and retain control.

Parting Thoughts
People make a lot of assumptions about their communities. Even when you 
work intelligently to find out about them, there are pitfalls. The most impor-
tant step in building a strategy is looking past yourself and being aware of your 
own biases (as well as those of your team) to get a clear picture of who is in 
your community, who could be in your community, and who your company 
wants in your community. If these three groups are in sync, then you have 
achieved alignment. If not, you have identified a clear gap in your execution 
that needs to be addressed via research and strategy. The next chapter will 
help you address this gap by diving into your ABCs (Audience, Brand, and 
Community) and creating alignment among them.

The ABCs of 
Landscape 
Analysis
Getting to Know Your Audience,  
Brand, and Category
In Chapter 5, we surveyed the lay of the land, which gave you a framework for 
your community management strategy. Now it’s time to collect more specific 
information to turn that strategy into an actionable plan. The digital world 
provides a lot of useful intelligence if you know where to look, but it can be 
hard to cut through the noise. That’s why I’m equipping you with the ABCs: 
Audience analysis, Brand audit, and Category assessment. Audience, Brand, 
and Category are also, not coincidentally, the three major aspects of com-
munity. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with those terms yet; I’ll cover each 
one in depth.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
116
By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the ABCs and 
how to act on that knowledge. Here are the learning objectives:
1.	 Find, define, and reach your audience: employ different 
methods of research, segmentation, and targeting.
2.	 Gain insights about your brand: create a research plan 
and your own brand brief.
3.	 Assess your business category: understand industry fac-
tors and competitors that affect your company.
The key takeaway is that you need to understand to whom you’re speaking 
(audience), who your company is (brand), and what kind of industry your 
company is in (category). Follow these steps and implementing your commu-
nity management strategy will be as easy as—you guessed it—A, B, C.
Getting Started with the ABCs
Let’s get an overview of what each phrase means, so you can start getting 
comfortable with the concepts.
Audience Analysis
The goal of an audience analysis is to help you identify the experiences that 
drive connection with the brand. Understanding the audience can help you 
tap into their needs and desires, which is an essential component of brand 
success. This will be the meat of this chapter, because as a community  
manager, the audience is at the heart of what you do. If you can clearly 
understand them and identify with their needs, then your job as a commu-
nity manager will become pivotal in the success of your company’s marketing 
strategy.
Brand Audit
 With the caveat that this isn’t a book about branding, I can’t overemphasize 
the importance of understanding your brand. There’s a reason that brands 
are willing to spend millions to amplify their brand presence. As a community 
manager, you will act as the brand’s voice in interactions with customers and 
other stakeholders, both online and offline. Therefore, conducting a brand 
audit is essential in understanding how to create a community strategy that 
reinforces your company’s brand. A strategic brand audit helps you clearly 
define and understand the brand assets that define brand equity and build 
business value.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
117
Category Assessment
When we talk about category, we’re talking about the broader picture of the 
business landscape that your company is in. It’s important to understand all the 
factors that affect your business. For example, Crunch’s category is the fitness 
industry. This includes not only gyms, which is Crunch’s direct business, but also 
health food and vitamin stores such as GNC and The Vitamin Shop, apparel com-
panies like Nike and lululemon, and specialty athletic stores like City Sports.
You can’t understand your brand without understanding how these factors 
behave. Analyzing the category landscape helps the CM choose points of 
focus and identify patterns of behavior to help drive interactions. By identify-
ing the trends, behaviors and players driving momentum in the category, you 
can focus on ways to truly connect with your audience.
Putting the ABCs to Work for You
Now it’s time for the good stuff: how to apply these topics to your community 
management efforts and your company. We are diving in deep with detailed 
information and many exercises to set you up with strategic intelligence for 
your community. Let’s go!
A is for AUDIENCE
When I think of audience, I think about fans who attend big sporting events 
or people who attend a performance. This isn’t so different from the digital 
space, though it can feel very different. Your audience is the people who are 
standing by, hanging on, and responding to your brand content.
If you don’t understand your audience, you risk spending time and energy on 
efforts that don’t actually support your business goals. For instance, if Walmart 
started selling branded, high-end luxury jewelry, that effort would likely flop 
considering the disconnect between Walmart customers and high-end jew-
elry clientele.
According to an article in the Harvard Business Review,1 failing to understand 
their target audience can lead to startup failure (bolding added to highlight 
audience mentions):
#1 
• 
No market research on the product or the market 
has been done.
#3 The product is interesting but 
• 
lacks a precise market.
1Harvard Business Review, “Why Most Product Launches Fail” 40 Ways to Crash Your Product 
Launch.” http://hbr.org/2011/04/why-most-product-launches-fail/ar/1

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis

#7 
• 
Target audience unclear, so marketing campaign 
is unfocused.
#15 The launch is aimed at the 
• 
wrong target 
audience.
#22 The product is 
• 
launched without influencers to 
promote its efficacy.
All of these reasons for failure revolve around not having a clear understand-
ing of the target audience and how to reach it. Even a great product won’t sell 
if the right people don’t know about it. Taking time to truly understand the 
audience can have a major impact on a company’s chances of success. In fact, 
you can even use audience analysis to validate your business idea by checking 
if there’s sufficient audience to establish a business.
Another analysis from ChubbyBrain.com shows that the number one rea-
son startups fail is because they ignore their customers. Surprised? Audience 
should always be at the core of your work, your mission, and your brand.
Mix and Mingle: Different Types of Audience
Not all audiences are created equal, so let’s go deeper by defining the differ-
ent types of audience groups. The first, target audience, is most familiar from 
a business standpoint since most companies think about to whom they can 
sell. However, there are other audience sets that can have a major bearing on 
a company’s ability to grow and connect with people. Together, these groups 
comprise an audience mix, giving you a richer understanding of all the people 
who can influence the success of your business.
Target Audience
The target audience is your company’s ideal consumer. Typically, they’ll be 
defined by specific traits and interests that connect to the product or service 
that your company provides. For example, a company that sells affordable and 
fashion-forward eyeglass frames might target 18–30 year old women, while a 
healthy new baby food line would want to target new parents in the 25–40 
year old range.
Traditional ways to define target audiences include: age, sexual orientation, 
gender, economic class, religion, ethnicity, and location. Other factors might be 
a bit more specific, like “wearing glasses” or “health conscious” or even “what’s 
trending” classifications. These types of classifications are usually most useful 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
119
for niche brands. Taken together, they allow marketers to profile the people 
to target in their marketing and advertising efforts.
Your audience is your market. Some businesses have a target demographic 
of “everyone” (think of a company like Google or Amazon), but that is rare. 
Most companies have some sort of lens that helps them focus on the type 
of customer that would be most valuable to them. For smaller brands, the 
demographic may be defined by one characteristic: people who love wine or 
people who enjoy learning about technology, for example.
Collaborators
This is different from target audience. Collaborators may not be the people 
buying your product or service, but they are a kind of support system that 
can help boost sales and brand awareness. For example, if you’re selling fit-
ness products, the opinions of health and fitness bloggers are important, even 
though they may not be the target customers. It’s important to consider them 
when making decisions, as they may have longer-term relevance in helping 
grow the business.
Influencers
Influencers are individuals who have the power to influence purchase decisions 
based on their social status, authority, or relationship. These people may be 
part of your target audience profile, but not always. For example, some con-
sider Kim Kardashian an influencer to people who are not necessarily in her 
age range or income bracket. In any case, companies that work with influencers 
may need to aim to reach these individuals differently, as marketing specifically 
to them may yield better results for reach and meaningful messaging. 
Stakeholders
A final key audience group is stakeholders, which include employees, inves-
tors, and other people who have a vested interest in a company and may be 
held accountable for the success or failure of that company. It’s important to 
remember that internal stakeholders are an audience. They help influence 
decisions and offer critical feedback to help grow the brand. Understanding 
the things that are important to employees can increase employee engage-
ment, resulting in increased loyalty and productivity.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
120
Let’s dive just a little deeper into two core stakeholder groups:
• 
Employees: When reaching your audience, it’s also impor-
tant to consider your employees. If a massive new push 
to grow the company translates negatively to employees, 
that could leave a terrible brand impression. Long-term, 
a business can only be as good as the employees that 
support it.
• 
Vendors: In any business environment, there are going to 
be products and services that the company outsources. 
These vendors may have a say in your business, and, as 
suppliers of goods or services, may also have a say in your 
business trajectory based on their own capabilities. 
Affiliates
This category is generally only relevant to large corporations. Affiliate groups 
are typically subsidiaries of larger organizations. They may be part of the same 
industry, live under the same corporate umbrella, or may represent entirely 
different brands. For example: KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell are all affiliate 
brands of Yum! Brands. They represent a target audience because of their 
impact on specific community marketing. For instance, if you work for Yum! 
Brands and you decide to tweet about how tacos, fried chicken, and pizza are 
unhealthy, you are apt to be quickly disenfranchised from this affiliate subset.
While identifying the target market and focusing on your relationships with 
them is key to developing your business, it’s still important to keep tabs on 
your relationships with these other core groups that influence your brand’s 
performance and reputation.
IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY STILL MAY NOT COME
It would be amazing if having a great product were enough to create a strong business 
model, but it’s not. Make sure your business has a reasonable chance of success by 
focusing on the target audience and conducting relevant research. This is called market 
validation. If you don’t do it, you risk wasting valuable resources on a concept that might 
be a total flop in the real world.
One example of a product created without proper market validation is Coke C2, a soda 
introduced in America in 2004 as a response to the low-calorie, low-carb diet trend. 
Although this product was designed to match a big diet trend, Coca-Cola guessed that 
consumers would be interested in drinking the half-the-calorie version of its original 
product and did not validate the assumption. Sales failed to live up to expectations, and 
the product was discontinued in 2007. Strategic market research might have prevented 
this costly experiment.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
121
Conversely, companies will spend lots of research and development dollars to create 
something truly innovative, without having validated whether there is actually a need 
for this product in the consumer market. These brands might be taking the Steve Jobs 
definition of innovation too literally: “People don’t know what they want until you show 
it to them.” He was correct that the average customer cannot tell you what kind of new 
product to create, but Apple innovations were built by observing consumer habits and 
building products that improved and fit seamlessly into their lives. Innovation should 
always take patterns of behavior into account. Otherwise, you might have an invention 
that nobody will purchase.
For example, the Segway is a funky, two-wheeled motorized device that allows users to 
stand upright as they cruise around from place to place. While a very cool and futuristic 
invention, the Segway was seeking to invent a market rather than having identified 
a market need to fill. Despite initial buzz and media coverage, they sold far below 
expectations. Today, they are still available for purchase, but have limited appeal outside 
of niche populations: police teams, Segway enthusiasts, and Segway tour companies.
The good news is that the rise of digital tools for assessing consumer sentiment has 
made market research a lot more accessible to startups and small companies. Even if 
your brand doesn’t have a Google-sized budget, there are options to validate concepts 
for products or services. This chapter and the next will equip you with information 
regarding tools and their strategic use. These will help you see the bigger picture  
(the market landscape) and understand your product’s fit.
While innovation is good, it is better for business to engage in calculated innovation. 
Don’t just assume that if you build it, they will come. Instead, take some time to do your 
homework, so that once you build it, they will come… and keep coming back, over and 
over again.
Ready, Set, Target!
Knowing your target audience is crucial to the success of your business. This 
is true for businesses of any size, from the largest corporations to the conve-
nience store down the street. (A gas station isn’t very useful for people who 
ride bicycles, right?)
In our daily lives, we all have different wants and needs, and a very wide range 
of options for how to meet them. Being broad and vague is a poor strategy for 
gaining business in a crowded marketplace. One way to define a specific target 
audience is to zoom in on subdivisions of customer groups.
For example: “men and women who buy groceries” is a broad customer 
group. If you stop there, you’re competing against all the other companies in 
this space: from superstore chains like Sam’s Club, to a mom ’n pop corner 
shop. But, if you’re selling a new type of supplement specifically designed to 
give people a healthy boost, you could narrow that focus to “men and women 
who buy groceries and choose healthy lifestyles.”

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
122
Getting specific in this way will inform decisions about which communities 
and media outlets to engage (those that focus on fitness and healthy living). 
Ultimately, this will give you a far greater chance of reaching people who are 
the optimal consumers of your product or service. This is also how you begin 
to define segments within your target audience.
Segmentation Is Not a Bad Word
I’ve been talking about getting specific about your business to understand 
your target audience segments. Now it’s time to discuss a structured way 
of defining those segments. Typically, segmentation falls into four categories: 
demographic, geographic, psychographic and behavioral. Let’s explore how 
these categories are used.
Demographic. This is very straightforward and categorizes people based on 
shared baseline characteristics. Typical demographic segments include age, 
gender, income, ethnicity, religion, and stage of family life (for example, “single” 
or “married, with children”).
Geographic. This is also unambiguous being based on where people live. For 
example, people who live in New York City aren’t going to be interested in 
a new pizza restaurant in San Francisco, but people who live in the Bay Area 
may be. Depending on your business, the parameters might be as specific as a 
neighborhood or as broad as a city, state, or country.
Psychographic. This looks at more nuanced approaches to the target. It includes 
personalities, values, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. For example, two people 
may be very similar in terms of demographic and geographic segmentation, 
but could be segmented differently based on the fact that one is a liberal and 
one is a conservative. In some cases, psychographic segmentation may overlap 
with behavioral segmentation.
Behavioral. This studies habits and behaviors such as consumption, spending 
and lifestyle. These factors strongly influence people’s knowledge of, attitudes 
toward, usage rates of, or response to, a product. Our earlier example of a 
general grocery store vs. a grocery store that specifically caters to people 
who have healthier eating habits is one way behavioral segmentation can be 
used.
Traditional methods of identifying target market segments, like coordinating 
focus groups, can be prohibitively expensive for smaller companies. Luckily, 
the modern digital landscape provides plenty of options to conduct audience 
listening and discovery at every price point. We’ll be covering key options in 
this chapter and the next one.

FEBREZE’S STINKY SEGMENTATION PROBLEM
In the 1990s, Proctor and Gamble (P&G) started work on a product designed to 
eradicate bad smells. The concept was clear, and, in many ways, incredibly useful, but 
the company was having trouble trying to get people to understand the benefits of such 
a revolutionary product.
At first, P&G tried marketing Febreze as a way to get rid of odors. This was an obvious 
approach, since odor elimination was the key attribute of the Febreze formula that 
no other product on the market could claim. However, early on, it was clear that the 
approach wasn’t resonating with the people that the Febreze executives thought would 
most benefit from the product. The key was to find out why.
Their research team conducted on-the-ground testing to gain insights about why people 
didn’t view Febreze as a useful product. When researchers entered the home of a 
woman who owned nine cats, the team began gagging from a noxious odor in her home. 
However, the homeowner didn’t seem to notice the smell, even noting that her cats 
“hardly smell at all.” It became clear that this person, who personified Febreze’s original 
target market, had become desensitized to the bad smell.
This major insight completely shifted the audience focus from people who routinely 
encountered strong odors to people who would prefer an additional tool for eliminating 
odors in everyday life.
The change in target audience also informed positioning. Rather than marketing 
Febreze as a product that got rid of odors, it positioned itself as a part of an existing 
cleaning routine: if you’re going to take the time to clean a room, why not finish it off with 
a quick spritz to clean the air? As part of the routine, it focused on the cue (a freshly 
cleaned room), the routine (spraying with Febreze) and the reward (a clean-smelling 
room). This became the cornerstone of the brand’s marketing efforts, elevating it to a 
household name.
Hit the Bull’s-eye
We’ve reviewed the theoretical aspects of understanding your target audi-
ence: how to figure out who they are, why they’re important, and how big 
brands tend to segment these audiences. This overview lays the groundwork 
for what comes next: the process of defining your own target audience.
Now it’s time to learn how to turn this knowledge into action and apply it to 
your brand. I’ve designed a series of workbook exercises that will lead you 
through the steps required.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
124
Note: A lot of the information in this section can be supplemented by  
information in Chapter 7: Listening and Discovery. There will be a note when-
ever this is true, so you can tailor the exercises to your needs.
Define Your Target Audience
This four-step process will help you identify and define your target audience. 
It will lay the groundwork for developing a community management strategy 
that meets the needs of both your brand and your consumer.
The four steps to defining your target audience:
1.	 Ideate (develop hypothesis)
2.	 Discovery (explore and test hypothesis)
3.	 Profile (synthesize assumptions and solidify what you 
know)
4.	 Create persona
The goal of this process is to generate insights. According to innovation con-
sultancy Fahrenheit 212, a good insight is a “fresh, potent and energizing truth.” 
These are kernels of knowledge that can help explain facets of your con-
sumer’s behavior and help your company grow. Simple but powerful insights 
can lead to major brand overhauls and massive changes in multi-million dollar 
marketing strategies, as shown in the Febreze case study.
Let’s explore each step of the process to set you up for action.
The Audience Process: Step 1. Ideate
Ideation means generating ideas about a subject based on what you already 
know and then forming a hypothesis to test those ideas. In a brand context, it 
means looking to the foundations of your business to develop ideas that might 
be worth testing or pursuing.
There are many different ways to find clues for ideas to start the process.
Business goals. In Chapter 5, you defined your brand’s business goals. Whether 
you’re aiming to become the next Google or the go-to-gadget shop in a small 
village, a good understanding of the big picture context for your company will 
make a big difference in how you ideate.
Product and values. Analyzing the problem your product or service solves is a 
great way to begin ideation. The logical next step is to research which groups 
of people have the problem that your company solves. Another great starting 
point is your company’s core values. Make a list of people who share the same 
values. Your initial guesses form the base of an audience hypothesis.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
125
Consumer attitudes and behaviors. Once upon a time, you had to spend sig-
nificant money on expensive research teams to conduct field-testing, survey 
data and focus groups to learn consumer opinions and behaviors. These days, 
social media channels and analytic data sets provide this info in a more cost-
effective way. Exercises in this, and the next, chapter will lead you through  
different methods of gathering consumer-generated information online. This 
will help you gain a bird’s eye view of consumer sentiment and opinion.
Once you find the clues, you can find inspiration to shape and refine your 
hypothesis. Understand that clues are enough to get you started, but you can’t 
excel in ideation without a little bit of good old-fashioned creative inspiration. 
While some people think creativity tends to come randomly, a number of 
studies show that you can trigger creativity by clearing your mind or taking a 
new approach to an old problem. To refine your ideation phase for audience 
segmentation, try these approaches:
Look to the Founder Vision
To gain a clear idea of what a business or brand is about, the founder is one 
of the most important resources. How is he/she trying to make the world a 
better place? What sentiments echo within the brand’s identity? The answers 
to these questions can generate some creative brainstorming about who the 
right audience is for your company.
Market Trends
Emerging trends can generate ideas about who your target audience might 
be. You can find this type of information on blogs, in popular magazines, and 
­newspapers. For a deeper dive, you can even read heavily research-oriented 
publications from companies like Forrester, which offer in-depth market 
research reports, or relevant articles from McKinsey & Co. Online listening 
practices covered later in this chapter and in Chapter 7 can yield great insights 
from community forums and group discussions.
Category Trends
Category trends are more specific than market trends because they relate to 
the type of industry your company is in. (We will be covering “category” in 
more detail later.) Keeping an eye on developments in your space will ensure 
your business stays relevant. Reading trade publications and attending meet-
ups with people in the same industry are two good ways to stay up-to-date.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
126
Observation of Consumer Behaviors
The key word here is “observation.” This is different from interviews, surveys, 
and focus groups, where companies are actively asking for information. Instead, 
you are gaining insights from the way customers behave naturally, without 
knowing they are being watched. It’s very anthropological! For example, if 
your brand has physical retail locations, you could watch customers, from the 
time they step in the door, to understand their in-store experience and how 
they try out the products your company is selling. The digital space provides 
a wealth of observation opportunities, from listening studies (Chapter 7) to 
how to measure performance (Chapter 10).
In the ideation step, you will be using these sources of information for peer 
inspiration. We will revisit this to conduct more structured research in  
Step 2: Discovery.
BETTER BUSINESS THROUGH SEGMENTATION
Once you’ve defined your target audience segments and understand them, you can 
start making smarter business development decisions by asking two questions.
1) How do each of these groups engage with your business?
Different groups of people have different habits. For instance, a younger target audience 
may be more tech savvy and, therefore, would warrant more investment in mobile 
technology than an older group that accesses sites mostly via desktop computers. 
This kind of insight would help you allocate resources intelligently. In this example, a 
company who caters to an older generation may decide to put more work into perfecting 
its main website instead of building a mobile app, because that would serve its target 
audience better.
2) What kind of relationship do different groups require from your business?
Each target audience segment may want something different from your business. 
Understanding who buys the products and services your business sells, and then 
thinking about what kind of support those customers will need, will directly affect 
community management strategy. For example: a company that offers both personal 
and business software will have two different core customers. A customer service 
program would maintain individual customers, where business customers would need 
more specialized services to support their broader needs.

Exercise 1: Target Audience Ideation and Initial Audit
It’s time to put all that ideation to work.
Starter Questions
Here are thought-starter questions based on what you’ve learned so far:
What does your company make or do? Who wants or 
• 
needs that product (or service)?
What problem does your company product (or service) 
• 
address? Who encounters that problem?
How does your company solve that problem? Who would 
• 
appreciate that solution?
What are the brand values? Who shares those values?
• 
Based on those questions and what you learned in the section above, make a list 
of potential target audiences. Aim for a minimum of 10 potential audiences.
Define
When you’re ready, put your initial list to the test. Define each target audience 
segment by answering this next set of questions thoroughly. This will push 
you to describe each segment in more specific terms and really think about 
whether that group of people is a good target for your brand.
Demographic: Have you defined the baseline character-
• 
istics as much as possible? (Age, gender, marital status, 
income, religion, occupation, ethnicity, education).
Geographic: Where do they live? Why do they live there? 
• 
(Country, state, city, neighborhood).
Psychographic: What do they believe in? What are their 
• 
day-to-day concerns? (Politics, religion, values, lifestyle, 
attitudes, self-image, personality).

habits, types of activities, places they frequent).
Audit
Next, it’s time to take those potential audiences and find out whether there 
is a two-way street between your offerings and their needs. We’ll do this by 
auditing each of the target audiences to try to understand their relationship 
with your business and its products or services. In an audit, we’re aiming to 
use due diligence in determining whether there is a solid product-market fit

between the business and the audience group. When conducting an audit of 
these potential target markets, it is important to ask:
Are the benefits of your product (or service) easy for 
• 
them to understand?
Will your product (or service) fit into their regular 
• 
routine?
How do you think they will use this product (or service)?
• 
How large is this group?
• 
Do they influence any other groups?
• 
Case Example Based on Exercise 1
To demonstrate this exercise, I’m reviving our hypothetical company, XYZ 
Fashion.
Part one: Generate ideas for target audience segments by going through 
these questions.
• 
What does your company make or do? XYZ Fashion makes 
trendy fashion clothing and accessories at affordable 
prices.
• 
Who wants or needs that product (or service)? Women who 
want to keep up with fashion trends.
• 
What problem does your company product (or service) 
address? It’s expensive to keep up with fashion trends.
• 
Who encounters that problem? People who want to keep 
up with fashion trends, but do not have the budget to buy 
high-end pieces for every trend. Parents who need to buy 
clothes for kids every year.
• 
How does your company solve that problem? XYZ Fashion 
designers take inspiration from each season’s fashion 
shows and create affordable versions of the trendiest 
pieces.
• 
Who would appreciate that solution? People who follow 
each season’s fashion trends. Stylists who work with fash-
ion and need affordable options for their clients.
• 
What are the brand values? XYZ Fashion believes in making 
of-the-moment fashion accessible at every price point.
• 
Who shares those values? People who are interested in 
fashion, but do not have high-end budgets.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
129
As a result of our answers, we have whittled a longer list of potential target 
audiences down to three:
1.	 Women interested in fashionable clothes and accessories.
2.	 Parents who buy clothes for their kids.
3.	 Stylists who work with fashionable clothes and 
accessories.
Part one recap: Notice how different questions sparked different ideas for 
target audiences. At first, XYZ Fashion was focused on the end user: women 
who would wear its clothes and accessories. However, thinking about the 
price point and attention to fashion trends raised more potential targets. 
Parents who buy clothes for their kids every year are going to be happy about 
affordable options, and stylists, who are paid to keep up with trends, but have 
to stay on budget, would benefit greatly from this company as well.

  I hope this analysis pushes you to go beyond the obvious answers while you are in ideation 
phase. Have fun with it!
Part two: Define your audience based on demographic, geographic, psycho-
graphic, and behavioral aspects. Then audit them to determine if they are 
good audiences to target based on your brand.
Demographic: Have you defined the baseline characteristics as much as possible? 
Potential customers of XYZ include:
Women interested in fashionable clothes and accessories. 
• 
® Women, 16-29, unmarried, no children, income under 
$75k per year.
Parents who buy clothes for their kids. 
• 
® Women, 40-60, 
married, with children in high school.
Stylists who work with fashionable clothes and accesso-
• 
ries. ® Stylists who work with fashionable clothes and 
accessories. (Note there was no change. I will discuss in 
the recap.)
Geographic: Where do they live? Why do they live there? Potential customers of 
XYZ include:
Women—urban/suburban United States
• 
Parents—urban/suburban United States
• 
Stylists—large cities because that’s where there’s enough 
• 
need for their services (NYC, L.A., Miami, etc.)

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
130
Psychographic: What do they believe in? What are their day-to-day concerns? 
Potential customers of XYZ include:
Women—The lower end of target age range (16–21) 
• 
wants to look cool among peers. The higher end of tar-
get age range (22–29) wants to look fashionable but dress 
appropriately for the workplace.
Parents—They want their kids to be happy about their 
• 
clothes, but also want them to appear suitable for school 
and public places.
Stylists—They need to provide fresh clothing and acces-
• 
sory options to clients regularly. Runway fashions and 
designers are important to them. The manufacturing 
quality is also very important since the fashion reflects 
the quality of their work.
Behavioral: What do they do regularly? Potential customers of XYZ include:
Women—The lower end of target age range (16-21) goes 
• 
to classes, high school or college, hangs out with friends 
at shopping malls and local diners, and goes to parties at 
their friends’ houses. The top end of target age range 
(22-29) goes to work and transitions to happy hour with 
friends and co-workers immediately after work at pubs 
and wine bars. On average, every 2 weeks this demo-
graphic will dine out and frequent cocktail bars.
Parents—Working moms who juggle a busy workday 
• 
with organizing weeknight dinners (mixture of affordable 
delivery and fast home-cooked meals) and prioritizes 1 
family night per week to spend together.
Stylists—Visiting 2 clients per day with different styles, 
• 
sizes or occasions, which requires a lot of clothing and 
accessory options. They may have to run to stores for 
last-minute purchases.
Now it’s time for the audit. Here are the questions again, with answers for 
each of the three potential target audiences to follow:
Are the benefits of your product (or service) easy for 
• 
them to understand?
Will your product (or service) fit into their regular 
• 
routine?

The Community Manager’s Playbook
131
How do you think they will use this product (or service)?
• 
How large is this group?
• 
Do they influence any other groups?
• 
Women, 16-29, unmarried, no children, income under $75k per year. The benefits 
of shopping at XYZ Fashion are very clear. This target audience wants to look 
trendy with pieces that they can afford. The company’s styles fit their lifestyle 
very well. This is a very large group that looks within the same peer group 
for fashion inspiration, so it influences itself. Conclusion: This is a very strong 
target audience for XYZ Fashion.
Women, 40-60, married, with children in high school. The low prices of XYZ 
Fashion clothes and accessories and the wide variety are the key benefits. 
These are busy parents who want to get school shopping completed while 
minimizing time and budget. However, some of the styles may be a detriment 
if they view them as inappropriate for their school-age kids. Also, since the 
people who wear XYZ Fashion have an average age of 16 and older, would the 
parents really be the ones shopping for them? Conclusion: This is a potential 
target audience that requires more research.
Stylists who work with fashionable clothes and accessories. The on-trend designs, 
wide variety and low prices meet many of the needs of stylists. However, after 
studying the psychographic and behavioral traits of this group, the lower man-
ufacturing quality and easy-to-buy options are not good for stylists because 
they require high-quality, hard-to-get pieces to impress clients. Conclusion: 
This is not a viable target audience.
Part two recap: Notice that there’s freedom to pick and choose how thor-
oughly you answer each audit question for each potential target audience. 
In the demographic section, I chose not to define stylists by any additional 
characteristics because it didn’t matter from the company’s point of view. If 
stylists were a target audience, they would be buying for business purposes. 
That’s why I focused on what they needed in their work as stylists instead of 
their personal needs.
The auditing process can also highlight areas for further research. At this 
stage, many of your answers are assumptions based on normal awareness 
of the world. With the idea about parents being a target group, it becomes 
important to do more research to either support or correct the assumptions, 
before knowing if they will ultimately become an important group to target.
The final takeaway from this example is that nothing in the process we  
followed is rocket science. The work lies in challenging yourself to get as  
specific as possible and organizing the information by what you know, and 
what you need to research further. I hope this gives you a practical under-
standing of how to apply these questions to your own brand and business.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
132
The Audience Process: Step 2. Discovery
Now that you have sufficient information to form a hypothesis, it’s time to 
develop that hypothesis through research and testing. Research falls into two 
main types: primary research, which is original, and secondary, which relies on 
existing sources.
All research generates data, which is either qualitative or quantitative. 
Qualitative data is gleaned from open-ended questions, such as the part of 
a survey that asks you what you liked most about a product or event. Even 
though these responses are difficult to measure, they do provide valuable 
insight into what people like and dislike, or why they might use your prod-
uct instead of a competitor’s. Sometimes you can quantify this information 
based on sentiment, but the value of the data itself is the ability to understand 
people’s reactions and thoughts as it applies to the question.
Quantitative data is numerical data, such as how many people signed up for 
your email list, or how much it grew over the course of a month. In fact, most 
of the data ascertained from analytics, reporting, and performance tracking 
is quantitative data. However, in the community context, this goes beyond 
analytics—such as when you run a survey to find out how people like your 
new website and ask for responses on a scale of 1–10, and then calculate the 
average based on those responses.
Primary Research
Primary research is unique to your company and brand. This is data collected 
from hands-on testing, experimentation, observation, or focus groups. You 
can use this to find significant information that is very specific to your com-
pany. Here, I offer a broad overview of the different types of research you’ll be 
conducting as a community manager.
Performance Tracking, Analytics, and Reporting: This describes the practice of 
using data to develop key findings and generate inferences and insights about 
behavior. The Internet makes it easy to track and collect data about your fans, 
followers, website visitors, and much more. In fact, many web and social media 
tools have analytics built into their dashboards, including social media brand 
pages and email marketing tools. Others, such as Google Analytics, are simple 
to integrate into almost any website. These analytic tools can be very detailed, 
capturing information over time, by country, and even by which languages your 
users speak.
Focus Group, Survey, and Interview: These describe different methodologies 
used to obtain information. If you want to collect qualitative information 
about a product or service, you might hold a focus group, which involves  
taking a sample of your target audience and asking them to come in for a  

The Community Manager’s Playbook
133
few hours and talk about your product. This can generate a lot of information, 
all from a sample of your target population; however, focus groups can also be  
long and expensive to run. An interview is like a focus group, except that it is 
done with one person as opposed to many so the researcher can get person-
alized information. They’re usually conducted in person, but may be conducted 
via phone or over Skype. However, if a focus group or interview sounds too  
time-consuming, you might opt instead for a survey. These can be conducted 
simply via phone or email, and give you both quantitative information (such 
as the scale of 1–10 I mentioned earlier) or qualitative through open ended 
questions (for instance, “What would you change about our website?”).
Observational Intercepts: Observational intercepts describe information a  
person gathers from observing behavior. For instance, in a department store, 
an observer might notice that most of the buyers head immediately to the 
sales rack. While you can count the numbers of people who do that, it was an 
observational intercept that brought you to that finding.
In the digital era, the most accessible form of observation is a listening study—
a method of identifying and learning from the conversations most valuable to 
your brand. (In fact, it is such a valuable process that I am devoting Chapter 7 
to an extensive lesson about the tools and steps that help you gain maximum 
value from listening and discovery.)
Research can answer many questions and can help you find the real pain point 
your customers experience. There is often a difference between what people 
say they want and what they really want. For instance, many people will tell 
you that they want to lose weight or get in shape, but their actions tell a dif-
ferent story, one that shows they would rather avoid the gym and binge eat 
while watching reality TV. Research methodologies can help you discover the 
real pain point. This entails asking the right questions and conducting the right 
experiments to find out what your target audience really needs.
I’ll be covering each of these topics with the full context needed to under-
stand and use them correctly throughout the book.
Whether you’re building out your CM strategy by following this book in order 
or are a seasoned pro filling gaps in your experience, return to this section 
when you are ready to conduct primary research or analyze findings. The  
following exercise will prepare you to get the most out of that work.
Exercise 2: Getting Selective
Your goal in this exercise is to determine which types of primary research are 
best for your company. To do that, you will brainstorm with a team member 
and challenge each other’s assumptions. At this point, your gut reaction will 
be a good guide for which methods are most relevant, but let’s make sure you 
consider all the key factors.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
134
First, gather the types of primary research that you would like to do. Audit 
using the questions below and ask an experienced team member to do the 
same. Compare results and discuss.
1.	 What kind of information does your company need to 
grow? (Your answers will form the goals for this research 
project.)
2.	 What is the best way of getting that information? (Asking 
customers directly, observing customers, analyzing the 
results of what your company is already doing?)
3.	 What kind of resources does your company have to 
devote to research? (Are you on your own? Can you pull 
in other teams on this project?)
Tip
■
■
  Think about the reasons that different ways of gathering information may work better than 
others, depending on the purpose. Ultimately, if you know what the goal of your research is, and the 
best way to reach that goal, you can make a strong case for moving forward with your project. For 
example: surveying a large group of people is efficient and the information is easy to tally, but it’s 
harder to get specific feedback. On the other hand, qualitative research requires more time and effort 
to conduct and analyze but usually yields clearer, targeted insights.
Exercise 3: Seeing Is Believing
Your goal with this exercise is to gain consumer insights and identify opportu-
nities for more research. You will do that through individual study.
If your company has a physical location, schedule time to watch how people 
behave from the time they enter the store until they leave. If your compa-
ny’s product or service is strictly online, ask friends if you can observe them  
navigating the company website.
Keep the big picture goals for your company in mind as you observe consum-
ers. There will be a lot of things you notice, but you’ll want to focus on what 
you can learn to help your business. To make these observation sessions  
productive, keep these strategic questions regarding product experience (1–3) 
and environmental experience (4–6) in mind:
1.	 What is the purpose of your company’s product or 
service?
2.	 Do customers understand that purpose easily?
3.	 If additional information is needed, is it easy for customers 
to find that information?

The Community Manager’s Playbook
135
4.	 What do customers look at, or do, when entering the 
store or site?
5.	 How long do customers take to find the product or ser-
vice that your company is selling? (If a website, how many 
clicks does it take them to get to the right page?)
6.	 Do they decide to buy the product?
Observation will yield a surprising amount of data to guide further research, 
content creation, and evolution of the customer experience.
For example: If you observe that customers don’t immediately understand the 
purpose of a product, it should lead you to do more research into the rea-
sons. Some products are complex and require a bit of consumer education. 
That revelation will trigger community management, customer support, and 
content decisions. On the other hand, maybe the way a product is presented 
causes unnecessary confusion. That insight can influence a redesign that 
increases sales because more people finally understand what they’re looking 
at and why they should buy it.
Tip
■
■
  The key word here is “watch,” since observation is about what consumers do naturally, 
without input from you. You may be tempted to jump in and show someone the “right” way to  
use a product. Resist that temptation. Instead, take note of the mistakes they are making. If there  
is a pattern, that is actually a clue that the product or customer experience can be improved in  
some way.
Secondary Research
Secondary research includes all types of research using sources that already 
exist (i.e., you do not need to design new tests or experiments to gather 
information). This information may come from outside your business, but it 
can confirm or correct certain assumptions in the hypothesis you’ve formed.
Examples of secondary research can include sources like industry reports, 
news articles, trade journals, professional organization reports such as those 
from Nielsen and Forrester, case studies on SlideShare, and annual reports. As 
sources, these should be accepted as credible by the industry you are in, and, 
generally, they contain citations or references.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
136
Exercise 4: Fact-Finding Mission
Your goal with this exercise is to find a fact about one of your target audiences 
using individual research.
To begin, conduct online research about the potential target audiences that 
you listed in Exercise 1. If it’s a promising audience, you could learn how to 
reach them. If it’s a less-certain one, you could ascertain if it’s worth pursu-
ing that audience. This will build on Exercise 1, where you created a list of 
potential target audiences and conducted an initial audit to identify areas for 
further research.
If you have no questions coming out of Exercise 1, identify three secondary 
research sources that you should add to your reading list (for example, an 
industry report) or regular monitoring (like a trade journal or industry blog). 
However, I’d challenge you to revisit Exercise 1 if you have zero questions.
Overcome Roadblocks to Discovery
There will be some situations in which you find it difficult to get the informa-
tion you need. For instance, in the Febreze case study, the researchers couldn’t 
determine why their marketing efforts weren’t resonating—until they discov-
ered the customers with the biggest “odor problems” had become desensi-
tized to the smell. This may also apply when your marketing revolves around 
sensitive subject matter, or in situations where the customers have difficulty 
understanding what they need.
Figure 6-1 identifies ways to go deeper with the discovery process if you’re 
feeling stuck. Most issues have solutions if you find the right way to approach 
them.

that information. Source: Perks Consulting.

BRAND VOICE DON’TS
The process for defining target audiences involves making assumptions to form 
hypotheses, conducting research to confirm or correct those starting point assumptions 
and then putting them to use for your business. A certain amount of guesswork is baked 
into this process. However, there are some common mistakes that I want to help you 
avoid.
Avoid gender blur. It’s important to know the gender of your target audience and to tailor 
your marketing accordingly. However, companies sometimes fall into the trap of defining 
men and women by stereotypical roles. In this modern era, these roles are changing 
rapidly. For example: there are more women in high-level corporate jobs and more men 
staying home to take care of housework and children. Capture assumptions about 
gender as a starting point, but remember to do your research to confirm or correct.
Speak the same language. It’s easy to forget that your audience has different interests 
and expectations than you or your brand. Remember to focus on the language and 
topics that feel natural to your target groups. Being able to speak to your audience in 
a way that they understand will make your brand more authentic to consumers. This is 
why researchers will go to great pains to understand what teenagers are talking about 
or to try to understand the internal discourse of subcultures.
Don’t be selfish. Being self-referential in your discourse can make the brand personality 
seem narcissistic. Instead, think about what your audience would like to read, learn or 
experience, so that you can create thoughtful content that creates value for the people 
coming to your site, blog or social network. Ultimately, this will encourage people to trust 
you, return repeatedly and tell others about you.
The Audience Process: Step 3. Profile
In Step 1. Ideation, you built a list of potential target audiences and audited 
each idea. This led to an audience hypothesis. In Step 2: Discovery, you learned 
many ways to conduct research to confirm or correct assumptions you made 
in Step 1. This helped you refine your hypothesis. Now it’s time to create a 
profile, which is a data-driven understanding of your target audience.
Exercise 5: Become a Profiler
A profile is the synthesis of all the information you’ve gathered so far. Let’s 
begin by assessing the findings of your research.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
138
Refine
So far, you’ve identified multiple groups of people as potential customers. The 
initial audit in Step 1 might have helped you rule out some of the less likely 
groups. Let’s use your market research and knowledge of your company’s 
goals to focus even more on the right target audiences.
Gather your resources:
Get your most current list of potential target audiences.
• 
Organize research from Exercise 4: Fact-Finding Mission 
• 
(secondary research) and Exercise 3: Seeing is Believing 
(listening and observation) by listing insights and facts 
you’ve learned about each group on your list.
Pull the big picture goals of your company for refer-
• 
ence. This might come from the Chapter 1: Internal 
Assessments, or Chapter 5: Business Needs, or both.
With all of this information in front of you, you can make an informed decision 
about whether each idea is truly a target audience. Here are some thought-
starter questions to guide you:
Is this group really interested in your products (or 
• 
services)?
Will this group help your company achieve its business 
• 
goals?
For example, a luxury jeweler might research different target audiences and 
find out that one group would like the jewelry to be less expensive. However, 
the jeweler has a reputation for high-end pieces that are very expensive. In 
this case, the choice would be to focus on consumers who understand the 
value of the high-end pieces and are willing to purchase at that price point. 
The group that wants less-expensive options may be an audience to explore 
in the future, but it should not be an immediate priority. 
Tip
■
■
  This is also a good litmus test for protecting your brand. Making strategic target audience 
choices is what distinguishes companies like Neiman Marcus from Macy’s.
Clarify
Now that you’ve ruled out audiences that aren’t the strongest fit for your 
business, let’s clarify the audiences that you kept. Go down your list and define 
your audience focus as specifically as possible.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
139
We discussed the 4 categories of segmentation earlier in this chapter.  
I’m listing them here again to help you define each target group as clearly as 
you can.
1.	 Demographic (baseline characteristics): age, gender, 
marital status, income, religion, occupation, ethnicity, 
education.
2.	 Geographic (where they live and why): country, state, city, 
neighborhood.
3.	 Psychographic (what they believe in and worry about): 
politics, religion, values, lifestyle, attitudes, self-image, 
personality.
4.	 Behavioral (what they do regularly): daily routine, habits, 
types of activities, places they frequent.
There is no one right way to go through this process. If you feel that you are 
lacking some critical information, go back to Step 2: Discovery, and do the 
research needed to get that information. If you’re feeling stuck, figure out the 
question that you’re trying to answer; this will tell you what kind of research 
to do.
Sometimes it’s hard to gain perspective if you’re used to thinking of customers 
as one indistinct category. Challenge yourself to push harder if you are making 
no changes to your list. Ask if each audience on your list can be broken up 
into smaller groups that are still meaningful.
For example, a business that sells surfing equipment could list surfers as a 
target audience, but that group can be further divided into beginners, sea-
soned amateurs, and professionals. All three subgroups overlap in some ways 
and have very different needs in other ways. Now that there are three target 
audience segments defined, instead of one big group that lumps all of those 
people together, the surfing equipment company can figure out how to meet 
the specific needs of each subgroup (or choose not to, if it’s not pertinent to 
their business).
The depth of understanding that you gain from this exercise will induce smart, 
strategic community management decisions.
The Audience Process: Step 4. Create a Persona
Great news! Now that you’ve done all the brainstorming, research and defini-
tion work, it’s time to have some fun. Creating a persona is a bit like writing 
a (very useful) short story. Basically, you use the traits listed in your audience 
profile to describe your “ideal” customer.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
140
This is a tool that makes all the information you’ve collected feel tangible and 
relevant in work situations by asking, “What would this persona want right 
now?” Many brands use this tool to build communication and marketing strat-
egies because it defines such a clear target.
Creating a persona can also help keep a growing team on the same page. In 
many organizations, once they reach a certain critical mass, the major players 
in the business can lose sight of their target audience, and may miscommu-
nicate or make decisions without thinking about the customer. The charac-
ters you create with this exercise become reference points for your team, 
and, since they are based on factual data, can help support a clear vision for 
major brand decisions like partnerships with other companies or deciding if 
an action would be off-brand.
Exercise 6: What a Character!
Your goal is to create a persona for each of your brand’s target audience  
segments, something you will do through an individual exercise. Start by 
answering questions on the persona checklist:
1.	 What is the person’s first and last name, age, gender, per-
sonal information, job description? What does he or she 
look like? (Find a photo online.)
2.	 What are a few details about the person’s life—an inter-
est or a habit—that makes each person unique and mem-
orable? (Make this person come to life.)
3.	 How does this person spend their day? Sketch out a brief 
outline of their daily work routines or home schedule, 
highlighting specific habits, likes, and dislikes.
4.	 What is this person’s work environment? Describe hab-
its, personal and professional goals, and colleagues with 
whom the person works most closely.
5.	 Do the same for the person’s life outside of work. Where 
do they hang out and who do they hang with?
6.	 What comprises their “me” time? What media, leisure 
activities and hobbies do they enjoy? When and where 
would they be interested in your product or learning 
about your product?
7.	 Who influences them? Who do they talk to about the 
pain point they’re experiencing?

The Community Manager’s Playbook
141
Once you’ve answered these questions, it’s time to put your responses together 
into an interesting visual representation of your target audience. Remember, 
you’ll be creating one for each different segment, so make sure your answers 
only relate to one different type of audience member (as opposed to trying to 
cover the entire spectrum of types of people you might consider your target). 
Take all your answers and organize them around the photo you’ve selected 
from the Internet. List the types of things that person might be interested 
in, how that person spends their day, and all of the answers above to try to 
create a persona. Essentially, this imaginary person serves as a barometer for 
your marketing materials. You should be able to ask, “Would this person think 
what I’m doing is cool and appropriate?” If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve 
succeeding in matching the brand to the target audience.
While you are making up a lot of the individual details for each persona, 
remember to base those details on the information you’ve gathered. This will 
make the personas highly effective as tools for your brand.
Further, refer to the personas that you create when it’s time to define the edi-
torial style for your brand. Because it’s easier to picture writing to a specific 
person (instead of memorizing a page of rules about how to write), this is a 
great tool to explain brand voice and tone to the people who create content 
for your company.
GETTING IT RIGHT: DROPBOX
When good brands get the audience right, there’s no stopping how far that can take 
them. One great example of a business that really understood its audience, and a 
significant pain point this audience experienced, is Dropbox, a portable hard drive and 
online service to help people share files. File sharing was traditionally problematic, and 
as more and more jobs turned digital, people were having a tough time trying to send 
files online. Often, they were too large to be sent via email, but existing file sharing 
programs were clunky and inefficient.
Dropbox recognized the need to create a tool that could make transferring large files 
much easier. While it knew it had a winning tool, it needed to find the right audience to 
appreciate how much better its technology was.
So, Dropbox identified the key question they needed to ask: Which group is tech-
savvy and needs to share large files on a regular basis? Based on their research, they 
targeted early tech adopters, calling attention to the problems they solved, plus the 
added benefits of using their service.
Today, Dropbox serves 275 million users and 4 million businesses, demonstrating how 
important it is to know your target audience.

Now that we’ve discussed why finding your target audience is critical, it’s time 
to focus on the B of your ABCs: Brand. Some people believe the B should 
stand for Business. Both are equally important, but I focus on the impor-
tance of brand because many startups make the mistake of delaying building 
their brand. Some even forget about it entirely, never truly understanding the 
importance of branding and failing to stay afloat in a sea of competitors.
My philosophy is that the brand and the business must be aligned in order 
to create a strong, cohesive impact on the market. The fast pace of today’s 
digital landscape means that companies have to be memorable or fade away 
unnoticed.
In Chapter 5, we discussed in detail the business reason for a company’s exis-
tence, the “why” of the community manager role. Then, at the beginning of 
this chapter, we deliberated on the audience: why they’re important and how 
to find them. We’ll explore some of the ways to discover them through online 
listening in Chapter 7. Together, these items drive the brand content, identity, 
and personality. That’s your brand, the conduit to your customers.
By creating brand foundations from the start, you can attract customers and 
sell the value of your business. If you don’t do this while the company is young, 
you’ll be stuck trying to figure out branding as you go, which typically makes 
for a disjointed brand experience and, ultimately, an overhaul of all brand 
assets.
What Is Brand?
We encounter brands every day. Not just through the marketing and adver-
tising efforts we see on billboards, TV commercials, and social media, but in 
our daily routines. I’m typing this on my MacBook Air, skimming articles on 
TechCrunch, and breaking up my day with snacks I got from Trader Joe’s. I’ve 
come to know all of these brands, to the extent that I’ve developed relation-
ships with them and prefer them to competitors.
But What Is Brand, Really? The definition:
Here’s how I define brand: “The intangible personality, representation and  
attitude of a business, organization, product, person, place or thing.” That’s 
right . . . even people have brands.
Brands may be intangible, but you can use language to bring them to life.  
For example, a company may be eco-friendly, affordable, exclusive, innovative, 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
143
or a blend of all those things. By defining which characteristics are part of your 
company’s DNA, you can define the brand voice and how to communicate 
your company’s mission and vision.
The goal of creating and maintaining a brand identity is to create an emotional 
relationship and connection with your customer on a conscious and subcon-
scious level. There’s a reason many people instinctively know Nike’s slogan 
or only trust Amazon for online shopping. Strong brands stand out from the 
competition.
A brand isn’t just the logo, tagline, or ad campaign. These are decisions made 
after the brand has already been defined. The key is that brand should always 
feel consistent in the way it looks and sounds.
If marketing is what you tell audiences about your business, then brand is the 
lens through which consumers see and experience your business. This is why 
companies work so hard to protect their brands. A strong brand helps drive 
the customer experience. When aspects of a business seem “off-brand,” peo-
ple notice and feel uncomfortable. Over time, this will downgrade customer 
experience, and they may never return.
For example, think about a luxury brand that has a clunky, ugly website, or 
a favorite electronics brand that suddenly starts sending a barrage of email 
spam to sell products. Both of these are examples of ways that a company 
might do something off-brand that will erode consumer trust.
Why Is Brand Important?
Let’s break down some of the reasons why brand is integral to the growth and 
direction of the business.
1.	 Sales: If you don’t have a brand identity, then there’s no 
way for people to understand how you’re different from 
competitors. When you put your brand name on a prod-
uct, it serves as your seal of approval, and people begin 
to recognize your brand when they see your product or 
service. This brand recognition in turn leads to more 
interaction, which, if leveraged effectively, can help sell 
more products or services.
2.	 Trust: Building on the first point, it’s up to consumers 
whether they will purchase your product or use your 
service. Having a recognizable brand they trust makes the 
choice easy for your target customers.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
144
3.	 Communication: Companies need to have a clear, solid 
vision that they communicate. If customers can’t get a 
handle on what a business believes in, either because it 
doesn’t have a clear voice or gives different answers at 
different times, they will not trust the company. Brand 
communications need to have a consistent voice and 
vision, as inconsistency dilutes the power of the brand. 
Communicating consistently with target audiences will 
drive good business growth.
4.	 Consistency: A defined brand voice and vision will keep a 
team cohesive in the way it communicates. This includes 
not only communications, but also internal conversa-
tions, business strategy, growth options, and strategic 
partnerships.
Why We Love the Brands We Love
Think of a brand that has impacted your life in a positive way. Now, think about 
your interaction with that brand. There’s a strong possibility that it was one 
of these three reasons that made you love it: relationship, differentiation, or 
experience.
Relationship: In the same way that we have relationships with other humans, 
we have relationships with the brands that are part of our daily lives. You 
might like Amazon because you find the brand trustworthy and reliable, or 
you might choose to buy Nike because you’re a rabid sports junkie. Brands 
can help build these relationships through the products and services they 
offer, but also in keeping the conversation going through marketing, advertis-
ing and community efforts. Brand relationship efforts lead to advocacy, and to 
trust and loyalty to the brand.
Differentiation: It can be incredibly difficult for a brand to compete if people 
don’t understand why it is different from other companies that offer similar 
products or services. The list of possible differentiators is a long one, but 
some of the most effective ones include aesthetic, price, quality and conve-
nience. A great differentiator (why you’re different) is also a clear competi-
tive advantage (why you’re better). This can make a big impact in customers 
choosing your brand over another, whether they’re staring at a store shelf or 
online webpage, deciding what to buy.
Experience: Companies spend millions of dollars to create a brand experi-
ence that speaks to its target audience. For example, think about Red Bull, 
which sponsors numerous athletic events. In addition to these sponsorships, it 
also has websites dedicated to posting content about these events and social 
media activity full of updates and fresh content. Red Bull’s goal is to get people 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
145
excited about the brand by building events that are fun and meaningful to its 
target audiences. People end up associating the feelings they get from these 
experiences with the brand, which leads to long-term loyalty.
Putting the Pieces Together
It’s extremely important to have a firm grasp on your brand in order to be a 
successful community manager. Brand is one of the cornerstones of an effec-
tive business, though perhaps surprisingly, some young companies fail to focus 
on this critical step and skip developing a strong brand strategy.
There is no one right way to build a brand, which is why corporations often 
spend millions trying to find the answers to some of the brand strategy 
questions listed above. Because there isn’t an easy step-by-step way to build 
brand, I focus on teaching a strategic thought process (see below) that leaves 
room for intuition. This is an approach you can apply to any company that 
you build or work for. The more experience you gain, the more you can 
achieve with it.
What Is Brand Strategy?
It’s important to have a plan that drives the growth and development of a brand 
because it doesn’t happen organically (although smart brands will make note 
of things that customers naturally connect to and build on those points).
Brand strategy is the process of defining traits that power and differenti-
ate your business, and that help create a clear-cut vision. The brand strategy 
defines how you plan to deliver your brand’s messages to your target audi-
ences, and is typically based on the information you’ve developed through the 
target audience exercises. Developing a clear brand strategy takes time and 
energy but is much easier when you’ve done the groundwork to figure out 
your target audience and the best ways to reach them.
Brand strategy can also be defined as the long-term marketing support system 
for the brand, focused on the characteristics and needs of the target consum-
ers. Remember all that target audience fact-finding you did in the Audience 
section? Get ready to put all of that work to good use.
Your brand strategy will clearly outline the positioning, personality, promise, 
essence, and attributes of your brand. It will also serve as a clear point of ref-
erence to help you protect and defend the brand and its mission. The brand 
strategy is constantly evolving to keep up with both internal and external 
changes. Rather than acting as a shortsighted or singular solution, the brand 
strategy will provide a holistic approach to your business trajectory.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
146
This process should also help inform the community strategy. While they 
are separate strategies, having a clear brand strategy document can lay the 
foundation for the business’s community plan. The brand strategy should give 
a clear picture of the brand as a whole, and the community strategy can then 
help improve the relationships with the relevant audience.

  A strong customer focus is at the heart of brand strategy. I know from experience that 
in those big brainstorming meetings, with executives who only want to talk about the bottom line, 
it suddenly becomes easy to put the business before the customer. Unfortunately, this approach 
doesn’t succeed in the long run. By understanding the consumer, you learn their preferences and 
their expectations, which will help the brand stay relevant as it grows and evolves.
The Different Facets of Brand Strategy
By working to define concrete answers to these questions, you will be able to 
craft a strong brand strategy:
Positioning: What is your business’s place among competitors? What need 
does it fill and how does it fill it differently than other businesses? The answers  
to these questions can help you to make strategic decisions further down  
the line.
Promise: When people purchase your product or use your service, what are 
you offering them? How are you keeping that promise? Be it a commitment to 
healthy lifestyle, innovation, social good, or simply convenience, it’s important 
to find a brand promise you can stand behind.
Essence: What does the consumer feel during an interaction with the brand? 
As an authentic representation of your business, this will ultimately drive the 
brand voice and aesthetic.
Personality and attributes: Is your brand a hero, or more like a good friend? 
Somewhere in between? Maybe it’s quirky or wise. Defining the brand person-
ality aids in making decisions about whether things like opportunities, partner-
ships or even employees are “on-brand.”
Awareness: How well do people recognize your brand in the market? Are their 
associations and perceptions correct?

Exercise 7: Create a Brand Brief
In this exercise, you will create a brand “brief” for your company. It is an indi-
vidual exercise. First, an explanation.
A good brand brief should be the go-to document to provide an overview 
of the brand at a glance. The creation of this document should help to create 
consistency across different components of your brand, and it should set the 
strategic foundation for long-term branding. Ultimately, it should help clear up 
any disconnect between what the company produces and what the customer 
expects.
This is a useful tool for companies of all sizes. Small companies that don’t 
have the time or resources to create full branding documentation can use the 
brief to define key concepts. At the other end of the spectrum, large compa-
nies may have so much branding documentation that information gets lost. In 
those cases, the brand brief is a handy one-page overview that distills all that 
research for team members.
No matter what size your company is, the brief will inform your community 
strategy.
The brand brief is comprised of 9 key elements: mission, promise, value  
proposition, competitive advantage, key competitors, target market, attributes, 
key stakeholders, and core products and services. Using everything you’ve 
learned so far, work through these questions to create an initial draft of your 
brand brief.
Let’s look at each element more closely:
Mission: How does your company plan deliver on its 
• 
vision?
Promise: What expectations are you setting with your 
• 
customer?
Value Proposition: What benefits support that promise?
• 
Competitive Advantage: What makes your business 
• 
different?
Key Competitors: Identify at least three other major play-
• 
ers in the competitive landscape.
Target Market: Who is your audience?
• 

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
148
Attributes: What are the prime characteristics of the 
• 
brand and its personality?
Key Stakeholders: Who are the main people, groups and 
• 
organizations within your company?
Core Products and Services: What are the most impor-
• 
tant products and services you offer?
Take your time to answer these questions carefully. Once you have an initial 
draft, audit the strategic strength of your work by asking:
“How does each element support the ’big idea’ of my company?” Edit accord-
ingly. You now have a brand brief. In essence, it is a snapshot of the company 
vision. Each element of the brief provides a bite-sized piece of that vision. 
By understanding what your business does and why, it will help solidify rela-
tionships with the right audiences that will grow or maintain your business. 
Challenge yourself to make this document as strong as possible, and you will 
reap the benefits in the form of community interest, engagement and loyalty.
Tip

■
  A brand brief is a living document. As you learn more about your target audiences or your 
business evolves, it’s wise to revisit these elements to check if anything has changed.
What Is Your Brand?
If you’re starting with an existing brand, one of the best ways to supplement 
the brand brief is by conducting a brand audit. While this subject alone could 
fill a whole book, I’m going to focus on the information that’s relevant to com-
munity management.
A brand audit is an assessment of your brand in its current state from both 
internal and external perspectives. The goal is to identify if there’s a discon-
nect between the brand brief and the current brand.
Internally, a brand audit can help you understand the core values and adjust 
actions accordingly. Externally, it can serve to help you understand changes in 
the target market, competition and economic environment. As such, it helps 
you understand and identify where you stand in the marketplace.

WHAT DOES ALL THIS HAVE TO DO WITH 
COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT?
I’m sure a lot of CMs out there are wondering what all of this has to do with community 
management. I promise that it’s relevant. In fact, this is the knowledge that will make you 
stand out as a CM, because it will help you understand the company vision and how 
it connects to your audience. The following is an overview of how understanding your 
brand in depth will make you more effective.
Decision Making
Community managers should have a special relationship with the brand, as it’s an 
integral part of community building. Every decision should reflect the brand’s core 
values. With a strong brand brief, community managers have information about how to 
position the brand in any public setting. Focusing on those aspects that are crucial to 
the brand and outlining them in a single document is the most concise way to help drive 
these brand representations.
Customer Experience
From a community perspective, the brand brief should help solidify the approach you 
want to take in interacting and engaging with your audience. Failing to adhere to a 
set of consistent actions is a recipe for failure, because each business misstep risks 
diminishing credibility and weakening the brand. Remember that potential customers 
have to be able to trust your brand before they invest time or resources into it. You 
can facilitate this trust by giving your audience a reliable, uncompromising brand 
experience.
Content
The brief should also inform the brand’s voice, whether it vocalizes a set of official 
guidelines, or enables an intuitive understanding of the brand. The brief will also inform 
the types of content to curate and create. When deciding whether a certain statement 
is on-brand for your business, the brand brief can help guide the answer. For example, 
if your brand brief supports a company commitment to social good, the community 
strategy may involve outreach efforts to help facilitate partnerships and relationships 
with active members of those social good communities, which will yield even richer 
content and engagement.
Exercise 8: Conduct a Lean Brand Audit
The goal of this exercise is to identify any disconnects between your brand 
brief and current actions. The audit and its interpretation are done individu-
ally, but you should also schedule a team discussion.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
150
What’s more, a brand audit will provide opportunities to understand your 
brand at a deeper level and identify areas for improvement. For the purposes 
of this book, you can conduct a lean audit with a run-through of the questions 
below.
A quick note: here, I explain how to conduct a lean brand audit. At high-pow-
ered, large corporations, brand audits can be extremely intensive and can cost 
thousands or even millions of dollars. At that scale, you may wish to consult 
additional resources to help conduct a comprehensive brand audit.
The Process: Audit, Interpret, Present
Using your target audience profile, personas, and brand brief as reference 
points, work through the elements of a brand audit (listed below). Go as in-
depth as your timeline and workload allows (although this seems outside the 
scope of a CM role, I promise this is very relevant to doing the job well).
As you go through the effort, you might learn that your company is already 
doing many of the things it should, or you might discover that some  
processes are actually working against your goals. Either way, make note of 
these findings.
Compile your observations and insights (what’s working, what’s missing and 
what’s completely off-brand). They will serve as key discussion points when 
you present the results of your audit. If the missing or off-brand actions can  
be addressed through community management, suggest recommendations. 
This will inform your CM strategy.
Set up a team meeting to discuss your work. You’ll want all the decision  
makers, the people who can give you the go-ahead for your CM recommenda-
tions, in the room so you can achieve all your goals for the meeting:
1.	 Understand where your brand stands
2.	 Explain how CM team can help your brand
3.	 Get approval to begin acting on those recommendations

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE COOL?
In New York City circa 2003, you couldn’t go to any dive bar without seeing a group of 
hipsters sipping on their cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR). As a dirt-cheap option, it’s 
no surprise that hipsters, many of whom were struggling writers, artists, and musicians, 
would choose to drink it. But there are a lot of other cheap beers that don’t gain the 
popularity that PBR did. PBR had a reputation as an old man’s beer, only suitable for 
serious drinkers—ironically, the kind of people who disliked hipsters.
Some people guess that the strong irony is why hipsters love this beer. Perhaps the fact 
that it had a strong brand identity with an entirely different subset of beer drinkers made 
it appealing. Actions like boasting that PBR was voted America’s Best in 1893 makes 
the brand even more enticing because it’s both self-effacing and earnest.
What exactly was the allure of this brand? More importantly, what can we learn and 
apply to our own brands?
Whether or not PBR was involved in starting this trend, the brand has grown it by 
building a thoughtful strategy around this audience. PBR has opted not to exploit its 
hipster status through advertising to the masses, which would have been tempting to 
increase sales. Instead, it developed relationships with its niche following through indie 
music sponsorships, facial hair club promotions, local businesses, and dive bars.
We may never know (or control) the exact combination of factors that turns a brand 
into a trend, but we can set our companies up to be in the position to make the most of  
it by understanding our target audience and brand identity and how they relate to  
each other.
C is for Category (and Competition)
Now that we’ve covered the audience and brand, it’s time to discuss the big 
Cs: category and competition. In discussing brand category and competition, 
we can help understand how this all comes together to form the fundamen-
tals of an actionable community strategy.
Understanding Category and Competition
So, what is category? Category is a broader picture of the market landscape 
than just your business and its direct competitors.
As mentioned, Crunch’s category is fitness, which includes gyms as well as 
health food and vitamin stores like GNC and The Vitamin Shop, apparel com-
panies like Nike and lululemon, and specialty athletic stores like City Sports.
In contrast with category, competitors are more narrowly defined, both direct 
and indirect.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
153
Direct competitors are other companies or businesses that a person could 
potentially go to get a similar product or service. For Crunch, this would mean 
competing gyms like Equinox, New York Sports Club, and David Barton Gym. 
In the fitness space, these are direct competitors because they offer similar 
classes and equipment, and are in similar locations. If customers were mak-
ing a decision based purely on the product or service, there would not be a 
significant difference between them (which is why I believe in the importance 
of brand!).
Indirect competitors are businesses whose products and services are differ-
ent, but could still attract some of your target audience. Using the Crunch 
example again, this would mean specialty fitness programs like Barry’s Boot 
camp, Physique 57, and Asphalt Green. It could also mean online fitness com-
munities like Greatist and TNT, which provide resources for people to stay fit 
without going to a gym. Because this definition is so open, companies have to 
base their idea of indirect competition on their unique business needs.
Tip
■
■
  When thinking about competitors, make sure to also differentiate between true competitors 
and adjacent companies, which are in the same space but do not necessarily compete. Using the 
Crunch example, this may mean a health food company that sells its products at Crunch, but is not 
necessarily exclusive to Crunch.
By now, it shouldn’t surprise you that I’m going to point you back to your 
target audience to truly understand what your category is and who your 
competitors are. In understanding what your customers need and what kind 
of solutions fit their lives, you will understand who else is vying for their atten-
tion. Then just make your company the best at meeting customer needs!
Why Category and Competition Are Important
No business exists in a vacuum. In order to have a firm grasp of your indus-
try and your brand’s community, it is important to keep up with trends in 
the space by looking at the activities of brands who are connected to yours. 
In fact, you can use them as a reference point when deciding which kinds of 
community outreach strategies might be most effective, because you can see 
what’s working best for them. You can look to their successes to help influ-
ence your own actions.
Identifying category trends and competitors can help you find new ways to 
reach your target audience, either through new communication strategies, 
products, or content ideas. Knowing your category and competitive landscape 
helps keep you relevant.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
154
Exercise 9: Define Your Category and Competition
Let’s move on to defining the category for your own company. In the business 
world, there are a number of different approaches, but I’ve chosen the one 
that is most relevant to community managers: a consumer-based definition. In 
other words, how does your target audience define your category?
Gather your reference materials from Exercises 5-7: audience profiles, perso-
nas, and brand brief. Based on your company’s product or service, ask these 
questions:
1.	 Why do customers want or need this?
2.	 How does it fit into their lives? (How often do they use 
it, routine vs. special occasion?)
3.	 What can they use instead of my company’s product or 
service? (Direct vs. indirect competitors.)
4.	 Where would they go to buy it?
5.	 What category would customers put this product or ser-
vice into?
Defining a category seems like it should be easy, but it can get tricky. Let’s run 
through two examples to bring this to life for you.
Example A: Toothpaste 
If your product is toothpaste, it’s pretty straightforward:
1.	 Why do customers want or need this? To clean their teeth.
2.	 How does it fit into their lives? As part of a daily routine, 
brushing their teeth twice a day.
3.	 What can they use instead of my company’s product or ser-
vice? Direct competitors: all other toothpaste brands. 
Indirect competitors: mouthwash brands, gum.
4.	 Where would they go to buy it? Grocery stores, drug stores, 
convenience stores, online stores.
5.	 What category would customers put this product or service 
into? Personal care, hygiene.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
155
Example B: Yogurt
Now let’s look at another common product, yogurt:
1.	 Why do customers want or need this? To eat for breakfast. 
To eat as a snack. To use as an ingredient in recipes.
2.	 How does it fit into their lives? For breakfast, as part of a 
daily routine. As a healthier alternative to other snacks, a 
couple times a week. Very rarely, when a recipe lists it as 
an ingredient.
3.	 What can they use instead of my company’s product or ser-
vice? Direct competitors: all other yogurt brands. Indirect 
competitors: (as breakfast) eggs, milk and cereal, (as 
healthy snack) granola bars, smoothies, nuts, fruits, (as 
ingredient) possibly other dairy products.
4.	 Where would they go to buy it? Grocery stores, conve-
nience stores.
5.	 What category would customers put this product or service 
into? Breakfast foods, snacks, ingredients.
If most of this company’s customers think of yogurt as a snack food but all 
of the company’s content and messaging is about breakfast, they are going to 
cause confusion and lose their core customers.
This is when a strong understanding of your target audience’s perspective 
comes in handy. If you know how and why they do business with your com-
pany, you will know who your real competition is and how to position yourself 
so that you stand out from the crowd.
At this point, you should use category and competition definition to guide fur-
ther research. Using Example B again, if that yogurt company knew a lot about 
breakfast foods, but discovered it was perceived as a snack food, it would need 
to learn a lot about this new category and how to stay competitive in it. Revisit 
Exercise 4: Secondary Research if you have specific questions to answer about 
your category and competition. Chapter 7: Listening and Discovery will also 
teach you how to gain valuable consumer insights.
Exercise 10: Analyze Your Data
As with almost anything in marketing, gaining an insight requires going in with 
a sound hypothesis, testing, analysis, conclusions and further testing. This is no 
different when you’re identifying what you’re trying to learn from your cat-
egory or competitors. Otherwise, your research will lead you down a rabbit 
hole of information that may not be relevant to your business.

Chapter 6 | The ABCs of Landscape Analysis
156
Hypothesize
Move forward with your strategy by forming a hypothesis about your  
category, competitors, and target customers. Building on that yogurt example, 
a simple hypothesis would be: our core customers eat yogurt as a healthy 
snack. We can make them happy and reach more people like them by provid-
ing fitness content.
Research 
Once you have that hypothesis, do your homework. The yogurt company will 
have to research what kind of fitness content interests their customers. Use 
what you learned in Exercise 3: Seeing is Believing. If people in your category 
have storefronts, visit these places in person. Talk to people who are shopping. 
Get as much data as you can about why people love those brands and how 
they use and interact with such brands in their everyday lives. If the service 
is exclusively online or app-based, look at feature sets and reviews. You can 
do this both for category (to help you identify trends) and for competitors  
(to help you identify your own brand’s strengths and weaknesses).
Analyze
Then, make a table charting the differences. You can either line them up side 
by side and make bullet point lists to review their attributes at a glance, or, if 
you’re analyzing direct competitors, you can make a checklist of features and 
tally them as they apply to each brand. By now, you should be seeing some 
key differences in why some brands are doing better than others. By focusing 
on what these are, you can apply your learnings more effectively. Pay careful 
attention to what is working, and compare it to what is not working.
Draw Conclusions 
Once you’ve taken a hard look at your data, compare that data with your own 
brand. Look for strengths and areas of improvement. What are other compa-
nies doing right, and what can you take away from that? Assess areas for more 
research, which may mean determining areas that require more financial or 
resource investment within your own business.
And That Brings Us to Our Own Conclusion!
We’ve spent a lot of time addressing the three major aspects of community: 
Audience, Brand, and Category. This is important groundwork for building 
and maintaining a strong community strategy.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
157
When a brand can successfully align its ABCs, it becomes consistent across 
different components of the business. It creates a connection between what 
the company produces and what people expect. A great brand makes this 
look easy, but there’s actually a ton of work in the background to execute this 
well (as you’ve learned).
This chapter has equipped you with a set of tools for achieving this alignment. 
Before moving on, you should be able to:
Understand the ABCs: Audience, Brand and Category.
• 
Define the ABCs for your company.
• 
Design a research plan that adds to your knowledge.
• 
Create company assets that support brand building: user 
• 
profiles, personas, brand brief.
Conduct a lean brand audit.
• 
Draw conclusions for improving your strategy.
• 
All of these tools work together to develop a complete view of your business 
and your community by capturing what you know, identifying what you don’t 
know, and filling in the gaps. In doing this, you can form ideas about areas for 
more potential research and exploration, including further discovery, listening 
and engagement. This will serve you well in any business or industry.
A Final Note Regarding the ABCs
Understanding the ABCs is vital to excelling as a community manager.  
As much information as I packed into this chapter, I could only skim the  
surface of Brand and Category, focusing only on the parts that relate to com-
munity management.
As you continue to learn and grow, there are many excellent resources to 
round out your knowledge. I recommend that you supplement your ­knowledge 
of brand audit and the category landscape with additional reading, webinars, 
or classes.

Listening  
and Discovery
Build your Community Strategy with Insight 
from your Audience, Brand, and Category
Chapter 6 gave you a strong foundational knowledge of the ABCs assessment: 
Audience, Brand, and Category. By now, you know what each topic is, why it  
matters and how to apply that information to your specific business. That said, 
digital marketers are not magicians (although the good ones seem to be!), so 
you may be asking how you’re supposed to know what you really need to 
know for success with the ABCs.
In the last chapter, we talked a lot about the importance of understanding 
your audience. But, understanding your audience will get you nowhere if you 
lack a clear understanding of how your audience feels about your brand’s 
products or services.
The answer (or a huge part of it) to “what do they think about us?” is in this 
chapter. I am going to take you step by step through one of the most impor-
tant tools in the CM tool belt: listening and discovery. In the digital marketing 
world, this refers to the strategy of scouring the Internet for insights about 
key audiences, the current landscape, and the competition. This process will 
enable you to conduct robust research and monitor consumer sentiment for 
a wide array of information.

What Is Listening and Discovery?
Listening and discovery helps brands understand their market by examining 
social media. The listening portion refers to actively seeking out information 
about relevant social media conversations surrounding one’s market, while 
discovery is the act of drawing valuable insights from those conversations. 
Let’s take a deeper dive into this process.
Online listening and the discovery process, sometimes also called social search, 
is the process of filtering the noise on different online platforms, extracting 
brand mentions or content that matters to your brand, and using them to gain 
insights that allow you to make important business decisions. Put simply, you 
listen online to inform your business choices. These online mentions offer a 
tremendous amount of data that can have a major impact on the brand’s mar-
keting strategies, and, in turn, inspire serious strategies to improve a business’s 
Return on Investment (ROI).
Traditionally, companies had to rely on surveys and focus groups in order to 
gauge the effectiveness of new products, campaigns, and marketing services. 
While focus groups and surveys are useful, they’re also pretty pricey and only 
provide information about specific sets of questions and how a select group 
of people answers them.
The internet, especially social media, has created exponentially more opportu-
nities to get real-time information about consumer reactions to the products 
and services that affect their everyday lives. More importantly, this is unfiltered 
information that a massive population offers freely.
Companies who understand how to use listening and discovery can gain direct 
access to the opinions of their target audience. Because so many people are 
volunteering information about the products and services they love—along 
with those they love to hate—social media listening affords a compelling 
opportunity to evaluate the audience’s mood.
Not only can online listening help community managers identify consumer 
sentiment, it also allows them to examine the competitive landscape and iden-
tify market opportunities.
For brands, this can be both powerful and frustrating. Powerful, because there 
is an bottomless well of consumer data to analyze about a brand or market. 
Frustrating, because there is so much data to mine to find the most useful 
information for the business. It is hard to know what to look for, and even 
harder to decipher the cause and effect of certain information patterns.
Does that seem a bit overwhelming? Don’t worry. I’ll be taking you through a 
number of techniques, strategies, and tools that community managers use to 
help power through this data.

Improve and Grow
Before we continue, keep in mind that a lot of digital marketing concepts 
are iterative. What you learn from one initiative can be used to refine your  
strategy so that you are constantly improving and growing over time.
This is especially true in community management. At its core, this practice is 
all about relationship building. So the more you learn about your audience, the 
more you should reflect it in your content and communications.
I’m bringing this up now, because you can use what you learn in this chapter 
and the previous one to create a dynamic feedback loop that keeps customers 
and community members happy, while also telling your company how to keep 
growing in sustainable ways that make sense in the marketplace. The more you 
practice what you learn, the more you’ll get a feel for how fluid this process 
is, and find opportunities to make the most of it.
IT PAYS TO BE A GOOD LISTENER
Think about the last big thing you bought for yourself. Not a bill you had to pay but a 
product or service that you chose to spend money on.
Did you look up customer reviews? Did you ask family and friends if they had 
recommendations? Did anyone share an experience that helped you make your 
decision?
Word-of-mouth marketing is incredibly powerful, and the digital landscape has produced 
a wealth of tools to enable it. Every time a person uses social media to post a rave 
review, it draws new business and builds brand value.
Even bad news can be good news. When negative feedback is sent or posted publicly, 
companies have more ways than ever to transform unhappy customers into enthusiastic 
fans of the brand. Community managers are the gateway to success. By funneling 
feedback to the right teams, you can turn customers into an enthusiastic team of product 
testers and marketers!
Listening and discovery is a vital step on the road to community management success. 
You have to know what people are saying about your business before you can plan your 
response.
Drawing upon that data allows marketers to truly understand the customer, and to 
design strategies to facilitate positive interactions. But the insights don’t stop there. 
Marketers can also use social media listening to learn more about their competitors, to 
better understand their own online communities, and to reach out to influencers to help 
drive marketing efforts.

Why Listening and Discovery Is So Important
Businesses have plenty to gain through social media listening. Just as online 
listening can help a business owner or marketer make important decisions 
about brands, it can also help save the business money and contribute to the 
bottom line.
Online listening offers valuable and cost-effective ways to gain insights to help 
grow your brand or business. Marketers apply these insights in many ways. 
Lots of positive mentions regarding a recent marketing campaign could prove 
that people are receptive to the campaign, which is great information for help-
ing form future marketing campaigns. Often, customers offer valuable product 
suggestions.
For example, Todd Mills created a Facebook page suggesting that Taco Bell sell 
tacos with a Doritos-flavored shell. Taco Bell took the idea seriously and began 
developing the concept based on Mills’s pitch. To date, Mills’s effort resulted in 
more than $1 billion in sales for Taco Bell. Not only did the company get an 
awesome new product (do I need to repeat that it was worth $1 billion?), it 
also created a loyal brand influencer.
Usually, a single online listening insight will not be yield immediate business 
success. But as part of a strategy, a pattern of insights gleaned from an online 
community can tell companies important things like how to reach potential 
customers and keep them.
One great way to understand listening and discovery is by thinking of a good 
friend. You didn’t get to know your friend based on just one thing he or she told 
you. The more you listened and shared, the stronger your friendship became. 
Online listening applies this concept to a larger group of people across online 
channels.
The goal of online listening is to help guide decision making. By listening to 
what people are saying about your brand and your field, your business can 
make better-informed decisions about the likelihood of success.
From a broader perspective, listening and discovery are necessary in order to 
remain competitive within your market space. If you aren’t listening to what 
people are saying about your business or brand, you risk moving the needle 
in the wrong direction, and pushing against what your audiences find most 
interesting and compelling about your business. Think about your old favorite 
brands that seem to have gone stale in recent years. Many times, their big-
gest problems revolve around the fact that they’re not listening to their audi-
ence. You know who they are: they’re the brands you stopped thinking about 
because they stopped being interesting.

MYTHS THAT MAKE US MIFFED
As with any young discipline, there are a number of myths about social listening. Let’s 
address some of the most common and equip you to educate others:
1.	
It’s just reading things online. Defining listening and discovery 
as “just” reading social media is like describing fishing as “just” 
throwing a piece of string into the ocean. This is a strategic process 
that enables professionals to gain powerful insights that guide the 
business trajectory of a brand. Reading social media posts is a key 
part of online listening, but good community managers also sift 
through the noise to find what’s really relevant to their audience 
and business. And, if you do it right, you might just catch yourself 
a massive fish.
2.	
It’s a one-time action. People are constantly using the Internet 
to communicate ideas and thoughts, so it stands to reason that 
online listening should not be a short-term, one-and-done project. 
Companies that want to stay relevant need to monitor online brand 
mentions and sentiment about their performance constantly. They 
can then actively use that information to communicate with their 
communities and inform decisions about the brand.
3.	
It’s not worth the effort. In this era of marketing budgets that 
are about as thin as the paper they’re drafted on, it can be tough 
to justify online listening when there are other priorities. However, 
because the audience insights gained from online listening and 
discovery can help save money in the long run, and can help 
guide decisions that translate into substantial ROI, online listening 
creates long-term business value.
4.	
There are no tools to help with online listening. 2004 just called, 
and it wants to know where you’ve been for the past decade. In 
this era of rapid innovation, there is an ever-increasing number of 
tools available to help tap into the conversations people are having 
about your brand and your market.
There are tools to help CMs sift through data and judge brand mentions by sentiment 
(positive, negative and neutral). They are great for giving marketers a snapshot of what 
people are saying about a brand and can also provide advanced techniques for in-depth 
analysis. Of course, before you go blowing your budget on a high-end tool that doesn’t 
meet the specific needs of your company, it’s important to spend some time researching 
which tools are best for your brand. We’ll be surveying the wide variety of options later 
in this chapter.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery

We Live in an Interconnected World
Thanks to the Internet, people who live thousands of miles apart can com-
municate with a few clicks of a button. Social media, mobile access, and the 
World Wide Web have broken down barriers between consumers and brands, 
as audiences can provide real-time feedback on their thoughts and feelings 
concerning products and ideas.
All of this real-time activity means that companies are subject more than ever 
to public opinion. Brands that know how to effectively leverage social media 
do this, at least in part, by engaging with their audiences.
How to Use Online Listening for  
Decision-making
Social media is a valuable tool for brands, and online listening is one way to 
tap into online conversations around the world. But how, exactly, can people’s 
random tweets about what they are eating, or a Facebook post about why 
someone loves vintage tennis shoes, lead to useful information that can guide 
the decision-making process of an entire business?
Well, if your business happens to be a restaurant chain, then perhaps tweets 
about what your audience members are eating for lunch can provide insights 
into new menu items. Or, if you happen to be in the fashion business, some-
one’s posts about vintage tennis shoes might lead to an influencer who can 
help bring new fans and followers to your business.
What Are We Listening For?
You are primarily listening for trends, customer needs, opportunities, positive 
or negative information about your brands, and the health of your relation-
ships with customers. Let’s look at each in turn.
Category and consumer trends. Category trends are patterns happening within 
a given market. For example, modern candles are primarily made from paraf-
fin, derived from fossil fuels. Mounting concerns about the environment have 
created new demand for more eco-friendly alternatives like beeswax, soy wax, 
and plant-based wax. A candle manufacturer could gauge the importance of 
changing production materials to key consumers by listening to their online 
conversations.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
165
Meanwhile, consumer trends are patterns of behavior. Using the candle exam-
ple again, a company would want to understand how often and why people are 
using candles. This research enables brands to tailor marketing, content, and 
even business tactics to keep up with its customer base. In short, this is the 
understanding that companies need to succeed in the long run.
Together, category and consumer trends shape the landscape of a customer’s 
experience. Brands that fail to recognize such trends are doomed to become 
stale, which can lead to the downfall of a company or even an entire market.
Customer needs. Social media has become an extension of traditional customer 
service. Retailers have to routinely respond to customer complaints and ser-
vice requests on channels like Facebook and Twitter, or risk mounting negative 
reviews.
Online tools can also be used in a more proactive way. People willingly give 
up information about themselves and their personal preferences, like product 
suggestions and indirect customer needs. For example, an uptick in complaints 
about mosquito bites might trigger a candle company to market its citronella 
products more aggressively. This type of proactive behavior helps both the 
consumer (fewer mosquito bites!) and the company (more sales).

  Listening studies help CMs tap into opportunities for improvement. A well-designed 
listening study consists of auditing online conversations that are occurring about your brand and 
your business category, which may happen on social media, blogs, message boards, and elsewhere 
on the Internet. The goal of a listening study is to find out relevant information that you can use to 
help develop a solid understanding of where your brand stands in the current cultural landscape. This 
data can be analyzed to form consumer insights and audience segmentation. Eventually, all of this 
customer understanding can be folded back into the bigger business strategy.
Opportunities for building buzz. The Internet allows people to post opinions 
and reviews instantly, which makes it an important marketing tool. Whether 
launching a new product, service, or initiative, research into key influencers 
(people who have a large online following and can influence the opinions of 
many others) is vital in the digital age. Target the right trendsetters and you 
can build positive buzz that creates and sustains an active community. Think, 
for example, of Oprah or Dr. Oz, two of the biggest influencers in America. 
Just a few words of endorsement from either of them can lead to thousands 
of dollars in added revenue for a company. Of course, not every influencer is 
a major television personality. A small fashion company might have more suc-
cess targeting the Brooklyn fashion blogger with a huge and loyal following 
who seems to have connections to everyone in town.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
166
Brand health. If after an online listening study, a researcher finds that brand 
mentions are overwhelmingly negative, then it can be a huge signal that the 
brand is in trouble. Perhaps a larger concern, low mentions in general can 
mean that people are not interested in what the brand has to offer. Wouldn’t 
this be good to know before a brand spends a lot of money on a campaign for 
a failing product?
Relationship status. No, I don’t mean your relationship status on Facebook! I’m 
bringing us full circle back to community management. A business doesn’t func-
tion without its customers. Therefore, brands are finding it more and more 
important to engage with them as a method of customer retention. You want 
to know how your customers feel about your business, and often, marketers 
don’t bother to listen until it’s too late. If your customers are complaining 
about bad service or Yelping that the food at your restaurant has really gone 
downhill, they’re telling you that your relationship with them is deteriorating. 
Take the steps you need to remedy these issues in order to save these rela-
tionships and keep them healthy.
Online listening and discovery supports community management because the 
brand can build strong customer relationships that make a long-lasting impact 
and foster a community around the brand. This type of work creates custom-
ers for life. By tapping into the subjects your target audience is interested in, 
you can develop dialogues with them that help improve your products and 
services, and can ultimately help grow your brand. The more positive experi-
ence your audience has with your brand, the more likely they are to share, 
which is the best way for brands to grow their communities.
Some Facts About Online Listening and Discovery
For those who still don’t believe that conducting online listening is one of the 
strongest and most cost-effective ways to tap into the heart of what matters 
to a brand’s community, here are some facts:1
53% of people use social media multiple times per month 
• 
to compliment and give credit to brands that do a great 
job.
46% of people use social media multiple times per 
• 
month to express concerns or complain about brands 
or products.
Millions of consumers converse in online communities, 
• 
blogs, discussion boards, and social networks each day.

As you can see, people are actively expressing their feelings about the prod-
ucts and services that matter to them all the time. Conducting social media 
listening exercises can help brands get feedback on nearly any topic of interest 
to the brand, informing important strategic business decisions (and avoiding a 
lot of headaches down the line!)
HOW ARE BIG BRANDS USING ONLINE LISTENING?
Ideation: Lays. Inspired by internet chatter about made-up potato chip flavors, Lays 
launched a contest in 2012: “Do Us a Flavor.” It was designed to engage its audience 
by inviting them to submit ideas for the next new flavor of Lays potato chips. The 
campaign allowed people to create and share their potato chip ideas on social media. 
After selecting the best three flavor ideas, Lays invited all customers to vote on the best 
creations.
The winning flavors put into production included “Sriracha,” “Cheesy Garlic Bread,” 
and “Chicken and Waffles.” The winner of the competition received $1 million, plus the 
opportunity to see his or her idea come to life. The campaign received more than 3.8 
million fan submissions between July 20th and October 6th, 2012. With the success of 
the promotion, Lays expanded it into a year-long social media campaign.
Launch: Xerox. For the launch of its new ColorQube multifunction printer in 2011, 
Xerox incorporated social listening. The team monitored key search terms related to 
the ColorQube and defined sentiment and filter values to process a significant amount 
of social media data quickly. This information was then assembled into reports that 
marketing and product teams could quickly review, highlighting what customers enjoyed 
or found difficult before and after launch, enabling a fast response.
In-Market: Cisco. Established in 2012, Cisco’s Social Media Listening Center enables 
employees, customers, partners, and visitors to view real-time Cisco conversations 
from the social web. By providing ease-of-access to these conversations, the Listening 
Center allows employees to quickly respond to complaints and customer conversation, 
regardless of whether the mention is a direct communication with Cisco or passive 
chatter about its products and services.
Using Online Listening for Business: An 
Overview
Online listening is important. By now, I’m probably preaching to the choir.  
So let’s get you ready to do it.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
168
Set Goals
We’ve done a lot of work establishing overall business objectives and mapping 
CM team goals to those objectives. There’s a reason for that: it’s a lot easier 
to get from point A to point B if you know where point B is.
Companies creating an online listening strategy should start by setting goals. 
These goals provide a framework to measure the progress and success of 
your strategy. It is important to decide whether the company goal is (for 
example) to build engagement, help improve the customer service process, 
or help increase sales, all of which can translate to high value but may require 
different approaches. Without setting goals, you’re taking a shot in the dark 
with your online listening—and when you’re in the dark, it can take a lot of 
shots to hit your target!
In general, effective online listening should:
• 
Align listening with business objectives. Carefully evaluate 
how online listening can contribute to accomplishing 
these objectives.
• 
Focus on customers, not business. Monitor social media and 
online mentions from a consumer perspective, not from 
the company’s, as this will aid in a deeper understanding 
of what matters most to the consumer. Try not to see 
this through the lens of “What’s best for the business?” 
but rather, “What’s best for the customer?”
• 
Obtain actionable insights. The purpose of the listening 
analysis is to gain actionable insights that can help inform 
strategic decisions.
Online listening can contribute to your brand effectiveness in many ways, but 
it is important to understand the analysis process. The end goal must be to 
glean insights that help your business learn and improve.
Determine Existing and Potential Communities
If you’re a CM, you need to know where to find your audience. You wouldn’t 
start a neighborhood committee by spreading the word two towns over, and 
you shouldn’t start developing your community management strategy without 
knowing where your audience hangs out in the digital space.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
169
This information will become evident as you perform a listening study. Start 
by asking, “What’s the goal?” Your choices include:
1.	 Gain product recognition.
2.	 Increase sales.
3.	 Build evangelists.
4.	 Improve business relations.
On some level, we’d like to do all of these things, but how you think about the 
end goal will affect the way you approach your listening study. Gaining product 
recognition might require spending more time investigating review sites, while 
building evangelists might require more emphasis on Instagram or Twitter. 
Tip
■
■
  Some groups may be more active than others. For instance, a very passive environment of 
Facebook followers who rarely engage with a brand might not be as useful for building community 
as an extremely engaged Twitter following. Pay attention to the pattern of behavior: what people are 
doing, as well as what people are saying.
CHANNEL SURFING: BEST PRACTICES BY SOCIAL 
MEDIA CHANNEL
In order to effectively listen on social media, it’s important to identify the key social 
media channels. While it seems like there are new channels and outlets popping up 
every day, there are a few core targets that every community manager should know 
about. Here’s a listing, along with best practices for each.
Facebook: Facebook Pages allow you to comment on other Facebook Pages that you 
“like.” Posting image-heavy, interesting content is an easy way to build brand equity 
with partners within your space. Facebook offers numerous search options including 
subjects of interest, geography and trending topics, making it an ideal place to gain 
insights into your audience, and what people are saying with respect to your brand and 
area of business.
Twitter: An easy way to engage with followers is to retweet their messages with the 
letters “RT,” adding your own messages in front of the retweet. Another tip is to use 
Twitter to broadcast special announcements to fans. Finally, Twitter followers love it 
when you reply directly on specific issues—find out what these are by searching popular 
hashtags, especially as they relate to your brand, or area of business. There’s no one 
right way to engage, as long as you’re within your brand voice and aren’t intrusive.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
170
YouTube: YouTube is a great place to post content, as long as you have a video strategy 
and have the resources to commit to it. Nothing looks worse than a YouTube brand page 
that hasn’t uploaded a new video in over a year. Make sure your strategy includes an 
effort to establish community. Invite people to comment and submit response videos to 
cultivate the most authentic engagement. Follow popular channels within your category 
landscape to discover influencers and learn more about their interests.
Instagram: People are visual beings. Use timely and relevant hashtags to engage 
and inspire. You can also use Instagram to conduct searches and discover influencers 
in your realm, and learn about trending topics (for instance, looking at images from 
festivals or other places where lots of people are gathering in the real world). Follow 
other accounts that add value for your fans.
Blog: WordPress is a good blog platform, but companies are now seeing the value in 
Tumblr, which tends to be younger-leaning and has built-in communities. The blog can 
be brand-focused, revolving around updates and product photos, or it can be a curated 
stream of interesting things that add to the brand. If you have a medium-to-large staff, 
get everyone on the team to contribute to produce more continuous content. Bring in a 
guest blogger with a large following to improve audience reach. You can find out what 
bloggers are talking about using Google Trends, looking at Google News, and using 
specialty online listening tools, which I’ll discuss later in the chapter.
Pinboards: Community managers are constantly coming up with innovative ways to 
share content through pinboard sites like Pinterest, Polyvore, and Gentlemint. Share 
articles and event pictures, and use it to promote a lifestyle. Be sure to credit the original 
source in the content description and to link back to the artists’ page. For even more 
engagement, ask fans to pin pictures of themselves using or wearing your brand’s 
products, and post those to a special board. Follow your brand’s biggest influencers to 
see what they’re pinning and find new ways to reach them.
Public Forums: Forums like Reddit, Quora, niche message boards, and other forums 
can provide wonderful perspective into the minds of your audience. If you find that your 
audience is actively engaged on one such outlet, be sure to become an active member 
of that community as well. Reddit offers thought leaders and influencers the opportunity 
to conduct AMAs (Ask Me Anything), which are a great way to interact with fans all over 
the world. Quora allows brands to source potential ambassadors and to offer advice, 
and can be a fertile ground to seed information about your product.
How Will Your Brand Use Listening and 
Discovery?
Listening and discovery strategies are as unique as snowflakes: no two will 
ever look the same. Design a listening and discovery process that will work 
for your business focusing on where, and how, to prioritize resources.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
171
When mapping out social listening, ask:
Where is your audience now?
• 
Where and when will you reach out to them?
• 
Which channels are important for you, and your 
• 
audience?
What is the use case for each channel?
• 
Discovering Influencers in Your Community
Influencers are of tremendous value in the community space. This goes back 
to the word-of-mouth advocacy we discussed earlier. But where do we find 
these mega-fans who can help influence their own followers to become  
supporters of your brand?
Find influencers by tracking who engages most with your brand, and looking 
for clues such as a verified Twitter status or a large Facebook following. Follow 
them, and then follow the people they follow to get more insight into their 
own network. Seek to engage with them, and ensure that the lines of com-
munication with these core advocates remain open.
When seeking influencers, ask:
Who are the key influencers in your category?
• 
Who are the influential bloggers or tweeters addressing 
• 
your brand?
Who do you need to listen to, and engage with, in your 
• 
community?
By digging deep into social media listening, you can derive important insights 
for managing meaningful relationships. Because of the real-time (and some-
times brutal) feedback you can derive from your community, keeping tabs 
on what your audience is saying about your business can help inform future 
strategic decisions.
In understanding what your community is saying about your brand, the empha-
sis is on understanding behavior. Think about why certain ideas matter to your 
audience, such as topical trends and the types of content they like to share.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
172
When trying to discover what your community is saying about your brand, ask:
What are the key conversation topics within your 
• 
community?
What content mediums does your community like to 
• 
share? For example, are they sharing images, short-form 
content, long-form content, infographics?
What types of content does your community like to 
• 
respond to?
What type of content does your audience react to the 
• 
most?
Tip
■
■
  When listening to what your community is saying about your brand, pay attention to the 
most popular keywords they’re using. Some of the social media tools mentioned in this chapter can 
offer insight into the frequent words and phrases people use when discussing your brand. But even 
if you don’t have the luxury of using such tools, keeping track of the keywords can help you come up 
with even more ideas to connect with your audience.
Once you step in and start listening, it’s time to think about how you use your 
content. I’ve broken it down to four core areas:
Platforms: Think about each social media channel as a different platform or 
stage. Certain pieces of content or actions play best on specific platforms. 
For example, trying to fit an entire press release into a 140-character tweet 
may not be ideal, and photos of your customers interacting with your product 
might not be so great for Reddit. Also, take into consideration what already 
works on the channels you’re currently using.
Channels: Think of this in terms of partnerships. Rather than focusing on your 
own Facebook page or Twitter profile, think about other brands’ platforms 
where your brand can have presence and distribution.
Assets: Today, most digital assets can have more than one use. A compelling 
image for your blog can easily also provide content for Facebook or Pinterest. 
Think creatively, and find ways to repurpose your content across platforms.
Media: Think about all the different ways you can relay information through 
social media: text (both long and short form), photo, graphic design, video, 
animation, podcasting, and music streaming are just a few, and these media are 
evolving all the time. Use of the various media to your advantage, and take into 
account all of the senses when figuring out what to share.

When defining the landscape for online listening, ask:
Where does each type of content belong?
• 
What content channels or platforms are being used?
• 
Which part of your audience is using these channels?
• 
Brand Mentions and Sentiment
Most user engagement can be grouped in one of three ways:
Fan Appreciation: These are the people who love your brand! Make sure to 
engage with them, and to figure out which influencers can help drive the rela-
tionships that support your brand.
Product Reviews and Tips: It’s great to have so many people willing to share their 
opinions with you without even having to ask. Even negative opinions can pro-
vide valuable ideas to improve the brand or business. Product tips are terrific 
indicators of interest in the brand; they mean someone cared enough to share 
a tip that might make someone else’s life a bit easier.
Customer Complaints: It would be great if brands’ Facebook walls weren’t marred 
by the occasional (or sometimes, frequent) customer service complaint. People 
have taken to complaining via social media because they’ve learned that they 
can sometimes get much faster responses that way. Some companies have 
devised creative ways to deal with this issue. For example, shoe brand Steve 
Madden has a special “shopper advocate” brand persona to handle customer 
complaints. While the complaints still appear on the company’s Facebook wall, 
the brand shows it cares by openly addressing the complaints.
Now that you know the basics of online listening, it’s time to put that plan 
into action!
Online Listening: The Lay of the Land
It’s important to be strategic about your online listening efforts. Before you 
begin online listening, you should revisit those ABCs we discussed in the last 
chapter. Thinking about these items will help you understand the landscape 
you are exploring.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
174
Key questions to ask when developing your online listening strategy:
Audience:
Who is your audience?
• 
What keywords or topics are popular with your 
• 
audience?
What content types are they using to discuss your 
• 
category?
Brand:
How visible is your brand online?
• 
How socially engaged is your brand?
• 
What are people saying about your brand?
• 
Category:
What are the common themes being addressed within 
• 
your category?
Once you have the answers to these questions, think carefully about the value 
exchange for your audience. There are millions of brands in the social space. 
Why should someone choose to engage with your brand instead of another? If 
you don’t have a good answer for this, your audience doesn’t have one either.
Now, we’ve reached the how-to portion of this chapter. Here’s how it’s done, 
in a snapshot.
Roadmap of Online Listening
Here’s the roadmap for creating a listening and discovery study:
1.	 Set a clear purpose for your online listening.
2.	 Identify precise keywords to retrieve relevant mentions.
3.	 Set up or calibrate your listening tools (if needed).
4.	 Collect information on your ABCs (by discovering your 
who, where and when).
5.	 Process and categorize gathered information.
6.	 Analyze listening results by identifying topics, platforms, 
and influencers to monitor; create a listening study or 
findings report.
7.	 Plan your next steps. Decide how you are going to act on 
the information treasure you mined.

I can virtually hear you asking me, “But Lauren, what does this all mean?” Let’s 
outline the steps in more detail.
1. Set a Clear Purpose for Your Online Listening
Having a purpose for your online listening strategy will help you find the infor-
mation critical to you. Going in blindly means you’re trying to find a needle’s 
worth of information in a metaphorical haystack. Your purpose will guide your 
search and will allow you to clarify your listening practice, so you can disre-
gard information that may not be relevant.
Ask yourself:
To which business objectives could online listening 
• 
contribute?
What is the intent/purpose of your online listening?
• 
The answers to these questions will determine how you should conduct your 
online listening analysis.
Make sure your online listening yields enough information to create action-
able results by setting project goals. Take into consideration all the factors 
we’ve discussed previously in this chapter, and determine which goals are 
most applicable to your own business growth strategy. You might want to:
Support online community management.
• 
Monitor brand health.
• 
Gain consumer insights.
• 
Draft clear and concise questions to help clarify your purpose and drive  
strategy. For example:
What are people saying about your brand?
What are people saying about your competitors?
Are people comparing you to your competitors? How?
Taken together, the answers to these questions can provide a clear view of 
the competitive landscape. The more precise you are in outlining your goals, 
the better the results of your online listening study. Narrowing the scope is 
more likely to produce the information you need to make informed business 
decisions.

Exercise 1: Lay the Groundwork for Listening
Once you’ve set clear goals for your listening study, it’s time to lay the ground-
work. This exercise is not a full listening study; it sets you up to run a success-
ful one. However, if you’re under time pressure, you can rely on this exercise 
to provide a quick start.
Develop a digital audit for your brand or company:
List your brand’s digital channels.
• 
Outline all of the brand’s different properties, in terms of 
• 
paid, owned (brand created and controlled), and earned 
media (i.e., free media, such as the results of PR efforts).
Capture basic starting point data (number of followers or 
• 
“likes,” content formats, and click rates).
With this information in front of you, ask:
Are there social media channels that you’re not using 
• 
effectively, like a YouTube page that hasn’t been updated 
in over a year?
Are there inefficiencies in the content creation work-
• 
flow, like writing a blog post but not scheduling Facebook 
posts or tweets to promote it?
Do you use analytics tools that tell you how much traffic 
• 
each social media channel drives back to your company’s 
website?
This audit is purely informative, but should help you gain a bird’s eye view of 
your entire social media strategy.
Pre-listen for mentions. A pre-listen is a precursor to the actual listening process. 
Use tools like Google Trends, Google Alerts, hashtag searches and Facebook 
internal search, to get an idea of how people are talking about your brand. 
Capture key words and sentiments some of these people use to start framing 
what to look for and expect on your listening journey. For example, if you’ve 
just launched a new fashion line and generated a significant amount of press, 
use Google Alerts to learn which media outlets are talking about your brand 
and set up those updates to be delivered directly to your inbox. Then, jot down 
words they might be using (in this case, you might find “modern,” “trendy,” or 
“sophisticated”). Use these to build your hashtag and Facebook searches to 
learn even more about how people are thinking about your fashion line. If it’s 
really taking off, use Google Trends to capture who’s talking about your busi-
ness and in what countries you’re getting the most mentions.

Scan the online landscape for your audience. If social media listening is anything 
like mining for gold, then this step ensures you’re not missing the jackpot. It’s 
important to evaluate all sorts of places where your audience might be active. 
Of course, we think of Facebook or Twitter when trying to find our audi-
ences, but your biggest advocates might have formed their own community 
on Reddit, Flickr, or even be hidden in message boards if your brand repre-
sents something that has niche appeal. You can conduct this scan using Google 
and Bing, paired with tools like Social Mention, that help you dig deeper into 
the internet to find mentions that aren’t necessarily coming up in the search 
engines. If you get stuck, review the profile and persona work you did in 
Chapter 6 for guidance.
Investigate market research. Companies like Forrester and McKinsey provide 
research reports that help brands understand their businesses and the com-
petitive landscape. Searching for and reviewing these articles can provide 
a view into trends, case studies, or specific suggestions pertaining to your 
area of expertise. In some cases, they might target your product or service 
directly. Many of these items are proprietary or cost money to download, 
but some are not. For example, a company called Videology recently commis-
sioned Forrester to publish a free report on cross-platform video advertising. 
This might be relevant for a new media company interested in ramping up 
its video efforts.
Or, perhaps your business has conducted market research in the past, which 
you can draw on to help establish the foundation of the listening study. Take 
time to highlight important learnings from these research reports and include 
them in your pre-listening analysis.
Review the Fact Finding exercise from Chapter 6 for more in-depth instruc-
tions. You’re probably becoming a pro at this!
Identify opportunities. You might be surprised by how people are interacting 
with your brand. Surprises are discoveries. Use them to generate creative 
ideas and inspiration for future research and development.
One example of an audience hidden within an unusual community involved a 
man named Noboru Bitoy, who raised more than $1,000 from 258 backers 
when he designed a Kickstarter campaign to raise $8 to help him purchase a 
Chipotle burrito. While seemingly silly, this project shows how Bitoy was able 
to successfully build a community around his idea. If that were your brand, 
think about all the neat ways you could tap into that community to help build 
engagement.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
178
Organize and analyze your findings. Once you have a baseline of expectations 
for your research, organize all this information into one document and use it 
to determine the next steps.
Since there is so much information out there, use your 
• 
listening goals to decide what makes sense to audit. For 
example, do you need to research competitors or to 
focus on just a single aspect of your business, like a par-
ticular product line?
Decide how to address consumer sentiment. One easy 
• 
way to is simply lump sentiment into positive, negative, 
and neutral. You can get as detailed with this as you need 
to be in order to help serve your business’s need.
Finally, use all your pre-listening research to set specific 
• 
goals and objectives.
2. Identify Precise Keywords to Retrieve Relevant Mentions
To conduct a successful online listening study, you’re going to need to know 
which keywords people associate with your brand. Much as we wish we could, 
you can’t just plug in a brand name and start listening. Doing that will definitely 
cause you to pick up “noise” that is irrelevant to your listening study, or to 
miss out on important conversations happening in your space. If you don’t 
thoroughly consider this aspect, you may end up having holes in your research 
and significantly reduce your customer and business insights.
The pre-listening exercise you did above should have identified words and 
phrases to track. This next exercise will solidify those keywords for your 
strategy.
Exercise 2. Define Keywords for Your Listening Study
One of the main ways to find keywords for your listening study is to start 
with a Google Keyword analysis. Start by signing up for a Google AdWords 
account to get access to their keyword planner: https://adwords.google.
com/KeywordPlanner. Then enter different keywords to help identify words 
that people might be using when they talk about your brand. For example, 
when I key in “yoga pants,” I also get related keywords such as “yoga leggings,” 
“workout clothes,” and “yoga tops,” which helps give me insight into what 
other types of things people are thinking about when they search for “yoga 
pants.”

Log on to the Google AdWords Keyword Planner 
• 
(adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner).
This tool is designed to help businesses find the 
• 
right words to use for their Google AdWords 
marketing. It is an excellent resource to help figure 
out what terms and phrases you should be targeting 
for your listening study.
Type in words and phrases that are relevant to your 
• 
business.
Use the words and phrases that you began tracking 
• 
from the pre-listening exercise.
Take note of the results. In selecting keywords, carefully 
• 
look at search volume and competition. Are there specific 
phrases associated with your brand that generate much 
more search traffic? That means there are a lot more 
people using those terms in their online conversations. 
Target these words and phrases for your listening study.
Take note of meaningful keywords that have smaller 
• 
search volumes. These are often ultra-specific searches, 
and may mean someone was looking for a very specific 
item as it relates to your business, such as a reference to 
a specific image you posted on Tumblr.
These keywords can offer a different type of insight 
• 
than broader terms and more general mentions.
Here are some additional tips:
Exclude irrelevant terms: focus on the terms that provide 
• 
the most value to your search. These are the terms that 
appear repeatedly in your auditing, so disregard qualifiers 
that could apply to any business, such as “big” or “pretty.” 
Broad keywords will cause you to miss out on critical 
mentions and to pick up too many mentions that may 
not actually be relevant to your brand. Or, if you take an 
example like Apple, you would know to exclude words 
like “pie” and “eat.” This may be a very involved process, 
depending on the nature of your business and how it’s 
used in the social lexicon.
Include more relevant terms: The more specific the 
• 
words and phrases, the higher likelihood you have of find-
ing information pertinent to help you achieve the goal of 
gathering information to make strategic decisions about 

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
180
your brand. Focus on the keywords that have the most 
significance to your business. Taking the Apple example, 
words you know you’d want to have in your search would 
include “iPad,” “MacBook,” and “iPhone.”
Tip
■
■
  Continue to iterate. Keyword analysis is an iterative process, meaning that you should 
continue to use your findings to refine the initial set of keywords until you settle upon the right group. 
How will you know when it’s right? You’ll be able to discover information that is relevant to your 
business without spending a lot of time manually sorting out data that is meaningless to your brand.
Set up a regular schedule to review your keywords, and especially after an 
event such as a product launch, major campaign, or big press hit. Ongoing 
listening efforts will help fine-tune future listening activities.
TOOLS FOR ONLINE LISTENING
Online listening can feel like the Wild West when searching through the incredibly large 
number of conversations. Thankfully, there are many tools available to help you reach 
your online listening goals.
When searching for an online listening tool, look at your goals and determine whether 
the tools you’re considering will help you measure progress towards those goals. You 
want to compare the features that you really need to the cost that you have budgeted.
An early-stage startup may not need all the features that an enterprise-level listening 
tool offers. In those cases, opt for something at a lower cost that was designed for small 
businesses. In some cases, free social media listening tools may be more than enough 
for your business needs.
Paid tools offer a lot of features that free tools can’t provide, and are worth the cost as 
long as they actually create value for your business. Figure out exactly what you need 
(based on your business objectives and listening study goals), your budget, and then 
decide whether the paid tool is worth the investment.
Free Tools
It bears repeating that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for this type of work. That rule 
holds true for online listening tools. Here is a short list of tools to help you monitor and 
measure data.
SocialMention: SocialMention lets anyone track mentions across social media, and 
provides sentiment as it relates to that mention. It also tracks sites beyond the top social 
media outlets, meaning it can help provide a view into areas where your audience is 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
181
discussing your brand, that might not be so obvious (including StumbleUpon, Digg, 
Flickr and others). The tool also gives you the top hashtags associated with the topic, 
the top users, additional keywords, and more.
Topsy: If you’re looking for a reliable tool to track mentions—one that also tracks 
mentions that don’t expressly use the brand name but link to a URL that has such 
a mention—it’s definitely worth experimenting with Topsy. You might be surprised to 
find out who is linking to your brand’s pages and why. The tool also allows the user to 
analyze tweets with a given keyword that deviates from the norm, interspersing tweets 
with commentary, and feedback. It also makes it easier to identify influencers, and to 
find photos, links, videos, and tweets derived from the original post.
Alltop: This site aggregates the top blogs on a specific topic. It’s a very useful tool for 
deciphering what kinds of conversations about given topics are happening in the digital 
space. As a tool, use it to target influential bloggers and to find ways to engage with 
them and their communities.
Klout: Klout is best known for its ranking algorithms, which help identify influencers 
according to a numerical score called a “Klout Score.” In recent years, Klout has 
expanded its offerings by creating tools to measure social analytics and help schedule 
social media posts.
Paid Tools
Mention: Mention is a tool that monitors the web, including the major social media 
channels, to keep you informed every time somebody mentions your name, brand, or 
any target keywords, and its user-friendly interface makes it very easy to use. Mention 
allows you to set up alerts, and track and respond to mentions.
Crowdbooster: Crowdbooster helps brands analyze follower growth, chart potential 
tweet views, highlights influential Twitter users, and offers suggestions to help you 
improve your online presence. It also tracks performance of tweets to offer optimized 
times for tweeting.
Radian6: Though costly, this is one of the better tools on the market. Designed 
specifically for social media listening, the platform captures hundreds of millions of 
posts each day from Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video, 
and image-sharing sites. With a real-time, interactive dashboard, Radian6 allows the 
user to discover meaningful, and, more importantly, actionable intelligence. It’s great for 
people seeking a simple and intuitive tool to help with their online listening needs. With 
a user-friendly, streamlined query process, customizable dashboards and advanced 
filtering across multiple widgets, this tool seeks to simplify and automate many of the 
processes that would otherwise be manual. However, it has limited validation features,  
it is difficult to view conversation sources, and there is no custom segmentation available 
in charts. It is best used in tandem with other listening tools.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
182
Sysomos: This tool collects data in real time, and also organizes this data by audience 
sentiment, geography and demographics. It also provides key influencer tracking, real-
time data with historical archives and data analysis. Recently, Sysomos partnered with 
Spredfast to create “Heartbeat,” a realtime monitoring, measuring and engagement tool.
SDL SM2: Formerly known as Alterian, SDL SM2 is a leading international integrated 
marketing platform provider. SDL was originally known for its language services and 
technologies, as well as its web content management solution. The service now focuses 
on broad and deep social media data collection across all languages, geographies, and 
platforms (2011 to current) to create insight concerning markets, brands, products and 
competitive positions. 
Brandwatch: As a social media listening tool, Brandwatch does exactly what it says it 
does: it helps you monitor your brand’s mentions on the web. Compared to other tools, 
it is relatively affordable and offers a good amount of information to help advance your 
online listening efforts. Its top reporting features and automated sentiment analysis make 
it an increasingly powerful tool. Special tools for marketing agencies, PR, and reputation 
management make it an indispensable tool for monitoring digital performance.
3. Calibrate Your Listening Tools
Listening tools are essential in the online listening process. If your business 
doesn’t already have social media listening tools set up, check out my advice 
in the “Tools for Online Listening” sidebar. However, the digital landscape is 
changing rapidly. I may even yell “Stop the presses!” a couple of times to add 
new tools before this book is complete.
I know I’m repeating this, but it’s critical to understand that every listening 
strategy is unique. So I want to teach you how to build a foundation based 
on your specific business needs instead of handing you a template with no 
personality. It’s more work, but it pays off in the long run because your com-
munity will recognize the authentic, personal touch in your approach.
Use the results of your pre-listening exercise to identify the key features that 
you need in your social media listening tools. For example, if you learned that 
your community is most active on Pinterest, instead of Facebook or Twitter, 
you would want a tool that is designed to work well with Pinterest.
This is also the right time to take a good, hard look at the goals of your  
listening study. Are you hoping to learn more about your audience so that you 
can increase engagement? In that case, the tool you use should measure all 
the basic KPIs (key performance indicators) for engagement such as replies, 
shares, likes or follows, and so on. If you want to think ahead to the next step, 
you might also want CRM (customer relations management) capabilities built 
in, so that you’re already set up to interact with community members when 
you proceed to the next stage.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
183
On the other hand, if your goal is to learn more about your audience to 
increase direct sales (sales made directly on your company’s website), then 
you might benefit more from a tool that can measure click-through and con-
version rates. Whatever the scenario, it is important to match the right tool 
to your needs.
Determine the Best Approach
Once you find a tool that works for your business needs, it’s time to deter-
mine the best approach for your listening strategy. The features and function-
ality offered for social media listening will vary based on the tool you opt to 
use, so make sure to study setup and tutorial options to help you figure out 
the best use cases for your business.
Now it’s time to check that your search tools and functions are up-to-date 
with the most recent, pertinent, information about your brand. Grab those 
keywords you worked hard to capture in Exercise 2, and plug them in where 
relevant. Likewise, capture any parameters that you gathered from Exercise 1. 
For example, if your community is most relevant for males, ages 35–45, living 
in metropolitan areas, then narrow your listening study to that demographic.
Calibration is a key step that many people rush through. Stand out from the 
crowd by taking a thoughtful approach here. My rule is: garbage in, garbage out. 
If you’re giving your analytics tools bad information, then your results will be 
completely unhelpful to your online listening efforts. Remember to iterate and 
keep refining your searches.
4. Collect information on your ABCs
There are millions of conversations generated every single day, and it would 
be a waste of time and resources to cover all possible audiences, channels, and 
periods when you conduct online listening. You need to determine who, where, 
and when to find the contents and conversations that meet your goals.
One of the difficulties with online listening is that there is so much informa-
tion out there it can sometimes be overwhelming. One of the easiest ways 
to get real results from online listening is to limit your search to certain plat-
forms. If you’ve completed your pre-listening effectively, it should be obvious 
which channels you should focus on. (Remember, you can always go back and 
conduct more listening on different channels at a later date.)
One example might mean narrowing your listening to Facebook and Twitter 
instead of blogs and boards, particularly if your goals are specific to focusing 
on relevant chatter. Blog comments may be more neutral and not as effective 
in determining sentiment. On the other hand, blogs and boards may contain 
deeper insights and richer content. By now, you know what I’m going to say: 
determine the best way forward based on your unique business needs.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
184
You can also limit your listening by looking into sites and communities specific 
to your goals. For instance, if your goal is to discover how parents are reacting 
to a new children’s product, then focus on communities that are specific to 
parents so it’s easier to disregard children or other outsiders’ perspectives.
If applicable, try restricting your search to geographical regions. For example, 
if you’re trying to address sentiment in your UK market, then, for more finely 
tuned results, exclude results from other parts of the world.
Note
■
■
  Take note of the difference between passive and active groups. There are many people on 
social networks who simply enjoy reading the thoughts of others, and rarely post their own content. 
This is especially common on Twitter, where some folks just like to scroll down their Twitter feed as 
they would a newspaper. Just because they are passive groups doesn’t mean they aren’t worth 
investigating, so take a look at their behavior habits for insights, too.
5. Process and Batch Gathered Info
Congratulations! You’ve completed the information-gathering process. But, 
just because you’ve captured all the information, it doesn’t mean you’re done. 
That was just the listening portion of listening and discovery.
At this step, it’s important to process your findings by grouping them in a way 
that helps you to discover trends. Volume is a strong indicator of how you 
should group your data. For example, if you gathered the most results on a few 
keywords, it may be easiest to group your findings into those topics. However, 
if your findings are spread evenly over keywords or topics, you could group 
by process instead. For example, organizing your findings from all the social 
media channels together and then organizing your findings from all the blogs 
together. Look for the pattern within your data and organize accordingly.
6. Analyze Listening Results
Now it’s time to analyze the data you’ve gathered. This is where you get to put 
all that information you’ve gathered to good use. Don’t be intimidated. You’re 
just using what you’ve learned about your audience and identifying topics, 
platforms, and influencers to monitor.
It’s important to take the time to carefully analyze your findings. A deep analy-
sis means gaining knowledge that serves to answer the questions that began 
your listening study.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
185
Sometimes, this can mean sifting through a lot of data. Good thing you took 
steps to limit your searching to make sure your findings are relevant, right? 
Even so, it can feel like a mountain of data to dig through. This next exercise 
will help you go through the results to identify useful information.
Exercise 3. Create a Findings Report
Now that all the hard work is done, it’s time to document it. Trends, catego-
ries, and sentiments that stand out will lead to insights about your audience 
and industry. Here’s how to organize your data and present it.
1.	 Pre-listen for mentions. Start by familiarizing yourself 
with the listening results.
2.	 Think about the context of the results in relation to the 
current competitive landscape.
3.	 Read sample mentions to get an idea of what your audi-
ence likes and doesn’t like, and tie that sampling into the 
big picture.
4.	 Segment the results based on the objectives you set up 
when you began your study.
a.	
Identify key phrases and findings, and seek to 
understand how they can provide answers to the 
goals you sought to accomplish by conducting the 
research.
b.	 You can categorize by topic, author type, and men-
tion type (positive, neutral or negative) to create 
a clean data set.
5.	 Analyze your information.
a.	
Start by identifying trends and popular topics, 
and look at how mentions of those phrases have 
risen or fallen over time. Where possible, try to 
determine what other marketing, advertising, or 
public relations elements may have caused those 
mentions.
b.	 Look for trends that are specific to consumer seg-
ments. Did younger people love a new product? 
Did their parents hate it? The answers could pro-
vide valuable feedback about the right audience to 
target for your company.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
186
6.	 Organize into results and next steps.
a.	
Results: present key learnings and business recom-
mendations based on those. Include a brief sum-
mary of how you arrived at each idea and how it 
affects your company.
b.	 Next steps: Exercise 4, to come, will help you plan 
your next steps. Summarize your plan and use to 
close your findings report.

listening study data. Word clouds or infographics are two great ways to bring your findings to life. 
Search for free data visualization tools to view your information in a new way.
7. Plan Next Steps
At the beginning of this chapter, I mentioned that listening and discovery is 
an iterative process. That means you should be constantly learning new things 
about your audience and the process and using what you’ve learned to refine 
how you work.
This next exercise will guide you through the fundamental steps of how to 
do this. As you gain more experience, you will find additional methods that 
suit your work style and business needs. Go with it! Community management 
is a lifelong craft. If you feel like you are constantly learning, you are doing 
something right.
Exercise 4. Design the Next Stage of Your Listening Study
The goal is to continue refining your process. Ideally, you will revisit this exer-
cise at the conclusion of every listening and discovery initiative.
1.	 Review the questions that you set when you established 
goals for your listening study.
2.	 If there are unanswered questions, ask yourself if there are 
areas for further study. For example, if you only focused 
on social media channels, this may be the time to research 
activity on blogs, chat boards, and community forums.
3.	 Based on your results, consider whether you were asking 
the right questions in the first place. If you see something 
compelling, but not necessarily in line with your goals, 
don’t ignore it!

As you’re doing this, remember that this is not a perfect science. These are 
tried-and-tested methods that have worked in the past, but may not be a 100% 
match for the processes of your own brand. While I can give you the basics, 
developing a comprehensive plan to help you take action is up to you and is 
heavily contingent on your business needs. That is why I like to teach a way of 
thinking, and a fluid method, rather than a rote template. This equips you to 
design the plan that works best for the needs of your team and company.
Now that you have insights about your brand, it’s time to design a tactical plan 
and act on it. Part 3 will teach you how to design, build, and execute on an 
online content and community management plan. By the end of this book, you 
will understand how to make significant differences that have a positive effect 
on your business’s short and long-term goals.
CASE STUDY: A COSMETICS BRAND
I worked with a cosmetics brand when brands were still just starting to understand the 
significance of social media to drive business results. When I first started working with 
them, their business was a multi-national upscale cosmetics brand, but the brand’s 
online presence was just a blip on the radar. I wanted to create a presence that matched 
the brand’s reputation as a high-end company and a leader in its industry.
We knew that this cosmetics brand had significant brand equity, so the challenge for us 
was to match the digital presence to the brand’s international prestige. My team began 
the project with a digital asset audit to develop a baseline understanding of the brand’s 
presence. We took inventory of all the places the brand existed online, and tracked data 
points like the number of followers and their levels of interaction. We also tracked who 
they followed and how they engaged with others.
Once the audit was complete, my team concluded that the lack of strategic utilization of 
their digital assets was causing them to lose relevance with their audience. The cosmetics 
brand was also missing opportunities to engage with potential new customers, fans and 
influencers in their space. These are bad signs for a brand’s longevity.
Next, we conducted a listening study, just like the one you learned in this chapter. 
We narrowed the focus to three specific groups: beauty industry listening, audience 
listening, and brand sentiment listening. Here is a summary of our findings:
Beauty industry listening: The Cosmetics Brand is a leader in the beauty industry, 
but because their digital presence had the visibility of a concealer stick (pun intended!), 
they were in danger of losing relevance. Therefore, it was important to us to know about 
trends in the beauty space, and to determine who were the influencers in that space. 
Having a finger on the pulse in terms of trends in the space, and especially how that 
related to trends in digital media, would be vital to the success of our strategy.

Chapter 7 | Listening and Discovery 
188
Audience listening: In addition to taking the time to understand the landscape, it was 
necessary to connect with the audience as well. So, we strived to identify community 
hubs, key topics, and influencers engaged in conversations about this brand. This gave 
us insight into how the company could grow the brand within the online space through 
engagement.
Brand sentiment listening: It was also important to us to ensure we had a clear 
understanding of the cosmetics brand’s position among competitors in the digital 
space. Therefore, we carefully targeted the brand’s competitors and executed listening 
exercises to help us understand their relative position in online conversations about 
beauty. We benchmarked their performance against competitors, which allowed us to 
gain actionable insights.
Insights and How We Used Them to Inform Strategy
Insight 1: In conducting sentiment analysis, we discovered that the majority of brand 
mentions for the cosmetic brand were neutral. Not bad, but also not overwhelmingly 
positive. This sentiment dominated the online conversation and represented an 
opportunity. While the chatter was neutral, these customers were willing to talk about the 
brand. That meant that the brand could turn them into loyal fans and vocal supporters 
with more engagement and community management. This insight informed content and 
community strategy.
Insight 2: Compared to competitors, the cosmetics brand had a relatively strong 
presence on blogs, but was lagging on social media. We designed a social media 
strategy that would increase the company’s fan base and amplify its brand voice.
Insight 3: The cosmetics brand was a top pick for many popular beauty bloggers with 
large followings. We created an outreach strategy that would allow us to leverage these 
influencers and turn them into advocates across social media platforms. And it worked! 
Today, some of these leading ladies are still superfans of the brand.
Summary
Building community without insight would be like constructing a building 
without a blueprint. You might be able to get the building to stand but it would 
likely quickly crumble. Now that have the inputs we need across your audi-
ence, brand, and category, let’s use these insights and learnings to bring your 
CM strategy to life.

“  What is the best thing in the world? Connecting human beings.”
—Scott Heiferman, CEO of Meetup
Congratulations! You’ve just done an online listening audit. By now you know 
how to identify your audience, you understand your brand, and you’ve gotten 
tons of useful data you can use to help grow your community. If you’ve done 
it right, you should now have more than enough information to build a solid 
community strategy. But how do you actually do that?

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
190
In this chapter, I will give you the actionable knowledge to build a community 
management strategy. This expert logistical knowledge will help you address 
the gaps you’ve identified and should ultimately lead to tangible results for 
successful community building.
By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to take the steps to build a com-
munity strategy that gives you real results.
You will learn to:
1.	 Break up broad community management goals into dis-
crete actions.
2.	 Manage up and out, set and communicate expectations, 
and follow up for support from other teams.
3.	 Prioritize the things you want to test, develop the set up 
process and approach to testing, and define and bench-
mark metrics.
I’ve already given you the community management framework, taught you the 
process of defining goals, and shown you how to flesh out the skeleton of your 
audience through the who, where, and what. The goal now is to actually design 
and develop a plan that makes sense within the context of everything you’ve 
been studying so far.
Strategy: Based on Data
In Chapter 5, I had you collect goals and expectations from a number of 
sources, and then use that information to form hypotheses about who your 
audience is and how you can best reach them.
Much of the information you’ve absorbed so far is the result of research, 
experimentation, assessment, interviews, and other real data. But the strategic 
portion is different in that it requires you to make informed decisions based 
on this information. This is, of course, the definition of strategy.  The exercises 
here will require you to prioritize certain aspects of community management 
and to make some concrete commitments about how to move your strategy 
forward.
Numbers are important to any strategy because they offer benchmarks against 
which we can gauge success. Numbers help us understand how well we’re 
doing over time in an easily understandable and quantifiable way. If you have 
100 widgets, for example, you’d have no idea whether this is a strong number 
or not unless you had some relational understanding of how many widgets 
you had at some given point in the past. If you started with only one widget, 
then this increase would be a good thing if you’re in the market of owning 
as many widgets as possible. However, if you started with 1,000 widgets, this 

191

number is pretty poor. This is what metrics can do; they can show us relative 
improvements over a period of time.
Understanding Metrics: A Primer
Metrics are measurements, which, in community management, can help you 
understand the behaviors of people within your community. These metrics 
gauge a quantifiable performance aspect, and will ultimately guide future deci-
sions regarding your community strategy.
Metrics represent the measurable results of information, typically obtained 
through data. You might refer to specific metrics such as engagement or 
retweets, which is numerical information, or data that you can benchmark 
past and future metrics against to gauge success.
Metrics evolve out of data, which provide the primary source of information. 
There are two primary types of data:
Quantitative: Quantitative data is numerical informa-
tion, such as a percentage, or the number of coins in 
your purse. If you have a survey with a yes/no response, 
you can easily report on how many people said yes 
and how many people said no. You can identify this in 
terms of a ratio or percentage. (If 1/10 of the people 
said “yes,” this equals 10%.) Every time you administer 
the survey, you can track the results and see how they 
evolved. Many tools and programs can automate these 
results to help determine the success of your commu-
nity management efforts.
Qualitative: Qualitative data typically refers to research 
that can’t necessarily be broken down into numbers 
and percentages. Such research might include cus-
tomer feedback comments, insights from interactive 
group discussions, and observations. This is essentially 
comprised of specific feedback that can help you get 
perspective into why people think, feel, or act the way 
they do. In some cases, this type of data may take lon-
ger to review, but it can also add a level of depth to 
information that’s not viewable in quantitative data.
The first step in identifying important metrics is to determine what you want 
to measure based on your goals and hypotheses. This requires analyzing your 
data, identifying the points of weakness that need to be improved or the 
strengths that you can leverage, and using that data to decide where to focus 
your efforts. Engagement metrics, sales metrics, or customer service metrics 
may be relevant to a community manager.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
192
It’s also important to determine how to measure your success. This requires 
having a clear understanding of how your efforts may be able to help drive the 
selected metrics.
Decide which metrics to test, figure out what constitutes success and find the 
right tools to measure your progress. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are 
metrics that will give you specific ways to define success. We’ll get to those 
in a bit.
The Million Dollar Question:  Why Are Analytics  
Important?
I am always surprised when I encounter business owners or marketers who 
don’t understand the value of analytics. The reason I called this the Million 
Dollar Question is that using analytics to help you understand your data and 
metrics can help you drive ROI. Sometimes, it can be more than a million dol-
lars in ROI.
Analytics is the process of analyzing data to turn it into useful information.  
It can tell you, for example, how much time a person is spending on your 
website, or the process that people go through to find and “like” your page on 
Facebook. Most importantly, you can use analytics to pivot your strategies to 
increase your bottom line or your ROI. In fact, you can make an entire career 
of studying and reporting on analytic data.
Community managers need analytics to test hypotheses. Your ability to guess 
is based on the data you have, and, as we already learned, if you don’t have 
anything on which to base your guesses, it can be that much more difficult 
to generate any hypotheses that lead to real results. Analytics can also help 
you reach your defined goals. If your goal is to raise conversions by 10%, for 
example, you need analytics to tell you that your efforts have actually had the 
intended effect.
Analytics will, therefore, help to prove, or disprove, your theories. Analytics 
will be able to help you pinpoint exact behavioral patterns, so you can figure 
out what is driving these behaviors. Having analytic data can help you invest 
your time and money more wisely; you'll learn to invest in marketing tactics 
that result in real improvements.
This analytic data will also help you to know what’s working and what’s not. 
If you implement a strategy and the metrics don't improve, then you at least 
know what didn’t work. Even a metric that shows no results is valuable, 
because nothing happening is actually still something, and you can compare it 
against the hypothesis to determine why something didn’t work.

193
The Community Manager’s Playbook
Finally, analytics can help guide you in deciding what to change and what to 
keep. We’ve talked about the iterative testing process, and analytics provide 
proof that these different tests and experiments are driving different intended 
(or unintended) results.
DO I NEED A DATA SCIENTIST TO HELP WITH 
ANALYTICS?
In some businesses, data analysis is a full-time job. The people who study analytics 
in depth are often engineers, scientists, or, at the very least, information technology 
experts who have a capacity to understand complex analytics. While this is a trend in 
some fields, community managers don’t necessarily need this type of high-level training 
to effectively do their jobs. However, those aspiring community managers who are 
interested in learning more about detailed analytics can review tools such as Tableau, 
which offers in-depth, detailed visual analytics, or QlikView, which offers high-level 
business intelligence.
Defining Relevant KPIs
For your community strategy, the most important thing you can do is set goals. 
But it’s not enough to say “more subscribers” or “more sales.” It’s imperative 
to have a specific goal in mind to help you affect the broader success of the 
company. You can do this by identifying the KPIs, which are the most impor-
tant metrics.
Singling out KPIs guides your testing. You can’t test effectively if you don’t 
know what you’re trying to accomplish. Start by identifying which goals are 
the most important to your company: are you trying to build awareness, to 
create new customers, or to engage previous customers so they become 
repeat, loyal customers? For each of these goals, you’ll rely on a different set 
of metrics to figure out whether you’re reaching these broader goals.
If your goal is to build awareness, then one of your KPIs might be as simple as 
getting more “likes” on Facebook. If you’re trying to get more past customers 
to become repeat customers, then it will be more important to identify email 
open rate and click-through rate as a key performance indicator.
Here’s a list of possible metrics that can help guide your testing:
Conversion rate (creating a customer)
• 
Email signups
• 
Cost per conversion
• 
Visits to your Web site
• 

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
194
Unique visitors
• 
Average visit duration
• 
Email open rate
• 
Click-through rate
• 
Page views
• 
Facebook engagement (shares, likes, and comments)
• 
Number of followers
• 
Number of website visitors (including returning and 
• 
repeat visitors)
Bounce rate (the percentage of site visitors who imme-
• 
diately leave your site without exploring anything deeper 
than the home page)
Cost per click
• 
Demographic metrics
• 
The list goes on. The types of things you’re able to track may vary depending 
on your analytics programs, but it’s essential to identify what’s most important 
to your business, and create a strategy to help guide that performance to 
achieve better results.
Exercise One: Define KPIs Relevant to Your 
Company or Community
Take a look back at all your research and data, and review those hypotheses 
you developed in the early chapters. These should help provide a solid foun-
dation for establishing weaknesses in your current community management 
process, and should help you solidify which metrics are most important to 
help you grow your company.
Identify which metrics are most important to you. Try to be as specific as 
possible and look for metrics that might not be so obvious, because thinking 
this through carefully will help you design a community strategy to address 
those specific issues.
For example, if you run a website, you probably want as many people as pos-
sible to visit it. And, you probably also want them to spend as much time as 
possible perusing the information on your site. So, some of the most useful 
metrics you would evaluate in order to understand whether your website is a 
success are the number of site visitors, their time on site, and the bounce rate. 

195
The Community Manager’s Playbook
The number of site visitors should be high, as should the amount of time they 
spend on the site. However, because the bounce rate describes the percent-
age of visitors that leave your site after visiting only the first page, then you 
would want this number to be low.
Collecting Data from Day One
It’s okay if you don’t have significant experience reviewing and analyzing data. 
I’m going to teach you how to do that in a future chapter. Right now, the goal is 
to make sure you’re collecting the right data, so that when you do start imple-
menting your strategies, you can actually review the results. Do whatever it 
takes to make sure you’re collecting data. You can talk to your web develop-
ment team about implementing analytics tracking software on the website, 
start using social media listening tools with built-in analytics programs, and 
make sure you’ve identified the right key performance indicators to help you 
drive the business objectives that we identified early on.
Tools for gathering and interpreting data include:
Google Analytics: This free offering is a go-to tool for 
• 
marketers, and it provides numerous options to help you 
improve your website metrics.
Omniture: Adobe’s website analytics tool offers a com-
• 
plex set of integrated tools, including website analytics, 
campaign analytics, and social analytics, to help you opti-
mize your digital marketing.
KissMetrics: This customer-driven tool allows you to 
• 
track an individual’s actions, even if that person visits your 
site on multiple devices.
Optimizely: Through A/B testing, split testing, and multi-
• 
variate testing, Optimizely allows you to test changes on 
your page, showcasing the best solutions and allowing 
you to optimize your page accordingly.
Unbounce: Unbounce allows anyone, even those with 
• 
limited knowledge of website development, to build 
and optimize a landing page without any information 
technology.
Hootsuite: Hootsuite provides analytics and information 
• 
strictly for social media, including engagement, listening, 
analytics, and more.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
196
Bit.ly: Bit.ly is an easy and free way for users to track how 
• 
many clicks a link has received.
MailChimp: This integrated email marketing platform and 
• 
analytics dashboard allows the user to view email open 
rates, clicks through to the website, and much more.
This is just a sampling of the tools that are available for use to monitor KPIs. 
Ideally, you should use a mixture of these tools as part of your community man-
agement strategy. For instance, while tools such as Google Analytics, Omniture 
and KissMetrics can help you to evaluate your website metrics, there are some 
differences in the way they present and tally data. Most community managers 
will benefit from selecting and implementing the tools that provide the needed 
information, and present it in an easily comprehensible interface. Almost every 
digital marketing tool on the market now includes analytics.
What to Think about When Building a 
Community Strategy
There are tactics that can help you distill this information and determine the 
places to start building your community strategy.
It’s important to review the most important elements of what you’ve found 
already: what is your brand? Who is your audience? What differentiates you 
from competitors? Where have your audience members already formed com-
munities online? What are they saying about your brand? Thinking about these 
things in collaboration with each other can give you a bigger picture under-
standing of where to start, which can help you answer the question:
Where Should I Host My Community?
This is one of the essential questions to ask when building a community strat-
egy. Many times, people who are less experienced in the space immediately 
assume Facebook and Twitter are the best channels for them. This makes 
sense on one level, given that they’re both widely recognized social media 
outlets, but what if most of your audience is in another country where Twitter 
isn’t such a widely used tool? You have to think carefully about these issues 
when building your strategy. If you’ve done your social media listening exer-
cises, you should have a pretty good sense of where your audience already 
exists online.
No matter which channel you opt to start with, you’ll need to decide how to 
approach it. For example, if you’re a brand that’s been around for a while that 
people love, it’s possible one of your super fans has already created a Facebook 
page or Twitter account for your brand.

197
The Community Manager’s Playbook
Facebook is pretty good about allowing the actual brand to take over when 
someone starts a fan page and then fails to monitor it, or if they fail to prove 
that they’re the official brand page. If there is already a page that has a built-in 
audience, it might be a solid place to begin to build your community. Think 
of it like moving to a new city and trying to make friends. Would you host a 
party or go to where the party is? When you don’t have many friends in an 
area (e.g. a community), throwing your own party isn't going to be successful. 
It would be better to go to a party, meet new people and create relationships, 
before trying to get them to come over to your apartment.
On the other hand, even if a page has already been established, you might 
look at it and decide that it doesn’t have a large enough subscriber base, or 
that it doesn’t seem entirely on-brand for your business. Perhaps, there’s no 
page at all. In that case, you might want to build your brand’s existence on a 
social media channel from the ground up. For brands targeted toward younger 
people, this may mean focusing on Tumblr or YouTube instead of Facebook. I’ll 
be breaking down some of the larger possible channels in a future chapter.
When trying to identify which of these paths to follow, be sure to consider 
the following:
The main place of action: Where do these conversa-
tions take place? You should have developed some 
ideas about this during Chapter 7. You might find that 
the action takes place on your own website, via mes-
sage boards or blog comments, and, if this is the case, 
you can consider hosting your community on your 
own platform.
Where you’re going to drive traffic: If you’re trying to 
drive traffic to get involved with a community platform 
that you own, then it may not make sense to have com-
munities spread out all over different social networks. 
Think carefully about how the network can help you 
drive traffic—for instance, Instagram makes it some-
what difficult to do any real marketing, but it might be 
a great outlet for a celebrity or an aspiring brand.
Your target location: What is the end goal? In other words, 
where do your community members already spend 
time and where do you want to host them? Remember 
that people use different platforms in different ways, so 
if you have a professional networking self-hosted com-
munity, you might also want to have a LinkedIn group 
to help drive people to use your product.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
198
What Channels Should I Use?
We’ll get into a detailed discussion of channels in Chapter 11, which covers 
platforms. Think of channels in the way that you might think of television 
channels: they are defined vehicles for expression, even though the content 
therein might vary. Facebook is a conduit for photos and status updates, but 
the content that appears will vary by user. Therefore, Facebook is the chan-
nel through which these users are creating content. There are numerous big 
platforms and even more new ones popping up every day, which is why this 
warrants a deeper discussion. But the conversation on channels is important 
to strategy, of course, so let's take a quick look now.
Think carefully about the focus of your community strategy and what you’re 
trying to accomplish and how various channels can help you fulfill your goals. 
For instance, many companies flock to Facebook because there are so many 
people already there, and it’s easy to share and exchange information and 
build up a brand presence. Highly visual brands might find more success with 
image-focused networks such as Pinterest or Instagram. Media companies 
love Twitter, because it’s easy to tweet a headline and share a link directly to 
an article. What's more, their social media accounts can also use hashtags to 
encourage audience discovery and focus on trending topics. But, does your 
tutoring company need a Pinterest page? Unless one of the cornerstones of 
your brand is highly compelling visual imagery, then probably not.
In selecting channels, it’s tempting to think you need to be everywhere, espe-
cially when so much of marketing involves focusing on the newest trends and 
services. Don’t fall into this trap! The goal here is to pick the channels that will 
be the most beneficial to your business. If you’re strapped for bandwidth, then 
focus on a single channel and do that channel right. Once you’ve mastered 
that channel, then you can expand into other channels, and do so bringing the 
knowledge that you gained from testing the first channel into your broadening 
strategy. Don’t get in the bad habit of setting up pages you never use. This can 
create confusion and make it harder for people to find you on social media. 
It’s my opinion that in most cases, having an inactive page is worse than having 
no page at all.
Tip

  Don’t spread your resources too thin. It’s better to choose one channel and do it well rather 
than try to maintain a superficial presence on many different channels.

199
The Community Manager’s Playbook
Look for Communities Not (Yet) under Your Control
Sometimes, people love brands so much that they create accounts either 
mimicking these brands or even claiming to represent the brand. This may be 
because the brand doesn’t already have a strong social media presence and, 
as a super-fan, the creator wanted a place to engage. In fact, there are a lot 
of reasons why someone might do this—but the goal for you is to seek out 
these rogue pages and figure out how to handle them.
You can decide to list the account as an impostor account and have it taken 
down, but it’s important to find out why the page exists and what people are 
actually saying. If it’s just a dedicated fan page, then it might make the most 
sense to work with the site to help migrate the fan base to an official account, 
or to make sure it differentiates itself by making it clear that the site is not an 
official page.
Tip

■
  To create a clear social identity, it’s important to use the same names (company and profile 
name) and logos on all your social media outlets. It’s also useful to brand your “Vanity URLs.” A vanity 
URL is allowed on many platforms in order to turn a long auto-populated chain of characters into 
something easy to remember and promote. For example, I selected LinkedIn.com/in/perksconsulting 
as my vanity URL so that people could find me by my name and the company name, as people often 
recognize my professional work by my consultancy, Perks Consulting. Some platforms, like Twitter, 
assign the URL, and it appears as a vanity URL based on your handle. Mine is: Twitter.com/
LaurenPerkins
Host the Community Yourself?
There’s one more approach to hosting your community: do it yourself. In fact, 
there are entire businesses built up around this model, and some are hugely 
successful in niche spaces. For instance, in the fitness space, you can check out 
Greatist and Fitocracy. In the arts space, Kickstarter has done an excellent job 
of cultivating a community within its own platform as well as on other chan-
nels. At least initially, this approach can be more resource-heavy, but, for some 
businesses, it can also facilitate interactions that can help grow the brand over 
the long-term. By drawing people into your own hosted platform, you can 
create a place where your fans can feel free to interact and engage with one 
another. In some cases, your business may even be that community, and, in 
those cases, it’s best to make sure you have a dedicated community presence 
on your own platform. You can do this by creating a “members” area with a 
login, or a message board, which may afford more control over how people 
use the space than with Facebook or Twitter.

CASE STUDY FOODSPOTTING
With the rise of the smartphone in 2007, people now have cameras at the tips of their 
fingers everywhere they go. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter make it very 
easy to share these photos. But, in 2010, an amazing breakthrough occurred: Instagram 
made it possible for anyone to take photos that could mimic the look of a professional 
or vintage photo. Instagram allows for easy, on-the-go photo editing by providing filters 
with presets for saturation, tone, brightness, and exposure that photographers and 
more casual shutterbugs were accustomed to spending hours trying to recreate on 
their computers with expensive software. What did people start shooting? Well, given 
that humans are wired to salivate at the site of a delicious burger or a massive steak, it 
should have been no surprise that people started taking pictures of their food.
Alexa Andrzejewski noticed this trend, but she was more interested in where it was 
headed. She also noticed that even with all these pictures of food, no one was really 
collecting or maintaining them. Alexa created a coffee table book with photos of the 
most interesting dishes in the world. But she wasn’t done. She also thought there might 
be a way to help people identify, share, and celebrate meals within a network of like-
minded people. And, with that, she founded Foodspotting, an online recommendation 
and discovery network for people to share and exchange photos of food.1 She also built 
a community around the product. People can upload photos of food, share reviews, and 
make recommendations as to what to eat when dining at a particular restaurant.
Last year, OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation management system, acquired 
Foodspotting for $10 million, a testament to the value of Foodspotting’s foodie 
community.
Making the Final Hosting Decision
In deciding where to host, you’ll need to draw upon everything you’ve learned 
as a result of your listening and discovery. You should know where your audi-
ence lives. So the harder question becomes which platform makes the most 
sense to use.
In making that decision, you’ll want to define and confirm each of the 
following:
Audience: You’ve done all your target audience home-
work, so you should already have your audience clearly 
defined. Do the hypotheses you’ve made match the 
results of your online listening and discovery? If not, 
then you may need to take a step back and test again.

Positioning: Is your brand positioning consistent with the 
brand positioning you outlined in your brand brief? If 
not, what needs to happen to reclaim that positioning? 
Don’t forget that each channel has its own value, so it’s 
important to understand your positioning relative to 
competitors in order to help select the best channels 
or platforms for your brand.
Approach: What is your brand’s approach to social 
media? If you’re not posting on a daily basis, Twitter 
may not be quite as relevant for you. Each channel and 
platform has special characteristics. For instance, lon-
ger-form blog content is not good for Twitter, but you 
can post a link to your blog post via Twitter, so in that 
way, you’d still benefit from incorporating that platform 
into your strategy.
Goal Setting: What are you seeking to accomplish? If 
the goal is to keep a small community highly engaged, 
then perhaps something more specific such as a mes-
sage board community or a membership platform is the 
way to go. However, if you’re trying to raise awareness 
of your B2B services, you might want to try LinkedIn.
In some ways, community management is like choosing the right venue for 
your event. In the same way that you wouldn’t want to have a wedding in a 
dive bar, you also wouldn’t want to try to create a community in a place that 
doesn’t fit your brand.
After you’ve thought about all these things, you’ll now want to make the deci-
sion as to where to host. Unfortunately, that alone isn’t enough—you also 
need to come in with a clear distribution message and ideas to seed conver-
sations. Those listening and discovery exercises keep getting more and more 
valuable, don’t they?
We’ll be covering content calendars later on. But for now, make sure you have 
some solid ideas as to what people are tweeting about and covering in the space.
Will the Community Follow You?
If you made insightful hypotheses, your community will follow you to what-
ever hosting platform you choose. The best way to find out if you’ve made 
the right decision? Test! And, when you do begin to implement your social 
strategy, make sure there are clear calls to action to help drive traffic to your 
social channels. You can also host contests, create promoted posts or tweets, 
and try to reach out to influencers in your community.

 Management Strategy

And remember, the best way to make them come is to provide interesting, 
relevant and sharable content, and make sure your digital presence really feels 
like a community.
If you’re having trouble connecting with the target audience, check for con-
sistency in the brand message, the audience and the channels you’re thinking 
of using to help reach your audience. Validate this against where you find your 
audience in the online space. Then, form a hypothesis about what would be 
the best way to connect with those people. You should know from all your 
research, customer discovery/validation and assessment work what you need 
to do to bring your community to life or bring it to the next level. This is a 
case where there’s no “right” answer, but the decisions you make here will 
guide you to your goals. Developing a theory based on solid hypotheses is the 
way to create a winning community management strategy and tactical plan.

  Every so often, you should challenge the assumptions that you made when you developed 
your brand brief. Sometimes, managers who think they know their brand become disconnected from 
who the audience actually is and don’t understand just who is participating in conversations about 
the brand. You may find you need to revise elements of your brand brief—such as key differentiators 
or competitor analysis—after completing your social media listening exercises, target audience 
analysis, and observations about your brand’s role in the digital ecosystem.
Engage with Existing Communities
Once you’ve figured out the best channels for your brand, consider engaging 
with existing communities. We’ll use this term rather broadly here: we’re not 
just talking about communities that are directly involved with your business 
(for example, a Lululemon fan club), but also related communities (such as 
yoga enthusiasts).
These are the communities that are not within your direct control, but are 
still expressing some form of interest in your brand. On Facebook, they may 
be dedicated groups, or they may just be individual people who are using 
hashtags or mentions to explain how they’re feeling about your brand. You 
probably have a pretty good sense of who these folks are: we dedicated the 
bulk of Chapter 7 to finding them and communicating with them.
For the most part, it is a good idea to help build awareness about your page 
by reaching out to existing communities. However, this requires some degree 
of thought and tact. If you beg someone to “like” your page and there isn’t a 
clear value proposition, that may be a turn-off. A good community manager 
will engage by becoming a member of the community, and by adhering to my 
rule of thumb that out of every ten messages, only one should be specifically 
dedicated to hawking your products or service.

203
The Community Manager’s Playbook
The benefit of working with existing communities is that they’ve already found 
their space. They are talking about issues relevant to you and can be a great 
resource to help you keep your finger on the pulse of your industry.
You may not want to start here if the members of the communities seem to 
be misinformed, or are not the correct audience to match your brand. If your 
audience doesn’t match your brand’s aspirations, and you try to engage the 
wrong audience as a result, it can lead to dilution of the brand.
You also should have a plan for how to work with these communities. As I 
mentioned previously, you can’t just come in talking about how great you are. 
No one likes a braggart; don’t show off on social media. You'll turn people 
off. Instead, remember that people really respond when you take an interest 
in them, commenting on their images and accomplishments, and sharing their 
successes with others.
The method you choose to operate can also influence your community. For 
instance, Facebook settings allow you to modify who can post on your brand’s 
timeline and control the types of content they can share. It’s important to 
view this from every angle. Companies that get a lot of negative feedback 
exacerbate it by blocking people from commenting or posting, which leads to 
a lack of engagement and breakdowns in customer service.
CHEAP TRICKS THE PROBLEM WITH BUYING 
FOLLOWERS
If you’ve been in the digital space for a while, you may have heard that it’s possible 
to buy followers. This practice usually violates most sites’ terms of service, and I do 
not advise it either. While purchasing likes or follows on the “black market” may seem 
like a cheap way to boost your reach on social media, the reality is that the followers 
you get will most likely be from “click farms” in third-world countries, where people get 
paid to like as many pages as possible. These clicks are unlikely to add any real value 
within your community because people whose goal is to like as many pages as possible 
are probably not interested in actually engaging with the content. There are tools that 
attempt to identify how many of a brand’s followers are bots or fake accounts; too many 
of these can reflect poorly on your brand.
Exercise Two: Map Your Digital Landscape
Now, it’s time for you to map your own digital landscape. Mapping your digital 
landscape will help you visualize opportunities for creating content and culti-
vating a community, and it will also provide perspective on how all these areas 
intersect with one another. The goal of this exercise is to identify the areas to 

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
204
prioritize in developing a community strategy that will create the most value. 
Here’s how it’s done:
Identify all forms of media you use for your brand. For most brands, this list would 
include items like your website, along with mobile, location, social, digital, and 
traditional media.
Determine your assets. These may vary based on company, but think about them 
in relation to each channel. For traditional media, you might have billboard or 
print ads in newspapers. You website may not just mean your website—it 
might mean your blog, your e-commerce portals, and any message boards or 
other site-based community platforms. Do the same with mobile. Do you have 
an app? A mobile-optimized site? Both? It’s important to have this distinction 
from website assets because mobile users do not experience your site con-
tent the same way. With more and more people using mobile, it is not enough 
to simply rely on your desktop site to do the work of a mobile platform.
Identify your location-based assets. Perhaps you run events, or have location-
based assets such as QR codes. You’ll also want to address your digital assets, 
which include your e-mail marketing, but also those that may be less obvious, 
like search engine optimization and keyword ownership, as well as search 
engine marketing efforts. It’s possible you have other digital assets such as ad 
networks or affiliate marketing.
Address social assets. This goes beyond the channels you use. Consider items 
such as paid marketing on these channels. Or, if you are an e-commerce plat-
form and you have a social commerce aspect outside of paid advertising, you 
would include this here as well. As Facebook ramps up its own Buy button 
and commerce platform throughout the next few years, we will likely see a 
spike in the social assets involving e-commerce.
Identify your channels. Which channels do you use? Most lists will include 
Facebook and Twitter. You may have location-based channels as well, such 
as Foursquare or Yelp. Or, you may have other digital assets that aren’t really 
social networks, such as travel sites like Travelocity or TripAdvisor that share 
reviews.
Now that you have an inventory, what do you see? It’s not unusual for even a 
small company to have six types of media, 11 types of assets and five or more 
channels. Are you overwhelmed yet? Well, thankfully, this is where your strategy 
will come into play. Completing this mapping exercise can help you focus on the 
areas that are right for you to prioritize as part of your community strategy.
Here, you’ve mapped all the existing assets, channels and media that would 
present a potential launching pad for a community strategy. This assessment 
helps you understand why you might be sometimes strapped for bandwidth in 
trying to keep them all updated and relevant. Instead, your strategy can help 
you focus on the ones that add the most value. If your business has an old 
YouTube video that has a single, low-quality video with only 53 views, you may 

205
The Community Manager’s Playbook
wish to delete it entirely. Or, if you set up a brand page on Pinterest because 
you heard it was a good idea, then realized your audience isn’t on Pinterest, 
you might find that the work maintaining it is compromising the time you 
could spend exercising another platform to more effectively reach your fans.
Assess Bandwidth
One of the biggest barriers to developing a community strategy and executing 
it can be realistically assessing bandwidth. I mentioned that it might be a good 
idea to start with just one or two channels and build out when you can. Social 
media is easily its own job, and that falls outside the realm of developing a self-
hosted platform if that’s the direction you choose to go.
Like all the topics we’ve discussed, the best way to assess bandwidth is to test. 
Learn what your team can realistically accomplish on a day-to-day basis, and 
build out larger projects. If your community strategy drives the type of ROI 
that can significantly help your business, then it might be time to hire some-
one else to help manage different aspects of the community. Again, there’s no 
single way to create and run a community strategy, so different strategies may 
have different needs.
Consider the short-term requirements, compare them against the long-term 
plan, and think ahead. Be realistic about how long these things take, and don’t 
be afraid to hold people accountable when the situation warrants it. Also, 
remember that in this evolving space, your plan may change even quicker than 
you can click “post status update.”
CASE STUDY JETBLUE CHEEPS PROMOTION
JetBlue invests a lot of time and energy into maintaining its social platforms and has 
one of the most loyal Twitter followings of any airline. The primary JetBlue account is 
very aspirational, fun and full of exciting reasons you might want to book a flight. The 
people who run the brand’s account also support active engagement, scouring Twitter 
for mentions and replying to people who tweet at them.
However, JetBlue made a choice that some might see as risky. They decided to create a 
new Twitter account called JetBlue Cheeps, which tweets discounts and deals to people 
who follow this account. The initial goal was for the brand to continue to grow its Twitter 
presence, but the results have also led to verifiable success in last minute flight ticket 
sales. People spot the deal and due to the flash sales mentality end up booking flights 
that they might not have booked otherwise.
According to reports, the JetBlue Cheeps program was a direct response to listening to 
what consumers wanted, and then acting on that insight.

Set Goals
So far, we’ve covered metrics, identifying KPIs, making choices as to which 
strategies might succeed and mapping our digital media landscape. But, because 
you’ve been reading this book and taking excellent notes so far, you know we 
need to have a method to test our hypothesis so we can check our results 
against a baseline level. That means it’s time to set some goals.
One of the questions I hear frequently about goals is “How am I supposed to 
know what to measure if I’ve never done this before?” It’s a valid question, but 
the reality is that if you’ve been doing your research and listening, you should 
have some idea of what might be feasible. Setting goals helps you understand 
when you’re successful, and to track how far you’re off when you’re not. 
Setting numerical goals gives you something to strive for, and if you’re off the 
mark, it can help you understand why you failed. Without tangible numerical 
goals, you have no way to know if you are making any progress.
What, exactly, do you want to establish with your community management 
strategy? Remember that a strategy is a living, breathing document, and that 
it’s subject to review or change every so often.
KPIs are the metrics that help you achieve your broader goals. If, for instance, 
your goal is to raise awareness, then the number of new visitors to your site 
can help confirm that you’re building awareness. It’s important to draw only 
logical inferences from this kind of information, as it’s easy to assume that a 
spike in traffic after a Facebook post, for example, is evidence of Facebook 
engagement. But you may learn that could be something such as a TV appear-
ance that caused more people to visit the site.
But what are some of those bigger goals? It’ll depend on your business  
objectives. Let’s begin by looking at potential qualitative goals.
Qualitative Goals
Qualitative goals relate to overarching goals that indirectly drive ROI. Examples 
include:
Generating word-of-mouth buzz
• 
Increasing customer loyalty
• 
Bringing outside ideas into the organization
• 
Increasing product or brand awareness
• 
Targeting and engaging influential customers
• 
Building brand equity (through brand loyalty or engagement)
• 

207
The Community Manager’s Playbook
For each of these, certain KPIs may indicate the success of the goals. You 
might decide that you can determine brand awareness based on an uptick in 
the number of social media mentions, or you might measure a person’s level 
of influence based on that’s person’s shares and retweets. However, the goals 
themselves are less tangible. For instance, you may have evidence of growing 
brand equity through your social media listening efforts, but it’s hard to put a 
value against the brand equity. So instead, we have to rely on qualitative data 
to help us understand whether our efforts were successful. 
Quantitative Goals
Quantitative goals tie into the actual numerical data that drive the business. 
Such goals may include:
Reducing support costs
• 
Reducing research costs
• 
Generating sales (growing market share, generating mar-
• 
keting ROI, increasing sales conversion)
Generating leads (growth rates, new member registra-
• 
tions, new Facebook likes, new Twitter followers, mem-
ber loyalty, member satisfaction, targeting and rewarding 
active members, influencer and evangelist identification)
Increasing conversions (Google pay-per-click, traffic to 
• 
website, Facebook SEM, click-through rates, more new 
customers)
As you can see, the benefits of these types of goals are directly measurable 
in terms of bottom-line financial data or hard metrics. From them, you may 
discover that you want to design a community strategy to reduce support 
costs by creating a more efficient customer service platform via social media, 
or you may want to increase sales by implementing a community strategy that 
encourages people to become customers, such as a discount or incentive to 
purchase.
It’s important to keep sight of the bigger-picture goals through any strategy 
development process, as it can be easy to lose sight of your long-term goals 
when you’re in the nitty gritty of analytics. Both qualitative and quantitative 
goals have their place, so be sure to identify which of these you’re trying to 
reach in your community strategy.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
208
Set Realistic Goals
Wouldn’t it be great if that Facebook post you just created lead to a million 
new likes and a hundred million new engagements? Well, if you’re a new com-
pany and are hoping to get those kinds of numbers, you’re probably setting 
yourself up for failure. It’s important to manage your expectations, because 
if you don’t, then you might find yourself spending valuable and expensive 
resources on a strategy that ultimately backfires. Base your assumptions on 
your previously drawn hypotheses, and supplement this with any existing data 
you might have about the goal you seek to accomplish.
Qualitative Goals Should Lead to Quantitative Goals
Think about it: a goal to raise brand awareness is kind of nebulous. If you 
go into testing with just that in mind, it’s hard to know where to focus your 
efforts. But, when you tell yourself that you want to increase brand awareness 
(qualitative) and you intend to track this by tracking the number of Facebook 
likes (quantitative), you now have a way to focus your community manage-
ment strategy.
If you haven’t tested much, and you’re just starting out, it may be okay to 
simply say you want to drive growth and to not assign a numerical goal to it. 
But as you become more familiar with testing and see more and more results, 
you’ll be able to more accurately make predictions about how certain behav-
iors might influence your brand. For instance, if you notice you get 10% more 
“likes” every time you run a promotion, then you can aim to run another 
promotion with a goal of 15% more “likes.” This is called benchmarking, and 
you can benchmark your progress against metrics you’ve seen and analyzed 
in previous tests.
Particularly in the early stages of your community management planning, you 
might find that your qualitative metrics don’t tell the whole story. Even if you 
do see a spike in traffic on the date of a Facebook or Twitter push, that doesn’t 
necessarily mean it’s going to result in more conversions. If you see this hap-
pening, or if you notice a high bounce rate on your homepage analytics, then 
this is likely something worth investigating: you may have a mismatch between 
the target audience and your actual customer. Identify where you may be 
missing the mark, and figure out what tests you can perform to help lead you 
in the right direction.

PRO TIPS TO HELP YOU GROW
If you’ve been reading along and doing on the exercises, you might feel like your head 
is about to explode. But, even if you feel like you perhaps know everything you need to 
know, there are some times when you just might not see the growth you’re expecting.
Identify and Test Niche Customer Segments
So much testing! But if you haven’t figured it out by now, testing—and testing correctly—
is one of the most important things you can do as a community manager. If you’re not 
hitting the right stride in gaining followers or likes, it may be because you haven’t yet 
discovered the right customer segment. Make sure you’ve identified potential customer 
segments through your online listening, For instance, if you’re a business or networking 
community and you don’t seem to be having much success with Facebook, why not try 
to reach your audience through groups on LinkedIn that deal within your field? You might 
be impressed with the results. This is an example of identifying and connecting with a 
niche audience. Many large companies build their foundations out of service to niche 
audiences, such as Nike’s targeting of athletes. As the company continues to grow, it 
can also reach out to more customer segments.
Test Niche Segments through Benchmarking
Yes, I’m really making you drill down here. Once you identify a few prospective niche 
customer segments and have seen some degree of success, it’s time for you to test 
each of these efforts through benchmarking. Try to set higher goals for your efforts, 
and, if you’re not seeing greater returns, keep experimenting. Does writing funny posts 
get more engagement than straightforward ones? Does adding an image to your post 
lead to more shares? Learning which tactics work best for you is key, and can offer 
opportunities for repeat performance or, ideally, even better performance. This is called 
“optimizing for success.” The goal here is to find ways to reach the maximum amount 
of success with the lowest amount of overhead. By nailing down those niche segments 
and optimizing, you’ll be able to optimize to reach and engage your target in accordance 
with your goals.
The testing never stops. If you want to be a good community manager, get used to it!
How Will You Increase User Acquisition?
Trying to convert someone and asking them to spend their time or resources 
with you is a big task.
Word of mouth is a great strategy for building a user base, and it’s one that 
can be replicated in the digital space. Try getting involved in the conversation 
on Twitter—making sure relevant people are aware of you and what you’re 
trying to accomplish. You could target influencers and do specific outreach to 
try to get them to vouch for your product or service.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
210
Another way to drive users is through producing useful content. You can 
produce blog content to help provide relevant information to potential cus-
tomers, to teach people how to use your product, or keep them abreast 
of innovations in the space. Content can be shared on social media outlets, 
which may lead to more likes and shares that you may be able to ultimately 
leverage to increase your user base.
In terms of user acquisition, you get out what you put in… if you have a 
great product and you’re out there connecting with people, you’ll solidify the 
touch points that secure interest in your product, and those people should 
ultimately become your customers.
How Will You Increase Engagement? 
In order to have a relevant community strategy, you will need to have an 
engaged community. Think about the reasons you engage with brands on 
Facebook or Twitter. Perhaps these brands are funny, or they are providing 
interesting content. Or, maybe you engaged them as part of a larger promo-
tion, like a contest to tweet back a photo of you wearing their product. It is 
possible they even engaged with you first. You can leverage your experiences 
to create strategies to help increase engagement.
How Will You Increase Positive Sentiment?
So you’re getting all the mentions and engagement, but unfortunately, they’re 
not all positive. How can you improve this? If you want to increase sentiment, 
it’s important to do things that will help people view you in a more positive 
light. Focusing your strategy on sharing positive and uplifting content might 
be a starting point, and making a point to quickly respond to complaints is 
another great step.
A few additional ways to reach people: search for trending topics and join in 
the conversation, source feedback from the audience, target via hashtags, look 
for and use keywords and proactively search for brand mentions that don’t 
use the brand’s official handle or profile.

211
The Community Manager’s Playbook
MONITOR PERFORMANCE
We’ve set our goals and logged our KPIs—but we need to know what to actually monitor. 
Here are a few biggies.
Engagement: Track the ways people respond to and interact with your brand. You 
should also be monitoring what they’re saying, the sentiment behind the mentions 
and the potential influence of the interaction. You can develop great insights from both 
qualitative and quantitative monitoring, so make sure to employ both methods in order 
to get results.
Scale: If your goal is to create awareness, it is necessary to measure the reach of 
your community efforts. This is more than just counting the number of retweets and 
Facebook shares. Analytics tools can give you insight into the demographics relating to 
those analytics, proving insights as to who might be your target audience (and if you’ve 
identified the right one).
Profitability: Are your strategies actually profitable for your business. If so, then how 
much? It’s important to take into consideration not just your actual financial resources 
invested in the project (especially if paid media is part of your strategy), but the time 
investment of your employees. ROI, you'll find, is your best friend here.
Virality: Ah, the marketer’s favorite word! It’s great when branded content goes viral, 
but it’s also important to monitor what people are doing after the fact. After the viral 
moments, are you still seeing upticks in performance metrics? Sometimes it goes far 
beyond the number of views.
Execute!
Now that you know what to measure, why you’re measuring it, and what 
you’re planning to affect the results, you can move on to the next part: execu-
tion. This means actually implementing the strategy you’ve created. You may 
have a lot of ideas, so there may be a learning curve to what you can actu-
ally accomplish within the parameters of the strategy that you’ve created. 
Continue testing and optimizing, to determine where you’re seeing the great-
est results. These execution strategies are rarely complete, so set up timelines 
for implementation and work with your team to get them on board with the 
bigger strategy of what you want to accomplish. This brings us to the content 
strategy.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
212
Put a Content Execution Plan into Action
One of the cornerstones of building a community is content. Above, we helped 
you assess which channels and media might be a strong fit for your business, 
and we talked about setting goals to help determine the effectiveness of such 
strategies. Now, it’s time to dig into the content strategy, which will embody 
all the strategic choices about where to post and share content, what types of 
content to share and how often to share it.
A content strategy isn’t a content calendar, though that will come into play a 
bit later on. A content strategy is a go-to document that contains the plan for 
your content—not just the types of content you’ll create, but also why you’ve 
chosen to go in these directions. It outlines your goals as well.
Think of the content strategy as your articulation of the strategy across the 
brand or business. Even though you’ve done a lot of work leading up to this, 
this is the part that will be visible across your workplace and will keep your 
team in the know about why you’ve made the choices you have.
This document should be something anyone can read and easily understand 
the thought process involved in your strategy. It helps to put it in writing, so 
you can refer to it as you move forward.
The real value of a content strategy is twofold. First, it should give a detailed 
list of content types and parameters. This document should address where 
you’re posting, how often you’re posting, and the messages you’re relaying. It 
also should determine whether you’ve allocated efforts to paid media. For 
many companies, this document will also assign roles and responsibilities as 
to how to manage the content (i.e. who handles the content creation, who 
handles the posting, and who handles the tracking and monitoring). No two 
brands will ever have identical content strategies because there are so many 
fundamental differences that are unique to a given brand, its target audience 
and the community surrounding it. Second, it should offer guidelines as to a 
creation approach.
There have to be guidelines on the types of images, posts, and videos you 
share because it all has to be on-brand. If it’s not on-brand, people will quickly 
notice, and you may even experience backlash. The approach to creating con-
tent is also important because it helps outline the process. People must know 
their roles in the process in order to fully execute on them, which makes the 
content strategy document an incredibly valuable tool.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
Messaging, Voice, and Style Guide
Many companies plan to have a voice and style guide before they begin their 
community strategy. It’s great to be able to get this together, as it’ll help with 
everything from listing what words to avoid, to letting new contributors 
understand the brand voice, to helping your community managers to under-
stand the landscape of the messaging guidelines. However, such guides take 
a long time to create, and even the best style guide can’t account for every 
situation that might occur as you are building a community. A better way to 
do this is to create a collaborative document using Google Docs or related 
software, and to encourage key stakeholders to add their thoughts when they 
can. This is an agile approach to creating a style guide that will also allow you 
to get your community strategy off the ground without delay.
Don’t Forget Positioning
Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are entirely different channels. Therefore, it’s 
likely that you’ll want to have different positioning on each of them. Instagram 
is a place for visual imagery and does very little in terms of allowing you to 
link back your content. The types of things you post on Instagram will likely 
vary from what you post on Facebook or Twitter. Each channel has important 
distinctions that can allow you to leverage them for best use.
In developing a positioning strategy, it’s important to go back to the competi-
tor analysis you completed earlier in the book. You can’t very well position 
yourself if you don’t know what you’re positioning yourself against! And, what  
you’re really doing here is examining the fit between the product or service and 
the market. Your audience or potential audience is already giving you tons of 
information to help you, so here’s where it becomes important for you to figure 
out your positioning and structure your community strategy around that.
Develop a Messaging Approach
You have the voice and style, and you also understand your brand’s community 
positioning relative to competitors. The next step is to figure out your mes-
saging approach.
You’ll notice that some brands post entirely different content on Facebook 
and Twitter than they do on their blogs, or that sometimes the social media 
content supplements the blog content. People on Facebook tend to not read 
long posts, and Twitter is no more than 140 characters. Determine what makes 
sense based on the strategic planning you’ve done to date and the channel, 
and go with it.

Chapter 8 | Building and Implementing a Community  
 Management Strategy
214
Don’t be afraid to be agile—remember that part of the reason we love Twitter 
is because it supports our ability to respond in the moment. Blog posts, how-
ever, take more time to write, and they may need to go through a series of 
approvals prior to publishing the content. Manage your team with this in mind, 
finding the balance between giving them the opportunities to post content of 
their choice and having an approval chain for items that require more thor-
ough review.
It’s also important to figure out your role in others’ content. If you see a 
post you like, how are you going to respond to it? Are you going to retweet, 
or do you tend to just stick with likes? Can you be funny? What if the post 
relays negative sentiment? These seem like minor details, but are actually very 
important in helping you maintain consistency across channels. Community 
managers are like sea captains surveying the seas around them and charting 
an appropriate course based on what they see and hear from a variety of 
channels.
Remember the digital landscape chart you designed earlier? The goal here is 
to make sure to look at the different media and channels and devise how you 
want the content flow to work. This direction is extremely helpful in guiding 
your team through the content development process. Also, remember to act 
with your audience in mind and make sure that you’re not posting the same 
exact content on all channels or platforms (if that’s what you’re doing, then it’s 
definitely easier to keep it all to a single channel!). People use the platforms 
differently, and, as a good community manager, you need to be able to tap into 
these differences to help build the brand.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t post the same content on all channels. Your audiences will differ, and those that visit 
multiple channels like variety.
Set Up a Content Calendar
Now that you have your plan in order, you need to ascertain the distribution 
and schedule for your content. Remember that tweets, posts, and content 
updates don’t write themselves, so it’s important to factor in time to make 
sure you actually have content to post. It takes more time to write an on-
brand, on-voice Tweet than it might to post to your personal Twitter, so keep 
that in mind as you develop both your strategy and your calendar.
Take your selected platforms and place them on a grid. Even in this age of 
tons of digital media and content, many big companies still build their content 
calendars in Excel or Google Spreadsheets. (See Figure 8-1.)

 Management Strategy

Then, make sure to list the various content themes—for example, an e-commerce 
company might want to take note of holidays such as Mother’s Day, Valentine’s 
Day, Black Friday, and Christmas, whereas a company that tracks sports scores 
might be more interested in football season and baseball season. You should 
be able to pull some of these themes from the listening and discovery you 
did in the previous chapter. If you’re going to produce a lot of content, your 
calendar should include a category called Content Theme to help you visual-
ize your content mix of special themes against core brand or product content 
and other special initiatives, contests, or market research initiatives.
Then, separate and list the content topics to ensure you have a diverse mix of 
topics and types to keep things interesting for your community. You can do 
this in advance in your spreadsheet and, then, write the actual posts into your 
content calendar and schedule them with HootSuite or whatever tool you  
use to help schedule your content. Don’t forget that certain types of content  
may do better at different times of the day, so pay attention to how people 
interact with your content, and continue to test it.
Be sure to list applicable hashtags and trending topics, and plan how you can 
tap into emerging ideas as well.
In the sample content calendar template, you’ll see that “Post Category”  
is the main segmentation used in planning content. Use it for tactical differen-
tiation with things like tips, polls, media mentions, open-ended questions, and 
so forth.
As with the strategy, there’s no right way to create a content calendar. However, 
we’ve provided a sample for you in the appendix of this book.
Note the organization and use this to help you plan your content so you don’t 
fall behind in posting and sharing content.

  You can save yourself time in the long run by building your content strategy 
as a brief after your social media listening-and-discovery phase. You can also create it as a tactical 
plan to test your findings and hypotheses on target audience, channel, and content selections. Once 
you’ve determined what works, you can begin to formalize and operationalize it.
Summary
The goal of this chapter has been to walk you through the planning and execu-
tion of a community management strategy. I started by teaching you about 
metrics and encouraging you to set goals. Then, I walked you through how to 
identify where to focus the efforts of your community strategy by selecting 

217

the proper platforms, media and channels. From there, I taught you how to 
build your community strategy, starting with content, which is a fundamental 
cornerstone of any successful community initiative.
In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into creating experiments and testing, 
a process I like to call tactical initiative testing. I will discuss how to properly 
structure an experiment to learn from it, and how to apply these findings to 
future initiatives.

How to Apply Agile Marketing Techniques to 
Community Management Initiatives
Throughout this book, I’ve emphasized the importance of doing research and 
testing to understand your brand, your target audience, and your community.
I’ve explained how to create content in numerous forms. But once you’ve 
come up with the content, it’s time to experiment. And to help, you can count 
on our good friend, the scientific method.
You may remember that we touched on this briefly in Chapter 6. Here, I aim 
to provide more information as to how to perform a social media or commu-
nity experiment using the scientific method as applied to marketing initiatives,

which we’ll refer to from here as the marketing scientific method. I will show 
you how to do the following:
Apply the scientific method to digital marketing
• 
Use the lean and agile methodology in digital marketing
• 
Analyze the data
• 
Let’s get started.
Designing an Experiment
Experiments have seven parts:
1.	 Formulate a problem or question.
2.	 Research for evidence.
3.	 Generate a hypothesis.
4.	 Establish benchmarks.
5.	 Run your experiment.
6.	 Draw conclusions (to validate the hypothesis).
7.	 Share results.
Formulate a Problem
If you’ve had a community strategy for any length of time, you’re always 
striving for better results. Those in tech or startup environments are likely 
chasing the elusive goal of optimization. When you are in the process of 
designing an experiment, focus on one very specific problem at a time.
Let’s start with a simple one as our example: let's say people are engaging with 
your Facebook posts (comments and likes), but they don’t click on them to 
read the actual content.
Exercise: Look at the results of your community listening and discovery and 
identify a social media or community problem that you would like to solve.
Research
Your next step is to gather as much background information as is relevant to 
inform and then plan the experiment. In Chapter 6, we talked about the types 
of research we can use, including primary and secondary. The problem, in 
question form, is this: “Why aren’t our followers reading our content?”

The Community Manager’s Playbook
223
To answer this, you’ll want to gather a variety of data such as statistics about 
the types of content that perform best in your field, information about what 
the people in your community are interested in (which you can extract from 
your work on the exercises in Chapter 7), information about the current 
landscape as it applies to your business, and information on user experience 
for posting links on Facebook. You’ll also want to compile all the data you may 
have from previous research on this subject, such as looking at content that 
has historically received more click-throughs to relevant blogs.
Exercise: Identify the sources of both primary and secondary research that 
can help you gather necessary information to design your experiment and to 
compile the findings from your research.
Generate a Hypothesis
Now that you’ve done some discovery work, it's time to plan your experi-
ment. To generate a hypothesis, you synthesize your research so you can 
decide what you need to test for the biggest impact on resolving the identified 
problem. This means paying close attention to the data to try to find the tac-
tics that might yield results in your unique community. Let’s analyze the items 
that you gathered in your research:
• 
Statistics: By looking at what types of information tra-
ditionally perform best in your field, you’ll have some 
research to support what you should be posting. Again, 
exact audience preferences are always unique to your 
community, but industry or competitor trends can give 
you a general idea of where to start.
• 
Listening and discovery results: What are people actually 
talking about? Does your content relate to these issues? 
Is your content pertinent to current trends? If not, you 
may need to rethink the type of content you’re sharing 
within your community.
• 
The current landscape: Is it possible that the problem has 
nothing to do with your content, and something more 
to do with the way your audience is using Facebook? It’s 
possible that the situation is not unique to your business, 
and that people often “like” and comment on posts with-
out taking the time to read them. If so, it might help to 
identify why this is happening. Perhaps the audience isn’t 
as interested in blog content as they once were, or maybe 
they enjoy engaging with one another more through com-
ments and posts than through reading content. Either way, 
the insight should inform your next steps.

Chapter 9 | Designing Community and Social Experiments
224
• 
User experience: It might be the case that your links are 
too long, or that the Facebook widget you use to post 
has formatting problems (which has been a problem in 
the past). A user who has a bad experience may have no 
reason to click. This kind of problem may get even worse 
when your audience checks posts from mobile devices 
rather than a laptop or desktop computer.
In reviewing this data, you should be able to determine why your blogs aren’t 
getting clicks. If there are several possible issues, create a list of the probable 
reasons, and prioritize the order in which you’ll test. Select the strongest 
one that will also be the easiest to test (there’s no sense in testing the dif-
ficult ones if the reason why people aren’t clicking is actually very simple). 
Remember, you should test only one variable at a time.
In the example we’ve been using, let’s assume the hypothesis is that the links 
we drop into Facebook are long and dry, deterring people from clicking. 
Because they are not attractive, it's possible that shorter, snappier links will 
increase click-through rates.
Exercise: Synthesize your research and generate a hypothesis focused on one 
variable to test.
Establish Benchmarks
Benchmarks are essential to planning your experiment. Decide which metrics 
determine success. In our example, it’s pretty simple. We’re not as concerned 
about engagement for each post, because in this particular case we want click-
throughs that generate traffic to the blog. That gives us one item to focus 
on for the experiment (though we may want to monitor engagement as a 
secondary metric).
In community management, we establish benchmarks as a way to determine 
whether our experiment was successful, or whether we need to continue 
testing other hypotheses. Our benchmarks give us a baseline to measure 
against and determine whether we need to spend more time testing a particu-
lar variable, or whether we’re ready to start testing other community tactics 
or initiatives with their own variables.
The easiest way to monitor these benchmarks is to add them to your content 
calendar we discussed in Chapter 8 to help you get a snapshot view of how 
you’re progressing on your goals. To make the best use of the information, 
you need to decide what key facts will help you with your overview. For more-
complicated tests and benchmark tracking, I add the pertinent details to the 
recommendation memo or marketing brief I’m using. Regardless of where you 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
225
choose to store the information, make sure to include dates, key performance 
indicators, actual results, and all other data you need to help measure your 
progress. This should tell you at a glance where you were successful, and 
where you need to repeat your experiment to reach the goals you set.
Exercise: Determine which measures you’ll use to help determine success 
in identifying a hypothesis that correctly highlights the cause of a problem. 
Establish realistic benchmarks based on the data you’ve gathered.
Run Your Experiment
This is the actual “testing” part of the experiment, which you execute based 
on your hypothesis and gather data as you go. If, perhaps, you think the links 
you’re using on your social media platforms are too long, shorten them up. 
Use your original, long link posts as a barometer, and find out whether short-
ening links using Bitly makes a difference in getting people to click through. 
For other tests concerning marketing problems, you may want to try using 
different colors or different types of photographs. In e-commerce, it might be 
as simple as determining whether the expression “half off” is more successful 
than “50% off.” Run the test several times to get a good sample set. You may 
also want to create different permutations of the test. For example: half off vs. 
50% off. Then run the winner of the two against “Save 50%.”
Exercise: Using the variable that you’ve identified as pertinent to your particular 
problem, gather data through testing.
Draw Conclusions
Okay, now we reach the part where you solve the puzzle. You can move into 
reflection mode, using your results to validate whether your hypothesis was 
true or false. In our example, shorter links either did or did not have an impact 
on the number of people who clicked through to the blog. Did the number 
of people who clicked through change? Did it go up or down? Remember, it’s 
best to repeat the experiment a few times in order to make sure you have 
the best results.
If your experiment didn’t support the hypothesis you predicted, it’s time to go 
back to the drawing board and identify a different variable you can manipulate. 
Keep testing!
Exercise: Review the results of your experiment against your benchmarks. Did 
your experiment generate the results you anticipated? What additional tests 
do you think need to be done to optimize your results?

Chapter 9 | Designing Community and Social Experiments
226
Share Results
This is an extremely important aspect of the reflection phase of running an 
experiment, and the one that can have the largest impact on whether your 
team adopts more lean and agile ways of working. Once you’ve completed 
your experiment, make sure you share the results with your team and man-
agement in order to complete the cycle of knowledge transfer. In looking at 
the data you were able to extract from the testing, decide what else you need 
to test. Even if, in the example problem, the test generated more clicks, you 
may want to see if you can continue to optimize and improve performance. 
Perhaps even shorter links have even more impact on the number of people 
clicking through. Even if the test wasn’t successful, share the results of what 
you learned. Brainstorm with the team to decide what other variables are 
worth testing, to determine, for example, whether the type of content being 
posted isn't ideal, the link images aren’t interesting enough, or the blog titles 
need to be improved.
Remember, Edison failed thousands of times in trying to create the lightbulb—
an invention that revolutionized the way we live. However, for him, it was also 
a matter of perspective: he never felt like he’d failed; rather, he said that he 
found 10,000 ways that didn’t work.
In marketing, testing should be a high priority in helping to optimize not only 
your content but also your strategies. So test away!
BUILDING A RECOMMENDATION MEMO 
It's important to know how to convince the right people that experimenting is a good 
idea. Give them a clear view of your thought process and approach. I find that a “reco 
memo,” as I like to call them, is a great way to provide transparency to all stakeholders. 
The top-line memo format also provides a level of comfort and familiarity as it’s easy to 
digest and often used in other business and marketing initiatives.
In the real world, where everyone is pulled in a lot of different directions, people may 
prioritize other things above managing the community. Maybe you know where the 
holes are in your community strategy and have tried to fill the voids, but when your boss 
is worried about whether revenue is enough to sustain the business, it can be hard to 
convince that person to devote any resources (people or money) to experimenting at 
all.
When this happens, it’s really important to have a clear message that addresses the 
potential value of your experiment to the bottom line and organizational goals.
One of the most effective things you can do to garner support is to get your ideas into an 
easy-to-digest slide deck and disseminate to the appropriate parties in your office. You 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
227
can reinforce your document with the “walk and talk” elevator pitch about why testing 
new ideas is a good idea. Or, if absolutely necessary, tell your boss that you are certain 
your plan will be successful. You can always request forgiveness if it isn’t. (Relax—if 
you’ve followed the preceding rules, you won’t have much to worry about on this front.)
Determining how to close the gap between senior-level roles and more junior-level roles 
can be tough, but you need to remember that your role was created for a reason. You 
are the expert (or at least are on your way) within the role you were selected to play 
in the business. If the important testing initiatives that might allow the business to stay 
agile and relevant move slowly through your office, identify the barriers and find ways to 
remove them. You can’t go wrong with being proactive and agile.
Continuous conversation about what needs to be fixed and why it needs to be fixed are 
of great importance, but in many organizations, they don’t happen nearly as often as 
they need to. By suggesting and encouraging testing and experimenting, you can show 
you’re striving to keep the company moving in the direction of innovation—allowing it to 
adapt to the ever-changing environment.
A sample template for an experiment's recommendation memo follows:
Summary: This is an overview of the experiment and how it would be conducted.
Objectives: What, exactly, are you trying to accomplish with this experiment? A 
well-written objective statement should spell out clearly why you want to complete 
an experiment, and how the results of the experiment could positively impact your 
company. If you can’t identify with some degree of precision the reasons for completing 
the experiment, it won’t make a great deal of sense to the person you’re pitching to 
spend time and money on it.
Strategy and Tactics: This outlines how, exactly, you intend to complete the 
experiment. What resources are needed? Who should be involved? The more 
specific you can be here, the better. This section shows how the experiment will 
work, which requires a significant understanding of the process and elements at your 
disposal. Think, for example, of such considerations as messaging and banner ad 
modifications, press relations, technical needs, and process implementation.
Metrics for Success: This will vary depending on the type of experiment you are 
running. A social media experiment will have very different metrics than a landing page 
experiment. However, it is important to establish which metrics are the important ones 
at this stage. For instance, if you are running a paid search campaign, it may not make a 
difference that an uptick in users occurs during the time the ad is running if these come 
from social media and can’t be correlated to paid search efforts. Therefore, if you were 
looking at page views as a measure of success, you might need to go back and refine 
your analytics to make them more accurate. You may also want to look at your traffic 
sources as well as your traffic or user counts.

Chapter 9 | Designing Community and Social Experiments
228
Other Recommendations: This may be optional, depending on the size and 
requirements of your recommendation. If you’re requesting a small experiment, this area 
may not be needed. However, for much bigger experiments, it is important to use this 
area to cover your bases. If your experiment requires feedback from fans and followers, 
you may want to institute quality assurance to guard against hostile participants. Or you 
might wish to implement a designated team to respond to the influx of site traffic you 
expect to receive. The possibilities are endless and are specific to your experiment, so 
if you’re running a big experiment, be sure to cover all your bases.
Budget: How much will this cost? Be sure to take into consideration the number of 
work hours as well as costs such as paid placements, hiring extra support staff, and 
design needs.
Next Steps: What, exactly, needs to happen to get the experiment off the ground? This 
involves items such as approval from leadership, logistical planning, and timelines.
Depending on the size and type of experiment, you may wish to include more-detailed 
sections for schedules, creative needs, and logistics.
Here is an example recommendation memo:
Summary: Our client is an eco-friendly fashion brand that wants to see if changes to 
the website user experience will affect community engagement on its message boards. 
Therefore, we propose an A/B test to determine whether different website layouts affect 
the level of engagement. Historically, our company’s best customers are those who are 
actively engaged on a message board, so we hypothesize that encouraging even more 
people to sign up for the message boards will result in additional conversions.
Objectives: Determine whether different landing page layouts encourage higher 
click-through to the home page and encourage more engagement on our brand’s 
message boards.
Strategy and Tactics: The long-term strategic objective of this experiment is to 
create more long-term, engaged relationships with our fans while also eliciting feedback 
about our products and what our fans would like to see us doing in the eco-space.
To that end, we will develop a new landing page. A, the control page, is our current 
page, while B, our variable, contains specific call-to-action messaging highlighting the 
message board and encouraging site visitors to sign up. Pages should be mostly similar 
and contain the same content, other than the highlighted messaging to encourage users 
to sign up for the message board.
If the change proves to be successful, we will test and iterate to optimize message 
board signups.

The Agile Marketing Process
As I mentioned earlier, much of my own business revolves around the concept 
of lean and agile methodology. The two processes are similar and comple-
mentary, but agile suggests a methodology that’s at the core of execution. It 
focuses on an iterative and responsive delivery approach that supports high 
customer satisfaction. Lean suggests doing a project in a leaner or pared-down 
way by removing waste and building simple quality controls. (Think of lean like 
lean ground beef, which has all the beef but less fat.)
Both processes are based on the idea that companies can achieve the best 
results through an ongoing learning loop, like the one we reviewed in detail 
in Chapter 4. This learning and application of what we learn describes how 
a company can quickly and effectively achieve real results that are rich in 
customer and market insights.
Many older, more traditional businesses are locked in their ways, determined 
to make every initiative go through high-level approvals before getting any-
thing done. This is necessary for some aspects of business, but it’s my belief 
that we can put some of the control into the hands of our employees and 
allow them the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them. This is where 
the Perks slogan—“Think like a Brand. Act like a Startup.”—comes into play.
Rather than doing heavy research and putting major projects on hold during 
the research phase, we instead aim to iterate ideas based on analysis of cus-
tomer feedback. We do this by emphasizing speed and responsiveness, instead 
of absolute perfection and long planning cycles that tend to stifle achievement 
of business goals given today's business velocity.
Lean and agile processes serve to do the following:
Allow for iterative improvement of strategies
• 
Increase efficiencies and learning
• 
Incorporate customer and market validation
• 
Assess and optimize investments
• 
As such, they offer businesses several benefits:
• 
Increased responsiveness: Being iterative allows individuals 
and organizations to adapt and make decisions along the 
way based on real-time customer feedback.
• 
Improved speed to market: Focusing on a specific problem 
and developing a solution to address it allows CMs and 
collaborators to get their message or product to market 
quickly.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
231
• 
Reduced risk: A structured, iterative approach with 
established benchmarks and metrics allows companies 
to manage and monitor its activities and level of invest-
ment. Also, it provides the opportunity to reallocate 
investments.  
In our commitment to leverage lean and agile methodology, we’ve learned 
how to design a specific way to integrate this methodology into the problem-
solving process:
1.	 Define the problem, the specific pain points, and the reasoning 
around the problem. The process of identifying a prob-
lem that needs to be solved isn’t so different from the 
marketing scientific method we explained earlier in this 
chapter. Here, we also get specific about the pain points, 
and think about ways in which the problem affects our 
customers throughout the customer experience.
2.	 Develop solutions that address the problem. Solutions to a 
problem with the customer experience may come from 
more than one direction. Work with the various teams 
to figure out ways to alleviate the pain point. This may 
mean working with customer service teams, designers, 
developers, marketers, business and finance teams, and 
more in order to develop potential solutions to resolve 
the issues. Don’t forget, customer experience is the result 
of interdisciplinary efforts.
3.	 Prototype and iterate solutions via collaboration and co-creation 
with customers or other stakeholders. The wealth of ideas 
that come from collaboration can help guide you to the 
best, most cost-effective ideas for your business. Often, 
you can also rely on your customers or community to 
help you work through your prototypes and iterations by 
seeking their feedback. Your community is there because 
they want to be in touch with your business, and with 
one another. They provide a valuable resource if you can 
leverage that opportunity.
4.	 Validate with customers to ensure you have something worth 
pursuing. Even after you’ve collaborated internally and 
worked with your customers to help build your solution, 
you still need to validate it. The goal here is to make sure 
your solution works for them before you invest more 
money and resources into a project that ultimately might 
not resolve the issue, or inadvertently creates more 
problems. 

Chapter 9 | Designing Community and Social Experiments
232
The Lean Scientific Method: Testing and Iterating
Once you’ve gone through all the steps of the lean, agile marketing process, it’s 
time to do it all again. In executing lean marketing for existing initiatives, the 
goal is to optimize performance data in order to improve. This means testing 
and optimizing constantly to help you achieve the results that will help grow 
and sustain your business.
PRO TIP: “SOCIALIZE” THE SOLUTION
If you are encountering a problem in community management, keep in mind that the 
onus isn’t on you to solve it alone (even if the core of the problem does fall under 
your job description). People from all backgrounds have a valuable place in community 
management, including product teams, developers, editorial staff, social media experts, 
and customer service teams.
As you begin to understand and practice the core tenets of lean and agile methodology, 
you learn to give ideas some oxygen. It never really matters whose idea it is within 
a team, especially if you have a brilliant idea but don’t have the means to execute 
it. Socializing ideas helps people understand the problem more thoroughly, and also 
helps them want to contribute to it in a positive way, which makes them more invested 
in resolution.
When things really get messy, you might find yourself in a difficult post-mortem where the 
question becomes “What do we do?” or “What should we have done differently?” These 
“Oh Shit” meetings (pardon my French) can be an excellent catalyst for solving other 
problems, but often happen too late.
A/B Testing
A/B testing is a form of testing used in marketing and advertising that uses ran-
domized experiments with variants (A or B), which contain a control sample 
and a variable you want to test. As a community manager, you’ll come to rely 
on A/B tests, as they’re great for segregating a single variable so you can see 
how audiences react differently to changes. This section shows how to use 
A/B tests to improve and optimize your results.
Testing Ads
Think about the many variables you can test in an ad. If you don’t have much 
experience with paid media, pull up Facebook on your computer right now 
and look at the ads. You can test a number of things.
Copy: Look at the words being used to sell the product. Notice words like 
“Best” as opposed to “Good,” and words like “Deal” as opposed to “Bargain.” 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
233
Also, notice whether the words in the ad are all capitalized. Some people report 
that simply capitalizing every word can make a difference in ad reception.
Call to action: What words do they use to make someone take action? Maybe 
it’s “Click Here,” but it could also be “Act Now” or “Act Fast.” Each has a dif-
ferent implication, and audiences may respond differently to each.
Images: If your photo isn’t generating the results you want, try again using a 
different color or a different image entirely. Keep making changes until you’re 
able to optimize your imagery.
Targeting: Facebook ads allow marketers to target a particular audience based 
on demographics, location, interests, and a host of other factors. If you’re not 
seeing success with ads that cover a large space, try hyper-local ones to see if 
they generate better results (or vice versa).
Ad placement: If the ad isn’t working well for you on Facebook, why not try 
running the same ad on Google to determine whether that placement gener-
ates stronger results?
Ad destination (landing page): Many people make the mistake of driving people 
to their home pages, rather than directing them to the page of the event 
they’re promoting or the product they’re selling. In most cases, specificity will 
be best here, but it never hurts to test.
Bids: If you’re not seeing the results you’d like with ad space, you could try 
changing your bid. If you are seeing some results, it may make sense to bid 
higher on a particular campaign to see if it improves your results even more.
Testing Your Home Page
Sometimes a great ad generates all the clicks you need, but the home page 
they are redirected to isn’t creating the same effect. Think about your busi-
ness’s web page. You can test and improve numerous elements in order to 
create the best user experience. Let's look at a few.
Button shapes: This detail may seem insignificant, but, if optimized, can create 
a significant difference. Perhaps small buttons aren’t drawing people because 
the audience can’t see them as clearly. Making them bigger may help people 
navigate the site easier. Or, if they’re too big, these may make the page look 
cluttered.
Text: Try incorporating more or less copy on the page to see if that makes a 
difference.
Color: Perhaps your page’s color scheme is making it difficult for anything to 
stand out. Try experimenting with a different color palette to see whether it 
makes an impact.

Email collection box or lead generation: If the collection box is not prominent, 
you may be missing out on opportunities for people to log on to your site. 
However, if your email collection box is obtrusive, it may prevent people from 
wanting to subscribe.
Check-out process: If your e-commerce website check-out page has a lot of 
friction—things that make check out difficult for one reason or another—
your customers are bound to notice. Focus on testing ways to eliminate this 
friction.
Site or product photography: If your photos aren’t clear and crisp, this may be 
deterring customers. Specifically, bad photography may cheapen the brand 
experience. Try incorporating different or higher-quality photos to see if they 
increase users’ time on the site. 
Testing Email Marketing
When it comes to email marketing, there are so many variables to test that 
entire industries and platforms are dedicated to narrowing down these vari-
ables and iterating on a continual basis. When it comes to testing email, you 
have many choices.
Subject lines:  Track these against open rates to see which types of line copy 
and lengths are the most effective.
Call to action:  You can experiment with different things to request from people, 
as sometimes requests that are too obtrusive can be detrimental to your 
strategy.
Format: If your email templates use devices such as bullet points as opposed to 
paragraphs, try experimenting to see if one works better than the other.
Hook: If you’re leading with a question, it may be more effective to lead with a 
bold statement. You won’t know unless you experiment, which will give you 
insight into your audience’s preferences.
Length of message: I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen emails perform far 
better simply because the author shortened the amount of text it contained. 
It’s important to remember that people these days aren’t always on their 
computers when checking their email; a lot of the time people go over their 
inbox through their phones or tablets, so something that seems short on a 
desktop computer may seem much more cluttered on an iPhone.
Timing: Because of an audience's busy schedules and variety of responsibili-
ties, it’s important to consider the best times of day to send emails, as well of 
the day of the week. Try A/B testing the time of day you send emails to see 
what times provide the best results. Then test the day of the week; does your 
audience prefer weekdays to weekends? Or vice versa? This provides great 
context for time of day.

Color: Psychologists know the power of choosing the right colors, but marketers 
can learn as well through A/B testing. Try different color schemes to elicit dif-
ferent results, and see which are optimal for you.
Images: Big, bold, powerful images can provide more impact than lighter ones, 
but they also take time to download, depending on the types of devices your 
customers use to access the Internet. Think carefully about these items as 
you A/B test imagery in emails.
Customized links: Sometimes shorter or customized links can work better, as long, 
messy links can be a distraction to people. Try experimenting with different 
types of links to determine whether they affect the number of click-throughs.
Offer/deal/promo: Does 50% work better than “Buy One, Get One Free?” A/B 
testing the deals in your email validate that you’re advertising the right types 
of promotions to your customers.
Testing Social Media
You can also conduct testing by using your brand’s social media. You have 
some valuable things to test.
Hashtags: Test whether incorporating trending hashtags into your tweets 
makes a difference in their visibility. You might be surprised to find that incor-
porating the right hashtags can have a significant impact on your reach, as 
people are often compelled to seek out trending topics.
Time of day: Many people find that tweeting at certain times of day generates 
better results. Try to determine what times work best for your business, and 
send your most compelling tweets during that time.
Tags:  Tagging individuals can increase your reach as people interact and engage 
with you.
This is an overview of just some of the things you can test. If you run a com-
munity platform, you can test the functionality of your platform, as well as 
items like moderator input, community announcements, and so much more.
How Long Do You Test?
In running a test, you can review results over long periods, but you may want 
to see them over the course of an hour. You can test hour-over-hour, day-
over-day, week-over-week, year-over-year, or in any increments you prefer. 
Many people like the consistent time blocks to see how they’re doing. In per-
forming annual testing, don’t forget to incorporate changes such as Christmas 
falling on different days of the week each year. Try to figure out the best and 
most accurate comparison, and focus your tests on that. Be sure to look at 
comparisons with comparable timeframes.

Chapter 9 | Designing Community and Social Experiments

Testing Tools
You can use various tools to test, but let’s cover some of the most useful ones 
to start:
• 
Google Analytics: This free analytics program contains  
features to help you track website traffic.
• 
Optimizely: This site allows you to run A/B tests on your 
website without requiring you to make changes to the 
entire site.
• 
Adobe Target: Part of the Adobe cloud, this tool allows the 
user to tailor and personalize customer experiences to 
maximize revenue through A/B testing, automated per-
sonalization, and multivariate testing.
• 
KISSmetrics: This tool works with Google Analytics to give 
you data about the people who are engaging with your 
site. It can tie the steps in the process back to individual 
people and can tell you how users are engaging across 
devices.
• 
Yesware: Billing itself as an email marketing tool for sales-
people, Yesware helps track emails and allows customiza-
tion based on what you learn.
• 
MailChimp: With built-in analytics tools and A/B testing 
capabilities, MailChimp is a great way to help optimize 
your email marketing strategy.
• 
Unbounce: Unbounce enables the user to test landing 
pages for optimal results.
• 
Bitly: Bitly allows you to track engagement with hyper-
links. By turning any link into a Bitly link and then sharing 
it on social media, Bitly tells you how many people are 
clicking, and how they’re engaging.
Tip
■
■
  Run an A/B test using Facebook ads. If you’ve never experimented with Facebook ads, log 
on to Facebook and see how to create and structure them. You can create a Facebook ad for as little 
as $10 (in some cases, even cheaper), and in many cases even small amounts capture significant 
numbers of impressions and clicks. Using the marketing scientific method outlined previously, run two 
ads that are identical except for one variable. Compare results, share your findings with your team, 
and decide which test to run next.

Using Community for Customer Validation
I’ve given you various tools to conduct testing in the digital space. But you 
can also leverage your community to get information about your proposed 
changes and concepts. Even with all the digital technology in the world, some-
times nothing is as good as reaching out to the members of your community 
for their feedback.
Some of the ways you might do this is through survey data, focus groups, lis-
tening and discovery (as discussed in Chapter 7), and opinions of early adopters.  
Activities like focus groups and one-on-one interviews can be helpful in  
getting great qualitative information from the people who are most valuable 
to your community. 
Analytics Review
We’ve talked about how to review and digest your results, but one topic we 
haven’t touched on in much detail is analytics. Analytics are tools designed to 
help you understand your data. The results may be as simple as telling you 
the number of people who clicked your link, but they can also detail the times 
that people clicked, how they found your site, and all kinds of other driving 
factors.
Reviewing your analytics can help you figure out whether your experiment 
was a success. It’s important to know which key performance indicators to 
measure, and once you have those nailed down, you can come up with some 
very interesting information about your brand.
If you’re using social media listening tools, you’ve probably worked with social 
media analytics at some point. Even tools such as Bitly, Klout, LinkedIn, and 
Facebook have analytic information you can tap into to determine whether 
your experiment was a success.
In this era, the collection of analytic data is easy because of the automation 
that digital interaction provides. This is why Google Analytics can update in 
real time to tell you the number of people who are visiting your page at any 
given moment —a feat that would have been nearly impossible had you ever 
tried to run a similar experiment using print newspapers or magazines.
Usually placed under the umbrella of “marketing,” analytics are a massive area 
of study, making it impossible to cover them in depth in this book. People 
who decide specifically to study analytics can learn how to work with data to 
discover powerful insights. However, numerous online resources also teach 
viewers the technical aspects of understanding and using analytics software.

Analytics Academy to learn more about the analytics that affect your website. 
Understanding Google Analytics can be useful because it sets the framework 
for all the other analytics programs you’ll encounter. 
Summary
In this chapter you learned about the importance of experimentation, using the 
scientific method to design an experiment, and using lean and agile methods  
to market. Whew! Let’s continue in a serious vein by taking a look at tracking 
and measuring performance.

Performance 
Tracking and 
Measurement
Now that you know how to test, it’s time to put that testing into action. If you 
did the exercises in the previous chapter, you have already completed a single 
experiment. That experiment will provide a foundation for some of the things 
you’ll be learning in this chapter.
A single experiment is helpful, but it won’t really tell you much about your 
business until you’ve had time to iterate. We’ve talked about iteration already—
it’s the process of repeated testing to achieve optimal results. An environ-
ment of continuous testing allows you to refine your approach and maximize 
outcomes.
Testing strategies should be based on clearly defined metrics that you can 
defend. In order to create actionable plans based on your results, performance 
tracking and reporting are key. The goal is to build a discovery and validation 
loop that allows you to make improvements that align with business goals.
Once you gather data from testing, what do you do with it? In this chapter, 
I’ll give you a few ideas for data analysis and strategy refinement based on the 
results of your test.

Identifying Goals and Metrics
Remember when we talked about key performance indicators (KPIs)? It’s great 
to know that you have an uptick in time on your site or more Facebook 
likes today than yesterday, but it doesn’t do much good when you don’t know 
what to tie that data back to. The process here is twofold:
1.	 Figure out what you’re trying to accomplish. This means look-
ing at the pain points or areas for improvement and iden-
tifying exactly what would need to happen for you to 
resolve the problem.
2.	 Determine how to measure the data that’s relevant to what 
you’re trying to accomplish. Often this won’t just be one 
metric but a variety of metrics to compare with one 
another.
Let’s say you have an increase in new visitors to your site but a decrease in 
the number of page views—that is, fewer users clicking through to the differ-
ent pages of the site. This divergence could indicate that the additional people 
who were directed to your site left quickly when they realized it wasn’t of 
interest to them—meaning your advertising or other traffic drivers might be 
the real problem.
It’s important to have some understanding of user behavior in order to influ-
ence your users through testing and iteration. Look at where people are 
interacting already and how they interact with one another. The metrics you 
use to gauge success should take these behaviors into account and serve as 
an attempt to capture this behavior. Otherwise, you’re at risk of spending sig-
nificant time and resources tracking analytics that don’t make sense (or even 
matter) for your brand.
Good data can tell us all types of things. It allows a community manager to 
respond properly to vocal minorities, allocate time properly in terms of com-
munity priorities, and help deal with unseen problems.
A CONSULTATIVE APPROACH TO ANALYTICS: DATA 
CAPTURE—DATA REPORTING—DATA ANALYSIS
To properly track analytics, I recommend a three-pronged approach made popular 
by Avinash Kaushik (www.kaushik.net). Using this approach, you can make sure 
that you have clear and uncontaminated data, which you can use to make informed 
decisions about the future of the brand. Let’s look at each prong.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
241
Data capture: Even before the days of community in the digital space, people could 
still capture data for marketing purposes by physically counting and tallying items or 
determining, for example, the number of people who tried free samples at a local grocery 
store. Today an abundance of digital tracking software makes it much easier for people 
to capture data. Unfortunately, often these tools are not set up or calibrated correctly, 
which can lead to inaccurate data. This is problematic in that it presents skewed data, 
which can lead to ill-informed decisions about the brand. Take your time, therefore, to 
set up your tools properly. Accurate data is an extremely important part of the three-
pronged framework.
Data reporting: It’s not enough to capture data if you can’t present and articulate it. 
Reporting is the process of collecting this information and presenting it in some type of 
tangible form. Many digital tools do this part electronically, but the onus is on the user 
to ensure accurate reporting of that data to the rest of the team. Most major companies 
rely on a reporting template based on the type of company and types of reporting 
requested.
Data analysis: Simply reporting basic results doesn’t help you capture the true value of 
the information. Data analysis enables developing conclusions and inferences from the 
data and making recommendations as to how best to move forward. The analysis also 
helps you better understand the following:
What you should measure
• 
What the data seems to be saying
• 
What you should do based on what the data is saying
• 
Metrics to Track: It Depends
What specifically should you look at? What makes the most sense for your 
situation? Everyone needs different information. What follows are some 
foundational ideas to help you formulate the KPIs that make the most sense  
for you.
Let’s review the distinction between quantitative data and qualitative data drawn 
in Chapter 8. Quantitative data has an explicit numerical component, such 
“200 page views.” Qualitative data can be observed but not quantified, such as 
insights gleaned through text, language, or sentiment analysis.
It’s also important to understand the distinction between conversion metrics 
and awareness metrics. When a community manager acts in a way intended to 
produce a specific outcome, measuring the ratio of the manager’s actions to 
the desired results generates a conversion metric. When the action doesn’t 
necessarily trigger an action but helps lead people to recognize your brand, 
that success is measured by an awareness metric.

Chapter 10 | Performance Tracking and Measurement
242
Conversion metrics include the following:
Number of email opens
• 
Number of email sign-ups
• 
Number of purchases attributable to a single post
• 
Awareness metrics include the following:
Number of people who saw your tweet
• 
Number of shares, retweets, or repins
• 
When thinking about metrics, it is important to keep in mind our framework 
from Chapter 4:
Customer
• 
Brand
• 
Strategy/operations
• 
Products/services
• 
Marketing/communications
• 
Culture/talent
• 
Ask yourself: What are the business goals associated with each of these areas? 
Have you established KPIs for each of them? Which metrics will you use for 
each one? Will your data be qualitative or quantitative? Let’s look at a simple 
example of how this might work for part of one of these categories—talent.
Say your business goals are to increase awareness among your talent pool and 
increase high-quality applications. The KPI might be the number of applica-
tions for each position or the number of positive workplace reviews.
Metrics might include application downloads, application/resume submissions, 
and community comments, tweets, reviews, and mentions. Broken down, it 
might look something like this:
Quantitative data
• 
Number of downloads
• 
Number of submissions
• 
Number of comments, tweets, reviews, and 
• 
mentions

The Community Manager’s Playbook
243
Qualitative data
• 
Whether the submissions are by candidates you 
• 
judge to be of “high quality”
Whether the comments, tweets, reviews, and 
• 
mentions are positive or negative
What kind of language was used to describe us as 
• 
an employer
These are merely suggestive, but do you see how it works? Try it for your own 
brand with each of these categories as well as others you deem appropriate.
Measuring Community Performance
Now that we’ve reviewed how to measure the impact that the community has 
on specific business goals and initiatives, let’s take a step back. From a broader 
perspective, the success of a community endeavor is dependent on the vital-
ity of that community. Vitality in community interactions can be measured by 
looking at three primary criteria: activity, health, and value. By carefully moni-
toring these areas, a community manager can get a full picture of where the 
community is succeeding and failing in supporting bigger business goals of the 
brand. It’s easy to be happy that a tweet went viral, but if that success can’t 
be tied back to a business goal, it doesn’t do an awful lot of good for your 
business.
Let’s start by explaining what we mean by activity, health, and value:
• 
Activity: This is the virality of an interaction. The k-factor 
or viral coefficient may describe the growth rate of a cus-
tomer base, an app distribution, or a virus. In marketing 
terms, the formula for the k-factor is simply the product 
of i and c,
k = ic ,
where i is the number of invites or shares sent out by each 
new customer and c is the conversion rate (that is, the 
percentage of invites that convert to new customers).
• 
Health: The health of community interaction is reflected in 
two key metrics: awareness and scale. Awareness watches 
likes, mentions, shares, fans, retweets, and follows, as well 
as brand penetration (the numbers of brand mentions and 
industry conversations). Scale compares attrition against 
retention and growth rates over time, as well as the shar-
ing rate, also known as amplification.

Chapter 10 | Performance Tracking and Measurement
244
• 
Value: The value of an engagement or community strategy 
is specific to the business or brand value measurement 
formulas already in place. We typically look at these in 
terms of profitability and acquisition. With respect to 
profitability, we’re looking at items such as the number of 
leads based on community management efforts relative 
to the total number of leads in a designated time frame, 
or the number of sales via community management as 
compared to the total number of leads. With respect 
to acquisition, we’re looking at the steps of the process 
as they relate to the conversion funnel and determin-
ing the value as it relates leads to more customers or 
purchasers.
Diagnosing Your Community 
Looking at the community in terms of activity, health, and value helps you 
identify opportunities within the space to reach out to your most active users. 
Mapping community metrics to each category allows you to identify the best 
channels for growth and to optimize each of your community activities.
Health is a particularly important area to monitor. A deep look into commu-
nity health that focuses on growth (based on the numbers of active contribu-
tors in a certain time frame), for example, can allow you to better understand 
the full conversion funnel as a person moves from being a site visitor, to being 
a member, to being an active participant.
It’s also important to measure and understand the types of activities that are 
happening in your community. What do the engagements look like, and how 
are they being amplified? Who is amplifying these messages? Looking at this 
can help you develop insights about strategic directions for your brand, such 
as helping you identify niches to go after.
And, of course, the quality of these interactions is incredibly important. If your 
site is overrun by trolls who are creating an unstable confrontational environ-
ment, those interactions might not be a good thing for your brand!
Regularly diagnosing community health allows you to nurture and manage the 
growth of your community.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
245
Validating Community: Articulating the Value
It must be important to be active on social media. If it weren’t, why would all 
of the big companies spend so much time and money emphasizing community 
engagement? Sure, one can intuit that interacting with community members 
on social media has some inherent value—but it really helps to have data to 
back that up!
Numerical analytic data is one way of backing up hypotheses and intuitions. 
Much as a scientist needs to be able to show that a new vaccine results in 
fewer people getting sick, community managers need to be able to show some 
value for their efforts.
But these efforts might not be as obvious as the results of other marketing 
efforts. For instance, if you distribute 100 flyers around town for your pizza 
restaurant, and the flyers offer free breadsticks for every person who presents 
a flyer at the restaurant, you can measure the number of free breadstick offers 
you served. However, with community management, the relationship between 
a shared post, for example, and an actual purchase may be a bit more attenu-
ated. In many cases, you won’t be able to attribute a sale to a direct interaction 
with a community member.
Instead, you need to look at other metrics to help measure success in the 
space. We talked above about what some of these metrics might be, but now 
we’re talking about how to use them to determine the success of an effort.
First of all, think about which stakeholders are most heavily invested in a par-
ticular outcome. At the core of their jobs, all stakeholders need to be able 
to justify the use of company funds to support a community effort. But, even 
beyond that, there are other needs. For example, the stakeholders need to 
know where the business is succeeding and how to replicate that success. So 
if your brand is featured in a popular video that “goes viral,” your CEO and 
sales teams want to know whether that’s driving business back to your site. 
Your marketing team wants to know what people liked about the video, so 
it can replicate those efforts and perhaps use them to reach new audiences. 
Even internally, people who work for the business in seemingly unrelated 
spaces such as IT or user experience want to know about the success of 
these efforts, because it heightens the value of the brand. This all points back 
to what I said about designing experiments that will result in clear outcomes 
and results—and sharing the results.
Even if you don’t need to know exactly how much money you’re making 
from your social media efforts on a given day, knowing that the community is 
not pleased that a popular product is being discontinued provides informa-
tion that has a direct impact on the business goals of the brand. Thanks to 
the transparency and access of social media and the connectivity enabled by 

Chapter 10 | Performance Tracking and Measurement
246
always-on technology, the community and its ability to enable many-to-many 
interactions can create even more value for a brand and business than just 
transactions.
In addition, a robust community can help answer some of the biggest  
challenges and questions facing businesses today:
How do I understand my customers? (CM can be a 
• 
replacement for focus groups and customer interviews.)
How can I fold those insights into the business?
• 
How do I keep up with the rate of change?
• 
Whether you get the answers to these questions right can have a huge finan-
cial impact on the brand, even when those answers cannot be directly tied to 
ROI.
One additional thing to remember is that we do not measure to manipulate 
the metrics, to tell the story we want to tell, or to showcase our work. We 
don’t use metrics to tell our bosses what they want to hear. We measure to 
know whether we are adding business value through our efforts.

  Never forget that you use metrics ultimately for one thing—to tell you whether your 
efforts are adding value to the business.
Finding ROI for Community: The Ever-Elusive 
Answer
Because CM is such a new and ever-changing field, longtime traditional mar-
keters don’t always have a clear understanding of how community helps sus-
tain business. One of the greatest challenges can be finding a way to attach 
ROI to the various facets of community management.
The television industry has this same problem. Today in the era of DVR, Hulu, 
Netflix, and other methods of digital content viewing, no one knows how 
many viewers actually see a commercial (even though the budgets for those 
commercials seem to be getting a lot bigger). In the same manner, a com-
munity manager might not be able to demonstrate exactly how many people 
saw a post. The question of exact ROI for television commercials doesn’t 
get as much attention as the question of community ROI, but it’s essentially 
a different version of the same problem. However, in this digital era in which 
everybody expects lightning-fast responses, it’s no surprise that business own-
ers want to know the ROI in social media and community before committing 
thousands of dollars to it.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
247
Similarly, it can be difficult to tell whether community behaviors that increase 
conversions are causal or simply correlated. You can certainly make some 
educated guesses, but because not every click leads to a conversion and not 
every conversion comes from a community engagement, proving the connec-
tion between the two can be difficult.
While ROI can be elusive, looking at metrics that establish community health, 
for example, can determine the value of the community to the brand. As we 
discussed earlier, community health looks at the engagement and contributions 
of community members over time. This concept1 encompasses a historic life-
time and potential lifetime value of a customer as well as that customer’s social 
reach and influence. Why does this matter? It gives us a look into the “dark 
matter,” or the more intangible aspects, of a customer’s value to the company. 
It is not just the money they spend but the things they say about the company 
publicly, how they choose to interact with the brand, and the size and strength 
of their network that indicates their value to the brand.
This is only one way of understanding the true value of community to your 
business, but it represents a solid starting point. A customer’s value to the 
brand is not limited to individual impact on the bottom line but extends to 
the way that person speaks about your brand in their circles of social influ-
ence. A single fan can lead to thousands of new fans overnight. This is why we 
shouldn’t always constrain our social media ROI to hard numbers. Our goal 
is to think about the entire customer journey and all the touch points where 
they are exposed to our brand. In some cases, a person contemplating a pur-
chase will reach a decision after reviewing discussions, comments, shares, and 
tweets generated by the community—all without ever directly engaging with 
your brand. They rely solely on the influence of others to help guide them to 
the purchase. This may make the person’s exposure to your brand incredibly 
hard to track and therefore difficult to quantify.
Even with all the evidence I’ve shown you so far about how community can 
help grow your business and your brand, some people out there still will resist 
the change. Fortunately, I’ve seen people who have questioned the value of 
community garner thousands of dollars in conversions after making relatively 
small investments in it.

If you are having trouble convincing your team or your boss to invest in com-
munity, you can use metrics to show the value of your community, but they 
will be unique to your business and situation. As you did in your exercises in 
the last chapter, identify the pain points and explain what your community 
is lacking and where it needs assistance. Use the results of the tests you’ve 
conducted to advocate for the implementation of a stronger community 
strategy.
Your best advocates are the community members themselves. Use surveys to 
get information that will show your company’s executive team that the brand 
isn’t doing everything it can for its community. It’s easy for brands to lose sight 
of the customer, because they get bogged down in the day-to-day operational 
grind, the product platforms, ROI, or any number of other things that lead 
them to ignore the value of community.
Additionally, you’re reading this book because you already understand that 
there’s some inherent value to community. Maybe you’ve witnessed it or are 
even part of an active, engaged community yourself. Many people who come 
from traditional marketing and business backgrounds don’t understand the 
value of community because it wasn’t something they were ever taught. It’s 
important to remember that community management as a field is still only in 
its infancy, but the need for an active, vibrant community is growing at a rapid 
rate. If understanding online community management is a conversation at the 
company you work for, then, as someone who is at least to some degree 
invested in digital technology, be the person who starts internal conversations 
about what it means to put the customer at the center and how community 
plays a major role in developing the customer’s relationship with the brand.
Unfortunately, it is naive to expect that simply discussing conversions, ampli-
fication, and similar metrics will bring confidence to the stakeholders. Instead, 
try to pinpoint the economic value, which is the sum of the short- and long-
term revenue and cost savings.
Metrics and community management performance tracking were in their 
infancy when I started in community management. If I could prove the value 
of community back in 2004, then with all the tracking tools you have now, you 
can, too!
Using Your Findings
If you’ve tested correctly, you should have some useful and usable informa-
tion. Even if your results indicate no change, the absence of a trend is itself an 
informative result.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
249
The most important step you can take in understanding your findings is to 
make an effort to track them over time. As you are constantly testing and 
iterating, you should ideally see substantial improvement in your metrics over 
time. If you’re not seeing this, it’s important to know what’s going wrong. It 
could be a mismatch between the customer and the target audience, or it 
could simply be that your product itself needs improvement. This is another 
reason why it’s important to perform social media listening studies on a regu-
lar basis, so that you don’t lose sight of what it is that your customers really 
want.
At the very least, most companies should review findings on a quarterly basis. 
Many do it on a monthly basis, and some even do it on a week-to-week basis. 
When marketers have launched a campaign and want to see how it’s pro-
gressing, it becomes more important to review findings every week or, in the 
case of one-day events, from day to day. How often you need to review these 
findings will also depend on the size of the company and the KPIs you’ve set 
out to track.
In assessing your findings, you need to correlate them against marketing initia-
tives (such as campaigns, promotions, sales, or advertising), conversations you 
joined, and engagement with your community. Each of these things can have a 
major bearing on your metrics, but it’s easy to fall into the trap of attributing 
all engagement to, for example, a major ad buy, without taking into consider-
ation the conversation surrounding that advertising.

  Although we may not all be finance people, having at least a baseline knowledge of 
performance metrics can help you greatly when you need to make your case about why it’s important 
to invest in a community strategy.
No Single Indicator Can Tell You Everything 
A single indicator can’t tell you much about how the company is actually doing. 
Many times, people are quick to look at the bottom line without thinking 
much about the longer-term goals. Think of a company like Kodak, which failed 
to follow the world into the digital age with the dawn of the digital camera 
and collapsed on itself because of that. The problem was that for so long it 
was doing well financially, so when people moved on to new technology, the 
business was far behind the times.

Chapter 10 | Performance Tracking and Measurement
250
Companies that are looking only at the bottom line will never see the true 
value of community, because some of the value of community is simply in 
being a company that people want to engage with. This has implications that 
may not be directly tied to the bottom line but that facilitate the numerous 
customer touch points that drive conversions. Or it may be that someone 
who mentions your brand has an impact on others in their communities. This 
helps drive those others to become fans of your brand in a word-of-mouth 
style of marketing that’s difficult to track back to any one interaction.
Individual indicators can tell you important things but can’t necessarily tell you 
everything you need to know. Taken together, a variety of indicators provide 
an ever clearer picture of the overall health of your brand. To truly under-
stand your brand’s health, it’s important to look at multiple factors. It takes 
time—but by carefully tracking your important metrics over time while lis-
tening to the voice of your community, you can find the answers you seek to 
many of your brand problems.
Summary
This chapter has given you a number of frameworks to help you understand 
community management metrics. By capturing, reporting, and analyzing your 
data, you can measure the success of your efforts and share these results to 
help your stakeholders understand the true value of community. Remember, 
the value of community may not be entirely evident in ROI, but if you can 
quantify conversions that are meaningful for your brand, you can demonstrate 
the business value of community.

Top Sites to Grow Your Brand
In Chapter 4, we spent a significant amount of time covering the customer 
journey. As you may remember, we talked about understanding the ways in 
which people interact with your brand before they make a decision. Usually, 
people require several interactions with a brand before committing to investing 
their money into whatever it is that the brand is selling or providing.
For these next sections, it’s important that you consider the journey people 
take to become customers—especially both your primary online and in-person 
customer touch points. You may find that adding one or more of the plat-
forms described here will help you turn a browser into a buyer.
In Chapter 4, we also talked about the digital landscape, and how in many ways 
it is at odds with the traditional landscape. These days, so much engagement is 
done online that I felt it necessary to offer an overview of each of the platforms, 
and examples of user behavior across each.
Understanding User Behaviors Across Platforms
Like communities in the real world, platforms exist to serve basic functions. 
Most are designed with a certain purpose in mind, and then they allow people  
to form subcommunities within those platforms. This is why a brand that 
has its own community, such as a high school athletic team, may also have a 
Facebook group, a Facebook page, and a Twitter account.

Now, let’s talk a little bit about the platforms. This is only a primer, and it 
assumes at least some degree of familiarity with each of the platforms. 
For more information about a platform, go to that platform’s website and 
check the About page.
Facebook
At its core, Facebook is designed to connect people. In this way, it’s a general 
interest site. Chances are, if you’re reading this book, you’ve at least heard of 
Facebook.
Most people are familiar with Facebook’s personal account features, which 
require that users give their true identities, which helps prevent trolling on the 
site. However, Facebook also offers additional features for brands. Brand pages 
allow administrators to monitor organic Facebook interactions, such as the 
number of views on a particular post. It also allows brand pages to separate 
content by tabs, which means brand page administrators can keep various 
types of content housed on a single page. These tabs can be effective in help-
ing them run promotions. Facebook also allows people to start and manage 
user-run groups, which are great for allowing people to stay connected based 
on a common interest.
In encouraging brands to use the site in interactive ways, Facebook’s goal is 
to get these brands to run Facebook ads and promoted posts, which is how 
Facebook makes most of its money. Using Facebook ads and posts, brand 
owners can increase exposure while simultaneously reaching only their target 
demographic based on a series of user-provided criteria, such as relationship 
status, gender, age, and location. Companies can bid on placement for these 
ads and customize them as needed.
Twitter
At its onset, the goal of Twitter seemed to be to simplify Facebook’s “status 
update” feature. Twitter users communicate information using “micro” con-
tent, which the platform limits to 140 characters or fewer. The goal of this was 
to tap into short attention spans and get rid of long, boring posts.
Twitter users can post, retweet, and favorite content, and can use the direct 
messaging feature to communicate information in private to one another. The 
platform makes money through three types of advertising: promoted posts (least 
expensive), promoted Twitter handles (more expensive), and promoted hashtags 
(very expensive). When a brand owner or entity opts to purchase a hashtag, 
that entity can take ownership of the hashtag, and it’s seen by every person who 
logs on to Twitter that day within a defined region (typically, by country). This is 
great for collectively ensuring that communities are tweeting with the proper 
hashtags during a big event such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl.

YouTube
Owned by Google, YouTube is a social media site for video. People can start 
their own channels and can garner massive followings, even creating a trend 
of so-called YouTube celebrities, who often have significant influence in their 
communities. Anyone can upload content to YouTube, but most YouTube 
content will get only a few views. However, on occasion, YouTube videos can 
“go viral,” meaning that these ads have become popular very quickly, and that 
people share these videos of their own volition.
YouTube makes money by playing ads before video content plays. It also has 
relationships with some networks that allow them to host content on YouTube 
but charges users a fee to watch it.
LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social platform for professional networking. Because of its role 
of facilitating business relationships, LinkedIn has a strong revenue model that 
consists of LinkedIn ads, as well as job postings, which is unique to LinkedIn as 
a social networking platform.
Additionally, LinkedIn is unique in that it offers users analytics for the content 
they post, showing not only how many times it was shared, but also how many 
people interacted with that content without necessarily sharing or “liking” 
it. This can be valuable in showing the spheres of influence your content 
reaches.
The site also provides groups and forums for discussing interesting happenings  
within specific professional communities, such as alumni groups and business 
associations.
Pinterest
As a highly visual platform, Pinterest allows people to pin interesting and 
inspiring photographs, and to share them or to keep them private for their 
own use. This comes in handy for creating inspiration boards and outlining 
themes for events such as weddings and home decoration.
Brands can use Pinterest to run contests, such as contests that encourage 
people to curate the most interesting vacation experience in order to win a 
vacation. Pinterest also allows brands to link back to their own pages when 
they pin content, which helps drive people to the site.
Pinterest currently does not have a revenue model in place, but will soon be 
releasing promoted pins, which presumably function similarly to promoted 
posts on Facebook and promoted tweets on Twitter.

Instagram
Instagram is a highly mobile-focused social media platform that allows users 
to take photographs from their smartphones and post them directly to their 
followers. Users can follow their favorite people and brands, and can like or 
comment on those photos. Its most distinct feature is that it allows for instant 
photo editing, which, for example, can make the images appear vintage in 
nature.
Additionally, it allows users to seek inspiration by looking at random users’ 
photographs. People can also send private photos back and forth, a feature 
that was introduced after Snapchat entered the social networking market 
in 2011.
Instagram is a unique social media platform in that it features no direct 
advertising through commercial promotions or sponsorship. However, by 
recognizing that humans are inherently visual beings, it tapped into the social 
space by making it easy for anyone to take photos and share them with 
their networks. Brands can leverage Instagram by sharing behind-the-scenes 
photos, photos of their fans wearing or using their products, and inspira-
tional content like interesting images and quotes. Instagram also has a video 
capability, allowing people to share up to 30 seconds of video shot from a 
smartphone in a given post.
In 2012, Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion.
Tumblr
As a tool that makes it easy to share images, audio, video, and text at a single place, 
Tumblr is one of the nation’s most popular networking sites. Its users tend to 
be young, and many people who use Tumblr have more than one Tumblr site to 
which they post content. Many times, people also create themed Tumblr blogs 
with viral potential—such as the popular “Reasons My Son Is Crying,” where 
people can share funny stories about the trouble their young children cause.
Popular content types on Tumblr include funny gifs and inspiring photographs. 
Tumblr’s popularity is due at least in part to the popularity of these types of 
content, and the ease at which people can reblog and share the content. The 
platform is highly focused on the users and the design.
Businesses can use Tumblr by creating content to share. Nike uses Tumblr to 
reach niche audience segments, such as NikeSB (which caters to the skate-
boarding community) and NikeID (which allows users to customize their 
shoes). This helps facilitate engagement within these niche communities.

Yahoo! acquired Tumblr in 2013. While Tumblr does allow some advertising 
opportunities for brands that want to purchase ad space, Yahoo!’s purchase 
indicates that the company may be trying to find more ways to seamlessly 
integrate advertising into the content platform.
WordPress
As of August 2014, WordPress was the primary blog platform of choice for 
22% of the world’s most popular 10 million websites. As a pioneer in helping 
people’s content become discoverable by creating fields that allow content to 
become easier to find on the Web, the platform secured itself as a leading tool 
in the content development space.
WordPress first entered the market in 2003. While the tool itself contains 
some social features, most people don’t consider it as primarily a social media 
platform. Rather, the tool makes it easy to house and post longer-form con-
tent, which companies can link to from other social media accounts such as 
Facebook and Twitter.
WordPress makes its money from premium subscriptions, which provide  
features such as personalization of the site URL and integration with Facebook 
and Twitter. These features do not come with a free account.
In addition, WordPress sites are highly customizable, to the extent that many 
people who visit sites hosted by WordPress have no idea they’re visiting a 
WordPress site. This is different from Tumblr, which is customizable but seems 
to display similar functionality on every Tumblr site.
Reddit
The Reddit online message board allows people to log on to meet other like-
minded people in any one of thousands of niche topics. People can search to 
discover the “reddits” and “subreddits” that pique their interest, and then can 
contribute to the conversation as much or as little as they’d like. If they see a 
Reddit post they enjoy, they can vote it up, which helps it land at the top of the 
page. Similarly, if they don’t enjoy it, they can “downvote” it with the hope that 
it gets buried. Users can also sort content by tagging it as rising, controversial, 
new content, and other options.
Reddit users are a strong community, and entire subcommunities are built 
around specific topics. Additionally, regular people as well as notable figures 
and celebrities will take part in an “AMA,” which stands for “Ask Me Anything” 
(or sometimes an “AMAA” for “Ask Me Almost Anything”), which helps build 
communities within their audiences.

Chapter 11 | Primary Platforms
256
Reddit makes its money though its self-serve advertising platform, which 
allows brands to build communities around their promotions by giving people 
an immediate opportunity to comment and ask questions.
Snapchat
Snapchat has grown in popularity in recent years. This tool allows people to 
send photos (with written messages or drawings on them), but to make them 
available for only 2 seconds. Snapchat then immediately deletes them. This 
allows people to share silly photos they might not be interested in posting 
publicly. People can share with a single person, or with multiple friends and 
followers at a time.
The user demographic of this tool tends to be younger, with high school and 
college students leading the pack. Brands can use Snapchat to reach their fol-
lowers by posting custom content, which is particularly effective in attracting 
these younger people.
One of the caveats of this app is that because content is available for only  
2 seconds and then immediately deleted, Snapchat has acquired a reputation 
as a “sexting” app (used by people to send nude photographs to one another). 
However, experts counter that smartphones alone have made it easy to share 
photos, so the Snapchat app hasn’t really changed the ways in which youth are 
communicating.
Understanding User Behavior
In learning about the various platforms, it’s also important to remember that 
in many cases, your primary community will be the community you create on 
your own site. Depending on your community strategy, you may be able to 
supplement this with engagement from other social media platforms, but if it 
suits your business model, then you’ll want these users coming back to your 
site to interact and engage with one another.
So, the question becomes, how can CMs influence product development? 
Earlier in the book, I talked about the importance of user experience. Good 
community managers will always have a say in developing the user experience, 
but at the end of the day, the designers may walk away with the feeling that 
they are the experts, and that they don’t need to take the community managers’ 
suggestions seriously.
The goal here is not only to make sure the site is aligned with business goals, 
but also to take into consideration user feedback. A new feature won’t be all 
that helpful if it’s a feature no one wants and that also doesn’t provide any 
business value to the company.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
257
Here are some questions to help you build a foundation:
• 
Do we want to be here? Think carefully about it. For 
instance, a very traditional company may have no reason 
to be on Snapchat.
• 
How do we want to shape our presence? Not all companies 
use Twitter the same way. Some companies make a point 
to talk to and engage with their followers, while others 
use their handles for customer service only. Some have 
multiple Twitter handles to reach different demographics. 
Think about the user behavior of the people who already 
live on the social media platforms you’re considering, and 
figure out how you can integrate yourself in those use 
patterns.
• 
What are we going to do? This means tactically figuring out 
how to best get started in establishing your social media 
presence. It means making sure the brand message is 
consistent across platforms, and taking care to make sure 
you have a plan of action before you try to execute it.
The goal here in producing an optimal user experience is to use the data 
you’ve gathered to determine not only your strategy, content, and tactics, but 
also ways in which you need to differentiate your content across platforms.
Understand User Behavior
Here’s a useful exercise. Choose one of the platforms we discussed earlier in 
this chapter. Then, ask the following:
Who goes to the platform and why?
• 
What do they share?
• 
What does the content look like?
• 
What content are the users creating?
• 
What content are users sharing that other people  
• 
have created?
Once you recognize patterns, you should be able to identify whether this 
platform is a good fit for your business or you should focus your energy 
elsewhere.

Chapter 11 | Primary Platforms
258
Repurpose Content
Once you understand the user experience, the next thing is to understand 
how you can repurpose your content and make it accessible and digestible 
on each of the platforms. Content should not be the same on all platforms. 
It’s important to understand the makeup of something specifically Twitter 
oriented (shorter, though maybe it links to longer content), Facebook oriented 
(longer, typically supplemented by video or photography, and possibly linking 
to other content), and all the other platforms identified previously.
In determining whether a piece of content is a good fit for a specific platform, 
consider audience engagement, content type, objectives, metrics, and analytics. 
You can also use these criteria to help determine how to best repurpose your 
content for other platforms.
Exercise
■
■
  Review the platforms described in this chapter. Choose one that you’ve identified as 
a good fit for your brand. Then, think about which types of campaigns you could offer to leverage 
the power of that platform. For instance, an apparel company may be able to leverage Instagram to 
create a contest for people who take photos of themselves dressed in that company’s clothes. Or a 
company that sells vacation packages may see success with a Pinterest “Pin Your Perfect Vacation” 
pin board contest. The possibilities for using these platforms is almost endless, but be sure you’re 
taking into consideration user behaviors; LinkedIn is probably no place for a hashtag competition.
Summary
Understanding user behavior is one of the most essential ingredients in help-
ing CMs determine where to host their communities and what platforms 
could be a good fit for their audiences. In my teaching at General Assembly, 
I always try to focus on understanding user behavior to determine whether a 
new platform is a good fit for a specific brand’s audience. You now have a tool 
to add to your tool belt, to help your strategy not only now, but also as new 
platforms come down the pike. Next we’ll get into more of the day-to-day 
management of community.

Throughout this book, I’ve given you a lot to think about in terms of 
community management strategy and ways to make the most impact with your 
social media and online listening and discovery. In this chapter, I’ll give you the 
practical knowledge you need to help facilitate those relationships that you’ve 
so carefully and effectively established with your customers and supporters.
Here, the goal is to give you some ideas for initiatives that can help you engage 
with your followers. Additionally, I’ll show you how to make these engage-
ments and relationships scalable, sustainable, and transferable.

Building Relationships: The Golden Rule
When it comes to community relationships, there’s one rule you should never 
forget: It’s all about the users.
It never fails to amaze me how many companies seem to let this extremely 
important rule fall to the wayside. If you’re not putting your users at the cen-
ter of your community, your effort to reach your audience comes across as 
disingenuous. You see this with companies that excessively self-promote, that 
send spam or spam-like messages, and that genuinely don’t seem to care about 
their customers’ issues and complaints. They are too busy talking to the client, 
rather than talking with the client. These types of companies have little chance 
of staying around for long.
At a more nuanced level, it’s easy to get carried away thinking you know what 
your customers want without ever validating that concept, and companies 
lose millions of dollars each year for this very reason. At a community man-
agement level, this translates into bombarding your community members with 
messages that don’t resonate with them.
At its core, the act of engaging customers and responding to their needs is the 
practice of customer management. This differs from customer service in that 
we’re not responding to their complaints, but rather making sure we’re actively 
involved with the customer throughout every step of the customer life cycle. 
We can break this idea of customer management into two subcategories:
1.	 User acquisition: This is the process of acquiring new users. 
Community managers can do this through organic social 
media, paid social media, and strategically placed links on 
website content, as well as television and print ads. Nearly 
everywhere you look these days, people are advertising 
their Facebook and Twitter pages and aiming to entice 
you to follow what they have to say.
2.	 Customer retention: Even when your user acquisition efforts 
lead to a conversion, there’s still plenty left to do. At its 
heart, much of the goal of community management is to 
get people to become purchasers (that is, spend money) 
by increasing the number of customer touch points and 
enticing them to engage with your brand. However, once 
they do convert, community managers then have to con-
vince them to stay engaged. This is because many of these 
customers are the same people who will become repeat 
customers or brand evangelists.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
261
While there is some overlap between the ways we go about working with 
each type of strategy, customer acquisition strategies are usually much 
different from customer retention strategies. Customer acquisition means 
building awareness. Customer retention means engaging with the people who 
have already followed your brand on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media 
outlets, to give them reasons to keep talking about your brand.
In this day and age, the customer life cycle includes a few more stages than 
just customer acquisition and customer retention. At a minimum, this can be 
a five-step process. (See Figure 12-1.)
Figure 12-1.  Customer relationship life cycle
Let’s look at each stage in a bit more detail.
Acquisition: As noted previously, customer acquisition is the process of getting 
new people to use your product or service.
Engagement: Once someone has purchased your product or service, the ques-
tion becomes how to keep that person engaged. The idea here is that focusing 
exclusively on acquiring new customers prevents you from attracting repeat  
customers. Therefore, keeping the conversation flowing with existing customers 
is essential. In an ideal world, not only are the brands engaging with the cus-
tomer, but also the customers are engaging with each other, creating that 
sense of community we all desire.
Retention: In an ideal model, engagement leads to retention. This can be true 
on both the micro scale—for example, as people sign up for a monthly 
subscription service or select the same paper towel brand over and over 
again—or on a macro scale—as people are committed to buying only one 
brand’s products, such as Apple’s fanboys. In each case, the business has suc-
cessfully retained the customer so long as the customer keeps putting money 
into that brand’s products or services.

Chapter 12 | Day-to-Day Management of Your Community
262
Regulation: Upon retention, you need to consider the facet of regulation. In any 
community, someone needs to step in and moderate to make sure that users 
are properly behaving within the group, and that each community member 
feels comfortable. It’s well known that people can be brutal on social media, 
so it may be up to the brand running the community to make sure that people 
are acting appropriately when debates become heated.
Enforcement: In some cases, people will abuse their privileges and go beyond 
the regulations set in place. The community team then needs to step in and 
remove or penalize a member of the community. This may anger someone 
who could be a proponent of the brand, but the enforcement makes the com-
munity a much better place for others.
Taken together, each of these elements should ideally lead to reactivation, 
in the sense that more people will be inspired to become customers, and 
will be enticed to step in as a result of these efforts, which brings us back to 
acquisition.
Understanding the Benefits of Community 
Management on Acquisition
Before the rise of community as influenced by social and digital media, tra-
ditional methods to increase awareness of a brand included television spots, 
networking, cold calls, direct mail, and print advertising. But today’s teams 
have a breadth of social media tools at their disposal, and the only costs of 
using these tools is the amount of time it takes to log on and use them (and 
of course, the compensation of employees hired to do so on a full- or part-
time basis).
Typically, community is more powerful in reaching a lot of people at once, and 
leveraging the many-to-many interactions between its community members. 
Some may argue that online events are perhaps not as personalized as hosting 
one-on-one events for real face-time. Fortunately, even though this is what we 
most often see when it comes to community, this doesn’t have to be the case.
More than ever, community teams are seeking to blur the lines between online 
and offline connections in an effort to make a digital experience feel more like 
an in-person one. While no good community manager would ever devalue 
the experience of in-person meetings, digital media can help improve lives in 
a number of ways and thereby increase acquisition opportunities. Let’s look 
at some of these.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
263
Generating Referrals
As you’ve learned throughout the course of this book, word of mouth is one 
of the best marketing tools out there. Similarly, when a brand advocate in the 
digital space gives a genuine and authentic review of your product or service, 
that review serves as a type of word-of-mouth sharing that can help signifi-
cantly grow your business.
Increasing Customer Retention and Engagement
Companies that have embraced sharing and providing information online on a 
regular basis are in the lead, ahead of companies that are struggling to stay rel-
evant and not conversing on social media. Customers who are engaged with 
a brand are more likely to become repeat customers. These repeat custom-
ers are not only adding to the bottom line, but also influencing their personal 
networks to pursue your brand.
Increasing Web Traffic
Today you can use more tools than ever to show whether a link you posted 
on social media is directing people to your site. Just as people will never dis-
cover a store if there are no roads to take them there, social media links open 
pathways for people to discover new websites (including yours). And if you 
have nailed down your target audience, then it often follows that the more 
people who come to your site, the more conversions you'll see.
Providing Tech and Customer Support
Deterred by long telephone wait times, people began using Twitter and 
Facebook to reach out to companies about technical service. This can be a 
great way to respond to customer concerns and figure out points of friction.  
The speed at which people can write and send tweets offers feedback in 
real time, which helps keep businesses motivated to improve user experience 
when difficulties arise.
Producing Market Research
Online listening and discovery can provide a wealth of information to help 
businesses learn more about their customers. Flip back to Chapter 7 for some 
tips on how to get the most information out of your social media listening 
efforts.

Chapter 12 | Day-to-Day Management of Your Community
264
Crowdsourcing Interests and Feedback
Crowdsourcing, too, came into play in Chapter 7. In engaging with your fans 
and learning about the interests of your communities and your influencers, 
you can facilitate more-relevant content for your communities. Additionally, if 
you are planning to implement a new program or initiative, then getting early 
feedback can be helpful in gauging interest from your community and vetting 
your solutions before you spend a lot of money on them.
Reducing Marketing Costs
In many ways, community is marketing. The big difference is, it doesn’t always 
cost thousands of dollars in the way that traditional advertising methods do. If 
your goal is to reach a million people, you can pay for an expensive television 
spot and funnel money into paying networks to play it. Or you can use com-
munity to build awareness in targeted audiences by focusing on the interests 
of your followers.
Listening to Your Customers to Help Sustain 
Your Community Efforts
Your community strategy won’t get you very far if your content isn’t relevant 
to your followers. We’ve already done a deep dive into how to tap into these 
follower interests, but it’s important to also know the real-world applications 
of this online listening.
Basic Engagement
Basic engagement is the art of posting relevant content and replying to inter-
esting posts. Imagine you’re a small fashion brand. You may have a group of 
superfans who absolutely love your brand and would love to be affiliated with 
it. They post pictures wearing your clothes, for example, and regularly reply 
to your tweets. In many ways, they think of the brand almost as a friend. By 
not engaging with them, you’re missing numerous opportunities to build those 
relationships and to inspire people to spend more of their limited attention 
and financial resources on your business. If those customers don’t come to 
you, they’ll most certainly be going to competitors instead.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
265
Conversation Seeding
Seeding conversation doesn’t mean shamelessly promoting your products and 
expecting people to share your content. Rather, it means focusing on the top-
ics of interest to your followers and finding ways to integrate your own brand 
into that conversation. This takes knowing what people are talking about, and 
being in touch with these discussions. Often, the art here is suggesting to oth-
ers that they share your content, without actually instructing them to do so.
Crisis Management
When people reach out to you via Twitter or another channel with a problem, it 
can most often be grouped into one of two buckets: customer service or crisis.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell which is which. For instance, a site glitch might 
build up a lot of fuss online, but if your team has a reputation for being highly 
reliable otherwise, and you have the issue resolved in an hour, then this is 
likely not a major crisis (although I can assure you it will seem like one in the 
moment). On the other hand, if your intern tweets something racially insensi-
tive from a Twitter account for a major brand, that’s a crisis.
Things will go wrong. In some cases, initiatives can go through rounds and 
rounds of editorial vetting and still go wrong, and if you’re aiming to be agile 
and responsive (which I would argue is an overall better practice), you should 
be aware that these things definitely happen. The goal is not to strive for 
perfection, since that very goal prevents people from being agile. Rather, the 
challenge is how to react when things do go wrong.
Even if the problem isn’t your company, just one bad apple in your community  
could be causing trouble for everyone else. This is especially true on the 
Internet, given that people don’t have the same level of tact that they might 
have when communicating in person. Tempers flare, and people get angry and 
irrational; if you’ve never seen this, you’re one of the lucky ones. 
Managing Conversations
Part of the point of having a community within a brand is that it has the DNA 
of the company, while enabling community user autonomy. In most cases, this 
will work for you, but in some cases it can also work against you. In some 
cases of conflict, you may not need to get involved. Instead, you can allow the 
members to articulate their points of view, and feel respected in the sense 
that they have the freedom to do so. But sometimes conflict will take on a 
life of its own, and may lead to threats or other behavior that your business 
doesn’t condone. This section presents some ideas to help mitigate the 
consequences of these conflicts.

Preventing Problems
In order to have a fully functional, vibrant brand community, you can establish 
protocols for use. Typically, if you run your community on your own platform, 
these can fall under the Terms of Service agreements that a user has to accept 
before joining the group. Or, if you invite your community to engage on a 
Facebook group, you can offer information in the header that suggests that 
bullying and other tactics won’t be tolerated. You can codify these protocols 
and make it clear that people who do not observe them may be ejected from 
the community. These rules usually prohibit disparaging language, abusive 
behavior, and disrespect of other community members’ opinions.
Listening to Suggestions and Complaints
For a big company, monitoring every interaction can be difficult, even with the 
best social media listening tools in place. When someone calls attention to an 
area of concern, many companies will reach out to that person to address the 
cause of concern. This open line of communication enables people to feel as 
though the company is really hearing their opinions, which in many cases will 
lead to cooperation in mitigating the situation. In the case of bad customer 
service or a negative experience with your brand, people are seeking valida-
tion. However, sometimes issues are a result of something else related to the 
brand (regardless of whether the event was blown out of proportion). In these 
cases, it is important to keep in mind your community goodwill and let people 
express themselves, while also keeping in mind your community health, as one 
negative person may ultimately deter people from engaging with your site.
Policing
Sometimes community members will act outlandishly in these online forums. 
Often it’s just a minor act of anger, perhaps arising from frustration, and when 
this is the case, it is appropriate to solve the problem amicably when you can.
However, in the community space there will always be trolls. A “troll” is a 
person who likes to cause problems and pick fights with members of the com-
munity out of spite or some other reason. As a community manager, your goal 
is to identify a troll, as opposed to a person with a legitimate gripe. Regardless, 
in the event that the behavior becomes disruptive, you may need to ban the 
offending person in order to protect the health of the community.
Trolls may take various shapes and sizes, but typically they’re on a mission to 
hurt others through their comments. Their words often lack any legitimate 
basis, and they will often use foul language in trying to seek validation. If left 
unpoliced, they can become a cancer to your community.

267
Relying on an Internal Process
In some cases, extremely active members of the community will volunteer to 
become moderators. If you’ve established a community in which people are 
so excited to be a part of the conversation that they are willing to help you 
moderate the content, you’ve done an excellent job.
Usually, a community will carefully vet and select its moderators. Typically, they 
do not receive compensation for their moderation but do receive substantial 
recognition within the community. As such, moderators can help mediate 
issues before they become of concern to the community as a whole. Relying 
on this internal policing process can help keep the peace within your com-
munity, as moderators often have the power to delete others’ comments and 
to ban people from the site as needed.
Incentivizing Customers: Promotions, Deals, 
and Referral Programs
If I’ve learned one thing from my time as a community manager, it’s that people 
love a good deal or an opportunity to win something. These promotions 
provide a great way to create engagement and keep people excited about what 
you’re doing (especially if the promotion or deal has a new product tie-in).
Encourage Engagement
The idea here shouldn’t always be to pick someone at random who happened 
to fill out a form. A better idea is to track down the people who really have 
helped your brand grow—the early adopters, the brand ambassadors, and 
the influencers—and seek to reward them for their contributions. These 
are your most invested customers, and neglecting them represents a missed 
opportunity. As a group, these are the people who are most likely to let you 
know when something goes right, as well as when it goes wrong, offering 
incredible value to your brand. You can engage with these people to show 
appreciation.
Try running contests that encourage engagement. If, for example, you’re a 
fashion brand, and you run an Instagram hashtag photo competition, you can 
select which photos make the final rounds based on engagement or voting (on 
Facebook, via likes), knowing that each of the people who make that round are 
likely influential users of your brand. Or you can keep it simple and ask people 
to photograph themselves using a hashtag special to your brand, and leave it 
to the company to select a winner based on all the entries.

Chapter 12 | Day-to-Day Management of Your Community
268
Integrate Incentives with Growth Strategy
Another way to grow your community is to bake it into your growth tactics. 
One great example of a company that saw tremendous success from this 
strategy is Dropbox. In case you’ve never used it, Dropbox is a leading file-
sharing tool that made it possible for people to easily share lots of big files, 
easing the need to use email (which often limits the size of transfers). Before 
Dropbox, transferring large files was a much more sophisticated task, which 
was problematic for people who needed to share large files on a regular basis. 
The tools that did exist were clunky, leading to low adoption rates. Dropbox 
made this file-sharing process simple, and was one of the first companies to 
properly execute cloud-based technology for file sharing.
However, early on, Dropbox understood that it needed to build brand aware-
ness in its go-to-market strategy. After all, this was a new tool, one that people 
hadn’t worked with before and might be reluctant to adopt amid numerous 
other tools out there. So it decided on an approach that relied on its com-
munity to help build its user base.
As part community strategy, part growth hack, Dropbox offered free space 
to users. If you invited your friends and they joined, Dropbox would offer you 
additional space (which was great for people who were sharing with more and 
more friends anyway). The company worked to position its referral program 
as “get more space” as opposed to “refer a friend,” which inherently tapped 
into the user’s need to have more space to continue sharing files.
By implementing this referral program, the company grew from 100,000 users 
to 4 million users in 15 months, with 2.8 million direct referral invites. The 
company is now worth an estimated $10 billion and reaches 300 million users 
worldwide. As the Dropbox example shows, the power of your community 
can amplify your reach as long as you enact the right referral program for your 
business.
Another way to build growth into your community strategy is to incentivize 
engagement by offering credits for certain levels of activity. This is a popular 
tactic with many online video games. For instance, many Facebook games yield 
significant bonuses in terms of points or incentives for getting new users to 
sign up for the game.
Other simple tactics include offering 20% off a person’s first purchase, or a 
discount if someone signs up for your email list. Finally, you can encourage 
people to submit new product ideas or vote on their favorite names or ideas, 
but be sure to let them know their top votes will only serve to influence the 
decision—or else you may end up committing to naming your new ice cream 
flavor “dirt” based on an engagement strategy gone awry.

Use Tools to Create Contests
A variety of tools are available for making community contests easy and fun. 
Let’s look at some of these in detail:
• 
Wildfire: This all-encompassing service provides tools for 
ads and promotions, as well as offering monitoring and 
analytics.
• 
Rafflecopter: This tool makes it easy to set up and launch 
a giveaway promotion.
• 
Offerpop:  A leading social media promotions tool, Offerpop 
helps provide platforms to run engaging, viral promotions 
on Facebook and Twitter, taking only minutes to set up.
• 
SnapApp: This platform provides integrated Facebook and 
Twitter sharing, which makes your app easy to share in a 
single click. 
Considering Events and Live Experiences
So much of what we do as community managers is digital that sometimes we 
lose sight of the personal connections that bring our community members 
together. For some businesses, events are a key part of an effective community 
management strategy. When people with shared interests get to meet each 
other in person for the first time (or third time, or tenth time), it elicits a 
real satisfaction in creating online relationships that lead to real-world com-
munities. Think of companies like Meetup, which have built entire businesses 
around the idea of meeting virtually first, and then moving on to real-world 
friendships. Today, Meetup receives, on average, 100 RSVPs a minute, bringing 
people who meet in offline communities into real-world activities.
If you are building an events-based strategy, make sure your in-person event 
is an authentic representation of your voice or brand. If you’re promoting a 
cupcake brand, it may not make sense to have a major presence at an Ultimate 
Fighting Championship event (though I suppose it could, if you've concluded 
it's a niche audience!). Anything that is off-brand can cause brand dilution. If 
you associate your business with things that are off-brand, the brand itself will 
become associated with those things, which can have an impact on it and can 
cause a domino effect against your relationship with customers.
Depending on the nature of your business, events may be a crucial forum for 
airing your ideas. Events represent an opportunity to enhance your brand and 
engage with your audience. On any given night, thousands of brands around 
the country are hosting events to help create and maintain relationships with 
their customers, or to help facilitate relationships with their target audience. 

Chapter 12 | Day-to-Day Management of Your Community

From the largest companies in the world, down to the mom-and-pop 
restaurant down the street, companies of all sizes build a sense of community 
through live events that lead to in-person interactions.
However, hosting events and life experiences are often outside the norm for 
many businesses. Making them happen breaks a routine, which may be one of 
the reasons some businesses stay away from them. But while routines can be 
productive and effective, they can also cause ruts. Events help get your “family” 
into one room and get them to do what you really want them to do, which 
is to interact with each other. As much as offline communities can add value 
to peoples’ lives, live events can help establish camaraderie and connections 
that create special moments for people who have shared interests. And they 
can also aid your company’s bottom line in several ways: by collecting event 
fees, facilitating important business development needs, raising awareness of 
potential customers, and creating general goodwill with your customers.
Planning Live Events
When planning community events, there may be a lot to consider. Some suc-
cessful events can cost nearly nothing to the business, while sometimes large, 
lavish events can also be massive failures. In planning events, it’s important to 
think carefully about your target audience and the things they enjoy. If you’ve 
completed the target audience exercises in Chapter 6, you should have a fairly 
good sense of this by now.
Size
It would be great for your first event to be a massive blowout with thousands of 
people involved, but in most cases, you’re still building up recognition, and a large 
event with guest appearances from Katy Perry and Rihanna just aren’t in the 
budget. The good thing is that you can have a great event even with just a hand-
ful of people. In any case, it’s a good idea to get your event-planning chops down 
before trying to figure out how to accommodate 500 people. Also, keep in 
mind the outcomes you’re trying to drive. If you’re building a community around 
professional networking opportunities, it’s probably best to plan an event that 
won't be so loud that people won’t have a chance to actually connect. The best 
events focus on quality, not quantity.
Venue
Your venue should match what your brand represents. An event at the wrong 
establishment will attract the wrong kinds people, and will most definitely 
discourage your target audience from attending. The same way you wouldn’t 
host a party for investors in a hard-to-find dive bar, don’t have your small 
startup party at the Ritz.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
271
Collaborations and Sponsorships
Many of the most successful community events are collaborations between 
two or more brands. For instance, a great startup party can often benefit from 
a large beer sponsor, and the beer sponsor can gain traction with its ideal 
audience by partnering with the startup. Curating good collaborations and 
sponsorships may take some time and may be contingent upon having solid 
connections, so be sure you are maintaining the valuable relationships with 
whomever can help you. Additionally, be sure your sponsorship partners and 
collaborators are on-brand, as you don’t want to be seen advocating a brand 
that doesn’t seem to fall in line with the values you purport to represent.
Speakers
If you are investing in a learning event or an education opportunity, use your 
connections to find speakers who will bring the most value to your business. 
These should be people who ideally represent your brand and further your 
cause. Keep in mind that speakers who are public figures can often help bring 
people to an event, but they may be expensive, and working with them may 
not be worth it if they don’t have something valuable to say.
Budget
Events can start off extremely cheap but quickly become incredibly expensive, 
depending on what you want to offer. Be sure to factor in the costs of the 
venue, food and beverages, materials, rentals (chairs, tables, audio equipment), 
signage, speaker fees, and event advertising.
A factor to be cognizant of in more recent years is the value of outlets and 
charging stations, so if you’re planning and all-day event, make sure you have 
plenty of power strips and means for electricity. And don’t forget the Wi-Fi! 
Ensure that you have the bandwidth you need to encourage engagement with 
attendees and those who are following via social media. I can’t tell you how 
many events screw this up.
Deadlines
Many times in the event-planning process, timeline events are contingent upon 
one another. For example, you may miss your chance of having your event 
listed in a major local publication if you don’t send it in at least a month in 
advance. Up until the day of the event, it is important to keep tabs on the 
timelines required for various tasks. You don’t want to find yourself in a bind 
because you decided to wait until the last minute to rent folding chairs, only 
to find the rental place was out of stock.

Chapter 12 | Day-to-Day Management of Your Community
272
Particularly when arranging events, tasks will take much longer than you 
anticipate. It will always take significant time to gain approvals, address  
miscommunications, and deal with snafus. Be sure to allocate plenty of time to 
deal with these problems. In addition, find ways to be agile, such as by keeping 
the number of additional rental places handy in the event of faulty equipment.
Events can be extremely stressful but can also provide fun and meaningful 
results. It’s important to keep cool when running an event, because otherwise 
your audience will see that you’re stressed, which may leave them with a nega-
tive impression of the brand. You can mitigate this to at least some degree by 
remembering not to bite off more than you can chew, and connecting with the 
right people to make your event happen.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed considerations surrounding the day-to-day 
management of your community. As you can see, there are plenty of things to 
do when it comes to handling the daily execution of a community manager’s 
job! But with the right processes in place and a strong foundation on which 
to build, the day-to-day community management efforts of your company 
can become increasingly seamless over time. Always be on the lookout for 
opportunities to optimize your processes, and the day-to-day community 
efforts will begin to fluidly integrate into your larger plan. In the next chapter, 
we’ll tie these day-to-day efforts into your brand’s broader vision through 
effective storytelling.

powerful way to connect at an emotional level with your audience.

Storytelling: An Overview
Think about the last time you heard a great story. Not just any story, but a 
story that held you captivated, one that made you laugh or cry. What was it 
about that story that kept you interested in hearing more? What stood out to 
you? What made it a great story?
If you come from a technical background, you may think that storytelling is 
something for English classes and Netflix. But it’s also one of the most essen-
tial elements of community management.
Throughout this book, I’ve taught you a lot about identifying your audience 
and then obtaining data to reach them. Storytelling is what helps community 
managers pull this information together to reach their audiences. Using all the 
findings, facts, and data, community managers must learn to create content

that accurately reflects the brand’s voice and vision. To tell your brand’s story, 
you must create the words and images that help convey your brand’s message 
to your audience.
Companies that do this well can become powerful in the minds of consumers, 
impacting peoples’ daily dialogue and resonating within society. Think of Nike 
or Apple, and then think of the millions of people their stories inspire every 
year. Storytelling helps humanize the brand, reminding us that we’re not just 
trying to sell products to our customers, but that we’re trying to connect 
with them.
Storytelling itself is as old as language. From the moment people could first 
string words together, they were able to communicate the stories that 
­mattered to them. Storytelling is the basis for Greek theater, Shakespeare’s 
plays, folk legends, and, to at least some degree, nearly every form of artis-
tic communication (including visual storytelling through art, photography, and 
graphic design).
Storytelling has been bringing people together in communities for thousands 
of years, and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. But marketers often find 
themselves confused—how does this apply to my business?
It’s true that storytelling as an element of an effective community strategy is 
far more nebulous than something like identifying your target audience or 
conducting a social media audit. I tend to think of a story in both a broad 
sense and a narrow one: broad, in that every single piece of content, interac-
tion, or contribution from a community manager helps build the story of your 
brand; yet narrow, in the sense that even just a single image can tell an amazing 
story.
Community managers need to be able to tell stories because they need to be 
able to entertain their followers, which helps build strong brand impressions 
and loyalties to the brand. Through a strong narrative or interesting imagery, 
brands can help regular people form true connections to the brand, and can 
keep them coming back again and again.
Storytelling in community management takes a number of forms. For example, 
it can mean reaching someone through interesting content on social media, 
digital video, podcasting, longer content such as white papers or ebooks, film, 
art or graphic design—and any of which may be viewable in person, on a 
cell phone, on a computer, via tablet, or even in new forms of media such as 
Google Glass. Essentially, each of these items can help you relay a story, and 
together they can present the brand’s story in its entirety. 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
275
Authenticity in Storytelling
As a community management professional, one of the most important things 
you can do is to make sure your story is authentic. When companies try 
to take community approaches that aren’t genuinely authentic to the brand,  
customers notice.
But one of the difficulties in creating an authentic brand story is that some-
times we don’t know who, exactly, we’re trying to reach, so it can be hard to 
find ways to resonate with them. Hopefully, all of the brand and social media 
listening exercises I’ve given you are more than enough to give you a deep 
understanding of your brand and what kind of story or stories will resonate 
with them. This will help you find ways to reach them, and to share your  
stories in ways that these people will understand.
The goal of storytelling may be twofold: it may serve an entertainment 
­purpose (such as the story your friend tells you about how he once picked 
the wrong person up from the airport and didn’t know until he was almost 
home), and it may serve to communicate valuable information (such as a story 
about someone making the choice to commit to a business idea that turned 
very lucrative, and using that information to teach people how to follow their  
passions and also make money from them).
When your storytelling is inauthentic, people can tell. Sure, in some instances 
you might get by when doing something not truly authentic to your brand, 
but each time you do that, you’re also risking crippling the brand identity by 
altering the voice of the vision. For instance, if a kid-friendly brand starts using 
curse words in its storytelling, this completely changes the brand and the 
brand story.
Storytelling and the Marketer’s Struggle
If we don’t use storytelling devices, we’re doomed to experience a monoto-
nous recital of information. If you’ve ever had to sit through a boring lecture, 
wondering whether it was possible to die, literally, from boredom, then you’ve 
already witnessed one of the reasons you can’t rely on just stating information 
to get people invested in your brand. All the information in that lecture may 
have been important and useful, but it didn’t matter because your boredom 
kept you from listening or truly connecting.
Unfortunately, many marketers aren’t trained in using literary devices, so it 
can be fairly difficult for them to understand the value of superior storytell-
ing skills. Thus far in the book, we’ve talked in detail about facets of business 
that rely on rationality and numbers, which can form the basis of any reports 
that can help you determine ROI and review the success of certain initiatives. 

Chapter 13 | Storytelling
276
Storytelling is a little bit more nebulous, in that the “rules” for storytelling are 
more like guidelines. It’s hard to tell what’s going to truly resonate with your 
community, but you can use the same experimentation methods taught in the 
previous chapters to help guide you.
Each of our stories is a representation of our brand. In understanding that 
the brand identity is essentially a function of all these stories in tandem with 
one another and how the world interprets such stories, it becomes easier to 
understand why, as a marketing professional, it’s important to understand the 
essence of telling a strong story.
Story Structure
In mastering the art of storytelling, it’s important to know that unlike some 
of the other tools I’ve given you to help understand and connect with your 
audience, storytelling isn’t always a perfect science. At its core, it is artistic 
expression, which is one of the fundamental reasons that there’s not always 
a “right” way to convey the message. It’s also why different stories work for 
different brands.
It’s important to understand that powerful visual imagery, such as in a  
photograph, can alone tell a story. However, the emphasis in a story is on the 
narrative.
Sometimes, in talking about the narrative, it helps to think of the hero’s jour-
ney (the plot line of everything from The Odyssey to Star Wars). As applied to 
business, the story might cover the business trajectory, such as what inspired 
the business and how the company was trying to solve a problem, the obsta-
cles it faced, and whether or not it was a success. The business story is a little 
bit different from other stories, because these types of stories don’t always 
end except when the business itself opts to close its doors. Even then, the 
story may live in on in the hearts of the people who believe in it, or through 
history when people are trying to use the story of a brand to help explain and 
interpret other business stories.
A narrative is a type of story that usually depicts someone sharing a sequence 
of events over time. Again, this can be interpreted on both the micro and 
macro levels. Zappos’s story of success through customer service is supported 
by smaller stories that help give details that uphold that overarching story.
Typically, a theme supports the narrative. For many brands, the theme will be 
baked right into the brand name or tagline: Apple’s “Think different” inspires 
thoughts of innovation. With each device, press event, and strategically cre-
ated hype surrounding various changes within the company, Apple is helping to 
create that story of what it means to be one of the nation’s most innovative 
brands.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
277
Most narratives also have a plot. The plot is essentially the logline of the story, 
and if you’re having a tough time figuring out the plot, if might be helpful to 
write out: “This is a story about…” and fill it in from there. If you log on to 
IMDb, every single movie you see has a snippet about the plot. In most cases, 
you should be able to describe the plot in two or three sentences. (Boy 
meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy makes attempts to win girl back. Boy wins back 
girl.) Sometimes—especially in business—you can convey the plot in very few 
words: David vs. Goliath.
Then, the smaller anecdotes make up the story. If you’re watching a play, these 
are the scenes, or the vignettes, the slices of the story that come together 
to create something bigger than itself. If you get in a fight with a friend, this is 
only one part of the story: we need context for why that happened in the first, 
place, what the resolution was, and where you guys stand now.
In writing a story, we typically try to offer a little bit of background to help 
set it up. Who are the characters? What is their relationship to one another? 
Where are they from? Sometimes this is referred to as exposition. While in 
most stories some exposition is necessary, it’s often a fundamental flaw of the 
storyteller or writer to add too much exposition and drag down the story. 
The important point here is to focus mostly on the things that directly impact 
the story you’re trying to tell, particularly when you have a limited amount of 
space and time to tell the story, as is so often the case in marketing.
Most narrative stories feature a protagonist and an antagonist. The protagonist 
doesn’t have to be a character, but usually is something that’s personified to 
at least the extent that it can have thoughts and feelings. If you want to tell a 
story about a cloud, it could work, but you’d probably want to personify that 
cloud in order to give it thoughts and feelings. If you’re telling the story of your 
business, the story narrative wouldn’t be about just one person, but about the 
many people who came together to form the business.
The antagonist is the bad guy in the story. It’s the Goliath to David, or the villain 
in any James Bond movie. Not every narrative will have a human or human-
like antagonist, because many will have something else, such as an obstacle or 
barrier that the protagonist has to overcome in order to be successful in the 
story.
Each of these characters typically has a motive. The motive helps drive the 
story. What does the main character want, and what does the antagonist want 
that deters the protagonist. Sometimes the main character typically wants 
simply to defeat the bad guy, but the motive is usually couched in some much 
deeper element. If you can give that person a justification for their desire, 
you’re likely to have a much stronger story. The audience needs to understand 
what lies at the heart of the motive. For instance, if the protagonist in the 
story wants a sandwich, the story differs significantly if he wants it to steal it

from someone else as compared to wanting it because he’s been on a hunger 
strike and hasn’t eaten in weeks.
The plot moves forward through the rising action. The rising action is the 
sequence of events that lead to the climax. In good story structure, each area 
of conflict will build onto the last. In the types of movies where everything 
goes wrong, it helps to build to the zanier aspects and points of conflict in 
order to help create a solid climax.
The climax is the biggest moment of the story. It’s the last thing that happens 
before our resolution of the story. In romantic comedies, this is the scene 
where the ex-boyfriend crashes the woman’s wedding to tell her how much 
he loves her. The reason this image is such a cliché is that spoiling a wedding 
is an example of high stakes, which is something we’ll talk about in more detail 
a little bit later on.
In simple terms, the resolution is about how the protagonist (or outside cir-
cumstances) resolve the conflict. The climax has already occurred, so it’s now 
time to pull the pieces of the story together to create a resolution. The reso-
lution typically lies in: “Does the hero achieve what he sought to achieve?”  
All of this leads toward the conclusion, or the end.
Your favorite movie may have had a happy ending or a sad ending, or some-
where in between. Occasionally, a story has a cliff-hanger ending, but this is 
typically a result of setting up a sequel and often leaves people feeling unsatis-
fied. In sitcoms, this is the “lesson is learned” sort of moment. The goal with 
the ending is to give the audience something memorable to take away. In 
­giving a narrative in public speaking, this may be a listing of actual takeaways or  
lessons learned.
In some cases, there may be a twist ending. These are harder to write, but 
they tend to leave real impressions on audiences. In a twist ending, two things 
that seem generally unrelated seem to tie back together, or the author uses 
some other mechanism to help create a surprise for the audience. This is 
not fundamental to telling a great story but is a terrific tool to have at your 
disposal in storytelling.
Not every story you tell about your business will have each of these elements, 
but it is useful to know the typical story structure so that you can use these 
items when communicating with your community. Whether you’re a founder 
with an interesting story, you want to share an influencer’s story of superior 
customer service, or you just want to give your audience something to inspire 
them, you can look to some of these elements to help get your story across 
so that it resonates with the audience.

What is the plot of your brand’s story?
• 
What was the background or landscape at the inception 
• 
of your business?
Who (or what) is the protagonist of your brand’s story?
• 
Who (or what) is the antagonist of your brand’s story?
• 
What did each of those characters want?
• 
What were your main characters’ motives?
• 
What were the biggest conflicts the protagonist was up 
• 
against?
Was there a climax moment? What happened?
• 
What was the resolution? Did the protagonist get what 
• 
he or she wanted? How about the antagonist?
How does the story end? (For a business, the question 
• 
might be reframed as “How is the business doing now?”)
Now, think about how these ideas that build the brand story can be applied 
to other types of stories as they relate to the brand or the business, such as 
those told through community experiences and visual representations.
Example: The Chipotle Scarecrow
In September 2013, Chipotle Mexican Grill debuted a campaign that ­consists 
of a three-and-a-half-minute animated video in conjunction with a video game 
that features similar content and rewards players with free food at the chain. 
The video, released via YouTube, depicts a scarecrow who works for “Crow 
Industries,” a large food plant that supplies the city’s fast-food restaurants 
with its animal products. The plant, run by robotic crows, processes the car-
toon livestock into mechanically produced meals, even labeled “100% beef-
ish.” Crow Industries boasts that its food is all natural beef and chicken, yet 
the chickens are pumped with antibiotics and the cows live in boxes so tiny  
that only their bodies fit. As Fiona Apple sings a slow, haunting version of 

Chapter 13 | Storytelling

“Pure Imagination” from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the pro-
tagonist scarecrow visually laments his role in food supply and commutes 
home to his idyllic house in the country. At his idyllic cottage, he gathers 
the best homegrown vegetables from his garden and returns to the city to 
sell his bounty in the form of fresh Mexican burritos under a banner stating, 
“Cultivate a Better World.”
A marketing campaign is successful if it broadcasts its message to its intended 
audience, creates a conversation, and engages its customers. Throughout  
“The Scarecrow” campaign, Chipotle did all three. It made a statement about 
the industrial nature of the American food supply and made it obvious that 
customers want fresh, locally produced food devoid of chemicals. The socially 
responsible fast-food restaurant uses the video to shed a little bit of light on 
industrial farming practices without seeming preachy. Additionally, by creating 
a fictional, animated world, Chipotle sidesteps the issues relating to using real 
footage of factory farms for shock value. Chipotle prides itself on the quality 
of ingredients and sources, most from local and/or organic farms. According 
to Chipotle’s website, it is committed to “food with integrity, meaning serv-
ing the very best sustainably raised food possible with an eye to great taste, 
great nutrition, and great value.” This sentiment is clearly reinforced in this 
campaign.
In addition to broadcasting its position, Chipotle has started the conversation 
about the issues surrounding our food supply. A quick Internet search can 
find numerous articles, even weeks after the initial campaign launched, dis-
cussing the message of the video and the game. By having others continue the 
conversation about the importance of ethically raised livestock and organic 
produce, Chipotle is reaching a larger audience (for free) and fostering discus-
sion around the food-supply chain and the merits of improving the status quo. 
Even if consumers and the media are not talking specifically about burritos, 
Chipotle has managed to associate itself with sustainable food practices in the 
minds of consumers.
Finally, Chipotle engaged its customer base via a game. Organizations are 
quickly learning that a glut of messages are vying for our attention, and 
Chipotle’s video game may force consumers to subconsciously listen to its 
message a bit longer via game play. The game puts the player in the shoes of 
the scarecrow, navigating the dangers of the industrial food factory, essen-
tially causing the player to fight the industrial food system digitally. Players can 
even win a free burrito coupon, bringing gamers straight to the steps of their 
nearest Chipotle. Through “The Scarecrow” campaign, Chipotle has created 
informed consumers through education and engagement.

Tactics
Unfortunately, storytelling isn’t just throwing each of the story structure 
­elements together to create a story. In order to effectively convey a mes-
sage, there are a few items you should keep in mind while telling your story.  
We refer to these as tactics, and you can use these tactics to help make your 
stories more interesting and memorable to your audience.
A story won’t be captivating unless there are stakes. In talking about stakes, we 
mean knowing what costs would be associated with failure. The best stories 
have all-or-nothing stakes, where people can lose their homes, their families, 
their loved ones, or their livelihoods if they fail at their missions. Sometimes, 
storytellers can manipulate concepts that don’t seem inherently high stakes 
into something that has the tension of a higher-stakes dramatic climax, merely 
due to the relationships between one another or the context of the story. 
You might see this in cases where the character has to get her lucky doll back, 
or where someone has to get something difficult done within a short amount 
of time. It may not seem like that big of a deal if a slacker protagonist has to 
get her final exam essay complete within 48 hours, but the stakes are much 
higher if we know that if she fails, she won’t get to graduate from high school 
and she’ll lose her college scholarship. If you are telling a story and you can’t 
identify the stakes, identify the worst thing that could happen if your main 
character doesn’t complete the task, and aim to put your audience into your 
main character’s shoes.
Another aspect of storytelling that’s important to understand is dialogue. 
While not all types of stories rely on dialogue, some rely on it almost exclu-
sively. If you are writing dialogue for your script or story, think carefully about 
what people actually say and how they communicate information, and try to 
tap into that. This can be difficult for someone who is new to storytelling, but 
taking an improv class can help with understanding the natural flow of conver-
sation. When dialogue sounds stilted and unrealistic, people notice.
Sometimes stories are just as much about what’s not said as they are about 
what is said. In telling your stories, experiment with ways to deliver subtext. 
These are subtle messages that indicate a stance on an issue, even though the 
story never outright announces that’s the point. One example we often use 
at General Assembly is the epic storyline of Apple’s “1984” Super Bowl TV ad, 
which seems to imply a subtext that the world is going down a draconian path, 
but that Apple is there to create a revolution. Even though the commercial 
never explicitly says as much, it is often interpreted in such a way that the 
subtext, a better future, shines through.
Crafting a great story goes beyond understanding the fundamental structure 
of storytelling. To create the best story, you should also have some degree 
of understanding of the power of language. Community managers need to 
have strong writing and communication skills, and part of that is having an 

Chapter 13 | Storytelling
282
extremely strong grasp of language. It means knowing the technical aspects, 
which includes editorial skills such as capitalization and punctuation, but it also 
means knowing more nuanced things, like sentence structure and how to use 
interesting stories and copy to convey information. 
In writing a story, one device you can use to help set the stage for your audi-
ence is character development. Steve Jobs will likely prove to be a major icon 
in America’s history, much like Thomas Edison or Teddy Roosevelt, but much 
of his legacy hinges on knowing what kind of guy Steve Jobs was when he 
was alive. Sharing facts about his past or illustrating ways he took his work 
extremely seriously are great devices to help a person understand what it 
meant to be Steve Jobs.
It helps to use vivid imagery to illustrate your stories. This can mean interest-
ing graphics or videos, but in many cases, you can create interesting visual 
imagery using only words. These visual images keep people interested, and in 
many cases can also inject some humor or emotion into your work.
In using this vivid imagery, you can experiment with similes. A simile is a liter-
ary device that uses the word “like” or “as” to compare two items. Instead of 
saying, “The dress was soft,” you might say, “The dress was as soft as the fur of 
a kitten.” Clearly, it’s much more interesting to use the kitten simile than it is 
to simply say the item is soft.
Additionally, you can incorporate the use of metaphors into your stories.  
A metaphor is an implicit comparison of one thing to another. Rather than using 
“like” or “as” as with a simile, you’d say something more like “All the world’s a 
stage” (to borrow from William Shakespeare). This well-known phrase elicits 
the image that we are all just performers on the stage of the world.
If you’re creating a story to share with your community, you might also want 
to use tactics of persuasion to help inspire people to see your point of view. 
In storytelling, you can do this best by stating your thesis, using facts and data 
to support it, and then coming to a logical conclusion at the end of the piece. 
This is more of an expository storytelling tactic, but every so often it can be 
applicable in the community space.
One of the more useful storytelling tactics is the element of surprise. I touched 
on this previously when I mentioned twist endings, but even on a broader 
scale, it’s this element of surprise that really creates a special connection with 
the audience. No one wants to watch a video if we already know what’s going 
to happen. What we want to watch is a piece that delightfully surprises us 
through humor, or through uplifting content, or through an unexpected dra-
matic twist. But even when presenting and speaking in front of people, surpris-
ing them by using an interesting tactic such as asking them a question, doing 
a silly dance, or embracing a different character can make all the difference in 
the effectiveness of your story. 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
283
Finally, another interesting storytelling tactic is to start by setting the stage for 
where you are now, and then use that to formulate what the future could be. 
This tactic gets people excited about what the future may bring, and it helps 
encourage them to follow you forward in this journey. This tends to be an 
excellent persuasive tactic, and is used by people seeking business budgets and 
funding, as well as by people giving TED talks and hosting major press events, 
such as when Steve Jobs unveiled Apple’s iPhone.

  Take the story elements you wrote. Which tactics can you leverage to best tell your 
story? Find ways to incorporate at least three of these elements into the story.
Getting People Emotionally Invested in  
Your Brand
Now that we’ve discussed the story structure and the tactics you can use to 
help tell your stories, it’s time to address the number one issue that plagues 
marketers when it comes to storytelling in the community space: getting  
people emotionally invested in your story.
A really great story is an honest appeal to a person’s emotions. These are 
the stories that make us laugh, cry, or cower in fear. Each of these elements 
may be simply an aspect of the story, but they could also be incorporated into 
the overarching narrative (that is, a sad story or a funny story). In community 
management and digital storytelling, we tend to see the most success with 
uplifting stories and funny stories, as these often have the highest possibility 
of “going viral.” People tend to share things that make them look respectable 
or cool in the eyes of their audiences, and as such, funny and uplifting stories 
seem to have the most impact.
On the other hand, stories may rely on a rational appeal as well. In these 
cases, the author uses numbers and hard data to help get the story across. It 
might mean using facts and statistics to help back up claims. Many good stories 
incorporate the use of both. You might use an emotional story to drive your 
narrative, but then incorporate data to help hammer home important points.
In deciding how to appeal to your community’s emotions, it’s essential that 
you know them, and know them well. It’s also important that whichever 
stance you take is on-brand for your business, as your 100-year-old invest-
ment ­banking firm may not be the right place to try to tell humorous stories. 
Remember that all of these stories are reflections of your brand, and as such 
it’s important that all are true to your brand and can tap into the needs and 
desires of your audience.

Chapter 13 | Storytelling
284
One of the best ways to determine how your stories might best appeal to 
your audience is to be in touch with your community. A community of mommy 
bloggers might have a collective need to protect their children, so the story 
you might want to tell with your new children’s soap products is one that taps 
into the desire to protect children. This may mean telling about products that 
have been proven unsafe for children, and then using your product to show all 
the benefits, such as all-natural ingredients and fewer reported skin irritations 
than competing products.
You can learn what your community is interested in by going back to the 
listening and discovery exercises we talked about in Chapter 7, in order to 
help set the framework for these stories. It’s important to remember that  
different communities will respond to different things. And, like most things, 
it’s important to test and validate your assumptions before spending signifi-
cant resources in executing.
To get people emotionally invested in your brand, it’s important to create 
an awesome story. The story is what will resonate with people, and it’s why 
people remember your brand. It should be true to your mission, and your 
voice should be consistent. Using the preceding tactics, you should be able to 
find numerous ways to reach your readers, and should never be stuck trying 
to think of types of content to generate. Your audience is already telling you 
what they want to see. They need to know that your brand is listening.

  Go back to the data gleaned from your social media listening exercises. Select a 
popular trend or hot topic of conversation that you homed in on during that study. Then generate five 
subjects you can write about for those topics. Decide whether you will use an emotional appeal or a 
rational appeal for each story.
Content Creation
Using the tactics outlined in this chapter, you can now start finding ways to 
create content that that will truly speak to your reader. Let’s do a little over-
view of the types of digital content you can create:
• 
Micro: This is super short content, such as those types 
that live on Twitter.
• 
Short-form: This is slightly longer content, such as the type 
you might post on Facebook.
• 
Photographic: Most social media sites these days have 
some area for photographic content, but sites such as 
Instagram and Snapchat are almost exclusively dedicated 
to pictures.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
285
• 
Video (and animation): Filmed (or animated) content of any 
length, available on sites like YouTube and Vimeo.
• 
Graphics: Graphics could include webcomics or infograph-
ics, and they are often supplemental to blog content.
• 
Blog: Medium-length content that goes deeper into 
particular subject matter, typically hosted on sites like 
WordPress.
• 
Long-form: This type of content may appear in the form 
of ebooks or white papers, and involves a much deeper 
analysis of information.
• 
Press releases: If you have news to share about your busi-
ness, you may wish to issue a press release to help garner 
interest in your story from media outlets.
• 
Slide decks: A mishmash of the preceding content types, 
brands are using slide decks more and more often to tell 
their stories using many different images and text.
You may also be able to submit content via newspaper columns, magazine 
articles, and traditional books, but in digital media we tend to think of this 
less when thinking about what it means to create content. Content could also 
technically encompass paid media such as Google Ads and Sponsored Tweets, 
but we tend to think of those separately, as they serve a different purpose and 
typically that type of ad spending comes from different parts of the budget.
Content encompasses a range of things, but the content we’re talking about 
here is the type you own and that you can use to help communicate your 
message to your community. In the preceding chapter, we discussed which 
platforms we can use to best reach your audience.
It’s important for brands to generate numerous types of content in order 
to keep their followers engaged. If you can provide consistent, interesting 
content, your followers will be more likely to interact with your brand and 
ultimately become the types of brand advocates who can generate coveted 
word-of-mouth recommendations.
In creating good content, look back to the storytelling methodologies I’ve 
listed to help figure out the most powerful ways to reach people. If necessary, 
you can hire a blogger and a graphic designer to work with you on a freelance 
basis to help keep the content flowing. They’ll know what to cover after you 
start your content calendar, which we’ll cover in Chapter 12.
Remember that if you create long-form content, you can also repurpose the 
content as short-form content. Or if you post freestanding photos, you can 
also incorporate these in emails and other press materials. Because so much 
of community management is about sharing great content and putting it into 

Chapter 13 | Storytelling

the world, it’s important to make sure you have interesting, relevant content 
on a consistent basis. Notice that the most popular blogs and social media 
channels thrive on consistent content, and that when they stop posting and 
updating, they lose their relevance.

  Think back to the listening study again. Where is your audience living on social media? 
Think about where they are, and which kinds of content your business can use to help reach them. 
Come up with three creative ways to reach your audience, such as through sharing a funny slide 
presentation or making a music video.
Content Strategy
Once you decide which types of content to create, you’ll need to focus on 
how to get that content out there in the world. Earlier in the book, I talked 
about designing a content strategy that takes the information you gleaned 
from your social media listening and developing a content strategy for your 
business.
The content strategy should be a protocol for your content creation efforts, 
identifying which areas of content you’d like to focus on developing, as well as 
what results you’re seeking by distributing that content. It should offer realis-
tic goals, and should also aim to take into consideration the types of content 
that are creating conversions on your website. Your content strategy should 
determine which platforms are the most valuable to you, and it should offer 
guidelines as to how to best leverage these for results.
Content strategy means also developing a system for maintaining the content 
on the site. This means designating who will be in charge of which community 
management roles within your company. If your social media accounts have a 
high level of customer service focus, the community team might have to work 
with the customer service team to best figure out a system for handling both 
the customer service complaints and the community conversations.
Essentially, the content strategy should be a repeatable system for creating and 
distributing content. This means that if a new person were to walk onto the 
job tomorrow, the content strategy document could guide them in how the 
business is using community management. It should take into consideration 
the results of the social media listening study to determine which platforms to 
focus on, as well as the strategies to best execute these plans.
In creating the content strategy, setting goals is one of the best ways to help 
you put a plan in place to hit those goals. Though the process of iteration has 
been talked about more deeply throughout the book, by using the framework 

The Community Manager’s Playbook
287
in Chapter 9 you can figure out what’s working and what isn’t and use that 
information to help create a strong community.
If you have an e-commerce business or a business with seasonal activity, take 
that into consideration as you build your content plan. Will you need to hire 
new people or agencies to help with execution during these busier seasons? 
Think about all the things that might impact your content strategy, and do 
your best to address them within the content strategy document.
At the end of the day, the content strategy document is a living document. 
It should be updated regularly to reflect changes in implementation, and it 
should be reviewed frequently to address changes in audience tastes or the 
market landscape.
Surveys show that companies that have content strategy documents in place, 
as well as at least one person who is responsible for the development and 
maintenance of the content strategy, end up seeing far greater returns for the 
content they put out into the world. Keep this in mind as you develop your 
content strategy, as having these tools in your back pocket can contribute to 
significant ROI.
Differentiating Content
While we’ve nailed down the fact that it’s important to have consistent con-
tent, there’s also one other thing that will push your content above your 
competitors’: differentiation.
In nearly any industry, you can find businesses publishing content merely 
because it helps improve their visibility in search engines. This is fine for 
those companies, and content produced for search engine optimization is a 
fairly useful and important marketing strategy. But they’re also putting a lot of 
wasted effort into generating content that’s not generating engagement.
To create the type of content that will help drive your community, you need 
to really be in touch with what interests them. Again, this is where your social 
media listening comes into play. You can also draw on your understanding of 
your target audience and brand, which we discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
But beyond that, you can use the storytelling principles and tactics detailed in 
this chapter to help create interesting content. Tell emotion-driven stories, 
and see how they resonate with your brand. If it’s on brand for you, use humor 
to help make people laugh, or to tell an uplifting story to inspire your audi-
ence. Post inspirational quotes or jump into the conversation when there’s a 
new meme making the rounds.

Chapter 13 | Storytelling
288
Another way to differentiate your content is to experiment with creativity. 
Creativity knows no boundaries, so keep the ideas flowing. I’ve seen stop-
motion animations, inspirational documentaries, funny commercials, Google 
Hangouts, Q&As, and a plethora of other ways to bring people together in 
their communities.
Also, be sure to keep abreast of trending topics so that you can chime in as it 
seems suitable. Think back to the Super Bowl in 2013, when the lights in the 
stadium suddenly went out. While the lights were still out, people turned to 
social media to figure out what was going on. At the same time, Oreo posted 
an image of one of its recognizable cookies emanating a white-light aura in a 
dark backdrop, with the words “You can still dunk in the dark.” That simple act 
cost no media dollars but garnered 525 million impressions. In the first hour, 
the tweet was retweeted more than 10,000 times, received more than 18,000 
likes, and was shared more than 5,000 times. Why? Because it was topical, 
funny, and creative, which is a perfect recipe for differentiating your content.
Finally, one of the most important—yet often overlooked—keys to differenti-
ating your content is to spend time honing your brand voice. If people know 
just from a certain style of picture or a type of content that it’s yours, then 
you’re helping to facilitate recognition of that nebulous thing we call brand. 
Writing in a consistent voice can help tremendously in helping people recog-
nize your work.
Storytelling: The Essence of Reaching the 
Community
All the work we’ve done so far in establishing business foundations, under-
standing our target audience, learning about our brand, and using listening and 
discovery doesn’t mean much if we don’t have great content to help reach 
our customers. In creating good content, it’s important to be authentic, and 
to use powerful storytelling techniques to captivate readers. Additionally, it’s 
necessary to understand how your community is using these platforms, and 
to create content that touches on the conversations they’re already having in 
the space.
Think, for example, about a community of fitness advocates. Assuming the 
community manager has done his or her work well, that person might under-
stand that the fitness group loves to be motivated, loves to know about new 
health trends and topics, and has frequent conversations about the safety of 
health supplements.

The Community Manager’s Playbook
289
If this is all true, then it follows that there are many types of content you can 
create. But it does not follow that all of them will be on-brand. If the company 
is rooted in inspiration and motivation, humor may not be an appropriate tac-
tic The important thing here is to test and iterate so that you’re tapping into 
the conversations that drive conversions for your brand.
If, as a community manager, you want to chime in on the safety of a nutritional 
supplement, you can do so using text only. But what could be better is an 
infographic, which your designer can create based on information your team 
finds on the Web. It takes significantly more work to create an infographic, but 
they also tend to be more sharable as well. That means that by investing in 
that type of content, you’re also encouraging your followers to be advocates 
for your brand.
Again, in creating and distributing content types, it’s important to test and 
iterate. If your blog content isn’t pulling the number of clicks that you would 
deem a success and is failing to help you meet your goals, think about why that 
might be the case. I feel so strongly about the importance of tactical initiative 
testing that I’ve dedicated an entire chapter to it, which is the next chapter in 
this book.
Summary
For CMs, the art of storytelling is an important skill to refine if you’re not 
walking into your role in possession of it already. Like any skill, creating great 
content is one that can be developed and evolved. Use your listening and  
discovery work to determine what your audience is most interested in read-
ing and sharing, and you’ll have a strong foundation to build from.

About the Author
Lauren Perkins brings passion, drive, and 
commitment to every aspect of her personal 
and professional life. Whether she’s at a yoga 
retreat in Mexico, mentoring an American 
Cancer Society marathon team, or building an 
agile marketing infrastructure for a high-growth 
company, she is always on her A-game.
Founder and CEO of Perks Consulting, a brand-
led digital innovation consultancy, Lauren is the 
driving force behind the firm’s approach: “Think 
like a Brand. Act like a Startup.™”
She is a results-oriented leader, a dynamic and 
engaging speaker, and a self-proclaimed geek. 
Some of the things she loves to geek out about are community building, 
technology, fitness, agile marketing, mascara, brand innovation, and shoes. 
She has been building and reinventing brands and businesses for 10 years.
As a teacher, she has nurtured ideation, creativity, and problem solving 
in students at General Assembly in New York and companies around the 
world. Her passion for fitness informs her performance-driven approach 
to business and life. Her approach to community building was born from 
the values of her warm, all-embracing, Italian-American family. In a world 
transformed by technology and the death of attention, Lauren has learned 
how to identify the keys to developing an agile marketing approach that drives 
success. As her background in journalism demonstrates, Lauren is curious 
and thoughtful, and she loves to dig into complex problems to uncover the 
insights and stories behind the headlines and then share what she learns. She 
has a big personality, a lot of opinions, and the experience and moxie to back 
it all up.
Lauren is a contributing writer to CMX, Forbes, and Inc., and she has  
been featured in US News & World Report, Mashable, Business Insider, and 
The Huffington Post. She is also a founding marketing instructor at General 
Assembly, regularly teaching digital insights, brand strategy, community 
management, and agile marketing.

Acknowledgments
Dad, my very first editor and coach and the original techie geek in my life! 
Thank you for all the red ink over the years and for the red ink you’ve 
contributed to this book. You’ve made tech and sports an integral part of my 
life and influenced my approach to learning, performance, and optimization 
in the pool, on the track, and in life. Thank you for teaching me about the 
wonders of “PRs”—the small wins all add up!
Mom, the originator of #toughlove. Thank you for being that one constant fire 
under my ass and for the impossibly high standards you have always held me 
to, for keeping our heads screwed on straight, and motivating us to accomplish 
more than we ever thought possible. Thank you for the values you’ve instilled 
in Gina and me along the way. My community instincts and sense of curation 
stem from your Italian “take care of your own” family principles. And it’s not 
just because you taught me how to make an amazing lasagna and host the 
ultimate dinner party.
Gina, thank you for the reminder that I am more than just my work and that 
people are really interested to know the whole person. 
This book likely would not have come to life without the General Assembly 
(@GA) family and Brad Hargreaves. Thank you for asking me to whip up a 
community “workshop” back in the beginning of 2011. It’s hard to believe, 
after all that has gone into this book, that my deep dive into capturing the art 
and science of community started as an experiment to support our fellow 
startup friends building and gaining adoption for great tech products. What 
started as an evening experiment has grown into an international educational 
and entrepreneurial success! I couldn’t be more proud to have been part of 
the journey and to share the community curriculum from GA with a greater 
audience.
Brad, I wish we had saved the napkin we were drawing on at the Tipping Point 
cocktail event on community frameworks; it would have proven to be a great 
artifact. Thank you for suggesting I had a lot to share and for giving me a ton 
of rope to do so in the GA community over the past several years. It’s been 
an amazingly fulfilling journey!
Shirley, one of my very first students at General Assembly, I’m so proud of the 
work that you did building out the community and customer support strategy 
for Quirky. It’s hard to believe that the first GA experimental “course” on 
community resulted in such an amazing collaboration. It’s been an absolute

pleasure working with you over the years. You’ve been with me since the 
inception of this book and every step along the way, and you’ve been an 
amazing partner and a crucial validating board (and sanity check) through this 
process. #braincrush
Whitney, you are the most operational-minded creative that I have met to 
date. I have tremendous respect and gratitude for what you bring to the Perks 
team in constantly supporting and challenging our bias toward action. Your 
help on the home stretch of this project, like so many others, was essential 
to delivering the final output. A massive thank-you for your always-on bias 
toward action!
Janine, a gal couldn’t ask for a better thought partner! You’ve added so much 
to the secret sauce at Perks, not only in developing our methodologies and 
frameworks but also in bringing them to life onsite both for clients and for 
the greater business and brand community in our teaching work and projects 
such as this one. Your critical eye and constant consideration to aligning all 
initiatives to the greater organizational goals and outcomes is clutch! Your 
dedication to and support of continuing to elevate the role of community and 
audience for the benefit of the brand and the business brings our organizational 
design model to life.
Chris Agnos, a massive thank-you for being on my team from Day One at Perks 
and for all of your support through the company’s journey in the last seven 
years. I don’t know if I would have made it through the early years without your 
operational rigor. Your critical yet curious nature is certainly what took a failed 
agency project with our @sustainablegal and @sustainableman hypothesis 
into a thriving sustainable community on Facebook. It’s been amazing to see 
a technical and operational lead like you dive into the customer discovery 
and validation work that you’ve done with Sustainable Man to make it the 
homegrown success it has become with your million-plus followers. 
Barbara, a gal couldn’t ask for a better friend to get into the data weeds 
with! You always help pull the insights and the stories out of every initiative. 
I look forward to continuing to build out performance measurement and 
benchmarking frameworks, tools, and approaches to support the core 
disciplines delivering value to the end audience across the brand, community, 
marketing, and product suite.
To the entire Perks Consulting team, you’ve all poured more into this project 
than we ever imagined possible or necessary. Emily, you got me through more 
than a few bumps along the way. Evan, your research and reading evaluations 
made this book a better resource for new community managers. Sara, your 
honesty and energy is something every community needs—I’m lucky to 
have you as a strategic partner! Priscila, Patricia, and Evelyn, each of you have 
brought your talents to bear to get this project to market.

To the CMX community and its stewards, David and Carrie, the mission 
you’re on to elevate the role of community managers is an important one, and 
it couldn’t be in better hands! Thank you for inviting and involving me in this 
community of community pros. It is unlike any community I’ve ever belonged 
to and is truly one of the most supportive and genuine groups I’ve had the 
pleasure to be part of. I’m honored by your support and for helping share my 
work. I look forward to a long and fruitful collaboration.
