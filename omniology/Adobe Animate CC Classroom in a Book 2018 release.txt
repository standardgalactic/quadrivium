Getting Started
The 2018 release of Adobe Animate CC provides a comprehensive authoring
environment for creating sophisticated animations and interactive, media-rich
applications that you can publish to a variety of platforms. Animate CC is widely
used in the creative industry to develop engaging projects integrating video,
sound, graphics, and animation. You can create original content in Animate CC
or import assets from other Adobe applications such as Photoshop CC or
Illustrator CC, quickly design animation and multimedia, and use code to
integrate sophisticated interactivity.
Use Animate CC to generate graphics and animation assets, to build innovative
and immersive websites, to create stand-alone applications for the desktop, or to
create apps to distribute to mobile devices running on the Android or iOS
system.
With extensive controls for animation, intuitive and flexible drawing tools, and
output options for HD video, HTML5, WebGL, SVG, mobile apps, desktop
applications, and Flash Player, Adobe Animate CC is a robust multimedia
authoring environment that enables your imagination to become reality.
About Classroom in a Book
Adobe Animate CC Classroom in a Book (2018 release) is part of the official
training series for Adobe graphics and publishing software developed with the
support of Adobe product experts. The lessons are designed so you can learn at
your own pace. If you’re new to Animate, you’ll learn the fundamental concepts
and features you’ll need to use the program. Classroom in a Book also teaches
many advanced features, including tips and techniques for using the latest
version of this application.
Although each lesson provides step-by-step instructions for creating a specific
project, there’s room for exploration and experimentation. You can follow the
book from start to finish or do only the lessons that correspond to your interests
and needs. Each lesson concludes with review questions to reinforce what
you’ve learned.
What’s New
The 2018 release of Adobe Animate CC provides more expressive tools,
powerful controls for animation, and robust support for a wider variety of

playback platforms.
The lessons in this book provide opportunities to use some of the updated
features and improvements in Animate CC, including
A new Layer Depth panel that allows you to establish a realistic sense of
space by changing the depth level of individual layers
The ability to fix individual layers to the camera to keep them from being
affected by the camera movement
Improvements to the Camera tool, which puts you in the director’s chair
to frame the action with camera moves such as zooming and panning
Timeline enhancements, including easier ways to navigate between
keyframes, scrub through the animation, and display both second and
frame-number markers
Property-level eases for classic tweens
An integrated wizard in the Actions panel so that you can quickly and
easily add JavaScript code into your HTML5 Canvas document

How to Use the Lessons
Each lesson in this book provides step-by-step instructions for creating one or

more specific elements of a real-world project. Some lessons build on projects
created in preceding lessons; most stand alone. All the lessons build on one
another in terms of concepts and skills, so the best way to learn from this book is
to proceed through the lessons in sequential order. In this book, some techniques
and processes are explained and described in detail only the first few times you
perform them.
You will create and publish final project files, such as SWF files, HTML files,
videos, or AIR desktop applications, in some lessons in this book. The files in
the End folders (01End, 02End, and so on) within the Lesson folders are samples
of completed projects for each lesson. Use these files for reference if you want to
compare your work in progress with the project files used to generate the sample
projects.
The organization of the lessons is also project-oriented rather than feature-
oriented. That means, for example, that you’ll work with symbols on real-world
design projects over several lessons rather than in just one chapter.

1. Getting Acquainted
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Create a new file in Adobe Animate CC
Adjust Stage settings and document properties
Add layers to the Timeline
Understand and manage keyframes in the Timeline
Work with imported images in the Library panel
Move and reposition objects on the Stage
Open and work with panels
Select and use tools in the Tools panel
Preview your animation
Save your file
This lesson will take less than 1 hour to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

In Animate, the Stage is where you lay out all your visual elements, the
Timeline organizes frames and layers, and other panels let you edit and
control your creation.
Starting Adobe Animate CC and Opening a File
The first time you start Adobe Animate CC you’ll see a Welcome screen with
links to standard file templates, tutorials, and other resources. In this lesson,
you’ll create a simple slideshow-type animation to showcase a few vacation
snapshots. You’ll add a background, photos, and some decorative elements, and
in the process you’ll learn about positioning elements on the Stage and placing
them along the Timeline so they appear one at a time, in sequence. You’ll begin

learning how to use the Stage to organize your visual elements spatially, and
how to use the Timeline to organize your elements temporally.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page on peachpit.com, make
sure to do so now. See “Getting Started” at the beginning of the
book.
 Tip
You can also start Animate by double-clicking an Animate file (*.fla
or *.xfl), such as the 01End.fla file that is provided to show you the
completed project.
1. Start Adobe Animate CC. In Windows, choose Start > Programs >
Adobe Animate CC. On a Mac, double-click Adobe Animate CC in the
Adobe Animate CC folder in the Applications folder.
2. Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, select the 01End.fla file in
the Lesson01/01End folder and click Open to see the final project.
3. Choose File > Publish.
Animate creates the necessary files to play in the target platform. In this
example, the HTML5 Canvas Document creates an HTML file, a
JavaScript file, and a folder of images to display the final animation in a
browser. The files are saved in the same folder as your Animate
document.
 Note
When launching Adobe Animate CC for the first time, you
may be asked to sync settings with Creative Cloud. Choose
Disable Sync Settings. Synchronizing settings with CC
enables you to save your application and workspace
preferences across multiple computers.
4. Double-click the HTML file.
An animation plays. During the animation, several overlapping photos

appear one by one, with stars appearing at the end.
 Note
The Output panel will display a warning saying that the
bitmaps were packed into a spritesheet and that EaselJS is
starting frame numbers at 0 instead of 1. You can ignore
both warnings. The first is just a notification, and the
second is irrelevant because you are playing the Timeline
straight from beginning to end.
5. Close the browser.
Creating a new document
You’ll create the simple animation that you just previewed by starting a new
document.
1. In Animate, choose File > New.
The New Document dialog box opens.

2. Under the General tab, choose the first option, HTML5 Canvas.
The other options target different playback technologies. For example,
WebGL is a document type for animation that takes advantage of
hardware-accelerated support for graphics. ActionScript 3.0 is a
document type that targets the Flash Player. AIR for Android and AIR
for iOS are documents configured to play as apps on an Android or
Apple mobile device. AIR for Desktop targets documents for playback
as stand-alone programs on Windows or Mac desktop computers.
3. On the right side of the dialog box, you can choose the dimensions of
the Stage by entering new pixel values for the Width and Height. Enter
800 for Width and 600 for Height. Keep the Ruler Units as Pixels.
Leave the Frame Rate and Background Color for the Stage at their
default settings. You can always edit these document properties, as
explained later in this lesson.

4. Click OK.
Animate creates a new HTML5 Canvas document with all the specified
settings.
5. Choose File > Save. Name the file 01_workingcopy.fla, and from the
File Format/Save As Type menu, choose Animate document (*.fla).
Although the software application is called Animate, be aware that the
file extension is .fla or .xfl, which both preserve echoes of the name of
the ancestor of Animate: “Flash.”
Save it in the 01Start folder. Saving your file right away is a good
working habit that ensures your work won’t be lost if the application or
your computer crashes. You should always save your Animate file with
the extension .fla (or .xfl if you save it as an Animate Uncompressed
Document) to identify it as the Animate source file.
Understanding Document Types
Adobe Animate CC is an animation and multimedia authoring tool that creates
media for multiple platforms and playback technologies. Knowing where your
final animation will play determines what type of document you’ll choose as a
new file.
 Note
Not all features are supported across all document types. For
example, WebGL documents don’t support text, and HTML5
Canvas documents don’t support the 3D Rotation or Translation
tool. Unsupported tools are grayed out.
Playback environment
The playback, or runtime, environment is the technology that your final,
published files use to play. Your animation could play in a browser with the
Flash Player, or they could play in a browser with HTML5 and JavaScript.
Perhaps your animation will be exported as an HD video to be uploaded to
YouTube. Or your project could play as an app on a mobile device. You should
make that decision first so you can choose the appropriate document type.
 Note
This latest version of Animate CC supports only ActionScript 3.0. If

you need ActionScript 1.0 or 2.0, you must work with Flash
Professional CS6 or lower.
Regardless of the playback environment and document type, all document types
are saved as FLA or XFL (Animate) files. The difference is that each document
type is configured to export different, final published files.
Choose HTML5 Canvas to create animated assets that play back in a
modern browser using HTML5 and JavaScript. You can add interactivity
by inserting JavaScript within Animate CC or adding it to the final
published files.
Choose WebGL for pure animated assets to take advantage of hardware-
accelerated support of graphics.
Choose ActionScript 3.0 to create animation and interactivity that plays in
the Flash Player in a desktop browser. ActionScript 3.0 is the latest
version of the native scripting language in Animate, which is similar to
JavaScript. Choosing an ActionScript 3.0 document doesn’t mean you
have to include ActionScript code. It simply means that your playback
target is the Flash Player.
 Note
The ActionScript 3.0 document also supports publishing
content as a projector for either Mac or Windows. A projector
plays as a stand-alone application on the desktop, without
needing a browser.
Be aware that Adobe will no longer back the Flash Player in browsers
beyond 2020. Despite this impending end-of-life date for the Flash Player,
it’s best to think of an ActionScript 3.0 document as one that supports the
widest range of drawing and animation features in Animate from which
you can ultimately export animation assets, such as spritesheets or PNG
sequences, or finished high-definition video.
Choose AIR for Desktop to create animation and interactivity that plays
as an application on Windows or Mac desktops, without needing a
browser. You can add interactivity in an AIR document using
ActionScript 3.0.
Choose AIR for Android or AIR for iOS to publish an app for an Android

or an Apple mobile device. You can add interactivity for your mobile app
using ActionScript 3.0.
 Tip
You can easily switch from one document type to another. For
example, you can convert an ActionScript 3.0 document into an
HTML5 Canvas document if you have an old Flash banner ad
animation that you want to update. Use Commands > Convert To
Other Document Formats or File > Convert To to choose a new
document type. Some functionality and features may be lost in the
conversion, however. For example, conversion to an HTML5
Canvas document will comment out ActionScript code.
Getting to Know the Workspace
The Adobe Animate CC work area includes the command menus at the top of
the screen and a variety of tools and panels for editing and adding elements to
your movie. You can create all the objects for your animation in Animate, or you
can import elements you’ve created in Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop,
Adobe After Effects, or other compatible applications.
By default, Animate displays the menu bar, Timeline, Stage, Tools panel,
Properties panel, Edit bar, and a few other panels. As you work in Animate, you
can open, close, group, ungroup, dock, undock, and move panels around the
screen to fit your work style or your screen resolution.

Choosing a new workspace
Animate also provides a few preset panel arrangements (“workspaces”) that may
better suit the needs of particular users. Use the Window > Workspaces submenu
to choose a different workspace or to save a new one. The same functionality is
provided by the workspace switcher at the right end of the Application bar.
1. Click the workspace switcher and choose a new workspace.
The various panels are rearranged and resized according to their
importance in the chosen workspace. For example, the Animator and
Designer workspaces put the Timeline at the top for easy and frequent
access.

2. If you have moved some of the panels around and want to return to one
of the prearranged workspaces, choose Window > Workspaces > Reset
[preset name] and click OK in the confirmation dialog box.
3. To return to the default workspace, choose Window > Workspaces >
Essentials. In this Classroom in a Book, we’ll be using the Essentials
workspace.
Saving your workspace
If you find an arrangement of panels that suits your style of work, you can save
it as a custom workspace and return to it at a later date.
1. Open the workspace switcher and choose New Workspace.
The New Workspace dialog box appears.
2. Enter a name for your new workspace. Click OK.
Animate saves the current arrangement of panels and adds it to the
options in the Workspace menu, which you can access at any time.

 Tip
By default, the Animate interface is dark. However, you can change
the interface to a lighter gray if you prefer. Choose Edit >
Preferences (Windows) or Animate CC > Preferences (Mac), and in
the General preferences category, choose Light from the User
Interface menu.
About the Stage
The big white rectangle in the middle of your screen is called the Stage. As with
a theater stage, the Stage in Animate is the area that viewers see when a movie is
playing. It contains the text, images, and video that appear on the screen. Move
elements on and off the Stage to place them in and out of view. You can use the
rulers (View > Rulers) or grids (View > Grid > Show Grid) to help you position
items on the Stage. Additionally, you can pull guides from the ruler (View >
Guides) or use the Align panel and other tools you’ll learn about in later lessons
in this book.
By default, you’ll see the gray area off the Stage where you can place elements
that won’t be visible to your audience. The gray area is called the pasteboard. To
see only the Stage, choose View > Magnification > Clip To Stage to select the
option. For now, leave the option to view the pasteboard selected.
You can also click the Clip Content Outside The Stage button to crop the graphic
elements that fall beyond the Stage area to see how your audience will view your
final project.

Default Stage
Stage with Clip Content Outside The Stage selected
To scale the Stage so that it fits completely in the application window, choose
View > Magnification > Fit In Window. You can also choose different
magnification view options from the menu just above the Stage.

 Tip
You can view the Stage in full-screen mode without the distraction
of the various panels by choosing View > Screen Mode > Full
Screen Mode. Use F4 to toggle the panels, and press the Esc key to
return to Standard Screen Mode.
Changing the Stage properties
Now you’ll change the color of the Stage. The Stage color, along with document
properties such as the Stage dimensions and frame rate, is available in the
Properties panel, which is the vertical panel just to the right of the Stage.
1. In the Properties pane of the Properties panel, note that the dimensions
of the current Stage are set at 800 x 600 pixels, which you chose when
you created the new document.

2. Also in the Properties pane, click the Background Color box next to
Stage: and choose a new color from the color palette. Choose dark gray
(#333333).
Your Stage is now a different color. You can change the Stage properties
at any time.
Working with the Library Panel
The Library panel is accessible from a tab just to the right of the Properties
panel. The Library panel is where you store and organize symbols created in
Animate, as well as imported files, including bitmaps, graphics, sound files, and
certain video clips. Symbols are graphics used frequently for animation and for

interactivity.
 Note
You’ll learn much more about symbols in Lesson 3.
About the Library panel
The Library panel lets you organize library items in folders, see how often an
item is used in a document, and sort items by type. When you import items into
Animate, you can import them directly onto the Stage or into the library.
However, any item you import onto the Stage is also added to the library, as are
any symbols you create. You can then easily access the items to add them to the
Stage again, edit them, or see their properties.
To display the Library panel, choose Window > Library, or press Ctrl+L
(Windows) or Command+L (Mac).
 Tip
You can also access the assets that you’ve stored in your Creative
Cloud account by clicking the CC Libraries icon (Window > CC
Libraries).
Importing an item to the Library panel
Often, you’ll create graphics directly with the drawing tools in Animate and save
them as symbols, which are stored in the library. Other times you’ll import
media such as JPEG images or MP3 sound files, which are also stored in the
library. In this lesson, you’ll import several images into the library to be used in
the animation.
1. Choose File > Import > Import To Library. In the Import To Library
dialog box, select the background.png file in the Lesson01/01Start
folder, and click Open.
Animate imports the selected PNG image and places it in the Library
panel.
2. Continue importing photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, and photo3.jpg from the
01Start folder.
You can also hold down the Shift key to select multiple files and import
all of the images at once.

The Library panel displays all the imported images with their filenames
and a thumbnail preview. These images are now available to be used in
your Animate document.
Adding an item from the Library panel to the Stage
To use an imported image, simply drag it from the Library panel onto the Stage.
1. Choose Window > Library to open the Library panel if it isn’t already
open.
2. Select the background.png item in the Library panel.
3. Drag the background.png item onto the Stage and place it approximately
in the center of the Stage.
 Tip
You can also choose File > Import > Import To Stage, or
press Ctrl+R (Windows) or Command+R (Mac), to import

an image file to the library and put it on the Stage all in one
step.
Understanding the Timeline
In the default Essentials workspace, the Timeline is located below the Stage. As
do films, Animate documents measure time in frames. As the movie plays, the
playhead, shown as a red vertical line, advances through the frames in the
Timeline. You can change the content on the Stage for different frames. To
display a frame’s content on the Stage for any particular time, move the playhead
to that frame in the Timeline. The frame number, as well as the time in seconds,
is always displayed above the Timeline.
At the bottom of the Timeline, Animate indicates the selected frame number, the
current frame rate (how many frames play per second), and the time that has
elapsed so far in the movie.
The Timeline also contains layers, which help you organize the artwork in your
document. At the moment, your project has only one layer, which is called Layer
1. Think of layers as multiple film strips stacked on top of one another. Each
layer can contain a different image that appears on the Stage, and you can draw
and edit objects on one layer without affecting objects on another layer. The
layers are stacked in the order in which they overlap each other so that objects
on the bottom layer in the Timeline are on the bottom of the stack on the Stage.
You can hide, lock, or show the contents of layers as outlines by clicking the
dots in the layer under the layer option icons.

Changing the appearance of the Timeline
You can adjust the Timeline’s appearance to accommodate your
workflow. When you want to see more layers, choose Short from
the Frame View menu in the upperright corner of the Timeline. The
Short option decreases the height of frame cell rows. The Preview
and Preview In Context options display thumbnail versions of the
contents of your keyframes in the Timeline.
You can also change the width of the frame cells by choosing Tiny,
Small, Normal, Medium, or Large. In this book, we show the
Timeline frames in their default size of Normal.
For finer control over the Timeline frame sizes, drag the Resize
Timeline View slider. The slider adjusts the size of the frames so
you can see more or less of the Timeline. Click the Reset Timeline
Zoom To The Default Level button to revert the Timeline view to its

Normal size.
Renaming a layer
It’s a good idea to separate your content on different layers and name each layer
to indicate its contents so that you can easily find the layer you need later.
1. Select the existing layer in the Timeline, called Layer 1.
2. Double-click the name of the layer to rename it, and type background.
3. Click outside the name box to apply the new name.
4. Click the dot below the lock icon to lock the layer. Locking a layer
prevents you from accidentally moving or making changes to whatever
is inside that layer.
A lock icon appears in the layer. The lock icon indicates that you can’t
make edits to the layer because it is locked.
Adding a layer
A new Animate document contains only one layer, but you can add as many
layers as you need. Objects in the top layers will overlap objects in the bottom
layers.
1. Select the background layer in the Timeline.
2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer. You can also click the New Layer
button below the Timeline. A new layer appears above the background
layer.

3. Double-click the new layer to rename it, and type photo1. Click outside
the name box to apply the new name.
Your Timeline now has two layers. The background layer contains the
background photo, and the newly created photo1 layer above it is empty.
4. Select the top layer, called photo1.
5. Choose Window > Library to open the Library panel if it isn’t already
open.
6. Drag the library item called photo1.jpg from the library onto the Stage.
The photo1 JPEG appears on the Stage and overlaps the background
image.

7. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer, or click the New Layer button (
)
below the Timeline, to add a third layer.
8. Rename the third layer photo2.

 Note
As you add more layers and your overlapping graphics
become more complicated, click the dot below the eye icon
in your layer to hide the contents of any layer. Alternatively,
hold down the Shift key and click the dot below the eye
icon to make the layer transparent so you can see what’s
below it. Hiding or making a layer transparent affects only
how you see your project in Animate—it doesn’t affect
your final exported project. Double-click the Layer icon to
modify the level of transparency in the Layer Properties
dialog box.
Working with layers
If you don’t want a layer, you can easily delete it by selecting it and
then clicking the Delete button below the Timeline.
If you want to rearrange your layers and change how your graphics
overlap each other, simply drag any layer to move it to a new
position in the layer stack.
Inserting frames
So far, you have a background photo and another overlapping photo on the
Stage, but your entire animation exists for only a single frame, which is only a
fraction of a second. To create more time on the Timeline and make this
animation run for a longer duration, you must add additional frames.

1. Select frame 48 in the background layer. Use the Resize Timeline View
slider at the bottom-right corner of the Timeline to expand the Timeline
frames to make it easier to identify frame 48.
2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5). You can also right-click and
choose Insert Frame from the context menu that pops up.
Animate adds frames in the background layer up to the selected frame,
frame 48.
3. Select frame 48 in the photo1 layer.
4. Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5). You can also right-click and
choose Insert Frame from the menu.
Animate adds frames in the photo1 layer up to the selected frame, frame
48.
5. Select frame 48 in the photo2 layer and insert frames on this layer.
You now have three layers, all with 48 frames on the Timeline. Since the frame
rate of your Animate document is 24 frames per second, your current animation
lasts 2 seconds.
Selecting multiple frames
Just as you can hold down the Shift key to select multiple files on

your desktop, you can hold down the Shift key to select multiple
frames on the Animate Timeline. If you have several layers and
want to insert frames into all of them, hold down the Shift key and
drag where you want to add frames. Then choose Insert > Timeline
> Frame.
Creating a keyframe
A keyframe indicates a change in content on the Stage. Keyframes are indicated
on the Timeline as a circle. An empty circle means there is nothing in that
particular layer at that particular time. A filled-in black circle means there is
something in that particular layer at that particular time. The background layer,
for example, contains a filled keyframe (black circle) in the first frame. The
photo1 layer also contains a filled keyframe in its first frame. Both layers contain
photos. The photo2 layer, however, contains an empty keyframe in the first
frame, indicating that it is currently empty.
You’ll insert a keyframe in the photo2 layer at the point in time when you want
the next photo to appear.
1. Select frame 24 on the photo2 layer. As you select a frame, Animate
displays the frame number beneath the Timeline.
2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
A new keyframe, indicated by an empty circle, appears in the photo2

layer in frame 24.
3. Select the new keyframe at frame 24 in the photo2 layer.
4. Drag photo2.jpg from your library onto the Stage.
The empty circle at frame 24 becomes filled, indicating that there is now
content in the photo2 layer. At frame 24, your photo appears on the
Stage. You can drag the red playhead from the top of the Timeline to
“scrub,” or show what’s happening on the Stage, at any point along the
Timeline. You’ll see that the background photo and photo1 remain on
the Stage throughout the Timeline, but photo2 appears only at frame 24.

Understanding frames and keyframes is essential for mastering Animate. Be sure
you understand how the photo2 layer contains 48 frames with two keyframes—
an empty keyframe at frame 1 and a filled keyframe at frame 24.

Moving a keyframe
If you want photo2.jpg to appear later or earlier in time, you need to move the
keyframe in which it appears closer to or farther from the right on the Timeline.
You can easily move any keyframe along the Timeline by simply selecting it and
then dragging it to a new position.
1. Select the keyframe in frame 24 on the photo2 layer.
2. Move your mouse cursor slightly, and you’ll see a box icon appear near
your cursor indicating that you can reposition the keyframe.
3. Drag the keyframe to frame 12 in the photo2 layer.
The photo2.jpg file now appears on the Stage much earlier in the
animation.
Removing keyframes
If you want to remove a keyframe, do not press the
Delete/Backspace key! Doing so will delete the contents of that
keyframe on the Stage, leaving you with an empty keyframe.
Instead, select the keyframe and choose Modify > Timeline > Clear
Keyframe (Shift+F6). Your keyframe (and its contents) will be

removed from the Timeline.
Organizing Layers in a Timeline
At this point, your working Animate file has only three layers: a background
layer, a photo1 layer, and a photo2 layer. You’ll be adding additional layers for
this project, and as in most other projects, you’ll end up having to manage
multiple layers. Layer folders help you group related layers to keep your
Timeline organized and manageable, just like you make folders for related
documents on your desktop. Although it may take some time to create the
folders, you’ll save time later because you’ll know exactly where to look for a
specific layer.
Creating layer folders
For this project, you’ll continue to add layers for additional photos, and you’ll
place those layers in a layer folder.
1. Select the photo2 layer and click the New Layer button at the bottom of
the Timeline.
2. Name the layer photo3.
3. Insert a keyframe at frame 24.
4. Drag photo3.jpg from the library onto the Stage.
You now have four layers. The top three contain photos of scenes from
Coney Island that appear at different keyframes.

5. Select the photo3 layer and click the New Folder icon at the bottom of
the Timeline (
).
A new layer folder appears above the photo3 layer.
6. Name the folder photos.

Adding layers to layer folders
Now you’ll add the photo layers to the photos folder. As you arrange layers,
remember that Animate displays the content in the layers in the order in which
they appear in the Timeline, with the top layer’s content at the front and the
bottom layer’s content at the back.
1. Drag the photo1 layer into the photos folder.
Notice how the bold line indicates the destination of your layer. When
you place a layer inside a folder, Animate indents the layer name.
2. Drag the photo2 layer into the photos folder.
3. Drag the photo3 layer into the photos folder.

All three photo layers should be in the photos folder, in the same
stacking order as they were outside the folder.
You can collapse the folder by clicking the arrow just to the left of the folder
name. Expand the folder by clicking the arrow again. Be aware that if you delete
a layer folder, you delete all the layers inside that folder as well.
Cut, copy, paste, and duplicate layers
When managing multiple layers and layer folders, you can rely on
cut, copy, paste, and duplicate layer commands to make your
workflow easier and more efficient. All the properties of the
selected layer are copied and pasted, including its frames, its
keyframes, any animation, and even the layer name and type. You
can also copy and paste layer folders and their contents.
To cut or copy any layer or layer folder, simply select the layer and
right-click the layer name. In the menu that appears, choose Cut
Layers or Copy Layers.
Right-click the Timeline again and choose Paste Layers. The layer
or layers that you cut or copied are pasted into the Timeline. Use

Duplicate Layers to copy and paste in one operation.
You can also cut, copy, paste, or duplicate layers from the
application menu bar. Choose Edit > Timeline, and then choose Cut
Layers, Copy Layers, Paste Layers, or Duplicate Layers.
Using the Properties Panel
The Properties panel gives you quick access to the attributes you’re most likely
to need. What appears in the Properties panel depends on what you’ve selected.
For example, if nothing is selected, the Properties panel includes options for the
general Animate document, including changing the Stage color or dimensions. If
you’ve selected an object on the Stage, the Properties panel shows its x and y
coordinates and its width and height, among other information. You’ll use the
Properties panel to move your photos on the Stage.
Positioning an object on the Stage
You’ll begin by moving the photos with the Properties panel. You’ll also use the
Transform panel to rotate the photos.
 Tip
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window > Properties, or
press Ctrl+F3 (Windows) or Command+F3 (Mac).
1. At frame 1 of the Timeline, select the photo1.jpg image that you
dragged onto the Stage in the photo1 layer. A blue outline indicates that
the object is selected.
2. In the Properties panel, type 50 for the X value and 50 for the Y value.
Press Enter (Windows)/Return (Mac) to apply the values. You can also
drag over the X and Y values to change their values. The photo moves
to the left side of the Stage.

The X and Y values are measured on the Stage from the top-left corner.
X begins at 0 and increases to the right, and Y begins at 0 and increases
downward. The registration point (the point from which Animate makes
measurements) for imported photos is at the top-left corner.
3. Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel.
4. In the Transform panel, select Rotate, and type -12 in the Rotate box, or
drag over the value to change the rotation. Press Enter
(Windows)/Return (Mac) to apply the value.
The selected photo on the Stage rotates 12 degrees counterclockwise.

5. Select frame 12 of the photo2 layer. Now click photo2.jpg on the Stage
to select it.
6. Use the Properties panel and Transform panel to position and rotate the
second photo in an interesting way. Use X=200, Y=40, and a Rotate of 6
to give it some contrast with the first photo.

7. Select frame 24 in the photo3 layer. Now click photo3.jpg on the Stage
to select it.
8. Use the Properties panel and Transform panel to position and rotate the
third photo in an interesting way. Use X=360, Y=65, and a Rotate of -2
so that all your photos have visual variety.

 Note
When images are scaled or rotated in Animate, they may appear
jagged. You can smooth each image by double-clicking the bitmap
icon in the Library panel. In the Bitmap Properties dialog box that
appears, select the Allow Smoothing option.
Working with panels
Just about everything you do in Animate involves a panel. In this
lesson, you use the Library panel, Tools panel, Properties panel,
Transform panel, History panel, and the Timeline. In later lessons,
you’ll learn to use other panels to control various aspects of your
project. Because panels are such an integral part of the Animate
workspace, it pays to know how to manage them.
To open any panel in Animate, choose its name from the Window
menu.

Individual panels float freely, and they can be combined in docks,
groups, or stacks.
A dock is a collection of panels or panel groups in a vertical
column. Docks stick to the left or right edges of the user
interface.
A group is a collection of panels that can be placed within a
dock or can float freely.
A stack is similar to a dock but can be placed anywhere in the

interface.
In the default Essentials workspace, most of the panels are
organized in three docks on the right side of the screen. The
Timeline and Output panels are grouped at the bottom, and the
Stage is on the top. However, you can move a panel to any position
that is convenient for you.
To move a panel, drag it by its tab to a new location.
To move a panel group or stack, drag it by the area next to the
tabs.
As the panel, group, or stack passes over other panels, groups,
docks, or stacks, a blue highlighted drop zone will appear. If you
release the mouse button while a drop zone is visible, the panel will
be added to the group, dock, or stack.
To dock a panel, drag it by its tab into a new position at the left
or right edge of the screen. If you drag it over the top or bottom
of an existing dock, a horizontal drop zone will show you the
panel’s new location. If a vertical drop zone appears, dropping
the panel will create a new dock.
To group a panel, drag its tab onto the tab of another panel or the
drop zone at the top of an existing group.
To create a stack, drag a group out of a dock or an existing stack
so it floats freely. Alternatively, drag one free-floating panel
onto the tab of another floating panel.
You also have the option of displaying most of the panels as icons to
save space but still maintain quick access. Click the double
arrowheads in the top-right corner of a dock or stack to collapse the
panels to icons. Click the double arrowheads again to expand the
icons into panels.
Using the Tools Panel
The Tools panel—the long, narrow panel on the far right side of the work area—
contains selection tools, drawing and type tools, painting and editing tools,
navigation tools, and tool options. You’ll use the Tools panel frequently to
switch to tools designed for the task at hand. Most often, you’ll use the Selection
tool, which is the black arrow tool at the top of the Tools panel, for selecting and
clicking items on the Stage or the Timeline. When you select a tool, check the

options area at the bottom of the panel for more options and other settings
appropriate for your task.
Selecting and using a tool
When you select a tool, the options available at the bottom of the Tools panel
and the Properties panel change. For example, when you select the Rectangle
tool, the Object Drawing Mode and Snap To Objects options appear. When you
select the Zoom tool, the Enlarge and Reduce options appear.

The Tools panel contains too many tools to display all at once. Some tools are

arranged in hidden groups in the Tools panel; only the tool you last selected from
a group is displayed. A small triangle in the lower-right corner of the tool’s
button indicates that there are other tools in the group. Click and hold the icon
for the visible tool to see the other tools available, and then select one from the
menu.
You’ll use the PolyStar tool to add a little decoration to your short animation.
1. Select the folder in the Timeline, and then click the New Layer button.
2. Name the new layer stars.
3. Lock the other layers below it so you don’t accidentally move anything
into them.
4. In the Timeline, move the playhead to frame 36 and select frame 36 in
the stars layer.
5. Choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6) to insert a new keyframe at
frame 36 in the stars layer.
 Note
If you’re working with a smaller dfig01_043a.jpgisplay, the
bottom of the Tools panel may be cut off. That makes some
of the tools and buttons invisible. But there’s an easy way to
fix the problem: drag the left edge of the Tools panel to
widen it so it can show multiple columns of tools.

You will create star shapes to appear at frame 36 in this layer.
6. In the Tools panel, select the PolyStar tool, which is indicated by the
hexagon shape.
7. In the Properties panel, click the colored square next to the pencil icon,
which indicates the color of the outline, or stroke, and choose the red
diagonal line.
The red diagonal line represents a color of None for the stroke.
8. Click the colored square next to the paint bucket icon, which indicates
the color of the fill, and choose a bright, cheery color such as yellow.
You can click the color wheel at the upper right to access the Adobe
Color Picker, or you can change the Alpha percentage, which
determines the level of transparency, at the upper right.

9. In the Properties panel, click the Options buttons under Tool Settings.
The Tool Settings dialog box appears.
10. For Style, choose star. For Number Of Sides, enter 5, and for Star Point
Size, enter 0.5. Click OK.
The options determine the shape of your star.
11. Make sure the empty keyframe in frame 36 of the title layer is selected.
Click on the Stage where you want to begin adding a star, and drag to
change the width of your star. Move your cursor around the first click to
rotate the star. Make multiple stars of different sizes and with different
angles of rotation.

12. Exit the PolyStar tool by selecting the Selection tool.
13. Use the Properties panel or the Transform panel to reposition or rotate
your stars on the Stage, if desired. Or choose the Selection tool and
simply click to select a star and drag it to a new position on the Stage.
The X and Y values in the Properties panel update as you drag the star
around the Stage.
14. Your animation for this lesson is finished! Compare the Timeline in
your file with the Timeline in the final file, 01End.fla.
Undoing Steps in Animate
In a perfect world, everything would go according to plan. But sometimes you
need to move back a step or two and start over. You can undo steps in Animate
using the Undo command or the History panel.
To undo a single step in Animate, choose Edit > Undo or press Ctrl+Z
(Windows)/Command+Z (Mac). To redo a step you’ve undone, choose Edit >
Redo.
The easiest way to undo multiple steps in Animate is to use the History panel,
which displays a list of the last 100 steps you’ve performed. Closing a document
clears its history. To access the History panel, choose Window > History.
For example, if you aren’t satisfied with the newly added stars, you can undo

your work and return your Animate document to a previous state.
 Note
If you remove steps in the History panel and then perform
additional steps, the removed steps will no longer be available.
1. Choose Edit > Undo to undo the last action you made. You can choose
the Undo command multiple times to move backward as many steps as
are listed in the History panel. You can change the maximum number of
Undo commands by selecting Animate > Preferences.
2. Choose Window > History to open the History panel.
3. Drag the History panel slider up to the step just before your mistake.
Steps below that point are dimmed in the History panel and are removed
from the project. To add a step back, move the slider back down.
Previewing Your Movie
As you work on a project, it’s a good idea to preview it frequently to ensure that

you’re achieving the desired effect. To quickly see your animation, choose
Control > Play, or simply press the Enter/Return key.
To see how an animation or movie will appear to a viewer in its runtime
environment, choose Control > Test Movie > In Browser. You can also press
Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Command+Return (Mac) to preview your movie.
1. Choose Control > Test.
Animate creates the required published files in the same location as your
FLA file and opens and plays the animation in your default browser.
Animate automatically loops your movie in this preview mode.
If you don’t want the animation to loop when you test your movie, in
Animate choose File > Publish Settings, and deselect the Loop Timeline
option.

2. Close the browser window and return to Animate.
Modifying the Content and Stage
When you first started this lesson, you created a new file with the Stage set at
800 pixels by 600 pixels. However, your client may later tell you that they want
the animation in several different sizes to accommodate different layouts. For
example, they’d like to create a smaller version with a different aspect ratio for a
banner ad. Or they may want to create a version that will run on AIR for
Android devices, which has specific dimensions.
Fortunately, you can modify the Stage even after all your content is put in place.
When you change the Stage dimensions, Animate provides the option of scaling
the content with the Stage, automatically shrinking or enlarging all your content
proportionally.
Stage resizing and content scaling
You’ll create another version of this animated project with different Stage
dimensions. Choose File > Save to save the work you’ve done so far.
1. At the bottom of the Properties panel, note that the dimensions of the
current Stage are set at 800 x 600 pixels. Click the Advanced Settings
button in the Properties section.

The Document Settings dialog box appears.
2. In the Width and Height boxes, enter new pixel dimensions. Enter 400
for the Width and 300 for the Height.
You can click the link icon between the Width and Height fields to
constrain the proportions of the Stage. With the link icon selected,
changing one dimension will automatically change the other
proportionately.
3. Select the Scale Content option.
4. Leave the Anchor option as is.
The Anchor option lets you choose the origin from which your content
is resized, if the proportions of the new Stage are different.
5. Click OK.
Animate modifies the dimensions of the Stage and automatically resizes
all the content. If your new dimensions are not proportional to the
original size, Animate will resize everything to maximize the content to
fit. This means that if your new Stage size is wider than the original,

there’ll be extra Stage space to the right. If your new Stage size is taller
than the original, there’ll be extra Stage space on the bottom.
6. Choose File > Save As.
7. In the Save dialog box choose Animate Document (*.fla) from the File
Format menu, and name the file 01_workingcopy_resized.fla.
You now have two Animate files, identical in content but with different
Stage dimensions. Close this file and reopen 01_workingcopy.fla to
continue this lesson.
Saving Your Movie
A mantra in multimedia production is “Save early, save often.” Applications,
operating systems, and hardware crash more often than anyone wants, and at
unexpected and inconvenient times. You should always save your movie at
regular intervals to ensure that, if a crash does happen, you won’t have lost too
much of your time.
Animate can help alleviate much of the worry over lost work. The Auto-
Recovery feature creates a backup file in case of a crash.
 Note
If you have unsaved changes in your open document, Animate adds
an asterisk to the end of its filename at the top of the document
window as a friendly reminder.
Using Auto-Recovery for a backup
The Auto-Recovery feature is a preference set for the Animate application for all
documents.
The Auto-Recovery feature saves a backup file, so in case of a crash, you have
an alternate file to return to.
1. Choose Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Animate CC > Preferences
(Mac).
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Choose the General category from the left column.
3. Select the Auto-Recovery option, if it’s not already selected, and enter a
time (in minutes) for the interval at which Animate creates a backup
file.

4. Click OK.
If you make changes to your file but do not save it within the Auto-
Recovery interval, Animate creates a new file in the same location as
your FLA with RECOVER_ added to the beginning of the filename. The
file remains as long as the document is open. When you close the
document or when you quit Animate safely, the file is deleted.
 Note
To find out how to keep your copy of Animate CC up to
date and to learn about the many sources of help available
to you within Animate, see the “Getting Started” section at
the beginning of this book.

Review Answers
1 The Stage is the rectangular area viewers see when a movie is playing. It
contains the text, images, and video that appear on the screen. Objects that
you store on the pasteboard outside of the Stage do not appear in the movie.
2 A frame is used to measure time on the Timeline. A keyframe is represented

on the Timeline with a circle and indicates a change in content on the Stage.
3 Because there are too many tools to display at once in the Tools panel, some
tools are grouped, and only one tool in the group is displayed. (The tool you
most recently used is the one shown.) Small triangles appear on tool icons to
indicate that hidden tools are available. To select a hidden tool, click and hold
the tool icon for the tool that is shown, and then select the hidden tool from
the menu.
4 You can undo steps in Animate using the Undo command or the History panel.
To undo a single step at a time, choose Edit > Undo. To undo multiple steps at
once, drag the slider up in the History panel.

This lesson will take about two hours to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

You can use rectangles, ovals, lines, and custom art or pattern brushes to
create interesting, complex graphics and illustrations in Adobe Animate CC.
Edit their shapes and combine them with gradients, transparencies, text, and
filters for even greater expressive possibilities.
Getting Started
Start by viewing the finished movie to see the project you’ll be creating in this
lesson.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.

See Getting Started at the beginning of the book.
1. Double-click the 02End.html file in the Lesson02/02End folder to view
the final project in a browser.
The project is a simple static illustration for a banner ad. This illustration
is for Mug’s Coffee, a fictional cafe that’s promoting its store and coffee.
In this lesson, you’ll draw the shapes, modify them, and learn to
combine simple elements to create more complex visuals. You won’t
create any animation just yet. After all, you must learn to walk before
you can run! And learning to create and modify graphics is an important
step before doing any animation with Animate.
2. In Animate, choose File > New. In the New Document dialog box,
choose HTML5 Canvas.
3. On the right-hand side of the dialog box, make the Stage size 700 pixels
by 200 pixels, and make the color of the Stage a light brown by clicking
the icon next to Background Color and then clicking the #CC9966 color
swatch. Click OK.
4. Choose File > Save. Name the file 02_workingcopy.fla and save it in
the 02Start folder. Saving your file right away is a good working habit
(even if you’ve enabled the Auto-Recovery feature). It ensures that you
won’t lose your work if the application or your computer crashes.
Understanding Strokes and Fills
Every graphic in Animate starts with a shape. A shape consists of two
components: the fill, or the insides of the shape, and the stroke, or the outlines of
the shape. If you always keep these two components in mind, you’ll be well on
your way to creating beautiful and complicated visuals.
The fill and the stroke function independently of each other, so you can modify
or delete either without affecting the other. For example, you can create a

rectangle with a blue fill and a red stroke, and then later change the fill to purple
and delete the red stroke entirely. You’ll be left with a purple rectangle without
an outline. You can also move the fill or stroke independently, so if you want to
move the entire shape, make sure that you select both its fill and stroke.
Creating Shapes
Animate includes several drawing tools, which work in different drawing modes.
Many of your creations will begin with simple shapes such as rectangles and
ovals, so it’s important that you’re comfortable drawing them, modifying their
appearance, and applying fills and strokes.
You’ll begin by drawing the cup of coffee.
 Note
In Animate CC, as well as in HTML documents and in web design
and development in general, colors are often specified by
hexadecimal numbers. The six digits after the # sign represent the
red, green, and blue contributions to the color.
Using the Rectangle tool
The coffee cup is essentially a cylinder, which is a rectangle with an oval at the
top and an oval at the bottom. You’ll start by drawing the rectangular body. It’s
useful to break down complicated objects into their component parts to make
drawing them easier.
1. In the Tools panel, select the Rectangle tool (
). Make sure the Object
Drawing mode icon (
) is not selected.
2. Choose a stroke color ( ) and a fill color ( ) from the bottom of the
Tools panel. Choose #663300 (dark brown) for the stroke and #CC6600
(light brown) for the fill.
3. On the Stage, draw a rectangle that is a little taller than it is wide. You’ll
specify the exact size and position of the rectangle in step 6.

4. Select the Selection tool (
).
5. Drag the Selection tool around the entire rectangle to select its stroke
and its fill. When a shape is selected, Animate displays it with white
dots. You can also double-click a shape, and Animate will select both
the stroke and fill of the shape.
6. In the Properties panel, Position And Size section, enter 130 for the
width and 150 for the height. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) to
apply the values.
 Note
Even though we have set the color of the Stage to brown, many
figures in this chapter are set on a white background to enhance the
visibility of the tool or technique being described.
Using the Oval tool
Now you’ll create the opening at the top and the rounded bottom.
1. In the Tools panel, select the Oval tool.
2. Make sure the Snap To Objects button (
) is selected. This option
forces shapes that you draw on the Stage to snap to each other to ensure
that lines and corners connect to one another.
3. Drag from one side of the rectangle to the other to make an oval that

touches both sides. Snap to Objects makes the sides of the oval connect
to the sides of the rectangle.
4. Draw another oval near the bottom of the rectangle.
 Note
The last fill and stroke you used are applied to the next objects you
create, unless you change the settings before you draw.
Making Selections
To modify an object, you must first be able to select different parts of it. In
Animate, you can make selections using the Selection, Subselection, or Lasso
tool. Typically, you use the Selection tool to select an entire object or a section of
an object. The Subselection tool lets you select a specific point or line in an
object. With the Lasso tool, you can make a free-form selection.
Selecting strokes and fills
Now you’ll make the rectangle and ovals look more like a coffee cup. You’ll use
the Selection tool to delete unwanted strokes and fills.
1. In the Tools panel, select the Selection tool (
).

2. Click the fill above the top oval to select it.
The shape above the top oval is highlighted.
 Tip
If you press the Option or Alt key while moving one of the
control points, Animate scales the selected object relative to
its transformation point, represented by the circle icon. You
can move the transformation point anywhere, even outside
the object. Press Shift to constrain the object proportions.
Hold Ctrl/Command to distort the object from a single
control point.
3. Press the Backspace (Windows)/Delete (Mac) key.
The fill is cleared from the selected area.
4. Shift-click each of the three line segments above the top oval to select
them all and press Backspace/Delete.

Animate deletes the individual strokes, leaving the top oval connected to
the rectangle.
5. Now Shift-select the fill and strokes below the bottom oval, as well the
oval’s upper arc (which represents the inside of the bottom of the cup),
and press Backspace/Delete.
The remaining shape appears as a cylinder.
Editing Shapes
When drawing in Animate, you’ll often start with the Rectangle and Oval tools.
But to create more complex graphics, you’ll use other tools to modify those base
shapes. The Free Transform tool, the Copy and Paste commands, and the
Selection tool can help transform the plain cylinder into a coffee cup.
Using the Free Transform tool
The coffee cup will look more realistic if you taper the bottom rim. You’ll use
the Free Transform tool to change its overall shape. With the Free Transform
tool, you can change an object’s scale, rotation, or skew (the way it is slanted),
or distort an object by dragging control points around a bounding box.
1. In the Tools panel, select the Free Transform tool (
).
2. Drag the Free Transform tool around the cylinder on the Stage to select
it.
Transformation handles appear on the cylinder.
3. Press and hold Shift+Ctrl/Shift+Command as you drag one of the lower
corners inward. Holding these keys while dragging lets you move both

corners the same distance simultaneously.
4. Click outside the shape to deselect it.
The bottom of the cylinder is narrow, and the top is wide. It now looks
more like a coffee cup.
Using Copy and Paste
Use Copy and Paste commands to easily duplicate shapes on the Stage. You’ll
set the surface level of the coffee by copying and pasting the top rim of the
coffee cup.
1. Select the Selection tool. Hold down the Shift key and select the top arc
and bottom arc of the coffee cup opening.
2. Choose Edit > Copy (Ctrl+C/Command+C). The top strokes of the oval
are copied.
3. Choose Edit > Paste In Place (Shift+Ctrl+V/Shift+Command+V).
A duplicate oval appears on the Stage, exactly overlying the original that
you copied. The duplicate remains selected.
4. In the Tools panel, select the Free Transform tool.
Transformation handles appear on the oval.
5. Press the Shift key as you drag a corner inward. Make the oval about 10
percent smaller. Pressing the Shift key lets you change the shape
uniformly so the oval maintains its aspect ratio.
The top edge of the coffee cup is in place.
6. Choose Edit > Paste In Place (Shift+Ctrl+V/Shift+Command+V) one
more time to add another duplicate of the original oval to the Stage.

7. Select the Free Transform tool. Shift-drag a corner inward to shrink the
new oval about another 10 percent smaller.
8. Drag the oval over the rim of the coffee cup so it overlaps the front lip.
You can also press the Down Arrow key to nudge the selected oval
down the Stage.
9. Click outside the selection to deselect the oval.
10. Select the lower portions of the smaller oval and delete them.
Your coffee cup now is filled with coffee!
Changing shape contours
With the Selection tool, you can push and pull lines and corners to change the
overall contours of any shape. It’s a fast and intuitive way of working with
shapes.
1. In the Tools panel, select the Selection tool.
2. Move your mouse cursor close to one of the sides of the coffee cup.
A curved line appears near your cursor, indicating that you can change
the curvature of the stroke.
3. Drag the stroke outward.
The side of the coffee cup bends, giving the cup a slight bulge.

4. Drag the other side of the coffee cup outward slightly.
The coffee cup now has a more rounded body.
 Tip
Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging the sides of a shape
to add a new corner.
Changing strokes and fills
If you want to change the properties of any stroke or fill, you can use the Ink
Bottle tool or the Paint Bucket tool. The Ink Bottle tool changes stroke colors;
the Paint Bucket tool changes fill colors.
1. In the Tools panel, select the Paint Bucket tool (
).
2. In the Properties panel, choose a darker brown Fill color (#663333).
3. Click the top surface of the coffee that is inside the cup.

The fill of the top oval changes to the darker brown color.
 Tip
If your Paint Bucket tool changes the fill in surrounding
areas, there may be a small gap in the shape outline that
allows the fill to spill over. Close the gap manually, or use
the Gap Size menu at the bottom of the Tools panel to
choose the gap size that Animate will close automatically.
4. In the Tools panel, select the Ink Bottle tool (
).
5. In the Properties panel, choose a darker brown stroke color (#330000).
6. Click the top stroke above the surface of the coffee.
The stroke around the surface of the coffee changes to a darker brown
color.
 Tip
You can also select a stroke or a fill and change its color by
using the Properties panel without selecting the Paint
Bucket or Ink Bottle tool.
Animate drawing modes
Animate provides three drawing modes that determine how objects

interact with one another on the Stage and how you can edit them.
By default, Animate uses Merge Drawing mode, but you can enable
Object Drawing mode or use the Rectangle Primitive or Oval
Primitive tool to use Primitive Drawing mode.
Merge Drawing mode
In this mode, Animate merges drawn shapes, such as rectangles and
ovals, where they overlap, so that multiple shapes appear to be a
single shape. If you move or delete a shape that has been merged
with another, the overlapping portion is permanently removed.
Object Drawing mode
In this mode, Animate does not merge drawn objects; they remain
distinct and separate, even when they overlap. To enable Object
Drawing mode, select the drawing tool you want to use, and then
click the Object Drawing button at the bottom of the Tools panel.
To convert an object to shapes (Merge Drawing mode), select it and
choose Modify > Break Apart (Ctrl+B/Command+B). To convert a
shape to an object (Object Drawing mode), select it and choose
Modify > Combine Objects > Union.
Primitive Drawing mode
When you use the Rectangle Primitive tool or the Oval Primitive
tool, Animate draws your rectangles or ovals as independent objects
that maintain some editable features. Unlike regular objects, you
can modify the corner radius and start and end angle of rectangle
primitives, and adjust the inner radius of oval primitives using the
Properties panel.

Using Gradient and Bitmap Fills
The fill is the interior of the drawn object. Currently, you have selected a solid
brown fill color, but you can also use a gradient or a bitmap image (such as a
JPEG file) as a fill, or you can specify that the object has no fill at all.
In a gradient, one color gradually changes into another. Animate can create
linear gradients, which change color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or
radial gradients, which change color moving outward from a central focal point.
For this lesson, you’ll use a linear gradient fill to add three-dimensionality to the
coffee cup. To give the appearance of a top layer of foaming cream, you’ll
import a bitmap image to use as the fill. You can use the Color panel to import a
bitmap file.
Creating gradient transitions
You’ll use the Color panel to define the colors to use in your gradient. By
default, a linear gradient moves from one color to a second color, but you can
use up to 15 color transitions in a gradient in Animate. A color pointer
determines where each color is defined, and smooth color changes happen
between each of the pointers. Add color pointers beneath the gradient definition
bar in the Color panel to add more colors, and hence, more gradients.
You’ll create a gradient that moves from tan to white to dark tan on the surface
of the coffee cup to give it a rounded appearance.
1. Select the Selection tool. Select the fill that represents the front surface
of the coffee cup.

2. Open the Color panel (Window > Color). In the Color panel, select Fill
Color (the Paint Bucket icon) and choose Linear Gradient from the
Color Type menu.
The front surface of the coffee cup is filled with a color gradient that
changes from left to right.
3. In the Color panel, select the color pointer at the left end of the color
gradient definition bar (the triangle above it turns black when selected),

and then type FFCCCC in the Hex value field to specify a light tan
color. Press Enter/Return to apply the color. You can also select a color
from the color picker or double-click the color pointer to select a color
from the color swatches.
4. Select the far-right color pointer, and then enter B86241 for a dark tan
color. Press Enter/Return to apply the color.
The gradient fill for the coffee cup gradually changes from light tan to
dark tan across its surface.
5. Click beneath the gradient definition bar to create a new color pointer.
6. Drag the new color pointer to the middle of the gradient.
7. Select the new color pointer, and then type FFFFFF in the Hex value
field to specify white for the new color. Press Enter/Return to apply the
color.
The gradient fill for the coffee cup gradually changes from light tan to
white to dark tan.
8. Deselect the fill on the Stage by clicking elsewhere on the Stage. Select
the Paint Bucket tool and make sure the Lock Fill button (
) at the
bottom of the Tools panel is deselected.

 Tip
If the Lock Fill button isn’t visible on your Tools panel,
widen the panel by dragging the left edge (as explained in
Lesson 1). This allows multiple columns of tools to be
shown.
The Lock Fill option locks the current gradient to the first shape to
which it was applied so that subsequent shapes extend the gradient.
You’ll want a new gradient for the back surface of the coffee cup, so the
Lock Fill option should be deselected.
9. With the Paint Bucket tool, select the back surface of the coffee cup.
Animate applies the gradient to the back surface.
 Tip
To delete a color pointer from the gradient definition bar, simply

drag it off the bar.
Using the Gradient Transform tool
In addition to choosing colors and positioning the color pointers for a gradient,
you can adjust the size, direction, or center of a gradient fill. To squeeze the
gradient in the front surface and reverse the gradient in the back surface, you’ll
use the Gradient Transform tool.
1. Select the Gradient Transform tool. (The Gradient Transform tool is
grouped with the Free Transform tool.)
2. Click the front surface of the coffee cup. Transformation handles appear.
3. Drag the square handle on the right side of the bounding box inward to
squeeze the gradient tighter. Drag the center circle to move the gradient

to the left so the white highlight is positioned slightly left of center.
4. Now click the back surface of the coffee cup. Transformation handles
appear.
5. Drag the round handle on the corner of the bounding box to rotate the
gradient 180 degrees so the gradient fades from dark tan on the left to
white to light tan on the right. Narrow the gradient and move it to the
right slightly, so the highlight falls on the right side of the inner surface.
The coffee cup now looks more realistic because the shadows and
highlights make it appear that the front surface is convex and the back
surface is concave.
 Tip
Move the center circle to change the center of the gradient,
drag the arrow circle to rotate the gradient, or drag the
arrow in the square to stretch or compress the gradient.
Adding a bitmap fill
You’ll make this cup of coffee a little fancier by adding a frothy layer of cream.
You’ll use a JPEG image of foam as a bitmap fill.
1. Select the top surface of the coffee with the Selection tool.
2. Choose Window > Color to open the Color panel.
3. Choose Bitmap Fill from the Color Type menu.
4. In the Import To Library dialog box, navigate to the coffeecream.jpg file
in the Lesson02/02Start folder.

5. Select the coffeecream.jpg file and click Open.
The top surface of the coffee fills with the foam image.
The cup of coffee is complete! Rename the layer containing your
completed drawing coffee cup. All that’s left to do is to add some hot
steam.
 Tip
You can also use the Gradient Transform tool to change the width,
orientation, size, or rotation of a bitmap fill.
Grouping objects
Now that you’re finished creating your cup of coffee, you can make it into a
single group. A group holds together a collection of shapes and other graphics to
preserve their integrity. When the elements that compose the coffee cup are
grouped, you can move them as a unit without worrying that the cup might
merge with underlying shapes. Use groups to organize your drawing.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Select all the shapes that make up the cup of coffee.

3. Choose Modify > Group.
The cup of coffee is now a single group. When you select it, a blue
outline indicates its bounding box.
4. If you want to change any part of the cup of coffee, double-click the
group to edit it.
Notice that all the other elements on the Stage dim, and the Edit bar
above the Stage displays Scene 1 Group. This indicates that you are now
in a particular group and can edit its contents.
5. Click the Scene 1 icon in the Edit bar at the top of the Stage, or double-
click an empty part of the Stage, and return to the main scene.
 Tip
To change a group back into its component shapes, choose Modify
> Ungroup (Shift+Ctrl+G/Shift+Command+G).

Using Variable-Width Strokes
You can make many different styles of lines for your strokes. In addition to a
solid line, you can choose dotted, dashed, or ragged, or even customize your
own. In addition, you can create lines with variable widths and edit the
variations with the Width tool.
In this lesson, you’ll use the Pencil tool to create variable-width lines to
represent the aroma wafting off the coffee. You’ll also make the aroma slightly
transparent. Transparency is measured as a percentage and is referred to as
alpha. An Alpha value of 100% indicates that a color is totally opaque, whereas
an Alpha value of 0% indicates that a color is totally transparent.
Adding variable-width lines
Now you’ll add some whimsical lines above your coffee illustration to give it
some personality.
1. On the Timeline, insert a new layer and name it coffee aroma. You’ll
draw your lines in this layer.
2. In the toolbar, select the Pencil tool (
). Choose Smooth from the
Pencil Mode menu at the bottom of the Tools panel.
3. In the Properties panel, select a dark brown stroke color at 50% Alpha
value.
4. For Stroke, enter 15 for the stroke size. From the Style menu, choose
Solid, and from the Width menu, choose the thick and thin profile,
Width Profile 2.

5. Draw a few wavy lines above the coffee.
Animate renders each line with a thick-and-thin width. Although it
appears as a complicated shape, the entire object is a single selectable
stroke.
 Tip
Edit variable-width lines as you would any other stroke. Use the
Selection or Subselection tool to bend the curves or move the
anchor points.
Editing the width of lines
You can finesse where the bulges appear in your lines, and how much of a bulge
there is. Use the Width tool to make those edits.

1. In the Tools panel, select the Width tool (
).
2. Move your mouse pointer over one of your variable-width strokes.
Anchor points appear along the line to show you where the thick and
thin portions of the line are located.
3. Drag the handles at any anchor point to change the width of the line.
Exaggerate some of the restrictions and bulges.
4. Drag an anchor point along the stroke to move its location.
5. Drag anywhere along the stroke to add a new anchor point and define
the width at that location. Animate displays a small plus sign next to
your pointer to indicate that you can add an anchor point.

 Tip
Hold down Alt/Option when you want to modify only one
side of a variable-width line.
 Tip
To delete an anchor point of a variable-width line, click to
select the anchor point, and press Backspace/Delete.
Using Swatches and Tagged Swatches
Swatches are preset samples of color. Access them via the Swatches panel
(Window > Swatches, or Ctrl+F9/Command+F9). You can also save colors that
you’ve used in your graphics as new swatches so you always have them to refer
to.
Tagged swatches are specially marked swatches that are linked to the graphics
on your Stage that are using them. If you change a tagged swatch in your Swatch
panel, all your graphics that use the tagged swatch will be updated.
Saving a swatch
You’ll save a swatch for the brown color that you used for the wisps of coffee
steam above the mug.
1. Select the Selection tool and click one of the variable-width strokes
above your coffee mug.
2. Open the Swatches panel (Ctrl+F9/Command+F9), or click the
Swatches icon.
The Swatches panel opens, showing the default colors with gradients in
the bottom row.

3. Click Create A New Swatch at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
A new swatch appears with the exact color and transparency information
of the coffee wisp that you selected.
Creating a tagged swatch
You’ll convert your saved swatch to a tagged swatch and use it for all the coffee
wisps.
1. With the coffee steam color swatch selected, click Convert To A Tagged
Swatch at the bottom of the Swatch panel.
The Tagged Color Definition dialog box appears.
2. Enter coffee steam in the Name field and click OK.

The dialog box closes and a new tagged swatch appears in the Tagged
Swatches section of the Swatches panel.
Using a tagged swatch
You’ll use your new tagged swatch for all your coffee wisps above the mug.
1. Select the Selection tool and, holding down the Shift key, click every
coffee wisp above the mug.

2. Open the Swatches panel.
3. Select the coffee steam tagged swatch.
The selected graphics use the tagged swatch as their color. In the
Properties panel, a tagged swatch is indicated by the white triangle in the
bottom-right corner of the color.
Updating tagged swatches
The real power of tagged swatches is apparent when you have to make updates
to your project. Suppose the art director or your client doesn’t like the color of
the coffee steam rising above the mug. Since each wisp uses a tagged swatch,
you can simply update the color of the tagged swatch and all graphics using that
tagged swatch will update.
1. Open the Swatches panel.
2. In the Tagged Swatches section of the Swatches panel, double-click the
coffee steam tagged swatch.
The Tagged Color Definition dialog box opens with the name and color
information.

3. Change the color to a different shade of brown. The new color appears
in the top half of the color preview window. Click OK to close the
dialog box.
The new color information is saved and all the graphics using the tagged
swatch update to the new color.
Creating Curves
You’ve used the Selection tool to pull and push on the edges of shapes to
intuitively make curves. For more precise control, you can use the Pen tool.
Using the Pen tool
Now you’ll create a soothing, wavelike background graphic.
1. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer, and name the new layer dark brown
wave.
2. Drag the layer to the bottom of the layer stack.
3. Lock all the other layers.

4. In the Tools panel, select the Pen tool (
).
5. Set the stroke color to a dark brown and Alpha to 100%. Select the
Hairline option for Style and Uniform thickness for the Width.
6. Begin your shape by clicking off the left edge of the Stage to establish
the first anchor point.
7. Move the mouse pointer over the Stage and press—but don’t release!—
the mouse button to place the next anchor point. Keep holding the
mouse button and drag in the directon you want the line to continue.
You will drag out a direction line from the new anchor point, and when
you release the mouse button you will have created a smooth curve
between the two anchor points.
To learn more about drawing with the Pen tool, see the sidebar “he
original video andCreating paths with the Pen tool.”
8. Continue to move the mouse to the right across the Stage, pressing and
dragging out direction lines to build the outline of the wave. Keep going
past the right edge of the Stage and click once to set a corner point.
You have drawn the top edge of your wave; now you need to complete
the shape by drawing the bottom.
9. Click once below the previous corner point, and then draw a wavy line
back to the left across the Stage, similar (but not exactly parallel) to the
first curved line.
Take care not to place your anchor points directly under the anchor
points in the upper line so the wave has a free-form outline.

10. Continue the lower wavy line past the left edge of the Stage and click
below the initial anchor point to place another corner point.
11. Close your shape by clicking the first anchor point.
12. Select the Paint Bucket tool.
13. Set the Fill color to a dark brown.
14. Click inside the outline you just created to fill it with color.
15. Select the Selection tool, and click the outline to select it. Press the
Delete key to remove the stroke.
 Note
Don’t worry about making all the curves perfect. It takes practice to
get used to the Pen tool. You’ll also have a chance to refine your
curves in the next part of the lesson.

Editing curves with the Selection and Subselection tools
Your first try at creating smooth waves probably won’t be very good. Use the
Selection tool or the Subselection tool to refine your curves.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Hover over a line segment and look at the arced line segment that
appears near your pointer. This indicates that you can edit the curve. If a
right-angle segment appears near your cursor, this indicates that you can
edit the corner point.
3. Drag the curve to edit its shape.
4. In the Tools panel, select the Subselection tool (
).
5. Click the outline of the shape.
6. Drag the anchor points to new locations or move the handles to refine
the overall shape.
Deleting or adding anchor points
Use the hidden tools under the Pen tool to delete or add anchor points as needed.
1. Press and hold on the Pen tool to access the hidden tools under it.

2. Select the Delete Anchor Point tool (
).
3. Click an anchor point on the outline of the shape to delete it.
4. Select the Add Anchor Point tool (
).
5. Click the curve to add an anchor point.
Creating paths with the Pen tool
You can use the Pen tool to create paths that are straight or curved,
open or closed. If you’re unfamiliar with the Pen tool, it can be
confusing to use at first. Understanding the elements of a path and
how to create those elements with the Pen tool makes paths much
easier to draw.
To create a straight path, click the mouse button. The first time you
click, you set the starting point. Each time that you click thereafter,
a straight line is drawn between the previous point and the current
point. To draw complex straight-segment paths with the Pen tool,
simply continue to add points.
Creating a straight line
To create a curved path, start by pressing the mouse button to place
an anchor point, then drag to create a direction line for that point
and release the mouse button. Then move the mouse to place the
next anchor point and drag out another set of direction lines. At the
end of each direction line is a direction point; the positions of
direction lines and points determine the size and shape of the curved
segment. Moving the direction lines and points reshapes the curves
in a path.

Creating a curved line
A. Curved line segment
B. Direction point
C. Direction line
D. Selected anchor point
E. Unselected anchor point
Smooth curves are connected by anchor points called smooth points.
Sharply curved paths are connected by corner points. When you
move a direction line on a smooth point, the curved segments on
both sides of the point adjust simultaneously, but when you move a
direction line on a corner point, only the curve on the same side of
the point as the direction line is adjusted.
Path segments and anchor points can be moved after they’re drawn,
either individually or as a group. When a path contains more than
one segment, you can drag individual anchor points to adjust
individual segments of the path, or select all of the anchor points in
a path to edit the entire path. Use the Subselection tool to select and
adjust an anchor point, a path segment, or an entire path.
Creating a closed path
Closed paths differ from open paths in the way that you end each
one. To end an open path, select the Selection tool or press Escape.
To create a closed path, position the Pen tool pointer over the

starting point (a small ° will appear by the pointer), and click.
Closing a path automatically ends the path. After the path closes,
the Pen tool pointer appears with a small *, indicating that your next
click will start a new path.

Using Transparency to Create Depth
Next, you’ll create a second wave to overlap the first wave. You’ll make the
second wave slightly transparent to create a rich, layered effect. You can apply
transparency to either the stroke or the fill.
Modifying the Alpha value of a fill
1. Select the shape in the dark brown wave layer.
2. Choose Edit > Copy.
3. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer, and name the new layer light brown
wave.
4. Choose Edit > Paste In Place (Ctrl+Shift+V/Command+Shift+V).
The Paste In Place command puts the copied item in the exact same
position from where it was copied.
5. Select the Selection tool and move the pasted shape slightly to the left or
to the right so the crests of the waves are somewhat offset.

6. Select the fill of the shape in the light brown wave layer.
7. Choose Window > Color to open the Color panel. Set the fill color to a
slightly different brown hue (#CC6666), and then change the Alpha
value to 50%.
The color swatch in the Color panel previews your newly selected color.
Transparency is indicated by the gray grid that you can see through the
transparent color swatch.
 Tip
You can also change the transparency of a shape from the Properties
panel by clicking the Fill Color icon and changing the Alpha value
in the pop-up color picker.
Adding shadows
Transparent fills are effective for creating shadows, which can provide a sense of
depth for your illustration. You’ll add a shadow for your coffee mug and another

decorative shadow at the bottom of the Stage.
1. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer, and name the new layer shadow.
2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer again, and name the second new layer
big shadow.
3. Drag the shadow layer and the big shadow layer to the bottom of the
layer stack.
4. Select the Oval tool.
5. For the Stroke, select None, and for the Fill, select a dark brown color
(#663300) with a 15% Alpha value.
6. In the shadow layer, draw an oval that sits just under the coffee mug.
7. In the big shadow layer, draw a much larger oval whose top edge just
extends over the bottom of the Stage from below.
The overlapping transparent ovals add a rich, layered appearance to the
illustration.

Being Expressive with the Paint Brush
Although the Pen tool excels at making precision curves like the waves you
created in the background, it’s not very good for creating spontaneous,
expressive marks.
For a more painterly approach, use the Paint Brush tool (
). The Paint Brush
tool allows you to make shapes that are more organic and free-form as well as
shapes with regularly repeating patterns for borders and decorations. And, as
with other graphics created with Animate, the shapes you create with the Paint
Brush tool remain fully vector-based.
Choose from dozens of different brushes, and if you don’t find something you
can use, you can customize the brushes or even create your own.
Exploring the Brush Library
You’ll add a little pizzazz to this banner ad by using the Paint Brush tool for the
café name and logo. You’ll hand-draw the letters with a brush that simulates
rough chalk to provide a little more of a rustic atmosphere to the café brand.
1. In the Timeline, add a new layer on top of your other layers and rename
it chalk.
2. Select the Paint Brush tool. In the Properties panel, choose a nice stroke
color that will contrast against the reds and oranges in the artwork that
you’ve already created. In this example, we chose a vibrant yellow.
3. In the Fill And Stroke section, enter 15 for the stroke size.
This will give you a good thickness for the café lettering.
4. Now, to choose your brush style, click the Brush Library button (to the
right of the Style menu).

The Brush Library panel opens. Animate organizes all the brushes in
large categories on the left column: Arrows, Artistic, Decorative, Line
Art, Pattern Brushes, and Vector Pack.
5. Select a category to see the subcategories, and select a subcategory to
view the individual brushes. For this task, select Artistic > Chalk
Charcoal Pencil and double-click the Charcoal – Thick brush.
The Charcoal-Thick brush is added to the Style menu, and it becomes
the currently active brush style.

6. Now for the fun. Next to your coffee mug, hand-letter the name of the
café, Mug’s Coffee.
The chalk style lettering looks very complex, but it’s controlled by a
simple vector line. If you select the Selection or the Subselection tool
and click one of your letters, you can see the stroke inside each letter.
Push and pull on the stroke, move, or edit it with the Transform tool just
like you would any other vector shape.

Creating a pattern
Now it’s time to add a decorative border around your banner ad.
1. Create a new layer above all your other layers and rename it border.
2. Select the Line tool. Click the Stroke color swatch in the Properties
panel and select a muted brown or orange color that would harmonize
well with the rest of the background graphics.
3. In the Properties panel, click the Brush Library button next to Style.
The Brush Library panel opens.
4. Select Pattern Brushes > Dashed > Dashed Square 1.3. If you find
something more appealing, feel free to select it instead. Double-click
your choice.
The Dashed Square 1.3 brush is added to the Style menu, and it becomes
the currently active brush style.

 Tip
Hold Shift while drawing with the Line tool to constrain the
tool to horizontal or vertical lines.
5. Create a long horizontal line at the top edge of the Stage and another
one at the bottom of the Stage.
The dashed regular pattern at the top and bottom of the Stage provides a
nice contrast to the curves and chalk-style lettering.
Editing and creating your own Art or Pattern Brush
You might not find a brush to your liking in the Brush Library, or
you may need something very specific for your project. In either
case, you can edit an existing brush or you can create an entirely
new one. Pattern brushes repeat a shape over the length of a stroke
whereas Art brushes stretch the base art over the length of the
stroke.

To edit a brush, click the Edit Brush Style button next to the Style
menu in the Properties panel.
The Paint Brush Options dialog box appears, with multiple controls
to refine how the brush applies the base shapes.
Art brushes and Pattern brushes have different options. Experiment
with different spacing, how the shapes repeat or stretch to fit, or
how corners and overlaps are handled. When you’re satisfied with
your new brush, click Add to add your customized brush to the
Style menu.
To create an entirely new brush, first create some shapes on the
Stage that you want to base your brush on. For example, if you want

to create a train track, create the base art that repeats for a Pattern
brush.
Select the artwork on the Stage; then click the Create New Paint
Brush From Selection button in the Properties panel near the Style
menu.
The Paint Brush Options panel appears. From the Type menu, you
can choose either Art Brush or Pattern Brush, and then refine the
brush options. The preview window shows you the results of your
chosen options.

Enter a name for your new brush and click Add. Your new brush
will be added to your Style menu and available for you to use.
Managing paint brushes
If you’ve created a new brush or customized an existing one, you can save it to
the Brush Library.
1. Click the Manage Paint Brushes button in the Properties panel.

The Manage Document Paint Brushes dialog box opens, displaying the
current paint brushes that you’ve added to the Style menu. It shows you
which ones are currently in use on the Stage and which ones aren’t.
2. Select the brushes you want to delete or save to your Brush Library. You
cannot delete a brush that is currently in use.
3. If you save a brush to your Brush Library, it’ll appear in the Brush
Library in the category called My Brushes.

Pressure-sensitive graphics tablets
Animate supports input from pressure-sensitive tablets, such as the
Wacom graphics tablets, to control variable-width strokes or the Art
or Pattern brushes. Pressing harder with the stylus creates fatter
strokes, whereas pressing lightly results in thinner strokes. You can
adjust the tilt or sensitivity percentages in the Paint Brush Options
dialog box to modify the range of thicknesses in the shapes you
create. Try drawing with a stylus on a tablet with variable-width
strokes enabled for a natural, intuitive way of creating vector
images.
Rotating the Stage for easier drawing
When you draw on regular paper, it’s often easier to rotate the page
to get a better angle to draw or to write something. In Animate, you
can do the same thing with the Stage using the Rotation tool.
The Rotation tool is grouped under the Hand tool in the Tools panel.
Select the Rotation tool and click the Stage to specify the pivot
point, indicated by a crosshair. Once the pivot point has been
established, drag the Stage to rotate it to your desired angle.

Click the Center Stage button at the top of the Stage to reset the
Stage to its normal orientation.
Creating and Editing Text
Now let’s add text to complete this illustration. Various options are available for
text depending on what kind of document you’re working on. For an HTML5
Canvas document like the one in this lesson, you can use static text or dynamic
text.
Use static text for simple display text that uses fonts available on your (the
designer’s) computer. When you create static text on the Stage and publish to an
HTML5 project, Animate automatically converts fonts into outlines. That means
you don’t have to worry about your audience having the required fonts to see the
text as you intended it. The downside is that too much text can bloat your file
size.
Use dynamic text to leverage web fonts available either through Typekit or
Google. Thousands of high-quality fonts are available to you via Typekit through
your Creative Cloud subscription, and the fonts are hosted by Typekit and
accessible directly through the Properties panel within Animate. High-quality
open source fonts are available through Google Fonts, which are hosted on
Google servers.
In the next task, you’ll create a tag line for the café and some descriptions of its
products. You’ll choose an appropriate web font and add the text.

Using the Text tool to add dynamic text
You’ll create your text with the Text tool.
1. Select the top layer.
2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer, and name the new layer text.
3. Select the Text tool (
).
4. Choose Dynamic Text from the Text Type menu in the Properties panel.
5. Drag out a text box under the café name starting near the coffee cup and
ending at the right edge of the Stage.
6. Begin typing. Enter Taste the Difference.
The text may not fit, or it might not be the size or font that you want.
Don’t worry—you’ll select a web font for your text box in the next task.
7. Exit the Text tool by choosing the Selection tool.
8. Add three more pieces of smaller text on the Stage in the same layer just

below your tag line: Coffee, Pastries, and Free Wi-Fi.
Adding a web font
Now you’ll link a web font to your project. Make sure you have an Internet
connection because Animate retrieves the list of available fonts from the web.
The processes for adding a Typekit font and a Google Font are very similar. In
this task, you’ll add a Typekit font.
1. Select the Taste the Difference text and click Add Web Fonts (its icon
is a globe) in the Properties panel, in the Character section. Choose
Typekit from the menu that pops up.
Animate displays the Typekit Web Fonts opening screen.

2. Click Get Started.
The Add Web Fonts dialog box appears.

All the available Typekit fonts are listed. You can scroll through them all
with the scroll bar on the right. You can also search for specific fonts or
use the Sort By or Filter button to narrow your search.
3. For now, peruse the range of typefaces and pick one that you think
would suit this banner ad. Click the name of your preferred font under
the sample text.
More detail about the selected font appears, including the different styles

(italic, bold, and so on), its classification (serif or sans serif), and the
foundry name.
4. Click the Select button.
The Select button turns blue and the label changes to Selected.
5. Click OK.
The dialog box closes and the selected web font is added to your project.
6. In the Properties panel, Character section, choose the newly added web
font from the Family menu. Web fonts are listed at the very top of the
menu.

Your selected Typekit web font is applied to the text box on the Stage.
Choose a color that works nicely with the composition. Adjust the font
size and/or the line spacing (the space between lines) in the Properties
panel (line spacing is in the Paragraph section) to get all the text to fit
comfortably in the space.
7. Select the other three pieces of text and use the Family menu to apply
the same web font.
Identifying your domain
After you add your Typekit web font, you must identify the domain where your
HTML5 project will be hosted. For Google Fonts, you do not need to perform
these steps.
1. Choose File > Publish Settings.
The Publish Settings dialog box appears.
2. Click the Web Fonts tab on the far right tab.
3. In the empty field, enter the URL where your banner ad will be hosted.
Include the http://protocol. Since you won’t actually upload this sample
project, you can make up a domain name or leave it blank.

4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. Choose Control > Test to test your project.
Animate shows you a preview of the ad in your browser. The Test movie
output that uses web fonts is meant for preview only. Use the File >
Publish option to generate the final files to upload to your server.
Removing a web font
If you change your mind, you can easily remove a Typekit web font and choose
a different one.
1. Select the text that uses the web font you want to remove.
Searching for the right font
The Add Web Fonts dialog box provides tools that help you
find the right font for your project quickly and easily.
Previews of the upper- and lowercase forms for A, B, C,

and D are shown for each font family. If you want to see
more details, click the font name. Sample sentences are
displayed in all the different stylistic variants available
(italic, bold, regular, and so on). You can use the Sort button
to organize the fonts, or you can use the Filter button to
show only certain kinds of typefaces, such as ones that are
serif or sans serif, or ones with thick and thin transitions.
Knowing a little about typography is valuable in creating
elegant and impactful Animate projects. Typography—the
study and practice of creating letter forms—is a subtle but
essential part of design. The shape of each letter and its
interaction with neighboring letters and the white space
around them can drive the overall look and feel, as well as
the emotion of your project.
The two major categories of typefaces are serif and sans
serif.
Serif fonts are distinguished by small lines at the ends of
strokes that make up a letter form. Times New Roman is the
best-known example of a serif typeface. Serif typefaces are
best used for long passages of text because the serifs help
readability. Sans serif fonts, on the other hand, lack the
embellishments at the ends of strokes (“sans” is French for
“without”). Sans serif typefaces are cleaner, starker, and

generally perceived as more modern. Helvetica is the
bestknown example of a sans serif typeface. Sans serif fonts
are often used for larger display purposes such as headers or
titles.
Other kinds of typefaces include script, which mimic a
calligraphic pen, or decorative, which are more illustrative
and very unique. Within each of these categories are a
myriad of variations, so take time to think, search, and
decide which font would best suit your project.
2. Deselect the font by choosing a different one.
In this example, the Merriweather font is deselected and the _sans font is
selected.
3. Click the Add Web Fonts button and choose Typekit to open the Add
Typekit Web Fonts dialog box.
4. Click Selected Fonts.
Animate displays all the fonts, indicated by a blue checkmark, that have
been selected for your project.

If the font has a gray checkmark, that means you’re still using it in some
text on the Stage. You must deselect a font from every bit of text before
removing it from your project.
5. Deselect the font by clicking on it.
Now, no fonts are displayed in the Selected Fonts area.
6. Click OK.
The Add Web Fonts dialog box closes. The web font is removed from
the Family menu in the Properties panel.
Matching the color of an existing object
If you want to match a color exactly, you can use the Eyedropper tool (
) to
sample a fill or a stroke. After you click an object with the Eyedropper tool,
Animate automatically switches to the Paint Bucket tool or the Ink Bottle tool
loaded with the selected color and associated properties that you can apply to
another object.
You’ll use the Eyedropper tool to sample the color of one of the decorative
background waves and apply it to the three pieces of smaller text.

1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Shift-select all three of the smaller pieces of text: Coffee, Pastries, and
Free Wi-Fi.
3. Select the Eyedropper tool.
4. Click the fill of the shape in the dark brown wave layer.
The three selected pieces of text change color to match the fill of the
dark brown wave layer. Using the same colors helps to unify the
composition.
Aligning and Distributing Objects
Finally, you’ll tidy up the text so the layout is organized. Although you can use
rulers (View > Rulers) and grids (View > Grid > Show Grid) to help position
objects, here you’ll use the Align panel, which is more effective when you’re
dealing with multiple objects. You’ll also rely on the smart guides that appear
when you move objects around the Stage.
Aligning objects
The Align panel, as you might guess, aligns any number of selected objects
horizontally or vertically. It can also distribute objects evenly.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Select the first small piece of text, Coffee.
3. Move the text box left or right until smart guides appear. Align the left
edge of the selected text with the left edge of the larger text above it.

4. Select the third small piece of text, Free Wi-Fi.
5. Move the text left or right until smart guides appear. Align the right
edge of the selected text with the right edge of the larger text above it.
6. Shift-click all three small pieces of text to select them.
7. Open the Align panel (Window > Align).
8. Deselect the Align to Stage option, if it is already selected. Click the
Align Bottom Edge button.
Animate aligns the bottom edges of the text.
9. Click the Space Evenly Horizontally button.

The selected text is adjusted so that the spaces between them become
uniform.
 Tip
You might have to lock the lower layers so you don’t accidentally
select the shapes in the lower layers.
Converting and Exporting Art
You’ve completed your composition, made up of a simple illustration and
layered design and text elements. You may still need to take additional steps,
however, in order to optimize it for display in the final, published playback
environment.
Converting vector art to bitmap art
Vector art, especially art with complex curves and many shapes and different line
styles, can be processor-intensive and can take its toll on mobile devices, where
performance suffers. The Convert To Bitmap command provides a way to turn
selected artwork on the Stage into a single bitmap, which can be less taxing on
the processor.
Once you’ve converted the object to a bitmap, you can move it without worrying
about it merging with underlying shapes. However, the graphics are no longer
editable with Animate’s editing tools.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Unlock your layers. Select the wavy coffee aroma lines in the coffee
aroma layer, as well as the coffee group in the coffee cup layer.

3. Choose Modify > Convert To Bitmap.
Animate converts the cup of coffee and wavy lines to a single bitmap
and stores the bitmap in the Library panel.
Choose Edit > Undo (Ctrl+Z/Command+Z) to undo the conversion to
bitmap and revert your coffee mug and aroma strokes to vector graphics.
Exporting art as PNG, JPG, or GIF
If you want a simple image file in a format such as a PNG, JPG, or GIF, use the
Export Image panel to choose your format and fine-tune the compression for

optimal web download performance.
1. Choose File > Export > Export Image.
The Export Image dialog box opens.
Exporting art as SVG
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a common XML-based
format for displaying vector graphics in a browser. You can
export your final composition from Animate as SVG,
embedding or linking any bitmap images. The exported
SVG produces a static image of your project. However,
SVG only supports static text.
To export your artwork as SVG, do the following:
1. Choose File > Export > Export Image (Legacy).
2. From the File Format menu, choose SVG Image (*.svg)
and click Save.
3. In the ExportSVG dialog box that appears, select
Embed for Image Location.

The Image Location options determine whether your
bitmap images are encoded into the SVG file or kept as
separate files and linked to your SVG. Embedding
images creates larger SVG files, whereas linking allows
you to swap and edit the images easily.
4. Click OK.
Animate exports an SVG file with any image data
encoded in the text file. An SVG document is a text file
marked up much like an HTML document. All the visual
information, including corner points, curves, text, and
color information, is encoded in a compact form.
When you open an SVG file in your browser, it renders
the image, and all the vector information is preserved.
Curves remain sharp even up close, and any static text in
your composition is selectable.
2. Choose the appropriate file format, select the amount of compression,
select a color palette, and even compare different settings to weigh
image quality and file size. You can also resize the image.
That Animate provides such a robust environment for creating
compelling, rich, and sophisticated graphics and text paired with such
flexibility in output options is truly remarkable, and something that will
help drive all your creative pursuits.
 Note

If your Animate document contains multiple frames, you
can also choose to export it as an animated GIF.
Review Questions
1 What are the three drawing modes in Animate, and how do they differ?
2 When would you use each of the selection tools in Animate?
3 What can you do with the Width tool?
4 What is the difference between an Art brush and a Pattern brush?
5 What are web fonts and how are they used in HTML5 Canvas documents?
6 What does the Align panel do?
Review Answers
1 The three drawing modes are Merge Drawing mode, Object Drawing mode,
and Primitive Drawing mode.
In Merge Drawing mode, shapes drawn on the Stage merge to become a
single shape.
In Object Drawing mode, each object is distinct and remains separate,
even when it overlaps another object.
In Primitive Drawing mode, you can modify the angles, radius, or corner
radius of an object.
2 Animate includes three selection tools: the Selection tool, the Subselection
tool, and the Lasso tool.
Use the Selection tool to select an entire shape or object.
Use the Subselection tool to select a specific point or line in an object.
Use the Lasso tool to draw a free-form selection area.
3 Use the Width tool to edit the variable widths of a stroke. You can drag the
handle bars of any anchor point to expand or narrow the width, add or delete
anchor points, or move anchor points along the stroke.
4 An Art brush uses a base shape and stretches it to fit a vector stroke to
simulate an expressive, creative, and often painterly mark. A Pattern brush
uses a base shape that repeats to create decorative patterns.
5 Web fonts are fonts specifically created for online viewing that are hosted on a
server. Animate offers two kinds of web fonts for inclusion in HTML5 Canvas

documents: Typekit and Google Fonts.
6 The Align panel aligns any number of selected elements horizontally or
vertically and can distribute elements evenly.

3. Creating and Editing Symbols
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Import Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop artwork
Create and edit symbols
Understand symbols and instances
Position objects on the Stage
Adjust transparency and color, and turn visibility on or off
Apply blending effects
Apply special effects with filters
Position objects in 3D space
This lesson will take about one and a half hours to complete. Please log in
to your account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this
chapter, or go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book
and follow the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web
Edition.”

Symbols are reusable assets that are stored in your Library panel. The movie
clip, graphic, and button symbols are three types of symbols that you will be
creating and using often for special effects, animation, and interactivity.
Getting Started
Start by viewing the final project to see what you’ll be creating as you learn to
work with symbols.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.
See “Getting Started” at the beginning of the book.
1. Double-click the 03End.png file in the Lesson03/03End folder to view
the final project.

The project is a static illustration of a cartoon frame. In this lesson,
you’ll use Illustrator graphic files, imported Photoshop files, and
symbols to create an attractive static image with interesting effects.
Learning how to work with symbols is an essential step before creating
any animation or interactivity.
2. Close the 03End.png file.
3. In Adobe Animate CC, choose File > New. In the New Document
dialog box, choose ActionScript 3.0.
Why an ActionScript 3.0 document? You won’t be writing ActionScript
code or publishing your project for the Flash Player in a desktop
browser, but an ActionScript 3.0 document supports many robust
graphic features that you will use to learn about symbols and to export a
final PNG file.
4. On the right side of the dialog box, change the Stage to 600 pixels wide
by 450 pixels high and click OK.
5. Choose File > Save. Name the file 03_workingcopy.fla and save it in
the 03Start folder.
Importing Adobe Illustrator Files
As you learned in Lesson 2, you can draw objects in Animate using the

Rectangle, Oval, and other tools. However, you can also create original artwork
in a variety of applications and import it into Animate. If you’re more familiar
with Adobe Illustrator, for example, you may find it easier to design layouts in
Illustrator, and then import them into Animate to add animation and interactivity.
 Note
To learn more about Adobe Illustrator, turn to Adobe Illustrator CC
Classroom in a Book, from Adobe Press. For more information,
visit adobepress.com or peachpit.com.
When you import an Illustrator file saved in AI format, Animate will
automatically recognize layers, frames, and symbols. You can choose how
Animate should import the different layers of the original file and how to import
text (see the section “Using simple import options”).
In this exercise, you’ll import an Illustrator file that contains all the characters
for the cartoon frame.
1. Choose File > Import > Import To Stage.
2. Navigate to the Lesson03/03Start folder and select characters.ai.
3. Click Open.
The Import To Stage dialog box appears.
There are two modes for importing Illustrator assets into Animate: one
with advanced options and one without. The advanced options appear by
default, but you can hide or show the advanced options by clicking the
button at the bottom of the panel. For now, keep the advanced options
displayed.

4. On the left side of the dialog box, Animate shows the graphics in each
layer from the Illustrator file. The layer names and hierarchy remain
identical to those of the original Illustrator layers.
5. Click the Collapse All button.
Animate collapses the individual paths and groups to show just the two
layers called hero and robot.
6. Click the hero layer, and in the Layer Import Options on the right, select
Create A Movie Clip.

We chose to import the hero layer from Illustrator as a movie clip
symbol because a movie clip symbol supports a variety of visual effects,
even for single-frame images. If you select the Import As Bitmap option,
Animate will convert the Illustrator graphics to a bitmap image instead
of preserving the vector paths.
7. Select the robot layer, and in the options on the right, don’t select either
of the layer import options. You’ll see how these two different import
options affect how your assets come into Animate.
8. Click Import.
The hero and robot layers from the original Illustrator file are imported
and placed on layers with the same names in Animate. The hero is
converted to a movie clip symbol, which is saved to the Library panel.
The robot is not yet a movie clip symbol (you’ll learn about how to
create a movie clip symbol within Animate later in this lesson).

Using simple import options
Often, you don’t need the fine control of selecting individual layers or individual
graphics within a layer to import into Animate. For a simple, quick, and easy
import process, click Hide Advanced Options in the lower-left corner of the
dialog box and use the following options:
Layer Conversion
Selecting Maintain Editable Paths And Effects lets you continue to edit
the vector drawing in Animate. The other option, Single Flattened
Bitmap, imports the Illustrator artwork as a bitmap image.
Text Conversion

Selecting Editable Text leaves the text as text so you can edit it in
Animate. The Vector Outlines option converts the text into resolution-
independent vector paths, which are no longer editable with the Text tool.
Use this option if you don’t have the correct fonts installed on your
computer to import the text. Selecting Flattened Bitmap Image converts
text to a bitmap image, which is not editable.
Convert Layers To
Select Animate Layers to preserve the layers from Illustrator and import
each layer from Illustrator into a layer in Animate. The Single Animate
Layer option flattens the Illustrator layers into one Animate layer, and the
Keyframes option separates the Illustrator layers into individual Animate
keyframes.
Copying artwork from Illustrator and pasting into Animate
If you don’t need to bring an entire Illustrator file into Animate, you
can copy portions of the Illustrator file and paste them into an
Animate document.
When you copy and paste (or drag and drop) artwork from
Illustrator into Animate, the Paste dialog box appears. The Paste
dialog box provides import settings for the Illustrator file you’re
copying. You can paste the file as a single bitmap object, or you can
paste it using the current preferences for AI files. Just as when you
import the file to the Stage or the Library panel, when you paste
Illustrator artwork, you can convert Illustrator layers to Animate
layers.
Importing SVG files

Animate can also import SVG artwork (see the description of the
SVG format in the previous chapter). To import an SVG file, simply
drag and drop the file onto the Stage or use one of the File > Import
commands. In the import process, you can choose to convert SVG
layers to Animate layers or to keyframes, or to flatten them into a
single Animate layer.
About Symbols
A symbol is a reusable asset that you can use for special effects, animation, or
interactivity. There are three kinds of symbols that you can create: the graphic,
the button, and the movie clip. Symbols can reduce the file size and download
time for many animations because they can be reused. You can use a symbol
countless times in a project, but Animate includes its data only once.
Symbols are stored in the Library panel. When you drag a symbol to the Stage,
Animate creates an instance of the symbol, leaving the original in the library. An
instance is a copy of a symbol located on the Stage. You can think of the symbol
as an original photographic negative, and the instances on the Stage as prints of
the negative. With just a single negative, you can create multiple prints.
It’s also helpful to think of symbols as containers. Symbols are simply containers
for your content. A symbol can contain a JPEG image, an imported Illustrator
drawing, or a drawing that you created in Animate. At any time, you can go
inside your symbol and edit it, which means editing or replacing its contents.
Each of the three kinds of symbols in Animate is used for a specific purpose.
You can tell whether a symbol is a graphic (
), button (
), or movie clip (
)
by looking at the icon next to it in the Library panel.
Movie clip symbols
The movie clip is one of the most powerful and versatile types of symbol. When
you create animation, you will typically use movie clip symbols. You can apply
filters, color settings, and blending modes to a movie clip instance to enhance its
appearance with special effects.
 Note
In spite of its name, a movie clip symbol isn’t necessarily animated.
A movie clip symbol also contains its own independent timeline. You can have

an animation inside a movie clip symbol just as easily as you can have an
animation on the main Timeline. This makes very complex animations possible;
for example, a butterfly flying across the Stage can move from left to right as
well as have its wings flapping independently of its movement.
Most importantly, you can control movie clips with code to make them respond
to the user. For example, you can control a movie clip’s position or rotation to
create arcade-style games. Or a movie clip can have drag-and-drop behavior,
which comes in handy when building a jigsaw puzzle.
Button symbols
Button symbols are used for interactivity. They contain four unique keyframes
that describe how they appear when the mouse pointer is interacting with them.
However, buttons need code to make them do something.
You can also apply filters, blending modes, and color settings to buttons. You’ll
learn more about buttons in Lesson 8 when you create a nonlinear navigation
scheme to allow the user to choose what to see.
Graphic symbols
Graphic symbols are the most basic kind of symbol. Often you use graphic
symbols to build more complex movie clip symbols. They do not support
interactivity, and you can’t apply filters or blending modes to a graphic symbol.
However, graphic symbols are useful when you have multiple versions of a
drawing that you want to easily switch between—for example, when
synchronizing lips to sound, keeping all the different mouth positions in
individual keyframes of a graphic symbol makes voice syncing easy. Graphic
symbols also are used to synchronize an animation inside a graphic symbol to
the main Timeline.
Creating Symbols
You learned how to create a movie clip symbol while importing assets from
Illustrator. You can also create symbols within Animate. There are two main
ways of creating a symbol. Both methods are valid; the one you use depends on
your preferred way of working.
The first method is to start with nothing selected on the Stage, and then to
choose Insert > New Symbol. Animate will put you in symbol-editing mode,
where you can begin drawing or importing graphics for your symbol.
The second method is to select existing graphics on the Stage and then convert

them to symbols. Whatever is selected will automatically be placed inside your
new symbol.
Most designers prefer to use this second method because they can create all their
graphics on the Stage and see them together before making the individual
components into symbols.
 Note
When you use the command Convert To Symbol, you aren’t
actually “converting” anything; rather, you’re placing whatever
you’ve selected inside a symbol.
For this lesson, you’ll select the different parts of the imported Illustrator
graphic, and then convert the various pieces to symbols.
1. On the Stage, select only the cartoon robot in the robot layer.
2. Choose Modify > Convert To Symbol (F8).
The Convert To Symbol dialog box opens.
3. Name the symbol robot and choose Movie Clip from the Type menu.
4. Leave all other settings as they are. The Registration grid indicates the
center point (x=0, y=0) and transformation point of your symbol. Leave
the registration at the top-left corner.

5. Click OK. The robot symbol appears in the Library panel. In the Library
panel, click the disclosure triangle next to the characters.ai folder to
reveal the hero symbol that was converted to a movie clip symbol when
you imported it.
You now have two movie clip symbols in your library and an instance of
each on the Stage as well.

Importing Adobe Photoshop Files
Now, you’ll import a Photoshop file for the background. The Photoshop file
contains two layers with a blending effect. A blending effect can create special
color mixes between different layers. You’ll see that Animate can import a
Photoshop file with all the layers intact and retain all the layer blending
information as well.
 Note
To learn more about Adobe Photoshop, turn to Adobe Photoshop
CC Classroom in a Book, from Adobe Press. For more information,
visit adobepress.com or peachpit.com.
As with the options for importing Illustrator files, there are two modes for
importing Photoshop assets into Animate: one with advanced options and one
without. And like the options for importing Illustrator files, the Import
[filename] To Stage dialog box displays the advanced options when it opens.
 Tip
If you can’t select the PSD file, choose All Files from the Enable
menu. If this menu isn’t visible, click Options.
1. Select the top layer in your Timeline.
2. Choose File > Import > Import To Stage.
3. Navigate to the Lesson03/03Start folder and select background.psd.
4. Click Open.
The Import To Stage dialog box appears.

5. Click Show Advanced Options at the bottom of the dialog box if the
advanced options are hidden.
Animate shows two different layers from the Photoshop file, one named
flare and the other named Background.
6. Make sure both layers have a check mark in front of them, indicating
that they’re selected. If not, you can click the Select All Layers option.
7. Click the flare layer to highlight it, and from the options to the right,
select Bitmap Image With Editable Layer Styles.

8. Select the Background layer, and from the options to the right, select
Bitmap Image With Editable Layer Styles.
9. Leave all the other options at their default settings, and click Import.
Animate preserves the layers from Photoshop and creates identically
named layers in Animate.
The Photoshop layers are automatically converted into movie clip
symbols and saved in your library. The movie clip symbols are
contained in the folder called background.psd Asset.

All the blending and transparency information is maintained and
translated from the Photoshop layers to the Animate movie clip
Blending properties. To see this, select the flare layer in the Timeline
and then click the flare image on the Stage to select it. Open the
Properties panel, and in the Display section you’ll see that Lighten is
chosen from the Blending menu.
The option that you did not select, Flattened Bitmap Image, would have
imported a bitmap image with its blending and transparency effects
fixed in the image. The Lighten effect would be permanently applied to
the bitmap image itself and not as a Blending option in the Properties
panel.

10. Drag the robot and the hero layers to the top of the Timeline so they
overlap the background layers.
 Tip
If you want to edit your Photoshop files, you don’t have to go
through the entire import process again. You can edit any image on
the Stage or in the Library panel in Adobe Photoshop CC or any
other image-editing application. Right-click an image on the Stage
or an image in the Library panel and choose Edit With Adobe
Photoshop to edit in Photoshop, or choose another Edit With option
to open the graphic in your preferred application. Animate launches
the application, and once you have saved your changes, your image
is immediately updated in Animate. Make sure that you right-click

an image on the Stage or library, and not the movie clip. This is
often easier to achieve in the Library panel.
 Note
The simple import options for Photoshop files are identical to those
for Illustrator files. Choose settings for the Layer Conversion, Text
Conversion, and Convert Layers To options for a quick and easy
import process.
 Note
You also have the option of changing the Animate Stage size to
match the Photoshop canvas. However, the current Stage is already
set to the correct dimensions (600 pixels x 450 pixels) for this
project.
About image formats
Animate supports multiple bitmap image formats for import.
Animate can handle JPEG, GIF, PNG, and PSD (Photoshop) files.
Use JPEG files for images that include gradients and subtle
variations, such as those that occur in photographs. GIF files are
used for images with large solid blocks of color or black-and-white
line drawings. Use PNG files for images that include transparency.
Use PSD files if you want to retain all the layer, transparency, and
blending information from a Photoshop file.
Converting a bitmap image to a vector graphic
Sometimes you’ll want to convert a bitmap image to a vector
graphic. Animate handles bitmap images as a series of colored dots
(or pixels); vector graphics are handled as a series of lines and
curves. This vector information is rendered on the fly, so the
resolution of vector graphics is not fixed like a bitmap image. That
means you can zoom in on a vector graphic and your computer will
always display it sharply and smoothly. Converting a bitmap image
to a vector graphic often has the effect of making it look
“posterized” because subtle gradations are converted to editable,
discrete blocks of color, which can be an interesting effect.

To convert a bitmap to a vector, import the bitmap image into
Animate. Select the bitmap and choose Modify > Bitmap > Trace
Bitmap. The options determine how faithful the vector image will
be to the original bitmap.
In the following figure, the left image is an original bitmap and the
right image is a vector graphic.
Exercise caution when using the Trace Bitmap command, because a
complicated vector graphic is often more memory- and processor-
intensive than the original bitmap image.
Editing and Managing Symbols
You now have multiple movie clip symbols in your library and several instances
on the Stage. You can better manage the symbols in your library by organizing
them in folders. You can also edit any symbol at any time. If you decide you
want to change the color of one of the robot’s arms, for example, you can easily
go into symbol-editing mode and make that change.
Adding folders and organizing the library
The Library panel provides handy tools for streamlining the organization of your
collection of symbols.
1. In the Library panel, right-click in an empty space and choose New
Folder from the context menu. Alternatively, you can click the New
Folder button (
) at the bottom of the Library panel, or choose New
Folder from the panel menu in the upper-right corner of the panel.

A new folder is created in your library.
2. Name the folder characters.
3. Drag the hero and robot movie clip symbols into the characters folder.
You may have to open the folder characters.ai/hero to find the hero
movie clip symbol.
4. You can collapse or expand folders to hide or view their contents and
keep your Library panel organized.
Editing a symbol from the library

You can edit symbols directly from the library whether or not they’ve been used
on the Stage.
1. Double-click the robot movie clip symbol icon in the library.
Animate puts you in symbol-editing mode. In this mode, you can see the
contents of your symbol—in this case, the robot on the Stage. Notice
that the Edit bar at the top of the Stage tells you that you are no longer in
Scene 1 but are inside the symbol called robot.
2. With the Selection tool active, double-click the drawing to edit it.
Animate drills down one group deeper to show all the vector drawing
objects that make up the group.

3. Click an empty part of the Stage to deselect everything.
4. Select the Paint Bucket tool. Select a new fill color and apply it to a
drawing group on the robot—for example, a particular panel on its
shoulder.

5. Click Scene 1 on the Edit bar above the Stage to return to the main
Timeline.
The movie clip symbol in the library reflects the changes you made. The
instance on the Stage also reflects the changes you made to the symbol.
All instances of the symbol will change if you edit the symbol.

 Tip
You can quickly and easily duplicate symbols in the library. Select
the Library symbol, right-click, and choose Duplicate. Or choose
Duplicate from the Library panel menu (in the upper-right corner of
the panel). Animate creates an exact copy of the selected symbol in
your library.
Editing a symbol in place
You may want to edit a symbol in context with the other objects on the Stage.
You can do so by double-clicking an instance on the Stage. You’ll enter symbol-
editing mode, but you’ll also be able to see the symbol’s surroundings. This
editing mode is called editing in place.
1. Using the Selection tool, double-click the robot movie clip instance on
the Stage.
All other objects on the Stage are dimmed and you are put into symbol-
editing mode. Notice that the Edit bar shows that you are no longer in
Scene 1 but are inside the symbol called robot.

2. Double-click the group to edit it.
The drawing groups that make up the group inside the symbol are
displayed. Note that the Edit bar shows that you are in a group inside the
symbol called robot.
3. Select the Paint Bucket tool. Select a new fill color and apply it to the

robot’s chest plate.
4. Click Scene 1 on the Edit bar above the Stage to return to the main
Timeline. You can also just double-click any part of the Stage outside
the graphic with the Selection tool to return to the next-higher group
level.
The movie clip symbol in the Library panel reflects the changes you
made. The instance on the Stage also reflects the changes you made to
the symbol. All instances of the symbol will change according to the
edits you make to the symbol.

Breaking apart a symbol instance
If you no longer want an object on the Stage to be a symbol instance, you can
use the Break Apart command to return it to its original form.
1. Use the Selection tool to select the robot instance on the Stage.
2. Choose Modify > Break Apart.
Animate breaks apart the robot movie clip instance. What’s left on the
Stage is a group, which looks the same as the symbol instance. You can
break apart the group even further to edit it.
3. Choose Modify > Break Apart once more.
Animate breaks apart the group into its individual components, which
are the vector drawing objects. You could even break apart one more
time and your drawing objects will convert to shapes.

4. Choose Edit > Undo several times to return your robot to a symbol
instance.
Changing the Size and Position of Instances
You can have multiple instances of the same symbol on the Stage. Now you’ll
add a few more robots to create a small robot army. You’ll learn how to change
the size and position (and even rotation) of each instance individually.
1. Select the robot layer in the Timeline.
2. Drag another robot symbol from the Library panel onto the Stage.
A new instance appears.

3. Select the Free Transform tool.
Control handles appear around the selected instance.
4. Drag the control handle on one side of the selection to flip the robot so it
is facing in the other direction.

5. Drag the control handle on one corner of the selection while holding
down the Shift key to reduce the size of the robot. The Shift key
constrains the transformation so the width and height change
proportionally.
6. Drag a third robot from the Library panel onto the Stage. With the Free
Transform tool, flip the robot, resize it, and make it overlap the second
robot. Move the characters into an attractive arrangement.
The robot army is growing! Notice how transformations to an instance
do not change the library symbol and do not change other instances. On
the other hand, edits to the library symbol change all of its instances.

Using rulers and guides
You may want to be more precise in your placement of your symbol instances. In
Lesson 1, you learned how to use the x and y coordinates in the Properties panel
to position individual objects. In Lesson 2, you learned to use the Align panel to
align several objects to each other.
Another way to position objects on the Stage is to use rulers and guides. Rulers
appear on the top and left edge of the pasteboard to provide measurement along
the horizontal and vertical axes. Guides are vertical or horizontal lines that
appear on the Stage but do not appear in the final published movie.
1. Choose View > Rulers (Alt+Shift+R/Option+Shift+Command+R).
Horizontal and vertical rulers measured in pixels appear along the top
and left edges of the pasteboard. As you move objects on the Stage, tick
marks indicate the bounding box positions on the rulers. The x=0 and
y=0 points begin at the upper-left corner of the Stage, with the X values
increasing to the right and the Y values increasing going down.

2. Move your mouse pointer over the top horizontal ruler and drag a guide
down onto the Stage.
A colored line appears on the Stage that you can use as a guide for
alignment.
3. Double-click the guide with the Selection tool.
The Move Guide dialog box appears.
4. Enter 435 as the new pixel value of the guide. Click OK.
The guide is repositioned 435 pixels from the top edge of the Stage.
5. Choose View > Snapping > Snap To Guides and make sure Snap To
Guides is selected.
Objects will now snap to any guides on the Stage.

6. Drag the large robot instance and the hero instance so their bottom
edges align with the guide.
 Tip
Choose View > Guides > Lock Guides to lock your guides. This
prevents you from accidentally moving them. Clear all guides by
choosing View > Guides > Clear Guides. Change the color of the
guides and the snapping accuracy by choosing View > Guides >
Edit Guides.
Changing the Color Effect of an Instance
The Color Effect option in the Properties panel allows you to change several
properties of any instance. These properties include brightness, tint (the overall
coloring), and alpha.
Changing the brightness
Brightness controls how dark or light the instance appears on the Stage.
1. Using the Selection tool, click the smallest robot on the Stage.
2. In the Properties panel, in the Color Effect section choose Brightness
from the Style menu.

3. Drag the Bright slider to −40%.
The robot instance on the Stage becomes darker and appears to recede
into the distance.
Changing the transparency
Alpha is a measure of the level of opacity. Decreasing the alpha value decreases
the fig03-40.jpgopacity and increases the amount of transparency.
1. Click the glowing orb to select it. In the Properties panel you should see
“flare” chosen from the Instance Of menu.
2. In the Properties panel, in the Color Effect section choose Alpha from
the Style menu.

3. Drag the Alpha slider to a value of 50%.
The orb in the flare layer on the Stage becomes semitransparent.
 Tip
To reset the Color Effect of any instance, choose None from
the Style menu.
Understanding Display Options
The Display section in the Properties panel for movie clips offers options for
controlling an instance’s blending and rendering.
Blending effects
Blending refers to how the colors of an instance interact with the colors below it.
You saw how the instance in the flare layer had the Lighten option applied to it

(carried over from Photoshop), which integrated it more with the instance in the
Background layer.
Animate offers a variety of Blending options; you’ll find them listed on the
Blending menu in the Display section of the Properties panel. Some have
surprising results, depending on the colors in the instance and the colors in the
layers below it. Experiment with all the options to understand how they work.
The following figure shows some of the Blending options and their effects on the
robot instance over a blue-black gradient.
Export As Bitmap
The robots and the hero character in this lesson are movie clip symbols
containing complex vector graphics imported from Illustrator. Vector art can be
processor-intensive, and it can take a toll on performance and playback. A
rendering option called Export As Bitmap can help. The Export As Bitmap
option renders the vector art as a bitmap, reducing the performance load (but
increasing memory use). The movie clip still consists of editable vector graphics
in the FLA file, however, so you can still modify the artwork.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Select the hero movie clip instance on the Stage.
3. In the Properties panel, in the Display section choose Export As Bitmap
from the Render menu.

The hero movie clip instance appears as it will be rendered when
published. You fig03-46.jpgmay see a slight “softening” of the
illustration because of the rasterization of the art.
4. In the Bitmap Background menu (below the Render menu), make sure
Transparent is chosen (the default).
The Transparent option renders the background of your movie clip
symbol transparent. Alternatively, you can choose Opaque and pick a
color for the background of your movie clip symbol.
Applying Filters for Special Effects
Use filters to create special effects that you can apply to movie clip instances.
Several filters are available in the Filters section of the Properties panel. Each
filter has different options that can refine the effect.
Applying the Blur filter
You’ll apply the Blur filter to some of the instances to help give the scene a
greater sense of depth.
1. Select the glowing orb in the flare layer.
2. In the Properties panel, expand the Filters section.
3. Click Add Filter at the top of the Filters section and choose Blur from
the menu.
Properties and values for the Blur filter are displayed.
4. If they aren’t linked already, click the link icons next to the Blur X and
Blur Y values to link the blur effect in both directions.
5. Set the value of Blur X and Blur Y to 10 pixels.

The instance on the Stage becomes blurry, helping to give an
atmospheric perspective to this scene.

 Note
It’s best to keep the Quality setting for filters on Low. Higher
settings are processor-intensive and can bog down performance,
especially if you’ve applied multiple filters.
More filter options
At the top-right corner of the Filters section is a menu of commands
that help you manage and apply multiple filters.
Save As Preset lets you save a particular filter and its settings so
you can apply it to another instance. Copy and Paste let you copy
and paste a selected filter or all the filters and apply them to other
instances. The Reset Filter command resets the values for the
selected filter to the defaults. The Enable or Disable Filter button
(the eyeball icon next to the filter name) lets you see your instance
with or without the filter applied.

Positioning Objects in 3D Space
You also have the ability to position and animate objects in real three-
dimensional space. However, objects need to be movie clip symbols to be moved
in 3D. Two tools allow you to position objects in 3D: the 3D Rotation tool and
the 3D Translation tool. The Transform panel also provides information for
position and rotation.
Understanding the 3D coordinate space is essential for successful 3D placement
of objects. Animate divides space using three axes: the x, y, and z axes. The x
axis runs horizontally across the Stage, with x=0 at the left edge. The y axis runs
vertically, with y=0 at the top edge. The z axis runs into and out of the plane of
the Stage (toward and away from the viewer), with z=0 at the plane of the Stage.
 Note
The 3D Rotation and 3D Translation tool are supported only in
ActionScript 3.0 and AIR documents. In HTML5 Canvas and
WebGL documents, the 3D tools are disabled.
Changing the 3D rotation of an object
You’ll add some text to your image, but to add a little more interest, you’ll tilt it
to put it in perspective. Think about the beginning text introduction to the Star
Wars fig03-51.jpgmovies, and see if you can achieve a similar effect.
1. Insert a new layer at the top of the layers stack and rename it text.
2. Select the Text tool from the Tools panel.

3. In the Properties panel, choose Static Text from the Text Type menu.
Choose a striking font and set it to a large size with an interesting color
that will add some pizzazz. Your font might look different from what’s
shown in this lesson, depending on the fonts available on your
computer.
4. Click on the Stage in your text layer and begin typing your title.
5. To exit the Text tool, select the Selection tool.
6. With the text object still selected, choose Modify > Convert To Symbol
(F8).
7. In the Convert To Symbol dialog box, enter title for Name and choose
Movie Clip for Type. Click OK.
Your text is put into a movie clip symbol, and an instance remains on the
Stage.
8. Select the 3D Rotation tool (
).

A circular, multicolored target appears on the instance. This is a guide
for the 3D rotation. It’s useful to think of the guides as lines on a globe.
The red longitudinal line rotates your instance around the x axis. The
green line along the equator rotates your instance around the y axis. The
circular blue guide rotates your instance around the z axis.
9. Drag any one of the guides to rotate your instance in 3D space. A label
will be added to your mouse pointer to show which axis you’re
manipulating.
Drag left or right on the red guide to rotate around the x axis.
Drag up or down on the green guide to rotate around the y axis.
Drag around the circle on the blue guide to rotate around the z axis.
You can also drag the outer orange circular guide to freely rotate the
instance in all three directions.

Global vs. local transformations
When you select the 3D Rotation or 3D Translation tool, be aware
of the Global Transform option (
)], found at the bottom of the
Tools panel when one of the 3D tools is selected. When Global
Transform is selected, the rotation and positioning of 3D objects are
relative to the global, or Stage, coordinate system. The 3D display
over the object that you’re moving shows the three axes in constant
position, no matter how the object is rotated or moved. Notice in the
following image how the 3D display is always perpendicular to the
Stage.
However, when the Global option is turned off (the button is raised),
rotation and positioning are relative to the object. The 3D display
shows the three axes oriented relative to the object, not to the Stage.
For example, in the following image, notice that the 3D Translation
tool shows the z axis pointing out from the rectangle, not from the
Stage.

Changing the 3D position of an object
In addition to changing an object’s rotation in 3D space, you can move it to a
specific point in 3D space. Use the 3D Translation tool, which is hidden under
the 3D Rotation tool.
1. Select the 3D Translation tool (
).
2. Click your text to select it.
A guide appears on the instance. This is a guide for the 3D translation.
The red guide represents the x axis, the green is the y axis, and the blue
is the z axis.
3. Drag any one of the guides to move your instance in 3D space. Notice
that your text stays in perspective as you move it around the Stage.
Drag left or right on the red guide to move along the x axis.

Drag up or down on the green guide to move along the y axis.
Drag up or down on the blue guide to move along the z axis. Dragging up
moves away from you, deeper into the scene, and dragging down moves
toward you.
Resetting the transformation
If you have made a mistake in your 3D transformations and want to reset the
rotation of your instance, you can use the Transform panel.
1. Select the Selection tool and select the instance that you want to reset.
2. Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel.
The Transform panel shows all the values for the x, y, and z rotations
and positions in 3D space.
3. Click Remove Transform in the lower-right corner of the Transform
panel.
The selected instance returns to its original rotation. Reposition your
title with a dramatic 3D rotation to continue.
Understanding the vanishing point and the perspective angle
Objects in 3D space represented on a 2D surface (such as the computer screen)
are rendered with perspective to make them appear as they do in real life.
Correct perspective depends on many factors, including the vanishing point and

the perspective angle, both of which can be changed in Animate.
The vanishing point determines where on the horizon parallel lines of a
perspective drawing converge. Think of railroad tracks and how the parallel
tracks converge to a single point as they recede into the distance. The vanishing
point is usually at eye level in the center of your field of view, so the default
settings are exactly in the middle of the Stage. You can, however, change the
vanishing point setting so it appears above or below eye level, or to the right or
left.
The perspective angle determines how quickly parallel lines converge to the
vanishing point. The greater the angle, the quicker the convergence and,
therefore, the more severe and distorted the illustration appears.
1. Select an object on the Stage that has been moved or rotated in 3D
space.
2. In the Properties panel, expand the 3D Position And View section.
3. Drag on the X and Y values for Vanishing Point Position at the bottom
of the 3D Position And View section to change the vanishing point,
which is indicated on the Stage by intersecting gray lines.

4. To reset the Vanishing Point settings to the default values (to the center
of the Stage), click Reset.
5. Drag on the Perspective Angle value to change the amount of distortion.
The greater the angle, the more the distortion.

Exporting the final art
You have your characters arranged in a strong layout, and you have a dynamic
title. Your composition is complete and ready to be exported. You can export
Animate frames as files in the PNG, GIF, or JPEG bitmap formats.
1. Choose File > Export > Export Image.
The Export Image dialog box appears with a preview of the Stage.
2. In the Preset section, choose PNG-24.
3. Deselect the Transparency option.
4. Make sure the Clip To Stage option is selected in the Image Size
section.
The Clip To Stage option exports only the art that appears within the
boundaries of your Stage.
5. Click Save and choose a filename and destination for your exported
PNG file.
Creating an Adobe Creative Cloud Library to share assets
Creative Cloud Libraries make your favorite assets available to you
anywhere. You can use CC Libraries to create and share your

graphics and more, including colors, brushes, symbols, and even
entire documents. Share and access them across other Creative
Cloud apps whenever you need them. You can also share libraries
with anyone who has a Creative Cloud account, so it’s easy to
collaborate, keep designs consistent, and even create style guides to
use across projects. Your shared library assets are always up to date
and ready to use. CC Libraries work much like the Animate Library
panel you used in this lesson.
To create a new CC Library to share assets, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window > CC Libraries to open the CC Libraries panel,
or click the CC Libraries panel icon.
Your own panel may look different from this, depending on the
contents of your CC Libraries.
2. Click the Library panel menu, and choose Create New Library.
The Create New Library dialog box opens.
3. Enter a new name for your library, and then click Create.
Your new CC Library is created. Click the Plus button at the
bottom of the library to add assets for sharing.

Open the Libraries Options menu and choose Collaborate or
Share Link.
If you choose Collaborate, your browser will open and you can
invite others to view or edit your CC Library. If you choose
Share Link, a public link is created for others to download the
assets from your CC Library.

Review Answers
1 A symbol is a graphic, button, or movie clip that you create once in Animate
and can then reuse throughout your document or in other documents. All
symbols are stored in your Library panel. An instance is a copy of a symbol
located on the Stage.
2 You can create a symbol by choosing Insert > New Symbol, or you can select
existing objects on the Stage and choose Modify > Convert To Symbol. A
third way to create a symbol is to import graphics from Illustrator or
Photoshop and create a symbol during the import process.
3 When you convert layers of an Illustrator file to Animate layers, Animate

recognizes the layers in the Illustrator document and adds them as separate
layers in the Timeline. When you import layers as keyframes, Animate adds
each Illustrator layer to a separate frame in the Timeline and creates
keyframes for them.
4 The transparency of an instance is determined by its alpha value. To change
the transparency, select Alpha from the Color Effect menu in the Properties
panel, and then change the alpha percentage.
5 To edit a symbol, either double-click the symbol in the library to enter
symbol-editing mode, or double-click the instance on the Stage to edit it in
place. Editing a symbol in place lets you see the other objects around the
instance.

4. Animating Symbols
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Animate the position, scale, and rotation of objects
Adjust the pacing and timing of your animation
Animate transparency and special effects
Change the path of an object’s motion
Create nested animation
Split a motion tween
Change the easing of an object’s motion
Animate in 3D space
This lesson will take about two hours to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

Use Adobe Animate CC to change almost any aspect of an object—position,
color, transparency, size, rotation, and more—over time. Motion tweening is
the basic technique of creating animation with symbol instances.
Getting Started
Start by viewing the finished movie file to see the animated title page that you’ll
create in this lesson.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.
See “Getting Started” at the beginning of the book.
1. Double-click the 04End.mp4 file in the Lesson04/04End folder to play
the final animation, which was exported as a video file.

The project is an animated opener that would be placed on a website for
an imaginary soon-to-be-released motion picture. In this lesson, you’ll
use motion tweens to animate several components on the page: the
cityscape, the main actors, several old-fashioned cars, and the main title.
2. Close the 04End.mp4 file.
3. Double-click the 04Start.fla file in the Lesson04/04Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate. This file is an ActionScript 3.0
document that is partially completed and already contains many of the
graphic elements imported into the library for you to use. You’ll use all
the animation functionality available in an ActionScript 3.0 document,
but instead of using the Flash Player for playback in a browser, you’ll
export an MP4 video file.
4. From the view options above the Stage, choose Fit In Window, or
choose View > Magnification > Fit In Window, so that you can see the
entire Stage on your computer screen.
5. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 04_workingcopy.fla, and save it
in the 04Start folder.
Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be
available if you want to start over.
About Animation
Animation is the movement, or change, of objects through time. Animation can

be as simple as moving a box across the Stage from one frame to the next. It can
also be much more complex. As you’ll see in this lesson, you can animate many
different aspects of a single object. You can change an object’s position on the
Stage, change its color or transparency, change its size or rotation, or animate the
special filters that you saw in the previous lesson. You also have control over an
object’s path of motion and even its easing, which is the way an object
accelerates or decelerates.
In Animate, the basic workflow for animation goes like this: Select an object on
the Stage, right-click, and choose Create Motion Tween from the context menu.
Move the red playhead to a different point in time and move the object to a new
position or change one of its properties. Animate takes care of the rest by
smoothly interpolating the changes between the two points in time.
Motion tweens create animation for changes in position on the Stage and for
changes in size, color, or other attributes. Motion tweens require you to use a
symbol instance. If the object you’ve selected is not a symbol instance, Animate
will automatically ask to convert the selection to a symbol.
Animate also automatically separates motion tweens onto their own layers,
which are called tween layers. There can be only one motion tween per layer,
and there can be no other element on the layer. Tween layers allow you to
change various attributes of your instance at different key points over time. For
example, a spaceship could be on the left side of the Stage at the beginning
keyframe and at the far-right side of the Stage at an ending keyframe, and the
resulting tween would make the spaceship fly across the Stage.
The term “tween” comes from the world of classic animation. Senior animators
would be responsible for drawing the beginning and ending poses for their
characters. The beginning and ending poses were the keyframes of the
animation. Junior animators would then come in and draw the “in-between”
frames, or do the “in-betweening.” Hence, “tweening” refers to the smooth
transitions between keyframes.
Understanding the Project File
The 04Start.fla file contains a few of the animated elements already or partially
completed. Each of the six layers—man, woman, Middle_car, Right_car, footer,
and ground—contains an animation. The man and woman layers are in a folder
called actors, and the Middle_car and Right_car layers are in a folder called cars.

You’ll be adding more layers to create an animated cityscape, refining the
animation of one of the actors and adding a third car and a 3D title. All the
necessary graphic elements have been imported into the library. The Stage is set
at 1280 pixels by 787 pixels, and the Stage color is black. You might need to
choose a different view option to see the entire Stage. Choose View >
Magnification > Fit In Window, or choose Fit In Window from the view options
at the upper-right corner of the Stage, to view the Stage at a magnification
percentage that fits your screen.
Animating Position
You’ll start this project by animating the cityscape. It will begin slightly lower
than the top edge of the Stage and then rise slowly until its top is aligned with
the top of the Stage.
1. Lock all the existing layers so you don’t accidentally modify them.
Create a new layer above the footer layer and rename it city.

2. Drag the bitmap image called cityBG.jpg from the bitmaps folder in the
Library panel to the Stage.
3. In the Properties panel, set the value of X to 0 and the value of Y to 90.

This positions the cityscape image just slightly below the top edge of the
Stage.
4. Right-click the cityscape image and choose Create Motion Tween, or
choose Insert > Motion Tween.
5. A dialog box appears warning you that your selected object is not a
symbol. Motion tweens require symbols. Animate asks if you want to
convert the selection to a symbol so it can proceed with the motion
tween. Click OK.
Animate automatically converts your selection to a symbol, with the
default name Symbol 1, and stores it in your Library panel. Animate

also converts the current layer to a tween layer so you can begin to
animate the instance. Tween layers are distinguished by a special icon in
front of the layer name, and the frames are tinted blue. The range of
frames covered by the tween is the tween span. The tween span is
represented by all the colored frames from the first keyframe to the last
keyframe. Tween layers are reserved for motion tweens; hence, no
drawing is allowed on a tween layer.
6. Move the red playhead to the end of the tween span, at frame 191.
7. Select the instance of the cityscape on the Stage, and while holding
down the Shift key, move the instance up the Stage.
Holding down the Shift key constrains the movement to right angles.
8. For more precision, set the value of Y to 0 in the Properties panel.
A small black diamond appears in frame 191 at the end of the tween
span. This indicates a keyframe at the end of the tween.
Animate smoothly interpolates the change in position from frame 1 to
frame 191 and represents that motion with a motion path on the Stage.

9. Drag the red playhead back and forth at the top of the Timeline to see
the smooth motion. You can also choose Control > Play (or press
Enter/Return) to make Animate play the animation.
Animating changes in position is simple because Animate automatically
creates keyframes at the points where you move your instance to new
positions. If you want to have an object move to many different points,
simply move the red playhead to the desired frame and then move the
object to its new position. Animate takes care of the rest.
 Tip
Hide all the other layers to isolate the cityscape and to
better see the results of the motion tween.
 Tip
Remove a motion tween by right-clicking the motion tween
on the Timeline or the Stage and choosing Remove Tween.
Preview the animation
Integrated into the bottom of the Timeline is a set of playback controls. These
controls allow you to play, rewind, or go step by step backward or forward
through your Timeline to review your animation in a controlled manner. You can
also use fig04-013.jpgthe playback commands on the Control menu.

1. Click any of the playback buttons on the controller below the Timeline
to go to the first frame, go to the last frame, play, stop, or move forward
or backward one frame.
2. Select Loop option (to the right of the controller), and then click the
Play button.
The playhead loops, allowing you to see the animation over and over for
careful analysis.
3. Move the start or end markers in the Timeline header to define the range
of frames that you want to see looped.
The playhead loops within the marked frames. Click Loop Option again
to turn it off.
 Tip
You can also use the Time Scrub tool (hidden under the
Hand tool) to move back and forth on the Timeline to
preview your animation. Choose the Time Scrub tool (or
hold down Spacebar+T) and drag back and forth on the
Stage.
Changing the Pacing and Timing
You can change the duration of the entire tween span or change the timing of the
animation by dragging keyframes on the Timeline.
Changing the animation duration
If you want the animation to proceed at a slower pace (and thus take up a much

longer period of time), you need to lengthen the entire tween span between the
beginning and end keyframes. If you want to shorten the animation, you need to
decrease the tween span. Lengthen or shorten a motion tween by dragging its
ends on the Timeline.
1. Move your mouse pointer close to the end of the tween span in the city
layer.
Your pointer’s cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, indicating that
you can lengthen or shorten the tween span.
2. Drag the end of the tween span back to frame 60.
Your motion tween shortens to 60 frames, reducing the time it takes the
cityscape to move.
3. Move your mouse pointer close to the beginning of the tween span (at
frame 1).
4. Drag the beginning of the frame span forward to frame 10.
Your motion tween begins at an earlier time, so it now plays only from

frame 10 to frame 60.
 Note
If you have multiple keyframes in a tween, changing the
length of the tween span by dragging one end or the other
will distribute all your keyframes uniformly. The timing of
your entire animation remains the same; only the length
changes.
Adding frames
You’ll want the last keyframe of your motion tween to hold for the remainder of
the animation. Add frames by Shift-dragging the end of a tween span.
1. Move your mouse cursor close to the end of the tween span.
2. Hold down the Shift key and drag the end of the tween span forward to
frame 191.
The last keyframe in the motion tween remains at frame 60, but Animate
adds frames through frame 191.

 Tip
You can also add individual frames by choosing Insert >
Timeline > Frame (F5), or remove individual frames by
choosing Edit > Timeline > Remove Frames (Shift+F5).
Moving keyframes
If you want to change the pacing of an animation, you can select individual
keyframes and then drag them to new positions.
1. Click the keyframe at frame 60.
The keyframe at frame 60 is selected. A tiny box appears next to your
mouse pointer, indicating that you can move the keyframe.
2. Drag the keyframe to frame 40.
The last keyframe in the motion tween moves to frame 40, so the motion
of the cityscape proceeds more quickly.

Span-based vs. frame-based selection
By default, Animate uses frame-based selection, which means you
can select individual keyframes within a motion tween. However, if
you prefer to click a motion tween and have the entire span (the
beginning and end keyframes, and all the frames in between) be
selected, you can enable Span Based Selection from the Options
menu on the upper-right corner of the Timeline (or you can Shift-
click to select the entire span).
With Span Based Selection enabled, you can click anywhere within
the motion tween to select it, and move the whole animation
backward or forward along the Timeline as a single unit.
If you want to select individual keyframes while Span Based
Selection is enabled, hold down the Ctrl/Command key and click a
keyframe.
Moving keyframes vs. changing time in tween spans

Managing the timing of your animation by moving keyframes and
stretching or squashing tween spans can sometimes be frustrating
because you will get different outcomes depending on what you’ve
selected on the Timeline and how you drag those selections.
If you want to simply move the location of a keyframe within a
tween span, make sure that only a single keyframe is selected, and
that the tiny box appears next to your mouse cursor before you
begin dragging the keyframe to a new location.
If you want to select individual keyframes while Span Based
Selection is enabled, hold down the Ctrl/Command key and click a
keyframe.
Consider the following animation, where a ball moves from the left
side of the Stage to the bottom edge and then to the right side,
making a figure “V.” On the Timeline, three keyframes mark the
three positions of the ball.
Moving the middle keyframe changes the timing of when the ball
hits the bottom of the Stage.

When you select a span of frames within a tween, you can compress
or expand its duration by dragging the selection when the double-
headed arrow appears near the right edge of the selection.

Finally, a double-headed arrow with a vertical break indicates that
you can change the position of the separation between two different
tweens.
Understanding frame rate
The speed of your animation is tied to the frame rate of your
document (shown in the Properties section of the Properties panel),
but do not modify the frame rate in order to change the speed or
duration of your animation.
The frame rate determines how many frames on the Timeline make
up one second of time. The default is 24 frames per second (fps).
The seconds are marked on the Timeline. Frame rate is a measure of
how smooth an animation appears—the higher the frame rate, the
more frames there are to show the action. Animations at slower
frame rates appear choppy because there are fewer frames to show
the action. Slow-motion videography depends on very high frame
rates in order to capture action that happens very quickly, such as a
speeding bullet or a falling water droplet.

If you want to modify the overall duration or speed of your
animation, don’t change the frame rate. Instead, add or delete
frames from your Timeline.
If you want to change the frame rate but keep the overall duration
constant, select the Scale Frame Spans option in the Properties
panel before you modify the frame rate.
Animating Transparency
In the previous lesson, you learned how to change the color effect of any symbol
instance to change the transparency, tint, or brightness. You can change the color
effect of an instance in one keyframe and change the value of the color effect in
another keyframe, and Animate will automatically display a smooth change, just
as it does with changes in position.
You’ll change the cityscape in the beginning keyframe to be totally transparent
but keep the cityscape in the ending keyframe opaque. Animate will create a
smooth fade-in effect.
1. Move the red playhead to the first keyframe of the motion tween (frame
10).

2. Select the cityscape instance on the Stage.
3. In the Color Effect section of the Properties panel, choose Alpha from
the Style menu.
4. Set the Alpha value to 0%.
The cityscape instance on the Stage becomes totally transparent.

5. Move the red playhead to the last keyframe of the motion tween (frame
40).
6. Make sure that the cityscape instance on the Stage is still selected.
7. In the Properties panel, in the Color Effect section, set the Alpha value
to 100%.
The cityscape instance on the Stage becomes totally opaque.

8. Preview the effect by choosing Control > Play (or pressing
Enter/Return).
Animate interpolates the changes in both position and transparency
between the two keyframes.
Animating Filters
Filters, which give instances special effects such as blurs and drop shadows, can
also be animated. You’ll next refine the motion tween of the actors by applying a
blur filter to one of them to make it appear as if the camera changes focus.
Animating filters is no different from animating changes in position or changes
in color effect. You simply set the values for a filter at one keyframe and set
different values for the filter at another keyframe, and Animate creates a smooth
transition.
 Note
Filters can not be animated in an HTML5 Canvas document.
1. Make sure that the actors layer folder on the Timeline is visible.
2. Unlock the woman layer.
3. Move the red playhead to the beginning keyframe of the motion tween
in the woman layer, at frame 23.

4. Select the instance of the woman on the Stage. You won’t be able to see
her because she has an alpha value of 0% (totally transparent). Click the
upper-right side of the Stage to select the transparent instance. Or, click
the woman layer in the Timeline to highlight it; then click within the
outline that appears on the Stage.
5. In the Properties panel, expand the Filters section.
6. Click the Add Filter (+) button in the Filters section, and choose Blur
from the menu to add a blur to the instance.

7. In the Filters section of the Properties panel, make sure that the link
icons are selected in order to apply equal values to the x and y
directions. Set the Blur X value to 20 pixels.
The Blur Y value also changes to 20 pixels.
8. Move the red playhead across the entire Timeline to preview the
animation.
The woman instance is blurred throughout the motion tween.

9. Right-click the woman layer at frame 140, and choose Insert Keyframe
> Filter.
Animate establishes a keyframe for filters at frame 140.
10. Move the red playhead to frame 160, right-click the woman layer, and
choose Insert Keyframe > Filter to add another filter keyframe.
11. Select the instance of the woman on the Stage at frame 160.
12. In the Properties panel, change the value of the Blur filter to X=0 and

Y=0.
The Blur filter changes from the keyframe at frame 140 to the keyframe
at 160. Animate creates a smooth transition from a blurry instance to an
in-focus instance.
Understanding property keyframes
Changes in properties are independent of one another and do not
need to be tied to the same keyframes. That is, you can have a
keyframe for position, a different keyframe for the color effect, and
yet another keyframe for a filter. Managing many different kinds of
keyframes can become overwhelming, especially if you want
different properties to change at different times during the motion
tween. Fortunately, Animate CC provides a few helpful tools for
keyframe management.
When viewing the tween span, you can choose to view the
keyframes of only certain properties. For example, you can choose
to view only the Position keyframes so that you can see when your
object moves. Or, you can choose to view only the Filter keyframes

so that you can see when a filter changes. Right-click a motion
tween in the Timeline, choose View Keyframes, and then select the
desired property from the list. You can also choose All or None to
see all the properties or none of the properties.
When inserting a keyframe, you can also insert a keyframe specific
to the property you want to change. Right-click a motion tween in
the Timeline, choose Insert Keyframes, and then select the desired
property.
You can also view an advanced panel, called the Motion Editor, to
see and edit how the different properties of your object change over
the course of the motion tween. You’ll learn more about the Motion
Editor in the next lesson.
Animating Transformations
Now you’ll learn how to animate changes in scale or rotation. These kinds of
changes are made with the Free Transform tool or with the Transform panel.
You’ll add a third car to the project. The car will start small, and then become
larger as it appears to move forward toward the viewer.

1. Lock all the layers on the Timeline.
2. Insert a new layer inside the cars folder, and rename it Left_car.
3. Select frame 75 and insert a new keyframe (F6).
4. Drag the movie clip symbol called carLeft from the Library panel to the
Stage at frame 75.
5. Select the Free Transform tool.
The transformation handles appear around the instance on the Stage.

6. While holding down the Shift key, drag a corner handle inward to make
the car smaller.
7. In the Properties panel, make sure that the width of the graphic is about
400 pixels.
Alternatively, you can use the Transform panel (Window > Transform)
and change the scale of the car to about 29.4%.
8. Move the car to its starting position at about X=710 and Y=488.
9. In the Properties panel, in the Color Effect section, choose Alpha from
the Style menu.

10. Set the Alpha value to 0%.
The car becomes totally transparent.
11. Right-click the car on the Stage and choose Create Motion Tween.
The current layer becomes a tween layer.
12. Move the red playhead on the Timeline to frame 100.
13. Select the transparent instance of the car on the Stage, and in the
Properties panel, change the Alpha value to 100%.
A new keyframe is automatically inserted at frame 100 to indicate the
change in transparency.
14. While holding down the Shift key, drag a corner handle outward to
make the car larger. For more precision, use the Properties panel and set
the dimensions of the car to width=1380 pixels and height=445.05
pixels.
15. Position the car at X=607 and Y=545.

You have used Animate to tween the change in position and the change
in scale as well as the change in transparency from frame 75 to frame
100.
16. Move the Left_car layer in between the Middle_car and Right_car
layers so that the car in the center overlaps the cars on the side.
Save your progress so far in this document, 04_workingcopy.fla. In the
next section, you’ll work with a different file.
 Tip
Holding down the Alt/Option key while dragging one

corner handle of the bounding box causes the box to resize
relative to the opposite corner rather than relative to the
object’s transformation point (usually the center).
Changing the Path of the Motion
The motion tween of the left car that you just animated shows a colored line with
dots indicating the path of the motion. You can easily edit the path of the motion
to make the car travel in a curve, or you can move, scale, or rotate the path just
like any other object on the Stage.
To better demonstrate how you can edit the path of the motion, open the sample
file 04MotionPath.fla in the Lesson04/04Start folder. The file contains a single
tween layer with a rocket ship moving from the top left of the Stage toward the
bottom right.
Moving the path of the motion
You will move the path of the motion so that the relative movement of the rocket
ship remains the same but its starting and ending positions change.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Click the path of the motion to select it.
The path of the motion becomes highlighted.

3. Drag the motion path to move it to a different place on the Stage.
The relative motion and timing of the animation remain the same, but
the starting and ending positions are relocated.
Changing the scale or rotation of the path
You can also manipulate the path of the object’s motion using the Free
Transform tool.
1. Select the path of the motion.
2. Select the Free Transform tool.
Transformation handles appear around the path of the motion.

3. Scale or rotate the path of the motion as desired. You can make the path
smaller or larger, or rotate the path so that the rocket ship starts from the
bottom left of the Stage and ends at the top right.
Editing the path of the motion
Making your objects travel on a curved path is a simple matter. You can edit the
path with Bezier precision using anchor point handles, or you can edit the path in
a more intuitive manner with the Selection tool.
1. Select the Convert Anchor Point tool, which is hidden under the Pen

tool.
2. Click the starting point or the ending point of the motion path on the
Stage, and drag the control handle out from the anchor point.
The handle on the anchor point controls the curvature of the path.
3. Select the Subselection tool.
4. Drag the handle at each end of the path to edit its curve. Make the
rocket ship travel in a wide curve.

 Tip
You can also directly manipulate the path of the motion
with the Selection tool. Select the Selection tool and make
sure the path is deselected. Move your pointer close to the
path of the motion. A curved icon appears next to your
pointer, indicating that you can edit the path. Drag the path
of the motion to change its curvature. Choose the spots
where you drag carefully! Each drag breaks the path into
smaller segments, making it harder to achieve a smooth
curve. Mastery will come with practice.
Orienting objects to the path
Sometimes the orientation of the object traveling along the path is important. In
the motion picture promotional project, the orientation of the car is constant as it
moves forward. However, in the rocket ship example, the rocket ship should
follow the path with its nose pointed in the direction in which it is heading.
Orient To Path in the Properties panel gives you this option.

1. Select the motion tween on the Timeline (Shift-click to select the whole
tween).
2. In the Properties panel, under Rotation, select the Orient To Path option.
Animate inserts keyframes for rotation along the motion tween to orient
the nose of the rocket ship to the path of the motion.
 Tip
To direct the nose of the rocket ship, or any other object,
along the path of its motion, you must orient its position so
that it is facing in the direction that you want it to travel.
Use the Free Transform tool to rotate its initial position so
that it is oriented correctly.
Swapping Tween Targets
The motion tween model in Animate CC is object based. This means that an
object and its motion are independent of each other, and you can easily swap out
the target of a motion tween. If, for example, you’d rather see an alien moving
around the Stage instead of a rocket ship, you can replace the target of the
motion tween with an alien symbol from your Library panel and still preserve
the animation.

1. Drag the movie clip symbol of the alien from the Library panel onto the
rocket ship.
Animate asks if you want to replace the existing tween target object with
a new object.
 Note
You can also use the Properties panel to swap instances.
Select the object that you want to swap on the Stage. In the
Properties panel, click the Swap button. In the dialog box
that appears, choose a new symbol and click OK. Animate
will swap the target of the motion tween.
2. Click OK.
Animate replaces the rocket ship with the alien. The motion remains the
same, but the target of the motion tween has changed.

 Note
If your symbol instance disappears from view after the
symbol swap, choose View > Magnification > Show All
(Ctrl+3/Cmd+3) to change the zoom level to show all
objects on the Stage.
Creating Nested Animations
Often, an object that is animated on the Stage will have its own animation. For
example, the wings of a butterfly moving across the Stage may flap as it moves.
Or the alien that you swapped with the rocket ship could be waving his arms.
These kinds of animations are called nested animations because they are
contained inside the movie clip symbols. Movie clip symbols have their own
timeline that is independent of the main Timeline.
In this example, you’ll give the alien his own independent movement so he can
wave as he flies across the Stage.
Creating animations inside movie clip symbols
We’ll animate some of the symbols that make up the alien’s body to allow him to
wave.
1. In the Library panel, double-click the alien movie clip symbol icon.
You are now in symbol-editing mode for the alien movie clip symbol.
The alien appears in the middle of the Stage. In the Timeline, the parts
of the alien are separated in layers.

2. Select the Selection tool.
3. Right-click the alien’s left arm and choose Create Motion Tween.
Animate converts the current layer into a tween layer and inserts 1
second’s worth of frames so that you can begin to animate the instance.
4. Select the Free Transform tool.

5. Move the mouse pointer near the corner transformation handle until the
cursor changes to the rotation icon. Drag the corner handle near the
hand to rotate the arm upward to the alien’s shoulder height.
A keyframe is inserted at the end of the motion tween. The left arm
rotates smoothly from the resting position to the outstretched position.
6. Move the red playhead back to frame 1.
7. Now create a motion tween for the alien’s other arm. Right-click his
right arm and choose Create Motion Tween.
The current layer is converted into a tween layer, and 1 second’s worth
of frames are inserted.
8. Choose the Free Transform tool if it’s not selected already.
9. As you did for the left arm, drag the corner transformation handle near
the right hand to rotate the arm upward to the alien’s shoulder height.
Animate inserts a keyframe at the end of the motion tween. The arm
rotates smoothly from the resting position to the outstretched position.
10. Select the last frame in all the other layers and insert frames (F5) so that
the head, body, and feet all remain on the Stage for the same amount of
time as the moving arms.

11. Click the Scene 1 button in the Edit bar at the top of the Stage to exit
symbol-editing mode.
Your animation of the alien raising his arms is complete. Wherever you
use the movie clip symbol, the alien’s nested animation will continue to
play.
12. Preview the animation by choosing Control > Test.
Animate opens a window showing the exported animation. The alien
moves along the motion path while the nested animation of his arms
moving plays and loops.
13. Save your project and close it. You’ll return to your previous animation
in the next section.

 Note
Animations inside movie clip symbols will loop
automatically. To prevent the looping, you need to add code
to tell the movie clip timeline to stop on its last frame.
You’ll learn to control those timelines with ActionScript or
JavaScript in later lessons.
 Note
Animations inside movie clip symbols won’t play on the
main Timeline. Choose Control > Test to preview nested
animations.
Easing
Easing refers to the way in which a motion tween proceeds. You can think of
easing as acceleration or deceleration. An object that moves from one side of the
Stage to the other side can start off slowly, then build up speed, and then stop
suddenly. Or the object can start off quickly and then gradually slow to a halt.
Your keyframes indicate the beginning and end points of the motion, but the
easing determines how your object gets from one keyframe to the next.
A simple way to apply easing to a motion tween is to use the Properties panel.
Easing values range from −100 to 100. A negative value creates a more gradual
change from the starting position (known as an ease-in). A positive value creates
a gradual slowdown (known as an ease-out).
A more advanced way of applying eases to a motion tween is to use the new
Motion Editor, which you’ll learn about in the next lesson.
Splitting a motion tween
Easing affects the entire span of a motion tween. If you want the easing to affect
only frames between keyframes of a longer motion tween, you should split the
motion tween. For example, return to the 04_workingcopy.fla file of the
cinematic animation. The motion tween of the car in the Left_car layer begins at
frame 75 and ends at frame 191, at the very end of the Timeline. However, the
actual movement of the car starts at frame 75 and ends at frame 100. You’ll split
the motion tween so that you can apply an ease to the tween just from frame 75
to frame 100.

1. In the Left_car layer, select frame 101, which is the frame just after the
second keyframe, where the car ends its movement.
2. Right-click frame 101 and choose Split Motion.
The motion tween is cut into two separate tween spans. The end of the
first tween is identical to the beginning of the second tween.
3. In the Middle_car layer, select frame 94, right-click, and choose Split
Motion to cut the motion tween into two separate tween spans.
4. In the Right_car layer, select frame 107, right-click, and choose Split
Motion to cut the motion tween into two spans.
The motion tweens of all three cars have now been split.

Applying eases to motion tweens
You’ll apply an ease-in to the motion tweens of the approaching cars to give
them a sense of weight and to make them decelerate, as real cars would.
1. In the Middle_car layer, select any frame between the first and second
keyframes of the first motion tween (frame 70 to frame 93).
2. In the Ease section of the Properties panel, enter 100 for the Ease value.
This applies an ease-out to the motion tween.
3. In the Left_car layer, select any frame between the first and second
keyframes of the first motion tween (frame 75 to frame 100).
4. In the Properties panel, enter 100 for the Ease value to apply an ease-out
to the motion tween.
5. In the Right_car layer, select any frame between the first and second
keyframes of the first motion tween (frame 78 to frame 106).

6. In the Properties panel, enter 100 for the Ease value to apply an ease-out
to the motion tween.
7. Select Loop at the bottom of the Timeline and move the start and end
markers in the Timeline header to frames 60 and 115, respectively.
8. Click Play (Enter/Return).
Animate plays the Timeline in a loop between frames 60 and 115 so you
can examine the ease-out motion of the three cars.
Frame-by-Frame Animation
Frame-by-frame animation is a technique that creates the illusion of movement
by making incremental changes between every keyframe. Frame-by-frame
animation in Animate is similar to traditional hand-drawn cel animation, where
each drawing is on a separate sheet of paper, and it’s just as tedious.
Frame-by-frame animations increase your file size rapidly because Animate has
to store the contents for each keyframe. Use frame-by-frame animation
sparingly.
In the next section, you’ll insert a frame-by-frame animation inside the carLeft
movie clip symbol to make it move up and down in a jittery fashion. When the
movie clip loops, the car will rumble slightly to simulate the idle of the motor.

Inserting a new keyframe
The frame-by-frame animations inside the carMiddle and carRight movie clip
symbols have already been done. You’ll finish the animation for the carLeft
symbol.
1. In the Library panel, double-click the carRight movie clip symbol to
examine its completed frame-by-frame animation.
Inside the carRight movie clip, three keyframes establish three different
positions for the car and its headlights. The keyframes are spaced
unevenly to provide the unpredictable up and down motion.
2. In the Library panel, double-click the carLeft movie clip symbol.
You enter symbol-editing mode for the carLeft symbol.
3. Select frame 2 in both the lights layer and the smallRumble layer.

4. Right-click and choose Insert Keyframe (F6).
Animate inserts a keyframe in frame 2 of the lights layer and the
smallRumble layer. The contents of the previous keyframes are copied
into the new keyframes.
 Tip
If the image of the car isn’t visible, select Fit In Window
from the Zoom menu in the upper-right corner of the Stage.
Changing the graphics
In the new keyframe, change the appearance of the contents to create the
animation.
1. In frame 2, select all three graphics (the car and its two headlights) on
the Stage (Edit > Select All, or Ctrl+A/Command+A) and move them
down the Stage by 1 pixel. Use the Properties panel to decrease the Y-
position value by 1 pixel, or press the Down Arrow key to nudge the
graphics by 1 pixel.
The car and its headlights move down slightly.
2. Next, repeat the process of inserting keyframes and changing the
graphics. For a random motion like an idling car, using at least three
keyframes is ideal.
Select frame 4 in both the lights layer and the smallRumble layer.
3. Right-click and choose Insert Keyframe (F6).
Keyframes are inserted into frame 4 of the lights and smallRumble

layers. The contents of the previous keyframes are copied into the new
keyframes.
4. Select all three graphics on the Stage (Edit > Select All, or
Ctrl+A/Command+A) and move them up the Stage by 2 pixels. You can
use the Properties panel or press the Up Arrow key twice to nudge the
graphics by 2 pixels.
The car and its headlights move up slightly.
5. Test the idling motion by enabling the Loop Playback option at the
bottom of the Timeline and clicking Play (Enter/Return).
 Note
In this section, you created the car’s idling motion by
manually moving the car’s position frame by frame. In the
next lesson, you’ll learn to use the Refine Tween panel,
which can automatically modify your motion tween to
simulate natural movements such as bounces or random
jitters (as in the idling of a car).
 Tip
You can navigate quickly between multiple keyframes by
choosing Control > Step Forward To Next Keyframe
(Ctrl/Cmd+.) or Control > Step Backward To Previous
Keyframe (Ctrl/Cmd+,). You can also click the forward-
pointing or backward-pointing arrow in front of your layer
name on the Timeline to move to the next or previous
keyframe, respectively.
Animating 3D Motion
Finally, you’ll add a title and animate it in 3D space. Animating in 3D presents
the added complication of a third axis (z). When you choose the 3D Rotation or
3D Translation tool, you need to be aware of the Global Transform option at the

bottom of the Tools panel. (The tools and the Global Transform option were
introduced in the Lesson 3 section “Positioning Objects in 3D Space.”) Global
Transform toggles between a global option (button selected) and a local option
(button deselected). Moving an object with the global option selected makes the
transformation relative to the global coordinate system, whereas moving an
object with the local option on makes the transformation relative to itself.
1. Click Scene 1 in the Edit bar to return to the main Timeline. Insert a
new layer at the top of the layer stack and rename it title.
2. Lock all the other layers.
3. Insert a new keyframe at frame 120.
4. Drag the movie clip symbol called movietitle from the Library panel
onto the Stage.
The movietitle instance appears in your new layer in the keyframe at
frame 120.
5. Position the title in the empty sky at x=180 and y=90.

6. Right-click the movie title and choose Create Motion Tween.
Animate converts the current layer to a tween layer so that you can
begin to animate the instance.
7. Move the red playhead to frame 140.
8. Select the 3D Rotation tool 
.
The 3D rotation control appears on the selected movie clip.

9. Deselect the Global Transform option (
) at the bottom of the Tools
panel to put the 3D Rotation tool into local mode.
10. Drag upward on the left arm of the green Y control to rotate the title
around the y axis to angle it so that it seems to recede into the distance.
Its angle is at about −50 degrees. You can check the rotation values in
the Transform panel (Window > Transform).
11. Move the red playhead to the first keyframe, at frame 120.
12. Drag upward on the Y control to rotate the title around the y axis in the

opposite direction so that the instance looks like just a sliver.
The change in the 3D rotation becomes a motion tween, so the title
appears to swing in three dimensions.
 Note
Animating the 3D rotation or translation of a symbol is not
currently supported in HTML5 Canvas documents or in
WebGL documents.
Exporting Your Final Movie
You can quickly preview your animation by “scrubbing” the red playhead back
and forth on the Timeline, by choosing Control > Play, or by using the Time
Scrub tool from the Tools panel. You can also use the integrated controller at the
bottom of the Timeline. But to create your final project as a movie, you must
export it.
Create an MP4 movie file by exporting the project and converting it in Media
Encoder, a freestanding application that comes packaged with Animate (you’ll
learn more about Media Encoder in Lesson 11).
1. Choose File > Export > Export Video.
The Export Video dialog box opens.
2. Keep the Render Size at its original dimensions. Select the Convert
Video In Adobe Media Encoder option. Click Browse to select the

destination filename and location. Click Export.
Animate generates a SWF file (.swf) and then saves a MOV (.mov) file
from it. Adobe Media Encoder automatically launches.
3. In Adobe Media Encoder, notice that your MOV file is already added to
the Queue panel.
4. In the Queue panel’s Preset menu, choose Match Source – Medium
Bitrate.
The Match Source – Medium Bitrate setting keeps the dimensions of the
source file and balances file size and quality.
5. Click the Start Queue button (the green triangle) or press Enter/Return
to begin the encoding process.
6. Media Encoder converts the MOV file into an H.264-formatted video
with the standard .mp4 extension.

Congratulations—you’re done! The final file can be uploaded to
Facebook, YouTube, or other video sharing sites, or put up on a
promotional website for the fictional cinematic release.
Review Questions
1 What are two requirements of a motion tween?
2 What kinds of properties can a motion tween change in an ActionScript 3.0
document?
3 What are property keyframes, and why are they important?
4 How can you edit the path of an object’s motion?
5 What does easing do to a motion tween?

Review Answers
1 A motion tween requires a symbol instance on the Stage and its own layer,
which is called a tween layer. No other tween or drawing object can exist on
the tween layer.
2 A motion tween creates between different keyframes smooth transitions of an
object’s location, scale, rotation, transparency, brightness, tint, filter values, or
3D rotation or translation.
3 A keyframe marks a change in one or more properties of an object. Keyframes
are specific to each property, so a motion tween can have keyframes for
position that are different from keyframes for transparency.
4 To edit the path of an object’s motion, choose the Selection tool and drag
directly on the path to bend it. You can also choose the Convert Anchor Point
tool and Subselection tool to pull out handles at the anchor points. The
handles control the curvature of the path.
5 Easing changes the rate of change in a motion tween. Without easing, a
motion tween proceeds linearly, where the same amount of change happens
over time. An ease-in makes an object begin its animation slowly, and an ease-
out makes an object end its animation slowly.

This lesson will take about one hour to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

The advanced Motion Editor in Adobe Animate CC makes creating
complicated animation fast and easy. Use the Motion Editor to view how the
properties of your motion tween change over time, and apply eases for
sophisticated effects.
Getting Started
Start by viewing the finished movie file to see the animated infographic that
you’ll create in this lesson.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.
See Getting Started at the beginning of the book.
1. Double-click the 05End.html file in the Lesson05/05End folder to play

the animation in a browser.
The project is a short animated infographic illustrating the idea of China
as an emerging economic threat to the highest-traded currencies in the
world. The animation is something you might see accompanying a story
in the business and economy section of a news site. In the animation,
blocks with the American, European Union, and Japanese flags,
representing the Dollar, the Euro, and the Yen, respectively, stack
themselves up. A moment later, a large hand with the Chinese flag
bumps the stack, sending them tumbling down. In this lesson, you’ll use
the Motion Editor to make refinements in the motion tweening of the
blocks, including the bouncing movements as they fall.
2. Close the 05End.html file.
3. Double-click the 05Start.fla file in the Lesson05/05Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate. This file is an HTML5 Canvas
document that already contains all the graphics created for you, with

movie clip symbols saved in the library. Each of the graphics has its
own layer, and instances of the symbols have been placed on the Stage
in their initial positions.
4. Choose View > Magnification > Clip to Stage to deselect the option (or
deselect the Clip Content Outside The Stage button above the Stage) to
enable the pasteboard so that you can see all the graphics positioned just
off the Stage.
5. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 05_workingcopy.fla, and save it
in the 05Start folder.
Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be
available if you want to start over.

About the Motion Editor
You don’t have to use the Motion Editor at all to create your animations.
However, if you’re dealing with a motion tween that contains multiple properties
that change at different times through the animation (for example, a rocket that
fades and rotates as it moves across the Stage), or if you’re handling animation
that mimics real-world physics (like bounces and springs), then the Motion
Editor can make your task much simpler.
The Motion Editor is an advanced panel that is integrated into the Timeline and
accessible only when editing a motion tween. The panel shows you how the
properties of your animation change over the course of the tween as lines on a
graph. It takes some time to become familiar with the meaning of the lines and
how the curves translate to visual changes on the Stage. But once you recognize
how the curves reflect changes in your animation, you have a powerful tool at
your disposal. You can modify the curves on the graph, called property curves,
by adding or deleting anchor points, and change their curvature with Bezier
precision. You can copy property curves and apply them to other properties or
other motion tweens.
The Motion Editor also allows you to apply sophisticated eases to your
animation. Although you can apply eases through the Properties panel, the
Motion Editor provides a wider range of ease types, with options to customize
any ease. The Motion Editor also visually shows you how your ease affects a
property curve. You can even apply different eases to different property curves.
 Note
The Motion Editor is available only for motion tweens (and not
classic tweens, shape tweens, inverse kinematics with the Bone tool,
or frame-by-frame animations).
Understanding the Project File
The 05Start.fla file has five layers. The background layer contains background
elements that will not be animated. The China layer contains the movie clip
instance of the hand and Chinese flag representing China. Each of the top three
layers (US, Euro, and Yen) contains a corresponding movie clip instance of a
block representing those currencies.

The Stage is set at 500 pixels by 600 pixels, and the color of the Stage is gray.
For this lesson, you’ll add motion tweens in the top four layers, and refine the
movements of the blocks with the Motion Editor.
Adding Motion Tweens
You’ll start this project by animating the three boxes representing the US Dollar,
the Euro, and the Japanese Yen. The three boxes will start below the Stage and
rise up.
1. Select all three blocks (the ones with the US flag, the European Union
flag, and the Japanese flag).
2. Right-click the multiple selection and choose Create Motion Tween.

Animate creates motion tweens for all three movie clip instances and
extends the Timeline for those three layers to frame 24, representing one
second of time.
3. Move the red playhead to frame 24.
4. Add additional frames to the other two layers so they extend to frame
24.
5. Select all three blocks and, while holding down the Shift key, move
them up onto the Stage. Drag the blocks high enough onto the Stage so
they’ll have room to fall down and tumble over.

Ending keyframes are added to all three instances.
6. Press Enter/Return to preview your animation.
The three blocks move upward onto the Stage, sticking together.
Editing Property Curves
The motion tween of the three blocks positions them on the Stage for the viewer
to see, but the movement is sluggish and not very interesting. To create a more
dynamic animation that gives some life and snappiness to the blocks, you’ll
modify the curve for their Y-properties in the Motion Editor.

1. Double-click the motion tween in the US layer on the Timeline, or right-
click and choose Refine Tween.
The motion tween expands to reveal the Motion Editor panel. The
Motion Editor contains two straight red lines. One represents the change
in the X-position, and the other represents the change in the Y-position.
Both the X- and Y-properties are grouped under the Location property
group.
2. Click the X-property to select it.
The horizontal red line becomes bold, and the downward diagonal line
fades. The horizontal red line represents the value of the block’s X-
position, which remains unchanged over the span of the motion tween.
Note that the scale on the vertical axis of the graph is limited to a range

from 238 to 240.
3. Now, select the Y-property.
The downward diagonal line becomes bold, and the horizontal line
fades. The diagonal line represents the value of the block’s Y-position,
which decreases over the course of the tween (the block moves upward).
Because of the change in Y-property values, the vertical scale now
expands to encompass a wider range.
Understanding the Motion Editor values
The units on the vertical axis of the Motion Editor measure the values of the
selected property. When you select the Y-property, Animate shows the pixel
units of the Y-position of the motion tween.
The initial value of the curve appears to be greater than 560, and the final value
of the curve appears to be about 200. However, those values don’t seem to match
the initial Y-values when you look at the position of the US movie clip in the
Properties panel. Why the discrepancy?
The Motion Editor measures from the transformation point of your object. Since
the transformation point of your object is in the center, the Motion Editor vertical
values show the Y-property values as the initial position plus half of the movie
clip’s height.

Adding anchor points
You want to create a nonlinear property curve for the first block that moves on
the Stage—that is, you want the block to move a different distance during each
interval of time. An object on a linear property curve moves the same distance
during each interval of time, which is represented by a straight line in the Motion
Editor. A nonlinear path is curved.
To change the shape of the property curve, you add anchor points. From each
anchor point, you can change the curvature or direction of the curve.
1. Select Add Anchor Point On Graph at the bottom of the Motion Editor.
2. Make sure the Y-property curve is still selected, and move your mouse
pointer over the property curve.
Your cursor changes to the Pen tool icon with a plus sign, indicating that
you can add an anchor point to the curve.

3. Use your mouse to drag the curve downward at frame 21 and release the
mouse button when the anchor point is at about the 25-pixel mark (the
graph will scroll to follow your mouse below the 250-pixel mark).
This adds a new anchor point to the curve, and a new keyframe is added
at frame 21.
The anchor point allows you to change the motion of your animation.
The new curve overshoots the final Y-value of the motion tween just
before the final keyframe. The resulting motion makes the movie clip
move rapidly up, then fall back to its final Y-position value. You can see
the motion by pressing the Enter/Return key.
4. Select Add Anchor Point On Graph again.
5. Add a new anchor point at frame 5 and drag it to the right to about
frame 8.
Adding another anchor point to the graph also adds a new keyframe to
the motion tween. The new curve looks like a broad, lazy “S” shape,
with a smooth flattened slope at the beginning, a steep section in the
middle, and the bump at the end.

 Tip
You can also double-click a location on a property curve to
add a new anchor point.
6. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return.
Your red playhead moves through the motion tween. Your new curve
makes your movie clip slowly accelerate into its motion, then rapidly
shoot past its destination, and then fall back to its ending value.
Changing the curvature
Each new anchor point comes with direction handles on either side, which allow
you to change the curvature at that point. The anchor points and direction
handles work just like the ones created by the Pen tool when drawing paths.
1. Click the anchor point on the Y-property curve at the keyframe at frame
21.
The direction handles at the selected anchor point appear.
2. Use the left direction point to drag the left handle downward so the
direction handles are horizontal.
The property curve flattens out at frame 21, which makes the movie clip

remain at that Y-position for just a split second before moving again.
That slight hang-time gives the movie clip a more realistic physics-
based motion, just as a ball that you throw up in the air stays still for a
moment before falling back to the ground.
3. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return.
Your red playhead moves through the motion tween. Your new curve
makes your movie clip have a more realistic motion.
 Note
Some anchor points (for example, the first and last anchor
points of a property curve) do not have direction handles by
default. Hold down the Alt/Option key and drag a selected
anchor point to pull out a direction handle and edit the
curvature.
Moving anchor points
You can move any anchor point, including the ones at the first and last
keyframes, to new property values along the vertical axis. You can also move
any of the anchor points (except the first one) to new times along the motion
tween. In effect, when you move anchor points to new times, you move the
keyframes within the tween span.
1. Select the anchor point at frame 8.
The handle bars at the selected anchor point appear.
 Tip
Hold down the Alt/Option key and click an anchor point to
remove its direction handles, converting it to a corner point
without smooth curves.
2. Drag the anchor point slightly up and to the right.

The property curve flattens out even more, creating a more extended
ease-in effect.
 Tip
Hold down the Alt/Option key as you move a direction
handle of an anchor point to change the angle of that
direction handle independently of the other. You can adjust
the length of each direction handle without holding
Alt/Option. If you adjust the length or angle of one side of a
directon handle independently of the other, you can create
more dramatic changes to the property curve.
3. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return.
The final motion is more interesting than a linear one, with your motion
tween rising up and falling back down like somebody had tossed it up in
the air.
 Tip
Hold down the Shift key to constrain the dragging motion
to a vertical or horizontal direction.
 Tip
You can use the arrow keys to nudge a selected anchor
point for precise control. Press the Up or Down Arrow key
to move the anchor point one property unit up or down, or
Shift-Up or Shift-Down to move the anchor point ten
property units up or down.

Deleting anchor points
If you’ve added too many anchor points, you can always remove them (except
for the first and last anchor points). Removing an anchor point has the same
effect as removing a keyframe of the motion tween.
Hold down the Command/Ctrl key.
Your cursor turns into the Pen icon with a minus sign when you hover over any
anchor point. Click any anchor point (except the first or last).
Animate removes the anchor point from the property curve. Do not remove any
anchor points from your project at this point in the lesson. If you do, press
Ctrl+Z (Windows)/Command+Z (Mac) to undo the operation.
Deleting property curves
Click Remove Tween For Selected Property (the trash can icon) at the bottom of
the Motion Editor to delete a tween for a selected property curve.
At the moment, your animation has a tween for only one property—the Y-
property—so deleting the curve would remove the property changes in your
tween. Use the Remove Tween option if you want to delete the animation of a
particular property when you have multiple properties changing.
Viewing Options for the Motion Editor
Animate provides different viewing options for the Motion Editor so you can
refine your property curves with greater accuracy.

1. Use the menu at the bottom of the Motion Editor to change the zoom
level.
The vertical axis expands to show a more granular level of property
values. Scroll up or down to see the top or bottom of the curve.
2. Click 100% Zoom to reset the Motion Editor to its default view.
3. Click Fit To View to expand the Motion Editor to fill the existing space
on the Timeline. Click the icon again (its name is now Restore View) to
return to the default view.
 Note
You can enter a custom magnification level for the Motion
Editor, but the minimum value is 100% and the maximum
value is 400%.
 Tip
You can also hold down the Ctrl/Command key and scroll
inside the Motion Editor to change the magnification.
Copying and Pasting Curves
You’ve spent a lot of effort creating a custom property curve for the motion of
the first movie clip. Fortunately, you don’t have to work through those same
steps for the other movie clips. Animate provides quick and easy ways to
duplicate individual property curves or entire motion tweens.
In the following section, you’ll duplicate the motion of the US block to the
European Union and Japanese blocks.

1. In the Motion Editor of the motion tween for the US movie clip, select
the Y-property curve.
2. Right-click the Y-property curve and choose Copy.
Animate copies the curve for the Y-property.
3. Double-click the motion tween in the Euro layer.
The Motion Editor in the US layer collapses and the Motion Editor in
the Euro layer expands. Both the X-property and Y-property curves of
the motion tween in the Euro layer are straight, linear motions.
4. Select the Y-property.
5. Right-click the Y-property curve and choose Paste To Fit Current
Range.

The property curve data copied from the US clip is applied to the Euro
clip, but it is adjusted to fit the range of Y-position values for the Euro
clip’s motion.
The final pasted curve has the correct shape and anchor point curvatures,
but it is squeezed to fit the starting and ending points of the Euro motion
tween. That means its ending point is lower on the Stage than you want.
6. Hold down the Shift key and drag the final anchor point down so its
property value is identical to the previous anchor point. (The final
anchor point should be at a point where the Euro block sits immediately
under the US block with no space between them.)
7. Hold down the Shift key and click and drag the anchor point at frame 21
to about Y=150 in the Motion Editor to re-create the gentle slope in the
original curve.
8. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return.

Both the US and the European Union blocks slowly ease in to their
motion, fly up high, and then settle back down in the middle of the
Stage.
 Tip
In the Motion Editor, you can use Ctrl+C
(Windows)/Command+C (Mac) to copy a selected property
curve and Ctrl+C/Command+V to paste a curve.
Paste vs. Paste To Fit Current Range
When you paste a copied property curve, you have the choice
between two commands: Paste and Paste To Fit Current Range. In
the previous task, you used Paste To Fit Current Range, which
mapped the beginning and end points of the copied curve onto the
beginning and end points of its destination.
The simple Paste command will paste the exact property curve—
both the shape of the curve and its original values. If you were to
choose Paste for your Euro movie clip property curve, it would
follow the exact motion on the y axis as the copied curve (the US
motion tween). The end result would be the Euro movie clip hiding
under the US movie clip.
Duplicating entire motion tweens
Copying and pasting individual curves in the Motion Editor allows you to
duplicate the animation of individual properties. For example, you could
duplicate the Y-motion of a tween, but not its rotation.
In this project, since you want to duplicate the entire motion tween of the US
block (which consists of change only along the Y-property), you can use the
commands Edit > Timeline > Copy Motion and Edit > Timeline > Paste Motion.
You’ll use Copy Motion and Paste Motion to copy the motion tween of the
European Union movie clip and paste it into the Yen movie clip.
1. Double-click the motion tween in the Euro layer to collapse the Motion
Editor.
2. Shift-click the motion tween in the Euro layer.
The entire motion tween span is selected.

3. Right-click and choose Copy Motion, or choose Edit > Timeline > Copy
Motion.
The entire Euro layer motion tween is copied.
4. Select the motion tween in the Yen layer.
5. Right-click and choose Paste Motion, or choose Edit > Timeline > Paste
Motion.
The property curves of the Yen motion tween now are identical to that of
the Euro motion tween, with different beginning and ending values.
If you want to refine the motion of the Yen block further, open its
Motion Editor. Select the Y-position property and lower the height to
which it rises (by dragging the anchor point in frame 21 up slightly)
before falling back down. Doing so will create a slight separation
between all the blocks. Make minor adjustments to the positions of the
property curve keyframes until you’re satisfied with the overall motion.
Wrap things up by closing the Motion Editor.

Adding Complex Eases
Now that your three blocks representing the US, European Union, and Japanese
currencies are animated, it’s time to animate the hand that pushes them. The
hand will move horizontally onto the Stage and give the stack of blocks a shove,
sending them toppling.
The motion of the hand easing into the Stage and the toppling motion can be
quite complex. As the blocks topple, they bounce up and down, decreasing in

height after each bounce. The Motion Editor, fortunately, makes much of the
motion quick and easy to edit.
Adding the next motion tween
The next motion tween will be applied to the hand of China. The movie clip is
positioned just off the left of the Stage in the layer called China.
1. Select frame 90 for all the layers, and press F5 (Insert > Timeline >
Frame).
Animate adds frames to all the layers up to frame 90. This establishes
the span of time for the hand to enter and knock over the blocks.
2. Select frame 40 in the China layer and insert a new keyframe (F6) to
define the moment when the hand starts to move.
A keyframe is added to the China layer at frame 40 and the movie clip
instance from the previous keyframe is copied into it.
3. Right-click the China movie clip instance just off the Stage and choose
Create Motion Tween.

4. Move the red playhead to frame 55, the point where we want the hand to
make contact with the blocks.
5. Move the hand straight across the Stage so that its palm butts up against
the stack of blocks. (Use the right-arrow key to keep the movie clip’s
motion restricted to a horizontal direction.) The X-position should be at
about 2. Make sure that the Y-position remains at Y=210 in the ending
keyframe as in the beginning keyframe.
The China movie clip instance is now animated so it moves straight

across the Stage from the left to right and stops at frame 55. The movie
clip stays at its ending position from frame 55 to frame 90.
6. Select frame 56 of the China layer.
7. Right-click and choose Split Motion.
The motion tween in the China layer is split into two motion tweens—
one that begins at frame 40, and another that begins at frame 56.
8. At frame 56, right-click and choose Remove Motion.
The motion tween at frame 56 is deleted, leaving the movie clip instance
as a static graphic from frame 56 to the last frame of the animation. The
motion tween from frame 40 to frame 56 is now ready for an ease.
Adding an ease-in
The Motion Editor provides a host of different ease types that can give a simple

motion, like the China movie clip’s shove, a more interesting effect.
1. Double-click the motion tween in the China layer, or right-click and
choose Refine Tween.
The Motion Editor opens to reveal property curves for both the X- and
Y-properties. The X-property curve is angled upward whereas the Y-
property curve is relatively flat.
2. Select the X-property curve.
3. Click the Add Ease button at the bottom of the Motion Editor.
The Ease panel opens, listing the different ease presets grouped by
category, from No Ease at the top to Custom Ease at the bottom. The
different ease presets change the way the motion tween proceeds from
the first keyframe to the last.
4. Double-click the Simple category.

The category opens, revealing Slow, Medium, Fast, and Fastest presets.
The eases in the Simple category affect one side of the motion tween
(either the beginning or the end). The eases in the Stop and Start
categories affect both sides of the motion tween. The eases in the other
categories are more complex ease types.
 Tip
You can use the Up, Down, Left, and Right Arrow keys to
navigate the ease types in the Ease panel of the Motion
Editor.
5. Select the Fast ease preset.
The Fast ease curve is displayed, showing graphically the intensity of
the ease. Slower eases are fairly shallow and closer to a straight line,
whereas faster eases have progressively greater curvature.
 Note
After you’ve chosen an ease preset, the label on the Add
Ease button changes to the name of the preset.
6. Double-click the Easing value and change it to −60; then press Tab or
Enter/Return to exit the entry field and confirm the value. You can also
drag on the Easing value to change it (drag left or down to decrease the
value; drag right or up to increase it).

The Easing value determines the strength of the ease for each ease preset
and the direction of the ease. A positive number represents an ease-out,
and a negative number represents an ease-in.
7. Click off the Ease panel to dismiss it, or press the Esc key.
A dotted line appears in the Motion Editor superimposed on the original
property curve. This is called the “resultant curve” and shows the effect
of the ease on the tween.
8. Close the Motion Editor and test your new motion by pressing
Enter/Return.
The motion tween of the China block proceeds slowly, gaining
momentum until it finally collides with the stack of smaller blocks in the
middle of the Stage.

If the clip is selected, its motion tween path on the Stage shows the
position of the instance at each frame. The clustering of the dots on the
left side of the tween path means that the object doesn’t move very far in
the beginning of its motion, but gradually speeds up.
Removing an ease
Eases can be deleted as quickly as you’ve added them.
1. Double-click the motion tween in the China layer, or right-click and
choose Refine Tween.
2. Click the Ease button at the bottom of the Motion Editor, which now
bears the label Simple(Fast).
Animate opens the Ease panel, displaying the currently selected ease.
3. Select No Ease to remove the ease preset, and press Esc to close the
Ease panel.

4. Press Ctrl+Z (Windows)/Command+Z (Mac) to undo the removal of the
ease. You’ll keep the ease in place for this project.
5. Double-click the China motion tween to close the Motion Editor.
Property curves vs. ease curves
When you apply an ease to a motion tween with the Motion
Editor, the original property curve is not altered
permanently. In the first section of this lesson, you altered
the property curves of a motion tween directly by adding
anchor points and changing its curvature. Applying eases is
akin to applying a filter that influences the outcome of an
original property. Like a filter, the ease can be edited or
removed altogether.
It is possible to both modify a property curve and add an
ease, but the combined result can be unpredictable.
Animating bounces
As soon as the hand graphic hits the stack of blocks, you’ll want to animate the
blocks tumbling down. You’ll create a motion tween with multiple complex
eases to create the bouncing effect.
1. Drag-select frame 56 in the US, Euro, and Yen layers.
2. Right-click and choose Split Motion.

New motion tweens begin at frame 56 in all three layers.
3. Move the playhead to frame 90.
4. Move the US movie clip instance to the bottom of the Stage at X=500
and Y=530.
5. Using the Free Transform tool, rotate it 180 degrees clockwise so it
appears upside down.

6. Move the Euro movie clip instance to the bottom just off the Stage in
the same manner and and use the Free Transform tool to rotate it 90
degrees clockwise. You may have to hide the US layer above it so you
can grab the Euro graphic.
7. Move the Yen movie clip instance to the bottom just off the Stage and

use the Free Transform tool to rotate it 180 degrees clockwise. Hide the
Euro layer so the Yen graphic is easier to work with.
8. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return.

The three blocks fall gracefully in a diagonal direction, rotating as they
fall. You’ll want a more violent, realistic tumble, so the next step is to
add some eases.
Using the BounceIn ease
One of the presets in the Ease panel is BounceIn, which simulates a bouncing
motion. The distance to the final property value gradually decreases as the
motion tween approaches its ending keyframe.
1. Double-click the last motion tween in the US layer to open the Motion
Editor.
Animate expands the motion tween in the US layer, revealing the
Motion Editor panel. The Motion Editor contains property curves for

both the X- and Y-properties for Location as well as Z-properties for
Transform > Rotation.
2. Select the Y-property under Location.
3. Click Add Ease at the bottom of the Motion Editor to open the Ease
panel.
4. Double-click the Bounce And Spring category to reveal the presets
within.
5. Select the BounceIn ease preset and enter 5 for the Easing value.
The BounceIn ease simulates a bounce that slowly decays as the motion
tween approaches its end. The Easing value for the BounceIn ease
determines the number of bounces.
6. Press Tab to confirm the Easing value and press Esc to close the Ease
panel.
7. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return. Select Loop at the
bottom of the Timeline and set the markers at frames 56 and 90 so you
can repeat the motion automatically.

The US instance bounces (only in the Y-direction) as it falls to the
ground. Note the path of the bounce on the Stage defined by the dots.
8. Collapse the Motion Editor for the US layer, and expand the Motion
Editor for the Euro layer.
9. Apply a BounceIn ease to the Euro instance, and change the Easing
value to 4.

10. Collapse the Motion Editor for the Euro layer, and expand the Motion
Editor for the Yen layer.
11. Apply a BounceIn ease to the Yen instance, and change the Easing value
to 3.
12. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return.
When the three blocks fall, each tumbles with a different number of
bounces. The top block bounces the most with five bounces, the middle
bounces four times, and the bottom block bounces three times.

 Note
If you’re encountering strange, unpredictable behaviors,
check to make sure that you’ve applied the BounceIn ease
only to the Y-property curve. You want the bouncing
motion to affect only the vertical motion, and not the
horizontal motion or the rotation.
Applying a second ease to a different property curve
The Motion Editor is powerful because it enables you to treat each property
curve of one motion tween independently. For example, you can apply one ease
for the Y-property and a different ease for the X-property. This is exactly what
you’ll do next. You’ll add an ease-out for the horizontal motion of each instance,
while maintaining the BounceIn ease for the vertical motion.
1. Expand the Motion Editor for the US layer.
2. Select the X-property under Location.

3. Click Add Ease at the bottom of the Motion Editor to open the Ease
panel.
4. Double-click the Simple category.
5. Select the Fast ease preset and enter 50 for the Easing value.
The Easing value of 50 represents a strong ease-out motion.
6. Apply Fast eases with an Easing value of 50 for the X-property curves
of the other two motion tweens (the Euro and the Yen instances).
7. Test your new motion by pressing Enter/Return. Use the Loop option at
the bottom of the Timeline so you can repeat the motion automatically.
As the three blocks bounce to the ground, their forward momentum
gradually slows down, creating a more realistic animation.

Review Questions
1 How do you access the Motion Editor for a motion tween?
2 What’s the difference between a property curve and an ease curve?
3 What does the Easing value do to an ease?
4 How do you change the curvature of a property curve?
Review Answers
1 To open the Motion Editor panel, double-click a motion tween span on the
Timeline, or right-click a motion tween span and choose Refine Tween.
2 A property curve is the graphical representation of how a property of a motion
tween changes values over time. An ease curve represents a different rate of
change that you can apply to an individual property curve. Animate displays
the effects of an ease curve on a property curve as a dotted line.
3 The Easing value changes the strength and direction of an ease. Easing values

affect eases differently, depending on the type of ease selected. For example,
the Easing value for BounceIn eases determines the number of bounces,
whereas the Easing value for a Simple Fast ease determines whether the ease
is an ease-in or ease-out, and the strength of the ease.
4 To change the curvature of a property curve, select the property in the Motion
Editor and select Add Anchor. Click the curve to add a new anchor point and
move the direction handles to change the shape of the curve at that point. You
can move the anchor points up or down to change the property value, or you
can move the anchor points left or right to change the position of the keyframe
within the motion tween.

6. Classic Tweening
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Understand the differences between motion tweening and classic
tweening
Animate the position, scale, and rotation of objects
Adjust the pacing and timing of your animation
Animate transparency and special effects
Create a motion guide for the path of an object’s animation
Apply custom eases to your animation
Synchronize dialogue with graphic symbols
This lesson will take about one and a half hours to complete. Please log in
to your account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this
chapter, or go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book
and follow the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web
Edition.”

Sometimes an animation benefits from a simpler approach. Classic tweening,
an older method favored among character animators, provides an easy way to
animate symbol instances when you don’t need the subtle controls of motion
tweens.
Getting Started
Start by viewing the two finished projects to see the short animation that you’ll
create in this lesson.
1. Double-click the 06End.html file in the Lesson06/06End folder to play
the animation in a browser.

The project is a simple looping animation of a cartoon bird flying past
mountain ranges. Notice the up and down motion of the body as the
wings flap, as well as the smooth motion of the background.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this
lesson to your computer from your Account page, make
sure to do so now. See “Getting Started” at the beginning of
the book.
2. Close the 06End.html file.
3. Double-click the 06End2.html file in the Lesson06/06End folder to play
the animation in a browser.

The project is an animation diagramming the movement of a satellite
going around the earth before being thrown out into space.
4. Close the 06End2.html file.
You’ll complete both animations. As you do so, you’ll learn how to
animate with classic tweens, apply eases, and use motion guides.
Using Classic Tweens
In Lesson 4, you learned to animate an object with motion tweening, and in
Lesson 5, you applied sophisticated eases to tweens for complex motions. In this
lesson, you’ll learn to animate objects with classic tweens, an older, but still
popular, way of creating animations. Classic tweens are similar to and a bit
simpler than motion tweens. Both approaches use symbol instances, and both
animate changes in symbol instance properties between two keyframes. For
example, classic tweens can animate a symbol instance’s position, rotation,
transformation, color effect, or filter, just as motion tweens can. So why use one
over the other?
Classic tweens have retained their popularity with many animators, especially
character animators, primarily because of the simplicity of the process. Classic
tweens animate only instance properties between keyframes, and there are no
property keyframes or Motion Editor to worry about. There is no motion path
that is displayed on the Stage (editing the path requires a separate layer in classic
tweens).
The key differences between classic tweens and motion tweens are as follows:
Classic tweens require a separate motion guide layer to animate along a
path.
Classic tweens are not supported in the Motion Editor.
Classic tweens don’t support 3D rotations or translations.
Classic tweens are not separated onto their own tween layer. However,
classic and motion tweens share the same restriction that no other object
can exist in the same layer as the tween.
Classic tweens are Timeline-based, and not object-based, meaning you
add, remove, or swap the tween or the instance on the Timeline and not
on the Stage.
Learning to create animation with classic tweens will help you understand the
full scope of the animator’s toolkit and better prepare you to choose the right
approach for any project.

Understanding the first project file
Your 06Start.fla project already contains the assets for the bird animation. The
animation is partially complete, and an instance of the movie clip of the bird
animation is on the Stage. In this section, you’ll complete the animation by
adding the scrolling background with classic tweens.
1. Double-click the 06Start.fla file in the Lesson06/06Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate.
2. From the view options above the Stage, choose Fit In Window, or
choose View > Magnification > Fit In Window, so that you can see the
entire Stage on your computer screen.
3. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 06_workingcopy.fla, and save it
in the 06Start folder.
Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be
available if you want to start over.

Creating the movie clip symbol
You’ll add an animation of scrolling mountains inside a movie clip symbol on
the main Timeline.
1. On the main Timeline, insert a new layer, and name it landscape. Drag
the new layer below the bird layer but above the sky layer.
2. Choose Insert > New Symbol (Ctrl+F8/Command+F8).
The Create New Symbol dialog box appears.
3. Enter scrolling landscape for the name, and choose Movie Clip from
the Type menu.
4. Click OK.
The new movie clip symbol, named scrolling landscape, opens in
symbol-editing mode. The Stage is blank, indicating that the movie clip
symbol is currently empty.
5. Drag the graphic symbol called mountains from the Library panel to the
Stage, and position it so its lower-left corner aligns with the registration
point of the movie clip symbol.

In the Properties panel, in the Position And Size section, the position
coordinates should read X=0, Y=−155.55.
6. Add frames (Insert > Timeline > Frame, or F5) up to frame 30.
Inserting a keyframe and changing the position of the instance
You’ll add another keyframe for the mountains, so you’ll have an initial
keyframe for the mountains at their starting position, and an ending keyframe
when the mountains are moved to the left.
1. Select frame 30 in Layer 1 of your movie clip symbol, and insert a new
keyframe (Insert > Timeline > Keyframe, or F6).
A new keyframe containing a copy of the mountains instance is inserted

at frame 30.
2. At frame 30, move the instance of the mountain graphic symbol to the
left so that the midpoint of the mountains image is centered over the
registration point. The Properties panel should show X=−800.
The left and right edges of the graphic match up, so when the animation
plays as a loop, the effect is a seamless scrolling mountain range.
Applying a classic tween
Apply a classic tween to the Timeline between two keyframes.
1. Right-click any frame between the first and second keyframe and
choose Create Classic Tween.

Animate creates a tween between the first and second keyframe,
indicated by an arrow extending along a blue background.
2. Press Enter/Return on your keyboard, or press the Play button under the
Timeline, to preview the animation.
A smooth animation plays, showing the mountains moving from right to
left.
3. To add a little more complexity to the animation, you’ll add a second
layer of mountains. Insert a new layer, and drag it under the existing
layer.
4. Drag another instance of the mountains symbol to the Stage. In the
Properties panel, in the Position And Size section, make sure that the
Lock Width And Height icon is broken, and change the width (W) to
2000 pixels and the height (H) to 200 pixels. Position the lower-left
corner of the instance at the registration point of the symbol so that the
Properties panel shows X=0, Y=−200.
You’ll have two mountain ranges, with the taller and wider one behind
the first one.

5. Insert a new keyframe (Insert > Timeline > Keyframe, or F6) at frame
30 of the bottom layer.
6. In the end keyframe at frame 30, move the mountains instance to x=
−1000.
7. Right-click any frame between the first and second keyframe, and
choose Create Classic Tween.
8. Press Return/Enter on your keyboard, or press the Play button under the
Timeline, to preview the animation. Select the Loop option to play the
tween as a loop, and from the Modify Marker menu, choose Marker
Range All.

The second mountain instance moves from right to left, but it’s slightly
offset from the one in the foreground, creating a rich layered effect.
Zoom in to the Stage so the edges of the graphics aren’t visible; this will
give you a better idea of the seamless scrolling effect.
9. Deselect the Loop option. Exit symbol-editing mode to return to the
main Timeline.
Adding the movie clip instance
Now that you’ve completed the classic tweens of the scrolling mountains, you’ll
add the movie clip symbol to the main Stage.
1. Drag the movie clip symbol named scrolling landscape from the Library

panel to the Stage, and position the instance so its left and bottom edges
align with the left and bottom edges of the Stage. In the Properties
panel, in the Position And Size section, the values should read X=0,
Y=400.
 Note
Animation by Chris Georgenes (keyframer.com). Used with
permission.
2. Save your finished work and choose Control > Test to preview the
animation.
Animate opens your default browser and shows the animation of the

scrolling mountains that you created behind the bird flapping its wings.
 Note
The Output panel shows several warnings after you test
your animation. Don’t worry about them. They are not
errors, but only general precautions when working in
HTML5 Canvas documents.
Animating scale
Finally, you’ll add a sun, which you’ll animate in a subtle way to give it a
pulsating, lively appearance.
1. Choose Insert > New Symbol (Ctrl/Command+F8).
2. In the Create New Symbol dialog box that appears, enter animated sun
for the Name, choose Movie Clip for the Type, and click OK.
Animate creates a new movie clip symbol called animated sun and you
enter symbol-editing mode on the Stage.
3. Select the Oval tool with no stroke and a yellow color for the fill.
4. Hold the Shift key down and drag out a circle on the middle of the
Stage. Holding the Shift key constrains the oval to create a perfect
circle. The circle fig06-020.jpgshould be about 100 pixels wide by 100
pixels high.
5. Select the Selection tool and select your yellow circle. In the Properties
panel, enter –50 for X and –50 for Y to center the sun on the Stage.
6. With the sun still selected, choose Modify > fig06-021.jpgConvert To
Symbol (F8).

7. In the Convert To Symbol dialog box that appears, enter sun for the
Name and choose Movie Clip for the Type. Click OK.
Animate creates a movie clip symbol called sun, which you will animate
inside the movie clip symbol that you’re currently editing, called
animated sun.
8. On the movie clip symbol Timeline, select frame 72.
9. Choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
A new keyframe is created at frame 72 with an instance of the sun.
10. Select frame 48 and choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
Another keyframe is created at frame 48 with an instance of the sun.
You now have three keyframes along the Timeline, each with identical
instances of the sun. You’ll change the size of the sun in the middle
keyframe and tween between the keyframes to make the sun slowly
expand and contract.
11. Select the sun on the Stage in frame 48.
12. Choose the Free Transform tool.

Control handles appear around the instance of the sun.
13. Hold the Shift key and drag out the corner of the transformation
bounding box slightly to make the sun about 10% bigger.
14. Select any frame between the first and second keyframe. Right-click,
and choose Create Classic Tween.
A classic tween is created between the first and second keyframe.
15. Select any frame between the second and third keyframe. Right-click,
and choose Create Classic Tween.
A classic tween is created between the second and third keyframe.
16. Press Enter/Return to play the animation on the movie clip timeline.
The sun slowly expands and contracts as if breathing. Because the first
and last keyframes are identical, the movie clip timeline will loop
seamlessly in the final animation.
17. Exit symbol-editing mode. Drag the movie clip called animated sun
from your library onto the Stage in the sky layer just above the
mountains.

18. Choose Control > Test.
Animate launches your default browser and plays the animation. As the
bird flies by the mountains, the mountains whiz by and the sun pulsates.
Adding a filter
Finally, you’ll make the sun look more like a sun by adding a Blur filter, which
will soften its edges.
1. Double-click the instance of the animated sun on the Stage to edit the
symbol in place.
All the other graphics on the Stage become dim, allowing you to edit the
animated sun symbol in context with its surrounding graphics.

2. Move the playhead to frame 1 and select the instance of the sun on the
Stage.
3. In the Properties panel, in the Filters section, click the Add Filter (+)
button and choose Blur.
A Blur filter is applied to the sun.
4. Drag the X and Y Blur values to 10 pixels, and keep the Quality setting
at Low.
The sun’s outer edges become fuzzy.

5. Click Scene 1 in the Edit bar to exit symbol-editing mode.
6. Choose Control > Test.
The sun now slowly expands and contracts with a slight blurred effect.
 Note
In HTML5 Canvas documents, filters and color effects are
particularly difficult to render, so they are not animated.
Instead, only the first keyframe of the applied filter or color
effect is displayed. Hence, in this task, although you can
animate your sun growing and shrinking, it can have only
one state of blurriness. This is a limitation of HTML5
Canvas and not of classic tweening.

Motion Guides for Classic Tweens
Now that you’ve had a taste of how classic tweens can animate various
properties of an object, such as its position or size, you’ll learn to move an object
on a path. Save and close the 06_workingcopy.fla file, as you won’t need it
anymore.
To move an object along a specific path, classic tweens require that you draw the
path in a separate layer called a motion guide.
Understanding the second project file
Open 06Start2.fla to begin your second project, which features an orbiting
satellite. You will animate the earth revolving around the sun and the satellite’s
trajectory.
1. Double-click the 06Start2.fla file in the Lesson06/06Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate.
2. From the view options above the Stage, choose Fit In Window, or
choose View > Magnification > Fit In Window, so that you can see the
entire Stage on your computer screen.
The starting file contains five layers (some of them empty), and on the
Stage is the sun. Off the Stage (not yet visible to the audience) is the
trajectory of the satellite that is provided for you for later use.

3. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 06_workingcopy2.fla, and save it
in the 06Start folder.
Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be
available if you want to start over.
Animating an object along a path
A motion guide is a layer that you add to the Timeline. It tells an object in a
classic tween how to move from its position in the first keyframe to its position
in the last keyframe. Without a motion guide, a classic tween will animate an
object’s position in a straight line from the first to the last keyframe. The motion
guide contains a path that you draw and that can curve, zigzag, or make all sorts
of detours to go from the first keyframe to the last, as long as the path doesn’t
cross itself.
When using a motion guide, you must make sure that the object in the beginning
keyframe is attached to the path and that the object in the ending keyframe is
also attached to the path.
1. On the main Timeline, select the earth layer and drag the earth symbol
from the Library onto the Stage. You can position the earth to the right
of the sun at about X=420 and Y=80.
2. Select frame 48 in all the layers, and add frames (F5).

3. Select frame 48 in the earth layer and insert a new keyframe (F6).
You now have two keyframes, one at frame 1 and another at frame 48.
4. Select any frame between your two keyframes, right-click, and choose
Create Classic Tween. In the Properties panel, make sure that the Snap
option in the Tweening section is selected.
Animate creates a tween between the two keyframes, but since the
position of the earth in the first and last keyframes is identical, there is
no animation yet.
5. Right-click the name of the earth layer and choose Add Classic Motion
Guide.
Animate adds a new layer above the earth layer. The new layer is a

classic motion guide, which will contain the path that the tween will
follow. The earth layer is indented, indicating that it belongs to the
motion guide layer.
6. Select the motion guide layer called “Guide: earth.”
7. Select the Oval tool, and select None for the Fill color and any color for
its Stroke.
8. Draw an oval around the sun that represents the orbit of the earth. Don’t
make the oval more than 200 pixels wide or 100 pixels high. Make sure
the sun is approximately in the middle.
As you draw your oval, Animate makes sure that the tweened object (the
earth) stays on the path, since the Snap option in the Properties panel is
selected. The final orbit should show the earth on the edge of the oval on
the right side of the sun.
9. Select the last keyframe in the earth layer.
10. Select the Selection tool, and make sure that the Snap To Objects option
(the magnet icon) at the bottom of the Tools panel is selected.
11. Move the instance of the earth in the last keyframe so that it snaps to the
path of the oval. Position it slightly lower than it is in the first keyframe

(in the clockwise direction).
Your earth is now attached to the oval in the first and last keyframe. The
Snap To Objects option is critical because your object must always be on
its path.
12. Preview your animation by pressing Enter/Return.
Your earth probably moves very slowly along the oval, moving
clockwise from one spot along the rim to its destination close by.
However, you want it to move counterclockwise, entirely around the
sun, but Animate is choosing to animate your earth by the quickest
route. How do you force it to move in the other direction?
There are two approaches. One, you could insert another keyframe in the
middle to break up the revolution into two parts. The second way is to
create a tiny break in the oval so that it is not a closed path, but becomes
a path with a beginning and an end. For this task, you’ll proceed with
the second way.
13. Use the Zoom tool to magnify the area where the earth is attached to its
path in the first keyframe.
14. Lock the earth layer so you don’t disturb it.
15. With the Selection tool, drag around a small segment of the path to
select it, and then delete it (press the Backspace/Delete key).
Your oval has a small gap.

16. Unlock the earth layer.
17. In the first keyframe of your earth layer, move the earth instance so that
it snaps to the beginning of the path (above the gap), and in the last
keyframe, move the earth so that it snaps to the end of the path (below
the gap).
18. Preview your animation by pressing Enter/Return.
The earth now revolves around the sun counterclockwise, following the
path in the motion guide layer.

 Note
When you publish your final animation, the path drawn in
the motion guide is not displayed.
 Note
You can have more than one tween follow the same motion
guide. Simply drag your tween layer under a motion guide
layer so that the tween layer is indented.
Animating the satellite trajectory
Next, you’ll add the satellite’s trajectory as it circles the earth once and then flies
out into space.
1. On the main Timeline, select the layer named satellite and drag the
satellite symbol named juno from the Library onto the Stage. Position
the instance just to the right of the earth. Use the Free Transform tool to
reduce it to a more comfortable size.

2. Select the last frame in the satellite layer and insert a new keyframe
(F6).
You now have two keyframes, one at frame 1 and another at frame 48.
3. Select any frame between your two keyframes, right-click, and choose
Create Classic Tween.
Animate creates a tween between the two keyframes.
4. Right-click the satellite layer and choose Add Classic Motion Guide.
Animate adds a motion guide layer above the satellite layer.

5. Select the Selection tool and double-click the satellite path that is placed
off the Stage to select it.
6. Cut (Ctrl+X/Command+X) the path. Select the satellite motion guide,
and paste (Ctrl+V/Command+V) the path onto it.
7. Position the path so that the beginning point (the inner end) is near the
earth’s starting point and it entirely encircles the earth’s orbit.

8. Deselect the path by clicking an empty part of the Stage.
9. In the first keyframe, zoom in close and move the satellite so that it
snaps to the starting point of the path.
10. In the last keyframe, move the satellite so that it snaps to the ending
point of the path (far out in space).

11. Preview your animation by pressing Enter/Return.
As the earth makes its revolution around the sun, the satellite follows its
own trajectory around and out the solar system.

 Note
You can edit the path in the motion guide with any of the
editing tools, such as the Selection tool, Subselection tool,
or Pen tool. Any change you make to the path will
immediately change the object’s motion as long as the
object remains snapped to the path in both the beginning
and ending keyframes.
Copying and Pasting Tweens
So far, you’ve animated the earth and the satellite, but in reality, the satellite
takes several years to make its journey to outer space. So in the next task, you’ll
expand the time that the animation takes and add additional revolutions for the
earth.
Adding additional earth revolutions
You have the earth going around the oval path once. Now, you’ll copy the tween
and paste it on the Timeline to create three additional revolutions.
1. With the Selection tool, select the first keyframe, the classic tween, and
the last keyframe in the earth layer.
2. Right-click and choose Copy Frames (Edit > Timelines > Copy
Frames).
3. Select frame 49 in the earth layer, right-click, and choose Paste Frames
(Edit > Timelines > Paste Frames).
Animate pastes the copied tween into frames 49 to 96. A second tween
of the earth moving around the sun appears.

4. Select the next frame after the newly pasted tween, right-click, and
choose Paste Frames again to paste a third tween.
5. Paste another tween at the end of the Timeline.
You’ll end up with a total of four tweens in the earth layer, extending all
the way to frame 192.
6. Now you’ll need to extend the rest of the layers so they last as long as
your earth layer. Select frame 192 in the Guide: earth layer and press F5.
Animate adds frames in the Guide: earth layer up to frame 192.
7. Select frame 192 in all other layers and press F5.
Animate adds frames to the rest of the layers.

8. Select the last keyframe of the satellite layer at frame 48.
9. Make sure that the box icon shows up near your mouse pointer, and then
drag the keyframe to the very end of the layer’s Timeline (frame 192).
The satellite’s whole trajectory lasts from frame 1 to frame 192, and in
the meantime, the earth orbits the sun four times.
Classic Tween Eases
You learned about eases in Lessons 4 and 5. Recall that eases are a way to affect
the way a tween proceeds as it goes from its first keyframe to its next keyframe.
A motion can start slow and speed up, or it can start quickly and then slow to a
stop. Or an object can move through bouncing or other, more complex motions
before settling into its last keyframe.
You can also apply eases to classic tweens, though the process is a bit different.
For classic tweens, there is no Motion Editor on the Timeline. You add eases
through the Properties panel.
Adding an ease
The satellite that you animated flies from the earth into outer space in a linear
fashion—that is, it moves the same distance for every frame on the Timeline. To
make the animation a little more realistic, you’ll slow down the satellite’s motion
as it flies away from the earth, and then speed it up as it swings close to the
earth. The gravitational boost that the satellite gains by flying close to the earth
is known as a slingshot effect, which helps propel it on its journey to the outer

reaches of the solar system.
1. Select any frame between the first and last keyframes of the satellite
layer.
2. The Tweening section of the Properties panel displays all the tween
options, including eases. The 0 value for the Classic Ease option
indicates that there is currently no ease applied. You can drag the value
to increase or decrease the ease from –100 (ease-in) to 100 (ease-out).
Choosing a value this way applies a very simple ease in which an object
begins slowly (ease-in) or ends slowly (ease-out). However, you’ll want
a more complex ease. Click Classic Ease to open the Ease panel.
The Ease panel appears; it looks similar to the Ease panel in the Motion
Editor for motion tweens. You can choose different types of eases, and
for some, you can choose the intensity of the ease in a secondary menu.
A graph shows the nonlinear relationship between time (along the
horizontal axis) and the tween (along the vertical axis).
3. Select the Custom option, and double-click New in the adjacent pane to
open the Custom Ease panel. Alternatively, you can click the Edit
Easing button (the pencil icon) in the Properties panel.
The Custom Ease panel displays the graph with time along the
horizontal axis and the percent of the tween along the vertical axis. It
helps to think about what shape the line in the ease graph should be in

order to accomplish the motion that you want. For the satellite, you want
the motion to slow down as it moves away from the earth (around frame
48) and then speed up as it approaches earth (around frame 96). That
means that at around frame 48 the ease graph should flatten out, and at
frame 96 the graph should become a bit steeper.
4. Click the ease graph at about frame 48.
Animate adds a control point (a black square) with two handles (two
empty circles) on the graph.

5. Grab the control handles and drag down slightly to flatten the curve.
The handles work like Bezier curves, controlling the curvature of the
line.
6. Now click the ease graph at about frame 96.
Animate adds another control point and handles on the graph.

7. Grab the control handles and drag upward slightly to make the curve a
little steeper.
Don’t overdo the curvatures. Small changes in the graph can
dramatically affect the motion, and subtle eases often work the best.
 Note

To delete a single control point on the ease graph, select it
and press Backspace/Delete.
 Note
To clear all your control points, click the Reset button
below the ease graph.
8. Click the Play button (the triangle icon) below the ease graph to preview
the animation.
On the Stage, the satellite slows down, and then speeds up when it
swings by the earth at about frame 96. Save and close your file. You’re
done with this animation.
Property easing
For a finer degree of control, you can apply different eases
for each property of your tween separately. For example, if
the satellite were to grow bigger as it flew out of the solar
system, or if it were rotating as it made its journey, you
could choose a different ease for its change in scale or its
change in rotation.
In the Tweening section of the Properties panel, from the
Easing menu choose Each Property Separately. Apply a
preset ease or a custom ease for position, rotation, scale,
color, or filters.

Graphic Symbols
You’ve been using movie clip symbols for your animation, and you’ve seen that
they allow for independent nested animations. But you can also have nested
animations and graphics inside graphic symbols, although they work a little
differently.
An animation inside a graphic symbol doesn’t play independently, as it does in a
movie clip symbol. It will only play if there are sufficient frames on the main
Timeline where the instance is placed. And while you can control the internal
playhead of a movie clip timeline with code, you can control the playhead of a
graphic symbol directly in the Properties panel. Because of the ease with which
you can choose what frames appear inside graphic symbols, they are ideal for
lip-syncing or other character variations.
Using the Frame Picker for phonemes
When animated characters talk, their mouths should be synchronized with their
words. Each sound, or phoneme, is produced by a different mouth shape. For
example, an explosive “p” or “b” sound is made by closing the lips, and an “o”
sound is made by a rounded open mouth. Animators draw a collection of these
mouth positions to synchronize to the soundtrack.
You can store each mouth position as a keyframe in a graphic symbol. The
Frame Picker panel lets you choose the frame on the Timeline that matches each
sound.
In this task, you’ll use the Frame Picker to animate the mouth of the alien from
Lesson 4.
1. Open the sample file 06FramePicker_start.fla in the Lesson06/06Start
folder. The file contains your familiar alien character on the Stage.
The alien is not animated, but his head is a graphic symbol with multiple
keyframes inside its Timeline.

2. Double-click the alien_head graphic symbol in the library.
Animate takes you to symbol-editing mode for the alien_head graphic
symbol. Notice that the Timeline contains five keyframes in the mouth
layer.

3. Examine each keyframe in the mouth layer by advancing the playhead
from frame 1 to frame 5.
Each keyframe shows the mouth in a different position. Frame 1 has a
small closed mouth, frame 2 a rounded mouth, frame 3 a more open
mouth, and so on.
4. Return to Scene 1 and choose Control > Test.
Animate creates a SWF to play the animation. Nothing happens because
there is only a single frame on the main Timeline, and a graphic symbol
needs frames on the main Timeline to play its own timeline.

5. Close the test movie panel and return to your Animate document.
6. Select frame 45 in the head and body layers, and choose Insert >
Timeline > Frame (F5).
Frames are added to both layers up to frame 45.
7. Choose Control > Play (Enter/Return).
Animate plays the animation. Your alien now can’t stop talking! The
graphic symbol plays all five of its keyframes repeatedly during the 45
frames of the main Timeline. The graphic symbol is, by default, set to
loop, but you’ll select a single frame to play instead.
8. Select the alien’s head on the Stage, and in the Looping section of the
Properties panel, choose Single Frame from the Options menu. Leave
the value of the First field at 1.
Now the Stage displays only one frame from the alien_head graphic
symbol, which is frame 1.
9. Move the playhead to frame 10 of the head layer.
10. With the playhead at frame 10, select the alien head on the Stage. In the
Looping section of the Properties panel, click Use Frame Picker.

The Frame Picker panel opens and shows thumbnail images of all the
frames inside the graphic symbol.
11. You’ll have the alien mouth the word “hello.” For the first part of the
word, select frame 3 in the Frame Picker. Make sure Create Keyframe
(at the top of the Frame Picker panel) is selected.
Animate automatically adds a keyframe at the current place on the
Timeline, with a new instance of the graphic symbol on frame 3. Now,
when the animation reaches frame 10 the alien head symbol will switch
from displaying frame 1 (the closed mouth) to displaying frame 3, for
the beginning sound in hello.

12. Move the playhead to frame 12 of the main Timeline.
13. In the Frame Picker, select frame 4.
When the animation plays frame 12, the alien head graphic symbol will
change to frame 4. His mouth opens a little wider for the “eh” part of
hello.

14. Move the playhead to frame 14 of the main Timeline.
15. In the Frame Picker, select frame 2.
When the animation reaches frame 14, the head symbol will switch to
displaying frame 2. His mouth is rounded for the “oh” sound.
16. At frame 17, use the Frame Picker to change the mouth back to frame 1.

17. Finally, at frame 30, use the Frame Picker to change the mouth to frame
5 so that the alien gives us a broad smile.

18. Choose Control > Play (Enter/Return).
Animate plays the animation. Your alien lip-syncs “hello,” pauses, and
then smiles.
You’re done with this document, so you can save and close it.
 Note
If you add frame labels to your graphic symbol’s timeline,
those labels will also appear in the Frame Picker to make it
easier to select the frames you want.
Review Questions
1 What are two ways in which classic tweening and motion tweening are
similar?
2 What are two ways in which classic tweening and motion tweening are
different?
3 Why is the Snap To Objects option in the Tools panel important when adding
a motion guide to a classic tween?
4 How can you edit the path of an object’s motion?
5 What are the two axes of the ease graph?
6 How is a graphic symbol different from a movie clip symbol?
Review Answers
1 Both a motion tween and a classic tween require a symbol instance on the
Stage. Another way in which they are similar is that they require their own
layer; no other tween or drawing object can exist on the tween layer.
2 You can apply complex eases to motion tweens on the Timeline through the
Motion Editor. For classic tweens, eases are applied from the Tweening
section of the Properties panel. To change the path of motion of a motion
tween, you can edit the path that appears on the Stage directly. To change the
path of motion for a classic tween, you must create a separate motion guide
layer and draw the path.
3 The Snap To Objects option forces an object to snap to other nearby objects.
For an object to travel along a path in a motion guide, the object must be
attached to the path in the first and the last keyframe.
4 To edit the path of an object’s motion, choose the Selection tool and drag

directly on the path to bend it. You can also choose the Convert Anchor Point
tool and Subselection tool to pull out handles at the anchor points. The
handles control the curvature of the path.
5 The ease graph shows the amount of change in the tween versus the amount of
time that has passed. The time (in frames) is shown horizontally and the
percent of tween is shown vertically.
6 A graphic symbol plays an animation on its timeline only if there are sufficient
frames on the main Timeline where the instance is placed. A movie clip
symbol, on the other hand, contains an independent timeline, so it will play its
animation regardless of how long the main Timeline lasts, as long as an
instance remains on the Stage.

7. Controlling the Camera
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Understand the kinds of motion that are best animated with the
Camera tool
Activate the camera
Hide or reveal the camera
Pan, rotate, and zoom the camera
Create depth with layers
Attach layers to the camera to keep them independent of camera
motion
Apply color effects to the camera
This lesson will take about one hour to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

Use the camera to focus your audience’s attention in your animation. Use
filmmaking techniques such as panning, zooming, and even rotating to direct
the action for more cinematic approaches.
Animating Camera Moves
So far, you’ve learned to animate different properties of symbol instances on the
Stage—their position, scale, rotation, transparency, filters, and 3D position.
You’ve also explored how you can create complex motion with eases.
However, as an animator, you’re not just directing the motion of your characters
and objects on the Stage like a play. You’re also in control of the camera, making
you more like the director of a movie. That means controlling where to point the
camera to frame the action, zooming in or out, panning, or even rotating the
camera for special effect. All of these camera movements are available in
Animate with the Camera tool.
Getting Started
Start by viewing the finished movie file to see educational video that you’ll
create in this lesson.

1. Double-click the 07End.mp4 file in the Lesson07/07End folder to play
the video file.
The project is an animation showing the trajectory of the Juno
spacecraft, which was launched from Earth in 2011 and reached Jupiter
in 2016. The animation is something that you might see on an
educational site or at a museum. Notice how the audience’s view zooms
in and out, and how the camera tracks the Juno as it moves across the
solar system. At various points in the animation, captions appear to
explain what’s happening.
2. Close the 07End.mp4 file.
3. Double-click the 07Start.fla file in the Lesson07/07Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate.

This file is an ActionScript 3.0 document that contains the completed
animation of the Juno’s trajectory and the orbiting Jupiter and Earth.
You created a similar animation in Lesson 6, but this one has additional
animated elements. There are no camera moves in this project; you’ll
add those in this lesson. It also contains additional graphic elements
imported into the library for you to use.
4. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 07_workingcopy.fla, and save it
in the 07Start folder.
Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be
available if you want to start over.
5. Choose Control > Test.

Animate generates a SWF for you to preview the animation. You see a
partial view of the solar system, with the sun in the middle and Earth
and Jupiter orbiting. A spacecraft launches from Earth and follows a
gray track. Watch how it circles back toward Earth to be flung away to
intercept Jupiter.
The animation is decent, and the Stage shows all the action: the orbiting
planets and the movement of the Juno spacecraft. However, it lacks
drama, and some details get lost because of the different scales we’re
seeing. When Juno circles back toward Earth to use its gravity as a
slingshot effect to propel it toward Jupiter, wouldn’t it be nice to see it
up close as it approaches Earth to get flung back out? That’s where the
Camera tool can help. You’ll animate the camera to direct our attention
to the action. Get close when you need to, or zoom back out to show the
big picture. Use a camera to follow the spacecraft just as you would
follow a character across the Stage.
Understanding the project file
Your 07_workingcopy.fla project file contains three layers—earth, juno, and
jupiter—containing classic tweens with a motion guide for each. The motion
guides keep the animation on track. Remember that the motion guides for classic
tweens are not visible when the animation is published, so to show the orbits of
the planets and the trajectory of Juno, the guides have been duplicated in the
layers called orbits and juno_trajectory. The bottom layer, called sun, contains

the sun in the middle of the solar system.
Using the Camera
Think of the camera as just another object to which you can apply a motion or
classic tween to animate its position, rotation, or scale. If you’re already
comfortable with managing keyframes and tweens, then the Camera tool should
feel familiar.
Enabling the camera
Enable the camera with the Camera tool in the Tools panel (
) or with the
Add/Remove Camera button below the Timeline.
Select the Camera tool on the Tools panel, or click Add Camera at the
bottom of the Timeline.
A Camera layer is added to the top of your Timeline and becomes active.
On the Stage, the camera controls appear.

Characteristics of the camera
The Camera layer operates a little differently than a normal layer to which you
add graphics.
The size of your Stage becomes the frame of your camera view.
You can have only one Camera layer, and it is always at the top of all
your other layers.
You cannot rename the Camera layer.
You can’t add objects or draw in the Camera layer, but you can add
classic or motion tweens to the layer, which allows you to animate the
camera motion and camera filters.
When the Camera tool is selected, you cannot move or edit objects in
other layers. Disable the camera by selecting the Selection tool or by
clicking the Remove Camera button at the bottom of the Timeline.
 Note
Clicking the Remove Camera button at the bottom of the
Timeline doesn’t actually delete your Camera layer; it only
hides it from view. You can click the button again to restore
the Camera layer. To delete the Camera layer entirely, select
it and click the Delete button (trash can icon).

 Note
The Camera tool is available for all types of Animate
documents.
Setting the camera frame
First, you’ll use the camera to frame just a small part of the solar system to focus
on the beginning of the action: the launch of the Juno from Earth.
1. Make sure that your Camera tool is active and that the on-Stage controls
are present. There are two modes on the controls, one for Rotate and
another for Zoom. The Zoom mode should be highlighted.
2. Drag the slider to the right.
The Camera view zooms closer into the Stage.
3. When your slider reaches the edge of the Camera control, release your
mouse.
The slider snaps back to the center, allowing you to continue dragging to
the right to continue zooming.
You can also enter a numerical value for the zoom in the Properties
panel’s Camera Properties section.
4. Continue zooming the camera until you’ve reached about 260%.

5. Now drag your camera so that the sun in the middle of the solar system
is centered.
It may seem backward to see the objects on the Stage move in the
opposite direction that you drag, but remember that you’re moving the
camera and not the objects.
As you scrub the Timeline to see the animation, notice that your point of
view is now closer into the action.

 Note
When using the camera zoom mode, be aware of the image
resolution. As with any bitmap, zooming in too
dramatically will reveal the limitations of the original
embedded image.
Animating a zoom-out
Since your camera is zoomed into the earth, you can more easily see the launch
of the Juno spacecraft. However, at about frame 60, Juno leaves the Stage
boundaries. You’ll want to zoom the camera out to keep the spacecraft in view.
1. Select frame 24 on the Camera layer.
2. Insert a new keyframe (F6) at frame 24.
You’ll keep the camera in the zoomed-in position from frames 1 to
frame 24, and then begin to animate the camera motion from frame 24.
3. Select the keyframe you just created on frame 24 on the Camera layer,

right-click, and choose Create Motion Tween.
A motion tween is applied starting at frame 24, indicated by the blue
tween span on the Camera layer.
4. Move the playhead to frame 72.
5. Drag the Camera zoom slider on the Stage to the left to zoom out and
see more of the solar system. The zoom percentage in the Properties
panel should be about 170%. Move the camera so that Juno remains
roughly in the center of view.
A keyframe is automatically created at frame 72 with the new Zoom
value and position for the camera.

6. Scrub the Timeline between frames 24 and 72 to see the animated zoom.
As Juno moves farther away from Earth, the camera zooms out to keep
it in the frame.
Animating a pan
A pan is the motion of the camera side to side or up and down. In this next step,
you’ll pan the camera slowly from left to right to follow the motion of the Juno
spacecraft.
1. Move the playhead on the Timeline to frame 160.
At this point in time, you’ll create another keyframe that establishes a
new position for the camera.
2. Move the camera on the Stage to the right. Hold down the Shift key to
constrain the movement to a straight line.
The spacecraft should roughly remain at the center of the frame.

3. A new keyframe is automatically created at frame 160.
4. Press Enter/Return to preview the motion tween, which animates your
camera zooming out from frames 24 to 72, and then panning to the right
from frames 72 to 160, tracking the spacecraft.
Animating a zoom-in
A crucial part of this animation is when Juno does a fly-by of Earth, using its
gravity as a slingshot to get to Jupiter. You’ll zoom in closer to show how the
spacecraft approaches Earth.
1. Right-click frame 160 and choose Insert Keyframe > All.
Inserting a keyframe for all the camera properties at frame 160 ensures
that any future changes in zoom, position, or rotation occur from frame
160 and not from an earlier point on the Timeline.
2. Move the playhead on the Timeline to frame 190.
At this point in time, Juno is at its closest to Earth.
3. Zoom and move the camera on the Stage so that Earth and Juno are
close-up and centered. The Zoom value should be about 760%.

4. A new keyframe is automatically created at frame 190.
5. Press Enter/Return to preview the motion tween.
From frame 160 to frame 190, the camera does a dramatic zoom in as
Juno flies toward Earth.
Animating a rotation
Rotating the camera is unusual, but in some cases, the motion can be quite
dramatic and effective. In this project, rotating the camera will intensify the
feeling of flying right next to the spacecraft as it approaches Earth.
1. Make sure the playhead on the Timeline is still on frame 190.
2. Select the Rotation option on the Camera slider.
3. Drag the Camera slider to the right so that the camera rotates clockwise
(and the objects in view rotate counterclockwise).
The Rotation value should be about –39 degrees.
4. Move the camera so that the spacecraft behind the earth is roughly in the
center.

5. Preview the animation by pressing Enter/Return or scrubbing the
Timeline.
The dramatic fly-by of Earth by Juno is captured by the camera zooming
in and rotating to be close to the action.
Finishing the camera moves
After the earth fly-by, Juno continues its trajectory toward Jupiter. You’ll
animate the camera to frame the rest of its journey with additional zooms,
rotations, and pans.
1. Move the playhead to frame 215.
2. Reset the Rotation value of the Camera to 0 degrees. In the Properties
panel, enter 0 for the Rotate value or click the Reset Camera Rotation
button in front of the Rotate label.
The Camera view tilts back to its default angle.
3. Move the Camera so that Earth and Juno are about at the center.

4. Now move the playhead to frame 288.
Juno is moving farther out from the solar system, so you’ll need to keep
backing up the camera.
5. Change the Zoom value to about 90% and move the Camera so that
most of the solar system, including Jupiter’s orbit, is in view.
6. Select frame 480. Right-click and choose Insert Keyframe > All.

A new keyframe is created at frame 480.
Your final camera move is to zoom into Juno’s approach to Jupiter, so
you have to create a beginning keyframe to establish the beginning
values for the camera’s zoom, position, and rotation.
7. Select frame 480 on the Camera layer.
8. Zoom in and move the camera so that Jupiter and Juno almost fill the
frame. The Zoom value of the Camera should be about 1400%.
 Note
When you zoom in too far all at once, you may lose sight of
your graphics and may have trouble putting them back into

the camera frame. It’s best to zoom a little bit at a time, and
move the camera to keep the graphics that you want to
zoom in on within the frame.
9. Preview the entire animation by choosing Control > Test.
Animate exports the animation as a SWF in a new window. The
animation plays with camera pans, zooms, and rotations that closely
follows Juno’s journey from Earth to Jupiter.
Creating Depth
When you move a camera to film a scene in real life, you get a sense of depth
because foreground elements move across the frame a little quicker than
background elements. This is called a parallax effect, and we’re familiar with
the effect when we look out the window of a moving car. The closer trees and
street signs zip past our window while the distant mountains on the horizon
move very slowly.
Animate offers the ability to create the same sense of depth when you animate
camera moves using the Layer Depth panel. The Layer Depth panel allows you
to set a layer’s z-depth, which is its distance from the Camera layer.
By default, the Layer Depth panel is turned off, and all layers have a z-depth
value of 0. When the Layer Depth panel is turned off, camera pans and zooms do
not show a sense of depth, and the overall effect is as if the camera were panning

across or zooming in or out of a flat picture. The picture moves or gets bigger or
smaller, but there is no differential movement of separate layers.
 Note
The Layer Depth panel can be used independently of the Camera
tool. That is, you can place objects in layers with different depth
levels and animate them without activating the Camera tool.
However, it is the motion of the camera in conjunction with layers
at different z-depths that allows viewers to see the three-
dimensionality of a scene.
Adding layers of stars
In the following tasks, you’ll enhance the animation of Juno’s journey to Jupiter
by creating a sense of depth. You’ll add a few layers of stars and position them at
different z-depth distances, which will enhance the vastness of space.
1. Add a new layer in your Timeline and move it to the bottom of the layer
stack.
2. Rename the layer stars1.
The stars1 layer will contain the first layer of stars.
3. In the Library panel, drag the graphic symbol called stars1 from the
Library onto the Stage.

The graphic is simply a collection of gray and white dots randomly
scattered over a large area. Don’t worry too much about precise
placement; just position the instance to cover most of the solar system.
It may be helpful to change the Stage view magnification level so that
you can see more of the graphics that may be off the Stage (and out of
camera view).
4. Add another layer called stars2 below stars1, and add the graphic
symbol stars2 in that layer.
Again, just make sure the stars cover most of the solar system.
5. Add a third layer of stars called stars3 below all the others, and add the
graphic symbol stars3 in that layer.

You may have noticed that the size of the field of stars in each of the
layers gets progressively larger. That is, stars3 is larger than stars2, and
stars2 is larger than stars1. The background graphics do need to be quite
large in anticipation of moving them to a deeper z-depth level farther
from the Camera layer. The farther from the Camera layer (the larger the
z-depth), the smaller the graphics will appear.

6. Preview your animation by pressing the Enter/Return key.
While the stars add a nice touch of realism to the highly diagrammatic
solar system, the stars are still flat and don’t move with any parallax
effect. You’ll change that with the Layer Depth panel, next.
Setting the z-depth in the Layer Depth panel
The Layer Depth panel manages the distances of each layer from the Camera
layer.
1. At the top of the Timeline, click the Advanced Layers button.
Animate displays a notification about advanced layers, and how they
allow you to control a layer’s depth level.
2. Click Use Advanced Layers.
The Advanced Layers button appears depressed and is labeled “On,”
indicating that advanced layers are activated.
3. Next to the Advanced Layers button, click the Layer Depth button, or
choose Window > Layer Depth.
The Layer Depth panel appears, showing all the layers in the order in
which they appear in the Timeline. Next to each layer is a 0, indicating
its current z-depth value. Next to the z-depth value is a color coded to
the depth diagram on the right of the panel.
Since all the layers are currently at a z-depth of 0, they are at the same
depth level, and they lie at the same plane as the camera frame.

The camera is indicated by the ball with the dotted lines radiating from
it. The flat blue line attached to the dotted diagonal lines shows the field
of view of the camera.
4. Drag the z-depth value for the stars3 layer to increase it to 500. You can
also click the value to enter a numeric value, or you can drag the
corresponding colored line.
Notice the effect of the stars3 graphic on the Stage as you change the z-
depth value. As the z-depth increases, the layer’s distance from the
camera increases and the stars recede. If you decrease the z-depth into
negative values, you can actually make the layer appear behind the
camera (try it out!).

5. Set the z-depth value for the stars2 layer to 300 and the z-depth value
for the stars1 layer to 150.
The diagram on the right in the panel indicates the positions of the three
layers relative to the camera and the other layers (which remain at a z-
depth value of 0). The bold highlighted layer in the diagram is the layer
that is currently selected.
6. That’s all you have to do! Preview the effects of setting your last three
layers farther behind the others.
The parallax effect due to the motion of the camera over levels at
varying depth levels is most noticeable if you scrub the Timeline
between frames 72 and 160. That’s when the camera is panning from left
to right, tracking Juno. You see the orbits sliding by faster than some of
the stars, which are sliding by faster than the more distant ones. The

overall effect is a realistic sense of space.
More on the Layer Depth panel: Animating z-depth
Be aware that the z-depth property is tied to an individual keyframe
for each layer. That means that the same layer can have a certain z-
depth at one keyframe, and then an entirely different z-depth at
another keyframe later in the Timeline. Objects can jump around,
changing distances from the camera. For our project in this lesson,
you won’t have to worry about different keyframes having different
z-depths, since our stars1, stars2, and stars3 layers have only a
single keyframe, at frame 1.
However, since the z-depth is tied to individual keyframes, you can
apply tweens between the two keyframes to animate motion toward
and away from the camera. Animating the z-depth opens up a whole
new world of possibilities in three dimensions and is a powerful
approach to animating in three dimensions in addition to the 3D
Translation and 3D Rotation tools.
Attaching Layers to the Camera for Fixed Graphics
There’s one last item to add to the animation of the Juno spacecraft, and that’s
the informative captions that pop up to explain the different parts of its
trajectory. However, any graphic that we add to the Stage would be subject to all
the camera moves—the panning, rotating, and zooming—that is, unless we fix,
or attach, a layer containing the graphic in such a way that it is unaffected by the
camera motion.
Animate allows you to do this to one or more layers when you attach them to the
Camera layer.
Adding an attached layer to the Camera layer
The attached layer is an option in the Layer Properties dialog box. You can also
attach a layer by choosing the Attach Layer To Camera option in the Timeline.
1. Create a new layer and rename it information.
This new layer will contain the captions that appear at various points
along your animation.

2. Click the black dot next to the layer name under the Attach Layer To
Camera icon in the Timeline.
A chain link icon indicates that the layer is currently locked to the
Camera layer.
3. Double-click the layer icon in front of its name, or choose Modify >
Timeline > Layer Properties.
The Layer Properties dialog box appears. Confirm that the option Attach
To Camera is selected.

Adding the captions
Now you’ll add the information for the animation in kefyrames along the
Timeline.
1. Add about 2 seconds’ worth (48 frames) of time at frame 1 before the
animation begins (F5).
The slight pause before the animation begins will give your audience a
chance to read the first caption.
2. Select frame 1 of the information layer.
3. Select the Rectangle tool. Choose No Stroke and a 50% transparent
white for the Fill.
4. Create a long rectangle from the upper-left corner about 700 pixels wide
and 50 pixels high.
The semitransparent rectangle will be the box for your text.
5. Select the Text tool.
6. Choose a font that appeals to you by choosing from the Family and
Style menus in the Character section of the Properties panel. Make the

Size 28 points (but you may have to increase or decrease the size
depending on your font) and the color black. Select Align Center in the
Paragraph section Format.
7. Drag out a text box over the semitransparent white rectangle in your
information layer.
8. Type Juno’s journey to Jupiter begins and use the Align panel to
center the text over the box horizontally and vertically (see Lesson 2 if
you don’t remember how to use the Align panel).
The first caption is complete.
9. You’ll make the first caption disappear before the next one appears, so
at frame 90, right-click and choose Insert Blank Keyframe (F7).
A blank keyframe appears at frame 90 and the caption disappears from
the Stage.
10. The second caption appears as Juno doubles back toward Earth, so
create another keyframe at frame 118.

11. At this new keyframe at frame 118, copy and paste your text and semi-
transparent rectangle from frame 1.
12. Move the rectangle and caption down to the bottom of the Stage and
change the contents of the text to read Juno heads back to Earth.
13. Continue in a similar manner to add the third caption. The second
caption should disappear at about frame 192, with the third caption
appearing at frame 236. The third caption should read Juno uses
Earth’s gravity as a sling shot. The third caption should disappear at
frame 336. Feel free to play around with the timing and positioning of
the caption!

14. The final caption, which should appear at about frame 454 as the camera
zooms into Jupiter, reads Juno arrives at Jupiter 5 years later.
15. Test your movie.
As the animation plays, your captions appear one by one. Since the
information layer is attached to the Camera layer, the rotations, pans,
and zooms do not affect the contents of the layer.

 Note
You can still change the z-depth value of a layer that is
attached to the Camera layer.
 Note
You can have more than one layer attached to the Camera
layer.
Camera color effects
You can also apply and animate camera color effects to create a
color tint or to change the contrast, saturation, brightness, or hue of
the entire view on the Stage. The effect simulates a filter that a
cameraperson might put on a lens to heighten certain colors for a
mood, or to create a black-and-white film noir feeling.
To apply a color effect, click the Apply button (eye icon) in front of
the Tint or Adjust Color option in the Camera Color Effects section
of the Properties panel. The Camera tool must be active to apply a
camera color effect. Click the color box next to the Tint value to
select the color of the tint, or change the Red, Green, and Blue
values individually and then change the value of the Tint to set the
amount. A value of 100 is the maximum.
Change the values of Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Hue to
modify those properties of your camera color. For example, set the
Saturation to –100 to desaturate all the graphics that appear through

the Camera.
Exporting Your Final Movie
Create the MP4 movie file by exporting it from Animate and converting it in
Media Encoder, a freestanding application that comes packaged with Animate
(you’ll learn more about Media Encoder in Lesson 11).
1. Choose File > Export > Export Video.
The Export Video dialog box opens.
2. Keep the Render size at the original 700 pixels by 400 pixels. Select
Convert Video In Adobe Media Encoder. Choose Browse to select the
destination filename and location.
Animate generates a SWF file and a .mov file from it. The Adobe Media
Encoder automatically launches.
3. In Adobe Media Encoder, choose File > Add Source, or click the Add
Source button (the plus sign) in the Queue panel. Choose the .mov file
that Animate exported.
Adobe Media Encoder adds the file to the queue.
4. In the Preset menu, choose Match Source – Medium Bitrate.

The Match Source – Medium Bitrate setting keeps the dimensions of the
source file (700 pixels by 400 pixels) and maintains a medium quality.
5. Click the Start Queue button (the green triangle) or press Enter/Return
to begin the encoding process.
6. Media Encoder converts the .mov file into an H.264-formatted video
with the standard .mp4 extension.
The final file can be uploaded to Facebook, YouTube, or other video
sharing sites, or put up on your own website.
Review Questions
1 What are the three kinds of camera motion that you can animate with the
Camera tool?
2 How do you activate the Camera layer?
3 What are two ways to attach a layer to the Camera layer?
4 What is the z-depth and how do you change it?
Review Answers
1 You can animate a pan (motion from one side to another or up and down), a
zoom, or a rotation with the Camera tool.
2 Activate the Camera layer by selecting the Camera tool from the Tools panel
or by clicking the Add Camera button at the bottom of the Timeline.
3 Attach a layer to the Camera layer by clicking the dot next to the layer name
and under the Attach Layer To Camera icon in the Timeline. The layer
displays a chain link icon, indicating that it is attached to the Camera layer.
You can also open the Layer Properties window and choose Attach To

Camera.
4 Z-depth is a numerical value that indicates a layer’s distance from the camera.
First, turn on Advanced Layers at the top of the Timeline and open the Layer
Depth panel. Change a layer’s z-depth from the Layer Depth panel (Window >
Layer Depth) by changing the value directly or by dragging the corresponding
colored line that represents a layer relative to the black dotted line that
represents the camera.

8. Animating Shapes and Using Masks
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Animate shapes with shape tweens
Use shape hints to refine shape tweens
Shape tween gradient fills
View onion skin outlines
Apply easing to shape tweens
Create and use masks
Understand mask limitations
Animate the Mask and Masked layers
This lesson will take about one hour to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

You can easily morph—create organic changes in shape—with shape tweens.
Masks provide a way to selectively show only parts of a layer. Together, they
allow you to add more sophisticated effects to your animations.
Getting Started
You’ll start the lesson by viewing the animated logo that you’ll create as you
learn about shape tweens and masks in Adobe Animate CC.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.
See “Getting Started” at the beginning of the book.
1. Double-click the 08End.html file in the Lesson08/08End folder to play

the animation in a browser. Your browser will need Flash Player to play
the animation. Visit https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ for more
information on installing and enabling Flash Player in your browser.
The project is an animation of a flame flickering at the top of a fictional
company name. Not only does the shape of the flame change constantly,
but so does the radial gradient fill inside the flame. A linear gradient
sweeps across the letters of the company name from left to right. In this
lesson, you’ll animate both the flame and the colors that move across the
letters.
2. Close your browser. Double-click the 08Start.fla file in the
Lesson08/08Start folder to open the initial project file in Animate.
3. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 08_workingcopy.fla and save it
in the 08Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original
start file will be available if you want to start over.
Animating Shapes
In the previous lessons, you learned to create animations with symbol instances.
You could animate the motion, scale, rotation, color effect, or filters applied to
symbol instances. However, you couldn’t animate the actual contours of a
graphic. For example, creating an animation of the undulating surface of the
ocean or the slithering motion of a snake’s body is difficult—if not impossible—
with motion or classic tweens. To do something more organic, you have to use
shape tweening.
Shape tweening is a technique for interpolating stroke and fill changes between
different keyframes. Shape tweens make it possible to smoothly morph one
shape into another. Any kind of animation that requires the stroke or fill of a

shape to change—for example, animation of clouds, water, or fire—is a perfect
candidate for shape tweening.
Because shape tweening applies only to shapes, you can’t use groups, symbol
instances, or bitmap images.
Understanding the Project File
The 08Start.fla file is an ActionScript 3.0 document that contains most of the
graphics already completed and organized in different layers. However, the file
is static, and you’ll add the animation.
The text layer is at the very top and contains the company name, “Firestarter.”
The flame layer contains the flame, and the bottom layer, called glow, contains a
radial gradient to provide a soft glow.
There are no assets in the library.
Creating a Shape Tween
To create the flickering flame effect, you’ll animate the undulating changes in a
flame’s typical teardrop shape. You’ll rely on shape tweening to handle the
smooth morphing from one shape to the next, as well as the gradual shifts in
color. A shape tween requires at least two keyframes on the same layer. The
beginning keyframe contains a shape drawn with the drawing tools in Animate
or imported from Adobe Illustrator. The ending keyframe also contains a shape.
A shape tween interpolates the smooth changes between the beginning keyframe
and the end keyframe.
Establish keyframes containing different shapes
In the following steps, you’ll animate the flame that will sit on top of the
company name.
1. Select frame 40 for all three layers.

2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5).
Frames are added to all three layers up to frame 40 to define the overall
length of the animation.
3. Lock the text layer and the glow layer. This prevents you from
accidentally selecting or moving the graphics in those layers.
4. After making sure that none of the frames are selected, right-click frame
40 in the flame layer and select Insert Keyframe, or choose Insert >
Timeline > Keyframe (F6). The contents of the previous keyframe in
frame 1 are copied into the new keyframe.
You now have two keyframes on the Timeline in the flame layer, at
frame 1 and at frame 40. Next, you’ll change the shape of the flame in
the end keyframe.
5. Select the Selection tool.
6. Click away from the shape to deselect it. Move your cursor close to the
outlines of the shape, and drag the contours of the flame to make the
flame skinnier.

The beginning keyframe and the end keyframe now contain different
shapes—a fat flame in the beginning keyframe, and a skinny flame in
the end keyframe in frame 40.
Apply the shape tween
Next, you’ll apply a shape tween between the keyframes to create the smooth
transitions
 Note
Don’t worry if your flame doesn’t morph exactly the way you want
it to. Small changes between keyframes work best. Your flame may
rotate while going from the first shape to the second. You’ll have a
chance later in this lesson to refine the shape tweening with shape
hints.
1. Click any frame between the beginning keyframe and the end keyframe
in the flame layer.
2. Right-click, and choose Create Shape Tween. Or choose Shape Tween
from the Insert menu.

Animate applies a shape tween between the two keyframes, which is
indicated by a black forward-pointing arrow and a green fill in the tween
span.
3. Watch your animation by choosing Control > Play (Enter/Return) or by
clicking the Play button at the bottom of the Timeline.
You have created a smooth animation between the keyframes in the
flame layer, morphing the shape of the first flame into the shape of the
second flame.

Blend types
In the Properties panel, you can modify your shape tween by
choosing either the Distributive or the Angular option for Blend.
These two options determine how Animate makes the interpolations
to change the shapes from one keyframe to the next.
The Distributive option is the default and works well for most cases.
It creates animations in which the intermediate shapes are smoother.
Use the Angular blend if your shapes have many points and straight
lines. Animate attempts to preserve apparent corners and lines in the
intermediate shapes.
Changing the Pace
The keyframes of a shape tween can be easily moved along the Timeline in order
to change the timing or pacing of the animation.
Moving a keyframe
The flame slowly transforms from one shape to another over a period of 40
frames. If you want the flame to make the shape change more rapidly, you need
to move the keyframes closer together.
1. Select the last keyframe of the shape tween in the flame layer.
2. Make sure the box icon appears near your cursor. Drag the last keyframe
to frame 6.
The shape tween shortens.

3. Press Enter/Return to play your animation.
The flame flickers quickly, and then remains static until frame 40.
Adding More Shape Tweens
You can add shape tweens by creating more keyframes. Each shape tween
simply requires two keyframes to define its beginning state and its end state.
Insert additional keyframes
You want the flame to continually change shape, just like a real flame would.
You’ll add more keyframes throughout the animation and apply shape tweens
between all the keyframes.
1. Right-click frame 17 in the flame layer and choose Insert Keyframe. Or
choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
The contents of the previous keyframe are copied into the second
keyframe.
2. Right-click frame 22 in the flame layer and choose Insert Keyframe
(F6).
The contents of the previous keyframe are copied into the new
keyframe.
3. Continue inserting keyframes at frames 27, 33, and 40.

Your Timeline now has seven keyframes in the flame layer, with a shape
tween between the first and second keyframes.
4. Move the red playhead to frame 17.
5. Select the Selection tool.
6. Click away from the shape to deselect it. Drag the contours of the flame
to create another variation in its shape. You can make the base thicker,
or change the curvature of the tip to make it lean left or right.
7. Modify the flame shapes in each of the newly inserted keyframes to
create subtle variations.

Extending the shape tweens
Your next step is to extend the shape tween so that the flame morphs from one
shape to the next.
1. Right-click any frame between the second and third keyframes, and
choose Create Shape Tween. Or choose Insert > Shape Tween.
A black forward-pointing arrow on a green background appears between
the two keyframes, showing that you’ve applied a shape tween.
2. Continue to insert shape tweens between all the keyframes.
You should have six shape tweens in the flame layer.

3. Press Enter/Return to watch the animation play.
Your flame flickers back and forth for the duration of the animation.
Depending on how extensive your modifications to the flame have been,
your flame may undergo some weird contortions between keyframes—
for example, flipping or rotating unpredictably. Don’t worry! You’ll
have a chance later in the lesson to refine your animation with shape
hints.
 Note
Try this shortcut: select a range of frames that cover multiple
keyframes, right-click, and choose Create Shape Tween to apply a
shape tween across all keyframes.
Broken tweens
Every shape tween needs a beginning and an end keyframe with a
shape inside each. If the last keyframe of a shape tween is missing,
Animate shows the broken tween as a dotted black line (rather than
a solid arrow).

In this example, insert a keyframe at frame 40 to fix the tween.
Creating a Looping Animation
Your flame should flicker back and forth continuously for as long as the logo is
onscreen. You can create a seamless loop by making the first and last keyframe
identical and putting the animation inside a movie clip symbol. A movie clip
timeline loops continuously, independently of the main Timeline.
Duplicating keyframes
Make the first keyframe identical to the last keyframe by duplicating its
contents.
1. Right-click the first keyframe on the flame layer and select Copy
Frames. Or choose Edit > Timeline > Copy Frames.
The contents of the first keyframe are placed on your clipboard.
2. Right-click the last keyframe on the flame layer and select Paste
Frames. Or choose Edit > Timeline > Paste Frames.

The first and last keyframes now contain identical flame shapes.
 Note
The Loop Playback option loops only in the Animate CC authoring
environment, and not when it is published.
 Tip
You can quickly duplicate keyframes by first selecting a keyframe
and then Alt/Option-dragging the keyframe to a new position.
Previewing the loop
Use the Loop button at the bottom of the Timeline to preview your animation.
1. Click the Loop button at the bottom of the Timeline, or choose Control
> Loop Playback (Alt+Shift+L/Option+Shift+L) to enable continuous
playback when you play the movie.
Markers appear on the Timeline header indicating the range of frames
that loop during playback. Next, adjust the markers to extend the loop to
include the entire movie.
2. Extend the markers to include all the frames on your Timeline (frames 1
through 40), or click the Modify Markers button and choose Marker
Range All.

3. Press Enter/Return to test the animation.
The flame animation plays and loops continuously. Click the Pause
button or press Enter/Return again to stop the animation. Deselect the
Loop button at the bottom of the Timeline to hide the markers and end
the loop playback mode.
Inserting the animation into a movie clip
When your animation plays in a movie clip symbol, the animation loops
automatically.
1. Select all the frames on the flame layer, right-click, and choose Cut
Frames. Or choose Edit > Timeline > Cut Frames.
The keyframes and shape tweens are removed from the Timeline and
placed on the clipboard.
2. Choose Insert > New Symbol (Ctrl+F8/Command+F8).
The Create New Symbol dialog box appears.
3. Enter flame as the name of the symbol, and choose Movie Clip as the
Type. Click OK.

A new movie clip symbol is created and opens in symbol-editing mode.
4. Right-click the first frame on your movie clip timeline and select Paste
Frames. Or choose Edit > Timeline > Paste Frames.
The flame animation from the main Timeline is pasted into your movie
clip symbol’s timeline.
5. Click the Scene 1 button on the Edit bar at the top of the Stage, or
choose Edit > Edit Document (Ctrl+E/Command+E).
You exit symbol-editing mode and return to the main Timeline.
6. Select the flame layer, which is currently empty. Drag your newly
created flame movie clip symbol from the Library panel to the Stage.
An instance of the flame movie clip symbol appears on the Stage.

7. Choose Control > Test (Ctrl+Enter/Command+Return).
Animate exports the SWF in a new window, where you can preview the
animation. The flame flickers continuously in a seamless loop.
Shape tweening with variable width strokes
Any aspect of a shape can be shape tweened, including variable
widths of a shape’s stroke. In Lesson 2, you learned to use the
Width tool to create lines with thick and thin variations for more
expressive graphics. You can change the width of the strokes in
different keyframes, and when you apply a shape tween between
those keyframes, Animate creates smooth interpolations of those
stroke widths.
Considering the ability to animate the thickness of a shape’s stroke,
the contours of the stroke itself, and the inside fill of a shape, the
creative possibilities are nearly limitless.
Using Shape Hints
Animate CC creates the smooth transitions between keyframes of your shape
tween, but sometimes the results are unpredictable. Your shapes may go through
strange contortions, flips, and rotations to get from one keyframe to another. You
may like the effect, but more often than not you’ll want to maintain control of
the transformations. Using shape hints can help refine the shape changes.
Shape hints force Animate to map points on the start shape to corresponding
points on the end shape. By placing multiple shape hints, you can more precisely

control how a shape tween appears.
Adding shape hints
Now you’ll add shape hints to the shape of the flame to modify the way it
morphs from one shape to the next.
 Tip
Shape hints should be placed on the edges of shapes.
1. Double-click the flame movie clip symbol in the library to enter
symbol-editing mode. Select the first keyframe of the shape tween in the
flame layer.
2. Choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape Hint
(Ctrl+Shift+H/Command+Shift+H).
A red-circled letter “a” appears on the Stage. The circled letter

represents the first shape hint.
3. Select the Selection tool and make sure that Snap To Objects is selected.
The magnet icon at the bottom of the Tools panel should be selected.
Snap To Objects ensures that objects snap to each other when being
moved or modified.
4. Drag the circled letter to the tip of the flame.
5. Choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape Hint again to create a second
shape hint.
A red-circled “b” appears on the Stage.

6. Drag the “b” shape hint to the bottom of the flame shape.
You have two shape hints mapped to different points on the shape in the
first keyframe.
7. Select the next keyframe of the flame layer (frame 6).
A corresponding red-circled “b” appears on the Stage, hiding an “a”
shape hint that is directly under it.

8. Drag the circled letters to corresponding points on the shape in the
second keyframe. The “a” hint goes on the top of the flame, and the “b”
hint goes on the bottom of the flame.
The shape hints turn green, indicating that you’ve correctly placed them.
9. Select the first keyframe.
Note that the initial shape hints have turned yellow, indicating that they
are correctly placed. When placed properly, the shape hints in the
beginning keyframe turn yellow and those in the ending keyframe turn
green.

10. Scrub the playhead through the first shape tween on the Timeline to see
the effect of the shape hints on the shape tween.
The shape hints force the tip of the flame in the first keyframe to map to
the tip of the flame in the second keyframe and force the bottoms to map
to each other. This restricts the transformations.
To demonstrate the value of shape hints, you can deliberately create a
mess of your shape tweens. In the end keyframe, put the “b” hint at the
top of the flame and the “a” hint at the bottom.

Animate forces the tip of the flame to tween to the bottom of the flame,
and vice versa. The result is a strange flipping motion as Animate tries
to make the transformation. Put the “a” back at the top and the “b” back
at the bottom after you’re done experimenting.
 Tip
You can add a maximum of 26 shape hints to any shape
tween. Be sure to add them consistently in a clockwise or
counterclockwise direction for best results.
Removing shape hints
If you’ve added too many shape hints, you can easily delete the unnecessary
ones. Removing a shape hint in one keyframe will remove its corresponding
shape hint in the other keyframe.
Drag an individual shape hint entirely off the Stage and pasteboard.
Choose Modify > Shape > Remove All Hints to delete all the shape hints.
Only the content in the keyframes of a shape tween is displayed fully rendered.
All other frames are shown as outlines. To see all frames fully rendered, use
onion skinning, as described in the next exercise.
Previewing Animations with Onion Skinning
It’s sometimes useful to see how your shapes are changing from one keyframe to

another on the Stage all at once. Seeing how the shapes gradually change lets
you make smarter adjustments to your animation. You can do so using the onion
skinning option, available at the bottom of the Timeline.
Onion skinning shows the contents of the frames before and after the currently
selected frame.
The term “onion skin” comes from the world of traditional hand-drawn
animation, in which animators draw on thin, semitransparent tracing paper
known as onionskin. A light box shines a light behind the drawings to allow
them to be seen through several sheets. When creating an action sequence,
animators flip back and forth quickly between drawings held between their
fingers. This allows them to see how the drawings smoothly connect to each
other.
Turning on onion skinning
There are two modes for onion skinning: Onion Skin and Onion Skin Outlines.
Although both show previous and future frames, Onion Skin displays graphics
fully rendered, whereas Onion Skin Outlines shows only the outlines of your
graphics. In this task, you’ll use Onion Skin Outlines.
1. Click the Onion Skin Outlines button at the bottom of the Timeline.
Animate shows several outlines of the flame, with the currently selected
frame in red. The previous two frames are shown in blue, and the future
two frames are shown in green. The outlines of the flame fade the farther
away they are from the current frame.

On the Timeline, Animate displays markers to bracket your currently
selected frame. The blue-marked bracket (to the left of the playhead)
indicates how many previous frames are shown on the Stage, and the
green-marked bracket (to the right of the playhead) indicates how many
future frames are shown.
2. Move the playhead to a different frame.
Animate keeps the markers around the playhead no matter where you
move it, always showing the same number of frames behind and ahead.
3. Click the Onion Skin button at the bottom of the Timeline.
Onion skinning switches from Outlines mode to the standard Onion Skin
mode, showing the onion skins of your flame fully rendered. The flames
from previous frames are tinted blue, and the flames from future frames
are tinted green.

 Tip
You can even scrub the playhead back and forth along the Timeline
to see the ghostly images of the onion skins moving along with the
animation. You cannot see onion skins during normal playback,
however.
Adjusting the markers
You can move either marker to show more or fewer onion skin frames.
Drag the blue marker to adjust the number of past onion skin frames
shown.
Drag the green marker to adjust the number of future frames displayed.
Hold down the Ctrl/Command key while dragging either marker to move
the past and future markers in equal amounts.
Hold down the Shift key while dragging either marker to move the onion
skin range to a different spot on the Timeline (as long as it still

encompasses the playhead).
Click the Modify Markers menu button to select a preset marker option.
For example, you can choose Marker Range 2 or Marker Range 5 to have
the markers show two or five frames, respectively, in front of and behind
the current frame.
Customizing onion skin colors
If you don’t like the green and blue color coding of previous and future frames,
you can change them in the preferences.
1. Choose Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Animate CC > Preferences
(Mac).
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. In the Onion Skin Color section, click the color boxes for Past, Present,
or Future to choose new colors.
3. Click OK. Deselect the Onion Skin or Onion Skin Outlines button to
return to the default view.

Animating Color
Shape tweens interpolate all aspects of a shape, which means that both the stroke
and fill of a shape can be tweened. So far, you’ve modified the stroke, or
outlines, of the flame. In the next section, you’ll modify the fill so that the color
gradient can change—perhaps glow brighter and more intensely at some points
in the animation.
Adjusting the gradient fills
Use the Gradient Transform tool to change the way the color gradient is applied
to a shape, and use the Color panel to change the actual colors used in a gradient.
1. If you’re not already in symbol-editing mode for your flame symbol,
double-click the flame movie clip symbol in the library to edit it.
2. Select the second keyframe on the flame layer (frame 6).
3. Select the Gradient Transform tool, which is grouped with the Free
Transform tool in the Tools panel.
The control points for the Gradient Transform tool appear on the
gradient fill of the flame. The various control points allow you to

stretch, rotate, and move the focal point of the gradient within the fill.
4. Use the control points to tighten the color gradient into the base of the
flame. Reduce the gradient’s size, make it wider, position it lower on the
flame, and move the focal point (represented by a tiny triangle) of the
gradient to one side.

Your flame’s orange core appears lower and more intense because the
colors are distributed in a smaller area.
5. Move the playhead along the Timeline between the first and second
keyframe.
The shape tween automatically animates the colors inside the flame as
well as its contours.
6. Select the third keyframe on the flame layer (frame 17). In this frame,

you’ll adjust the actual color of the gradient.
7. Select the Selection tool and click the fill of the flame on the Stage.
8. Open the Color panel (Window > Color).
The Color panel appears, showing you the gradient colors of the selected
fill.
9. Click the inner color marker, which is currently yellow.
10. Change the color to a hot pink (#F109EE).
The center color of the gradient turns pink.
11. Move the playhead along the Timeline between the second and third

keyframes.
The shape tween automatically animates the center color in the gradient
from yellow to pink. Experiment with the other keyframes by modifying
the gradient fill and see what kinds of interesting effects you can apply
to your flickering flame.
 Note
Shape tweens can smoothly animate solid colors or color
gradients, but they can’t animate between different types of
gradients. For example, you can’t shape tween a linear
gradient into a radial gradient.
Creating and Using Masks
Masking is a way of selectively hiding and displaying content on a layer. It
enables you to control the content that your audience sees. For example, you can
make a circular mask and allow your audience to see only through the circular
area so that you get a keyhole or spotlight effect. In Animate, you put a mask on
one layer and the masked content in a layer below it.
For the animated logo you’re creating in this lesson, you’ll make the text a little

more visually interesting by using the text itself as a mask.
Define the mask layer
You’ll create from the “Fire starter” text a mask that will reveal an image of a
fire beneath it.
1. Return to the main Timeline. Unlock the text layer. Double-click the
icon in front of the text layer name, or select the text layer and choose
Modify > Timeline > Layer Properties.
The Layer Properties dialog box appears.
2. Select Mask and click OK.
The text layer becomes a mask layer, indicated by the mask icon in front
of the layer name. Anything in this layer will act as a mask for a masked
layer below it.

For this lesson, we’re using the text already in place as the mask, but the
mask can be any filled shape. The color of the fill doesn’t matter. What’s
important to Animate are the size, location, and contours of the shape.
The shape will be the “peephole” through which you’ll see the content
on the layer below. You can use any of the drawing or text tools to create
the fill for your mask.
 Note
Animate does not recognize different Alpha levels in a mask created
on a timeline, so a semitransparent fill in the mask layer has the
same effect as an opaque fill, and edges will always be hard.
However, in an ActionScript 3.0 document, you can use
ActionScript code to dynamically create masks that will allow
transparencies.
 Tip
Masks do not recognize strokes, so use only fills in the mask layer.
Text created with the Text tool also works as a mask.
Create the masked layer
The masked layer is always under the mask layer.
1. Click the New Layer button, or choose Insert > Timeline > Layer.
A new layer appears.
2. Rename the layer fiery effect.

3. Drag the fiery effect layer under the mask layer (named “text”) and a
little to the right so that it becomes indented.
The fiery effect layer becomes a masked layer, paired with the mask
layer above it. Any content in the masked layer will be masked by the
layer above it.
4. Choose File > Import > Import To Stage, and select fire.jpg from the
08Start folder.
The bitmap image of fire appears on the Stage, and the words appear
over the image.
 Tip
You can also double-click a normal layer under a mask layer, or
choose Modify > Timeline > Layer Properties, and select Masked to
modify the layer into a masked layer.
See the effects of the mask
To see the effects of the mask layer on its masked layer, lock both layers.
1. Click the Lock option for both the text layer and the fiery effect layer.

Both mask and masked layers become locked. The shapes of the letters
in the mask layer reveal parts of the image in the masked layer.
2. Choose Control > Test.
As the flame flickers above the text, the letters reveal the fiery texture in
the layer below it.
 Note
You can have multiple masked layers under a single mask
layer.
Traditional masks
It might seem counterintuitive that the shapes in the mask layer
reveal, rather than hide, the content in the masked layer. However,
that’s exactly how a traditional mask in photography or painting
works. When a painter uses a mask, the mask protects the painting
from paint splatters. When a photographer uses a mask in the
darkroom, the mask protects the photosensitive paper from the light,
to prevent those areas from getting any darker. So thinking of a
mask as something that protects a lower, masked layer is a good
way to remember which areas are hidden and which are revealed.

Animating the Mask and Masked Layers
The letters of your animated logo have more drama now that you’ve created a
mask with an image of fire behind it. However, the client for this fictional
project now demands that it have even more punch. Although she likes the look
of the fiery letters, she wants an animated effect.
Fortunately, you can include animations in either the mask or the masked layer.
You can create an animation in the mask layer if you want the mask itself to
move or expand to show different parts of the masked layer. Or you can create
an animation in the masked layer if you want the content to move under a mask,
like scenery whizzing by a train window.
Adding a tween to the masked layer
To make the logo more compelling for your client, you’ll add a shape tween to
the masked layer. The shape tween will move a glow from left to right for a
portion of the movie under the letters.
1. Unlock both the text layer and the fiery effect layer.
The effects of the mask and masked layer are no longer visible, but their
contents are now editable.
2. Delete the bitmap image of the fire in the fiery effect layer.
3. Choose the Rectangle tool and open the Color panel (Window > Color).
4. In the Color panel, make sure Fill Color is selected and choose Linear
Gradient from the Color Type menu.
5. Create a gradient that starts with red on the far left (#FF0000), goes to
yellow in the middle (#FFFC00), and becomes red again on the far right
(#FF0000). Make sure your Alpha settings are at 100% so that the
colors are not transparent.

6. Create a rectangle in the fiery effect layer that encompasses the letters in
the text layer.
7. Choose the Gradient Transform tool, and click the fill of your rectangle
to select it.
The control handles for the Gradient Transform tool appear on the fill of
the rectangle. We’ll use this tool to position the gradient off the Stage so
it can make a dramatic entrance.

8. Drag the center point of the gradient so that the yellow color appears on
the far left side of the Stage.
The yellow glow will enter from the left and move to the right.
9. Right-click frame 20 in the fiery effect layer and choose Insert
Keyframe (F6).
The contents of the previous keyframe are copied into the new
keyframe.
10. Right-click the last frame (frame 40) in the fiery effect layer and choose
Insert Keyframe (F6).
The contents of the keyframe at frame 20 are copied into the new

keyframe. You now have three keyframes in the fiery effect layer.
11. Make sure that your playhead is still in the last frame (frame 40).
12. Drag the center point of the gradient far enough to the right so that the
yellow color is just barely visible on the right side of the Stage.
13. Right-click anywhere on the Timeline between the second and third
keyframe in the fiery effect layer, and select Create Shape Tween. Or,
from the top menu, choose Insert > Shape Tween.
The color gradient is shape tweened so that the yellow glow moves
within the fill of the rectangle from left to right.

14. Watch your animation by choosing Control > Test.
While the flame burns above the letters, a soft yellow glow flashes
across the letters.
Easing a Shape Tween
Eases help your animation bear a sense of weight by enabling you to add an
acceleration or deceleration component to its motion.
You add an ease to a shape tween in the Properties panel. Ease values range from
−100, which indicates an ease-in, to 100, which indicates an ease-out. An ease-in

makes the motion start off slowly. An ease-out slows down the motion as it
approaches its end keyframe.
 Note
The Motion Editor, which is the advanced panel integrated into the
Timeline that provides different ease types, is not available for
shape tweens.
Adding an ease-in
You’ll make the glow that flashes across the letters of the logo begin slowly and
then pick up speed. The ease-in will help viewers take notice of the animation
before it proceeds.
1. Click anywhere inside the shape tween in the fiery effect layer.
2. In the Properties panel, enter -100 for the Ease value.
Animate applies an ease-in effect to the shape tween.
3. Make sure your mask and masked layers are locked, and choose Control
> Test to test your movie.
The soft yellow glow flashes across the letters, starting off slowly and
then adding a little more sophistication to the entire animation.
 Note
As with classic tweens, you can apply more advanced eases or even
custom eases. Click the Classic Ease button to access the additional
ease options.
Review Questions
1 What is a shape tween, and how do you apply it?
2 What are shape hints, and how do you use them?
3 What does the color-coding of the onion skin markers indicate?

4 How is a shape tween different from a motion tween?
5 What is a mask, and how do you create one?
6 How do you see the effects of a mask?
Review Answers
1 A shape tween creates smooth transitions between keyframes containing
different shapes. To apply a shape tween, create different shapes in an initial
keyframe and in a final keyframe. Then, select any frame between the
keyframes in the Timeline, right-click, and select Create Shape Tween.
2 Shape hints are labeled markers that indicate how one point on the initial
shape of a shape tween will map to a corresponding point on the final shape.
Shape hints help refine the way the shapes will morph. To use shape hints,
first select the initial keyframe of a shape tween. Choose Modify > Shape >
Add Shape Hint. Move the first shape hint to the edge of the shape. Move the
playhead to the final keyframe, and move the corresponding shape hint to a
matching edge of the shape.
3 By default, Animate shows the onion skins in previous frames in blue and the
onion skins in future frames in green. The onion skin in the currently selected
frame is in red. The colors can be customized in the Preferences panel.
4 A shape tween uses shapes, whereas a motion tween uses symbol instances. A
shape tween smoothly interpolates the change of stroke or fill of a shape
between two keyframes. A motion tween smoothly interpolates the changes in
location, scale, rotation, color effect, or filter effect of a symbol instance
between two keyframes.
5 Masking is a way of selectively hiding and displaying content on a layer. In
Animate, you put a mask on the top mask layer and the content in the layer
below it, which is called the masked layer. Both the mask and the masked
layers can be animated.
6 To see the effects of the mask layer on the masked layer, you must lock both
layers, or test your movie with Control > Test.

9. Natural and Character Animation
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Use the Bone tool to build armatures (skeletons) of movie clips
Use the Bone tool to build armatures of shapes
Animate natural motion of armatures using inverse kinematics
Constrain and pin the armature joints
Edit the position of armature bones and joints
Refine shape deformations with the Bind tool
Simulate physics with the Spring feature
Adjust the speed setting to add a sense of weight to armatures
This lesson will take about one and a half hours to complete. Please log in
to your account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this
chapter, or go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book
and follow the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web
Edition.”

You can easily create complex and natural motion with articulations—joints
between linked objects and within shapes—by using the Bone tool for
animation in a process called inverse kinematics.
Getting Started
You’ll start the lesson by viewing the animated walking monkey that you’ll
create as you learn about natural motion in Adobe Animate CC.
1. Double-click the 09End.html file in the Lesson09/09End folder to play

the animation.
The animation depicts a cartoon monkey walking in an endless cycle
with a scrolling motion in the background. His arms and legs swing
naturally, and his tail curls and unfurls naturally and smoothly. In this
lesson, you’ll build the armature (a skeleton) that controls the monkey
and all his limbs, and then animate his walk cycle.
2. Double-click the 09Start.fla file in the Lesson09/09Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate.
3. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 09_workingcopy.fla, and save it
in the 09Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original
start file will be available if you want to start over.
Natural Motion and Character Animation with Inverse
Kinematics
When you want to animate the natural motion of an articulated object (one that
has multiple joints), such as a walking person or, as in this example, a walking
monkey, Animate CC makes it easy to do so with inverse kinematics. Inverse

kinematics is a mathematical way of calculating the different angles of a jointed
object to achieve a certain configuration. You can pose your object in a
beginning keyframe and then set a different pose at a later keyframe. Animate
will use inverse kinematics to figure out the different angles for all the joints to
smoothly get from the first pose to the next.
Inverse kinematics makes animating easy because you don’t have to worry about
animating each segment of an object or limb of a character. You just focus on the
overall poses, and Animate will take care of the rest.
Building your first armature to animate a character
When animating a clearly articulated object (a character with limbs and joints),
first determine which pieces of the character need to move. At the same time,
examine how those pieces connect and move. This will almost always be a
hierarchical structure, like a tree, starting from a root and branching out in
various ways. This structure is called the armature, and, as with a real skeleton,
each rigid piece that makes up the armature is called a bone. The armature
defines where your fig09-002.jpgobject can bend and how the different bones
are connected.
You use the Bone tool (
) to create your armature. The Bone tool tells
Animate how a series of movie clip instances are connected, or provides the
jointed structure within a shape. A connection between two or more bones is
called a joint.
1. In your 09working_copy.fla file, open the Library panel and view the
graphics for the monkey character, which have already been created and
imported for you.

2. Drag all the pieces of the monkey from the Library panel onto the Stage,
and drag two instances each of the foot, hand, leg, lower leg, arm 1, and
arm 2. Arrange them so you have the different segments in roughly the
arrangement you need to form the whole body (with head, body, pelvis,
two arms, and two legs). For the back arm, use the Free Transform tool
to rotate all three of the pieces (arm 1, arm 2, and hand) 180 degrees.

Keeping some space between the pieces will make connecting the bones
for your armature easier. Don’t worry about getting the pieces looking
exactly right, because you’ll move them together in a later step.
3. Select the Bone tool.
4. Click the middle of the monkey’s chest, and drag with the Bone tool to
the top of his left upper arm. Release the mouse button.

Your first bone is defined. Animate shows the bone as a straight line
with a square at its base joint and a circle at its tip joint. Each bone is
defined from one joint to the next.
The following shows the bones and their relationship to each other
without the full rendering of the movie clips (with Show All Layers As
Outlines enabled).
5. Now drag from the end of your first bone (at the monkey’s shoulder) to
the top of his lower arm (his elbow). Release the mouse button.

Your second bone is defined.
6. Drag from the end of your second bone to the base of the monkey’s
hand. Release the mouse button.
Your third bone is defined. Note that the four movie clip instances,
which are now connected with bones, have been moved to a new layer
with a new icon and the default name Armature_#. This special type of
layer keeps your armatures separate from other objects on the Timeline,
such as graphics or motion tweens.
7. Select the Selection tool and experiment with grabbing the last bone in
the chain (the monkey’s hand) and moving it up and down the Stage.

Because the bones connect the whole arm, moving the hand causes the
forearm and the upper arm to move as well.
 Note
The first armature layer created in a pristine file will be
called “Armature_1,” and each time you add a new
armature layer its name will be incremented by one. Don’t
worry if the name of your armature layer doesn’t match the
one in these screenshots.
Extending your armature
You’ll continue to build out the armature of the monkey by connecting his other
arm, head and pelvis, and legs.
1. Using the Bone tool, drag from the base of your very first bone (in the
monkey’s chest) to the top of his other upper arm. The first bone is
considered your “root bone.” Release the mouse button.
2. Continue creating more bones to the base of the other hand.
Your armature now extends out in two directions: one for the monkey’s
left arm and one for his right.

3. Drag from the base of your very first bone (in the monkey’s chest) to the
middle of the pelvis.
4. Extend the armature from the pelvis down to both of the monkey’s
lower legs. The pelvis will branch off to the right and left thighs, lower
legs, and feet.
5. Lastly, connect the torso to the monkey’s head.
Your armature now connects all the pieces of the monkey, defining how
each piece can rotate and move in relation to the other pieces in the
armature.
Armature hierarchy
The first bone of an armature is the root bone and the parent of the

child bones linked to it. A bone can have more than one child
attached to it, as you have for your monkey armature, making for a
very complex relationship. The bone in the chest is the parent, each
bone to the upper arm is a child, and the arms are siblings to each
other. As your armature becomes more complicated, you can use the
Properties panel to navigate up and down the hierarchy using these
relationships.
When you select a bone in an armature, the top of the Properties
panel displays a series of arrows.
You can click the arrows to move through the hierarchy and quickly
select and view the properties of each bone. If the parent bone is
selected, you can click the down arrow to select the child. If a child
bone is selected, you can click the up arrow to select its parent, or
click the down arrow to select its own child if it has one. The
sideways arrows navigate between sibling bones.
Moving the bones of the armature
Now that you’ve connected each of the movie clips with your bones in a
complete armature, you can edit each bone’s relative position. You initially
placed them with gaps between the bones to make connecting them easier.
Holding down the Alt/Option key allows you to move the position of any bone
in your armature.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Hold down the Alt/Option key and move the monkey’s left upper arm
closer to his body. You can also use the Free Transform tool.

The upper arm is repositioned, but the armature remains intact.
3. Hold down the Alt/Option key and move all the parts of the monkey’s
body closer together to eliminate the gaps in his joints.
The monkey and its armature should look similar to the following
figure.

Removing and adding bones and movie clips
To remove a movie clip, select it on the Stage and press
Backspace/Delete. The movie clip and its associated bone will be
removed.
If you want to add more movie clips to your armature, drag new
movie clip instances onto the Stage in a different layer. You cannot
add new objects to an armature layer. Once it’s on the Stage, you
can use the Bone tool to connect the added instance to the bones of
your existing armature. The new instance will be moved to the same
layer as the armature.
Modifying the position of the joint

If you want to change the point where one bone connects to another—the joint—
use the Free Transform tool to move its transformation point. This also moves
the rotation point of the bone.
If, for example, you made a mistake and attached the end point of your bone to
the middle of the monkey’s hand rather than to the base, his hand would rotate
unnaturally.
1. To modify the position of the joint, select the Free Transform tool and
click the hand to select it. Move the transformation point to the base of
the hand.

2. The bone now connects to the new transformation point of the movie
clip, and as a result, the hand rotates around the wrist.

Rearranging the stacking order
When you build an armature, the most recent bone will move to the top of stack
in your graphics. Depending on the order in which you connected your bones,
the individual movie clips may not overlap correctly. For example, in the
previous task, the monkey’s feet and legs may not overlap in a way that makes
sense. One leg should be behind his pelvis, and one leg should be in front. Use
the Modify > Arrange command to change the stacking order of the movie clips
in your armature so that they overlap each other correctly.
1. Select the Selection tool and Shift-select the three movie clips that make
up the monkey’s back leg.
2. Choose Modify > Arrange > Send To Back, or right-click and select
Arrange > Send To Back (Shift+Ctrl+Down/Shift+Command+Down).
The selected bones of the armature move to the bottom of the stacking
order, so his right leg is now behind all the other pieces of his body.
3. Select the three clips that compose the monkey’s right arm, and use the
Modify > Arrange command to move his right arm behind the body.
4. Select the three pieces of the monkey’s left arm and choose Modify >

Arrange > Bring To Front, or right-click and choose Arrange > Bring To
Front (Shift+Ctrl+Up/Shift+Command+Up).
The selected bones of the armature move to the top of the stacking order,
so his left arm is now above all the other pieces of his body.
5. You may need to move individual bones forward or backward so they
overlap correctly. For example, in the monkey’s leg, his pants and shoes
should overlap his lower leg.
6. Select the Selection tool and move the armature around to see how the
right and left arms and legs of the monkey move behind or in front of
his body, and make any corrections, if needed.
 Note
Use Modify > Arrange > Send To Back to move selected
graphics all the way to the bottom of the stacking order, or
use Modify > Arrange > Send Backward to move the
selected graphics just one level back. Similarly, use Bring

To Front to move graphics to the top of the stacking order,
or use Bring Forward to move graphics just one level up.
Creating a Walk Cycle
A walk cycle is a basic looping animation showing a character walking. Not only
are the swinging arms and legs coordinated, but for the most convincing walk
cycles, the body and head are also animated for the subtle bobbing motion that
provides the sense of weight. Walk cycles can be enormously complicated
(deceptively so) but can imbue a character with a lot of personality.
Armatures help make creating a walk cycle easier because you can move the
character’s limbs in place to define the key poses in the cycle. Think of poses as
keyframes for the animation. In the next task, you’ll create a simple walk cycle
defined with four poses.
Posing your armature
You have an initial pose for your monkey in frame 1. You will insert three
additional poses for the monkey to create a basic walk cycle. The fifth pose will
be a duplicate of the very first pose, so when the animation loops, the cycle will
be seamless. The four basic poses are summarized in the following diagram:
Graphic by Ajaykarat at English Wikipedia CC BY 3.0
In the first pose, the foreground leg is forward and the background leg is back. In
the second pose, the legs pass each other. In the third pose, the background leg is
forward and the foreground leg is back. In the fourth pose, the legs pass each
other again. The arms swing in the opposite direction from the legs.

1. Using the Selection tool, drag the monkey’s left foot and move it behind
him. Try to keep his foot flat on the ground, which will help him look
like he’s pushing the ground rather than bicycling in the air.
As you drag his foot, the bones that are connected to it also move. You
may also have to drag his thigh or his lower leg to get the position of the
armature just right. If you have trouble controlling the armature, don’t
worry! It takes practice, and in the following sections, you’ll learn more
tips and tricks to constrain or isolate certain joints for precise
positioning.
2. Move the monkey’s right foot so that it is stepping forward.
3. Move the monkey’s left arm forward and his right arm behind him.
Your first pose is completed in frame 1 of your armature layer.
Isolating the rotation of individual bones

As you pull and push on the armature to create your pose, you may find it
difficult to control the rotation of individual bones because of their linkages.
Holding down the Shift key as you move individual bones will isolate their
rotation.
1. Select the monkey’s left hand.
2. With the Selection tool, drag the hand.
The whole arm moves to follow the motion of the hand.
3. Now, holding down the Shift key, drag the monkey’s hand.
The hand rotates around the wrist, but the rest of the arm doesn’t move.
The Shift key isolates the rotation of the selected bone.
Holding down the Shift key helps you isolate the rotations of individual
bones so that you can position your poses exactly as you want them.
Return to the monkey’s legs and arms to make any necessary
adjustments using the Shift key.
Pinning individual bones
Another way you can more precisely control the rotation or position of your
armature is to fix individual bones in place, leaving the child bones free to move
in a different pose. You do this by using the Pin option in the Properties panel.
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Select the bone in the monkey’s right thigh.
The bone becomes highlighted, indicating that it is selected.

3. In the Properties panel, select the Pin option.
The tail, or the end that connects to the child bone, is fixed to the Stage
in the current position. A white circle with a black dot appears on the
joint to indicate that it is pinned.
4. Drag the last bone (the foot) in the monkey’s leg.

Only the last two bones move. Note how the armature motion is
different when using the Pin option versus using the Shift key. The Shift
key isolates an individual bone and all the rest of the bones connected to
it. When you pin a bone, the pinned bone remains fixed, but you’re free
to move all the child bones. Unpin the bone to continue this lesson.
 Tip
You can also select a bone and click its tail when your
cursor changes to the icon of a pushpin. That selected bone
will be pinned. Click again to unpin the bone.
Disabling and Constraining Joints
Before you insert the rest of the poses, you can add refinements to your armature
that will make it easier to position the monkey’s limbs. The various joints of the
monkey can freely rotate, which isn’t particularly realistic, particularly in his
pelvis. Many armatures in real life are constrained to certain angles of rotation.
For example, your forearm can rotate up toward your bicep, but it can’t rotate in
the other direction beyond your bicep. Your hips can wiggle around your torso,

but not by very much. These are constraints that you can also impose on your
own armature. When working with armatures in Animate CC, you can choose to
constrain the rotation for various joints or even constrain the translation
(movement) of the various joints.
Disabling the rotation of joints
If you drag the monkey’s pelvis, you’ll see that the bone that connects the torso
with the pelvis can rotate freely, which allows wildly unrealistic positions.
1. Select the bone that connects the monkey’s torso with his pelvis.
The bone is highlighted.

2. In the Properties panel, deselect the Enable option in the Joint: Rotation
section.
The circle around the joint at the head of the selected bone disappears,
which means that the joint is no longer able to rotate.

3. Now drag the pelvis.
The pelvis can no longer rotate around the joint in the torso.

Constraining the range of rotation
There’s still some work to do with the monkey’s pelvis. Although it can’t freely
rotate around the joint in the monkey’s torso, it can still rotate around the child
joint 360 degrees. You can constrain that range of rotation.
1. Click one of the bones that connect the monkey’s pelvis with one of his
legs to select it.
The bone becomes highlighted.
2. In the Properties panel, select the Constrain option in the Joint: Rotation
section.
The angle indicator changes from a full circle to a partial circle on the
joint, showing the minimum and maximum allowable angles and the
current position of the bone.
3. In the Properties panel, set the Left Offset rotation angle to –6 degrees
and the Right Offset rotation angle to 6 degrees.

4. Drag the pelvis.
You can move the pelvis, but its rotation is constrained to only a few
degrees clockwise and a few degrees counterclockwise, preventing your
armature from being in unrealistic positions and making it much easier
to control and position your poses.
Constraining the translation of joints
In real life, joints allow only rotation of bones. However, in Animate CC, you
can allow joints to actually slide in either the x (horizontal) or the y (vertical)
direction, and you can set limits on how far those joints can travel.
In this example, you’ll allow the joint in the pelvis to move up and down. This
will give the armature some degree of motion so that you can create a slight
bobbing action.
1. If it’s not already selected, click the same bone that you selected to
constrain rotation in the previous task.
2. In the Properties panel, select Enable in the Joint: Y Translation section.
Arrows appear from the joint, indicating that the joint can travel in the
up and down directions.

3. Select the Constrain option in the Joint: Y Translation section of the
Properties panel.
The arrowheads on the joint turn into T shapes (straight lines), indicating
that the translation is limited.
4. Set Top Offset to –6 and Bottom Offset to 6.
The bars on the joint shorten to indicate how much translation in the y
direction the pelvis can do.
5. Grab the pelvis of the monkey and try to move it around.
The constraints on joint rotation and joint translation impose limits on
the poses that help you create more realistic animations. The pelvis can
now move slightly up and down as well as rock back and forth in a
limited fashion.
Using on-Stage controls for joint constraints

You can make quick adjustments to any joint rotation or translation
constraints by just using the on-Stage controls that appear over joints,
rather than making those adjustments in the Properties panel. Using the on-
Stage controls lets you see the constraints in context with the other bones
and graphics on the Stage.
Simply select a bone and move your mouse pointer over the joint in the
head of the bone. A circle with four arrowheads highlights in blue. Click it
to access the on-Stage controls.
To change the constraints for rotation, move your mouse over the outer
edge of the circle, which will highlight in red, and click it.

Click inside the circle to define the minimum and maximum angles for the
joint rotation. The shaded area is the range of permissible rotation. You
can also drag to change the angles within the circle. Click outside the
circle to confirm your adjustments.
If you want to disable the rotation at that joint, click the lock icon that
appears when you roll over the center of the circle.
To change the constraints for translation (movement up and down or side

to side), move your mouse over the arrows inside the circle, which will
highlight in red.
Click either the horizontal or vertical arrows, and then drag the offsets to
constrain the translation of the joint in either direction.
Adding Poses
Your armature is now ready. You’ve connected your bones and made the
appropriate constraints to make it easier to pose. In the Timeline, you insert
poses just as you would insert keyframes for a motion tween.
Inserting poses
Recall that your goal is to define four unique poses that will allow a natural walk
cycle.
1. On the Timeline, select frame 10 and choose Insert > Timeline >
Keyframe, or right-click and choose Insert Pose.
A new pose/keyframe is inserted at frame 10. The pose in the first
keyframe is copied and pasted into the second keyframe.
 Note
When dealing with armature layers, “poses” and
“keyframes” are essentially the same thing.

2. Move the arms and legs of your monkey armature so they are passing
each other. The leg that is moving forward should have its knee rising
and its foot off the ground.
3. On the Timeline, select frame 20 and insert a third keyframe.
4. Move the arms and legs of your monkey armature so that the left leg
and right arm are forward and the right leg and left arm are back, the
opposite of the pose in frame 1.

5. Add a fourth keyframe/pose in frame 30 with the legs and arms passing
each other.
6. Select frame 40 and insert additional frames to extend the Timeline.
7. Hold down the Alt/Option key and drag the first keyframe (in frame 1)
to frame 40.
The keyframe containing the pose in frame 1 is duplicated in keyframe
40. Now that first and last keyframes are identical, the animation can

loop seamlessly.
8. The first four keyframes should look similar to this figure, but feel free
to experiment and give your monkey a personality of its own! Getting
his feet, arms, and body coordinated may take a lot of little adjustments
and refinements.
 Tip
You can edit poses on the Timeline just as you can with
keyframes of a motion tween. Right-click along the
Timeline and choose Insert Pose to insert a new pose.
Right-click any pose and select Clear Pose to remove the
pose from the layer. Ctrl-click/Command-click a pose to
select it. Drag the pose to move it to a different position
along the Timeline.
9. Select Loop Playback at the bottom of the Timeline
(Shift+Alt+L/Shift+Option+L), and extend the markers to cover the
entire animation span from frame 1 to frame 40.

 Tip
You can add eases to your inverse kinematics animations by
selecting the animation on the Timeline and choosing an
Ease Type and Strength in the Properties panel. Eases can
change the animation by starting slowly (ease-in) or by
ending gradually (ease-out).
10. Click the Play button at the bottom of the Timeline (Enter/Return key)
to view your animation loop.
The animation won’t be perfect, but you can see, once your armature is
complete, how easy and fun it is to create different poses and natural,
complex motions.
 Tip
Add more nuance to your walk cycle to create even more
realism! Tilt the monkey’s head just slightly in some of the
poses and see how a little head bob can make his walk a
little more natural.
Changing joint speed
Joint speed refers to the stickiness, or stiffness, of a joint. A joint with a
low joint speed value will be sluggish. A joint with a high joint speed
value will be more responsive. You can set the joint speed value for any
selected joint in the Properties panel.
The joint speed is apparent when you drag the very end of an armature. If
there are slow joints higher up on the armature chain, those particular
joints will be less responsive and will rotate to a lesser degree than the
others.

To change the joint speed, click a bone to select it. In the Properties panel,
set the Speed value from 0% to 100%.
The joint speed doesn’t affect the actual animation; it only affects how the
armature responds to the way you pose it on the Stage, making it easier to
move.
Inverse Kinematics with Shapes
The monkey is an armature made with various movie clip symbols. You can also
create armatures with shapes, which are useful for animating objects without
obvious joints and segments but that still have an articulated motion. For
example, the arms of an octopus have no actual joints, but you can add bones to
a smooth tentacle to animate its undulating motion. You can also animate other
organic objects, such as a snake, a waving flag, leaves of grass bending in the
wind, or, in the next task, a monkey’s tail.
Defining bones inside a shape
You’ll create a tail, add a series of bones to it, animate it curling and unfurling,
and add it to your monkey walk cycle.
1. Choose Insert > New Symbol (Ctrl+F8/Command+F8). In the Create
New Symbol dialog box, choose Movie Clip for the symbol and enter
monkey_tail for the symbol name.

2. Click OK.
Animate creates a new symbol and puts you into symbol-editing mode
for that symbol.
3. Select the Rectangle tool.
4. Select a light brown fill color (#8B4B0E) and a 2-point black stroke,
and create a long, thin rectangle about 350 pixels wide and 20 pixels
tall.
5. Select the Selection tool and reshape the right end of the rectangle to
create a smooth, rounded end for the monkey’s tail.
6. Select the Bone tool.
7. Starting from the left side of the rectangular shape, drag a bone inside
the tail just a fraction of the way.
Animate creates an armature of your rectangular shape and moves it to
its own armature layer.

8. Click the end of the first bone and drag out the next bone a little farther
down toward the tip of the tail.
The second bone is defined.
9. Continue building the tail armature with a total of six or seven bones.
10. When the armature is complete, use the Selection tool to drag the last
bone to see how the deformation of the tail follows the bones of the
armature.
Animating the tail
Animating an armature within a shape follows the same process as animating an
armature build with movie clips. You establish different poses for your armature

with keyframes along the Timeline.
1. Select frame 60 on the Timeline in the monkey_tail movie clip symbol
and choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5).
Animate adds frames up to frame 60 on the Timeline.
2. In the first frame, move your monkey tail armature so that the tip of the
tail lies flat on the ground.
3. Select frame 20.
4. Choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
Animate inserts a new keyframe at frame 20 with the same pose that is
in frame 1.
5. Select frame 30.
6. Move the armature so that the monkey’s tail curls upward.

Animate automatically inserts a keyframe at frame 30 with the new
pose. The monkey’s tail remains flat from frames 1 through 20. After
frame 20, the tail will begin to curl until it reaches the pose at frame 30.
7. Select frame 50 and insert a new keyframe (F6).
8. Click to select the keyframe in frame 1. Hold down the Alt/Option key
and drag the keyframe in frame 1 to frame 60.
Animate duplicates the first keyframe to frame 60. Your Timeline should
now have five keyframes. The first, second, and fifth keyframes should
have the tail flat. The third and fourth keyframes should have the tail
curled.
9. Play the animation as a loop.
The monkey’s tail curls and unfurls repeatedly across 60 frames.
Combining the tail and the walk cycle

Since the tail animation plays longer than the monkey walk cycle (which is 40
frames), when you combine the animations, the movements won’t be in
synchrony, providing a more irregular and organic cycle.
1. Return to the main Stage.
2. Rename the empty layer tail and make sure it’s under the Armature
layer. Add enough frames in the tail layer to match the walk cycle (40
frames).
3. Drag an instance of the monkey_tail movie clip symbol from the library
to the Stage, placing the base of the tail behind the monkey’s body.
4. Test your animation (Control > Test Movie > In Browser).

Animate exports the necessary files to play the animation with HTML
and JavaScript in a browser. The monkey walks continuously while the
movie clip animation of his tail curls.
Editing the shape
You don’t need any special tools to edit a shape that contains bones. Many of the
same drawing and editing tools in the Tools panel—such as the Paint Bucket, Ink
Bottle, and Subselection tools—are available to you to edit the fill, the stroke, or
the contours.
1. Use the Paint Bucket tool to change the fill color of an armature shape.
2. Use the Ink Bottle tool to change the stroke color or style of an armature
shape.
3. Select the Subselection tool and click the outline of the armature shape.

The anchor points and the control handles appear around the contour of
the shape, allowing you to drag the anchor points to new locations or
drag the handles to change the curvatures.
 Note
The organic control of a shape by its armature is a result of
the mapping between the anchor points along the shape and
its bones. You can edit the connections between the bones
and their control points and refine the behavior with the
Bind tool. The Bind tool is grouped under the Bone tool.
Consult the Animate Help documentation for more
information on how to use this advanced tool.
4. Select the Add Anchor Point tool and click the outline of the armature
shape to add new anchor points.
5. Select the Delete Anchor Point tool and click the outline of the armature
shape to remove anchor points.
Adding the background
Your monkey stays in one spot on the Stage, so to make the illusion complete,
add a scrolling background to make it seem like he’s really taking a stroll.
1. Insert a new layer on the main Timeline and name it background.

2. Move the new background layer to the bottom of the other layers.
3. A scrolling background movie clip is already provided in the library.
The movie clip is called background, and it depicts a sidewalk moving
from left to right by using shape tweens of line segments.
4. Drag an instance of the background movie clip on the Stage into the
bottom layer. Place the instance at approximately x=–170 and y=620.
5. Choose Control > Movie > In Browser.

Animate opens your browser to display your movie. Your monkey
animation is complete!
Simulating Physics with Springiness
So far, you’ve seen how armatures can help you easily pose your characters and
objects in different keyframes to create smooth, natural motion. But you can also
add a bit of physics to your armatures so that they react to how they move from
pose to pose. The Spring feature helps you do this easily.
Spring simulates physics in any animated armature, whether you’re using movie
clips or a shape. A flexible object would normally have some “springiness” that
would cause it to jiggle on its own as it moves, and continue to jiggle even after
the motion of the entire body stops. The amount of springiness depends on the
object—for example, a dangling rope would have a lot of jiggle, but a diving
board would be much stiffer and have less jiggle. You can set the strength of the
spring depending on your object, and you can even set different springiness
amounts for each bone in an armature to help you get an exact amount of rigidity
or flexibility in your animation. In a tree, for example, the larger branches will
be less springy than the smaller end branches.

Define bones for your armature
In the following steps, you’ll animate a leaf being blown by the wind. The first
step for any inverse kinematics animation is to build the armature with the Bone
tool.
1. Open the file 07_IK_spring_start.fla.
2. On the Stage you will see a simple shape of a leaf and its stem.
3. Select the Bone tool.
4. Starting inside the leaf shape at the base of the stem, drag to the base of
the leaf to create the first bone.
The first bone is defined. The contents of the current layer are separated
onto a new armature layer.
5. Starting from the end of the first bone, drag a little farther down the leaf

to create the next bone.
6. Continue creating more bones to extend the armature to the tip of the
leaf. Your completed armature should have about four bones.
Setting the spring strength for each bone
Next, you’ll set the Strength value for the spring for each bone. The Strength
value can range from 0 (no spring) to 100 (maximum spring).
1. Select the last bone (at the tip of the leaf) of the armature.
2. In the Properties panel, in the Spring section, enter 100 for the Strength.

The last bone has the maximum spring strength since the tip is the most
flexible part of the whole armature and would have the most
independent motion.
3. Select the next bone in the armature. You can simply click it on the
Stage or you can navigate up the armature hierarchy with the arrows in
the Properties panel.
4. In the Properties panel, in the Spring section, enter 80 for the Strength.
The middle of the leaf is a little less flexible than the tip, so it has a
smaller Strength value.
5. Select the next adjacent bone, and in the Properties panel, in the Spring
section, enter 60 for the Strength.
The base of the leaf is even less flexible than the middle, so it has an
even smaller Strength value.
Insert the next pose
Next, you’ll create a new pose of the leaf in a downward position and Animate

will use the spring values to add wiggling, fluttering, and other internal motions.
1. Select frame 90 on the Timeline and choose Insert > Timeline > Frame
(F5) to add frames to the Timeline.
2. Select frame 20 of the Armature layer, which contains your leaf.
3. Grab the bone at the tip of the leaf and pull it downward as if the wind
had blown on the leaf.
A new pose is created in frame 20.
4. Return the playhead to frame 1 and play the animation (Enter/Return).
The leaf moves downward from the first pose to the second, but even
past the second keyframe the leaf continues to bend and sway slightly.
The back and forth rotation of the leaf armature, combined with the
addition of springiness to the bones, simulates the responses to physical
forces within an actual leaf stem and makes the animation more realistic.
Features like Spring and Damping (which you’ll learn about next) make
it much simpler to animate complicated natural motions in Animate.
 Note
The effects of the Spring feature are more apparent when

there are additional frames on the Timeline after the
armature’s final pose, as in this lesson. The additional
frames allow you to see the residual bouncing effect after
the last pose.
Adding damping effects
Damping refers to how much the spring effect decreases with time. It wouldn’t
be realistic if the swaying of the leaf continued indefinitely. Over time, the
swaying should lessen and eventually stop. You can set a Damping value for
each bone from 0 (no damping) to 100 (maximum damping) to control how
rapidly these effects diminish.
1. Select the last bone of the leaf (at the tip), and in the Properties panel, in
the Spring section, enter 50 for the Damping value.
The Damping value will decrease the rocking of the leaf over time.
2. Select the next bone in the armature (in the middle of the leaf), and in
the Properties panel enter the maximum value (100) for Damping.
3. Select the next bone in the armature (at the base of the leaf), and in the
Properties panel enter the maximum value (100) for Damping.
4. Choose Control > Test Movie > In Animate to see the effects that the
Damping values have on the motion of your leaf.
The leaf still sways, but the motion quickly subsides. The Damping
values help add a sense of weight to the armature. Experiment with both
the Strength and Damping values in the Spring section of your armature
to get the most realistic motion.
Review Questions
1 What are the two ways of using the Bone tool?
2 Define and differentiate these terms: bone, joint, and armature.
3 What is the hierarchy of the armature?
4 How do you constrain or disable the rotation of joints?
5 What do strength and damping refer to in the Spring feature?

Review Answers
1 The Bone tool can connect movie clip instances to form an articulated object
that can be posed and animated with inverse kinematics. The Bone tool can
also create an armature within a shape, which can be posed and animated with
inverse kinematics as well.
2 Bones are the objects that connect individual movie clips or that make up the
internal structure of a shape for motion with inverse kinematics. Joints are the
articulations between bones; joints can rotate as well as translate (slide in both
the x and y directions). Armatures are the complete articulated objects.
Armatures are separated onto their own special armature layers on the
Timeline, where poses can be inserted for animation.
3 An armature is made up of bones that are ordered in a hierarchy. When a bone
is connected to another, one is the parent and the other is the child. When a
parent bone has many child bones, the child bones can be described as siblings
to each other.
4 Hold down the Shift key to temporarily disable the motion of the armature and
isolate a single bone’s rotation. Use the Properties panel to pin a bone to
prevent it from rotating, or deselect the Enable option in the Rotation section
of the Properties panel to disable a particular joint’s rotation.
5 Strength is the amount of springiness of any individual bone in an armature.
Add springiness with the Spring feature to simulate the way different parts of
a flexible object jiggle when the entire object moves and continue to jiggle
when the object stops. Damping refers to how quickly the springiness effect
subsides over time.

This lesson will take about two hours to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.”

Let your viewers explore your project and become active participants. Button
symbols and code work together to create engaging, user-driven interactive
experiences.
Getting Started
To begin, view the interactive restaurant guide that you’ll create as you learn to
make interactive projects in Adobe Animate CC.
1. Double-click the 10End.fla file in the Lesson10/10End folder to open
the animation in Animate. Choose Control > Test to see the final
project.
The project opens in your default browser. You can ignore any warnings
that appear in the Output panel.

The project is an imaginary city’s interactive restaurant guide that runs
in the browser. Viewers can click any button to see more information
about a particular restaurant. In this lesson, you’ll be working in an
HTML5 Canvas document to create interactive buttons and structure the
Timeline properly. You’ll learn to add JavaScript code to provide
instructions for what each button will do.
 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this
lesson to your computer from your Account page, make
sure to do so now. See “Getting Started” at the beginning of
the book.
 Note
This project contains buttons and bitmaps that may generate
security errors when you try to play the HTML file locally.
Your browser may be blank or simply show a static picture
when you double-click the HTML file to open it in a
browser. Upload all required files to your server (see
Lesson 12), or test the movie within Animate.
2. Close the 10End.fla file.

3. Double-click the 10Start.fla file in the Lesson10/10Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate. The file is an HTML5 Canvas
document that will play in a browser. The document includes several
assets already in the Library panel, and the Stage has already been sized
properly.
4. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 10_workingcopy.fla and save it
in the 10Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original
start file will be available if you want to start over.
 Note
Animate may warn you if your computer doesn’t have the
same fonts contained in a FLA file. Choose substitute fonts,

or simply click Use Default to have Animate automatically
make the substitutions.
About Interactive Movies
Interactive movies change based on the viewer’s actions. For example, when the
viewer clicks a button, a different graphic with more information is displayed.
Interactivity can be simple, such as a button click, or it can be complex,
receiving inputs from a variety of sources, such as the movements of the mouse,
keystrokes from the keyboard, or even the tilting of a mobile device.
ActionScript and JavaScript
In Animate, you add interactivity with either ActionScript 3.0 or JavaScript,
depending on the kind of document you’re working in.
If you’re working in an ActionScript 3.0, AIR for Desktop, or AIR for iOS or
Android document, you use ActionScript to achieve interactivity. ActionScript
provides the instructions that enable an animation to respond to the user. Those
instructions could be to play a sound, skip to a keyframe on the Timeline where
new graphics appear, or make a calculation.
In an HTML5 Canvas or WebGL document, you use JavaScript, the same code
that drives interactivity for web pages in a browser.
While ActionScript 3.0 and JavaScript are very similar (in fact, both are based
on an ECMA coding language standard), ActionScript contains language that
controls Animate-specific features, and JavaScript contains language that
controls browser-specific features such as scrolling and HTML elements on the
page.
In this lesson, you’ll use JavaScript in an HTML5 Canvas document to learn to
create a nonlinear navigation—one in which the movie doesn’t have to play
straight from the beginning of the Timeline to the end. You’ll add JavaScript to
tell the Animate playhead to jump around and go to different frames of the
Timeline based on which button the user clicks. Different frames on the Timeline
contain different content. The user doesn’t actually know that the playhead is
jumping around the Timeline; the user just sees (or hears) different content
appear as the buttons are clicked on the Stage.
Don’t worry if you don’t think you’re good at programming! You don’t have to
be a code ninja, because Animate provides an easy-to-use menu-driven wizard in
the Actions panel that allows you to add JavaScript quickly and simply.

Creating Buttons
A button is a basic visual indicator of something the user can interact with. The
user often clicks a button with the mouse or taps a button with their finger, but
many other types of interactions are possible. For example, something can
happen when the user rolls the mouse pointer over a button.
A button is a kind of symbol that has four special states, or keyframes, that
determine how the button appears. Buttons can look like virtually anything—an
image, a graphic, or a bit of text. They don’t have to be those typical pill-shaped
gray rectangles that you see on many websites.
Creating a button symbol
In this lesson, you’ll create buttons with small thumbnail images and restaurant
names. A button symbol’s four special states are represented on the button’s
timeline as frames, just like on the main Timeline. The four frames include the
following:
The Up state shows the button as it appears when the mouse is not
interacting with it.
The Over state shows the button as it appears when the mouse cursor is
hovering over it.
The Down state shows the button as it appears when the mouse cursor is
hovering over it and the mouse button is depressed.
The Hit state indicates the clickable area of the button.
You’ll understand the relationship between these states and the button
appearance as you work through this exercise.
1. Choose Insert > New Symbol.
2. In the Create New Symbol dialog box, choose Button from the Type
menu and name the symbol gabel loffel button. Click OK.
Animate puts you in symbol-editing mode for your new button.

3. In the Library panel, expand the restaurant thumbnails folder and drag
the graphic symbol gabel loffel thumbnail to the middle of the Stage.
4. In the Properties panel, set the X value to 0 and the Y value to 0.
The upper-left corner of the small gabel loffel restaurant image is now
aligned to the registration point of the symbol (marked by the small
cross in the center of the screen).
5. Select the Hit frame in the Timeline and choose Insert > Timeline >
Frame to extend the Timeline.
The gabel loffel image now extends through the Up, Over, Down, and
Hit states.
6. Insert a new layer. The new layer will accommodate an image that

appears when the user’s mouse cursor hovers over the button.
7. In the new layer, select the Over frame and choose Insert > Timeline >
Keyframe.
Animate inserts a new keyframe in the Over state of the top layer.
8. In the Library panel, expand the restaurant previews folder, and drag the
“gabel loffel over info” movie clip symbol onto the Stage.
9. Move the move clip symbol until it’s over the lower part of the button.
When guides appear along the bottom and side of the object, let it snap
into place. In the Properties panel, the Position and Size section should
show approximately X=0 and Y=217.
The gray information box will appear over the restaurant image
whenever the mouse cursor rolls over the button.
10. Insert a third layer above the first two.

We’ll use this layer to bind a sound file to the Down state so that the
button will make a click sound when it’s depressed.
11. Select the Down frame on the new layer and choose Insert > Timeline >
Keyframe.
A new keyframe is inserted in the Down state of the new layer.
12. Drag the sound file called clicksound.mp3 from the Library panel to the
Stage.
The beginning of the sound’s waveform (appearing as a straight line)
appears in the Down keyframe of the top layer of your button symbol.
13. Select the Down keyframe where the waveform appears, and in the
Sound section of the Properties panel, note that Event is chosen in the

Sync menu.
 Note
You’ll learn more about sound in Lesson 11.
A clicking sound will play only when a viewer depresses the button.
14. Click Scene 1 in the Edit bar above the Stage to exit symbol-editing
mode and return to the main Timeline. Your first button symbol is
complete! Look in your Library panel to see the new button symbol
stored there.

Invisible buttons and the Hit keyframe
Your button symbol’s Hit keyframe indicates the area that is “hot,”
or clickable by the user. Normally, the Hit keyframe contains a
shape that is the same size and location as the shape in your Up
keyframe. In most cases, you want the graphics that users see to be
in the same area where they click. However, in certain advanced
applications, you may want the Hit keyframe and the Up keyframe
to be different. If your Up keyframe is empty, the resulting button is
known as an invisible button.
Users can’t see invisible buttons, but because the Hit keyframe still
defines a clickable area, invisible buttons remain active. You can
place invisible buttons over any part of the Stage and use
ActionScript to program them to respond to users.
Invisible buttons are useful for creating generic hotspots. For
example, placing them on top of different photos can help you make
each photo respond to a mouse click without having to make each
photo a different button symbol.

Duplicating buttons
Now that you’ve created one button, you’ll be able to create others more easily.
You’ll duplicate one button here, change the image in the next section, and then
continue to duplicate buttons and modify images for the remaining restaurants.
1. In the Library panel, right-click the gabel loffel button symbol and
choose Duplicate. You can also choose Duplicate from the Library panel
menu.
2. In the Duplicate Symbol dialog box, choose Button from the Type
menu, and name the symbol gary gari button. Click OK.

Swapping bitmaps
Bitmaps and symbols are easy to swap on the Stage and can significantly speed
up your workflow.
1. In the Library panel, double-click the icon for your newly duplicated
symbol (gary gari button) to edit it.
2. Select the restaurant image on the Stage.
3. In the Properties panel, click Swap.
4. In the Swap Symbol dialog box, select the next thumbnail image, gary
gari thumbnail, in the restaurant thumbnails folder, and click OK.
The original thumbnail (shown with a dot next to the symbol name) is
swapped out for the one you selected. Because they are both the same
size, the replacement is seamless.
5. Now select the Over keyframe on Layer 2, and click the gray
information box on the Stage.

6. In the Properties panel, click Swap and swap the selected symbol with
the symbol called “gary gari over info.”
The instance of your button in the Over keyframe is replaced with one
that is appropriate for the second restaurant. Because the symbol was
duplicated, all other elements, such as the sound in the top layer, remain
the same.

7. Continue duplicating your buttons and swapping the two instances
inside them until you have four different button symbols in your Library
panel, each representing a different restaurant (gabel loffel button, gary
gari button, il piatto button, and pierre platters button). When you’re
done, take a moment to organize all your restaurant buttons in a folder
in your Library panel.

Placing the button instances
Now you’ll put the buttons on the Stage and give them names in the Properties
panel so that your code can identify them.
1. On the main Timeline, insert a new layer and rename it buttons.
2. Drag each of your buttons from the Library panel to the middle of the
Stage, placing them in a horizontal row. Don’t worry about their exact
position, because you’ll align them nicely in the next few steps.

3. Select the first button, and in the Properties panel, set the X value to
100.
4. Select the last button, and in the Properties panel, set the X value to 680.
5. Select all four buttons. In the Align panel (Window > Align), deselect
Align To Stage, select Space Evenly Horizontally, and then click Align
Top Edge.
All four buttons are now evenly distributed and aligned horizontally.
6. With all the buttons still selected, in the Properties panel, enter 170 for
the Y value.
All four buttons are positioned on the Stage correctly.

7. Now you can test your movie to see how the buttons behave. Choose
Control > Test.
You can ignore any warnings that show up in the Output panel.
Note that the gray information box in the Over keyframe appears when
your mouse cursor hovers over each button, and that pressing your
mouse button over each button triggers the clicking sound. At this point,
however, you haven’t provided any instructions for the buttons to
actually do anything. That part comes after you name the buttons and
learn a little about coding.

 Note
If your browser displays a blank screen when you test your
movie (Control > Test), make sure you’re connected to the
Internet. If you’re not, then open the Publish settings (File >
Publish Settings). Select the Advanced tab and deselect
Hosted Libraries. The Hosted Libraries option links to
external JavaScript code, so your published files don’t have
to include them, but you need to be connected to the
Internet for your project to work.
Naming button instances
Next you’ll name each button instance so that your code can reference it.
Beginners often forget this crucial step.
1. Click in an empty part of the Stage to deselect all the buttons, and then
select just the first button.
2. Type gabelloffel_btn in the Instance Name field in the Properties panel.
3. Name the other buttons garygari_btn, ilpiatto_btn, and
pierreplatters_btn.
Animate is very picky, and one typo will prevent your entire project
from working correctly! See the sidebar “Naming rules” for information
about instance names.
4. Lock all the layers.

Naming rules
Naming instances is a critical step in creating interactive projects in
Animate. The most common mistake made by novices is not to
name, or to incorrectly name, a button instance.
Instance names are important because ActionScript and JavaScript
use the names to reference those objects. Instance names are not the
same as the symbol names in the Library panel. The names in the
Library panel are simply organizational reminders.
Instance naming follows these simple rules and best practices:
1. Do not use spaces or special punctuation. Underscores are OK to
use.
2. Do not begin a name with a number.
3. Be aware of uppercase and lowercase letters. ActionScript and
JavaScript are case-sensitive.
4. End your button name with _btn. Although it is not required, it
helps identify those objects as buttons.
5. Do not use any word that is reserved for an Animate
ActionScript or JavaScript command.
Preparing the Timeline
Every new Animate project begins with just a single frame. To create room on
the Timeline to add more content, you’ll have to add more frames to at least one
layer.
1. Select a later frame in all three layers. In this example, select frame 50.
2. Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5). You can also right-click and
choose Insert Frame.
Animate adds frames in all of the selected layers up to the selected
point, frame 50.

Creating Destination Keyframes
When the user clicks each button, Animate will move the playhead to a new spot
on the Timeline according to code that you’ll insert. Before adding the code,
you’ll create all the different options on the Timeline that your user might
choose.
Inserting keyframes with different content
You will create four keyframes in a new layer and place information about each
of the restaurants in the new keyframes.
1. Insert a new layer at the top of the layer stack and rename it content.
2. Select frame 10 of the content layer.
3. Insert a new keyframe at frame 10 (choose Insert > Timeline >
Keyframe, or press F6).
4. Insert new keyframes at frames 20, 30, and 40.
Your Timeline has four empty keyframes in the content layer.

5. Select the keyframe at frame 10.
6. In the Library panel, expand the folder called restaurant content. Drag
the symbol called “gabel and loffel” from the Library panel to the Stage.
The symbol named gabel and loffel is a movie clip symbol that contains
a photo, graphics, and text about the restaurant.
7. Position the symbol in the center of the Stage but out of the way of the
heading. The Properties panel Position and Size section should show
X=60 and Y=150.
The restaurant information about gabel and loffel is centered on the

Stage and covers all the buttons.
8. Select the keyframe at frame 20.
9. Drag the symbol called gary gari from the Library panel to the Stage so
that it also covers all the buttons. This is another movie clip symbol that
contains a photo, graphics, and text about this restaurant.
10. In the Properties panel, make sure the X value is set to 60 and the Y
value is set to 150.
11. Place each of the movie clip symbols from the restaurant content folder
in the Library panel at the corresponding keyframes in the content layer.
Each keyframe should contain a different movie clip symbol about a
restaurant.
Using labels on keyframes
Frame labels are names that you give to keyframes. Instead of referring to

keyframes by their frame number, you refer to them by their label, which makes
coding easier to read, write, and edit.
1. Select frame 10 on the content layer.
2. In the Properties panel Label section, enter label1 in the Name field.
A tiny flag icon appears on each of the keyframes that have labels.
3. Select frame 20 on the content layer.
4. In the Properties panel, in the Label section, enter label2 in the Name
field.
5. Select frames 30 and 40, and in the Properties panel, enter
corresponding names in the Name field for each: label3 and label4.
A tiny flag icon appears on each of the keyframes that has a label.
Navigating the Actions Panel
The Actions panel is where you enter all your code, whether JavaScript for
HTML5 Canvas documents or ActionScript for targeting Flash Player or AIR.
Open the Actions panel by choosing Window > Actions or by selecting a
keyframe on the Timeline and clicking the Actions panel button on the top right
of the Properties panel.

You can also right-click any keyframe and choose Actions.
The Actions panel gives you a flexible environment for entering code, as well as
different options to help you write, edit, and view your code.
The Actions panel is divided into two parts. On the right of the Actions panel is
the Script window—the blank slate where you can write code. You enter
ActionScript or JavaScript in the Script window just as you would in a text-
editing application.
On the left is the Script navigator, which tells you where your code is located.
Animate places code on keyframes on the Timeline, so the Script navigator can
be particularly useful if you have lots of code scattered in different keyframes
and on different timelines.
At the bottom of the Actions panel, Animate displays the line number and
column number (or character in the row) of the current position of the text
insertion point.

The upper-right corner of the Actions panel contains options for finding,
replacing, and inserting code. The Add Using Wizard button is also located
there.
Add JavaScript Interactivity with the Actions Panel Wizard
Now that you have multiple keyframes on the Timeline, your movie will play
linearly from frame 1 to frame 50, showing all the restaurant choices. However,
with this interactive restaurant guide, you’ll want to pause the movie at the very
first frame to wait for your viewers to choose a restaurant.
Stopping the Timeline
Use a stop action to pause your Animate movie. A stop action simply stops the
movie from continuing by halting the playhead.
1. Insert a new layer at the top and rename it actions.
JavaScript and ActionScript code are generally placed on keyframes on
the Timeline.
2. Select the first keyframe of the actions layer and open the Actions panel
(Window > Actions).
3. Click the Add Using Wizard button.

The wizard opens within the Actions panel. The wizard guides you
through the code-writing process in a step-by-step process. The code
that you generate with the wizard appears in the first field. The wizard is
available to insert JavaScript into HTML5 Canvas documents. For
ActionScript, you can use the Code Snippets panel.
4. Step 1 asks you to choose the action, or the behavior that you want
Animate to perform, from a list. Scroll down and select Stop.
Another menu appears to the right.

5. In the next menu, choose This Timeline.
Code appears in the action window. The stop action will apply to the
current timeline.

6. Click Next.
Step 2 appears in the wizard.

7. Step 2 asks you to select the trigger that will produce your selected
action.
8. Select With This Frame.

You want the stop action to be executed as soon as the timeline begins,
so the appropriate trigger is when the playhead encounters the current
frame.
9. Click Finish And Add.
The finished code is added to the Script window in the Actions panel.
The code is:
this.stop();
The first word, this, refers to the current timeline, and the stop action is
stop(). The semicolon at the end of the statement acts as a period and
indicates the end of the command.

The code in light gray that begins with /* and ends with */ is called a
multiline comment, and it is simply a description of what the code does.
It acts as a reminder for you and for other developers. Well-commented
code is essential—it will save you hours of headache when you return to
a project, and it is considered best practice for coders.
10. In the timeline, a tiny letter “a” is added to the first frame in the Actions
panel to indicate that code has been added there.
Adding actions for a button click
So far you have code that stops the Timeline at the first frame. Now you’ll add
an action for a button click. The button click is called a trigger in the wizard, but
in JavaScript and ActionScript it is known as an event.
Events are occurrences in your movie that Animate can detect and respond to.
For example, a mouse click, a mouse movement, and a key press are all events.
Pinch and swipe gestures on mobile devices are also events. These events are
produced by the user, but some events can happen independently of the user, like
the successful loading of a piece of data or the completion of a sound.
1. Select the first frame of the actions layer.
2. Open the Actions panel, if it’s not already open.
3. Place your text cursor at the last line of your Script window. You’ll add
additional code to the stop code that’s already there.
4. Click the Add Using Wizard button.
The wizard opens within the Actions panel.
5. Step 1 asks for the action. Scroll down and select Go To Frame Label
And Stop.

Another menu appears to the right.

6. In the next menu, choose This Timeline.
Code appears in the action window. The action will apply to the current
timeline.

7. Replace the blue highlighted letters in the action window with the name
of the label you want the playhead to go to. To replace
enterFrameLabel, enter label1.
The frame label name appears in green and should be between a set of
single quotes.
8. Click Next.
Step 2 appears in the wizard.

9. Step 2 asks for the trigger that will produce your selected action. Select
On Mouse Click.
On Mouse Click is an event that happens when the user’s mouse is
pressed and then released over the button. Another menu appears to the
right.

10. The wizard asks for the object for the triggering event. Select
gabelloffel_btn, which is the button that corresponds to the Gabel and
Loffel restaurant, whose information is displayed in the keyframe
labeled “label1.”

11. Click Finish And Add.
The finished code is added to the Script window in the Actions panel.

The code consists of the trigger 'click' and a function that groups all
the code that is executed when the trigger happens. What’s important for
you to identify are the opening and closing curly braces of the function.
This function has only one statement (a gotoAndStop action, which
moves the playhead), but functions can contain many statements.
12. Choose Control > Test.
Animate opens your browser to show your project. Click the Gabel
Loffel button. Animate detects the click trigger on the button and moves
the playhead to the keyframe labeled “label1,” where the Stage shows
information about the Gabel and Loffel restaurant.
 Note
If you’re feeling confident, you can try to copy and paste
code in the Script window and just change the name of the
button and the name of the frame label. It will be faster than
going through the wizard, and it will be your first step in
identifying and learning different parts of JavaScript code
so that you can eventually write code yourself.
13. Close your browser and return to Animate.
14. Select the first frame of the actions layer and open the Actions panel
again.
15. Continue adding additional actions and triggers to the existing code for

the other three buttons. Each button should trigger a gotoAndStop action
to a different keyframe.
Checking for errors
Debugging is a necessary process, even for veteran coders. Even if
you’re extra careful, errors will creep into your code. Fortunately,
the wizard helps reduce typos and common errors. If you do enter
code by hand, a few tips can help prevent, catch, and identify errors:
1. If you’re working in an ActionScript 3.0 document, Animate
automatically displays code errors in the Compiler Errors panel
(Window > Compiler Errors) with a description of the error and
its location. None of your code will be functional if there is a
compiler error in any part of the code.
2. Take advantage of color hinting in the code. Animate colors
keywords, variables, comments, and other language elements
differently. You don’t need to know why they are different, but
the different colors can give you clues as to where there may be
some missing punctuation.
3. Click the Format Code button at the upper-right corner of the
Actions panel to tidy up your code and make it easier to read.
You can change the formatting settings in Edit > Preferences >
Code Editor (Windows) or Animate CC > Preferences > Code
Editor (Mac).
Creating a Home Button
Since the information for each restaurant covers the buttons, readers currently
can’t make another selection after they choose their first. You’ll need to provide
another button that will return users to the first frame, which you’ll do in the
next section.
A home button simply makes the playhead go back to the first frame of the
Timeline, or to a keyframe where an original set of choices, or the main menu,
are presented to the viewer. You can create a button that goes to the first frame
using the same process you followed to create the four restaurant buttons.
Adding another button instance
The sample lesson file provides a home, or mainmenu, button for you in the

Library panel.
1. Select the buttons layer and unlock it if it is locked.
2. Drag the button called mainmenu from the Library panel to the Stage.
Position the button instance at the upper-right corner.
3. In the Properties panel, set the X value to 726 and the Y value to 60.
4. In the Properties panel, name the instance mainmenu_btn.
Adding code for the home button
The action will be Go To Frame Number And Stop, and the trigger will be a
button click.
1. Select the first frame of the actions layer.
2. Open the Actions panel, if it’s not already open.
3. Place your text cursor at a new line after the last line of code of your
Script window. You’ll add additional code to the stop code that’s already
there.
4. Click the Add Using Wizard button.
The wizard opens within the Actions panel.

5. Step 1 asks for the action. Scroll down and select Go To Frame Number
And Stop.
Another menu appears to the right.

6. In the next menu, select This Timeline.

Code appears in the action window. The action will apply to the current
timeline.
7. Replace the blue highlighted letters in the action window with the frame
number you want the playhead to go to. Instead of 50, enter 0.
Why 0 and not 1? JavaScript begins counting frames at 0, so the first
frame of your timeline is 0 and not 1. ActionScript, on the other hand,
begins counting the timeline frames at 1, so be extra careful when
coding frame numbers. For this reason, it’s best to use frame labels
whenever possible.
Notice, too, that frame numbers are not enclosed between single quotes.
Frame labels, however, are.
8. Click Next.

Step 2 appears in the wizard.
9. Step 2 asks for the trigger that will produce your selected action. Select
On Mouse Click.
On Mouse Click is an event that happens when the user’s mouse is
pressed and then released over the button. Another menu appears to the
right.

10. The wizard asks for the object for the triggering event. Select
mainmenu_btn.
11. Click Finish And Add.

Code Snippets panel
Animate provides another panel, called the Code Snippets panel
(Window > Code Snippets), that offers a way to add ActionScript
3.0 or JavaScript code. The panel is organized into folders for
different kinds of interactivity. Simply expand the folder that you
want and select the action. Animate guides you for any additional
information.
The Code Snippets panel also provides a way for you to save your
own code and share it with other developers.
For beginners, it’s best to use the Add Using Wizard option in the
Actions panel for JavaScript.
Playing Animation at the Destination
So far, this interactive restaurant guide works by using the gotoAndStop()
command to show information in different keyframes along the Timeline. But
suppose you wanted an image to fade in rather than appear suddenly—how
would you play an animation after a user clicks a button? One way is to use the

command gotoAndPlay(), which moves the playhead to the frame number or
frame label and plays from that point forward.
Creating transition animations
Next, you’ll create a short transition animation for each of the restaurant guides.
The transition animation will show the restaurant guides slowly increase in
opacity to fade up. Then you’ll change your code to direct Animate to go to each
of the beginning keyframes and play the animation.
1. Move the playhead to the label1 frame label.
2. Right-click the instance of the restaurant information on the Stage and
choose Create Motion Tween.
Animate creates a separate tween layer for the instance so that it can
proceed with the motion tween.
3. In the Properties panel’s Color Effect section, choose Alpha from the

Style menu.
4. Set the Alpha slider to 0%.
The instance on the Stage becomes totally transparent.
5. Move the playhead to the end of the tween span at frame 19.
6. Select the transparent instance on the Stage.
7. In the Properties panel, set the Alpha slider to 100%.
The instance is displayed at a normal opacity level. The motion tween
from frame 10 to frame 19 produces a smooth fade-in effect.
8. Create similar motion tweens for the remaining restaurants in the
keyframes labeled label2, label3, and label4.

Using the gotoAndPlay command
The gotoAndPlay command makes the Animate playhead move to a specific
frame on the Timeline and begin playing from that point.
1. Select the first frame of the actions layer and open the Actions panel.
2. In your ActionScript code, change the first four gotoAndStop()
commands to gotoAndPlay() commands. Leave the parameter
unchanged:
gotoAndStop('label1'); should be changed to
gotoAndPlay('label1’);.
gotoAndStop('label2'); should be changed to
gotoAndPlay('label2');.
gotoAndStop('label3'); should be changed to
gotoAndPlay('label3');.
gotoAndStop('label4'); should be changed to
gotoAndPlay('label4');.
For each of the restaurant buttons, the JavaScript code now directs the
playhead to a particular frame label and begins playing at that point.
Make sure you keep the function for your Home button unchanged.
You’ll want that function to remain a gotoAndStop() command.
 Tip
A fast and easy way of doing multiple replacements is to
use the Find And Replace command in the Actions panel.
Click the Find button in the upper-right corner, select Find,
and then choose Find And Replace from the menu to the
right of the Find Text field.

Stopping the animations
If you test your movie now (Control > Test), you’ll see that each button goes to
its corresponding frame label and plays from that point, but it keeps playing,
showing all the remaining animations in the Timeline. The next step is to tell
Animate when to stop.
1. Select frame 19 of the actions layer, the frame just before the label2
keyframe on the content layer.
2. Right-click and choose Insert Keyframe.
We’ll use the new keyframe to add a stop action just before the second
animation starts to play.
3. Open the Actions panel.
The Script window in the Actions panel is blank. Don’t panic! Your
code has not disappeared. Your code for the event listeners is on the first
keyframe of the actions layer. You have selected a new keyframe in
which you will add a stop command.
4. In the Script window, enter this.stop();.
Animate will stop playing when it reaches frame 19.
5. Insert keyframes at frames 29, 39, and 50.

 Tip
If you want a quick and easy way to duplicate the keyframe
containing the stop command, hold down the Option/Alt
key while you move it to a new location on the Timeline.
6. In each of those keyframes, add a stop command in the Actions panel.
 Tip
If you wish, you could also use the Add Using Wizard panel
to add the stop command for each of the keyframes.
7. Test your movie by choosing Control > Test.
Each button takes you to a different keyframe and plays a short fade-in
animation. At the end of the animation, the movie stops and waits for the
viewer to click the Home button.
Pinning code in the Actions panel
When you have code scattered in multiple keyframes on the
Timeline, it’s sometimes difficult to go back and forth to edit or
view your code. The Actions panel provides a way for you to keep
the code from particular keyframes “pinned” to the Actions panel.
Click the Pin Script button at the top of the Actions panel and
Animate will create a separate tab for the code currently displayed

in the Script window.
The tab will be labeled with the frame number where your code
resides. You can pin multiple scripts, allowing you to navigate
easily between them.
Animated Buttons
Currently, when you hover your mouse cursor over one of the restaurant buttons,
the gray “additional information” box suddenly appears. But imagine if that gray
information box were animated. It would give more life and sophistication to the
interaction between the user and the button.
Animated buttons display an animation in the Up, Over, or Down keyframes.
The key to creating an animated button is to create an animation inside a movie
clip symbol, and then place that movie clip symbol inside the Up, Over, or Down
keyframes of a button symbol. When one of those button keyframes is displayed,
the animation in the movie clip plays.
Creating the animation in a movie clip symbol
Your button symbols in this interactive restaurant guide already contain a movie
clip symbol of a gray information box in their Over states. You will edit each
movie clip symbol to add an animation inside it.
1. In the Library panel, expand the restaurant previews folder. Double-
click the movie clip symbol icon for “gabel loffel over info.”

You enter symbol-editing mode for the movie clip symbol called gabel
loffel over info.
2. Select all the visual elements on the Stage (Ctrl+A/Command+A).
3. Right-click and choose Create Motion Tween.

4. In the dialog box that appears asking for confirmation to convert the
selection to a symbol, click OK.
Layer 1 is converted to a motion tween layer and adds 1 second’s worth
of frames to the movie clip Timeline.
5. Drag the end of the tween span back so that the Timeline has only 10
frames.
6. Move the playhead to frame 1 and select the instance on the Stage.
7. In the Properties panel’s Color Effect section, choose Alpha from the
Style menu and set the Alpha value to 0%.
The instance on the Stage becomes totally transparent.
8. Move the playhead to the end of the tween span at frame 10.

9. Select the transparent instance on the Stage.
10. In the Properties panel, set the Alpha value to 100%.
Animate creates a smooth transition between the transparent and opaque
instance in the 10-frame tween span.
11. Insert a new layer and rename it actions.
12. Insert a new keyframe in the last frame (frame 10) of the actions layer.
13. Open the Actions panel (Window > Actions) and enter this.stop(); in
the Script window.
Adding the stop action in the last frame ensures that the fade-in effect
plays only once. The last keyframe on frame 10 of the actions layer
shows a tiny “a,” indicating that it has code attached there.

14. Exit symbol-editing mode by clicking the Scene 1 button in the Edit bar
above the Stage.
 Tip
If you want an animated button to repeat its animation,
leave out the stop command at the end of the movie clip’s
Timeline.
15. Choose Control > Test.
When your mouse cursor hovers over the first restaurant button, the gray
information box fades in. The motion tween inside the movie clip
symbol plays the fade-in effect, and the movie clip symbol is placed in
the Over state of the button symbol.

16. Create identical motion tweens for the other gray information box
movie clips to animate all of the restaurant buttons, and add a stop
action to the end of those tweens.
Review Questions
1 How and where do you add ActionScript or JavaScript code?
2 How do you name an instance, and why is it necessary?
3 How can you label frames, and when is it useful?
4 What does the stop() command do?
5 What is a trigger in the Actions panel wizard?
6 How do you create an animated button?
Review Answers
1 ActionScript or JavaScript code is attached to keyframes of the Timeline.
Keyframes that contain code are indicated by a small lowercase “a.” You add
code in the Actions panel. Choose Window > Actions, select a keyframe and

click the Actions panel icon in the Properties panel, or right-click and select
Actions. You enter code directly in the Script window in the Actions panel, or
you can add code through the Add Using Wizard option. You can also add
code with the Code Snippets panel.
2 To name an instance, select it on the Stage and then type a name in the
Instance Name field in the Properties panel. You need to name an instance so
that ActionScript or JavaScript can identify it with code.
3 To label a frame, select a keyframe on the Timeline, and then type a name in
the Frame Label box in the Properties panel. You can label frames in Animate
to make it easier to reference frames with code and to give you more
flexibility.
4 In ActionScript or JavaScript, a stop() command halts the playhead from
advancing.
5 A trigger is an event that Animate can respond to with an action. A button
click or the playhead entering a frame are typical triggers.
6 Animated buttons display an animation in the Up, Over, or Down keyframes.
To create an animated button, make an animation inside a movie clip symbol,
and then place that movie clip symbol inside the Up, Over, or Down
keyframes of a button symbol. When one of those button keyframes is
displayed, the animation in the movie clip plays.

11. Working with Sound and Video
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
Import sound files
Edit sound files
Use Adobe Media Encoder to prepare video
Understand video and audio encoding options
Use components to play back video for Adobe AIR, ActionScript
3.0, or HTML5 Canvas documents
Embed video as a guide to animation
Customize options on video playback components
This lesson will take about one hour to complete. Please log in to your
account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or
go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book and follow
the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web Edition.

Sound and video add new dimensions to your projects. Import sound files and
edit them directly in Adobe Animate CC, and use Adobe Media Encoder CC
to compress and convert video files to use in your projects.
Getting Started
Start the lesson by viewing the finished animated zoo kiosk. You’ll create the
kiosk by adding sound and video files to a project in Adobe Animate CC in an
AIR for Desktop document.
 Note

If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.
See “Getting Started” at the beginning of the book.
1. Double-click the file Shearwood-Wildlife-Preserve.air, a cross-platform
installer, in the Lesson11/11End folder to play the animation.
The installer will warn you that the application comes from an unknown
author, but you can trust us! Click Install. When the installation is done,
the application launches a new window at the upper-left corner of your
desktop. After a brief soundtrack of an African beat, a zoo director pops
up and introduces himself.
 Note
If your computer asks you to choose an application to open
the file, you’ll need to install the Adobe AIR runtime. Go to

get.adobe.com/air and follow the installation instructions.
2. Click a sound button (in the lower-left corner) to hear an animal sound.
3. Click one of the buttons bearing the picture and name of an animal to
view a short movie about the animal. Use the interface controls below
the movie to pause the movie, continue the movie, or lower the volume.
4. Press Ctrl+Q/Command+Q to close the application (or choose Quit
from the Windows Taskbar or from the macOS Dock).
In this lesson, you’ll import audio files and put them on the Timeline to provide
the short introductory audio flourish and then embed some of those sounds in
each button. Moving on to video, you’ll use Adobe Media Encoder CC to
compress and convert the video files to the appropriate format for Animate.
You’ll learn to use and customize video components to play external video files.
1. Double-click the 11Start.fla file in the Lesson11/11Start folder to open
the initial project file in Animate CC.
2. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 11_workingcopy.fla, and save it
in the 11Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original
start file will be available if you want to start over.

Understanding the Project File
The project file is an AIR for Desktop document. The final published project is a
self-contained application that runs on either the Windows or macOS desktop
without needing a browser. The application makes it easy to play in a fixed
display such as a museum kiosk or information booth.
The initial setup of the project has been completed except for the audio and
video portions. The Stage is 1000 × 700 pixels. A photo of a snoozing lion forms
the background of the application. Layered above the background is a row of
buttons along the bottom of the Stage, with three simple buttons at the left and a
set of buttons depicting colorful animals to the right. A title banner spans the top
of the Stage.
The Timeline contains several layers that separate the different types of content.

The bottom layers, called background photo, black, title, and bottom navbar,
contain design elements, text, and images. The two layers directly above, called
buttons and sound buttons, contain instances of button symbols. The videos layer
contains several labeled keyframes, and the actions layer contains ActionScript
3.0 code that provides the interactivity for the bottom row of buttons.
If you’ve completed Lesson 10, you should be familiar with the structure of this
Timeline. The individual buttons on the bottom row are already coded so that
when the user clicks a button, the playhead moves to a corresponding labeled
keyframe in the videos layer. You’ll be inserting content into each of those
keyframes. But first you’ll learn to work with sound.
Using Sounds
You can import several types of sound files into Animate, among them MP3,
AIFF, and WAV files, which are three common sound formats. When you import
sound files into Animate, they are stored in your Library panel. You can then
drag the sound files from the Library panel onto the Stage at different points
along the Timeline to synchronize those sounds to whatever may be happening
on the Stage.
Importing sound files
You’ll import several sound files to the Library panel, which you’ll use
throughout this lesson.
1. Choose File > Import > Import To Library.
2. Select the Monkey.wav file in the Lesson11/11Start/Sounds folder, and
click Open.
The Monkey.wav file appears in your Library panel. The sound file is
indicated by a unique icon, and when it is selected the preview window
shows a waveform—a series of peaks and valleys that represent the

sound.
3. Click the Play button in the far upper-right corner of the Library
preview window.
The sound plays.
4. Double-click the sound icon to the left of your Monkey.wav file.

The Sound Properties dialog box appears, providing information on your
sound file, including its original location, size, and other technical
properties. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. Choose File > Import > Import To Library and select the other sound
files to import into your Animate project. Import Elephant.wav,
Lion.wav, Africanbeat.mp3, and Afrolatinbeat.mp3. Click Open to
import the files.
Your Library panel should contain all the sound files.
 Tip
Hold down the Shift key to select multiple files to import all
at once.
6. Create a folder in your Library panel and place all the sound files in it to
organize your Library panel. Name the folder sounds.

 Note
In addition to MP3, AIFF, and WAV files, Animate supports
ASND (Adobe Sound), SD2 (Sound Designer II), AU (Sun
AU), FLAC, and OGG or OFF (Ogg Vorbis).
Placing sounds on the Timeline
You can place a sound at any keyframe along the Timeline, and Animate will
play that sound when the playhead reaches the keyframe. You’ll place a sound
on the very first keyframe that plays at the start of the movie to provide a
pleasant audio introduction and set the mood.
1. Select the videos layer on the Timeline.
2. Insert a new layer and rename it sounds.

3. Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer.
4. Drag the Afrolatinbeat.mp3 file from the sounds folder in your Library
panel onto the Stage.
The waveform of your sound appears on the Timeline.
5. Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer, if it’s not already selected.
In the Properties panel, in the Sound section, note that your sound file is
now listed on the Name menu.
6. Choose Stream from the Sync menu.

The Sync options determine how the sound plays on the Timeline. Use
Stream sync for long passages of music or narration when you want to
synchronize the sound with the Timeline.
7. Move the playhead back and forth on the Timeline.
The sound plays as you scrub the Timeline.
8. Choose Control > Test.
The sound doesn’t play! Don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.
Because the sound is set to Stream, it plays only when the playhead
moves along the Timeline, and only if there are sufficient frames to play.
There is a stop action at frame 1 that pauses the playhead to wait for the
user to click a button, and thus stops the sound.
9. Select the keyframe in the sounds layer of the Timeline, and in the
Properties panel, change the Sync option from Stream to Event.
When the Event sync option is selected, the sound plays as soon as the
playhead enters the keyframe that the sound is in. Choose Control > Test
to hear the full sound play.

Understanding sound sync options
Sound sync refers to the way a sound is triggered and played. There
are several options: Event, Start, Stop, and Stream. Stream ties the
sound to the Timeline so you can easily synchronize animated
elements to the sound. Event and Start are used to trigger a sound
(usually a short sound) to a specific event, like a button click. Event
and Start are similar except that the Start sync does not trigger the
sound if it is already playing (so there are no overlapping sounds
possible with Start sync). The Stop option is used to stop a sound,
although you’ll use it rarely, if ever. If you want to stop a sound
with a Stream sync, simply insert a blank keyframe.
Clipping the end of a sound
The sound clip you imported is a bit longer than you need. You’ll shorten the
sound file by using the Edit Envelope dialog box. Then you’ll apply a fade so the
sound gradually decreases as it ends.
1. Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer.
2. In the Properties panel, in the Sound section, click the Edit Sound
Envelope button, which is to the right of the Effect menu and bears a
pencil icon.
The Edit Envelope dialog box appears, showing you the sound’s
waveform.

The upper and lower waveforms represent the left and right channels of
the stereo sound, respectively. The thin black line running horizontally
above each waveform shows the sound level for each channel, and
together they make up the envelope of the sound. A timeline runs
between the waveforms, the Effect menu in the upper-left corner offers
preset effects, and buttons that enable view fig11-015.jpgoptions occupy
the lower-right corner.
3. In the Edit Envelope dialog box, click the Seconds button, if it isn’t
already selected.
The Timeline changes units to show seconds instead of frames. Click the
Frames button to switch back. You can switch back and forth, depending
on how you want to view your sound.
4. Click Zoom Out until you can see the entire waveform.

The waveform appears to end at around 240 frames, or about 10
seconds.
5. Drag the right end of the time slider to the left to about frame 50.
The sound shortens by being clipped from the end. The sound now plays
for about 50 frames.
6. Click OK to accept the changes you’ve made.
The Edit Envelope dialog box closes.

7. Choose Control > Test.
The sound plays for only 50 frames (a little over two seconds) and then
stops abruptly. Close the Test Movie preview window.
 Note
Edits made in the Edit Envelope dialog box are
nondestructive. That means that shortening an audio clip
doesn’t discard any of the data—it just changes how much
of the clip is played in a movie. If you change your mind
later, you can always lengthen the clip again.
Changing the volume of a sound
The sound will be more elegant if it slowly fades out instead of being abruptly
cut off. You can change the volume levels through time in the Edit Envelope
dialog box. Use it to fade in, fade out, or modulate the volume of the left and
right channels separately.
1. Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer.
2. In the Properties panel, click the Edit Sound Envelope button.
The Edit Envelope dialog box appears.
Audio splitting
If you want to pause a streaming audio on the Timeline, and
then at a later point in time resume audio playback from the
point it was stopped, you can use audio splitting. You don’t
need to split your audio in this lesson, but here’s how to do
it.
To split sound on the Timeline, the sound must be on Sync
streaming. Select the frame at the point when you want to
pause the audio; then right-click, and choose Split Audio.
Your sound will be split into two streams, indicated by a
new keyframe at the point at which you split the audio.
Insert a new keyframe on the frame just behind the
keyframe where you split your audio.
Now, move the keyframe containing the second half of your
audio, and a gap will be created between the split.

Your audio will play until it reaches the empty keyframe,
where it will pause. When your playhead reaches the next
keyframe with the split audio, the sound will resume.
3. Select the Seconds viewing option, and zoom in on the waveform to see
its end, near 2.1 seconds.
4. Click the left channel level above the 1.0 second mark.

A box appears on the line, indicating that a keyframe has been added for
the sound volume. A corresponding keyframe is also added to the right
channel.
5. Click the left channel level at about the 2.0 second mark (at the very
end), and drag it down to the bottom of the channel.
The downward diagonal line indicates the drop in volume level from
100% to 0%.
6. Click the corresponding keyframe on the right channel level and drag it
down to the bottom of the channel.

7. Click the Play button to hear the edited sound.
The African flourish plays for about one second and then slowly fades
away.
8. Click OK to close the dialog box and accept the changes.
Deleting or changing the sound file
If you don’t want the sound on your Timeline, or you want to change to a
different sound, you can make those changes in the Properties panel.
1. Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer.
2. In the Sound section of the Properties panel, choose None from the
Name menu.
The sound is removed from the Timeline.
3. Now let’s add a different sound. Choose Africanbeat.mp3 from the
menu.
The Africanbeat.mp3 sound is added to the Timeline. The settings in the
Edit Envelope dialog box that clip the sound and fade it out are reset
(since you chose None to remove the Afrolatinbeat.mp3 sound).
Return to the Edit Envelope dialog box to customize the
Africanbeat.mp3 sound in the same way as you did the previous sound.

The sound should play for about one second before it gradually becomes
softer and cuts out after two seconds.
Adding sounds to buttons
In the kiosk, the buttons that control animal sounds appear on your Stage on the
left. You’ll add sounds to the buttons so that they play whenever the user clicks
them.
1. In the Library panel, double-click the icon of the button symbol called
sound_button1.
You enter symbol-editing mode for that button symbol.
The three layers in the button symbol help organize the content for the
Up, Over, Down, and Hit states.
2. Insert a new layer and rename it sounds.
3. Select the Down frame in your sounds layer and insert a keyframe.

A new keyframe appears in the Down state of your button.
4. Drag the Monkey.wav file from the sounds folder in your Library panel
to the Stage.
A waveform for the Monkey.wav file appears in the Down keyframe of
the sounds layer.
5. Select the Down keyframe in the sounds layer.
6. In the Properties panel, in the Sound section, choose Start from the Sync
menu.
When Sync is set to Start for a keyframe, the sound is triggered
whenever the playhead enters that particular keyframe.
7. Choose Control > Test. Test the first button to hear the monkey, and
then close the preview window.

 Note
You can also add sound with an Event or Start sync to the
Over state of a button symbol, and the sound will play
whenever the mouse cursor hovers over the button.
8. Edit sound_button2 and sound_button3 to add the Lion.wav and
Elephant.wav sounds, respectively, to their Down states. Click Scene 1
in the Edit bar to exit symbol-editing mode.
Understanding Video
Animate makes it very easy to deliver video. Combining video, interactivity, and
animation can create a very rich and immersive multimedia experience for your
viewers.
Deploying video varies depending on whether you’re working in an ActionScript
3.0, AIR for Desktop, AIR for Android, AIR for iOS, or HTML5 Canvas
document.
 Note
Video playback is not supported in WebGL documents.
Video with ActionScript 3.0 or AIR documents
If you’re working in an ActionScript 3.0 or AIR document, as you are in this
lesson, you have two options for displaying video. The first option is to use the
FLVPlayback component to play the video. A component in Animate is a
reusable, packaged module that adds a particular capability to an Animate
document. The FLVPlayback component is a special widget that is used on the

Stage to play your external video.
Using the FLVPlayback component allows you to keep the video separate from
your Animate file. If you have a very short video clip, you can use the second
option, which is to embed the video directly inside your Animate file (which you
will not do in this lesson).
Avoid it: Embedding video in an ActionScript 3.0 or AIR
document
While embedding a video directly inside an ActionScript 3.0 or AIR
document is possible, in reality it is not practical. The feature is a
remnant from previous versions of the Animate application, and it
requires that your video be formatted as an FLV file (Flash Video
file), which Media Encoder no longer supports. Moreover,
embedding video is limited to only short stretches of video and can
create very large final file sizes that are unwieldy to download and
manage.
Video with HTML5 Canvas documents
If you want to display video in an HTML5 Canvas document, you use Animate’s
Video component. The Video component, like that for ActionScript 3.0
documents, provides an easy interface with which to point to the correct external
video file and change playback parameters.
Video encoding
Whichever approach you’re taking to display video, Animate requires that the
video be encoded correctly first. To use a playback component from Animate to
play your video, the video must be encoded in the H.264 standard, a video codec
that delivers high quality with very efficient compression. A codec
(compression-decompression) is a method computers use to compress a video
file to save space and then to decompress it to play it back. The H.264 codec is
used in MP4 video files (which are very common), so MP4 videos can be used
across ActionScript 3.0, AIR, and HTML5 Canvas documents.
Using Adobe Media Encoder CC
You can convert your video files to the proper video format using Adobe Media
Encoder CC, a stand-alone application that is installed with Animate CC. Adobe
Media Encoder can convert single files or multiple files (known as batch

processing) to make your workflow easier.
 Note
If Adobe Media Encoder CC is not available on your machine for
some reason, use the Adobe Creative Cloud desktop application to
download and install it.
Adding a video file to Adobe Media Encoder
The first step in converting your video file to a compatible Animate format is to
add the video to Adobe Media Encoder for encoding.
1. Launch Adobe Media Encoder CC.
The opening screen displays the Queue panel in the upper right, which
shows any current video files that have been added for processing. The
Queue panel should be empty. The other panels are the Encoding panel,
which shows any video currently being processed; Media Browser,
which lets you navigate your computer to find video files; and the Preset
Browser, which provides commonly used predefined settings.

2. Choose File > Add Source, or click the Add Source button (with the
plus sign icon) in the Queue panel.
A file navigation dialog box opens to allow you to select a video file.
 Tip
You can also drag the file directly to the Queue panel from

your desktop.
3. Navigate to the Lesson11/11Start folder, select the Penguins.mov file,
and click Open.
The Penguins.mov file is added to the queue of files for processing and
is ready for conversion to your choice of video format.
 Note
By default Adobe Media Encoder does not start processing
the queue automatically when the program is idle. You can
change this setting by choosing Edit > Preferences
(Windows) or Adobe Media Encoder CC > Preferences
(macOS) and selecting the Start Queue Automatically
option.
Converting video files for Animate
Converting your video files is easy, and how much time it takes depends on how
large your original video file is and on your computer’s processing speed.
1. In the first column under Format, stick with the selected default, H.264.

H.264 is a widely accepted codec for web videos and works with
Animate’s video components.
2. Click the arrowhead in the Preset column to open the Preset menu.
The video presets determine the dimensions of the video and the quality
of the video based on specific playback platforms and devices. Select
Match Source – Medium Bitrate.
3. Click the name of the preset you just chose.
The Export Settings dialog box appears, with advanced settings for
cropping, resizing, clipping, and many other video and audio options.
You’ll resize the penguin video so that it fits comfortably on the Stage of
your zoo kiosk project.

4. Click the Video tab. Deselect Match This Property To The Source Video
to allow the video to be resized, and enter 432 for the Width. Click
outside the field to accept the change.
Because the Constrain Proportions option is selected (chain link icon),
Animate modifies the Height to 320 to keep the proportions of your
video consistent.
5. Click OK.
Animate closes the Export Settings dialog box and saves your advanced
video and audio settings.

6. Click the link under the Output File column.
The Save As dialog box appears. You can choose to save the converted
file in a different location on your computer or choose a different
filename. Your original video will not be deleted or altered in any way.
For this exercise, click Cancel.
7. Click the Start Queue button (the green triangular icon) in the upper-
right corner.
Adobe Media Encoder begins the encoding process. The Encoding panel
shows the progress of the operation (along with a preview of the video)
and the encoding settings.
When the encoding process finishes, “Done” appears in the Status
column of the Queue panel.
You now have the Penguins.mp4 file in your Lesson11/11Start folder
along with the original Penguins.mov file.
 Note

You can change the status of an individual file in the Queue
panel by selecting the file and choosing Edit > Reset Status
or Edit > Skip Selection. Reset Status removes the Done
label from a completed file so that it can be encoded again,
whereas Skip Selection makes Animate skip that particular
file when you have multiple files in the queue.
Understanding Encoding Options
You can customize many settings when converting your original video. You’ve
already seen how you can change the size of the original video when you
converted the penguin movie. You can also crop your video to specific
dimensions, convert only a snippet of the video, adjust the type of compression
and the compression levels, and even apply filters to the video. To display the
encoding options available, select the Penguins.mov file in the Queue panel, and
then choose Edit > Reset Status. Click the entry in the Format column or the
Preset column. The Export Settings dialog box appears.
Adjusting video length

Your video may have unwanted segments at the beginning or the end. You can
shave off footage by placing In and Out points where you want your video to
begin and end.
1. Drag the playhead (top blue marker) to scrub through your video to
preview the footage. Place the playhead at the point where you want
your video to start playing.
The current-time indicator at the left end of the Timeline shows the
position of the playhead in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames.
2. Click the Set In Point button.
The In point moves to the current position of the playhead.
3. Drag the playhead to the point where you want your video to stop.
4. Click the Set Out Point button.
The Out point moves to the current position of the playhead.
5. You can also simply drag the In and Out point markers to bracket the
desired video segment.
The highlighted portion of your video between the In and Out point
markers will be the only segment of your original video that will be
encoded.
6. Drag the In and Out points back to their original positions, or choose
Entire Clip from the Source Range menu, because you do not need to
adjust the video length for this lesson.

 Tip
You can use the Left Arrow or Right Arrow key on your
keyboard to move back or ahead, respectively, frame by
frame for finer control.
Setting advanced video and audio options
The right side of the Export Settings dialog box contains information about the
original video and summarizes the export settings.

You can choose one of the options from the top Preset menu. At the bottom, you
can navigate to advanced video and audio encoding options using the tabs. At
the very bottom, Animate displays the estimated output size.
Saving advanced video and audio options
If you want to apply the same settings to many videos, it makes sense to save
your advanced video and audio options. You can do that in Adobe Media
Encoder. Once you have saved your settings, you can easily apply them to other

videos in the queue.
1. In the Export Settings dialog box, click the Save Preset button.
2. In the dialog box that opens, provide a descriptive name for the video
and audio options. Click OK.
3. In the Export Settings dialog box, click OK to return to the queue of
videos. You can apply your custom settings to additional videos by
simply choosing an item from the Preset menu or from the Preset
Browser panel.
4. Press Ctrl+Q/Command+Q to quit Adobe Media Encoder.
Playback of External Video in Your Project

Now that you have successfully converted your video to the correct compatible
format, you can use it in your zoo kiosk project. You will have your project play
each of the animal videos at the different labeled keyframes on the Timeline.
 Tip
In the Import Video wizard, choose Embed H.264 Video In The
Timeline to embed an H.264-encoded video to use as a guide for
hand-drawn animation. Animators often use live-action video to
guide their frame-by-frame drawings, in a technique known as
rotoscoping. The video appears on your Timeline but is not
exported.
Your videos are independent of your Animate project. Keeping videos external
ensures that you can edit them separately and that the videos can maintain
different frame rates from your Animate project.
1. Return to your 11_workingcopy.fla project in Animate CC.
2. Select the keyframe labeled penguins in the videos layer.
3. Choose File > Import > Import Video.
The Import Video wizard appears. This wizard guides you step by step
through the process of adding video to Animate.

4. In the Import Video wizard, select On Your Computer > Load External
Video With Playback Component, and click the Browse button next to
the File Path field.
5. In the Open dialog box, select Penguins.mp4 from the Lesson11/11Start
folder and click Open.
The path to the video file is displayed under the Browse button.
6. Click Next or Continue.
7. In the next screen, you choose the skin, or the style of the interface
controls, for the video. From the Skin menu, choose the third option
from the top,
MinimaFlatCustomColorPlayBackSeekCounterVolMute.swf, if it’s not
already chosen.

The skins fall into three broad categories. The skins whose names begin
with “Minima” are the latest designs and include options with a numeric
counter. The skins that begin with “SkinUnder” use controls that appear
below the video. The skins that begin with “SkinOver” include controls
that overlap the bottom edge of the video. A preview of the skin and its
controls appears in the preview window.
8. Click the Color box, select #333333, and enter 75 in the Alpha:% field.
Click Next or Continue.
9. On the next screen of the Import Video wizard, review the information
for the video file, and then click Finish to place the video.
10. Your video with the selected skin appears on the Stage. Place the video
on the left side of the Stage. In the Property inspector, set X=65 and
Y=160.

The keyframe labeled penguins in the videos layer shows a filled circle
followed by a lighter gray span of frames, indicating that it contains
content.
An FLVPlayback component also appears in your Library panel.

11. Choose Control > Test. After the short musical introduction, click the
Magellanic Penguins button.
The FLVPlayback component plays the external penguin video with the
skin you chose in the Import Video wizard. If your video does not play,
check to make sure your MP4 video file is in the same folder as your

FLA file. In the Properties panel’s Component Parameters section, the
Source item indicates the path to the video file.
Close the preview window.
12. The other animal videos have already been encoded in the H.264 format
and provided in the 11Start folder. Import the Mandrill.mp4, Tiger.mp4,
and Lion.mp4 videos in each of their corresponding keyframes and
position them on the Stage in the same location as the Penguins.mp4
movie. Choose the same skin as the Penguin.mp4 video.
 Note
The skin is a small SWF file that determines the
functionality and appearance of the video’s controls. You
can use one of the skins provided with Animate, or you can
choose None from the top of the menu.
Controlling the video playback
A video component lets you control which video plays, whether the video plays
automatically, and other aspects of playback. The options for playback can be
accessed in the Component Parameters panel. Select the FLVPlayback
component on the Stage and select Show Parameters in the Properties panel, or
choose Window > Component Parameters.
 Note
Although the component that plays video in an ActionScript 3.0
document is called FLVPlayback, it can play H.264-encoded video
(MP4) as well as FLV video.

 Tip
You can’t preview your video on the Stage in Animate CC. You
must test your movie (Control > Test) to see your video play within
the video component.
Individual properties are listed in the left column, and their corresponding values
are listed in the right column. Select one of the videos on the Stage, and then
choose from among the following options:
 Note
The video files, the 11_workingcopy.swf file, and the skin file are
all required for your zoo kiosk project to work. The skin file is
published in the same folder as your SWF file.
autoPlay: When selected, the video plays automatically. When deselected,
the video is paused on the first frame.
skinAutoHide: Select this option to hide the controller and display it only
when users roll their mouse cursor over the video.
Using the HTML5 Canvas Video component
To display video in an HTML5 Canvas document, use the
Video component, which is very similar to the FLVPlayback
component that you learned about in this lesson.
You must add the Video component to the Stage from the

Components panel yourself. In contrast to ActionScript 3.0 or
AIR documents, there is no Import wizard to take you
through the steps to add video. But the process is
straightforward.
To add video in an HTML5 Canvas document, open the
Components panel (Window > Components) and expand the
Video category.
Drag the Video component from the Components panel to the
Stage. The Properties panel, in the Component Parameters
section, displays the properties for video playback with the
Video component.
Click the Edit button (pencil icon) next to the source in the
Component Parameters section of the Properties panel.
The Content Path dialog box opens. Enter the path to the

H.264-encoded video file (.mp4), or select the folder icon to
navigate to the video file on your computer. Animate will
retrieve the correct dimensions of your video. Use the
playback and UI options in the Properties panel to change
how the video plays from a browser.
skin: This displays the name of your current skin file. Click the name to
open the Select Skin dialog box and make another choice from the Skin
menu.
skinBackgroundAlpha: To change the transparency of the skin, enter a
decimal value from 0 (totally transparent) to 1 (totally opaque).
skinBackgroundColor: To change the color of the skin, click the color
chip and select a new color.
source: This displays the name and location of the video file that Animate
seeks to play. To change either of those, click the file information.
In the Content Path dialog box that appears, enter a new filename or click
the Folder icon to choose a new file to play. The path is relative to the
location of your Animate file.
Adding a Video Without Playback Controls
For the various animal videos, you show the playback controls so that the reader
can pause, rewind, and play the video again to hear the information about each
animal. But sometimes you want to display a video file that doesn’t include
controls for a more seamless, integrated experience. For this project, the zoo
director will automatically pop up at the beginning to give an introduction. The
video will still play within the FLVPlayback component, but the controls will be
hidden.
You’ll import the video file, which is already encoded properly into H.264
format.
Importing the video clip
Now you’ll use the Import Video wizard to import the Popup.mp4 file.
1. Select frame 1 in the videos layer.
2. Choose File > Import > Import Video.
3. In the Import Video wizard, select On Your Computer > Load External
Video With Playback Component, and click Browse. Select the

Popup.mp4 file in the Lesson11/11Start folder and click Open.
4. Click Next or Continue.
5. Choose None for the skin. Click Next or Continue.
No skin means that there are no playback controls for the video.
However, the video still uses the Video component to play.
6. Click Finish to place the video.

The video of the zoo director with a black background appears on the
Stage. Move the video so that its bottom edge lines up with the top edge
of the red bar above the sound buttons. Make X=45 in the Properties
panel.
 Note
If you don’t stop one video before navigating to another
keyframe containing a second video, the audio can overlap.
One way to prevent overlapping sounds is to use the
command SoundMixer.stopAll() to stop all sounds before
starting a new video. The ActionScript code in the first
keyframe of the actions layer in your 11_workingcopy.fla
file contains the correct code to stop all sounds before
navigating to a new animal video.

7. Choose Control > Test.
After the musical introduction, the zoo director appears and gives a brief
talk. If your video does not play, make sure that your video file is in the
same folder as your FLA project file.
Congratulations, your project is done! In the last lesson, you’ll learn
how to publish your projects for delivery to your audience, whether that
is a video file, a website, or a stand-alone application like this zoo kiosk
project.
 Note
At the time of this writing, a bug in Animate causes the size
information of new instances of a video component to be
unrecognized when navigating between different
keyframes. Hence, the animal videos may appear smaller
because of the initial video, popup.mp4. A workaround is to
insert a blank keyframe between video component instances
on the video layer, as shown.

1 To edit the length of a sound clip, select the keyframe that contains it and click
the Edit Sound Envelope button in the Properties panel. Then move the time
slider in the Edit Envelope dialog box to clip the sound from the front or from
the end.
2 A skin is the combination of functionality and appearance of video controls,
such as Play, Fast Forward, and Pause buttons. You can choose from a wide
array of combinations with the buttons in different positions, and you can
customize the skin with a different color or level of transparency. If you don’t
want viewers to be able to control the video, select None from the Skin menu.
3 To play video with the Animate video playback component, video files must
be encoded in the H.264 format. Adobe Media Encoder CC, a separate
application, allows you to import many kinds of media types, and trim, crop,
and export to an H.264-encoded MP4 video file.
4 The FLVPlayback component is required to play external H.264-encoded
videos from an ActionScript 3.0 or AIR document. The Video component is
required to play external H.264-encoded videos from an HTML5 Canvas
document. You can add either component to the Stage from the Components
panel, or you can use the Import Video wizard for ActionScript 3.0 or AIR
documents.
5 To change the kind of controls available or the design of the video playback
interface, choose a different skin from the Component Parameters panel.

12. Publishing
Lesson overview

This lesson will take about one and a half hours to complete. Please log in
to your account on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this
chapter, or go to the Getting Started section at the beginning of this book
and follow the instructions under “Accessing the Lesson Files and Web
Edition.”

Use the various document types in Adobe Animate CC to create content that
targets a variety of platforms and uses, including HTML5 multimedia for the
web browser, multimedia for Flash Player, desktop applications, high-
definition video, or mobile device apps. Put your content everywhere while
leveraging Animate’s powerful and familiar animation and drawing tools.
Understanding Publishing
Publishing is the process that creates the file or files that are required to play
your final Adobe Animate CC project for your viewers. Keep in mind that
Animate CC is the authoring application, which is a different environment from
that on which your viewers experience your movie. In Animate CC, you author
content, which means you’re creating art and animation and adding text, videos,
sound, buttons, and code. In the target environment, such as a desktop browser
or a mobile device, your viewers watch the content when it plays back, or runs.
So developers make a distinction between “author-time” and “runtime”
environments.

 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson
to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now.
See “Getting Started” at the beginning of the book.
Animate can publish content to various runtime environments, and your desired
runtime environment determines the Animate document that you choose when
you begin a project.
Sometimes a single document type can publish content for multiple runtime
environments. For example, an ActionScript 3.0 document can export a high-
definition video or a web page for Flash Player.
Document types
You learned about the various Animate document types in Lesson 1, and you’ve
worked with a few of them throughout the projects in this book. For example,
you started an HTML5 Canvas document for Lesson 2, an ActionScript 3.0
document for Lesson 7, and an AIR for Desktop document for Lesson 11. Each
project publishes a different set of files for their targeted runtime environment,
but each project is saved as an FLA (Animate Document) or XFL
(Uncompressed Animate Document) file that you edit in Animate CC.
In this lesson, you’ll explore various publishing options for the document types
in greater detail.
Runtime environments
If an ActionScript 3.0 document is published to SWF and is played back with
Flash Player in a desktop web browser, then Flash Player is the runtime
environment for that ActionScript 3.0 document. Flash Player 26 is the latest
version and supports all the new features in Animate CC. Flash Player is
available as a free plug-in from the Adobe website for all the major browsers and
platforms.
 Note
The ActionScript 3.0 document also supports publishing content as
a projector for either macOS or Windows. A projector plays as a
stand-alone application on the desktop, without needing a browser.
By the end of 2020, however, Adobe will no longer support Flash Player for web

browsers. Increasingly, major browsers automatically block Flash Player, and
readers must enable the plug-in manually. For these reasons, it’s best to use
ActionScript 3.0 documents to create animation assets for export (as HD video,
sprite sheets, or PNG sequences) or for projectors (covered in this lesson).
If you want to target web browsers without requiring Flash Player, then begin
your Animate project with an HTML5 Canvas or WebGL document. To integrate
interactivity into an HTML5 Canvas or WebGL document, you use JavaScript
rather than ActionScript. You can add JavaScript directly in the Actions panel or
by using the Actions code wizard in the Actions panel.
Adobe AIR is another runtime environment. AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime)
runs content directly from your desktop, without the need for a browser. When
you publish your content for AIR, you can make it available as an installer that
creates a stand-alone application, or you can build the application with the
runtime already installed, known as “captive runtime.”
You can also publish AIR applications as mobile apps that can be installed and
run on Android devices and on iOS devices such as the Apple iPhone or iPad,
whose browsers do not support Flash Player.
 Tip
When you change the settings in the Publish Settings dialog box,
Animate saves them with the document.
 Note
Not all features are supported across all document types. For
example, WebGL documents don’t support text and HTML5 Canvas
documents don’t support the 3D Rotation and Translation tools.
Unsupported tools are grayed out.
Converting to HTML5 Canvas
You may have many older animations that you created as an ActionScript 3.0
document that a client wants to use as HTML5 animations. Don’t worry; you
don’t have to redo all your work. Fortunately, Animate CC includes options for
converting ActionScript 3.0 documents into HTML5 Canvas documents so your
animations can reach the widest audience.
There are two approaches to creating an HTML5 Canvas document with

Animate assets. First, you can simply create a new HTML5 Canvas document
and copy and paste the layers from one file to your new file. Second, you can
open your ActionScript 3.0 document and choose File > Convert To > HTML5
Canvas. Animate makes the conversion, and you can save your new file as an
HTML5 Canvas document.
 Note
Remember that an ActionScript 3.0 document doesn’t necessarily
contain ActionScript 3.0. An ActionScript 3.0 document is simply
an Animate document that publishes for Flash Player in a browser
by default. An ActionScript 3.0 document can consist of animation
only.
Converting an ActionScript 3.0 document to an HTML5 Canvas
document
You’ll convert an animation that you built as an ActionScript 3.0 document in a
previous lesson to an HTML5 Canvas document.
1. Open the 12Start_convert.fla file in the 12Start folder.

The project is the completed animated promotional piece for the
fictional movie Double Identity from a previous lesson. The
ActionScript 3.0 document contains bitmaps and motion tweens with
changes in position, scale, color effects, 3D effects, and filters.
The file targets Flash Player. The frame rate is set at 30 frames per
second, with a black Stage fixed at a generous 1280 pixels in width and
787 pixels in height.
2. Choose File > Convert To > HTML5 Canvas.
Animate asks you where to save the new converted file.
3. Click Save to save the file in the 12Start folder.
Animate duplicates your content into a new HTML5 Canvas document
and saves a new file. The new HTML5 Canvas document contains your

converted content.
4. View the warnings in the Output panel.
The Output panel displays the following warning:
* 3D cannot be imported in HTML5 Canvas document.
The HTML5 Canvas document does not support either the 3D Rotation
tool or the 3D Translation tool, so the tween does not display. Keep an
eye out for the messages in the Output panel to make sure you
understand how Animate handles the transition of your content from
Flash Player to HTML5, and so that you know what features cannot be
ported over. Often, you’ll have to do additional edits to your animation
after each conversion.
5. Choose Control > Test to test the converted content.
Animate exports HTML5 and JavaScript and displays the animation in a
browser. The converted animation plays, showing all the motion tweens,
including the nested animations of the idling cars. The 3D animation of
the title, which is unsupported, appears at the end without any animated

effects. In addition, the Blur filter does not animate, which is another
limitation of the HTML5 Canvas document.
The Output panel displays additional warnings regarding features
included in the animation.
Publishing for HTML5
HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML specification for marking up web
pages for the browser. HTML5, along with CSS3 and JavaScript, is the modern
standard for creating content for the web on the desktop, mobile phones, and
tablets. Choosing the HTML5 Canvas document type in Animate targets
HTML5 as the published runtime and outputs a collection of HTML5 and
JavaScript files.
What is HTML5 Canvas?
Canvas refers to the canvas element, a tag in HTML5 that allows JavaScript to
render and animate 2D graphics. Animate CC relies on the CreateJS JavaScript
libraries to generate the graphics and animations inside the canvas element of
the HTML5 project.
What is CreateJS?
CreateJS is a suite of JavaScript libraries that enable rich, interactive content
with HTML5. CreateJS itself is a collection of several separate JavaScript
libraries: EaselJS, TweenJS, SoundJS, and PreloadJS.
EaselJS is a library that provides a display list that allows you to work
with objects on the canvas in the browser.
TweenJS is a library that provides the animation features.
SoundJS is a library that provides functionality for playing audio in the
browser.
PreloadJS is a library that manages and coordinates the loading of
content.
With CreateJS, Animate CC generates all the necessary JavaScript code to
represent your images, graphics, symbols, animations, and sounds on the Stage.
Animate also outputs dependent assets, such as images and sounds. You can
easily configure how those image and sound assets are organized in the publish
settings.
You can also include your own JavaScript commands directly in the Actions

panel to control your animation. Those JavaScript commands get exported in the
JavaScript files.
Learn more about the CreateJS JavaScript libraries at www.createJS.com.
Exporting to HTML5
The process to export your animation to HTML5 and JavaScript is
straightforward.
1. Choose File > Publish.
Animate exports the animation as HTML and JavaScript files and saves
them in the same folder as your FLA file (according to the default
Publish Settings options).
2. Double-click the HTML file, named 12Start_convert_HTML5
Canvas.html.
Your default browser opens and plays the animation.
Understanding the exported files
This animated sequence uses bitmap images. Images imported into the Animate
library must be exported so that they are accessible to the HTML and JavaScript
documents.
1. Examine the folder on your desktop where you saved your Animate file,
12Start_convert_HTML5 Canvas.fla.
Animate creates an HTML file, as well as a JavaScript file that contains
the code that animates all the image assets.
2. In addition, Animate has created a folder named images. Inside the
images folder are all the bitmap assets for the animation saved as a
single PNG image. The JavaScript code in your exported documents
dynamically loads just the images that it needs to display from the
single PNG image, called a sprite sheet.

To share your HTML5 animation over the web, you need to upload the
HTML file, the JavaScript file, and the images folder to your server.
Point your readers to the HTML5 document to have them see your
animation. You can rename the HTML5 document, but do not rename
the JavaScript file, the images folder, or the sprite sheet inside the folder.
The HTML5 document references those files, and if you rename them,
they can’t be found, and your animation won’t work.
Supported features
The HTML5 Canvas document does not support all Animate CC
features. Fortunately, the Output panel displays warnings about any
features in your Animate file that can’t be successfully exported.
Animate also disables any features that won’t export successfully to
HTML5 and JavaScript. For example, the 3D Rotation and 3D
Translation tools in the Tools panel are grayed out to indicate that
3D rotations and translations are not supported in an HTML5
Canvas document. Many of the blending modes and some Filter
effects are not supported either.
Publish settings
The Publish Settings dialog box lets you change where your files are saved and
how they are saved.
1. Click Publish Settings in the Properties panel, or choose File > Publish
Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box.

2. On the Basic tab, do one or more of the following:
Deselect Loop Timeline if you want the Timeline to play only
once.
Click the folder icon next to the Output Name field to save your
published files to a different folder or under a different filename.
Change the paths next to the Export Assets options if you want to
save your assets to a different folder. The Export Image Assets
checkbox must be selected if your file contains images, and
Export Sound Assets must be selected if your file contains
sounds.
Select Center Stage to center-align your Animate project in the
browser window. You can use the menu next to the option to
choose to center your movie Horizontally, Vertically, or Both.
Select Make Responsive to have your Animate project respond to
changes in the browser window dimensions, and use the menu
next to the option to choose whether the project responds to
changes in window height, window width, or both. The Scale To
Fill Visible Area option determines how your project fills the

available space in the browser window.
Select Include Preloader. This option includes a standard small
looping animation that plays to let users know that files are being
downloaded before the animation can begin.
3. Select the Advanced tab.
Click Include JavaScript In HTML if you want to publish a single file
that includes all the necessary JavaScript and HTML code for your file.
If you choose this option, Animate will overwrite the exported file each
time you publish.
Deselect the Overwrite HTML File On Publish checkbox if you want to
preserve the HTML file and simply change the JavaScript code that gets
generated that drives your animations.
The Hosted Libraries option tells your published file where to find the
CreateJS JavaScript libraries. When the option is selected, your
published file points to a CDN (content distribution network) at
http://code.createjs.com to download the libraries. You must have an
Internet connection for your animation to work when this option is
selected. When the Hosted Libraries option is deselected, Animate
includes the CreateJS JavaScript libraries as separate documents that
must accompany your project files.
Leave all the other Advanced JavaScript options at their default settings.

4. Select the Spritesheet tab.
 Note
You can publish a transparent Stage from an HTML5
Canvas document. In the Properties panel, in the Properties
area, choose the selection with a diagonal red line,
indicating “no color” for the Stage.
Select Combine Image Assets Into Spritesheets if you want to create a
single image file for all the bitmaps that you’ve imported into your
library. An HTML5 web page can load a single image file and retrieve
specific portions of the image more quickly than it can load multiple
smaller images.
Select a Format option for the exported image, and set the quality, size,
and background color for the image. If you choose a size that’s too small
to fit the images in your library, Animate will publish multiple sprite
sheets as needed.
5. Click OK to save all your settings. Close the file; you won’t be needing
it again for this lesson.
 Note
If you select the Combine Into Spritesheets option on the

Basic tab (in the Export Image Assets section), the
Combine Image Assets Into Spritesheets option will also be
selected in the Spritesheet tab, and vice versa.
Publishing a Desktop Application
You may want to distribute your movie to run without a browser.
You can output your movie as an AIR file, which installs an application on the
user’s desktop. Adobe AIR is a robust runtime environment that supports a
broader range of technologies.
Viewers must download the free Adobe AIR runtime from the Adobe website at
http://get.adobe.com/air/. Alternatively, you can output an AIR project with the
Captive Runtime option, which includes the AIR runtime so that your audience
doesn’t need to download anything additional.
Creating an AIR application
Adobe AIR allows your viewers to see your Animate content on their desktop as
an application. You’ll recall that in Lesson 11, the final project was a desktop
application of an interactive zoo kiosk. In this section, you’ll specify the
necessary publish settings to create a desktop application of a restaurant guide.
1. Open 12Start_restaurantguide.fla.
This is the same interactive restaurant guide that you created in a
previous lesson, with a few modifications to the background image.
2. In the Properties panel, in the Publish section, note that AIR 26.0 For
Desktop is chosen from the Target menu.
3. Click the Edit Application Settings button (wrench icon) next to the
Target menu.

The AIR Settings dialog box appears.
4. Examine the settings on the General tab.
The Output File field shows the filename of the published AIR installer
as 12Start_restaurantguide.air. The Output As options provide three
ways to create an AIR application. The first choice, AIR Package,
should be selected; here is a description of what each option does:
AIR Package creates a platform-independent AIR installer.
Windows Installer (Windows)/Mac Installer (Mac) creates a
platform-specific AIR installer.
Application With Runtime Embedded creates an application
without an installer or the need for the AIR runtime to be
installed on the end user’s desktop.
5. In the App Name (Windows) or Name (macOS) field, enter Meridien
Restaurant Guide.

This will be the name of your published application.
6. From the Window Style menu, choose Custom Chrome (Transparent).
Custom Chrome (Transparent) creates an application that has no
interface or frame elements (known as chrome) and that has a
transparent background.
7. Click the Signature tab at the top of the AIR Settings dialog box.

Creating an AIR application requires a certificate so that users can
identify and trust the developer of the Animate content. For this lesson,
you won’t need an official certificate, so you can create your own self-
signed certificate.
8. Click the Create (Windows) or New (macOS) button next to Certificate.
9. Enter your information in the empty fields. You can use Meridien Press
for Publisher Name, Digital for Organization Unit, and Interactive for
Organization Name. Enter your own password in both password fields,
and then enter meridienpress.p12 in the Save As field. Click the
Folder/Browse button to save it in the same folder in which your .FLA
file is saved. Click Save and then OK.

Animate creates a self-signed certificate (.p12) file on your computer.
 Tip
You can also open the AIR Settings dialog box from the
Publish Settings dialog box. Click the Player Settings
button (wrench icon) next to the Target menu.
Animate automatically fills out the path to your .p12 file in the
Certificate field. Make sure that the Password field is filled (the
password must match the one you used to create the certificate), and that
the Remember Password For This Session and Timestamp options are
selected.
10. Now click the Icons tab at the top of the AIR Settings dialog box.

 Note
If you open an FLA file that was created on another
computer, Animate may warn you that your computer
doesn’t have the same fonts that were used to build the file.
Click OK in the alert dialog box to accept the substitute
fonts suggested by Animate.
11. Select icon 128 × 128, and click the folder icon.
12. Navigate to the AppIconsForPublish folder inside the 12Start folder,
select the restaurantguide.png file provided for you, and click Open.
The image in the restaurantguide.png file will be the application icon on
the desktop.

13. Click the Advanced tab at the top of the AIR Settings dialog box.
14. Under Initial Window Settings, enter 0 for the X field and 50 for the Y
field.

When the application launches, it will appear flush to the left side of the
screen and 50 pixels from the top.
15. Click Publish and then click OK.
Animate creates an AIR installer (.air).
Installing an AIR application
The AIR installer is platform-independent, but it requires that the AIR runtime

be installed on the user’s system.
1. Double-click the AIR installer that you just created,
12Start_restaurantguide.air.
The Adobe AIR Application Installer opens and asks to install the
application. Since you used a self-signed certificate to create the AIR
installer, Adobe warns of a potential security risk due to an unknown
and untrusted developer. (Since you can trust yourself, you’re safe to
proceed!)
2. Click Install, and then click Continue to proceed with the installation at
the default settings.
The application called Meridien Restaurant Guide is installed on your
computer and automatically opens.

Notice that the application is positioned at the far left edge of your
desktop, 50 pixels (between one-quarter and one-half inch, depending on
the resolution of your display) down from the top edge, as you specified
in the AIR Settings dialog box. Note, too, that the Stage is transparent,
so your graphic elements float over the desktop, much like the
appearance of other applications.
3. Quit the application by pressing Alt+F4 (Windows)/Command+Q
(macOS).
Creating a projector
In some cases—for example, if you don’t want to deal with an app that requires
installation and all the accompanying security issues—you may want to use a
low-tech and simpler distribution method. A projector is a self-contained file that
includes the Flash Player runtime so that your audience can simply double-click
the projector icon to play and view your multimedia content.
You can publish either a macOS or Windows projector from an ActionScript 3.0
or AIR document. However, unlike when you’re creating an AIR application,
with a projector you don’t have publishing options such as choosing thumbnails
for the app icon, or specifying a transparent background or initial position when
the app is launched.
1. Open 12Start_restaurantguide.fla.
2. Choose File > Publish Settings.

The Publish Settings dialog box opens.
3. Under Other Formats in the left column, select Mac Projector, Win
Projector, or both. Windows projectors have the file extension .exe, and
Mac projectors have the file extension .app.
4. Specify the filename and location where you want Animate to save the
projector. Each projector (Mac and Windows) needs a unique filename,
so highlight each option to enter it.
5. Click Publish.
Animate creates the selected projector or projectors in the output
location, with a filename that matches the Output Name field. Click OK.
6. Double-click the projector file.

The restaurant guide opens as a separate application on your desktop.
Compare your projector application with your AIR application. Close
the file, since you won’t need it again for this lesson.
 Note
Any dependent assets, such as video files, must also be
included with your projector so that it plays correctly.
Animate does not embed those dependent files into the
projector.
Publishing WebGL animations
WebGL is a technology that uses JavaScript to render graphics—
especially 3D graphics—in a web browser. WebGL uses hardware
acceleration to render graphics, potentially streamlining the display
of complex graphics. Use the Animate WebGL document type to
create flat graphics and animation for export as WebGL assets. Your
output files consist of various JavaScript files (including JSON files,
which are a specific kind of JavaScript file for storing data—JSON
stands for JavaScript Object Notation) and image assets.
The Animate WebGL document type is limited (it doesn’t support
3D transformations, text, or masks), but keep an eye on WebGL as
both the technology and the Animate document type develop.

Publishing to Mobile Devices
You can also publish Animate content to mobile devices running on iOS (such as
the iPhone or iPad) or on Android. To publish Animate content to a mobile
device, you target AIR for iOS or AIR for Android to create an application that
viewers download and install on their devices.
Testing a mobile app
Creating an app for mobile devices is more complicated than creating an
application for the desktop because you have to obtain specific certificates for
development and distribution. For example, if you want to upload apps to the
iTunes Store, Apple requires that you pay a yearly subscription to be a certified
developer. Developing for an Android device requires a one-time fee. Moreover,
you have to factor in the additional time and effort required for testing and
debugging on a separate device. However, Animate CC provides several ways to
facilitate testing content for mobile devices:
 Note
Testing an app on an iOS device requires that you be part of Apple’s
iOS Developer program, where you create development,
distribution, and provisioning certificates. The certificates allow you
to install apps on iOS devices for testing and upload apps to the
iTunes store.
You can use the mobile device simulator provided with Animate, the AIR
Debug Launcher, to test mobile interactions. The SimController that
accompanies the AIR Debug Launcher emulates interactions such as
tilting the device (using the accelerometer), touch gestures such as
swiping and pinching, and even geolocation functions.
For iOS devices, Animate can publish an AIR app to test in the native iOS
Simulator, which emulates the mobile app experience on your macOS
desktop.
Connect a mobile device to your computer with a USB cable and Animate
can publish an AIR app directly to your mobile device.
 Note
The iOS Simulator is part of Apple’s Xcode developer toolset,
which is available as a free download from Apple.

Simulating a mobile app
You’ll use the Adobe SimController and AIR Debug Launcher to simulate
mobile device interactions within Animate CC.
 Note
On Windows, a security warning may appear when you use the AIR
Debug Launcher. Click Allow Access to continue.
1. Open 12Start_mobileapp.fla.
The project is a simple application with four keyframes that announces
an imaginary sports challenge set in our familiar city of Meridien.
The project already contains ActionScript code that enables the viewer
to swipe the Stage left or right to go to the next or previous frames,
respectively.
Examine the code in the Actions panel. The code was added from the

Code Snippets panel, which includes dozens of code snippets for
interactivity on mobile devices.
2. In the Properties panel, notice that the target is set for AIR 26.0 for
Android.
3. Choose Control > Test Movie > In AIR Debug Launcher (Mobile),
which should already be selected.
The project publishes to a new window. In addition, the SimController
application, which provides options for interacting with the Animate
content, launches.
4. In the Simulator panel, click Touch And Gesture to expand that section.
5. Select Touch Layer.
The simulator overlays a transparent gray box on the Animate content to
simulate the touch surface of the mobile device.
6. Select Gesture > Swipe.

The simulator is now enabled to emulate a swipe interaction. The
instructions at the bottom of the panel detail how you can create the
interaction with just your mouse cursor.
7. On the touch layer over your Animate content, drag to the left, and then
let go of your mouse button.
The yellow dot represents the contact point on the touch layer of the
mobile device.

The project recognizes the swipe interaction, and the second keyframe
appears.
8. Swipe left and right.
Animate advances ahead one frame or moves back one frame,
respectively.
9. Close the window.
 Tip
You can change the opacity of the touch layer by changing the
Alpha value.
 Note
Don’t move the window that contains your Animate content (AIR

Debug Launcher, or ADL) when you’ve enabled the touch layer. If
you do, the touch layer won’t align with the ADL window, and you
won’t be able to accurately test your mobile interactions.
Next Steps
Congratulations! You’ve made it through the last of 12 lessons. By now you’ve
seen how Adobe Animate CC, in the right creative hands (yours!), has all the
features you need to produce media-rich interactive projects and animations that
publish to multiple platforms. You’ve completed these lessons—many of them
from scratch—so you understand how the various tools, panels, and code work
together for real-world applications.
But there’s always more to learn. Continue practicing your Animate skills by
creating your own animation or interactive site. Get inspired by seeking out
animation and multimedia projects on the web and exploring apps on mobile
devices. Expand your Animate knowledge by exploring the Adobe Animate
Help resources and other fine Adobe Press publications.

Review Answers

1 Author-time refers to the environment in which you build your Animate
content, such as Animate CC. Runtime refers to the environment in which
your Animate content plays back for your audience. The runtime for your
content can be Flash Player in a desktop browser or an AIR application on the
desktop or on a mobile device.
2 CreateJS is a suite of open source JavaScript libraries: EaselJS, TweenJS,
SoundJS, and PreloadJS. The JavaScript is required to drive the animation and
interactivity for your HTML5 Canvas project.
3 When you publish or test an HTML5 Canvas document, Animate exports all
the necessary JavaScript code to represent your images, graphics, symbols,
animations, and sounds on the Stage. It also exports an HTML file and
dependent assets, such as images and sounds.
4 When you convert one kind of Animate document into another, warnings will
appear in the Output panel to inform you about interactive or animation
features that may not have converted properly.
5 You can test your Animate project for a mobile device by testing it in the Air
Debug Launcher (Control > Test Movie > In AIR Debug Launcher [Mobile]).
The accompanying SimController allows you to simulate various mobile
interactions, such as pinches and swipes. You can also test your Animate
project by publishing it directly to a connected USB device (Android or iOS).
Lastly, you can test an iOS app in the native iOS Simulator (Control > Test
Movie > On iOS Simulator).
6 A code-signing certificate is a certified document that acts as your digital
signature. You purchase one from a certification authority. It provides a way
for your audience to authenticate your identity so they can confidently
download and install desktop AIR applications, or AIR apps for Android or
iOS.
