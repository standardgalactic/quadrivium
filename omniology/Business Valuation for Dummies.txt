Acknowledgments
Many of the people who contribute to the process of writing a book are 
unsung, so we’ll do the singing here.
We’d like to start by thanking Tom West of the Wilmington, North Carolina–
based Business Brokerage Press for graciously allowing us to reprint 
excerpts from his rule-of-thumb industry bible, the Business Reference Guide.
Darrell Dorrell of Lake Oswego, Oregon–based Financial Forensics was a 
font of information on the forensic accounting fi eld and a great storyteller 
regarding the criminal side of valuation and fi nance. Justin Cherfoli, managing 
director of the Dispute Advisory and Forensic Services Group of the 
Chicago-based fi nancial advisory fi rm, Stout Risius Ross, provided great 
guidance and harrowing commentary on what some families go through in 
the valuation process.
Above all, Mike Adhikari of Business ValueXpress and the Kellogg School 
of Management at Northwestern University was a great conduit to basic 
valuation knowledge and many of the sources within this book.
We couldn’t have done this book without substantial help and support on 
the For Dummies side of the street. Natalie Harris, Chrissy Guthrie, and Stacy 
Kennedy worked tireless hours to make this book a reality.
Lisa would also like to thank her agent, Marilyn Allen of the Allen O’Shea 
Literary Agency in Stamford, Connecticut.
Jim would like to thank his family: Brad Bates, Mary Ann Bates, Mary Agnes 
Bates, and Meredith Spiering. Without their love and support, his career 
would not have been possible. In addition, he would like to thank his colleagues 
at the Christman Group: Pete Christman, Rich Jackim, Jack Emmons, and 
Anneke Chamy. Their feedback, experience, and friendship are invaluable.

Introduction
N
o two businesses are exactly alike — even those that are part of a 
national chain with exactly the same sign on every door. Each business 
or outlet of a business has its own complexities that determine whether 
it’s worth a little . . . or a lot.
That’s why business valuation is actually a pretty complex affair for someone 
who’s never taken a finance class. If you go online or into a bookstore looking 
for books on business valuation, you’re likely to find volumes that are 
written more for people who’ve already been exposed to business finance, 
accounting, or management training. If you’re considering buying a business 
or have operated one for years without a lot of that training, we’re pretty 
sure that a complicated textbook isn’t what you need.
We think that valuation should be the first thing you think about before you 
make a move into or out of any business. Consider this book to be a starting 
point for a bright, well-informed future in buying or selling a business, 
because the dream of owning or selling a business should always begin with 
dedication to understanding the true value of what you’re buying. If we can 
give you an understanding of the basics of business valuation and of the tools 
and expertise you require to get the right valuation for the job, we’ll have 
accomplished our purpose.
About This Book
This book is very cautious because we think it should be.
We’ll state this upfront: This book will not make you qualified to handle 
most business valuation tasks by yourself. Nor will you have a complete 
background in business accounting or business law when you get to the 
last page. The purpose of Business Valuation For Dummies is to give you 
an overview of all the critical skills, issues, and methods involved in small-
business valuation without taking you through all the detailed theories 
and number crunching necessary to the process. Other, more-advanced 
resources are out there to show you those processes when you’re ready. But 
by the time you’re done with this book, you’ll know which basic processes, 
resources, experts, and tools you need so you can put together the fairest 
and most affordable valuation solution for the business in question.

2
Business Valuation For Dummies 
We tell you what various professionals do in the valuation process, but we 
don’t tell you that you can do their job. We also tell you the many steps you 
can follow to educate yourself about valuation in general and your target 
business in particular, as well as how to make the right decisions to get an 
accurate valuation of a business. For instance, you can consult resources, 
free or nearly free of charge, to build a baseline of the business you’re 
considering and then move on to the basics of valuing that kind of company. 
We tell you about those resources in this book, discussing rule-of-thumb 
valuation and other resources you can consult early in the process to start 
building knowledge. We encourage you to do this basic research before you 
even think about buying or selling a company. (And yes, even if you’ve owned 
a business for decades, you need to do this research before you sell!)
If we’ve done our job, this book will give you a thorough summary of all 
the steps in effective valuation and show you how to plan and execute that 
process. We give only two detailed examples of valuation in this book: one 
for the sale of a business and the other for a purchase. This way, you get a 
close-up look at how an isolated example works, which we think makes a lot 
more sense than attempting to generalize for every possible situation, which 
might mislead you.
This book adopts a holistic approach that involves expertise not only for 
business valuation but also for your personal and family finances. Why? 
The decision to buy or sell a business is a major life step; it’s not just about 
the business. Ownership is tied to one’s personal finances and family goals, 
and business valuation needs to tie into all those things. Even if you have a 
small business and a small family, getting advice tailored specifically to your 
circumstances is usually smart.
Last thing: Because one of the authors of this book is a valuation profes-
sional, you may say, “Oh, that’s why they keep saying to use an expert.” Keep 
in mind that we don’t say which experts you need to use; you have a choice. 
But anyone who wants to be in business needs to know that tax, valuation, 
legal, and finance issues are interconnected, and you need people with excel-
lent skills helping you manage these subjects if you don’t have the expertise 
yourself.
Conventions Used in This Book
When this book was printed, some Web addresses — which appear in 
monofont — may have needed to break across two lines of text. If that 
happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as 
hyphens) to indicate the break. When you use one of these Web addresses, 
just type exactly what you see in this book, pretending that the line break 
doesn’t exist.

 Introduction
We use italics to highlight new terms, and we follow them up with easy-to-
understand definitions.
What You’re Not to Read
If you want to lighten your reading load or just simplify your understanding 
of the concepts, take a pass on any text preceded by the Technical Stuff 
icon. Also, although we encourage you to check the chapters that have a 
significant amount of formulas and math in them (which we haven’t over-
done, by the way), you may want to take a break on those or just save them 
for last. Finally, you can skip the sidebars — gray boxes containing related 
but nonessential text — if you want to get straight to the good stuff.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is designed for two kinds of people: those who are thinking about 
buying a business and those who are considering selling one. We consider 
this book to be optimal for people who want to go into business for them-
selves for the first time, because it addresses the critical knowledge that all 
good businesspeople have: the ability to maximize value at all times. Yet if 
you’re planning to sell a business, we provide a planning outline to allow you 
to maximize the value of your business before the for-sale sign goes out front.
Here are a few assumptions we make about you, the reader, whether you 
want to buy or sell:
 
✓ You’re probably looking at a company of less (sometimes significantly 
less) than $5 million in annual revenues. This book focuses mainly on 
the purchase and sale of private companies — that is, companies that 
don’t trade daily on a major exchange.
 
✓ You have some experience with the business world. However, we don’t 
assume that you have a background in finance or valuation, which are 
frankly two different and very complex disciplines.
 
✓ More than anything, we assume that you don’t want to be taken to the 
cleaners on your first foray into business or your last decision with 
the business you own. Perhaps you’ve watched other people go into 
business, and you just know that they don’t have any idea what their 
business is truly worth; they’ve negotiated up or down with a seller, but 
they haven’t fully kicked the tires. That move isn’t the kind you want 
to make. You realize you need industry, financial, and operational 
knowledge to make the best decision.

Business Valuation For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Like all other For Dummies books, this book is divided into parts, and each 
part is divided into chapters. What follows is a summary of what you can see 
in each part of the book.
Part I: What Business Valuation Means
We start by telling you what business valuation is and why we think it’s 
the first thing you should understand about being in business. We talk about 
why valuation is such a challenge, and we give you the basic accounting 
approaches that experts take to uncover value — or the lack of it — in an 
organization. Last, we talk about the greatest valuation challenge today: how 
experts evaluate what intellectual property means to an organization.
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation 
Tools, Principles, and Resources
This part is where we spend the most time talking about paperwork, process, 
and expertise. We talk about what a valuation report looks like and what 
various professionals do in the valuation process; we offer a primer on 
financial statements and how they’re used in the valuation process. We 
also offer an important chapter that talks about rule-of-thumb valuation 
information — where it can help and where it can mislead.
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . .
People sell businesses for lots of reasons. They’re sick of running the 
business, for example; or they’ve made the business a rousing success that’s 
ripe for a nice price from a new owner; or they’re ready to retire or to 
pass on what they’ve built to the next generation. The reasons can vary, but 
one thing is clear: Planning for the sale of a business is something that you 
don’t do just a few months in advance. The planning takes years and is best 
thought of as part of a founder’s overall estate strategy. If you build a 
business, you want to get the best value for it in a way that allows you to 
enjoy the full rewards of what you created.

 Introduction
So if you’re trying to figure out what to do with a family-owned company, this 
part is for you. Family businesses supply an incredible amount of drama in 
the valuation process. This part also introduces a detailed case study on the 
sale of a fictional business.
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . .
Knowing about basic valuation issues is the key to making a deal. Buyers 
have to do their own planning for a transaction because they may be 
going into business for the first time or buying another company in a series 
of companies to complement existing business interests. And of course, 
buyers have their own succession and estate-planning issues to deal with. 
In this part, we discuss valuation issues for the buyer and feature another 
major detailed case study, this one on the purchase of a particular fictional 
business.
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning 
Things Over to the Valuation Experts
The purpose of this part is not to win business for valuation experts, even 
though we clearly believe that these chapters cover situations in which 
you need help. The idea is to communicate why the complexity of certain 
valuation situations should encourage you to seek help.
This part includes three chapters that discuss situations in which business 
owners definitely shouldn’t go it alone. Which situations did we choose? 
Divorce certainly qualifies because it endangers many family companies. 
Estate planning and gifting are tied in with the value of the family business; 
therefore, they need joint coordination. Finally, people need valuation advice 
when they’re preparing to attract outside investors to a business.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
These three chapters offer ten points of interest each on the following topics: 
reasons to consider a prenuptial agreement, elements to build into a partner-
ship agreement, and things to consider before transforming a conventional 
business to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).

Where to Go from Here
We really enjoyed writing this book. We particularly like the idea that we can 
get small-business people thinking about the importance of valuation early in 
the life of a business.
If you know nothing about the business valuation process, we suggest you 
start with Part I. But this is a reference book, so feel free to jump around a 
bit. For example, you can see how specific situations are handled in Part V, 
and if you want to see detailed case studies on valuations, by all means, head 
to Chapters 13 and 18.

Part I
What Business 
Valuation Means

In this part . . .
M
any people think that business valuation is all 
about getting to a price for a business, and that’s 
certainly a big part of it. But we think that valuation is the 
central concept of what makes a business a business — 
and that very few people really understand it. In this part, 
we discuss the reasons valuation happens in a business, 
and we introduce the accounting concepts in the process. 
Most importantly, we discuss valuing business ideas.

Chapter 1
The Value of Understanding 
Business Valuation
In This Chapter
▶ Why the price of a business is only half the story
▶ The importance of planning in valuation
▶ Basic due diligence
▶ Why families are so important in the process
You’re here for one of two big reasons: You have a business that you 
want to sell, or you want to buy a business. Very likely, the business in 
question is a small business (with less than $3 million in annual sales), and it 
may be the first and only business you ever own.
Before we go further, we want to pay you a compliment. Right now, you’re 
doing something that painfully few entrepreneurs do: thinking about what 
a company is actually worth before you make a major decision or take a 
major action. You’re already ahead of the game. And because you’re reading 
this book, you obviously know that business valuation is an important part of 
that game.
Business Valuation For Dummies is for people who want to understand value. 
This book can help you get your arms around the many tasks and variables 
involved in effective valuation of a company and help you decide what kind 
of help you should enlist to complete a deal. In this chapter, we discuss 
the importance of valuation, talk about doing research and calculating value, 
and include some notes on valuation experts and intellectual property. We 
wrap up with a discussion of passing a family business from one generation 
to the next.

Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Basic Tenets and the Importance 
of Valuation for Businesspeople
Everything has a value. Putting value in dollar terms is the cornerstone not 
only of running a business but also of investing in almost any form. Knowing 
how to arrive at a value for the physical and intrinsic characteristics of a 
business is essential to building wealth of all kinds.
To that end, people who invest in companies need to look beyond the 
current state of the business they own (or want to own) and consider what 
decisions they need to make to boost value. People who have experience 
in those industries are often best equipped to make those decisions, but it 
often helps to engage a business valuation expert for guidance. In this sec-
tion, we discuss the concept of value and note some of the main principles of 
business valuation.
Value differs from price
As the celebrated investor Warren Buffett once said, “Price is what you 
pay. Value is what you get.” We would add one more line: “If you do your 
homework.”
In business deals, most buyers and sellers have a singular focus on price — 
and price is hard to avoid. Negotiations ideally produce numbers that both 
sides can be happy with. But getting to the right price in any deal involves 
understanding what business assets are truly worth and then structuring 
a deal around financing and tax realities, which can be quite surprising to 
those who fail to plan.
Planning drives value
Creating value is a transformative topic in business planning and execution. 
If you’re creating a product, granted, that product is the focus of the business 
for customers and your employees. Creating value — long-term growth in 
asset value in a company you’ve built — is something you need to focus on, 
because a company is the sum of real and tangible assets, investments, ideas, 
and management talent.
If you can look at all those working parts of a business through the prism of 
value, the desire to determine and create value in a company can become a 
much more important driving force in its growth than simple profits and 
losses.

11
 Chapter 1: The Value of Understanding Business Valuation
 
Proper valuation takes time. People buy and sell businesses for a variety of 
reasons that aren’t all about business. For instance, they may make moves in 
and out of companies based on career goals. Others devote a lifetime to a 
business so they can finance their retirement or simply pass the business on 
to their kids as a legacy. All these motivations drive valuation and should 
require three to five years to account for owners’ estate, succession, and exit 
planning. We talk about the importance of planning throughout this book.
 
One of the best places to start finding out about the planning process for 
starting a business is the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Web site (www.
sba.gov).
No two valuations are exactly alike
No two businesses are exactly alike; neither are the goals and circumstances 
of business owners. You may be in any of a variety of situations, such as the 
following:
 
✓ You may be the child of a company founder, wondering whether you 
want to take over the company when she retires.
 
✓ You may be a corporate executive who’s ready to start a new career 
with a new business purchased with a cash buyout.
 
✓ You may be a worried sibling trying to figure out what to do with the 
family company because the company’s founder, your father, has died 
suddenly.
Valuation isn’t an exact science for another reason as well: The risk inherent 
in any business situation is far from static. Depending on the economy and 
the state of the industry the business operates in, the company may be under 
tremendous pressure to stay afloat, or it may have great opportunities for 
growth. Any time the economy goes through a major convulsion, people take 
a fresh look at what value means and at the realities of any deal. As we write 
this book, the nation is in the grip of a worldwide credit crisis — an economic 
slowdown that is redefining the values of a host of assets, from companies to 
private homes.
All these variables are one reason you won’t emerge from this book with 
the skills to do a top-to-bottom business valuation. Also, proper business 
valuation takes a lot of practice. People with finance degrees and long experi-
ence in accounting or other numbers-related fields aren’t always naturals 
at valuation, either. Don’t worry, though. This book does cover the ins and 
outs of business valuation and points out the areas in which you can handle 
valuation on your own — and those for which you should hire some help.

12
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Valuation isn’t a one-time deal
 
If you’re already operating a business to its fullest potential, valuation isn’t 
something you should put off until you’re ready to sell or close your doors. 
Most tax, business, and personal finance experts say that even if you’re 
years away from retirement — or years away from your next business idea — 
keeping your valuation numbers current is a good idea. This way, you can 
make changes and investments in the business so you can leave the business 
with the highest valuation possible.
A strategy of continual valuation tells you the following things:
 
✓ Whether selling your business or merging with another makes sense
 
✓ Whether you can make enough money from the sale of a business to 
support your retirement
 
✓ When you want to set a timetable for your kids or other family members 
to take over the business
 
✓ The optimal time to set up an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) as 
a way to pull money out of the business in a tax-advantaged way
How often should you run valuation numbers? Frankly, it varies based on 
need. With computerization, it’s easy for many businesses to program their 
numbers so they can keep a constant eye on their main value indicators that 
have been developed for any goal they have on their radar.
 
If you’re working with a business or tax planner, discuss the creation of a 
valuation system for your business, whether it’s something you access 
yourself or have an expert handle at regular intervals.
Seeing what the finished product looks like is a good starting point, so flip to 
Chapter 6 for a description of a typical valuation report.
The Basic Building Blocks 
for Calculating Value
The three top associations for valuation professionals are the American 
Society of Appraisers (ASA), the Institute of Business Appraisers (IBA), and 
the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts (NACVA). These 
organizations agree on three major approaches to business valuation:

13
 Chapter 1: The Value of Understanding Business Valuation
 
✓ The asset approach: Also known as the cost approach, this valuation 
approach is based on finding the fair market value of assets (the 
easiest ones to value are tangible assets) and deducting the liabilities 
to determine the net asset value or the net worth of the business.
 
✓ The market approach: This approach compares your company or a 
target company with similar companies. You can use comparisons 
to publicly traded companies or actual sales transactions for similar 
businesses. These valuations are frequently expressed in ratio form.
 
✓ The income approach: This approach focuses on the future economic 
benefits you’re anticipating from a business — better known as income. 
This amount is expressed in today’s dollars, and is also known as 
present value.
For more information on these three approaches, see Chapter 4. In this 
section, we discuss some of the basic ideas that go into calculating value.
Discount and capitalization rates: 
The numbers that really matter
Most of the number crunching that goes into valuation doesn’t take on real 
meaning until appropriate discount and capitalization rates are assigned to 
the valuation itself. These computations allow valuation to become much 
more meaningful in light of the business the company is in and the various 
attributes to its industry. We discuss these concepts in Chapter 6.
Doing your homework: Due diligence
The term due diligence means investigating a company with the cold eye that 
you should bring to any investment. For anyone doing the job, due diligence 
involves reading everything, asking plenty of questions inside and outside an 
organization, and generally leaving no stone unturned in finding out what 
makes a company tick and how much it’s truly worth.
Due diligence involves not only basic research and calculations, but also the 
ability to forecast how a company will do years from now.
Whether you’re a buyer (see Chapter 16) or a seller (see Chapter 12) — 
whether or not you’re enlisting help with a transaction — due diligence starts 
with your intentions toward any company. Both soft and hard skills are 
involved in valuing a business correctly, and in the chapters in Part I, we talk 

14
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
a great deal about the early stages of company research and what you can do 
to inform yourself about the worth of the business, even if you’ve never been 
in business before.
How rule of thumb enters 
into business valuation
Rule of thumb is a starting point for civilians in valuation — a way to get a 
general idea of what companies in certain industries are worth. The rest, you 
have to investigate thoroughly on your own and with the right help. But here 
are some key points concerning what you’re about to see.
Tom West is a founder, past president, and former executive director of the 
International Business Brokers Association (IBBA). For the past 18 years, 
he’s been the author of The Business Reference Guide, an annual bible on 
pricing for hundreds of categories of independent businesses and name-
brand franchises. In Chapter 9, we feature rule-of-thumb guidance for ten 
kinds of businesses from data West has compiled for the BRG and listings on 
his subscription Web site, Business Brokerage Press (www.bbpinc.com).
In West’s guide, rule-of-thumb guidance comes in two formats that most 
valuation experts recognize:
 
✓ Percentage of annual sales: If a business had total sales of $100,000 last 
year and the multiple for that business was 40 percent of annual sales, 
the price based on that particular rule of thumb would be $40,000.
 
✓ Multiple of earnings: An earnings multiplier makes the most sense to 
prospective buyers. It directly addresses the buyer’s motive to make 
money: to achieve a return on investment.
 
 In many small companies, this multiple is commonly used against what 
is known as seller’s discretionary earnings (SDE), which are earnings 
before accounting for the following items:
 
• Income taxes
 
• Nonrecurring income and expenses
 
• Nonoperating income and expenses
 
• Depreciating an amortization
 
• Interest expense or income
 
• Owner’s total compensation for one owner/operator after 
adjusting the total compensation of all owners to market value
Chapter 9 gives you more details on how rule-of-thumb guidance applies in 
specific business situations.

15
 Chapter 1: The Value of Understanding Business Valuation
Getting Expert Help
The authors of this book share a very precise bias: We believe that no one 
should attempt this process alone unless he or she has been trained and 
licensed to value companies, plain and simple. It’s a very good idea to 
enlist help wherever you’re in the valuation process. Valuation experts can 
help a business owner locate key benchmark data and other information that 
shows the worth of companies demonstrating the best practices and best 
performance in an industry.
Valuation experts (the best ones, anyway) aren’t generalists. They do 
have general skills in finance that allow them to make mathematical 
calculations — known as tests — that are relevant to finding what particular 
assets are worth. But certain valuation professionals specialize in specific 
industries and deals. Some work with manufacturing assets, for example, 
whereas others work with intellectual property; others handle mergers and 
acquisitions for companies of a particular size.
The various experts in the valuation process include the following:
 
✓ Appraisers and valuation experts
 
✓ Accountants and forensic accountants
 
✓ Attorneys
 
✓ Business brokers
We provide a few case studies in this book (especially in Chapters 13 and 18) 
that illustrate what we believe to be true: Owners lie (intentionally or unin-
tentionally) about their results, and not every business owner is equipped to 
see through such obfuscation. Even in fairly small deals, much opportunity 
exists for assets to be overvalued or hidden.
Plenty of business owners resist getting help with valuation because that 
help costs money. But unless you have significant experience in business or 
in valuation finance, getting someone who can help you confirm that the 
asset value of that business is real is a good idea. We encourage you to ask 
people who work in business valuation plenty of questions, because you 
need to know that these people understand what you need to value and for 
what purpose.
You can find detailed books on business negotiation, but unless you can 
match valuation knowledge with the process of negotiating for the business 
itself, you may not be fully prepared to make or receive an offer by yourself. 
In Chapters 13 and 18, we offer case studies that show how buyers and 
sellers go through the process of valuation. In Chapter 18, we also talk about 
how mistakes in valuation can damage a deal.

16
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
The Move toward Intangible 
Asset Valuation
Perhaps the greatest philosophical debate going on in the valuation industry 
is how to place a value on companies that derive most of their asset value 
from intellectual property. We talk about that debate in some depth in 
Chapter 5.
Some people argue that old formulas and approaches to valuation have been 
blown out of the water by the transition to a world that’s overrun by Internet-
driven companies that outsource much of the production of things you can 
touch. We don’t. Our position is that whether a company’s most valuable 
assets are sitting on the shop floor or inside the minds of some really smart 
people, those assets need to produce one thing to prove value: profit.
Today, as before, the central identity of an asset is its capability to generate a 
return. Yet businesses that deal in intellectual property — everything from 
old-line medical practices to cutting-edge software — need to keep their eye 
on the production of real earnings.
Family Businesses: Important 
Valuation Targets
We spend a lot of time throughout this book talking about families because 
they control the lion’s share of business wealth in the U.S.
 
In 2004, Insurance Journal estimated that approximately $40.6 trillion will 
change hands by 2052, as Baby Boomers pass their accumulated assets on to 
their heirs. A portion of that wealth transfer will be due to the deaths or retire-
ments of the owners of closely held or family businesses. Yet according to a 
2006 report in Business Week, the oldest Boomers aren’t so willing to die in the 
saddle. Many owners in their 50s and 60s are willing to move aside after 
they’ve made enough money to retire and possibly start new careers.
Many founders or previous-generation leaders are seeing retirement as a 
chance for new possibilities, so they’re willing to get out of the way of the 
next generation. But are they willing to plan for the smooth transition to the 
next generation, with clear leadership roles defined and wealth-management 
issues settled before they go? Not so much. According to a 2003 Raymond

 Chapter 1: The Value of Understanding Business Valuation
Institute/MassMutual survey, 19 percent of family-business participants 
hadn’t completed any estate planning other than writing a will, and only 37 
percent had written a strategic plan for their companies.
 
Working with family members from the time they’re young to gauge their 
interest and involvement in the business will be crucial to valuation later on. 
Enthusiastic and talented employees who just happen to be relatives tend to 
be much more dedicated to growing the company than those who use the 
family business as a fallback employer. Family members who know where they 
stand as participants or nonparticipants in the family business are likelier to 
pull together and do what’s best for the business as transitions occur.

usiness valuation is about as dry a term as you find in finance (admit 
it — didn’t your eyelids flutter a little when you read this book’s title?). 
But when you start looking at the reasons people want to value a business, 
things start to get sexy.
The motivations behind getting a valuation right go beyond finding out 
whether a mom-and-pop store is worth what Mom and Pop really say it is. 
Most business valuation efforts are tied to finding a number that describes 
wealth, no question. But dig a little deeper, and you find some very real 
emotion behind the process: One person wants to realize his dream of 
owning a business. Another realizes her dream is failing (or maybe her 
creditors are trying to convince her that it is). A longtime family company 
finally runs out of heirs willing to take over, and it’s time for the business 
to be sold or split up. A husband and wife divorce, and both want their 
fair share.
Yet business valuation isn’t an idea only for existing companies. It’s also an 
important concept in buying a new company or developing a business idea. 
Why? Because if a business doesn’t produce value for customers, suppliers, 
and owners on a day-to-day basis, it’s just not a business. This chapter 
discusses the concept of value as a starting point for anyone who wants to 
buy an existing business or start a new one. It also covers valuation for when 
you seek a loan to support an existing business or for when you need to sell 
or pass the company on to someone else.

20
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Exploring Reasons for 
Wanting a Business
Many people start or buy their business with money they have in their 
pockets (or more realistically, a sizable bank account) or money they 
get from others. The money from others may be in the form of loans, 
gifts, or cash exchanged for partial ownership in their new company. The 
money in their pockets may be from savings, an inheritance, or possibly 
a company buyout.
No matter where the funds come from, knowing the unbiased value of a 
business concept is critical. You may think that your business is worth a lot 
or that the business you want to buy or start is great. But if people with 
money to offer don’t see what you do, how much is it really worth?
The first step in valuation is determining the motivation for the valuation. In 
the following sections, you can find some prime motivations for valuation 
that you’ll likely find familiar.
It’s time for a new career
 
Whether facing a bad economy, a bad boss, or an early buyout, plenty of 
people think about self-employment. According to 2005 figures from the 
Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, approximately 10 percent of the U.S. 
workforce is employed in businesses they own, and 0.29 percent of the total 
adult population starts new businesses each month.
Unquestionably, new businesses provide new jobs. But how secure are those 
jobs? Valuation is one way to determine the level of risk one undertakes in 
buying, selling, or starting up a company.
And how many new entrepreneurs do a professional, detailed valuation of a 
target before they take this chance? Well, no firm figures exist, but it’s a safe 
bet that the answer is “not enough.” According to the U.S. Small Business 
Administration in 2005, two-thirds of new employer establishments survive 
at least two years, and 44 percent survive at least four years — and the 
numbers fall from there.
The role of valuation in a career context isn’t one-dimensional. You’re not 
just talking about valuing a company so you’ll have someplace to go every 
day. You want to know whether this company can provide a steadily increas-
ing income stream that will not only keep your personal finances ahead of 
inflation but also give you and your family financial security in the short term 
and the possibility of a legacy in the long term.

21
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
 
If you’re seeking a career change, it’s not enough that a business works well 
enough to keep the lights on, support its employees, and stay competitive in 
the marketplace; it has to support you from a financial standpoint and engage 
you from a career standpoint. You’re not just valuing a business; you’re 
valuing a career and a financial future. Can you see yourself working many 
hours in this field and guiding the business through good times and bad? Can 
you see it building you a better life at home? A thorough valuation process 
answers those questions, too.
You’re fulfilling a dream
When your business plans are tied up with fulfilling a dream, valuation gets 
emotional — and therefore a bit dangerous. Absolutely nothing is wrong with 
Are you ready to be in business?
If you’ve never had the experience of owning a business, the first questions to ask have nothing to 
do with valuation. Consider this list of questions to ask yourself if you’ve never operated an inde-
pendent business:
Question
Yes
No
Are you an organizer? A self-starter?
Can you tolerate a variety of personalities?
Can you make solid decisions quickly?
Are you in good health?
Do you understand business finance?
Can you work 10- to 12-hour days with no weekends?
Have you discussed all the challenges of owning a business with your 
family?
Have you created a business plan?
Will you have to borrow money?
Will you have investors in the business?
Do you really believe in your ideas?
Have you ever hired anyone?
Have you ever talked to anyone in this industry?
Have you thought about where you’ll locate the business?
Answering yes to these questions is important because they’re true indicators of how prepared 
you are to build a company. If you find that you’re answering no to more than a few, that doesn’t 
mean you shouldn’t start a business, but maybe you need to wait or refine your idea.

22
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
having a dream of owning a business, as long as it comes with a solid plan to 
determine the value of its assets. And to get to a solid plan, you must have 
respect for solid valuation techniques.
Plenty of entrepreneurs successfully incorporate raw emotion and their 
dreams into the purchases and startups of new businesses. For instance, the 
lore goes that Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, got the idea to start 
Amazon on a cross-country drive between New York and Seattle after he quit 
a Wall Street job as a computer geek. Within days, Amazon was taking baby 
steps in his garage. And Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin brand of 
more than 360 companies, started a teen magazine at age 16 that eventually 
morphed into his first mail-order music business, and the Virgin name is now 
on everything from airplanes to alternative fuels.
 
Entrepreneurial stories — particularly the success stories you hear over and 
over — are inspirational. But they don’t take the place of cold, hard valuation 
techniques in the process of starting up a new business idea or buying an 
existing company. Valuation techniques are used to evaluate and quantify the 
following three basic elements, which determine the value of a going business:
 
✓ Cash flow: The cash that a business is expected to generate, and 
continue to generate, into the future
 
✓ Growth: The growth expectation of the cash-flow stream we mention in 
the preceding bullet
 
✓ Risk: The risk inherent in maintaining or growing the cash generated by 
the business
You’re taking advantage of 
a strategic opportunity
It’s great when opportunity knocks, but how do you know it’s really a 
strategic opportunity for you and your business? Whether you’re talking 
about buying a small company or a large one, the valuation process is 
necessary to determine whether the current owner’s sales pitch conforms 
to the actual value of the business or whether the prospective buyer is 
representing himself accurately.
That’s why when companies merge, both parties request a valuation assess-
ment of the other. And in many cases, they may already have conducted 
such a process on themselves. When both sides get to serious talks, they 
bring in valuation professionals and, in some cases, forensic accountants 
(see Chapter 17) to begin a detailed examination of all of a company’s assets.

23
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
 
Some people believe that valuation is important only for larger companies. 
Not true. Small businesses, even lucrative ones, may not be totally clear in 
their financial reporting or other factors in operating their business. That’s 
why expert help comes in handy.
However, valuation isn’t a process reserved only for pending deals. Valuation 
is also a strategic activity. Throughout this book, we talk about how compa-
nies prepare themselves for various actions in their life cycle by looking very 
closely at the value of their assets. This process should be constant at all 
companies because it enables management and potential buyers to spot 
potential opportunities in the marketplace that their competitors can’t.
For sellers and buyers, one fact always remains the same: Knowledge is 
power. And qualified valuation professionals provide the best and most 
up-to-date quality of information to steer their business through the years.
You’re buying a business 
to pass on to your heirs
Family businesses are typically smaller businesses — companies with annual 
revenues well below $1 million. They feed and clothe a houseful of relatives, 
and they educate them and provide them with summer jobs and full-time 
careers.
Skipping out on the strategy
Before you act on your dream of owning 
or starting a business, you need to dedicate 
yourself to a valuation strategy. After all, the 
financial future you save may be your own.
One particular gentleman accumulated a nice 
nest egg working in corporate America and 
decided to purchase a business. It was a 
rather small business (with roughly $500,000 
in gross revenue) that had been around for 
years. Through the seller’s intermediary, the 
man submitted a professionally written offering 
memo. An accountant was the primary reviewer 
of the financial statements. He didn’t bring in a 
specific expert on valuation.
The gentleman made an offer, and the purchase 
and sale agreement and other documentation 
began. However, he performed no physical 
inventory audit. He didn’t spot-check the 
customer list. He didn’t scrutinize the owner’s 
add-back adjustments.
The result: The buyer drastically overpaid for 
the business, and its cash flow couldn’t keep up 
with what the buyer owed on the business. He 
declared bankruptcy two years later, and his 
nest egg was gone.

24
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Family businesses may last several generations. However, most end in 
closure, sale, or some other ownership structure, and that chosen endpoint 
is one of many things that affect their valuation.
Just 30 percent of family businesses are passed down to the next generation. 
These so-called closely held businesses rarely outlive the founder because 
keeping the next generation inside the business is often tough. Kids generally 
want to make their own way in the world. Add that to the threat of estate 
taxes and the job of finding competent managers and employees inside and 
outside the family to keep the business going, and you can see why business 
survival is a challenge.
Passing on the family business to the next generation can include many 
hurdles, from tax issues and owner reluctance to family conflicts and greed 
that can rival a Shakespearean tragedy. And that’s when a need for business 
valuation frequently enters the picture.
Shaking the Money Tree: How Lenders 
Make Thorough Valuation a Necessity
Valuation standards aren’t always the same. When the economy is good and 
everyone is making money, banks and other lenders can be surprisingly loose 
about demanding adequate valuation of the assets they’re basing their loan 
amounts on. But when times get bad, it’s just like Robert Frost once said: “A 
bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it 
back when it begins to rain.”
Family friction and the need for valuation
When a founder dies, families can go to war for 
reasons far more emotional than economical. 
Relationships forged in childhood don’t always 
translate into effective working relationships in 
a shared business concern. At the same time, 
family members who have been longtime 
employees in a business may feel that they have 
a deeper stake in the business than cousins and 
siblings who have worked elsewhere.
Likewise, divorce breaks up more than a few 
family businesses, (see Chapter 19 for more 
info). Both parties in a divorce frequently do 
valuation if a family business is involved as a 
prime asset.
Family matters are critical drivers for valuation. 
For more information on valuation and the family 
business, turn to Chapter 11.

25
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
As we write this book, it’s raining hard, and plenty of people are getting 
soaked. The nation is in the midst of a historic credit crisis led by a downturn 
in the U.S. economy and an even more severe crunch in the nation’s commer-
cial and residential lending environment. By 2008, U.S. lenders of all stripes 
started tightening up their borrowing standards to the point that even their 
best customers were starting to find obstacles to loan approvals for everyday 
business needs and long-term expansion. These were obstacles they hadn’t 
faced for quite some time.
What has that meant for the business valuation process? Everything.
 
Lenders have done a complete turnabout on their desire for evidence of 
value in both tangible and intangible assets. And although long-term relation-
ships with lenders still matter, lenders have grown far more demanding for 
this data.
In this section, we discuss valuation as it relates to borrowing money.
Borrowing to buy a business: 
What lenders want to see
Arranging for financing to buy an ongoing operation has certain appeal, to 
both buyers and lenders. Yet as most first-time buyers find out, the process 
of preparing to apply for a loan is just as important as that first meeting with 
the lender. In today’s uncertain economy, that preparation process is more 
critical than it has been in many years.
If you’re paying attention, you can see how long a particular company has 
been in operation, you can investigate its activities through the news media 
(check the clips to see how good business has really been), and you can go 
online to see whether you can identify regulatory problems or court actions 
the business may have suffered. You can also gather a fair amount of word 
of mouth from customers, suppliers, and other key constituencies of that 
business.
 
Lenders want you to know that they want to understand your value equation 
for your business before they lend you money. Banks lend to reputable 
borrowers who have the following elements:
 
✓ A well-thought-out business plan
 
✓ A solid credit history on a personal and business basis
 
✓ A willingness to do business with them regarding other services, 
including checking, depository services, and so on

26
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Both individuals and companies buy businesses. Smaller privately held 
companies and many individuals face considerable challenges in proving 
their value and qualifications to lenders who will enable the deal. Private 
companies don’t have to disclose everything to the general public — 
although the IRS and industry regulators will want to know more than their 
fair share — but they have to put these details on display to prospective 
buyers. The same is true for individuals and small businesses making a 
purchase.
 
If you have the financial flexibility to buy the real estate your business needs 
to operate, do it. Lenders like to see a business with equity on its books, not 
just rent payments and depreciating equipment. However, it may make sense 
for you to hold and value real estate as an asset separate from the business 
for a variety of reasons that benefit both you and the business. By all means, 
talk to a qualified accountant about this issue.
Also, smaller companies generally don’t mean as much to lenders as larger 
ones, and that goes for public and private companies alike. In a tough lending 
environment, the spoils don’t go only to companies with valuable assets 
and spotless credit records, but size definitely matters. Bottom line: Bigger 
companies provide lenders with more business. So not only do smaller com-
panies such as the ones we really focus on in this book need to have a quality 
valuation process in place for evaluating a future investment, but they also 
need to prepare for that degree of investigation by anyone helping them to 
finance a transaction.
 
We advise buyers or sellers of small companies to start preparations well in 
advance — sometimes two to three years in advance — to get their overall 
business health and reporting systems in place so lenders get all the answers 
they need when they need them. Many companies need to upgrade their 
financial reporting to be ready for an honest and thorough valuation. Some 
need to clean up their credit history.
Preparing for mergers and 
other big-money deals
If a company is planning a merger and is inclined to borrow a large amount of 
money to close the deal, a lender may demand significant valuation data from 
the potential borrower so that it can determine whether to lend. The lender 
often isn’t the place where you have your checking account, although retail 
banks typically have commercial divisions where loans are made; investment 
banks and other types of lenders may demand valuation data on a business 
you plan to buy or sell.

27
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
If you’re planning a merger or big-money deal, get professional advice on this 
and do the valuation with enough time in reserve to make specific changes 
that may boost your business’s valuation even further.
Seeking new or continued funding 
for an existing business
Business owners should never expect their relationship with existing lenders 
to stay the same, nor should they expect their reputation to mean all that 
much to new lenders they’re approaching. So even though their business 
may be a known quantity in the community, they definitely need to view 
themselves through an outsider’s eyes in evaluating their attractiveness as a 
borrower.
 
Depending on the amount of funding and the purpose for the valuation (fund-
ing a business may spring from many reasons), it may make sense for a com-
pany to prepare to borrow by bringing in a valuation professional to create a 
bigger portfolio of information for a lender to consider.
Attracting public or private investors
Many of the priorities of outside investors are the same as that of lenders: 
They want to see a great business idea, a solid business plan, and credit 
behavior above reproach for the various participants in the business.
 
Keep in mind that what your business is worth depends on three factors: the 
cash it generates today, how much cash it’s likely to deliver in the foreseeable 
future, and the return any buyers would require on their investment in your 
business. Some businesses that have been operating for a while have such a 
track record, but many are too young for that.
Counting on Uncle Sam?
When private lenders cut back, don’t expect the 
government to sweep in and pick up the slack. 
During the credit crunch that was happening 
while we were writing this book, government 
lenders were also tightening the screws. The 
U.S. Small Business Administration was taking 
considerable heat for tightening lending 
requirements. By spring 2008, the SBA reported 
that the National Association of Government 
Guaranteed Lenders had found “two-thirds of 
SBA lenders had tightened standards on 7(a) 
loans, SBA’s primary business loan program, 
and more than 60 percent of SBA lenders 
said they are seeing a decline in demand from 
businesses for loans.”

Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Most new businesses tap friends and family for early seed money. This early 
money — and your handling of it — can make your business more attractive 
to angel investors if you have a hot idea and the talent to bring it forward. 
An angel investor is someone who provides capital to one or more startup 
companies and is usually a rich person who likes to dabble in young busi-
nesses with great potential. Angels tend to be the next rung of financing for 
companies hoping to take their business to the next stage — expanding 
the reach and scope of a product’s distribution, bringing in advertising and 
promotions, or helping pay to expand staff. The next step is venture capital, 
firms that take companies at this still-young phase and prepare them for 
what will hopefully be a successful march into the public markets.
What If You Want — or Need — 
to Sell a Business?
Owners usually sell successful ongoing businesses for a number of reasons, 
and even in the best scenario, significant planning is required in advance to 
ensure a successful outcome. Valuation expertise can be an enormous help in 
planning not only the life of a business but your life as well, as we explain in 
the following sections.
Doing some smart estate planning
Valuation isn’t something you do only when a deal is pending. Doing a proper 
business valuation is a necessary precursor to any number of business 
scenarios that can be incredibly personal — selling the business, buying a 
new business to expand your reach, or passing it on to the kids or qualified 
managers who have been with you all along.
Estate planning is the process of examining all your assets and determining 
your wishes for their disposal to family, friends, and employees at the time of 
your death or incapacitation. If you’re a business owner, you have plenty of 
information to consider in this process. You need to take an unbiased look at 
what’s there and what the real quality of those assets is. Sometimes it takes 
some time for those realities to sink in.
 
We suggest doing a valuation of a business as part of any estate-planning 
process anywhere from three to five years of a projected transition.
Business owners and their attitudes fall into two camps. The first include 
first- or second-generation business founders who welcome outside 
assessment of their activities and are willing to entertain opposing 

29
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
viewpoints about the value of what they’ve created. The second involves the 
same kind of people, only they have a lot less willingness to entertain such 
opposing viewpoints.
If you’re in the second camp, you need to gravitate toward the first. Outside 
valuation advice, in tandem with qualified tax and estate advice, is absolutely 
necessary because of the following:
 
✓ Your family members will rely on the wealth you’ve created in that 
business to support themselves if you die suddenly or become 
incapacitated.
 
✓ Your kids already employed in the business see it as a legacy they can 
pass on to their children.
 
✓ Your most loyal employees also see their net worth as tied to the 
fortune of the company, and they should know your final plan for the 
business.
Reaching retirement
The notion of retirement in today’s society is changing. Some business 
owners keep the traditional view: 65 and out. Other owners — particularly 
people who consider themselves serial entrepreneurs and who start one 
business after they sell the other — may retire two or three times before the 
end of their lives because they simply want to do new things at various 
stages in life. Still others view retirement as one step into the grave, so they 
never want to retire.
Business valuation is critically important for all three of these individuals. 
Obviously, death is the most unavoidable endpoint of all, but much like 
estate planning, retirement planning is something best done well in advance 
to see if you can retire the way you want.
Letting the kids take over
We spend much more time on this topic in Chapter 11, but a valuation 
strategy is necessary in the succession plan, both for children who are 
already working in the business and for the children who have a stake in 
the wealth created by the business.
Any number of family-owned businesses — some large, most small — have 
been torn asunder by owners who failed to plan and siblings and cousins 
who could not agree on anything from management decisions to the ultimate 
share of the business each actually owns.

30
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
Estate planning, retirement planning, and succession planning are inextricably 
linked. If the business is the central source of wealth in a family, you must 
have an independent valuation based on a set date that all parties are made 
aware of and hopefully accept.
Facing threats from market forces
Consider a small-town five-and-dime store that saw its business start to erode 
when the first Wal-Mart moved to town 40 years ago. Think of the 75-year-old 
family bookstore that started to see fewer customers when the first Barnes & 
Noble superstore opened at a nearby shopping center.
Even for multigenerational businesses, times change. Most importantly, the 
players change, too. All business owners must keep valuation in the back of 
their minds when they sense that a game-changing company has moved into 
their marketplace.
But competitors aren’t the only market forces that change a company’s for-
tunes. Look at what outsourcing and more modern technologies have done 
to established companies. If they haven’t kept up, they have three choices: 
modernize (often tough for smaller companies to afford), put themselves up 
for sale (to a market that may not be ready to buy), or simply fade away.
Many business owners may not see the end coming, whereas the best valua-
tion professionals do. Valuation is not all about that final dollar figure; it’s 
about measuring a business’s short- and long-term viability as well. A valua-
tion expert with knowledge of your industry — or access to outsider experts 
who have that knowledge — is as much a central business advisor as your 
accountant or attorney.
Separating from a co-founder or partner
Partnerships are unincorporated businesses in which two or more individuals 
manage the business and are equally liable for its debts. You can find varia-
tions on that level of liability based on the legal definition of the partnership, 
but that’s basically it. Partnerships are a particularly interesting valuation 
challenge because they typically don’t have that many hard assets to value. 
In fact, a lot of partnership value is intrinsic — that is, it’s tied up in the skills 
of the individuals who form the partnership.
Many law firms and medical practices start out as partnerships. If you’re 
interested in buying into or selling out of an existing partnership, you’re 
valuing not only the few hard assets the business has but also the many 
intangibles that lead to most of its value — literally, the brains behind the 
operation.

31
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
 
For all business valuation, hard assets are only one part of the picture — an 
important part for many businesses but rarely the most critical. What any 
potential buyer wants is a company with cash flow or market comp values 
that are over and above the adjusted book values of the assets. That means 
you have a company that “has something,” significant intangible value or 
goodwill. If the target company fails that test, the company may be “worth 
more dead than alive” and should be purchased only for the breakup value of 
its tangible assets.
Partnerships are unique in another way, too. Partnerships may be structured 
as an equal split in ownership: For instance, perhaps two doctors start a 
medical office as a partnership and are 50/50 owners. But as that partnership 
ages, they may take on associate partners in the practice who don’t have 
the same ownership stake. Why? Because all the partners benefit from the 
patients and clients that the original partners brought in back when the firm 
or practice was founded.
Valuation professionals are handy at various stages of a partnership’s life. 
Incoming and outgoing partners want to know the value of a partnership 
before they commit to working there or know their potential share of the 
partnership’s wealth as they leave or retire.
Valuation may also be an important first step in drafting an equitable buy/
sell agreement or updating an old one. Although not unique to partnerships, 
you’ll hear about buy/sell agreements that determine various shares of 
What buy/sell agreements do
In partnerships or closely held businesses, 
concern always arises over what may happen 
to the business if one of the owners elects to 
leave or dies or becomes incapacitated. 
Surviving owners want continuity of ownership 
and management — and no threat from 
a deceased owner’s survivors — so smart 
businesses draft buy/sell agreements that spell 
out how transitions will occur. They typically 
cover the following:
 ✓ A definition of various “triggering events” 
to guarantee owners that their interest in 
the business will be purchased
 ✓ Who the owner’s interest must be sold to, 
whether it’s the company or the partnership 
or specific owners
 ✓ A mechanism for pricing that stake when a 
triggering event happens
 ✓ A funding source — either owners’ funds or 
proceeds from insurance policies — that 
finances the purchase of the departing 
owner’s stake
 ✓ The valuation process for a deceased 
owner’s interest in the business or partner-
ship, for estate tax purposes

32
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
ownership. Buy/sell agreements address how shares of a partnership may 
be bought or sold if a partners leaves or dies, and they’re also an important 
consideration for the families of the practitioner who’s transitioning out.
Dealing with divorce
Business valuation is often the central point of wealth separation when a 
marriage ends. And not only must spouses be considered, but so must 
children and possibly children the business founders had with previous 
spouses, as well as nonfamily employees whose futures are tied to the 
fortunes of the business.
As divorce and tax lawyers and accountants wrestle with the actual division 
of assets, the valuation professional has to establish a fair value on the 
business, even if opposing sides may not be volunteering much information.
Divorce is clearly a situation in which individuals can’t take a complex 
valuation assignment upon themselves. Divorce is a complicated and 
emotional process, and it’s best to have valuation experts with experience 
in such matters handle it. For more on divorce and business valuation, see 
Chapter 19.
Exit Plans: Writing the Ending
An exit plan in a business may be retirement. It may be the sale of a com-
pany. It may be a reduced role for a founder or a partner until she feels the 
next generation is in the best shape to take over full time. At any rate, having 
an exit plan is a good idea.
An exit plan is actually the precursor to any of the situations we mention 
earlier in the chapter. Before you decide to retire, you have to decide how 
you want to retire. And before you sell, you have to decide how you want 
to sell.
This book talks about exit plans in many valuation situations for a reason: 
Exits are a common fact of life, whether business owners want to admit it or 
not and certainly regardless of whether they want those exits to happen. 
Owners die in the prime of their lives. Business partners get sick of working 
together. Kids don’t want the business. Economic or industrial realities 
change, and owners are suddenly forced to survive in ways they hadn’t 
planned. In this section, we give you the basics.

33
 Chapter 2: What Triggers a Business Valuation?
Who benefits from an exit plan?
Many more people than the owner benefit from an exit plan. Co-owners need 
to coordinate their exit plans, and the families of each owner need to be 
aware of those plans so they can plan their financial future. Plus, family and 
nonfamily owners and employees in the business need to have a solid idea of 
the owner’s exit plan so they can plan their own careers.
Spouses and siblings who work in the business need to have an exit plan in 
case they elect to leave the company and possibly purchase the stakes of 
others. Exit planning also gives a family an idea of which skills and talents 
they’d have to replace if key members were to leave.
When should an exit valuation be done?
A business valuation has many triggers, but the best reason to do one is to 
plan for best outcomes and unexpected events. With that in mind, exits 
can — and should — be planned well in advance. Valuation is key in the 
process, which should be done at least three to five years before an owner 
is thinking about making a move. If possible, exit planning should be an 
activity mutually undertaken by other owners and their families to make sure 
all personal and business issues are aired.
But back to valuation. Valuation is a key start of exit planning because it tells 
you the following:
 
✓ How much money you’re likely to get for the business if you sell and, 
therefore, how much you’ll have to use for your retirement or possibly 
the purchase of another company
 
✓ How big of a legacy you can pass on to your kids or employees as they 
continue the company’s activities
 
✓ Whether any major or minor business problems need to be fixed before 
you put the company up for sale or pass it down to the next generation
Solo valuation and exit planning is tough to do. Most business owners are too 
tied up in the day-to-day activities of running their business to spend a lot of 
time thinking about how to pass on the business to children or employees.
 
Think about endings in terms of the startup and continuation of a business. At 
any time in a business’s life, owners and other family members can be thinking 
about an ending in the most positive way possible.

n business, there’s so much talk about the bottom line and the irrefutable 
truth of numbers. So why, then, isn’t business valuation an exact science? 
Because the everyday competitive environment in which businesses operate 
is in a constant state of change. The economic tide that lifts all boats can 
sink them tomorrow. And overnight, unexpected world events can make a 
difference in the smallest business fortunes — just witness the economic 
downturn triggered by the September 11 attacks in 2001.
In good economic times as well as in bad, innovation and ideas are the 
toughest elements to measure because no one can foresee when an entire 
marketplace will respond to one great idea. Perhaps Steve Jobs had an 
inkling of how big the iPod was going to be, but at the turn of the 21st cen-
tury, much less a generation before, few people understood how popular 
personal digital electronics would become.
Business valuation is as much an art as it is a science because numbers alone 
can’t be trusted — successful valuation involves an understanding of busi-
ness financial documentation as well as a nose for news and activities consid-
erably more stinky. And a certain amount of gauging the risk in any business 
is subjective. In many ways, businesses are as unpredictable as people. This 
is why the best business valuation professionals mix solid mathematical and 
research skills with extreme curiosity and a sharp instinct for the good and 
bad in business. A good valuation toolbox combines hard data and soft skills. 
This chapter focuses on the information that a valuation professional looks 
for when valuing a business.

Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Examining Your Reasons for 
Valuing This Business
People buy and sell businesses every day, and sellers have just as many 
reasons for selling as buyers have reasons for buying. Determining why 
you want a valuation of the business is the first step in the process of buying 
or selling.
 
For a truly unbiased valuation, the valuation professional should strive to 
present only a fair market value, which (in the case of a willing buyer and 
seller with full knowledge) includes all the assessment and analysis required 
to make a solid estimate of earnings, growth prospects, and risk. This results 
in a valuation that can stand a test in court. Just remember that fair market 
value (FMV) and price are not the same.
The various personal, market, and operational situations facing a business 
can determine whether it will be worth more or less when it’s time to 
buy or sell. Any current or prospective business owner may be in any of the 
following situations when valuing a company:
 
✓ A desire or need to retire: We see so many companies that are forced 
into transition when an owner becomes ill or is forced by family mem-
bers or employees to end his or her career or pass on responsibilities to 
another generation. In the best of situations, retirement is an event 
that’s planned well in advance. Valuation done in advance helps, too — 
it gives a sense of timing to a major business event.
 
✓ A struggle to get money out of a dying business: We often get word 
of valuation assignments when companies run into major — and some-
times irreversible — trouble. Valuation becomes necessary not only 
when creditors want to get a bead on the value of a company that owes 
them money but also when owners and families want to understand 
whether they’ll be able to take any money away from the operation at 
all, even if it’s only the liquidation value of the company.
 
✓ A need to expand an existing operation: A company can grow in 
several ways: It can grow through internal means by plowing its profits 
into new facilities and other methods to grow its operations; it can 
borrow by approaching banks for loans; it can approach investors for 
needed funds by issuing public or private shares in the business; or it 
can buy a separate company that complements its needs. Each option 
establishes the need for valuation to determine the value of the 
company so it can determine how it wants to grow.

37
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Tangibles and Intangibles of Business Valuation
 
✓ A divorce between one of the owners and his or her spouse: Marriage 
is a big factor in the future of a business, and so is divorce. Valuation 
may come into play when two spouses part company; the fair market 
valuation of the company often must be completed before the divorce 
can be finalized.
 
✓ An exit from a business on one’s own terms: Several decades ago, a 
top executive wouldn’t break her stride just to take a few years off or 
possibly start another business with money she earned from the last 
business she sold. But today, it happens all the time. Exit planning is 
now akin to estate planning in the number of issues that you need to 
consider, but the key word here is planning; the valuation of an existing 
business is a guidepost to the next step in many executives’ lives.
 
✓ A need to do some early estate planning: Making sure the assets of 
the business stay in the family or with key employees isn’t something 
you can do in a day. Estate planning is also not a singular process. An 
unbiased valuation of the company is necessary to put all constituencies 
on the same page before the division of assets is mapped out.
For more details on these reasons for business valuation, see Chapter 2.
Introducing Standards of Value
A standard of value is a choice for the way value is sought in any transaction 
or the type of value used in a specific transaction. It may be legally mandated 
based on the situation, or it may reflect the desire of both parties in a 
transaction. In this case, it’s a measure of the motivation and knowledge of 
the parties — meaning buyer and seller — as well as other conditions that 
have a direct impact on the value/price of business.
The concept may sound a bit technical at first, but we go into more detail on 
standards of value in this section. Simply keep in mind that people buy and 
sell businesses for a variety of reasons and under a variety of conditions.
 
A business needs not only to make money but also to make progressively 
more money over the years to stay ahead of inflation. Valuation is a process 
that forces you to look at the viability of an existing business or a business 
idea and at whether an investment in a particular business will outweigh 
investment in other things like the stock market, currencies, or other 
securities. It’s tough to avoid emotion when buying or selling a business, but 
valuation is a reality check.

38
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
The mother of all standards: 
Fair market value
The standard of value you hear about most often is fair market value. Fair 
market value — a term used colloquially with market value and cash value — 
describes a business valuation in which a buyer and seller, who are both 
willing participants in the transaction, can agree on a transaction based on a 
common knowledge of all relevant facts. The word market doesn’t imply the 
stock market; it’s basically the market of all buyers and sellers that would 
potentially be interested in making a particular deal.
Why do we emphasize that the buyer and seller are both “willing partici-
pants” in the transaction? Because someone having an urgent reason to buy 
or sell can definitely skew the valuation in one of two ways:
 
✓ Motivated buyers tend to pay higher prices to unmotivated sellers.
 
✓ Motivated sellers tend to accept lower prices from unmotivated buyers.
The valuation process would be so much easier to explain if there were only 
one or two motivations for a transaction. And of course, valuing businesses 
would be even easier if both people and businesses weren’t so unique. 
But the value of any business may get personal, based on the individuals 
involved. One buyer may have a personal vision of what the business is 
worth, and of course, a valuation professional may disagree after he or she 
views conditions from specific data combined with training and perspective. 
All these viewpoints — and the desire to possess or give up a business — 
have a somewhat unpredictable up or down effect on price. Fair market 
value is an attempt to be objective.
 
Fair market value implies an equilibrium that, although it may not always be 
met, represents the theoretical fulcrum point in any deal. That’s why fair 
market value is the most widely recognized and accepted standard of value, 
and it’s used in all federal and state tax matters, including the valuations 
used in estate taxes, gift taxes, inheritance taxes, income taxes, and ad 
valorem taxes.
Perceptions of investment value
Whereas market value is objective, impersonal, and detached, investment 
value is subjective and personal. Investment value means that the value of a 
business is based on expected earnings or monetary return to a specific 
investor. Investment value, at least for most people, is in the eye of the 
beholder.

39
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Tangibles and Intangibles of Business Valuation
The investment value to one particular owner or prospective owner can be 
different from the fair market value. Valid reasons for this difference can 
include
 
✓ Perceptions in estimates of future earning power
 
✓ Perceptions in the degree of risk involved
 
✓ Differences in tax status
 
✓ Things in common with other operations you own or control
Keep in mind that we’re talking about more than the stock of a company 
when we talk about investment value. For example, real estate is also a 
business, and investment value is also a standard used when determining 
whether a property should be bought or sold.
The fundamentals of intrinsic value
Intrinsic value — sometimes called fundamental value — differs from invest-
ment value in that it doesn’t have as much to do with the investment as with 
the investor. Intrinsic value involves an investor who applies his or her own 
particular analysis and skills to the business as a whole or to individual 
assets to determine whether the business has value that isn’t reflected in the 
current market or asking price. It is, as many say, the “true” or “real” worth of 
an item based on that analysis.
Going over going-concern value
Think about it: If you’re considering buying a business that’s still operating, 
you conceivably may pay more for it than you would for one that’s going out 
of business. A going concern — also known as an ongoing business — is a 
viable operating entity with assets and inventory, staff and management; 
it’s open for business with no expectation of closing for any reason in the 
immediate future.
If it’s a well-run business, not only is it paying its expenses, but it’s also 
making a profit. Profitability is one element of value.
Valuing assets is a different ballgame when valuing an ongoing business as 
opposed to one that’s on the brink of closure. Here are a few reasons why:

40
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
✓ A business’s brand identity is arguably more valuable as a going 
concern.
 
✓ Customers are still actively coming through the door.
 
✓ Products are still in an ongoing state of service and development.
 
✓ Marketing and advertising is ongoing.
 
✓ Management is still running the operation with intimate knowledge of 
how to make the business work.
 
Valuation on a going-concern basis doesn’t necessarily mean that the business 
is being run at its optimum level. Frankly, you may have some better ideas 
about how to do that. But because you may apply more than one valuation 
standard to a specific transaction, looking for intrinsic value as well isn’t 
uncommon.
Liquidation value
Liquidation value is the flip side of going-concern value. Liquidation value 
represents the net amount that can be gathered if the business is shut down 
and its assets are sold piecemeal. For example, liquidation is common in the 
restaurant business. If a restaurant closes, the assets such as the kitchen 
equipment, tables and chairs, and so on can be sold. (This is, of course, 
assuming the owners owned the assets in the first place and the equipment 
wasn’t leased.)
Knowing the kind of liquidation that’s taking place is important because it 
affects the costs connected with liquidation of the property, including com-
missions for those facilitating the liquidation (lawyers, accountants, audi-
tors) and taxes at the end of the transaction. That entire outflow affects the 
final value of the business. Here are the gradations of liquidation value:
 
✓ Orderly liquidation: Assets are sold strategically over an orderly period 
of time to attract the most money for the assets
 
✓ Forced liquidation: Usually, creditors have sued or there’s a bankruptcy 
filing that calls for liquidation, so everything gets dumped on the market 
in a hurry
 
In calculating the present value of a business or property on a liquidation 
basis, discount the estimated net proceeds at a rate that reflects the risk 
involved back to the date of the original valuation.

 Chapter 3: Understanding the Tangibles and Intangibles of Business Valuation
Adjusting or Normalizing 
a Financial Statement
“Adjusting” numbers sounds a little shady, doesn’t it? Well, it’s not. Not only 
is it legal, but it’s also the essence of the science of valuation. To analyze and 
compare attributes of companies, it’s appropriate to add or remove various 
financial data or apply various computations to get a true economic picture 
of the business versus the picture of the business for tax purposes. Adjusting 
is what accountants and business valuation professionals do to fully examine 
assets and companies as a whole.
Here are some common reasons for adjustments of figures in the valuation 
process:
 
✓ Removing nonoperating assets: In any sale transaction, you have some 
assets that aren’t related to the production of earnings, such as excess 
cash. Those assets are generally not made part of the deal. For this 
reason, valuation professionals usually adjust the balance sheet to 
remove these items before making any comparisons.
 
✓ Getting rid of nonrecurring income and expense items: A target 
company’s financial statements (see Chapter 8) may be affected by 
events that aren’t expected to recur, such as asset sales, costs or 
proceeds from a lawsuit, or an unusually large one-time gain or expense. 
Valuation professionals take these items out so they can get a better 
view of management’s expectations of future performance.
 
✓ Making sure that wages, benefits, and rent reflect current market 
rates: When a company does its due diligence in hopes of taking over 
another company, the potential buyer may find that the owners of the 
target company are paid wages and benefits either above or below 
market rates. Or the rent of the target company’s property may not 
match market rates. If the acquiring company is going to replace that 
management or staff, or if it’s not going to continue operating on the 
same premises on the same terms, the acquiring company may have to 
pay more or less to do so.
 
North American Industry Classification System codes — or NAICS codes — 
are a research tool to understand performance figures for various industries. 
These six-digit numeric codes are assigned by the governments of the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada to identify thousands of types of business 
establishments. The U.S. Census Bureau collects the data here in the States. 
You may hear the term SIC code — that’s the older version of the system, but 
that data is still out there. For more information, go to www.census.gov and 
do a search for NAICS.

Other Considerations: Science Meets Art
Suppose you’ve examined all the financial documents and looked at all the 
numbers. That’s the science, because those are real numbers that reflect 
real business activity. Now comes the art. The valuation professional taps his 
various research resources and relies on experience and judgment to build in 
risk variables for the company’s depth of management, stability of industry, 
and diversity of product line and customer base (to name a few key mea-
sures) to get to the final answer. How does he do this? By getting more 
information. This section explains how that info comes into play.
Adding business and economic news
A generation ago, if you wanted to find out about how local, state, national, 
and international economic news affected companies in your town, you’d 
have to pick up the business section in your local daily newspaper or check 
out the Wall Street Journal every weekday morning. You might also have 
studied Fortune, Business Week, The Economist, or any other international 
business magazine that looked at the big picture. Then you’d have to do a fair 
amount of thinking to see how that news filtered down to what you were 
doing on Main Street.
But today, you live in a sea of information. Thanks to CNN, CNBC, local 
business weeklies, and Internet news organizations that specialize in various 
areas of business, gathering business and economic news is literally a 24/7 
process that’s targeted to businesses of all sizes.
Understanding business and economic news is crucial to the understanding 
of business valuation because marketplace events and trends can change a 
business’s value on a dime. Some examples include the following:
 
✓ If energy prices are rising and you produce something that has to be 
delivered by car, truck, train, or plane, the rising costs can damage 
your ability to do business and therefore the value of your company. 
Transporting your product will cost you more, which will affect your 
overall expenses relative to that of your competition. That in turn will 
affect the price you charge your customer, unless you can pass along 
that added cost without complaint or find a way to mitigate the cost.
 
✓ The global economy — helped in large part by the Internet — means 
that the services and manufacturing you do may be done more 
inexpensively by a company in the Far East or Central Asia. Can 
you shift production to these cheaper locales if market conditions 
call for it?

43
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Tangibles and Intangibles of Business Valuation
 
✓ The U.S. housing market is currently in a freefall, and consumers are 
watching their spending more closely than ever. Your business 
can experience serious ramifications if it relies solely on consumer 
spending.
 
✓ Interest rates may be falling, but that means there’s a risk for inflation. 
And inflation can force an increase in pricing so you can keep up 
with costs.
Folding in tangible assets
In this section, we’re talking about physical assets owned by a business — 
a printing press, land, buildings, office furniture, computers, and more. 
These are tangible assets, assets of a physical nature, or those that can be 
valued based on pricing data that’s accessible in the marketplace.
Every asset has a life cycle, and that’s why age and depreciation need to be 
accounted for in the valuation process. In most cases, younger physical 
assets have greater value, especially when for mechanical items. Real estate 
has a depreciation process as well, but it can be an exception because 
even with market downturns, land and structures can appreciate in overall 
value over the course of time. As the old saying goes, they’re not making any 
more land.
Drawing valuation conclusions 
with intangible assets
But wait — how do you determine the value of things you know are impor-
tant but that you can’t see, feel, or taste, such as the numbers on the balance 
sheet or profit and loss statement? What’s the long-term value of a boffo 
brand identity? A knockout customer list? How about intellectual property — 
the sum total of knowledge encased in the minds of your brilliant workers? 
What about management’s singularly extraordinary ability to manage 
costs and production? And how many dollar signs can you attach to that 
secret project going on in the lab? These are intangible assets — nonphysical 
assets that in these times may actually account for the bulk of some 
companies’ value.
Why are intangible assets so valuable now versus 25 or 50 years ago? Look no 
further than the computer on your desk — or in your hand. Technology — 
particularly personal technology — has made it easier to create intense 
cultures of innovation within companies of all sizes. The faster you can think, 
research, and communicate, the faster you can develop, manufacture, and 
introduce products to the public. That’s real value.

44
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
Intangible assets come in two flavors:
 
✓ Legal intangibles: These are mainly trade secrets that include customer 
lists, trademarks, brand names, patents, and copyrights. Legal 
intangibles generate legal property rights defensible in a court of law.
 
 The value of trademarks, brand names, patents, and copyrights is a 
function of the additional cash flow (over and above a “normal” cash 
flow) that can be generated by virtue of protection of ownership and 
the application of the asset.
 
✓ Competitive intangibles: These are assets that humans primarily bring 
to an enterprise. Here, we’re talking about the value of good manage-
ment; efficient business processes; smart, innovative thinking; and 
pretty much anything that goes under those headings.
 
 This is inherent goodwill and is the result of the determined value of the 
business, minus the net asset value of the business.
 
In the end, the intangible value of most businesses is the value of the cash-
flow stream over and above the net asset value. And this difference includes 
all the various intangibles. Most of the time, the intangibles are so intercon-
nected to the overall operation, reputation, and so on that they aren’t valued 
separately or on a stand-alone basis.

O
kay, so what’s the difference between an approach and a method to 
finding the value of a particular business? Think of an approach as the 
expressway you need to get to the right town, and think of a method as a way 
to get to the right address. Each approach has several methods. We explain 
the major ones in this chapter and note some additional techniques that 
people use.
Although you may never put pen to paper — or finger to calculator — in 
working these mathematical and analytical formulas, you want to understand 
them, particularly if you’re working with a qualified expert.
No two businesses are exactly alike, even those in the same business 
operating across the street from one another. Having said that, comparing 
similar companies can help you identify efficiencies and best practices 
that boost long-term value. Larger, more complex companies — and the 
increasing number of companies that consider intangible, intellectual 
assets the number one source of their value — may need to apply slightly 
different valuation methods and nonnumerical analysis to get to the bottom 
of things.

46
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Adjusting financials — once more with feeling
As you’re applying various methods or 
approaches to the valuation process, you need 
to have a clean view of the company’s financials 
first. Adjusting financials is a critical step. You 
need to watch for plenty of items when you’re 
adjusting financials; if you see anything you 
don’t understand, ask a trusted advisor such as 
a Certified Public Accountant. Adjust for the 
following:
 ✓ Inventory: Calculate the inventory turn ratio 
or days’ inventory ratio for all the years that 
you have financial statement for. The trends 
in these ratios may indicate either an 
improvement or a slacking off in cash man-
agement. Sharp reductions in turn or 
increases in days’ may indicate a sudden 
downturn in sales, a new product line that’s 
stocking up, or obsolete inventory because 
a product line was abandoned, among 
other things.
 
 Comparing the ratios to industry norms may 
offer valuable insights into the quality of 
cash management and potential risk. 
Always ask to see physical inventory 
records to see whether they correspond to 
the book numbers. Take a look at inventory 
adjustments, too; sometimes companies 
make inventory adjustments when their 
financial data doesn’t agree with the num-
bers collected in physical inventory. If you 
see these adjustments happening, ask why. 
They may indicate a management problem 
in the warehouse, but they may also point to 
unreliable financial data.
 
 Be sure to ask how inventory is valued — 
LIFO (last in, first out) or FIFO (first in, first 
out). LIFO inventory accounting assumes 
that the last goods purchased are the first 
sold and that what remains in inventory at 
the end of the year are goods that were 
purchased first (and possibly bought at 
lower prices). FIFO inventory accounting 
assumes that the oldest remaining items 
are the first sold. Depending on the busi-
ness and what constitutes its inventory, you 
may find a lot of undiscovered value within 
the inventory.
 ✓ Receivables: Granted, this is money coming 
in the door, but you need to find out whether 
any amounts in receivables can’t or won’t 
be collected by the time of sale. Comparing 
the inventory days’ ratios for each of the 
financial periods being analyzed provides 
valuable information about the quality of the 
receivables. And comparing the ratios to 
industry norms provides a perspective on 
how well the business is being managed 
relative to its competitors and helps you 
see the business in terms of relative risk. 
Also ask to see an accounts receivable (AR) 
aging report to determine the quality of 
receivables. Look at the write-off history 
and whether the business has any AR insur-
ance in place.
 ✓ Office equipment, furniture, and fixtures: 
As with most hard assets, the purpose in 
valuation is to discover what they’re worth 
right now, not their book value, which 
doesn’t account for depreciation. You need 
to determine whether to price these assets 
at market value, replacement cost, or liqui-
dation value. If the company is healthy, 
market value probably will be your choice. If 
not, it’ll probably be liquidation value An 
independent appraisal of the assets may be 
required, depending on whether the assets 
are an integral part of the funding of a deal.
 ✓ Factory equipment and tools: Older manu-
facturing businesses may have equipment 
on the factory floor that’s in good working 
order but decades old. Unless the equip-
ment is specialized and supplies a very 

47
 Chapter 4: Approaches and Methods — Basic Theories
Not all companies need to go through a detailed valuation process. Generally, 
the smallest of small companies (businesses with less than $1 million in 
annual revenues is a guideline most valuation experts agree on) can rely on 
database information and rule-of-thumb measurements that go a long way to 
setting a range to negotiate price on any business.
 
One of the best places to start for help in understanding a particular business 
category’s valuation is the most recent edition of Business Reference Guide: 
The Essential Guide to Pricing a Business, by Tom West (Business Brokerage 
Press). For almost 20 years, West has published this growing alphabetical 
index of some 500 types of businesses that includes rule-of-thumb pricing 
information and negotiating tips based on where that business category 
stands at that particular point in time.
A Step-by-Step Overview 
of the Valuation Process
If any of the following information sounds familiar, that’s good. We like to 
reiterate important ideas because doing so helps keep them stuck in your 
head. Here we take a minute to go over each critical step of the valuation 
process. Individuals can cover these steps, but they’re more sensibly done 
by valuation experts:
lucrative product line, most of these assets 
are generally heavily depreciated. An 
independent appraisal of the assets may 
be required, depending on whether the 
assets are an integral part of the funding of 
a deal.
 ✓ Real estate: This category is easy for most 
individuals to understand. Company-owned 
real estate is valued similarly to residential 
real estate — it’s almost always sold at 
market value. If a company has added sen-
sible improvements and maintained its real 
estate well over the years, this category can 
be a source of great value . . . in a healthy 
real estate market. If the evaluation is being 
performed for a sale of the business, 
consider whether the seller may benefit 
from selling the real estate separately from 
the business.
 ✓ Year-to-year numbers: One of the ways to 
judge consistency in a company’s finan-
cials is to divide the dollar amount of any 
item on the balance sheet by the total 
assets for that year. See whether those 
numbers are generally within a certain 
range or if they vary wildly. Do the same for 
items on the liabilities or stockholder’s 
equity side of the balance sheet. What if 
you see a lot of variance? You need to ask 
questions.

48
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
1. Figure out why you want to value a business.
 
 Do you want to split it up in a divorce, pass it down to the kids, divide it 
between siblings, or sell it for top dollar to a total stranger? (See Chapter 2 
for more situations that can trigger a valuation.)
 
2. Gather all your company’s or a target company’s existing (and hope-
fully audited) financial statements and look them over to get a view of 
the business’s health.
 
 The real number crunching starts a bit later. (For info on key financial 
statements, go to Chapter 8.)
 
 If you’re putting a value on your own business before a sale or some 
other transaction, you have to be just as tough on your own numbers 
and operations as you’d be on a company you were planning to buy. If 
you can’t be that coldly objective — and most business owners can’t — 
bring in a skilled person who will be.
 
3. Look outside for objective, factual resources on valuation.
 
 Look for industry-based information that shows comparable valuations 
for similar businesses, their costs of operation, and various news and 
trends that may affect value in the future.
 
4. Adjust the numbers.
 
 This step is the beginning of the extensive number crunching that 
continues throughout the valuation process. You adjust financial state-
ments not to commit hanky-panky but to compensate for any expense or 
accounting behavior not in line with the norms of competing businesses. 
See the nearby sidebar “Adjusting financials — once more with feeling” 
for some common adjustments.
 
 Most business valuations are based on pre-tax earnings. That fact is 
particularly relevant among small businesses because an owner’s 
own tax decisions are generally closely linked to the business and can 
skew the process of valuation. A new owner may not make similar tax 
decisions to the old owner’s, so pre-tax earnings provide a generally 
even playing field.
 
5. Use the right business valuation method — or methods — to calculate 
the value of your company or a target company.
 
 This step is the focus of this chapter. You or your valuation expert will 
choose one or more valuation methods to complete this process.
 
6. Look at all the assumptions and calculations you’ve made thus far and 
assign certain discounts and premiums.
 
 These discounts and premiums are based on anything from the timing of 
the sale to future anticipated activities in the business’s active markets.

7. Write up the report.
 
 We go into some detail on what a typical valuation report looks like 
later in the book, but generally, this material should be gathered 
up and composed into a final document so it can serve as a guide for 
future action.
 
No single “correct” valuation on any company exists. Remember that valua-
tion is all about self-interest. Self-interest goes beyond a dollar figure; it 
involves your particular circumstances for buying or selling a business, your 
knowledge (full or incomplete) of the target company, and who else will be 
affected by the reason for the valuation.
Risky Business: Gauging Circumstances 
for the Best Results
Risk is an important question in the whole subject of business valuation and 
has a direct bearing on the result of the valuation. Business risk is anything 
that can thwart a positive earnings forecast for any company, large or 
small, public or private. It’s any event or item — inside the company or 
outside in the world at large — that can affect sales, the cost of sales, 
administrative or operating expenses, or at worst, innovation and growth. 
In other words, business risk is anything that can lower the potential value 
of a company. Sometimes risk is general, literally outside the control of 
individual companies. It can include the following:
 
✓ The general course of the economy, either up or down
 
✓ Consumer and business spending that supports all businesses and 
industries
 
✓ The health of the lending and investment banking industry
 
✓ Innovations or failures within competitors inside an industry
But sometimes risk is very, very specific to the company itself. Such risks can 
include the following:
 
✓ Poor managerial and financial stewardship of the company
 
✓ Failures in marketing, advertising, and other customer-gathering and 
retention activities
 
✓ Lackluster product or service development
 
✓ High turnover at the staff level and poor control of institutional 
knowledge
In this section, we discuss both the approaches and methods to finding the 
value of a business.

50
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Understanding the different approaches
The three top associations for valuation professionals — the American 
Society of Appraisers (ASA), the Institute of Business Appraisers (IBA), and 
the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts (NACVA) — agree on 
three major approaches to business valuation:
 
✓ The Asset Approach
 
✓ The Market Approach
 
✓ The Income Approach
Some approaches are definitely more appropriate than others. The purpose 
of the valuation influences the ways the business must be valued, and so 
does the level of risk that business currently faces. That’s why valuation 
experts choose one or more approaches over others. The following sections 
cover these three major approaches in more detail.
Avoiding stupid valuation mistakes
Believe it or not, professionals can make these 
mistakes as easily as business owners or 
their various representatives who’ve never 
attempted the process. Keep the following 
questions in mind when reviewing your own 
valuation process or the valuation done for a 
target company:
 ✓ Were the numbers adjusted? You also hear 
the phrase normalizing the financials for the 
financial adjustment phase. Remember, 
adjusting the numbers is all about tweaking 
and sometimes adding back amounts that 
won’t continue when a company changes 
hands —the pay levels for top management 
relative to current market rates, the benefits 
in place for the workforce that may be over 
or under common offerings in the business, 
and so on. Excessive amounts paid before a 
sale may continue afterward, leading to 
higher costs.
 ✓ Was the method correct? If the main source 
of a company’s value is its intangible assets 
and a valuation professional uses such 
tangible methodologies as book value, 
you have a problem. Make sure that the 
methods fit the business.
 ✓ Were all the skeletons pulled from the 
closet? Dishonest businesses hide things, 
honest businesses sometimes forget things 
they should mention, and some valuation 
professionals forget to mention things. 
Smart valuation means that you need to 
keep an eye open for lawsuits, product 
problems, and other signs of past — or 
future — trouble in a business.
 ✓ Did the valuation professional know what 
he was doing? Due diligence applies to the 
hiring process as well. Check your valua-
tion expert’s track record and references, 
and keep up that process during the early 
stages. Does the expert visit the business, 
ask the right questions, and when time to do 
so, aggressively crunch the numbers?

51
 Chapter 4: Approaches and Methods — Basic Theories
The Asset Approach
Also known as the Cost Approach, the Asset valuation approach is based on 
your finding the fair market value of assets (the easiest ones to value are 
The wonderful world of color . . . oops . . . earnings
Numbers are sort of like paint on a canvas: Mix 
them one way, and you get a particular shade. 
Mix them a different way, and they change. 
Valuation experts use a lot of different shades 
of earnings and other financial data in their 
work because they want those numbers to tell 
them specific things. Accounting For Dummies, 
by John A. Tracy, CPA (Wiley), and related 
books can tell you more about the basics of 
accounting, but for now, here are some defini-
tions of key earnings measurements that are 
woven into many valuation projects:
 ✓ Normalized net earnings: Also known as 
normalized earnings, these are earnings 
results that have been adjusted (there’s 
that word again) for unusual one-time 
issues, non-GAAP (generally accepted 
accounting principles) practices, discre-
tionary expenses, or cyclical moves in the 
economy.
 ✓ Earnings before taxes (EBT): EBT is a 
way to compare companies in different tax 
jurisdictions. Here’s the formula:
 
  
 EBT = Revenue – Expenses (excluding 
tax)
 ✓ Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT): 
EBIT is essentially a company’s operating 
earnings before deducting interest and tax 
payments. It’s a purer look at a company’s 
ongoing ability to profit, and it can make for 
easier comparisons across business lines 
and other companies. Here’s the formula:
 
  
 EBIT = Revenue – Operating 
Expenses
 ✓ Earnings before interest, taxes, deprecia-
tion, and amortization (EBITDA): This 
measurement gets a lot of mileage during 
earnings season for public companies. It’s 
a controversial favorite: Analysts use it to 
compare profitability between companies 
and industries because it eliminates the 
effects of financing and accounting deci-
sions, which allows some companies to 
hide a lot (remember Enron?). Here’s the 
formula:
 
  
 EBITDA = Revenue – Expenses 
(excluding tax, interest, depreciation, 
and amortization)
 ✓ Net cash flow: Cash flow is the lifeblood of 
a business because it measures a busi-
ness’s ability to pay its expenses on time 
while continuing to grow the operation. 
Here’s the formula:
 
  
 Net Cash Flow = Cash Inflows – Cash 
Outflows
 ✓ Free cash flow: This figure is the amount of 
cash that a company has left over after it 
has paid all its expenses and purchased all 
the capital assets it requires to maintain the 
business. How do you get there? Start with 
a company’s operating cash flows (net 
income plus amortization and depreciation) 
and then subtract capital expenditures and 
dividends:
 
  
 Free Cash Flow = (Net Income + 
Amortization + Depreciation) – (Capital 
Expenditures + Dividends)
 
 Keep in mind that young, fast-growing com-
panies may have negative free cash flow 
because they typically run up expenses 
before money starts coming in the door.

52
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
tangible assets) and deducting the liabilities to determine the net asset 
value or the net worth of the business. Fair market value is the amount that a 
willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in a free market for any piece of 
property, including a company.
Asset valuation methods include the following:
 
✓ Book value: In all honesty, book value really isn’t a valuation method, 
because book value shouldn’t be confused with fair market value — and 
that’s really why we mention it. The fair market value can be notably 
higher than the book value because the book value is based on the 
historic value of assets — primarily tangible assets. Equally important, 
book value essentially ignores goodwill, and for many small businesses, 
goodwill can be the biggest asset.
 
 Book value isn’t a good measurement for evaluating a business before a 
sale, even for an industrial company that’s all about hard assets. Assets 
get depreciated over the years to a value of zero, but in reality, such 
equipment and other assets may still be valuable to the organization — 
depending on the quality issues associated with those assets, their 
value may actually go up. Yet it’s surprising to note how many 
companies believe that book value actually describes the full value of 
the business. Book value is included in a valuation report for the sake 
of completeness, but beyond that, it has limited use.
 
 Here’s the formula for book value, which in some circles is called a 
business’s net worth:
 
 Book Value = Total Assets – Total Liabilities
 
 Using the tangible book value calculation, intangible or soft assets are 
deducted from the total assets. Economic book value, on the other 
hand, includes intangible assets and allows assets to be adjusted to their 
current market value.
 
✓ Adjusted book value: This figure is the book value amount after assets 
and liabilities have been adjusted to market value, which involves 
comparing assets of similar companies or obtaining an asset appraisal 
(in use) from an accredited asset appraiser.
 
 Why use it: This method should be included in a valuation project for 
going-concern businesses (ongoing businesses, without plans to close in 
the immediate future) because it serves as a reality check of the other 
methods and tells you where the bottom of the value is for businesses 
with inherent goodwill. If some of the other valuation approaches 
indicate a value lower than the adjusted book value, the adjusted book 
value or orderly liquidation value may be a more appropriate valuation 
of the business.

53
 Chapter 4: Approaches and Methods — Basic Theories
 
 There’s no actual formula for adjusted book value; you simply have to 
adjust book asset values to fair market values.
 
✓ Liquidation value: This calculation is somewhat similar to the book 
value calculation, except the value assumes a forced or orderly 
liquidation of assets rather than book value. In practice, the liabilities of 
the business are deducted from the liquidation value of the assets to 
determine the liquidation value of the business. The overall value of a 
business that uses this method should be lower than a valuation 
reached by using the standard book or adjusted book methods.
 
 Why use it: The word liquidation suggests that this is a process confined 
to businesses that are closing, are closed, are in bankruptcy, or are in 
industries that are in irreversible trouble. However, this method may 
also be the indicated method for a business that’s a going concern but 
that isn’t putting its assets to good use and may be better off closing 
down and selling the assets. Sometimes you hear the term orderly 
liquidation value, and you often see it applied to companies that are 
closing and selling off machinery, office equipment, and other tangible 
assets in a piecemeal fashion over time.
For more info on going-concern value and liquidation value, flip to Chapter 3.
The Market Approach
With the Market Approach, you’re comparing your company or a target 
company with other, similar companies. You can use comparisons to 
similar publicly traded companies or to actual sales transactions or similar 
businesses.
 
You must make comparisons with caution. Comparing a small privately owned 
business with a publicly traded company without adjusting for size and 
tradability is inappropriate. Likewise, comparing a business with $100,000 
revenue to a multimillion-dollar business concern is inappropriate.
Another important issue that may detract from the usefulness of compari-
sons is that the comparables are obtained from databases that track 
completed transactions. You may find too few comparable transactions to 
base an opinion on. In addition, some of the databases don’t disclose the 
terms of the transactions, and the terms may have an upward or downward 
effect on the price at which transactions close.
These valuations are frequently expressed in ratio form. You can use several 
ratios for this method of valuation, and as the importance of intangibles 
continues to grow, you’ll probably see new methods evolve in the future. 
Here we list the most commonly used measures:

54
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
✓ Price-to-revenue ratio: This is expressed as the market price of the 
business divided by the revenue.
 
 Why use it: Even if a company hasn’t posted a profit over the past year, it 
always has revenue. This valuation measure is frequently applied to 
younger companies or businesses in high-growth industries. Also, 
depending on how the financials are normalized (and how earnings are 
calculated), the number most easy to verify may be the gross revenues 
of a business.
 
✓ Price-to-earnings ratio: The P/E ratio is expressed as the market price of 
a business divided by earnings.
 
 Why use it: Earnings are the lifeblood of a company — without earnings, 
it can’t continue over a long period of time.
 
✓ Price to EBITDA: This ratio is expressed as the company’s share 
price divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization.
 
 Why use it: Using EBITDA improves comparability among businesses 
because it removes expenses that are or may be somewhat subjective.
The Income Approach
The Income Approach is probably the most common and appropriate 
valuation approach in most cases. Essentially, you’re trying to analyze the 
future economic benefits you’re anticipating from a business — better known 
as income — into a single amount in today’s dollars, the term also known as 
present value.
You can say this another way: The Holy Grail of valuation based on income 
assumptions is the determination of future earnings, also known as the future 
benefit stream, or in other words, “big profits I expect to pocket if I buy this 
company.” (If you don’t want to see evidence of a company that’s going to 
grow and make more money from year to year, why would you buy it?)
Valuation based on income and cash flows tries to project a company’s 
future cash flows based mainly on historical financial data added to smart 
analysis of the company’s current operations and plans for the future — 
anything expected to enhance the amount of money coming in the door. This 
past financial data should be audited data that has come from a respected 
accounting firm that’s willing to sign its name to its work, if possible. That 
gives you accountability for those results. However, the Income Approach 
is suited for less-accountable data also because the approach gives you 
the ability to take into account the higher potential risk associated with an 
unaudited income stream.

55
 Chapter 4: Approaches and Methods — Basic Theories
 
In the smallest of small companies — and surprisingly, in some larger ones as 
well — don’t be surprised if you run into financial data done by someone’s 
Uncle Morrie. Uncle Morrie may be a crackerjack accountant and as honest as 
the day is long, but it’s best to have a CPA with some experience auditing the 
finances of your particular industry doing your figures before you turn them 
over to a buyer. If sellers want a higher price, they need to think like buyers 
and make a more professional presentation of their financials.
Calculating risk and its relationship 
to present value
Companies with smart growth plans, solid financial controls, and good 
leadership build value. Knock out any of these three attributes, and the 
three-legged stool wobbles.
The evaluation of risk and its relationship to present value is what valuation 
professionals — and some of the smartest minds at the biggest companies in 
the country — get paid to do. They look for signs of solid management, but 
they also look for trouble. Ironically, trouble isn’t always a turnoff, because 
trouble often can be managed and overcome. Risk isn’t necessarily a bad 
thing if adjustments are possible.
Whether you’re buying a business outright or a stock in any company as a 
personal investment, you need to determine whether that company’s poten-
tial future reward outweighs the potential risks of getting in. This fact is 
true whether the company is a high-flying Internet startup or a corner family 
restaurant.
If you’re buying a business outright, you should also come to the process 
with an idea of how to limit that business’s risk in the future — art can trump 
science in this part of the valuation process (for more on the art of valuation, 
see Chapter 3).
 
You always have to monetize the future in the present to see if it’s worth 
jumping on board. Present value is the central question of valuation; the 
simple definition is the current value of one or more payments to be received 
or paid in the future. The more interesting question is why present value is 
important. When you’re buying or selling a company, you’re literally buying or 
selling the future. Why would anyone buy a company that has no positive 
prospects after the end of this week, month, or year — or in five years? 
Valuation is focused on the concept of present value because you need to put 
an actual price tag on that future if you want to profit as a buyer or a seller.

56
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
In valuation terms, a discount rate is a rate of return on investment used to 
calculate the present value of a series of cash flows to be received in the 
future. More colloquially, a higher discount rate can be applied to particular 
assets that have a higher degree of risk — read that as questionable value.
Using discount and capitalization rates 
and income valuation methods
Some people describe a discount rate and a capitalization rate as separate 
concepts; others use the terms interchangeably. We’ll just say that both 
concepts are the result of the build-up method in valuation. That means a 
valuation professional uses a variety of factors — hard numbers as well as 
judgment calls based on industry research — to “build up” a variety of 
numbers and reach a critical piece of information: whether it’s smarter for a 
potential buyer to sock her funds in this business or simply invest the money 
elsewhere. In the context of business valuation, a discount rate gives that 
answer before certain tax, cost-of-capital, and cash-flow adjustments are 
made. The capitalization rate is the final measurement that comes after those 
final adjustments.
The discount rate can alternatively be called a required rate of return — what 
you’re expecting the investment to yield, considering how risky it is. As such, 
it’s essentially a measure of the risk of an investment. It’s determined by 
building risk factor on risk factor until you’ve considered all the potential 
risks in an investment.
What kind of numbers go into calculating a discount rate? A valuation profes-
sional builds up a discount rate by starting out with a risk-free rate (usually 
the T-bill rate) and gradually building risk factors onto the risk-free rate until 
all the risk factors related to the business being valued have been taken into 
account. Here’s how it works:
 
1. The first addition is a market risk premium over the risk-free rate, 
to bring the rate to what can be expected from an investment in a 
publicly traded company (with average industry risk).
 
2. The second adjustment is an adjustment for industry risk (some 
industries trade at a higher market risk premium than others because 
of industry risk).
 
3. The next risk premium relates to the size of the business.
 
4. Thereafter, the valuation professional adds or deducts premiums for 
company-specific information that was uncovered during the analysis 
of the business.

57
 Chapter 4: Approaches and Methods — Basic Theories
Consider an example of how the resultant discount rate is used. You have a 
business in your sights that you want to invest in and you know that your 
annual return from this business will be $100,000. You do some research 
and figure out that 33 percent is a standard capitalization rate for other 
businesses this size that operate in the same industry — that 33 percent is 
your capitalization rate here. So you do the math:
$100,000 ÷ 0.33 ≈ $300,000
That $300,000 is the actual value of the investment. Should you pay $300,000 
for that business? See whether you can get it for less.
 
When determining discount and capitalization rates, you have the option to 
use either the build-up method or the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) 
method. (We get to those methods shortly.) If you’re valuing the company on 
a debt-free basis, you can convert the discount and capitalization rates to 
their debt-free equivalents based on the company’s weighted average cost of 
capital.
The following sections cover the most common income valuation methods.
Capitalization of Earnings Method
The Capitalization of Earnings Method reflects the previous calculation: It 
takes an earnings number from a particular period and computes the value of 
the entire investment when divided by a particular capitalization rate. Here’s 
the formula:
Income before Depreciation, Interest, and Tax (IBDIT) ÷ Cap Rate = Value
This basic method determines the value of a business’s capital asset pricing 
and your strategy for negotiation. However, keep in mind that this method 
assumes that the business will grow at a stable rate every year or won’t 
grow at all.
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method
The DCF Method calculates the present value of future expected cash 
flows using a selected discount rate. People usually use it when a company’s 
earnings growth is different from year to year (the company may be growing 
exponentially, or it may be unstable for a variety of reasons, good or 
bad). DCF analysis is usually applied to companies that are rather young or 
companies that are experiencing high growth. (Note that young businesses 
that are still experiencing variable growth may also be more risky.)

58
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Each of the company’s individual cash flows is discounted to a present value 
by using a discount rate over a discrete number of periods. At the end of 
the period, usually when it’s assumed that the company’s earnings have 
stabilized, a terminal value is calculated by using a capitalization rate. All 
the various values are summed to arrive at an overall value of the cash-flow 
stream.
 
Management of the business to be valued should provide the future cash flows 
and the assumptions they’re based on, and the valuation professional should 
carefully and critically assess them. If you’re assessing your own business, 
make every attempt to approach the process with a good dose of realism.
Here’s the DCF formula:
DCF = CF0 × the sum of [(1 + g) ÷ (1 + r)x] 
(for x = 0 to n)
where DCF is discounted cash flow, CF0 is today’s cash flow, g is expected 
growth, r is the expected rate of return, and n is the number of periods 
(which is usually not more than three to five years).
However, you’re not done yet. What you’ve done so far with the discounted 
cash flow doesn’t include the prospects of the business after the discrete 
period years, and you sincerely hope that the business will continue on into 
the future. At this point, you need to make an educated guess regarding what 
may be expected as a long-term growth rate into the future and then use this 
information to determine the terminal value at that time. The terminal value 
can be determined by using the Gordon Growth Model, as follows:
Price = I ÷ (R – g)
where I is the annual cash flow at the end of the discrete period, R is the risk 
or the discount rate, and g is a constant growth rate into perpetuity. This 
calculation gets you to something called a terminal value at the end of a 
period when the company’s growth rate is expected to become stable.
 
Consider the methodology examples you see here as the most common, but 
realize that many more techniques can reach valuation conclusions based 
on particular industries and situations. In many valuations, you see a profes-
sional use more than one approach and methods within that approach to test 
valuation from a number of perspectives.
Weighted Average Cost of Capital
The WACC Method can help a company calculate the cost of raising money. 
The calculation involves multiplying the cost of each element of capital, such 
as debt (loans and bonds) and equity (common stock and preferred stock) 

59
 Chapter 4: Approaches and Methods — Basic Theories
by its percentage of the total capital and then adding them together. The final 
figure, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is a rough guide to the 
rate of “required return” per monetary unit of capital.
Take a look at the formula:
WACC = [Ke + Kd(D/E)] ÷ [1 + (D/E)]
where Ke is the desired return on equity, Kd is the desired return on debt, 
and D/E is the debt/equity ratio.
Excess Earnings Method
We’re not exactly in love with the Excess Earnings Method. In fact, some 
people like to call it the Etch A Sketch Method. This method gets a lot of 
attention for the valuation of companies with significant intangible assets, 
but it’s also earned a fair amount of controversy. Here’s how it works:
 
1. The market value of net tangible assets is multiplied by a rate of 
return appropriate to these assets to calculate earnings attributable to 
tangible assets.
 
 Net tangible assets are calculated first, and then an assumption is made 
about whether those tangible assets should provide at least a basic 
return on investment, such as 10 to 15 percent.
 
2. This earnings figure is deducted from total earnings to calculate an 
earnings figure attributable to intangible assets.
 
 After that return is calculated, the difference between that return and 
the company’s actual cash flow is the amount of cash flow attributable 
to intangibles.
 
3. These intangible earnings are divided by a capitalization rate for 
intangibles to calculate an estimated value for the intangibles.
 
 You now have the value of the intangibles — in very, very rough terms 
at least. We talk much more about the debate over intangible assets in 
Chapter 5.
 
A lot of potential for inaccuracy arises with the Excess Earnings Method, 
particularly among neophytes. The level of subjectivity is very wide. What 
rate should a net tangible asset return — 10, 15, or 20 percent? A delivery 
truck has a different expected contribution than a piece of machinery on the 
plant floor, and depending on which one you pick, it has either less or more 
of an impact on the intangible calculation. A question also arises over what 
capitalization rate to use for intangible assets, and most people place that rate 
at a high level.

60
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
The IRS developed the Excess Earnings Method during Prohibition to 
compensate distilleries for putting them out of business during the Volstead 
Act. More sophisticated techniques have evolved since then.
So why use it? A lot of people love this method because it’s a relatively easy 
one to do. But leave it to the IRS to be a wet blanket: The agency once 
thought the method was okay to use, but now it denounces it because 
depending on the calculation, some firms can create much more value than 
they’re entitled to. Yet some people are still attracted to this method when 
they’re reporting higher earnings than they normally do.
But back to the capitalization rate. When you hear the term capitalization 
of income, it’s the way the economic worth of a company is estimated by 
computing the present value of average annual net income that the company 
is expected to produce in the future.
 
Projecting future income isn’t just a matter of numbers — it involves applying 
certain assumptions about the risk and reward of a particular business invest-
ment. As you see in the preceding computation, a cap rate requires research 
and comparison with other similar companies — but the computation works 
for stock investments, machinery, or any asset.
Another way to explain the capitalization rate is as the yield necessary to 
attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with 
that investment. And in the world of investing in businesses or in securities, 
the greater the risk, the greater the potential for reward.
What are some of the nonnumeric risk factors that get built into capitaliza-
tion and discount rates that valuation professionals apply? We list a few here:
 
✓ Strong product lines
 
✓ Talented management
 
✓ Strong customer base
 
✓ Dominant market share
 
✓ Great financial controls
 
✓ Low employee turnover (and for some valuations, no unions are a plus)
 
✓ No hidden liabilities that may blow up into expensive lawsuits
 
✓ Financial ratios that exceed other companies in its industry class
We try to give you some better insight on valuing intangibles in Chapter 5.

usiness valuation was a lot easier 50 years ago. In the days before 
computers, the Internet, and armies of people working as consultants, 
valuation was linked much more clearly to countable items: tools, machinery, 
facilities, office furniture, units produced, you name it.
Those countable items may still exist within a company, but a higher value is 
often placed on the brainpower within a company — not only the traditional 
intangibles of patents and brands but also the strategic focus of a firm, its 
product development process, and the attractiveness of its leaders and their 
ability to produce talented future leaders just like them.
Today’s economy may be called a knowledge economy — but exactly how do 
you value knowledge? The truth is there are many ways to value all kinds of 
assets. But as knowledge and skills gather more importance in companies, 
the valuation of these intangibles is worth discussing in depth. Read on.
Moving from a Hard-Asset to an 
Intangible-Asset Economy
No matter how you feel about former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, he definitely had a way with a line. In 1999, he told an audience in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, about this major change in the U.S. economy:

62
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
“The quintessential manifestations of America’s industrial might earlier 
this century — large steel mills, auto assembly plants, petrochemical 
complexes and skyscrapers — have been replaced by a gross domestic 
product that has been downsized as ideas have replaced physical bulk 
and effort as creators of value. Today, economic value is best symbolized 
by exceedingly complex, miniaturized integrated circuits and the ideas — 
the software — that utilize them. Most of what we currently perceive as 
value and wealth is intellectual and impalpable.”
This transition in the U.S. economy hasn’t happened overnight, but it has had 
a profound impact on how experts view the value of businesses ranging from 
factories to software developers. The point is that in recent years, people 
have come to realize that the intangible assets of a business may be the most 
valuable of all.
Reviewing types of assets
Here’s a review of all the assets that may be totaled up in the valuation of a 
business:
 
✓ Tangible assets (real property): These are things of value that can be 
physically touched. Examples of tangible assets include buildings; 
industrial, commercial, and municipal land; building improvements; and 
easements.
 
✓ Personal property: This term refers to machinery, equipment, inven-
tory, motor vehicles, trade fixtures, furniture, computer equipment, and 
other items that can be sold.
 
✓ Intangible assets: Intangibles are the opposite of tangible assets: assets 
that aren’t physical in nature. In many cases, intangible assets are 
ideas. Examples include intellectual property (patents, trademarks, 
copyrights, formulas, blueprints, designs, and so on), brand recognition, 
and goodwill.
 
 Goodwill is an intangible asset that gives a company a competitive 
advantage, such as a good marketplace reputation or great employee 
morale. You see goodwill on a balance sheet as the amount by which the 
company’s purchase price exceeds its net tangible assets.
 
 You may see the words definite and indefinite applied to intangible 
assets. An indefinite asset is something like a brand name, because it 
stays with the company and can’t be sold easily. A definite intangible 
asset is something like a patent, which can be sold to another party or 
company that wants to produce the item.
 
✓ Intellectual capital: This is pure knowledge linked to specific people 
who work in the enterprise and the enterprise’s ability to capture that 
knowledge so that it doesn’t travel outside the company.

 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Valuation in a Knowledge Economy
The leading tangible and intangible assets that companies want to value 
include Internet domain names; trade names and trademarks; franchise, 
license, and royalty agreements; customer contracts; computer software; 
proprietary technology; and intellectual property, which we discuss in the 
next section.
 
The central identity of an asset is its capability to generate a return. The 
Internet has changed the face of business, and the world often seems overrun 
with companies that choose to outsource their production of things you 
can touch. We believe that the old formulas and approaches to valuation still 
hold for the companies that trade mainly in intangible goods. Profit proves 
the value of a company, regardless of where that company’s most valuable 
assets lie.
Recognizing the increasing value 
of intellectual property
Since the start of the Internet era in the early 1990s, the bulk of corporate 
value has been sliding from the tangible-assets column — so-called “bricks 
and mortar” assets — to the intangible side. According to Baruch Lev, a pro-
fessor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, intangible assets 
now constitute up to two-thirds of corporate market value in the United 
States. For some firms, such as biotechnology companies, intellectual prop-
erty may account for more than 60 percent of total value.
Here’s a little more evidence for the increasing value of intangibles: In a 
December 2008 story, Business Week chief economist Michael Mandel 
wrote, “The war between the intangible and tangible sectors of the U.S. 
economy is over — and intangibles have won.” He pointed out that since 
the economy went into recession in December 2007, the industries that 
produce or distribute physical or tangible goods — including construction, 
manufacturing, retail trade, and transportation — have lost 1.8 million jobs, 
including 60,000 in the auto industry and its dealer network and 300,000 in 
residential construction.”
Industries in the intangibles sector, including education and healthcare, 
don’t produce any tangible goods and have only a few basic real assets 
contributing to their value, but those industries alone have gained roughly 
half a million jobs between December 2007 and December 2008.
The government isn’t terribly good at measuring the full job impact of 
intangibles and the qualities that go into producing jobs. Mandel points out 
that intangibles aren’t well measured by the gross domestic product figures 
produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis:

64
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
“However, intangibles do produce jobs. Consider the last business 
cycle, which ran from March 2001 to December 2007. Over that stretch, 
health and education alone added 3.5 million jobs, roughly 63 percent of 
all the net jobs produced by the economy. Altogether, the intangible 
sector accounted for about 75 percent of job growth. By comparison, the 
tangible sector, led by manufacturing, lost some 1.8 million jobs over 
the same period.”
Mandel and many other economic experts are coming to see that intangible 
value goes beyond longtime intangible standards such as goodwill and 
patents. Whole industries are now built around ideas and human skills, and 
in a digital world in which information travels in bits and bytes rather than in 
physical form, that trend will continue.
Determining the Value of a Company 
Based on Ideas
In recent years, the value of an idea-based company has been a very perti-
nent question. Companies such as Enron once were media darlings because 
they seemed to amass tremendous market capitalization and make great 
money despite having very few tangible assets. Yet in 2002 — the year after 
the 9/11 attacks — the country was sinking into recession, and it was tougher 
for Enron to hide the fact that it had little underlying value to support its 
popularity. As was later revealed, deceptive tactics had propped up the 
company. By the late 1990s, much of Enron’s portfolio was shrinking, and its 
assets were being paired with other figures to make the numbers look better.
However, there’s plenty of debate over the valuation of these assets. 
Intangible assets are revolutionizing most markets, yet accounting profes-
sionals are still trying to find a way to value those assets consistently. 
Even though new accounting rules on intangibles went into effect in 2001, 
The New York Times said in a September 2007 article that official accounting 
rules still “give intangibles a wide berth.” In this section, we discuss the 
significance of seeking detailed data when dealing with intangibles.
The importance of real, 
documented income
A company based on ideas may not make money in its first year or two, 
but eventually it has to; otherwise, it’s simply not a company that you 
should buy.

65
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Valuation in a Knowledge Economy
To make that point clear, here are a few thoughts from Warren Buffett, one of 
the world’s richest men and a financial guru best known for his insistence on 
verifying the actual value of anything he buys:
“Your goal as an investor should be to purchase, at a rational price, a 
part interest in an easily understandable business whose earnings are 
virtually certain to be materially higher five, ten, and twenty years from 
now. Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet these 
standards — so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a 
meaningful amount of stock. You must also resist temptation to stray 
from your guidelines: If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, 
don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”
Now, granted, Buffett was talking about investing in the stock of a company, 
not buying the company outright. But really, what’s the difference? Anyone 
who buys a stock is buying at least a piece of a company; the thought pro-
cess that gets you there shouldn’t be any different. You can lose your shirt 
by making a bad decision about value in either case.
We should note that during the go-go 1990s, when the first Internet boom had 
investors jumping in with both feet, Buffett stayed out. People laughed 
because he bluntly stated that he “didn’t understand” most of what the tech 
industry was doing — and in the end, he avoided losing a fortune.
In 2008, he sounded a similar warning to investors such as housing finance 
giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about investing in derivatives — complex 
financial instruments that played a central role in that year’s market crisis. 
“I know the people that run these companies, and they don’t have their 
minds around what is happening,” he said.
 
To get an overall look at what’s happening in the world economy and what 
will eventually happen in your neighborhood, watch smart global investors 
like Buffett. These big investors understand value and have a lot to teach the 
little guys.
Patents are valuable — if you can defend them
Intangible value is a line that keeps moving 
as technology keeps moving forward, and as 
intellectual property increasingly moves 
the economy, protecting that property becomes 
an ever-more-expensive part of staying in 
business.
In recent research, James Besson and Michael 
J. Meurer of Boston University School of Law 
reported that starting in the late 1990s, publicly 
traded companies saw their patent litigation 
costs outstrip patent profits. Besson and Meurer 
concluded that many patents are worthless to 
organizations because of the pace of advancing 
technology and the sheer cost of defending the 
patents in court.

What strategic buyers and 
lenders want to see
A strategic buyer is a person or a company that wants to buy a firm because 
the firm fits nicely with the buyer’s strategy. If the acquired company were to 
do everything that the buyer expected, it would provide a new direction for 
the buyer’s business to go in or just a nice little product niche that could 
stave off competition.
 
As intangibles grow in importance, strategic buyers should demand 
considerably more detail on what those assets are worth in the marketplace. 
Likewise, sellers are going to be asked to create significantly more detail on 
that front. Just be prepared.
Like buyers, lenders want to know their money is being invested in a com-
pany that has real assets and real growth possibilities. As we write this 
book, the United States is navigating its way through one of the worst credit 
crises since the Great Depression. A global economic slowdown brought 
about by the U.S. housing-lending crisis is redefining the way that lenders 
look at prospective borrowers on both the consumer and business sides. 
More than ever, lenders demand solid financials and provable income — 
especially when dealing with intangibles. Any income that companies can’t 
prove won’t be used as a basis for lending.
For info on how risk-taking investors measure the value of an unproven 
company in the first stages of its life, check out Chapter 21.
Lessons from the tech wreck and the credit crunch
The first decade of the 21st century may be 
remembered as one in which businesses and 
investors ignored proper valuation at their peril. 
Trillions of dollars were lost in consumer and 
business markets during 2008, and although 
economic factors were a major part of the prob-
lem, most experts believed that assets ranging 
from real estate to stocks tumbled after lax 
valuation practices left said assets even more 
exposed.
The lesson to take away from these events 
is very simple: Proper valuation keeps the 
chickens from coming home to roost. If you plan 
to buy or sell a business, do your homework so 
that you know exactly which factors make the 
business more or less valuable, and understand 
how local and world economic events beyond 
your control can affect your plans.
Particularly with regard to intangible assets, it’s 
important to work with people who are familiar 
with your target industry and can trace actual 
income to those intangible assets.

 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Valuation in a Knowledge Economy
Reaching Intangible Value
There’s little doubt that intangible assets have some very solid value. 
What would Coca-Cola be without that brand name and more than 
120 years of marketing savvy? Little more than some brown sugar water 
in a shapely bottle.
So-called cloud software — software that’s built, housed, and accessed only 
over the Internet — never rolls off an assembly line. It isn’t a disk that a 
computer user can hold in his hand. But is it still a potentially valuable 
asset? You bet. In this section, we discuss brand value and how it’s related 
to consumer behavior.
Taking a stab at brand valuation
As more of the products that people want leap into the intangible realm, 
accountants, corporate finance officers, and investors may conduct in-depth 
analyses by using three traditional value approaches: cost, market, and 
income. We discuss all three approaches in the following subsections.
 
An accountant or valuation professional needs to use a variety of methods to 
value an intangible asset.
Cost approach
The cost approach to valuation involves calculating what it’d cost another 
business to duplicate the asset from scratch. In the cost approach, you 
estimate current costs or calculate the current value of all the historical 
expenses of creating the brand.
Market approach
The market value calculation involves comparing the past sale transactions 
of the intangible that needs to be evaluated (such as a brand name) and 
making a stab at a similar value. Real estate agents use this approach when 
they recommend a selling price for your house.
The biggest hang-up is finding good data to use for the comparison; 
intangible assets don’t produce a lot of tangible comparison data. Some 
people may have put a price tag on the Coca-Cola brand, for example, 
but valuing the leading submarine-sandwich chain in a city may be a much 
bigger challenge.

68
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
Income approach
The income approach allows you to measure the future benefits (sales, 
earnings, or savings) that the intangible asset in question will deliver to a 
business, estimating when the business will first receive those benefits and 
for how long. This approach shows businesses how much of their income is 
generated by a brand and other intangible assets.
With regard to intangibles, you can break the income approach into several 
possible methods, though gathering data for each method is something of a 
challenge:
 
✓ Discounted cash-flow method: This is used to value some of the most 
widely known intangible assets, such as technology, software, customer 
relationships, noncompete covenants, strategic agreements, franchises, 
and distribution channels. In this method, the value of an asset reflects 
the current value of the projected earnings that the asset will generate, 
taking into account the revenue and expenses of the asset, the relative 
risk of the asset, the contributions of other assets, and a discount rate 
that reflects the time value of invested capital.
 
✓ Relief-from-royalty method: You use this method to value trade names 
and trademarks. This method assumes that the value of an asset is 
equal to all future royalties that would have to be paid for the right to 
use the asset if it were not acquired. A royalty rate is selected based on 
discussions with management regarding the importance of the asset, the 
effectiveness of constraints imposed by competing assets, the ability of 
competitors to produce similar assets, and the market licensing rates for 
similar assets. The royalty rate is used to compute the expected revenue 
generated or associated with the asset. Then the hypothetical royalties 
are discounted to their current value.
 
 Royalty rates for trade names and trademarks vary widely, depending 
on the nature of the proprietary property, its role in the business, the 
specific industry, and the marketplace.
 
✓ Comparable guideline/industry transactions method: This one’s used 
to value Internet domains and names of products such as newspapers or 
magazines. This approach requires comparison data, which can be 
tough to find, so premiums or discounts may be applied to the asset 
given its attributes, earnings power, and other factors.
 
✓ Avoided-cost method: This method is for valuing various kinds of 
technology. This method relies on available historic data. The value of 
the intangible asset is based on the costs that the acquiring company 
avoids by obtaining an existing, fully functional asset rather than 
building or assembling one. Valuation professionals gather data on 
employee salaries connected with the development of that technology, 
as well as on related expenses such as overhead, administrative, travel, 
and meal costs.

 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Valuation in a Knowledge Economy
Recognizing customers 
as valuation drivers
Marketing consultants live for this stuff, but increasingly, new business met-
rics allow business owners to put a value not only on the number of custom-
ers they have but also on how those customers behave. A business metric is a 
customized system of measurement that allows you to figure something out, 
such as what people are spending with your company in certain situations.
Brands are worth little or nothing unless humans are clamoring for the 
products, so getting the most buying behavior out of every group of 
customers you have is a valuation issue. You may have heard about the 
80/20 rule, which states that 80 percent of your business comes from 
20 percent of your customers. As you consider ways to make your business 
more profitable for sale or ways to make a business that you’re planning 
to buy more profitable, it makes sense to find out about the various metrics 
for measuring customers’ behavior — what they spend, why they spend, 
and when they don’t spend.
Why it’s important to value 
intangibles in a downturn
Intangible Business, a London-based brand 
consultancy, maintains that understanding the 
value of intangibles is particularly important 
when the economy is bad. Here’s why:
 ✓ Maximizing value: Valuing assets when the 
economy goes into a downturn allows you 
not only to maximize what you have but also 
to spot opportunities outside the company.
 ✓ Maximizing use of the brand: It’s particu-
larly critical to get the most marketing 
muscle out of a brand in tough times. 
Also, if you find that you do have to sell 
intangibles in a crunch, you won’t risk a 
fire sale.
 ✓ Improving target planning: Understanding 
the value of a brand helps your organization 
set realistic targets for income, profit, sup-
ply-chain management, and staff morale.
 ✓ Improving asset performance: Under-
standing the true value of intangible assets 
strengthens the commercial application of 
those assets, according to Intangible 
Business.
 ✓ Maximizing investment in the brand: 
Without constant investment to maintain 
their value, brands falter. Valuation helps 
determine the right amount of investment to 
produce maximum results.
 ✓ Restoring investor confidence: Today, 
intangible assets must make their way onto 
a balance sheet. Sick brands depress share 
prices, whereas healthy brands do the 
opposite.

70
Part I: What Business Valuation Means 
 
One of the current buzz phrases, balanced scorecard, is a way to present a 
whole bunch of metrics at one time so that you can get a complete picture of 
how customers are behaving.
Big companies typically have more money and better equipment to measure 
what their customers — and noncustomers — think and do, but don’t let that 
fact discourage you. Sometimes, tracking customer behavior can be as simple 
as asking a few good questions at the register or during a sales call. Also, 
some online survey companies allow you to query customers — in exchange 
for a coupon or some other small item of value — about how well or poorly 
you’re doing.
 
If you’re trying to improve the value of your business, or if you’re looking for a 
business that you can make more valuable, talk to marketing experts at your 
local community college, or read all you can about computerized ways to 
track customer behavior in your chosen business and find a way to chart that 
behavior over time. You may even want to exercise a little brand loyalty and 
check out Consumer Behavior For Dummies, by Laura Lake, or Branding For 
Dummies, by Bill Chiaravalle and Barbara Findlay Schenck (Wiley).
Preserving Your Knowledge 
Business for the Future
Accept this fact: All businesses are knowledge businesses. As intangibles 
become more dominant parts of what companies of all sizes do for a living, 
you need to become more sophisticated about how to use the knowledge in 
your business to generate value. Even the most traditional manufacturing 
business needs to have a Web presence, for example, because increasingly, 
the Web drives traffic from both first-time and repeat customers.
Also, if you want to sell the business someday and you don’t necessarily want 
to stick with that business as the new owner’s employee, you need to think 
through how you’ll package the knowledge that you’ve acquired throughout 
your history for eventual sale along with the company. If you know what 
you’re doing, you can price that knowledge at a premium.
Shaky times: When the founder’s 
brain leaves the building
Many major businesses throughout the world are run by personalities — 
people with identities that are inextricably linked to the brand value of 
their companies. Richard Branson of the Virgin umbrella of companies — 
360, at this writing — certainly is one. So is Steve Jobs, one of the founders 
of Apple, Inc.

71
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Valuation in a Knowledge Economy
 
It’s great to have an identity and a well of knowledge that are virtually synony-
mous with the business. But if a company is tied to intangible assets that are 
linked to one person, the danger to the company of that person’s resignation, 
death, or disability becomes greater.
Jobs is an interesting example, because as we write this book, speculation is 
swirling about the state of his health. Jobs beat pancreatic cancer in 2004, 
only to have rumors surface in late 2008 that he may be ill again. In January 
2009, after an announcement weeks before that a “hormone imbalance” was 
affecting his weight, Apple said Jobs would take a six-month leave of absence 
because his medical condition was more serious than first thought. Jobs 
was no more precise than that about his condition. By the end of that month, 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it would investigate 
whether Apple had intentionally kept information from shareholders.
Most companies fear a leadership vacuum when the chief executive officer 
gets sick. At Apple, the speculation seemed to have an unusually serious 
effect on the company’s stock, as well as on its customers, who were setting 
chat rooms on fire around the globe. Because Jobs is not only CEO but also 
the primary driver of the company’s line of ingenious products — the walking 
embodiment of the Apple brand and mystique — fears about his death or 
incapacitation had company watchers wondering what would happen to the 
Apple brand after Jobs.
Consider the aftermath of Walt Disney’s death in 1966. Although the Disney 
company saw significant success at its theme parks over the next 18 years, 
its film and animation units drifted until Walt’s nephew, Roy Disney, unseated 
Walt’s son-in-law, Ron Miller, and brought in Michael Eisner and Frank 
Wells to reenergize the brand. Under that new leadership, the company’s 
undervalued brand was reinvigorated.
What owners need to do: Planning ahead
Owners and founders can’t help being synonymous with the value of their 
businesses at all stages of its growth, but they have to develop a means of 
creating parallel value that can continue with the organizations after they’re 
gone. As we state throughout this book, this situation is why long-term 
transaction planning is so important.
A succession plan is not something that you create merely in case of disaster. 
Creating one is a value-building exercise in itself — proof that when the 
intellectual capital of certain people is removed from the organization for 
any reason, the organization can sustain itself under existing management or 
new owners.
 
Creating business value means capturing and sustaining knowledge for 
next-generation management and owners.

lthough we don’t drown you in numbers and 
computations, we do get a little deeper into the 
valuation process in this part. We talk more about what 
various experts do throughout a valuation and what you 
should know about a company’s financial data going into 
the process. We also introduce a key resource that many 
people use as a starting point for a business valuation: 
rule-of-thumb data.

Chapter 6
Getting Familiar with a Typical 
Valuation Report
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the goal of the valuation
▶ Uncovering the basic offerings of a valuation report
▶ Deciphering what each part of the report means
W
e’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Valuations aren’t driven by 
bricks and mortar sitting on a piece of land. They’re driven by the 
reason someone wants to acquire a business or get rid of one. An asset’s 
value is ultimately driven by the rationale for a transaction. And the goal of 
any valuation (regardless of the purpose) is to answer the question “What 
would happen in the market?”
In this chapter, we discuss the basic elements of a business valuation report, 
with the understanding that no two reports, like no two business valuations, 
should ever be the same. The best valuation reports tell a story about the 
history of a business, its pros and cons, and most importantly, its potential.
Understanding what a finished product should look like is always helpful 
before you start a process, so this chapter also lays out the general elements 
of any business valuation report that you’d pay for from a business valuation 
consultant or appraiser. Reports can vary in length and complexity based on 
the complexity of the job. Here, we give you a very basic starting point so 
you can see how reports present the essential information of valuation.
Note: This chapter, like most of the book, is focused on working with a 
valuation professional in determining what a business is worth. But in 
watching the habits of appraisers, accountants, and estate and tax attorneys, 
you should be gaining insight, too. So as you read, put yourself in the shoes 
of a trained valuation professional each step of the way — you’ll start to 
figure out which facts to focus on and which questions to ask.

76
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
What a Valuation Report 
Is Supposed to Do
A good valuation report, like any piece of quality research, should open your 
mind to possibilities you’ve already considered and maybe a few you haven’t 
thought about. As we mention throughout this book, putting dollar signs in 
your eyes isn’t the job of a quality valuation professional. Nor is it her job to 
search in every corner for value or for data, events, or hidden matters that 
may take value away.
A good appraiser’s job is to provide a third-party, objective opinion on what 
would actually happen if the subject company were for sale on the open 
market. You get a median valuation as the result, but if the appraiser or 
valuation professional is doing her job, you get what’s known as a range 
of values, a compilation of opinions based on various methods of valuing 
those assets.
 
Always ask valuation professionals how many different methods they may 
potentially use to value your particular business and how they’ll communicate 
those results to you.
A valuation report may contain very good news for you and your company or 
for the company you’re hoping to buy. Or it may contain some bad news that 
sends you back to the drawing board but prevents you from making some 
expensive mistakes in the end.
Outlining a Typical Valuation Report
Every valuation professional may have a particular style, but most valuation 
reports follow a certain structure. We cover each section of the report in 
greater detail in the following subsections. For now, though, take a quick look 
at the setup:
 
✓ Cover
 
✓ Valuation summary (including assumptions and limiting conditions)
 
✓ Table of contents
 
✓ Executive summary
 
✓ Valuation summary
 
✓ Valuation assignment
 
✓ Economic outlook
 
✓ Industry outlook

77
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with a Typical Valuation Report
 
✓ Business overview (including cost of capital, discounts, and premiums)
 
✓ Conclusion of value
 
✓ Appendixes (charts, footnotes, glossaries, and more)
A valuation report has no set number of pages. The length depends on the 
complexity of the assignment and the valuation possibilities based on the 
valuation goals being sought.
Cover
A cover’s a cover, right? Well, in addition to looking at all the key information 
about the valuation firm, its contact information and where it’s located, and 
its cool logo, you need to check one piece of key information and make sure 
you understand it: the date. Know whether the printed date is simply the 
date when the report was turned over to you or whether it reflects the official 
date of the valuation.
 
You need to be very clear about all the critical dates in any valuation you com-
mission. The valuation date is critical because if this report is being done for 
tax reasons or eventually becomes evidence in a lawsuit or divorce action, the 
time sensitivity of the analysis becomes all the more important, depending on 
the circumstances of the case.
We talk a lot in Chapter 7 about planning for a sale or any other valuation-
related transaction. Depending on what your plans are, when you do the valu-
ation is a critical step in the process. Valuation isn’t just about the dollar sign 
at the end of the transaction — it’s also about timing.
Valuation summary
Unlike mystery novels, you don’t have to flip to the end of most valuation 
reports to figure out what happens. You can pretty much flip past the cover 
and the table of contents, and then, boom — you find the number you’ve 
been waiting for. It looks something like this:
The fair market value of XYZ Co. is $1.2 million based on a weighting of 
income and market valuation methods.
 
Note the phrase “weighting of income and market valuation methods.” This 
particular company was valued based on the income approach and market-
based comparisons. This fact may not be true for every business, which is 
why you need to do your homework about what kind of valuation approaches 
and methods best fit a business in your situation. Talk over these choices with 
a valuation specialist. We cover approaches and methods in Chapter 4.

78
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Your report will probably also indicate a high/low range for the value of the 
business, based on various valuation approaches and control premiums and 
special situations (including minority ownership, if it applies in your case).
The rest of this section of the report usually delivers the following kinds of 
information.
The assumptions and limiting conditions of the business
This section is a statement of assumptions and conditions on which an 
appraisal is based that the appraiser may or may not have verified. 
A standard valuation may contain a statement that describes items such 
as the following:
 
✓ That the title and legal description of the business are correct
 
✓ That the property is free and clear of liens
 
✓ That the current management and ownership have been verified and 
declared responsible for the business
 
✓ That the factual information received from others in the course of 
creating the report is reliable
 
✓ Notes on the illustrative material
 
✓ Any environmental impact statements that may be relevant
 
✓ That all licenses necessary to operate the property have been obtained
 
✓ That there is evident compliance with zoning and land use regulation
Executive summary
Everyone likes summaries. The executive summary enables you to see the 
critical points in the valuation process.
Purpose of the valuation/ownership structure
This section tells you the assumption of ownership upon which you’re basing 
the valuation. If this business is a target company and you want to own 
100 percent of it, that situation requires certain assumptions and valuation 
methods of its own. Of course, if you’re valuing a portion of the ownership 
instead of 100 percent (if you’ll have a business partner or two, or if you’ll 
own jointly with a spouse or other family members, for instance), you’ll 
see more details on what discounts or premiums have been added to the 
computations to affect that total valuation.
 
In the business valuation context, discounts or premiums are facts that either 
enhance or diminish the salability of a business and, therefore, the amount 
of value.

79
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with a Typical Valuation Report
Standard of value
The standard-of-value section can be combined with one of the opening 
sections. Regardless, you need a statement of the standard of value used 
to create the valuation. Fair market value, fair value, strategic value, and 
intrinsic value all result in different value conclusions based on the type 
of company being considered. (For info on standards of valuation, see 
Chapter 3.)
The subject of valuation and standard of value also helps determine whether 
you need to take various discounts, including discounts for lack of control 
and lack of marketability, as in the case of valuing minority interests in a 
company.
 
If you’ve had your business valued in recent years, keep in mind that the 
same standard of value and methods may not apply based on your goals for 
this valuation. In other words, let the goals and the current structure of the 
company govern which methods to use to complete the valuation. Don’t make 
decisions based on decisions you made before.
Major mistakes that show up on valuation reports
Understanding potentially big gaps in a valua-
tion report is important — after all, you’re paying 
for it. Such problems may include the following:
 ✓ Failing to state the date of the valuation and 
the date the report was prepared; both may 
be critical in a court proceeding
 ✓ Leaving off — or failing to consider — the 
purpose of the valuation
 ✓ Not listing the standard of value for the valu-
ation (fair market and so on)
 ✓ Never doing a proper site visit
 ✓ Not detailing proper assumptions about the 
business and the purpose of its valuation at 
this time
 ✓ Not detailing the industry and the market-
place trends the company will be affected 
by, as well as its current and future eco-
nomic prospects
 ✓ Not reviewing all valuation methods neces-
sary for this particular situation
 ✓ Not defining the kind of earnings used in 
computation, if using the income approach
 ✓ Not going far enough with guideline com-
pany data, if using the market approach for 
comparison
 ✓ Failing to apply the proper discount or capi-
talization rates necessary for the valuation 
methods chosen
 ✓ Failing to disclose all sources of data used 
for comparison

The valuation date
This section covers the particular date the valuation was done. All valuations 
must be set on a particular date to allow the valuation professional to freeze 
a company’s conditions and financials at a moment in time.
Valuation assignment
Yes, describing the assignment after seeing the numbers may seem a little 
backward, but admit it — you wanted to see that dollar figure first, right? 
This section of the report talks more about the features of the company itself.
The valuation key assumption
In a report that aims for clarity, you see something here called the valuation 
key assumptions. Granted, you may want to value a business because you’re 
thinking of selling, but valuation professionals think a little differently. They 
look at all the assets you have and make an assumption based on what they 
think is the best way to monetize those assets. The valuation professional 
may state here that the sum total of assets would be best sold as a whole — 
as in a sale of the company outright — or may state that the assets would 
attract more cash if sold separately.
The assigned valuation date
We start this chapter by discussing how important the valuation date is. Who 
sets the date? Optimally, you or your representative does.
Competent valuation professionals don’t set the date because it’s not their 
job to decide the critical facts of the valuation, and the valuation date may be 
among the most critical. Timing issues should be the purview of buyers and 
sellers, not people who value companies.
In other words, companies that are planning to go on the block immediately 
may want the most recent numbers for the company figured into their valua-
tion picture, particularly if those numbers are perceived to enhance the value 
of what they’re selling. Companies that want to obtain bank financing or 
equity participation in their business may want to set different timelines.
 
If a valuation professional offers to help you set the valuation date, be wary. 
Qualified valuation professionals typically insist on a written recommendation 
from the client or the client’s attorney specifying the exact valuation date. 
That way, they never have to redo the assignment; if the date is wrong or 
changes for any reason, the client or the client’s attorney then must start the 
process all over again.

81
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with a Typical Valuation Report
As we often note, dates can be a critical factor in the valuation process. 
Divorce, estate, and gifting issues are examples in which valuation dates 
certainly matter. As for the ordinary buying and selling of companies, the 
date doesn’t matter as much, but a date must be set at some point. For 
example, the initial valuation of a company may be based on the last full 
year of financials for analysis in a report, but eventually, the year-to-date 
performance of a company will have to be communicated to be part of the 
report or not.
 
A smart buyer or a banker considers any data more than 90 days old to be 
outdated.
Economic outlook
 
Don’t hire any valuation professional who doesn’t watch how world and 
domestic economic factors affect your industry. Anyone can watch business 
channels and read as much as possible about the general state of the 
economy, but a business valuation professional has to know how to apply 
that macro view to the micro world of your business.
Today the most successful companies — even ones that are tiny right now — 
are global, thanks to the reach of the Internet and what it enables even the 
smallest companies to do. Even the smallest manufacturer can develop a 
supply chain that reaches all the way to Central Asia or the Far East. A small 
consultancy can have clients halfway around the world.
When various segments of the world economy experience either good times 
or downturns, valuation professionals can’t turn a blind eye to those trends. 
They must pay full attention to anyone a company is doing business with or 
competing against.
In a valuation report, you should see detailed notes on how the economy is 
playing out, both in general and in particular in your sector of business. 
You’ll probably see economic terms such as the following:
 
✓ GDP: The gross domestic product is the value of all the goods and ser-
vices produced within a given year. The GDP is a crucial way of 
measuring how free businesspeople feel to invest in their businesses 
and increase production.
 
✓ Interest rates: People watch the Federal Reserve Board closely for a 
reason: It sets the general course of what borrowers will pay at all levels 
of the economy. Banks, businesses, and ordinary individuals find it 
easier to borrow and increase their spending when credit is looser; 
when credit is tighter, they slow down. Valuation professionals should 
bring this trend down to the level of the client who has to borrow in a 
particular economic climate.

82
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ Commodity prices and exchange rates: If a business works with particu-
lar raw materials, such as metals, foodstuffs, or energy products, it 
needs to know how costs for those particular items will affect the cost 
of production in the business’s area. Likewise, exchange rates — a 
reflection of the value of world currencies — can have a detrimental or 
a positive effect on a company’s operations overseas. Valuation profes-
sionals need to know where these trends are heading and whether those 
measurements will increase or decrease valuations over a stated term.
 
✓ What Washington plans to do: Political and policy considerations are 
also important drivers of the economy. What the president and the 
nation’s legislators hope to do with regulatory, tax, and energy policy is 
crucial to business. Again, valuation professionals need to know how 
federal legislation will affect state legislation that deals specifically with 
the business in question.
 
✓ Key measurements: Depending on the size of your business and its 
industry, you probably follow a market indicator that measures how 
your sector of the economy is doing. These indicators may include the 
following:
 
• The NFIB Small Business Economic Trends report: The National 
Federation of Independent Business produces a series of research 
reports that describe how small companies feel about their 
businesses right now.
 
• Industry-specific indexes: Pick an industry, and you’ll find an 
index. Many trade publications have developed their own 
economic indexes to measure economic activity.
 
 Equally important, a valuation professional must understand how your 
competitors are doing. If you don’t get the sense that a valuation profes-
sional is asking enough annoying questions about who your competitors 
are, how they’re doing, and whether they’re gaining on you, he’s not 
working to learn enough about your business.
 
✓ The state of capital spending: Capital spending is a driver of economic 
growth. You want to see whether companies anticipate spending more 
to make investments in their business. Even more important is seeing 
where they’re going to make those investments.
 
✓ The state of business financing in general: Most businesses need to 
have some relationship with credit. As we write this book, sources of 
credit are very tight. In preparing to buy or sell a business, a valuation 
professional needs to keep the overall credit environment in mind.
Industry outlook
Valuation professionals are supposed to shine the cold searchlight of 
truth on the state of the subject company’s industry. To value a company 
properly, it’s important to know what the leaders in the industry are doing, 

83
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with a Typical Valuation Report
what their products are, and what their growth prospects are. Valuation 
professionals use news stories, database material, and a host of public and 
private company data to create this story.
As with the rest of the valuation assignment, the industry story isn’t told in 
a snapshot view of what’s going on during the latest year of business. You 
should see comparisons of revenue and operating profit growth for the 
industry over a certain period or whatever is appropriate in the context of 
that industry so you can get an idea of possible three- to five-year prospects 
going forward.
Other factors you see in the industry outlook section of the report include 
the following.
Growth prospects
The valuation professional’s job is to give you an opinion on where your 
company stands on that growth path, but doing due diligence on that 
front is your job as well. If you’re a thoughtful participant — or potential 
participant — in an industry, you owe it to yourself to know something 
about that industry’s growth prospects and where the business in question 
ranks. Otherwise, how can you really trust the information other experts are 
providing you?
Potential threats and benefits for the overall industry
If the company being valued is a manufacturing company in a particular 
industry, such as computers or toys, you’ll likely see a comparison made 
to the overall growth of manufacturing businesses in the United States 
(or internationally as well, if that’s a necessary point of comparison).
Some valuation firms develop their own proprietary systems and formulas to 
further analyze this issue; others simply report what they’re seeing in the 
news and from other trade sources that closely follow the industries. One is 
not necessarily better than the other.
Business overview
Yes, you may know the business you’re in, but you want to see how the 
valuation professional describes what you do. You want to know how much 
they know about you. This section explains the parts of the report’s business 
overview.
 
The median value is just a convenient midpoint; it doesn’t represent the 
revenue multiple for any actual transaction. It indicates that half of the 
revenue multiples are below the median value and half are above. Median 
values depend on the attributes of the firm and the outside data points an 
expert uses to value it.

84
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Your overall financial performance
The overall-financial-performance section usually consists of a one-year 
summary of your target company’s financials, but the report also makes 
many references to the company’s financials over a multiyear period. It may 
be accompanied by a chart of three to seven years of the company’s financial 
performance.
 
Using outside professionals can be invaluable in discovering what your 
business is worth, but try to identify and make friends with people who own 
businesses similar to yours who aren’t competing directly with your company. 
Buy them a meal or coffee and talk to them about what they hear similar 
businesses are going for in your area. If you don’t feel you can just call 
someone up (you really should get over this fear, by the way), try joining a 
chamber of commerce or an industry association that serves your type of 
business. If nothing else, you’ll get to know your competition even better.
How financials were adjusted/normalized (and for what purpose)
Valuation professionals adjust financial figures to accomplish certain goals 
or to facilitate certain valuation methods. These adjustments may be for 
one-time nonrecurring expenses such as a rare lawsuit or maybe capital 
expenditures from a flood or fire.
The adjustments are typically derived from control adjustments. Put in 
simpler terms, one of the tax advantages of owning a privately held business 
is the ability to run certain expenses “through the business.” Owners may 
have family members on the payroll who aren’t essential to the operating of 
the business. Or they may be burying certain personal items that aren’t 
essential to day-to-day business operations. Examples include the following:
 
✓ Cars and car insurance (also boats, airplanes, and vacation homes)
 
✓ Personal travel and entertainment
 
✓ Country club dues
 
✓ Healthcare for family members
 
When maximizing deductions for tax purposes, these control adjustments are 
common. As long as taxpayers are using them properly under the U.S. tax 
code, all should be well. But potential sellers should be prepared to open up 
their books because, many times, these control adjustments are major factors 
in getting to the cash flow used for the income approach. If people are playing 
fast and loose with how they’re preparing their taxes because they’re being 
overly aggressive with running personal items through the business, they 
probably need to take a year or two to clean up the financial statements 
before a sale or valuation. If you want a buyer to pay you for cash flow that 
isn’t readily apparent on the books, you need to be willing to show where “the 
bodies are buried.”

85
 Chapter 6: Getting Familiar with a Typical Valuation Report
Owner’s compensation
Assuming that this company is a small business with a single owner, the 
owner’s-compensation section is where you see the company’s top salary 
benchmarked against that of executives at similarly sized companies in the 
same field. If this salary is above the range, it may be valued outside the 
expense side of the company’s normalized financials: If the business changes 
hands, a new chief executive walking in the door may not need to be paid 
as much. In larger firms with more top officers, you may see a broader 
benchmarking of salary data.
And what happens if a business owner isn’t paying herself a fair market wage 
for the size of her company or business? That in itself may indicate poor 
stewardship of the company you may be planning to buy. And that’s another 
important reason to analyze compensation.
Conclusion of value
The scope and depth of the valuation assignment determine how many 
valuation methods the professional employs in the valuation of the company. 
The report’s conclusion-of-value section devotes space to why each method 
was used and what computations were used to establish the standard 
of value.
You should see a narrative description of each method, along with a chart of 
the computations used in each method.
Methods examined and accepted/rejected
This section discusses the approaches and methods considered and rejected 
(and reasons why), as well as the approaches and methods considered and 
accepted to provide a reasonable conclusion of value.
Explanation of weighting each valuation method
Weighting is an indicator of importance — a ranking. Some valuation 
methods weight certain methods to reach a conclusion of value. Other 
reports do not. That decision depends on the school of thought or 
philosophy of the individual appraiser.
The next stop may be discounts and premiums. That depends on the scope, 
depth, and purpose of the assignment — and may also depend on the 
appraiser’s philosophy. In some instances, the discount and premiums 
are calculated within the method. And in some cases, they’re applied after 
determining the overall value. If they appear after the conclusion of value, the 
professional sets numbers for the following:

86
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ The firm’s control premium: This premium represents what an 
interested suitor — or existing shareholder — would pay to get majority 
control of a firm.
 
✓ The firm’s marketability discount: This discount, a factor that actually 
decreases the value of a company, is tied to various factors that make a 
business tougher to sell.
Marketability discount is a natural issue for private companies because their 
shares do not trade on public markets and their value isn’t set publicly on a 
daily basis. Experts can apply various methods to come up with the discount 
that must be applied, including the restricted stock method, the IPO method, 
and the option pricing method.
You may also hear about the liquidity premium — it’s an extra reward that 
investors demand for tying up money in the firm for a longer period of time 
than they may otherwise choose.
Appendixes
Here you see specific information describing the expert and the valuation 
firm he works for, notes on exhibits and charts, and other descriptive 
material you’d see in any report. Some valuation firms list a specific glossary 
in the appendixes to make sure everyone understands the terms discussed 
throughout the report.

Chapter 7
Meeting the Supporting Players 
in the Valuation Process
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering situations in which you may need experts
▶ Knowing the kinds of experts who can be useful in a business valuation
▶ Seeing how valuation experts are trained
W
hether you end up doing the valuation yourself or enlist help is up to 
you. Yet we’re big believers in getting help, as long as you do your 
homework beforehand and get the right help. We’re not saying that you have 
to bring in a squadron of experts to do a simple valuation, but you should 
consult certain professionals before you do anything based on your situation. 
In fact, in a lot of situations, you definitely don’t want to try this at home. 
This chapter focuses on the key professionals in this process, what kind of 
situations they fit, and how to hire the best people.
 
Your business finances and personal finances are inextricably linked. If you’ve 
never been in business, this fact is one of the first things you find out. So what 
does that have to do with valuation? When you start thinking about business 
valuation, your number one objective is to know not only how the value of 
your business affects the course of your business strategy but also how it 
influences your personal finances, including the people you may need to hire 
along the way. No one ever went into business to get poor, so your valuation 
strategy has to complement any particular tax, estate, or retirement strategy 
you’ve built. If you’ve never thought about this stuff, then start. We talk much 
more about the link between business and personal finances in this chapter 
and throughout the book.
Getting Help in Valuing Your Business
As some people whined through grammar school, high school, and college, 
“Math is hard!” But valuation goes beyond math. It’s the assessment of a 
business’s hard and intrinsic assets to determine its moneymaking power in 

88
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
the hands of the same owner or a new owner years from now. Not all those 
items can be totaled up on a calculator (we get more into that issue in 
Chapter 8, where we discuss financial statements).
Business valuation occurs when offers or deals are on the table, of course, 
but business valuation is best used as an ongoing strategic tool to determine 
the best time to expand, contract, enter, or exit a business. Valuation can 
be necessary in light of many other circumstances — such as succession, 
divorce, death of a founder, or erosion in markets — that may signal a good 
time to sell or liquidate a business. Keep in mind that “sale” reasons for an 
owner may indicate a “buy” opportunity for the right outsider.
But back to the need for help: Why bother with experts? Very few people can 
keep their business and personal finances at their fingertips. Small-business 
people are busy and often distracted. A trade-off occurs in focus between 
business finances and personal finances, as well as in the lifestyle issues 
that necessarily fill your time — family, friends, and sometimes even leisure. 
People who have the skills to toggle among all these areas with all the infor-
mation they need to make the right decisions are rare.
 
People with the right money skills may still lack a quality essential to the valu-
ation process: objectivity. Asking an owner to value his business objectively is 
a bit like asking a parent to identify which of his kids is smartest. Most entre-
preneurs are too close to their businesses to value them without bias, so you 
need detached experts and sources of information to rely on. This is why the 
valuation process rests on the shoulders of people who understand not only 
the financial aspects of your business but also its future value and what effect 
a sale or other transaction may have on your estate, your retirement plans, or 
your plans to get involved in a new business.
Here’s a quick list of the people who commonly participate in the business 
valuation process. We list them in alphabetical order — Hollywood style — 
so you don’t get the idea that one is more important than another. Having all 
these professionals show up in a single deal is rare, but it happens.
 
✓ Accountants and auditors
 
✓ Appraisers
 
✓ Business brokers
 
✓ Business consultants
 
✓ Business intermediaries
 
✓ Divorce and family-law attorneys
 
✓ Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) attorneys
 
✓ Estate attorneys

89
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
✓ Financial planners and advisors
 
✓ Tax attorneys
Generally, you can break this list down into four categories based on the type 
of help you need. The Big Four are
 
✓ Appraisers
 
✓ Accountants
 
✓ Attorneys
 
✓ Brokers
We discuss the Big Four in more detail later in this chapter. First, though, you 
need to know how to pick out the best people to help you.
Recognizing situations that 
call for valuation experts
Almost more valuation situations exist than one can count, but here are the 
most common situations that require the help of professionals who are 
familiar with valuation processes:
 
✓ Everyday sales and purchases of businesses: Valuations are made at 
the time when businesses are bought and sold — or when companies 
plan to merge.
 
✓ Purchase price allocation: Purchase price allocation is the process of 
assigning fair values to all major assets and liabilities of an acquired 
company as part of a merger or purchase. This issue should be 
addressed early enough to ensure that all the parties understand the 
deal and that there’s a meeting of the mind on how each party will be 
affected from a tax perspective.
 
✓ Estate and gift taxes: This situation involves establishing the fair market 
value of gifts and bequeathed assets that may fall under the scrutiny of 
the Internal Revenue Service.
 
✓ Marital dissolution (better known as divorce or annulment): This 
situation involves valuing assets that will be split between a couple.
 
✓ Employee stock ownership plans (ESOP): An ESOP is a tax-qualified 
plan that an owner can use to meet her goals in business succession, 
diversification of assets, estate planning, or property settlements in a 
divorce, or as an exit strategy from a business.

90
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ A company’s liquidation or reorganization: Valuation occurs when a 
company fails or is forced to file for bankruptcy protection (also known 
as reorganization).
 
✓ Buy/sell agreements: Buy/sell agreements are made between partners 
or co-owners, spelling out the circumstances and terms under which 
shares of the business or partnership will be transferred to one owner 
from the other.
 
✓ Stockholder disputes: In public companies, stockholders may take issue 
with the pricing of various assets in merger or sale deals, and valuation 
may be required as a defense in court.
 
✓ Financing: Lenders want proof of the value of assets as collateral if they 
plan to loan a company money.
 
✓ Ad valorem taxes: For most people, ad valorem taxes involve a garden-
variety method of computing property taxes on residential and 
commercial property. Yet businesses like to confirm that they’re not 
being overtaxed, so the frequently do valuation for this purpose.
 
✓ Incentive stock options: Accounting regulations require more rigorous 
valuation of incentive stock options to hold up in court when employees 
and shareholders dispute their value.
 
✓ Initial public offerings: Before public stock can be issued, investors like 
to see the certification of value of both tangible and intangible assets in 
a company.
 
✓ Damages litigation: When lawsuits are filed for any number of reasons, 
both defendants and plaintiffs may need assistance with valuation.
 
✓ Charitable contributions: For tax reasons, people may need to put a 
valuation on various assets donated to charitable institutions.
 
✓ Eminent domain actions: If a property owner finds her land or facilities 
condemned by the government, she definitely wants to challenge the 
government’s fair-value estimate of that property before she agrees to 
an amount.
Finding the experts you need
Keep in mind that good professionals know other good professionals. For 
fledging entrepreneurs, the best professionals in the valuation process may 
come from the following sources:
 
✓ Professionals you’re already working with: If you’re working with a tax 
expert such as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or a tax attorney, 
start talking to that expert about people who are best qualified to help 
you with various stages of the valuation process.

91
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
✓ People you network with: Granted, valuation is something you don’t 
want to broadcast too loudly — unless you really want someone 
to know that you’re planning to buy or sell a business. Start working 
with discreet people you trust in professional or industry groups and 
even in alumni groups in which you’re active.
 
✓ Local professional associations: Local societies for attorneys, financial 
planners, appraisal organizations, and accountants typically list 
specialists in various disciplines.
Seeking the qualities your 
experts should have
As you begin the valuation process, it helps to understand the concept of 
self-interest when you’re bringing in experts to help you value your business. 
These experts are professionals with their own interests at heart: They’re in 
business for themselves.
They also need to understand your motivations for valuation, and they need 
to demonstrate the following traits:
 
✓ Independence/objectivity: As much as you want to see an asset grow 
in value, you need professionals to appraise and value those assets 
without bias. That means that in reviewing your financial statements, 
interviewing executives, and eyeballing the physical aspects of your 
business, they need to rely on recognized standards of value — not 
merely on your influence because you’re paying them.
 
✓ Confidentiality: Even if you’re paying for honest, unbiased advice, you 
need to make sure that your goals are protected from people on the 
outside who could interfere with your plans. The professionals you 
bring into the process need to gather and process information legally, 
but they also need to be savvy about your need for discretion and 
confidentiality.
 
✓ Industry awareness: Experts need to know the current market backward 
and forward. There’s really no single correct price for a business, but 
the experts have to price your assets fairly, relative to the market.
 
✓ Clarity about fees: Cost isn’t the only factor involved in selecting 
professional help, but an understandable fee structure is key.
 
✓ Clarity about dispute resolution: The best valuation processes may not 
be dispute-free. Before you enter into any professional agreement, dis-
cuss how both sides will handle disputes and differences if they happen. 
You ask not because you anticipate trouble but because you want to 
prevent it.

92
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
 One point about disputes over valuation: Many professional-services 
firms write specific language about arbitration or mediation into 
any contract you sign to hire them. This language may mean that 
you won’t be able to sue the firm later for results that you find inade-
quate. Arbitration is a common dispute-resolution technique in many 
industries, so make sure you understand the process.
As you zero in on the valuation process, certain experts who do very specific 
things. The next section introduces a few.
Appraising What Appraisers Do
Appraisers are trained to analyze and set the value of a particular kind or 
category of asset. The best appraisers aren’t utility hitters; they’re specialists 
who not only have specific training in finance and accounting techniques but 
also have deep experience in certain industries or ownership situations that 
call for valuation, such as divorce, lawsuits, or bankruptcies.
Why can’t the CPA who does your taxes do a business appraisal? He may 
have a sharp eye for figures, but in most cases, appraisal is a separate 
discipline. Appraisal involves many of the same basic financial skills that 
accountants and other finance majors are trained in, but appraisers also 
need other skills. They need to be able to do the following:
 
✓ Read and dissect a balance sheet so that they can compare and analyze 
various assets for current and future value
 
✓ Behave like detectives, questioning officers, management, and staff 
members about the current and future value of various assets
 
✓ Measure the value of both tangible (physical) and intangible 
(idea-based) assets
 
✓ Function under significant time pressure in many cases
 
✓ Write clear, extensive, detailed reports on findings
 
✓ Be able to defend their findings in court if they’re challenged
Most chief financial officers (CFOs) and accountants don’t have the time or 
the skills to do what qualified appraisers do. Nor are they truly independent 
of the organizations being valued. A CFO is to an appraiser what a police 
chief is to a crime-scene investigator: The top financial officer of a company 
oversees the big picture on valuation, whereas an appraiser gets called in to 
go over financial evidence with a fine-toothed comb. Simply put, appraisers 
strap on the gloves and do the detail work.

93
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
In reality, most appraisers don’t get called in to do what they do for compa-
nies with less than $1 million in revenue, because local standards of value or 
written guides provide benchmarks for these kinds of deals.
Before you hire an appraiser, know exactly what you’re going to need to 
appraise. Individual appraisers generally specialize unless they’re in a rural 
area, where they may have to know and evaluate several kinds of businesses. 
If you have a rural farm-implements dealership, bring in someone who knows 
that business, not someone who just does real estate or retail stores. If you 
have a variety of assets to appraise, however — such as intellectual property, 
land, property, and equipment — an appraisal firm or valuation practice may 
need to subcontract out your job.
How appraisers are trained and certified
Most business appraisers have four-year college degrees with majors in 
accounting or finance. Their career paths can take several forms. These indi-
viduals may eventually operate as independents, but they may initially join 
appraisal firms or sign on as full-time or contracted experts with law firms 
that need valuation services.
Where rule-of-thumb valuations come in
The purchase of even a simple business can get 
pretty complex, and in all financial transactions, 
people have a natural need to simplify what’s 
going on. (Hey, that’s the hallmark of a For 
Dummies book: making the complex simple!) So 
in the valuation world, where things can get 
mighty complex, you hear the phrase rule-of-
thumb valuation a lot.
A rule-of-thumb valuation is a guideline that 
people use in a particular industry or line of 
business to value a company when it’s bought 
or sold. The greatest thing about using rule of 
thumb is that it’s a great way to jump-start your 
valuation research. You can get up to speed 
on businesses in a particular industry so that 
your research and work with professionals can 
continue in more depth.
In Chapter 9, we work with some examples 
from the annual Business Reference Guide 
(Business Brokerage Press), by leading valua-
tion author Tom West, to show you what rule-
of-thumb valuations look like. Jim also adds his 
own commentary. Business Reference Guide is 
a leading encyclopedia of rules of thumb on 
valuing businesses ranging from private 
accounting firms to wireless communication 
franchises.
You’ll also hear the term benchmarking. 
In the context of valuation, this term means 
everyday costs and expenses particular to a 
category of business, such as the kind of 
wages people get or certain performance mea-
surements.
Rules of thumb are guidelines, nothing more. 
Throughout this book, we talk about working 
with experts who can help you with valuing a 
business for a variety of scenarios.

One of the most important reasons for appraisers to join an existing firm is 
for continuing education. New graduates generally don’t have a specialty, but 
over time and with funded education, they develop one, and that specialty 
boosts their value in the marketplace. (See, careers can be valued as well.)
New college graduates with a background in finance need class time and 
work hours to qualify for a particular valuation certification. According to the 
American Society of Appraisers (ASA), such certifications include the ones 
we list in Table 7-1.

What appraisers cost
Business appraisers primarily charge based on the complexity — and 
the time constraints — of the valuation required. If you’re looking for a 
rough estimate, a rule of thumb is a basic starting point (For details, read 
Chapter 9).
Business valuation isn’t all about green eyeshades and sweat equity. As in 
most industries, computerization has made a huge difference in business 
valuation, bringing tons of information to valuation experts via databases and 
making critical computations easier. Ask a potential valuation professional 
how much of her work she does on a computer and whether the computer 
frees her to do more onsite work or other hands-on tasks.
For business valuations tied to specific situations, however — potential 
purchases or sales, divorce valuations, partnership dissolutions, and so 
on — the appraiser spends much more time analyzing corporate figures 
(which may require an audit by a CPA), inspecting assets, and talking 
with executives about those assets. Depending on the size of the company 
and the challenges to be met, the fee for the appraiser can easily be 
thousands of dollars — and sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.
 
Some valuation professionals charge fixed fees based on particular types 
of valuation assignments, but you aren’t limited to that fee if the process 
takes longer for any reason. Know in advance what may “unfix” a fixed-fee 
arrangement.

96
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Appraisals that are certified by the appraiser usually cost more because they 
tend to be more detailed. A certified appraisal may include items such as the 
following:
 
✓ An overview of local, national, and international economic factors that 
affect this particular company and its industry, and what factors may 
affect the company and industry in the future
 
✓ A review of five years’ worth of financial statements, as well as a review 
of tax returns and other financial documents for clarity and accuracy
 
✓ A balance-sheet analysis and review of the depreciation schedule, 
including adjustments for machinery, equipment, and other assets to 
come up with fair market value
 
✓ A detailed presentation of the valuation of a company based on several 
valuation methods that a future buyer or seller may demand
 
✓ Onsite visits to gather data and present findings
Anyone hiring a business appraiser should talk to at least two or three 
prospects to get an idea of his fees and his work process (which we cover in 
the next section).
How to examine a business 
appraiser’s work process
Work process is all about the assignment — the actual thing or company that 
needs valuation.
The size and scope of an appraisal assignment determine the appraiser’s 
work process in establishing the fair market value of a single asset or a whole 
company. Size and scope define the time that the appraiser needs to spend 
on the job, as well as the number of assets and related issues that she needs 
to review as part of the valuation process.
The simplest valuation assignments don’t require a face-to-face meeting; 
a phone call and a few keystrokes into a database later, a very general 
dollar amount emerges as the value of a particular company. But when 
the company’s revenue exceeds $1 million and the reasons for doing the 
valuation are more complex, the assignment requires the following tasks:
 
✓ Extensive research of the company’s industry and its prospects
 
✓ Interviews with company officers
 
✓ Onsite visits to see the physical facilities and assets being valued

97
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
✓ Exchange of information with company attorneys and tax experts
 
✓ Creation of reports and presentations on intermediate or final findings
 
✓ Possible after-valuation activities, including testifying in court or in 
deposition, usually priced as a separate item
 
The best valuation efforts are planned and comfortably scheduled for the 
scope of the project. When interviewing valuation professionals, ask them 
how long a typical valuation process takes and what they consider a rush job; 
otherwise, you may end up paying more for a quick valuation that doesn’t give 
you as much depth as you need. Of course, smart valuation professionals 
know their limits and communicate them.
What to ask a prospective 
business appraiser
Much of how your valuation will go is determined by the questions you ask 
a professional before you hire him. Here are some basics:
 
✓ What’s your specialty? (Ideally, you’ve checked this information 
beforehand, but let the prospect describe his expertise to you.)
 
✓ What are your training and certification?
 
✓ What basic information will you need from me to estimate the job, and 
what kind of information will you need from me on an ongoing basis?
 
✓ What do you think the features of this appraisal will be, and how long 
could the appraisal take?
 
✓ Is there a cost range you’re prepared to offer at this time? If not 
now, when?
 
✓ Will you need to call in other experts to complete the valuation based 
on the assets I need you to value?
 
✓ How much experience have you had in valuing companies like mine 
(or like the one I want to buy)?
 
✓ I have specific reasons for valuing this company. Have you dealt with 
those circumstances in other valuations you’ve done?
 
✓ What did you find out about my company and me before we got here?
 
✓ Offhand, do you know what valuation methods you might use in 
computing fair market value for my company?
 
✓ How will we deal with each other during the valuation process, and how 
will I be apprised of your progress?

98
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ Can you show me an example of what a finished appraisal report will 
look like? Will you meet with me and my colleagues when you’re done 
and present those results?
 
✓ What happens if I have a problem with your results? What dispute-
resolution process do you typically follow?
 
Beware of any valuation professional who automatically dismisses any 
valuation as “simple” without asking pointed questions about what you’re 
trying to do.
Taking Account of Accountants
Granted, most people generally know what accountants do, but accountants 
are key to the valuation process for one critical reason: They’re part of 
an essential checks-and-balances system that you need to guarantee the 
integrity of your results.
Accountants find themselves in a variety of roles and subspecialties, but here 
are the major work areas for accountants who are involved in the practice of 
valuation:
 
✓ Public accountants: They do basic accounting, auditing, tax, and 
consulting activities for individuals, companies, government entities, 
and nonprofit organizations.
 
✓ External auditors: These are the detectives of the accounting profes-
sion. Their job is to certify the integrity of an organization’s or an 
individual’s financial results. The specialty of forensic accounting 
(which we cover later in this list) also falls into this category. In most 
cases, auditors hold the CPA designation.
 
✓ Internal auditors: Internal auditors work inside a company (usually a 
large company) to verify the effectiveness of the organization’s internal 
controls and to check for mismanagement, waste, or fraud. Their 
job is to ensure the integrity of the company’s records and financial 
systems. Subspecialists may audit a firm’s technology, environmental, or 
compliance functions.
 
✓ Management accountants (also called cost, managerial, industrial, 
corporate, or private accountants): These people record and analyze 
financial data for the companies that employ them. They prepare finan-
cial reports for stockholders, creditors, regulatory agencies, and state 
and federal tax authorities. They also prepare the reports that outside 
valuation professionals will review.
 
✓ Tax accountants: These are perhaps the best-known variety of accoun-
tants. They confirm that a company’s or individual’s tax filings are 
completed with accurate and truthful information and are compliant 
with local, state, and federal tax guidelines.

99
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
✓ Forensic accountants: Forensic accountants are accounting profession-
als who may be brought in to investigate potential fraud or mismanage-
ment in a business. These professionals combine their knowledge of 
accounting and finance with law and investigative techniques to deter-
mine whether an activity is illegal. Sometimes, they work for or with law 
enforcement. Their investigative skills may be specific to a particular 
kind of firm, so they may be very specialized in what they do. For more 
on how forensic accounting works, turn to Chapter 17.
 
 Blame it on CSI: In 2007, U.S. News & World Report ranked forensic 
accounting as one of the 20 hottest jobs in the country.
Assuming that they’re doing their jobs correctly, accountants are critical in 
verifying that a company’s finances, assets, procedures, and controls are 
exactly what they say they are on both sides of a transaction.
Accountants also get training to do business valuations. In fact, over the past 
20 years, many more have sought certification to provide those services 
within their firms. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(AICPA) has drafted a new set of operating standards to make sure services 
are uniform. Go to the AICPA’s Web site at aicpa.org for more information.
For most small-business people, accountants are indispensable parts of their 
advisory team, not just on valuation issues but also on all aspects of business 
planning. For many small businesses, the outside accounting firm is the 
company’s finance and planning brain trust, so questions about a firm’s 
approach to valuation services should be part of the hiring mix.
How accountants are trained
In the past 25 years, the specialization boom in general business training has 
extended to financial jobs. Whereas Bob Cratchit may have been a typical 
accountant more than two centuries ago, simply recording transactions 
in and out of a business nonstop on a daily basis, today’s accountants are 
prepared not only to handle numbers but also to interpret and position those 
numbers strategically for the future of the business.
In most larger businesses, the CFO’s job has gone from being largely a 
background position to a key strategic post. Before, CFOs were primarily 
the guys — and most were guys — who told the chief executive officer and 
the board whether any money was available to do what they wanted to do 
with the business. That situation has changed significantly in the age of 
Enron. Businesses that have high transparency — numbers that a person can 
make sense of quickly — get high marks for honesty and reputation.

100
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Today’s CFOs may have used their accounting skills during tours of duty in 
marketing, planning, information technology, and many other departments in 
a typical company. The need for financial controls has become much more 
prevalent on all levels of a business.
Dare we say it? Have accounting skills become sexy in the 21st century? At 
the very least, they’ve become much more critical to a business’s reputation 
and identity.
 
If the Enron era has taught American business anything, it’s the importance of 
the need for financial controls. Good financial controls in any business, large 
or small, are critical to any business valuation. If the numbers can’t be trusted, 
it’s difficult to put a fair price on the business.
Today’s accountants get their training at all levels. Many start with basic 
bookkeeping courses in high school and move on to two-year and four-year 
accounting degrees at the college and university level, which prepare 
them for entry-level jobs in government, corporations, and dedicated 
accounting firms.
Accounting training has moved up the specialization scale in most recog-
nized college business programs, particularly at the master’s level. The most 
highly ranked Master of Business Administration programs in the country 
have a recognized finance track that goes beyond basic accounting into 
training in dealing with domestic and foreign assets. As the business world 
has gone global, accountants need to be able to manage the finances and 
assets of global industries.
How accountants are certified
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, any accountant filing a report 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is required by law to be 
a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). This requirement includes senior-level 
accountants working for or on behalf of public companies that are registered 
with the SEC.
CPAs are licensed by state boards of accountancy. Any accountant who 
passes a national exam and meets the other requirements of the state where 
she practices can become a CPA.
The Department of Labor reports that as of 2007, 42 states and the District 
of Columbia required CPA candidates to complete 150 semester hours 
of college coursework — 30 hours beyond the usual four-year bachelor’s 
degree. CPAs don’t have an easy certification process. All states use the 
four-part Uniform CPA Examination prepared by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

101
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
The CPA examination is tough; fewer than half of those who take it each year 
pass every part they attempt on the first try. Candidates aren’t required to 
pass all four parts at the same time, but most states require candidates to pass 
all four sections within 18 months of passing their first section.
The CPA exam is now computerized and is offered two months out of every 
quarter at various testing centers throughout the United States. Most 
states also require applicants for a CPA certificate to have some accounting 
experience, but requirements vary by state or jurisdiction.
For CPAs, the AICPA offers the option to receive any or all of the Accredited 
in Business Valuation (ABV), Certified Information Technology Professional 
(CITP), and Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) designations:
 
✓ The ABV designation requires the completion of a written exam and at 
least ten business valuation projects that demonstrate the candidate’s 
experience and competence.
 
✓ The CITP designation requires the achievement of a set number of 
points awarded for business technology experience and education.
 
✓ Candidates for the PFS designation also must achieve a certain level of 
points based on experience and education, pass a written exam, and 
submit references.
Other certification programs are available to accounting specialists in 
auditing, tax preparation, government accounting, and forensic accounting.
What accountants cost
We’re going to sound like a broken record again: The cost depends on the job 
you’re paying an accountant to do. Most accountants are like attorneys in 
that they charge by the hour rather than a fixed fee for a particular task. 
Some require an annual retainer to serve your business and add specific fees 
based on regular tasks or jobs that crop up suddenly.
Even tax preparation — which used to be a steady, fixed-fee business — 
has moved away from that pay structure due to the complexity of many 
individuals’ finances. To a certain degree, retail tax preparation firms such as 
H&R Block have kept those fees low.
As we indicate earlier in this chapter, valuation training is now part of life at 
many accounting firms, and if you think you’ll have a need for those services, 
they should be part of your shopping process. Any time you hire an accoun-
tant, list every possible service you may need and ask him to explain whether 
you can negotiate pricing based on that package of services and what activi-
ties still need to be priced à la carte.

102
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
The dominance of computer-based financing programs such as Quicken have 
made it possible for most small businesses to track their own finances, which 
is definitely a good thing. But computer-based programs really provide basic 
bookkeeping. Unless you have specific training in finance and tax issues, it’s 
probably better to turn those numbers over to an accounting professional, not 
only for tax reasons but also to help determine a growth and exit strategy for 
your business.
How to examine an accountant’s 
work process
Depending on their assignment, accountants may see you once a year and 
work with your numbers intensively for a few weeks at tax time, or they may 
be regular contacts year-round. If you have an accountant working within 
your business, that contact can be daily. But most small businesses work 
with outside accountants either annually or quarterly (for those that are 
incorporated and want assistance filing their quarterly reports).
 
Do you really need an accountant? If your business is small and relatively 
uncomplicated and all you need is someone to handle your tax filings, you 
may want to consider hiring an enrolled agent instead — someone who’s 
trained specifically by the IRS to handle tax returns. The good thing about 
experienced CPAs is that they tend to have more experience working 
with financial planners and estate specialists in helping you form an overall 
financial plan.
With computerization, most accountants never have to walk into your offices 
to do their job, and with the Internet, you may never need to walk into 
theirs. Digital tracking, shipment, and computation of financial data has 
made the whole accounting and financial planning process simpler and more 
widespread, and accountants have their own computer programs that help 
speed their jobs along. Although accountants definitely burn the midnight oil 
at tax time, their volume of business is now significantly larger thanks to the 
digital revolution.
What to ask a prospective accountant
Because this book is about valuation instead of overall accounting tasks, 
we base our suggested questions on how an accountant will factor into your 
valuation strategy (if you want to find out more about accounting, we’ll refer 
you to Accounting For Dummies, by John A. Tracy, CPA):

103
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
✓ What are your qualifications and training?
 
✓ Based on my size and type of business, what kinds of valuation services 
do you recommend, and when should I have them done?
 
✓ From a tax and accounting perspective, what can be done over the 
course of time to boost the value of my business?
 
✓ What experience does your firm have in valuing sole proprietorships, 
corporations (C and S), partnerships, and companies with significant 
operations outside the United States?
 
✓ What valuation methods would you apply to my operation if I were to 
put it on the block tomorrow?
 
✓ Tax planning is great, but what can you do to help my business grow? 
Will you help me set benchmarks that measure how my business is 
doing and when I should either quit or sell?
 
✓ Will your firm offer advisory services for my personal finances as well as 
my business finances? Can you also do legal referrals?
 
✓ Will you work with computerized files, or can you still work with paper 
documents and paper receipts (the old shoebox method)?
Hiring Advocacy: Attorneys
Attorneys are paid advocates. They may work in any of dozens of specialties. 
In the context of business valuation, they may have nothing to do with the 
actual appraisal work that goes into a valuation ordered by you or another 
party, but it’s their job to make sure that valuation findings are legitimate and 
that they serve your best interest.
Several legal specialties are prevalent in valuation:
 
✓ Estate attorneys: These folks help you formulate wills, trusts, and 
other power-of-attorney documents that guide both your personal and 
business lives. They have the skills to work with accountants and other 
personal finance professionals to create a seamless financial strategy 
that serves your personal and business lifestyles. They care about 
business valuation because the business is what’s funding your family 
and your future.
 
✓ Divorce attorneys: Divorce attorneys administer the breakup of a 
marriage and, often, the breakup of a business. Although those who 
specialize in family law may defer to other attorneys and accountants 
who are more immediately familiar with your business and personal 
finance strategies, they should have basic training in coordinating any 
movements with your business assets in divorce court.

104
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ Tax attorneys: Tax attorneys understand state, local, and federal tax 
codes. They handle tax challenges from the government and devise 
legal planning strategies that minimize the taxes that a business has to 
pay. They need to care about valuation because assets are taxed based 
on value.
 
✓ Bankruptcy/liquidation attorneys: The valuation question comes into 
sharp focus in troubled companies. Bankruptcy attorneys help clients 
get fair market value on assets that must be sold to repay debt, court 
settlements, and other amounts.
 
✓ Corporate attorneys: These people help entrepreneurs draw up papers 
to establish the structure of a business, which can be important for how 
assets are valued.
In the context of valuation, attorneys may assist in the following tasks:
 
✓ Purchase or sale of a business
 
✓ Separation of property during a divorce
 
✓ Creation of an estate plan
 
✓ Ownership assignment of assets in a prenuptial agreement
 
✓ Creation of ESOPs
 
✓ Structure and draft partnership agreements
 
✓ Defense of clients in litigation challenging the value of a company, 
organization, or partnership
 
✓ Drafting of wills, powers of attorney, and various directives affecting the 
future of a business after the owner is incapacitated or deceased
 
✓ Defending tax challenges from local, state, and federal authorities
How attorneys are trained and certified
Attorneys are trained at law schools with a typical three-year course of 
study, though some colleges offer graduate training to create dual graduate 
degrees in the law and other areas, such as JD(Juris Doctor)/MBAs, better 
known as a combined law degree and MBA degree. Other attorneys may 
also train as accountants and gain a considerable amount of expertise in 
calculating valuation.
Most lawyers, however, come out of school with very little direct training in 
business and certainly not in valuation. For those attorneys, such training 
generally takes place after employment; they may train through apprentice-
ship at their law firms or seek outside training in the certification programs 
we mention in Table 7-1, earlier in this chapter.

105
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
Attorneys really aren’t certified in the practice of law; rather, they’re cleared 
for the practice of law by taking the bar exam of the state in which they plan 
to practice. Attorneys may elect to train for certification in valuation.
What attorneys cost
Unlike valuation experts, attorneys typically charge by the hour, not by the 
job. Market rates, the attorney’s prominence, and the complexity of the 
assignment affect the fees, which can total hundreds of dollars per hour. It’s 
not possible to give a price range for attorney fees for any particular aspect 
of a business transaction, which is why you need to quiz attorneys about 
their fees when you interview them.
How to examine an attorney’s 
work process
An attorney’s work process very much depends on the assignment. If an 
attorney is a specialist in family law and the issue is the splitting up of the 
family business in a divorce, the assignment will require not only a valuation 
of the business (likely contracted out to a valuation professional) but 
also the attorney’s advice on how the business will be split based on that 
valuation and supervision of the negotiations going forward. If the divorce is 
a relatively friendly one, that friendliness may save thousands of dollars in 
attorney fees.
 
When you consider an attorney to handle a dispute, ask whether any part of 
the process could be contracted out to a licensed mediator. Most law firms 
recommend local licensed mediation firms if both parties are inclined to do 
their own talking. The mediator records the results. This process is generally 
cheaper than having attorneys handle negotiations.
What to ask a prospective attorney
Hiring an attorney can be daunting, particularly if you anticipate that this 
person will be advising your business over a long period of time. But it 
can be even more difficult if you’re dealing with a stressful situation such as 
bankruptcy or divorce. Here are some general questions to ask a prospective 
attorney before you hire her:
 
✓ What is your approach to your specialty?
 
✓ How do you work with valuation? Are you certified to judge valuation 
questions, or do you need to subcontract with experts?

106
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ Do you have an opinion on how my company should be valued?
 
✓ Do you deal with companies in my situation often? Is there anything 
different about the way you’d handle my business?
 
✓ What is your fee, and is there a way for me to control expenses?
 
✓ What other experts do you need to bring into the process?
 
✓ What do I need to do in this process?
 
✓ What timetables do I need to be aware of?
Brokers: One-Stop Valuation 
and Sale Services
Business brokers are unique among valuation players because they may 
or may not represent your interests. Take a step back and think about the 
meaning of the word broker. A real estate broker can work for you — if 
you hire him — or work against you if he’s working for the opposing buyer 
or seller.
Whenever you work with any kind of valuation expert, you always need to 
understand whether that expert’s interests mesh with your own. Business 
brokers are one-stop valuation and sale services for businesses. They do the 
following things:
 
✓ Help buyers and sellers of privately held business complete a buy or sell 
transaction
 
✓ Help clients price and market a business, including providing valuation 
services
 
✓ Specialize in particular industries, which allows them to get closer to 
particular valuation questions
 
✓ Work with both sides of the transaction in preparing a property for sale, 
bringing in potential buyers, facilitating due diligence, and negotiating 
with both parties
Brokers may also hold real estate licenses in case their clients need to 
market real estate assets.
 
In some states, businesses can be sold only by registered real estate agents. 
Be aware that if the business broker you work with does not have a real estate 
license, the real estate may have to be marketed by another professional.

107
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
Brokers like to close. That’s true of all brokers, even reputable ones. 
Disreputable ones make big promises they can’t keep. Steer away from those 
who are fuzzy on fees or those who promise that they can get your asking 
price without doing a full valuation of your assets. Also, if your broker can’t 
explain in simple language how she would perform your valuation, move on.
People hire business brokers for most of the same reasons that they hire 
real estate brokers: They’re busy and don’t want to be bothered with all 
the details of selling a business themselves. Business brokerages generally 
work on private transactions in excess of $1 million in annual sales and 
operate mainly locally or regionally, which is what you want — brokers 
who really understand your local market. You may be able to get good 
recommendations through your attorney or accountant.
Here’s what business brokers do:
 
✓ Value your company
 
✓ Identify prospects and market your company to them, including the 
creation of brochures and other relevant marketing materials
 
✓ Help you set a price that makes sense for the market
 
✓ Negotiate the deal, prepare the paperwork, and help you close
 
Understanding how a business broker will work for you is particularly impor-
tant. Is the broker packaging your business for sale to an established group of 
leads that he has in his files, or is he attempting a sale effort to buyers who 
make particular sense for you?
How business brokers are 
trained and certified
Most business brokers are trained through industry associations such as 
the International Business Brokers Association (IBBA) and the American 
Business Brokers Association (ABBA). You may ask whether a broker has a 
related financial background or specific training in valuation or accounting. 
The IBBA also accredits business brokers with the title of Certified Business 
Intermediary (CBI).
 
You definitely want to know whether your state licenses these types of 
brokers, because not all states do.

108
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
What business brokers cost
Like most brokers, business brokers charge a percentage of the total sale 
price. Fees can run as much as 10 percent for a company selling for less than 
$10 million or a few percent on companies selling for more. You need to 
check whether the fee is based on the overall amount of the sale or whether 
other fees are charged à la carte.
Also find out whether there’s any chance that you’ll be charged if the 
business doesn’t sell after a certain period. In states with no licensing or 
limited licensing for business brokers, checking makes sense.
How to examine a broker’s work process
Like other professionals, a broker’s work process very much depends on 
the assignment. Is the broker just going to list the business on a business-
for-sale Web site? Or is she going to create a market by launching a con-
trolled auction? What if the seller is sensitive to confidentiality and wants 
to approach only a few hand-selected buyers? Many factors, such as the 
company’s size, industry, and confidentiality, determine a marketing strategy 
for selling a company. Understanding the marketing strategy the broker 
follows, or finding out whether the broker is experienced in crafting different 
marketing strategies, is a crucial factor in choosing a broker.
 
When you consider a broker, ask for a proposal that includes the specific 
services that will be provided and the marketing strategy that will be 
employed.
What to ask a prospective business broker
When you’re hiring any professional, always come armed with a list of 
questions. If you don’t like an answer you receive for any one of these 
questions, you may want to consider looking elsewhere for a broker:
 
✓ Aside from your certification, what training do you and your staff have 
in all areas of the business sale process?
 
✓ What’s your success rate in closing deals, and can you document it?
 
✓ What’s the full range of services you provide?
 
✓ May I speak to the owner of the brokerage?

109
 Chapter 7: Meeting the Supporting Players in the Valuation Process
 
✓ How will you market my business, and how will I be kept informed of 
that progress?
 
✓ How long is your typical engagement with a client? May I see the 
contract you require clients to sign?
 
✓ How do you charge for your services?
 
✓ Will you work with my attorney or tax professional?
 
✓ How will we communicate?
 
✓ What if I’m unhappy with the offers you present to me?
 
✓ May I see examples of brochures, Web sites, and other marketing 
materials that you’ve presented for clients?

Understanding Financial 
Statements
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the financials necessary to value a business
▶ Seeing how a balance sheet works
▶ Knowing what an income statement does
▶ Understanding how cash flow works and translates into value
▶ Recognizing key valuation ratios
I
n the first part of this book, we tell you that valuation isn’t all about the 
numbers. But frankly, neither you nor a valuation professional can do 
valuation without the blasted things. We’re going to make an assumption that 
you’re not experienced in accounting (and point you toward a great title to 
rectify that situation: Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition [Wiley]). But all 
we really focus on in this chapter are the basic sources of financial data 
necessary to measure the financial performance of a business and, therefore, 
the numbers necessary to do a valuation.
We talk about how important these numbers are in judging the short- and 
long-term health of a company you’re considering buying or investing in. 
The chapter’s a good primer for starting a business from scratch as well.
These reports are easy to get if you’re looking at a public company, but for 
private companies, you usually have to present yourself as an interested 
party in a possible transaction, and very likely, you’ll have to sign a 
confidentiality agreement to get access to this information in the due 
diligence process, which you find out about in detail in Chapters 12 and 16.
 
If you’re starting a business and haven’t received any training in finance, 
marketing, or any other aspects of starting a company, consult your 
community college system to see which basic courses it offers. Reading is a 
good companion to hands-on coursework, and best of all, you may be able to 
deduct the cost of the courses from your taxes!

Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Gathering the Financial Data You Need
Optimally, you need three to five years’ worth of financial statements from 
the target company to do various calculations and adjustments to test 
the company’s financial health and prospects. Here are the basic financial 
statements and records that you (or your valuation professional; refer to 
Chapter 7) need from the target company:
 
✓ Balance sheet
 
✓ Income statement
 
✓ Cash-flow statement
 
✓ Statement of retained earnings
These documents aren’t the only ones you need to craft a full valuation of the 
company, of course — we get into those documents at several points in the 
book — but they’re the foundation of any company’s valuation process.
 
If you’re considering starting or buying a business and you use an experienced 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to do your personal taxes, why not set 
up some time with her after the April 15 tax deadline to discuss basic business 
recordkeeping? This meeting is a good way to discuss which business 
structure is best for you to choose, as well as to review the basic financial 
statements and filings you’ll need to make when you’re in business. You can 
discuss setting up financial recordkeeping on your computer as well.
Looking into Support Data
We bring the point into sharper focus as the book goes on, but beyond the 
basic financials, the kind of company you’re looking at defines the kind of 
additional data you need to establish the value of the company. That’s when 
market data, transactional information, and consumer and supplier intelligence 
become important. Following is a small sampling of other data that smart 
valuation professionals gather.
External data
External databases are a great place for prospective business owners to 
research the industry they’re considering entering or buying into. This is 
where individual business owners can start developing the knowledge 
necessary to work with all the professionals in the valuation process:

113
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
 
✓ News databases: These databases may be useful to detail outside analysis 
on a target company, as well as events and developments affecting the 
fortunes of the industry in which the target company operates.
 
✓ Business databases: These databases contain critical and detailed 
information on companies and their suppliers. Even if the target company 
is a small, private competitor that isn’t listed, these resources can be 
good sources of background information on which to base decisions.
 
✓ Valuation databases: In Chapter 9, we discuss so-called rule-of-thumb 
databases that help you get a general idea of how categories of businesses 
are valued. They don’t replace professional valuation as a way to 
correctly value a company, but they’re an excellent starting point for 
understanding the factors that determine value in various kinds of 
companies.
 
 Business databases are generally expensive, so check with public and 
university libraries where you have access to see whether you can do a 
search for free.
 
✓ Trade journals: Like business and news databases, trade journals may 
provide a sweeping overview of an industry, but because these journals 
often cover their industries microscopically, they can have an advantage 
over more general databases.
Internal data
Certain internal data may or may not be disclosed prior to due diligence. 
Typically, the seller provides a summary of key financial and business data in 
its offering memo, but these numbers represent the tip of the iceberg of what 
you or your valuation professional need to dig for.
When you’re in the due diligence phase, this information needs to be available 
in full detail so that the numbers can be verified. For example, an offering 
memo may mention payroll as a percentage of sales, so you have a rough 
idea of that information going in. But you need to know that it’s surface 
information. You start asking the tough questions and crunching those 
numbers during due diligence.
Here are key examples of that data:
 
✓ Sales and customer spending data: This information helps you under-
stand the quality of customers that an organization has — how long 
they’ve been doing business, how creditworthy they are, and why they 
spend, for example. Smart valuation professionals representing buyers 
talk to customers and even competitors of a target business to gather 
this intelligence.

114
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
 The bigger the organization, the more detailed the valuation process 
is. For businesses worth less than $1 million, you’ll probably be leaning 
on rule-of-thumb estimates for value. For businesses above the $1 million 
level, get advice from your existing tax and estate expert on how detailed 
the valuation should be to keep your costs and time commitment 
reasonable.
 
✓ Any history of lawsuits or legal challenges over internal or external 
practices at a company: It’s not enough to know just that a company 
was sued and then won, lost, or settled the case; you also need to know 
why the company was sued and how it handled the suit. Legal problems 
can linger for new buyers as well.
 
✓ Payroll and employee turnover data: Payroll typically is an organiza-
tion’s number one expense, so understanding the employee base from 
the standpoint of pay, benefits, and placement is critical. Yet payroll 
goes beyond what a company pays people. Keeping great talent within 
an organization is a major valuation issue, but protecting company 
secrets when employees leave is important, too.
 
✓ Product evolution: Is a steady stream of new products, services, and 
enhancements coming out of a company over time, or does it cling 
to old successes? Research and development (R&D) is part of every 
organization; even a restaurant updates its menu and prices from time 
to time. If a company isn’t constantly working to update its offerings and 
tracking that process, you should be suspicious.
Taking a Look at Financial Statements
To determine the value of any business, you need to have access to that 
business’s financial documentation. If you’re valuing a public company, a 
company’s financials are generally accessible because the law requires it. For 
private companies, however, you need to be at a relatively serious point in a 
negotiation before a potential seller will open its books to you. But no matter 
whether you’re looking at a public or private company, you need to see the 
balance sheet, the income statement, a statement of retained earnings, and 
as much supporting documentation behind these financial results as possible.
The balance sheet
Also called the statement of financial condition, the balance sheet summarizes 
a company’s financial position at a specific time. In simplest terms, it tells 
you what a company has, what it owes, and what’s left for the owners. This is 
often expressed as a formula:
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity

115
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
Why analyze a balance sheet? It’s the doorway to the inner financial workings 
of a company. The numbers contained in this statement give important 
smoke signals of whether business is good or sliding into trouble.
The balance sheet includes assets, liabilities, and stockholder equity. 
Read on.
Assets
There are two classes of assets — current and long term. Current assets are 
those that can be converted into cash during a stated period of operations, 
known as the operating cycle. Long-term assets are those that are seen as 
usable for more than one year, and they’re depreciated annually based on 
their expected useful life.
What falls under current assets? Items that are liquid — which means they 
can be sold quickly. They include the following:
 
✓ Cash: You’ve heard it before — cash is king. Cash as stated on a balance 
sheet is money that can be accessed quickly, such as money in a cash 
box in the office or hopefully inside a bank. Cash held in long-term 
reserve to buy company shares or extinguish other debt is considered 
separate from this category because it’s earmarked for a specific pur-
pose, not a general one.
Public company annual reports: Basic training 
in financial analysis
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) requires that public companies make 
public disclosure of all the financial documents 
that we refer to in this chapter. Although private 
companies don’t have to make this disclosure, 
they have to have a system set up for sharing 
documents if a buyer comes sniffing around.
Because you’re at the start of your valuation 
education, dissecting a public company’s 
annual report is good general training in under-
standing valuation at any company. Just 
remember to ignore all the pretty pictures and 
words in the front of the annual report and turn 
to the back where all the boring numbers are. 
Look for the following:
 ✓ The 10K: This document, filed with the SEC, 
contains a detailed explanation of a busi-
ness (it’s often packaged with the annual 
report). It offers a more detailed view of 
financial statements than does an annual 
report. It allows you to see the amount of 
stock options awarded to executives at the 
company, as well as a more in-depth dis-
cussion of the nature of the business and 
marketplace.
 ✓ The 10Q: This is the quarterly version of the 
10K. If the company is planning a merger 
announcement, changing its dividend 
policy, facing a lawsuit, or worse, it may not 
issue a press release but rather slide it into 
the 10Q.

116
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
 Keep in mind that there’s no one single format for presenting consoli-
dated financial statements at any company. What you see here are gen-
eral structures, and depending on the company and industry it’s in, the 
level of detail will change.
 
✓ Marketable securities: This is money in short-term bank certificates of 
deposit or government obligations (such as bonds) that can be accessed 
within a one-year period of operations. You may not be able to get your 
hands on it today without a penalty, but you’ll definitely be able to do so 
within a few weeks or months.
 
✓ Accounts receivable: This is money that should be coming in the door 
within a short period of time. Accounts receivable are amounts billed to 
your customers for the goods and services you create. All accounts 
receivable should be labeled separately for accounting purposes (not 
every account receivable appears on the balance sheet because it’s 
mainly a summary), but a potential buyer or investor will definitely 
want to see a list and aging report of all of your accounts receivable. 
This information can tell a lot about the quality of who you’re doing 
business with.
 
✓ Inventories: These are goods (mainly physical items) that are available 
for sale, items already on the assembly line, and raw materials not yet 
part of the manufacturing/assembly process.
 
✓ Prepaid expenses: This might not sound like an asset, but it is. Prepaid 
expenses are the result of a business making payment for necessary 
goods and services to be received in the near future. This is stuff like 
prepaid rent for facilities and business insurance.
What falls under long-term assets? Obviously, assets that may need more 
than a year to liquidate fall under long-term assets. Here’s what they include:
 
✓ Investments: These go into two categories on the balance sheet — short 
term and long term. Generally, long-term investments are those that a 
company plans to keep for more than a year (the definition is actually 
true for individuals, too), and they may consist of stocks or bonds of 
other companies, real estate, and cash set aside for a specific project 
or reason. Long-term investments also include money that’s held for a 
pension fund. Short-term investments are those in non-cash accounts 
that can be liquidated within a year. These may include marketable 
securities or specific properties meant for short-term resale.
 
✓ Plant assets: These are also called fixed assets. They include plants and 
equipment as well as land, buildings, machinery, and other items intended 
to be used in business operations over a relatively long period of time. 
These are generally not assets you’d rush to convert into cash — their 
value comes from the goods and services they produce for sale in the 
business.

117
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
 
✓ Intangible assets: Our favorite. These are assets you can neither see, 
taste, or touch, and they consist mainly of valuable rights, privileges, or 
other advantages and perks. This category of assets can be the whole 
ballgame as far as the value of some companies goes, particularly tech-
nology companies that produce ideas that travel digitally (see Chapter 5 
for details).
 
 Sometimes the most valuable intangibles in a business don’t land on 
the balance sheet. We’re talking about internally developed brands, 
trademarks, and copyrights.
 
✓ Other assets: This is a bit of a catchall category. When any company 
prepares a balance sheet, it finds assets that can’t be classified easily 
under any of the categories we’ve stated. What falls into this category? 
Pay advances made to company officers, the cash surrender value of 
life insurance on officers, the cost of buildings in the process of con-
struction, and the miscellaneous funds held for special purposes.
Liabilities
Liabilities are what a company owes. Company obligations come in the 
following forms:
 
✓ Current liabilities: Current liabilities are those you’ll pay off or 
otherwise discharge within your normal operating cycle or within your 
operating year. This is likely to include amounts owed to trade creditors 
in accounts payable. Other current liabilities may include income taxes 
and payroll, as well as utility bills, payroll taxes, local property taxes, 
and other services.
 
✓ Long-term liabilities: These are generally notes, bonds, and mortgages — 
debts that usually take more than a year to pay off. Of course, if you have 
long-term debt that’s coming due within the operating year, you need to 
move it to the short-term debt column.
 
✓ Deferred revenues: Customers sometimes make advance payments for 
merchandise or services, sometimes in exchange for a discount or 
other incentive. Revenues are booked when merchandise or services are 
actually delivered.
 
✓ Provisions for legal settlements: These are reserve amounts to cover 
potential losses from court disputes that aren’t yet official.
Stockholders’ equity
Also called owners’ equity or capital, stockholders’ equity is in essence the net 
worth of the company from an accounting standpoint. It’s the third stage of 
the balance sheet.

118
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Say you started a business and your initial investment was $25,000. That 
amount is recorded in a capital account, also referred to as an owners’-equity 
account. In publicly traded companies, outstanding preferred and common 
stock also represents owners’ equity.
The income statement
The income statement helps you zero in on the quality of revenues and 
earnings in a business. Also called the profit-and-loss (P&L) statement, this 
document helps you see first the amount of revenue (also referred to as 
“sales” in some businesses) brought in by a company over a period of time as 
well as the cost of sales, operating expenses, and taxes that whittle down that 
total to what hopefully will be a positive number at the end: a company’s net 
earnings or profit.
Why footnotes are important
Good reading glasses are a necessity in under-
standing financial reports. In any set of financial 
statements, it’s critical to read the small print in 
footnotes throughout. There’s a lot of good stuff 
in there, such as
 ✓ Big changes in accounting policies and 
practices: In both private and public corpo-
rations, accountants are generally brought 
in to do the taxes and certify that the com-
pany is operating under generally accepted 
accounted principles. There are, however, 
situations in which outside accountants 
and finance executives have to issue warn-
ings and clarifications on their results, and 
you should keep an eye out for such notes. 
This may be a key smell point for trouble in 
an organization, or it may be important 
when judging trends over several account-
ing periods.
 ✓ Taxes, taxes, taxes: Footnotes can provide 
significant information about a company’s 
current and deferred income taxes on the 
local, state, federal, or international level.
 ✓ Pension data: As you may know, retirement 
obligations are considerable responsibili-
ties at most companies. Footnotes can tell 
you about the assets and costs of these 
plans and whether they’re overfunded or 
underfunded and why. Why is this a valua-
tion issue? Retirees can have a significant 
claim on a company’s assets if their plans 
aren’t backed up, and state and federal 
governments may have to get involved.
 ✓ The handling of stock options: Recent news 
reports on the handling of stock options 
within many public companies are a cau-
tionary message for companies of all sizes. 
Investors and potential buyers need to 
know what stock options have been granted 
to officers, staff, and employees and how 
those stock options will be accounted for in 
the company’s results.

119
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
Profit is also expressed in a different way. Operating profit is sometimes 
called earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), 
earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), net profit, cash flow to equity, and 
so on. Cash flow to equity is the calculation that tells investors how much 
money they’d receive if the company decided to distribute all the net 
earnings for the period. This really doesn’t happen — companies tend to 
reinvest profits back in the business — but if you watch or listen to the stock 
market report on TV or radio, you’ll hear commentators comparing current 
per-share results to year-ago results as a way of saying earnings have gone up 
or down.
The income statement explains the route to the bottom line of any company 
and what got it there — not only annual increases in revenue but smart 
money and people management that allowed the company to hang on to 
every penny of profit at the end of the day.
Stock and the private company
When a company goes public — that is, when 
it offers its stock for sale on the public 
markets — a lot of fanfare and considerable 
preparation surrounds that day. But for more 
than 90 percent of the companies operating in 
America, there’s never going to be an initial 
public offering (IPO) date because most 
companies don’t want to go public.
That said, the issuance of private stock in a 
company is a serious matter and deserves 
the right expertise going in. Simple business 
structures like sole proprietorships don’t have 
to consider this issue, but if you plan to 
incorporate, you should consult a tax expert, an 
experienced incorporation attorney, and 
possibly an estate attorney on how many shares 
you should issue and allocate to the various 
owners of the business or keep in the corporate 
treasury.
This is a unique issue for every company, and it 
should be tied to your growth plan. For instance, 
some states price their incorporation fees on 
the number of shares of stock a company 
issues, so that may drive the decision in concert 
with an owner’s desire to bring in other 
investors or possibly go public at some point.
The bottom line? Even if you’re a sole business 
owner who plans to stay in full control of your 
business for a lifetime, you may decide to do 
things differently later. You may get married and 
have kids you want to involve in the business 
someday. You may involve partners or other 
owners in growing the business. Circumstances 
always change.
So if you incorporate or create a partnership, a 
share of stock isn’t just a share of stock. It’s key 
to your planned — and sometimes your 
unplanned — possibilities for your business in 
the future. Get the full range of help you’ll need 
to make stock decisions wisely.

120
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
You need to know where the IRS is concentrating its efforts in any given year. 
Since 2001, IRS investigators have been triggering audits at companies over 
the handling of their employee pension plans and executive compensation — 
stock options and severance agreements, specifically. Always ask whether a 
target company has been audited and why.
Income statements are structured like a funnel. At the top you see the gross 
revenues of a business. As you go down, you see those numbers get smaller 
as you deduct costs and operating expenses that were needed to generate 
that big number at the top. By the end, you get to the spout and see how 
much is left — the net earnings for the period. Obviously, if nothing drips 
out, that’s a loss.
So that’s the picture. Following are the numbers you see on the way down the 
income statement.
Revenues
Revenues are the receivables of a company, generally what’s paid by 
customers in exchange for a company’s products or services. Depending on 
the business, however, it can include other gains for the period. The revenue 
segment of the income statement includes the following:
 
✓ Net revenues: Again, this depends on the structure of the company and 
its operations, but some companies accept returns on certain products 
or allowances of some sort, so those are subtracted from the gross 
revenues and expressed as net revenues.
 
✓ Cost of goods sold (COGS): This is the total expense of manufacturing, 
creating, and delivering a product. It includes the cost of raw material 
and production. Typically, these costs are variable costs (that is, they’re 
a function of sales).
 
✓ Gross profit: Gross profit is the cost of goods sold subtracted from the 
revenue. Here’s a common formula that expresses it:
 
 Gross Profit = Total Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold
 
✓ Gross margin: This is the ratio of gross profit to sales revenue. It’s 
a measure that shows how efficient a company is at turning raw 
materials into income. For a retailer, it measures their markup over their 
wholesale price. Here’s the formula:
 
 Gross Margin =  (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold) × 100  
                                                      Revenue
Expenses
The expenses section of the income statement notes several critical expense 
categories (some are semivariable costs; some are fixed costs):

121
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
 
✓ General and administrative expenses (G&A): These expenses are tied 
to the overall running of the company, not to specific product lines.
 
✓ Sales and marketing expenses: These are promotional, advertising, and 
other selling costs (for example, sales commissions) for the entire com-
pany, though some organizations break these down among divisions.
 
✓ Depreciation or amortization expense: Depreciation happens to 
virtually any hard asset in a business subject to wear and tear — 
furniture, vehicles, machinery, computers, you name it. Companies 
spread the cost of these assets over the periods in which they’re used.
 
✓ Research and development expenses: Check to see how much the 
company is investing in R&D and whether that’s paying off in building 
the business.
Earnings
In earnings, you’re finally getting close to figuring out the bottom line. Again, 
there are some intermediary steps:
 
✓ Operating income: This is the first stage of earnings you see when you 
subtract all the operating expenses from gross profit.
 
✓ Operating margin: Here’s another important ratio. This measures what 
proportion of a company’s revenue is left over after paying for variable 
costs of production such as wages, raw materials, and other related 
costs. Here’s the formula:
 
 Operating Margin =    Operating Income 
                     
Net Sales
 
✓ Income before taxes: This comes after the company deducts any 
interest paid on its outstanding debt, which is the amount of earnings on 
which the company expects to pay taxes.
Acceptable debt
Is debt bad? Boy, is this a controversial topic! 
Although a solid credit record is a good thing for 
people and businesses to have, it’s best for 
businesses to think in terms of how they can 
fund their operations from money they make 
doing what they do.
How do you know when a company has too 
much debt? Generally, if a company has solid 
cash flow and a return on investment (ROI) 
that’s significantly greater than the percentage 
it is paying on borrowed funds, it’s probably 
going to be okay.

122
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ Taxes: These are the taxes a company has paid to local, state, and 
federal officials.
 
✓ Net income from continuing operations: This is the net profit that 
comes from continuing business activities. It’s the amount earned by a 
company before any adjustment for preferred dividends, discontinued 
operations (such as divisions that have been sold or closed), and 
extraordinary items (such as unusual costs from natural disasters or 
things that rarely affect operations).
 
✓ Profit margin: This is yet another critical ratio — a measure of how 
good a company is at cost control. The higher the net profit margin 
is, the better it is at converting revenues into actual profit. Here’s the 
formula:
 
 Profit Margin =   Net Income (continuing or net) 
                  
Net Sales Revenue
Net income
Net income is the big one — the amount of profit left over after taxes and all 
expenses. If you see this amount in brackets, it’s not a profit — it’s a loss.
 
✓ Earnings per share: This is net income divided by each share of stock 
in the organization. It’s a useful measurement to compare results 
quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
 
✓ Shareholder dividends: Many companies pay dividends to shareholders 
on an annual basis. If any dividends have been paid during the reporting 
period, they’re noted on a per-share basis here.
Statement of retained earnings
A statement of retained earnings represents a company’s earnings since day 
one, minus any money deducted or distributed to the owners of the com-
pany. If retained earnings keep going up over the course of time, it indicates 
that company officers are electing to put more earned income into the 
business to support operations. The more self-generated investment, the less 
need a company has to rely on outside financing to grow the business.
 
GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) is the main framework of 
guidelines for the U.S. accounting industry. It governs how accountants and 
other finance professionals prepare financial statements.
The balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of retained 
earnings — these are the major financial road maps in any company, and 
valuation professionals use several years’ worth of those numbers not only 
to compute how the company has performed over past years but also to project 
how it may behave in future years. They make such projections by adjusting 
those numbers (see Chapters 3 and 4 for more on such adjustments).

123
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
Cash-flow statement
The third piece of financial data necessary for valuation is the cash-flow 
statement — again, it should cover a period of years. For many people, the 
words cash flow trip off the tongue, but nobody realizes the true meaning of 
the concept until he’s in business for the first time: Cash flow is both food 
and oxygen to a business. Without it, companies die.
A company’s cash-flow statement explains its relationship with the outside 
world. It shows several things:
 
✓ The flow of cash into the company through the sale of goods and 
services
 
✓ The flow of cash into the company from investment (sale of stocks 
and bonds)
 
✓ The flow of cash from the company to vendors, employees, and other 
activities representing investment in the company’s own growth
The good news that everyone’s looking for in a cash-flow statement is the 
news that the company can finance its own spending with money it makes 
from operations. An income statement can tell you whether a company made 
money, but a cash-flow statement tells you whether the company had a 
bloodstream of cash keeping it going.
The sources of information for the cash-flow statement are the balance sheet 
and the income statement.
Activities boosting valuation
Numbers reveal behavior. So what exactly is 
value-building behavior in a company? Here are 
some ideas:
 ✓ A strong management team with longevity
 ✓ Hot products with plenty more in the 
pipeline — research and development 
spending that’s paying off
 ✓ Customers in a love affair with the 
company
 ✓ A plant and equipment in top shape
 ✓ Consistent upward trends in revenues and 
earnings — no big swings or extremes
 ✓ Low employee turnover and high marks for 
its workplace
 ✓ A wide variety of customers without anyone

company’s sales or earnings

In accounting terms, cash isn’t just about the greenbacks. Cash refers to cash 
and cash equivalents, including currency, bank deposits, U.S. Treasury bills, 
money market accounts, and commercial paper. So what’s not cash? Stocks, 
bonds, and other securities.
The cash-flow statement’s bottom line shows the net increase or decrease in 
cash for the period. The statement is divided into three parts, indicating cash 
flow from three types of activities:
 
✓ Operating activities: This section is all about cash generated by the day-
to-day operations of the business — incoming revenue from the sale of 
goods or services and most kinds of outgoing payments. What it doesn’t 
include is principal paid on or received from loans.
 
 No transaction is considered to be cash flow unless cash was actually 
received or paid; amounts in accounts receivable or payable don’t 
qualify. Any cash activities appearing on the company’s income state-
ment qualify for the operating-activities section of the cash-flow 
statement. The same is true of cash activities related to accounts 
receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and movements in asset values 
that have a contra account (an account that offsets another account) on 
the income statement and on the balance sheet.
 
✓ Investing activities: Investment of cash and cash equivalents creates 
more cash for use in the business. Investing activities can include the 
purchase or sale of property and equipment, the purchase or sale of 
securities and related investments, and loans made to other businesses.
 
 Interest and depreciation are classified as operating cash flow, as are 
net gains or losses on investments.
 
✓ Financing activities: This section is all about the company’s liabilities 
and shareholder equity, noting how the company obtains its capital and 
enhances the value of its stock. A company can issue bonds, pay back 
debt, pay dividends, and issue and buy back its own stock.
 
Stock buybacks happen in both public and private companies. Stock buybacks 
are notable tactics in business valuation because they involve a company’s 
realizing that buying back stock is an advantageous strategy. This can happen 
for a number of reasons that are unique to the company itself.
Figuring your cash flow
Two methods allow people to compute cash flow: the direct and indirect 
methods. The direct method is pretty much what it sounds like. All cash-
flow information is pulled from cash receipts and payments that cover 
the following:

125
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
 
✓ Cash from customers
 
✓ Interest and dividends received by the company
 
✓ Cash paid to employees and suppliers of goods or services (including 
suppliers of insurance, advertising, and so on)
 
✓ Interest paid
 
✓ Income taxes paid
The indirect method involves pulling information from the balance sheet 
and income statements based on changes noted in both. Instead of reporting 
the total cash received from customers, an indirect statement lists only 
the change in cash received from the previous period. This method pulls 
information from the following sources:
 
✓ Net income
 
✓ Depreciation and amortization
 
✓ Deferred income taxes
 
✓ Interest income
 
✓ Change in accounts receivable
 
✓ Change in accounts payable
 
✓ Change in inventories
What a cash-flow statement looks like
Most cash-flow statements contain two sets of figures: source of funds and 
use of funds. Here are the elements that may appear under both headers:
Source of Funds
Beginning cash
Sales services income
Sale of assets
Customer deposits
Loans made to other companies
Contributed capital
Total cash in: _______________

126
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Use of Funds
Salaries
Other operating expenses
Payments for the company’s own loans
Capital expenditures
Tax payments
Total cash out: _______________
Cash management is a serious issue for all companies, particularly for young 
ones that may not be bringing in much — or any — revenue. If you don’t have 
specific training in company accounting or managing business funds, talk to a 
trusted accountant or advisor about how the following issues work:
 
✓ How the target company manages its cash
 
✓ How the company deals with cash shortfalls when customers pay late or 
in other circumstances that affect the flow of cash into the business
 
✓ What the company does with excess cash
 
✓ What kinds of accounts the company uses to hold any excess cash and 
whether it uses efficient, low-cost methods to do this. Are those funds 
allocated in properly insured accounts?
 
One of the best ways to maximize cash flow is to have effective on-time-
payment and collection strategies for customers. Companies that have the 
cash flow to do so may negotiate specific discounts and other advantages for 
paying bills early. Be aware of these practices in the companies you’re looking 
at; they’re a sign of good business practices.
Ratios and formulas for valuation
New ways of number crunching are born every day, so what you’re about to 
see are some of the most common valuation ratios used today. In the real 
world of business valuation, there are considerably more-complex ratios that 
allow people to deal with specialized situations, and as the book continues, 
you get to see a few of them. The vast majority of these ratios never see the 
inside of an annual report, but you may see them referenced in outside 
resources like stock listings and analysts’ data on particular companies.
But you should understand some of the most basic ratios used in valuation 
so you have a base of knowledge to work from. We’re sure you’ve already 
seen a few of these and probably calculated a few.

127
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
Valuation ratios tell you whether the company is inexpensive or costly on an 
absolute basis. Your job is to find companies that are bargains relative to 
their profitability, growth rates, and financial strength. Remember Graham’s 
purchase trigger: If you can find a stock with a value that’s 50 percent above 
the stock price — buy.
Note: We mention some target numbers for these various formulas, but 
we’re going to paste on a caveat: Just as valuation professionals use certain 
computations to fit the operation, target numbers for these formulas may 
vary based on the industry. And as much as it bugs us to say it, sometimes 
the appropriate answer for target numbers is “it depends.”
 
Value Line is an easy-to-understand source of valuation data on public 
companies, but it’s a good one to get familiar with. This investment research 
service is available online for a fee (www.valueline.com), but it’s also 
available in most public libraries. Again, it’s a good way to test out your 
valuation knowledge.
Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
The price-to-earnings formula is
P/E =           Share Price       
             Earnings per Share
Where to find it: P/E is a ratio included next to most individual stock listings 
online or in daily papers. Also, you can find annual P/E ratios in Value Line, 
including comparisons to other stocks within an industry. Its main source is 
in the company’s income statement.
If the P/E Ratio of a company is less than its industry average P/E, the com-
pany is selling at a discount valuation to its peers. When you hear someone 
refer to a “low P/E,” they’re referring to an investment that may be worth a 
look because it’s priced lower than other companies in its industry (also 
known as its peer group).
 
Some people think buying a stock with a 15 P/E is better than buying one with 
a 40 P/E because the latter company’s earnings are so much further below its 
stock price. Sometimes people do get too excited about a company, but others 
may find that it has the potential to support such a valuation. That’s further 
proof that the truth may not rest solely in the numbers.
Price-to-sales ratio (P/S)
Price-to-sales is a way of valuing companies that aren’t earning money or are 
so young they’re practically in the startup phase. In the technology sector, 
many acquisitions have been based on P/S because buyers want to know that 
revenues are headed up. Here’s the formula:

128
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
P/S =       Current Market Capitalization   
             Last 12 Months’ Total Revenues
Where to find it: You can find the market capitalization by multiplying the 
number of shares times the market price. The last four quarters of revenue 
are in Value Line or in the last four 10Q statements from the company.
 
Check P/S against the working capital ratios (later in this chapter) just to 
make sure that management is using the company’s assets the way they 
should. It’s a leap of faith that management will control costs and eventually 
produce earnings because the bottom line, not revenues, is what supports a 
company’s value.
Price-to-tangible-book-value ratio (PTBV)
The tangible book value, or net asset value, is a rough estimate of what a 
company would be worth if it were liquidated. Here’s its formula:
Tangible Book Value = Total Assets – Intangible Assets and Liabilities
You can use that calculation to find the price-to-tangible-book-value ratio 
(PTBV):
PTBV =            Stock Price          
                Tangible Book Value
Where to find it: Book value is listed in the consolidated balance sheet portion 
of the balance sheet, or it’s listed separately in Value Line.
If this calculation is below 1.0, then the company is selling below book value — 
technically below liquidation value. If this happens, you’ve found either the 
bargain of the century or a problem company, so take a fine-toothed comb 
to its operational history. Generally, though, a low PTBV ratio relative to 
the rest of that company’s competitors is considered a positive sign for 
investment.
 
Price-to-tangible-book-value is one of the most controversial value ratios 
because investors like to argue whether the assets posted at their original 
(or “book” value) could be sold at roughly the same value today. Check the 
industry before you use a computation like book value; traditional rust-belt 
companies with lots of machinery may have a book value that’s too high 
because its technology is obsolete.
 
You really need to understand the assets of a company before you rely 
on a traditional measurement like book value. Widen your collection of 
resources — read analysts’ reports on the company if they exist, and if they 
don’t, read voraciously about the industry.

129
 Chapter 8: Understanding Financial Statements
Debt-to-equity ratio (D/E)
Companies need to borrow on a regular basis to fund short-term needs and 
long-term expansion. Like people, companies can create a good credit rating 
that stands them in good stead when it’s time to borrow affordably for big 
events like mergers and acquisitions. But as the country has discovered with 
subprime mortgages and credit cards, debt can go very bad very quickly. 
Debt-to-equity (D/E) lets you look at a company’s borrowing behavior. Here’s 
the formula:
D/E =            Total Liabilities     
               Shareholders’ Equity
Where to find it: You can find the D/E ratio already figured in Value Line 
under your chosen company. But if you want to do it yourself, turn to the 
consolidated balance sheet in the annual report, look for the total liabilities 
and shareholders’ equity, and grab the calculator.
The standard D/E ratio for most companies is 50 percent, meaning investors 
want $1 of equity for every 50 cents of debt so they won’t lose everything in 
liquidation. Value investors like to see this number a little lower.
Companies take on debt for different reasons. The best reason is for expan-
sion that will attract higher sales and earnings to pay off that debt in a hurry. 
The worst is to keep payroll and other basic expenses covered — that’s a 
company in trouble.
 
Want another way to check a company’s relationship with debt? Check out its 
corporate bond rating in Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, the leading bond 
rating services. Provided the ratings services are doing their jobs, a good 
rating means you have nothing to worry about; a bad rating means you’re 
taking a chance putting your money in this company.
Working capital (net current asset value)
Working capital is the amount of money a company uses to cover expenses 
from daily operations, ranging from the price of raw materials to finished 
goods and sales. Here’s the formula:
Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities
Where to find it: Go to the current assets and current liabilities section of the 
consolidated balance sheets in the annual report. Current assets include 
cash, accounts receivable, and inventory.
Essentially, this measurement shows that a company’s assets can pay for its 
liabilities and is a reflection that management has things under control. It’s 
also a rough measure of liquidating value for a company should it close its 
doors today.

130
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Current ratio
Again, you want to know that management has assets generating enough 
capital to fund liabilities. Current ratio is another way to gauge that. Here’s 
the formula:
Current Ratio =     Current Assets     
              
   Current Liabilities
Where to find it: The current ratio is always in Value Line, but if you want to 
figure it out yourself, gather your information from the balance sheet.
Consensus has a desirable current ratio at 2, meaning that there’s no more 
than $1 in liabilities for every $2 of assets. A current ratio higher than 2 
means that the company is controlling its inventory well and is collecting 
revenues quickly.
Quick ratio
If revenues were to stop or severely decrease for a period of time, could this 
company continue to pay for daily operations until they start again? Use the 
quick ratio to find out. Here’s the formula:
Quick Ratio =  Current Assets – Inventory
                
Current Liabilities
Where to find it: The balance sheet and, of course, Value Line.
Consensus is that a quick ratio of 1 or higher indicates that a company could 
meet those obligations.

Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations 
for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
In This Chapter
▶ Why rules of thumb are good starting points but never endpoints
▶ What general business valuation can tell you
▶ Ten examples from Tom West’s Business Reference Guide
T
he folks at Merriam-Webster Online have it right about the expression 
rule of thumb, which they define as “a general principle regarded as 
roughly correct but not intended to be scientifically accurate.” We like that 
definition. It means a rule of thumb is intended to be helpful and educational 
but shouldn’t be the final word on a decision, particularly one that involves a 
life’s savings or the potential risk of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars’ 
worth of borrowed money.
This chapter deals with rules of thumb in business valuation and how people 
should use them. We have the privilege of introducing one of the leaders in 
researching and gathering business-valuation rules of thumb. Tom West is a 
founder, past president, and former executive director of the International 
Business Brokers Association (www.ibba.org), and for the past 18 years, 
he’s been the author of the Business Reference Guide, an annual bible on 
pricing hundreds of categories of independent businesses and name-brand 
franchises.
In this chapter, we feature rules of thumb on ten specific kinds of businesses 
from data from entries West compiled for the Business Reference Guide and 
listings he features on his subscription Web site, Business Brokerage Press 
(www.bbpinc.com).

132
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
What Rules of Thumb Do 
in Business Valuation
Rules of thumb are starting points. You have to thoroughly investigate the 
rest of the information that you need on your own and with the right help, 
but here are some key points:
 
✓ The rules provide general price guidance on categories of businesses. 
In West’s guide, the rules of thumb come in two formats that most 
valuation experts recognize.
 
✓ The rules provide buyers and sellers a ballpark figure on what average 
companies in a certain industry are worth.
The first rule of thumb for pricing a business is simply a percentage of annual 
sales. If the total sales of a business last year was $100,000, for example, and 
the multiple for the particular business was 40 percent of annual sales, the 
price based on that particular rule of thumb would be $40,000.
The second rule of thumb is a multiple of earnings. An earnings multiplier 
makes the most sense to prospective buyers because it directly addresses 
the buyer’s motive: making money by achieving a return on investment.
What kinds of earnings are involved in this calculation? In many small 
companies, this multiple is commonly used against the seller’s discretionary 
earnings (SDE), which are earnings before accounting for the following items:
 
✓ Income taxes
 
✓ Nonrecurring income and expenses
 
✓ Nonoperating income and expenses
 
✓ Depreciation of an amortization
 
✓ Interest expense or income
 
✓ Total compensation for one owner/operator after the total compensation 
of all owners is adjusted to market value
Earnings are also designated with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, 
and amortization (EBITDA). You can use EBITDA to analyze and compare 
profitability between companies and industries because it eliminates the 
effects of financing and accounting decisions. People use EBITDA in evaluating 
a company’s ability to earn a profit; it’s expressed as follows:
EBITDA = Operating Revenue – Operating Expenses plus Other Revenue

133
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is expressed as follows:
EBIT = Operating Revenue – Operating Expenses plus Nonoperating Income
West’s listings are based on a consensus among valuation professionals who 
deal with those particular kinds of companies. With the basic information 
you gather through rules of thumb, you turn into a private detective.
 
Rules of thumb are best used as baselines. Every one of West’s rules is nothing 
more than a general approximation of what you may pay for a particular kind 
of business based on general data about its category. The rules of thumb don’t 
account for critical local details (such as the value of location); the effect of 
the local or national economy on that business; or most importantly, how an 
actual business in that category is owned and managed.
Valuation is not just about crunching numbers. It’s also about asking the 
right questions — and then asking more questions. If you want to know more 
about selling a business or prospecting for one, we invite you to read Parts III 
and IV of this book closely.
2008 Rules of Thumb from the 
Business Reference Guide
The following examples are based on the listings in the online version of the 
2008 Business Reference Guide, with permission from Business Brokerage 
Press. We keep the examples short in the interest of space and For Dummies 
style, but they should give you an idea of what you see in some of the leading 
business categories to which entrepreneurs gravitate.
Full-service restaurants
Description: This industry comprises establishments that engage primarily 
in providing food services to patrons who order, are served while seated 
(via waiter/waitress service, for example), and pay after eating. These 
establishments may provide food services to patrons in combination with 
selling alcoholic beverages, providing carryout service, or presenting live 
nontheatrical entertainment.

134
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 30 to 35 percent of annual sales plus inventory
 
✓ 2 to 2.5 times sellers’ discretionary earnings (SDE) plus inventory
 
✓ 2 to 3 times earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
 
✓ 2.5 to 4 times Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and 
Amortization (EBITDA)
Pricing tips from valuation professionals:
 
✓ “There are five critical criteria for restaurants to meet. First is location: 
busy location, high traffic, booming business in the area and finally 
mid- to high-income population. Second is rent: it should not exceed 10 
percent of gross revenue. Third is conversion potential: can the restaurant 
be converted into another concept that will not compete with other 
restaurants within same particular center? Fourth is condition of 
equipment: are they National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) approved and 
in good condition? Since they are expensive, we shouldn’t overlook that. 
Fifth is asking price: the most important is percentage of gross revenue, 
which shouldn’t exceed 30 to 40 percent, that’s what experienced 
restaurant owners/buyers look for; and the gross annual revenue 
shouldn’t be less than $500,000 for a full-service restaurant, otherwise it 
should sell as an asset sale. If you have all these 5 criteria, the business 
will sell for market value.”
 
✓ “Lease terms and liquor license are important factors that can affect the 
value. If the facility is relatively new and up to current codes, it can be 
sold as an asset sale even with negative cash flow.”
 
✓ “Occupancy cost should not exceed 10 percent of annual gross sales. 
Restaurant operators tend to drag vendors out to 60–90 days. If cost of 
sales exceeds 35 percent, there is probably some skimming going on.”
 
✓ “Currently a buyers’ market: must be profitable or will sell for depreciated 
asset value only. Lease obligations are a large part of negotiations.”
 
✓ “Two times EBITDA plus value of furniture, fixtures, and equipment 
(FFE) plus Liquor License plus Inventory”
 
✓ “Be wary of comparing industry statistics against smaller mom and pops 
who do not have equal purchasing power. Fuel surcharges are pushing 
costs much higher.”
General information:
 
✓ “It is much better to buy an existing franchise rather than start one with 
no sales and high costs.”
 
✓ “Most ‘rules of thumb’ regarding valuation of restaurants don’t apply 
across the board. Each is very individual unless the restaurant is a 
franchise.”

135
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
 
✓ “Very rare to find a restaurant that is absentee owned and profitable. 
Some can do it but must gross over $1.5MM.”
 
✓ “Checking online reviews such as Yelp.com can provide insight to a 
restaurant’s operations and success that an owner may accidentally 
overlook while profiling their business.”
 
✓ “It’s all in the lease! It’s Location, Location, Location. Books must be well 
kept and make sense.”
 
✓ “In a slow economy it is important for restaurateurs to sharpen their 
prices, service, cleanliness and don’t stop advertising (just have to look 
for the best results).”
 
✓ “Don’t do it, unless you can commit to seven-day work weeks and long 
hours.”
 
✓ “When going into this business, in my opinion, you need to plan to be 
there a lot. There are two kinds of bartenders out there. The ones that 
steal from you and the ones that steal from you a lot.”
Bars
Description: This industry comprises establishments known as bars, 
taverns, nightclubs, or drinking places that engage primarily in preparing 
and serving alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption. These 
establishments may also provide limited food services.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 35 to 40 percent percent times annual sales — business only plus 
inventory
 
✓ 2 to 2.5 times SDE plus inventory
 
✓ 2 to 2.5 times EBIT
 
✓ 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA
 
✓ 4 times monthly sales plus game revenue (net) plus inventory
 
✓ 4 times monthly sales plus liquor license and inventory
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “Main variable is the fair market value of the liquor permit, as some areas 
have a high number of available permits which results in the permit having 
no, or limited, additional value, while in other areas limited number of 
available permits may cause the permit to have a substantial value. One will 
need to research type of permit and its availability and if in fact a market 
exists for the permit itself. I have seen liquor permits being sold for as high 
as $150,000, which obviously impacts the value of the business.”

136
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ “The location, lease rate, and restrictions on the conditional use permit 
or liquor license will largely impact any given operation’s value. As 
some licenses are valued at $75,000+, there is always some ‘floor’ value 
regardless of profitability.”
 
✓ “Factor in liquor license, understand what equipment is actually leased, 
make sure the restaurant is up to code and salable before investing 
time.”
 
✓ “Location, lease, and liquor license dictate the value of a bar. The concept 
is usually changed with a new buyer, and a significant investment is 
made to improve the premises.”
 
✓ “Recently in the Denver market we have seen 50 percent of sales as a 
rule of thumb; more if easily operated (fewer employees).”
 
✓ “You really need to understand if the liquor and beer costs are in line 
and how much the establishment is selling versus food.”
 
✓ “Drinking places, or bars or taverns, are always in high demand. The 
most important factors in assessing the value of the business are the 
location and the lease (how long remains), when and at what rate will 
the options be exercised, etc.”
 
✓ “Discretionary cash flow [DCF] can be very different from deal to deal. 
There is one very important DCF item that should be identified: Does the 
bar or taproom have any vending? (Examples of this are video poker, 
tobacco, jukebox, pool tables, etc.) If the answer is ‘Yes,’ then the next 
question should be, is there a vendor arrangement, or does the seller 
own the machines? A vendor arrangement means that the vendor owns 
the machines and collects a portion of the proceeds. If the seller owns 
the machines, the seller collects all of the proceeds, and can use these 
funds to reduce their cost of goods sold (COGS) and labor consider-
ably. In each case (with the seller as owner or the vendor as owner of 
machines), OFF BALANCE SHEET seller financing or vendor financing 
can be a very powerful source of funds.
 
 “There are a few little things that can alter the valuation in a bar or tap-
room. Generally, these types of establishments derive a lot of revenue 
from draft beer. (COGS for draft beer 25 percent to 30 percent, gross 
profit 70 percent to 75 percent.) If the establishment is operating on an 
antiquated draft system, glasses may not appear clean, spouts look dis-
colored . . . this could warrant a discount. Most states require that draft 
system/draft lines are cleaned weekly.
 
 “A potential buyer should ask for vendor beer invoices to determine the 
‘popular’ products of the establishment. This is important if the buyer 
has a potential age group in mind as the primary patrons. This is a for-
ward cash flow assumption that should be acknowledged. If vendor beer 
invoices are not made available, check the trash dumpster on a regular 
basis, it is an excellent source of information.

137
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
 
 “If liquor is being served, the pouring routine should be observed. 
Measured shot or free pour can materially change COGS. 750ML bottle 
yields 26 ounces, which is 14 shots at a 1.75-oz free pour, and 21 shots at 
a 1.25-oz measured shot. This difference could be the cost of 1.5 bottles. 
(Generally these establishments sell mostly beer/draft beer, but this 
scenario should be included in forward cash flow assumptions).”
 
✓ “You have to factor in the location, lease term or property sale, 
equipment, and the ease of someone taking over without having to put a 
lot of funds in.”
General information:
 
✓ “State changes in gambling legislation are making these types of businesses 
more attractive where there has been an allowance of on-premise 
gambling.”
 
✓ “Neighborhood corner locations will always be valuable.”
 
✓ “Owners must understand this is a business and the purpose is to make 
money, not be a place to ‘hang out.’”
 
✓ “You have to understand how liquor licensing works in your state.”
 
✓ “High degree of owner involvement on a day-to-day basis. Ability to 
contain costs and prevent ‘shrinkage.’ Creating a customer-friendly 
environment which provides good value. Owner usually must have 
excellent people skills, not a business for introverts.”
 
✓ “Number of licenses in town, length of lease, percent of food sales, 
percent of liquor sales, entertainment costs, if any. Watch for ratios that 
are out of industry standards.”
 
✓ “Never trust the books. Check sales tax returns, bank statements, etc. 
Also, check the price points and compare to the actual COGS. Are the 
comps legitimate on the profit-and-loss statement (P&L)? Are COGS 
high due to the owner skimming, or are they giving the house away? We 
never address a value to skimming and never represent it to buyers. 
Experienced buyers will recast the financials using their own labor 
percentage, etc.”
 
✓ “Food costs must be controlled. Lots of businesses fail due to ineffective 
food and liquor cost controls.”
Gift shops
Description: This industry comprises establishments that engage primarily 
in selling new gifts, novelty merchandise, souvenirs, greeting cards, seasonal 
and holiday decorations, and curios.

138
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 2.5 times SDE includes inventory
 
✓ 1.5 times SDE plus inventory
 
✓ 35 percent of annual sales includes inventory
 
✓ 3 to 4 times EBITDA
Inventory at cost plus FFE plus 1 to 2 times SDE
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “Inventory should be valued separately and include any costs associated 
with shipping inventory to the point of sale and preparing it for sale. 
Example: Beads are bought in bulk. They are heavy and require extra 
costs to ship and require time and cost to re-package and weigh into 
smaller sellable units.”
 
✓ “Location weighs heavily. Products are very important in relation to 
value. Is the store a card plus gift shop? Does it carry high-end American 
crafts and upscale gifts, gifts plus toys? The mix is important along with 
profit margins.”
General information:
 
✓ “Companies with multiple store locations have a much higher survival 
rate. Buyers will not pay for obsolete inventory.”
 
✓ “You need to understand which segment of this industry you are working 
with (craft type). Also, are you working with the retailer, the distributor, 
or the manufacturer?”
Medical practices
Description: This industry comprises establishments of health practitioners 
who hold an MD (Doctor of Medicine) or DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) degree 
and engage primarily in the independent practice of general or specialized 
medicine (except psychiatry or psychoanalysis) or surgery. These practitioners 
operate private or group practices in their own offices (such as centers or 
clinics) or in facilities such as hospitals or health maintenance organization 
(HMO) medical centers.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 40 to 45 percent of annual gross sales plus inventory
 
✓ .05 to 1.5 times SDE includes inventory

139
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
 
✓ 2 to 3 times EBITDA
 
✓ 1.5 times EBIT
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “Very wide range of values depending on numerous characteristics. 
Primary care practices tend to sell for higher multiples (35 percent to 
50 percent) than specialty practices. Need to be especially cognizant of 
current compensation range for medical specialty in question. Some 
specialties may think a cash flow of $200,000 is good, other specialties 
won’t consider practice with cash flow less than $400,000. Payer mix/
contracts is important. Revenue deriving from inpatient work (i.e., 
hospital work) may not count toward value as the hospital and not the 
selling doctor controls that revenue stream. Some specialties very 
susceptible to changes in technology. Stark Laws and Anti-Kickback 
Statutes can impact sales price/terms. The more specialized the doctor — 
or the more the practice relies on personal reputation of doctor — the 
harder to sell and lower value.”
 
✓ “The transferability of the value from the seller to the buyer is essential! 
Excellent clinical technology, management systems and managers, and 
effective relationships add value. A successful transition is critical to 
transferring value from the seller to the buyer.”
 
✓ “Entirely dependent on facts and circumstances of SUBJECT PRACTICE, 
e.g., specialty, percent ancillary services and technical component 
revenues, payer mix, etc.”
 
✓ “1 to 1.35 times SDE plus inventory and accounts receivable are not 
included.”
 
✓ “[. . .] SDE, EBIT and EBITDA multiples really no longer apply. The best 
current formula is 2.5–4 times (SDE minus compensation for owner 
labor). The 2.5 multiplier is for insurance-based practices, and the 4 
multiplier is for the best of cash practices. Insurance reimbursement 
trends are downwards, hurting values significantly. The reason AGS, SDE 
and EBITDA don’t apply is the owner might be active or passive. It is 
illogical to think that a practice with $1,000,000 AGS has the same value 
to ownership if the owner works there 50 hours per week or is an absen-
tee owner; which is why you have to subtract the market-rate comp 
for owner labor prior to applying the multiplier. Many specialties have 
merely liquidation value or close to it because of shortages, the ease of 
opening a competing practice, and hospital income and overhead guar-
antees via forgivable loans in lieu of practice purchase. Value issues are 
very, very localized. Rule of thumb: the sale should pay for itself to the 
buyer within 5 years with profits above comp for labor.”

✓ “EBITDA is most important; percent of Annual Gross Sales is generally 
irrelevant since profitability varies so widely. Rural practices are getting 
almost impossible to sell because of physician shortages. Watch out 
for big insurance reimbursement changes in 2008–12 due to Medicare 
changes and PPOs [preferred provider organizations] following their 
pricing. 501-C3 ‘not-for-profit’ buyers will require formal appraisals. 
Maybe have to adjust value for lack of electronic health care record if 
it is needed locally within 1–2 years; $25,000–$40,000 per doc, reduces 
profits.”
General information:
 
✓ “Pricing of professional practices is less amenable to ‘rules of thumb’ 
because of wide disparities in reimbursement, costs, physician man-
power availability, and challenges of transferring the intangible elements 
of value to a successor owner, etc.”
 
✓ “Billing turnaround is very important.”
 
✓ “Be very careful about state licensure, state laws, and federal Stark, 
Medicare and Medicaid laws. Many docs don’t know when they are in 
violation of laws that don’t make sense. Use a specialist attorney on 
every deal to minimize errors and omissions (E&O). Many illegal 
medispas popping up now and trying to bail out via sales.”
 
✓ “Labor includes physicians and support staff. This is a labor-intensive 
service business.”
 
✓ “Heavy Medicare/Medicaid practices very susceptible to federal 
government payment structure from year to year. Depending on 
specialty and year reimbursement may be up/down considerably. 
Technology can also have significant impact on future practice 
earnings. Brokers should have familiarity with Stark and Anti-Kickback 
Statutes. Brokers should make sure that buyer/seller attorneys have 
medical practice transaction experience and knowledge of Stark and AKS.”
Auto repair shops
Description: This industry comprises establishments that engage primarily 
in providing a wide range of mechanical/electrical repair and maintenance 
services for vehicles such as passenger cars, trucks, vans, and trailers; or 
engine repair and replacement.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 25 percent to 30 percent of annual sales plus inventory
 
✓ 2 times SDE plus inventory

141
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
 
✓ 1.5 to 2 times EBIT
 
✓ 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “Most service centers need minimum eight bays to show higher revenues 
and strong cash flow.”
 
✓ “Many auto centers with sales revenues under $500,000 per year have 
closed their doors due to little or no profit. Consumers are driving less 
due to the high price of gas and this directly affects sales revenues. 
Rents continue to escalate and it becomes increasingly more difficult to 
find good managers or top-line techs. Major auto dealerships are also 
becoming more aggressive in their service departments and have taken 
some of the sales revenues away from the independent auto centers. 
Conversely the auto centers with sales exceeding $1 million per year 
continue to show good profits and will benefit from the smaller auto 
centers who close their doors. The above multiples do not include 
inventory, at cost; the multiples do include equipment, FFE.”
 
✓ “Rent can be added to the SDE if the seller also owns the building and 
is selling the building with the business. If the seller hires too many 
employees, it is sometimes possible to show the buyer why the business 
can be run with fewer employees, and add the soon-to-be-terminated 
employee’s salary to the SDE.”
 
✓ “Sometimes I will use 2.5 times SDE. This depends on if the business is 
located on a prime corner, how much equipment the business has, and 
how new the equipment is. A shop that has a very low SDE, or possibly 
is losing money, is able to sell for between $100K to $135K just for its 
location, build out, and equipment.”
 
✓ “Smaller auto centers can be the most difficult to sell due to the very 
personal nature of the business. It is very helpful if the owner stays for 
1 to 2 months to ease the buyer into the business especially creating a 
comfort level with the customers.”
General information:
 
✓ “Good technicians are always hard to come by, but with a busy and nice 
looking shop it makes it easier to attract them.”
 
✓ “Most auto repair shop owners focus too much on offering the lowest 
prices rather than providing excellent customer service. If you provide 
excellent customer service, customers are willing to pay for it. Most 
people think the number of bays is important. The number of parking 
spaces is a lot more important than the number of bays.”

142
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ “Eighty-eight percent of my automotive purchasers are buyers with no 
prior experience. The multiple on this type of business has dropped 
from previous years. Why? Lack of skilled technicians, overabundance 
of service centers, low unemployment. Most buyers in today’s market 
are not looking for a business that falls under the heading of a low-
paying job. Rule of thumb is applicable for Franchise or Non-Franchise 
Centers.”
 
✓ “Demand for this service business has gradually decreased over the 
last four years. The smaller (Mom and Pop operations of $35,000 gross/
month or less) are becoming non-existent in many larger cities.”
 
✓ “Factors to look for: the gross profit of the business pre-wages, equipment 
leased vs. free and clear, management and certification of techs, 
percentage of wages, the length of lease and terms. The business 
should do a minimum of $30K per month in sales revenue (excluding 
smog Certs). Any special licenses required? Does the owner work as a 
mechanic? Things to add to value: volume exceeds $50K per month, the 
owner works only in administrative capacity, number of bays (minimum 
6 bays), all equipment is free and clear, all mechanics have at least two 
years’ experience, rent is eight percent of sales or less, strong manager 
in place, gross profit exceeds 60 percent. Things to subtract from value: 
owner is active as mechanic, monthly sales under $25K per month, 
appearance, location, most equipment on lease, the age of the equipment, 
lack of professional management, inexperience of mechanics, unable to 
expand in capacity or sales, rent high, short term lease.”
Day-care centers for children
Description: This industry comprises establishments that engage primarily 
in providing day care for infants or children. These establishments generally 
care for preschool children but may care for older children when they’re not 
in school and may also offer prekindergarten educational programs.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 40 to 45 percent of annual sales includes inventory
 
✓ 3 times SDE includes inventory
 
✓ 2.5 to 3 times EBIT
 
✓ 3 to 4 times EBITDA
 
✓ 2 times SDE includes inventory (most child-care centers are acquired 
with the real estate; the 2 multiple of SDE is after the debt service 
required to buy the real estate)

143
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “State laws, regulations and market rate have large impact on price.”
 
✓ “Site location is critical; curb cuts and ease of access in/out of center 
is very important; proper side of road for traffic flow during rush hour; 
tenure of center, tenure of teachers and their level of secondary 
education; strong director/mgr very important; quality centers with 
consistent earnings achieve price points in the higher end of the price 
range than other centers.”
 
✓ “Based on gross sale, is 2 to 3 times sales. Based on license capacity, it 
runs $10,000 to $14,000 per child.”
 
✓ “Size matters. Licensed capacity less than 75 expect a 2.5 to 3 times 
EBITDA, over 100 expect a 4 +/– EBITDA multiple.”
 
✓ “The larger the business, the higher the multiple of earnings. A 4 times 
multiple is the maximum for a large center (licensed for 100+). Smaller 
businesses, depending upon how well they are maintained, can achieve 
2.5 times sellers discretionary cash flow (SDCF).”
 
✓ “Price is a direct effect of cash flow. The amount the business provides 
the seller needs to cover debit service and provide a return to the 
buyer. Banks look for a debit service ratio of 1.25 to 1.50. Price is also 
determined by the number of students and the income they provide to 
the school. For example, childcare centers sell from $10,000 per child 
(license cap) to as low as $6,000 per child. Price is also sometimes 2 
times gross income.”
 
✓ “Much of the value of a childcare center is based upon number of children 
enrolled, gross revenues, net operating income, and what percent of 
revenues are subsidized by the state.”
 
✓ “Multiples of EBITDA vary depending upon the size of the operation and 
depth of management. The larger the operation, the higher the multiple. 
Smaller operations will sell for over 2 times EBITDA, while larger opera-
tions with competent management will sell for in the 3 to 4 times EBITDA 
range. Reconstructed EBITDA should include adjustments to fair market 
value (FMV) for arm’s length transactions (salaries, rent, etc.).”
General information:
 
✓ “State and government programs can positively impact earnings but are 
not guaranteed long term; high staff turnover is a common trait; ones 
which have lower turnover rates are favored by buyers; high-quality 
centers with consistent earnings and good visibility and access demand 
highest price points.”

144
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ “First, the childcare industry is strong and important to the employment 
picture in areas where it is provided. In the adult-education business, 
it is important to have a trained work force.”
 
✓ “There is need for both ‘mom and pop’ operations as well as larger ‘insti-
tutional’ type businesses. Each can serve their own niche and be literally 
right next door to one another. A good, clean, quality service provider 
can be profitable in almost any competitive environment.”
 
✓ “Striking the right balance between quality and profit is critical to long-
term success. Many parents will place cost as a secondary consideration 
to quality and reputation.”
 
✓ “Check out licensing authority for complaints against the business. 
Understand frequency of rate increases. (Rate increases should be 
annual if only a couple of dollars.) Look at staff longevity to understand 
the caring nature of the business, which is critical to the reputation of 
the business.”
 
✓ “Check to see if state-subsidized.”
 
✓ “People look for unique program structure and location which they 
deem desirable (which vary by buyer). As birth rates stabilize and 
decline, program will be what keeps the progressive centers open and 
thriving in the future.”
Dry cleaning
Description: This industry comprises establishments that engage primarily 
in one or more of the following activities:
 
✓ Providing dry cleaning services (except coin operated)
 
✓ Providing laundering services (except linen and uniform supply or coin 
operated)
 
✓ Providing drop-off and pickup sites for laundries and/or dry cleaners
 
✓ Providing specialty cleaning services for specific types of garments and 
other textile items (except carpets and upholstery), such as fur, leather, 
or suede garments; wedding gowns; hats; draperies; and pillows
These establishments may provide all, a combination of, or none of the clean-
ing services on the premises.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 70 to 80 percent of sales plus inventory (plants with on-site laundry 
equipment get a higher multiple; plants with over-the-counter sales of 
$35,000 get a higher multiple)
 
✓ 2.5 to 3 times SDE plus inventory

145
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
 
✓ 2 to 3 times EBIT
 
✓ 2.5 to 3 times EBITDA
 
✓ 2 times SDE for a poor unit, 2.5 times SDE for a so-so business, 3 times 
SDE for a good store, 3.5 times SDE for a hot unit with a good lease and 
equipment, and 4 times SDE for a real winner
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “70 percent of annual gross sales if equipment is under 5 years old. If 
equipment is between 6 and 10 years old, it will be 60 percent of annual 
gross sales. If equipment is over 11 years old, it will be between 40 per-
cent and 50 percent of the annual gross sales.”
 
✓ “Purchase price ranges from 70 percent of annual sales to 100 percent. 
Single stores with full garment pricing (no discounts, no coupons) and 
having monthly retail sales over $35,000 will achieve the higher multiple. 
Retail pick-up stores (no equipment) 25 percent to 50 percent of annual 
sales.”
 
✓ “One can get 3 times cash flow (SDE) if the owner is a manager and does 
not perform a specific job such as counter, dry cleaner, or presser. If 
the owner does perform a specific job, such as dry cleaner, etc., the 
cash flow should include the owner’s salary and the business would be 
valued at 2.5 times that cash flow.”
 
✓ “Dollar for dollar (100 percent of sales) on a plant that has dry clean-
ing equipment and a single buck or double buck shirt unit, assuming all 
sales are over-the-counter, not from pick-up stores or hotels or other 
cleaners. 75 percent of sales for plant w/o shirt unit, and 50 percent of 
sales on pick-up stores, assuming sales are $125,000 or more.”
 
✓ “75 to 100 percent of annual gross sales for complete retail plants, must 
be able to verify. Pick-ups (drop stores) go for 30 to 50 percent of annual 
gross sales. Routes vary greatly, but can sell for 25 to 50 percent of 
actual paid gross sales.”
General information:
 
✓ “Stores that have no discount cleaners in the area are the way to go.”
 
✓ “Dry cleaning analysts say Zoots faced an uphill battle from the start, 
trying to turn a mom-and-pop industry with razor-thin profit margins on 
its head.
 
 “‘Over the years, attempts to build large dry cleaning chains with 
company-run stores like Zoots have largely failed,’ said Bill Fisher, 
chief executive of the Dry Cleaning and Laundry Institute, a trade 
group. Unlike fast-food chains that standardize all the food and cook-
ing techniques, dry cleaners deal with thousands of different garments 
with unique issues on a daily basis.” Source: “High Concept Cleaner in 
Tatters” by Jenn Abelson, The Boston Globe, May 13, 2008.

✓ “With approximately 30,000 dry cleaners in the United States, dry clean-
ing is one of the largest industry sectors that is still recognized as a 
‘mom-and-pop’ small business. Although the size of dry cleaners varies, 
most commercial dry cleaners are single-facility, family-owned opera-
tions. An average number of five employees work at a plant. Commercial 
dry cleaning is not a high-profit business, with the median annual rev-
enues below $250,000.” Source: International Fabricare Institute (IFI), 
September 2007.
Coin laundries
Description: This industry comprises establishments that engage primarily 
in operating facilities with coin-operated or similar self-service laundry and 
dry cleaning equipment for customer use on the premises, and establish-
ments that engage primarily in supplying and servicing coin-operated or 
similar self-service laundry and dry cleaning equipment for customer use in 
places of business operated by others, such as apartments and dormitories.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 3 to 5 times SDE plus inventory (higher multiple for newer equipment 
and long lease)
 
✓ 100 percent of annual sales plus inventory
 
✓ 1 to 1.5 times annual sales plus inventory
 
✓ 5 times EBIT
 
✓ 3 times EBITDA
“Generally 2.5 to 5.0 times annual SDE; depends on various parts of the 
U.S. — California, for example, sells between 4 to 5 times SDE, whereas in 
Nebraska it’s 1.5 to 2.5 times SDE.”
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “Coin laundry business is predictable. It does not jump up and down or 
respond to marketing as quickly as, say, a restaurant would. Having said 
that, the flat trend, old but functional equipment and slightly run-down 
interiors, get about 5 times the SDE; the newer equipment, crisp and 
clean interior with slight uptick in historical volume trend, tends to get 
high multiples. The annual sales number around $180,000 seems to be 
almost magical. Over that amount of annual sales, demand is huge, since 
they can be flowing around $100,000+ in profits.”

147
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
 
✓ “Location and demographics. It’s important to study the surrounding 
area for city planned changes or housing changes that may affect busi-
ness performance.”
 
✓ “Larger multiplier number used for newer equipment and long-term 
lease.”
 
✓ “Depending upon the market or location of the Laundromat, pricing can 
actually range between 1 and 1.5 times gross annual sales.”
 
✓ “Age of equipment a huge factor in price determining. Fold and wash ser-
vice available?”
 
✓ “They typically sell for 100 percent to 125 percent of the annual sales. 
Location, age of machines, total appearance very important.”
 
✓ “Typically laundries sell for between 55 and 65 times monthly net.”
 
✓ “Net Income should = 
1⁄3 of Gross Income. Sales price is 5+ × Net.”
 
✓ “Coin-operated laundries typically based on a 20 percent return on 
capital.”
 
✓ “Try and achieve a 25 percent return on capital; not including owner’s 
salary.”
 
✓ “Utility costs are the single largest operating expense in a coin laundry.” 
Source: Coin Laundry Association.
 
✓ “Higher multiplier for businesses with newer equipment (3–4 years) and 
long-term lease (10+ years) increase business value.”
 
✓ “Here are the steps used to calculate how many times the washers 
would have to be used to use all the water reflected in the water bill: (1) 
Get the water bills for the last year, (2) Since water bills are usually in 
cu. ft., you will have to figure out how many gallons of water were used 
(there are approximately 7.5 gallons per cu. ft.), (3) Find out how many 
gallons of water the particular washer type uses, (4) Calculate how many 
times the washers have to be used to use all the water based on the bill. 
That should give you the number of washes. Multiply that by the cost 
per wash. The national average for ‘turns’ is 5 — the number of times 
the washer is used. Dryer income is generally half that used of washer 
income, and vending income can produce 10 percent of total.”
 
✓ “Historically, laundries have been priced to sell at some multiple of 
their annual gross. Primarily because of tradition, this multiple varies 
from one section of the country to another, but normally it’s within the 
90 percent to 150 percent range. [. . .] Variations on the annual gross 
formula include such rules of thumb as 12 to 18 times monthly gross, or 
three to five times annual net income (before taxes).”

148
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
General information:
“Location is very important. Good locations are in densely populated areas 
with high percentage renters and low-to-mid income.”
“Rising utility costs are an issue. I would recommend an analysis of the cost 
per wash and dry load, to ensure a reasonable profit per turn.”
“Population demographics within 1-mile radius should show high percentage 
renters (50+ percent), low-to-mid income, limited competition, larger family 
size.”
“If it is too good to be true, run!”
“Listed below are many of the different points that will require additional 
cash before you get in the door.”
 
✓ “A rent deposit, which may include up to three months’ worth in some 
cases.”
 
✓ “Utility deposits — in many cases, if you have never owned a business, 
they can be as much as $3,000.”
 
✓ “Quarters for coin changer, which typically run somewhere between 
$1,000 to $3,000.”
 
✓ “Soaps and supplies. If you’re selling over-the-counter goods, you’ll need 
an additional $2,000 or so.”
 
✓ “You should have some cash set aside for marketing, and, coming out of 
the box, it will be about $2,000 and up.”
 
✓ “Most laundries don’t have security cameras, and I highly recommend 
you get them. That will range somewhere between $2,000 to $6,000.”
 
✓ “Legal fees, which typically run $2,000 to $5,000, depending on how 
complicated things get, and I have never seen a deal go through without 
some spiders.”
 
✓ “There will be some closing costs and/or bank fees, which will vary on 
each deal.”
 
✓ “Miscellaneous expenses, which can include mops, buckets, cleaning 
supplies, paint to spruce up the place, new TVs, uniforms, and more. 
This normally falls into the $3,000 to $5,000 range.”

Bookstores
Description: This U.S. industry comprises establishments that engage pri-
marily in selling new books.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 15 percent of annual sales plus inventory
 
✓ 1.6 SDE plus inventory
General information:
“Two surveys released over the past several weeks put the share of the con-
sumer book market controlled by online retailers at between 21 percent (R.R. 
Bowker) and 30 percent (Fairfield Research), growth that has been fueled, 
in large part, by the expansion of Amazon.” Source: “As Amazon Soars, 
Bookstores Creep” by Jim Millot, Publishers Weekly, April 2008.
“Average profit margin is 4 percent.”
Bed-and-breakfasts
Description: This U.S. industry comprises establishments that engage pri-
marily in providing short-term lodging in facilities known as bed-and-break-
fast inns. These establishments provide short-term lodging in private homes 
or small buildings converted for this purpose. Bed-and-breakfast inns are 
characterized by a highly personalized service and inclusion of a full break-
fast in the room rate.
Rules of thumb:
 
✓ 550 percent of annual sales includes inventory and real estate.
 
✓ 4.2 times gross room sales for small B&Bs (fewer than eight rooms), 4.5 
for dinner-service inns (for businesses as opposed to real-estate-driven 
small properties).
 
✓ 8 times SDE includes inventory and real estate.
Pricing tips:
 
✓ “$50,000 to $100,000 per guest room. In the Midwest, the year-round 
larger inns are selling from $80,000 to $100,000 per guestroom. 3 times 
net operating income plus $20,000 to $40,000 for the aesthetics and tax 
benefits plus value of real estate and furnishings.”

150
Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
 
✓ “The larger inns are selling for 8 (w/o seller financing) to 10 times (w/ 
seller financing) adjusted net operating income. The base real estate 
value of the smaller B&B contributes to a large part of the value. In 
small, supplemental income B&Bs, their value is typically $25,000 to 
$50,000 more than the base real estate value as a house or other real 
estate use. There are probably more supplemental income B&Bs than 
cash flow inns of the 20,000+ U.S. B&Bs. Gross Rent Multiplier is in the 5 
to 6 range.”
General information:
“Innkeeping attracts educated, sophisticated and prosperous folks for whom 
many are seeking a bridge between career and retirement. While buying a 
B&B is a lot like buying a house, there are some differences. If you’re more 
than 6 mos. from making your move, you should be reading the B&B books 
and magazines, attending a B&B seminar, visiting B&B’s as a guest, vacation-
ing in your area of interest, and volunteering your time at a local B&B to 
experience the ‘feel’ of innkeeping. Once you’re within 6 mos. of moving, you 
should put your house up for sale and begin looking at B&B’s for sale. If you 
slightly overlist your house, the worst that can happen to you is that some-
one may pay you more than you thought it was worth and you may move 
twice. We’ve had a number of B&B dreams crushed when the buyers couldn’t 
sell their house during the time they needed to. Why let the past control your 
future?! If you’re thinking about relocating to an unfamiliar area, you should 
consider renting in that area for a year so that you experience a full cycle of 
your dream spot — not just a 1 week vacation.”
“An IRS Audit Technique Guide (Market Segment Specialization Program — 
MSSAP) is available for this type of business. It is an excellent source of infor-
mation and is available at bookstore.gpo.gov (search under IRS-IRS Audit 
Technique Guides).”
“Breakdown of B&B’s: The following definitions attempt to codify what is 
presently being used in the field. They are only approximations and will vary 
by region or individual innkeeper.”
 
✓ “Bed and Breakfast Inn (B&B): Both a home for its owners and a lodg-
ing establishment usually operated at a higher level of professionalism 
than a home-stay. Some B&Bs have the word ‘inn’ as part of their name. 
A professional B&B meets all the appropriate tax, fire, building, zoning, 
and health requirements. Many B&Bs have been inspected by a state 
association or an inspection rating service such as AAA or the Mobil 
guides. The owners advertise and may legally post a sign. Breakfast 

151
 Chapter 9: Using Rule-of-Thumb Valuations for Mom-and-Pop Businesses
is served to overnight guests and may be quite lavish. Many smaller 
B&Bs provide a part-time or seasonal occupation for their owners, who 
do most of the work, often with some help for housekeeping and other 
chores. Most larger B&Bs (eight rooms or more) require the full-time 
year-round attention of one or more owners. There is always a high 
degree of personal service to guests. Reservations may be made directly 
with the property or through a service. The inn may host events such 
as weddings or family reunions. Increasing numbers of inns also cater to 
the business traveler and have facilities to host small business meetings.”
 
✓ “Country Inn: This kind of lodging property has all the characteristics 
of a B&B inn, but serves an evening meal in addition to breakfast. Some 
country inns serve dinner to overnight guests only, and the cost of 
dinner and breakfast is generally included in the room rate (called the 
Modified American Plan). A country inn with a ‘full-service restaurant’ 
serves meals to the general public. Generally, the owner or owners are 
actively involved in daily operations of the inn, and often live on site. 
To be a country inn, a property does not have to be located in a rural 
area, though historically, restaurants were added so travelers in remote 
locations could enjoy a good evening meal. Most country inns have 10 or 
more rooms.”
 
✓ “Bed and Breakfast Hotel: These are properties in which the historic 
structure, unique decorating components, guest amenities, and break-
fast offering provide the atmosphere of a B&B. Many of these properties 
formerly were standard hotels, apartment buildings, or other commer-
cial structures in urban or rural areas; some have been built specifically 
as bed and breakfast hotels. Most of these B&B hotels have fewer than 
40 rooms.
“No matter the type of property, innkeepers seek to provide the following to 
B&B travelers:

Part II: Getting Familiar with Valuation Tools, Principles, and Resources 
Finding additional information
The Business Reference Guide isn’t the only 
game in town, but it’s the most basic guide 
for showing prospective small-business 
owners the ropes of valuation. Among other 
popular paid transaction databases are Pratt’s 
Stats, BIZCOMPS, and Mergerstat (www.bv
marketdata.com). The first two look at 
smaller transactions among privately held com-
panies; Mergerstat tends to look at transaction 
data in public companies.
When you’re looking for information on compa-
nies and business communities, you can’t stop 
at databases. Here are other resources you 
should put on your reading list:
 ✓ Trade journals: Trade journals and publi-
cations follow the fortunes of the particular 
industry in which you either own a company 
or are thinking about buying one. If you’ve 
operated a company for years, maybe you 
already do a pretty good job of keeping up 
with industry news, but if you’re looking to 
sell, it’s best to do a lot of reading to keep 
on top of recent news on the state of the 
business and on the selling prices that 
comparable businesses are attracting.
 ✓ Local business publications: See whether 
you can look up your target company in the 
local press, online, or in print. If you can’t 
find it, see what stories exist in the local 
industry or neighborhood where you hope 
to operate a business. The same applies to 
stories about how local lenders are behav-
ing (are they lending money or not?). Finally, 
it’s always a good idea to look at local and 
national stories on the economy to see how 
your potential customers are spending — 
or not.
 ✓ Business books and Web sites: If you’re 
a first-time business owner, you need to 
become a student of the business opera-
tions process. Wiley publishes two par-
ticularly good books on the subject: Small 
Business For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by 
Eric Tyson, MBA, and Jim Schell; and 
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition, by 
John A. Tracy, CPA (Wiley). Also, for a 
great general overview of the business 
process, check out the “Small Business 
Planner” page of the U.S. Small Business 
Administration’s Web site (www.sba.
gov/smallbusinessplanner).

V
aluation is all about perspective. Which side of the 
deal you’re on influences how you view the valuation 
of a company: yours or someone else’s. In this part, we 
talk about your company. We focus on the sell side of a 
transaction, and our main advice can be summed up in 
one word: planning.
Think about it. Sellers don’t want to be rushed into a 
transaction if they can help it. Even if sudden opportunities 
arise to sell — opportunities that are always welcome — 
the idea is always to be prepared, because preparation 
means you’re likely to get an optimal price.
We also talk about how valuation research should be part 
of the seller’s overall estate and succession planning for 
the firm, starting years (sometimes decades) before the 
sale of the company.

▶ Choosing the type of transaction
T
iming is everything when it comes to a purchase or a sale of a company. 
This fact is especially true for sellers. The best possibilities for a higher 
valuation on the sale of a company come from planning in advance.
In reality, relatively few people have an exit plan in place for a company that 
they’ve either bought or worked hard to start years before. But exit planning 
is essential. You should do this planning three to five years in advance, and 
valuation is an important step in that process. Unless you know the value of 
your company inside and out — or the steps it will take to improve that 
value — you’ll have a tough job making a convincing sale.
Preparation is the stuff of business opportunity. It means finding out every-
thing possible about a business’s operations and the specific markets you’re 
interested in so you can grab opportunities when they happen. It means 
laying in the financial foundation — cash savings, liquid investments, or 
attractive financing — to afford those opportunities at the moment they 
happen.
Finally, it means conferring with particular experts who are familiar with your 
business plans, your finances, and your personal financial goals to make sure 
the opportunities you go after are absolutely the best fit for you. This chapter 
gives you the information you need to move in that direction.

Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Understanding Why Timing Is Important
Anita Roddick, the late founder of the cosmetics chain The Body Shop, 
viewed business opportunity this way: “I am aware that success is more than 
a good idea. It is timing, too.”
Timing doesn’t come only from luck or smarts, although they’re both 
factors. Timing derives from an intimate knowledge of how a business works 
and of how to harness its repetitive patterns for the best effect.
Furthermore, you must look at the overall economy and the economy of the 
specific industry you’re considering. You have to look at the quality of 
competing products in the marketplace. Then you must decide whether your 
particular place in the business cycle is best for staying in or selling.
 
Most owners wait too long to sell. Why? Poor planning and emotion, mostly. 
People without a game plan can’t take advantage of opportunities when they 
happen because they’re not emotionally ready to do so — and perhaps their 
families aren’t ready, either.
Examining the Motivations behind a 
Potential Business Sale
Even in tough economic times, people believe that the sale of a successful 
business is a surefire ticket to retirement wealth or possibly a stake for a new 
venture. But particularly in the case of small businesses, owners sometimes 
forget that their businesses must overcome obstacles that many larger firms 
don’t have on the way to a sale:
 
✓ A small business may be enormously profitable and very successful, but 
the owners have never bothered to create a financial reporting structure 
that woos potential buyers.
 
✓ Because private companies aren’t required to make financials public as 
a public company does, benchmarking the values of a private company 
is tough without the aid of a database or a valuation professional.
 
✓ Potential sellers often don’t consider due diligence on the attractiveness 
of their business in the current market before they try to sell.
 
✓ Emotional factors enter the picture. Founders may be reluctant to sell, 
and kids may have their own issues with the business that delay prudent 
actions at the right time.

157
 Chapter 10: Making Sure You’re Ready to Sell
 
The Alliance of Merger and Acquisition Advisors reported in 2008 that many 
business advisors believe that although seven out of ten mid-sized businesses 
will transfer ownership in the next decade, at least 90 percent aren’t prepared 
to do so. Why? They haven’t kept up with the recordkeeping and documenta-
tion that qualified buyers want, nor have they made their businesses particu-
larly salable.
Understanding buyers and what they want
You can’t really develop a negotiating strategy 
for your business unless you really understand 
what kinds of buyers may be circling your 
company and for what reasons. Here are three 
primary kinds of buyers:
 ✓ Financial buyers: These buyers act a bit 
like investors in the stock market. They 
want to come in and spot value, and they’ll 
spruce you up a little and sell. They like to 
see profitability and stability — or signs 
that profitability and stability are right 
around the corner. They’re not looking to 
buy your company to merge it with another 
similar operation in your industry. They’re 
not operators per se. They may even work 
out a deal to keep you in charge if they like 
what you’re doing.
 ✓ Strategic buyers: These folks are already 
in your business or want a business like 
yours to complement what they already 
have. They’re the buy-and-hold types. A 
strategic buyer can be a conglomerate or 
a big company already in your field that 
wants your company as a way to enter a 
new market or to add your products to a mix 
that’s already doing well for them. But the 
purchase isn’t just about products; it can 
be about people too. Management — 
particularly newer management that looks 
like it’s on the verge of a turnaround — can 
be an additional attraction for a strategic
buyer. Perhaps you have talent good enough 
to run their entire company someday!
 ✓ Special-purpose buyers: These buyers 
are typically private citizens doing private 
deals. A special-purpose buyer may be a 
father or mother who purchases a business 
for a son or daughter, or it may be a serial 
entrepreneur who has just sold a business 
and is looking for a new challenge.
Obviously, you want to see someone who knows 
your company well. You want to hear surprising 
insights from buyers, not questions that reflect 
ignorance about what you’ve done during your 
entire career.
Good buyers have more than the financial 
might to do a deal — though sellers do need to 
verify that ability. Good buyers also understand
the emotional complexities involved in such 
a transaction. They should understand how 
an owner feels about leaving the helm of a 
business she has built, how she’d have her 
employees treated after she’s gone, and what 
numbers would make the most sense to her.
Solid buyers are professional, knowledgeable, 
and empathetic to the issues of their target.

158
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Most experts suggest that small to mid-sized companies create a three- to 
five-year game plan before a sale or other major ownership transition (which 
we detail later). For now, this section looks at the primary reasons owners 
consider a sale.
Anticipating the owner’s retirement
For business owners, retirement is either a welcome event or something they 
don’t even want to think about. But all things must pass, and owners really 
do need to think about what a chance to step down — on their own terms — 
can mean for them.
We talk throughout the book about retirement and estate planning, and valu-
ation is a key part of such planning. It determines virtually every aspect of an 
owner’s retirement, from the timing of his departure to the amount of money 
he’ll have available to support himself and his family members after work.
 
When you plan the sale of a company, you have more data to go on than rule-
of-thumb estimates such as the one you always hear (that any company of less 
than $20 million in revenues should go for three to five times annual net prof-
its at the time of sale). Without a clear, early look at valuation and specific 
actions taken to improve your entire operation and the timing of your exit, 
you’re really just guessing.
The kids are taking over!
Business survival gets tougher for each succeeding generation (you hear a lot 
more about this topic in Chapter 11). And even though passing on a business 
to the next generation isn’t always a sale situation that you find in the open 
market, owners must think of it in the same context as a sale process.
Even if the family members who take over the business from the owner have 
been with the company for a while and know it intimately, the current owner 
should speak with the family about the process of pass-down well in advance, 
and valuation should be part of the picture. As part of the long-term succession 
plan, the owner should have a professional value the company to determine 
whether the business should make certain operational, financial, or manage-
ment changes before the targeted transition date to the new generation.
Most of all, that process should be transparent. If family is already work-
ing within the company, it’s tough to do a valuation process without having 
everyone know about it, anyway.

159
 Chapter 10: Making Sure You’re Ready to Sell
Weighing the possibility of a merger or 
acquisition from a friendly suitor
If the owner of a family business expects — with good reason — that her 
company will sell at a premium if she decides to put it on the block, that’s 
still a good reason to do an independent valuation so that the business has 
completed all value-building exercises before talks begin.
As we mention, owners sometimes have trouble seeing all the pitfalls and 
sometimes the hidden benefits of the companies they’ve created. A dream 
buyer may be waiting in the wings, so it makes sense to plug that possibility 
into the planning process, which includes professional valuation.
Changing market conditions are 
threatening a company’s future
A proper valuation exercise doesn’t stop at present value. It gives you an 
idea of whether a company will be viable in the next two to three years. A valu-
ation expert can at least identify particular trends — both positive and nega-
tive — that may affect a company’s future.
Knowing that the sun is setting on an industry or a particular type of product 
may be sad news if you’ve devoted your life to it, but selling to a larger and 
more viable competitor while prices are fairly high can make such a tough 
decision worthwhile. It can also help you with price strategy ahead of time.
Bringing Valuation into the Picture 
before You Bring In the Buyers
The scenario of planning three to five years beforehand gives a business 
owner time for ample thought and preparation on how she wants to exit 
her business. She also gets time to understand the myriad details that go 
into a sale and that must be worked out with the help of proper advisors in 
the linked areas of legal, tax, wealth management, business strategy, and, of 
course, valuation.
 
A preliminary business valuation is essential in the early stages of preparation 
to sell a company. You must know what your business is presently worth 
before you can take well-advised steps to improve its value.

160
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Providing a reality check
Knowing problems ahead of time enables you to make repairs to a company’s 
systems and, therefore, increase its valuation. Here we list only some of the 
items and issues to address before a formal for-sale sign goes out in front of a 
business:
 
✓ Show profits and a steady growth trend not over months but over 
years. A business must be doing those financials professionally through-
out that time, preferably through normalized financial statements as 
time goes on. Even if you’ve never had to borrow for your business, 
approach the preparation and presentation of these numbers as if you 
were applying for a loan. Be sure to create pro forma data that adjusts 
for unusual or nonrecurring events and clearly identifies them.
 
 Are financial statements normalized or adjusted? Either term is fine 
because they mean the same thing: Normalized or adjusted financial 
statements have been adjusted to eliminate unusual items or anomalies 
and to enable clear comparisons. People use the terms interchangeably.
 
✓ Be in the right place at the right time — that is, have the right prod-
ucts ready for the marketplace at the time customers want them. Keep 
up with innovation, manufacturing, and distribution, particularly leading 
up to a possible sale date. The better your company looks, the better 
the value of your company looks.
 
✓ Forecast how the economy — and your particular business cycle — 
will impact your business by a particular sale date. The best time to 
sell a business (much as when selling a home) is in a healthy economy 
with interest rates at reasonable levels, in case your buyer needs to use 
financing to acquire your company. Make sure you can predict these fac-
tors with some degree of certainty, either alone or with expert help.
 
✓ Consider personal goals. Your personal goals are a huge factor. 
Everything from retiring to starting a family may be grounds for selling a 
company. Getting your personal wealth planning in order before you do 
your business plan makes a great deal of sense.
 
One early conversation in a negotiation is about the make-or-break aspects of 
the potential deal. Some prospective buyers ask whether the potential sellers 
care more about the down payment or the purchase price, for example. 
Because few buyers can do all-cash deals, the seller’s answer helps give shape 
to a potential offer in terms of cash, debt, and other considerations. Be ready 
with an answer in case a prospective buyer asks you this question.

161
 Chapter 10: Making Sure You’re Ready to Sell
Transparency: Preparing for a sale
Transparency, in a business sense, is a policy of sharing both good and 
bad news with fellow owners and shareholders, suppliers, customers, and 
potential buyers. It derives from the traditional definition of the word: to see 
through something. In recent years, it’s gotten a lot of usage because of com-
panies that tried to hide problems in their balance sheets, in their facilities, 
and in their direct dealings with shareholders and customers.
 
Do you want to attract the best buyers and business partners out there? Do 
you want to have an efficient deal process from overture to closing? If so, 
transparency is your first goal. It comes before valuation, and it certainly must 
come before negotiation.
The road to transparency involves carrying out the following tasks:
 
✓ Auditing your financials on an annual basis: Audited financials by a 
Certified Public Accountant willing to sign her name to her work is crucial 
if you’re expecting to borrow money, seek investors, or in all but the 
smallest-company situations, secure a buyer. People want to know that 
numbers are for real before they’ll sign a check, and they’ll want to see 
several years’ worth of audited figures, not just one year’s figures.
 
 If your company has been somewhat informal in its accounting 
methods — even if you or your designated chief financial officer have 
been handling your tax issues for years with no problems — it’s time to 
start pricing the services of reputable CPAs to audit those numbers. 
Because accountants typically price their services on an hourly basis 
and those rates are priced locally, plan for a significant bump in your 
professional services bills.
 
✓ Streamlining your data systems: Any number of well-run and asset-rich 
companies issue handwritten paper invoices and keep critical data on 
Post-it notes, but if you’re looking to make a deal, 20th-century record-
keeping has to go. Due diligence (see Chapters 12 and 16) involves 
plenty of questions and demands from potential suitors that require 
you — or their representatives — to chase data in your file cabinets, 
computers, and stockrooms. If particular industry standards require 
you to upgrade your computer systems or at least straighten out your 
“intuitive” filing systems into something an outsider can understand, 
that’s part of your prep work before valuation can begin.

162
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
 
✓ Adopting a warts-and-all disclosure policy: Got dirty laundry? Problem 
customers? A division with results that you absolutely know are going 
to stink in the next three to six months? If you’re opening your doors to 
potential buyers or partners, it’s best to develop an organization-wide 
philosophy of how you’ll handle and disclose bad news, not only to 
outsiders but also to each other. Bottom line: You need to get stuff out 
there first so it’s not discovered during due diligence. The more bad 
news others discover before you disclose, the worse it may be for the 
final number on your deal.
 
 Creating a disclosure culture is a very big challenge in a lot of private 
companies, particularly those with owners who rule with an iron fist. 
But if you’re going to try to do a major transaction, you need candor in 
your financials, processes, and facilities for an important reason: Candor 
builds trust, and trust is necessary to making a successful deal.
Heading off problems to increase value
Clear up any problems within the business that make it less attractive to 
buyers. Whether such issues are related to customers, management, regula-
tory, financial, or legal, the time frame of three to five years represents a 
chance to clean up these problems.
Consider these steps to take to enhance your business’s value:
 
✓ Assemble a quality team of professionals to work with you through-
out this process. Not many owners have the experience to prepare a 
company for sale or shepherd it through the sale process. Working with 
financial planning or tax experts is a good first step in addressing your 
wealth-management goals, and it goes a long way toward defining the 
kind of transaction you end up doing. You can then work with the right 
valuation, legal, and business advisory specialists to determine your 
current business value and which tactics you can use to make your busi-
ness more salable. We get to these strategies shortly.
 
✓ Remember that price is secondary to the best deal. A high offer for 
your company means little if buyers are mostly offering a promissory 
note rather than cash. A big part of why you’re selling has to do with 
your ability to monetize your investment in the company. Make sure 
you can actually do that quickly instead of having to wait years for your 
money.
 
✓ Understand that deals take time. Deals are not done in a day. They may 
take a series of negotiations, and you have to allow a prospective buyer 
time to do proper due diligence. By the time you get serious about a 
particular buyer, it may take a whole year to get to closing.

163
 Chapter 10: Making Sure You’re Ready to Sell
 
✓ Adjust that niche. This point may sound obvious, but is your business 
as attractive as it could be? If you steer your company into a market 
niche that is destined to leave it less vulnerable to competitive attack, 
it’s a salable point for the company.
 
✓ Turn off the perk spigot. To normalize financials, valuation experts 
eliminate items such as payments for company cars and other corporate 
perks. It may be a good idea to cut back on those nonessential expenses 
as you get closer to a sale. Even though they’re legal, they cut into prof-
itability, and that’s what you want going into a sale: a highly profitable 
company.
 
✓ Take a serious look at salaries. You have to do a real balancing act: 
trimming above-market salary levels to match comparables at public 
companies without chasing away talent. Obviously, you’re not going to 
slash salaries, but you may adjust benefits or salary levels that were 
once higher for incoming employees. Buyers will be basing their valu-
ation on this information, so it’s better to make the necessary salary 
adjustments while you have time on your side than to pay the price for 
failing to do so later.
 
✓ Reconsider bonuses. If you’re paying any unnecessary bonuses, con-
sider suspending them to make less of a drain on total profitability.
 
 Employees aren’t stupid. Any adjustments that you make to compensa-
tion issues will hit the grapevine sooner or later. Freshen up the com-
pany before a sale with tact and intelligence so you don’t push good 
people out the door at all levels of your operation.
 
✓ Start thinking through succession. Any buyer may waltz into a company 
and replace top executives with new picks, but good people are assets, 
too; buyers may hesitate to throw out talented managers just because 
they predate the new owners. However, prospective buyers may have 
justifiable concern that if owners — the ones who really want to take 
their money and run — are shouldering too much responsibility, the 
new owners may be stuck with a leadership vacuum. You may want 
to start handing off key responsibilities to talented managers who can 
make the transition into a new ownership situation.
 
✓ Consider staying liquid. Buyers and sellers can always agree on this 
fact: Cash has measurable value that anyone can see. If the fixed assets 
of your business may not produce that much value for you in a purchase 
negotiation, consider getting rid of those assets before you sell, and 
possibly lease what you need if it makes good financial sense for the 
business.
 
✓ Settle up. Various loans made by the company to its key shareholders 
or by shareholders to the company happen all the time, but buyers 
like as few potential claims on their assets as possible. Consider urging 
everyone to pay off those loans.

164
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
 
✓ Buy some paint. If your physical plant or office facilities are looking 
tired, dirty, or otherwise unattractive to visitors or customers, come 
up with an inexpensive way to spruce them up. Yes, in another nod to 
real estate sales, buyers like surroundings that are not only neat and 
clean but also attractive to anyone planning to spend money with the 
company in question. First impressions are everything — in financials as 
well as in furniture and window treatments. Who knows? You may even 
improve your current business climate by making your company more 
attractive to your current clients and customers.
 
✓ Increase the firepower on your board. One of the benefits of being a 
private company is that you can pretty much run governance how you 
want. But in these times, and if you’re looking at a sale or merger of the 
company, you have to be much more sensitive to how your governance 
actually works and appears to an outside buyer. Consider appointing 
some impressive outsiders to your board who not only have marquee 
value but also can bring genuine value to the board discussions.
 
 Advisory boards are big at small, growing companies. An advisory board 
of noncompetitive individuals who are nonetheless smart about your 
business can also make your business look snappy to outsiders.
 
✓ Always think about estate issues. The centerpiece of all this discussion 
is the personal welfare of you and your family members. In speaking 
with your tax or wealth-management advisors, see whether you can 
employ strategies to limit your exposure to estate taxes on the federal 
and state level, particularly if your business will be split among heirs or 
possibly sold or liquidated after your death.
You may not have three to five years to get your ducks in a row. You may not 
even have a year or two before your personal objectives change, or the shape 
of your industry changes, or you have an offer waiting on your doorstep. 
That’s why most experts tell you to do whatever it takes to get your company 
into an upward growth pattern. Hire better management if you need it, get 
those new financial controls and reporting systems in place, and get some 
solid advice on how much you should allocate for the costs of getting all 
these issues up to speed. In other words, be ready for anything — that’s good 
business strategy in any climate.
 
As you spend more to grow your business, costs may outrun your revenues 
for a time. Thus, you need to plan growth carefully as part of your overall 
value strategy.

Determining the Kind of Transaction 
You Want
Valuation isn’t just about making the business look nice and making the 
financial statements readable. Valuation can help you sort through the best 
transactional options for your business when the time comes to let go. Those 
options include the following:
 
✓ An outright sale
 
✓ Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)
 
✓ Transfer of ownership to family members
Estate tax turbulence is on the way
At the time this book was in production, consid-
erable worry was circulating about how estate 
taxes will affect Americans — particularly busi-
ness owners who plan to sell in the next few 
years.
Back in 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act triggered a gradual 
increase in the dollar threshold of estates sub-
ject to the estate tax. In tax year 2008, estates 
valued at more than $2 million were set to be 
taxed as much as 45 percent, and in tax year 
2009, the threshold was scheduled to rise to 
$3.5 million. In 2010, the tax was scheduled to 
be repealed for a year.
But in 2011, unless Congress acts in the mean-
time, the news gets bleak for business owners 
or anyone considered to be a high–net worth 
individual: The estate tax will be reset at up to 
55 percent on estates at a significantly lower 
threshold: $1 million. That’s a potentially big 
wallop for privately held companies, and busi-
nesses should seek guidance if they plan to sell 
in the next three to five years.
If you suspect that your estate or a relative’s 
estate from which you may inherit may fall prey 
to the estate tax, enlist the help of experts right 
now — before you sell your company. Both 
personal and business assets may grow over 
time — sometimes considerably if your efforts 
are successful — and your estate may turn out 
to be larger than you think. Keep these issues in 
mind during those conversations:
 ✓ Expected increases in assets: A grantor-
retained annuity trust, or GRAT, is an 
irrevocable trust that is popular among 
families with assets that are expected to 
increase, because such appreciation can 
be passed on to heirs with minimal tax 
consequences.
 ✓ A gifting strategy: Under current law, unlim-
ited amounts can be left to a spouse and 
to charity, free of federal estate tax. Other 
heirs can receive a total of $2 million, tax 
free, based on deaths that occurred in 2008. 
If your assets are over the estate tax limit, 
it may make sense to devise a gifting strat-
egy that spends down your total taxable 
estate while still allowing you a comfort-
able lifestyle. For instance, you may con-
sider making direct payments for someone 
else’s medical bills or education tuition. No 
gift tax applies for these items, so payments 
can be unlimited.

166
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
You find more on those options in the following sections.
Outright sale
A valuation professional can help you determine the best potential buyers for 
your business and identify the issues that will make your company most valu-
able. They can also acquaint you with optimal transaction data that you and 
your negotiators can work with.
Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP)
Valuation assistance is essential as a company develops an ESOP. Business 
owners use ESOPs to exit their company at fair market value while keeping 
ongoing management in place and providing a financial incentive to employ-
ees without paying capital gains tax. An ESOP is a popular exit strategy 
for many small to mid-size companies, but a valuation by an independent 
appraiser is one requirement for a transaction between an ESOP trust and an 
owner of the company that establishes the ESOP.
An ESOP is set up as a trust, and it can’t pay more than fair market value for 
the company stock that it purchases from the selling shareholder (the owner 
of the company).
The ESOP fiduciary (a board of trustees, an administrative committee, or an 
institutional trustee) uses the independent appraisal to ensure that the ESOP 
trust does not pay more than fair market value for the company stock, as 
determined as of the date of the sale. The ESOP fiduciary must conduct the 
proper due diligence to make this determination in good faith.
Ownership transfer to key family members
Valuation is a particularly important issue when passing down a business 
directly to family members. Whereas your goal may be to get the highest pos-
sible valuation if you’re selling to an outside party, you may be looking for 
the lowest defensible valuation if you’re transferring the business to children 
or other family members.
Owners of family businesses tend to gift shares of the business to a son or 
daughter over time for particular tax advantages. Confer with a tax profes-
sional in preparation for this process.

F
amilies own or control 90 percent of U.S. businesses. According to the 
Family Business Forum at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, 
only 30 percent make it into the second generation, and only 12 percent sur-
vive into the third. Fourth generation? Only 3 percent. A family business that 
makes it past one generation is a success story. Past two generations, it 
practically becomes a headline. Past three, it’s a dynasty.
If you want to see a valuation fight that’s possibly uglier than a divorce, just 
watch kids fighting over leadership of the family business or the money 
they think is coming to them. Family companies that last require plenty of 
planning, preparation, and open communication between family members 
and their advisors. When businesses pass from one generation to the next, 
they must plan for many contingencies. For example, in a family with several 
siblings, brothers and sisters working in the family business may feel they 
have a greater right to the company’s control and assets than the siblings 
who haven’t. These types of valuation squabbles are common in families that 
haven’t planned.
This chapter details which specific actions to take to plan for transitions in 
the family business and the specific valuation situations that arise. This 
chapter also focuses on valuing a business from the perspective of both a 
working and a nonworking sibling.

Planning for the Worst Possible Scenario
Suppose you’ve built an incredibly successful business. You have three 
kids — one’s 16 and already working at the company after school. She’s 
already said she wants to come back and run it after college, although you 
can’t really hold her to it — she’s a kid, after all. The other two kids are still 
in junior high.
Today your business has nothing but promise, and you look forward to the 
day you’ll be able to use this wealth to fund your kids’ education, secure your 
retirement, and then pass the business on to your kids so they can take it 
even higher.
The next weekend, you and your spouse are killed in a car accident.
So what does this story have to do with business value? Isn’t it mainly a personal 
finance matter? That all depends on what you’d want to happen in your business 
if something this horrible were to happen. Ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ Does your company have a management succession plan that designates 
leadership within the company to take over if you and your spouse were 
to vanish tomorrow? Would their talents be enough to keep the company 
going and help fund your kids’ education, and would those leaders be 
fine with allowing your kids into the business full time if they chose? Is 
this plan in writing?
 
✓ Does the business have a contingency plan for a sale of the company if 
current management didn’t want to stick with it and your oldest child 
were nowhere close to making a decision about her future? Does the 
sale plan outline an orderly plan so the company you created doesn’t go 
at fire-sale prices?
 
✓ Do you have both personal and financial guardianship in place for your 
kids? Seeing that your kids may stand to inherit sizable assets from 
either inside or outside the business, it may be wise to separate that 
guardianship by bringing in a trusted investment advisor and estate 
attorney to confer on such matters.
Obviously, planning ahead is best, especially where family is concerned. But 
what if you don’t have time, or your kids are already grown and you don’t 
have a plan in place? You can still watch out for certain things, and you can 
take steps to fix your situation. Keep reading.
 
According to the Family Business Institute, about a third of family businesses 
have a chief executive who’s older than 60, with an average age of 54. Eleven 
percent are older than 71 years old.

 Chapter 11: Deciding What to Do about the Family Company
Examining the State of 
the Family Business
For many small to mid-size companies, the biggest potential complication in 
the valuation process is family. Why? Because families always bring added 
baggage to the business process. Favoritism runs rampant in commerce 
because it’s supposed to be survival of the fittest. But the family business? 
The fairness doctrine applied to the family dinner table doesn’t always 
translate to the boardroom.
The business news pages — and sometimes front pages — love stories about 
family squabbles over money and power. Just ask the Murdochs, Redstones, 
and Bancrofts — recent high-profile examples of families involved in huge 
businesses that couldn’t agree on the future of their legacy.
Are we saying that family companies have a tougher time realizing the full 
value of their business? Not at all. But we do believe that founders who don’t 
have a long-term plan to work with their families on the future leadership and 
valuation strategies of their companies risk devaluation at the time of their 
death or retirement. In this section, we discuss some special issues concerning 
family businesses.
Specific characteristics 
of family companies
A 2007 study by wealth-management firm Laird Norton Tyee indicates not 
only how important family-owned companies are but also why their longevity 
can erode over time:
 
✓ More than 80 percent of the firms polled had between 20 and 499 workers, 
with sales ranging from $5 million to $30 million.
 
✓ Though family-owned businesses generate 64 percent of the nation’s 
gross domestic product, nearly 60 percent of majority-share owners in 
family businesses are 55 or older, and 30 percent are 65 or older; how-
ever, less than 30 percent have succession plans and less than 40 per-
cent have a successor lined up.
 
✓ Family finances are too tied to business success — 93 percent of respon-
dents have little or no income diversification, deriving the majority of 
the family’s income and security from the business.

170
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
 
✓ Two-thirds of family businesses don’t require family members to have 
the qualifications or related experience necessary to be successful when 
entering the business. Twenty-five percent think the next generation is 
not competent enough to take the reins.
 
✓ Nearly half of American family businesses are operating without a 
written strategic plan.
 
✓ In most family-owned firms — 75 percent — strategic decisions are 
guided by a board of directors, an advisory board, or both. More than 
54 percent of these boards consist of family members only; however, 
over 43 percent of the firms polled have boards with a mix of family and 
nonfamily members alike. Of the firms that use boards, 77 percent agree 
or strongly agree that they make positive contributions to the direction 
of the business. The remaining 25 percent of firms say they don’t have a 
board of any kind.
What does all this mean in the context of business valuation? That many 
companies may not be worth as much as the owners think, simply because 
their companies don’t follow best practices for their industry, nor are their 
finances or business strategy in the best of shape.
How families hurt the value 
of their businesses
The worst problem that family businesses have is the failure to plan for 
succession. Nonfamily businesses generally see plenty of woe when they 
haven’t addressed succession. Yet in the family context, this practice gets 
put off mainly due to the possibility of hurt feelings among various family 
members in the business or an unwillingness for the current generation to 
step aside.
Yet the succession issue is usually linked to other critical problems that 
threaten the value and future of the firm:
 
✓ No succession planning? Probably no real wealth planning, either. Most 
smart financial advisors who work with independent businesspeople say 
that entrepreneurs should do parallel planning that addresses the needs 
of the family and the business at the same time. Parallel planning is based 
on the idea that the family comes first — which makes sense — and that 
those wealth priorities should largely drive business strategy.
 
✓ Strong owners can be weak at leadership development. Family businesses
with a strong, hands-on owner may not hire the best midlevel talent 
because the owner is focused solely on having a particular family 
member take over someday. Perhaps there’s been an anointed heir 
apparent, but what if something happens to that person or her priorities 
change? Sometimes a little creative tension between family members 

171
 Chapter 11: Deciding What to Do about the Family Company
and nonfamily members in a business can be good for the overall 
performance of a company. Nevertheless, some owners of family 
businesses don’t want to see outsiders jockeying for position.
 
✓ No strict rules govern family members coming into the business — or 
back into the business. Many owners are fine with having their kids 
and other family members work for other companies for a few years 
before they launch a career with the family business. Giving kids a 
choice — and a chance to succeed or fail somewhere else — is usually a 
good idea. But what if one of the kids chucks his job at age 40 and tells 
the CEO — who may be his mother, father, brother, or sister — that he 
wants to come back? What does that mean for the power or wealth 
distribution structure of the business going forward? Many families 
don’t consider how family members moving in and out of the family 
business may affect the operations of its business or its wealth structure.
 
✓ The next generation isn’t trained to play nicely. Just because you’re 
related by blood doesn’t mean you’re natural collaborators. As with 
all workers in a business, family members must establish professional 
chemistry to get the job done. If a cousin and a son of the founder have 
never seen eye to eye because of some fight they had when they were 
teens, that shouldn’t seep into the culture of the business — but often 
it does.
 
✓ Families can be resistant to change, and so can their companies. A 
big reason people start businesses is so they can do things their way. 
Unfortunately, that my-way-or-the-highway attitude can metastasize into 
“that’s the way we’ve always done it” as founders and their children age 
in the business. Innovation and new product development — elements 
that are the primary drivers of value within any company — can face 
larger obstacles in family businesses when this is the case.
 
✓ No formal compensation structure exists. Asking Mom and Dad for 
money is a dynamic that starts early in most kids’ memories. Without a 
formal compensation review structure, next-generation family members 
may feel they’re going hat in hand to their folks for money, not demanding 
their proper compensation for the work they’re doing, when asking for a 
raise or pay equal to one’s peers in the industry at competing businesses.
 
 Family businesses that don’t review compensation on a regular basis 
may find that they’re underpaying or overpaying family members and 
other employees, which is their right on an ongoing basis, but it’s some-
thing that may lower a potential sale price when valuation is done later.
Add general family conflicts inside and outside the business: Maybe some-
one’s getting divorced in the family and both spouses work in the business; 
the owner retires but can’t stop meddling; long-term sibling rivalries reignite; 
the ugly secret of unequal pay surfaces; or siblings may decide to start fight-
ing like 8-year-olds again. Can all family conflict inside and outside the busi-
ness be diffused with proper planning? Certainly not. But planning involves 
worst-case scenarios that families may not be aware of, and considering them 
is important.

172
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Family wealth and business: Are they inseparable?
Many owners of family businesses haven’t planned for a smooth transition 
to the next generation. In a 2003 Raymond Institute/MassMutual survey, less 
than a fifth of family business participants said they hadn’t completed any 
estate planning other than writing a will, and less than two-fifths had written 
a strategic plan for their companies.
Our point is this: You should work with family members from the time they’re 
young to gauge their interest and involvement in the business, because doing 
so will be crucial to valuation later. Enthusiastic and talented employees 
who just happen to be family tend to be much more dedicated to growing the 
company than family members who use the business as a fallback employer.
 
Family members who know where they stand as participants or nonparticipants 
in the family business are likelier to pull together and do what’s best for the 
business as transitions occur.
Separating family issues from business issues
Ask any loving parents who their favorite child is, and they’ll likely answer, 
“I love them equally.” And in most cases, it won’t be simple diplomacy. They 
do love them equally, and they want them to inherit equal wealth.
Facts about family-owned companies
The following statistics were collected by the 
Boston-based Family Firm Institute:
 ✓ The leadership of 39 percent of family-
owned businesses changed hands by the 
end of 2008.
 ✓ Thirty-four percent of family firms expected 
the next CEO to be a woman; 52 percent of 
participants hired at least one female family 
member full time, and 10 percent employed 
two female family members of the same 
status.
 ✓ Of CEOs age 61 or older and due to retire in 
2008, 55 percent had not yet chosen their 
replacement.

173
 Chapter 11: Deciding What to Do about the Family Company
In most families with nonbusiness assets, that kind of equal separation works 
as long as a proper will and supporting documents make that split clear. 
But when you have a family company in which all or some of the kids are 
employed, the story can be much different. Some parents may attempt the 
equal-split approach, only to find out that the kids who went on to work for 
Mom and Dad don’t necessarily believe that their siblings who struck off on 
their own careers are entitled to the amount they’re getting.
Consider this example: Dad created and grew a business over three decades, 
and he died suddenly without an estate plan or succession plan to guide 
the company’s operations or potential distribution of assets. (This scenario 
happens all the time — just don’t let it happen to you.) He had five adult 
children, but only one worked in the business. When Dad died, that sibling 
stepped up to the plate to keep the ship afloat and, like Dad, began to grow 
the company. After the funeral, this working sibling followed up with her 
father’s verbal wish to split the ownership of the company five ways. For a 
while, all was fine.
Yet within a year, the new CEO began to regret her father’s lack of planning. 
Two of her siblings were busy with their own affairs and happy with her 
leadership, but one — an older brother — started to involve himself more 
directly in the business. He said he was helping his sister as his father would 
have done; she thought he was second-guessing her leadership style.
As for the fourth sibling, she recently went through a divorce and was strug-
gling financially as a single parent. To straighten out her finances, she wanted 
her one-fifth share of the family business. No plan covered this situation. 
Would the other siblings have to buy her out? Would the company have to 
take on debt to pay her the share of the business she was entitled to?
As you can guess, this scenario isn’t an optimal situation under which to 
value a business. Any situation that involves time pressure — particularly the 
unpleasant emotional pressure among family members — leaves no oppor-
tunity to spot and correct problems that could improve its valuation later. 
And when such problems are spotted, that’s even greater cause for conflict 
between family members.
Increasingly, families are looking at new ways to train their children for 
family business employment and diffuse the battle over family wealth 
creation. We get to that later in the chapter.

Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Why “equal” in a family business 
isn’t always fair
A partial or minority interest is a very important concept in business valua-
tion. By their very nature, holders of minority positions in a company don’t 
have any say in the management of a company as those with majority posi-
tions do, and they also face an uphill battle to acquire the additional shares 
necessary to buy a majority stake in a company.
This is why in the valuation process, a discount for lack of control (also 
called a minority discount) is assigned when this structure is used. It’s much 
Does your business look like this?
Ivan Landsberg, a Yale University expert in 
family business, coined the term succession 
conspiracy — how business owners, their 
spouses, their family members, and non-
family co-workers either consciously or 
unconsciously make damaging decisions that 
foil the effective succession of the business to 
the next generation.
He described three general types of family 
business management structures back in the 
1980s:
 ✓ Controlling owner: A single owner is 
involved in every aspect of the business 
and makes critical decisions. Typically 
little or no planning occurs for this owner’s 
departure.
 ✓ Sibling partnership: Siblings may share 
leadership, or a lead sibling may be des-
ignated — or designated by default — to 
make most of the business’s key decisions.
 ✓ Cousin consortium: This structure is 
common among some of the biggest family 
fortunes in the world. When the business 
has been passed on to the children of 
prior sibling owners, eventually several 
branches of the family share ownership, and 
coalitions may be formed to create blocks 
of stock that represent more voting power.
Aligning with any of these ownership structures 
doesn’t mean your family company is neces-
sarily sliding off the rails. But if you recognize 
yourself in any of these structures, ask yourself 
whether the following also applies:
 ✓ The owner has created a succession plan 
that not only sets benchmarks for who 
the next-generation leadership will be but 
also comes with full buy-in from all family 
members, young and old, with a stake in the 
business.
 ✓ The owner and top family officers have 
spoken with family members recently 
either separately or in a group about their 
feelings about the business and whether 
any conflicts or issues need to be worked 
out. Better yet, is there a formal meeting 
structure?
 ✓ The owner has helped craft — with experi-
enced legal and tax professionals — a qual-
ity transition plan that allows her the money 
and freedom to work in the family business 
if she’s asked or to comfortably start retire-
ment or a new phase of her career.

175
 Chapter 11: Deciding What to Do about the Family Company
easier to sell 100 percent of a company than it is to share a minority owner-
ship position. And do very many owners of small to mid-size companies want 
to deal with minority owners who may not want to sell? No. It’s a pain.
The value you lose through the partial interest discount can be pretty sub-
stantial. Valuation professionals say that between 25 percent and 75 percent 
of value can be erased in a sale situation.
That’s why the equal split of shares among siblings and other family mem-
bers is so fraught with danger. You need to single out people for perfor-
mance, whether they’re your family members or not. Also, with equal stakes, 
you may see the dynamic of the “cousin consortium” emerge — nonpartici-
pating or less-senior family members may wrest control after combining their 
voting power based on their shares. (See the nearby sidebar “Does your busi-
ness look like this?” for more on the cousin consortium and other manage-
ment structures.)
 
The founder who splits the family business “equally” isn’t doing her family 
many favors; she’s simply creating the battlefield for a family war. If one family 
member wants control — or is already working in a position senior to the rest 
of his family members — he essentially would have to lobby the others either 
to purchase their stakes or to join with them as a voting bloc to award control, 
depending on the company’s bylaws.
Getting Your Family Down to Business
Valuable companies do more than make money. They reflect a particular 
stability in terms of ownership and management consistency going forward. 
To accomplish this stability, leadership has to be established, contingencies 
have to be identified and planned for, and family conflict has to be dealt with 
in a businesslike way.
Does that mean that family can never argue? Of course not. Even when rela-
tives are angry and yelling at each other, at least they’re talking. What’s 
important for a company’s long-term valuation strategy is to set a firm man-
agement structure at the company and determine a means of settling griev-
ances that arise — including talking openly about such issues as fairness, 
multigenerational issues, and unmarried partners (more about those topics 
later).
 
Bad estate planning can happen in the wealthiest of families. It’s not unheard 
of in the richest of families for the matriarchs and patriarchs to die or become 
incapacitated without proper wills or directives for their heirs. Every adult 
family member — young or old — should commit to creating such documents 
and, as appropriate, have them written in a way that doesn’t shipwreck the 
family fortune or mission, no matter how big or small it is.

176
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Following a phased-in approach
If you’re reading this book, you may be part of a mature family business 
that needs valuation for a specific reason. But if you’re forming or buying a 
business and you’re looking for ways to bring value-aware family members 
into the business as they age, consider this phased-in approach to do that:
 
✓ Understand from day one that it’s all about choice. You made your 
own choice to go into business. Your kids must make a choice to join 
the family business later. You have to be prepared for them to say no — 
or for you to say no if they’re simply not right for it.
 
✓ Talk about the family business as early as possible in your kids’ lives. 
Share stories about your company, its purpose, and its people, and 
explain both the good and the bad parts of working for yourself. Mostly, 
communicate your passion about it. Teaching kids positive values about 
work and the importance of having the freedom to choose a career you 
love is good, and that part can’t start early enough.
 
✓ If your kids are interested in the business, start the kids young and 
increase their job responsibility as they grow older. See whether your 
children want to work in the family business to earn spending money 
while they’re young (check with your tax advisor before you attempt 
this approach). Then let the kids decide whether they want to move into 
different roles as they get into their teens and through college. This way, 
you get to see as the child grows whether working for the family com-
pany is just about the money or about building a lifetime career. It’s 
probably most effective management-development program you’ll run.
So your kids are in grammar school? Plan anyway
Considering how the transfer of assets will go 
in a family can never start early enough. Your 
objective is to preserve the value of the busi-
ness and personal assets you’ve created, no 
matter how old you and your kids are. As we 
discuss in Chapter 10, the uncertainty over 
the estate tax exemption in the next few years 
means that the best idea is to discuss strategy 
now rather than later.
Most financial experts advise that you revise 
your estate plan every five years or as lifestyle 
issues change.
Remember, the estate and valuation issues 
with your business don’t exist in a vacuum. To 
ensure that the value of your business will ben-
efit your kids and future generations, you need 
to do some very prescient planning.

177
 Chapter 11: Deciding What to Do about the Family Company
 
✓ Start putting together plans for a series of family meetings that discuss 
the business before your kids are out of college. Between you and your 
advisors, come up with a plan that establishes how your children will 
own and control your business at the time of your death. Plan to hold 
your first official family meeting with all your kids (assuming that the 
youngest one is already involved in the family business in some way) to 
discuss the qualifications for ownership in your company after you die 
or hand over the reins. We get to some scenarios shortly.
 
✓ When all or a few of your children are working full time in your busi-
ness, make sure they’re subject to the same types of salary and perfor-
mance evaluations as your nonfamily employees. The results of those 
reviews should also be factors in justifying their qualifications for various 
jobs within the company.
Based on the discussions you’ve had with your tax and estate advisors, make 
sure you have a system set up to meet annually or semiannually with your 
entire family to discuss the family business. Some call these family business 
councils, and their structure should expand over time with the size of the 
family and the members who are involved in the business.
If you want to know more about estate planning, we suggest that you read 
Estate Planning For Dummies, by N. Brian Caverly, Esq., and Jordan S. Simon 
(Wiley), for a broader view on the subject.
Setting your family meeting structure
Nothing is wrong with the living room for an 
annual family business meeting if you’re talking 
about your immediate family, but consider these 
guidelines as your business evolves:
 ✓ Always have a formal agenda that all 
participating members contribute to in 
advance. As in any business meeting, you 
should be prepared with facts and exhibits, 
if necessary. Distribute this agenda before 
the meeting so everyone can review it.
 ✓ Designate a facilitator for the meeting — in 
small groups, the responsibility can move 
around (it’s good training for the kids), but 
as the group gets larger, you may want 
to work with a professional facilitator or 
someone who can manage the event with-
out a stake in it.
 ✓ Appoint someone to act as the meeting 
secretary to keep a running history of dis-
cussion in these meetings.
 ✓ Make it a priority to increase the growth 
and value of the company, and devote at 
least part of the meeting to report on how 
that’s going.
 ✓ Set ground rules about anger and conflict. 
In family businesses, emotions run high, 
and unchecked emotion in family meetings 
can derail other critical business.
 ✓ As more family members join the business, 
consider neutral territory if doing so makes 
the crowd more comfortable and facilitates 
discussion.

178
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Addressing the fairness question head-on
Nobody knows how his or her kids are going to turn out or which one will 
end up being the business genius who will take the family company to a 
whole new level. Here are your options:
 
✓ Assuming that one of your kids turns out to be the genius and the rest 
are merely good water carriers, the best solution may be to name her 
the heir apparent early and develop a plan to give proportional amounts 
of nonbusiness assets to the other children at the time of the transition 
of leadership or at your death. If you don’t have the full amount of those 
assets in place now, you’ll probably require an investment strategy to 
build them — and that should also be part of the planning.
 
✓ Another option is to give the child or children working in the business 
the opportunity to buy out their parents’ share, which would give the 
parents money to live on in their retirement.
 
✓ A third possibility is for the dominant child in the business to arrange 
a plan in concert with the parents to buy out the other siblings before 
or after the deaths of the parents. Again, this is a critical issue to be dis-
cussed among family members and trusted financial advisors, but one 
option to pay off the other siblings may involve buying a life insurance 
policy for one or both of the parents that would secure the payment 
amounts to the other siblings.
Setting up the best plan 
for the generations
In families with significant assets or other pressing financial issues that 
involve businesses or dependents, each generation’s wishes for the dispersal 
of shared or personal assets should be documented legally and shared with 
all the relevant parties.
In many cases, the main topic of discussion is the multigenerational family 
business, perhaps one of the most complex estate issues any family will face. 
In others, the assets may consist mainly of cash, property, and other invest-
ments, but similar problems can occur when not all parties are on the same 
page about who will get what.
In the following sections, we cover some of the issues related to generational 
concerns and address what needs to be done to keep the family business 
afloat.

179
 Chapter 11: Deciding What to Do about the Family Company
Preventing problems
Estate planning isn’t just about splitting up money — it’s also about disaster 
planning. If a family hasn’t planned for business succession, other damaging 
secrets may emerge, such as problems in the business or significant debt the 
family may be liable for.
Also, the sudden death or lengthy incapacitation of the head of a family may 
turn chaotic without proper healthcare or financial directives to manage the 
person’s illness or the money and business issues that follow.
Multigenerational estate planning may not be the easiest task in the world 
to accomplish, given how families communicate — or don’t communicate — 
about money. But such dialogue may be the smartest action any family takes 
together.
Supporting the family legacy
Proper discussion, documentation, and review of a family’s assets — with 
the participation of the right legal, tax, and financial planning advisors — can 
keep more of those assets in the family and working to the family’s wishes. 
In the case of a family business, generations of family members have built 
careers there or may otherwise be depending on that income to live.
Yet a business may not even be at the heart of an issue. Families may also 
have foundations or other charitable activities that they’ve supported for 
years with a certain mission that the people in charge don’t want changed. 
More than a few families have imploded in ugly legal squabbles over these 
situations and more. The results can be lengthy legal battles with damaging tax 
consequences, a potentially unfair split of assets among relatives, or simple 
mismanagement of those assets going forward.
Considering unmarried partners
 
Not everyone gets married before starting a family. Multigenerational planning 
should also address estate and child custody arrangements for unmarried 
heterosexual or gay couples who may or may not have done the appropriate 
legal planning necessary to secure the estates of their current or past partners 
and their heirs.
At the very least, all family members should understand the need for such 
planning to avoid conflict later. As nontraditional families become more 
common, families need to be open to that discussion to protect family and 
business assets from disputes later.

Due Diligence on the Sell Side
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why sellers have to do due diligence
▶ Identifying the three stages of due diligence
▶ Making an informational game plan
▶ Gathering information on your own company
V
aluation is an important part of the reality check every seller should 
make. Think about it — examining your own company without bias is 
tough. That’s why you need professionals to focus on that. The bottom line 
is that a potential seller absolutely must conduct thoughtful due diligence 
months — and preferably years — before the business goes on the market.
Due diligence means investigating your company with the cold eye you’d 
bring to any target. For anyone doing the job, it involves reading everything, 
asking plenty of questions inside and outside an organization, and generally 
leaving no stone unturned in finding out what makes a company tick and how 
much it’s truly worth. It involves not only basic research and calculations but 
also the ability to forecast how a company will do years from now.
This chapter focuses on the soft and hard skills necessary to value busi-
nesses successfully before you sell.

Due diligence is a process in which you ask for and obtain as much timely 
and accurate information about an organization as you can get so you can 
thoroughly evaluate a transaction. When people say to “do your due diligence” 
about something, they’re essentially telling you to do your homework before 
you make a decision.

182
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
 
In the context of business valuation, today’s concept of due diligence origi-
nated during the Great Depression. The Securities Act of 1933 handed broker/
dealers (people licensed to sell investments) the due diligence defense. The 
act essentially allowed these professionals some protection against lawsuits 
from investors accusing them of inadequate disclosure of information before 
they purchased securities. As long as brokers conducted due diligence on the 
investments they sold and could prove it, they’d be allowed such protection in 
court.
If you’re selling a business, consider these primary reasons for doing due 
diligence with an independent valuation professional:
 
✓ You don’t want to lose out on a potential transaction. Whether your 
company is planning to sell soon or at a date relatively far in the future, 
a thorough look at the value of your firm’s assets is a starting point for a 
sales strategy. The process gives you the following:
 
• The current value of all your company’s assets, both tangible and 
intangible
 
• An unbiased view of how well you’re prepared for retirement or to 
pass the business on to heirs
 
• A value profile that you can compare to those of similar companies 
in the field and plug into the profiles of potential acquirers
 
✓ You can’t produce valuation information yourself. Although you may 
be well tuned into the tangible and intangible information that helps you 
run a business, you may not know where to look for the information that 
helps you do a full valuation. After a valuation by an independent profes-
sional, you’ll have a better idea of how to track and store information 
that’s key to a future valuation process from a potential buyer.
 
✓ You need to look at your company as if you were a potential buyer. 
Having a trained professional do the valuation is wise because you need 
someone with the skills to look at a business both impartially and criti-
cally. Even the most hard-bitten member of your management team can’t 
accomplish this process, because it’s hard to value what one creates.
 
✓ You want to get the best advice that fits your industry. Valuation has a 
way of bringing a selling company up to speed on both its strengths and 
weaknesses. Part of the valuation process involves gathering benchmark 
data that reflects the best practices in its industry — practices to emu-
late before a sale takes place so that the value of the company will go 
up, not down. After the valuation, you can clean up any problems within 
the business that make it less attractive to buyers (see Chapter 10 for 
some ways to give your company a makeover).

183
 Chapter 12: Due Diligence on the Sell Side
 
When valuation professionals evaluate a company, they look at plenty of infor-
mation, but they don’t bury their instincts. Obviously, this book is about the 
process and fact-gathering procedures of valuation, but due diligence is very 
much about what goes on with your eyes, with your ears, and inside your 
head through the simple act of observation.
Understanding the Three Stages 
of Due Diligence
We can’t overemphasize the importance of people skills in valuation. So 
much of what valuation professionals do to build access to an organization 
involves building comfort and trust with the people inside. No matter what 
the valuation is, the process generally involves three steps, in which those 
people skills definitely come in handy:
 
1. The meet and greet.
 
 After companies have their initial discussion about a possible deal, the 
first stage of the process is generally an onsite meeting in which the 
valuation professional tours the facilities — sometimes with the client, 
sometimes without — and meets management and the key officers she’ll 
be speaking with throughout the due diligence process. The purpose 
here is to figure out where all the key data is and which company offi-
cials will and won’t be able to talk about the business.
 
2. The hunting and gathering.
 
 Otherwise known as the data dump, this stage is when company reports, 
financials, and other data are collected and then subjected to question-
ing and calculation under appropriate methods of valuation.
 
3. The once-over.
 
 This step involves the final fact-checking and review of any events that 
have taken place since valuation was done.
Beyond these basics are details that come up as a result of the type of busi-
ness and people involved. For that reason, we can’t devote much coverage to 
each of the steps, because each case is different. Just assume that you need 
to tailor each step to fit your particular circumstances and that you need 
to pay attention to any details that arise. The rest of this book can certainly 
help you get a handle on what to watch for.

Tricks of the Trade: Collecting 
and Exchanging Information
One important part of your informational game plan is setting up your rules 
of thumb, which we discuss at length in Chapter 9. Rules of thumb provide a 
good start for researching the types of other businesses that are for sale in 
your class. However, no company should begin and end the valuation process 
at rules of thumb. Without a clear look at your business, you’re really just 
guessing.
When you plan the sale of a company, you have more data to go on — much 
of which you share with the potential buyer. In the following sections, we 
discuss confidentiality agreements and the kinds of company data you’ll 
exchange.
Gathering your own company data
This section provides a very basic list of documents and data that companies 
typically exchange in the due diligence process. Most of this information 
comes from the company that’s up for sale, but depending on the type of pro-
posed transaction and the parties involved, some of this data may originate 
on both sides of the table.
In any case, if you’re contracting a valuation before a sale process begins, 
knowing what material will change hands is a good idea. Here’s the list:
 
✓ A summary of what’s for sale, right down to the cash registers on the 
floor
 
✓ A summary of what’s not for sale
 
✓ A history of the target company
 
✓ The balance sheet — or a reasonable summary — of assets and liabilities 
for the last three to five years (both annual and quarterly reports)
 
✓ The income statement — or a reasonable summary — of the company’s 
profit-and-loss history for the last three to five years (both annual and 
quarterly reports)
 
 Why use the term reasonable summary? Wouldn’t this be automatic? 
Well, private companies don’t have to act like public companies. Some 
target businesses have, shall we say, a rather informal approach to 
bookkeeping. If a business is looking for a buyer, a banker, or possibly 
public ownership someday, it should take a more formal approach to 
this data.

185
 Chapter 12: Due Diligence on the Sell Side
 
✓ The company’s own five-year financial forecast (if it exists)
 
✓ Market share/demographic information (if it exists)
 
✓ Lists of competitors and the status of their products
 
✓ The company’s ownership structure, with shareholder percentages (to 
explain who owns what and what voting rights they have)
 
✓ Bios of the company’s directors and executives
 
✓ Tax returns for the last three to five years and information on who did 
them — and a record of the last year the company was audited
 
✓ A summary of all open and settled litigation for the last five to ten years
 
✓ Complete monthly payroll data, including the number of employees, 
their function, and their average hourly rate
 
✓ A summary of physical inventory for the past three years
 
✓ All executive and employee pension data, including information on 
whether various plans are fully or partially funded
 
✓ Organizational charts/résumés of top employees
 
✓ A discussion of international business (if any)
 
✓ A listing of all suppliers, domestic and international
 
✓ All customer data — invoices, payment records, order backlogs (if any)
 
✓ A listing of all sales and manufacturers representatives/commission 
schedules for the last three to five years
 
✓ Personnel contracts, as well as data on bonus programs, deferred com-
pensation, stock options, and profit-sharing plans
 
✓ All data on employee insurance — health, life, disability, and so on
 
✓ All patents, copyrights, and license agreements
 
✓ A list of all legal, accounting, and consulting professionals working with 
the company
 
If you don’t fully disclose your company’s risk scenario to a potential buyer, it 
could lead to litigation down the line. Your advance due diligence efforts can 
pay off here. If you do a public-records data search, you can conceivably cap-
ture all the information you need on past lawsuits, liens, and even divorce and 
estate provisions that can delay or prevent transition of ownership. If your 
company’s disclosure doesn’t meet the results of your thorough research, 
buyers will see that as a red flag.

Databases to bookmark
Unless otherwise indicated, the following 
resources are free databases you can check in 
your pajamas at home, but you don’t necessar-
ily have to pay money to access the databases 
that aren’t free — just start hanging out at the 
public library or, even better, visit your local 
college and university libraries, which generally 
offer access to paid databases that you can use 
for free. Start bookmarking these databases:
 ✓ Library of Congress (www.loc.gov): 
Literally the world’s largest library, it’s a 
free resource on virtually every subject out 
there.
 ✓ LexisNexis (www.lexisnexis.com): 
This is a paid service, and it can get quite 
pricey, so call your local library to see 
whether it has this one. LexisNexis has 
general news and publication databases 
that were the foundation of its business, 
but the company now has specialized 
databases for the legal, tax, corporate, and 
sales communities.
 ✓ ChoicePoint (www.choicepoint.
com): This one is another paid service 
from LexisNexis, but it’s a ready resource 
for bankruptcy and litigation records, tax 
liens, and commercial and incorporation 
filings in various states.
 ✓ The Central Intelligence Agency (www.
cia.gov): Who would’ve thought the CIA 
would help the average information-hungry 
businessperson? No, this site won’t tell you 
whether that strange guy down the street 
is really a spy (or something creepier), but 
it’s the home of the World Factbook, which 
provides tons of information, including 
market data on virtually every country 
on the planet — right down to how many 
cellphones a nation has in use.
 ✓ YouTube (www.youtube.com): This 
ever-expanding video site has a surprising 
amount of business content. As companies 
large and small get more sophisticated 
about using video to reach people on vari-
ous issues, you may find clips of annual 
meetings, analysts’ briefings, and other 
specialized content. Just search for 
the person, company, or subject you’re 
interested in and see what comes up.
 ✓ U.S. Census/American Factfinder (fact
finder.census.gov): This database 
helps you gather key data on population, 
spending, education, and every other topic 
the U.S. Census covers.
 ✓ ProQuest (www.proquest.com): This is 
a leading database of academic, trade, and 
popular press publications; it’s accessible 
mainly through colleges and universities.

 Chapter 12: Due Diligence on the Sell Side
Protecting your company with a 
confidentiality agreement
Maybe no sale is immediately in the offing, but before any financial transaction 
can happen, both buyer and seller have to know that sensitive information 
will be protected. That’s universal for public and private companies — 
private companies may be notoriously secretive, but public companies also 
like to protect proprietary information from competitors and generally like to 
keep deal talks private until a deal is actually reached.
The due diligence process requires that both sides disclose lawsuits, debts, 
and other obligations that their companies face — and the most sensitive of 
all information: what people get paid. Thus, you typically need paperwork 
before due diligence can start.
Enter the confidentiality agreement. Such an agreement can be as general or 
as specific (mentioning exact data and documents you don’t want disclosed) 
as you want, but above all, it should meet your specific needs and concerns 
for the deal at hand.
Having a template to work from is always helpful. Following is a plain-vanilla 
version of a confidentiality agreement signed between two parties. Attorneys 
or advisors may advise changes in wording and requirements, but here’s the 
gist it should follow:
Confidentiality Agreement
By and between ABC and XYZ, nonprofit corporations incorporated in
_______________.
ABC and XYZ are engaged in merger negotiations. As this process proceeds, 
sensitive, confidential, and/or proprietary information may be exchanged by 
the parties. In order to protect the privacy and business interests of each of 
the parties, they agree to the following terms:
 
1. At the conclusion of negotiations, if a merger is not agreed to, all copies 
of all documents distributed to each party by the other party or its 
agents will be returned to the originating party.

188
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
 
2. Neither party will at any time during the period of merger negotiations 
or after merger negotiations are concluded make known to any third 
party any information or furnish any documents containing information 
pertaining to the other party.
 
3. In the event a merger is not agreed upon, neither party will make any 
use or take advantage of anything it has learned about the other party’s 
organization, board, staff, clients, finances, legal dealings, or operations, 
nor will it use anything it has so learned to compete with the other 
party.
 
4. In the event a merger is not agreed upon, the parties will agree upon a 
joint statement to be issued to any third party requesting information 
about the merger negotiations. This statement will reflect positively 
upon both parties.
This agreement is entered into this _____ day of _____, _____.

Case Study: Valuation 
on the Sell Side
In This Chapter
▶ Anticipating common valuation problems and preparing your family
▶ Establishing a prevaluation plan
▶ Doing the actual valuation
M
ost valuation professionals get a call when a triggering event occurs 
in a business owner’s life or the life of his or her family. Maybe the 
owner just died. Maybe the owner is just burned out or suddenly realizes for 
a host of reasons that it’s time to retire. Maybe family members are squab-
bling about taking over the business. Maybe the owner is terminally ill. The 
designated family member calls with a familiar panic in her voice. “We don’t 
know if anyone wants to keep running the business,” she says, “and we can’t 
afford to keep it open.” And then comes the all-important question: “How 
much do you think we’ll get?”
At this point, the best valuation professionals often have to deliver the worst 
news: that without a plan made while the owner was alive, family members 
may not see much benefit at all from selling the business. Worse, they may 
actually lose money preparing the business for sale or closure.
The decision to sell without analyzing the tax consequences, advantages, or 
disadvantages of potential deal structures or how a sale would fit your per-
sonal and financial goals can be catastrophic to you, your company, and your 
family. This “sign today, sell tomorrow” mentality is common, and most expe-
rienced valuation professionals see it as a decision-making process without a 
process. In this chapter, we provide some case studies and attempt to show 
you how to make sure that your decision to sell isn’t met with bad news.
You can see another case study on valuation of a business in Chapter 18, 
dealing mainly with the investigative process buyers need to bring to bear to 
decipher the correct value of a company. This chapter deals with common 
examples that show how critical planning is to a high valuation for the 
company you’ll sell someday.

Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Heading Off Common 
Valuation Disasters
Thinking about the sudden death of the patriarch or matriarch of the family 
is never pleasant. But this situation happens, and it exposes all sorts of 
planning deficits.
One business owner was hit by a bus and killed when he was on vacation. 
The family members rallied to keep the business afloat for a while. Then they 
made a collective decision to sell the business; they were ready to let it go. 
The problem was timing. The overall sale process can take anywhere from 6 
to 24 months, maybe even longer. During this period, the family member who 
took the reins of the company began to suffer kidney failure — definitely a 
worst-case scenario.
This is why business founders need to link their estate, succession, and exit 
planning as part of a whole to make sure their families have a road map to 
take the business into the future. That road map should also include contin-
gency plans for the next generation. We discuss such preventive measures in 
this section.
Writing down your wishes
People write wills that reveal their deepest thoughts about where they want 
their money to go. They also write detailed plans for everything from how 
they want the children to be reared to who should run the business if some-
thing happens to the owners. Such plans may not be legally binding, but as 
long as the family respects the business owner’s written wishes, this docu-
ment is a critical guidepost for protecting the value of a business.
Here’s a sample letter:
Date [very important]
Dear Merriam, Jamie, and Bobby:
Our family business has been a joy for me to build and run. I’m proud 
that it has provided for our family so well for the past 30 years. That said, 
the business was my passion. I don’t expect it to be yours. You have 
your own dreams to pursue and your own lives to live. As a result, I have 
created the following plan to be used in the event that I die or become 
disabled. I hope that it will make the process of dealing with our family 
business easier.

191
 Chapter 13: Case Study: Valuation on the Sell Side
Management:
Day-to-day executive management should be turned over to John W. 
Smith, the company’s chief financial officer (CFO). He should assemble a 
management team made up of Roger Jones in operations and Bill Graham 
in sales. Management oversight should be provided by a board made up 
of Smith, Jones, and Marybeth Freeman.
Compensation:
John, Roger, and Bill are covered under the stay bonus plan that I put in 
place last year. Under this plan, they will continue to receive their regular 
salaries but also will receive a bonus equal to 100 percent of their base 
salaries if they stay with our company during the transition period and 
maintain the company’s financial performance. Jane Mercer has the file 
on the stay bonus plan. Ken Farmer drafted the plan and can answer any 
questions.
Disposition of the Business:
I believe that the company should be sold upon my death or disability. 
Although John, Roger, and Bill are great managers, I’m not sure that they 
have the drive or the vision needed to continue to make the company a 
success. I have had preliminary conversations with Richard Ford at ABC 
Co., an investment banking firm, about the possibility of selling the com-
pany. In 1999, ABC thought that the business might be worth approxi-
mately $10 million. I have a great deal of confidence in Richard and his 
team. Please engage them to sell the company for you. They will handle 
everything, make the process easy for you, and do a great job. Their con-
tact information is on the contact sheet attached.
Making sure that your 
records are adequate
Data has to be current any time you perform a valuation. Are the company 
books in shape so that three to five years’ worth of financial statements can 
be provided easily? What about supporting schedules and data, such as 
equipment lists, depreciation schedules, and customer lists, or a file with 
all significant leases and contracts, accounts receivable and accounts pay-
able aging, and related operational items? These documents are just a few 
examples of the host of documents that a valuation professional needs to do 
a thorough analysis, so a business owner really has to think about whether 
she’s truly prepared to begin a valuation or sale process.
 
The right amount of time varies, but if an owner is thinking about selling the 
business, the exit planning and valuation process should start three to five 
years before he plans to exit the business. This time frame provides adequate 
time for the valuation professional to collect the data, analyze the owner’s 
goals, and take her time throughout the process.

192
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Taking time to plan
When a company puts its operations in order before a sale, it keeps surprises 
down to a minimum when the company goes on the market or if an unexpected 
offer emerges. It also keeps the current owner from going for the knee-jerk 
decision when an offer appears on the table.
Planning for a sale goes well beyond sprucing up the company’s facilities 
and financials. It allows the entire management team to envision specific sale 
scenarios that are right for the company — and those that aren’t. So why 
don’t companies do more of this?
Much of the problem comes from the fact that planning for mortality or the 
sale of a company that’s become a life’s work is very hard for some people 
to talk about. Anticipating change is hard, but leaving fellow co-workers and 
family members unprepared risks a family legacy. Do everyone — including 
yourself — a huge favor, and get into the habit of planning.
Considering confidentiality
Many times, owners don’t have anywhere to turn, so they don’t complete the 
planning or decision-making process. Often, they don’t start it until they’ve 
made a definitive decision to sell, effectively putting the cart before the 
horse.
Privately held businesses are sensitive to confidentiality. Some owners never 
want anyone else to know that they’re thinking about selling. When they 
investigate the value of their companies, they’re scared that competitors will 
get wind of the investigation and use it against them. They’re concerned that 
current employees will get scared and start looking for new jobs or defecting 
to competitors. They’re concerned about how suppliers will react. You need 
to consider all the parties involved before deciding whether to keep things 
confidential.
Setting Up Your Prevaluation Plan
Valuation isn’t about waving a wand — or a paintbrush — at the time of sale 
and making a great result happen. It’s about planning, sometimes years or 
decades in advance. We like to call this type of planning prevaluation planning.
If you think that you already have a prevaluation plan, check your preparation 
by answering a few critical questions:

193
 Chapter 13: Case Study: Valuation on the Sell Side
 
✓ Have you met with an attorney or a financial planner to organize your 
personal finances? Have your spouse and other key family members who 
are involved in the business done the same?
 
✓ Do you have a will and necessary powers of attorney governing your 
health and finances?
 
✓ Do you know how much money you will need to retire?
 
✓ Do you know the wishes of your children and other family members 
regarding going into or continuing the business in case you decide to 
leave or something happens to you?
 
✓ If you were to die at 5 p.m. today, who would you want to fill your chair 
at 9 a.m. tomorrow?
 
✓ Do you have a retirement date in mind and know the kind of retirement 
you want to have?
 
✓ Do you know the current competitive landscape of your business, and 
do you have a plan to stay competitive for the short and long terms?
 
✓ Do you have qualified advisors to work with you on business, personal 
wealth, and tax issues, and do you communicate with those advisors on 
a regular basis?
 
✓ Do you have a plan in place to minimize the tax consequences of selling 
or passing on the business?
 
✓ Do you have three reasons in mind that would lead you to sell to or 
merge with another company?
 
✓ Are your current relationships with investors or lenders in good shape, 
and would they change if someone else within the company had to take 
over?
If the answer to any question was no, you don’t have a thorough prevaluation 
plan. This result isn’t a reason to panic, however; it’s a reason to plan. The 
next subsections present a template that you can use to get started.
Finding the problems
Valuation professionals who are actively involved in prevaluation planning 
make sure that their clients take the time to articulate what they want to do. 
The summary of their responses may look something like Table 13-1, which 
is a report on business owner Robert’s prevaluation planning. It identifies 
key personal and business problems that should drive the valuation planning 
process.

194
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Table 13-1 
Sample Prevaluation Plan
Personal goals
Robert wants to retire at age 59 and spend more 
time with his family. He also wants to get more 
involved in his church. He and his wife, Sallie, 
want to take at least one major cruise each year.
Personal situation analysis
Robert currently works 60 hours per week and 
has little time or energy left at the end of the 
week to enjoy his new grandchildren. He has 
always traveled for business and never had the 
time to enjoy the places he’s visited.
Business goals
Robert wants to sell his company within the next 
few years but only if he can net enough to retire 
comfortably. His children aren’t interested in run-
ning the business.
Business situation analysis
Robert’s company currently isn’t positioned to 
be an attractive sale candidate. Additional 
work needs to be done to improve its value and 
salability.
Financial goals
Robert believes that he needs approximately 
$200,000 per year after taxes to support his 
existing lifestyle and to retire comfortably.
Financial situation analysis
Robert hasn’t done any comprehensive financial 
planning. As a result, he doesn’t have a good 
idea of whether $200,000 after taxes is actually 
sufficient. In addition, Robert doesn’t know how 
much he would need to net from the sale of his 
business to generate the annual cash flow that 
he needs.
Estate goals
Robert doesn’t believe in leaving children a large 
legacy of inherited wealth. He wants to leave his 
children a small financial legacy and leave his 
grandchildren enough money to pay for their 
college and graduate-school educations.
Estate analysis
Robert and Sallie have done no formal estate 
planning other than drafting simple wills and 
trusts about five years ago. They have done no 
sophisticated planning to minimize capital gains 
or estate taxes.
This example reveals a lack of overall financial planning and the need to 
focus on two key issues:

195
 Chapter 13: Case Study: Valuation on the Sell Side
 
✓ Robert doesn’t know whether $200,000 a year is sufficient to provide his 
yearly cash-flow needs in retirement.
 
✓ He doesn’t know how much he would net if he were to sell the business 
to fund a $200,000-a-year lifestyle.
The sale of the company won’t fix these two problems automatically, because 
for now, no one knows the value of the company or what his financial needs 
will really be.
Are you starting to get a chicken-and-egg feeling? That feeling comes from 
the realization that business planning and personal finance planning really 
do have to be linked. Chapter 20 gives you considerably more detail on the 
estate planning and gifting strategies you need to consider and on the expert 
help you should enlist.
Analyzing the prevaluation
Prevaluation helps you find out whether a sale is a reasonable option to 
explore. But keep in mind that various goals change the prevaluation process. 
Prevaluation planning is different for each of the following objectives:
 
✓ Creating an estate/gifting plan for heirs
 
✓ Preparing for an outright sale of the company with no need for succession
 
✓ Creating an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP; for more information, 
read Chapter 24)
We can promise that if you do a valuation for each of these objectives, the 
conclusion is going to be different in all three cases.
In Robert’s case (see the preceding section), if he finds that he can’t net from 
the sale of the business enough to fund his retirement adequately, his time-
line for selling the business gets a lot longer. He needs to improve the value 
of the company to sell at an optimal price.
Robert’s self-analysis also uncovers conflicting goals — always a valuable dis-
covery before any actual transaction process starts and mistakes are made. 
If he needs to maximize the sale price of the company to reach his retire-
ment goals, for example, there go any plans for the kids to get the company. 
Younger family members typically don’t have the kind of money that would 
solve the entrepreneur’s financial problem. Ergo, the kids can’t buy the com-
pany because they can’t afford it, and poor Robert can’t give the company to 
them because he needs that money to retire.
See why this planning should begin more than five years in advance?

196
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
Performing the Valuation
In Chapter 4, this book gives you an idea of the three approaches to valuation 
and the various methodologies used for each approach. So although perform-
ing the math for various methodologies may be nice as an academic exercise, 
the math is what it is.
Now’s the time to manage subjectivity. Owners need to find a way to let unbi-
ased, skilled people weigh in on their plan. They need to bring in experts to 
tell a well-researched, straight story that can guide their actions. A valuation 
professional can provide that third-party objective analysis, and the business 
owner needs to come to grips with this analysis before putting the company 
up for sale. This section runs through the valuation process using Robert as a 
case study.
Taking valuation from fantasy to reality
Consider Robert from Table 13-1, earlier in the chapter. If he thinks that his 
business is worth $10 million and the net from a $10 million sale will fund his 
retirement adequately, everything is peachy. But what if Robert puts his 
company up for sale, and the highest offer is only $7 million? The net from a 
$7 million sale may still get the job done — or not.
When a business owner goes through the valuation process for a sale, he 
needs to be prepared for a realistic range of values and make every effort to 
put himself in the buyer’s shoes.
Tables 13-2 through 13-5 contain worksheet ideas that can help an owner 
evaluate various factors in detail: intangibles (see Chapter 5 for more detail), 
operating expenses, investments, and other financial details.

Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
The analysis of all these factors is where the rubber meets the road in the 
valuation process. Gross revenue is what gross revenue is; profitability is 
what profitability is. As we mention earlier in this chapter, valuation isn’t just 
the basic math; the discount and capitalization rates are eventually used to 
convert the numbers to a value that become most important.
How a company performs in relationship to other companies in its industry is 
going to speak volumes about whether the subject company is good, average, 
or great. If the company is performing at the high end of the range compared 
with other companies in this industry, this performance will influence a 
potential buyer’s perception of intangible factors related to the business.
Checking the structure of the deal
A major weakness of traditional valuation theory is that it doesn’t take deal 
structure into account. The Internal Revenue Service’s Revenue Ruling 59-60 
(we talk more about this ruling in Chapter 18) assumes that a deal is all cash 
at closing. In reality, however, hardly any deals are all cash at closing, so a 
proper valuation needs to take deal structure into consideration. In this sec-
tion, we discuss financing and tax concerns. In the next, you see how these 
concepts play out in a case study.
Financing
The first things to consider in the deal structure are how the transaction will 
be financed and how that financing will influence the timing of cash flows to 
the seller. If the company is engaged in manufacturing, distribution, or some 
other business that has significant tangible assets, a bank or some other 
lending institution may finance a greater portion of the transaction.
If the company for sale is a service business with few or no tangible assets, 
however, getting a loan for the transaction is very difficult. The buyer’s abil-
ity to get third-party financing greatly influences whether the buyer can close 
the deal.
 
Businesses that don’t have many tangible assets can’t be sold with the major-
ity of the proceeds coming in the form of cash at closing. These transactions 
typically have a lot of structure involved — that is, the money is going to come 
over time in the form of a seller note, consulting agreements, or earnouts, 
which are agreed-upon payments in case certain post-acquisition performance 
targets are reached.
Basic corporate finance relies on the time value of money: A dollar received 
today is worth more than a dollar received in the future. Therefore, if you 
agree to sell a company, the price of the company is going to be contingent 
on how much money is received now versus in the future.

201
 Chapter 13: Case Study: Valuation on the Sell Side
After-tax consequences
When a transaction is executed, you have to determine the net proceeds. 
Uncle Sam is going to get paid, and the deal structure determines what taxes 
are owed and how those taxes are calculated. One needs to consider the 
structure of the company, such as whether it’s an S corporation or a C corpo-
ration. Whether the transaction is in the form of an asset sale of a stock sale 
is also significant. Owners need to examine the assets being sold and what 
the depreciated book value of those assets is versus the fair-market value of 
those assets.
Looking at an example 
of a deal in progress
In this section, we present an example of a deal. The target company, which 
is an S corporation, is grossing approximately $33 million in revenue per 
year, with operating income of around $2.5 million. The deal is going to 
be structured as an asset sale. The major assets to be sold are inventory, 
accounts receivable, and fixed assets (office furniture, trucks, and machinery).
The company is able to negotiate a sale price of approximately $10 million, 
plus inventory. This deal is very attractive for a company this size, because 
it translates into a multiple of earnings of about five. The owners are very 
happy with the price and decide to move ahead with the transaction.
Financing considerations
When the sellers examined how they would receive their $10 million, they 
didn’t pay attention to how the deal was going to be financed. Their fixed 
assets (equipment, trucks, and machinery) were aggressively depreciated 
over time in such a way that the book value of those assets was approxi-
mately $2 million.
In determining the purchase price, the buyer stepped up the value of those 
fixed assets to an estimated fair-market value of approximately $7 million. 
Therefore, when the buyer approached the banker for a loan to fund this 
transaction, the bank was only willing to lend an amount far below the value 
of the tangible assets that would be transferred in the sale.
Combined with some cash down from the seller, the bottom line of $7 million 
would be available between the two sources as cash at closing. How do the 
parties make up the gap of the $3 million?

202
Part III: If You’re Selling a Business . . . 
The total purchase price is $10 million, but the buyer can get hold of only $7 
million cash at closing. The $3 million has to come over the course of time 
in the form of a seller note, essentially borrowing from the seller to do the 
deal. This situation doesn’t sit well with the sellers, who anticipated that they 
would receive the entire $10 million at closing.
Depending on how far along the negotiation process is, the sellers could 
renegotiate the deal and ask for more money — maybe $11 million to $12 mil-
lion. If the sale process is close to closing and they want to get a deal done, 
their hands may be tied.
 
After a letter of intent is signed and both sides have spent significant time and 
money on due diligence, renegotiating a deal can have fatal consequences. 
Therefore, the seller has to be careful that the deal doesn’t blow up days 
before a successful closing.
Tax effects
Before you get too far into the sale process, you have to analyze how the deal 
structure is going to influence the net proceeds.
The owners in this example didn’t do any pretransaction tax analysis and 
assumed that any proceeds from the sale would be taxed at a capital-gains 
rate of 20 percent. In a $10 million transaction, the tax bill would be $2 mil-
lion, so net proceeds would be $8 million. But because the company is an S 
corporation and the transaction is an asset sale, some or all of the proceeds 
(depending on the purchase price allocation of those assets) would be taxed 
at ordinary income rates of 40 percent instead of capital-gains rates of 20 per-
cent, doubling the tax hit.
This situation is another reason you need tax and valuation expertise in any 
deal you’re considering.
 
Tax consequences need to be in the forefront for any deal you do, and consid-
eration needs to start early. If you wait until the eleventh hour and then try to 
renegotiate after you find out what the tax hit will be, then you’ll most likely 
kill your deal.
Adding insult to injury, because of the way the deal was structured, the 
owners would receive only $7 million of the total purchase price at closing. 
Selling your company for $10 million and walking away with only $3 million at 
closing leaves a really, really bad taste.
The bottom line: In performing a valuation on the sell side, you can’t just do 
the numbers and call it a day. You need to consider personal objectives, the 
buyer’s ability to finance and structure the deal, and net proceeds. Make sure 
your expert advisors cover every detail.

T
he flip side of the transaction is the buy side. In this 
part, we feature a detailed case study on the purchase 
of a fictional business, showing where the buyer went 
right and wrong. We also discuss the range of investigation 
that should go into a purchase, and we even introduce 
such intensive tactics as forensic accounting.
Buying a business is all about planning and research. It’s 
not just about the business. How the business fits into 
your other business operations and, of course, your 
long-term financial plans is also important.

f you’ve ever watched smart business moguls in action, you may have 
thought they had a sixth sense about business opportunities; they pounce 
when others seem to be standing around aimlessly. But behind every great 
intuitive business mind is usually something more powerful that you don’t 
see: preparation, which is what this chapter is all about. Proper valuation is 
part of the necessary preparation that goes into any successful purchase of a 
business.
Knowing What Typically Drives 
a Business Purchase
Clearly, the dream of owning the hair salon or the boutique down the street 
motivates people to strike out on their own. Yet like most things that look 
good from street level, businesses require closer scrutiny.
 
A business transaction is a courtship. Although friendly (or unfriendly) 
strangers at the start, both sides get to know each other as the process 
moves along. Always be on the lookout for changes in the seller’s mood 
or the involvement of associates or family members in the discussions. 
(If you haven’t read Chapter 11, you may want to do so just to get a broader 
picture of how family goals — and disagreements — can affect the value of 
a business.)

206
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
If you put yourself in the place of an entrepreneur, you can find many reasons 
for wanting to buy a business:
 
✓ Career change: The urge to get away from working for the Man, the 
Woman, or the Company from Hell can be very strong. The need for 
independence has pushed more than a few worker bees over the edge 
into entrepreneurship. Seeing employed individuals use their savings or 
their corporate buyouts as seed money for new companies isn’t unusual.
 
✓ Emotion: This category is a wide one — and a sometimes-dangerous 
one at that. It contains some element of career change (the desire to 
strike out on one’s own, the need to get away from a stifling organiza-
tion, and so on) mixed with some other major human motivations, 
not all of them of the highest caliber. In some cases, people buy family 
companies to keep the company in the family — or away from other 
members of the family.
 
 Some people have a romantic notion about the kind of company in 
which they’ve always seen themselves. Sometimes, that notion is a very 
fitting reason for a person to take the leap into a particular business, 
but sometimes, it’s just a romantic notion; the entrepreneur may not be 
ready for all the challenges that await him. Buying a business based on 
emotion can result in something great — or something regrettable.
 
✓ Tax and estate issues: Tax and estate issues are complicated in their 
own right, and no particular one-size-fits-all scenario motivates someone 
to buy a business. But when family businesses pass from one generation 
to the next, an outsider may get an opportunity usually reserved for the 
insiders: the purchase of that family business.
 
✓ Continued expansion of an existing enterprise: The opportunity to 
buy a business that may be complementary to your own operations 
may be a better way to grow a business than building it organically. 
Purchasing a competitor allows a company to diffuse a threat while 
harvesting customers, product lines, and managerial talent that can 
make the combined operation considerably more valuable.
Getting Ready to Buy
You’re looking at a business that you think holds attractive value now 
and will demonstrate even greater value in the future. But how do you 
really know?
Sharp outsiders have ways to discover value that the current owners haven’t 
realized on their own, for any number of reasons. The owners may not be 
particularly brilliant businesspeople, for example, or they may not have the 
will to continue in a toughening business environment.

207
 Chapter 14: How Do You Know Whether You’re Ready to Buy?
In any event, successful buyers know the following things:
 
✓ That they have the skills to put the tangible and intangible assets of the 
business to work in new ways that will make the company even more 
successful
 
✓ That the economy is presenting favorable conditions for them to 
execute those plans
 
✓ That they’ve created the financial infrastructure in their personal and 
business lives to take advantage of any opportunities that surface
Smart buyers develop market intelligence about the best companies out 
there to buy. These buyers know a lot about the businesses they may be 
interested in, such as which founders are ready to retire and which well-run 
companies may not have the ability to expand on their own.
 
Value often comes from opportunities that no one else sees.
In this section, we talk about some challenges that buyers face, discuss how 
to determine whether a business is a good fit for you, and tell you how the 
sale process usually works.
Tackling challenges unique to buyers
Ongoing operations have several advantages. If you’re paying attention, 
you can see how long a particular company has been in operation; you can 
investigate its activities through the news media (check the clips to see how 
good business has really been); and you can go online to see whether you 
can identify regulatory problems or court actions that the business may 
have suffered.
Most information about private companies is tightly guarded and must 
be requested only by serious parties who can guarantee that they won’t 
spread the information to other outsiders. Finding the answers you need to 
make a decision is harder when you’re looking at private companies. When 
you’re considering buying a successful ongoing business or one that’s 
in trouble, however, you can apply most principles to public and private 
companies alike.
Unlike people selling houses, business owners don’t always announce their 
intentions to sell in a public way. How many times have you seen a for-sale 
sign in the window of a local business? Unlike a house, a business may 
consist of the business itself, the building it lives in, and every piece of 
machinery and stick of furniture in it — or it may simply consist of two

guys in a dorm room designing a search engine that takes over the world. 
(By the way, we just told you two things: how Google was founded and how 
idea-based companies with no visible assets can turn into something very 
big indeed!)
But most people who are looking to buy a conventional business with an 
address and equipment have to deal with the following issues:
 
✓ Lack of listings: No central repository of business-for-sale information is 
available, save for independent listings by business brokers or indepen-
dent businesspeople who advertise in newspapers or online.
 
 There are plenty of easy ways to find businesses for sale — companies 
even put themselves up for sale on Craigslist these days — but no 
matter where you pick up information on a company, do your due 
diligence (see “Step 4: Practice due diligence,” later in this chapter). 
Never trust anything you read until you’ve checked it out or enlisted 
experienced help to investigate.
 
✓ Competition: For the best businesses out there, prospective buyers 
are usually in line before you — people who’ve already thought about 
swooping in whenever the owners get weary of the operation.
 
✓ Lack of financial data: Private companies don’t have to make their 
financials public, so it’s impossible to find much data until you’ve 
identified yourself as a serious prospect. You may have to put up 
a few thousand dollars in earnest money before you can do your due 
diligence.
 
✓ Owner emotions: Because a private company may represent a senti-
mental spot in the heart of its present owner (even if she’s absolutely 
terrible at running the business), the buyer may be dealing not only with 
numbers and business forecasts but also with some raw emotion.
 
✓ Lack of useful benchmarks: Benchmarks tend to be very general if they 
exist at all.
Looking at whether the business 
is right for you
Plenty of successful entrepreneurs started their empires with a simple 
conversation with the proprietor of a business they frequented who just 
happened to mention that he was hoping to sell the business in a couple of 
years and retire. Such conversations are serendipitous, to be sure, but even 
in those situations, getting from dating to mating takes time.

209
 Chapter 14: How Do You Know Whether You’re Ready to Buy?
Here are the key steps for getting to the finish line the right way:
 
1. Before you analyze the business, analyze yourself.
 
 Maybe the idea just fell into your lap. That “eureka!” idea makes running 
a business seem like a happy dream — and a doable one. But you need 
to ask yourself some pointed questions about whether you’re ready for 
the often-draining responsibilities of running a business. (Feel free to 
wander back to Chapter 2 for the questionnaire for fledgling business 
owners.)
 
2. Look past the window dressing.
 
 When a company puts itself up for sale, it does a lot of the same things 
you do when you’re trying to sell a house or car: clean it up, add a coat 
of paint to cover flaws, and so on, in the hope that prospective buyers 
will get a more favorable view of the company. This isn’t wrong. Just 
don’t let surface improvements keep you from closely examining the 
numbers and detailed characteristics of the business.
 
3. Research the business.
 
 Under your own steam or with the help of experts, find out what you can 
about your target company on the Internet, at the public library, or 
through local business organizations. Then go wider. Consult valuation 
databases and publications to get an idea of rule-of-thumb valuations for 
common businesses in that category — keeping in mind that you’re 
looking at guidelines, not final offering prices (see Chapter 9 for more on 
rules of thumb). You have plenty to do yet.
 
 Doing initial valuation research on your own is important because even 
if you don’t find out a lot, you’ll be in a much better position to speak 
with experts about how they can help you. Also, if a business you 
thought you could afford looks as though it could be wildly beyond your 
means and risk tolerance, you want to know that before you start paying 
real money for advice.
Evaluating a failing business
If you’ve been doing your street-level homework, you may notice when a 
business you’re interested in has fewer customers or keeps shorter hours. 
You may also see that some familiar employees aren’t there anymore or that 
the owner isn’t paying as much attention to matters as she once did.
If tough economic times seem to be affecting the company, here’s some initial 
research you should do from a macro perspective:

210
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
✓ Determine whether the business is failing because of the industry or 
the operation. Do some research on the fortunes of the industry that the 
business is in; if its product is going the way of the dodo, that may be 
the reason the business is failing.
 
 Example: As we write this book, many U.S. newspapers are losing 
circulation and cutting staff. Although some new owners are trying to 
make their operations work more efficiently — making more staff cuts, 
realigning delivery routes, and so on — many experts wonder whether 
print is going out of style.
 
✓ Look at the economy. If the economy is great but the business is failing, 
the reasons for its failure may be internal — and fixable. If the economy 
is wiping out an established company, you may want to understand why 
it’s dying now instead of in earlier tough times it faced.
 
 Example: Fuel prices are a significant factor for any business that 
depends on vehicles to deliver a product or service, whether it’s an 
airline or a produce company. If energy costs are killing a company, 
you have a good opening to research ways to make the company 
operate more efficiently by outsourcing some or all of its transportation 
functions or to figure out ways to buy fuel more efficiently.
 
✓ Evaluate the competition. Whenever you look at a business, you need to 
fully view its competition to see whether newcomers are entering the 
market or whether the existing competition is doing something different. 
Also, you can’t forget to evaluate how your competition operates on 
the Internet.
 
 Example: If a local bookstore has a monopoly on college textbook sales 
but is losing money on consumer bestsellers, should it really be selling 
consumer books?
 
✓ Consider labor costs. If a company is wedded to local employment, that 
may be noble, but as a prospective owner, you should ask whether — 
based on current economic conditions and the labor costs of its closest 
competitors — the company could conceivably make more money by 
outsourcing or offshoring its labor costs.
 
 Example: Many companies (your potential competitors) are outsourcing 
their customer service operations to domestic or overseas call centers. 
Could that turn things around if you owned the company?
 
✓ See whether marketing and advertising failed the company. Find out 
whether customers have gone elsewhere because the business failed to 
keep them interested.
 
 Example: An analysis of current customer lists can reveal whether the 
company kept good leads in the loop or failed to reevaluate its customer 
list over the years.

211
 Chapter 14: How Do You Know Whether You’re Ready to Buy?
 
✓ Look at the real estate and the hard assets of this business. Is the 
business a manufacturing company that hasn’t updated its equipment? 
You need to determine whether cash needs are preventing the company 
from upgrading its overall technology. Ask whether a company needs 
to own the real estate or manufacturing equipment it has; leasing or 
outsourcing may be a better option.
 
 Example: If a company has clearly not updated its manufacturing equip-
ment in line with current industry standards, determine whether it has 
held off due to financial constraints or whether some manufacturing 
alternatives might allow a new owner to dispense with that part of the 
business altogether.
Understanding how the mating 
process (typically) works
You’ve found a company. You’ve talked to your family members, your 
closest friends, your banker, your financial planner, your tax professional, 
and your attorney; maybe you’ve even placed an early call to a valuation 
specialist. You’ve shown everyone your own personal research — including 
some initial, general valuation information — and nobody’s told you that 
you’re completely nuts.
So what are the next steps? Read on.
 
Always respect confidentiality when seeking to buy a business. Anyone 
who’s ever spent time around an office water cooler knows how quickly 
rumors spread. When management and staff members start hearing that their 
employer may be putting the business on the block, regular office productivity 
screeches to a halt in favor of time spent trading gossip and updating 
résumés. Depending on how big or interesting the prospective buyer and 
seller are, the news media may want to get a whiff of what’s going on as well. 
Make sure that all conversations, meetings, and correspondence are con-
ducted with privacy and respect.
Step 1: Find the best way to approach the seller
Depending on the kind of business it is and where it stands in its life cycle, 
approaching the proprietor isn’t always a matter of knocking on his door and 
saying, “Have I got a deal for you!” Your research should include details on 
when to make the overture and who the best first contact should be.
Stick to a simple concept: Know your audience. Buying a multigenerational 
family firm involves a different overture process from buying a franchised 
doughnut shop or the corner convenience store run by that nice old lady in 
the neighborhood.

212
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
Plan the meeting and the way you’ll formally express your interest. Do you 
have to write a query letter to a home office somewhere, or can you simply 
ask the owner out for a cup of coffee and begin to see where she stands on 
the issue of selling her company? Do you need an intermediary to arrange a 
formal meeting on neutral turf? First impressions do matter.
 
Be tactful, particularly about numbers. The early stages of meet-and-greet 
usually aren’t the time to talk price. Save that discussion for later, when you’re 
conducting due diligence and negotiating a deal.
Step 2: Find out how the seller will be represented
Wouldn’t it be great if you knew each other and the scope of the business 
well enough to write a deal on a napkin, shake hands, and pass the check? 
Yes, it would be, but that scenario is largely the stuff of Hollywood movies. 
Most deals aren’t struck that way, largely because they shouldn’t be.
You need a legally binding deal that’s responsibly negotiated on both sides. 
Find out whether the seller is going to be aided by an attorney, a business 
broker, or some other intermediary and whether your representation is equal 
to the discussion.
 
When in doubt, check it out — a seller may say that she’s working with a 
Certified Public Account, a licensed attorney, or a certified valuation profes-
sional to help do the deal, but don’t take that statement at face value. 
Always quietly investigate the qualifications of the people who are working 
for the other side. Experience and professionalism on both sides don’t 
always guarantee a smooth business transition, but they definitely increase 
the chance of one.
Step 3: Set up a tour
Confidentiality rules the entire process, but as you proceed, you’ll want 
to tour the facility, perhaps with a valuation professional or other advisors 
in tow. This tour can be very informal or formal and may happen several 
times, depending on the business and on how the parties want to gather 
information.
If the target company creates a product that could be susceptible to corpo-
rate espionage, don’t expect to wander up to the receptionist without an 
appointment and ask when the plant tour begins. In many situations, before a 
company owner even decides to let you in the lobby, he’s going to want to 
know that you’re a serious suitor. You may have to have many conversations 
with the owner to establish your interest, and at very least, you’ll have to 
sign a confidentiality agreement (which your attorney should review before 
you sign). See Chapter 12 for a sample confidentiality agreement.

213
 Chapter 14: How Do You Know Whether You’re Ready to Buy?
Step 4: Practice due diligence
This part of the process is where paper starts crossing the table, as each 
side starts to see the other’s crucial financial information and other data. 
You’re looking not just at performance numbers but also at the company’s 
culture, its tax history (which you probably haven’t seen until now), and its 
compensation structure. The rough outlines of pricing demands on both 
sides start taking shape at this stage.
 
Due diligence costs money, so try to estimate these costs in advance the best 
you can. You may be paying hourly fees to bring accountants, attorneys, or 
valuation professionals onsite to do the required investigation. Reviewing 
documents, creating reports, and gathering data mean one thing: The meter’s 
running.
Because the formal due-diligence process clears you to start talking to land-
lords, bankers, suppliers, employees, and customers, the seller may require 
earnest money at this point to show that you’re serious about the process. 
A separate earnest-money agreement may be necessary if real estate is 
included in the potential sale. Make sure that you understand not only what 
you’re going to have to pay but also what this amount covers and what you’ll 
be allowed to investigate during the due-diligence process. If you’re paying 
for the right to look at a company’s numbers and additional time to make a 
proposal, for example, make sure that you’re getting your money’s worth.
For most small to mid-size businesses, earnest money of $5,000 to $10,000 is 
typical. How long does the earnest money period last? Typically, companies 
have between 7 and 30 days to complete due diligence and decide whether to 
go ahead with the deal.
Step 5: Move on to a deal
You’ve popped the question, and you’ve forked over the ring, better known 
as your initial offer. Based on your due diligence and advice on valuation, you 
should be prepared for some negotiation, but ideally, both sides have shared 
enough information that they won’t be far apart if they really want to do the 
deal (see Chapter 15 for more on negotiating). Assuming that both parties 
reach a final number at this stage, a bill of sale is prepared and a closing date 
is scheduled.
Restarting the Value Process
When you get the keys to the business, you start the process of evaluating 
staff and operations as an owner — a completely different ballgame from 
due diligence. When your head stops spinning and you get a real handle on 

214
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
what you have, it’s time to reset the company’s strategic plan to address 
your own valuation goals and targets. Whether you’ve purchased a high-
quality ongoing business or a turnaround company, creating a strategic plan 
for the next three to five years can help you focus on growth, profitability, 
and your long-term plans for the value that this business will achieve.
 
Whether you’re the mission-statement type or simply a person who likes to sit 
down and talk to your employees (even if you’ve bought a business with only 
one or two people working the counter), get your employees thinking about 
what it will mean for them if you reach your targets for increasing the value of 
the business. Building in affordable incentives for your people over time may 
not hurt either; if you grow to plan, you’ll be doing more hiring, and better 
benefits and bonuses tend to attract the best people over time.
 
When you acquire your first business — or absorb the second or third in a 
string of transactions — you’ve changed the competitive landscape of a 
local business community and maybe even the industry in which you operate. 
That means a whole new round of studying and information-gathering. No 
matter what point you’re at in your business, the valuation process never 
really stops. Experienced businesspeople know that business is a process of 
reeducation every day.
The valuation process of buying a business should give you an in-depth 
understanding of the business you’re in or entering, and you should keep all 
those valuation principles in mind while you keep your mind open for the 
next opportunity. After a transaction is done, staying in business means 
learning about business practices and procedures that will improve the value 
of the business over time. Here are some ideas:
 
✓ Join an industry networking group. Making yourself and your 
business known in an industry organization allows you to learn about 
competitors who may become potential partners.
 
✓ Keep close ties with lenders. Always be ready to borrow even if you’re 
not planning to borrow anytime soon. It’s good to keep financials 
current and the condition of the business in good standing. Stay in touch 
with the banking community.

E
veryone negotiates. People negotiate with family and friends to get 
things done — or done on their behalf. People negotiate with employees 
to get better performance from them. And people negotiate with landscapers, 
car dealers, pet groomers . . . you get the idea. But if you have a valuation 
based on dishonest or random data and operational practices, what are 
negotiation skills worth in a business context?
You could fill a warehouse with books on negotiation — how to do it, how 
not to do it, how negotiations work in various industries, how to negotiate 
through attorneys and other representatives, and on and on.
In this chapter, not only do we go over key points in business negotiation, 
but we also discuss a topic that we think is even more important: the quality 
of information that guides a negotiation strategy (information that you 
generate or that the target company generates for you). When you’re valuing 
a company, getting quality information is the first important step that directs 
all your negotiations involving that business.
 
No absolute law says that you have to buy a business when you find an 
attractive company worth owning or sell it when an offer lands unannounced 
on your doorstep — though you should be prepared for anything. Negotiation 
is a frustrating, enlightening, and extremely educational part of being in 
business.

Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
Knowing What Valuation Does 
for the Dealmaking Process
Legendary business guru Peter Drucker once said, “Erroneous assumptions 
can be disastrous.” That statement is a fitting description of any situation in 
which the buyer or seller doesn’t rely on a detailed valuation process before 
starting negotiations.
 
You don’t have to have an offer on the table for valuation to make sense — it 
can educate and can guide you when a deal comes. Valuation is relevant 
in a pre-deal situation — when a business owner is mulling over a sale of her 
company, or when she’s making succession or estate plans, or when she’s 
hoping to seek venture capital financing down the line.
Identifying potential pitfalls 
and opportunities
Valuation allows a potential seller to discover pockets of hidden value and 
potholes of trouble that can sink a deal. An early, independent valuation 
process can unearth the following information:
 
✓ The quality of assets inside the company: Many owners think what 
their companies own and do are significantly more valuable than a 
buyer or a valuation professional would think. The opposite occurs in 
some situations, too.
 
✓ Lackluster accounting methods: A savvy buyer or his valuation profes-
sional won’t take long to spot holes in financial logic that draw more 
scrutiny or a move away from the negotiating table. If numbers and 
processes can be clarified, the seller needs to know the situation and fix 
the problems before negotiation takes place.
Timing the purchase well
Valuation can help you determine the best time to move on a sale, a manage-
ment succession, or an application for financing or investors.
Timing is one of the most important factors in the valuation process. If 
you’re in control of the timing, you may also be in control of the volume of 
information required to reach your goal.

217
 Chapter 15: Moving from Valuation to Negotiation
Minimizing emotional shocks
One of the most beneficial aspects of presale valuation is that it allows 
owners to get an exact picture of their circumstances — not only so they can 
improve operations and results before a sale but also so they can adjust to 
the emotional reality that the business may not be what they thought it was.
Valuation allows sellers to wring emotions out of the process before they 
face buyers or other family members. It allows negotiations to focus strictly 
on business and not on conflict, which actually costs money.
Getting Ready to Meet the Seller
You’ve certainly heard the phrase “garbage in, garbage out.” Whether you’re 
conducting an internal valuation for informational purposes before you sell 
your company or are valuing a target company for the purpose of buying it or 
investing in it, quality, depth, and purity of information are everything.
What you find during the valuation process not only identifies the value of 
the company but also moves the negotiating process toward the conclusion 
of a deal — or doesn’t. This fact is why we talk about setting standards for 
the quality of information within your organization as you approach certain 
milestones: a possible sale, the transfer of a business to family members or 
associates, a public offering, or preparation to borrow from a lender.
Everything you do in the valuation process — and we mean everything — 
either speeds or impedes your ability to negotiate for your goal.
Using failure as a great teacher
If, in your heart, you’re the engineering or 
design guru of your business, you’ll eventually 
have to master the finance or sales side of 
the business, too; otherwise, you may miss 
problems day to day.
You won’t be perfect at negotiation — at least, 
not at first. Negotiation skills evolve over time. 
So when do you find out how to negotiate? 
Every day, while you’re running your business. 
Remember: Everything that happens today may 
be valuable in a future negotiation.
People may tell you that if a particular deal 
doesn’t work out, another will be around 
the corner. The economy and the state of 
your industry play big roles in determining 
whether that’s true — but so do you. Use any 
negotiations with outsiders to build an ongoing 
discussion about value in your business.

218
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
Recognizing window dressing
We mention the concept of window dressing to describe the process that 
some companies go through when they prepare to sell. Physical window 
dressing is pretty much what you’d think — a fresh coat of paint on the walls 
and a general sprucing up of the premises to entice buyers. Home sellers do 
the same thing.
A company does financial window dressing to make numbers look better than 
they are, based on what a company wants to show. A company that wants to 
sell may engage in the following types of financial window dressing:
 
✓ Delay spending on employee training so that expenses in the current 
year (the year potential buyers may be looking at the books) are lower.
 
✓ Extend its terms for uncollectible accounts receivable so that it doesn’t 
have to be as aggressive about reporting bad debt.
 
✓ Complete a sale/leaseback deal on some equipment before the end of 
the year, allowing the company to feature the proceeds on its balance 
sheet for the current year and then lease back the equipment the 
following year.
None of these activities is illegal, but manipulating the timing of certain 
spending decisions can definitely have an impact on a company’s numbers. 
For this reason, you need someone who can spot the difference between 
asset levels driven by the normal course of business and those driven by 
accounting sleight of hand.
Remembering motives
Understanding motive isn’t just for cops. Motive is critical for any negotia-
tion, and you need to understand not just your own motivations in the 
process but also the motivations of the person on the other side of the table.
Here are the primary motivations in the business-sale process:
 
✓ Financial: If the company’s wealth and the owner’s wealth are inter-
twined, as in most small companies, the seller’s personal financial goals 
are important motivations.
 
✓ Personal: How dedicated both sides are to the continuation of the 
business is another important motivation. The seller may finally be 
ready to hang it up, but you, the prospective buyer, may be new to the 
industry or eager to enhance the value of your operation with hers.
 
✓ Emotional: Emotional issues can drive the need for a valuation. The 
founder may have died, for example, and the kids are unprepared 
or unwilling to take over where Dad left off, or they’re quarrelling about 
what to do with the business.

219
 Chapter 15: Moving from Valuation to Negotiation
 
✓ Timing-related: Timing can be a big motivation. Perhaps an entrepre-
neur realizes she’ll have to introduce massive research and develop-
ment (R&D) spending if she hangs onto the business another year, and 
you realize that you’ll lose a competitive advantage if you don’t pick up 
her key product line.
Knowing what sellers want
When listing what sellers want, a buyer is a good start. But selling a business 
isn’t just about having someone show up with a check. Sellers also want 
buyers who fit their specific needs. For instance
 
✓ They may want to make sure that certain key employees — themselves 
included — stay with the company for a certain period after the 
purchase.
 
✓ They may want certain product formulations and trademarks to 
continue after a new buyer takes over.
 
✓ They may want noncompete clauses and other limitations on their 
future ventures to be short term rather than long term.
Let’s Make a Deal: Negotiating
Anyone who thinks you can keep emotion and personality issues out of the 
negotiation process doesn’t have a clue about how business or human 
communication really works.
We start this chapter by mentioning the quality and transparency of informa-
tion for two reasons: Getting good, transparent information is good business 
practice generally, and it gives you enough certainty to keep discussions 
rational and on point. Reliable information from both sides can speed the 
negotiating process and diffuse disagreements that come from too many 
unanswered questions.
Deciding whether to handle 
negotiations yourself
This book isn’t about negotiation — for that topic, you can check out 
Negotiating For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Michael C. Donaldson and David 
Frohnmayer (Wiley) — but negotiation is a critical aspect. Can you do 
it yourself?

220
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
All the time, small-business people assert that they don’t have to take on a 
phalanx of experts to help them negotiate a price for a company. In some 
cases, this really may be true. Some people are born negotiators, and they 
have the skills to come out ahead in any deal talks. But we argue that any 
negotiation is as good as the information behind the negotiator — and 
in the case of a purchase of a business, that means having solid valuation 
information.
 
There’s no one single valuation amount for a business. Although the informa-
tion that goes into a valuation has to be accurate, so much of the process 
is analytical and subjective. That’s why you may see five different valuation 
professionals come up with five different prices for the same asset or the same 
business.
But in general terms, all buyers should realize that the final price ultimately 
depends on how quickly the seller wants to sell and how badly the buyer 
wants to purchase the business. The greater the incentive the owner has to 
sell, the further below the asking price she’s likely go. By the same logic, 
however, the more you want to buy the business, the faster you’ll want to get 
the deal done (and you’ll probably pay a higher price as a result).
Getting ready to negotiate
Even though sellers may have a longer time than buyers to prepare for a 
deal, it makes sense for buyers to set their parameters well before they 
find a target. Here are some thoughts on how to be ready for the negotiation 
process:
 
1. Think about the best-case scenario of the way you want a negotiation 
to end.
 
 Develop a profile of the kind of business you want to buy, the way 
you’d want a deal structured, and the financial terms that would make 
the best sense for your business and personal life. Start talking to 
estate planners, your family, and your business and tax attorneys about 
scenarios that make sense for you.
 
2. Start networking.
 
 Good relationships can lead to efficient deal making, so get to know 
officials of target companies casually. Based on your particular objective 
in a deal — finding a business inside your industry or outside — you 
may want to get involved in local or national business organizations to 
meet executives from other companies to boost your knowledge of what 
possibilities may be out there.

221
 Chapter 15: Moving from Valuation to Negotiation
 
3. If there’s interest, meet.
 
 Meetings between potential business partners can be as formal or 
informal as necessary. Never pass up a chance to make a useful 
contact. You may be buying that person’s company someday, and good, 
long-term relationships can make that process easier.
 
4. Be prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement.
 
 In most business negotiations large and small, the step before kicking 
the tires is signing the piece of paper that says, “I shall not tell anyone 
that I kicked your tires.” Confidentiality agreements are a necessary 
step before a company will open its books to you, or for that matter, its 
data or facilities to your inspection.
 
 How you write the confidentiality agreement is up to you and your 
lawyers, but generally, if talks break off or the deal doesn’t go through 
in the final moments for any reason, that agreement is your insurance. 
(See Chapter 12 for a sample confidentiality agreement.)
 
5. Prepare the list of everything you want to see.
 
 You should present the target company with an organized, comprehen-
sive list of all the information you’ll need to make a purchase decision 
(which is one reason to talk to your team of experts before the due 
diligence process begins). Asking questions in dribs and drabs makes 
you look like an amateur — follow-ups to major issues are okay, but 
make sure you make all major requests together.
 
 You’ll ask for comprehensive (and hopefully audited) financials, of 
course, but you’ll also want the target company’s recent tax returns, 
contracts from top revenue-producing clients, and any records from 
current or past legal proceedings. Be very aware of any hesitation in 
sharing information.
 
 Tempers may flare during the negotiating process over matters large 
and small. Your executives may feel that they’re being asked questions 
that go beyond the bounds of what should be disclosed about the 
company. An accountant who rubs everyone the wrong way may come 
onsite. And when so much money is at stake, there’s stress. When things 
get heated, remember not to take too much personally.
 
6. Get to know the facility.
 
 Either you or your representatives — and particularly your valuation 
professionals — need to spend quality time at your target’s facility. How 
do you really get an idea of valuation without actually looking at the 
facility, its offices, its machinery, its buildings, and heck, even the way 
people work together?

222
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
7. Do the valuation.
 
 You, your valuation expert, or both of you together should execute the 
valuation based on all your data and arrive at a price range for the 
business. Before you present your offer, put in place the elements to pay 
for it — cash, debt, or a note that you’ll offer to the seller.
 
8. Start negotiating.
 
 Negotiations get more intense as you offer contract language for the 
seller’s review. Unless the buyer has offered you everything you had in 
mind in Step 1, you come back with your response and request changes 
based on your conclusions and those of your advisors.
 
9. Do a final walk-through.
 
 Before you sign the final papers, the buyer and seller usually do a final 
walk-through of the business with a final inventory count of assets 
agreed to in the sale. Settle any remaining problems in the deal then, or 
the deal may go sour at the last minute.
Understanding what you 
should do in negotiation
You can load your arms with varying titles on negotiation the next time you 
go to the bookstore, but for now, here are general guidelines for keeping a 
negotiation calm, informative, and efficient:
 
✓ Don’t talk; listen. You’re going to have to talk at some point, of course; 
we’re not suggesting a vow of silence. But the real discovery experience 
in a business negotiation comes from what you hear, not from what you 
say. You should take the time to listen to
 
• A target company’s key employees, particularly the chief financial 
officer if the company has one
 
• Your family, because your goals for your business affect them 
directly
 
• Your advisors — your business and tax attorneys as well as any 
financial-planning experts you work with on a regular basis
 
✓ Respect confidentiality. If you’ve been successful in business, you 
ideally know how to guard information as well as use it. As you gather 
information, make sure that everyone you speak with understands your 
need for discretion. Don’t be a blabbermouth about what’s going on, 
and tell the members of your inner circle to be responsible about any 
information you discuss with them.

223
 Chapter 15: Moving from Valuation to Negotiation
 
✓ Keep an open mind. Potential sellers come to the table with agendas 
that may seem at the outset to be very different from your own. If 
these agendas seem as different on Day 30 as on Day 1, you may have a 
problem, but you should always try to understand what a potential 
target is thinking and what her immediate concerns may be (refer to 
“Remembering motives,” earlier in this chapter).
 
 Even if talks don’t lead to a deal, negotiation puts you in a considerably 
stronger position to understand your business and the competitive 
environment it lives in. No matter how firmly you believe that your way 
of running a business is the best way, an open mind is far more valuable 
than a take-it-or-leave-it mindset.
 
✓ Watch behavior as closely as words. The essence of negotiation is 
in understanding how a customer, employee, supplier, or potential 
business partner behaves and how that behavior leads to specific 
actions. Buyers and sellers each want things that the other side has, 
and manipulation is part of the game. But is this manipulation the kind 
that goes on in the normal course of everyday business or a dangerous 
kind that may lead you to give up more than you’d choose to?
 
 You may be dealing with a complete stranger or with someone you’ve 
known for 30 years, but if you’ve never negotiated with this person 
before, you need to watch whether he behaves with openness or 
with stealth. Problems with integrity can kill not only a deal but also 
a relationship.
Working with someone who’s 
negotiating for you
The size of the business, the complexity of the potential deal, and your per-
sonal preferences affect who you bring in to advocate for you in the purchase 
of the business. Here are some of the experts who may help you negotiate:
 
✓ Attorneys: Consult the lawyers you deal with in the regular course of 
your business and personal life about their thoughts on the best way for 
you to approach a business purchase. The best sudden-offer scenario is 
one you get after you’ve already consulted trusted advisors who give 
you a battle plan.
 
 Even the simplest business acquisitions have complicated contracts. 
The average business-purchase agreement has dozens of clauses to be 
negotiated beyond price, down payment, and ongoing terms. Other 
topics of discussion include noncompete clauses (which may last for 
several years after a deal is closed), lease assignments (the transfer of 
payment details on all leases from the seller to the buyer), inspections, 
adjustments, employee matters, and anything else that crops up as a 
feature of this individual deal. Tax, estate, and business attorneys you 
work with form an ad hoc team of advisors you may see based on need.

224
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
✓ Your officers: If you run a company large enough to have a dedicated 
chief financial officer and other executives in legal and operating posts, 
you hopefully brought trust into the picture when you hired them. Keep 
them in the loop on your plans for purchasing a new company and use 
them as conduits to ferret out information on potential targets.
 
✓ Your valuation professional/professional intermediary: An attorney 
may be a valuable negotiator for the right company, but attorneys don’t 
always have significant training and experience in business valuation. 
The good ones will tell you when they don’t, and often, they’ll have such 
valuation experts in their Rolodex.
 
 Here are two reasons to use an intermediary:
 
• Intermediaries can be the good cop or the bad cop in a valuation 
assignment, which may allow the buyer and seller to maintain a 
more cordial relationship. For example, if a deal-breaking situation 
comes up in the valuation, instead of your saying, “No way,” your 
intermediary can say something more diplomatic: “I know this 
issue here isn’t in the best interest of my client, and I’d be violating 
my duty to her if I suggested it.”
 
• Just having someone who does deals for a living can pay off 
because based on his financial knowledge, the intermediary can 
spot different ways to do a deal before attorneys or accountants 
step in. Intermediaries can do drafts of letters of intent that the 
company attorney can review prior to closing date. If you’re 
paying the cost of an intermediary already, having him do these 
intermediary steps before other hourly professionals come into 
the process can save significant dollars and time.
See Chapter 7 for more on all the professionals who can help you with the 
valuation process.
 
You can’t abdicate all responsibility for negotiating the deal to your experts. 
Their job is to advise and protect you — nothing more. You should viscerally 
understand every aspect of the deal before you sign. You have to know 
whether a change in Clause 15 or Clause 45 would turn out to sour the deal. 
Nobody knows your goals better than you do, and nobody is in a better 
position to decide whether the business you’re examining is right for you.

Chapter 16
Due Diligence on the Buy Side
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing why buyers have to do due diligence
▶ Preparing a due diligence plan
▶ Gathering information on the target company
▶ Researching the industry
I
n this chapter, we cover the preparation and study that buyers should 
do in advance of a deal — the flipside of Chapter 12, which discusses 
due diligence for sellers. In truth, both sides should do about the same 
preparation. However, this chapter focuses on the skills and tasks you need 
to make a complete valuation of a business as a buyer.
Seeing What Due Diligence 
Means in Practice
Due diligence is the process of thoroughly investigating a business, from the 
quality of its facilities to the quality of its customers, its brand identity, and 
most importantly, its numbers. Due diligence happens when you approach a 
seller and ask for permission to view the company’s operations before you 
make an offer for the company. The process almost certainly involves signing 
a confidentiality agreement.
For a prospective buyer, the process determines the following things:
 
✓ The quality of the company’s overall financial reporting: When you’re 
actually allowed to see numbers, it pays to have expert help ensure that 
the data is in order. In some cases, you may want to involve a forensic 
accountant in the search for errant financial information. (For a look at 
what forensic accountants do, turn to Chapter 17.)

226
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
✓ The current value of all the company’s assets, both tangible and 
intangible: Valuation professionals who are familiar with your industry 
will have a good idea of how to price the target company’s assets.
 
✓ The existence of any ugly secrets: Lawsuits waiting to happen, 
employee problems, regulatory hang-ups, and similar issues need to 
be investigated both inside and outside the company. Sometimes 
you get wind of legal hassles through news stories. At other times, it’s 
worth wearing out shoe leather and cellphone batteries to talk with area 
regulators and licensing agents, just to make sure that the business’s 
operations are in proper shape.
 
✓ How the company’s physical operations are maintained: Plenty of 
companies spruce up before a sale, and that’s great. But you need 
to look past the new coat of paint to find out whether the expensive 
equipment and machinery that you’re acquiring in a deal are in good 
operation or ready for the junkyard.
 
✓ The quality of the workforce: When you buy a business, you may be 
buying its human capital. Due diligence should give you an idea of the 
quality of the top management at a firm; this information should help 
you decide whether to create incentives to keep these people in place or 
incentives to get them to go.
 
✓ The investment required to maintain and grow the business over 
time: You’ll always find operational surprises after you take over any 
company, but the due-diligence process should give you a good idea 
of what investment and cash-flow standards you’ll need going into the 
business on Day 1 of ownership.
 
✓ The best time to act: Good timing comes from an intimate knowledge 
of how a business works, and that involves continuing education. 
When you’re buying a company, you have to weigh whether now is the 
time to enter the marketplace with your kind of mousetrap. You need 
to see what capital you have to invest or may need to borrow. You 
also may need to start thinking about additional investors to come in 
with you at the start. Furthermore, you have to look at the quality of 
competing products in the marketplace, the overall economy, and the 
economy of the specific industry you’re considering. Then you have to 
decide whether to jump in at this point in the business cycle or wait a 
little while.
Looking at the Unofficial First 
Stages of Due Diligence
Due diligence commonly refers to the process whereby a target company lets 
you see its financial data and allows you to come inside to kick the tires, so 
to speak. But if more buyers were to make this process broader by looking at 
valuation from the start, we believe fewer businesses would fail.

227
 Chapter 16: Due Diligence on the Buy Side
In this section, we talk about the unofficial but necessary first stage of due 
diligence in a purchase situation: researching a company before you approach 
the owner to make a deal. We also talk about getting some assistance, 
because bringing in help confidentially at this stage may be a good idea.
Researching the company
For potential buyers, the due diligence process should start with fully 
researching the business, its industry, and the economic outlook for the 
business. As a potential buyer, you owe it to yourself not only to study the 
target company but also to do the following:
 
✓ Read everything possible about the company and the industry in which 
it operates.
 
✓ Look over rule-of-thumb valuation data (see Chapter 9) as a starting 
point for pricing data.
 
✓ Check the success of the company’s product mix.
 
✓ Assess your capability to finance and manage the company.
 
✓ Consider the cost of replacing management and staff members, if 
necessary, after the purchase.
 
✓ Get a better idea of the company’s competition and customer response 
through outside intelligence.
 
✓ Review the quality of the business’s marketing and advertising.
 
✓ Interview valuation professionals who may be able to assist you in the 
purchase process (see the next section).
Asking for info: Due diligence production
Due diligence production (also known as a due 
diligence request) is the formal name for what 
you’re doing: asking for information.
Standard due diligence production includes 
requests for incorporation documents, corpo-
rate bylaws, minutes of board and shareholder 
meetings, employee organizational charts, 
capitalization tables, shareholder lists, option-
holder lists, litigation information, regulatory 
compliance documents, security filings, 
employee contracts and information, nondis-
closure and noncompetition agreements, 
property and equipment leases, asset lists, 
intellectual property information, financing 
information, tax filings and returns, and all other 
material contracts. Whew!
The list of documents varies by the kind of com-
pany, but if you get permission to come inside, 
the company should give you what you request 
pretty much immediately. If it can’t, raise an 
eyebrow. Either the business isn’t very well 
organized (a sign of poor management), or the 
owner is trying to hide something (a sign that 
you may want to walk away).

228
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
The financing environment for businesses is a critical factor in planning the 
purchase of a company. Even if you’re able to self-finance the purchase, 
you may need credit to acquire operating capital later. Establishing financing 
relationships is an important preparatory step in buying any business.
Consulting your family and the pros
In big and small businesses alike, you need to know your capacity for 
handling the management and financial responsibilities of business 
ownership. Finding out how prepared you are for this big lifestyle and 
career change isn’t something you should do in a vacuum.
Here are some of the people you may want to consult before you start the 
process of buying a company:
 
✓ Your family: You need to consult your spouse and your kids about 
how this major decision will affect the family’s lifestyle and finances. 
Business really is personal when you’re starting or buying a company. 
Family finances almost always change when one spouse or another 
(sometimes both!) decides to go into business.
 
✓ A certified financial planner: Anyone who considers purchasing an 
existing business without examining his personal debt, savings, and 
investment situation is courting trouble. A visit to a certified financial 
planner who works with independent businesspeople may be a good 
first step in this process.
 
✓ Your tax professional: Few people realize the impact of entrepreneur-
ship on their personal tax situations. Make time to discuss your plans 
with your Certified Public Accountant (CPA), and consider the advice 
you’re given as part of the business-planning process. Your personal tax 
situation may influence the ownership structure you choose for your 
business.
 
✓ Business and estate attorneys: A good business attorney can educate 
you on the basic legal requirements of operating a business in your 
community. An estate attorney can work with you, your tax professional, 
and your financial planner to plan how you’ll grow the business to build 
your personal fortune — and protect yourself from various risks along 
the way.
 
✓ Business valuation professionals: Whether you plan to use a business 
broker, a business appraiser, or an accountant or attorney who’s 
certified as a valuation professional (see Chapter 7), it’s a good 
idea to contact and review candidates well ahead of any purchase. 
Interviewing these professionals may give you a broader view of your 
ideas for owning and operating a company.

Prospective buyers need to be planners, and no matter how many experts 
are helping you in your quest for a business, building your own independent 
knowledge of your target company and industry makes good sense.
Thinking cash, not debt
In the rush to own a business, many people 
focus on the selling price and not on the ongo-
ing costs of staying in business or the risks 
inherent in being new to a business. Likewise, 
people who start companies also fail to exam-
ine how much cash they’ll need to keep operat-
ing before profits start trickling in.
An ongoing business with a solid customer 
base, staff, and operating system in place is in 
a much better position to keep generating 
the cash that’s the lifeblood of any business. 
(Are you as tired of that cliché as we are? Oh, 
well, it’s probably still the best description of 
cash flow.)
So we’ll go out on a limb and say it: Your plan to 
buy a business should include projections for 
the worst-case scenario for the company’s 
cash needs. Based on that scenario, you should 
go into the purchasing process with a surplus of 
cash to handle contingencies that can arise 
when a business changes hands. These contin-
gencies can include the following:
 ✓ Employee turnover: Some high-producing 
employees may be lured away to competi-
tors during the ownership transition, and 
your sales may go down until you bring in 
suitable replacements for these people. 
(Alternatively, you may want to install an 
incentive system to keep the best employ-
ees right where they are.)
 ✓ Promotional costs: You may have to incur 
promotional costs to assure existing cus-
tomers that they’ll still be well taken care of 
and to assure prospective customers that 
now is a good time to come onboard. You 
also may offer discounts or other savings to 
loyal customers to keep them in the fold.
 ✓ Repairs: Computers, machinery, and any-
thing else with a plug or a fuel tank may 
break during the first year you’re in busi-
ness. Yes, you may have inspected all the 
assets with a fine-toothed comb, but break-
downs happen.
If you’re making a purchase decision during 
flush times, you may be tempted to go to lenders 
to finance the purchase. But when times get 
tough, banks want their money back. It may be 
a better idea to invest your own money or to get 
people who are close to you and who under-
stand your skills and your company involved in 
your business as investors. This arrangement is 
called equity financing. Talk about it with 
experts you trust. Equity is better than debt 
because investors have decided to take the ride 
with you, and you get to set the terms under 
which they’ll be able to pull their money out of 
the business. Banks don’t have the same alli-
ance with the owners of the company; when 
times get tough, banks are seldom as under-
standing as shareholders will be.
A balance sheet loaded with debt will devalue 
your business over time. Therefore, if you find 
that you have to take on debt, treat it as a short-
term expense to be extinguished quickly. (That’s 
not a bad idea for your personal finances, too.)

230
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
The nation’s bankruptcy courts are filled with men and women who put 
everything they had into owning a business but failed because they never 
took the wide or the detailed view. A valuation professional can help 
you with the detailed view — the best ones are trained to spot valuation 
challenges specific to the industry you’ve chosen. But the wide view? That’s 
where you need to start.
 
Without a full understanding of the kind of business you want to buy, the 
industry it’s part of, and the economic and operational challenges affecting 
it now and expected in the future, you literally have no business being in 
that business.
Remember that readers are leaders. (Yes, we’re suckers for corny old slo-
gans.) But a big part of due diligence is good old-fashioned book-cracking — 
or in today’s parlance, Web surfing. Granted, you can’t believe everything 
you read in newspapers or in magazines, and certainly not on the Internet. 
But even if you’re bringing in experts to help you value a business, the 
ultimate decision to buy rests with you, so you have to be smart enough to 
know whether the people you hire to evaluate a deal are representing you 
properly.
What should you be reading? Here are a few ideas:
 
✓ Trade publications: Virtually every industry has a trade publication 
following it. At one time, many trade publications were excessively 
friendly to the industries they covered, but today, the best of these 
publications are more objective and journalistically written. They’re 
great resources for up-to-the-minute industry news, trends, and gossip. 
If you come across a major business-news story in the paper, on televi-
sion, or on the radio, chances are that the first rumblings came from 
the trade journalists who regularly speak with companies, suppliers, 
and customers every day. In many cases, trade publications are simply 
closer to business news than general publications are.
 
 Do an Internet search on your industry name and the phrase “trade 
publication” or “trade journal,” and see what comes up. You may have 
to try several combinations of words, but soon you start finding titles to 
work with. Find and bookmark the journals that have the largest circula-
tion; generally, those publications are the leaders in their industries. 
Many trade publications have their circulation listed with the Audit 
Bureau of Circulations (www.accessabc.com), and you can check the 
largest ones in their category there. But the Internet has made it easy to 
spot major publications by the way they turn up in searches.
 
 When you find your selection of trades, go to their Web sites and search 
their archives. You also may want to subscribe to print versions of the 
publications, but first see whether you can score a free subscription 
offer and consolidate your research during the free-subscription period.

231
 Chapter 16: Due Diligence on the Buy Side
 
✓ Online databases: Major online databases can help you find news 
stories, Wall Street analysts’ reports, and company-issued news releases 
in most industries. Because many of these are paid databases, check 
with your local public and college libraries to see whether you can 
access them there for free. For a great list of databases you should 
bookmark, check Chapter 12.
 
✓ City business publications: Most major and mid-size cities have 
some form of business weekly that focuses on the activities of local 
companies. Search for stories about competitors of the target 
company and about the local economy.
 
✓ Trade-association data: Manufacturing, technology, and other industry 
groups in a particular region may compile annual guides that list all their 
members — your potential competitors or target companies. Depending 
on how many years such a guide has been published, checking it is a 
good way to identify current and past executives, as well as critical 
reported numbers, products, and other data over a company’s history.
 
Join a professional organization in your community, the chamber of com-
merce, or even a civic or nonprofit board that can put you in touch with 
people who are connected to the industry in which you want to buy.
Gathering the Company’s Data
When you’re touring a facility or speaking with executives at a company that 
you’re considering buying, always do the following things:
 
✓ Look at how a company keeps house. Cluttered or messy offices don’t 
necessarily mean that disorganized or untalented people work there. 
Facilities that are literally falling down, filthy, or otherwise neglected, 
however, may indicate that the company is facing financial difficulties 
or, at the very least, a loss of vision or purpose.
 
 On the other hand, does the place look as though it’s been sanitized to 
cover up deeper problems? That happens, too. Don’t be afraid to judge 
the surroundings privately. Keep your questions to the owner polite, but 
don’t be afraid to ask her why things are the way they are. If you con-
sider such problems to be fixable, housekeeping problems may not be 
bad, because they may give you a better negotiating position on price.
 
✓ Check the work environment. Ideally, you know what a healthy work 
environment looks like. Employees will have disagreements, but in the 
right environment, they communicate well and even have fun at their 
jobs. No workplace is perfect, but if you sense that people have a bunker 
mentality, or if you see fields of empty desks at various times during the 
day, by all means, ask why.

232
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
 You may think it’d be fun to clean house and start over with your own 
team, but hiring and firing people are extremely costly in terms of time 
and money. If you buy a company and choose to replace someone 
who’s been there for 20 years, you may lose a crabby, unproductive 
employee in a layoff, which is good, but you may need to pay his 
replacement a lot more, which is a sizable expense that you have to 
figure into the valuation. Every whim in business has a potential cost.
 
✓ Observe body language. Any potential transaction always involves 
a bit of nervousness, with the parties dancing around each other in the 
early stages of information sharing. But if you sense fear, evasiveness, 
or uncertainty about giving you what you need, the situation isn’t too 
tough to read.
 
 If you’ve been an employee before, just put yourself in the other per-
son’s shoes. Figure out whether she’s just nervous about talking to the 
potential new boss or whether bigger problems are afoot.
 
✓ Decide whether you like the seller. You may be looking to buy a com-
pany whose owner you’ve known for years, and the purchase process is 
like two friends’ working together to make something great happen. That 
scenario is the kind of feel-good situation that everyone loves. In most 
cases, however, you deal with a stranger. The owner may have mixed 
feelings about the sale; after all, he made this baby. He may be looking 
to dump a lemon on you. Or in his heart of hearts, he may not think that 
you’ve got the right stuff to buy the company. Talk about a complex 
dynamic!
Most people don’t wake up in the morning and say, “Hey, I’m going down to 
Smitty’s to buy his business!” Smart business deals aren’t born in a day; it 
may take years to know what you really want and possibly longer to get 
it. Thanks to the Internet, any storefront or business started in someone’s 
attic has the potential to become a global company, so you need to do due 
diligence to figure out the true potential of any company.
In the next few sections, we suggest some questions to ask about the target 
company.
Knowing which questions to ask 
about the target company
Ask more than one source to answer the following questions. Due diligence 
begins with basic queries of prospective sellers, such as the following:
 
✓ What’s your impression of how the company is viewed by outsiders — 
competitors, the press, the industry, and the community at large? (If you 
know that the company has problems with its public image, you need to 
know whether it’s in denial about these problems.)

233
 Chapter 16: Due Diligence on the Buy Side
 
✓ What kind of gifts and incentives does the company give customers? 
(See whether these rewards skirt ethical boundaries.)
 
✓ If the company isn’t doing overseas production now, did it plan to do 
so in the future?
 
✓ Does the company pay in dollars or use a system to hedge against 
currency risk? If so, how does that system work?
 
✓ What are the company’s most valuable intellectual property assets?
 
✓ Does the company have any copyrights, licenses, or patents that are 
ready to expire?
 
✓ What quality-control systems are in place in various departments of the 
target company?
 
✓ What proprietary technology or systems are most valuable to the 
business?
 
✓ What are the company’s largest vendors and suppliers? What 
percentage of the overall purchasing budget do they represent, and 
how long has the company been working with them?
 
✓ Who are the company’s biggest customers? What percentage of total 
revenue do they represent, and how long has the company been 
working with them?
Checking with the company’s departments
Not only do you want to tour the business you’re thinking about buying, but 
you also want permission to talk to its employees. Make sure you’re cleared 
to talk with employees so you can find out what they’re like; if you’re thinking 
about buying this company, its people may become your people. Would you 
want them? Here are key departments on which you should focus.
Legal/audit
The company’s legal and auditing counselors depend on the target company 
for fees or paychecks, so they’re unlikely to say anything controversial. 
But if they want to keep the company as a client or as an employer, being 
straight with you is to their advantage.
You need to understand their processes and how they work with the firm; 
you also need to sound them out for clues about problems and added 
complexities in the business that you may not have heard from management. 
Consider asking the following questions:
 
✓ How open is the company in working with you on legal and audit issues?
 
✓ What’s your relationship with the chief counsel or chief financial officer?

234
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
✓ Is top management involved in managing legal, tax, and accounting 
issues?
 
✓ How would you describe the recordkeeping and support technology for 
legal and financial matters?
Information technology
Technology is a tremendous driver of business as well as an enormous 
source of risk. You need to question both top management and the 
company’s information technology (IT) chieftain (if any) about the state of 
the company’s technology, how the technology is used in each department, 
and how secure it is. Here are some questions to ask:
 
✓ Is the Internet a big part of the company’s operations? If so, how is it 
used?
 
✓ What computer hardware does the company own, and how old is it? 
Does the company have any plans to upgrade its system?
 
✓ What software is used in the various departments of the company, 
and how often is it upgraded? Should I be aware of any major software 
revisions?
 
✓ May I see a summary of the company’s proprietary data and security 
procedures?
 
✓ How do customers interact with the company’s technology? (You want 
to know whether the technology is doing all it can to support, improve, 
and speed the customer experience.)
 
✓ How do suppliers and vendors interact with the company’s technology? 
(You want to know whether the technology is doing all it can to improve 
the supply chain.)
 
✓ Has the company’s IT department ever had a crisis situation, such as a 
hacker attack or the loss of important data? If so, how did the crisis 
affect the company’s operation and its relationship with customers?
 
✓ Does the company use outside consultants to service its information 
systems?
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing personnel are important sources because you need 
to understand who’s pushing the gas pedal on revenue. Here are some 
questions to ask:
 
✓ Who does the sales forecasting in the company, and how is that 
information shared?
 
✓ Does the company have an internal sales and marketing staff, or does 
it work with independent reps or contractors?
 
✓ What are the seasonal sales patterns in the business?

235
 Chapter 16: Due Diligence on the Buy Side
 
✓ What were the company’s sales trends during the past three years by 
product or business line?
 
✓ How did success align with the company’s advertising and marketing 
spending?
 
✓ What are the most successful marketing and advertising approaches 
that the company has taken in recent years?
 
✓ Does each division have standard payment terms, and if so, are there 
exceptions to those terms (such as different arrangements for certain 
types of customers)?
 
✓ What’s your marketing focus for the next one to three years? Are there 
specific new territories you plan to enter, and are new products that 
will lead you there in the pipeline?
 
✓ How does the Internet figure into the company’s sales and marketing 
plan?
 
✓ How does the company measure the performance of its sales and 
marketing expenditures?
 
✓ What are the forecasts for goals and spending for the coming year, and 
how often are forecasts reviewed and tweaked?
 
✓ Does the company have a relationship with an advertising or marketing 
agency? If so, how long has the relationship existed, and what do you 
regard as the agency’s best work?
 
✓ Have you always had the same advertising or marketing agencies? Why 
or why not?
 
✓ What are the three best sales and marketing initiatives that the company 
is executing right now?
Collecting Outside Data about Your 
Industry and the Economy
Information about the economy and the particular industry in which the 
target company operates is critical to the due diligence process for any 
business. A prospective buyer needs to understand how the general course 
of the economy will affect the company he’s targeting.
If you took a course in economics, you’ve heard of the business cycle: the 
periodic, irregular, up-and-down movements in economic activity, measured 
by fluctuations in gross domestic product (GDP) and macroeconomic 
variables. Overall growth and contraction of the domestic and international 
economy tend to lift and lower all boats, yet each industry has its own peaks 
and valleys based on where the economy as a whole stands. You need to 
know what those peaks and valleys are.

236
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
Many people buy businesses outside their range of expertise, only to find 
that they’ve bought into a down business cycle in that industry. Have you 
ever tried to sail a boat in a dry creek bed? It doesn’t work so well.
Breaking confidentiality can get you into trouble
If either party to a deal breaks a confidentiality 
or nondisclosure agreement, she leaves herself 
open to legal action and potentially more pub-
licity than either party is going to be comfort-
able with. Here are some of the laws people 
may risk breaking in the due diligence process:
 ✓ Economic Espionage Act of 1996: This law 
makes the theft or misappropriation of a 
trade secret a federal crime. The law con-
tains two sections criminalizing two sorts of 
activity. The first section criminalizes the 
misappropriation of trade secrets (includ-
ing conspiracy to misappropriate trade 
secrets and the subsequent acquisition of 
such misappropriated trade secrets) with 
the knowledge or intent that the theft will 
benefit a foreign power. Penalties for viola-
tion are fines of up to $500,000 per offense 
and imprisonment of up to 15 years for indi-
viduals and fines of up to $10 million for 
organizations.
 
 The second section criminalizes the misap-
propriation of trade secrets related to or 
included in a product that is produced for or 
placed in interstate (including international) 
commerce, with the knowledge or intent 
that the misappropriation will injure the 
owner of the trade secret.
 ✓ Uniform Trade Secrets Act: UTSA is a model 
law that defines the rights and remedies of 
a common-law trade secret. The law 
imposes civil rather than criminal liability 
for misappropriation of trade secrets and 
creates a private cause of action for the 
victim. Remedies for misappropriation of 
trade secrets under the act are injunctions; 
damages, including exemplary (punitive) 
damages; and in cases of bad faith or willful 
and malicious misappropriation, reason-
able attorney’s fees.
Nondisclosure agreements may protect you 
from careless or unscrupulous companies and 
contractors, but they won’t protect you from the 
law. These agreements can be overruled legally 
if a legitimate reason to do so exists (as part of 
a court case, for example). Also, they can be 
rendered invalid if they’re worded incorrectly, 
so make sure you get proper legal documents 
that clearly define the terms and conditions of 
the agreement.
Confidentiality is meant to work for you, too. A 
prospective seller definitely wants his financials 
and other key data to be kept secret from com-
petitors, but he also wants data on your qualifi-
cations to buy the business. Just make sure that 
the confidentiality agreement doesn’t shield 
you from getting any information that you’ll need 
in due diligence production. In this situation, 
working with a good valuation professional or 
lawyer makes sense.
Make sure that the target company has three 
years’ worth of financial data for you to exam-
ine, and check carefully to see whether those 
numbers were audited by a good accounting 
firm. If not, you’ve spotted another potential 
trouble sign. Go to Chapter 12 to see what a 
seller should do in preparation for a sale and for 
a sample confidentiality agreement.

237
 Chapter 16: Due Diligence on the Buy Side
When you study economic activity, you need to understand how your chosen 
industry responds to the economy as a whole, and you need to understand 
what key economic indicators are. Here are some of the most common 
examples:
 
✓ Gross domestic product: As the measuring stick for the nation’s total 
output of goods and services, GDP is the broadest economic measure.
 
✓ Job growth: Businesses and consumers feel more at ease when the job 
market is expanding, and they also feel more comfortable opening their 
wallets. When job growth evens out or starts to shrink over a period 
of months, it’s a signal that the economy is heading for a slowdown.
 
✓ Consumer confidence: The Conference Board (www.conference-
board.org) and the University of Michigan (www.sca.isr.umich.
edu) maintain separate indexes of consumer sentiment based on 
interviews with heads of households and other resources. Even if you’re 
not in a purely consumer-oriented business, virtually every economic 
trend filters up from individual spending.
 
✓ Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index: The ISM index (www.
ism.ws) is viewed as being a solid measurement of whether the 
manufacturing economy is contracting or expanding. Each month, 
more than 400 companies provide the ISM with data on changes in 
production, new orders, new export orders, imports, employment, 
inventories, prices, lead times, and the timeliness of supplier deliveries. 
By compiling the responses, the ISM can piece together a national 
economic picture. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that 
the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; a reading below 
50 percent means that the economy is contracting.
The preceding list represents only a fraction of the national data that’s 
available. You also need to dig around in your own state and municipality for 
data that can directly inform your decision making. Your assignment is to 
study the economic indicators and metrics that affect the company you 
plan to buy. A good way to find industry metrics and measurement tools is to 
conduct an online search for the phrase “industry metrics” and the name of 
the particular industry.

Forensic Accounting and the 
Due Diligence Process
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing what forensic accountants do
▶ Recognizing the unique qualities of forensic accounting
▶ Knowing when to use a forensic accountant
▶ Conducting a forensic test
▶ Examining forensic accounting case studies
T
hanks to the growing number of police shows on TV that focus on the 
science of blood and guts, the word forensic has worked its way into the 
mainstream. It’s worked its way into mainstream accounting, too. But unlike 
the fictional character Gil Grissom of CSI, though, forensic accountants tend 
to work in clean surroundings. Only the numbers are dirty.
Wait, though — aren’t forensic accountants hired only for big-company 
situations? Not anymore. Where numbers are withheld, incomplete, 
questionable, or possibly fabricated, professionals with backgrounds in 
forensic accounting can be useful to businesses of all sizes. Even law 
enforcement officials involved in counterterrorism measures use forensic 
accounting techniques to detect the tiny amounts of money funneled through 
cash-based shell businesses, such as convenience stores and tobacco shops.
This chapter focuses on what forensic accounting means, what practitioners 
do, and what benefits accrue to buyers and sellers who engage forensic 
accountants in the due diligence process of a business purchase or sale.
Understanding Forensic Accountants
Thanks to prime-time TV, most people know what the forensic part of forensic 
accounting means — an examination after something undesirable has 
happened. But forensic accounting definitely involves more. Forensic 

240
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
accounting mixes accounting, auditing, and investigative skills to determine 
fraud or other hidden or mistaken activities in an organization’s or person’s 
finances. The Forensic Accounting Academy, part of the National Association 
of Certified Valuation Analysts, offers a definition that’s quite clear and 
succinct: “the art and science of investigating people and money.”
Forensic accountants often work in tandem with attorneys (estate, bank-
ruptcy, divorce, and corporate) and federal, state, and local law enforcement 
officials to uncover mistaken or illegal activities within organizations. In a 
business-valuation context, they frequently work to find evidence of value — 
or lack of value — that others may prefer to conceal.
Characterizing a qualified 
forensic accountant
If you’re hiring a forensic accountant, don’t automatically assume that he 
has training in valuation. Check to see which certifications he holds on the 
valuation side. Certified Valuation Analyst (CVA), for example, is a leading 
certification that requires specific training and testing in valuation. (For more 
information on certification and training, turn to Chapter 7.)
What should any forensic accountant you hire know? Some of the items 
in the following list may be somewhat familiar, because they’re the same 
qualifications you require of a valuation professional:
 
✓ Expert knowledge of accounting and control systems
 
✓ Solid investigative skills
 
✓ Good instincts and training in legal and illegal human behavior
 
✓ Knowledge of the industry in which an investigation subject operates, 
including knowledge of key stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, 
regulators, shareholders, and lenders
 
✓ Knowledge of technology that criminals use to steal money and goods
 
✓ Understanding of banking practices and issues related to the flow of 
money into and out of an organization
 
✓ Understanding of commercial, civil, and criminal laws in the pertinent 
jurisdiction that could affect a particular organization’s valuation
 
✓ Awareness of differences in business practices and restrictions in 
various countries
 
✓ Creativity, speed, and accuracy

241
 Chapter 17: Forensic Accounting and the Due Diligence Process
 
Forensic accountants may work in concert with investigators and other 
covert players in the investigative process, but they need to know the legal 
restrictions on certain investigative tactics. Therefore, you need to confirm 
that your forensic accounting professional understands the laws that 
are likely to apply. If you’re hiring a forensic accountant, ask what her investi-
gative limits would be for your situation, and ask what things she would and 
wouldn’t do. If she indicates that she operates without limits or is unable to 
answer your question specifically, go with a candidate who can.
What training is involved
Forensic accountants begin as trained Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), 
but most have something extra: a taste for the discovery and presentation of 
evidence to fill in the blanks in valuations, divorce proceedings, corporate 
investigations, and dozens of other kinds of cases and projects. They may 
spend plenty of time in court testifying on their findings, so they have to 
think faster than the lawyers who are peppering them with questions. 
(Forensic accountants may never have to defend their results in court, but 
their responsibility is to prepare their results as if they will.)
Forensic accountants are often asked to investigate cases that involve fraud, 
shareholder lawsuits, insurance claims, personal injury, business valuations, 
and other proceedings involving money transactions. Since 2001, counterter-
rorism has also been a fast-growing segment of most skilled practices.
The forensic accountant who caught Capone
Frank J. Wilson, a U.S. Treasury Department 
accountant, was the guy who put Al Capone 
away for evading taxes on income. The true 
story isn’t quite like the movie The Untouchables, 
but it’s close enough. Capone got away with 
dozens or perhaps hundreds of murders, but an 
aggressive bean counter brought him to heel 
through Capone’s own financial records.
Wilson and his team worked 18-hour days, 
reviewing more than 2 million documents and 
other key evidence seized in various raids 
on Capone’s operations over a 6-year period 
starting in 1929. They analyzed phone records 
and investigated banks and credit agencies. 
They developed a network of snitches, tapped 
phones, and seized various sets of financial 
documents related to Capone. Eventually, they 
found evidence linking Capone to gambling pro-
ceeds through a dog-track operation in Florida.
Capone unsuccessfully ordered a hit on Wilson 
and his wife, who moved from hotel to hotel 
while the investigation went on. Undeterred, 
Wilson gathered evidence to prove that Capone 
had a total of $116,000 in nondeductible 
expenses after claiming no income. Capone 
was found guilty and sent to prison in 1931.

242
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
Most forensic accountants may have experience in auditing: reviewing the 
accuracy of a company’s or person’s figures along accounting guidelines. 
Beyond basic accounting training that leads to CPA certification, the forensic 
accounting field (like most industries) is exploding with certifications in a 
variety of forensic accounting–related skills. Here are a few:
 
✓ Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE): This designation comes from the 
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a 25,000-member organization 
in Austin, Texas. Though many CPAs have this designation, you don’t 
have to be a CPA to earn it; indeed, the CFE was designed for members 
of the law enforcement and security communities who lacked CPA 
certificates.
 
✓ Certified Forensic Financial Analyst (CFFA): This designation is 
provided by the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts 
(nacva.com).
 
✓ American College of Forensic Examiners: This organization (www.
acfei.com) offers a cornucopia of certification courses in a variety of 
areas, including consulting, accounting, nursing, medical investigation, 
homeland security, information security, and disaster preparation.
Expect forensic training to grow in the future.
Combat CPAs
Darrell Dorrell is a CPA, CVA, and ASA 
(American Society of Appraisers business ana-
lyst) with financial forensics in Lake Oswego, 
Oregon. He has trained employees of the 
Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation in forensic accounting. Dorrell, 
who grew up in a military family, only half-jok-
ingly calls accountants like himself “combat 
CPAs” because they have to work fast, quietly, 
and thoroughly to get results — sometimes 
before the object of the investigation knows 
that forensic accountants are onto him.
Dorrell says the “combat” part applies only par-
tially to the process of investigation. The other 
part has to do with the tough courtroom grilling 
many accountants get over valuation assign-
ments and other financial data they uncover. He 
maintains that typical CPAs trained in valuation 
alone are not always prepared for tough, 
detailed questioning on the stand in a particu-
larly nasty divorce proceeding or corporate 
fraud case.
“Our job is to look behind and beyond the num-
bers,” Dorrell explains. “Classic ratio analysis 
used in business valuation is predicated on 
comparing one set of numbers to another and 
reaching conclusions based solely on those fig-
ures. The observations really don’t tell you 
about the veracity of the numbers.
“Our job is to drill down into the composition of 
the numbers and tell you whether something’s 
wrong or purely structural. Forensic tests such 
as indices can assess whether financial state-
ments have been manipulated and where the 
manipulation has likely occurred.”

 Chapter 17: Forensic Accounting and the Due Diligence Process
Where forensic accountants work
Many accounting firms are dedicated to the practice of forensic accounting 
or have forensic accounting divisions. Some of the biggest employers of 
forensic accountants are the U.S. government and corporate America.
The Internal Revenue Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and many 
state and local police departments have forensic accountants on staff 
to address local law enforcement needs, whereas corporations may have 
forensic accountants on their own payrolls to stem internal fraud.
 
Some major accounting firms may say that they have forensic departments, 
but you still need to check an accountant’s experience. Checking a forensic 
accountant’s qualifications and training is critical.
Recognizing situations that link forensic 
accounting and valuation
The chief job of many forensic accountants in valuation assignments is to 
reconstruct income and/or identify the ownership of various assets — most 
often, its illegal path into the wrong hands inside or outside an organization. 
In some cases, forensic accountants, such as Darrell Dorrell, CPA, CVA, and 
ASA, use existing information, such as public-company data or industry 
benchmarks, but often, they need a subpoena to access needed information.
Following are some typical situations that unite forensic accountants with 
valuation assignments:
 
✓ Mergers and acquisitions: Forensic accountants may make appearances 
on due diligence teams in a host of deals. Forensic accountant Darrell 
Dorrell says involving a forensic accountant is a good thing to consider 
in most due diligence situations. Investment banks and other lenders 
also bring in forensic accountants to safeguard their interests.
 
 Besides scrutinizing numbers, forensic accountants question human 
beings in the process and do onsite inspections of the facilities being 
sold to verify the pricing in the deal. Fake or inadequate assets listed as 
being a major part of a deal may be found by any valuation professional, 
but forensic accountants specifically look for them.
 
✓ Purchase of troubled assets: In a tough economy, the last guy standing 
with cash in his pocket is in a position to make some great deals on 
business assets or whole businesses. But troubled companies — ones 
that are barely keeping the lights on, that have idled property and 
machinery, or that have padlocks on the door — got that way for a 
reason. Forensic accountants can check to see whether mistakes or 
malfeasance devalued those assets.

244
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
✓ Investigation of company theft: Some of the worst financial crimes 
happen right under the nose of the boss. Ghost payrollers — fake 
employees getting real checks — are common in companies and 
governments alike. Crooked employees can create such scams very 
easily, based on resources close to them. They can funnel cashable 
paychecks through currency exchanges that are in on the scam, for 
example. Forensic accountants are trained to spot irregularities in 
accounts that can reveal such mischief.
 
✓ Divorce investigations: Never underestimate the loss potential of love 
gone wrong. We talk about valuation issues in divorce in Chapter 19, 
and forensic accountants may play a big part in that process. In family 
law, a lot of the friction occurs over the lack of information sharing 
and suspicions that shared numbers are far below — or sometimes far 
above — where they should be.
 
✓ Global terrorism: Increasingly, companies have to meet legal standards 
to make sure that employees in the United States and abroad are not 
involved in illegal activities that could affect local, state, or national 
security. Terrorists gather their funding through many disparate 
sources, delivering small amounts that largely go undetected, says 
Dorrell.
 
 The USA Patriot Act, signed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001, requires financial institutions to establish and maintain anti-
money-laundering programs. In addition, all U.S. companies are required 
to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which establishes 
acceptable business practices. Many states have laws governing private 
investigation practices that apply to CPAs.
From a valuation professional’s perspective
Most of the time, a valuation professional does “amateur” forensic account-
ing work on her own, but her work doesn’t replace the formal procedures 
and tests done by a trained and certified forensic accountant. Valuation 
professionals get close to the forensic process when they begin to normalize 
the financials of the business. Most of the time, they’re just adding back 
the owner’s perks or making adjustments for fair market rent, fair market 
wages, and various other financial activities inside the company. If a 
valuation professional sees something that doesn’t look quite right, she 
simply notes it in the valuation report.
Here’s an example that should raise the eyebrows of a valuation professional 
but could be found more easily by a forensic accountant doing some closer 
snooping: A medical-device company takes an order, delivers the equipment 
to the patient’s home, and charges the customer (or his insurance company) 
for the items. So far, things seem perfectly normal. But suppose that the 
customer no longer needs that oxygen tank or hospital bed in his home, and 
he returns it to the company.

245
 Chapter 17: Forensic Accounting and the Due Diligence Process
The transaction was originally structured to declare the patient the owner 
of that equipment. Here’s the problem: When the material is returned, 
the company illegally takes the equipment back into its inventory without 
recording it and then uses the returned equipment to fulfill new orders 
as they come in. This process works to understate the company’s actual 
inventory and its overall cost of goods, making the company appear to be 
more profitable than it actually is. Higher profit means higher valuation — 
which may be based on fraud.
Because this operation is likely being done off the books (with no formal 
records being kept), a valuation professional may not catch the fraud. But 
if she were to smell something funny — such as margins wildly higher than 
those of competitors in the industry — she’d either try to investigate it 
herself or recommend an audit. The forensic exercise would take place as 
part of the audit.
In essence, the forensic accountant would perform an investigation to 
uncover the truth behind the numbers; then the valuation professional would 
use the results of the forensic exercise to renormalize the numbers. The 
two professionals would combine their efforts to establish and reinsert the 
true normal inventory costs, thus realigning gross margins to what they 
should’ve been.
Many appraisers working on small-company deals don’t catch this sort of 
operation unless they’re very talented and experienced. They simply don’t 
have records to tip them off and have to rely on other signals, such as 
erratic margins or other swings in financial performance that can’t be 
explained through traditional business evidence. But if a forensic accountant 
is brought in during due diligence, this situation is exactly what he should 
be looking for.
 
An audit can be the very thing that keeps a new owner from overpaying for 
a business, so if you’re a potential buyer, budget for audits that include the 
services of a forensic accountant.
From a forensic accountant’s perspective
The relationship between a valuation professional and a forensic accountant 
should be close. A valuation professional is something like an emergency 
medical technician, whereas a forensic accountant is like a pathologist. Both 
parties need to be talking. The same relationship rules go for attorneys and 
other professionals brought into the process.
Like valuation professionals who are CPAs, however, forensic accountants 
have only one allegiance: to their certificate, meaning the set of professional 
standards to which they’re required to adhere. “We have to honor those 
standards ahead of our client’s preferences because we are often called on 

246
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
to testify to those findings under oath,” says forensic accountant and CPA 
Darrell Dorrell. “We are the only credential holders in the United States with 
the word public in our title. The public expects us to be independent and 
objective above all else.”
Comparing Basic and Forensic 
Accounting
Most people think that forensic accounting is part of the basic accounting 
process. In most cases, the processes are very separate and distinct. 
According to Darrell Dorrell, the following holds true:
 
✓ An audit is a CPA’s commentary on the representation of financial 
statements produced by management. Typically, virtually no forensic 
accounting is applied.
 
✓ Basic accounting, such as the day-to-day assembly and reporting of 
a company’s financial transactions, requires virtually no forensic 
accounting.
 
✓ Forensic accounting typically assesses basic accounting reports and 
compares them with reality, identifying departures, undisclosed items, 
and related matters.
“Traditional accounting is scorekeeping according to a set of rules such 
professionals must follow. Forensic accounting is about investigation,” 
Dorrell explains. Yet he points out that forensic accounting isn’t just about 
fraud; it’s also an essential component of accurate business valuation based 
on facts and circumstances.
“It’s not just people outside the accounting profession; people inside the 
accounting profession often confuse forensic accounting with fraud. The two 
are related, but fraud is a subset of the forensic accounting discipline,” says 
Dorrell, whose company provides valuation services in addition to the more 
common activities associated with forensic accounting. Dorrell continues:
“Business valuation must consist of forensic tests because by exercising 
forensic tests, you resolve valuation-related questions. For example, with 
forensic tests, you can determine the actual pattern of cash flows — the 
ultimate measure of value, what kind of normalization (adjustment of 
financial statements) needs to occur, the optimal capital structure of the 
business — measure the similarity of guideline transactions, assess the 
fit of a discount rate, and so on.”

247
 Chapter 17: Forensic Accounting and the Due Diligence Process
Recognizing Business Situations That 
Trigger Forensic Accounting
Forensic accounting is not all about illegal activity, though questionable 
financial behavior certainly is a major catalyst for many such investigations. 
Here are some of the kinds of situations that forensic accountants may be 
hired to investigate in organizations:
 
✓ Ownership: Evidence of improper or illegal manipulation of ownership 
within a company or hidden assets relevant to heirs, shareholders, or 
soon-to-be ex-spouses
 
✓ Succession planning: When there’s doubt that a new management team 
was formed with proper diligence and planning
 
✓ Bankruptcy: When there’s suspicion of illegal or incompetent financial 
manipulations that led to companies’ going into bankruptcy or 
liquidation
Can small companies afford forensic accounting?
For many companies, professional bookkeeping 
and accounting services can be a significant 
expense. Here are some appropriate questions 
to ask yourself about affordability:
 ✓ Do you have a concern about the financials 
of a target company or a company you 
already own and think that an investigation 
is necessary? Assess the reasons you think 
a forensic investor would be appropriate in 
this situation.
 ✓ If the first point is relevant, what are the 
potential costs of not doing an investiga-
tion? The company may face possible civil 
or criminal charges, or cash may be disap-
pearing at a rate that threatens the viability 
of the business.
 ✓ What are the costs in your area for forensic 
accountants with the correct training and 
certification, and do they work for compa-
nies of your size?
The more complicated the investigation — and 
whatever chores are tied to the investigation, 
such as valuation — the more the investigation 
will cost. Professionals typically don’t charge 
fixed fees in such complex matters, but fees are 
worth asking about.
An effective way to manage fees is to instruct 
the forensic accountant to conduct the work in 
phases. In other words, consider writing into 
the work agreement a statement like this: 
“When you have reached $5,000, let me know 
your findings and where else it might be benefi-
cial to investigate.” A legitimate specialist will 
advise you to stop when there appears to be no 
reason to continue.

248
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
✓ A need for added oversight: When an owner or shareholder needs 
someone to assess a business valuation done at the request of the 
controlling shareholder
 
✓ Skimming and embezzlement: Anything from petty theft to scams that 
create massive financial losses within an organization
 
✓ Top-level corporate fraud: Companies such as Enron and WorldCom — 
two major firms that failed in the early 2000s — owed much of their 
demise to illegal and questionable acts by top management
 
✓ Mergers and acquisitions: Errors, either intentional or unintentional, 
may surface in the valuation of assets when companies are getting 
together
 
✓ Tax evasion: Evidence of hidden tax liability and possible illegal tax 
avoidance that can become a major liability for future management
 
✓ Money laundering: Suspicion that a company may be filtering ill-gotten 
money through a series of financial transactions so that the money looks 
as though it came from legitimate sources
 
✓ Contradictory financial reporting: When a company has reporting 
inconsistencies in its financial data, it may not be illegal, but it’s 
exceptionally important for a prospective buyer or seller to determine 
what the inconsistencies are and see that they’re fixed before a 
purchase or a sale
Doing a Forensic Accounting Test
This book can’t give you in-depth knowledge about forensic accounting 
processes, but here’s the basic definition of a forensic test: a financial formula 
or process that puts a company’s numbers through different paces to test or 
determine the accuracy and completeness of its figures. “By doing forensic 
tests, you can determine what kind of normalization needs to occur on a 
balance sheet,” Darrell Dorrell says.
Valuation involves few specific formulas, specific tests that apply within 
forensic evaluation. A well-known test, TATA (total accruals to total assets), 
looks something like this:
Total Accruals to Total Assets = (Working Capital – Cash – Current Taxes 
 
Payable – Depreciation/Amortization) ÷ 
 
Total Assets
A TATA test compares the consistency of results period to period. You’d do a 
TATA computation for, say, two consecutive quarters. Your index should 
remain about 0.7 throughout all the comparison periods. If you start to see 
material increases or decreases, digging a little more is appropriate.

249
 Chapter 17: Forensic Accounting and the Due Diligence Process
Looking at Forensic Accounting 
Case Studies
Forensic accountant Darrell Dorrell won’t cite actual situations, to ensure 
the privacy of clients, but he tells a few stories about small companies that 
could’ve used outside forensic accounting and valuation help:
 
✓ Case 1: “Two companies were competitors within a geographic region,” 
he says. “One was large and had been operating more than 70 years; 
the other, much smaller and had been operating about 5 years. The 
two companies agreed to merge, and each company had its own very 
high-profile accountants and attorneys conducting due diligence over an 
18-month period. After closing the transaction the following May, the 
combined operation was out of business within 90 days.”
 
 Dorrell’s firm was called in to diagnose what had happened. They 
found that the firms’ due diligence had failed to identify the extreme 
seasonality of the businesses, and both firms went ahead with a 
leveraged buyout that happened at the precise time when each business 
historically began losing cash due to the seasonality. “They simply ran 
out of money. This is an example of how traditional tools and techniques 
are simply inadequate,” Dorrell says.
 
✓ Case 2: “A company hired a national business valuation firm to deter-
mine the value of its shareholdings in anticipation of a sale. One of the 
shareholders believed that the results made no sense in comparison to 
his understanding of the company,” Dorrell says.
 
 Dorrell’s firm was called in to assess the results and found that that the 
national firm had used an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, 
and amortization (EBITDA) multiple but failed to account for the post-
transaction capital structure. Consequently, the private financing firm 
backed out of the transaction because it was doomed to fail. (For more 
on EBITDA, go to Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Case 3: The founder of a company that was more than 40 years old 
wanted to retire. “The longtime CFO, a supposed friend of the family 
(he had completed the entire family’s tax returns for many years), 
structured a deal that was portrayed as beneficial to owners, employees, 
customers, and lenders,” Dorrell explains.
 
 The trusted chief financial officer had two national valuation firms deter-
mine value, and based on that result, he secured additional debt and 
equity financing to buy most of the owner’s stock. The nature of the 
accounting treatment enabled the CFO to redeem all the old stock and 
issue new stock with a private benefit to himself. He gave himself an 
ownership position of nearly one-third without paying even a penny for 
his stock.

250
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
 Within two years, the company was struggling under the new capitaliza-
tion plan, and it became clear to the remaining family members that the 
deal had been made for the CFO’s benefit.
 
 Dorrell’s firm was called in to assess the problem, diagnose a remedy, 
and implement changes. It found that the valuation firms had overvalued 
the company to trigger the CFO’s accounting treatment. The overvalued 
company resulted in a debt load that nearly strangled the company. The 
firm was revalued at its correct value, and the capital was restructured, 
and the CFO no longer works for the company.
 
 Says Dorrell, “This was to have been a simple sale of a company where 
the owner had been around for 40 years. He relied on his CFO to arrange 
the buyout and wasn’t as closely involved in the process as he should 
have been, but indeed, the CFO structured a deal that ended up giving 
two-thirds of the company’s stock to the owner’s son and the other third 
to himself.”
Dorrell has seen many situations in which attorneys, valuation professionals, 
and corporate accountants and CFOs didn’t make a thorough evaluation of 
what the deal would cost the company post-closing. He maintains that the 
preceding examples are only a few of the reasons it’s important to bring in a 
forensic accountant before any major financial transaction takes place at a 
company to make sure that its numbers are in order.

I
n this chapter, we give you the step-by-step valuation process for a 
potential purchase of a company, putting into practice the concepts and 
steps we outline in the other chapters in Part IV. We start with full disclosure. 
If you’re planning to use this chapter as a one-size-fits-all template to value 
a company you’re planning to buy, forget it. No two companies are alike, 
and no two buyers are alike; therefore, no two valuation assignments are the 
same, either.
The purpose of this chapter is to tell you a story about one owner’s ups, 
downs, and in-betweens in the valuation process. The story isn’t a true story; 
the names and details have been changed to protect real clients. But to say 
the least, the road to value doesn’t always run smoothly, which is the main 
point you should take from this chapter.
Use this chapter as a way to prepare for the unpredictability of the valuation 
process and a way to better prepare yourself before you attempt to buy a 
company.
Being Frank: Selecting an Industry
The story we’re about to tell you involves an entrepreneur named Frank. 
Frank was a 50/50 partner in a prosperous consulting firm that placed 
consultants for information technology projects. When Frank and his partner 

252
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
were unable to come to terms on the future of their business, Frank’s 
partner agreed to buy him out, which has left Frank sitting on a considerable 
pile of cash.
Frank decides that he’s going to play golf; he even gets a job at the local golf 
course. Six to nine months later, Frank’s wife realizes that when he isn’t at 
the club, he’s spending a lot of time at home and underfoot. It’s not that 
Frank’s wife is unhappy with her husband’s success, and she’s glad he’s had 
a chance to relax a bit, but now he’s disrupting her world, and she’s starting 
to lobby Frank on his next move.
Frank realizes that he’s getting a bit bored and that it’s time to start looking 
for the next business to invest in. Whether he realizes it or not, he’s already 
begun the valuation process. He started to consider what kind of business 
he wants to start and what business may be recession-proof, or at least 
relatively so. In other words, he’s echoing the first baby steps of valuation 
outlined in the Internal Revenue Service’s Revenue Ruling 59-60 (www.irs.
gov), which requires potential business owners to consider the following:
 
✓ The nature of the business
 
✓ The history of the enterprise from its inception
 
✓ The earning capacity of the company
 
✓ The dividend-paying capacity of the company
 
✓ The economic outlook in general
 
✓ The condition and outlook of the specific industry in particular
Frank has zeroed in on the medical equipment and supply industry. His logic: 
Medical equipment is a relatively recession-proof business because no 
matter what else happens, people have illnesses. At the same time, people 
are living longer. Frank takes special note of his generation of Baby Boomers, 
the largest chunk of the nation’s population. As that group ages, he thinks, 
the demand for medical equipment and supplies is only going to grow as 
people are discharged from hospitals and require more therapy and care at 
home. Therefore, the companies that supply hospital beds, walkers, oxygen 
tanks, and the like are going to be in a very nice position.
Doing Research in Advance
Frank, like most experienced entrepreneurs, isn’t afraid to hit the books. He 
starts with Internet research to determine the best resources on the medical 
equipment industry and then heads off to the local university library to 
gather the data he needs. (For information on basic company research and 
preparing for the valuation process, go to Chapters 12 and 16.)

253
 Chapter 18: Case Study: Valuation on the Buy Side
When he pulls those resources together, he’s off to see his business attorney, 
his tax attorney, and his personal finance advisor to talk the idea through. 
They seem to think that the idea makes sense. Frank’s ready to start looking 
for companies to buy. Tip: If you think that valuation is all about spreading 
the numbers, consider Frank’s story to this point. He hasn’t begun analyzing 
the figures in depth, but he’s developing a general knowledge of the business 
and visualizing his participation in it. The numbers are next.
Frank’s first steps are to contact a broker, do some Internet research, and 
visit the various Web sites that list businesses for sale.
 
To get an overview of which businesses are available, go to the Internet. 
Three good Web sites are FirstList (www.firstlist.com), BizBuySell (www.
bizbuysell.com), and MergerNetwork (www.mergernetwork.com).
Frank finds one business located in Florida that looks very interesting. He 
contacts the broker who listed this business for sale.
Contacting the Target
Through the broker, Frank contacts the target company. He’s required to 
sign a confidentiality agreement to see the introductory data on the company 
for sale. Within a few days, Frank receives a small marketing package 
describing the company.
Frank’s marketing package is fairly standard. It provides details on how and 
when the business began, how the business has performed over the years, 
and how it has grown, as well as details on the owners and members of 
management. The package also includes what ideally are audited financial 
statements of the target company, signed by the auditor. Most potential 
buyers go straight to the financials to perform their own version of a quick-
and-dirty valuation, which we cover in the following section.
Negotiating the quick-and-dirty 
valuation stage
Frank starts with rule-of-thumb guides (refer to Chapter 9), which are only 
one part of the initial quick-and-dirty valuation stage. In addition to using 
rules of thumb, he applies certain market multiples and performs a basic 
capitalization-of-earnings calculation.

254
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
 
A market multiple is a formula tailored to the specific attributes of an industry 
to measure its performance. A capitalization-of-earnings calculation allows you 
to calculate the present value of future cash flow, which is a way to predict 
future earnings. If you determine that future earnings won’t be greater than 
the ones the business is making now, why buy the company?
These standard computations can give a prospective owner his first ballpark 
idea of a company’s current and future value. If the future looks good, the 
buyer can move forward.
Knowing when to talk . . . 
and when to hang up
The Florida company’s numbers look good, so Frank organizes a conference 
call to find out more about the company’s operations. Over the course of a 
couple of weeks and a few more phone conversations, he finds out even more 
about what’s going on with the company, its management, and its employees. 
He even gets a couple of customers to talk on the quiet.
If you’ve read Chapter 16 — the chapter on buyer due diligence — this 
process is familiar. If not, stick a bookmark in this page, and start reading 
Chapter 16 now, because Frank dodges a land mine by doing due diligence.
Frank hears from a customer that the company shipped a bunch of recalled 
oxygen dispensers to a client by mistake. No deaths or injuries were reported 
as a result of this mistake, but because Frank did his homework, he realizes 
that such liabilities can surface months or years later. Figuring this risk into 
his calculations, he decides to terminate the talks, which is good, because 
this company may have brought him significant headaches.
Frank is one month older and back to square one, and his wife isn’t happy.
This example shows you two important things: Finding the best company 
to buy takes time, and if a company is up for sale, you need to know 
exactly why.
Moving on to Company Number Two
Frank sets his sights on a similar company that’s based in Atlanta. He does 
his initial due diligence and finds that the firm is doing about $1 million a 
year in gross revenue, with a profit of about $300,000 a year — a very nice 
set of numbers. Instantly, Frank wants to know more, so he gets out his 
calculator again.

255
 Chapter 18: Case Study: Valuation on the Buy Side
Frank’s initial figuring puts the company’s value at between $600,000 and 
$900,000, which sounds good so far and should make his impatient wife 
happy. He decides to bid at the high end, so he lets the broker know that 
he’s interested in putting down $600,000 in cash down at closing and 
the remaining $300,000 in the form of a seller note payable in quarterly 
payments over four years at 8 percent interest to make it really worthwhile 
for the sellers.
Seeing How Failing to Consult 
an Advisor Can Cost You
At any point during the scenario we explain in the preceding section, do 
we mention that Frank talked to any advisor before making that tentative 
offer? Nope, we don’t — and nope, he didn’t, which is a potentially big 
mistake. Certainly, Frank is an intelligent guy, and he knows that it’s in his 
best interest to get a professional advisor involved at some point, but he 
doesn’t want his costs to escalate out of control.
 
Doing the quick-and-dirty analysis to educate yourself in the early stages of 
the valuation process is fine, but it’s not fine to move ahead without the 
analysis and approval of a professional advisor who has experience in these 
types of transactions. Failing to consult with a professional advisor can create 
a very bad situation for you.
Knowing when to involve advisors
Should an advisor have been involved from the beginning, even though Frank 
was just trying to find out about the opportunity? Maybe someone should 
have asked him these questions:
 
✓ Do you have enough capital that you can afford to lose a little in case of 
a mistake?
 
✓ Do you have such a thorough knowledge of the company’s business and 
its competitors that you won’t leave any stone unturned?
 
✓ Are you truly your best advocate, or can you find a better one?
Frank has never worked in this industry before. He’s made a cursory investi-
gation and worked the numbers to his satisfaction. The gods may be with 
him, and the deal could work out beautifully. But if he hasn’t vetted the 
decision and his knowledge turns out to be inadequate late in the transaction 
period — or worse, after the transaction is done — he can’t do much about 
the mistakes of poor investigation and valuation.

256
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
We maintain that you should get a valuation professional involved earlier in 
the process rather than later, based on the experience you have with the 
business and industry you’re targeting. Getting backup can help you make 
better use of your money and time by uncovering fatal flaws in the business.
Failing to work with an advisor early can cost you a lot more time and money 
than engaging a valuation professional from the start, and it more than likely 
determines your ability to succeed. This was Frank’s mistake.
 
Too many times in privately held businesses, you find a story behind the 
numbers, and this story can be dangerous. Owners can bury extraordinary 
personal expenses in line items or under-the-table transactions deep within 
financial statements. In particularly egregious cases, even a professional 
advisor may not uncover some fatal flaws. But in our experience, it’s generally 
better to have an expert on the team early, because later, those problems can 
end up in court.
Encountering problems
Frank leaps in with both feet and completes the deal.
Any acquisition involves a transition period in which the new owner gets 
both feet wet. That transition period can be bumpy if the new owner has 
never worked in the industry, as in Frank’s case. Frank is busy for the first 
few months finding out about the customers, the operations, the employees, 
and dozens of other aspects of the business. A typical business learning 
curve can last anywhere from three months (for someone who’s operated in 
the business) to nearly a year (for inexperienced individuals like Frank).
At the six-month point, Frank starts to see things that don’t look quite right. 
His cost-of-goods reports and inventory numbers, which are supposed to be 
complementary, are way off.
This situation affects his bottom-line cash flow, because he seems to be 
spending a lot more money on inventory than the previous owner did, which 
drives up his cost of goods and slashes his profitability.
The buyer’s due diligence and the owner’s cover-up
After Frank valued the company, he made an offer based on the financial 
statements provided by the previous owner during the sale process. Right 
after he got the nod, he went to his local banker to finance a portion of that 
deal. He decided that the company’s profits would more than pay down 

257
 Chapter 18: Case Study: Valuation on the Buy Side
that loan and supply him a nice weekly paycheck. Now, staring down at his 
uncertain operating figures, he finds himself wondering whether he can pay 
the bank, much less his own salary. So much for due diligence.
Frank is determined to get to the bottom of the problem. The first mistake 
he uncovers is incorrect inventory numbers supplied during due diligence. 
He finds that the company sometimes refurbished used equipment and 
turned it back into inventory without a record of having done so. The next 
time a patient needed equipment from the company, a used, refurbished, 
and possibly broken piece of equipment went out into the marketplace.
Aside from the potential liability of product failure, this situation constituted 
fraud. Accounting rules prohibit companies from charging a customer for an 
item and then taking it back into inventory without recording it or paying for 
it. Technically, the company no longer owned that piece of equipment, 
because the cost of the equipment had already been charged to someone 
else. Also, a potential buyer had no real way of knowing about this practice 
just by taking a cursory look at the company’s financial statements.
The company’s fraudulent practice made the due diligence numbers that 
Frank evaluated look a lot better. Some orders or fulfillments didn’t have a 
cost of goods attached or a corresponding purchase of a new inventory item 
to fulfill each order. This illegal activity overinflated the numbers and made 
the company look more profitable than it actually was.
Yes, owners sometimes lie
Frank finds more adventures in the accounts receivable department. In the 
medical equipment and supply industry, equipment is used to fulfill orders. 
Then someone or something is billed: the patient, a hospital, an insurance 
company, or state or federal government through the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs. Each of these entities has a different schedule for paying its bills. 
Some of these entities pay in 30 days; others, in 60 days; others, in 90 days. 
Therefore, working-capital requirements are a critical factor in this business.
Frank heard something about this sort of behavior in the industry during his 
due diligence and asked the previous owner of the company about it point-
blank. The problem was that the owner lied, saying that everything was fine.
Frank’s mad now. His inventory and working capital are in shambles. He 
refuses to make any payments on the seller-note portion of the deal (the 
$300,000 piece of the $900,000 deal we mention earlier in this chapter). Harsh 
words ensue, and Frank moves the whole mess into court, where he claims 
that the previous owner misrepresented the profitability of the company and 
that as a result, he was duped into paying far more for it than it was worth.

258
Part IV: If You’re Buying a Business . . . 
Seeing what could’ve been done
Over the next two years, Frank shells out thousands of dollars and consi-
derable time to bring the previous owners to heel. In the end, he straightens 
out and runs the company, and he’s forgiven payment on the $300,000 seller 
note, but his win comes with considerable personal and financial cost.
Suppose that Frank had hired a trained, experienced valuation professional 
at the start of the transaction. The problems with the business were 
essentially a result of the previous owner’s practice of running the business 
off the books. With no clues in the financial records to go by, what could 
that valuation professional have done?
In a full valuation scenario, trained professionals should do a ratio compari-
son of the financials with those of similar companies in the same industry, 
including current ratio, quick ratio, accounts receivable turns, and inventory 
turns (see Chapter 8 for some of the ratio formulas). Then they turn to a host 
of industry-specific metrics that measure comparable industries in a closer 
way. Checking these computations against those that are common in an 
industry can bring certain abnormalities to light.
 
An inventory turn is the inventory turnover, the ratio of a company’s annual 
sales to its inventory, or how long average items remain in that inventory. 
Every industry that has inventory has a common healthy inventory turnover 
period. If a company is ahead of its industry turnover period, typically, this 
news is good. If the company is behind its industry turnover period, this news 
usually is bad.
In Frank’s case, the inventory and accounts receivable numbers were 
seriously out of whack, but he didn’t dig deeply enough to discover this.
Checking Benchmarking Data
The Risk Management Association (RMA) keeps data on more than 700 
industries and tracks all aspects of their operations. Granted, Frank could’ve 
checked that resource and many others in his search, but he chose not to.
Benchmarking data helps you understand performance and operational tar-
gets that are typical for the best-performing companies in an industry so that 
when you do an in-depth evaluation of a particular firm, you can see whether 
it’s on par with the best performers. The RMA (www.rmahq.org) provides 
this data to subscribers, but some libraries carry it.
Had Frank made this analysis early in the process, he would never have made 
an offer or certainly would’ve made a far smaller offer.

259
 Chapter 18: Case Study: Valuation on the Buy Side
Understanding Deal Structure
We give you a thorough overview on rules of thumb in Chapter 9 and tell you 
where this guidance may be useful. Keep in mind, though, that you can go 
very wrong with these rules of thumb, as Frank discovered.
If you’re trying to follow up on the hundreds of details involved in buying a 
business, you probably don’t have adequate time to do a thorough valuation, 
even if you’re properly trained to do one. If you get an industry rule of thumb 
or find out that businesses in this industry are trading for a certain multiple, 
you still won’t know exactly what the structure of that payment will be, 
which is known as the deal structure. Deal structure affects value.
Every one of the deals listed in the RMA benchmarking tables has a different 
structure. A certain amount of money comes in at closing in the form of cash; 
another portion of the overall price takes some other form, such as a seller 
note or stock. Sometimes, the form is contingent on future performance.
 
Just looking at a few transactions, the overall purchase price, and the 
resulting multiples on price to revenue or price to earnings doesn’t always 
give you an accurate picture. Valuation professionals who understand 
your industry can do a better job of zeroing in on the elements you need to 
build a deal.
The moral of the story is that a very deep analysis of any target company is 
necessary. Buyers must be willing to take the time to do research; they must 
have patience and the financial strength to place significant amounts of 
money upfront. Often, hiring an expert to take an unbiased, tough look at a 
proposed transaction can save you considerable money in the long run.

help when you feel that you’re out of your depth 
in any part of the valuation process. Because we think this 
point is so important, we decided to drive it home in this

▶ Establishing the business value in a divorce
▶ Finding out the importance of valuation dates
D
ivorce can be one of the biggest threats to the future of any closely held 
business, as well as to the people who depend on it.
When married business owners begin a divorce action, whether one party 
or both parties were involved in the day-to-day business, they set a series of 
financially threatening events into motion. Children, stepchildren, in-laws, 
business partners, and employees are affected by these events on both a 
short-term basis (the split of assets in divorce) and a long-term basis (the 
distribution of assets among multiple families at the time of a former 
spouse’s death).
In this chapter, we talk about prenuptial and postnuptial agreements, and we 
also discuss the role of business valuation during divorce proceedings.
Doing Estate Planning Regardless 
of Marital Status
In estate matters (see Chapter 20), it’s a good rule of thumb to review your 
plans every three years or whenever a material change in your family’s 
lifestyle occurs, such as a marriage, a divorce, a remarriage, the birth of 
children, the loss of an immediate family member, or a major rise or fall in 
assets.

264
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts
 
Planning for the future of a business isn’t just about the possibility of divorce. 
Proper discussion, documentation, and review of a family’s assets — with the 
participation of the right legal, tax, and financial planning advisors — can keep 
more of those assets in the family according to the family’s wishes.
In the case of a family business, generations of family members may have 
built careers there or otherwise depend on that income. Yet the business 
may not even be at the heart of an issue; families may have supported 
foundations or other charitable activities for years with a certain mission 
that the people in charge don’t want changed.
More than a few families have imploded in ugly legal squabbles over these 
situations and more. The results can be lengthy legal battles with damaging tax 
consequences, a potentially unfair split of assets among relatives, or simple 
mismanagement of those assets going forward.
One should consider all these issues with respect to valuation of the business. 
As you can see, divorce complicates everything, but it’s just one piece of 
a crowded puzzle of issues involving business valuation, family legacies, 
and money. In good times and bad, you need to think about all those issues 
together.
Planning Prenuptial and 
Postnuptial Agreements
If you watch any TV show with a lawyer in the lead role, or if you’re addicted 
to the divorce blotter in any gossip magazine, you probably know what a 
prenuptial agreement is. But in case you don’t, a prenuptial agreement — 
casually known as a prenup — is an agreement made and signed by two 
people before the wedding to establish financial ground rules during the 
marriage and to set clear courses of action for marital assets in case of death 
or divorce.
This chapter is about business valuation in case of a divorce, so why are we 
talking about prenuptial agreements? Because anyone who’s considering 
marriage while operating or planning to open a business should work with a 
future spouse to develop a prenuptial agreement. This agreement should set 
ground rules on the use and distribution of financial assets not only during 
the marriage but also at the end, either through divorce or death.
A prenup is not about when you’ll be sending the kids to bed or who will 
do the chores. Rather, a prenup ensures a financial balance of power in a 
relationship. Yes, the agreement is literally about the money, but it also may 
be about saving pain, heartache — and yes, money — if a relationship ends.

265
 Chapter 19: Divorce
 
Courts have a long history of looking closely at prenups, because in the past, 
they were often written in a way that clearly supported the wealthier spouse. 
Courts can invalidate a prenup, so make sure that both sides get the advice of 
talented matrimonial law, estate, and business valuation professionals before-
hand so that the document will be durable.
A postnuptial agreement sets out the same issues and conditions, with one 
critical difference: It’s made after the parties say “I do.” A couple without a 
prenup may consider a postnuptial agreement for a variety of reasons, but 
determining the future of a family business started either before or after the 
marriage is just as good a reason as any.
 
Doing a business valuation before the wedding is a good idea. If the marriage 
is preceded by a recent divorce, a business valuation from the divorce may be 
applicable. In any event, if the valuation is more than a year old, it should be 
updated. The new valuation should be attached to the balance sheet of the 
business and footnoted as part of the prenuptial record.
Breaking down a prenuptial agreement
Getting a spouse to sign off on a prenup isn’t much of a picnic, but creating a 
breakup agreement years after the honeymoon is an even greater challenge. 
The prenup process may not be easy to go through — creating a prenup 
agreement requires both sides to be very honest about how they feel about 
money — but it represents, at minimum, smart business planning and 
prescient thinking in case a divorce actually happens.
Here’s the full range of financial issues that a prenuptial agreement typically 
addresses:
 
✓ Which finances you’ll commingle and which ones you’ll keep separate: 
Depending on your state’s law governing assets accumulated during 
marriage — often called community property — a prenup can state exactly 
how you’ll split assets at the end. See the later section “State laws on 
splitting property” for details on how states regard ownership.
 
✓ How you’ll handle debt coming into the marriage: If one of you has 
(or both of you have) sizable personal or business debt coming into the 
marriage, you want to lay your cards on the table and address how that 
debt will be allotted in case of divorce.
 
 A good way to start the disclosure process before you start hammering 
out a prenup is to exchange credit reports — the reports issued by the 
main credit bureaus, Experian (www.experian.com), TransUnion 
(www.transunion.com), and Equifax (www.equifax.com). Looking at 
each other’s credit history may be the least romantic thing you ever do, 
but it’s a first, honest step toward a lifetime of transparency in all your 
financial dealings.

266
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts
 
✓ How you’ll provide for kids from previous marriages: The agreement 
isn’t just about the money or business assets you keep for yourselves; 
it’s also about making sure that your heirs keep what’s theirs.
 
✓ How you’ll keep family property in the family: This part of the agree-
ment is particularly important for family businesses intended for chil-
dren from previous marriages, but it also applies to homes and other 
forms of property. If property is important, you can and should desig-
nate its intended ownership in this legal document.
 
✓ How your estate goals will align with your other asset goals: A prenup 
is both a defensive document against divorce and an important support 
for the spouses’ respective estate plans. A prenup’s language should 
dovetail with both parties’ wills, trusts, and health directives.
 
 No important financial agreement is an island. Whether you’re talking 
about a prenup, a will, a trust, or a business ownership agreement, the 
agreement needs to complement your overall financial plans and goals. 
In other words, a prenup should address estate and business issues and 
vice versa.
 
✓ What both sides will get to keep at the time of divorce: A prenup can 
specify what each partner will get — and won’t get — in the event of 
divorce. Depending on the type of business assets and the spouses’ 
willingness to set a baseline value on business assets going into the 
marriage, a valuation may be done at that time.
 
 Prenups are all about the money — nothing else. If a prenup specifies 
when and where your spouse can go without you or how you’ll discipline 
the kids, these issues can’t be enforced in a court of law. Stick to the 
dollars.
 
✓ How money will be handled throughout the marriage: Are you going to 
file joint tax returns or separate returns that allocate particular income 
and deductions? What kind of bank accounts will you have, and who will 
pay the bills? Is there a plan for buying a house or a business together? 
A prenup can be as general or as specific about your financial affairs as 
you need it to be.
 
✓ What standard of value you’ll agree to use when you divorce: As we 
say throughout the book, the valuation method you choose is affected 
by many factors that are unique to you and your business. In general, 
family-law courts accept fair-market, intrinsic, or investment valuations 
(see Chapter 3). It makes sense to agree on value methodology at the 
start of a relationship to prevent an endless debate over methodology at 
the end.
 
✓ Full disclosure of all debts and assets as of the marriage date: Again, 
it’s wise to pull credit reports and other financial data at the beginning.

267
 Chapter 19: Divorce
 
✓ The status of any gifts or bequests you receive, either before or after 
marriage: A good example is a gift by one spouse’s parents of a down 
payment on a house. Is the gift to the couple or just to the donors’ child?
 
✓ The beneficiaries of all retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, pensions, 
and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), in the event of your death 
or divorce: This is particularly important if each individual in the marriage 
has children by the current relationship as well as children from former 
relationships.
 
✓ How you’ll handle the day-to-day living, college, and healthcare 
expenses of your kids: This can dictate behavior during the marriage as 
well as intended behavior after a divorce.
Events that void a prenup can depend on state law. In some situations, 
adultery can void a prenuptial agreement.
Creating a postnuptial agreement
A postnuptial agreement may not be a bad idea for a married couple who is 
starting a business together but has never addressed the subject of separating 
assets. To do these agreements well, you need two things:
 
✓ Truthfulness
 
✓ An experienced lawyer to represent your interests
Most states recognize postnups via statutes that allow married people to 
form contracts with each other. Keep in mind, however, that courts examine 
postnups as carefully as prenups (which we cover in the preceding section), 
because some judges believe that certain spouses have less bargaining power 
after they’re married and may be forced into signing such an agreement.
Seeking the Correct Professionals
Divorce is one of the most intense examples of when you need to blend the 
skills of a number of qualified experts. Remember, personal and business 
objectives are always linked, and in a highly emotional process like divorce, 
you need skilled professionals who have the ability to work with others. If 
your marriage is breaking up, you may need to consult some or all of the 
following experts and put them in touch with one another:

268
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts
 
✓ Valuation professional: This trained expert values the business based 
on the parameters you set, and your soon-to-be-ex-spouse may hire his 
or her own for the same purpose.
 
✓ Tax attorney: This legal expert may be among the first experts you consult 
about the potential tax ramifications of selling or splitting certain assets 
held jointly, or believed to have been held jointly, in the marriage.
 
✓ Divorce attorney: The best divorce attorneys act as ringmasters of all 
these professionals, blending the results of their work into a successful 
negotiation for a divorce settlement.
 
✓ Estate attorney: Divorce may be the endpoint of a marriage, but it can 
redirect your financial life and certainly the financial life of your heirs. 
An estate attorney has a distinct perspective on the valuation and tax 
questions inherent based on the interests of his or her client.
Looking at What Happens to a 
Family Business in Divorce
Deep emotional stress and clear thinking about money don’t mix. Divorce can 
spark some pretty colorful valuation scenarios based on what each spouse 
believes the business is worth. And after emotions spill over, arguments once 
confined at home can move into the office. For this reason, divorce may rank 
highest among the don’t-try-this-at-home scenarios.
Also, no clear standard of value exists in a divorce situation. (For a review 
of standards of value, see Chapter 3.) When couples split up and try to 
determine the value of shared assets in a company, one spouse may try to 
get the number as high as possible to boost his or her takeaway, whereas the 
other does everything possible to keep the valuation low so as not to lose too 
much of what he or she feels entitled to.
This situation can get to be very nasty, depending on the planning (or lack 
of planning) both spouses brought to the business during their marriage. 
But make no mistake: Divorce is just as big a triggering event in the life of a 
business as a natural disaster, an unwanted takeover, or the loss of a major 
customer.
In terms of valuation, divorce actions can spark a sudden need to do the 
following:
 
✓ Determine the continuing share of ownership in a company for one or 
both spouses who want to continue working in the family business.
 
✓ Set a breakup value for a company if the spouses end up liquidating and 
taking their splits with them.

269
 Chapter 19: Divorce
 
✓ Find ways to protect the estate of the founding family of the business 
against actions threatened by the in-law family.
 
✓ Take immediate action to calm customers, employees, and suppliers 
who fear that the divorce action will decimate the company.
Without an enforceable pre- or postnuptial agreement (see the pertinent 
sections earlier in this chapter), a family business is simply another asset in 
the marital estate that’s subject to distribution after a divorce, so we can’t 
overemphasize the importance of divorce planning before starting a business.
Business valuation gets tough during a divorce for the following reasons:
 
✓ Conflicting goals: Each company has complexity in terms of tangible 
assets such as cash, inventory, tools, fixtures, furniture, and machinery. 
But intangible issues — ranging from customer lists and patents to various 
forms of intellectual capital that one or both spouses contributed — 
may complicate matters even more. Even if a spouse didn’t get a weekly 
paycheck from the business, he or she may consider his or her non-
monetary support of the other spouse in building the business as 
entitlement to a significant portion of the value of the business.
 
✓ Questions about control: Depending on where the business is in its life 
cycle at the time of a divorce, the spouses may have young children 
who aren’t involved in the family business or adult children who have 
an ownership stake and already have careers in the business. Also, both 
spouses may be working in the business, though at different levels of 
seniority. If all adult family members have a stake in the company, they 
have a stake in the outcome of negotiations for its control.
 
✓ Inadequate basis for evaluation: Buy/sell agreements may be adequate 
to settle partnership issues, but courts tend not to look at those agree-
ments as the final word on the worth of a business, because they tend to 
serve the interests of the active owner of the business, not the divorcing 
spouse outside the business.
 
 If you’re interviewing divorce attorneys and tax professionals before a 
divorce proceeding, ask them whether they work with a certified business 
valuation professional who specializes in divorce. Though no one wants 
to end up in court, the best valuation experts in the divorce field not 
only know how to value assets in this situation but also understand state 
statutes with respect to both valuation and matrimonial law.
 
✓ Inadequate access to information: One of the most difficult aspects 
of valuing a private company involved in divorce is access to critical 
information that would help the nonactive or less-senior spouse in the 
business get a better idea of the health of the business. Although not 
all spouses hide information illegally, many wouldn’t choose to make it 
easy to find.

270

State laws on splitting property
Keep in mind that where you live matters in determining how property is 
divided in the event of divorce. Pay particular attention to your state law 
when developing pre- and postnuptial agreements. You need to work with 
qualified attorneys and valuation professionals who understand how the law 
will affect your assets and develop a negotiating strategy from there.
Community-property states
Do you live in Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, 
Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, or Puerto Rico? These areas of the country are 
known as community-property states. (Puerto Rico isn’t a state, of course, 
but it has the same law.) In a community-property state, each spouse owns an 
undivided one-half interest in most property acquired by a husband or wife 
during the course of a marriage.
For a business started before a marriage, community-property law isn’t 
necessarily a protection. Businesses tend to grow during a marriage, and 
unless the inactive spouse legally refuses a right to those assets through a 
prenuptial agreement or some other document, she or he is unlikely to be 
shut out.
If the spouse who wants to continue working in the business is challenged by 
the spouse who wants his or her share, the result can be the sale, shutdown, 
or dangerous leveraging of the company. Without planning and with significant 
acrimony, family legacies go down the drain all the time.
 
Here’s one more wrinkle: With women now earning the majority of college 
degrees and taking time out to rear families, more couples are starting 
businesses together. In 2002, MassMutual Financial Group and the Raymond 
Institute reported that husband-and-wife chief executive officers (CEOs) of 
family businesses increased from 8 percent in 1997 to 14 percent in 2002. Both 
spouses need to think seriously about property while the relationship is 
healthy.
Equitable-distribution states
No matter how much you plan and no matter how much you do to protect 
what you believe to be yours, state legislatures have put their own spin on 
what your settlement will eventually be. In certain cases, judges apply their 
own interpretation of what a fair distribution of assets should be.
In most states, property is classified as being either separate property or 
marital property. Separate property includes property owned before the 
marriage, inherited during the marriage, received as a gift during the marriage, 
or otherwise excluded from marital property by a prenuptial agreement. 
Marital property is all other property acquired during the marriage, no matter 
which spouse owns it.

271
 Chapter 19: Divorce
Nine U.S. states and one U.S. territory follow community-property law (see 
the preceding section), which essentially means that property or assets 
acquired by the husband or wife during the marriage (with the exception of 
certain inheritances and gifts) are owned 50/50 by the husband and wife.
In equitable-distribution states, all property, whenever or however it was 
acquired and regardless of its legal title, is subject to equal or unequal division. 
The definition is a bit of a wild card. In some states, if your spouse got a big 
inheritance before you walked down the aisle and he never touched those 
assets for family use or investment, a judge may have the right to divide 
those funds between the two of you. If you’re talking about a marriage 
that lasted only a year or two, you could be looking at a pretty unequal 
settlement — at least from the standpoint of the person giving up the money!
Wherever you live, your state’s divorce laws indicate specific factors that 
judges need to follow to make an equitable division of property or award of 
alimony. Some states also allow discretionary factors that allow judges more 
leeway in their decision-making. Following are some of these factors:
 
✓ The length of the marriage
 
✓ The ages, health, and occupations of both parties
 
✓ Lifestyle issues, including issues related to children
 
✓ Each party’s contribution to the marriage in terms of money issues 
(wages, investments, and so on) versus domestic contributions 
(homemaking, child rearing, and so on)
 
✓ The behavior of the parties during the marriage
 
✓ The employable skills of both parties
As you can see, judges do have a lot of power in the divorce-settlement 
process, so both parties in a divorce need to be aware of how state law will 
affect what they’re likely to keep in a divorce. That knowledge may influence 
valuation efforts during the divorce.
The marital balance of power
Justin L. Cherfoli, managing director of the Dispute Advisory and Forensic 
Services Group at Stout Risius Ross, a Chicago-based law firm, regularly 
works with both sides in a divorce — business owners and their spouses 
who aren’t active in the business. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that 
whoever controls the finances of a business holds all 52 cards in the deck, 
and they don’t give out more than they feel they have to,” Cherfoli says.
Those who aren’t on the side with the cards definitely need valuation 
expertise to counter any valuation estimate offered by the spouse who is 
active in the business. Cherfoli says that many valuation clients don’t always 

272
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts
like the results because valuation professionals are supposed to value the 
business independently and without bias — even if that means upsetting the 
person who’s paying the bill. “A valuation professional’s job is to provide an 
honest investigation and appraisal of the business. Sometimes a client may or 
may not be happy with the results,” Cherfoli says.
 
Valuation professionals have another excellent reason to focus on the 
valuation assignment and not the client’s wishes: They may have to defend 
their opinions in court. Many valuation professionals spend significant time in 
court defending valuations that clients hired them to do, and in some cases, 
the courts themselves hire valuation professionals to review situations 
independently before a judge or jury makes a decision.
Information — and the availability of it — separates a divorce business 
valuation from any other business valuation, according to Cherfoli. In a 
typical business valuation that’s aimed at a strategic purchase or sale, both 
sides are generally willing participants in the process, because they want a 
deal to happen — or at the moment, think they do.
In a divorce, however, the conflicts inherent in the breakup of the marriage 
tend to seep over into the business-valuation process. If the parties have an 
absence of trust, a possible corresponding absence of information will force 
the valuation professional to do more digging and investigation than she 
would have to do in a friendly situation.
Divorce valuations can be such a challenge that spouses outside the business 
may consider hiring a forensic accountant to determine whether information 
is legitimate or even available. (We discuss forensic accounting in detail in 
Chapter 17.)
 
If the business paid the nonactive spouse a salary, the court may want to 
know whether that spouse was paid fairly for his or her work, so it’s important 
to have an idea of what ordinary employees would be paid for such work. If 
the parties agree, or if a court rules that a spouse is due extensive back pay, 
that ruling is going to affect the overall settlement — and in some cases, the 
overall value of the business.
Determining the Business 
Value in a Divorce
People devote their lives to building companies, so they’re bound to have an 
attachment to the business that goes beyond simple numbers. As we say earlier 
in this chapter, valuing a business in divorce isn’t just about the present value of 
that business; it’s also about the growth prospects for that business and how the 
family will — or won’t — continue to be involved after the divorce.

273
 Chapter 19: Divorce
The following factors can establish the value of a business in a divorce 
situation:
 
✓ Loyalty to the business: Even if the spouses are no longer loyal to each 
other, one or both may still want to operate the business. Some people 
can go from being soul mates to being strictly business partners, but 
that transition requires serious planning and ground rules — financially, 
operationally, and personally.
 
✓ A desire to cash out and go: One spouse may just want to sell the 
business or negotiate a buyout so the departing spouse can use the cash 
to fund living expenses or possibly to start a new company.
 
✓ The need to take care of the kids: Whether the children in a divorce are 
toddlers or young adults, both parties in a divorce may seek valuation 
advice not only to address their immediate goals but also to make sure, 
if the business is going to continue, that it can support the children. If 
the business is not going to continue, proceeds from the sale of the 
company need to be invested for the kids’ education or other goals.
 
✓ Retirement issues: If one spouse has (or both spouses have) money tied 
up in the company’s pension plan, both parties must discuss what will 
happen to the plan if one spouse decides to remove his or her money or 
transfer it to another retirement vehicle.
Keeping Valuation Dates in Mind
One of the most critical considerations in divorce-related business valuations 
is the date on the calendar — not so much the date today but the date on 
which you and your soon-to-be-ex agree that you’re going to set the valuation 
for the business.
What’s the best date? Good question. Only you and your attorneys, tax 
advisors, and other experts can select good candidates. Ultimately, however, 
it’s your job to pick the valuation date, not a valuation professional’s.
Generally, your choices, which may be combined or averaged, are as follow:
 
✓ The date of your marriage
 
✓ The date of your legal separation
 
✓ The date you filed for divorce
 
✓ The date your divorce trial started (if you’re unfortunate enough to have 
to go to trial)

The date you agree on for the valuation of the business can lead to a 
tremendous advantage for one party and a disadvantage for the other. 
The right choice depends on both parties’ cash needs, tax situations, and 
nonmonetary issues that shaped the decision to divorce in the first place. 
If your spouse is getting a house — and the expenses of running that house 
while losing his or her job at the family company — you have a new set of 
financial circumstances to address.
 
If you’re working with a valuation expert, divorce attorneys need to advise 
that expert of the valuation date early in the game so she can work with the 
clearest information possible.
In a divorce scenario, the same methods are used to value a company. The 
only twist is that given the jurisdiction, the valuation professional may be 
directed to use a certain standard of value and/or valuation date, which 
would lead to a different conclusion of value than if the valuation were being 
done for some other purpose. In essence, however, the goal is the same as in 
most any other valuation: to determine what the value of the company would 
be if it were sold on the open market.
You often hear the phrase intrinsic valuation applied in a divorce largely 
because of the contributions that the spouses made to the business. The 
spouse who wants to retain control of the company may downplay certain 
aspects of intrinsic value — intellectual property that could yield huge 
product advancements later or a brand identity that’s just taking off, for 
example — because he or she doesn’t want to hand off too much value in 
the negotiation. That strategy isn’t illegal unless that spouse is deliberately 
hiding documents or other proof that this potentially large center of value 
exists. Intrinsic value implies having more proprietary knowledge of a 
company and its operations than an ordinary investor may possess. Good 
negotiators never want to give too much away.
By the way, it’s possible to oversell a company’s intrinsic value. This fact is 
what makes business valuation an art as well as a science (a topic that we 
discuss in Chapter 3).

W
hen a company plans for any kind of ownership transition, business 
valuation needs to be part of the process. If the company is changing 
hands between strangers or nonfamily members, both sides have a certain 
idea of value that they want to confirm before the negotiation starts. Settling 
on a price only after a thoughtful and thorough analysis of what the company 
is actually worth makes sense.
Surprisingly often, however, valuation is neglected when a business asset 
is passed down within a family. Often, a patriarch builds a company from 
scratch, runs it his way, and expects family members to take the operation 
blithely into its second and third generations without giving any thought to 
the real value — or possible lack of value — of what he’s built. The owner’s 
perception of value may not match his children’s perceptions or the perception 
of the marketplace. This lack of objectivity — or at least reluctance to bring 
in an objective expert to value the business — causes many businesses to 
shut down or go up for sale before they make it to the next generation.
If a founder is passing down his company to his kids, both sides — the 
founder and the heirs — are wise if they insist on an independent and early 
valuation process to get an idea not only of what the business is worth but 
also of the tax implications of the transfer.
Proper estate planning requires the entire family to do something that most 
families find quite difficult: leaving egos, history, and emotions at the door as 
they determine what their business assets are really worth. In this chapter, 
we discuss succession and estate planning, gifting, and valuation as it relates 
to buy/sell agreements.

Succession Planning: A Critical 
Part of Business Planning
We talk about exit plans in many valuation situations for a reason: Exits are 
common facts of life, whether or not business founders want to admit their 
existence and certainly whether or not the founders want them to happen. 
Founders die in the prime of life, business partners get sick of working 
together, and kids decide they don’t want the family business. Economic and 
industrial realities change, and suddenly, founders are forced to survive in 
ways that they hadn’t planned.
Exits can — and should — be planned, and business valuation is a critical 
part of exit planning (for more on exit planning, turn to Chapter 2). But exit 
planning is tough to do. Most business founders are too tied up in the day-
to-day activities of running the business to spend a lot of time thinking about 
how to pass on the business to children or employees.
Think about the ending in the most positive way possible: in terms of the 
startup and continuation of the business.
Considering Family Matters
Family businesses typically are small businesses — companies with annual 
revenue well under $1 million. The business revenue may feed and clothe a 
houseful of immediate family members and relatives, as well as educate them 
and provide them with summer jobs and full-time careers.
Family businesses, however, aren’t forever. Only 30 percent of family businesses 
are passed down to the next generation. These closely held businesses often 
fail to outlive their founders. Add that fact to the threat of estate taxes and 
the job of finding competent managers and employees inside and outside the 
family to keep the business going, and you can see why business survival is 
such a challenge.
Anticipating problems
Challenges in passing the family business to the next generation can involve 
anything from tax issues and founder reluctance to family conflicts and 
drama. Succession planning and valuation are necessary parts of estate 
planning if the founder wants the business to continue.

277
 Chapter 20: Estate Planning and Gifting
Thorough planning can help owners anticipate and avert problems that can 
threaten the business over time, such as the following:
 
✓ Personal conflicts: Siblings or other family members who always had 
a role in the business may resent the people who haven’t but who still 
believe they’re entitled to an ownership stake. Estate planning and 
valuation can provide a basis for open discussion within the family 
and allow the founder to outline an equitable division that won’t be a 
surprise to the parties involved.
 
 Also, relationships forged in childhood don’t always translate into 
effective working relationships in a shared business concern.
 
✓ Marriage: A marriage may occur after the business is launched. Estate 
planning becomes an ever-widening activity after this event, because 
new spouses or children may — or may not — be considered to be heirs 
to the estate.
 
✓ Divorce: Divorce breaks up more than a few family businesses (see 
Chapter 19 for info). After a divorce, a new estate plan needs to address 
which family members — or former family members — will inherit the 
estate. Both parties in a divorce frequently do valuation if a family 
business is involved as a prime asset.
 
✓ Death: When a founder dies, a family can go to war for reasons far more 
emotional than economical.
 
No estate or succession plan should be made without a commitment to 
reevaluation when major life or business events happen. Death, incapacita-
tion, marriage, divorce, mergers, sales of divisions, and departures of key 
executives are good triggers for revisiting an estate plan to make sure that it 
properly represents the wishes of the business owner.
Considering blended and 
nontraditional families
Fifty years ago, planning for the future of a multigenerational business — 
businesses in which several generations of a family participated at all 
levels — was a complicated task in its own right. Usually, though, all the 
people involved were blood relatives.
 
The U.S. Census Bureau reports that blended families and stepfamilies are 
common in America today. Roughly 50 percent of all first marriages end in 
divorce, but the breakup rate for second marriages is even higher: more than 
60 percent. At the same time, the number of stepfamilies is growing. Between 
1980 and 1990, the number of stepfamilies increased 36 percent, according to 
the National Center for Health Statistics.

278
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
In addition, more families are being built by same-sex couples, through 
adoption, and by extended-family members living under the same roof and 
often working together in the same business. All these constituencies have an 
interest in valuation, and owners need to prepare for it.
Failure to plan may mean that family members who made recent and 
meaningful contributions to the business may not be recognized in terms of 
ownership or responsibility. It’s not uncommon for successive spouses to 
resist sharing assets with the minor or adult children of a deceased spouse’s 
previous marriage or marriages.
 
Same-sex couples need to do extensive planning for the safety and continuance 
of a family business. It’s particularly important to select an estate attorney 
who can not only craft conventional wills and health power-of-attorney 
documents but also create designation-of-agent documents for issues such as 
hospital visitation rights, funeral arrangements, and possession of personal 
property.
Multigenerational planning should also address estate and child-custody 
arrangements for unmarried heterosexual or gay couples who may not have 
done the appropriate legal planning necessary to secure the estates of their 
current or past partners and heirs. At the very least, all family members 
should understand the need for such planning to prevent conflict later. As 
nontraditional families become more common, business owners need to be 
open to estate discussions that consider all these family members.
Creating contingency plans 
for relatives who renege
“Mom, I don’t want the business” is a phrase that has been uttered in more 
than a few family-owned companies, sometimes years after the person who 
says it made that business his career. If a founder is lucky, she’s alive to hear 
it and can rethink her succession, transfer, or sale plans.
But for any number of reasons, such decisions may be made after the 
business owner’s funeral, when children, siblings, and in-laws finally settle 
into the reality that the responsibility for the future of the company is theirs 
and theirs alone. People can and do change their minds about whether they 
want a family legacy to continue. Business owners always need to have a Plan 
B for other owners and family members to put in place if next-generation 
leadership decides not to lead.

279
 Chapter 20: Estate Planning and Gifting
Valuation isn’t just about bricks and mortar and the machinery on the shop 
floor; it’s also about management talent and vision. People do matter in the 
valuation of a business. A prodigal son may finally be put in charge and 
realize that he really doesn’t want the job. Smart owners need to consider 
that possibility in their estate plans if they want to ensure a financial future 
for other family members and employees.
In Chapter 24, we talk about employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), 
which are among the options founders may build into their estate-planning 
strategies. Business founders create an ESOP as a way to pull assets out of a 
business while securing the business’s future into the next generation.
Creating a Succession Plan
You often hear that a solid succession plan needs to go into effect three to 
five years before a founder leaves. But any time an estate plan is written or 
updated, it makes sense to think through — and put in writing, if possible — 
an updated succession plan.
In the best scenario for a small business, succession planning should be one 
of the most important activities under the business-planning umbrella. This 
planning should start as early as possible, but later-stage planning comes 
closer to the founder’s retirement, when she has a better picture of the 
company’s management and financial health and can decide whether the 
company should continue with the next generation or be sold.
Here are the key steps involved in creating a succession plan:
 
1. Spend some time thinking about family dynamics.
 
 As an owner, you need to consider the family before you consider 
the business. At a certain point, it’s important to consider whether 
personality conflicts at home can spill over into the work environment.
 
2. Bring in a valuation professional early.
 
 Develop a baseline valuation for the business to get a preview of 
whether you can do anything to minimize the tax impact of transferring 
assets to your heirs.
 
3. Consider possible successors.
 
 You have to decide which members of the family to put in charge. You 
need to know whether multiple members of the next generation can 
work together and what provisions you can make for those who don’t 
want to be involved but deserve a slice of the family assets.

280
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
 
4. Train the possible successors.
 
 You may want to start a formal training program for the relatives you 
want to put in positions of leadership. This program may involve giving 
these relatives apprenticeships in the company or possibly paying for 
them to get undergraduate or graduate training in business or a field 
specific to a strength needed inside the firm.
 
5. Make the choice.
 
 This step is about making the tough final decision about which family 
member (or nonfamily member) will succeed you in your job and which 
contenders will take lesser roles.
 
6. Make the ownership transfer.
 
 This step is where the legal and tax considerations come in. You may be 
able to blunt the tax impact by selling or gifting shares of the business to 
children during times when share values are low. (For more information 
on gifting, see the “Taking Gifting into Consideration” section, later in 
this chapter.)
Creating an Estate Plan
Estate planning is a combination of personal wealth planning and strategic 
planning for the business. It anticipates and answers questions such as the 
following:
 
✓ If the founder dies or becomes incapacitated, who will run the business, 
and under what circumstances?
 
✓ If no family member wants to run the business, how will it be disposed of?
 
✓ Are wills and choices of executor and trustees in place for personal 
assets?
 
✓ What plans are in place to gift or dispose of certain assets to family 
members to reduce the estate-tax hit?
Founders shouldn’t address these issues in a vacuum. In addition to enlisting 
the help of experts (see the section titled “Finding the Experts You Need for 
Estate Planning,” later in this chapter), business founders need to talk with 
their spouses and other key members of the family who are employed in the 
business (such as children, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews) to get an 
idea of how they feel about the following issues:
 
✓ How to continue the business after the founder retires or dies
 
✓ Which family member should be elevated to replace the founder of the 
business after he leaves that post

281
 Chapter 20: Estate Planning and Gifting
 
✓ What kind of estate and succession plans would be good for the next 
generation
 
✓ Which designated events in the life of the founder or the business call 
for a valuation to take place
 
✓ How in-laws who are involved in the business should share in the assets
 
✓ How minor children should share in the assets
 
✓ How spouses and former spouses (depending on divorce agreements) 
should be treated at the time of the owner’s death
 
✓ How to continue or change any philanthropic activities set in place by 
the owner
 
Founders have to realize that an estate plan isn’t an attempt to control a 
company or a family from beyond the grave. When a powerful person dies, the 
death creates a vacuum that eventually has to be filled. With the right outlook, 
planning, and communication in building that estate plan, however, the 
founder communicates a vision for the firm that the next generation will want 
to embrace while adding their own ideas to improve what the founder created.
Finding the Experts You Need 
for Estate Planning
One key reason to bring in valuation professionals for business estate matters 
is to get a measure of potential tax consequences for those who will inherit 
the family business. Here are the experts that business owners should 
consider bringing in as a team to ensure proper estate planning as well as 
proper valuation:
 
✓ Accountants/auditors: These professionals help ensure that thorough, 
professionally prepared tax records exist over a period of years for the 
business. Income and spending need to be documented and verified. 
Annual tax data is critical for pointing out estate-planning issues that 
owners need to watch, and it sets the stage for accurate, in-depth 
valuation.
 
✓ Valuation professionals: As long as you ensure confidentiality, you 
should keep in touch with trusted, skilled appraisers and other valuation 
experts during the life of a business. They can keep you abreast of ways 
to maximize the value of your firm.
 
✓ Estate attorneys: Attorneys are the primary legal experts involved in 
creating a combined personal/business estate plan. They know the 
laws and procedures related to estate matters, and if they aren’t also 
Certified Public Accountants (as some estate attorneys are), they work 
closely with CPAs who specialize in estate matters.

282
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
 
✓ Financial planners/advisors: A trained and certified financial planner 
can be the quarterback in a long-term estate-planning strategy.
 
✓ Divorce/family-law attorneys: Involving a divorce or family-law attorney 
is critical if the founder has children or other heirs from a previous 
marriage.
See Chapter 7 for tips on finding and hiring the correct professionals in the 
valuation process.
Fitting Buy/Sell Agreements into 
Estate Planning and Valuation
Creating a buy/sell agreement isn’t estate planning per se, but it should be 
coordinated with an estate plan to make sure that transactional issues in 
a business coordinate with the intentions set forth in a partner or owner’s 
estate plan.
A buy/sell agreement creates an infrastructure for setting the value of a 
business for estate-tax purposes and improves your estate’s liquidity by 
ensuring a ready market for your business upon your death. Such an agreement 
also protects your business partners from having to share ownership with a 
deceased stockholder’s family.
Buy/sell agreements come in two flavors:
 
✓ Cross-purchase: In an insurance-funded cross-purchase arrangement, 
each business owner buys an insurance policy on the other, naming 
the other as the beneficiary. At the death of one of the owners, the 
surviving owner receives tax-free insurance proceeds to use to purchase 
the deceased owner’s stock from her estate.
 
✓ Stock-redemption: In an insurance-funded stock-redemption arrangement, 
the corporation purchases the stock of a deceased shareholder. In this 
situation, the business is the owner and beneficiary of life insurance 
policies on each shareholder. A partnership looking for a business 
continuation plan may use a similar arrangement, called an entity 
purchase.
You can find more information on buy/sell agreements in Chapter 23.

283
 Chapter 20: Estate Planning and Gifting
Taking Gifting into Consideration
As business assets are passed down from one generation to the next, the tax 
hit can be huge. For this reason, some estate planners urge you to consider 
various gifting strategies as part of a comprehensive estate plan.
Gifting is exactly what it sounds like: You make a gift of your assets to friends 
and relatives over the course of time to bring down the level of your assets 
so that your heirs won’t be clobbered as badly by estate taxes when you die.
 
Gifting shouldn’t be an automatic decision. It requires the help of a trained tax 
advisor.
Gifting strategies
People can choose from a variety of options to give away money and assets 
in a way that will serve the company and family:
 
✓ Using life insurance trusts: An irrevocable life insurance trust can keep 
the proceeds of the insurance out of your taxable estate. An added 
benefit is that such trusts may permit spousal access to the cash value 
of the policy. Note, however, that the trust is irrevocable — the decision 
can’t be changed.
 
✓ Planning for increasing assets: A grantor-retained annuity trust (GRAT) 
is an irrevocable trust that’s popular among families with assets that are 
expected to increase, because such appreciation can be passed on to 
heirs with minimal tax consequences.
 
✓ Gifting to grandkids: The federal generation-skipping transfer tax 
(GSTT) taxes transfers of property that you make, either during life or 
after death, to someone who is more than one generation below you, 
such as a grandchild. The GSTT is imposed in addition to — not rather 
than — federal gift or estate taxes. You need to be aware of the GSTT 
if you make cumulative generation-skipping transfers in excess of the 
GSTT exemption, which was $2 million in 2008. A flat tax equal to the 
highest estate-tax bracket in effect in the year in which you make the 
transfer is imposed on every transfer you make after your exemption 
has been exhausted. Note that some states also impose their own GSTT.

284
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
Successful business owners need to think about a lifetime gifting strategy. The 
generation-skipping transfer tax is one approach to this idea, but depending 
on what happens with the estate-tax forecast in 2009 and beyond, a low-rate 
environment may make it a good idea to take full advantage of these strategies.
Gifting techniques
You should consider — and in appropriate situations, implement — gifting 
techniques that leverage the lifetime exemption. We discuss some of these 
techniques in the following sections.
Intrafamily loans
With an intrafamily loan, the business owner can lend money to the transferee 
(a person, trust, or business entity), with the loan being documented by a 
promissory note bearing interest at the applicable federal rate (AFR). The 
borrower can use this loan to pay down higher-rate debt or make investments 
that are expected to achieve a rate of return higher than the AFR. Any returns 
in excess of the AFR are retained by the borrower free of gift or estate tax.
GRATs
In a grantor-retained annuity trust (GRAT), the business owner transfers 
assets to a trust for a certain period. During the term of the trust, the grantor 
receives an annuity payment, at least annually, of either a fixed dollar amount 
or a fixed percentage of the fair-market value of the property placed in the 
trust. The interest rate used to calculate the annuity payment is the applicable 
federal rate (AFR). At the end of the trust term, any remaining principal is 
distributed to the trust beneficiaries.
Installment sales to IDGTs
Intentionally defective grantor trusts (IDGTs) are similar to GRATs. IDGT assets 
are sold by the owner to a trust in return for an installment note that bears 
interest at the AFR. The note may provide for installment payments over a 
specified period, or it may provide for annual interest-only payments with a 
balloon payment of principal payable at the end of the term. Any income and 
appreciation on the trust assets exceeding the payments required to satisfy 
the note belong to the trust beneficiaries free of estate or gift tax at the end 
of the trust term. The owner pays no tax on his gain from the sale of assets 
to the trust and is responsible for paying income tax on the future income 
earned by the trust — a benefit to the trust beneficiaries that is not treated 
as an additional gift by the grantor.

285
 Chapter 20: Estate Planning and Gifting
 
Under current law, the federal estate tax is scheduled to change as follows:
 
✓ 2009: $3.5 million exemption, 45 percent tax rate
 
✓ 2010: No estate tax
 
✓ 2011 and beyond: $1 million exemption, 55 percent tax rate
How the estate tax was born
According to the Washington, D.C.–based 
Heritage Foundation, the tradition of taxing assets 
at the time of death began with the Stamp Act of 
1797, which required a federal stamp on wills in 
probate. The revenue was used to pay off debt 
during the undeclared naval war with France in 
1794. The Stamp Act was repealed in 1802.
For the next hundred years, estate taxes were 
used on a sporadic basis to finance wars, 
and when peacetime came, such taxes were 
repealed. But after the turn of the 20th century, 
the modern sales tax emerged, along with 
another tax we note with fondness: federal 
income tax.
The Revenue Act of 1916 contained an estate 
tax with many features of today’s system. 
After an exemption of $50,000 — equal today 
to roughly $11 million — tax rates started at 1 
percent and climbed to 10 percent on estates 
of more than $5 million (more than $1 billion in 
terms of today’s wealth).
Estate taxes were increased in 1917 as the United 
States entered World War I. This time, when the 
war ended, the tax stayed. Even though the coun-
try had a budget surplus, Congress increased 
rates and introduced a gift tax in 1924. Like the 
estate tax, the gift tax is a levy on the transfer of 
property from one person to another.
From the 1920s through the 1940s — the 
Depression years — estate taxes were used as 
a way to redistribute income. Tax rates of up to 
77 percent on the largest estates were supposed 
to prevent wealth from becoming increasingly 
concentrated in the hands of a few.
Lawmakers went back to work on the estate tax 
during the 1960s and 1970s. By 1976, the previously
separate exemptions for estate and gift taxes 
were transformed into a single unified estate 
and gift tax credit.
By 1981, the top rate went from 70 percent to 50 
percent, and an increase in the unified credit 
took a lot of smaller estates — those under 
$600,000 — off the tax rolls.
In 1997, Congress made the first increase in the 
unified credit since 1987. Gradual increases, 
which began in 1999, raised the unified credit 
to $1 million by 2006.
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief 
Reconciliation Act of 2001 was the first step 
toward eliminating the death tax. It provided for 
a scheduled phase-out of rates and an increase 
in the unified credit, finally repealing the tax for 
calendar year 2010. Those provisions sunset in 
2011 with a return to the 1997 levels of a top rate 
of 55 percent and a unified credit of $1 million.

286
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
CLATs
A charitable lead annuity trust (CLAT) provides for the payment of a fixed 
dollar amount to one or more charitable beneficiaries for a specified period, 
at least annually, regardless of the income generated by the CLAT. At the end 
of the term, the remaining assets of the trust pass to individual beneficiaries. 
The trust may be established for a term of years or based on the lives of 
the people living at the time of the trust’s creation. Gift leverage is obtained 
because the reportable value of the gift at the creation of the CLAT is the 
fair-market value of the assets placed in the trust less the present value of the 
annuity.

E
very owner of a young company needs good advice to prepare him for 
the many stages of investment that will eventually take his business to 
the desired size as a private company or all the way to public ownership.
Particularly in the technology arena, many business owners work hard to 
solicit financing to help their companies grow at very fast rates. But because 
proving value in new companies that may not yet be producing much in 
revenue and profit is difficult, you need outside expertise.
In many ways, the process of attracting outside investors is not much 
different from the process of bringing in a conventional buyer or banker. 
Even if you started your company in a garage or a basement, you have 
to present it as an organized company, with transparent operations and 
finances, to any potential buyers, investors, or lenders; otherwise, they just 
won’t care.
This chapter outlines the importance of getting valuation expertise when 
starting a business and the areas in which you should use outside help.

Exploring Your Startup Resources
We emphasize throughout this book that no two valuation professionals 
analyze the value of a business in exactly the same way. When you’re talking 
about a startup, you’re talking about a particular valuation challenge because 
startups may not produce revenues, much less profits, for months and 
possibly years.
For this reason, you should network with experienced investors in startup 
companies similar to yours to get an idea of what they look for in fledgling 
companies. If some of these investors are successful at sniffing out values in 
new business ideas, you should find these people, listen to their advice, and 
then start building your company to produce the most value you can.
You can take several steps before you start chasing investors. The Ewing 
Marion Kauffman Foundation’s Angel Capital Education Foundation 
(www.kauffman.org) publishes a host of startup resources. One of these 
resources is the Valuation Worksheet, which follows. It serves as a general 
guide to the startup valuation process.
The worksheet asks you to evaluate three aspects of a company — the 
strength of the management team, the size of the opportunity, and the com-
petitive landscape — and it lists percentages to help you assign a weight to 
each question. The questions represent the factors and issues impacting 
the valuation of a pre-revenue startup company (a company that hasn’t yet 
begun to bring in revenue).

Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
Seeing How Valuation Professionals 
Work with Startups
When a valuation professional gets involved in valuing a startup, the analysis 
centers on a discounted cash-flow methodology under the income approach 
to valuation. (For a review of all the professionals who may get involved in 
the valuation process, see Chapter 7.)
In essence, the valuation professional is trying to determine a future valuation of 
the company so that the entrepreneurs, angel investors, venture capitalists, 
and so on have some idea how much equity they should have in the startup, 
given their investment and the corresponding return on investment (ROI). 
(For definitions of investor types, see the section “Working with Investors,” 
later in this chapter.)
Valuation terms you hear in a startup
The world of startup investing has its own 
valuation language. Here are some of the terms 
you may hear:
 ✓ Pre-revenue startup: A business that’s 
burning through cash in its accounts because 
it hasn’t yet begun to bring in revenue
for the product that it plans to sell; it may 
have an office in place and a prototype but 
nothing that’s bringing in cash; some investors
see this type of company as a problem, 
whereas others see it as an opportunity
 ✓ Pre-money value: A company’s value 
before it receives outside financing or the 
latest round of financing
 ✓ Post-money value: A company’s value 
after outside financing or the latest round 
or injection of equity funding
 ✓ Divergence: The difference between the 
growth rate of the company’s valuation 
and the valuation of the shares investors 
receive because of dilution by subsequent 
investors and other factors
 ✓ Full dilution: This counts not only the shares 
that have been issued but also all shares 
that would be issued if all options and war-
rants were exercised and other promises 
or contingent agreements to issue shares 
were given effect
 ✓ Terminal value: The valuation of the com-
pany at exit — that is, the proceeds of the 
sale of the company via a merger, acquisi-
tion, or an IPO, at which time the investors’ 
ownership can be liquidated
 ✓ ROI: The return expected for such an invest-
ment when the investors expect to get their 
money out

291
 Chapter 21: Attracting Outside Investors to Your Startup
The process is very similar to the discounted cash-flow technique used to 
value a mature business. The major difference lies in the discount and 
capitalization rates. A company that isn’t producing substantial revenue and/
or profit, that lacks the necessary infrastructure to take the company to 
the next level, and that doesn’t have the next generation of technology in 
development is inherently more risky for angel investors or venture capitalists. 
After all, if it weren’t more risky, the entrepreneur could simply go to a bank 
for financing.
Creating the Starting Point: 
The Business Plan
This book is about business valuation, not starting a business. For infor-
mation on that topic, you can check out Small Business For Dummies, 3rd 
Edition, by Eric Tyson, MBA, and Jim Schell (Wiley); Accounting For Dummies, 
4th Edition, by John A. Tracy, CPA (Wiley); or Franchising For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, by Michael Seid and Dave Thomas (Wiley). Even so, an appreciation 
for business valuation starts with a business plan.
If you want people to invest in your business, or if you need bank loans, you 
need a business plan. Consider a business plan to be a calling card for your 
new business, and keep the emphasis on the issue of value at every stage.
The standard business plan runs anywhere from 10 to 30 pages and contains 
the following elements:
 
✓ Executive summary: An executive summary should be no longer than 
one page. It sums up the business, its products and services, and its 
risks, opportunities, target strategies, competition, finances, and pro-
jected ROI.
 
 The summary includes the first words anyone will read, but write it after 
you create the rest of the document. Doing so ensures that you’re clear 
on the full thrust of the document so you can better summarize it in 
front.
 
✓ Mission statement: This one- or two-sentence statement describes the 
culture of your business and its goals.
 
✓ Business concept: Here, you explain the business that you want to 
finance and the technology, concept, or strategy on which it’s based.

292
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
 
✓ Management team: List the chief executive officer (CEO) and key members 
of management by name, experience, and — very importantly — past 
successes.
 
✓ Industry analysis: This section provides an informed overview of 
market share, leadership, players in the market, market shifts, costs, 
pricing, or competition that provides the opportunity for the new 
company’s success.
 
✓ Competition: In this section, you outline the competitive challenges you 
face and how you plan to defeat them.
 
✓ Goals and objectives: This section — essentially, a three- to five-year 
plan — requires you to outline measurable objectives for market share, 
revenue, profitability, and value.
 
✓ Day-to-day operations: Here, you describe staffing plans, training, and 
other personnel-related issues. This section also talks about business-
support activities, such as advertising and marketing.
 
✓ Financing: This detailed section explains what you have to invest and 
what you need from lenders. Most importantly, it explains how long you 
expect to take to pay back those lenders.
 
✓ Appendix: This section contains tax returns and any other third-party 
information that tells prospective investors more about the business.
 
You’re not writing a business plan for insiders; you’re writing it for 
outsiders. You’re writing it to sell the concept of the company to people who 
are willing to sink money into it — lenders, investors, customers, and suppliers. 
They’re your audience, and you have to sell your value proposition to them.
Working with Investors
Valuation is a contentious subject in any business transaction, but startups 
are particularly controversial because assets are either undeveloped or 
nonexistent. Some companies are in operation for a year or more and never 
bring in a dime of revenue because they’re too engaged in product development 
and early work to build clientele.
The search for money to fuel a new operation can be almost as big of a job 
as getting the company operating on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, in the 
art-versus-science discussion of valuation, the startup world presents some 
rather massive challenges.

293
 Chapter 21: Attracting Outside Investors to Your Startup
In this section, we discuss the three primary types of investors who typically 
deal with startup and young companies:
 
✓ Angel investors
 
✓ Venture capitalists
 
✓ Investors in an initial public offering (IPO)
How do you find these sources of capital? If you’re truly familiar with the 
industry in which you’re planning to start a business, you’ll have done your 
homework trying to determine how companies like yours are best funded. If 
not, you need to focus on research. Here are some primary ways to find out 
where to start researching such investors:
 
✓ Industry associations: These organizations bring together people 
working in the same industry. Read their publications, visit their Web 
sites, and talk with their members not only to find out more about the 
industry you plan to work in but also to discover about how other 
business owners financed their startups.
 
✓ Angel investor directories: These directories provide you with names 
of angel investors all over the country. Inc. magazine publishes an online 
directory (www.inc.com/articles/2001/09/23461.html) through 
which you can find out the kind of companies these investors are interested 
in supporting. We talk more about angel investors in the next section.
 
✓ Local business groups: Industry associations are typically national 
groups, but if you live in an area that contains a number of businesses in 
your chosen industry, you may be able to use local business groups as a 
way to find the right kind of investor for you.
 
Pre-money valuation refers to the valuation of a company prior to investment 
or other form of financing. Angel investors and venture capitalists use pre-
money valuation to determine how much ownership or equity they’ll demand 
from the company in exchange for their investments.
Angel investors
An angel investor provides capital to one or more startup companies. Usually, 
she’s a wealthy person who likes to dabble in young businesses with great 
potential.

294
Part V: Don’t Try This at Home! Turning Things Over To the Valuation Experts 
Most new businesses tap friends and family members for early seed money. 
This early money — and your handling of it — can make your business more 
attractive to angel investors if you have a hot idea and the talent to bring it 
forward. Angels, as they’re often called, tend to be the first rung of outside 
financing for companies that hope to go to the next stage: expanding product 
distribution, starting advertising and promotion campaigns, or expanding 
staff.
Sometimes, you can find angels by word of mouth in your industry. Some 
angels pool their resources with other angels and make their funding 
decisions in a group. Like venture capitalists (see the following section), who 
are much bigger fish, angels like to see not only good road shows but also 
solid presentations and figures by the eager entrepreneurs they meet.
Angels focus on the youngest companies because these investors usually 
aren’t in the game for big money; they come in with thousands of dollars, not 
millions. Most individual angels invest no more than $100,000 (most often, 
less than $30,000). According to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the 
typical combined angel contribution is around $1 million to $3 million.
On average, angels buy 20 to 40 percent of a company’s equity and seek a 
return of 20 to 30 times their investment over five years.
 
The best angels don’t just hand over a check; they’re also good sounding 
boards and teachers. Make sure you pick a good angel investor who has much 
to teach you about building a company.
Venture capitalists
A venture capitalist (VC) is similar to an angel investor in that he (or a firm 
created to make venture capital investments) wants to put his money in 
promising companies for big returns. Generally, a VC comes after angel 
financing and may be the final stage of private investment. The minimum 
investment by VCs is $1 million, and these investors are more hands-on than 
angel investors in their relationships with new firms. VCs typically want a 
formal advisory role with new companies, usually as board members.
Getting VC financing brings you one step closer to the big leagues: public 
ownership. These investors finance companies that haven’t had the value of 
their stock tested in the public markets.

295
 Chapter 21: Attracting Outside Investors to Your Startup
VCs look at companies that have made it through the self-investment or 
angel stage with considerable promise but many unknowns. These companies 
may have a great business concept, but they also may have untested 
management, unknown customer response, and other aspects that make 
valuation tougher — not the least of which is lack of profit.
 
As you create your business plan (refer to the “Creating the Starting Point: 
The Business Plan” section earlier in this chapter), your job is to work with 
experts in finance to value your potential business and markets properly. 
Venture capitalists want to know that you’re paying proper attention to 
valuing your company reliably. After all, to invest in your company, they need 
to understand its value, and most importantly, they need to know that you 
understand its value.
IPO investors
For entrepreneurs, angel investors, venture capitalists, and ordinary investors, 
an initial public offering (IPO) is a fancier phrase for something that tantalizes 
everyone: a big payday. The IPO is the first sale of stock to the public. 
You’ve probably read business stories that contain phrases such as “highly 
anticipated IPO.”
 
Google was one such IPO that had investors licking their lips in 2004, even at a 
relatively high offering price of $85 a share. Was the Google IPO worthwhile? 
Despite a market turndown, during the writing of this book, Google stock was 
trading above $300 a share.
Business valuation continues into the pricing process for companies that go 
into the public markets after early angel financing and one or more rounds of 
VC financing.
Traditional valuation procedures don’t always work for an IPO, because 
virtually all valuation is based on the future of the business — not on the 
present. You can’t value an IPO based on its book or liquidation value, except 
for the purpose of establishing a floor price for the business.
Obviously, if you’re talking about a startup, it’s going to be a while before 
you’re ready for that IPO. Still, an IPO may well be in your future. At each 
stage of investment, you need experts who understand valuation at that 
stage.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part is called The Part of Tens because each of 
these chapters offers ten points of interest on critical 
topics we introduce throughout the book. This part gives 
you a chance to get a little more familiar with these 
issues. In this part, we spell out reasons to consider a 
prenuptial agreement, things to build into a partnership 
agreement, and things to consider before transforming a 
conventional business into an employee stock ownership 
plan (ESOP).

Chapter 22
Ten Reasons to Consider a Prenup
In This Chapter
▶ Defusing money fights during a marriage
▶ Using a solid agreement to protect family members’ jobs in case of a divorce
▶ Preserving a family’s financial and business legacy
▶ Linking today’s prenup to tomorrow’s business valuation if there’s a divorce
▶ Keeping all the money from going to the accountants and lawyers
A
h, love and marriage — they go together like a horse and carriage, as 
the old song goes. But love, marriage, and money? You just never hear 
much about dollars and cents in a love song, unless it’s in some twangy old 
country song about love gone wrong.
But what if a worldwide law forced new-spouses-to-be to sit down at a table 
for a few days with smart legal and tax advisors who’d force them to share 
credit reports, bank and brokerage accounts, and most importantly, their 
feelings about money and what they want to do with it for the rest of their 
lives?
That doesn’t sound like a bad idea, does it? How many couples do you 
know who talked extensively about money before they got hitched? If you 
answered, “the divorced ones!” that’s just what we wanted to hear.
Prenuptial agreements are a way to sort out financial issues before a marriage 
starts so that a couple knows what they have and where they’re going with it. 
Even if one spouse doesn’t own a business before the wedding, this subject is 
important to consider if one of them wants to start one later.
Why does a book about business valuation even mention this subject? 
Have you ever read a news story about a celebrity divorce and murmured to 
yourself, “There goes her money down the drain”? Prenuptial planning is 
good business planning — when done correctly, both sides have an exit plan 
that may not minimize pain but does go a long way toward fighting uncertainty. 
So without further ado, here are ten reasons to consider a prenup.

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
It Gets You to Talk Honestly about 
Money at the Start of a Marriage
First, we take a minute to define our terms. A prenuptial agreement is a legal 
and binding agreement between two potential spouses indicating how their 
finances will be handled in the case of a divorce. It’s not about how you’re 
going to raise the kids or whether one plans to convert to the other’s 
religion — it begins and ends at money, period. A postnuptial agreement is 
the same, but it’s hammered out after the couple is married, usually because 
some significant assets or other money issues have changed since the 
marriage.
The word prenup tends to set people’s teeth a bit on edge. For most people, 
it conjures up an image of you and your future spouse in an adversarial role 
even before you walk down the aisle. Who wants to talk about divorce before 
the honeymoon, anyway?
But believe it or not, in the right hands — meaning family law and tax 
attorneys who really know their stuff — this process doesn’t have to be an 
adversarial one. Think of it as a way to discover not only what money and 
assets the two of you have but also all the fears, hopes, and dreams about 
the use of that money.
A lot of couples don’t talk about these issues before they get married, and 
this oversight costs them down the line. A prenup forces two individuals to 
come clean about their credit, what they have at the bank and in their 
retirement accounts, and finally, what they want to do with an existing business 
or a business they hope to build someday either together or separately.
Your Life’s Work Shouldn’t 
Go down the Drain
Say you’re the spouse who’s going into a marriage with a successful business 
with excellent prospects. No, you’d never expect your future wife or husband 
to someday try to take over the business to force you out and liquidate it, but 
read the papers — it happens every day.
 
Roughly 40 percent of all marriages fail. No, that doesn’t mean that yours will 
be one of them, but if you’ve created a company, you need to think seriously 
about how both you and your company would survive a divorce.

301
 Chapter 22: Ten Reasons to Consider a Prenup 
For this reason, involving a valuation expert in the prenuptial process is 
helpful because it gives you an idea of what your company is worth in terms 
of not only brick and mortar but also all the intangibles that may well exceed 
the value of whatever hard assets you own. Your ideas, your employees, 
and your branding are part of the valuation process, so doing two valuations 
may be wise: one for peacetime, one for wartime. The first would value your 
business as if you were going to sell your company in a friendly deal on your 
terms, and the second would help you defend yourself and your company if a 
spouse petitioned for those assets.
In essence, a prenuptial valuation may become a way to support a defensive 
strategy for a company when it’s threatened in divorce court. Obviously, if 
you have extensive fears that this situation may happen, you may want to 
rethink your relationship with your intended spouse. Running the numbers 
and being honest about those fears with your potential partner right now 
may save considerable time, expense, and agony later.
If Both Spouses Have Sacrificed to Build 
the Business, They Need to Share
You’ve heard the scenario before. The wife or husband works hard to put the 
other one through medical or dental school and then settles down to raise 
the kids (forgoing any salary) after the practice takes off. Life is good, but a 
few years down the line, the marriage screeches to a halt and suddenly the 
spouse with the lucrative partnership doesn’t want to share so much with 
the nonworking spouse. The nonworking spouse faces years of catch-up on 
building a career, as well as affording retirement and huge expenses for the 
kids if they’re not properly taken care of in the divorce settlement.
 
We didn’t identify the losing spouse by gender, but today, women still face the 
greatest financial risk in a divorce by virtue of the following:
 
✓ As of 2008, women still aren’t at an even pay level with men. Most estimates 
say women earn only 76 to 80 cents on every dollar a man earns, so they 
typically bring fewer assets into a marriage and they never really catch 
up when working.
 
✓ Women frequently bear the child-care responsibilities, and many still 
give up or take breaks from full-time paid work to address that need.
 
✓ On average, women live five to six years longer than men. Thus, they 
need at least that number of years’ worth of savings to see them through 
their retirement years and end-of-life expenses.

302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
When an entrepreneurial effort is underway or planned, a prenuptial 
agreement forces a discussion on what both spouses think they’re entitled 
to if the marriage fails. Again, this conversation can force a shocking reality 
on the relationship — or an agreement that makes the marriage seem even 
stronger.
The Working Spouse Shouldn’t 
Lose the Business Entirely
Often, you see an argument made in a divorce that one spouse may have 
contributed the business idea and the financial knowledge to start a business, 
but the other spouse provided the occasional office support and kept the 
home fires burning during its early days. For this reason, some states take 
the upper hand and decide that all community property will be divided 
50/50. But in some cases, a legal agreement amends or supersedes such 
arrangements — which is why prenups were created.
For this reason, it’s critical for both sides to seek respective legal counsel in 
deciding how business assets should be split. A prenuptial agreement can 
not only protect ownership and a control interest in a closely held business 
but also declare a set formula that the married couple can use to value and 
split stock in the event of a divorce.
More is involved in this process than having both spouses come to an 
agreement on assets. Also important is structuring this agreement in a way 
that preserves the business if it’s expected to be passed on to the kids or 
sold someday as an asset that will benefit all members of the family.
Kids from Earlier Marriages 
Need Protection
Families with considerable wealth may have businesses that have lasted 
several generations, which means that many more people than just the 
current CEO depend on that business. In a private company, stakeholders 
may include children and other family members from previous marriages.
And we’re not talking about family members who sit on their butts and wait 
for checks to show up in their mailboxes. We’re talking about generations of 
family who are active workers in the business — and those who may join in 
the future.

303
 Chapter 22: Ten Reasons to Consider a Prenup 
It’s not so easy for the mega-rich, either
In the annals of great American family wealth, 
many people may not know the name Pritzker, 
but they probably know the name Hyatt Hotels. 
The Chicago family’s $20-billion empire was 
thrown into disarray after the death of the family 
patriarch, Jay Pritzker, in 1999. Various cousins 
began to fight for what they thought was their 
fair share of the family assets after the new 
head of the empire, Jay’s son Tom, took over.
The dispute within this intensely private family 
exploded after Liesel Pritzker, the daughter of 
Jay’s brother Robert from an earlier marriage 
and, at that time, a young actress in Hollywood, 
challenged the distribution of family assets 
among all the cousins. Liesel, whose parents 
divorced when she was a young child (Robert 
had other children as well) charged that she 
and her brother Matthew were being cheated 
out of their $1-billion inheritance; they eventu-
ally settled for a reported $500 million, making 
them two of the richest people in America 
younger than 30.
This lesson shows that, within even the most 
private of families, separation of assets 
requires a long-term plan and a fair amount of 
transparency.
Now consider for a moment the family 
situation of Rupert Murdoch, global media 
baron. At press time, the 76-year-old Murdoch 
was on his third marriage, with six kids total: 
one daughter from his first marriage, three kids 
from his second, and two kids from his latest. 
Granted, his company’s stock trades publicly, 
but family members control the company.
Murdoch is just one more captain of industry 
who has shown no desire to retire, but during 
the writing of this book, he was already 
positioning one of his two sons from his second 
marriage — James — as the heir apparent. Will 
James keep that advantageous position within 
the family business by the time Rupert gives up 
the reins? Who knows? But it’s an interesting 
scenario that applies to virtually any couple 
with previous families to think through before 
they marry. Consider why:
 ✓ When you’re talking about involving kids in 
the family business, it’s great if you have 
one kid who’s a clear, recognized choice 
to take over. But when half-brothers and 
half-sisters (and maybe their kids) abound 
in a company, you have to set a structure 
that nurtures both talent and the family 
relationship. Today’s black sheep can be 
the company’s savior a decade from now. 
This subject certainly goes beyond what 
legal documents can solve, and that’s why 
prospective spouses need to talk about it.
 ✓ Depending on how you’ve allocated the 
stock for the business over the years, it’s 
possible that a former mother-in-law (who 
may have written a check to start the 
business in friendlier times) may want a say 
in who gets put in charge now that you’re 
on your third wife or husband. Prenuptial 
discussions need to address how all the 
individuals who are part of a power structure 
in an existing business may affect the value 
of the company’s assets going forward.
Oh, one more thing about the Murdoch example: 
Rupert and his third wife have two kids who are 
currently under age 10. Couples with previous 
families who are going into a new marriage 
need to think not only about the kids who have 
come before but also about those who may 
arrive in the future.

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Kids from Your Next Marriage 
Need Protection, Too
The emotional competition between siblings from a single marriage can be 
cutthroat enough in a business setting; that competitive fever escalates with 
the kids from Dad’s second or third wife or Mom’s new husband.
Understandably, a child from someone’s first marriage may feel both happy 
and uneasy about the arrival of a new sibling, even if the little one is a full 
generation younger. If a clear succession and ownership structure isn’t laid 
out for the business before the founder retires or dies, warring factions of 
siblings and other family members can deplete the value of a business by 
fighting for their share of the pie.
Granted, no parent can anticipate everything their kids may do in the future, 
but as you prepare to marry, this topic deserves plenty of exploration.
Planning for Worst-Case Scenarios 
Is a Good Habit
In Chapter 24, you see the benefits of doing an exit plan for a business; the 
thought process that goes into a prenup is similar. Business owners must 
think of worst-case scenarios within every new initiative they try.
If a business already exists at the time of a marriage or becomes a reality 
afterward, optimally, both parties will take the time to think through the role 
a marital breakup would have in the overall course of the business.
Also important is realizing that business problems and marital problems 
don’t occur in separate vacuums. Any number of entrepreneurs can tell you 
that industry downturns or sudden shifts in a company’s fortunes have a real 
impact at home.

305
 Chapter 22: Ten Reasons to Consider a Prenup 
Your Business and Personal Finances 
Really Are Connected
Particularly for small, closely held companies, business assets can really be 
marital assets, and it makes sense for any business owner to take a tough look 
at anything that can go wrong in a marriage and in a business concurrently.
Toward the beginning of this chapter, we mention a couple in which 
the husband or wife paid the educational bills for the other to start a 
professional practice. Many spouses have surrendered their paychecks or 
personal investments as startup funds for all kinds of businesses.
When doing a prenup, you need to talk about the possibility of these sacrifices 
going forward and how they’re connected to marital assets based on state 
and local laws governing such subjects.
Family Legacies Need Protection
Whether it’s the gas station on the corner or the regional bank your great-
grandpa started back in the 1800s, a family business is more than a cash 
register. It’s an important source of history to people who share blood, skills, 
and experiences, regardless of whether they get along.
A business may also be a critical asset to the community. In an age of global-
ization and sameness across all industries, closely held companies that keep 
family members as employees and managers have a unique way of touching 
everyone around them. After generations of tough economic times, daunting 
competitors, and other business threats, a marriage going bad shouldn’t be 
what finally kills a family legacy.
When spouses begin talking about a prenuptial agreement, if the family legacy 
is critical, it should be one of the first issues to come up in conversation.

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
When a Marriage Ends, a Prenup (Or 
Postnup) Can Save You Both Money
One of the reasons couples resist the idea of a prenup is that it’s such an 
unpleasant idea. What couple in love and with all hope of staying together a 
lifetime wants to talk about a breakup?
But if a business exists before marriage or is created after marriage, it’s 
best to talk about how that business will live — and for what reasons — if a 
divorce happens. And it’s absolutely best to discuss those possibilities while 
both sides are friendly and have the benefit of independent counsel to take 
them through a valuation process and the creation of an ownership struc-
ture that ensures the future of the company for one or both spouses or their 
 children.
It’s not unthinkable that everything you’ve worked to build will go to the 
government, lawyers, and tax experts. Is that what you want? This concern 
may also create the need to review your prenuptial agreement whenever 
business conditions change.

Chapter 23
Ten Questions to Answer Before 
Considering a Partnership 
Agreement
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering why partnership agreements are important
▶ Finding out how the structure of a partnership can affect its valuation
▶ Understanding the role of intangible assets and intellectual property
▶ Looking at the pluses and minuses of partnership agreements
▶ Planning for future disputes
P
artnerships are unincorporated businesses in which two or more 
individuals manage the business and are equally liable for its debts 
(see Part IV for details). You can find variations on the level of liability based 
on the legal definition of the partnership. Partnerships are a particularly 
interesting valuation challenge because they typically don’t have many hard 
assets to value. In fact, a lot of partnership value is intrinsic — it’s tied up 
in the skills of the individuals who form the partnership. Individuals may 
change their legal business status from a partnership to another designation 
over time — becoming a corporation or a limited liability company (LLC), for 
instance — when the purpose or sheer size of the business changes.
But even in the earliest stages, partnerships shouldn’t be informal arrangements 
between individuals, even if they’re siblings, spouses, or close friends. As 
with any business contract, partnership agreements aren’t written for the 
good times; they’re written for the bad times — or at least, for times of big 
change for the business, which can be positive or negative.

Why put a chapter on partnership agreements in a book on valuation? 
Because partnerships have their own valuation challenges. In many cases, 
the main asset value of a partnership isn’t something you can physically 
touch. Many law firms and medical offices start off as partnerships, and aside 
from a few hard assets such as office furniture and computers, you don’t 
actually see the real value of these businesses. The real value resides inside 
the heads of the partners. Partnerships are almost always about intellectual 
capital.
Both intellectual capital and financial capital are required to run a partnership. 
So take a look at the ten critical elements that a partnership agreement 
should cover.
Who Will Be in the Partnership?
The partnership agreement must spell out the name of the business, its 
location, the names of both partners, and their places of residence. It also 
must state the starting date of the partnership to define the start of the legal 
connection between the partners.
This point may seem rather obvious, but in case of the breakup of the 
partnership or a legal challenge from outside, having this information 
recorded in a legal document is important.
How Much Capital Does Each Partner 
Have to Kick In at the Start?
Particularly important is stating the exact amount of money or other assets 
each partner brings to the enterprise on the first day of business. Yet it’s not 
so important that partners do an even split of the business — in fact, doing 
so may be a bad idea from a management standpoint. Here’s why: The 
business needs a dominant partner (or partners) who can break a tie over 
strategic key decisions (we get to this issue in more detail shortly).
In most partnerships, money isn’t the only form of capital. In various profes-
sional practices, and particularly in medical practices, professionals with 
great reputations (or great potential) may be wooed into joining a new prac-
tice. They may be asked to join up with a certain contribution of consultation 
hours or a commitment to certain services that benefit the overall partner-
ship. They may even be responsible for developing a whole new division of 
that partnership. And here’s where intrinsic value comes in: A partner who 
comes in without a major cash or hard asset infusion may have his part of 
the partnership agreement drawn with certain performance targets to meet.

 Chapter 23: Ten Questions to Answer Before Considering a Partnership Agreement
 
If partners can’t agree on which partners will be responsible for key functions 
of the business, maybe they have no business being partners after all. Creating 
a partnership agreement may unearth power-sharing problems that can sink a 
business, and knowing this information in advance can save time, money, and 
most importantly, professional and personal relationships.
How Will Decisions Be Made?
Some professionals are born managers; others are born innovators. Some are 
born salespeople; others are born bean counters. A business needs all these 
personalities and skills, in addition to the basic professional skill (medicine, 
law, consulting, and so on) the practice is built around.
The partnership agreement should spell out, in as much detail as necessary, 
how much authority each partner has and over which specific issues and 
areas of the business each partner has that authority.
For instance, do all partners have the right to solicit and sign contracts with 
specific vendors or investors? Isn’t that a little like having a joint checking 
account in which both spouses write checks like crazy and don’t figure it out 
until the overdraft notice arrives? Also, will one partner have 1 percent more 
ownership in the partnership than the other partners to break tight votes 
over particular decisions?
Do You Have a Plan for 
Resolving Disputes?
This particularly important point is the exact reason you need to write such 
agreements for the bad times, not the good ones. Planning how you’ll handle 
disputes within the partnership involves not only exploring the various deal-
breaking issues between partners but also looking at all the potential outside 
conflicts and occurrences that could sink the partnership.
Many partnership agreements specify arbitration for most disputes simply 
because that process is generally less expensive to pursue than disputes in 
open court. A trained mediator or arbitrator usually handles arbitration.
Addressing how the immediate family of a deceased or incapacitated partner 
may fit into the dispute-resolution process is also wise. Depending on how 
the total partnership agreement is written, spouses and children may have 
leverage to endanger the partnership by making a claim on the departed 
partner’s assets.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
How Will the Firm Admit New Partners?
Recruiting new partners is necessary for some partnerships but not for 
others. Valuation may be an important consideration in this issue because in 
the case of partnerships intended to continue beyond the founding partners’ 
retirement (such as medical or dental practices), recruiting new, talented 
partners over time is critical to the overall value of the practice.
Requirements may change over time, but founding or managing partners 
must decide before recruiting new partners exactly what will be required 
of these new partners to enter the practice. Will they have to cough up con-
siderable capital to join? Will some in-kind arrangement with experienced or 
younger professionals allow them to earn their way into the practice? Will 
new partners have to promise a certain number of hours to the practice or 
start up a lucrative division that the original partnership did not have?
 
Bringing in new partners is often more complex than bringing in new salaried 
employees because you’re giving them an ownership stake that affords them 
whatever power you grant them. Founding or senior partners should confer 
with an attorney who is experienced in partnership agreements about related 
growth and power issues.
How and When Will Profits — 
or Losses — Be Shared?
The issue of sharing profits and losses speaks to the operating and ownership 
structure of the partnership. Depending on the kind of partnership you 
create, you and your partner may share profits or losses in certain 
conventional ways, but think through these key considerations:
 
✓ Will all the partners — junior as well as senior — share profits and 
losses equally? (The answer generally is no.)
 
✓ How often will profits be paid out, and in what form?
 
✓ What are the tax implications of the way this money is paid out?
 
✓ What safeguards are in place to make sure that individual partners can 
cover losses?

 Chapter 23: Ten Questions to Answer Before Considering a Partnership Agreement
What Happens If a Partner 
Leaves or Dies?
Welcome to the world of buy/sell agreements, which are perhaps the most 
important segment of a partnership agreement. Why? Because these agree-
ments can save a partnership when a partner dies, becomes incapacitated, 
or leaves the practice (under a variety of circumstances) or when the 
deceased’s family members come knocking on the door for what they believe 
is their share.
Buy/sell agreements have two primary structures: cross-purchase agreements, 
in which the remaining partnership owners buy the departing partner’s stock 
or partnership interest, and stock-redemption agreements, in which the com-
pany buys the stock of the departing owner.
Get advice from tax experts and experienced business attorneys about which 
model works best for your situation. Cross-purchase agreements may have 
certain tax advantages that stem from the way the market value of that business 
is calculated at the time the agreement is triggered. Shareholder models can 
get complicated based on the number of shareholders the partnership has 
and based on any valuation issues that come into play.
 
The partnership agreement that you and your two or three founding partners 
write in year one of the business may not fit you or the firm in years 15 or 20. 
Make a plan to revisit the efficacy of the agreement throughout the life of the 
partnership.
How Will the Partnership 
Be Sold or Dissolved?
We spend plenty of time in this book discussing exit plans, which are 
particularly important in partnerships. Succession takes on a slightly 
different tone in a partnership because of the multiple-owner structure.
An owner of a corporation designates the successor, who may or may not 
have an ownership stake in the corporation. In a partnership, all partners are 
owners (possibly to varying degrees, but they’re still owners). Addressing 
retirement, departure, and succession issues is in their best interest, to 
ensure the highest ongoing valuation for the firm.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The buy/sell agreement may address some of these issues, but if the 
partnership is terminal — meaning that it ends when the current set of 
partners leaves, dies, becomes incapacitated, or retires — that ending must 
be planned and spelled out for designated parties to execute.
How Will Legal Disputes inside and 
outside the Partnership Be Handled?
We’ve already talked about internal disputes being subject to arbitration or 
mediation. Depending on the industry the partnership is in, you may be able 
to blunt the impact of lawsuits or other complaints against the business from 
clients, suppliers, or other constituencies in certain ways.
No one-size-fits-all solution applies to this issue, and because such threats 
may affect the valuation of the firm, it’s extremely important to get legal 
advice on such protections.
Will Noncompete Issues Be Covered?
If a partner leaves the firm or practice, do you want her to hang out her new 
shingle right across the street? Probably not. Most conventional partnership 
agreements include noncompete clauses to keep departing partners from 
immediately setting up a competing business that would be detrimental to 
the former practice or partnership.
Many of these agreements force the departing partner out of their market 
for a certain length of time, meaning that they may be forced to practice in 
another state before coming back home. After all, it’s all about saving the 
originating practice.

Ten Things to Consider Before 
Transforming Your Company 
Into an ESOP
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a handle on ESOPs and how they work
▶ Examining the details that make up an ESOP
A
n employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a trust established by a 
company for the allocation of shares to employees. It sounds almost 
altruistic: A business owner works hard; builds a profitable, successful 
company; and then, out of the goodness of her heart, creates shares that she 
allocates to all her wonderful workers.
Okay, we’re being a bit snide here. In truth, ESOPs can work out very well 
for a business’s founder and her workers, and some owners really do want 
their employees to share in their success. But make no mistake: In nearly 
every case, ESOPs are created in the best interests of those who create them. 
In most cases, the creator is the business owner or the company’s top 
management, but sometimes the workers propose ESOPs.
Why are ESOPs a valuation issue? Getting an ESOP off the ground means 
establishing that the company is a valuable asset in its own right, which 
requires expertise and planning. This chapter names ten things to do before 
creating an ESOP.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Research How ESOPs Are Created
In the conventional model for creating an ESOP, a business owner sets up a 
trust to which he makes annual contributions of stock, and that stock goes 
into individual employee accounts within the trust. Workers own stock based 
on their salary levels or years of service.
Printing stock certificates on your computer doesn’t make your company an 
ESOP. You need to fund the stock offering. Some companies use their own 
resources, get employees to contribute, or borrow money from banks, 
insurance companies, or private parties.
ESOP shares must vest before employees are entitled to receive them. Under 
rules set in 2006, vesting must be completed after three years (for cliff 
vesting — employees remain unvested during an initial period of service but 
become fully vested after that) or six years (for graded vesting — employees 
become vested in 20 percent of their accrued benefits after an initial period 
of service; they become vested in an additional 20 percent in each subsequent 
year, with full vesting four years later).
We’re not going to get into the minutiae of the ESOP creation process 
because this book isn’t about ESOPs. But it’s safe to say that you’re going to 
need a variety of experts — attorneys who have specific knowledge of ESOP 
creation, as well as your private attorneys, accountants, and financial planners.
 
ESOPs, like most major business transitions, aren’t born in a day. At least, 
they shouldn’t be. In a family business, you may need months or years to sell 
this idea to other family members, because the idea is all about sharing the 
wealth.
Understand Why ESOPs Are Attractive 
in Certain Situations
According to the ESOP Association (www.esopassociation.org), the two 
most common uses of an ESOP are to buy the stock of a retiring owner of a 
closely held company (probably a big issue for people reading this book) and 
to create an additional employee benefit or incentive plan to ensure the 
company’s growth. But ESOPs have other purposes as well, such as to 
finance a company’s expansion, spin off an operation into a separate company, 
or take a public company private.

315
Chapter 24: Ten Things to Consider Before Transforming Your Company Into an ESOP
In very few cases (about 2 percent), the ESOP Association says, ESOPs are 
formed as a last-ditch effort to bail out a company that’s dying — you see 
both employees and owners attempting to save companies in this way. This 
process isn’t for the squeamish.
You also hear about companies that create ESOPs to prevent unwanted 
takeovers. If a substantial amount of stock is in the hands of founders 
or employees, a company may be able to provide a united front against 
unwanted suitors.
Know How the Tax Advantages Work
Congress has provided certain tax incentives that make ESOPs a good deal 
for the owners of the business as well as for the new owners created by the 
ESOP:
 
✓ Deduction for ESOP contributions: ESOP contributions (in cash or 
securities) are tax deductible to the sponsoring corporation based on 
certain limits. When employers contribute their securities directly, they 
may take a deduction for the full value of the stock contributed. That 
deduction may allow an employer to increase her profits thanks to the 
taxes saved.
 
 If the ESOP is leveraged — that is, financed by a loan from a bank or 
other source — the tax advantages can be sweeter. Because contributions 
to a tax-qualified employee benefit plan are tax deductible, thereafter 
the employer may deduct contributions to the ESOP that are used to 
repay not only the interest on the loan but principal as well.
 
✓ ESOP rollover: Keep in mind that an ESOP allows a shareholder or 
group of shareholders of a closely held company to sell stock in the 
company to the firm’s ESOP and defer federal income taxes on the gain 
from the sale. The ESOP must own at least 30 percent of the company’s 
stock immediately after the sale, and the seller(s) must reinvest the 
proceeds from the sale in the securities of domestic operating corporations 
within 15 months (3 months before or 12 months after the sale). This tax 
break isn’t always available to current or retiring owners.
 
✓ Deduction for dividends: Employers who create an ESOP also get a tax 
deduction for cash dividends paid on stock purchased with a loan for 
those ESOP securities. A deduction is also available for dividends paid 
on ESOP leveraged stock to the extent that the dividends are used to 
reduce the principal or to pay interest on a loan incurred to buy that 
stock.

316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Examine How Valuation Comes In
We start this section by saying that the U.S. Department of Labor — which 
puts out most of the rules and regulations for ESOPs — demands that you 
get an appraiser trained in ESOP work to do a valuation of the company to 
determine what the ESOP will actually pay for all or part of the company. 
Remember that the ESOP represents the employees who have a majority or 
minority ownership stake in the company.
This process gets pretty complicated. For full details, you can consult plenty 
of books on ESOPs. But valuation experts in an ESOP situation do the same 
thing that valuation experts do in other situations: They value the assets 
of the company and apply certain discounts to their price based on certain 
facts about the way the company will be owned and how marketable it would 
be to new buyers if an ESOP were in place.
Bottom line: Setting up an ESOP for your company isn’t like giving yourself a 
hammer to break a piggy bank with. An ESOP is a complicated strategic 
transaction that has consequences for the value of the company based on the 
way you structure it. The appraiser or valuation professional isn’t the only 
expert you involve in this process; you also need to work with estate and tax 
attorneys, as well as financial advisors.
Get a Handle on Your Launch Steps
Setting up an ESOP involves not only time but also a fairly considerable paper 
trail. Here are just a few of the tasks involved over the time it takes to form 
an ESOP:
 
✓ Hire attorneys to design, draft, and implement ESOP plan documents 
and various trust agreements.
 
✓ Work with these attorneys to obtain favorable determination letters 
from the Internal Revenue Service.
 
✓ Create ESOP feasibility and business succession studies.
 
✓ Start your business succession plans.
 
✓ Consider and put into place the financing options to launch the ESOP.
 
✓ Structure and record ESOP and related transactions.
 
✓ Advise fiduciaries on the status of the transition.

317
Chapter 24: Ten Things to Consider Before Transforming Your Company Into an ESOP
 
✓ Inform clients and customers.
 
✓ Settle all legal matters that could threaten the transition.
 
✓ Change over all tax-reporting structures to fit the ESOP structure.
 
You always need a valuation professional who understands your industry and 
the particular objective for which you’re doing the valuation. Anyone who 
does your valuation work on an ESOP should have verifiable experience in 
valuing ESOPs.
Prepare for Preparation Costs
No one-size-fits-all cost applies to doing an ESOP, but fees are the only really 
easy thing to quantify in this process. Attorneys and tax/valuation experts 
may cost anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000, but you can vary those amounts 
based on how much preparation and study you bring to the process.
The tougher part to quantify is your time, especially the time you need to 
spend educating your officers and employees about the process. An ESOP 
isn’t something that you can do — or should do — in a couple of months. The 
best-laid ESOPs are planned well in advance, with firm ideas about how that 
ownership structure will serve the growth of the company going forward.
Get Ready to Train Next-Generation 
Leadership
Training next-generation leaders is the succession-planning component of 
the ESOP process. If the ESOP enables a primary owner or a founder to 
retire with a sizable cash payment, it doesn’t signal the end of that person’s 
interest in the company. Family and friends will remain, and it’s in everyone’s 
best interest that the value of the company be maintained over the long term.
Many owners plan an ESOP well before their retirement — sometimes, 10 
to 15 years before. The advantage is that not only do you get to review and 
assemble management talent for the next generation, but you also get to 
oversee the cultural change that ESOPs should bring. If you’re making owners 
out of your officers and staff members, they should start acting like owners, 
setting and reaching performance targets that should guide all their actions 
going forward.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Plan Ongoing Training for Employees
You can’t stop looking for talent on the lower rungs of top management. In 
an ownership culture, you need to train and educate employees at all levels 
about what’s going on with the company so they know exactly what their 
responsibilities are in continuing to build value at the company they will own.
This process is important because a company stops being a paternalistic 
organization the minute it becomes an ESOP. The organization still has 
leaders and employees, but tremendous advantages exist when you make 
employees at all levels aware of what it takes to keep the company growing.
Estimate ESOP Costs after Launch
According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, a company with 
20 employees might spend $2,000 a year for plan administration costs, such 
as filing reports, keeping records, and sending account statements, plus an 
additional $30 to $60 per employee for special situations such as retirement 
or plan asset allocations.
Also keep in mind that if a company has to borrow to launch the ESOP and 
the loan comes at a high rate, it’s particularly important to think carefully 
about how that debt will be managed and eventually extinguished — which 
brings us to the last and most important item, which follows.
Realize That ESOPs Can Fail
The idea that ESOPs can fail is an important one. In fact, while we were editing 
this book, one of the biggest ESOPs in history came dangerously close to 
failing. The Tribune Company, parent of the Chicago Tribune newspaper, was 
transformed into an ESOP as a way for real estate investor Sam Zell to take 
over the company in mid-2008. Thanks to factors including the failing economy 
and the rapid decline of the newspaper industry, the company filed for 
bankruptcy protection by the end of 2008. Reports circulated that the 
company’s employees were particularly vulnerable because their accounts 
were 100 percent invested in company stock, which can be decimated by 
bankruptcy.
When considering bankruptcy, owners and all their experts need to be 
particularly vigilant about the prospects of the company’s industry and all 
the possible disasters that may happen.

Glossary
accounting change: Any variation in the way that accounts are prepared. 
Various events could account for the change, such as new Internal Revenue 
Service regulations or the adoption of new methods in allowing for doubtful 
(probably noncollectible) accounts receivable. Whenever such a change 
occurs, accountants are expected to footnote any financial statement, 
offering a full explanation of the reason for the change.
accounts payable: What a company owes to outside suppliers/vendors. 
Accounts payable are considered to be part of a company’s short-term debt 
and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
accounts receivable: What a company is owed from customers who have 
purchased its goods or services. Accounts receivable are considered to be an 
asset on the company’s balance sheet.
accretion: Growth in the value of assets.
acid-test ratio: See quick ratio.
addbacks: Discretionary (nonessential to operations) items in the profit-and-
loss statement. These items are added back to net pretax operating profit to 
estimate a company’s economic cash flow versus cash flow produced for tax 
purposes.
adjusted book value: The book value that results after asset or liability 
amounts are added, deleted, or changed from their respective book amounts 
to their fair market value.
adjusted book value method: A valuation method based mainly on the 
balance sheet of a business in which owners’ equity — total assets minus total 
liabilities — sets the price. In essence, the entire balance sheet is restated to 
current fair market value. The resulting equity is the adjusted book value. 
AICPA: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the leading orga-
nization of CPAs, many of whom are trained to do business valuations.
amortization: The gradual, periodic reduction of any amount, such as an 
intangible asset, a bond premium, or the payment of a mortgage or business 
loan.

Business Valuation For Dummies 
angel investor: A person who provides capital to one or more startup or 
early-stage companies, usually someone who is affluent or has a personal 
stake in the success of the venture. Valuation professionals may be brought 
in to put a dollar value on the potential business or idea.
appraisal: A professional written opinion of the value of an asset. An 
appraisal usually is required when a property is bought, sold, taxed, insured, 
or financed.
appraisal date: Same as the valuation date.
appraiser: A trained professional who has the knowledge and expertise 
necessary to estimate the value of an asset. An appraiser acts independently 
of the buying and selling parties in a transaction to arrive at the fair market 
value of an asset without allegiance to either party.
appreciation: An increase in the value of an asset.
asset: An item with an economic value that can be measured. Example assets 
include office equipment, accounts receivable, securities, real estate, and 
vehicles.
asset approach: A set of business valuation methods that determines a 
company’s value based on the value of its assets. The valuation methods 
commonly used in this approach are book value; adjusted book value; 
liquidation value; and sometimes the capitalized excess earnings method, 
which is a hybrid of the asset and income approaches. See also income 
approach.
audit: A review of a company’s finances or procedures. The four basic kinds 
of company audits are
 
✓ Financial: A formal review of a company’s financial records by a 
licensed certified public accountant to make sure that they conform to 
generally accepted auditing procedures, leading to an audit opinion
 
✓ Compliance: An audit that determines whether a company is operating 
according to national rules and regulations, as well as the regulations of 
the jurisdiction in which it operates
 
✓ Management: An audit that evaluates how well a company’s executives 
are doing their jobs
 
✓ Internal: An audit that represents an investigation by the company of its 
own procedures.
audit documentation: The written record of the basis for an auditor’s findings. 
This record may also be referred to as work papers or working papers.

321
 Glossary
auditor: A person who tests the accuracy of financial accounts and records 
kept by others. Auditors typically are employed by public accounting firms.
bad debt: All or a portion of an account, loan, or other form of receivable 
that’s considered to be uncollectible.
balance sheet: The assets, liabilities, and equity of a public or private 
corporation at a specific point in time. This document is where you go to 
determine what the company is actually worth on a book-value basis. See 
also book value.
bankruptcy: A federal court proceeding in which the assets of an insolvent 
debtor or company are liquidated and the debtor or company is relieved of 
further liability.
bonds: An interest-bearing certificate, usually issued by corporations and 
government agencies, that promises to pay interest and principal at specified 
times. Typically, investors try to diversify their investment portfolios with 
both stocks and bonds, because the value of bonds typically moves inversely 
to the value of stocks.
book value: The net value (original cost less depreciation) shown for an 
asset on a company’s balance sheet; also called net asset value. Book value 
is considered to be one of the most controversial measurements in value 
investing; some people maintain that book values can be outdated and 
therefore are not good current measurements of a company’s liquidating 
value.
business broker: A professional who assists in the buying and selling of 
businesses.
business plan: A written document created by a potential business owner 
that lists the objectives of the business and the steps and financing necessary 
to achieve those objectives.
buy/sell agreement: A provision of a franchise agreement that states 
specifically when and how an existing franchise can be bought or sold.
capital: Cash or goods used to generate income either by investing in a 
business or a different income property. 
capital gains: The monetary gains on an investment when an investor sells 
and the principal has increased in value.
capitalization: The total market value of a stock, determined by multiplying 
the number of shares by the market price.

322
Business Valuation For Dummies 
capitalization of earnings method: A method that sets a company’s value by 
dividing the expected economic benefit to the business (such as the seller’s 
discretionary cash flow) by its capitalization rate.
capitalization of excess earnings method: A hybrid of the asset and income 
approaches that calculates a company’s value as the total of its net tangible 
assets and its goodwill. See also asset approach and income approach.
capitalization rate: A calculation that converts a single year’s income 
expectancy to an indication of value by dividing the income estimate by an 
appropriate rate.
cash flow: Cash receipts less cash disbursements for a particular period. 
If, in a given month, a company pays out $30,000 and collects $40,000, its 
cash flow for the month is $10,000. Free cash flow is the amount left after all 
normal capital spending, debt service, and tax payments have occurred.
certified public accountant (CPA): An accountant who has passed the 
Uniform SPA Examination administered by AICPA and is licensed by the state 
in which he or she practices to use that title. A CPA is authorized to write an 
audit opinion or audit report on a company’s financial statements and can 
act as a final auditing authority. See also AICPA.
closely held corporation: A company that has only a few shareholders. It 
differs from a privately held corporation in that it trades shares (but very few 
shares are actually traded).
combined financial statement: A financial statement in which the income 
statements and balance sheets of related business entities (such as subsidiaries 
of the same holding company) are combined so that they may be considered 
to be one reporting entity. 
company: A formal business enterprise set up to make a profit. Companies 
include corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships.
consolidated statement: A report issued by a holding company that 
consolidates all of its subsidiaries’ earnings, assets, and liabilities. Sometimes, 
a consolidated statement makes it tough to look at the results of individual 
operations.
corporation: A business entity with legal status in which ownership is vested 
in those who purchase its stock and in so doing contribute capital to fund the 
business. For purposes of taxation or responsibility for liabilities, however, a 
corporation is regarded as being a legal entity separate from its shareholder–
owners. A corporation is formed when its founders file articles of incorporation 
with the relevant state authority — usually, the secretary of state. 

323
 Glossary
current assets: All assets that are convertible to cash within one year.
debt restructuring: A change in a company’s debt structure reflecting 
concessions granted by its creditors. Debt restructuring usually is an 
indication that a company is in financial difficulties.
debt-to-equity ratio: A way to figure out which group provides most of the 
firm’s capital: owners or lenders. This ratio also indicates whether a company 
can repay its obligations. If the ratio climbs, the company may be taking on 
too much debt.
discounted cash flow method: A valuation method that measures the value 
of the expected economic benefits stream in present-day dollars, given the 
risks associated with owning and operating a small business.
earnings: The amount of money that a company has left over after paying all 
its bills and other obligations. The company may distribute a portion or all 
of its earnings to investors in the form of stock or cash dividends, or it may 
reinvest those earnings in the business to help it grow.
employee stock ownership plan: A trust set up by a company to give its 
stock to employees over time as a tax- and estate-planning vehicle.
equity: Also called net worth. In accounting, equity is assets minus liabilities. 
In a sole proprietorship, equity belongs to the owner; in a corporation, it 
belongs to the stockholders.
equity financing: A way to finance a company by issuing stock to investors 
who give money in exchange to build the business.
extraordinary item: A one-time event that affects the company’s earnings 
for one quarter or year. From a valuation standpoint, extraordinary items 
are important signals that a company is in for long-term problems that may 
depress or raise its value.
fair market value: The monetary amount that a buyer may reasonably offer 
and a seller may accept in exchange for the asset.
fairness/solvency opinion: Independent, objective analysis of a proposed 
deal’s financial aspects from the point of view of one or more of the parties in 
the transaction. 
franchise: A license that awards rights from a franchisor to a franchisee to 
use specific trademarks, business systems, and a business concept.

324
Business Valuation For Dummies 
franchise agreement: The legal document that governs the franchisor–
franchisee relationship and specifies the terms of the franchise purchase. A 
typical franchise agreement may include specific details on the following:
 
✓ The franchise system, such as use of trademarks and products
 
✓ Territory
 
✓ Rights and obligations of the parties: standards, procedures, training, 
assistance, advertising, and so on
 
✓ Term (duration) of the franchise agreement
 
✓ Payments made by the franchisee to the franchisor

fundamental analysis: A method of stock analysis that relies on the reported 
numbers of a company for investment decisions, as opposed to technical 
analysis, which looks at the price and volume history of a stock. Fundamental 
analysis is an important factor in value investing.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP): The financial reporting 
standards with which all public companies must comply so that each annual 
or quarterly report is uniform. Whenever a company’s results fail to meet 
these principles, this failure indicates problems or changes in the company’s 
financial fortunes.
generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS): Guidelines that auditors 
follow in preparing (and certifying) financial statements for clients. Any 
certified public accountant who doesn’t follow these guidelines is in violation 
of AICPA rules and can be held legally liable by clients. See also AICPA.
goodwill: An intangible asset of a company, usually quantified when a 
company is purchased, the amount being the excess over book value.
income approach: A family of valuation methods that determines the value 
of a business based on its ability to generate desired economic benefit for the 
owners. 
income statement: Also called the profit-and-loss statement or P&L. This 
document is used in combination with the company’s balance sheet to 
provide an overall look at the company’s finances.
incorporation: It is the process of turning a business into one that is separate 
from its owners. A corporation accomplishes several goals. It protects the 
owner’s assets against the company’s liabilities, can achieve a lower tax 
rate than on an owner’s personal income and allows owners to raise capital 
through the sale of stock. 
intangible assets: Assets without a strict dollar value in the form of goodwill, 
patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade names.

borrowings, or bond indebtedness.
liquid asset: An asset that can be converted to cash within 30 days.
liquidation value: The value of a company based on a plan to close it as a 
going concern and simply sell off the assets.
liquidity: The degree of ease and certainty of value with which a security can 
be converted to cash.
market-based business valuation: A general way of setting value by comparing 
the business with similar businesses.
multiple of discretionary earnings business valuation method: A method 
that establishes value by multiplying the seller’s discretionary cash flow by

preferred stock: A security representing prior claim to common stock on 
the firm’s earnings and assets. Preferred stockholders normally forgo voting 
rights and receive a fixed dividend that takes precedence over payment of 
dividends to common stockholders.
price-to-book ratio: Market price per share divided by book value (tangible 
assets less all liabilities) per share; a measure of stock valuation relative to 
net assets. 
pro forma statement: A calculated guess about the future earnings or bal-
ance sheet of a company, usually part of initial public offering documents or 
merger and acquisition proposals.
quick ratio: A method of analyzing a balance sheet, in which inventory is 
subtracted from current assets and the result is divided by current liabilities. 
The quick ratio is also known as the acid-test ratio because it indicates how 
much money is truly available for current needs.

business operations or pay its creditors.
value: A quality, feature, or function of a business that makes customers and

Your hands-on guide to 
calculating — and 
understanding — business value 
Want to determine the value of a business, but not sure 
where to start? This plain-English guide gives you step-
by-step directions for the major valuation methods, 
supporting them with real-world examples. You’ll work with 
easy-to-understand valuation models and apply them to 
different types of businesses to achieve the fairest, most 
affordable valuation solution.
•  Business valuation 101 — learn what it is, why it’s a challenge, 
and the approaches that experts take to uncover value (or the 
lack of it)
•  Grasp key valuation tools — understand valuation reports, 
financial statements, and “rule of thumb” guidelines for specific 
businesses
•  Get to the heart of it — analyze historical performance, evaluate 
assets and income value, and estimate cost of capital 
•  If you’re selling a business — see how to conduct due diligence 
and increase your company’s value
•  If you’re buying a business — incorporate valuation into the 
necessary prep before negotiation 
•  Seek help from the experts — from divorce to estate planning to 
attracting outside investors, know when and why you should get 
outside valuation help
